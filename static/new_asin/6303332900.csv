I saw this video for the first time when I was a child and ever since then had been searching every video store for my very  own copy.  This is a terrific video for anyone, be they young children or  even adults.  This video has become a Christmas tradition in our house and  Burt's Christmas ornament that reads, ""A Friend Is the Best Thing You  Can Have, and the best thing that you can be"" has been my favorite  quote for years.",957312000,3,523,4.431578947368421

The movie is perfect for all ages--short and sweet, with a good message for the kids, but it is funny and not obnoxious to adults. It has so much charm!",1355270400,,268,3.9814814814814814
7844397,4,6303332900,"I am a child of the 80s. I love the old cartoons from my childhood, and this one is a gem that I thought was long forgotten. I was excited to discover it here and immediately watched it, even though it's only October. The plot revolves around a worm named Bert, who is new to the town of Wormingham and, because of his somewhat clumsy nature, is having a hard time fitting in. He has friends in Crystal (a neighbor who is fond of Bert) and Wilbur Diggs (a wise and slightly older worm). When Bert accidentally breaks some decorations at town hall, he is thrown out by the chairwoman of the Christmas party, Wormaline Wiggler. It is soon after that he decides to leave town, just as a snowstorm is coming. The town then heads out to find him before he freezes. It's a sweet story about fitting in and friendship, set around the holidays. It has a couple wonderful quotes I love, including ""A friend is the best thing you can have, and the best thing that you can be.""",1351209600,,966,4.313186813186813
7844398,5,6303332900,"I have been looking for this movie for 20+ years and I finally found it on Amazon, to my extreme delight. I want to thank the seller for having and being willing to sell me this classic old movie. This Christmas Eve I intend to sit with my kids and watch it, fulfilling a dream I've had since they were born. Thank you!!",1349136000,,320,4.095238095238095

7844401,5,6303332900,"My daughter has grown up since the first time she saw this holiday show. She has always loved it, and was very happy to see it again. I'm sure it will be with this family for years to come. It is her favorite.",1190505600,,209,3.883720930232558
7844402,5,6303332900,"I am probably one of the biggest cynics around, but I loved this video when I got it for my daughter when she was about 5.  It quickly became one of her favorites.  Recently, I bought it for my friend's nephew and it is just as popular now.  The story is very cute and positive.",1022198400,,278,4.0181818181818185
7844403,3,6303332900,"Actually, I would rather give this 3 1/2 stars. To be sure, this is not a ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,"" but it is a wonderful Christmas Special that probably won't get the popularity it deserves. Burt is a very interesting character. He tries so hard to help everyone, but he keeps stumbling over his feet. It is striking that Wormaline is so caught up in the false meaning of Christmas that she ends up being cruel to Burt. Crystal and the old man are very memorable. They are nice to Burt and they even stand up for him without worrying about how it might affect their reputations. The mayor has a small but significant part. He enters and is upset by the harsh treatment of Burt. When all is well, it is interesting how everyone realizes that Burt DID have talents. But because they did not get to know him before they failed to realize it. On one hand I don't think this is the best Christmas Special out there; but on the other hand I think it is worth watching around Christmas. This is just as good (or even better) than a lot of Christmas Specials that are more popular.",977788800,,1082,4.361386138613861
