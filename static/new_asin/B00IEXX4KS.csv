6261540,5,B00IEXX4KS,"Bought it for the  3yr old Great Grandson to watch when he visits.  He seems to really enjoy the series and the characters.... along with Disney's CARS, PLANES, Monster's INC.  and anything with MONSTER TRUCKS in it.",1407628800,,216,4.783783783783784
6261541,5,B00IEXX4KS,Great deal and great movies.  They are all boxed separately too wich is nice.,1407110400,,77,4.5
6261542,5,B00IEXX4KS,"While the sequels are never truly as good as the first, they are all good despite their made for tv-esque mood. The third one was probably my favorite despite not having the same dramatic elements the human portions of the the first film had. Overall though each movie was better than I could have expected. Can't wait for Ice Age 5!!",1406505600,6,334,4.491803278688525

6261546,5,B00IEXX4KS,"As others have mentioned, while the description lists only Blu-ray discs, this set does, in fact, include blu-ray, DVD, and digital copies of each of the four Ice Age films. At this price, it's an absolute steal!

We had the first Ice Age on DVD only, and the third on blu-ray, DVD, and digital, so I thought I'd purchase 2 and 4, preferably in the combo pack format. It would have been more expensive to purchase those two than all four in this set! No brainer -- it gives us a couple extra DVDs for those that (inevitably) get scratched.

Great deal!",1405728000,53,552,4.401960784313726

6261549,5,B00IEXX4KS,"This is for the Ice Age 4-Movie Set (Blu Ray) A few things not mentioned in the description that people would probably want to know

Yes you get all 4 movies.

-Each move has its own box case. (as if you bought them individually)
-Each movie box case consists of a blu ray disc, DVD disc and digital download disc (in case your car only has a DVD player). So its nice to have all three formats

- The Sound is in DTS HD Master Audio for all the Blu Ray Discs. Pretty sure only one of the movies is 7.1, the rest are 5.1

The movies are cute and the picture quality is awesome. Enjoy",1398816000,281,582,3.9913793103448274

6261603,5,B00IEXX4KS,"Ordered this for my toddler who fell in love with the squirrel character while watching one of these movies on cable TV.  I wish it came with a digital version as well that could be put on a tablet, but for the price I couldn't be happier with this DVD set.  It comes with Ice Age, Ice Age the Meltdown, Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and Ice Age Continental Drift PLUS Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas.  Haven't seen the last one yet, assuming it's a short movie though.  Very decent kids movies with jokes and innuendos for the parents who get stuck watching these on repeat.",1487289600,4,573,4.327102803738318

6261609,5,B00IEXX4KS,"Ever since my toddler took over my television, I have been exposed to an endless string of awful kids shows and movies.  The Ice Age movies are good.  He likes the cartoony characters and implausible action, I like the clever, well-written dialog.  The story is generally heartwarming, with moral protagonists trying to overcome personal struggles and external threats.  There are elements of innuendo that will generally pass safely over youngster's heads (when Manny inarticulately and unintentionally propositions Elly, because he believes they are the last two living mammoths and should try to save their species, and she calls him on it, for example.)  These are frequent enough to keep the moms and dads laughing.",1486339200,4,720,5.280701754385965

The only issue I have is I noticed the cardboard sleeve that holds them was dinged up on a couple corners. It's not something you expect with a new set but not worth sending back and not enough to lower my review.
 I like the sets that offer BluRay, DVD, and a digital copy, your sure to be able to watch where ever you want. As usual Amazons service is excellent with fast shipping.

Like other reviewers I got 4 movies, 4 cases and 2 discs in each case, making 8 discs, not 4.

 I never saw a couple of these movies and was impressed at how funny these #3 and #4 actually are.  I didn't think they would be able to keep the humor going but they kept it pretty funny, especially Dawn of the Dinosaurs.

I am also trying to build my digital copy collection through UltraViolet and the first 2 movies Ice Age & Ice Age The Meltdown digital copy is only iTunes & PC.  Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Ice Age Continental Drift digital copy is UltraViolet & iTunes.  I use VUDU to manage my UltraViolet collection of movies and I still had to purchase the digital copies for the first 2 movies through them.,1430784000,5,677,4.224806201550388

The only reason I bought this set was because they all came with a digital copy.  The only one that worked was the last one.  The last one I was able to put in my vudu account.  The other 3 need to be loaded into my iTunes account.  Well I tried all 3 of them and none of them are able to go into my iTunes account.  I think you need to let people know this and the fact that putting a disc in your computer to get loaded into iTunes on these does not work.  If your going to sell a set of these then they all should be able to be put into a vudu account or all in iTunes not 1 to vudu and the rest to iTunes.  The movies I give a 5 to but the service and explanation of the product is causing me to give a 4 star.,1423267200,13,928,3.6515151515151514

6261985,5,B00IEXX4KS,These movies are great fun!!,1422489600,,28,4.8
6261986,5,B00IEXX4KS,"My son adores all four of these movies. After realizing the ridiculousness of having them all recorded on our DVR, some with commercials and scenes cut and some without, I decided to get these for him for Christmas.
I was honestly expecting just the four Blu-Rays and possibly all in just one box and was content with that for the price, honestly. I was delighted to find that this is a proper box set. It's all 4 movies, in their own Blu-Ray cases all in a cardboard box. Each Blu-Ray is just the way you'd buy it individually from the store, complete with. Blu-Ray disc, DVD disc and digital copy. Hot dog, what a deal!

 When we get Blu-Rays of family movies we usually send the DVD copy over to my in-law's house. My son and his cousins usually spend a couple of days a week there, so it's nice to be able to send their favorite movies over and not have to worry about remembering to get them back or trying to remember if they bought so-and-so movie themselves or if it's one we brought over and forgot. My MIL loves the Ice Age movies, but only has a copy of the first one, so she was just as excited as the kids to have copies of them all at her house.
And I now have the option of loading up one or two of them on the tablet for the next time we go on a road trip.

One thing I was worried about is the captions. I have hearing issues and my son is very used to watching movies with the captions on. Even if I'm not watching it he will turn them on himself because he prefers it. I've had issues before where I've ordered inexpensive copies of movies on DVD online only to find that it didn't have captions. Some only had poor subtitles, only had subtitle options in languages I don't speak, or had no subtitle or caption options at all. (NOTE: the difference between captions & subtitles: captions have indications of who's talking if they're not on screen, sounds that are happening in the background, tell you if music is playing, etc. Subtitles only copy the dialogue, not background noises, nonverbal sounds, and often don't indicate who is speaking. Poor subtitles will leave out lines, make long sentences more concise by removing details, and often won't indicate one-word statements like ""yes,"" ""no,"" ""uh-huh,"" or one character calling another's name. It makes a big difference when your hearing problems are slight enough to allow you to understand most dialogue, but not be able to hear many background noises, the difference between things like ""uh-huh"" and ""uh-uh"", or fully understand especially deep or especially high voices. And if especially makes a difference when you have friends and family that are Deaf.)
These Blu-Rays (and I believe the DVDs as well) have proper Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (which are proper captions). I think they might also have options for subtitles in a couple of languages that aren't frequently offered on DVDs distributed in the USA (I'm pretty sure Mandarin is an option and Cantonese and Korean might be as well) but as I don't read/speak those languages I mostly noticed it because it was an unusual thing to see in a subtitle menu.

These really and truly are, as far as I can tell, the exact same Blu-Ray dvds you'd buy in the store, but all in a set and at the cost of only one-and-a-half of the dvds, if that. Highly, highly recommend!",1422403200,12,3315,4.52
6261987,4,B00IEXX4KS,The blue-ray discs were great except the third movie. I could not play it as there were running pixel blocks through out the screen. I had to use the DVD instead. I did not do a claim as I had to do my own postage to buy this product.,1422403200,,234,3.795918367346939

Called fox movies and they were less than helpful.  They referred the to the expiration date on DH digital offers (2014 was the latest) and said I may be out of luck with a digital copy.
