5384937,5,B00A6UHC0U,"For someone who likes action films, this is serious end of the world realistic acting on a level worthy of saveing the human race.",1372982400,,130,4.458333333333333
5384938,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Before anyone gets upset that I am reviewing this film before it is released in theaters, I want to let it be known I was fortunate enough to get advanced screening passes for the film. Guillermo del Toro directs two types of films, high concept art house type films usually in Spanish(Pans Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone), and action blockbusters with high budgets and heavy use of CGI (Blade II, Hellboy, and its sequel), this film falls into the latter category, which anyone who has seen the preview can surmise. The dialogue feels canned and cheesy one-liners fly from the mouths of nearly every actor in this film. The plot is as thin and predictable as it is farfetched, but this could all have been guessed from watching the trailer as well.

A few actors who weren't featured in the trailers make appearances, I won't spoil who they are or what roles they play, but they are a pleasant surprise as they provide some relief from a story that is a little too serious at times. While no one makes Oscar worthy performance, the acting is perfectly acceptable and on par with most action movies, although some of the actors are not the greatest at American English accents in spite of their efforts. I suppose this can be explained away as the film is set in the future, and who knows what American English will sound like then (I'll bet it will sound quite a lot like mine, my parents', and my grandparents' accents).

While the plot, dialogue, and acting are on par with every other action blockbuster of the past decade, I must admit that the CGI and visuals are some of the most realistic I have seen. The visual effects are stunning. Thanks to the amazing work of Industrial Light and Magic there is not a single scene in the film where I felt as though the CGI was blatantly apparent beyond the fact that such things do not exist, something I wish I could say about the recently released Man of Steel. The 3d is also quite good, sometimes 3d is a little overdone and it feels unnatural and hurts your eyes, this is fortunately not the case with this film. This 3d experience is easily on par with Avatar, probably the result of a film which was intended for 3d from the get go. All in all this film is an entertaining escape, albeit one that may not be too surprising or particularly memorable.",1372723200,9,2305,4.525179856115108

5385086,4,B00A6UHC0U,"There's a difference between big, dumb, and fun vs. just big and dumb. Pacific Rim exemplifies this distinction. It has all the characteristics of a schlocky B-movie pile of poo, but somehow manages to stay good. Most of this success is probably thanks to Del Toro, whose love for this sort of genre camp makes the film come off as genuine and endearing. Another director would probably turn ""Pacific Rim into Transformers 9: Bumblebee vs. Fast and Furious meets the Street Sharks."" Luckily, we didn't get that ... we got a spectacle-driven, monster-filled romp that doesn't forget that people see movies to have fun.",1524096000,,617,4.9423076923076925

5385115,5,B00A6UHC0U,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought, ""Oh, Transformers rip-off"" and I wasn't really interested.  But then I kept hearing people talking about it enthusiastically, and I learned that Guillermo del Toro directed it, so I decided to buy it.  I'm really glad I did, because this movie is not just fun, it has real charm and heart.  Guillermo del Toro proves that he's one of the best directors of our generation by not just giving you expertly framed visually-stunning action sequences, but also an emotionally-engaging narrative that draws the audience into this world.  This movie is so far from trying to ride the box-office coat-tails of the Transformers franchise, it actually shows us how a giant robot movie can be so much more than just mindless motion and noise.  The overall experience of this movie is so much more than the sum of its parts, it's one of the best examples of that elusive ""movie magic"" that everyone tries to capture.  It wouldn't be inaccurate to sum up this movie as ""a bucket of tropes, done really well,"" but it wouldn't really reflect the surprising level of emotional engagement and catharsis I experienced while watching it.  This movie earnestly and lovingly embraces the cheesiness of both the premise and of monster/mech movies in general.  It leans into that genre wholeheartedly, not afraid to be silly, and delivers some of the most emotionally-impactful moments I've ever gotten from a movie.  It was by turns hilarious, astonishing, exhilarating, and heart-wrenching.

Similar to the meticulously planned and story-boarded action sequences from Mad Max: Fury Road, the action sequences here are also not only thrilling in their scale and spectacle, they're clearly choreographed and framed so you feel drawn in to the action, instead of disoriented and confused.  There are also a lot of loving details put into the shots, to make it feel like a living world, where everything has a history and personality.  Even though 2 of the Jaegers (Cherno Alpha and Crimson Typhoon) only have one fight scene, the choreography and animation inject a lot of individuality into both of them, so the viewer remembers them as distinct characters, not just ""those 2 other ones.""

The one weak-point is Charlie Hunnam, delivering his lines in a monotone-growl that I guess is supposed to reflect his character's weary cynicism, but it just didn't land with me.  He didn't really have the charisma to pull it off.  I wish they could have gotten John Boyega to star in this first one, because I think he would have pulled it off (apart from possibly being a bit young for this middle-age character).

The rest of the cast all give stellar performances that fit the bombastic, over-the-top tone of the movie, but also have such charisma that they really endear the characters to the viewer.  Charlie Day gives my favorite performance in this ensemble, bringing all the manic energy from his Always Sunny character but tweaking it slightly to fit his crazy-scientist archetypal role here.  His co-star, Burn Gorman, very generously becomes the Yin to Charlie Day's Yang, perfectly embodying the stuffy British Academic stereotype to complement Day's mildly-unhinged character.  Burn Gorman is an incredibly accomplished character actor, always bringing emotionally-engaging nuance to his roles; here, he devotes his significant talent to playing a 1-dimensional cartoon character, and makes him the perfect foil to Charlie Day's character.

Fittingly for a B-movie type plot, there are plenty of plot holes and semi-contrivances, that, if you wanted to dwell on them, would certainly make the plot of this movie beyond laughable.  One thing that my husband observed is that it seems like cell phones don't exist in this world.  They didn't really detract from my experience, though, because I think the story derives its momentum from character moments, not events.  Of course, events happen to move the plot along, but the reason you keep watching is because you want to see what the characters do next.  Also, some of the scenes are so badass, I don't really care how they came to pass.

**tl,dr** - Should you watch it?  I'm very glad I did, because it was a great experience.  My husband was less receptive to its overt silliness but didn't mind it.  It's not as cerebral or esoteric as del Toro's other movies, so if you were expecting that, you might be disappointed.  But I feel it is a great showcase for cinematic craftsmanship, and thus more than worthy of his involvement.  I think the viewer response to this movie will vary quite a lot depending on personal preferences, but at the very least, people like me, who are cynical about movies marketed based on spectacle or genre appeal, should not count that against Pacific Rim.  It stands with the first Pirates of the Caribbean as a masterful genre movie that transcends typical expectations.",1522713600,,4884,4.9852034525277436
5385126,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Great movie.  Love the 3D experience.  I've learned that you must have the proper cables on your 3d tv if you really want to have the cinema experience.

So I click on it, and it's $8.99 for HD and $6.99 for SD.  You specifically advertised $4.99 in the section, and that is the maximum I will pay for it.

I bought this Blu-ray due to the fact that 3D will be exiting the market shortly. I figured that I would scoop up all the 3D stuff I could. This Blu-ray was worth the buy.  The effects truly pop out well with this Blu-ray compared to other even more recent movies like Jurassic World etc. Its effects added to the affect the movie had on me, making it a more enjoyable watch.  My children, teens and preteens who have seen this movie before, also agree this made our movie night wonderful.

This time, the aliens from outer space (or rather from another dimension of reality altogether) decide to attack humanity through the oceans by sending in Kaiju, a kind of cybernetic-bionic organisms which look like a cross between xenomorphs and Cthulhu.

After a coastal wall dismally fails to protect human civilization as we know it, the Homo sapiens high command decides to deploy the last remaining Jaegers, huge battle robots piloted by soldier-mediums. Meanwhile, a crazy scientist tries to mind-meld with a Kaiju, while a racketeer is busy tearing apart the dead monsters in order to sell their body parts on the Chinese black market

The whole thing ends, appropriately enough, with a huge nuclear explosion, and we can all go to sleep in the knowledge that the creators of the Kaiju have been disposed of the hard way. That is, until the planned sequel appears later this year!",1521331200,,963,4.938271604938271

I have learned very quickly that some 3D is better than others, and this is one of the good ones--with plenty of 3D depth and gigantic angles and effects that really convey the massiveness of the Jaegers and the Kaiju. If you have a decent sound system, that will definitely complement the massive scale that the 3D of this movie helps to deliver. While I won't quite say that this is a movie to buy that bigger TV for (like I do for the 3D Hobbit trilogy), if you do have a bigger TV it will certainly add to the awesomeness.

5385233,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I really enjoyed this film. Del Toro took a brand new story (not based on a well-known comic-book with decades of loyal fans behind it) and turned it into a cult hit that has now spawned an anticipated sequel. It has a ton of action, is well directed and has a good and hopeful heart at its core. This is a review of the 4K release.

Some films are just made for the 4K HDR Format and this is one of them. It's a beautiful picture transfer, with crystal clear presentation and sharp glowing images throughout. The HDR on this release is fantastic, due to the bright neon glow throughout as well as it was mostly filmed at night, those conditions really helped to show off what HDR contrast can do, whereas 4K resolution tends to be at its best and sharpest in daylight (or any scene that is indoors that is very well lit) scenes.

What also stands out here is the Atmos soundtrack! Wow! If you like your movies loud and pulsing, this is the one to own. Every punch and metallic blow is delivered in bass-heavy madness. I could feel it throughout.

Want to show off your new gear, but don't want to watch some dreadfully inept movie with good special effects? Want to take your sound system to to the next level? Look no further than this film. It shows off what Atmos can accomplish and how HDR really makes a huge difference (it's also in the new Blade Runner 4K release as well, which is, IMO, the best example of what HDR can do). It's also a feel-good action romp that is worth your time!",1518480000,,1492,4.321428571428571

5385339,5,B00A6UHC0U,This movie ranks among my top 5 sci-fi picks. Watch it on as big a screen as possible. The beauty of it blows me away. The acting is really good. The writing is really good. Nobody does any random stupid stuff like in most movies. Its good people fighting the fight against the end of the world. People die. Heroes are made. Bravery and family connections and sacrifice are the themes. Its the best of humanity. I don't think that this movie goes against the grain of the directors other works. It has authentic feelings.

It is paper thin and for whatever reason after an update to my Sony UBP-X800 4K player the disk hardly reads where I have to unplug my player for it to recognize the disk. No other 4K disk has this problem. Its probably the player but like I said no other disk has this issue and no other disk is this paper thin. Its either that or the wording of Pacific Rim on the disk is see through causing a possible miss read. I would give it 5 stars but I doubt a newer update when it happens will change this issue. I know I have seen other posts online complaining about playback issues, just be aware that you might have this problem with this disk and @almost $30 you will never repurchase a new disk.",1515715200,,1039,4.123152709359606

There is no plot beyond what is predictable. Character development is nil. Connection and conflict between characters have about the same depth as soggy cardboard.

5385364,4,B00A6UHC0U,"This is a classic blockbuster movie - light on plot, light on character development, heavy on special effects. In short, a thoroughly enjoyable film.

When I choose to watch eye-candy movies, I'm not caring whether it rips my emotions like Schindler's List or offers a tour de force performance like The King's Speech. I want some ear and eye-popping action and, really, any more involved story would just get in the way.

Simply put, it's robots vs. monsters. These have been fun movies since the 50's. It's just now, they come with CGI that's staggeringly realistic.

Having recently upgraded everything to 4K, I chose this as one of the first disks to check out the technology. It does not disappoint. The hyper-realism in the action scenes is beyond awesome and the clarity and definition everywhere else is heady stuff, sitting in your own living room.

If you like big-budget CGI films, giant robots and gargantuan monsters (and who doesn't), you should own this film. And if you don't already have it, start saving now for a 4K...I think it's a worthy investment (and I'm kind of a cheapskate).",1514073600,,1101,4.840425531914893

Only thing is, some of the dialogue and characters are terrible. The main character, Mako, the ""science duo"", Choi, and the ""angry guy"" are all cringe-inducing and embarrassingly bad. The only good actor was Pentecost.

Not enough to ruin the movie, but the middle 45 minutes, the slowest part of the movie, is painfully dull and full of cliche, flat characters who are poorly acted.

Some of the studios release films in 4K without redoing the special effects, and they look horrible in 4K.  While I understand this movie had an intermediate and video effects done in 2K, this 4K blu ray looks stunning and it is a substantial upgrade in picture from the blu ray.  I understand the movie was originally shot in 5K but was compressed from there.

5385446,4,B00A6UHC0U,"When it comes to fun action flicks, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better opportunity for a good time!  The plot and the characters are pretty stock, but that doesn't mean they're unrelatable.  I found myself actually caring about HOW they'd navigate through their confilcts rather than IF they'd navigate through.  And visually... this movie is remarkable.  The colors are bright, the definition is among the sharpest I've experienced playing blu-rays on my Samsung flatscreen, and the 3D presentation also ranks at the top of the list.  You can tell that this film (or at least this blu-ray) was actually intended to be viewed in 3D.  At best, most 3D blu-ray presentations lose saturation of color in the transfer from the 2D image but gain a higher level of definition.  The attention to detail here among the digital designs of the Kaijus, the Jaegers, and even the landscapes is nothing short of stunning.  And if you only have one pair of compatible 3D glasses but want to share this movie with friends, don't worry.  Just play the 2D version.  The picture quality is still smooth and sexy plus the rush from the action sequences and the overall coolness of the concept should be enough to capture anyone's attention and satisfy.  Also, the bonus features occupy their own separate disc, offering deep and thorough insight to the construction of this movie.",1509321600,,1365,4.891304347826087

Checked IMDB under Technical Specs. Sure enough is 2K thus upscaled to 4K. Seems a bit over priced for not being native 4K. Amazon should distinguish between real 4K native movies and upscaled movies. Could even have 1K Blu-Rays that are upscaled to 4K and sold as 4K. Would never know was being scammed.

And the seens are  bright colors and dark backgrounds together makes it different and amazing! Most of the fight seens are in the rain but still very cool with bright lights on the Jaegers (Robots). And colorful luminescence coming from the Kaiju (Monsters). I completely recommend as buy the 4k first or Planet Earth 2 as it was shot in Imax and is also in 1.85:1.

Well, for a giant monster movie. Anyone going into this expecting Oscar performances has got to re-align themselves. It's a sci-fi monster movie for pete's sake. But, surprisingly, the actors do an amazing job portraying real human relationships, conflict, and challenges. Even after watching this multiple times, it still draws some tears and cheers from me at certain points.

Honestly, I don't know how they could have done the genre better. This is my epitome of the Kaiju genre. if you like those types of movies, This is definitely a good watch. If you like sci-fi and action (with believable plot), this is a good watch. If you like Mech's, this is a good watch. IMO you can't go wrong with this movie.",1499212800,2,948,4.774390243902439

Pacific Rim has definitely won the wow factor when it comes to movies shot with 3d capabilities.  Not only is the movie entertaining and cool, but the 3d on this specific movie just rocks.  It has a lot of depth to the 3d and the colors pop.  The film itself is one that we really enjoy.  I'm a fan of Jurassic Park, Godzilla, King Kong and basically disaster movies or movies that involve really large and impossible monsters.

So this story has many flaws but it has many action sequences that are so well done in how they are delivered for the audience, Showing respect and the human relationships in the story with conflict and the effects on attempting to make the world a better place while failing constantly in the process. The reason this story is beautiful is because of the amount of detail in the action sequences. The focus and ability to show how the body and trauma deal with each while using robots the same way Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone and Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance express the human drama but mainly through animation.

5385700,3,B00A6UHC0U,"This is honestly the first Guillermo del Toro movie I've liked.  It is full of imaginative visuals and the CGI is a cut above even what I saw in, say, Batman vs. Superman.  The movie is long as it needs to include both the action and the relationship scenes.  Fortunately, most of the relationship scenes come in the middle so it moves quickly at the beginning and end and drags a bit in the middle.  They finally got Charlie Hunnam to scrape the Foreign DNA Cather off his face and he makes a handsome lead hero.  Idris Elba shows how a great actor can take even the most cliche of parts and make them interesting.  Good work by the woman who was in that movie about the Japanese girl who is obsessed with ""Fargo"" and the British actor from ""Torchwood"".  There's still something about knowing that most of the movie was drawn with a computer program that makes -- for me -- almost all CGI emotionally uncompelling.  There's none of the skill that the early films that used models and special cameras had (Blade Runner, Star Wars) nor the breathtaking skill shown by hand animation.  At least they didn't set it up for a sequel...although given the dearth of creativity in Hollywood, they'll find some way to squeeze more money out the ""franchise"" by creating ""new product"".",1489795200,,1274,4.577092511013216

Charlie Day from ""Always Sunny in Philedelphia"" brought the laughs, and having Ron Perlman In the movie just made this film even more enjoyable. The acting was very decent, and you actually CARE FOR the characters unlike a lot of movies that are in this type of genre.

Some action movies these days are so jittery that my I can't really absorb the action much it's sort of a blur. This movie is funny, comic bookish and lush",1479340800,2,627,4.225

I love this movie because it lets me, as an adult, revisit some of those great feelings of nostalgia. Pacific Rim was clearly a work of love, as evidenced by the great care taken and attention to detail paid. I like that we get to see great Giant Robot fighting action. I like that the main characters are relatable and empathetic. I like that there wasn't a forced romance sub-plot. Sure, some of the dialogue was pretty corny, and some of the story beats are a little predictable, but overall this is a great joy to watch for anybody who grew up with Giant Robots.",1478563200,,672,4.56198347107438

Despite being upscaled from a 2K master. The details are extremely good and night battle really shows on the dramatic contrast ratio. The brights are so bright that you almost have to avert your eyes while the dark retains lots of details instead of being crushed.

5386228,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I'ma get this out of the way: The movie is ridiculous. The plot is predictable and full of brainless tropes, some of the acting is mediocre and the science fiction is actually quite bad. If you can move past those things or if they don't bother you while you're watching it's insane fun.

Obviously fans of giant monster movies or mecha anime will find many of their sweet spots struck by the theme, but there's something different about getting it in live action from special effects wizards. I don't think we've ever seen sets and costumes like these actually made and populated with real people, certainly not this competently. The practical effects are fantastic and the action is legitimately thrilling. The monsters are horrifying, and the giant robot pace of the action gives your eyes all the time they need achieve maximum bulge as the Kaiju just brutalize the heroes and their surroundings. Because the monsters are so grotesque watching the heroes desperately brawl with them is harrowing.

I'm not kidding. You'd think that because the movie has real flaws I couldn't honestly give it five stars without exaggerating. I'm a geek and I can get snooty at the writers over some of the plot conveniences or their confusion about how nuclear reactors work, but those things just don't make a difference against the jubilation of watching a titanic humanoid robot cold clock one of Del Toro's nightmare creatures. It is delightful and whatever the balance is on perks versus flaws this movie stuck with me as a fantastically good time, even over films that I'd have a harder time criticizing.

And the music is wonderful. Start nodding your head to the hero's theme when you first see the pilots man the con. Feel the dread when the horns kick in as the monsters destroy them.",1469145600,,1782,4.816993464052287

The premise is enormous godzilla-esque monsters called Kaigu are teleporting into our world through a dimensional rift in the Pacific ocean (hence the title).  Of course we humans do the most logical thing and build gigantic robots to fight them off.

Trouble is... they're getting stronger!

The movie is action-packed, and pretty intense, and even though it played like an old Godzilla movie, it didn't come across as cheezy.

It took a while for me to start buying the weird mythology and seeing all these actors play serious while playing around in giant Transformers suits, but about halfway through, it all started to click for me and I realized I was watching the best movie ever. It is so fun and funny. The action takes place on a huge scale, but is grounded so much in the individual characters that it doesn't feel like mindless gigantic destruction. There were so many interesting characters, a strong female lead. It was just so cool. My husband came in halfway through and I made him start over and watch from the beginning. We both loved it. I thought the acting was really good, the story was surprisingly good, the effects were realistic and awesome. I love it. Should we just watch it again real quick?",1463529600,,943,4.425287356321839

5386486,5,B00A6UHC0U,"You can really tell this film was heavily influenced by the anime's Evengalion and Rahxephon.  I never really had the patience for how anime's are usually paced in overly long drawn-out story-telling and character development, and I give up watching a few episodes in, even though I like the original concept.  So watching this movie was a nice surprise and certainly gave me a  condensed piece of what I couldn't keep watching in any of the typical anime's that are similar in story and scope.  Acting was a little weak in certain parts, but nothing where it took anything away from the over-all movie.  Special affects were gorgeous and the action sequences were really well done.

I like big giant robot cartoons, and I believe the longest running show in the world is an anime about mecha; but I wasn't sure how an American mecha kaiju movie would turn out.

Well, I have to say, the movie is filled with great action scenes, a somewhat unlikely hero duo (though not unpredictable). I love it when I can root for the protagonist and feel great about it. It is not simply an action film though, and because the story is slightly complex, I think del Toro might be justified in a sequel. Or rather, please make a sequel.

This flick had some great action scenes but nothing else. It actually started out like a spoof of several older movies but it looked like someone caught on to where it was headed and tried to change direction. The best part was actually the over-the-top Ron Perlman and the worst was listening to Charlie Day screaming like he does in Its Always Sunday in Philadelphia and that sound is enough to limit how many of those shows you can take in one sitting. If you like Transformers thats what youll get here but when the humans are in the picture its a hard watch and even Charlie sounds exactly like his character from Sons.

  If you want a movie that you can just sit down and enjoy without having to think about it too much, then this action-packed, visually stunning, aurally pleasing, fun-filled science fiction flick is just what the doctor ordered! GIANT alien monsters, who come to our world through a GIANT inter-dimensional hole in the floor of the ocean, to fight with GIANT mind-linked robots equals GIANT fun for you and me! Guillermo del Toro does it again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions of the movie's plot.

VIDEO:  1.78:1  Color  1080p  MPEG4 AVC (23.5 Mbps)

  The picture quality presented on this blu-ray is very nearly the best that you will see from the format! Overall, the images are sharp  with very good shadow detail, and possess a muted color-palette that works very well with the tone of the source material. Fine detail is evident in many of the close-ups of faces, hair-styles and machines  without any apparent edge-enhancement. Also, there are no specks, white dots or color fluctuations to mar the image. Nor, are there any of the wax-like featureless faces that usually denote excessive dynamic noise reduction (DNR). The only thing that prevents this presentation from being a 5.0 is a slight softness and the absence of very-fine detail in many scenes (which probably could be resolved with a higher bit-rate from the disc). Or, this softness and lack of very-fine detail may be a conscious choice on the part of the filmmakers, in which case, a 5.0 rating would be well deserved.

AUDIO:  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and 7.1 (Both 48 KHz, 24-bit)

  The sound quality and mix of the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack (the only one to which I listened) is DEFINITELY reference quality. If you want it, this soundtrack has it: very deep bass in ALL channels, very active and highly directional sounds in ALL surround channels, clear well-placed dialog, ambient sounds that effectively convey the location of the on-screen setting, well recorded music and much, much more! And, all of this is NOT just available in certain scenes, but it is located throughout the ENTIRE movie in loud, quiet and everything between scenes! This is a tour de force effort in sound design, and is therefore HIGHLY recommended! Heck, even if you don't like this movie buy it just to show off your surround-sound system to your friends and family.

  NOTE: The 7.1 soundtrack is NOT the default soundtrack for this disc  therefore, if you have a system that supports 7.1 audio, be sure to go to the 'Audio' entry of the 'Setup' menu and select the 7.1 version of the soundtrack BEFORE you start watching the movie.

5386738,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I begin writing this review with a pit in my stomach knowing that I am about
to show a bit of disappointment towards a film that many Amazon readers
having been speaking quite highly of. While I realize Pacific Rim was one of the
most popular box-office films of the year, I can't help but feel that its success was
based on the legion of young viewers who packed theaters, satisfying their yearn
for CGI-laden mindless entertainment.  Not that it's a bad thing -- for it's exactly
what what director Guillermo del Toro intended and delivers for the film's entire
133 minute running length.

Yet, oddly, sitting through this noisy and complicated film, I couldn't help but be
mesmerized by the visual overload of high-tech eye candy, beautifully enhanced
by some of the best 3D I have seen to date.  Popcorn flicks don't get any bigger
than this.

At its heart, Pacific Rim is a nod to the popular Japanese monster movies of the
1960s.  The monsters of this film are the ""Kaiju,"" enormous creatures who have come
through a dimensional rift at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Their aim is to colonize
Earth and claim it their own. With the end of the world clearly upon mankind, the only
means of combatting the invasion is with the use of Jaegers, colossal robots that are
manned by two human pilots who share a neuro bridge (known as a ""drift"").  The heroes
of our story, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and a Japanese woman named Mako
(Rinko Kikuchi) are the last best qualified Jaeger pilots to take on the Kaiju.  However,
both have enough emotional baggage that make for a dangerous neural drift.  Can these
pilots overcome their inner fears, combine forces and save mankind?  Do I really need
to answer that question?

Watching this film on the home screen you can immediately tell that it was shot entirely
within the digital realm.  Though it retains a video quality look, it's a flawless presentation
that offers the ultimate clarity and detail without a hint of background grain or noise.  Colors
are neon-rich and vibrant while offering concrete black levels.

What I was amazed to find, after my viewing this afternoon, is that Guillermo del Toro
never intended Pacific Rim to be a 3D film.  It was actually Warner Bros. who decided
to upconvert the film months after its production. I mention that I was amazed simply
because it was difficult for me to tell whether this was shot natively in 3D or not. This
is certainly one of the most outstanding upconversions I have ever seen which is obviously
attributed towards the studio putting 50 long weeks of effort into making sure it was done
correctly.  The level of depth that is conveyed in this film is enormous and seemingly infinite.
I don't think I have ever quite seen this level of depth used before in a film of this kind. Cities
and their skyscrapers look massive in scope.  There's a moment in the middle of the film
where a Kaigu and Jaeger are battling each other in the middle of Tokyo, as a tiny helicopter
comes into view.  The perspective in size difference is just amazing to see.  Ghosting is
only mildly evident in a few shots, but overall, mostly unnoticeable.

What audiences will really enjoy is the level of added element effects that really stand
out in 3D. Falling snow, pounding rain and flying debris are constantly thrown to the front
of the viewing area.  Despite this being a conversion, there are many times that those
elements seem as if they are happening outside and in front of the viewing window.  All
of this looks pretty spectacular at times.  I would go on record to say that this post
conversion just about rivals the work that was recently accomplished on Titanic.  This
is one conversion that is demo worthy for showing off to your family and friends. Hopefully
this will be the Blu-ray that puts all the upconversion haters to rest.

I rated this film a perfect ""5"" across the board just for pure 3D entertainment value.  That
really says something remarkable about the work that went into this upconversion.

The film's 7.1 DTS-MA soundtrack (downconverted to 5.1 on my system) is equally
satisfying as well.  I can only describe the experience as overly noisy, yet all its sonics
are perfectly distributed across the individual channels with none of the dialogue getting
drowned out.  The rear channels come heavily into play providing all the backdrop to
the constant level of chaos that exists on the screen:  the roar of jet fighters, helicopters
flying overhead and debris flying from all directions.  LFE activity is completely off the
charts as it accents every footprint of the colossal creatures -- not to mention the destruction
in their wake.  It's pounding and roaring at the silliest levels that will have every speaker
in your room bursting with mind-blowing sonics.

Pacific Rim arrives as a 4-Disc set (Blu-ray 3D, 2D Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD Ultraviolet,
Special Features DVD) in a lenticular cardboard sleeving.  All discs are double-stacked upon
another. There seems to be a good handful of extras that include audio commentary by
Guillermo del Toro, a directors notebook, deleted scenes and a blooper reel.  Additionally,
you'll find features on the digital artistry of the film, Drift Space and The Shatterdome.

Make no mistake about it, Pacific Rim breaks many new visual barriers for science
fiction/fantasy film.  It's gigantically enormous in scale and seamlessly combines
green-screen and CGI and live action. Despite my lack of tolerance for these kind
of films, I must admit, once I got past the bad acting, persistent cliches, and the feeling
that I was watching one big video game -- I actually thought this was one of the best
popcorn films ever made.  I also feel this ranks as the best unconverted film since
Titanic , making it an ever-so-perfect 3D home experience that is demo worthy.

If mindless entertainment is your thing, this is one 3D Blu-ray that should be at the
top of your list.",1453075200,,5936,4.78900883218842

That may not seem to be  a meaningless comment, but fact is, monster movies generally lose their punch once the audience has seen the monster (the film Alien being the exception). So each time a new monster rears its head, it's all new. But really, movies do not compel unless the characters are interesting and well done. This is such a film! Idris Elba turns in a dynamic, commanding performance; Charlie Hunnam does a great job as the embattled hero; and Rinko Kikuchi holds the camera prisoner with her presence. As a trio, they establish a firm, ever-changing relationship. Secondary roles are all unique, quirky, and entertaining. This film seems very close to del Toro's heart, and his delight is catching, as humanity makes its final stand against apparently overwhelming forces.",1445990400,2,880,4.98639455782313

5386831,4,B00A6UHC0U,"""Giant robots punching giant monsters."" - Honest Trailers.

Pacific Rim's core concept (see quote above) was great enough to me to largely mask the cheesy characters, gaping plot-holes, and lackluster plot - it kind of depends on what you like/take guilty pleasure in. The Jaegers (giant robots), the Kaiju (giant monsters), and the fights are unique and well-done.

My only big complaint about the execution of Pacific Rim's core concept is the lack of time given to the Jaegers Cherno Alpha, and Crimson Typhoon. The film actually takes the time to build up those two Jaegers and their pilots, only to pretty much insta-gibb them in the first fight of the main plot. Two heavily experienced and proven Jaegers/pilots taken out in minutes while the rookie team manages to take down two Kaiju relatively unharmed/undamaged? Really?

I get the film was going for the ""last days/final stand"" vibe, but it would have been better to kill them off at the final fight if at all - multiple Jaegers & Kaiju fighting in a massive melee. It would have been time well spent as opposed to all the time given to the geeky-as-hell scientists.

In end, Pacific Rim is great if you're good with its main premise, and is worth at least a rent.",1445731200,,1226,4.741784037558685

CGI effects are great and del Toro shows he is a top rate director. The plot is a little hamfisted, but you can think of it like Top Gun but with giant robots.

5386873,5,B00A6UHC0U,"If you do not enjoy Japanese giant monsters and anime robots, this is not the film for you; but if you do enjoy that sort of thing, you're in for a real treat.  Director Guillermo Del Toro is really in his element here!

""Pacific Rim"" is wall-to-wall, non-stop fun with excellent acting and production values.  The plot is as simple as can be; incredibly nasty (and completely implausible, scientifically impossible) aliens invade and humans respond by inventing incredibly powerful (and unlikely) machines.  Although the human's machines are armed with guns, missiles, and plasma cannons, all the battles are essentially hand-to-hand combat between gigantic samurai.  None of that silliness matters and in fact it might be part of the fun; this is a comic-book fantasy and it is relentless in its delivery of the genre.

The leading actors all deliver convincingly sensitive performances, and Ron Pearlman is priceless as the reprobate dealing in illicit monster parts.  The CGI work is excellent, though quite cartoonish as befits the genre.

Hint:  Keep watching after the credit crawl begins.  There's a bit more waiting for you.

Some fun background:  You might be aware that Guillermo Del Toro was originally hired by Peter Jackson to direct the Hobbit films, and in fact Del Toro is credited as one of the writers of those films.  After two years of waiting for a go-ahead on those films with no assurance that they would ever see the green light from Hollywood, he gave up on went home to work on his own projects (which led to Jackson eventually picking up the wand and directing those films).

This is Del Toro's first major film after The Hobbit, and really his first big-budget production.  (In the interim had had written a couple of novels and launched Mirada Studios.)  We can only speculate how different things would have been if the Hollywood companies had been able to settle their copyright and bankruptcy problems faster so that Del Toro could have directed the Hobbit movies, but I suspect that we would have seen a lot more emphasis on action and less on character development and performance, to the detriment of both the Hobbit and the Pacific Rim stories.",1443052800,,2181,4.918032786885246

In this case, it's robots punching giant monsters.  The acting was good, and it's a pretty good indicator of the quality of negative reviews when you have to revert to insulting people who might like something you don't because of your Hansen-style Daddy Issues.
It's a vivid, exciting movie where they promise no more than explosive action sequences and cigar-chomping style dialogue, and you get it.
The use of cinematography and effects are unparalleled and there's just enough character depth without trying to make it a Merchant and Ivory film with giant robots.  Because it's about fkn giant robots.

5386930,2,B00A6UHC0U,"First time in a while that del Toro has disappointed me. And even his informative and generous commentary can't make up for it. It's sad to be so dissatisfied with what should be a dream come true for a monster fan since childhood like myself. The effects, especially the first kaiju battle at sea, are outstanding. however, it all felt like I'd seen it before in other movies over the past ten years. There's more finesse here, to be sure, but, not a lot of true wow. And I'm not easily jaded. It just felt like a waste of actors, both talented and not so talented. The humor was so incredibly forced, cringe-inducingly so with the two science geek characters, as was the ""heart and soul"" of the human character arcs. This is what truly baffled me, b/c, heck, this is the director who made HELLBOY more naturally human than nearly any other cinema superhero up 'til that point. A lot of grunting macho posturing (and almost no sense of humor about that) and a female protagonist who, despite having some high-profile heroic moments, spends way too much time peeking at her shirtless comrade through peepholes in doors. Is this how we need to reassure viewers that a character isn't asexual? Yuck! Miles better than the most recent GODZILLA but I just felt distracted by how much money was spent making this thing and how it left very little lasting impression on me at all. Another first for a del Toro film. I'll say this, though, the little girl who played Mako as a child was superb. She out-acted everyone else (including the overrated Idris Elba) and did so with a NATURAL performance. considering she had to do most of this to a green screen, that's impressive.",1440374400,,1668,4.619528619528619

The movie flirts with a romance that should never happen but the elude to it at the end.  Even the action is bad.  Slow plodding robots versus fast powerful aliens makes forr a bad combination.

5387058,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Godzilla had dinosaurs but no robots.  Transformers had robots but no dinosaurs.  This movie has both robots and dinosaurs!  And not just any mechanical type robots, but super huge robots that are actually built by humans and take two or even three mind melded human pilots within them to operate!

And not just any dinosaurs, but continually evolving dinosaurs that emerge from a trans-dimensional vortex in the ocean  floor off the coast of Hong Kong from a secret under-the-ocean-floor dinosaur base where the original dinosaurs -- who were really aliens -- retreated to after their first attempt to take over the Earth -- millions of years ago -- didn't work.  They've been stewing down their for ages learning to modify their own DNA to produce ever bigger, uglier, and more sophisticated dinosaurs to let loose in their latest attempt to take over the world.  And now they're called ""kaiju"" which sounds Japanese so it's way cooler.

And at least one of these dinosaurs either walked on the ocean floor or swam half way around the world just to destroy San Francisco.  What is it with San Francisco?  Godzilla destroyed San Francisco in 2014.  San Francisco was destroyed in San Andreas in 2015.  But Pacific Rim sent a kaiju there in 2013, so Pacific Rim got there first!  And, there are many other cities that get destroyed by the kaiju too.  City destruction fans will not be disappointed.

But there's more.  There's also a secret human base where the last of the ""jaegers"" -- which is a way cooler way to say ""robots"" -- are continually manned and maintained even though their funding has been cut off, which makes perfect sense because they're the only really effective defense humanity has against the kaijus.

At this base you'll meet a tough, pretty, and endearing Asian girl; a leader who is very much like Nick Fury only without the eye patch; and not one but two wacky fun mad scientists who actually end up making a vital contribution to defeating the kaijus.  Top this off with a macho young soldier with daddy issues (it even says in the movie) and a daddy soldier who is too macho to ever say anything kind to his son, and you've got a movie with everything!!

Seriously, if you liked the Godzilla mess from 2014 you should love Pacific Rim.  And  if you didn't like  Godzilla, you may be pleasantly surprised by this movie.",1435104000,18,2346,4.712530712530713

Kaiju: Japanese word basically meaning ""giant monster"".

Jaeger: German word for ""hunter"".

Kaiju's rise out of the Pacific Rim fault lines under the ocean, and move to populated areas and wreak havoc.

Jaegers are built by men to fight the Kaiju. Because of the severe neural trauma, two pilots are required to control the Jaegars. ""Drifting"" together is not simple or easy, so trained, compatible pilots are rare.

In the seventh year of the Kaiju War, the last four remaining Jaegers are stationed just off the Rim. The cast includes the crews and pilots of the Jaegers as they work to stop the increasingly powerful Kaiju emerging from the ocean and try to solve the mystery behind their origin.",1435017600,,820,5.0

destroyed ? ....well, I haven't got an answer, however seems to me
it occurs during just about every disaster movie....and yes, if but
briefly 'Pacific Rim' joins that ''elite'' club.
The Film....Over-sized alien beings 'The Kaijus' begin to arrive on
earth arriving through a porthole below the waves of the 'Pacific'
Five major cities are destroyed before the military are able to combat
the new enemy.
The invasion continues, man has to come up with a monster of their own
....Giant Robots called 'Jaegers' controlled to do battle by two pilots
on board.
However, it seems this may not be enough to stop the 'Kaijus' coming,
the 'Jaegers' program seems too be failing, the world is on the verge
of defeat.
A former pilot is teamed up with an unlikely co-pilot to operate an
outdated 'Jaeger' to do battle.
This may well be man's last stand ahead of an ''almost'' certain alien
victory bringing about the end of human existence.
The visual effects which are indeed impressive make the movie well worth
watching,
The 2D and 3D imagery will almost certainly keep the film alive for viewing

5387069,2,B00A6UHC0U,"Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim is a slow and boring monster movie.  Maybe the fact that we live in a post 9/11 world and have seen cities be destroyed countless times over and over again in recent movies such as Transformers.  I feel like the shine has come off these types of films.  I thought it was kind of stupid having a large robot the size of a skyscraper being run by two individuals who sync minds instead of just one driver.  The film takes itself way to seriously at times and has clichs throughout the film.  The film reminded me of Robot Jox of the late 1990's which was campy cheesy and fun, although that film was not great it was a decent popcorn movie.  This film has none of that going for it.  It seems like the movie is half an hour to long and could have used a lot of editing.  The idea that the humans would build some massive sea wall to keep the monsters out seemed ludicrous to me as if history has taught us nothing with the Berlin Wall and the Great Wall of China both failing over time.

Everyone will instantly think of Godzilla when watching this film since it leans heavily on the giant monster movie platform.  Some of the old Godzilla movies were cheesy but interesting at the same time. Although this film might have been inspired by those films it holds none of the charm.  Even the monsters in this movie seem dull and unimaginative.  I was thinking of the ""Avengers"" movie while watching this film and thinking how much better that film's big monsters were done compared to this one.  This movie had a lot of hype and promotion behind it and reviews were mixed and after watching it you can see why.  Its not out and out terrible but it is hardly worth watching again.  About 3/4 the way through when Idris Elba is giving his speech I was thinking is it ever going to end.  The acting at times is downright dreadful.

The film sucks and is not worth your time.  I would probably give it 1 1/2 stars if I could.  Save your money and time for a better film.",1434499200,,1995,4.286096256684492

The acting may not be top notch, but neither is it a hindrance. The sets and cinemaphotography are excellent. Special effects are good but not the best. That having been noted though, the story line is so strong that the film does not rest on effects alone. The story moves itself along. If you are not a SciFi fan (as I am), expect a 6.

5387097,4,B00A6UHC0U,"BOTTOM LINE: No, PACIFIC RIM isn't a perfect film, but it sure is tons of old school-styled monster mashing fun! It can be had now used on Amazon for cheap, so there's no reason not to own a copy if you love big robots and/or giant monsters. PACIFIC RIM has quickly become one of my favorite guilty pleasure flicks, no doubt about it. 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): In the near future, gigantic monsters (""kaiju"") begin appearing through a mysterious rip/breech in space, at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. World governments put aside their differences and work together to construct massive robots (""jaegers"") to combat the freaky beasties toe-to-toe. The creatures begin to be defeated and things level out for a time, until larger and even more powerful kaiju arrive and the out-muscled jaegers start losing. Panicky politicians choose to funnel war chest resources towards the erection of huge walls in an effort to fence off the kaiju. The Jaeger Program will be scrapped once the walls are completed. The military leader of the jaegers and two unconventional scientists theorize that a nuclear device detonated midway along the dimensional breech connecting the kaiju world with ours could effectively collapse it. The four remaining Jaegers are transported to a base in China and plans are made to spearhead one final assault on the portal and seal it forever. But their greatest challenge yet awaits the jaegers & their courageous pilots, as three kaiju arrive simultaneously to stand guard at the edge of the breech, determined to crush the last of the jaegers and wipe out mankind.

THOUGHTS: Yes, this motion picture is basically a live-action version of several interchangeable Japanese mech-anime toons. The story is rather simple-minded, the script is littered with corny dialog and the majority of the film is focused almost entirely on mega monster vs. titanic robot battles, at the expense of reducing the human characters to one-dimensional caricatures. But so what?!? This movie is enormous fun!!! If you love those classic kaiju collisions from Toho studios or cherish the mythical stop-motion monsters created by effects maestro Ray Harryhausen then this modern homage should really float your boat. It's lightweight popcorn entertainment that doesn't ask you to think too much, just sit back and watch huge robots punch the crap out of giant slimy monsters! It's a film for the 8-year old in all of us. The CGI is impressive, giving the Jaegers & kaiju a wonderful look that is both classic, yet hyper-realistic at the same time. The brutal battles evoke the grand days of Godzilla grappling with MechaGodzilla, Johnny Sokko's mechanical pal Giant Robot punching out the bizarre beasts from Planet Gargoyle, and the legion of anime robots from the 70's, 80's & 90's (Mazinger, Gaiking, Raydeen and Voltron, among others). If the names in that last sentence didn't stir any memories then you might not find much to rejoice about with this film, and that's fine. PACIFIC RIM isn't for everybody. Sure, I could nitpick the film, too, but I'm honestly just amazed & delighted that it even got made. It's so cool that Legendary Picture's head honcho, Thomas Tull, also happens to be a huge monster movie geek. Tull's money + super monster-nerd Guillermo Del Toro's crazy imagination = terrific reasons for fans of the good old days of giant monster mashing to shout with joy. If you want to see this same basic plot from the old days then pick up a copy of the Japanese TV show JOHNNY SOKKO AND HIS FLYING ROBOT. The similarities are much too close to be mere coincidence. In fact, 3/4 JOHNNY SOKKO + 1/4 ROBOT JOX = PACIFIC RIM.

THE BLU-RAY: This 3-disc hi-def presentation of PACIFIC RIM is an excellent effort. Picture looks exceptionally sharp and the sound thunders. (Seriously, the mix is level but LOUD!) The set includes both Blu-ray & DVD formats of the film, along with a separate Blu-ray of special features that contains a slew of great behind-the-scenes & ""Making of"" bonus features to up the value.",1433635200,4,4040,4.95575221238938

Sure, rock 'em, sock 'em robots makes for a cute premise, but the sheer stupidity of the plot sinks itself.  The human race is being repeatedly attacked by Godzilla-like creatures one or two at a time from a rift in the ocean.  So naturally, we attack 500ft tall godzillas with fighter planes and air-to-air missiles with 9-20lb warheads which are /marginally/ effective at taking out small fighter jets, but only because they're so fragile (the Independence Day fallacy) -- but only at reaally close range so they can get swatted out of the sky.  Because when you've got an arsenal of heavy-duty range weapons, you need to choose the absolute lightest of them, and get in close where the alien invaders can actually reach and harm you <eyeroll>.  So when those are all used up, humanity spends presumably trillions of dollars and years upon years making - wait for it - a few dozen giant mechs that are primarily used, once again at contact range, to project their drivers' martial arts skills to repeatedly punch said aliens in whatever heavily armored pieces serves as their heads.  Yes, that's right, punch them slowly and widely in the head.  Some innovative mechs even come with plasma cannons and missiles(!) which are quite effective, but inexplicably can't be used from mass-producible shore batteries, or launchers a few hundred to a few thousand miles away.  Needless to say, these wildly ineffective tactics bring all of humanity to the brink of extinction and blah blah blah.  I'm very easy to please movie wise, I'll suspend disbelief in a second, but this was just so conceptually awful, I felt worse for having watched it.",1432598400,,1652,4.89247311827957

It was not the case - in fact, I would have enjoyed seeing the robot soldiers in action even more so - they did such cool fighting maneuvers. I think the previews did a great job of not letting out all the secrets of the movie - I was given a lot surprises - nothing that was earthshaking of course - but sometimes previews give away so much that I don't bother to watch the movies. Charlie is quite a good actor - now that I've seen him several times outside of Sons of Anarchy. For me any Sci-Fi or dystopian futuristic movie - the only thing it needs to make it good are actors that can - and graphics that are not cheesy. This one did very well in both categories.",1431043200,,790,4.103225806451613

The fight scenes are fantastic and like I said the emotional parts are what make you forget you are watching a movie and you feel the character s pain.

5387161,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Insofar as pure adrenaline stoking fun is concerned, this is a tough movie to beat.  The Earth is attacked by these huge monsters that would scare the fire out of Godzilla.  Their initial attacks are eventually repelled, but at great cost.  Their skin is very tough, very difficult to penetrate with tanks, missiles and such.  What works much better is blunt force.

This, of course, leads to a program of huge military robots which are manned by 2 crewmen.  The robots (known as Jaegers) are operated by brainwaves for maximum efficiency in battle, but they're too much to handle for a single human brain.  That's why 2 crewmen are required and their brains are ""synced up"" with the robotic controls.

The story opens with the Jaegers losing the war against the monsters.  As impressive as the Jaegers are (and they are, indeed, impressive!), the monsters keep getting bigger and badder.  The Jaegers are being destroyed faster than they can be replaced.  Uh oh!

Such is the backdrop of the story.  If you like the idea of man & machine teaming up to fight ""fire with fire"" against ruthless monsters, then this is the film for you.  It's certainly the most imaginative monster flick I've seen in awhile.  If you were disappointed in the most recent Godzilla film, then this may be just the ""bounce back"" DVD for you.  After all, with Jaegers, all things are possible!",1430870400,,1369,4.737288135593221

The onething that really irritated me is when they first show the 3 jaegers that are left (minus gipsy) they get this big build up how they are the best of the best. Then when you see these 3 fighting for the first time all you see is them getting beat up? They could have shown more than just gipsy winning fights and showing other jaegers winning fights and showing the capabilities everyone is bragging about them. I wanted to see the big one or the 3 armed one kick more gASS before they got destroyed. Still the acting was pretty good, a good story( i g2 admit i still found myself riffing it like mst3k) the special effects are good. Worth seeing it atleast once.",1429660800,,798,4.326666666666667

The CG is so well done, you will believe what you're seeing is real. I will highly recommend a 5.1 surround sound for these movies because the sound sells the shot. In other words, this isn't a low volume movie. Crank it and you will believe what you're seeing is real. Acting won't win any awards but is done well enough by competent actors.

5387258,2,B00A6UHC0U,"This movie has amazing special effects and fine visuals if you are a fellow science fiction, and action adventure fantasy fan like myself, but it does have it's problems to a certain degree.  The robot Jaugers are pretty cool and it is an interesting fantasy concept that was fairly original, but I still felt as if I were watching a 2010's era version of ""Transformers vs Godzilla"" flick.

  The hero characters are good and strong through out the film, there are some interesting military themed aspects I did enjoy but over all I cannot state at the end of the day that this was an Earth shaking masterpiece of art or film making, which is why I am giving it a mixed review.

 What I felt at the end of the day was I was watching a number of sci fi fantasy themed films or media I have seen before pretty much mixed together.  C+ for ""Pacific Rim""

At least it was light years better then Michael Bay's version of the ""Transformers"".",1427500800,,936,4.401162790697675

The Gypsy Rose just punched the smack out of a kaiju, and sent its ugly transdimentional mug rolling back into the sea with its tail between its legs, and who doesn't want to see some of that?

5387272,2,B00A6UHC0U,"I didn't watch this in theaters when it came out but I had heard a lot of praise that the movie was a great popcorn robot vs monster movie. So when I bought the DVD I was expecting to see a bunch of robots fighting monsters but unfortunately I didn't. Don't get me wrong the beginning grabbed my attention but it's like after it grabs your attention with the action scenes in the beginning it says ""now that we have your attention, please focus on this other plot that is the main plot.""  It focuses more on humans(do people think we watch monster movies for humans?)than the actual robots/monsters. Some of the cool robots just get 30 seconds(or less) of screen time before being tossed aside and continuing the human plot, wth?

Overall I was expecting this to focus on the fighting scenes like people were praising it but it dragged on the human plot. I got bored quickly and stopped paying attention after a while. This movie had the potential to be great with some of the fight scenes but no. Plus the reason monsters were attacking humans just made me shake my head.

Earth is invaded by giant monsters from another dimension. The only way nations of earth are able to fight these city sized monster is to make giant robots.

The story is well done. Deep character life stories. Plenty of titan class fight scenes that don't disappoint. The monster s origin is imaginative and ties in well with real earth history.

Creative mech designs. No one of them is the same. The movie makes them feel very real in scale and weight.

The monster are also well done, rendered as good as the recent godzilla movie.

I know, that sounds like a terribly corny movie, but Del Toro manages to deliver a suspenseful and engaging story without treading into corny territory. Pacific Rim delivers Michael Bay level action without all the other... Bay-isms. Is this one of the best films of all time? No. Is it one of the most fun movies you'll see without feeling like you had to sacrifice IQ points? Yes!

Audio and visuals are top-notch, especially when paired with a home theater system. I love, love, love throwing this movie into my home theater and rattling the walls with the gut-punching bass and the guttural roars of the Kaiju. Every battle scene is a sonic assault that has me gitty with excitement. This is one of my reference films for showcasing my surround system (The Incredible Hulk is great for this too).

5387383,3,B00A6UHC0U,"Almost had it to be a four star movie but couldn't quite deliver the goods.

I really enjoyed the movie but it didn't leave me with goose bumps or anything jaw dropping. However, it had a decent plot with a good cast to pull it off.

The action scenes were pretty well filmed and the story gave you that suspension of disbelief. I didn't feel like was being distracted by anything from the movie or pointing out to myself certain things that I thought would never happen in real life. It's a sci-fi action flick man. The banal story was just good enough to keep me interested all the way through to the end. If your a big nerd like myself who has a fixation on giant robots doing battle with gargantuan monsters then this movie is for you. Yeah, in various parts it can be very campy and certain plot points are just corny but it doesn't over do it where you want to label it a B movie quiet yet. With enough depth in the story and characters the film like the robots wins in the end.

 I will say it was much better than the last three Star Wars films combined. So I recommend this for the family on a boring night with a bowl of popcorn.",1422662400,,1139,4.163636363636364

5387395,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I got Pacific Rim for the past holiday season in 2014 for my dad as a Christmas Present.  For some reason, my dad loves Pacific Rim.  I am still figuring out the reason why, but there is something about this particular movie that resonates with him, and he really enjoys watching it.  There are a couple lines that he likes quoting, so that could be the start of it.  Anyway, needless to say, he was pretty excited to receive this movie as a present, so I was happy with the purchase from there.

As for the movie itself, personally, I think it is good, but not ground breaking in any way, or changing the face of movies for the future.  It's a fun movie to sit back and watch with some popcorn, soda, etc. and just relax to.  It's not something that you want to over-analyze and put through the wringer because you'll only be disappointed, I think, if you were to go that route.

The movie is your standard fare giant monster (or known as Kaiju's) vs. giant robots, something you would find similar to Godzilla movies.  Kaiju's are entering our world through a rift, and two pilots of each Jaeger (the general names of the giant robots) jump into their robots to defend cities, people, and country.  There are some interesting twists here and there based upon the systems that are used in the confines of the movie, but again, it's just a fun movie to sit back and watch.  Visuals are great, I think there is a good amount of color and character to each area that is visited.  Acting is decent, although sometimes I can't really settle on whether the dialog is cheesy, or the actors' accents saying the lines.  It's not that bad, but it's something that you might rolls your eyes to at points.

Overall, should you consider getting it.  It's certainly cheap enough, I think I got it for 7.99 when I got it for the holiday season.  But if you like giant monsters, giant robots fighting giant robots, cool visuals, fun dialog, I'd say give this a shot.  It's cheap enough at least, so that it's not that much to regret if you don't end up enjoying it.",1421971200,5,2050,4.409574468085107

5387406,1,B00A6UHC0U,"This is, unfortunately, one of those Marmite movies; you either love it or hate it. If you're of the generation brought up on Manga/Anime, mech. vs monsters etc. then you'll love this big-budget homage to the genre. If however, like my wife and I, you have an abiding passion for science fiction but know nothing of this film's headline genre, then you're likely to be severely disappointed.

This, in my opinion, ridiculous film can be somewhat cynically summed up as follows:

Oh no! Godzilla and its chums are invading from a cross-dimensional rift in the Pacific Ocean floor. I know, lets build some huge man-shaped robot things that need two people to drive them, then beat up those naughty lizards with a bit of fisty-cuffs. That'll teach `em. Oh yes, we'd better make sure that our splendid robots don't sink when they have to fight in the sea. I suppose we should build an inadequate wall in a few places and make sure everyone shouts all of the time as well. Perhaps we should have a really annoying geeky double-act too, just for good measure.

Terrible acting, laughable script, non-existent plot, repetitive action sequences and shockingly fake accents; there is absolutely nothing to recommend this dross to anyone over the age of puberty. Don't be fooled into the old ""we'll give it a go, it can't be that bad"". It is - unless, of course, you're a die-hard Manga fan, in which case you'll love it!",1421539200,3,1411,4.727642276422764

5387449,5,B00A6UHC0U,"The LA Times calls this film ""Spectacular"" for a good reason. When hordes of alien giant monsters start attacking from the ocean humanity must fight back hard. Using high technology we develop giant robots to fight the giant monsters. The robots require two pilots and were usually too slow to fight the monsters. Now soon to be defeated, humanity must call on a veteran pilot who is retired and a rookie pilot with very little experience. Remember The Shogun Warriors(giant robots fighting giant monsters) comics from Marvel in the 70's? This reminds me a LOT of those. As a matter of fact, this film is pretty much exactly the same thing. Giant, man-made robots with human operators inside fighting giant monsters to protect Earth. Imagine Godzilla fighting giant robots that resemble Master Chief in Halo(famous video game) and you are right on the money. If you are a fan of Godzilla, Gamera, or King Kong movies, this will be a favorite of yours and I guarantee it! AWESOME CGI! Incredible visual spectacle(s)! It is rated PG-13 for violence and nothing else. One thing for all you Sons of Anarchy fans out there(I am a BIG fan of that show!).You will EASILY recognize more than one person starring in this film! The Shogun Warriors from the 1970's comics meets modern CGI/special effects. 'Nuff said. Excelsior!",1420416000,7,1317,4.883928571428571

But had I purchased this set at the current asking prices, I would have felt slighted.

The packaging sucks.  The ""Collector's Edition"" case is ugly and cheap--taking up far too much space for such an uninspired and unpresentable mold of plastic.  And most annoying of all, is how the discs are stored:  Stacked one on top of the other, like a spindle of blank CDs.

First and foremost, the audio quality on this movie is excellent, well balanced and good quality. Most action/sci-fi movies seem to be more visually intensive and rather underwhelming in the audio department. This one is no slouch. I have a higher end custom 5 channel sound system and the only movies that have impressed me in the audio department are the newer Tron and this, and I have an extensive collection. Video quality is solid throughout, viewed on 60"" 1080p through a Playstation 3. The movie is entertaining as well.

5387558,5,B00A6UHC0U,"This movie is not for everyone. I'm a fan of Japanese Mecha, as well as giant monsters in general. I'm not really into the old Kaiju movies but I can't really explain why since I'm no stranger to cheesy special effects; maybe it's just lack of exposure.

Anyway, I thought this movie was a great adaptation into live action - the special effects were awesome and the fights were exciting. Also, I have to say that the actors and story were really not bad at all. Somewhat predictable, but compared to this year's Godzilla (minus the amazing Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe), much more enjoyable as to the human part of the story.

As with all movies of this sort, it is going to require suspension of disbelief. Anyone who says otherwise is lying. I did have a few moments of 'no... they can't possibly have survived THAT', but I blame Mythbusters as much as the film makers for that; before I watched that show I wouldn't have questioned a lot of things about physics in movies. It's ok though, I still enjoyed this and I'm looking forward to the sequel I heard was in the works. I missed this in the theater the first time around because I lived in a small town, but I hope to see the next one that way. Despite seeing it at home, a Samsung flat screen and Blu-ray copy of the movie was probably almost as good.",1417564800,5,1313,4.377049180327869

5387570,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Do you know what makes, ""Pacific Rim"", so great?  Not the special effects, not the Kaijus or the Jaegers-not any of that.  This movie is about two things that everyone can relate to-loss and redemption.  Quite literally, everybody in this movie is dealing with a loss of some sort, be it family, friends or a cherished way of life, and it seems that the lead characters are seeking to be redeemed, and that redemption is found not just in the monstrous Jaegers, but in the character of the protagonists themselves.

5387573,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I was worried that this would come off like a Godzilla vs. (enter monster name here) with giant things smashing buildings for no apparent reason while tanks and missiles prove completely ineffective. This movie was different. It has a good back story that is woven into the plot in the opening scenes, and develops from there. It is far more human than the Godzilla movies.

The Kaiju (monsters) are very original and pretty well done. Of course, they sometimes look like guys in rubber suits, but after all, they are inspired by Godzilla kaijus.

The Jaeger (giant robots) are impressive, if not physically impossible, but they carry on the spirit of the Voltron and other Japanese giant robot fantasies. It was a clever concept to come up with them needing two pilots who are mentally blended to work.

The plot was WAY beyond anything in the old Godzilla line. The kaiju monsters have a slight intelligence, and they have a definite goal. And, ironically, they are actually organic giant robots themselves. The way the movie explains all this is quite good.

Actions scenes are excellent, though a bit dark. It seems to either be perpetual night or always raining. That makes it easier to hide any flaws in the action, I suppose.

This isn't a very thought provoking film, it is all about action and fighting and has a very juvenile appeal. But that's what makes it fun. And somehow, they managed to fill the screen with giant monsters and giant robots and NOT make it a cliche or as boring as the old Godzilla flicks.

Worth a look, just for fun.",1417046400,3,1550,4.680147058823529

There is some great science fiction hidden within this popcorn movie but it isn't really explored, still that glimpses get my brain clicking, which is what good sci-fi should do. I hope that in further sequels the repercussions of two people 'drifting' together can do to a relationship. But I'll take smashing monsters, too.

Hollywood today is too preachy. I'm sure there's some wacko out there that thinks the movie is a metaphor for immigration reform. Where instead of fencing off the border, we need to build a giant robot to punch Mexicans or something, but it isn't.

It's a movie about fighting monsters with robots. If you don't think that's awesome? Go back to cultural sensitivity class.",1414368000,,545,4.9021739130434785

This is a kids movie and I'm sure kids will enjoy it but for me it was way over the top even for SciFi which I love.  I only give it a couple of stars for special effects and CGI but as for the overall idea, well you pays your money and you takes your chance.  The acting wasn't bad, they tried to save it but you can only do so much with a script like this.. If your into the Japanese monster flicks you'll love this, otherwise, if I had to do it again I'd pass.",1414281600,,525,3.7981651376146788
5387668,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Typically I watch SCI-FI for enjoyment instead those rare clips like War of the Worlds, Enders Game and A Space Odyssey with a few more. Pacific Rim is right in there dealing with Humanity at both it's weakest and ultimately Humanity at it's finest.
There are Aliens who have been within and under the sea floor and how Earth's inability to defend itself. The human link comes into play early dealing with the emotional bond that only a few can accomplish with the pairing of Raleigh and his brother Yancy. Sadly though Yancy gets killed while fighting an Alien and Raliegh emotionally feels that another bond as close as it was can never reach the crescendo needed to respond and meld with another to achieve that intimate, bold and daring Humanistic space which happens perhaps once or twice in someone's life.
The ability of Pacific Rim to deal with our Humanity along with the closeness and joy as well as our own private failures that shines through making Pacific Rim a top notch film. There is the blazing shoot em up scenes which are just flat out terrific. Then Pacific Rim deals with the inner makings of a couple of reseach science techies and shows us a bit of laughter and gives the film an uplifting which works wnderfully well.
With all of this being said watching Pacific Rim is a must and it has turned out to be a great sleeper film. You get grand scenes with rich technical backdrops, some fun and laughter out of research guys along with some surprises along the way which is woven into the film. Last but not least Pacific Rim deals with our Humanness towards oursleves and those around us, making for some terrfic twists and turns and just when I ""got"" where this film is taking me it takes another turn building up around me. This is a must see film!",1414281600,,1773,4.54375

anything other than a fantasy action movie, it's very entertaining and loaded with effects eye candy.

Another Hollywood movie gleefully ignores the laws of physics, with giant robots, hundreds of feet tall, and weighing
thousands of tons, leaping through the air with ease and able to move with great speed and agility under water.

It borrows a few ideas from Aliens, and the plot is rather silly, but if you can turn off the rational, logical part of your
brain and forget about reality, you will enjoy yourself.
There are plenty of interesting, eccentric, querky charactors, giant monsters and robots fighting and ripping down
the local city realestate, tight editing, thundering sound effects, elaborate sets, and atmosphere to keep you interested
from start to finish, complete with the standard Hollywood formulaic ending.

5387751,3,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim is a 2013 American science fiction monster film directed by Guillermo del Toro, and starring Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman. The screenplay is credited to Travis Beacham and del Toro but includes contributions from Marcus Dunstan, Patrick Melton, and Drew Pearce, with the story credited to Beacham.

The film is set in the 2020s, when Earth is at war with the Kaijus, colossal monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers,gigantic humanoid mecha, each controlled by at least two pilots, whose minds are joined by a neural bridge. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaijus.

Principal photography began on November 14, 2011 in Toronto and lasted through April 2012. The film was produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was released on July 12, 2013 including releases in 3-D and IMAX 3D, receiving generally positive reviews; the visual effects and action sequences were highly praised. While the film performed poorly at the United States box office, it was highly successful in other territories, It earned a worldwide total of more than $411 million, including $114 million in China, its largest market. A sequel was announced in 2014, and is scheduled to be released by Universal Pictures on April 7, 2017.

The plot in this Film does a good job displaying the Setting and world this Film takes place in,the lead Protagonist Raleigh(Charlie Hunnam) is seen as washed up and without much hope,while a Jaeger Commander named stacker(Idris Elba) is more ambitious,the contrast makes for a decent opener for the Film. The characters in this Film have both inner and outer conflicts to resolve making for some interesting moments. Their are science elements in this film,but they seldom are a major focus here,but when the Film presents these elements it is not difficult to understand and not very intriguing either. The ending was fairly solid and probably the best portion of the Film,however it was not as dramatic as it was trying to be,i could not care for the characters in this portion as much as i wanted to.

Charlie Hunnam is just not that impressive in this Film,but he is also no that bad and Idris Elba does a pretty good job with the moderate time he is allotted. Rinko Kikuchi has the most memorable performance in this Film.

The lead character Raleigh develops well in this film,but i feel like the burgeoning relationship with mako(co-star of the Film) did not have enough time to really reach its potential for being deeper,but it is not that bad overall. The character Stacker the commanding officer is done very well,he is easily the most believable character of the bunch.

I feel like the themes of this Film are its strongest points. This tale about camaraderie,progression and overcoming are the strongest points of the Film.

This Film is almost a break through for its genre. Until this Film came around we not had a major big Screen release depicting  giant Pilot-assisted Robots since the first Power Rangers Film,i  personally would prefer seeing a Film with these Robots Fighting other Pilot-assited robots,because Power Rangers kind of already showed us a lot of whats seen here only with lesser scope. Overall the Mecha Designs are decent,but nowhere near as Fun to look at as many Anime Mechas,but the kaijus look great and the battles between the two are visually stunning,but would have been so much better if the two could fight faster and fly. Visuals are still top notch here.

The Music in the Film is not irritating but it is instantly forgettable here.

So in short Pacific Rim is a very good movie,i think those who are new to the Mecha Genre will enjoy this Film more,because Anime like Gundam and Evangelion out perform this Movie in many ways,which was a pivotal aspect for me to consider when deciding to watch this Film,it just left a lot for me to desire,but the Story and characters are good.the visuals are great here and i acually can not wait for the sequel to come around,i just hope it fills my expectations in the innovation category.",1411689600,,4389,4.909581646423752

But what's really lacking in this monster vs power ranger showdown is a really good villain. Without an identifiable villain, a real low life of credible evil, we're never going to enjoy the high, and relief, brought about when we experience great good overcoming great evil. Even so, despite this weakness in the story, this movie, as directed by Guillermo del Toro, has strong pacing and the added pleasure of providing the presence of one my favorite character actors, Ron Perlman. It also features energetically staged, bloodless violence and is justifiably rated PG-13.",1411344000,,698,5.025862068965517

I like the movie OK, but was hoping I could put this on my iPad and iTunes.

1. This is a really good movie! Buy it, just don't buy it via UltraViolet.
2. You are REQUIRED to set up TWO ACCOUNTS in order to even download this movie from UltraViolet. (A Flixster account & an UltraViolet account)
3. You are then REQUIRED to download an application to your computer called FLIXSTER DESKTOP. I try to keep my computer pretty lean as far as what I download, so this was discouraging to me.
4. You have NO ACCESS whatsoever to the movie file that has just taken a very long time to download onto FLIXSTER DESKTOP. There's no way to copy it to your phone or to iTunes, or anything else.
5. In order to watch it on your iPhone, you must download the FLIXSTER APP. Then, you have to sign in, which brings up your movie. Then & only then can you watch the movie that you've paid for.

I enjoyed the movie, for the most part. Fun foolishness, and I applaud Guillermo del Toro's salute to the kaiju we loved in our youth.

Now for the bad news: The constant close-up CGI was very difficult to watch. It actually made my eyes hurt, and getting through the whole movie became more and more difficult. Not having been raised on video games, anime, and cell phones, I suppose I'm just not accustomed to so much CGI up in my face. While CGI has made movies possible that could never be made in such a way before, there is such as thing as too much, especially close up. I had trouble telling which were Kaiju and which were Jaegers at some points, and I think that fewer close-ups and more mid-range shots would have served the movie better.

That being said, it was still a fun flick. But I don't think I'll be watching it twice--I just don't need the physical pain!",1410480000,,1053,4.394871794871795

5387801,5,B00A6UHC0U,"THIS is why movies are made!! It is fast-paced and incredibly detailed, and the CGI is the best I've seen. BIG monsters dubbed ""Kaiju"" from another world surface from a trench deep in the Pacific Ocean, presumably by using some sort of wormhole technology. When it becomes evident that the city-smashing monsters are going to keep coming, the great nations of the world respond by building HUGE machines that are each operated by a team of 2 or 3 people who become temporarily interlocked in a type of neural net. (The humans-in-machines fighting monsters reminded me a bit of the infamous ""Aliens"" battle between the Alien Queen and Lt. Ripley as she's strapped into a cargo loader.) Needing at least two people (who must be ""drift-compatible"") to operate one of the 250-foot machines (referred to as ""Jaegers"") dials up the intensity as well as the fun. Who wouldn't want to team up with a buddy and whip some Kaiju a$$ together in order to save the world? The CGI is truly phenomenal...it's hard to believe anyone has access to enough money and talent to make something as impressive as this movie come together. I also really liked the international Olympian feel of the Jaeger Pilot teams from the U.S., Australia, China, and Russia. My only complaint is that we didn't get to see enough of the Chinese and the Russians.  (Maybe Guillermo del Toro will do a prequel so we can see more of the Cherno Alpha and Crimson Typhoon teams in action??) This movie begs for a sequel at least.",1410393600,,1487,4.697318007662835

The only reason it even gets a star is because some of the fight sequences were cool. Every preview I saw made me acutely aware of how much this movie was going to suck, especially since they advertised it so much. Finally, one trailer got me to cave just to see the fights and it ended up being even worse than I imagined.

5387863,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Those who enjoy monster movies (Godzilla et al.) or giant robot films get the best of both in this outstanding film by director Guillermo del Toro. That the monsters are the second attempt by aliens from another dimension to take over our world adds another layer of interest to this sci-fi film. The imagery is enhanced by Toro's use of colors as themes. The attention to detail in the robots and their construction sites is amazing. The monsters are created with vivid imagination; they are no longer a man in a rubber suit. Special effects are spectacular, yet believable. The second disc of special features is as fascinating as the film itself: here, Toro describes the collaborative efforts of artists, musicians, technicians, et al in producing a film worthy of his genius.

5387867,5,B00A6UHC0U,"It's kind of difficult for me to give you a proper review on Pacific Rim. The first time I watched this, I couldn't stand it due to my inflated expectations but upon further repeat viewings, it started to grow on me. My four year old absolutely LOVES this movie as well for some reason but I mean, who didn't love movies with giant kaijus in them at that age? It's a pretty goofy movie with Charlie Hunnam playing a pretty bland role as the main character and Idris Elba existing to have his orders ignored by the heroes throughout the entire film. The supporting cast are also a mixed bag but like the film itself, they all began to grow on me, especially Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as the two geeky scientists. The robot on monster action is good enough and most of the time it's at least easy to make out what's happening although some scenes are a little too dark and shot too close to fully get what's going on. The Blu Ray helps make the film a lot more enjoyable, especially in terms of the extras. There's a ton of features detailing the immense amount of work that went into the film's production and you really get a sense of the scale of the film while poring through them. Pacific Rim fans will be delighted by the film's treatment on Blu Ray as the picture is pretty much perfect and the sound (if you have a 7.1 surround setup, you're going to want this disc in your collection, just make sure you select the 7.1 option in the menu and prepare to get blown away) is nothing less than cataclysmic. There's a lot to go through on this disc and a lot of materials to sift through to get your fill spread out over the film's two discs.

This much can be said about Pacific Rim. It's a much better film than any of the Transformers movies and if you don't take it too seriously, you may walk away from it somewhat satisfied. If you hated it but have only seen it once, give it another shot. The Blu Ray is a top notch effort and it is one of the absolute best discs I can suggest to use to show off your system. If you're a fan of the film, you'll be very happy with this release.",1408924800,,2090,4.199004975124378

5387875,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Arguably one of the best kaiju movies made.  I do not know anyone that does not love this film.  Older folks...kids.  Many have watched with me numerous times on my home theater.  Even donated a bluray copy to the hospital as I know it will make the kids feel better :)

Now some may complain about the lack of some character development for a few minor characters (Jaeger crews notably).  Personally, the development of the main and secondary characters were spot on... too much unnecessary character development takes away from an ACTION film.  Now if they had appeared in the EXTRAS then I am sure that there would have been less complaints.

Del Toro is a genius who enjoys what he does and does not compromise his vision for complete public consumption.  Anyone who has seen Hellboy or Pan's Labyrinth can attest to this.  His thought processes behind the making of this film made me proud in that he is  'Kaiju Groupie' like myself and respects traditions rather than try to rewrite/ remake them as sooooo many current writer/ directors try to do.

DO NOT GO INTO this film expecting any Oscar nods.  Unfortunately, waaaayy too many people saw and loved this film and as we all know that eliminated any chance right there...

The movie played fine until about 20 seconds in (around where the definitions of Kaiju and Jaeger appear), then the picture froze, the sound started looping, and my hard drive light turned on pretty much solid. Tried ending the process thru Task Manager, but process wouldn't end. Restarted computer, tried using Windows Media Player, got same results but froze at slightly different time. Hard drive light went crazy again. Checked DVD for scratches -- perfectly clean. I tried the Special Features DVD to see if that one would work, and it wouldn't even load.

I checked just to be safe, to make sure that the DVD was the correct region for the U.S., and it was -- region 1. My DVD drive was set to the correct region as well. Tried another random DVD movie I had lying around to see if it was my drive, and the movie played perfectly for about 10 minutes, after which I closed it.

I made the mistake of ordering this movie shortly after I saw it in theaters, and didn't open it until about 7 months later. I tried to return it because it is brand new, just opened today. Looks like my chance to return the DVD expired a little less than 60 days after ordering, so I'm way past being able to now.

The DTS HD-MA tracks on the disc are among the best you'll find. Great presence. Explosions and roars are ground shaking but the dialogue is crystal clear on the audio track at the same time.  The video track is also gorgeous, with great colors and very few artifacts if any.

5387919,4,B00A6UHC0U,"In movies such as Hellboy II and Cronos, Guillermo del Toro uses mechanical devices to symbolize the allure and danger of power--whether it's military power or immortal life. In Pacific Rim, he seems to have fallen in love with his Jaegar robots for their own sake. Guillermo del Toro has become like a character in one of his movies and Pacific Rim, consequently, is all special effects wizardry and no heart.

What distinguishes the film is its creator's unique visual style and sensibility. Instead of gleaming chrome and razor sharp Transformers, del Toro gives us giant robots cloaked in mists and sea-spray, cityscapes at night with fluorescent orange and hot pink, and all kinds of beasties such as skin parasites and monster brains.

However, the whole thing gets a little tiresome after a while. Visual echoes of other del Toro films such as Hellboy II and Pan's Labyrinth will remind you that this director has done and can do better.

I never thought I'd praise a Michael Bay film over a del Toro film, but Bay's first Transformer movie is probably all-around better than this one. Shia LaBoeuf gave us an underdog character to root for, and for once Bay's silly humor worked in his favor.

That being said, Pacific Rim is absolutely dazzling just on visual terms and I've watched it anywhere from 5 to 10 times (and I'll probably watch it at least 10 times more).",1407628800,,1375,4.764705882352941

Plot stupid, plot not following its own logic (the monsters are clones but one has a baby), heavily heavily pro military pro anger pro testosterone idiocy.  One woman in the film.  Even Ron Perlman's acting was bad.  Particularly bad acting also from the 'doctor' who wants to mind meld with the monsters.  The only thing that didn't make me laugh were the special effects, and I can get those from films written and produced by people with a brain.  I imagine everyone involved with this film is embarrassed.  I am so sorry we wasted that money.  Even 2.99 would have been a waste.  Ugh.

5387964,3,B00A6UHC0U,"popcorn summer cinema aside, 'Pacific Rim' is just another example of liberal propagandizing, like virtually every other aspect of media these days.

Why is there a romantic subplot between a very white American man and a Chinese woman? Casting the main character as a white man means that Hollywood believes implicitly unreconstructed white men and their families still constitute the majority of Summer viewers. He is the Judas Goat. Casting a black woman instead of a Chinese woman would be too blunt and would set off everyone's race radars, thus eliminating their receptivity to social-engineering, like throwing a frog into boiling water. Casting a black man instead of a white man would do the same, so they cast the down-to-earth, virtuous, wise leader as a black man, like in '24'. The narrative's perspective should be white so as to lure in white empathy and then redirect this emotional connection to the virtues defining the narrative as personified by the black man. Social-engineering works best when playing the averages, which is why it would be unwise to, say, cast Bond as black before the averages say so.

But why a Chinese woman? If she were white then there would be too much surviving white perspective in the film with which the white audience to connect since the primary Chinese perspective 'Crimson Typhoon' and the black leader all die. Where then would white empathy go? It would go back to whites. That's a big no no for liberals.

The Chinese lady is one of two ways to reconstruct whites through film after the initial lure (described above) is set. The other way is the liberal/bourgeois sentimentalization of children (see 'Half Nelson') or brow-beating liberal brutalization like Robert Rodriguez's films. The Chinese women is basically an offering to the white-man, using the inherent sex/love appeal, within the controlled confines of liberal propaganda, as a means of convincing him that the mixed racial future is going to be good after all. Bargaining women is a very old custom, but in the overwhelming majority of history this practice was predicated by woman's inherent inferiority, as a symbol of domination by the buyers, colonizers or invaders, not personally/individually but 'politically', that is, sexually/racially/nationally. That all changes in liberalism. The exchange happens but now it's all about the 'person', the 'individual'. Here we're just supposed to see an attractive looking 'individual' in the Chinese woman and NOT a CHINESE woman, her racial difference, her linguistic difference, and indeed all of her differences are something to be disposed of by liberalism and digested by the all consuming 'one human race, not races' platitude.

Other liberalisms in the movie is the premise that the aliens were able to invade because Capitalism destroyed Earth's biosphere. Interestingly, both scientists are cast by white guys. This doesn't happen in Hunger Games, where the weird science guy is a black dude of the incorruptible type that Hollywood adores. I think this is because Hollywood bets that Hunger Games is mainly a teen adventure. More barriers have been destroyed in the young and so they are more receptive to explicit indoctrination. The fact that whites are here scientists bolsters my belief that Hollywood still thinks summer movie viewing includes white dads.

As for the film 'itself', without the stuff you're not supposed to notice, the action is good and everything else is recycled Hollywood narrative cliches. Really, that's it. I was disappointed that the two most unique mechs barely received any screen time.

And how is it that despite the failure of Hadrian's Wall, the Atlantic Wall (Normandy), the Maginot, Hindenburg, Gothic and Siegfried Lines, the world leaders here give it another crack? Ok, it's a robot fantasy for teenage boys and they're certainly not going to know their history but consider yourself warned that you'll need to suspend belief at a pretty high level for Pacific Rim.

Essentially, some sort of crack in reality allows giant Godzilla type monsters to rise from the ocean and attack mankind's ever vulnerable major cities. (Take a tip from Sci Fi invasion movies - DO NOT live near the Sydney Opera House - it attracts alien attackers like moths!)  Standard weapons, which otherwise work well against everything else are suddenly useless. As is apparently the expensive training of air-force pilots, who suddenly forget all about their aircrafts advanced stealth technology and stand-off capacities like `fire and forget' munitions and seek to `close' with the monsters King Kong 1930s style. Anyway, the only answer obviously is to construct giant robots like Gigantor but with a better nose and paint job. The catch is though that they must be piloted by two very compatible pilots. This allows for all sorts of dinky human relationships. Beware there might be a clich or fifty here! An additional `beware' for Australian viewers - apparently our accent sounds incredibly moronic. Try not to talk to anyone from overseas ever again. You will sound obnoxious and will quickly become expendable.

So, there are some credibility issues but the special effects are excellent before they become monotonous. There's a couple of fun touches and some diverges from the obvious - but not many. It's solid enough if you're a teenage boy or someone able to remember being one. Leave reason and logic at home and you will have a reasonable time.",1405555200,2,2014,5.023952095808383

5388034,1,B00A6UHC0U,"Yes, I feel slightly ridiculous confessing that I felt my time watching this travesty of a film was a complete waste and then proceeding to take more time to review it. But I felt a compulsion to throw my two cents into the review fountain, since there are so many mind numbingly ridiculous 5 star reviews waiting to fool other customers.

I took the word of a friend that this was an enjoyable movie. I, unfortunately, will have a tainted view of any recommendation from him for a longtime to come. This movie had good special effects, and that is about as far as my praise can go. Terrible acting, worse scripting, unoriginal plot, completely predictable ""twists,"" gaping plot holes, lame attempts at humor (unless you count the part where the main character says ""I think it's dead, but let's check for a pulse,"" but I doubt that was meant to be stab at comedy), ridiculously shallow characters... (sigh). I honestly cannot believe that the vast amount of reviews for this movie on this and other sites are legitimate. If you like shallow, one-dimensional superficial visual spectacles, then youmay love this movie. But I believe that it is not too much to ask for some depth of plot, compelling script, and unpredictability. Just because the idea of the alien foe invading from another dimension through a portal in the ocean hasn't been done specifically,does not mean the plot is original. It's a slight tweak to what has been done over and over again. And I am not a critic of all unoriginality in general. It simply bothers me when people claim something is original when it merely draws small plot details from many sources and throws those bits into a mess of special effects on steroids without putting some effort into a little character development and intelligent creativity. Good heavens. I nearly threw up when I read one woman's review on here that said she was not engaging in hyperbole when she stated that this may be the best movie ever made. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, it's true...

And my opinion is that that statement is the epitome of hyperbole. Utter shallow rubbish, this movie is. Mind numbing bilge. Shockingly pathetic. The cathartic act of writing this review on the other hand, though also pathetic, I feel was not a waste of time.",1404691200,3,2273,4.751898734177215

5388058,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim is not a perfect film, and there are some very good criticisms that can be made about it. However, in terms of the type of film that it is, and what it is actually trying to accomplish--from my perspective, anyway--it's a very enjoyable, impressive creation. Basically, if you are in the core target demographic, you will probably at least like if not love it. But if the 'giant robots fighting aliens' angle is not something that you particularly care about in and of itself, then this film is probably bound to be disappointing. Fair enough.

Strengths:
The money sequences, the ones in which the giant robots (Jaegers) are fighting the giant aliens (Kaiju) are absolutely fantastic. I could not be happier about that part of this film, and that is what this film is all about, so it goes a long way. Some have commented about the battles taking place offshore and at night. Does it help the visual effects to have darkness and water in the mix? Sure, but I also think that it looks freaking awesome. The choreography captures a great sense of scale, and the atmosphere is great.

The visual design is also much to my liking. I spent hours as a child drawing spaceships and the like, and I love the different designs of the Jaegers. It's a bit like technology porn. Also, as someone who has lived in Alaska, I found that the sets and buildings really do capture the feel of ""northern Pacific industrial"" architecture, which gives Pacific Rim a rather unique feel for a blockbuster.

Weaknesses
There are two things, here. First, the human characters are hit and miss. While Idris Elba is great as always and Rinko Kikuchi's flashback sequence is possibly the best scene in the film, Charlie Hunam is very wooden as a lead, and most of the other ""pilots"" are either underdeveloped or thinly cliched. Second, there are at least two or three plot elements that are extremely overt rip-offs of Independence Day. As in, practically cut-and-paste. It would probably have been better to avoid such blatant copying of another film.

I was also a bit surprised at the amount of humor (Charlie Day, Ron Perlman) in this film. At first, it felt like it was taking away from the seriousness, but from where I stand now, I appreciate it. This film is designed to be entertaining, and it can be taken as a bit of a blessing that the tone is not monotonous. It's actually a lot of fun.

Finally, a comparison with the Transformers films is both fair and unavoidable, because giant robots. While Pacific Rim is not the best-written film, it is quite a breath of fresh air for one who finds Michael Bay's style to be often obnoxious and immature. Pacific Rim also, arguably does a better job of capturing the visceral quality of giant robots in battle. This film is all about that very thing in a way that the Transformers films have not quite been, and that is why Pacific Rim gets my approval in spite of its imperfections.",1403481600,,2922,4.633204633204633

5388078,4,B00A6UHC0U,"A friend of mine helped me out before the movie saying the 'Jaegar' suits in the film were named after German war machines. It was help I didn't need. When the film was over I spoke out to him nearby where he had been playing on the computer and asked him what he had thought. He said, ""it reminded me of a video game"". I've seen films like this, perhaps even ones based on a video game, but didn't notice it here.. . I've seen too many by now.

As the movie went along I started thinking, ""this is like Asian kids adopted by white parents that some Asian activists claim is child abuse, this is like a movie version of that"". There are no Asian characters in the film, except one young woman, and the film shamelessly exploits her feelings and has her running around, one must assume, at the bequest of white screen writers and producers (I'm guessing it is claimed to be child abuse because Asian children need more sensitive care than most white parents can provide. I don't know). Half way through the film it gets really bad and I literally spoke to my friend, ""This is like white parents adopting Asian children that some say is child abuse. This is like a movie version of that"". Very quickly after that the black defense company commander in the film really gives the young white hero in the film a hard time, as if to point this offensiveness out somehow. The film is being offensive towards Asians, and then the black character in the film seems to correct this. That he does, chastising the hero (the viewer in a sense) and setting us straight for having enjoyed the film so much up till then. Immediately after this, other Asian characters in the film become real. Down in one of the kitchens you can see older, weary Asian extra's eating a meal. Before this, when Asian characters are onscreen, such as an Asian team of robot-commanders, they turn their heads away as they get close to the camera, you never even see an Asian face until this part of the film, the exception being the one Asian girl in the film. But now that the black man has berated him, about something having nothing to do with racism or sensitivity (in the film), this is enough correct it. Setting aside the fact that black men (of all people) must somehow be the gate keepers of all morality, as indeed surely they must be, this episode should make little real sense. The top Amazon review for this movie wrote, ""Idris Elba (the black lead in the film) gets to play to his strengths very well here and chew a lot of scenery as an AGING HERO with SAD SECRETS, and lest you think that del Toro will craft a strong black lead then stick him in an office like every other director, rest assured that Pentacost punches monsters in a big robot too"". This movie is intentionally offensive toward Asians but it's good to know it get's the A-OK for being properly sensitive to black male actors, who, apparently, are unfairly stuck in offices as the token commander and unfairly kept from the movie action. It's good to know there are concerned citizens out there willing to do what they can to help defeat racism.

There are other weird aspects to the film, I would say. The young robot-commanders play a fighting, training game, where they fight each other with Eastern style fighting techniques while fighting with sticks. What this has to do with operating giant robots isn't clear. The duel-operators of the robots do move around some and the giant robots follow their commands (it seems kinda cool). The young white hero bests everyone else with his stick. The young Asian female character, who is introduced as a friend/side kick of the base commander here, agrees or is sent out to fight the young man. She beats him. The young man proclaims afterward, ""You know we'd be prefect together (for controlling a robot)"". Ignoring the fact that he looks to be more than twice as strong as her, and strength would have to figure in this contest, how would beating each other up with sticks prove they are a perfect match for controlling a robot, or help them control robots in any way? For the most part, other than this training, there isn't too much violence in the movie. The giant monsters and giant robots do fight each other, while their commanders strain and move about inside. There is one fight in the film. The young hero is insulted by a male rival and they get into a small fight. The young hero says something like, ""take that back, I'm not going to let you insult her"" and when his rival doesn't take it back he defends the girl's honor by fighting. Why is the hero defending her honor? Why would you beat someone up to do this? Assuming her honor must be defended (and really the guy seemed to insult him more than her if I remember right), hasn't it already been shown in the film the she can easily beat up the guy who is going to defend her? His rival puts up a pretty good fight. The message might be, ""don't start a fight, it could end up being more than you bargain for"". Leaving the review for a minute, I was in a random chat room the other day and a contributor said something, ""when men fight it is always really about women"". I immediately dismissed the comment, but then started wondering about it later. . .

What is the film trying to do. . . teach us moral lessons about 'tolerance' (aside from the, perhaps, anti-bullying message warning us against fighting)? Even though the film is offensive to Asians, are we learning the importance of not unfairly excluding potential black role models from cinema (Black men, anyway)? Is the film attempting to promote the greater movie industry, with it taking some high moral ground, somehow. Are the important lessons here included in hopes the film will make more money? The film certainly gives me a chance to discuss it's content in my review.

As the film is nearly over, and the monsters are defeated, the young hero and his Asian cohort are left stranded in a rubber life raft on the ocean. The young hero has had a tough time, and he's unconscious. The question becomes, will the Asian girl revive him with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation? I was sitting there thinking, ""please, no"". And thankfully she doesn't. These two, set together in the film, would seem to end up being just colleagues. There may be very little or no sexuality in the film. The girl waits a long time and still doesn't try to revive him. Perhaps this might even worry you of an Asian girlfriend. . . I was starting to worry about the guy but he finally wakes up. He could even have been faking it. Maybe she was onto that.

Other than the bizarre racism or neglect of Asians, that the film maker's themselves put in the movie, and somehow rise above, I liked it. I liked it quite a bit. Was unsure of giving this film 4 stars, but despite the 'giant robots as Earth's best weapons', and perhaps other absurdities (that I point out here), I did like it. I thought I might have a hard time giving this film 4 stars, but any film that pays homage to the movie Independence Day, having the final plot based on that movie, in what is very likely intended as a tribute, any such a film is OK by me and it's one I would give 4 stars.",1402617600,,7153,4.469778117827085

This is a really good film. I love Guillermo del Toro and think he is a visionary (ex: Pans Labyrinth). I think he did an excellent job translating his artistic tendencies into a sic-fi film.

If you are really want to see a Transformers-like film, don't watch this movie because you probably won't be able to handle it.

I suspect kids (of about maybe 10-14 years) would like it .... but then 10 year olds  like Power Rangers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles too ..... this is about on par with that ........ if you want a good sci fi story that you cant guess the ending of within the first half hour and want  with decent acting and well written scenes ........ skip this one ......... in fact skip it either way,1402358400,,783,4.454545454545454

Because the writers knew you can't write about something as ridiculous as giant robots and giant monsters and still keep a straight face about it. So when little Asian people in the streets all go ""Aiiieeeee!!"", while looking up and pointing to the sky in unison, you know the writing was such that it's okay to laugh a little because this is not a movie where they pretend that something like this could actually happen. So they don't pretend to offer a semi-historical view of how these monsters came to be.

5388097,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I should have seen this film on the big screen. An easy to follow story with rich character development, a great cast and let's not forget incredible special effects. That is the beauty of Pacific Rim.

Channeling some of the greatest science fiction films of the past, Guillermo Del-Toro, once again gives us a winner in this epic. This film takes the best of sci-fi from meahca to post apocalypse to old Japanese monster movies. Also driven by a perfect blend of action, drama and comedy this movie has a little something for everyone.

I probably would have given this movie a perfect score if I would have seen it on the big screen, but it took me no less than 10 minutes to decide to be a proud owner of this film after finally getting a chance to see it. This film will certainly go down as one of the greatest sci-fi cult classic films and I am so happy that it was everything I was hoping for it to be after a long wait.",1401926400,,928,4.267045454545454

The image was constantly blurry and out of focus. However, the 3d would suddenly get sharp and blow me away. I spent days troubleshooting the blurriness only to realize the issues were isolated to this movie. Once I tried other 3d films, and they were outstanding, I was saddened at this release's issues.

The battles are visually stunning, the story not-awful, some amusing characters.........for monster mayhem, who could ask for more?

Charlie Day plays the same character in all of his movies/tv shows and yet that is in no way depressing or uncalled for.  The man's funny.  The lead character's acting is stiff, exactly like it is in Sons of Anarchy, but that might be unfair because the screen play is so awful.

The quality of the special effects is excellent - the crew behind this movie really knew what they were doing.

Originality is pretty lacking - it's basically a cross between Alien, Godzilla, and Power Rangers.  Why are mechs always giant human-shaped machines with loads of fire power but all of the physiological weaknesses of the human body?  Because it's awesome to watch a giant humanoid wreak destruction, of course!

The only female with a primary role in the film is portrayed as psychologically very weak, a damsel in distress despite her apparent skizzlets in battle.  Which is great if you fantasize about playing protector for a hot Asian chick, but I kind of wonder how the opposite sex would appreciate this aspect of the movie.

I enjoyed Pacific Rim even though it lacks much of what I typically look for in a movie.  I'd highly recommend it to lovers of light-hearted sci-fi action...just not so much to someone who values realism and character development.  Probably not a great choice for a date, but an AWESOME choice for an evening with friends.

I would describe this movie as 'fun', not 'powerful'; 'exciting', not 'intense'.  You won't suddenly realize you've been leaning forward in your seat, but you will probably end up consuming a very large quantity of whatever snack you have on hand.",1400803200,,1430,4.937238493723849

5388151,4,B00A6UHC0U,"This was a fun flick that did an excellent homage to Japanese cinema involving battles against giant monsters.

The robots came across as a little too generic but still looked real as they moved. The monsters were quite bizarre looking.

Idris Elba was excellent as the leader of the resistance. His presence was always felt on every scene he was in.
Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi worked very well together
The scene with the Younger Rinko was very moving. That girl was looked genuinely terrified.

The movie was loaded with fun clichs. Great monster vs robot action keeps the pace and makes you thirst for more.

Set in a not too distant future earth is being threatened by an alien invasion.  Monsters (think Godzilla type) coming through a dimensional breach are attacking population centers with devastating effect.  The most capable defense against these monsters (kaiju) are these massive robots (jaegar) that have been built via global collaboration to preserve mankind.

The action sequences are mostly robot versus monster beat downs, via some very well done CGI, and fight choreography.  Some of the tech is advanced, but for the most part it is believable in terms of being a natural next generation progression from what we currently have, which for me was kind of cool.

It takes real talent to F-up a movie about giant monsters and robots fighting for the survival of the human race. Basically this is every nerd's dream movie....or at least it should have been. Forget all the incredibly bad acting, writing and logic holes. Lets just take the sword as an example. So there's a weapon already loaded into the Jaeger BUT: 1. No one knows about it except the crazy Japanese chick. 2. It can literally slice giant category 4 Kaiju's up like sashimi. 3. They wait to use it until AFTER a bunch of people die, a bunch of Jaegers are destroyed and they are almost are killed themselves. I'm tolerant of stupid movies if they try. BUT this just was too much, even for me. With such a cool concept and such a huge budget how F-ing hard would it be to have hired some good writers?? The least you can do is make a movie about giant, clone, pregnant, world-eating alien juggernauts logical!! Is that too damn much to ask?? Also, you know that a movie has some serious problems when the best acting is by a 9 year old Japanese girl who doesn't say a word.

The difference is, in the 22nd century, life had evolved to the level where it could defeat the ""powers that be"" and escape from the censorship of the ""guardians.""

Thus, the basic premise of the movie is cosmic, and there are personalities in the movie, the four principals, that present several paradigm human personality types illustrating noble and beautiful ideals. The two superficially conflicting ""mad scientists"" made a ""scientifically"" probable and gloomy prediction that the ""powers that be"" (monstrous mentalities in other dimensions than the ones we live in) could keep a ""breach"" open between the two universes and in that way continue getting into our world with slave clone monsters to cause periodic critical extinctions in life's history. In the end, the human persistence and drive of two mind-melded boy and girl friends manage to the bitter end to overcome all obstacles (upon what were based the scientific evidence for the doom and gloom predictions of the ""mad scientists""), closes the breach between the dimensions of the monster's universe and ours, and manages to escape the consequences and live happily ever after as husband and wife.

In the meantime, we witness on the screen some of the scariest and most awesome CGI of monsters and equally monstrous robots in flawless Blu Ray. Altogether, a movie that takes itself absolutely seriously about how monstrous monsters can be, with an objective absurdity over the top that is at the same time thoroughly convincing.",1399161600,,1971,5.080246913580247
5388221,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I bought this movie, but never got to see it due to some glitch in the way I ordered it.  However, I did see it on TV and it was very good.  It starred my main man Idris Elba.  A movie can't be all bad with that beautiful piece of chocolate in it.  Oh yeah, and the action was good too. (smile)",1399161600,,294,3.693548387096774
5388222,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Guillermo Del Toro is one of my favorite directors. The way he goes about making movies is unique and wonderful. I love love love that he doesn't heavily rely on CGI in his movies unless it is completely necessary, such as the jaegers and kaiju. I remember looking at the BTS of this movie and seeing that the cockpits for Pacific Rim actually moved and swayed to get that realistic affect of them moving.  I believe in an interview Guillermo had said that the contraptions were a good four stories off the ground and could drop 15ft and called them torture machines. The reason being that the actors would be whipped around while attached to the machine and has water canons blasted at them.

One thing I extremely love about this movie is how much in-depth background it gives you about every character. It doesn't just focus on the protagonist and his story, it tells you the lives of the others as well.

Another thing that sets apart Guillermo from other directors is that he can make a movie without it having a romantic sub-plot. He shows that a man and a woman can be friends and stay friends and not become something more. I want more movies like that, you know? Some romantic sub-plots are just to give the protagonist some angst, force them to make hard decisions, and/or just get in the way. It's annoying. Unless the protagonist's significant other has something to do with the main storyline and is there to move the story along. If they're just be there to give us sexy times, then they're not necessary. Best example of this is the Transformers franchise. Megan Fox's character did not contribute anything to the story line except be a love interest for Shia Labeouf's character.",1399161600,,1695,4.6433333333333335

If you're just looking for a fun popcorn movie where giant robots kick the $&%* out of giant monsters then this one is a pretty good choice.

5388227,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I'm a dad, with two girls and boys.  They got me this gift for Xmas because they know, deep down, I like big explosions and crazy action in my summer flicks.  One night, when I had the house to myself, I turned it on, cranked up the volume and watched and it blew my mind.  We have a big screen, surround, all that jazz.  I watched it 5 times that week, so loud that they walls vibrated.  Oh man, this movie ROCKS.

You've read the reviews and you know, monsters and mechs.  Lots of fighting.  But here is the thing.  I remember this when I was a kid and saw Time Bandits, and they are in the hat on the giants head.....  I always would ask the question, why are giants so slow.  After all, we are giants to ants, and we can be crazy fast - why are giants always so slow?  Well, in this movie, giants are NOT slow.  But they do this in a great way - by showing the effort that it takes the pilots to move their giant mech's, how they start out slow to control the robot, but, can break out into super speed sprints, lightning punches, etc.  It actually paired the two together in an awesome way.  The endless and effortless destruction was just FUN.  The fights are FUN.  Particularly like the Hong Kong scene, where the Kaiju literally pushes Gypsy through a building and keeps on going.  The total destruction is mind blowing..... and.... kinda fun.

Anyway, now that I have seen the movie 10 times, I finally got one daughter to watch it.  She loved it and we had a great conversation about Kaiju at the dinner table the next night to my wife's jeering looks.  How cool is it that you fall in love with it, and then think about it and talk about it at the dinner table.  Love my kids of buying me this movie - its just too cool in so many ways.",1398902400,,1747,4.136904761904762

I have a Samsung 50F6800, and only ended up with a 3D TV because I bought a floor model on sale that was cheaper than non-3D TVs.

Other reviews pretty well sum up the details: aliens invade earth, establishing themselves under the
ocean and attacking the cities from there.  Mankind defends via honking big human-controlled robot
creatures (seems a bit of a questionable premise to me--if we were so technologically advances,
wouldn't we have perhaps made them automated?  Would we have made a lot more of them on a
little smaller scale?  I know, I know, this is basically a TEEN MOVIE, and you aren't supposed to
ANALYZE it.  You're supposed to enjoy the thumping, the smashing, the heroes-save-mankind,
the incredible sound and graphics, the traumatized-warrior-returns-to-service, the teamwork,
all that kinda thing.  Plus thumping, smashing, pounding, flying, explosions, lack of nudity or
vulgarity--in short, everything that adolescent (and post-adolescent) boys (and some girls) get a kick
out of in a movie.  If you want a more thoughtful version of humans versus alien, go and watch
Ender's Game instead....",1398816000,,1084,5.309941520467836

The story follows a brother who helps to kill off the terrible monsters that are plaguing our planet and causing destruction.
The story was bad, really really bad.  Poor development of story, characters, bad dialogue.  Not that the movie had to be soul inspiring, but it definitely needed more depth.  i want the story to grab me, to captivate me, to keep me glued to chair because I'm interested in the characters, their growth, and the evolution of the drama as the story unfolds.
The sets were beautiful and big, but if there's no story and more importantly a main character to really grab you, then what's the point of the movie.
Again, incredible VFW scenes.  You can spend millions of dollars on VFW, and have an incredible movie, visually.  But the story is, and should be more important than any VFW.  And this movie, failed on the story, in my opinion.
I made myself watch 40 min of this, and then couldn't take it anymore.

5388280,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Few people can make a film like Gulliermo del Toro. He's delivered us two fantastic ""Hellboy"" films, set the standard for ""Blade,"" and wowed us with the magnificent ""Pan's Labyrinth."" And he's an excellent novelist, as well. And his latest work, ""Pacific Rim,"" sent fanboys into a tizzy with it's concept of giant robots versus giant monsters. It's like Transformers meets Godzilla, and it works fantastically! For the most part, anyway.

The film is about giant monsters (kaiju) who come up from a portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean (it sounds absolutely cuckoo, and it is; just accept it and move on). Humans eventually create and pilot Jaegers, giant robots that require two pilots sharing a nerual link to control. This link allows the pilots access to each other's memories, and helps them form a bond that allows them to work together in sync and take out the kaiju.

Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam) used to pilot ""Gipsy Danger"" with his older brother Yancy. After Yancy is killed during a battle and leaving Raleigh to finish the fight solo, Raleigh finds himself abandoning the Jaeger program due to the emotional trauma he sustained due to Yancy's death while they were still in the ""Drift"" (the film's name for the neural link). Five years later, Raleigh is called back by Marshal Pentecost (Idris Elba) to pilot ""Gipsy Danger"" once more for a special mission to close the ""Breach"" with a thermonuclear warhead.

Raleigh begins searching for a new co-pilot and finds one on the young Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), who has a traumatic past of her own. After a few mishaps during their training, the pair finally learn to work together and put a stop to the kaiju invasion.

This was my favorite film of 2013, hands down. The story is solid, and the actors are all in top form. The film's humor comes primarily from Charlie Day, who plays a scientist obsessed with the Kaiju. Day's interactions with Ron Pearlman's Hannibal Chau form a neat subplot involving creating a Drift with a kaiju brain.

As with most summer blockbusters, the effects are top-notch, and the score by Ramin Djwandi is eclectic, throwing back to the music from the great kaiju films of old, like Godzilla and Gamera, and even features Tom Morello doing some of his best guitar work since his Rage Against the Machine days.

On the downside, the love story hinted at between Raleigh and Mako never reaches it's full potential. While it is clearly there, it's more subtle, and the connection the two have in the Drift feels like that should have been amplified. Alas, it's cast aside in favor of the massive set pieces. Hopefully, a sequel will delve into it further.

As it is, Pacific Rim is a glorious film. Beautifully crafted, this film stands with the best of them as a true home run.",1397433600,,2774,4.754677754677755

5388282,5,B00A6UHC0U,"The GuillermoDelToro movie ""Pacific Rim ""is on HBO, so we watched it tonight.
It is produced and directed by DelToro, and he wrote the screenplay.
Ron Perlman, who starred in Hellboy ( also by Del Toro ), has a minor but fabulous role.

I expected the movie to be silly or goofy and dumb, but I wanted to see it anyway.
Boy, was I wrong. It is fantastic. It is like a fabulous comic book brought to life.

The design and sets and cinematography are fantastic; and the story is good.

The story is straightforward, with some ingenious twists.
The characters are well-designed. There is not a dud among them.
All of the millions of details are beautifully wrought.

The plot is simple:
In the future, giant aliens are entering our planet through a RIFT in the ocean floor.
After all else fails, humans design giant robots to fight them.
The giant robots, which look like a cross between IronMan and Transformers,
have to be controlled by two humans each. The humans have to ""drift "", which means
they have to mind-link, or mind-meld, while they are controlling the robot.
All of this sounds silly, and would probably look silly if anyone else had directed it.
DelToro pulls it off awesomely.

The giant aliens are incredible, like giant evil alien dinosaurs mashed-up with Godzilla.

Although this storyline alone would have been enough, DelToro adds
a few more characters and a few more plotlines to make it way more special.

The climax is very climactic, really. You will find yourself cheering for the robot.
There is just enough of the aliens to be satisfying.

One of my favorite visuals in the movie is the depiction of a worm-hole,
or inter-dimensional rift, through which the robot falls. I found it to be believable
and inspirational and strange.

Five stars and see it again.",1397260800,,1784,4.710610932475884

The acting was generally terrible throughout (most of the time, people were just shouting in each other's faces). The lead scientist, for example, constantly spoke in a shrill whine that got old very fast. As a result, we never really became immersed in the characters' conflicts and acts of heroism.

The concept was interesting, but without a strong enough plot and without strong performances, how many times can you watch a huge metal thing beat up on an equally huge alien thing? The movie never really figured out what it wanted to be when it grew up: action/adventure, live-action anime, soap opera, or popcorn movie.",1397260800,,703,4.907563025210084

It is about giant robots pistol-whipping giant alien monsters in their ugly faces, except instead of ""pistol"" insert ""cargo ship."" The plot has some enormous and frankly idiotic holes, the 'science' is retarded, and almost every character is a solidly 2-dimensional trope. Ron Perlman is apparently the most badass macho-man in the world, and he doesn't even walk a twenty-story Transformer wannabe around the ocean. Seriously, how the hell are the giant robots always standing in knee-deep water when they are literally miles from shore and even the  kaiju they are fighting are swimming around underneath them....no wait. There I go, trying to apply logic and reason to what is clearly the product of a deranged mind.

But what a fabulously deranged mind, no? So let go of your questions, forget physics, math, history, and any semblance of sanity. Look at the giant frickin' robots stabbing the huge, hideous monsters in their boney, nightmare faces. For Humanity! For Peace! For Love! For, uh, Anti-Global Warming!

Problem is I think, is that this movie is all about being BIG and it's hard to capture that in a 3 minute blip. I recall not getting excited about it at all so that's the producer's fault for not presenting it properly or getting audiences pumped up about seeing it.
HOWEVER.... boy was I thrilled when watching this. 3-d or not this movie is an fun filled rock-em sock-em good guys prevail movie that will leave you  cheering on till the end. Awesome movie, thrilling, fantastic special effects, just enough laughs so not to be annoying.  So many movies of this magnitude lose you because there's no connection to the story line or feelings for the characters.  It's more about how loud  they can be, how much stuff they can blow up or destroy and just too much busy all over the place no meaning special effects.

Some of his usual cast of actors appear in this, and it looked like everyone was having a good time and putting their game on. It has a couple of familiar faces from England- there's the actor who plays the lead in a British cop show playing the Big Boss; one of the actors from the Dr Who spin-off Torchwood appearing as an eccentric scientist (good casting on that one).

5388330,4,B00A6UHC0U,"i enjoyed this movie more watching it the second time, which surprised me. but it's a finely crafted bit of entertainment and there is much here to enchant. yes, the plot is rudimentary (it's a comic book) but so is the plot of a broadway musical.

and if you look at the film with a sense for its style, the beautiful color design, the costume design of the jager pilot suits, the art design of the jagers themselves, the swooping and slithering camera, the arch poses and dramatic gestures of the various characters, the weaving together of the five plot lines -- the monsters, the machines, the two lovers, the two stern commanders (idris elba and max martini), the wacky scientists -- you can appreciate this as a skillfully crafted and finely polished bit of captivating nonsense ... just like a broadway musical.

the fight scenes between the monster robots and the monster invaders are spectacular, although there's a little too much use of smoothed particle hydrodynamics to make the spume and thrashing waves, which look less like water than clouds of glittering gnats. but the film is littered with wry sight and script gags, from ""number one, don't ever touch me again. number two ..."" to the giant flap number digital clock, the robot punch that sends a desktop kinetic sculpture clattering, deep sea fish killed by an explosion that flop on the ocean floor as if on a beach, the man with the missing shoe (punchline in the credits) and, my favorite, the monster with an umbilical cord -- who knew those extraterrestrial lizard beasts were really mammals? and is there anywhere a pair of crazier scientists than charlie day and burn gorman? or a more touching child than mana ashida as the tearful young mako mori? we even get ellen mclain, the voice of the deadpan evil robot in ""portal"", as the computer voice in the jager ""gypsy danger"". the director and scriptwriter sell it all with a smile and a wink.

this movie doesn't take its pretense seriously, just its talent and craftsmanship. all the actors do a superb job in their roles, and the control of style and narrative is remarkable. it makes this fantasy worth watching more than once ... with extra butter on the popcorn.",1395878400,,2194,4.738219895287958

But Pacific Rim really surprised me.  Great exciting visual effects, an interesting plot with some surprises, but most of all, this was an epic nod to old Godzilla movies, upgraded for the 21st century.

Building giant robots to fight seabourne aliens, hmmmm... very realistic, I cannot help think that a sub with nuclear armed torpedoes would keep such creatures well sorted before getting even close to shore.

5388467,5,B00A6UHC0U,"In true geek fashion, this was one of the movies I'd dreamt of being made. Plot? We don't need no steeeeeeeeeenking plot! We have 3-D CGI! We've got what every kid that watched Godzilla wished they could create, a giant robot defending the human race against amazingly designed and creatively envisioned monsters from another dimension.

Godzilla fan? King Kong? Voltron? Robotech? Comics? Just as the recent explosion of comic book driven movies of the last 10+ years, this flick does not dissapoint (thankfully there's no beloved characters written completely wrong with the wrong actors... That I know of... Not sure what this movie was adapted from... A comic or the writers original ideas).

It's campy, it's dramatic, it's tragic, it's action, Action, ACTION! It's hunky guys and cute Asian chicks. There's even an adorably ugly dog. What else could you ask for? Ron Pearlman in super flashy attire? If you need more than this, you're awfully demanding!

5388474,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Del Toro is a great director.  This was his foray into Summer Blockbuster, a loving homage to the kaiju and anime movies of his youth.  Flawed, but alot of fun.  Part of the problem is that as a Del Toro fan, we may have set the ""bar"" too high for this type of movie.",1393718400,,267,3.9074074074074074
5388475,3,B00A6UHC0U,"What I liked:

2 scenes in particular. When the defeated Gipsy Danger comes crashing down in the snow and when Gipsy is dragging a cargo ship through the streets of Hong Kong prior to beating down a kaiju with it..

The suits the Jaeger pilots wore were well designed and looked cool.

Some of the shots have a lot of depth in 3D that really convey the sheer size of the Jaeger's and Kaiju's.

What I didn't like:

The 3D quality isn't consistent throughout the movie.

Nearly everything else. Horribly predictable plot, Good actors with the exception of Charlie Day, whom I would love to punch right in the throat, doing sub par jobs off of a sub par script.

It would have been really cool to see some robot on monster beat downs that happened during the day but instead, Del Toro thought it would be better to keep those moments in the dark and in the rain all the time.

With those, there's way too much in the way of shaky cam close ups and the Kaiju's just end up looking like blobs bouncing around the screen. I feel bad for the artists that spent so much time creating those only to have them obscured and muddied.

The final battle between the Jaeger's and Kaiju's have no impact because there's no reason to care what happens to either side.
The monsters are just monsters. No personalities, no worthwhile motives. I felt like I did when I was playing the Crysis series of video games. The enemies are just something to shoot at and blow up.

Sure, apparently the whole world is in danger but we only see super quick glimpses of that in the beginning and I feel that diminishes the want to get behind the humans and see them take care of business. Del Toro makes a worldwide threat feel like it's only happening in one city and that's a huge mistake on his part. Just because the movie's called ""Pacific Rim"" doesn't mean you should set the entire movie in one spot.

While I wouldn't put this in the same category of terrible as I would the ""Transformers franchise"", it's just an ok movie with maybe 5-10 minutes worth of cool scenes worth re-watching a couple of times.

If you're interested in this flick, just try to find it on the cheap like I did. With the extras and stuff, I don't feel burned paying $15 for the 3D version but I also doubt that it will be a permanent fixture in my collection.",1393632000,,2311,4.373831775700935
5388476,3,B00A6UHC0U,The concept of this movie seemed good at first but just got too over the top for me.  It was kind of like Godzilla meets Power Rangers meets War of the World.,1393632000,,158,3.9375
5388477,3,B00A6UHC0U,More CGI than story...Fast paced. Modern day Godzilla vs Robots but was ok I wouldn't spend more than $2 watching it,1393632000,,116,4.571428571428571
5388478,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I tell this to everyone. If you love Giant Robots vs Giant Monsters, this movie is the greatest thing to ever be made for that niche genre.

The male lead is not particularly compelling especially evident in scenes with Idris Elba. Love Guillermo del Toro but this one did not meet his usual mark. The cinematography was stunning though.,1393632000,,301,4.8076923076923075
5388482,5,B00A6UHC0U,Top notch graphics. Feeling of awe with giant war machines and power. Good acting and Elba and his character was one where you'd want more of him and it in other films too.  I want more of GYPSY DANGER.,1393545600,,202,4.17948717948718
5388483,4,B00A6UHC0U,"This is an active and kind of corny movie.  While at times it's a little difficult to follow,  the special effects more than make up for it.  If you are a fan of Godzilla, and maybe power rangers or that cartoon voltran force ( I think , an old cartoon before transformers and Rangers) , don't forget action video games,  it's perfect for you!",1393545600,,343,4.3125

I'm a big sci-fi guy, this is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best sci-fi of the last fifteen years. Made with love and care, this is a dumb movie done brilliantly.

I like, not only the movie, also the disk case is pretty nice collection.
The sculpt of gypsy danger quite details and the city buildings as the background is great.
And the special features really entertaining, especially when the director himself revealing his idea about how the kaiju or the jaeger should act. But what I loved the most was the disk case, if you like to collect action figures, it's really worth to add into your collection.

It's either more big robots punching animal-looking aliens, or it's the sequentially-appropriate cliche of any stupid action movie.

Really this movie only deserves the following summary.

For a few dollars I would recommend it, but only if there isn't a more promising movie out.",1393200000,,346,4.338461538461538
5388508,5,B00A6UHC0U,"The movie is great. It captures many styles as kinju movies of the 50's and 60's but also a great drama within. The 3D is one of the greatest ever!!! In the 2D feature disc there's a thoughtful and detailed commentary by Del Toro about the making of the movie and the influences he had. And also an hour long set of extras. In the 2nd disc the diary of the director (an interactive featurette with over 45 minutes of material), a gag reel, deleted scens and many more.

The CGI is good and the special effects but the story is boring and the actors must be secondary types that were kept for ""B"" style movies like this. Now the earth has been plagued by monsters the size of Godzilla and have been terrorizing the globe for years and these robots much like ""Transformers"" and equal in size to the invaders have to go out on missions when called and kill the creatures. Inside the robots is two humans who control the machine and learn to engage the enemy with high tech weapons to eliminate each threat when one arises.

He was given the challenge to make a new type of film pertaining to a Japanese cultural fantasy of giant sea monsters. Though critics may not like the fact he represented the culture well, he developed a movie in which the world is largely unreal. More than half of what you see is CG. There's a few behind the scenes videos that demonstrate what some of these fake scenes are but the fact is, most of it looks real to the untrained eye. It's an amazing feat and I enjoyed it.

As someone who has seen this in 3D IMAX and on 3D TV's and 3D projectors, the rating of this movie really does drop from a 5 star to a 3 star when viewed on a smaller screen.

This movie is NOT what Transformers should have been! It's a pathetic attempt of Hollywood's to compete with Michael Bay's film and it bombed. BAD. To give you an overview of it, it's like Transformers meets Godzilla, but without any sort of originality whatsoever. Thing only thing good about this movie is the end, that's it. Everything else is just simply terrible. Here is what makes the movie so terrible: two people (TWO PEOPLE) have to operate that machine you see on the coverbox. One operates the right side of the machine's brain and his/her partner operates the left side and their machine is only as operational as to how compatible their minds are together. WTF kind of ridiculous overly complex crap is that?! So if the two people operating the machine hate each other eternally, they are simply SOL. Like I said, this movie is NOT what Transformers should have been because it sucks!

The awesome special effects of the Kaiju were just drowned out by the innumerable plot holes and inconsistencies. I've read that this movie was paying homage to great movies past.

5388591,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I didn't give this film four stars for the plot.  Nor did the acting, though at time funny, draw much attention.  These are not what the film puts on display.  For the first time, I giving a genre film the ratting a true fan would give, and will be received by most any viewer of film.  Further, the fact this film wasn't nominated for either Best Visual Effects or Best Cinematography at the Oscars is a crime.

For the longest time, giant machines have been relegated to live action kids shows and cartoons.  Part of this is due to the target audience's willingness to move to a place science based fantasy.  This film is the first to effectively encapsulate this generation's need for scale.  If it's going to be big, if it's going to be threatening, then it needs to be both.  The beasties in this flick are amazing and shown as such a way as being every possible threat: aggressive, large, and calculating.  The human response is adequate to say the least; shown with such furious power as to be double edge swords capable of cutting the whole world.

Fans of Del Torro will not be disappointed.  He isn't done with his style, he's just moving solely to science (see ""Science is Fiction"" if you doubt the magic intrinsic to the field).  His signature can clearly be seen in the internal clockwork of the machines, the creatures themselves being truly magnified beasts that he began with in Hell Boy.  If you remember how dangerous the tooth fairies were at their size, imagine one large enough to rip a building apart.

You will hate Charlie Hunnam's thumbs when this over.  You will wish they were cut off.  The lack of explanation as to how everything in the giant machines work isn't a problem.  The inter relational and character points, though; the figures which viewers are not only support, but identify, is lacking.  True, the characters face tragedy: but how that tragedy effects them is more brought out in the plot than in the actors.  An apples and oranges thing, but at two hours it wouldn't have been hard to get some human development into the technological.",1392163200,,2078,4.6256830601092895

I have to be honest, I didn't love Pacific Rim when I first saw it. Its not that I thought it was bad, but as a child of anime, my expectations were really high. I thought the mech design could have been stronger, and the main character played by Charlie Hunnam was just awful. Part of me wished I was watching Evangelion, while the other part of me was too inebriated to remember most of the movie. To this day Ive been in more arguments about this movie than any other.

It's like the later, we're-not-really-serious Godzilla movies or certain over-the-top anime (and there is much, much more than a little bit of Evangelion in here); if you go into it expecting an art film, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to enjoy some really impressive creature and machine design, some great set work, some funny and very often cheesy characters, and Ron Perlman (and really, we could all use more of that), this won't disappoint.

I don't believe it's a 5-star for everyone; this is a flick that works particularly well for casual science fiction fans. At no point will it challenge you, there will be no deep thoughts resulting directly from the storyline, and while it manages to be moderately clever a couple of times, you won't find yourself blown away by extreme revelations or plot twists.

5388740,3,B00A6UHC0U,"<sigh>.  For some reason, I had made up my mind that I was going to buy this movie, and I was going to love it, despite the fact I had seen almost zero advertisement for it (I had seen the cool movie posters while driving past the theater).  Huge hulking robots typically means great action sequences, bombastic sound effects, and at least an acceptable storyline which would require the typical suspension of disbelief necessary for 90% of action movies.  My wife had warned, ""I think it looks dumb, maybe you should Redbox it first"", but I usually pay her no mind, what does she (a huge K-drama fan) know about good ol' action movies?  So I ordered the movie for myself for Christmas, and I have not been so bored and confused by an action movie in recent history that I can remember.  Here's my take:

Audio/Video (8/10)
The picture quality was excellent.  The CG special effects were nicely done; none stood out as having odd lighting when intermixed with actual set pieces.  The video was sharp and well defined; I do not recall any times when the image was soft and even the dark scenes were  detailed and crisp.  The sound production was typical over the top Hollywood fare, with each combat scene carrying audible heft commensurate with the on screen imagery.  I have to admit I was wanting for more of a sonic impact when the Jaegers were dropped into the water from high up, but none was to be had.  Aside from that, the sound was pretty good.

Story line (6/10) **** POTENTIAL SPOILERS ****
I'm not going to provide any spoilers here, but I will say the story is totally nonsensical, even for a Triple-A Hollywood blockbuster, but worse, the execution of a number of things left me baffled.  It's hard to critique the questionable physics (even within the confines of a typical action movie) without giving too much of the story away, but I will say that the logic behind EMP weapons only affecting ""digital"" Jaegers and not the old ""Analog"" one is ridiculous.  The Jaegers being dropped into the ocean but still walking around, heads well above water didn't make any sense, either.  Also, why did they think a wall was going to stop the enormous and immensely strong Kaiju, considering they had already seen what the creatures were capable of?  Really?  A concrete wall?  Not even an electrified, turret lined, razor wired wall.  Nope, just a plain old giant concrete wall.  Things like this made it difficult for me to enjoy the movie, and I really regret that I paid 20 bux for it; usually I wait til movies are in the $7.88 bin at Wal-Mart, but of course since I didn't listen to my wife, I paid the price (so to speak).  If you're ok with mindless action that not only defies physics but also logic, then by all means buy the movie, but you've been warned.  Leave common sense at the door, sit down and try to enjoy.",1391385600,,2832,4.542406311637081

In fact, the constant display of techno wizardry is a one-trick pony that leaves the cast looking like cartoon characters hanging around from frame to frame waiting to deliver their next line.

All the standard plot gimmicks are here: Team rivalries that are reconciled with heroics, quasi-comical dashes, large gatherings of extras paid to cheer on cue at the success-against-all-odds tactics of the robot crews. And those crews...if stereotyping was illegal, the entire production team would be behind bars.

You've got a Russian team that looks like his-and-hers Billy Idol dolls, a Chinese team that looks like they make tai chi videos for a living, rough and ready Australians, down but not out American underdogs. You get it. This is a movie that prays you won't want to think about anything.

The whole premise was weird and clunky though (it took them years to finally figure out using a sword would be better than the robots fists?), and the whole 2-people to operate the robots while moving like synchronized swimmers was odd in a bad way.",1391299200,,442,4.666666666666667

Despite having some flaws in story this movie is a great action scifi guy flick.  I don't suggest bringing your girlfriend on a first date to this movie though lol.  Overall the movie is well made the action is great and if you ever wanna see a live action anime this is the closest i have seen it.

5388789,4,B00A6UHC0U,"This is an obvious love letter to the infamous cult classic Godzilla & giant monster (Kaiju) movies from Japan. Despite it's jumbled story & stiff acting, Pacific Rim's action scenes & special effects are truly incredible. What I love about Guillermo del Toro's movies is that besides being a massive visionary, he's also a fan first. The guy obviously loves this stuff so who better to handle an homage to giant robots fighting giant monsters than del Toro? Many may think from just a brief glance this is just a conformist reaction to Michael Bay's Transformers trilogy or Marve's live action blockbusters but this is a very different offering than those universe's in that it didn't already have an existing mythology surrounding it. So there are most definitely more stories to be told within the world of Pacific Rim. Since this movie wasn't exactly a big hit, at least not with North American audiences I'm not sure if we'll ever actually get to see a sequel or anything anytime soon. Anyway's, del Toro & company have certainly concocted a mammoth visual feast sure to please many genre fans. So while Edris Elba's anthemic one liner is sure to become a famous quote in pop culture for many years to come this is also a real departure for de Toro's more dark fantasy, pulp fixations of Hellboy & Pan's Labyrinth.

The director does a great job of communicating character information and other narrative elements through concise visuals leaving plenty of time for the real stars of the movie, the ""Tohoesque"" kaiju monsters and the awesome mechs. The battles are splendid and worth multiple views.  I grew up with Godzilla, Gamera, Robotech and Voltron dreaming of a movie like this.",1391126400,,523,5.226190476190476

5388805,5,B00A6UHC0U,Just sit back and enjoy some escapist story telling that combines dinosaurs with robots!  Done by the director Guillermo del Toro who brought us  two Hellboy films and Pan's Labyrinth.  He is a very stylistic director with a real sense of amazement in his film style. This is a movie that ages 10 to grandparent will like if they are young at heart and not afraid of watching a big action special effects movie.,1391040000,,411,4.527027027027027

I watched it twice during my rental period and will probably pick up the physical blu-ray release at some point.  Great movie!",1391040000,,381,4.7846153846153845
5388815,3,B00A6UHC0U,"This was worth watching once, on a slow night. The effects were good, the story was weak though. I didn't feel any real attachment to characters, and I'm still not sure what the invasion was all about to begin with.",1390953600,,215,4.4
5388816,3,B00A6UHC0U,"I'm not a fan of brainless movies. There are very few exceptions and I decided to give Pacific Rim a chance since it was made by an apparently desperate for work Guillermo del Toro playing well outside his comfort zone. His familiar insectoid imagery is briefly present, but for the most part this is new, and unsuitable, ground for him. I understand that he just had to get a big movie done after leaving the Hobbit and so many false starts for his adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness (a film that doesn't really need to exist as John Carpenter's The Thing is about as close as you can get to it) though Pacific Rim was the wrong script to choose.

Set in the near future a portal between our universe and a universe filled with giant monsters opens up beneath the ocean and said monsters barge through and cause mass destruction. Yup, it's yet more 9/11 porn, a sub-genre that was already tiresome and overdone before this movie even came out.

In order to fight the monsters the world government builds giant mechs to dish out a good old clobbering, sometimes with the help of a handy container ship just sitting nearby. The mechs are piloted mainly by twins or by close siblings who can symbiotically fight back using opposite hemispheres of the brain. As expected there is conflict between the pilots and disrespect for authority in between smash-ups.

The actors are mainly cursory as without them the movie would be entirely CGI. The Japanese chick is hot, but Charlie Hunnam is neither good nor terrible, and I really don't understand the hype built around Idris Elba. The only ones I liked were Ron Perlman's black market dealer and Charlie Day as the excitable scientist.

At 131 minutes the movie is overlong and there are a few small scenes that could have snipped. There are also a few scenes that have been shamelessly lifted straight out of Independence Day. With a careless $190 million dollar budget Pacific Rim was lucky to not bomb as bad a predicted. This really, really is not intelligent sci-fi. It's braindead, candy-colored mayhem for angry teens with ADHD. I am so surprised that del Toro would make a movie like this, the material is beneath him.

The Blu-ray looks very nice in 1.78:1 1080p in plain 2D with DTS HD-MA 7.1 sound and lots of extras.",1390953600,,2280,4.647642679900744

5388819,4,B00A6UHC0U,The only reason I am giving it 4 instead of five stars is because the steaming lagged a couple times while watching it.,1390953600,,119,4.217391304347826
5388820,4,B00A6UHC0U,The action is this movie is superb.  The huge Intelligent aliens the soldiers deal with really put fear in the hearts of all involved.  Great movie!!!,1390953600,,150,4.730769230769231
5388821,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I love this movie. It shares a trait with another awesome scifi film I have called Cloud Atlas, that trait being that multiple viewings are required to get your head around everything that is going on. This movie is much more action oriented than Cloud Atlas, however. The sheer scale of everything... the cityscapes, the huge mechas, the interdimensional monsters, the street scenes, the costuming, and more are a wonder to behold. The acting is first class as well. I've not read the comic on which this film is based. But if you like hard science fiction, then you need this movie in your collection.",1390953600,,603,4.752380952380952

5388823,1,B00A6UHC0U,"I fully admit to watching this because I wanted to see a topless Charlie Hunnam.  I was successful in that (as well as Warlowe from True Blood, which was also nice).  I also wanted to watch a Japanese Monster Movie style film, and that was largely unsuccessful except for a few ocean scenes and one okay city scene.

But as I watched the movie it became abundantly clear that the makers/producers/casting directors have something against women.

In the entire movie, there is only ONE woman - and she never ONCE stands on her own two feet.  She goes from being attached to her foster parent to being attached to (the admittedly very attractive) Charlie Hunnam.

There are NO other women in this movie.  No scientists, no other pilots, no control room operators - NONE.  In a hundred different places it would have been realistic to cast women but the makers of the movie clearly didn't see it that way.

It gets one star not due to acting or effects, but for its blatant sexism.",1390953600,,978,4.574712643678161

Other than the fight sequences between the Jaeger's and Kaiju, the character development lacks, and the instances of action are regularly cut short by weak attempts to develop the lore of the movie. The movie is fun, but could have developed its characters better, and given the supporting Jaegers more screen time!",1390867200,,480,5.0125

5388843,5,B00A6UHC0U,"This movie is such a rarity.  I cannot believe for a moment that del Toro pitched this movie the same way he directed it, because I don't think any studio would have greenlit it.  It's not a safe choice for a US release, and in fact, it only made back it's rather sizable($190 million) budget due to worldwide box office sales.  But man, what a glorious gamble.

This movie made me feel like a kid again.  It was like watching Gundam and Godzilla for the first time, at the SAME TIME.  Characters are simple, the story is simple, and there are no answers to any complex questions.  Giant monsters are attacking, and the only way to defeat them is with giant robots.  That's it, in a nutshell.  There's some admirable(though a little sappy) drama for most of the movie, but the first ten minutes pulls you in and pumps you up enough to stick around for the mind-blowing climax.

For anime fans, no, this is not like a live-action Evangelion.  For everyone else, it's not just another attempt at a US Godzilla.  It's Pacific Rim, and it's AWESOME.",1390780800,2,1045,4.5

My girlfriend had already fallen asleep (and she normally loves these types of movies too).  I equate this to Power Rangers with better graphics.  The acting was very sub-par with rigid, forced dialogue.  My girlfriend is convinced it's just a remake of Top Gun (I think the pilot rivalry gave her that, although she has a valid point).  It's like this was supposed to be a fun movie, but everyone takes themselves to seriously in spite of the bad acting and lack of depth.  I'm still not sure if the 2 ""mad scientists"" were there for comedic relief, or if I was supposed to take them seriously (and I'm a huge Charlie Day fan, but this was a terrible fit for him).  Overall, I would NOT recommend this, it wasn't worth my time.",1390780800,4,888,4.438271604938271

It is curious but every day in the movie (except the last one) seemed to be a very rainy day. It left us feeling that we should grab an umbrella :)
Well, in the other hand, there is an incredible amount of destruction. My honest advice for pacifist people is that it may not be a good option but in the other hand, it presents very nice how humanity can come together to protect our world.",1390694400,,522,4.077669902912621

5388850,5,B00A6UHC0U,Not one for writing reviews I actually usually am not that good at it. That being said I never heard of this movie till it was released on blu ray . I then rented it for movie night and we all though it was great. Actually better than expected. I then went out and bought it on blu ray. Visuals are beautiful not a cheap looking movie at all. I recommend at least renting this for the action and effects.,1390694400,,404,4.0625

5388852,4,B00A6UHC0U,It's a decent robot action movie that hearkens back to older horror / monster movies. Having a crazy Aussie in it is just icing on the cake :),1390694400,,142,4.107142857142857

5388855,3,B00A6UHC0U,"Ok, I like movies that suspend ""science"" and are just fun.  2012, Battleship, Battle LA, just to name a few.  But this one I couldn't stomach.  At end just felt like I wasted 2 hours in which I could have played World of Tanks.  Throughout it, my kids kept joking from the line from Starship Trooper ""Johny, Johny, at least I had you"".  (Forgive if misquoted, but you get the idea).  This is one when you REALLY have nothing else to do.",1390608000,,436,4.2560975609756095

5388860,4,B00A6UHC0U,On the surface Pacific Rim is the perfect male movie; giant robots fighting giant monsters.  What more could you need?  For those that need a touch more than just action there are some great characters and an interesting story underneath that may hook you.  At least right up until the typical odd ball scientist guys/comic relief that is almost cringe worthy.,1390608000,,360,4.868852459016393

5388871,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Fun movie and the blu ray disc used a great print of the movie. This was on sale over the holidays so I figured what would be better on blu ray than giant robots, big monsters and wanton destruction? And I was right.

Sure, the story's pretty lackluster and has plot holes you could drive a Jaeger through, but you're there for the monsters and the combat anyway, and it has that in droves.",1390435200,,390,4.27027027027027
5388872,3,B00A6UHC0U,"I start to think that I've watched too many movies or read too many books because I have a hard time enjoying sci-fi flicks.  I question why the hell, if creatures started appearing in the ocean, the solution would be to make huge robots, on huger budgets, rather than invest all that money in a detection system and a bunch of high power torpedoes/traps/rail guns/stun gun or anything else that would be more practical.

But then I realize that there area sci-fi movies that have a good enough story line that I don't question the practicality because it's just a good movie (The Fifth Element, Oblivion, Original Star Wars, The Last Star Fighter).

The special effects were great, the justification of the robots and story line, not so much.",1390435200,,743,4.744186046511628
5388873,4,B00A6UHC0U,"As a young lad in his twenties that enjoys fiction and isn't too critical when it comes to movies. I can say that this movie is a solid 8 on a scale of 10. What I noticed was that some parts of the movie reminded me of Neon Genesis Evangelion which is an animated movie by a well known japanese story teller. What I also noticed was that I wasn't the only one who shared this view. Just search ""pacific rim is the movie of evangelion"" ,on google, then, you'll see what I'm talking about.
I love when a movie makes me feel like I'm watching a true story unfold right before my eyes and Pacific Rim does just that...the plot, setting and acting are all well above average. There's a hint of comedy at the later half which deters one from taking it too seriously but it's still enjoyable nontheless.",1390435200,,796,4.2781456953642385
5388874,3,B00A6UHC0U,Worth watching for the special effects but if you rely upon the story writing you will be disappointed. Would recommend watching.,1390435200,,129,5.190476190476191

5388880,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Honestly my first viewing of this film was in a drive-in. Although enjoyable I really didn't get all the hype about it being the most amazing movie of the summer. After seeing it in 3D with high quality audio, I'm much more on par with it being a great visual feast for the eyes. I still don't think it is better than star trek into darkness or iron man 3 for summer 2013 crown, but it is a great action movie as long as the giant robots and monsters are on the screen.
Particles and Debris come out at you very nicely but the power of the 3D here is its amazing depth in most every scene that really brings you into that world.

But then I started think what if I sat closer...like 5-6 feet. I can honestly say I was impressed.  When they were inside any room, I felt like I was ""in"" there with them. The depth of the space was incredible.  As I stared at the screen and due to sitting so close I had to keep my eyes moving trying and wanting to see everything ""in"" the screen and what was going on. This is the best of the 3D's I have seen so far; including Hobbit(3.5star) and Avatar (4star).",1390262400,,640,3.984375

5388899,3,B00A6UHC0U,The film is entertaining enough to hold your interest. I found the story line and acting to be adequate. This film won't win any awards (unless it's in the CGI category). But if you are into sci-fi action you'll like this move.,1390262400,,227,4.428571428571429

5388901,1,B00A6UHC0U,"Oh my, pretty underwhelming.  Silly story line, mediocre acting.  Seemed pointless.  More like a vehicle for special effects graphics team to flex their muscle and make the next fight sequence more outrageously silly and noisy than the last.  The unending cloning of various upgrades of the of the outsized alien life forms was preposterous.  The robots were out-fought and outclassed all the way through the movie by these slimy Godzilla-sized aliens.  Only the brainy nerds saved the day....and mercifully stopped the clock on the next generation of Kaiyu.  I gave it a full one star just because I like sci-fi and action.  This one was loud and over the top and the intended romantic interludes equally unmoving.  All this joy and way over-long as well.",1390176000,,756,4.984

If you are into anime, then this is your wet dream. Visually stunning with great humor and a reasonably put together story. Plus FIGHTING ROBOTS. OK, if you want to get technical they are not Robots, but rather 'mechs'. Monstrously gigantic Robotic exo-skeletons. Massively powerful, so powerful it take two pilots who are mind-melded to operate them.

First of all, if there is only 1 portal that the aliens emerge, why build robots all over the world? You know where they will come from, put the robots together to fight together. Secondly, why build robots at all? If the canons on their chest are so strong, why not outfit 100 of those to surround the portal and blow up anything that comes through? I could keep going.

The acting was weak, the story had little thought put into it, and even the dialogue was predictable. Only get this movie if you want to see some nice graphics. But if you want to actually watch a movie...you know, with some story line and 5th grade level or above dialogue, then pass on this one. It sucked.",1390089600,2,784,4.297297297297297

5388915,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Boys love two things.  Robots and Dinosaurs.  This film piles on generous helpings of both.  In a film that elilcits memories of the animated adventures of ""Voltron"", director Guilerrmo del Toro takes us on a wild ride into the not -too-distant future where a global threat forces humanity to band together to defend ourselves against annhilation.  The effects are stunning, the plot engaging, and the performances are quite good considering the volume of green screen shots used.  The teaser just before the opening title, depicting the initial attacks of the monster ""Kaiju's"" and the international response to create the massive ""Jaegers"" to defeat the invaders, was painfully short and didn't paint a full picture of our species being pushed to the brink of extinction.  I was hoping to see more deleted scenes either inserted into the theatrical version or as a special bonus feature, but I was disappointed.  Still, the extras on the Blu Ray and 2 disc DVD version are interesting.  They give you insights into everything from creature and robot design to how they shot the ""drift"" memory sequences.  You learn that nothing you see on screen is there just by luck or chance.  Every aspect is meticulously planned to elicit a desired response.  The only negative in the film is Charlie Day's character.  A brilliant, yet misguided 'Kaiju Groupie', he squawks his way through the film and is relied upon to uncover the secrets of the invaders that will ultimately lead to their defeat.  Frankly, I wouldn't trust him to program my remote.  I love this film and have watched it multiple times, but have routinely skipped over scenes with Charlie Day as the main focus.",1390003200,,1671,4.942652329749104

5388917,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim begins with a grumpy voice tellings about things that have come before, as if this was the second film in a series requiring an explanation for those who hadn't seen the preceding film.  But the joke's on us, there is no preceding film; they just decided to start things in the middle.  And proceeded to throw us into the middle of a war of sorts between the Kaijus (space thingies living in the earth) and humans slapped into big robots called Jaegers.  Most of the battles take place at night, during storms, so little can be seen.  The monsters aren't shown in their full glory long enough to enjoy their lovely fierceness, just bits and pieces glimpsed during frenzied fight sequences.  I felt cheated.  Even Godzilla appears in the all together during his films, if that was Guillermo del Toro's inspiration why so coy when dealing with the beasties from a breach in the bottom of the sea?  To make matters worse, there really isn't much in the way of dialog and most of that is macho posturing along the lines of ""I've got this!""  The characters aren't fully realized, just the usual types you'd expect to find in this type of film.  Yes, the film looks good, when they actually bother to light things so that you can see them.  What's the point in having all that fancy hardware and snazzy FX if you're just going to shove it into a standard plot, basically just a couple of fights strung together.  Yes, there was a brief political component early on but then they breezily dismissed it and never got back to it.  They say there's going to be a sequel, which begs the question why?  There was very little plot involved in this one, what more could they possibly not say in the next film?

Still.  Because I am a big Godzilla fan, and because this sort of, kind of, in a roundabout fashion, reminded me of those much loved films, I am embarrassed to admit I liked the darn thing in spite of its many short comings.  I am keeping it and I will watch it again.  If they manage to cough up a sequel I will want that one too, sight unseen (because at this point I pretty much know what to expect).",1390003200,,2112,4.402061855670103

There were a few standard cliches that you see in these kinds of movies but it was still enjoyable. The part that irritated me the most was in on particular scene, after already getting their ass kicked by the Kaiju, the humans suddenly remember their robot has a giant sword and use it to cut the things head off. I thought, why the hell wouldn't you just use the sword in the first place? They spent so much time trying to punch the stupid monster in the face with their robot arms with no effect but the sword worked with no issue.

Overall I defiantly recommend it. It was like they took an old Godzilla movie and made it 100% less crappy and with great special effects.",1389916800,,753,4.265734265734266

The first thirty minutes or so started ok but then took a turn for the worse with the slow get to know the characters I could care less about or care to know there names. The brother dying cliche on top of the disgruntled soldier being called back cliche(Rambo) to the nerdy scientists that one reminded me of Bob ""cat"" Goldwaith to the so called English scientist out of Harry Potter. Throw in the Japanese ninja to replace the dead brother as new partner. I almost stopped watching the film at many places out of boredom until Ron Perlman showed up wearing steel pointed boots the I turned it off in disgust. The accents were bad the actors seemed to be thinking of somewhere else they would rather be, the plot was lame.

I thought the story line was quite compelling, which is pretty unusual for a ""monster"" movie.  A typical ""monster"" story is contrived to simply fit into the spaces between the monster fights.  But this storyline had an interesting background, and enough unexpected twists to keep up interest until the very end.  That can be said for the characters, too--they are not cookie-cutter predictable (even though they conform to certain stereotypes).  Pacific Rim is filled with all kinds of personalities, and all kinds of motivations. The acting was also surprisingly good.  And that brings us to . . . the action sequences.  They are stunning and well-crafted.  Editing is not too choppy--you can actually tell what is going on even when motion is fast.  CGI is really good, the creatures are interesting and creative.  Overall, I liked this movie WAY better than the series where vehicles ""transform"" themselves into robots (that was just several hours of confusing special effects with no story to justify it).  This was a real story, about a real crisis, told with great creativity and awesome effects.",1389916800,,1230,4.946341463414634

The action was well-choreographed and mostly comprehensible (unlike any of Michael Bay's big robot flicks), the effects were suitably realistic and the story had the epic tone the subject matter demands.

This was about seeing years of CGI development finally pay off and letting us see Giant robots punch Giant monsters in the face. Beautifully detailed and realistic too, texture-wise that is. Though I agree that it was a super simplistic story, the fact is, it was meant to be. Del Toro has admitted that this movie was meant to amaze children and the child within us. That's why it wasn't the super cool dark movie with major carnage and death everywhere. It's fine. The way I seen it, this is the first step in the path of a new generation of giant robot and monster movies. From these early pioneers we will learn what works and what needs improvement. So hopefully one day we will get amazingly long and detailed battles with heavy losses on both sides, and hopefully more than one hero/survivor nation. Look Forward to IT!

5388989,2,B00A6UHC0U,"I didn't get into this story. I couldn't accept drifting, the mech robots, the kaiju-like creatures, nor the subterranean world.  Also, the dialog was corny for me.  The conversations between the over-acting characters and their responses didn't feel like realistic talking.

The technology used to operate Jaegers was unbelievable and weird.  Additionally, their nuclear weapons could have worked from real-world nuclear subs, carriers, aircraft and satellite-guided missiles of today which are very accurate and can track targets.  So the movie didn't convince me of the premise the traditional military failed and humans needed collateral-damage-producing Jaegers.  It seemed like the filmmakers wanted another transformer-style movie and was forcing this new idea for a movie. I appreciate new ideas and creativity; but I liked Battleship, Matrix and Transformer film series more which had fighting machines and better writing and story-telling techniques.",1389484800,,960,5.870503597122302

5388991,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim is one of those summer blockbusters that I regretted not making more of an effort to see on the big screen. It's clearly designed for the big screen, featuring gigantic monsters (called kaiju and similar to King Kong, Godzilla, and the classic Japanese movie monsters) and robots (called jaeger, though they are much larger than any Transformers or other such big screen robots) who battle in the waters and the great cities of the Pacific Ocean. Everything is larger than life.

The story follows jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket who fights a kaiju near Alaska. In the battle, the brother is torn from the jaeger they co-pilot and he dies. Since they pilot the machine through a psychic link (which doesn't make a lot of sense but is a dramatic contrivance to make the movie more exciting) he experiences his brother's death more deeply. Raleigh retires from piloting and becomes a drifter, working on the gigantic fences being built on Pacific coastlines to stop the kaiju from attacking. He's called back to piloting when the jaeger program is on its last legs. Marshall Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) runs the program and wants to make one last ditch effort to close the rift in the bottom of the Pacific from which the kaiju are emerging. Raleigh needs a new partner and the respect of the other jaeger pilots if the mission is to be a success.

The story is fairly boiler-plate and the characters are not very deep at all. The real enjoyment of the movie is seeing the jaegers and the kaiju fighting in Hong Kong or in the ocean or under the ocean in the finale where they try to close the rift. The movie delivers in spades on this front. The kaiju are imaginative and make a great menace. The robots are as big as buildings and tear through property and kaiju with amazing visuals. Gone are the days of guys in rubber Godzilla suits trashing models of Tokyo. This movie looks great. Also, the design of the kaiju and the jaegers are a departure for del Toro, whose work is often very recognizable--Cronos, the Hellboy movies, Pan's Labyrinth, and a few other of his previous works definitely have a similar aesthetic which is not continued in Pacific Rim.

The movie also keeps a good sense of humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously and finds plenty of light moments. There are nice visual references to other previous works like Jurassic Park and Voltron and other genre classics. Unlike World War Z, these references are fleeting and fun--not a distraction but a grin. Much like Rise of the Planet of the Apes, this movie is a lot better than I was expecting. I recommend it as good popcorn-munching fun. This is what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be like.",1389484800,,2684,4.6701902748414374

5389009,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I should say that I'm not a huge fan of science fiction (my experience is pretty limited to Firefly and a handful of other shows that don't quite count as science fiction), nor have I seen any del Toro films until Pacific Rim. I'm a film studies major though, so when a friend recommended it to me, I rented it. I watched it once and knew what I was going to get my dad for Christmas. I watched it again, and knew what I wanted for Christmas.

Here's the gist: it's 2025 and the world (specifically the countries bordering the Pacific Ocean) has been ravaged by attacks from monsters, Kaijus, that are coming from a breach in the Pacific Ocean to inhabit Earth because we've ""terraformed"" it for them with our pollution (the film does NOT focus on that idea, though). People designed huge machines, Jaegers, to combat them and they were doing pretty well up until the monsters started adapting to their fight methods. The Jaeger program is on the fritz. Basically, all signs are pointing to everyone winding up Kaiju snacks.

I usually try to avoid films that point towards apocalypse - I didn't watch Armageddon for years because of it - but Pacific Rim is different. It does exactly what a film is supposed to do. It establishes the world and the situation well, and there is tension in every scene - from Raleigh and Yancy vs. Knifehead to Herc and Chuck's argument in the Jaeger. Every character is established well just by their first appearance and the film doesn't stray from their characterization (I'm a big stickler for continuity, especially about characters, so I loved this). They aren't crude, either (save for maybe Chuck but he's the lovable jerk...right?), which is awesome.

The sole female character (save for the female Kaidonovsky) is a badass and she's never looked at as a sexual object, she's viewed as a person. When Stacker won't let her pilot a Jaeger, it's not because she's a woman and she might not be able to handle it, or because she's weak, it's because she has a motive that could threaten the whole mission. Okay, I could write whole books about Mako, so I'll stop there, but she's amazing.

In terms of plot, characters, and theme, it surprised me how well it did for a sci-fi film. I wouldn't say it's character-driven, but the characters are certainly a plus (did I mention Charlie Hunnam's shirtless? A lot? Charlie Hunnam's shirtless a lot.).

As for how it's directed, it doesn't get distracting with any strange camera angles or Michael Bay-esque explosions. There are a few sequences that I had trouble focusing on, simply because it's dark and there are many things going on. The special effects are, of course, amazing. The Kaijus are intricately designed yet terrifying, and the Jaegers are awesome (wait till you find out how they work, it's cool and also curiously sentimental).

The special effects give a look into the designing of the Jaegers and the Kaijus, and you can see just how devoted del Toro was to this project. There are only a handful of deleted scenes, which was somewhat disappointing to me. However, the other special insights in the interviews and features on the second disc are definitely worth it for anyone interested in the world of Pacific Rim.

In a nutshell, this is probably one of the best films I've watched in a while. Had I known I would love it so much, I would have gone to see it in 3D.",1389312000,,3369,4.652100840336135

5389011,2,B00A6UHC0U,"First, the good.  This movie is pretty.

The monsters and mechs look cool.  The CGI is solid.  And the tech is neat to look at.

Not cool to think about, mind you, because it makes no sense...but it's pretty.

Now, the bad.  And that's everything else.

Despite a cool premise (a dimensional-rift beneath the ocean allows monsters to invade), the plot is ridiculous and lacks any form of believability.  The script is terrible and disjointed.  The acting--despite featuring a bunch of genre actors I love--is awful.

And, worst of all, the thing you want most out of the movie--giant monsters and robots fighting--is relegated to back-burner so that nonsensical interpersonal developments can eat-up the bulk of the screen-time.

So ask yourself: why are you buying the movie?

If it's to see a half-baked romance awkwardly evolve between two socially-outcast characters who are thrust together for no good reason, then go ahead.

If you, like me, want instead to watch the action movie the trailers promised, then skip it.  You won't get more than a sip of combat to use for washing-down the rest of the horrid-tasting emo story.",1389312000,,1130,4.9361702127659575

This guy has got to have the most annoying voice in film or TV -- he doesn't read his lines, he screeches them!  He ruined many a scene for me, but thankfully, there is fast forward.

Other than that, the film is not bad.  The first 20 minutes or so is just mindless action, but after that a story of sorts settles in and takes over.  For some reason, I found the action sequences to be a bit difficult to follow.  I'm guessing here but it may be that the film's aspect ratio was 1:85 and the 1:78 BD rendering on a 71"" screen makes it seem like a pan-and-scan.

5389084,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Honestly, for me there is literally nothing not to like in this movie. It's about humanity inexplicably deciding that the best course of action upon giant monster/alien invasion was to create giant monsters to beat them to smithereens.

We've got Charlie Hunnam, whose character abandons the man-pain endemic to this genre and instead follows his copilot like a puppy.

We've got Rinko Kikuchi, who beats Charlie Hunnam in a fight and kicks butt in general and gets taken in by Idris Elba.

We've got Idris Elba. Enough said there.

There's a great mix of characters and a lot of detail that makes the world they've created so much more realistic. It's not an America-centric world. It's barely even an English-centric world. It's multicultural, multi-lingual, monster-punching goodness.

Also featuring: Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as bickering odd-couple scientists (tattooed and disabled no less!), Australians with short tempers, very attractive bleached-blond Russians, Chinese triplets (actually played by triplets!), and a black market dealer who named himself Hannibal Chau for basically no reason.

Highly recommend. Everybody needs to watch this movie.",1388880000,,1162,5.5

What it lacks in dept it has in doing everything real well. This certainly won't be movie of the year. It is damn near there for the quality, much like The Avengers. It has so many damn things that are refereshing in it. Not because it is new, but just because it is so well done. This isn't a movie for all, and many won't enjoy the ride.

The special effects were well done.  And the director and writer surprisingly spent a lot of time to build up the main characters.  It definitely made the movie much more enjoyable.

The fighting though suffers a little from the same idiosyncrasy as many monster fighting shows.  The selection of moves and weapons seemed amateurish.  Anyway, they all have these problems.",1388880000,,550,4.9021739130434785
5389095,2,B00A6UHC0U,"I had to think long and hard before giving GDT's Pacific Rim the negative review it so richly (and regrettably) deserves. The film begs the question as to whether a movie can be so gorgeous to look at and listen to, that whatever flaws exist can be overlooked -- or if the reverse is true -- that a film's plot elements can be so egregiously insulting of a viewer's intelligence, that regardless of how breathtaking the visual effects, how great the sound, the artistry, even the acting -- that this easily forgettable movie is barely worth one's time, let alone money. I chose to go with my latter assessment, and this coming from a huge fan of GDT's other great works such as Blade 2, Pan's Labyrinth, and Hellboy 1&2. It's as though someone handed Del Toro a blank check -- carte blanche, as they say, and told him to create the most raucous, outrageous, utterly over-the-top, beautifully rendered CGI, but nonsensical epic spectacle that money can buy. As a result, he exceeded all expectations, I'm sure. All but my own and some others, I suspect, who just couldn't get past the idea that we were watching little more than glorified boxing matches between a bunch of Godzilla retreads (some kind of hybrid mix of toad, dinosaur, and chameleon) and Michael Bay's Transformers minus the racing stripes and radial tires.

Rather than write out my long list of complaints in this one review -- a list, by the way, that is only slightly larger than my equally long list of compliments -- I'll limit myself to the one flaw that, for me, stood out from all the rest. And so ruined my enjoyment of the movie that I cannot recommend it. Once the realization occurs to you, as it did to me, early on in the film, then except for the abundant eye candy -- and it is abundant -- the balance of the movie was somewhat painful to sit through.

The flaw to which I refer relates to how the filmmakers want us to buy into the manner in which a futuristic, tech-savvy Earth defends itself against an onslaught of giant creatures. Instead of building weapons on a scale to match the invaders' size and strength -- the monsters are little more than huge, non-technical lizards with a couple of biological tricks up their scales -- what do the clever little humans do? Instead of giant Gatling guns that fire long range missles, or pilotless drones carrying tiny tactical nukes, or any number of other weapons to which naked, flesh and blood bodies are totally vulnerable, the earthlings build manned (and womaned) giant robots who use fists and big swords and lots of flashing lights to wrestle with the enemy monsters. Oh, and our robots are good at boxing, too, as they throw wicked punches and jabs at their opponents. The only thing missing was a referee and ring announcer. What's not so funny is that readers of this review who haven't seen the film probably think I'm kidding or exaggerating. Unfortunately I'm not at all. If anything, I'm understating the case. The unforgivable, almost unconscionable silliness I'm trying to describe is so played for real in the movie (and done so well), that one almost forgets, at times, that only a 13-year-old would find such nonsense believable. No wonder the movie's rating seemed so appropriate.

In listening to a good portion of Del Toro's running commentary, in which he discusses the film in unabashedly glowing terms (it is his film, I guess) I wasn't all that surprised to hear his myopic descriptions of the movie's artistic qualities, and so very little about the storyline itself. Del Toro absolutely adored all the stark contrasts between little people and big machines and monsters. And how the lighting was so atmospheric and realistic and exciting. Someone, at some point during the making of the film, needed to shout out, ""Hey, Guillermo, everything looks great, but your story sucks!""

Well, no one apparently wanted to lose their job, and the story is what it is. What a shame. And what a shameful waste of all the indisputable genius that went into so many aspects of what could have been a classic. But instead, I believe Pacific Rim will be quickly forgotten, dismissed, and soon relegated to a role of simply having paved the way for much better films with vastly superior plots.",1388793600,,4236,4.72027027027027

I will not review the movie since its been done countless times already. Instead, Ill review this bluray/dvd combo release. The video quality is superb as is the sound. There are a ridiculous amount of extras in this release. Tt includes a disc of extra features only but the movie disc has quite a bit of extras in it as well. The case and artwork are beautiful, with an outer slipcase featuring a changing image of the main Mecha and a monster.

However many Pacific Rim super fans will tell you there is some deep subtext in this movie. They are telling you that a shrub is actually a majestic redwood forest. The plot is a mish-mash of Saturday morning cartoons and has enough holes to strain pasta with. The acting is bland but inoffensive with the exception of Idris Elba who is a consummate professional and Charlie Day in an extremely forced ""I'm the comic relief watch me be whacky""  role that is grating to watch. Unfortunately even the monsters that were supposed to be homages to the old ""kaiju"" creations from Japan are forgettable and without any of the charm of the classic movie monsters you'd find in the old Godzilla movies.

The opening scene is put together quite well, except for a line that was completely ripped off of Star War's Hon Solo.  After that scene however, the movie goes off the deep end.  There is about 40 minutes of extremely dull, nothing put boring, sloppily put together scenes.  The plot development in these scenes is little to none.  Finally, after what seems like a lifetime, we get to see some action.  And then some more.  And more.  And even more.  At this point you wish it was over, only to check and find you still have an hour more of this torture to sit through.  There are way too many action scenes, so many you are watching them bored out of your mind.  And the slow scenes?  Even worse.  Script is crap, and you can only wish it was over faster.  Plot development is very poor, comic relief unsatisfying.  If you want good special effects that match up to this, (and far surpass) watch Gravity.  Overall, I felt cheated after watching this movie.

the main characters are all pompous jerks that ignore the concerns of others ... apparently because they are the only ones in the world good enough to drive the robots which amounts to not much more than playing a video game. they disregard the safety of others, they get in fist fights over girls. i actually got mad at how bad it was. after the movie, i had a talk w/ my son explaining that's not how successful people act / interact with each other. it's that bad.

the guys are in constant conflict, until some point when one decides to sacrifice his life for the other.

then there's the girl, which despite being so weak she would faint whenever she got jacked into the robot, was apparently the best choice out of billions of people in the world. no worries though as she had several big strong muscular guys to fight over her.

the special effects impressed me at first, but by the end of the movie, i was just thinking that i'd seen this before, when i was a kid watching the old godzilla movies where two guys got in rubber suits and battled it out.",1388707200,3,1299,4.333333333333333

The special effects and sound are amazing, but otherwise this is one of the cheesiest movies I've ever watched.  It's basically like watching an episode of power rangers but with more money put behind it.  I guess all of the people who gave this movie 5 stars did so because they just like action and don't care too much about much else.

When I rented this, I knew I wasn't getting a realistic drama, but good lord -- from dialogue that is unbelievably embarrassing, to the fight scenes that just go on and on back and forth destroying cities...at times, like when the scientists would be bickering back and forth, I'd laugh to myself.

Final words: if you like power rangers or other such childish stories about monsters with really good CGI, then you'll like this movie.  But, if you have problems with cheesy dialogue and silly explanations regarding technology and gizmos and countless things that happen that defy the laws of physics, I wouldn't bother.

I do not like to post negative reviews because it just isn't any fun.  But I really wished I didn't purchase it - I will never view it again.  2 hours and 12 minutes LOST Forever!  The greater disappointment to me about the movie itself, is the fact that, it was directed by Guillermo del Toro - I am usually FASCINATED by his work. Pan's Labyrinth was truly inspired - speaking of that (2006) I think I will purchase it on Amazon's Prime.  Back to Guillermo del Toro he did masterful work with ""Hellboy II, The Golden Army"" as well as ""Blade II.""

5389144,5,B00A6UHC0U,"For pure entertainment value, Pacific Rim is the best science fiction film of 2013.

The movie is set a decade in the future when major coastal cities are under attack by Kaijus, giant monsters that enter our world through a portal in the Pacific Ocean. Since there is a genuine threat of total annihilation, governments across the world come together to invest in weaponry to combat these aliens. Traditional warfare techniques are insufficient against the Kaijus, so engineers develop Jaegers, huge machines that require two or more pilots to operate them through a neurological link. As crude as all these plot points might sound, the movie executes them extremely well and still has heart and humor.

If Pacific Rim is one part monster movie, featuring dynamic battle sequences between Kaiju and Jaeger, it is also one part buddy film. It is about friendship and the indescribable, deep connections between two different people in the face of resistance, both internal and external. For people to become co-pilots of a Jaeger, they must be mentally and emotionally compatible (called drift-compatible in the film). Many successful Jaeger pilots are siblings or related in some other way, but this is not necessary. Our primary heroes (two of many) in the film come from vastly different backgrounds but share the same sense of honor and bear the same burden of survivor's guilt. There is something beautiful about the way the film portrays friendship and trust, and the humility needed to maintain synchronicity between people.

While Pacific Rim is derivative of giant monster greats, it still manages to be fresh and earnest (which is more than can be said of most films in comic book-, remake- and sequel-laden Hollywood). My one regret with this film is that I did not see it in all its glory on the big screen.",1388620800,,1819,4.9769736842105265

Despite that, the movie had a good story. Surprisingly good for a movie like this. That is what made the movie worth watching. The action was paced well. It wasn't non-stop fighting, but it was sprinkled in with the plot very well.

Now, this is not to say the story was Casablanca good. It had a few worn-out cliches. For example: the father and son realize how much they love each other in the end. You also had the hard-nosed but wise boss make the ultimate sacrifice in the end cliche. Certain things were predictable. And there were flaws. If your robot has a sword, WHY DIDN'T YOU USE IT AT FIRST! For that matter, what doesn't every robot have a sword!

Still, the overall story was good. Some movies this long I find myself bored with. Not this movie, the plot continued to move forward, it did not drag on, and so I never was waiting for it to get to the point. If you like action movies, you will like this movie.",1388534400,,1072,4.409090909090909

The 3D is excellent in this movie and genuinely adds to the overall enjoyment of the movie.

5389182,5,B00A6UHC0U,"It becomes difficult to pick a movie to write about when two fantastic movies both become available the same week. You have to choose one. So let me say THE HEAT is one of the funniest movies made in some time (though filled with the F bomb). That being said let me get to my pick for best new movie on DVD, PACIFIC RIM.

PACIFIC RIM did fantastic box office around the world but never quite caught on here in the US. That's sad because this is one amazing movie even with multiple viewings. In the near future a series of giant monsters rises from the Pacific floor to attack various coastal cities world wide. Known as Kaiju (Japanese for ""strange creature"") these monsters that look like a combination of Godzilla, dinosaurs and giant bugs, the world is forced to unite to save the planet.

The United Nations puts together a fighting force of giant robots, known as Jaegers, to combat these creatures. The stress on a single pilot to control these robots is too much and they learn it takes two pilots who can synch up via connections to their brains. One such pilot is Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) who synchs up with his older brother. During a fierce battle their robot is nearly destroyed and his brother is yanked out by the Kaiju they are fighting. Raleigh survives but loses his will to fight.

Five years later and a new problem faces the world. The attacks by the Kaiju are increasing and the robots have been decommissioned since the politicians think a giant wall around each country is the answer. Unfortunately the walls offer little resistance to the Kaiju and the few remaining robots are left to save the planet under the leadership of Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), an ex-warrior and the man who ran the program. Stacker locates Raleigh and brings him back into the program with a plan.

The four remaining robots are to be used to plug the connection between worlds that allows the Kaiju to come over. That is if they can keep the world safe in time to do so. But things are never quite as easy as they seem. A fault in the plan comes along late in the plot, competition between Jaeger pilots arises and a full on attack by the Kaiju results in only two Jaegers left to get the job done. Toss in a scientist who has found a way to mind meld with the Kaiju to get info and you have a very interesting science fiction picture with more action than most movies released these days.

I can't begin to tell you how good this movie is. Even if you're not into giant monsters ala Godzilla you might find yourself loving this one. This is not your man in a bad costume type creature, these things seem real enough to warrant watching more than once with the pause button in hand. The robots are the most awesome creation seen in ages, something that every kid who ever played with toy robots will love.

The look of the film itself is stunning to see. The colors blast off the screen as much as the weapons used in the fights. It's a visual feast for the eyes that will be the second reason to keep the pause button handy. The last movie I remember seeing that used color to this extent was Warren Beatty's DICK TRACY. It virtually pops off the screen.

There isn't a bad performance in this film either. Each and every actor brings believability to their character enough that you root for them to win and mourn their losses when they die. Even the side characters are worth noting here, at least one a regular of director Guillermo del Toro.

When I saw this film in the theater I was stunned by the look, feel and emotions brought out by this film. As I watched the opening sequence at home I couldn't stop smiling. Everything about it felt right. Everything about it felt good. And it was as enjoyable watching this time as it was the first.

At times it almost felt like I was watching a parody of a movie with the same premise. A stunningly gorgeous parody.

5389207,2,B00A6UHC0U,"First off, it was fun to watch.  It brought back lots of memories from childhood.  Any 12 year old will love this movie.  Having said that...

The movie has a neat plot hook, cool robots (called Jagers) fighting huge sea monsters, and larger than life action.  The problem?  Too much homage paid to the old Godzilla films and their ilk, the Saturday morning Kung Fu Theater movies, and the countless Anime robot/monster/power armor/apocalypse cartoons out there.  What made all of those previous things fun for me when I was 12 was the campiness, the low tech, and the wanting and the needing to believe these thing were real.

Ah, but there is the problem.  An A+ budget with all the special FX trimmings you could want.  As an adult I was hoping for an updated version of those wonderful films I loved as a 12 year old that acknowledged its roots but also delivered a movie I could enjoy and get lost in as an adult.  unfortunately the movie delivers a campy, cheesy, Saturday afternoon clich.  Too many problems to name them all, but here are a few:

Why giant robots (other than they do look cool) instead of lots of little ones?  Why are bipedal robots designed to be on dry land fighting sea monsters at sea?  Why aren't there bunker buster style missiles or torpedoes to shoot at them?  Why not design a super sonic drone that can literally fly right through the monsters, thus killing them?  Why do we see the pilots fighting with staffs when not in the Jagers and then have the Jagers armed with blades (a la The Wolverine) that come out of their fore arms?  Why don't any of the robots carry a shield?  Why aren't there layers of turrets at the breach at the ocean floor armed and ready to kill anything that comes out?  Why aren't there armadas of subs on constant patrol?

I know this was an homage to a style and genre of movies and television shows that the movie is obviously based on, but a more serious and better thought out story line and plot would have made all the bad assed huge Jager robots so much cooler to watch.

Yeah, this movie looks like if power rangers had a billion dollar budget and zordon was replaced by the coolest black dude in the world, but this is taken with earnsty.

Pacific Rim is a great popcorn film. The story is present, which is about all I can say about it. The characters are larger-than-life caricatures. The acting is never so bad it's distracting. So what's the draw of this movie? Everything else!
The art, style and special effects are unbelievably gorgeous. Set design is rich with color, texture, and detail. The costumes are beautifully designed and lovingly crafted. The robots and monsters are eye-popping screen candy. The world in Pacific Rim is fully realized and believable despite it's unbelievable premise. All of this attention to detail lends weight to the battles, making them truly breathtaking. In lesser hands, this movie could have easily turned into a hokey SyFy channel movie. But director Guillermo Del Toro knows how to make a special effects film, and jam packs every minute of this movie with pure excitement. Pacific Rim is like nothing else you've seen, and is consistently entertaining throughout.

The blu-ray release does this movie justice and has one of the best digital transfers I've ever seen. The picture is crystal-clear and all the aforementioned detail pops. The audio is also outstanding, and the balance is perfect. Some movies (rarely, but sometimes) have bad audio balance, and the dialogue is too quiet and the sound effects are too loud, forcing me to adjust the volume constantly. Pacific Rim sounds clear and the balance is perfect, whether you're listening to a 7.1 surround sound system or just a simple 2 channel stereo. On the technical side, Pacific Rim's video and audio quality are perfect, giving you the closest experience to theatrical presentation as possible.

The special features are interesting, but nothing really gave me insight into the making of the movie that I couldn't have already guessed. I was a little surprised to see how much of the movie was done with practical effects, and the giant working sets they built for the cockpit scenes was impressive, but otherwise it was the usual behind the scenes fare. The only behind the scenes features I've seen in recent memory that truly surprised me were The Matrix, TinTin and Avatar, because those were pioneering new technology. It is nice to see some of the concept art included in the special features, especially early designs for the Jagers and Kaiju.

If you are trying to decide to buy this movie, then let me ask you this: Have you already seen this movie? If yes, and you enjoyed it, then go ahead and buy the blu-ray. This will give you the best possible presentation and will not disappoint. If no, odds are you're really going to like this movie and you should go ahead and buy it, but if you're really on the fence you may want to rent it first just to be sure it's your cup of tea. Oh, and if you don't yet have a blu-ray player, don't bother getting the DVD only version. You should get the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack so you can watch the DVD now and enjoy the blu-ray when you upgrade to a blu-ray player.

It was definitely worth it! You must, of course, get over the big mechanical thing, and the bizarre monster- yes - you have to call them monsters. If you can, the movie is a lot of fun, and, they even manage to give you a few characters who you can cheer for. It is what a summer movie should be. Lots of action blended with enough character insight to to have you get a little interested in the actual story. There are some great cinematic scenes that I found exceptional, and the thematic music that they put together, also worked very well.

Stop me if you have heard this one before. Who am I kidding we have all heard this one before many times before because action movie.

Bad Boy Hero suffers a loss can't handle doing his hero-ey thing anymore tries to live a simple life. Leader comes calling help we need you to save the world.

Leader is Father Figure to girl. Girl is like please can I be (because of course she needs Father Figure approval), Father Figure NO girl please I can do it Father Figure NO.

Que martial arts scene to show hero in his masculine glory. Bad Boy Hero fights girl. Bad Boy Hero declares she is my co-pilot because of course she belongs to him. Father Figure NO. Intense testosterone staring occurs. Off screen penis measuring. Cut to next day girl shows up for training. Girl loses control of her emotions (because duh she's a girl) in training sequence and nearly destroys all the dude bros in the building. Bad girl. In steps the Cocky Douche Bag  girl bad, going to get us killed Bad Boy Hero steps in to defend her honor (because well girl). Father Figure declares girl no more fight. Bad Hoy Hero argues. More intense testosterone fueled staring. Father figure wins the peeing match. Bad girl-girl grounded

Crisis. Oh, no only Bad Boy Hero can save us now.  Long  dramatic fight sequence lots of crashes and booms. Bad Boy Hero saves the day but only because he directs girl's every move (because obviously girls can't think). Back at the Super Save the World Center cheers all around. No time to celebrate.

WAIT. The world really is ending this time. Dramatic speech from Father Figure. Because reasons Father Figure is now going to have to be in the thick of the fighting. Father Figure and Cocky Douche Bag are now a team and Bad Boy Hero and girl are a team (but really we all know it's just him). Go teams! Wait plan A to save the world  is going to fail. Father Figure is going to have to sacrifice himself (don't worry we knew this from the beginning because heavy handed foreshadowing). Cocky Douche Bag what are we going to do ?  Father Figure make way for the lady .Action, action, action. Now it's time to enact plan B to save the world. Uh oh not enough oxygen Bad Boy Hero gives his oxygen to girl (how chivalrous) and ejects her from the action. Good,  now girl out of the way Bad Boy Hero can  get down to the business of saving the world. Success.

LONG DRAWN OUT DRAMATIC PAUSE did Bad Boy Hero make it out? All the dude bros at the Super Save the World Center are on the edge of their seats with anticipation. Bad Boy Hero is out of harm's way but is he alive? Girl rushes to him crushes his head to her heaving bosom don't leave me. Bad Boy Hero lets out a breath and makes a cocky quip. Whew! That was a close one we all thought he was a goner -wait what? This is a dude bro American movie who am I kidding.

Girl kisses boy.

Credits roll.

So to answer the question posed at the beginning of this review. This is a movie for chest bumping dude bros who like watching other dude bros in Giant MECHS fighting Giant Monsters. No girls allowed well only one girl because otherwise someone might mistake them for being gay. And that would totally mess up this adolescent penis er power fantasy.",1388275200,12,3263,4.349258649093905

I found my attention span wandering after an ungodly 130 minutes.  Fans of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" probably complained about the casting of Charlie Hunnam after seeing this movie.

However, and maybe I am experiencing sensory overload our CGI world, but I did not find this to be a compelling or realistic story, nor am I enamored with watching realistic animation for two hours anymore.

I fear as people look back the current crop of movies will look hokey, because everyone is relying so heavily on CGI to sell their movies, and technology always get better so you date yourself by making the whole movie about a technology.  Watch Jason and the Argonauts, or an old Godzilla movie and maybe you'll see what I mean.  Even, dare I say it, Star Wars.

Comparing this film to Transformers in any form is like comparing apples and oranges.  As an Anime Nut myself this film has some real good things and some very poor things, mainly surrounding the attempted ""comic relief"" which really had no place in this film to begin with.  the film would have been better served without the two Moron Doctors having at each-other with their shallow witted quips.

As for the rest of the film, I think with a little more attention to some of the other Anime Genres, this film's story and plot lines could have been a little stronger and more plausible.  Much of this film reminded me of the Voltron series cartoons from my childhood, crossed with some GI Joe, and from the more modern Appleseed with some Blue Gender and Teknoman thrown in.  But again, I am not comparing this film to those, just merely stating this particular film seemed to take many of these Anime films and sort of smash it all into one movie, which made it somewhat rough.

For what the film was supposed to be, it indeed delivers on that premise.  For what the film could have been, it fall short of the mark.  Would I place it in my collection at my home?  Yes, and it is already there.  Why?  Because the artwork for the robots is credible enough to be represented along-side the rest of my Anime collection.",1388102400,,1455,4.50763358778626

My only complaint about the 3D Blu-ray/Blu-ray/Ultraviolet combo of the film is the actual packaging.

5389297,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Okay, they're not robots - they're giant machines protecting the planet from Kaiju that enter the world through a dimensional rift and lay waste to anything in their paths.  Each machine is controlled by 2 or more pilots and has unique weaponry, much as the Kaiju monsters do.  Great action sequences.  OK, so they're all computer animation - but at least with these the virtual camera is pulled back far enough that you can see who is punching what, which instantly makes it easier to watch than any of the Michael Bay Transformers series.

The flick has a strong Japanese / Anime vibe to it and feels like a graphic novel being displayed on the screen. There is an attempt to introduce emotional depth to the movie, but the father/son dynamic of the Aussie team is more believable than the romantic plot - just a basic lack of chemistry - and the character Ron Perlman brings into the film doesn't provide the comic relief it is supposed to.  But that's not why you watch a movie like this anyway.

The fight scenes are incredible, and are on an epicly huge scale.  Turn on the surround sound and don't get too close to the 'woofer, because your house is going to shake.  Though I can't say the acting is great or the script is fantastic, the fight scenes alone warrant the four stars, and the extras are well worth watching.

5389304,4,B00A6UHC0U,"There' a dimensional rift and earth is invaded. So where are the ICBM'S, Grand Slam bombs, aircraft and 16"" -18"" rifles, and neutron  nukes? We get Rock-em Sock-em Robots, and the only thing missing is Sly Stallone and Burgess Meredith saying, ""I can't let you go back in Rock."" Giant Robots piloted by a two man team, and they are punching monsters? They look like invertebrates, so its like punching jello. They finally do get some other weapons , but Olympic team Earth has only a few Robots left.
And no story would be complete without some jealous  mano y mano  ""I';m the top robo fighter;"" ""all you did was get your brother killed,"" which leads up to a fight where the hero wins. Then he is paired with a woman, who nobody knows if she can overcome her childhood demons of the monsters, and do her share of the work to make Mega Godzilla work.(of course their is a big romantic angle which culminates in falling in love-she already has, just waiting for him;)
 Weak on plot big on sci-fi  wanna be Rocky Balboa action eye candy added to 3D. I think it would have been more palatable if some robot team had lost it and gone berzerk and attacked another robot ala ""Real Steel""-the boxing would have made sense. At least they didn't use the device of the cam-corder from Cloverfield. And our stalwart hardy heros save the day, ""with a hardy hi ho silver!""(and some private time, of course after!)
Its a twist, squirm and drudge to get through it, but I'm sure the kids will love it. I can understand why del Toro's ""vision"" of ""The Hobbit"" was just too far out of sync with Wing Nut and New Line Cinema to risk a lot of money on a change in a guaranteed money making machine. I think del Toro is at his best on his own projects most of which are a big success, and maybe, this was aimed at the younger audience most of which will probably love it.
And that is really who should be writing the reviews-be interesting to get their take. Well I have it, in 3D, but its sure to be seen, in a normal rotation of a LOT of movies unless the kids come by-then they will burn it up. (I'm waiting for pt. 3 of ""Hellboy) Just a new twist on ""Transformers""-with people inside.

Physically the machines in Pacific Rim could not exist (Wired magazine did a cool piece about the actual  force that would be needed to power these things, it was a fun article). Since giant monsters are not really coming out of the ocean that doesn't matter. Yes this is kind of a stupid movie, but it is kind of fun too.",1388016000,,436,4.45
5389309,5,B00A6UHC0U,"The Film:  The movie itself is absolutely fantastic.  The characters and the narrative aren't earth-shattering, but they are well beyond the standard of typical summer blockbuster fare.  There is a fair depth to the main protagonist that you don't typically see in an summer action flick, but the supporting characters are the ones that really steal the Show.  Idris Elba's acting is phenomenal, as is the nature of his character.  Rinko Kikuchi may as well be a second lead as once she arrives on screen she carries her performance near flawlessly.  The action sequences are astounding, as are the visual effects.  You can tell that Del Toro did not pull any stops, and the movie has that visual perfection of special effects that you can only get by blending top-quality digital effects and artfully crafted practical effects.  The monsters and the jaegers both look and move with an authenticity that they may as well be real.

The Blu Ray and DVD versions both look excellent.  I have not tried the 3d version from this disk, but if it is anything like the 3d version from theaters, it's way better than most.

The other content: The special content available on the discs is nice.  The second bonus disc is content seems to take a wider view, a little more universe oriented and is great for fans looking for more information on the world of Pacific Rim.  The special features on the movie disc itself are equally insightful, but generally focus more on the creative process of actually setting up and filming the movie, as well as generating the effects.  Definitely worth a look.

The packaging: The only element of this item that leaves a little bit to be desired is the case.  Overall it's a pretty good idea, and unlike most similar collectors cases, it fits on a shelf and is about the same dimensions as a couple blu-ray disks together, so you don't need to find a special place for it.  The only downside is the flip-back portion of the case that stores the disks.  Its held up so far but I don't know if it will be durable enough to last a year from now, and perhaps more importantly, it's awkward getting disks out.  I haven't dropped one but I've accidentally left a big ol' thumbprint on a disk more than once trying to switch out one for another or just even trying to take the movie out to play it.",1388016000,,2317,4.580097087378641

5389311,4,B00A6UHC0U,It is all that I expected but I was hoping for fighting sequences that each lasted a bit longer.  The cgi is awesome but I wished the battles was longer than a moment.  Also the acting is horrible except Mori and the plot set up is below par.  The film is all about fighting monsters and little else which I would gladly accept except the fighting sequences could have been more.  I really wanted to like this movie a lot but felt unsatisfied.  Great attempt--leaps and bounds better than past monster movies but not there yet.  Director seems to be a master in cgi but the acting and plot development is not up to par with the great ones i.e. J.J. Abrams etc.  Highly recommend watching the movie but not for purchase.

In this age of Hollywood, the special effects are always stunning, but I found myself devoid of any emotion regarding the characters.

My son however is a big fan (10) and he watches it at least once a week,  The special effects are pretty cool and the mech suits are fun to watch.  Plot is mostly irrelevant as this is an effects driven shoot em up action movie.

If you're desperate for the highlights though, rift opens in the ocean and big lizards come through, mechs built to fight them, lizards come faster and faster, politicians scrap the mech program in favor of a big wall, wall fails 5 remaining mechs go out to clean house and close the rift.

Seriously, knowing the story isn't likely to detract from your enjoyment (or lack thereof) of this movie.

Sure, there's a little more to it than that, but if you don't have a soft spot for giant robots or Kaiju, you probably won't rate this more than about a 2 or 3; it's not about nuanced performances or tight, complex plotting, it's about skyscraper-sized pro-wrestling matches.  Everything else is in service to that.

I feel like the sizing of the monsters and robots were too large. All I was thinking throughout the movie was"" instead of building a giants robot with all that metal, they could of built 50 cruise ships"" , but that's just me. I'm glad I rented this and not bought it. I guess it's just a guy's movie. Also nukes can solve a lot of problems. USA and Russia has to have them stocked up somewhere. I don't care if this is helpful or not, I increasingly disliked this movie. It toke around 20 minutes for the Pacific Rim title to show.

However, the story isn't really why you will want to watch this. The visuals are, and they are truly stunning. From that standpoint, and if that is what you are looking for, you will probably consider this to be a 5 star affair, and if I could simply stop caring about all those nagging writing inefficiencies, I probably would have done so.

I love Gypsy Danger the Jager ( German for Hunter ) who is thought to be obsolete but proves she can still kick alien butt.  Her pilots are Beckett and Mako. Pilots have to connect mentally, or as they say, be drift compatible to control a Jager.  The mental load is too much for one pilot and that is why there are two- they share the load.

I enjoyed the research doctors and how they interacted with each other and the other characters.  They play an important role is defeating the aliens.

This movie is a great film and I would recommend it.

One last thought.  This movie reminds me in a small way of Gigantor ( an old cartoon ) and Godzilla movies but with better effects.  Except the Giant Jager  is fighting a Kaiju ( Japanese for Giant Beast ), the aliens from a dimension below the ocean.",1387411200,,1043,4.282051282051282

5389392,3,B00A6UHC0U,"I missed this movie when it was in theaters because I couldn't convince anyone that giant robots vs. giant monsters would be worth the cost of seeing it in IMAX 3-D. When I managed to snag it for $6 on here, I was really excited that I was finally going to get to watch Pacific Rim, even if it wasn't in 3-D. After watching the movie, I can understand all of the mixed reviews. The special effects, explosions, lighting, etc. are all wonderful. The acting however, is spotty. Hunnam is mostly likable as the main protagonist, but I just didn't feel any emotion from him or really anyone else in the movie. People die, entire cities are destroyed, and everyone is just kind of like...okay, whatever. The film also has some pacing and plot issues, but considering that this movie is really just about big robots destroying and being destroyed by giant monsters, those are forgivable. What really brought this film down for me were the ""comic relief"" characters played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, who came across as completely over-the-top ridiculous and incredibly unlikable. The only relief I felt during this movie was when they finally left the scene.

Apart from the movie itself, this Blu-Ray/DVD/Ultraviolet combo pack is awesome. The case itself is encased in a pretty cool looking lenticular sleeve. There's quite a few bonus features including the usual commentary tracks, storyboard stuff, and deleted scenes. For someone who really enjoyed Pacific Rim, this set is probably worth it. For me, I'm glad I only paid $6 for it, because I might have felt ripped off if I had paid more.",1387324800,,1593,4.792727272727273

I'm a big Sci Fi fan and the trailers promised so much but it never lived up to it.
I don't understand how it has received such good reviews.
Quick summary of my main issues:
- Poor acting. It was terrible. It seems the directors efforts were concentrated on the special effects and the acting came second.
- Worst ""Aussie"" representation ever in a movie (or very close to it). Absolutely hated the Aussie characters. Terrible, terrible accent. Cringe worthy ""Aussie"" slang. With so many Aussies working in the movie industry these days I don't know how they got it so bad - especially from such a high profile director. Full disclosure here - I'm an Aussie.

I love that the film focuses on the strength of a connection between two people, whatever shape or form you find it in (parent-child, friends, lovers), and within that between Mako and Raleigh specifically, I love that friendship does not have to be sterile, but is warm and intimate and affectionate.

The bad: risible dialogue and generally poor acting. Max Martini's Aussie accent was worse than Charlie Hunnam's American one. The story was fairly predictable, down to the pair of science geeks there for comic relief (which I'm glad in order to lighten an otherwise dark and grim story.) And it seemed to have too many main characters through which the story meandered. We have the hero's initial loss and doubt. Then there's the Japanese woman's quest for vengeance. Then the father-son dynamic from another pair of characters. Then the gruff, fatherly figure of Idris Alba's character and what he represented. Plus the scientists, who I think were meant to echo R2-D2 and C-3P0.

All that aside, it was a fairly enjoyable experience. I will watch anything Guillermo Del Toro does. And the supplemental features provided an excellent look into the process and design of making the film, which to me showcases Del Toro's immense talent and vision. I only wish the script was tighter, more emotional, and less clich. But it was a fun evening spent.",1387152000,,1322,4.923766816143497

5389443,3,B00A6UHC0U,"This is a very silly film, the first clue was when I watched the US Air Force kamikaze F-22's into a giant monster as it attacked San Francisco. The second clue came when the powers of the world determine that rather than inventing bigger guns and better weapons that they should build giant robots. I think the green lobby had a hand in the decision, after all it's more sporting to take on the giant monsters hand to hand rather than at a distance like a sensible person.

It gets better when the giant robots start getting beaten by bigger monsters a new plan is formed rather than fight the monsters the countries around the ocean decide to build a massive wall. As you can imagine this plan isn't successful.

While I wouldn't want to live in such a world it does make for a fun film. The plot is a simple one, in the Pacific Ocean an alien doorway opens and giant monsters enter the world through this rift.

The fights between the robots and the monsters are a visual treat, while the graphics don't really compensate for a paper thin plot and some very dodgy acting (an Australian accent really stands out) they make a spectacle that's fun to watch.

I was not disappointed.

This movie is incredibly good.  It features the best elements of what I liked about the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers and Godzilla franchises when I was a kid, then added in the badassness of Idris Elba and an action flick and blended it all together with the incredible visionary talents of Guillermo Del Toro.  I mean, what did you expect?  His name is Guillermo of the BULL.

My wife hates sci-fi flicks, and she hates Godzilla as well as MMPR.  I'm not really sure why I married her, now that I think about it.  Anyways.  She LOVED this movie as did I and everyone who saw it.  I'm pretty sure the only people who hated this movie are the folks who showed up thinking Pacific Rim was a Jacques Cousteau underwater documentary.

I won't give spoilers of any nature but the plot is essentially monsters rise from under the Pacific ocean.  They kick our ass.  The President of the US was a Power Rangers fan so he has a bunch of Megazords built.  We put two pilots in each.  Megazords then proceed to slug it out with Godzilla.  Except Godzilla brought his friends Mechagodzilla, Mothra and Ghidorah.  So the Megazord has to call in the Dragonzord and the UN of zords.

Its robots slugging it out with giant monsters.

It's SAMCRO piloting a robot slugging it out with monsters so bad that Godzilla has nightmares about them.

What else do you need?  And, honestly for you film critics who want plot, well it has a solid plot.  I'm great at figuring out a plot before it's revealed.  This one was too fun and too functional to do so.  Very, very well written.  The robots fighting monsters was just a perk of a well written, well directed, and incredibly visually stunning film.

Guillermo Del Toro's ""Pacific Rim"" proves yet again that what was one generation's B-movie castoff is another generation's A-movie mainstay. It's a throwback to all those monster movies that played mainly in drive-ins in the 1950s - only here the budget is huge and the stop-motion and claymation techniques used back then have been replaced by the latest in CGI technology.

In this 21st Century edition, giant creatures have broken through the earth's crust and are stomping all over many of the planet's largest coastal cities (see ""Godzilla,"" ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms,"" ""The Giant Gila Monster,"" etc. for the roots of these types of films). Humanity's response has been to create an army of giant metallic robots replete with two mind-melded human pilots at the controls (think of it as a WII version of a tank with arms and legs). Charles Hunnam, of ""Sons of Anarchy"" fame, is the hotshot pilot called out of self-imposed retirement - his co-pilot/brother was lost while on a previous mission - to help rescue the world. Rinko Kikuchi is his new partner with some unresolved issues of her own to deal with. Idris Elba, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini and Ron Perlman (I guess we know what the ""Anarchy"" boys were doing on their time off that year) round out the cast.

The plotting is nothing to write home about, and there is way more jabbering, soul-searching and speechifying than is probably called for in a movie such as this - but the intense action scenes, bits of comic relief, and rally-round-the-flag-boys heroics help the popcorn go down smoothly.",1386720000,,1587,4.914179104477612

If I were to be a movie snob, I would say something like: Del Torro's cinematic excellence is once again displayed here. His love letter to Japanese anime is absolutely splendid in it's creative use of the style of cinematography he has become known for. While the plot tends to meander a touch, and can be rather played out, the visuals bring a frighteningly brilliant indication of future cinematics to come.

Most movies, I'll just watch once via a Red Box rental, but ""Pacific Rim"" is so mind boggling, I wanted to watch it a few times (and I also bought the hardcover companion book, to take a better look at the marvelous creature design). The director really nailed his goal of creating a fantastic ""monster movie"", in the vein of the classics like Godzilla. These beasts establish an increible amount of scale, power, and ferocity, offset perfectly by their mortal enemies - the man made ""Jaegers"". The special effects are truly ""special"" for a change... I was watching this movie on my couch, and about 15 minutes into it, I got up, placed a chair right in front of my TV, and watched it from that close distance. I just couldn't believe what I was looking at, and I was oftentimes laughing with delight at the spectacle, or making exclamations of wonder. I figured this movie would be good, but I had no idea it would be THIS good.

I think the plot suits the fanciful nature of the movie very well, and the characters are great, nicely filling that ""Del Toro"" flavor that is in all of the director's movies (most notably ""Hellboy"" and ""The Golden Army""). Of course, if you're looking for something slow paced and philosophical, this is not the movie for you.

The story line is simple, but it never drags. Like most Del Torro films there's a lot of color and symbolic color to the film, and there are so many tiny details that you notice something new every time you watch it. When the Kaiju or the Jaegers move, you really get a sense of how big and how heavy they are; they're actually believable. I definitely recommend it!",1386633600,,704,4.3007518796992485

Don't watch this if you are expecting some deep or philosophical movie, go watch Man Of Steel with Superman complaining about how being a invincible super hero is hard and depressing or Iron Man 3 with RDJ dealing with PTSD after going through a wormhole. If you came to watch 300 foot tall giant robots beating the blue blood out of some even bigger alien monsters while rampaging through a hurricane and Hong Kong then sit back and enjoy.

Again, this movie isn't great because it is innovative or original, it is awesome because it does everything it needs to and does it right. All the fundamentals are there. Awesome direction, good enough plot to keep you interested, decent acting from people you've never heard of, awesome sets and special effects, and even decent pacing. The story and characters are surprisingly good, and to top off this experience you get some great extras at the end of the film showing some behind the scenes with good commentary that will only make you love this film more when you see how much thought and effort went into making this great film.

5389532,2,B00A6UHC0U,"First let me say that I am a Science Fiction fan.  I have an extensive library of the great science fiction works and I will open up by admitting that I don't like it when folks call an action movie dressed up as science fiction, a science fiction movie. Now that being said, I can still appreciate a really good action adventure movie and I do like special effects.  However, I can't give this movie a good review.  Because......

I fell asleep.  That's right.  I fell asleep.  I tried to finish it the next day.  I fell asleep again.  Nuff said, really.  It is slick looking, but it is mostly action.  What little dialog there is, is predictable and stilted and not well acted.  The sound engineers did a great job creating lots of exciting loud noises to go with all that action (and I have a massive sound system so it was very LOUD) and still, I fell asleep.  Why?  Well gee, could it have been that I didn't really care what happened to the characters?  Could it have been that I already knew what was going to happen?  There is no way I can give a good review to a movie that could not keep my attention.

This movie is great for anyone under 25 who hasn't already seen a gazillion movies JUST LIKE THIS, with better plots and acting.  By just like this I mean little to no dialog (screen writers today have a pretty easy job) and lots of loud noises.  Let's just say this is not Indian Jones where we have a great quirky character that we actually care about or the Tobey Maguire Spiderman nor does it have the engaging mood of a lovingly choreographed martial arts film (all of which would have received 5 stars from me).  I would have been much more entertained had I cued up an original Godzilla film; ""Destroy All Monsters"" comes to mind.

I promise you that at some point, and that age is different for men and women, everyone eventually grows very tired of this sort of thing.  Yes, action junky, this means you.  Eventually you will not be entertained by this stuff.  So, for your own future, don't encourage the movie industry to continue to make movies like this.

If you were expecting anything different, well, I'm not sure why because Pan's Labyrinth this ain't. It's exactly what the promo materials promised: a big-budget SFX sandwich with a dense layer of sci-fi sensibility spread through its guts. Hold the subtlety and nuance.

Fans of the classic monster movie will be, no doubt, tickled to see the evolution of that format (though some of these beasts are so foreign and complex, it's often tough to distinguish up from down amidst the mayhem of a fight scene) but I was somewhat puzzled by its herky-jerk pacing and weird sense of identity. It's a tale that can't choose between serious action and gaudy eccentricity, so it tries to move in both directions without luck. Likewise, I had difficulty looking past the odd jumble of TV stars mashed together at the center of it all, drawn from very different sources and plunked down together in a series of comically mismatched back-and-forths. The action is good, and abundant, but the plot is quite thin and the core characters are all basic caricatures.

'Pacific Rim', noted director Guillermo Del Toro's attempt to update the old Japanese Godzilla monster genre, can best be described as a colossal waste of money. The setting is a decade from now. The monsters, called Kaiijus, have escaped from an inter-dimensional rift on the ocean floor and wreak havoc all over earth. In response, mankind have developed Jaegers, giant humanoid contraptions, piloted by two humans, who work in tandem via a mind meld of sorts. We're introduced to Raleigh Becket, a former Jaeger pilot who lost his brother while they were battling one of the Kaiijus a few years before. Becket is called out of retirement as the commander of the Jaegers, Stacker Pentecost, believes he's the best for the job.

Right off the bat, the plot makes little sense. The Jaeger program is discontinued as the giant machines are no match for the overpowering Kaiijus. Instead, the powers that be decide to construct giant walls to protect earth's population from the monsters. The only problem is that the walls are completely flimsy and collapse after the first Kaiiju attack. Why then did they believe the walls would work at all?

Despite the order to discontinue the Jaeger program, Pentecost seeks to throw one last 'Hail Mary' by dropping a thermonuclear bomb into the rift, cutting off the Kaiiju's portal to earth. Instead of simply showing one big monster battle after another, most of Act II involves finding a new partner for Becket. He ends up with Mako Mori, a Japanese director of a Jaeger refurbishment project, who also happens to be Pentecost's adoptive daughter. Mori wants to team up with Becket, but her over protective parent, Pentecost, is against it.

Mori almost blows her chance when memories of a Kaiiju killing her parents interferes with the mind meld with Becket, causing the Jaeger they're testing, to go berserk. If this isn't enough, there's also a sub-plot concerning two scientists, one of whom, Geiszler, establishes a mental link with the Kaiiju brain. He goes to Hong Kong where he meets up with Chau, played by an over the top Ron Perlman, who is a black market dealer in Kaiiju body parts. Keiszler figures out that the good guys can only gain access to the portal if the Kaiiju recognize their own DNA.

No need to rehash the rest of the plot. It's pretty obvious that the good guys manage to drop the bomb into the portal and cut off the Kaiiju access. Of course there's a whole bunch of boring Monster-Humanoid battle scenes before that, probably most enjoyed by aficionados of violent video games.

Pacific Rim didn't do that well at the box office here in the US but cleaned up overseas. Casting pretty Japanese Rinko Kakuchi as the co-star was a brilliant casting move, which undoubtedly had a lot to do with the film's success in the Asian market.

In the end, Pacific Rim is a pointless attempt to update the Godzilla genre. The action sequences are repetitious and the human drama is stilted and predictable. The only thing I enjoyed in the entire film is when Ron Perlman cuts himself out of the baby Kaiiju, during the post-credit sequence. That at least WAS amusing!",1386201600,6,3169,4.814338235294118

The plot
In a word, ridiculous. I can suspend disbelief with the best of them but I have eye strain from the number of times I rolled my eyes at the absurd explanations for the absurd situations this stinker kept tossing out.

The characters
Under developed, cookie cutter characters who did nothing at all to make me care about them. Their interactions with each other were shallow, predictable and stereotypical. Do they live? Do they die? Do they save the world? Who cares...

The dialogue
Corny, cheesy and recycled from a handful of other B-grade sci-fi movies. ""We're canceling the apocalypse!"", please...

Pretty much everything else
The music score was jarringly bad in several places, the fight scenes take place mostly at night, in the rain, so you can't even appreciate the CGI.

I love sci-fi action adventure movies. I also love campy, fun, mindless movies that don't take themselves too seriously. This movie seemed like it was trying to be both but failed spectacularly in my opinion. The worst movie I've seen in a long time.",1386115200,4,1239,4.8254716981132075

If you're looking for a movie with an intelligent plot, compelling characters, and witty dialogue, this isn't it.

Del Toro obviously has an excellent eye for cinematography and as a result Pacific Rim is a stunningly beautiful film. It's a delight to watch. Del Toro and his special effects department manage to make it look absolutely real, even the giant monsters. That's no small accomplishment, especially in an age where audiences are becoming inured to computer-generated effects.

The rest of the movie doesn't support those lofty visual effects. Most of the characters are one-dimensional at best. The two main characters, Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori, just aren't interesting enough to care about. They're generic, inoffensive heroes. The two scientists are even worse and are actually grating. It seems del Toro found two ridiculous caricatures of scientists and told the actors to take it even further. Despite the danger all of the characters faced, I found myself not really caring about any of them.

However, the plot really dragged the movie down. There are just so many plot wholes and gaps in logic as to make it difficult to suspend disbelief. First, it's never really clear why the humans can't just use nukes against the monsters, but apparently laser cannons and giant swords are effective against them. Second, if the monsters are all clones of each other, why are they all different shapes and sizes? Third, it's not really clear why two operators are needed for each robot if they each perform the same functions. If it's just about brain capacity, couldn't you automate some functions? And so on...

If you like the idea of robots battling monsters, Pacific Rim is definitely worth watching once. And make sure to watch it on a big TV with a good sound system. Unfortunately, I don't think there will be a need to watch it a second time.

Overall: 2.5 stars.",1385769600,5,2064,4.919540229885057
5389648,5,B00A6UHC0U,"When I first saw Pacific Rim in theater, I felt like an absolute kid again.  With that said I was big into Godzilla movies, the first being Godzilla 1985.  And even though in the passed years when it comes to giant monsters, let alone giant robot movies, us in America somehow makes them hit and miss.  Godzilla 98' would of been fine if it wasn't called ""Godzilla"" rather had its own name, Cloverfield was decent but the idea of the digital camera might be a bit iffy, and must I talk about the live-action Transformers movies?  Pacific Rim is really that one movie that we've been waiting for, it takes out most of the bad and leaves in most of the good of what to expect in giant monster and robot movies.  Though that's not to say there might be some minor problems with the movie you may experience, people say that the narration at the beginning was too long, some say that there's not much action, me I say there's not much to complain.  I actually felt that there was plenty of action, and even though the narration of the beginning might of been a bit long, it at least opens up showing one of the first monsters destroying the Golden Gate Bridge.  Wait a couple more minutes and soon you'll see the first full fight between robots and monsters.  I'm not saying that this movie will be perfect for everyone, but I am saying that this movie was no doubt perfect for me that even if I wanted to complain I couldn't think of one.  I go to movies like Pacific Rim for 2 things, action and destruction, that's all you really need when it comes to giant monster movies, especially ones that take inspiration from Godzilla films.  It does it right, more right than previous entries that's outside of Japan or anywhere from Asia.  If you're still unsure of the movie I at least ask you just give it one chance, this is no doubt a movie I'll enjoy for a long time, and a definite appetizer for the upcoming Godzilla 2014.",1385769600,,1921,4.383098591549296

5389656,2,B00A6UHC0U,"What a disappointing movie.  Full of logical inconsistency and needlessly obtuse plot elements that break immersion.

First, the special effects are fine and the acting is passable.  The plot is what it is, extremely predictable for this type of movie in the sense that the direction is plainly telegraphed to the audience by wanton 'you are dumb' expository dialogue.  Don't bother looking for any red herrings trying to throw you off.

What really burns the audience at the end of the day is the internal inconsistency with the movie.  Everyone can accept bending physics for a movie when it is done in a consistent manner.  However, in this movie, the giant mechs (Jaegers) are seemingly both fragile and indestructible depending on the scene and the end result needed.  Similarly, the choice of the human race to erect a giant wall around the ENTIRE Pacific Rim instead of another more logical reason to dismantle the Jaeger program is lol-worthy.  Like, say, giant fixed emplacements of the Kaiju destroying projectile weapons found ON said Jaegers, negating the need for rock-em-sock-em robots.  This would have seemed far more reasonable and of course would have had far less precedent for failure than walls, which have worked exactly NEVER in human history as a permanent solution to anything.  Much less against monsters which have seemingly no trouble dismantling Jaegers with many times more robust armor plating than is visible during the construction scenes.  Unless it is one of the scenes where they need to be truly damaged instead of just a Kaiju love tap, of course.  Also, I can't tolerate movies which ignore ammunition in some scenes and then make it a critical issue in another.  Either the magazines/charges/rounds are unlimited for action purposes or they aren't.  It's just lazily inconsistent.  Like having giant swords which, while extremely effective, are only used after all unwieldy makeshift weapons are exhausted.

But don't get me started with some of the stupid scripting choices made by Del Toro.  This ranks with the worst of sci-fi and military movies:  poor dialogue choices due to a lack of a basic understanding of the subject matter.  For instance, a nuclear reactor 'melting down' does NOT cause the equivalent of a fission bomb.  In fact, an effective power generating nuclear chain reaction is mutually exclusive with an explosive chain reaction due to the fuel enrichment levels.  I expect a high school student given a few cool prototype Jaeger action figures in exchange for reading the script could have easily said 'maybe they should just call it a self destruct?'  Further, the EMP blast which disables all Jaegers except the protagonist mech, Gypsy Danger, could have easily been explained by it being the only mech around back when they considered nuclear weapons viable and thus it was the only one hardened against EMP.  But no, we are told that 'it is analog'.  No, I'm sorry, the giant digitally controlled fly-by-wire robot with mind reading computer system is not 'analog'.

It's so utterly frustrating to find a movie where the director and producer obviously care about the production, but just not enough to check their own work.  I feel like Del Toro was so excited to be making the film (as evident by all the sneak peak featurettes before the release) that he forgot to do it well.",1385769600,4,3346,4.992779783393502
5389657,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim isn't for everyone, but simply put it's exactly what it looks like. It's a big, stupid fun, summer big special effects movie. The dialogue is cheesy and the acting is a little campy, especially Max Martini's Australian accent, but it delivers on the robot vs monster concept. The movie does a great job of creating this sci-fi world, I appreciated how del Toro creates a whole world for the movie to take place in. But like any movie that has a concept like this, if you over think it, it'll fall apart. If you can simply enjoy what's on the screen you'll have a good time, but too much thought and the movie stops being a fun action movie and starts to be a study in movie cliches. Pacific Rim has all sorts of formulaic characters, but balances it out with actors who seem to being having fun and a couple of great action sequences. If you're looking for something that you can turn off your brain and just have fun with, this is a great movie to watch. It's especially good to watch in 3D, the movie has a lot of layers visually and the 3D works well with it (it probably doesn't hurt that much of the action is CG).

5389671,4,B00A6UHC0U,"It was love at first sight.  This is the best summation of my reaction to finally getting a chance to see Guillermo del Toro's new sci-fi tent pole production, Pacific Rim.  Pure, unadulterated love.

You see, for me cinematic science fiction has definitely been heading in the wrong direction these last few decades.  As someone who grew up reading (and loving!) the great science fiction masters of yesteryear - authors such as Asimov, Bradbury, Hubbard, Saberhagan, and so many more - I have developed a distinctive taste for science fiction that doesn't just ask the great science fiction motivator question of ""what if...?"", but also provides a smart yet thrillingly imaginative answer to that question.  I admit that is a tall order to fill, yet somehow the old masters managed to fulfill that order time and again.  Strangely, Hollywood, despite its billions of dollars and army of scriptwriters, has been largely unable to do so.

Instead, we have been force-fed a diet of either cartoonish and superficial science fiction along the lines of the $380 million dollar after school special that was James Cameron's Avatar, or we lurch to the other end of the spectrum and wind up being forced to suffer through an insipid lecture on the latest socioeconomic hobbyhorse that is taking Tinsel Town by storm, one merely disguised as science fiction by the misappropriation of that genre's robots/ray guns/spaceships/what-have-you so as to make the Marxist poison go down easier (I'm looking at you, WALL-E).  Whichever way Hollywood lurches with this stuff the end result has been the same for me:  it just isn't fun anymore.  Schoolyard silly?  Yes!  Tedious?  Absolutely!  But fun?  Er...no.  Nor truly imaginative, for that matter.  I swear, if I see one more jungle planet, or one more garbage dump planet, I'm going to get on a spaceship and leave for good....

I think this is why I so readily fell in love with Pacific Rim.  This movie represents a return to science fiction fundamentals, to a time where the all important ""what if...?"" wasn't asked by a tedious professor of feminist studies,  but by a practiced storyteller with an active imagination.  In this case, the question is a classic one right out of the black and white glory days of sci-fi monster movies: ""what if Earth was invaded by giant monsters?  And what if they only way to defeat those monsters was to 'create monsters of our own'?""  Now that is the question to ask!

And from there the movie is off and running.  Indeed, ""running"" might be the perfect word as the movie immediately wows you with an eye-popping battle between a towering ""Category 3"" Kaiju (Japanese for ""strange creature"") and an equally towering Jaeger mech (no, not a 'robot') piloted by two human ""ranger"" pilots linked by a mental ""drift"", something that helps to better distribute the mental load of managing such a mighty weapon.  What results is the type of giant monster vs. giant mech battle scene that I have yearned to see since I watched Voltron as a kid.  It is just...awesome!  So awesome in fact that it almost brought a tear of nostalgia to my Gen X'er eye.

I won't tell you what happens during that battle as it involves a pretty important plot point, but suffice to say that this battle will mark a turning point in mankind's eight year struggle against an alien invasion that originates from a multi-dimensional ""rift"" in the Pacific seabed.  For after this battle mankind's Jaeger offensive would begin to fail, leaving major cities along the Pacific Rim (hence the name of the movie) vulnerable to destruction from the claws and teeth of ever more powerful Kaiju.  Things get so bad in fact that mankind is ultimately forced to a last ditch defensive strategy involving the construction of massive ""Anti-Kaiju Walls"" to protect coastal cities, something that politicians assure the world will work where the Jaegers have failed...despite the fact that a Kaiju is soon seen to effortlessly smash his way through such a wall (clearly the same government contractors who have built the Obamacare website must have built these walls).  Of course, the Earth's only real hope still lies with the now abandoned Jaeger program, which is now exiled to Hong Kong with its last handful of functional Jaegers.  The question is:  can they turn the tide so late in the game, and with fewer resources than ever?  Classic underdog movie incoming!

What results is an old school sci-fi actioner that keeps you on the edge of your seat as one frightful sea monster after another requires whacking with the massive metal hands - and rockets, plasma cannons, swords...amongst other weapons - of the last four mechs in existence.  These battles are truly eye-catching spectacles, particularly due to how Del Toro brings so much color to them.  The mid-movie battle in Hong Kong is particularly striking as it manages to catch a Blade Runner visual vibe with all the neon lighting and LCD displays in that city, something Del Toro uses to great visual effect.  But even the battles that take place out on stormy seas are wonderful to behold in all their detail.  I was particularly impressed by how Del Toro managed to avoid the oft chaotic battles that plague Michael Bay's dreadful Transformer movies where visual FX computers seem to haphazardly vomit pixels onto the screen.  While there are a few moments where Pacific Rim's battles can get a bit busy, it is never as muddled or confused as a typical Transformer's mash-up.  Instead, the audience gets to feel every blow and see almost every punch, leading to visceral fights that I couldn't help but to become emotionally invested in, especially after coming to appreciate how nasty the Kaiju are by nature.  I also enjoyed how Del Toro always seemed to position the camera in just the right way so as to convey the awesome size and power of these clashing behemoths.

The great visual effects aren't limited to battles, either.  This movie just has a great visual style to it.  For example, I particularly enjoyed how Del Toro conjured up the ghost of World War II  by providing glimpses of propaganda posters throughout the film.
Even the Jaegers displayed the type of artwork on their chassis' that was often seen on the nosecones of B-24 bombers.  The weather was also used to good effect as most of the battles took place during dark and stormy nights...yes, yes, I have heard that this has something to do with covering up the limitations of CGI (1998's Godzilla used a similar technique), but I still found it to be an effective way to reinforce the apocalyptic tones of the film.  Lastly, the Jaeger cockpits were also nicely realized with their mechanical contraptions that translate human movements into mechanical ballets of death.  Listening to the actors grunt and groan with effort in their mechanical harnesses as they maneuvered their Jaegers in battle, just as modern fighter pilots groan against the punishing effects of ""pulling G's""in a jet, made the battles all the more believable.

Speaking of actors: unlike many contemporary sci-fi films of recent years, Pacific Rim's weight is borne not so much by its massive CGI metal shoulders but by its excellent cast.  Our protagonist, Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot recalled to active duty, is competently played by Charlie Hunnam.  Nonetheless, it is his co-stars that really steal the show.  Idris Elba delivers a home run performance with his cold-as-a-steely-Jaeger performance as Becket's commander, Stacker Pentecost, a man determined to save the world even if the world has long since given up on saving itself.  Becket's new co-pilot, Mako Mori, played by Rinko Kikuchi, is likewise a stunner, but this time in the ""Lord, she's hot!"" sort of way.  Rounding out the excellent cast are two mad scientists:  the professorial mathematician Dr. Hermann Gottlieb, played by Burn Gorman, and Dr. Newton Geiszler, the Kaiju specialist with rock star aspirations, energetically played by Charlie Day.  These two scientists basically go all Abbot and Costello during the film as they seek to find the solution to the Kaiju problem, but they do so with great comedic effect.  Add in Ron Perlman as a Kaiju black marketeer by the name of Hannibal Chau (I think this is one of his finest roles since Hellboy), and Ellen McLain, famed voice actress of GlaDOS from the game Portal (Del Toro is a gamer like most Gen Xers), as Gypsy Danger's AI, and you can't ask for a better cast than what is featured in Pacific Rim.

The icing on the cake for me was Del Toro's use of religious, particularly Roman Catholic, symbolism.  As anybody who has watched this director's previous works understands, Del Toro always finds a way to bring a deeper spiritual meaning to his films and Pacific Rim is no exception, something that truly surprised me as I didn't think a giant mech/monster movie could have much spirituality in it!  Nonetheless, Del Toro found a way to bring in a few such references.  For example, our protagonist, Raleigh Becket, bears the surname of a great Catholic saint who opposed great power with mere faith, a fitting analogy for a man who is tasked with slaying monsters.  Of course, Becket's commander has the surname Pentecost...need anything else be said about this motivating Holy Ghost of mankind's resistance against the Kaiju?  Then we have the lesser character of Ops Officer Tendo Choi (played by Clifton Collins, Jr.) who wears a rosary around his wrist at all times.  Lastly, and most powerfully, we have a final scene where the American Jaeger 'Gypsy Danger' descends into the alien's hellish universe for one last sacrifice - the Christological symbolism is both visually and metaphorically striking.  Well done, Del Toro!

Lastly, I found the music to be suitably rousing.  Somehow Del Toro combined the musical elements of rock, military marches, and Saturday afternoon cartoons into one pleasing theme!

So, What's Not to Like?

I have to be honest: there isn't a lot to not like about this film as long as you approach as what is is: a piece of  monster-bashing science fiction designed for some nostalgic fun.  Any flaws are really minor.  For example, after the opening fight sequence, the movie takes a rather lengthy pause as it sets up the story and introduces the major characters.  Fair enough - the time is put to good use - but I found myself getting antsy for the next fight scene.

 I also thought the final fight scene was a bit underwhelming.  It takes place underwater at the Rift, something I thought had the potential to be wonderfully imaginative.  Sadly, with the exception of a few passing fish, the battle might have well taken place on land as there are few uses of the unique conditions I imagine fighting three thousand feet under the sea would entail.  And speaking of the final battle, Pacific Rim lazily falls back on the tired, old science fiction solution to every problem:  firing a proton torpedo into a thermal exhaust shaft two meters wide.  Same idea going on here.

Another slight disappointment for me was the lack of detail concerning the 8+ year old war against the Kaiju, as well as the nitty gritty details surround the construction and maintenance of the Jaegers.  Del Toro has created a fascinating setting and I would have loved to been able to explore it in greater detail beyond the quick 10-minute intro at the start of the film.  Let's hope a few sequels rectify this flaw!

Concluding Thoughts

One of the things I found interesting about Pacific Rim was the generally downbeat reaction from the critics.  In many ways it reminded me of the confused and befuddled reaction many critics had to the rock solid mil sci-fi that is Battle: Los Angles.  Like then, I can only surmise that we are dealing with a systemic problem:  that we have a generation of critics that have been lulled to sleep by years of cartoonish science fiction along the lines of Avatar, Star Wars: Episodes 1-3, and countless other recent endeavors.  When confronted by a style of science fiction that is not only more soberly militaristic, but also lacks a Will Smith cracking jokes every few minutes (this was an actual criticism of Battle:LA from a prominent critic), I think most critics just fall off their bikes without their training wheels.

But I think there is a deeper problem here, a generational 'rift', if you will.  Pacific Rim is, first and foremost, a Mecha movie.  Now, if you have never heard that term before it is probably due to the fact that you are NOT a Gen X'er.  Indeed, I find it a fun exercise to go through reviews of Pacific Rim and count the number of times Jaegers are referred to as ""robots"", a sure sign of a critic out of his depth (one recent review asked if this movie was based on The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers....*facepalm*).  Mechs have been popularized by countless amounts of Japanese manga and anime, such as Gundam and Voltron, not to mention lots of games as well (MechWarrior and Strike Suit Zero, for example), so we Gen X'ers have grown up with this stuff and completely understand what Del Toro is doing (again, a fellow Gen X'er).  With that in mind I think it is fair to say that Gen X'ers will/do enjoy this movie far more than Baby Boomers whom seem downright confused by the concept of walking tanks piloted by human Rangers!

Whatever the reason for the disconnect between the critics and the fans, Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim is a solidly entertaining piece of cinematic science fiction that will please both Gen X'ers who have longed to see mechs brought to the big screen, and, needless to say, those who are just looking for some entertaining monster science fiction in the vein of Godzilla or Gamera.  Succinctly: long after the likes of cartoonish and and politically correct sci-fi moves like Avatar are forgotten, people will still be watching Pacific Rim and its monster on mech mayhem.

Old school science fiction has returned, and Del Toro gets the credit for putting the fun back into the genre.",1385596800,12,13995,4.843566021867115

It's a fun movie for mecha buffs, and a decent action film overall. However you don't want to think about the plot too much, because it's very prone to nitpicking. It also needed to be less visually busy at spots, because it can make battles into a murky mess.

Pro:

The mecha look fantastic, and are animated well. I don't think any non-animated picture has as well done mecha, and it has some nice set pieces to show them off. As a form of ""real"" giant robot, they are well designed and would make excellent models.

Nice battles between mecha and kaiju. They strike the right balance between lumbering and dynamic. The scale is nice, too; these critters are big, and they lay waste to cities when they fight.

Lovely backgrounds, whether it's the construction site of a massive wall designed to keep the kaiju in, or Hong Kong, or a decimated Japan.

Con:

Many of the battles are too busy visually, and can be hard to make out. Both water and nighttime are often used to obscure things it feels like.

The kaiju aren't as well done as the mecha, being too similar too each other. A lot of times you can't see them clearly either, and it takes away from their menace. More scenes like the one in Japan would have been awesome, because then you really get the dread you were looking for.

The plot...well, it tries to pay homage to anime tropes without coherence. A lot of things just happen. I think some of them are subtle homages: the analog/digital thing with Gypsy Danger has to be a nod to Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood still, as Robo also faced an emp pulse that only he could survive because he was nuclear and not Shizuma drive equipped., and he was one of the older models in his line too. However, most scenes don't have enough explanation to avoid the dreaded ""C'mon, why did they do that?""

Don't get me wrong, the action scenes are fine, but you can't have semi-realistic low tech fighting on the one hand, and neural handshaking or robots surviving 50k feet drops on the other. It needed to either be more over the top, or more realistic. It combines the two, and when you add in the live-action focus, it seems a lot more incoherent plot-wise than it should.

Final Thoughts:

I liked watching it, but it's just okay. It's probably the best live-action mecha film out there, but even still it's hampered by busy fights and some serious plot issues. Definitely worth a rental, a purchase not so much.",1385596800,11,2435,4.496598639455782

Godzilla belongs to the 1950s Japanese film makers - cheesy effects but the obtuse creature is somehow warm and fuzzy.  Pacific Rim's mechanical monstrosities singly and collectively have the composite personalty of the cold metal they were made from.  The film has neither social redeeming nor entertainment value.  When it comes to sea monsters, less is more. It's like someone trying produce a film that upstages Jurassic Park with a cast of dinosaurs endowed with superpowers like quantum entanglement and dna encoded cloaking mechanisms.

I especially like that the film writers did not use a needless profanity simply to appeal to people with low IQ/vocabulary....so you can let your kids watch this one if they are not too scared of monsters. The story really gets cheesy when they allow a whacked out disturbed chick be the pilot of a hugely expensive piece of defensive equipment. It just insults the adult mind, but I guess it is all about her dealing with her childhood demons....plus they made this appeal to the godzilla crowd in Japan and she would be their gal hero.  If you have any engineering or even rudimentary science background, this gets really, really, really insulting to your intelligence....sort of like watching space movies with lots of gravity. ...so I would not call this a thinking persons entertainment.

It does translate better into the big screen and just looks less ""fake"".  The acting is decent, although I feel the person that really steals the show and adds a lot of emotional ""oomph"" to the story is the actress who plays young Mako.  She's got that scared and wide eyed stare of wonder thing down pat.  The one thing I noticed (while in the theater watching the film) was that I wish the composer would vary some of the thematic music (especially every time you see a jaeger pop onto the screen).

When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past.

On a serious note, if you like sci-fi, and are not super critical of completely non-realistic plots, then there is plenty of action and adventure in this movie for you.  A bonus would be the soundtrack for this movie.  Ramin Djawadi is phenomenal, and the music is great.  Parents, no cussing, no love scenes; actually not even a kiss between the main characters at the end of the movie.

Reality: Much better in the movie theaters - action and sound.  You should have watched this in the movie theater.  If you have a really good sound system and big screen, still very enjoyable.

The action sequences are very graphic and appear smooth motion and real.  This made the movie very good.  The plot is actually very good as well.

It almost begs the question of how could you possibly screw it up? Well, Del Toro managed it to a spectacular level. With me it was the science - the director apparently took one look at all the physics textbooks ever written and decided, well, what do they all know... I realize I am a stickler for details, and Im willing to overlook a few slights as creative license, but just about EVERYTHING in this movie is impossible - stupid impossible. Not only that, but the insult to injury is that it is a science-fiction movie - its almost like they're trying to make fun of everyone with a decent IQ.

The acting is a different matter altogether. It was bad, I don't think anyone argues that, however I found it almost pain-relieving. Idris Elba stole this movie - despite the unrealistic nature of his charactor, he somehow managed to portray it brilliantly.

5389718,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Trust me, when I saw the previews for this movie, I thought it looked really stupid.  My husband and I were looking for entertainment one weekend, however, and this movie was the only viable option because of time and a lack of other decent movies to see, so I looked it up online.  I read a review that was surprisingly positive and I noticed that the director was Guillermo Del Toro, who I really like, so I decided to take a chance.  Boy, I was shocked by how awesome this movie was.  It is an ACTION movie, not a deep and meaningful drama, but it has its own tender moments and also some really funny scenes.  If you're looking for mindless entertainment, look no further.  Also, the special effects are crazy good.  I liked the fella in the movie, too.  I didn't know who he was but I looked him up later and discovered he's the guy from Sons of Anarchy (which I haven't seen you can't help but notice Charlie Hunnam's blonde mane in the commercials).  Anyway, I think it's a kid friendly movie.  I don't recall any lewd language or behavior.  Of course, there is a lot of violence between the robots and the aliens, much like a video game.  If you're not into allowing your kids to see that sort of thing, skip it.  I would put this movie in the same category as something like Avatar in terms of awesome production, somewhat predictable plot, and decent acting.  I don't think you should be surprised by Pacific Rim if you look at Del Toro's prior work, like Cowboys and Aliens, for example.  This time it's robots and aliens.  I was really glad I saw it on the big screen, especially because of the amazing opening sequence.  Cheers, I hope you enjoy.",1385251200,,1659,4.404605263157895

The special effects and CGI are top-notch in this film, very, very well done.  Awesome attention to detail.  It did seem to me a few times that scale got awfully skewed, especially with the jaegers and kaiju being absolutely gigantic as they battled, but once fell or came down to a scale to interact with humans, they seemed to get inexplicably smaller.

Some of the tactics of fighting giant monsters also made no sense whatsoever, like standing there and punching them.  But then again, it's a giant robot/giant monster fighting movie...(see next paragraph).

What I was not expecting was to see that this movie was a sixty percent copycat of Independence Day II, up to and including some stolen phrases.  Yes important details were changed; the movie essentially occurs in Hong Kong, the aliens come from the sea, and we do not disable the mother ship with a virus. But so much more of this movie could have, with just a few twists and pulls here and there, been the oriental copycat of scenes from that 1998 movie.  That includes a harrowing last-second escape from the alien side of the breach and a fleet of craft coming to escort the two heroes to glory.  The aliens were very much like their IDII cousins--or at least their habits were.  They went from world to world, exterminating and terrraforming the planet for their occupation until they had exhausted its resources, and then they moved on to the next. Sound familiar?

The character development was stagnant, the dialog was okay, and the plotline believable, if you know how to suspend disbelief, but I found some things to be just too hard to swallow.  The movie has a fifteen year history to its plot (that is, the aliens started showing up fifteen years ago) and each alien attack brings terrible devastation to the target of its attack.  Why does the world seem pretty much the same, then, when the movie finally really gets started?  If the world endured fifteen years of increasing devastation then by the time this story starts, it would no longer be living in the prosperous 21st century, but in the impoverished, outlaw-driven stone age, with only a few enclaves of civilization still around, attempting to fight the good fight.

And finally, for those of you who are looking for a family-friendly show to watch, this ain't it.  The cursing is, if not profligate, certainly more than I would want my kids to hear if I had any.  In fact the very last scene shown in the middle of the credits is particularly funny, but starts out with a pretty vicious use of vulgarity which added little to the scene and just made me want to turn the show off.

So if I have all of this bad stuff to say why did I give the movie three stars?  Because I like a good monster flick.  And though I would have preferred more originality, I still laughed at the right spots and I still jerked up in surprise at the right spots.  Mr. del Toro may have hired some poor writers for the storyline, but it contained enough of the right stuff that I sat through the whole thing and well into the credits.

If you are not looking for high quality, and if you enjoy the bash-em-up  kind of flick that seems so popular on the screen these days, then you will probably be entertained by this movie.

There were many points where I felt like I was watching old-school Japanese mecha or a Gamera movie, but with all the necessary modern upgrades. My heart was warmed by the dedication to Ishiro Honda at the end. Felt like respectful closure/reparation for how some of this type of material has been abused in recent movies.

So I was like well maybe this will be a good movie than.......WRONG! freaking the movie failed to give you the blockbuster fights you wanted to see, instead you get idiots go out in the water with they plastic suits and get torn to part one by one. Like you mean to tell me no one has a suit that can deliver the goods to these fruity monsters. Then the whole 2 people bringing their brains together to control the gaint robots? really that concept is stupid. I can't stress on how the plot is boring and the fights are let down.

I see Mothra, Rodan and of course Godzilla in several of the monsters in this movie.  The idea of brawling with mechanical soldiers is cool and well done.  We get to see the good guys lose which is inspired for a monster movie. I also like how this movie is not American-centric.  The climatic scene set in Hong Kong is wonderful and it does not let facts ruin a good story.

Otherwise the movie has terrible character development and a plot riddled with facts and detail that is nearly impossible to follow. It is just big and dumb and next to impossible to follow if you try.  The acting is wooden and from the most stock of stock actors.

Again this is just a big dumb movie.  If you turn your brain off you can enjoy the cool monsters and machines but don't expect too much!",1384905600,,895,4.254437869822485

Giant robots fighting giant monsters without some kind of 'extra' message like 'man is the real monster' or 'don't destroy nature' is rather refreshing in it's simplicity.

It was rather hard to follow due to all the elements thrown in, none of them well developed.  And because of this, the parts that are supposed to tug at your heart don't.  Instead those parts were boring.  Paying for a bad movie always sucks.  I recommend you watch it when it comes on a basic cable channel or on a premium channel if you have a subscription.  And watch it then only if there is nothing else on.  So my advice is this: if you're the type who gets excited by just the presence of giant robots then this movie is for you.  If you prefer a decent storyline, look somewhere else.",1384819200,,721,4.159420289855072
5389787,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I'll be honest, when I first heard of this movie I thought it was going to be a failure.  I mean ""Transformers taking on an army of Godzilla(s)"" is like something out of a crossover comic book.  But once I heard that Guillermo del Toro was the director of this movie, I was convinced that it was going to be good.  And wow was I wrong.  This was better than good!

I loved every minute of this movie!  The robots are amazingly done and the monsters are wickedly cool!  The characters are done very nicely!  Heck, there is even a lot of emotion and dialogue in this movie.  Even the idea of the Pacific being a portal between worlds is actually a pretty clever and also very classic idea.

The robots are done very great.  I love how it has two humans controlling it and that both of the humans need to have a powerful connection to each other.  I can feel that a lot of science and hard work was put into the idea of this.  Even the monsters are greatly done as well.  The smallest detail can really tell us that these monsters were drawn and then made on computers.

The characters are also done amazingly as well.  Charlie Hunnam is one of my favorite actors, especially for his work in ""Sons of Anarchy"".  I love how he does his actors and also manages a connection between his character and Mako.  Idris Elba played a great character as well.  I love how we can tell that he is under a lot of pressure and yet also see that he manages to have authority over others as well.  Others actors like Charlie Day, Ron Perlman, and even Max Martini were great in this movie as well.

There is tons of emotion inside this movie.  We even get to see a lot of father-daughter, brother-brother, father-son, and also friend-friend side storylines in this movie.  Heck, even Mako has a backstory that really explains who she is and why she does what she does.

But most of all, the action is just awesome!  The fight scenes between the robots and the monsters are the best scenes so far.  Some are actually pretty clever and pretty intense.  Even the final fight scene is awesome.

I love this movie and I'm going to say that anyone into this kind of stuff is going to love it as well.  Buy it and watch it!",1384819200,2,2197,4.290243902439024

Don't want to spoil the movie for anyone so I won't go into details but from beginning to end this movie had me in the edge of my seat! I'm not one to buy hard copies of movies because I don't like rewatching them since I already know what's going to happen. Lets just say I'll be ordering a blueray copy. Plus I want to help support movies like this! Oh forgot to mention if you like any of the mech assault games or even have interest in the upcoming titanfall game you'll love this movie!!! But also if you like no bs action packed movies. ;),1384646400,2,796,4.141935483870967

Godzilla, Rodan and the like, the monsters are mortal and can be killed.  Why not just develop super weapons to blow the  things
apart?  This film reminded me of the Japanese monster films laced in with the Transformer movies.  Even Hong Kong gets mushed
up Tokyo-like in the movie; well done but I think a bit of plagerism.  Still,  enjoyed the film because of the effects and action though

The movie drew me in with the interesting concept of robots versus monsters plot line (ala Godzilla) and interested my inner 12 year old. Although very action packed and with good special effects, I just feel the movie missed it a bit. The plot to me didn't develop the things that it should of and concentrated too much on the action and fighting scenes which consumed most of the movie. I mean it took years to figure out how to breach the alien world and destroy it with a nuke? The lack of character development and lack of story about the alien origin was disappointing as well. To me the worst aspect was the poor  and over the top, like in a video game, acting with lines that made me wonder who wrote this. And granted, maybe this movie was designed to appeal to the 9 to 14 year old age range, that could have been done with some better known and better abled actors.

With that being said though, for an action movie it is ok and at least an original action movie idea for the summer as opposed to the sequels or remakes that seemed to dominant the summer. Pacific Rim is in a way a tribute to those type movies that came before it.

This is an action film of ""Robots vs. Godzilla"" that utilizes every cliche just for the fun of being able to.  To me, it seems like del Toro wanted to have a bit of fun, but still managed to pull off a little bit of camp without a healthy helping of cheese.

Yes, some of the characters are cliche.  There are stoic kung fu triplets, harsh blonde Russians, hopelessly clueless governments, and an over-the-top black market dealer, to name a few.  While some characters are far too heavy handed as to be annoying (looking at you, nerdy neurotic science duo), most are cliche enough to be fun, but the viewer still cares about their deaths and/or is drawn into the tension of their near death experiences.  I was surprised that I felt a little bummed when the first character died, about 10 minutes into the film, which I find rare in most modern action films.  And in an age when so many action movies care more about how much their monsters can destroy, (looking at you, Man of Steel) rather than a little character development, I can live with a little unoriginality in favor of a good old fashioned, if predictable, cinematic arc.",1384473600,,1228,4.554545454545455

5389846,3,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim(released July/13)stars,among others,Charlie Hunnam,Idris Elba,Rinko Kikuchi,Charlie Day,Robert Kazinsky,Max Martini and Ron Perlman. It's a standard slam bam,thank you mam good against evil,humans VS aliens film. You have seen it all before,and done much better,but this one ramps it up with alot of S/Fx.
The story finds the Earth being invaded by creatures called the Kaijus,coming through a portal in the Pacific Ocean floor. The militaries of the world unite and fund a division to protect everyone. To do so they build Jaegars,giant 200-300ft.high robots,powered inside by two humans. The fight at first is seeing its share of victories,but after a while they start to lose ground. The head of the military consortium decides to pull the funding plug,and the Jaegars are no more than superfluous machinery.
Five years pass and one of the original Jaegar crew members has been working on a long wall stretching from Alaska down through California. He is tapped once more to join the Jaegars,whom it seems,have been covertly running the program without any official funding. Its new crew,with some smart egg heads,through experimentation and crunching the numbers,find that the frequency of the attacks is increasing exponentially. They also eventually find out that there is a mind behind the attacks and the beasts all have a hive mentality,run by this creature,or creatures,down in the portal.
They decide to go on the offensive,after some crucial battles,and drop a nuclear device into the portal and detonate it. Just as two Jaegars stand on the brink of the hole they are told that the portal will only recognize the signature of one of their own. Therefore neither can get the bomb to where it is supposed to be. They are attacked and during it one of the Jaegars is so damaged they have to self destruct. The other drags a dead Kaijus with it and into the hole where they enter the portal successfully. Inside both crew members eject out of the Jaegar before it too detonates its nuclear core,thereby destroying the portal and the creatures. The film ends with the reuniting of the two crew persons on the surface.
I found the film well acted generally speaking and it was a pleasant surprise to see Ron Perlman as the black marketeer in Hong Kong. The Jaegar machines are similar in stature and look to the Transformers,while the creatures are similar in shape and size to the one in the most recent Godzilla film. However if you are at all familiar with director Del Toro's works,then think weird variations on the Godzilla theme. I did find some easily spotted poor editing in this film. One instance is when one of the Jaegar egg heads is talking to a crew member. The shot is from behind him,and what he is saying is not matching his mouth. Its a kind of thing I expect to see in far older movies where they thought you wouldn't pay that much attention to the mouth when shooting from behind. Another badly edited spot is where Raleigh talks to Mako after a hard battle asking her if she is alright. Trouble is his mouth isn't moving!?As with any Del Toro film he has a story to tell and this one is no different. He will tell it come hell or high water,no matter how much detail he has to go into. This one is full of detail which includes lots of personal conflicts and back stories. Depending on how much you can stomach,will determine how much you like this film. Del Toro hopes his S/FX will hide the shortcomings. And coming in at considerably over two hours,that's a lot to try and hide.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. This one disc edition has only commentary for an extra.
All in all a not bad entry by Del Toro with good S/Fx and good acting,but its length takes its toll as Del Toro insists on giving us every little detail he can dredge up. 3 stars.",1384473600,,3840,4.715773809523809

5389881,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I was really hoping this movie would be good, i mentally prepared myself for it to be bad, and when i saw the first reviews, i was excitation.

It's big, it's fun, and it isn't into itself, meaning it isn't trying to be anything that it's not. You grab a huge bucket of popcorn and set your brain to fun awesome mode.

The filmmakers had a great attention to detail, the mechanics of things were about as believable as you might imagine them to be, unlike transformers mechanics, which are just silly as hell. The only thing i looked at negatively was that they use helicopters to lift these robots... yea i don't think so.

But transformers, yea, transformers movies are just plain garbage. i don't like them for many reasons, the main two being lebeuffff and bay. Pacific rim has things like.... character development....not ridiculous amounts of slow motion action... no lebleueefff... etc... All in all, PR is far better of a film than any of the transformers movies, just because they are both about large robots doesn't mean you can call them the same.

Are there stretches in the suspense of disbelief? sure, like i mentioned with the helicopters, but then again were talking about a movie which has a portal to another dimension, so i think it works just fine within the defined reality.

The comic relief by charlie day was welcome, though it's a bit hard to believe the government would have quite that level of goofiness in a high level position, but i'm just digging for nitpicks.

The one thing that i'm on the wall about is the opening, since it starts year and years after the first monster attack. I think it was a good move to do that and have the recap of how things started, and a brave move at that, seeing as we're in the age of backstory backstory backstory. I just had an itch to see how it all started, and i hope they do a prequel movie of just that.",1384387200,,1875,4.483870967741935

It also gave me much pleasure to see new acting faces. I am so tired of the action actors today that get top salaries for half ass acting. The movie carried itself well and held unto my imagination and attention. The idea that aliens are entering our world through the sea was really creative and different. Kudos to the producer, director and stars. Okay...It's not Academy material but I found it enjoyable and worth the $4.99 rental.",1384387200,,562,4.686868686868687
5389884,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I still remember the first time I saw the preview for this movie, I was watching something on You Tube (again) and it clicked up. After that I spent the rest of the day with a big stupid grin on my face.
Happy to say 5 anxious months reading reviews, a trip to redbox, and TWO bug eyed hours in a dark room later I still have that grin. It's like being 5 on Saturday morning again!

Its like some one mixed Godzilla (1998), Transformers, Jurassic Park, Day After Tomorrow, Tron: Legacy, and a bunch of giant mecha anime and sci-fi cartoons and made the worlds tastiest stir-fry! :)
 It's exactly as it was described, big, loud, wet, action-packed and squishy.... be prepared to see the squishy. :P  It's a typical PG-13 sci-fi movie; could've done without a lot of mentioned curse words and there are quite a few of nose bleeds but in my opinion the only gore-gore is what happens to the kaiju. On another note, I like how they based it in China and had references to Japan (that is where it all started anyway), very cool. It is long but I read somewhere that it was to be longer so they could describe the characters in more detail. ({Awww Mr. Toro!!! I wouldn't have minded!}) But it's fine where they cut it in my unprofessional opinion.
My favorite characters are Newton the ""kaiju groupie"" scientist(he's crazy), Crimson Typhoon (and his triplets), Mako Mori, Gypsy Danger (of course!) and the flying kaiju .
Overall, cool movie. I wish there were more original movies like this instead of overused remakes/reboots and stale storylines.... Hmmm, this flick may have just earned a place on my shelf. :)

There are around four bro couples in this movie, each having to deal with different life challenges.
In a world where a dimensional rip in the ocean acts as a one way gate that lets giant monsters into our world, our heroes have to control giant robots that were built specifically for fighting said monsters. Here's the catch: not just anyone can control these robots, you need two people for each robot, and as if that isn't enough, they have to connect with each other on a level only equal to love. When our hero loses his bro in a tragic battle early on in the movie, he's forced to find another bro, but theres a twist.. the bro he ends up finding is... (what!?) a WOMAN!

Director and co-writer Guillermo del Toro and I have one thing in common.  We both grew up watching all those black and white ""monster"" films from the 1950's.  That includes Godzilla which is certainly an inspiration here.

In the near future, a crack in the Pacific seabed has unleashed a series of giant creatures (Kaiju) that attack the great coastal cities of the world.  Standard warfare (planes, tanks, missiles, etc.) while somewhat effective also manage to destroy the cities.  So a new weapon is quickly created.  An equally large robot.  Think of a combination of ""Iron Man"" (2008) and the fighting robots from ""Real Steel"" (2011) only 30 stories tall.  Inside the head of each Jaeger (German for ""hunter"") there are 2 pilots.  There are two reasons.  First, one pilot doesn't have the strength to maneuver the Jaeger, as it mimics the actions of the pilot.  But in order to get the strength of 2 pilots, they must move and work in unison.

In a pretty cool plot point, a method is developed where they mind-meld.  This has side effects, however, which includes a display of memories that both pilots experience.  This includes their own memories and those of their partner.  As the Kaiju are now appearing more frequently and in pairs, the Jaeger project's leader, Marshall Stacker Pentecost (great performance by Idris Elba), prepares for a final battle.  With only 4 Jaegers at his disposal, he plans to drop a nuclear bomb in the crack, which will hopefully seal the Kaiju into their death tomb.

While this goes on from the Marshall's Hong Kong headquarters, the rest of the world is busy building giant walls.  Yeah, good luck with that.  The 4 teams consist of one from Japan, whose pilots play basketball most of the time.  They wear red jump suits which matches their Jaeger.  Another is a blond man and woman from Russia.  Both of these teams never speak and are played by unrecognizable actors.  Want to guess what happens to them?  Another team is a father and son (Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky) from Australia.  Finally we have our hero, Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) a former crack pilot who dropped out 5 years earlier when his co-pilot and older brother was eaten by a Kaiju while on assignment in coastal Alaska.  He needs a partner and it just so happens there is this cute, trained but untested Japanese gal known as Mako (Rinko Kikuchi).

But Marshall Pentecost is reluctant to let her pair up.  Of course, he relents in the end.  I believe I counted 3 big battles with the Kaiju and they are all very well done.  The combatants are huge and so is the production.  The CGI is very effective.  I was also very fond of the Kaiju themselves.  We don't have to wait long to see one up close and personal either.  Take the look of monsters from Godzilla to the Alien creature, toss in some dragon and you have one creepy alien.

Oh yeah, that's where all these guys get here.  In a plot point that is glossed over, Earth's dinosaurs were just an exploratory party for some alien planet that attacks and consumes other planets.  I thought this was an interesting but undeveloped point.  While Idris Elba seems to elevate the film with his sheer presence, the movie has more than a few stumbling blocks.  First and foremost is the comic relief pairing of Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as competitive scientists trying to find out more about the creatures in order to predict their movement and attacks.  Some will welcome their appearance, for me it was distracting.  A del Toro veteran, Ron Perlman (""Hellboy"") makes an appearance as a savvy merchant dealing in dead Kaiju parts.

""Pacific Rim"" rises above many of its ilk by adding some simple but emotional story lines.  Elba gives the film a certain gravitas and the film certainly looks good.  At the same time, it is loud, predictable, full of clichs and too long.  For the genre, it's pretty damn good.  Pass the Jagermeister.",1384300800,2,3926,4.697503671071953

But Del Toro took a cast of new faces and pulled off a solid movie with a real interesting plot. In this movie, invasion doesn't come from outer space, but from the deeps of our very own oceans. The computer generated graphics were balanced so well with the acting and on going action that for a minute you almost forget that these awesomely huge machines are not real!

5389950,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Giant mechas versus colossal extradimensional monsters - what's not to love? Okay, so maybe the concept sounds a bit campy, and certainly could have come off that way if handled the same way as a Syfy movie of the week. But Pacific Rim delivers pure cinematic fun.  The special effects were amazing and certainly one of the great attractions of this movie. The design of both the giant mechas, the Jaegers, and the monsters, the Kaijus, was spectacular with great attention to detail. The look and movement of both seemed realistic for machines and creatures of their size.

I thought the acting was solid all the way around, with lots of interesting characters thrown into the mix. The need to have 2 pilots controlling a mecha, while a bit of a contrivance, does help lend itself to more character interaction and emotional interplay. These aren't just soldiers fighting together on a battlefield (which itself is a strong bond) - these are warriors who have their very minds linked in order to seamlessly control a 200 foot tall death machine.

Now granted you can't too tangled up in logic if you are going to enjoy this movie. For instance, the Kaijus always emerge from the exact same spot in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, so why not just have bombers on station ready to nuke the suckers as soon as they come through the portal while they are safely out in the middle of nowhere - well because then you wouldn't be able to make an awesome movie about giant robots fighting alien monsters. Also, the leaders of the world decide that instead of continuing to build more Jaegars, they should instead invest all their energy into building giant walls around civilization. Ignoring the fact that it takes your typical city traffic authority 5 years and 20 million dollars to fix a 5 mile stretch of road, why would anyone think a wall would be a better defense than giant robots. Clearly those in power didn't take the coolness factor into their calculations. Giant mechas always beat giant walls. Remember that if you ever find yourself on a city planning council.

So as long as you can leave the critical analysis at the theater door (or save it for the internet chat rooms afterwards), and you are someone who enjoys an action movie full of epic monster battles, you are sure to enjoy Pacific Rim.",1384214400,,2306,4.68641975308642

""Pacific Rim"" failed in three important categories:  Number one; it had no plot, Number two; it was loaded with copycat scenes from other movies and Number three; I didn't believe a bit of it.  Films such as, ""Godzilla, Rodan, Alien, and Avatar"" all had plots, were original and unique, and most important...they all made me believe what I was looking at.
Guillermo del Toro, is a great director, but must have been under pressure to perform because the film came off looking like a rushed, Japanese-British collaboration of the worst kind.  Well then, why did I give ""Pacific Rim"" three stars?  I gave it three stars for the one thing it had, ""entertainment value"".  The stereo-sounds, special effects, and gobs and gobs of fight scenes.  All of these things made ""Pacific Rim"" worth seeing. However, my favorite scenes in the movie were the ones with Japanese, child actor, Mana Ashida.  She is not on the screen long, but is definitely a scene-stealer.  Loved seeing Ron Perlman again, Guillermo never fails to create the wildest characters for his actor friend.  Perlman is able to play the most interesting caricature roles, even though I am still waiting for a Hell boy III.

The scientists are portrayed as absolute buffoons (even though they are the ultimately salvation of the planet) and the 20 something tough guys spend most of their time swaggering around trying to speak with a lower than natural voice ( they actually turn out to be the laughable ones ).

>If you ever though that Independence Day would have been vastly more entertaining with frakking huge mecha, well, it has taken a few years, but Guillermo Del Toro (as usual) has come through for us all.

This isn't a deeply philosophical movie, no great lessons about the human condition, nor is there much worry about much crossover between this films target audience and that of, say, Downton Abbey.  Giant monsters, giant mecha, lots of beautifully rendered carnage, and competent, capable actors who despite being in a ""summer blockbuster"", take their roles seriously and none phone in their performances in this deeply and lovingly trope-laden movie.  Most notable is Idris Elba, who needs to be in more films because Science.  Speaking of which, GLaDOS is present, but alas there is no cake; a fundamental flaw.  Lastly, there is a surprising--and appreciated--dearth of superfluous profanity and pointless nudity.  (Technically, no nudity at all; minor detail.)

I thought the set included a statue but in fact the statue is a case, the discs are housed in the back and stacked on top of one another. I would have gone with the regular edition if I realised as I now need to purchase a case and photocopy a cover to store the discs in my collection to avoid damaging the discs in this packaging.

5390010,4,B00A6UHC0U,"John loves Yoko and Jax loves Mako.  LOL

I have no idea what Charlie Hunnam's character's name is in this movie although I was watching the movie closely,  There is some fun robot fighting early on but then it is just waiting around for the ending - not enough fighting, some strange neurotic dating/pursuing Japanese girl stuff - UNBELIEVABLE - but it will certainly boost Japanese interest in Sons of Anarchy.

The visuals are really nice in this so easy on the eye and not as distressingly loud as other action films so definitely recommended for being somewhat not more of the same old same old Transformers (Japanese origin) Michael Bay stuff.  This is a little more special and I attribute that to Guillermo Del Toro.

One nice thing about this is that the base is set in Hong Kong which has always been of strategic importance.

It doesn't make any sense that these robots can't fly and have to be airlifted.  Some other stuff doesn't make any sense in the same vein so something for Cinema Sins.

ETA:  I've never seen Patlabor or the original Japanese films from the 1960s but I do find it weird that the point of entry is underwater in what looks like an open fault line exposing the earth's core, the kaiju excrement contaminating Manila is remiscent of the spread of the leaked Fukushima radiation, the kaiju themselves retain characteristics of marine animals similar to the recent discovery of a new humpback dolphin species off Australia and a new type of hammerhead shark has been discovered off the coast of South Carolina.

What if the Kaiju are actually mutations caused by Fukushima radiation?  What if the kaiju excrement is toxic because it is radioactive.  What if the underwater breach represents a fault line exacerbated by secret frakking which caused the 3-11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami?

Mako Mori's name looks like Shark Dead and she's wearing a house sweater covered in Dead LEAVES.

Some of the kaiju do seem sharklike and another clue is that you can keep a kaiju skin parasite alive after the host dies by soaking it in ammonia - sharks pee through their skin - which is why only the fin is considered edible by the Chinese.

There's a lot of Chinese writing on the Hong Kong base and during the audition duel between John and Yoko, I'm reminded of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Come-a-Stranger-The-Tillerman-Series-5/dp/068980444X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Come a Stranger (The Tillerman Series #5)</a>&nbsp;which mentions twice that a little girl dances so naturally and effortlessly that it brings a smile to the face which I was fortunate to experience for myself from a SLO MO video off the new Apple iphone of a little girl who dances on Broadway - in slow motion, you can see that no matter how the same moves maybe imitated, some people are naturally more graceful.

The Newt(on) character looking a little Rivers Cuomo of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undone-The-Sweater-Song/dp/B000W21H9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undone -- The Sweater Song</a>&nbsp;fame gets schooled by Hellboy himself that if you mind meld with a kaiju, the kaiju mind melds you right back.  Tsk, tsk.

In this film, it's called DRIFTING - which is weird because of the meaning of drifting from car racing.

5390021,3,B00A6UHC0U,"An apt subtile for PACIFIC RIM could be ""It's exactly what it appears to be."" Del Toro's latest film depicts an invasion of giant monsters (kajiu) and humanity's defense with giant robots (jaegers). It's mixed martial arts on an epic scale. Oh, sure, there's a story told between bouts where ever more imaginitively designed creatures from the deep engage increasingly cooler robots in constatntly larger, more destructive street fights. In one, the jaeger uses a naval destroyer as a bat! The characters and story are predictable and cliched and yet...I liked them. Sections of the story, involving Charlie Day (as a scientist with a clue on what the monsters are up to) and Ron Perlman (as a black marketeer specializing in distribution of extracts of kajiu body parts) play like a live-action anime. Del Toro has clearly thought out his universe. It's a simple puzzle, but the parts fit nicely. Additionally, the film is appropriate for younger viewers, 9 and up, who aren't that afraid of their own shadows, Any romance is chaste and any gore is limited to the blue goo running through the kajiu bodies.
Unfortunately, extras are limited. There are several 'making of...' featurettes, but they are quite short. It is well known that Guillermo was to direct The Hobbit until problems at MGM dragged on so long, the window on his schedule closed. With the release the the extended Hobbit, we get to see the gold standard of Special Editions.

5390064,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Mindless film.  No, that is not a bad thing.  Every once in a while, people like a film they can turn their brain off and just look at the pretty lights and pictures.  To me, Pacific Rim was always going to be such a film.  I never expect a solid story, character development, or even ""realistic"" situations.

What I expected was big robots and big monsters having a good old fashion grudge match through various locations.  Was good enough for the old Godzilla films and it is good enough to carry a few films today.  PR delivers just that.  Big robots over there, Big monsters over there.  Ocean, cities, underwater locations back there... and go.

My only real gripe is they focused too much on one robot.  Nothing against Gypsy Danger, great bot.  But, this was supposed to be a world defended by big robots.  Let, we get 4 with any real screen time and the other 3 don't get much time at all.  The big monsters got more defining screen time, so you can tell their specific details.  Missed opportunity.

5390068,5,B00A6UHC0U,Pacific Rim is a American take on the Godzilla destroys Tokyo type of Japanese movie.  It does hold together well enough for the traditional scifi fan to enjoy.  I enjoy the Godzilla movies except for the fact that their voices don't match the lip movements of the actors.  That always annoyed me.  In this movie their words match their lip movements.  In addition there is a better than average story line and plot than the Japanese Godzilla movies.  I like the fact that this movie tries to get to the root of the problem of these gigantic monsters and solve that problem of monsters coming through a dimensional rift rather than simply destroying the bad monsters.  It's a nice variation on the alien invasion theme.  The graphics are good but not spectacular.  The movie was engaging enough to keep a Godzilla fan interested.  I would like to see more over the top movies like this one.,1383523200,,890,4.647435897435898

5390070,2,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim is an odd blend of Independence Day and Starship Troopers. Independence Day was clich but fun; the actors made it work. Pacific Rim took the plot, made it more clich, and then forgot to get good actors or a script for them to work from. The few good actors it had were wasted. The acting and script reminded me of Starship Troopers; a style reminiscent of people not comfortable talking to other people.

If you come to the movie with no expectations you won't be disappointed. A great original idea,a battle between giant robots and monsters that destroy Tokyo. Well original in the sense its been done hundreds of times so maybe not so original. I would have enjoyed this movie when I was ten; who doesn't love giant robots and monsters destroying Tokyo, I grew up with it. But if you're going to put it on the big screen and charge money for it step up the game. I'm sorry the film didn't work (for me), maybe if they'd had all the Power Rangers it would have been more coherent.",1383523200,,994,4.4316939890710385
5390071,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Very well made monster movie. If you are looking for Shakespeare, this is not your movie.
If however you are looking for massive robots fighting huge monsters, you should like this.",1383523200,,181,4.870967741935484
5390072,4,B00A6UHC0U,"So how does one rate a movie like this?  I see comments about no character development, shallow stories, and so on.  If you compare this to 'Lincoln' or similar movies and consider a rating to be based on things like character development, realistic motivations and emotion, and how 'Best Picture Oscar Worthy' a movie is, then Pacific Rim is obviously a 1.  But then again, so are most movies ever made.

Instead, I choose to rate this within the ""Big, Dumb, Plotless, Loud, Action Movie"" category, because that's what it is.  And within that category, it's actually somewhat smarter than most with a relatively coherent plot.

Sure, the science is absolutely the worst kind of technobabble, but no more than much of what you see in any Star Trek movie/episode.

Sure, the characters are pretty stereotypical, but there are some interesting twists - including one I never saw coming but in retrospect it made perfect sense - amongst the more predictable elements.

The way the movie starts is brilliant.  Most movies require a long setup... And if this had been like most movies, you would wait for 30 minutes to see the first monster, and probably another hour before you saw the first giant robot designed to fight the monster.  That doesn't happen here.

The action is top notch in the beginning and end of the movie.  The story drags a bit in the middle, but this is the case in a lot of films, and it's not too badly done in any event.  The acting is average to good for the most part even if slightly over the top at times.

At the end of the day, this is a movie that ranks up there with Independence Day and Armageddon as 'guilty pleasures' for me, and it has enough changes to the usual formula to go along with the truly spectacular action, to be worth recommending.  Just don't expect it to win an Oscar for Best Picture.  As long as you're ok with giant robots fighting giant monsters, you'll be entertained and maybe even just a bit surprised.",1383523200,,1957,4.564469914040115
5390073,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim is the multi-cultural culmination of Japan and Hollywood, coming together to create a film jam-packed with a story that wastes no time to make its points. Few blockbusters manage to inject each gigantic action sequence with emotional weight the way Pacific Rim does. There's a give and take with the film that makes for an incredibly satisfying summer movie experience, where you walk away from the film feeling energized. The special effects are also gorgeously detailed, with every Kaiju and Jaegar having a distinctive look (unlike the Transformers films).

I would have liked to have seen a little more gender diversity amongst the cast, but I thought the character of Mako was handled fairly well. Where she could have just become some kind of love interest like many women put in these kind of character roles in Hollywood blockbusters often fall into, Mako is instead depicted as someone with her own motivations, strengths, and weaknesses. She isn't there to be a sex object for the male lead to win, but an important part to the story's overall narrative.

Pacific Rim seems like director/writer Guillero del Toro and writer Travis Beach lovingly crafted every second of the film. It is a love-letter to anime like Evangelion and films like Godzilla. While the movie is derivative of these under-utilized properties, it is one of the few original films of this scope you'll see coming out of the theaters anytime soon.

Wildly original, gorgeous, and full of epic action, Pacific Rim is an essential watch for anyone that enjoys big blockbusters.",1383523200,,1567,5.019230769230769
5390074,5,B00A6UHC0U,"A fantastic film.  For fans of anime or kaiju films this movie is a must watch.  It is a great film with epic set pieces and action, but the human factor of this story is also great.  The people within this movie serve to round out the spectacle with real 3 dimensional people.
The special features are an enriching experience as well.  You can go in depth with the methods and techniques Guillermo Del Toro used to create the machines, monsters, and other elements that compose the world that he has created.  By far my favorite movie of the summer with special features that make this a more rewarding experience.

5390081,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I grew up enjoying Japanese anime which defenders of the Earth fight against galactic invaders. Often the highlight of the show was the wham-slam between a towering mecha and a marauding monster. ""Pacific Rim"" brings back the excitement of these stories, with modern CG wizardry upping the oomph.

I also appreciate the human elements of the story. It reminds me of those old Westerns in w/c the reluctant-hero finds redemption in his inner demons through his struggle against the bad guys. ""Pacific Rim"" appeared to be following this morality tale, until the big-screen fights took over and ran with the film all the way to the end. I wish the film brought the inner-conflicts of the Jaeger pilots to a close, but then maybe this overshot the film's budget ... or maybe this was held off until the sequel.

Remember how awesome Godzilla and other monster movies were when you were a kid? There are pleasant happy memories of just how amazing they were. You go back years later and see how cheezy they are and can even be a little disappointed.

It's CGI special effects are really well done, which is a good thing, because they help the viewer totally not care that the plot is such a joke.  The main character played by Charlie Hunnam may as well have been played by almost anyone, however he did well-enough with what he had to work with.

this is a FUN movie for you.

be warned: many cried and moaned about the long dialog scenes and what not BUT when it is time to fight?  It was worth the dialog. About that, for this being a movie with a green screen, CGI Mecha and Monsters the acting is better than you would expect.

This is a really fun movie.  Acting is solid enough, story is functional, and we finally get to see a big-budget giant robot movie that looks cool :-)

It was, and I will, and he'll have it in his stocking. Charlie Humman did a good job. I was afraid I'd just see a Sons of Anarchy character, and there were brief flashes of that, mainly when he was walking, but other than that I didn't feel like I had a Sons character trespassing in this action film.

5390170,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific rim is a conglomerate which marries together the classic Japanese monster films (think Godzilla) with a dash of something like Iron Man and Transformers thrown in for good measure. Just think if the creatures HP Lovecraft wrote about battled against gigantic robots and you have a good idea of what this movie is like. As an added plus,put guillermo del toro in charge of putting all these ideas together and what you have is a movie with an intriguing premise, and impressive visuals to boot.

What I love about the robots (or Jagers as their called in the film) is that while their both huge and extreamley powerful,(Where told in one scene in particular a certain Jager has 50 diesel engines per square inch of muscle fiber) stomping through the eye's of hurricanes and towering over the biggest sky scrappers,they still have a great sense of vulnerability about them. None of these machines are invincible and seem to be just as flawed and vulnerable as the people who created them. For being able to convey both these ideas at once is very impressive if you ask me.
Pacific Rim cleverly weaves together all the extravaganza of a summer block buster while being able to also maintain interesting human characters that are more than just convenient plot points. Their execution is a step behind the effects but serviceable nonetheless.
The biggest downfall of Pacific Rim is probably the lack of  del Toroism in this film if that makes any since. His touch is certainly their but is less prevalent than in his other films and feels a bit buried underneath  all the cannon fodder.

The 3D.
I have to say this film is a huge 3D achievement. From beginning to end your visuals are constantly treated to some of the best 3D to date,with the only downfall being a sparse scene here or their without 3D transfer. City landscapes,the cold barren Antarctic,military compounds,all look gorgeous in 3D and I felt like I was riding in a Jager myself the whole way threw.

In conclusion Pacific Rim is a great ride and worth every extra penny for the 3D. Some fan of del Toro may feel a bit disappointed his touch is a little less noticeable here,but I consider that a back handed compliment for what's otherwise a great film.",1383091200,,2225,4.709511568123394

5390191,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Starting this post off, I thought I would lay out my setup:
TV: LG 47LM6700
Color Calibration: Custom - similar to what is found on forums/websites starting with C ;-)
3D Settings: Depth = 15 (50% increase from standard  starts at 10, max 20), Viewpoint= +5 (50% increase from standard, starts at 0, range of +/-10).

First thing I want to mention is that the color was excellent.  Bright, vivid colors throughout the movie while in 3D mode.

The first 3D aspect I want to talk about is the gimmick/pop-out experience of the movie.  While the movie lacked any MAJOR notable pop-out scenes, it does have occasional pop-out moments (especially in the battle scenes).  If you are looking for in your face gimmicks all over the place, this probably isn't the best movie for you.  There are definitely a lot of places they could have incorporated more wow factor in that regard.  The movie has a slight feel to it of having a glass window between the action and your couch.  That is NOT to say that you will not be fully immersed in the experience (more to come on this when I discuss depth), but they really left something to be wanted in the gimmick area (if that is what you are looking for).  Overall, I felt that this did not deteriorate the quality of the 3D experience in any way.  It would have been nice to occasionally have the sword swinging/missile flying at you, but I can live without it because of how well I think they did with the 3D experience as a whole.

Now, let me tell you what I LOVED about the experience (yes, I feel this movie really does capture 3D as an experience).  Perhaps it is because I recently tweaked my 3D settings (although I did reset everything to factory just to see if it was the settings and noticed little change) to have a little more depth/pop, but I felt that this was one of the BEST 3D movies I have seen at home in terms of DEPTH.  One would be very hard pressed to find a scene in which they could not FEEL the depth of the scene.  The use of environment is outstanding and really brings the viewer into many of the scenes.  You can feel the dimensional layers as if you were standing inside of them for most of the movie.  They really use anything and everything in a way that creates a realistic and enjoyable 3D environment.  The rain scenes are especially amazing and really make you feel like you might need an umbrella.  Pillars, People, and particles are EVERYWHERE and add to the depth in a way that is not often experienced.  Things as simple as Sparks flying in-front of and behind the pilots allow the viewer to be engulfed.  I was worried about the underwater scenes (after watching it in 2D) losing depth, but boy was I mistaken.  The use of airbubbles continued to impress and as with out of water, the dust (well in underwater case, sand? Haha) makes you want to run for cover.  As much as I loved the depth, I do feel like they really had a glass wall between the audience and the movie.  It is noticeable especially as the rain splatters n and ocean waves crash into the screen.  I didn't really lose anything because of those features, and personally, I think they really help bring it all together.  I just wanted to make sure and point that out in case you are someone who does not like that sort of visual effect.

Overall, I this would have to be one of the best overall Home 3D experiences I have had.",1383091200,,3371,4.386473429951691

As I though about it, I realized the case is actually pretty cool as well - it certainly  gets everyone attention when they see it on the shelf.

As to the movie...well, you either like giant mecha fighting Godzilla-like monsters or not. I've loved the genre ever since I lived in Japan in the early 1970's.

The money they spent (~$100M) is up there on the screen to see.  The IMAX 3-D was especially impressive.  The US box office was low for a ""big"" summer action movie, but Pacific Rim is doing really well overseas.",1383004800,,518,4.410526315789474
5390215,4,B00A6UHC0U,"In the theaters, Pacific Rim was awe inspiring.  No it didn't have oscar worthy acting, and it was never going to win for best screenplay either, but it didn't need to.  That wasn't what Pacific Rim was about.  This movie was a loving homage to the kaiju and mecha genre that if nothing else American audiences would recognize from the last 5-10 minutes of any episode of Power Rangers.  Gigantic robots fist punching even bigger monsters before whipping out ungodly huge swords to slice them apart or plasma cannons to blow them away.  A lot of movies try to hide the fact that they are doing something simplistic like this by watering everything down with unneeded story or angst to try and be ""deep"".  Pacific Rim does not.  You get just enough story and characters to support the giant robot fights and give you a bit of a breather between fights, and it was truly glorious.

The problem with this DVD/Blu-Ray/etc is that the movie benefited GREATLY from being on the big screen.  250 foot tall robots simply look better on the big screen than they do on the small one, and the sound track, while still good coming out of your television is nothing compared to how it rang out in the theaters.

As for the things it could control, this set had a lot of fun stuff tucked away in it.  My biggest complaint about the layout though is that the location of the extras seemed counter intuitive to me.  It came with two disks (well 4 disks, 2 DVD and 2 Blu-Ray), one labeled Movie and one labeled Extras.  I put the extras disk in first as I had seen the film three times in theaters, and was greatly disappointed by how little there was of value on it.  Then a few days later I put the movie disk in to watch it, and found all of the awesome extras I had been wanting the first time around.  Why were all of the best extras not on the disk labeled Extras?  Is there a 1 disk version floating around out there with all of this and they just scraped up some additional mediocre material for a hand waved second disk?

Regardless, this movie is a lot of fun.  In the theaters I would have given it a full 5 stars.  As a DVD/Blu-Ray, I have to dock this product one star based on the reduced experience of seeing it on the small screen and for the odd extras layout.  But please, don't let any of that stop you from buying this set.  I am waiting with baited breath for Pacific Rim 2, and strong DVD sales will help hasten that.",1383004800,2,2422,4.30242825607064

5390257,4,B00A6UHC0U,This isn't typically my kind of film but it was fun! I was turned off when I first watched the trailer for this and saw it was basically a 'Godzilla' type film. Despite that this film is done in a way which works even with that concept.,1382832000,,236,4.042553191489362

5390259,2,B00A6UHC0U,"I wasn't interested in this movie when I first heard about it because it seemed pretty lame, but then I was surprised to hear it had great reviews from everybody watching it so I thought I'd give it a shot. Holy crap was it boring! I went to clean my kitchen after a while and when I came back it seemed like a plot was starting to develop ... we find out something was controlling the monsters and then they were going to take over Earth .... so I began to get interested ... finally a plot was developing ... something to watch ... but it went NOWHERE. We just learned that was the plot then it went back to robots vs dino monsters fighting. In completely unrealistic ways. I LOVE action, but not constantly.

It's a good movie for people who don't want to think and just want to see explosions and destruction and fighting, but I need my brain to always be working .. I need to think about everything while watching a movie or I just get SO FREAKING BORED and this movie doesn't give you anything to think about.

At least with a $1.25 R@dbox rental I can keep the video 3 days for the same price. No wonder people pirate movies. Streaming with time limits is for the birds.

5390264,3,B00A6UHC0U,"Overall an ok movie. The acting was nothing to write home about, but was not terrible either. The graphics were middle of the road as well. Where this movie really falls short is the story line.  Just like Oblivion, the Pacific Rim story line was taken straight out of the script from Independence Day and follows it to a T. Movies like Oblivion qnd Pacific Rim make me wonder if there is still anyone left in Hollywood that has any imagination left and is not content to just make new spins on stories and try to pass them off as new.",1382832000,,535,4.297029702970297

The combo pack comes with 4 discs and the free DIGITAL HD version. The discs are sandwiched two to a side and must be carefully pulled apart. The 4 discs include the Blu-ray 3D, 2D, DVD, and a Blu-ray Special Features disc.

The digital version must be redeemed by 10/22/15.

The 3D version is more fun than the 2D version and draws the viewer into the action effectively. I watched the 2D version first and then the 3D version later and found the 3D effects to be well used. I think this movie will wear well and can be enjoyed on repeated viewings. The video and audio are good and the surround channels are well utilized.

There wasn't a story line or plot to this movie, it just kind of bounced where ever it really wanted to. The acting was HORRIBLE, these actors and actresses should be fired and fined for the horrible display of professionalism they showed on screen. The visual effects, although at times stunning, were all the movie relied. Therefore I have to say that the effects were lacking and repeated over and over again. How many times do they want us to watch of one of the big robots get launched? How about watching yet another big lizard for 2 hours. This movie should have been a TV special and that's about it.

This is completely false since I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole disc specifically for special features! 14 featurettes, a directors notebook, and the digital artistry of Pacific Rim. There is also a commentary track to go along with this feature among many more.

5390283,5,B00A6UHC0U,"In Japan the Kaiju movie has a long and illustrious history.  The Japanese invented the giant monster/rubber suit movie and it is still a very successful export.  On the other hand, Guillermo del Toro has done a respectable job in translating this genera into a fine piece of popcorn cinema. The plot is simple, straightforward, and acceptably believable.  The special effects/audio/cinematography are as good as Hollywood can create.  While there are no rubber suits in evidence and all the non-people characters are computer generated, the monsters are, well, monstrous.  I mean it.  EVERYTHING in this movie is BIG!!  The only drawback I can see is that you loose a bit of impact when the movie moves to a small(er) screen.  Even on a 50+ inch LED with 5.1 surround sound and 1080p, the feeling is not quite the same.  If this is your first time seeing it then you need to find an iMax 3D theater to see it in first.  That is where Pacific Rim is in it's glory.  Still, if you have a big screen, home cinema sound system, and a blue-ray player I don't think you will be disappointed. No nudity, some mild to moderate language, and lots and lots and LOTS of metal crunching, monster mashing sci-fi violence.",1382745600,,1209,4.65566037735849
5390284,2,B00A6UHC0U,"Even in Sci-Fi, where the impossible is possible, a good Sci-Fi movie retains some sense of realism; especially one such as this. The movie starts out with a grim tale to set up the plot and dares to make you believe you are in for a serious venture. 2 hours later you will discover you should have been set up for a rock-em sock-em power rangers movie instead.

I won't get into it too much because of spoilers, but it is amazing how as the movie goes on the robot reveals more and more weapons and utilities that could have been used in all the fights before it. I guess the crew just liked the challenge? And the end....really? Just way too much logic is lost and there were a lot of ""come on!!"" moments. The movie seemed like it wanted to be taken serious, didn't work.

The point is immersion is lost when things get too unbelievable. Yes I understand there were giant aliens and robots....what's to believe?

The good ones make it happen, this one did not. If you just want to see giant things fight each other with some cool effects have at it, just don't take it seriously.",1382745600,2,1081,4.341584158415841

I believe that too many people have been brainwashed into thinking that movies can only be about serious, dark, gritty, evil things that sap your emotional strength. However, I, being a logical and thinking human being know that you need to take breaks from the grim, dark, gritty, evil themes that seem to be all to much in so many movies. People need a break from that stuff to enjoy something fun, entertaining for a change. All you nay-sayers need to just save it and let people enjoy this great movie. There is too much darkness in movies now a days. The theater should have a healthy balance of darkness and light. Not just darkness all the time. All you nay-sayers need to also stop having a problem with people liking something that isn't dark and evil.

5390289,1,B00A6UHC0U,"I'm sorry, I screwed up by actually thinking while watching this movie. The trailer really made it look like it would be an awesome flick, as did the high customer ratings, but just minutes into the film, regret sunk in.

First off, do you honestly believe the world's nations would enter a totally benevolent pact, without wanting anything to gain? Just building a single Jaeger would cost in the hundreds of billions, likely trillions, of dollars; knowing how shaky the global economy, how is all of this going to be paid for? Also, which contractor is going to build these monstrous robots, and how likely do you think it is that they will be completely honest in their initial cost estimates when making their pitch to win the contracts? It was also pretty ridiculous when the nations opted to discontinue funding the Jaeger program, so it became ""underground"". Seriously, how the heck could this program survive if it's underground? They never explained where it is getting its funding.

As for the Jaegers, why wouldn't they develop them to be controlled remotely, like drones? This would completely eliminate loss of life for the pilots and their likelihood of suffering an injury.

And then, you have to consider the billions upon billions it would cost cities to rebuild after a cataclysmic attack from a Kaiju--where is that money coming from, and is Allstate also going to add ""Kaiju attack"" coverage to auto insurance plans? I would probably move to Texas because staying in California would be way too expensive for me.

Another thing, the aliens--don't you think they should diversify with the arsenal? Being a Navy veteran myself, I know a thing or two about military preparation. They have the Kaijus, which proved to be highly effective in their initial assaults, but didn't the aliens learn anything after losing their first Kaiju to a Jaeger? Having giant weapons may be awfully intimidating, but you're sacrificing quite a bit of mobility. Also, how come the aliens didn't think to build more portals? Seriously.

If you're into mind-numbing dialogue and giant robots fighting giant aliens, this movie is for you. But, if you're unfortunate enough to have developed critical and analytical thinking skills, it's going to be a LOOOOOOOOONG two hours.",1382745600,5,2269,5.007957559681698

More importantly, I found the concept of the mind meld  interesting and I didn't wish there was more time to explore this further.

The plot and the characters, on the other hand, are the products of a Hollywood committee.  You can almost see the checklist being ticked off.  It is hard to believe that Del Toro directed this movie, and even harder to believe that he wants to produce a sequel.

The movie has a completely predictable plot, with over-the-top characters who are forced to recite some of the most painfully bad dialogue you could imagine.  You can almost hear Del Toro yelling ""Care about these people!  Care about them!""  But you just don't.  You've seen it all before in movies like Independence Day and Transformers.  You know exactly what's going to happen.  You've had all those buttons pushed too many times before, and it just doesn't work.

What makes it worse is knowing that Del Toro could have done so much better.  When Michael Bay makes a stinker, you don't care because you know he has no real talent.  Guillermo Del Toro, on the other hand, had made some great movies.  Hopefully he will make more in the future, but ""Pacific Rim 2"" won't be one of them.",1382659200,2,1209,4.558139534883721

5390307,4,B00A6UHC0U,"There peril is enormous, the action, consistent, and the visual effects are simply stunning. Pacific Rim is easily one of the most visually appealing and action packed sci-fi adventure movies of the year. The key to truly enjoying the film is by approaching it with the correct lens.
If what your after is the emotional and intellectual complexity of some of Del Toro's more notarized works-- indeed it would be fare to surmise that this pic will leave you bored and disappointing. But, if what you want is a simple escape into fantastic, exhilarating, monster-robot excitement, then strap in because Pacific Rim is sure to deliver. My initial impression was feeling thrown back into a whirlwind of childhood nostalgia. The thrill of coming home after school watching back-to-back episodes of Power Rangers or Super Human Samuri all came rushing back, but updated and even more gigantic!
To be duly noted, Del Toro does not simply offer a completely mind-numbing movie experience with Pac. Rim. Instead, in his classic fashion, the beauty and depth lie in the subtleties. Certainly the film makes no tremendous attempt at positing any kind of overt social or political statement. But, through very simply gestures, Delo Toro brilliantly crafts a film that celebrates friendship, unity, creativity, and above all, that youthful notion of overturning tremendous odds with shear imagination and gusto.

Not all the blu rays out there are the same, but you can see that Guillermo made sure this movie looks gorgeous. Avatar is another movie that looks amazing despite my tv being old. Other movies don't look so good, or the producers don't care to make a quality transfer to blu ray. This movie is great. I bought the version with 3d, 2d, dvd and digital. And this is why I give only 2 stars. I thought there wouldn't be a problem with the digital version. I own a mac, and an apple tv. And now I'm finding out I can't transfer the movie to iTunes. To stream the movie I have to use a website called flixster, that means I can't use it in my apple tv.

Instead of including the standard Digital Download (which typically gets downloaded from iTunes or a similar entity), they have chosen ULTRAVIOLET.  When I bought this movie, I was not informed what exactly UltraViolet was.  Here's what you need to know:

1. This is a really good movie!  Buy it, just don't buy it via UltraViolet.
2. You are REQUIRED to set up TWO ACCOUNTS in order to even download this movie from UltraViolet.  (A Flixster account & an UltraViolet account)
3. You are then REQUIRED to download an application to your computer called FLIXSTER DESKTOP.  I try to keep my computer pretty lean as far as what I download, so this was discouraging to me.
4. You have NO ACCESS whatsoever to the movie file that has just taken a very long time to download onto FLIXSTER DESKTOP.  There's no way to copy it to your phone or to iTunes, or anything else.
5. In order to watch it on your iPhone, you must download the FLIXSTER APP.  Then, you have to sign in, which brings up your movie.  Then & only then can you watch the movie that you've paid for.

Ultraviolet claims that you can get your movie, when you want it, how you want it, but this is MISLEADING.  We should all have a right to own our movies digitally in a format that we want, especially when we pay extra to have this digital copy.

As I watching this movie, especially how it starts off in the beginning, I was emotionally charged thinking ""Kick that monster's ass"" by the fight scenes with the robots battling the monsters, the dramatic scenes, and the special effects were awesome as well.

5390343,2,B00A6UHC0U,"I watched ""Pacific Rim"" last night and was just completely turned off by it.  I know it got all of these rave reviews, but aside from the excellent CG, I was just totally bored by this turkey and couldn't see what all the fuss was about.  Most of the ""acting"" was so painful that it was as if all the actors were being directed to act as if they'd just graduated from the ""Close Cover Before Striking School of Over-The-Top Over-Acting"" or something.  I hate it when the characters are nothing but over-used stereotypes that we've all seen a thousand times in a thousand equally bad movies.  I did not find the forced acting styles cute or amusing; simply annoying.  Even Ron Perlman, who is a decent enough actor, sucked in his role; even he succumbed to this cartoonish style of acting.  In fact, the whole thing reminded me of some of the current crop of kid's cartoons.  I mean I get that del Toro was doing a kind of homage to the Godzilla movies and such that I actually enjoyed as a kid.  Back then, those were fun due in large part to the fact that they were so cheesy.  I loved looking for the occasional hidden sticks and such that would unintentionally pop onto the screen.  That's not to say that Pacific Rim did not have any good moments; there were actually a few fun scenes; a few (very few) actual funny gags and such sprinkled here and there.  But there was always a real earnestness and seriousness with those original monster flicks that I watched in the 50's and early 60's that was entirely missing in Pacific Rim.  I guess times have become way too sophisticated these days to try and accurately re-create those more innocent times and movies of the past.  For me, Pacific Rim only manages to come across as insincere and phony; purposefully light and airy-fairy.  The early Godzilla stuff was funny precisely because it took itself so seriously, whereas Pacific Rim does not.  To me, Pacific Rim was also one long, extended marketing ad designed to get kids 8-12 interested in buying Kaiju and Jaeger toys, the royalties of which I can only assume would kick back to Guillermo del Toro and company.  I don't know, maybe I'm just so old and cynical that I can't see the forest for the trees anymore.  But I just hated the predictability of it all, the horrid acting, the awful writing, etc.  The only thing of interest to me throughout was the CG stuff.",1382486400,12,2375,4.509345794392523

Bad
1) Predictable story with stock characters. (How with Del Toro?)
2) Action sequences were dark and hard to follow, a lot of blur ala Transformers. This was a promised improvement that fell short.
3) Too much of an over-simplified story. I don't think this told the story people wanted to see.
4) A lot of bad logic, bad science and bad psychology.

Ugly
1) A big disappointment: the lackluster response this movie saw in the market may cripple other attempts to break this genre into the mainstream.

It's not cynical and it's just a straightforward film about good guys in big robots fighting big alien monsters. It's a popcorn movie all the way.  what is really good about this movie is that unlike many cynical films the military people are the good guys!.  there's NO traitors or such crap or soldiers going mad instead it's just a solid flick about good military guys battling aliens. It's not a deep movie with great acting , nor was it intended to be.  Your kid will love this film and unlike gang rap crap or such he won't get the message that good guys are in fact the bad guys etc.  The special effects are very top notch in this movie!; as this was a very big budget flick. However if you want some kind of deep movie with deep characters go somewhere else.  This looks very good in 3d and I would say , watch it that way if possible. If you just want a feel good film about good versus evil then this movie is for you. This is not a great movie but it's a pure fun movie that is simple and very safe for kids and for adults who like all kinds of flicks, people like me, and I even  watch the sinister giallo movies  and that's not the type of films that kids should ever watch!",1382400000,2,1291,4.099206349206349

It was reminiscent of Godzilla which was great but the idea that the good guys weapons only worked at close range was stupid.

Also the killing of all the main characters was idiotic, the hero and his girlfriend used an escape pod to survive but everyone else went down with their ships. That sure depletes your troops.

Why was the last alien warrior pregnant? The aliens built all of their warriors and certainly making one of them pregnant would hinder their performance. Must be stupid aliens.

What is with portal? It was under water and when the hero was in the enemy world, all he did was set the bomb to go off and drift upward with only seconds to spare.  Hello, that was a thermal nuclear bomb, he couldn't get far enough away in an hour let alone seconds.

That said, it is a 'fun' movie, but not a 'good' movie.  It will not win any awards for its great script, or for performances.  A lot of people will not be interested, or will walk away from this, like my mom did.

5390379,4,B00A6UHC0U,"***Please note, review is based on the 3D version***
-So I saw this movie available when I was strolling through a BestBuy Store, read the back of the cover and thought to a myself, ""would this be something I like?"". I decided to read some reviews on amazon. While the reviews are a mixed bag of positives and negatives. I kept reading about ""Guillermo del Toro"" who I believe directed the film but I couldn't match the name with a face. then I read that this movie is made by the same person who made Hellboy into a movie. Let me start off by saying, Hellboy was not something I liked at all, nor any of his other movies. For Example, the story, characters and feel of Hellboy and other movies by Del Torro are in my mind, extremely cheesy, and often annoying. This movie seemed to have a bit of a different feel, and after reading more on what the 3D version is like, I decided it would be worth buying to add to my ever expanding collection of bluray 3D movies. I watched this movie last night, without high expectations. I popped in the movie, grabbed a soda and some munchies, and watched with amazement. The 3D effects and CGI are truly top notch. There were parts when I thought to myself, ""now this is what 3D movies need to look like"", IMHO.  With the sound cranked up, feeding my ears with awesome sounds and my eyes gazing into the amazing CGI and incredibly dazzling 3D graphics, I was very happy and excited.
When the main actor of this movie came on, I was a little put off by seeing some ""overacting"" that was more annoying than enticing. Throughout the movie, there are parts where I wished they would just cut out the story, and just get to the cool parts where the CGI and 3D blend to make an extraordinary visual explosion to the eyes and mind. The actor who played Hellboy is in this movie, who is another person I cannot Stand watching - Ron Perlman. There are the good guys, who have to battle these incredibly large monsters coming from another dimension. The great part about the monsters is, they don't cut anything out as far as the full presentation of the monsters body, size and overall look. It's all there which is too cool. Often in movies like Godzilla, King Kong, and even the recent Hobbit movie where there is no actual scene that shows Smaug the dragon in his entirety, this movie does not leave you wishing you could see more of what these monsters look like. They don't make you use your imagination to fill in the blanks. In 3D, these monsters are popping out at you and look nothing short of incredible. The monsters are taken on by the good guys that use somewhat matching size Mech machines as shown on the cover of this movie. The Mech Machines are also dazzling to watch, and look incredible while combating against these evil monsters.
Looking at this movie from all perspectives, there were many things that make this movie worth watching again and again. This movie is so beautiful and the 3D is so good, that it's tough to rival compared to any other 3D movie I have seen at home (vs. in the theater or via IMAX). The 3D effects and stunning visuals alone makes me happy I purchased this film. The story itself, is not bad either. Is it great? Absolutely not, but trust me, it could have been a lot worse. It's got a good premises and although far fetched, it's exciting and makes you think a bit, which is what tells me a movie is good (from a story standpoint). The acting? Well, that depends on one's definition of acting. Most of it was tough to watch and you want to laugh at some scenes because the acting is way overplayed and comes off as lame for the most part. Acting aside, the actual actors in this movie are so-so. Del Torro makes his appearance, which to me was a real downer since I can't stand watching this guy. The main characters otherwise are not going to win any awards for this movie, I can asure you. This is an action movie, and there is no doubt that this is truly action packed. Some reviews state that the movie drags on, but I didn't feel that. It wasn't too short, and it is by no means a long film like any of the lord of the rings movies. There is not enough story and detail with characters and overall environment to support anymore time than the actual film dispays. There could have been some scenes that were shortened to keep the action scenes a little tighter, but overall the length of the film is appropriate in my opinion.
This movie, by far, will not be for everyone. My wife didn't watch this, but I can guarantee she would have rolled her eyes at the end of this film and would say ""wow, that was really lame"". Other reviews on this site for this movie have pegged it down pretty well. If you like old style Japanese movies with Godzilla and King Kong where there is mass destruction with every swing the bad guys take, then this is for you. If you like action packed films with fairly poor acting (almost comparable to B films with poor acting but decent story - for example movies on the Sci-Fy channel) then you will probably enjoy this. The major different between budget films and this is solely based on the amount of work that's gone into the CGI and overall effects. They are truly, truly amazing. This film could have been so much more, but for what it's worth, its a good flick for the action junkies, the nerds, the manga and Japanese Monster lovers, and for anyone with an open mind that can tune out the negatives, and see the movie for what is really is - an action packed, visually stunning and phenomenal 3D flick that will not leave you disappointed. If I were to see this in the standard Blu-ray edition, I think I would rate this somewhere between 2 & 3 stars. But, I got the 3D version, and am very happy I did. For this version, I would rate this a high 3 or low 4. Many will like this, however, many will find it an absolute joke. The question is, where will/do you stand???? See it for yourself, going in with low expectations and you might just be surprised.",1382400000,4,5975,4.363554757630162
5390380,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim does right what so many hollywood action/adventure movies do wrong. It's fun, energetic, powerfully visual, and extremely entertaining, all the way through. It has some rough edges in terms of acting or it's use of temporal relations, in regards to the plot's timeline. None of it's small drawbacks play any significant role in the viewing experience, which, by all accounts, is one of more enjoyable cinema experiences of 2013.

Pacific Rim has a more detailed and intriguing plot than you might imagine from it's Godzilla/Mech Warrior roots. They take the audience to new places visually, while simultaneously offering some fun new science fiction goodies for lovers of the genre.

5390419,5,B00A6UHC0U,"This movie was like a combination of movie icons from Godzilla, Real Steel and Robot Jox brought into a slightly futuristic technology. The show is about an alien invasion that is coming through a rift in the Pacific Ocean.  The alien is cloning dinosaur sized monsters with the intent to take over and loot the planets resources. Humanity unites and builds giant human-controlled robots to counter the attack and try to save Earth. These robots are humanity's last stand. This sounds simplistic but if you enjoy these type of movies, the action is much more complex. The detail of the robots and the monster's are well done. The pace and action kept the show moving quickly.

My family did enjoy this show, it kept us glued to our seats from the very beginning. This doesn't happen too often, Usually when we watch movies at home there are moments that are slow and we get up and move around and do other things until it catches our attention again. Shows that entertain and absorb attention fully are a rarity anymore. For us, it was fun two hours.",1382313600,,1050,4.639784946236559

This is just one more of the countless Japanese Godzilla movies, complete with Japanese city destruction, Karate nonsense if you can believe this, and a plethora of unknown actors.  Of course, Amazon overpriced it by $2.00 from retail selling price so they won't let you sell this junk used to try and get some of your money back.  If they would, mine would be listed.  The special effects are good.  But, so what.  They are all good in modern science fiction movies.  The actors all act stupid considering the impact and emergency of the danger.  The story has a comical approach to pretty much the end of the world so you will never take any of the story line seriously.  This is one big super special effects waste of time.

5390422,4,B00A6UHC0U,"One of the reasons I loved this movie so much is because it tapped into some of my greatest childhood fears.  If you ever had those sweat induced nightmares of giant monsters chasing you relentlessly, you'll feel a reminiscent thrill of foreboding in multiple scenes that will conjure up your old nightmares.

Why this movie was not a bigger hit here in the States when it was released in theaters is a mystery to me.  But I can say that a lot of Americans who love action movies are going to kick themselves for not watching this outstanding Action/Adventure movie on the Big Screen when they see it for the first time on a humble TV.  This movie was made for the Big Screen!  The scale of giant robots and monsters were simply breathtaking on the Imax movie screen.  The 3D gives the movie a greater sense of perspective but it was not filmed to be an 'in your face' style 3D movie.  If you can shell out the few extra bucks for 3D, go ahead and do it.  If you're tight on funds, you're really not going to lose much in the way of visual experience without the 3D.

As far as the story-line goes, it is the perfect 'us versus them' popcorn thriller.  The movie is a 5-star movie but I simply cannot give the Blu-ray 5 stars because you lose a bit of the 'Awesome' experience when watching the movie on a TV versus Theater screen. There are only a handful of movies I would actually say that about.  Of course, if you were one of the many people who didn't go see this movie on the big screen, you won't really know what you missed out on, but for me, there was a definite difference in seeing it on the two different mediums.  I will say however that you do notice more of the details of the movie with the Blu-ray version than I did on the Imax big screen.  This is both good and bad depending on the quality of the CGI in any given scene.

The 3d cover of the Blu-ray is one of the better ones I've seen.  Anyone rummaging through your 3d movie collection will likely stop and stare at this cover.  My wife, who is not a fan of the big blockbuster action movie, was surprised that she actually liked this movie.  The character acting is done in more of an 'Anime' style that actually works.  Anime tends to be a bit over the top when it comes to its characters, but Guillermo del Toro did an excellent job of finding the right balance between live action and anime for the actors and they were fun and engaging to watch. If I had a criticism, I agree with other reviewers, I wish that the other Jaeger (Big Robot) pilots had been fleshed out a little more.

Del Toro's love for the anime genre comes across in so many ways with this movie and I personally applaud him for the incredible job that he did.  If you love the Big Budget action thriller, you can't go wrong with this movie.",1382313600,2,2788,4.244318181818182

5390424,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Giant monsters and Robots.  That says it all.  A portal, deep within the ocean floor, tears open allowing giant monsters (Kaiju) to rampage the earth.  In an effort to protect mankind, humans create giant robots (jeagers) inorder to combat the monsters.  When the Jeager program is threatned Stacker Pentacost (Idris Elba) does everything in his power to keep it alive.  Reilegh (Hunman) and Mako (Kikuchi) end up working together not just to eliminate the Kaiju problem, but also help one another with their traumatic pasts.

This movie is Del Toro's homage to the creators of the giant monster films.  He did not disappoint!  Sci fi fans, & fans of the big monster/robot flicks can appreciate this film.  The effects are incredible.  The big battles kept me at the edge of my seat.  This film (for the most part) moved at a steady pace. The story of the Kaiju creative.

My only complaint is not from the film, but the blu ray packaging.  Instead of the DVDs having their own compartments, the blu rays were stacked up on eachother.  In other words: 3 discs & only two comapartments.  That's not cool.  Especially dealing with Blu rays.  Don't know what they were thinking, but someone needs their @$$ kicked for that.

The acting was okay, the costumes good, and the special effects great. However, there was so much lacking in the story that I was appalled. It's hard for me to pin point exactly what I hated about the movie, but little was done to make the story believable.

Combine three movies that I thought were stupid: Godzilla, Ghost Busters, and Power Rangers and that is about the cheesiness you can expect from this movie. If you liked all three of the movies I just mentioned, then you'll probably like Pacific Rim.",1382313600,5,713,4.5625

This film with its premise of alien monsters from the deep devastating planet  Earth, and the inhabitants of Earth building huge robots to fight the denizens of the deep, was pure cinematic, popcorn-chomping, get-ready-to-be-blown-away fun!  Del Toro has always dreamed big.  His films bring me back to my childhood when I approached a movie just for its entertainment qualities and didn't spend time picking it apart.  Pacific Rim, although the subject matter of saving Earth is very serious, doesn't take itself too seriously.  There are very amusing scenes, especially with Ron Perlman whose character is over-the-top but I loved him.  Hint: Don't turn off the film until after the credits have run.  All of the actors were great in their roles, but I just have to say one thing about Idris Elba.  The man has so much talent and screen presence.  Del Toro was a genius for casting him.

Today I started watching the season finale of Project Runway.  About a half hour into it I remembered Pacific Rim and that I only had 7 hours left to watch that before the rental period expired.

Turned on Pacific Rim and found myself dozing off, took a nap, woke up and it was still rockem sockem robots vs whatever.  Remarked to self, ""Self, it's pretty sad when Project Runway is more exciting than the big studio action flick.""  Gave it ten more minutes and switched to Project Runway.

5390451,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim is a great popcorn flick and a blast at the movies.  Watching this film gave me feelings of nostalgia of sorts.  This movie was like a mecha anime and a Godzilla film meshed together, and it is awesome.  Since I am a fan of both anime and Godzilla I was really looking forward to this film, and it did not disappoint.  If you are looking for a complex and deep film this is not for you.  If you are looking for a great time at the movies definitely give this a look.  I like that this is something original rather than a sequel, remake, or an adaption of something like Hollywood likes to do these days.  I really hope that this film does well so that studios will be compelled to take more risks again.

The story is quite simple and strait forward.  A portal to another dimension appears and the bottom of the Pacific Ocean which is called the Bridge.  Giant monsters rise up through the portal and start wreaking havoc in our world.  In response we build giant robots called Jaegers to fight them.  The movie gives us a brief synopsis and drops us in the middle of the war so we can get right to the action, which I think is a good move.  The story is simple, but sometimes simple is the way to go.  This is one of those times.

The characters are fine.  You are not going to this film for complex characters, but the characters are enjoyable for the most part and get the job done.  The main character, Becket (Charlie Hunnam) is a bit bland but I liked him.  I like that he has been a pilot before and knows the ropes and is not a rookie.  Usually in these types of films the main character is a rookie that needs to learn the ropes and becomes strong at the end.  However, Becket is highly skilled, is a great pilot, and is not cocky or overly obnoxious, which I highly appreciate.

They did the rookie thing with the other main character, Mako (Rinko Kikuchi).  She is a rookie in that she has never piloted a real jaeger before.  However, she has been affiliated with the organization for a long time and learns how to pilot a jaeger very quickly.  She is also very skilled in regular combat as well.  Plus, like Becket, she is not overly cocky.  Usually the female characters like her are extremely cocky where it is annoying.  She kind of is at the beginning but not too much.  She also has an interesting backstory as well.  I ended up really liking her too.

Then there is Stacker Pentecost played by Idris Elba.  He is my favorite character in the movie.  First of all Idris Elba is an amazing actor.  In every movie I have seen him in he gives a great performance.  This is probably my favorite performance of his which is saying a lot.  He has a very commanding voice.  He also has a great presence to him.  The speech he gives at the end of the film is epic.

The side characters are hit or miss for me.  The two scientists in the film I did not care for.  I thought they were too over-the-top even for a film like this.  I like the appearance by Ron Perlman, though I wish that had more to do.  The Max Martinis character Herc I did not like at all.  He was a giant ass in the beginning and it was really irritating.  They tried to make him more likable later but it did not work for me.

The best aspect of the film by leaps and bounds is the action.  The action was phenomenal.  The effects were outstanding.  I cannot comment on the 3D aspect since I did not see it in 3D.  The action really sucks you in and gives your adrenaline pumping.  The action scenes are on par with the ones in Man of Steel in my opinion.

Overall, Pacific Rim is a great summer movie and should definitely be seen.  This film is not for everyone.  This film mostly aims at guys.  However, some girls will probably enjoy it too.  If you want a fun action movie definitely check it out.  I really hope that this film does well.",1382227200,2,3834,4.212413793103448

5390455,5,B00A6UHC0U,"As I am sure most people are aware of by now, Pacific Rim was Guillermo Del Toro's love letter to Japanese anime and specifically the mecha genre.  Certainly if you are a fan of that genre (such as myself) Pacific Rim is much more enjoyable than someone who is not.  However, that is like saying you like peanut butter and jelly but love them together on a sandwich.  Point I'm trying to make, this was a sheer enjoyable film, that was pure quick-paced fun, and even pointing out the technical problems is hardly enough to warrant anyone from not seeing this shining example of the summer blockbuster.

The movie chronicles a war humans wage with monsters they have dubbed kaiju, with the use of their human like giant robots dubbed Jaegers.  However, instead of focusing on the beginning of this conflict, most of the war is wrapped up very quickly before the opening credits, and from then on shows the last stand, after the Kaiju begin to win against the Jaegers.  That is all I feel comfortable giving away for the plot, since the movie does a good job pacing out its story with action.  The film might be a little over two hours, but it never feels like it.  In fact, you likely won't even realize it has been two hours till the end credits roll.

Speaking of the action, every fight scene in the film is amazingly well executed.  This is some of the best CGI I have seen in a long time, using its strengths of being able to shot and make the impossible, while acknowledge it's weaknesses.  This is why the fights are all at night with some form of water helping to cover up both the Kaiju and Jaegers.  What you can see of them however, shows the incredible detail that went into these creations, and even though all the fights are at night, they all feel unique.

I know there were a few critics in the professional circles that merely suggested this film was okay.  Being a loud action filled film with stereotypes.  I can't argue with them, butt he fact is, That was exactly the kind of film Del Toro wanted to make.  The characters were intently archetypes.  The inspiration was showcased with big loud fights.  This is one of the few films that knew exactly what it was, and went above and beyond that, succeeding to be entertaining throughout the entirety of its length, where other blockbusters will at best have one good scene, but are quickly forgotten.

Let me make it simple.  Everyone needs to see Pacific Rim.  It is far to enjoyable of a film to slip into cult status.  Do you enjoy entertainment? Do you like fun? Pacific Rim shows there are still film makers who do.  That care more about doing what they want than winning oscars and getting the big bucks.  If you like fun, you owe it to yourself to, at the very least, rent Pacific Rim.",1382227200,4,2760,4.463073852295409

I'm here to talk about the 3D release, which, unsurprisingly, met and surpassed my expectations. CGI tends to be a natural fit for 3D, and considering pretty much every set piece fight in the film (which, as I mentioned, is why you're watching this thing in the first place) is CGI. In between the fight scenes, the 3D doesn't add much - pretty standard ""blurred background with popped out actor"" shots driving the dialogue-based scenes, which is good, but doesn't add much. The fight scenes are another story. First, the shots of the command center and pre-fight ""suiting up"" are unexpectedly awesome - the futuristic instrument panels in the command center really add to the near-future high tech setting as they float in midair. There's been a lot of noise around the decision to set the big scenes at night in the rain, and again, the 3D is a natural fit here - the separation of the rain and environmental effects from the kaiju/jaegers and backdrop makes the scenes easier to follow visually. They also did a great job with 3D and sense of scale - rather than making it seem like you're watching a diorama, the 3D actually made the scenes more immersive, making my display seem bigger than it actually was.

This is 3D done right - I'd go so far as to say it could change some minds about home 3D. If you want to show off your setup, this is pretty much THE film to get.",1382140800,,1525,4.485611510791367

5390514,4,B00A6UHC0U,"This review is for the 3D version Pacific Rim.

The best thing about this (3D) movie is the graphics in my opinion, there's only one or two occasions throughout where you may notice some minor ghosting (depending on your TV you may not see any at all) but otherwise, the 3D image here is pristine. As far as the 3D graphics go, I put this one up there with Avatar and Tron Legacy which are my favorite 3D titles for 3D image quality and in my experience, the top 2 3D movies for the overall ""pull you in"" good time effect. Almost every scene exhibits an extremely clean and clear image with great black levels, punchy colors that burst off the screen and adequate brightness to be really engaging. You can easily see the texture of many of the clothes and uniforms of the characters as well as great delineation in many of the finer details within the image. The 3D effect is used very well to give a pretty good sense of depth to the movie as opposed to the more gimmicky, novel pop out of the screen type of stuff.

The sound of the 5.1 mix that I listened to was pretty damn good if not quite up to the supremely high standard set by the 3D video. When the robotic fists fly and land smack dab on the chins of ugly aliens crunch, thud, whack, slap, crack is heard in crystal clarity. There's some really good LFE too. The main reason I'm a little less enthusiastic about the sound than I am about the picture is because of the slight lack of envelopment from the soundtrack. It's loud, brutal and clear almost all of the time but it doesn't always surround you with sound. The rear channels aren't used as effectively as they probably could have been. It isn't a deal breaker by any means as this is still an exciting, banging and crashing good time.

The story is typical of movies of this genre and a few of the classic (cheesy) movie lines and scenes are there. The requisite Maverick/Iceman frienemies thing is there as well as the moment they gain a mutual respect and the adversarial posturing fades away. I was surprised that the acting wasn't terrible, sometimes movies like this which has mostly unknown actors (at least to me) and the story suffers because the actors can't sell the scenes. This movie was decently acted in spite of the mild cheesiness at times in the lines. All in all, not horrible but also not spectacular.

Defeating the aliens by posing as one of them to sneak by the defenses and plant a bomb in their midst, with a suicide attack by tragic supporting player. The co-heroes are quirky nerds and studs. It's ""Independence Day"" with the aliens coming from below.

Granted, some of these are overarching themes that you can find in invasion flicks dating back a half century or more. But, all of them matching up in the two movies?

The acting is weak but the script would be tough to breathe life into. The visuals are good and the musical score isn't bad. If you liked ""Independence day"" and were contemplating a second viewing, this might be an amusing variation.",1382054400,,826,4.851063829787234

I give the story line about the people a 4 out of 10.  However, the effects, combat, and length of action completely make up for the lack of human connection.  The acting was good, with a few exceptions.

In the end it doesn't matter.  The combat scenes with the robots and long and well thought out.  It has a sense of realism just because it doesn't get cut-off due to budget.  You want mega robot combat, you get it.

I find the fight sequences to be much clearer on bluray. It's not the most original story, but it works great to support the action. Also, if you know anyone who still watches DVDs instead of Blurays, this is the film to show them what their missing. What a beautiful picture it is. And the sound is incredible. If your a fan of director commentaries, this has one of the best I've ever listened to. Made me love the film even more. Highly recommended.",1382054400,,586,4.336363636363636

About the sound,

I'm glad this product comes with 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound for older home theater systems like mine, 5.1 analog. The sub woofer sounds incredible, but where it really shine (IMHO) is at the first Kaiju roars at the Golden Gate.

The blu-ray disc comes with extras and another disc that says ""Features"" but i have not seen it so i cannot comment on it.

I took me by surprise the 3D lenticular cover, i was a good extra.

Now the bad part,
I don't know if all the packages released was the same, but it comes with 3 disc at stated, the problem? mine one of the disc came  above another and sadly it was the blu-ray disc, lucky it was not scratched, but that arrangement is horrible.",1382054400,,849,4.341772151898734

They should've had an extra fold out spot for the extra disc, I've seen it done in most other multi disc offerings.

EDIT: Having watched this since, it's a great movie which I enjoyed tremendously, if rating just the movie then it's probably four and a half stars but Amazon only does full stars in which case I'd have to give it four. I would've given it five stars before but I just found myself unable to watch it through again a second time which knocks it down a little in my opinion. I enjoyed it a lot, Charlie Day's character is awesome, I mostly only got the movie because he was in it and I like him in It's Always Sunny. It's got great action and some cool sci-fi details but some of the personal interactions just kept me from getting through it a second time, I got tired of the love story part of it, it takes away from how good this movie is without that coming into play.

Hey, it's only my opinion, but what a let down, I think sometimes the ratings are over blown so you will rent them or foolishly buy them first. Thanks Hollywood, you did it again, with a lack luster bomb, that will probably make millions off of the toys they will make of the creatures, and people will buy them, like the sorry robots in this mess, it is all hype and commercialism, all bark and no bite, you could see something like this on Saturday morning cartoons.",1382054400,,784,4.451388888888889

A War begins that takes millions of lives that, literally taxes humanity's resources for years on end. To combat them, massive robots are made(called Jaegers) which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. When America is on the verge of defeat, it's up to two unlikely allies, piloting an obsolete Jaeger, to put a stop to it once & for all.

Folks, THIS is how a proper American Kaiju film should be made. Everything just feels natural in this film, like it's for real. Course, what impressed me the most was the designs for the Jaegers & the Kaiju. Excellent. If Director Gareth Edwards can do this with the new Godzilla film coming in 2014, it will be a resounding success-I guarantee it!. At any rate, despite its' two+ hour run-time(my only serious gripe), Pacific Rim is a blast to watch with tons of action and plenty of(for lack of a better way of saying it..)buttkicking.

Some plot points just don't really make sence or are not well explained (the mind melding thing, had to be related at first, but then not...  not explained well)  Knowing all this I was still amazed and pleased with this movie.  There were about three moments were my jaw hit the floor in nerdy enthusiasm for the cool effects presented on screen.  The battles were cool, special effects were the best I've ever seen (non noticable).  The ending did leave a little to be desired, though the second to last battle was excellent.

Great casting too, from Charlie Hunnam and Hellboy himself, Ron Perlman, to Charlie Day and Idris Elba. As far as the disc goes I only wish Del Toro had put more behind-the-scenes material on this 2D Blu-ray (and hadn't stacked the two Blu-ray discs on top of one another).

Review:
I am, by all means, obsessed with collectors, exclusives, specials, limiteds and steelbook editions.  If you're a huge fan of Guillermo Del Toro's ingenious mind than you will be astounded by Pacific Rim's sheer mechanical beauty and colorfully visceral joy ride.  Though I know you aren't reading this to know that but rather, to know if this edition was worth it.  I ordered the Limited Collectors edition purely on a geek high and sadly I am coming down from it.  The idea sounds amazing to have the behemoth Gypsy in your collection but this idea is comprised relatively of hollow plastic.  The 4 disc set (2 Blu Ray discs and 2 DVD discs) are stacked on a flap hinged to the back.  I have found no real issue with this disc placement to be damaging, just merely inconvenient.  Gypsy from the front looks full figured but from the back you will see that it's a hollow mold nicely designed with great depth at the proper angle.  Similar cases have been done with the Watchmen and Batman blu rays but I'd have to say this one looks better and more detailed than those.  Keep in mind, this package is not the same size as the standard blu-ray case if you leave it within the clearly printed package.  It extends almost an inch more in height, width and depth making in stand out in its clear casing from the rest of your collection.  For the die hard fan of films I am, I enjoy supporting the ones that deserve it and Pacific Rim blew away the original concept I thought it presented.  I paid $34.99+taxes and still feel that the 3D blu ray package is more appealing and will end up buying it once the price has become worthy of a double dip.  This edition absolutely does not merit a $64.99 MSRP by all means and hopefully will get an honestly accurate edition in a steelbook re-release...maybe four with each Jaeger (Sadly, I would probably by all four).  With Guillermo having already written the sequel, I hope for a trilogy to be established and a brilliant box set announced.  On a last note...Ultraviolet?! Why must the best be UV only.  I mean I have the blu-ray, so no qualms, I just want to add this to my already existing iTunes collection. I've grown exhausted attempting even to redeem a code for UV and can't help feel a tad incomplete leaving even one code floating in digital expiration space.",1381968000,2,2390,4.546728971962617

I liked it enough to see it twice in a row.  It has an imaginative plot and nonstop action.  I didn't even mind the somewhat silly subplot about two nerdy scientists.  It gave a break to the intensity of the fight scenes.  But I do wish that directors would stop filming in the dark.

5390548,2,B00A6UHC0U,"First off, I absolutely loved this movie.  Buy this movie! Just don't buy this version for the Gypsy Danger figure.

I initially pre-ordered the 3D edition of Pacific Rim when it was available.  When this version with the Gypsy Danger figure was offered I immediately had to own it.  Years back, I purchased a Toy Story 3 Bluray set that had a Buzz Lightyear figure.  The Buzz Lightyear figure in the Toy Story 3 set had articulated arms and legs, made lazer sounds and I think even could say ""To Infinity and Beyond.""

I know, stupid right, but like the package said, it was a figure. The actual Toy Story 3 disks were in a little plastic ""film can"" that attached to Buzz's back.  But it could be detached and you actually had a figure.

This Gypsy Danger set though.  not even close.  The Gypsy danger figure is not a figure.  Rather it is a solid plastic ""statuette"". Nothing moves.  Sure it would look nice sitting on a shelf as a conversation piece.  The disks are in a swing out spindle on a hinge.  I can see this hinge breaking after using it with normal wear and tear from flipping it in and out to get disks on and off the spindle.

I tried to find various info on this particular edition.  And it was listed as a figure on various sources.  Had I known it was a piece of molded plastic, I would have just gotten the regular 3D set in a bluray slipcase/box.

So to recap.  Pacific Rim awesome!!! Buy it!!  Help del Toro get funding to make a sequel.  Just buy a different edition than this one.",1381968000,4,1504,4.3

Pacific Rim has more depth (no pun intended) and is darker, edgier and certainly more suspenseful. The invading Kaiju are monstrous, Godzilla-like creatures that come through a portal within the Earth. Earth unites and creates enormous robots that take a two-man team to pilot. This works for a while, but the Kaiju are adapting and becoming stronger and smarter.

Pacific Rim is an action-packed, science fiction disaster film  with a looming global apocalypse. Yet it also has just the right amount of heart and humor to balance the suspense. This is a surprisingly fun and visually stunning film with amazing CGI. The Jaeger robots and Kaiju are just as much characters in the story as the actors roles.

5390565,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Best summer movie for a long, long time for me.  Watched this 3 times on the big screen and easily one of my all-time favorite shows. I'm 32 years old and this dates back to a time when mecha / monster culture was all the rage.  The years rolled back at elbow rocket speed.

For those that have watched the movie, get the DVD.  For those that have not, even more reason to buy it.  No excuses, nada, the apocalypse has been cancelled.

Do it.",1381968000,,442,4.141176470588236
5390566,5,B00A6UHC0U,If you do not like Traditional Godzilla movie's and Japanese Anime then you won't like this. That being the case you have no taste. This was by far the best movie of the summer. The story us excellent. The effects are so well done. You really believe the size and weight of the Jaega's. This movie is tremendous and it shows the world coming together. There is nothing better than giant robots fighting giant monsters.,1381968000,,418,4.586666666666667
5390567,5,B00A6UHC0U,"So I'm a guy and this movie has monsters and robots. This movie rocks.  End of review!

Story plot was pretty good, reminded me of a few Japanese anime put together into a movie.  Any Japanese anime turned into a movie is always graphical and fun to watch, and this is definitely no different.  When you are watching this movie, watch it with the attitude of this should be a fun ride rather than must analyze every little detail.  If you like analyzing every little detail, I would still recommend to watch this because you'll forget you are analyzing the movie.",1381968000,,563,4.534653465346534
5390568,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I'm going to start by calling this movie what it clearly is: an ""instant cult"" film. What it has going for it are a simple but compelling story line, excellent effects and reasonably good overall production values, and a family-friendly tone that offers a deeper themes of grief, teamwork and loyalty without slowing down the story.  I, for one, like this film very much, but I write this review in part to take other ""fans"" to task for the negative comments being attached to critical reviews.  A film like this is, inevitably, not going to appeal to everyone, and if it doesn't ""click"" with some people, they are entitled to say so.",1381881600,2,634,4.651785714285714
5390569,5,B00A6UHC0U,"If you are a big SciFi person, you'll find Pacific Rim enjoyable in what ever mode you watch.  I'm not big on SciFi but did give the review 5 stars just the same.  The movie kept me interested and while predictable for the most part the movie played out well.  One thing that really struck home was the flashing of the ""future year 2020""  As we sit back and realize that is barely 6 years away, the future is amoung us all.

All I can say is, let's all just hope and pray we don't have to meet an enemy such as the huge robotic monsters.

It is rated R for language, but would give consideration of a strong PG 13 and handle the few ""F"" bombs as they flow and don't take away from the overall film.

Above all, you'll find the special effects (and 3D if you watch that version) to be worth the time.

It is definitely in my 3D collection to watch again.",1381881600,4,853,4.065868263473054
5390570,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I wasn't sure whether to wait or plunge in. I totally loved Pacific Rim in the movies, and I knew I'd buy one of the dvd options. However, with Hellboy, which has become one of my top 50 movies - I estimate, not actually having written a list. I am not a young kid and there are many movies to rank, but it would come close to the top 25 list. His Blade II is my favorite of the Blade trilogy and I could watch Pan's Labyrinth once a month. But I digress. First, I got the VHS of Hellboy and it was great. Then I got the single dvd of Hellboy and I was happy. Next came the Two-Disc Special Edition. I adore making of features and commentaries, so I couldn't resist. Guillermo (like his alter ego, Peter Jackson) is so generous with his information and very entertaining, unlike some directors you just want to shake who sit and tell you the plot scene by scene. For Pete's sake - I've already seen the movie - tell me something I didn't know. Finally (I hope it is finally) we have, well, I have the three disc Director's Cut. If you enjoy knowing how a creative genius works, you should have it too. I'm just hoping I don't end up with a shelf of Pacific Rim sets now.

I glanced past several reviews with very extensive plot information. I'm very glad I didn't read them before I saw the movie. Do you really need 1,000 words of spoilers before you buy the movie? You won't get that from me. Earth is being invaded through some type of dimensional portal by huge monsters who are making an awful mess of cities along coasts around the world. Mankind has built a number of gigantic mechanical devices to fight them mano a mano - although some of the pilots are women. These behemoths are piloted by teams of two (or in one case three) pilots whose minds are blended in such a way that they can work almost as one person and yet independently also. Everything was going well for a while, but now the monsters are getting larger and the attacks are coming more frequently. The home team is suddenly losing both Jaegers, as the machines are called, and pilots.

In an early battle, our primary hero lost his brother, who was his copilot, and has become a construction worker moving from city to city as everyone builds huge walls in a pointless attempt to keep the Kaiju (giant monster in Japanese) out. They emerge every time from a specific area in the Pacific Ocean. The head of humanity's defenses, who is also a former pilot, tracks our hero down because they need anyone who can work ""in the drift"" as the mind link is called.

There are some oddball scientists and Ron Perlman (jeez, I love him) as a black market dealer in Kaiju body parts to provide some humor. The score is quite interesting and varied.

The movie is an homage to the monster and mechanized movies and TV shows of Japan beginning with Godzilla in 1954. Joseph Campbell would be so proud of Guillermo's use of the archetypes of legend in creating his characters. Del Toro will be glad to explain it to you. I'm not sure all the critics understood the many layers built into this movie. Too bad if they missed it. This is a terrific ride (and loud), but it has some serious lessons built into all the sound and fury. The monsters are real and we don't need to import them - they are right here already.",1381881600,,3276,4.348039215686274
5390571,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Really liked it, although I was skeptical at first. Worth a purchase as it's fun to watch multiple times. My only regret was that the monster fights are always in the dark , and in the water,and you really don't get a real good view of the beasties or the Jaegers. Still think it is the best ""giant monster"" movie yet made.",1381881600,2,323,4.225806451612903
5390572,5,B00A6UHC0U,"The movie surprised me so much in 2D I had to see it in IMAX 3D.  The mastering of this disc is almost as good as seeing it in IMAX.  OK, that's a strech but you get your own seat, can pause it, no line for food...  If you haven't seen it this movie is like a modern Godzilla vs Johnny Sokko.  Don't know who they are, Google it.  It takes classic Japanese movie and anime themes and gives them to you in a good story, very well made.  John Knoll from ILM was involved so you know you're getting something good.  The 3D is one of the best 3D discs I own.  The color and picture are better than when I saw it in IMAX and much better than 2D.  If you have 3D I hope you enjoy this as much I as do.  I watched of my digital copy on my iPhone and it looks good there too.  You also get SD and HD options from Flixter.  I suggest this movie for anyone loving fun, exiciting, sci-fi type movies.",1381881600,3,889,3.850828729281768
5390573,3,B00A6UHC0U,"I love sci-fi movies. This was a decent one with an interesting plot and some good actors. They pulled it off for the most part but the movie will not be labeled a classic by a long shot. Still, it is certainly worth watching.",1381881600,,226,4.159090909090909
5390574,2,B00A6UHC0U,"It's a sad time for Hollywood.  First ""John Carter of Mars"".  Next ""Battleship"".  Now ""Pacific Rim"".  It's too bad the folks that produce these kinds of films can't seem to hire both script writers AND special effects guys.  Maybe the next generation of directors can figure out how bring those two disciplines back together again.  But for now, if you can turn off the logic portions of your brain, tune out the noise that passes for dialog and just drink in the visuals, you might make it through this movie.  On second thought, going to the movies shouldn't be an endurance contest.  Do something more pleasurable like bathing your cat.  You'll be doing yourself a favor.",1381881600,,674,4.741379310344827
5390575,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I've always liked Godzilla. Big monsters destroying cities are amazing, even when the effects are cheesy or the plot is threadbare. So PACIFIC RIM was made for people like me. I can't--I won't--pretend to be objective; this movie had the right stuff. But it had more.
The characters were fully realized and had moments that just don't happen in big-monster movies: the hero who is NOT a loose cannon; the girl who's gung ho AND terrified; the commanding officer who has no soft spot, even for himself.
Guillermo del Toro created something special here. It's a great movie--so do yourself a favor and watch it. I'll be surprised if you don't watch it again and again.",1381881600,2,666,4.75
5390576,5,B00A6UHC0U,"This movie was incredible! Very emotional and also action packed! I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves kaiju type movies! Get it, because you'll enjoy it!",1381881600,2,177,5.137931034482759
5390577,4,B00A6UHC0U,"What are Special Effects? You should see Pacific Rim to Experience What They Mean.
Of course there were other movies with excellent special effects too but they were in the past. Pacific Rim is available right now. It was released on Bluray, a day ago, Oct. 15, 2013.

It's all about the special effects. This film will make your high definition, large screen TV worth the money.
The robots and the fighting scenes are life-like and exciting. The monsters' impression is mixed. Sometimes they look impressive. Sometimes they look like giant plastic, air-filled animals.

It's predictable. That's true.
There's no time for character developments. That's true.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this film:

Production Budget: $190 million
Domestic:  $101,794,729
+ Foreign:  $305,800,000
= Worldwide:  $407,594,729

So, it's a big flop in North America. It lost approximately 88 million dollars. However, worldwide, it took in 217 million dollars more than its production cost. That's a gigantic amount.

In short, it's interesting to watch.",1381881600,3,1077,5.363095238095238
5390578,2,B00A6UHC0U,"I watched his movie after reading how many people liked it and how ""awesome"" it was. Even terms like ""brilliant"", ""great"" and ""epic"" came up. I usually take these kinds of enthusiastic reviews with a grain of salt but my expectations had been high nonetheless. So I tried sitting through the whole screen time. But I just couldn't and left the theater after 30 minutes. A ""Transformers vs. Godzilla"" style flick really can't be taken serious lest considered to be entertaining. I was bored out of my mind and was constantly laughing because the movie is just so ridiculous. Maybe it's great fun for kids to watch but I'm definitely way past my teenager years to be able to enjoy dull, uninspired battles between huge, clumsy robots and huge, clumsy alien-dinosaurs. Even the CGI-effects couldn't make a difference. Pacific Rim has decent effects but it's just an over-hyped B-movie with a poor story and wooden acting. Monstrous aliens had been the main theme for cheap horror flicks in the 80's. I'm surprised someone's actually bothering enough to give them a comeback. It even looked as if the studio went back to putting people into foam + rubber suits to play the monsters - just like those old Godzilla movies.",1381881600,,1216,4.822966507177034
5390579,5,B00A6UHC0U,Now if your not into Science fiction and can't get past giant alien monsters don't bother.  But if you can this movies attention to detail is commendable.  The first 15 minutes is all setup and background.  Most movies do far less.  The writers go to great lengths to try to explain just about everything that's is going on in this movie.  The special effects are great and the action is almost nonstop.,1381881600,,403,4.541666666666667
5390580,5,B00A6UHC0U,I LOVE ALL SCI FI THIS IS A GOOD GODZILL WITH THE POWER RANGERS MOVIE WITH 3D AND GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS,1381881600,2,103,3.9523809523809526
5390581,5,B00A6UHC0U,This was a wild ride. This is the best attempt at a live action anime style movie and it pulls it off nicely. Far from perfect. But such a wild ride. You will have plenty of fun,1381881600,,177,3.810810810810811
5390582,5,B00A6UHC0U,"What a fun movie!  predictable, but giant robots fighting monsters, with a different twist.  Very enjoyable movie.  Would recommend to any sci fi fan.",1381881600,,150,5.166666666666667
5390583,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Initially I had mixed views about this movie, which was a simple case of over anaylizing things. I kept trying to figure out why more long range weaponry wasn't involved  and why the two mechs that did have them (Gypsy and Striker with the plasma cannon and chest mounted cannons) just ran up to the beasts instead of firing on them at a distance. Well I got to thinking of it more and the reason is simple: If the monsters were safely shot down froma  distance, it simply wouldn't have been much of a movie. There of course would have been problems with this as well, the plot of the movie has them resource drained. They've already spent so much on the Jageurs as it is and they've spent so much on the 'protective wall'..more expensive weaponry would have added additional expenses to their already draining resources. And there I go over anaylzing again..

The visuals-as always with Toro, are excellent with his typical ridiculous level of detail that you'll either have to watch multiple times to notice, or watch the special features. An example would be tiny bikes, tv's, etc being used as debris or the pistons moving under the Jageurs' armor plating.

I'm not sure what other movie some other reviewers were watching, but the CGI is actually well done and the dark/rainy scenes do not interfere at all. All of it is very clear to what's going on, even in the underwater fight. The monsters (and mechs) do not have that obvious fake look that some other cgi movies have, they seem to move with actual weight  and with a sense of force behind their attacks and the director and his crew were very careful to keep them reasonable realistic, porportioned and scaled consistently.  I did not find anything 'off' with any of the cgi.

The acting was decent-good. My only complaint about this is that 'Newton', one of the comic relief scientists, should have been toned down just a bit. The other one was much more believable though. Overall, all of the acting was decent enough to not be worth any complaints other then what I mentioned, so I'm not going to change the rating just for this very minor issue. Others have complained about some of the characters being cliche. I can see how that is, especially with the Russians..but really, it's not a problem considering that they get very little screen time. So again, no issue.

So while this movie genre is not typical of Toro's work, I'd say that it is up to his standards and worth atleast a rent. If you like Kaiju films and/or mechs-then it's worth a buy.",1381881600,,2515,4.598214285714286
5390584,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I'm a huge mech and monsters fan, so I was in love with this film from day one. Guillermo Del Toro is a cinematic god and being able to listen to his commentary, viewing his sketchbook and all the other added digital content is fabulous! The packaging however, leaves a lot to be desired. I had already ordered the less expensive combo pack, when Amazon sent me an email about the Exclusive Limited Edition Collector's version accompanied by an imagine that seemed to be of reasonably sized action figure. I was sold! So, when I called home the day it was delivered and was told I had received a ""book sized box from Amazon"", I was a bit confused. Wait, that thing looked like it was at least 10 inches tall and substantial? Maybe they'd mixed up my order... Nope just another Amazon-fueled gotcha on a Collector's Edition. (I'm probably a bit harsh, because I was also burned in the Marvel Cinematic Universe Ironman Briefcase armour packaging fiasco.)

The Good: BD content and other special features are worthwhile if you are a fan of the film.

The Bad:  The flimsy 'book size' Collector's Edition plastic case. Even the details/paint on this thing are sketchy (not in a good way). It's a hollow, light-weight construction and only about 7 inches high.

The Ugly: The already sketch case will only stand upright with your discs gathering dust stacked up on the ""kickstand"" spindle in the back. What's the point of a case that both stacks the product (hello, scratches) and leaves them exposed to dust...unless of course you just keep the whole contraption in it's box.

Haven't been this disappointed since the Non-Wearable Halo 3 Master Chief Helmet debacle of '07. #fangirlingishard",1381881600,5,1688,4.8068965517241375
5390585,5,B00A6UHC0U,"The movie is great, which is why it gets five stars. But the collector's edition isn't worth it. Instead of a statue, it's movie case with an open back. And the statue itself is smaller than a regular DVD case. Don't spend the extra (at the time) $15.",1381881600,3,251,4.25
5390586,2,B00A6UHC0U,"The entire film is a fine bit of SFX and acceptable acting (no award winning  performances though). If you want a good action film, thats all this is. There's one and only one twist in the plot concerning the Kaiju (monsters) but the ending is so predictable that it's anticlimactic. I didn't realize I was watching Independance Day until the end and then it all added up. Rent it. Don't buy it.",1381881600,,395,4.486111111111111
5390587,4,B00A6UHC0U,"First, the special effects in this movie are impeccable.  I had to convince myself I was watching CGI!  Incredible.  It was action upon action upon action that kept you glued for the entire 2 hours 11 minutes.  Wow.  It also started with an amazingly poignant social commentary.  The kaiju monsters were wonderfully done, the diversity and depth in creatures and characters and the plot was great.  The only things that brought it below 5 stars for me was the sometimes lack of using bladed weapons when fighting the monsters even though it was highly effective; the comic choppy fast pace it moves at times, and the sometimes stupid comments or plot turns like government decisions.  BUT, IT WAS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE I AM SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING BUYING BECAUSE IT'S WATCHABLE AGAIN AND AGAIN.  Just a tish below 5 stars!",1381881600,2,817,4.86231884057971

5390589,2,B00A6UHC0U,"The special effects for this movie are AMAZING, but as for the rest of the movie.  I kind of found it a bit lacking.  It kind of felt like the director had to pull back a little bit on the PG-13 rating.  I know it was originally planned to be R.  Charlie Hunnam is not the best in this movie.  And the rest of the characters all kind of feel like they are cheesy.  Wait for it on Starz instead of spending the money to rent it our buy it here.",1381881600,,443,3.8131868131868134

To that disappointment I still went for the Blu-Ray purchase and all I can say is that this movie is visually orgasmic. I won't spoil anything. All I have to say is at least watch it in high definition and you'll be amazed. The story was solid, action was on point, and overall it was a solid movie!

Apparently I'm not as smart as some people because I thought the explanation of how the monsters appeared was just fine. But then when I watch a film I'm not out to analyze it to death.

The film had a good story and explained everything as much as it needed to be explained.  The actors did their job, the special effects where great and the fight scenes were exciting to watch.  There was drama, suspense, a bit of humor, and even an emotional scene or two.
All in all, it's a fun two hours!",1381881600,3,745,4.225352112676056

Wrong! Not for this release... Very basic packaging, not even a slip-case. For some reason, the standard releases all received slip-cases -with the non-3D Blu-ray releases now getting the nice lenticular image!
Not only that, but where I purchased my copy, there was no sale price to top it off... I paid full price for just a basic keep-case release!
For those buying physical copies, especially only select few, this change-up is most disappointing -like they made a mistake this time around!

I don't accept the litany of apologia for its cliche-ridden plot lines, cardboard characters, and outright theft from myriad anime and manga series that have been formulated by others who insist that ""del Toro meant to do that"", or that ""critics of the film just don't understand"".  No.  It's bad.  It's not just bad, its horribly, predictably, stereotypically bad. What's most amazing is that del Toro managed to make a bloated, big budget film with massive explosions and mahem at every turn that is not only boring, but is also without a single original idea anywhere in it. (I know, I know: he 'meant' to do that.  Sure.)

My fervent hope: that del Toro never, ever, EVER gets to make his version of Lovecraft's ""At the Mountains of Madness"": he's not worthy to do so. Should there ever be any doubt about that, simply steel yourself (perhaps with a shot or two of Jaegermeister...pun intended) and sit through another viewing of ""Pacific Rim"".

Del Toro has made another piece of visual eye candy, wrapping it all up in intense action and homages to classic kaiju movies and mecha anime. If you're a fan any of these things, you'll have so much fun watching.

That said, the 'Special Edition' DVD that I got isn't exactly the best, and I feel I should have upgraded to the Blu-Ray and gotten my money's worth. The special features is bare-boned, and is notably missing promised deleted scenes and blooper reel. Not a very big deal, but to someone that wanted to see those it's annoying.

Charlie Day, Ron Perlman and Idris Elba all stand out in their roles, while the main 2 characters more or less fall into place. That doesn't distract from the movie because this isn't supposed to be oscar winning acting. The movie is everything I could ever hope it would be. Is it my favorite movie ever? No. But its still a fun thrill ride worth getting back in line for again and again. And on a plus note the 3D is very good for a converted 3D film. Prolly the best 3D film of the summer. I feel this movie will be more appreciated in years to come but for now use your own judgement and just let the fun wash over you.",1381795200,2,856,4.257668711656442

5390610,1,B00A6UHC0U,"***Please note that this is a review of the Collectors Edition of Pacific Rim***

Pacific Rim is a fantastic movie by Guillermo del Toro.  A fun ride from start to finish, it's a movie that will have you wondering why all summer blockbusters aren't half as engaging and well put together.

This Collectors Edition, however, leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.

Shown in the official product images, you would believe you are getting a Jaeger statue along with your movie.  What you are actually getting is a Jaeger shaped movie case.  Here in lies the problems:

1.  You get no actual movie case to place your movies in, just the ""statue"" shown in the images.
2.  #1 is a problem because the plastic Jaeger case has no back.  It is completely open.
3.  #2 is even more of a problem because the latch that holds the disc lid in place is half a millimeter high.  That is not a typo.  The slightest bump will swing the movies out.  In my case, this actually knocked the case off of my shelf hen I set it down the first time.
4.  The discs are all stacked on top of each other.

Normally I would say ""simply avoid this"", but if you are a fan of the movie, this is the only way to get the ""extra"" special features disc, which contains about 30 minutes of features.

This is a wonderful movie in a terrible package.  If possible, buy it in any other packaging possible.  I hope this keeps someone from making the same mistake I did.

5390618,3,B00A6UHC0U,"After deciding which movie to buy/rent I decided on ""Pacific Rim"".  All the reviews Ive read and watched about the movie said it was amazing. They all said it had so much feeling and action but I didn't really feel it.

I saw on the trailer of a great speech that the general gave and the trailer made it look like there was more to the speech, like everyone was getting riled up, but it was short and not as emotional as I thought. I was really looking forward to that part too.

All the reviews said how it was action packed on the edge of your seat; not so much, maybe on a 50 foot screen. I like to feel like I could be in the fight when I see one in a movie, but I couldn't imagine it with this movie much. The most I felt was when the two guys were fighting in the hallway, not when the 300 foot robot was fighting the 500 foot monster.

I read a review that I didn't get till the end. You always had swords in the robot and didn't use them? Instead you used a cargo ship as a staff (for only 20 seconds) to draw back on their earlier peer fight (more pointless than useful). Also at the end when they used the swords as if they were suppose to be that all mighty definitive weapon, but they always use their plasma cannons...

I did watch the whole movie in 2-3 sittings, maybe that took away from the movie a bit but it wasn't what I expected.

The Its always Sunny from Philly guy seems like the same character just as a scientist version. The main character seems like he could have been effected a bit more by his brothers death. We don't see how he really works through the death of his brother. The Japanese girls past took so long to reveal by the time it happened it was already assumed and half way confirmed. The extra credits mentioned how different nations contributed to piloting the robots, but they didn't go into their characters really. There is just enough given to get who the characters are, but not enough to actually get them all the way where they are suppose to be.

Overall I would rate it as a 3-3.5 star movie. It seems like it wanted to be a ""we need the best man for the job that is always the decommissioned, damaged, troubled pilot that is working through his own problems while trying to help others with theirs""  and I love those type of movie but they just missed. They seemed to focus on things that they didn't need to and not enough on the parts they did need to. I regret buying it for $15.",1381708800,2,2435,4.154989384288747

I almost barfed when i saw that plot line because it was so uninspired. Clearly Del Toro is not the autuer I thought he was and films like Pans Labrynth and Devil's Backbone were just lucky breaks.

- Terrible cinematography and CGI.

5390630,2,B00A6UHC0U,"It was hard to distinguish the totality of this film from the original Godzilla with Raymond Burr.  It resembled the traditional Japanese monster films from the 1950's with the exceptions that the international content was increased with a little variety in actors as well as the effects budget which provided for little more than the old time slow frame rate filming of miniature monster figures in miniature cities.  Great Saturday matinee fare for those up to the age of adolescence, but a lousy cartoonish film for adults.  There was an attempt to add meaning/interest through the interaction of several divergent character pairings , but that added so little, why bother?  This film was not much more than a cartoonish battle between giant man made robots and huge alien monsters that somehow just appeared from deep in the pacific ocean.  There was so little realism in the CGI that most had to be muted or obscured by a dark sets and backdrops that made the flash of lights more pronounced but hid virtually all detail.

Likewise, the cliches were well executed. Things were predictable, but they were predictably good and enjoyable. My advice is to just check your brain at the door and enjoy this movie.

Unfortunately, this movie doesn't translate well from the giant IMAX 3D screen down to a living room (2D) TV.  Even in HD on a 55-inch screen, the power and scale of both the jaegers (giant robots) and kaju (giant monsters) are missing.  This movie was made for giant 3D screens.  My recommendation is to buy the 3D blu ray and play it on the biggest 3D screen you can find.

As for the bonus features - there are 2 short documentaries.  The first lasted about 10 minutes and consisted mainly of Guillermo Del Toro discussing the various characters and why the actors fit the traits he was trying to find.  The second documentary is about 4 or 5 minutes long and contains much of the same footage as the first but with the director discussing the story and some filming techniques.  Both features have some interesting b-roll of an early table reading of the script and many between-take green screen moments.

5390645,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I did enjoy this movie, but it truly requires you to ignore things like gravity, and common sense. If you can get past those things then you'll enjoy it, too.

I have not purchased this blu-ray and have never seen this film on blu-ray. However, I did see the film in theaters and thought that it had its ups and downs. It's very similar to just about any anime that you've ever seen with mechs. Evangelion was the first to come to mind. I'm a fan of anime and have watched a number of series that are about mechs. They're entertaining and often stretch your imagination a bit. I walked into the theater with the knowledge that this (my interpretation) was likely an anime made into a movie with real people to appeal to a broader audience. I wasn't disappointed on this front. This movie is mechtastic. However, I feel like Del Toro missed something when he decided on how the mechs would battle (Semi Spoiler: there was a convenient scene that you'll wonder why something that would have been extremely useful during an entire battle wasn't used until the end). Things like this are what made me rate this a 3 star film. It's good, and I would happily watch it again, but IMO it's not worth $30 and it's not a great film that I'll be pondering for days, or going out of my way to rent/buy. I would consider paying $20 for it, but I wouldn't truly be interested until it dropped below that. Overall, it might be really cool in the home theater surround sound 3D experience, but these inconsistencies and convenient plot maneuvers make it feel more like anime lite. It's not the real thing, but it will do until something better comes along. I would certainly consider renting it from Redbox or Netflix if they had 3D films and will probably rent the 2D one anyways, but again, purchasing it for $30 seems bit steep. This is especially true when considering that I would probably only watch it a few times, and possibly use it to showcase my 3D and surround sound.. It's enjoyable and appeals to the younger more destructive kid in a lot of people, but it's not a movie that you want to look at too critically.

Update: 10/21/13
After reading multiple reviews of the 3D blu-ray on multiple websites I decided to go against my better judgement and see if this movie was really as good as people said on blu-ray. The fact that I heard that this movie makes great use of rear surrounds and I had just purchased a new set was the deciding factor. First off, I owe an apology to anybody that did not purchase this movie on my account. If you have an HD/3D TV and/or a 5.1 - 7.1 sound system that can hold its own, then this movie is worth the money. In other words, the plot is still a bit cookie cutter and doesn't do a lot to surprise you, but it is a movie that is aware of what it wants to be, and really shines if that's what you're looking for. The picture, sound, and 3D quality are top notch. If you want to test the LFE on your subwoofer and see how well your sound system holds up then not 5 minutes into this movie you might be getting calls from your neighbors about the sound. The 3D is amazing. Simply put, it's very difficult to believe that it wasn't filmed using 3D cameras. The underwater, snow, and rain scenes are amazing and the sound effects make it feel like you're really there with very minimal, and very forgivable ghosting every now and then. I would strongly recommend this movie to someone that has a 3D TV and a capable surround sound system, but would be reluctant to do so without both. The 2D picture is amazing and someone with an HD TV (sans surround sound) would probably enjoy it, but they would be missing out on a lot of what this film has to offer. If you are in this group, then I would suggest renting it to make up your mind. It's a good movie if you are looking for something that looks beautiful, sounds great, and provides a real good vs evil beat 'em up style to it. However, if you are hoping for more depth to the story than that.. Well, you best just keep searching. This is a good movie with great visuals and sound. I upped my rating one more star due to these factors. I know that many owners of 3D TVs will purchase a movie solely for the picture, so if you're in that bucket then do yourself a favor and press the buy now button. This movie is up there with Avatar so far as the 3D goes. Again, I apologize to any readers that disregarded this film after reading my initial review.

5390647,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Let's keep this review short and sweet...and hopefully helpful. To start, the story is nothing new (seen Top Gun anyone), the acting is mediocre at best, the ""plucky female"" introduced at 23mins is stale, and the movie flat out drags at some points.  That being said, stick with it! The action scenes of robots vs monsters are well worth putting up with the movie's flaws.  If that other giant robot movie franchise had been 1/10th this good (or had such CLEAR and VIEWABLE effects) maybe people wouldn't hate those films so much.  On that note, it is worth mentioning that you can actually follow the action when the fight scenes take place.  They are clear and you can always tell what is going on. There is not a single ""overly dark"" scene hiding the effects.  With that, the effects are not ""over-done"" or lame.  They are all completely believable within the context of the film.  You WILL believe what you are seeing.

To Repeat, the story is nothing new, but the fight scenes (you know, what you are actually watching this type of movie for) are spectacular!",1381449600,5,1064,4.652406417112299

The storyline is filled with awe and intrigue. All actors performed to (A-list) levels. The props, sets, wardrobes, makeup and all effects were amazing. This movie will have you on edge, leaving you wanting more. The fight sequences and combat action alone will captivate you. The premise of this movie is deep beneath the earth a race of Alien  monsters  have lived there since the age of the Dinosaurs, unable to come to the surface until the earths atmospheric conditions were just right. The Monster then would burst up through a hole in the ocean and begin their campaign to exterminate all human infestation and take over our planet.

5390656,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Ok, so I'm a big sci-fi lover, so a bit biased.

BUT, that's not to say that I'm no fair and balanced. In fact, watching movies is something I do every day, its the one thing that takes my mind away from work at the end of the day. So its not easy to impress me as I've probably watched more movies that many of you put together.

BUT, this movie was amazing. Special effects that were mind blowing, story that kept me hooked for the entire 2 hours and its the first movie ever, that I basically (daily) read the box office results to see if it made a ton of money or not, just to know in advance if a second movie was going to come out or not. Also, first movie in my life that I watched twice at the cinemas, nothing else moved me to do this.

Anyway, I could go on and on about how good this movie was, but really, the only thing I want is that Del Toro makes a second one. I so want to see a sequel or prequel or whatever as long as it has Jaegers!

Lastly, if anybody wants to see one of the classic Japanese cartoons that would have likely inspired Pacific Rim, check out ""Massinger Z"". As a youngster I used to watch that cartoon and it was excellent.",1381276800,4,1158,3.978448275862069

5390661,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I am not one for writing reviews, so a film has to effect me pretty strongly to do so. If you are GdT fan, there is nothing to dislike about this film. His stunning visuals, while not as fantastic as Pan's Labyrinth, are just as crisp and detailed in this film. Bonus, no subtitles. If there is one thing you can expect from GdT is stunning visuals and theatrics, even when simply presented.

There is not a Guillermo del Toro film I have not seen, and this is in line with all his other action oriented films, perfectly executed and entertaining. As a rule, I multi-task while watching movies, this one stopped all other activity so I could completely focus on what was on the screen.

Having read reviews that pointed out its implausible storyline, I'd like to point out... it's not meant to be plausible. It's meant to be entertaining. Apocalypse movies are only realistic if you are a doomsday prepper (and no disrespect if you are, but still)

This film is what would have happened if Cloverfield, Real Steel, Transformers & Battleship melted together and became a hybrid... a perfect melding of human/fighting-robot, aliens, kicking a** and taking names. There was also a great storyline, not developed as fully as if it were a dramatic film, but you could still feel the tension, camaraderie, personal connections, etc. between the characters. I know that I will be watching this one over and over again... it is just fun to watch.

The physics are SO broken, the acting is often over the top, the tropes are overdone, and there's no reason smart people should love this movie. That said, every nerd I know, including myself, love this movie... because it's about GIANT ROBOTS FIGHTING GIANT MONSTERS. Ridiculousness ensues. And GDT doesn't expect you to fall for it as possible, he just wants you to enjoy that level of ridiculous.

This movie features a ragtag crew of scrappy underdogs defending humanity against crazy interdimensional monsters, a plot to close the dimension breach using a lot of nukes, adorable-yet-deadly Japanese girl, firm-yet-caring father figures, bad boys strutting their mad skillz, a cute dog, government doing stupid things, and an altogether appropriate soundtrack-- seriously what is there not to love here? Have I mentioned the GIANT INTERDIMENSIONAL TENTACLE MONSTERS? Pacific Rim could have been made more realistic, sure, but why ruin a good thing?

In conclusion, GIANT. ACID-SPITTING. MONSTERS. Being hit in the face with cruise ships wielded by enormous mechs driven by two brain-linked pilots. Some other stuff happens. Repeat the fighting. Nothing has been this epic since Abe Lincoln had a horse thrown at him and then rode that horse away.

They were Pan's Labyrinth-esque in their hideousness. Genuinely scary. The wee little people piloting the robots were just interesting enough to hold the plot together. The beautiful but haunted Mako is alluring and vengeful at the same time. But who needs plot when you've got a whole cornucopia of progressively more gripping and majestic robot on monster battles? The only negative here is that I couldn't enjoy this movie with my little boys. They would have had nightmares for the next month.

5390665,4,B00A6UHC0U,"This was a must see movie for me; well before 2013 started, and it took quite awhile for me to see it. Now that I have watched Pacific Rim, here is my review.

Pacific Rim stars Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh, Charlie Day playing Dr. Newton Geiszler, Ron Perlman giving a likable performance as Hannibal Chau, Diego Klattenhoff as Raleigh's brother Yancy Rinko Kikuchi as Mako, and finally Idris Elba as Staker Pentecost. Idris Elba gave a notably fine performance in the movie. I do feel Rinko Kikuchi's character Mako felt...out of place at times,  but with a movie this good, it is not that big of a deal.

As I expected, some began comparing this to Transformers, Godzilla, etc. And yes, there are giant robots fighting giant monsters(creatures), but Pacific Rim stands on its own two feet as a movie. There are some cheesy moments( a few of which actually still made me laugh). But there is an alarming, sure sense of determination and focus that makes Pacific Rim one of those movies that is not only action packed, and butt kicking, it still packs a even harder punch in terms of leadership and trust.

I like a lot of things in Pacific Rim. Obviously, it is very easy to admire the visual effects. But with that, I love how Pacific Rim pays attention to detail. Its one of those movies you not only want to watch in 3D at a theater, you want the 3D experience of Pacific Rim in your home. Pacific Rim does contain some flaws, but it is a fun movie that reminds all of us why summer is one of the best times of the year for cinema. I rate Pacific Rim:

8.2/10",1381190400,3,1561,4.40625
5390666,5,B00A6UHC0U,"So, I might be a little bias here...I mean, I do love a good sci-fi, master story telling, amazing visual effects, GIANT robots, GIANT monsters, Guillermo Del Toro, ACTION PACKED, being submerged into a film to the point of feeling like I'm right smack in the middle of it and best of all be able to share it with the ENTIRE family. What's that ? You too like these things, then this is the movie for you my friend. If for some amazing reason you missed it at the movies, DO NOT go on living without seeing this film. GDT manages to turn a basic concept of robots vs. monsters into a roller coaster ride where you find yourself wanting more and more. The 3D effects are LEGENDARY, the story telling is so well paced you never notice where the time went. The robots and monsters are soooo well designed I find it hard for anyone to top them any time soon...The performances are over the top, BUT, you shouldn't have it any other way considering the subject matter. I feel it just adds to the entire premise. This is one of those films that at first you think, well, that was a little weird or a little cheese or whatever, but goddang it fits sooo perfect in the film and it all makes sense. (Warning, repeating some of the lines in any other context other than the movie might get you punched in the face). All in all, for me, this was a long awaited film, and when I finally saw it for the first time, I couldn't believe it was actually happening. The cinematography is simply put second to none. And some of those scenes are like, WTF !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Be prepared, after the first time you watch it, to feel like ""What the hell did I just see !!!! ?"" and wanting to watch it all over again....As with any other GDT film, plenty of scenes have a ton going on, so it's nice to be able to pause and rewind to take in the entire sequence...If you breathe, have kids, a wife, a girlfriend, boyfriend, grandparents that like movies I totally recommend this movie.

5390683,4,B00A6UHC0U,"That this movie had such a poor showing at the U.S. box office is a total shame.  I dare anyone to watch the first hour of say any of the Transformer or Fast-and-something-something-Furious films and then the first hour of this flick and tell me they really belong in the same ""summer blockbuster"" category.

That being said, this is a Guillermo del Toro film and with it comes his blending of drama, mysticism, mythical-demonism and tongue-in-cheek social commentary.  If you loved Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy/Hellboy 2, or Chronos AND you like the anime/Japanese-SciFi humanity vs. BIG monsters genre, then you're going to love this film... and chances are good, even if you don't, you'll get sucked into it anyway.

The acting is acceptable for the cast he had to work with... The leads give solid performances, the secondary roles are a bit caricatured at best, but that's also a del Toro signature.  My biggest gripe was that a number of secondary characters looks just like the male lead... to the point that I got confused a few times as to which was which.

The special effects are really quite amazing... all the detail and high-octane ballast of a typical Michael Bay Boo(b)m-fest, with none of the empty after taste.  del Toro's use of continuity shoots and live-set/green-screen blending could teach the folks at Skywalker Ranch a thing or two, as well.  He get's really great performances and dynamism in his action sequences by seamlessly blending real action with computer-animation in a way that makes the audience care about what's going on in the scene and not just blind/deafened by it.

Pros:
1) Structure - The film actually has 3 acts and each one establishes more back-story to the three main characters and the cloud of secondary and minor characters.
2) Character-driven - By the end of the film, I genuinely care about all of the characters and the challenges they face entering the final act, rare in a sci-fi action flick.
3) Hail to The Geeks - Instead of just making the geeky characters of the story comedic foils or even worse, conduits for deus ex machina, the geeks of this story play a critical part in both the development of the main plot and the enriching of the whole world the story establishes.
4) Length - This is a long film... it takes its time building up and then takes its time delivering the final show-down, but it delivers and delivers quite well.
5) Romance that doesn't suck - The one romantic thread in the film doesn't devolved into an obligatory sex scene or love-at-first-sight idiocy... it's based on a bond between two people that grows as the story develops and has a solid, mutual basis of existing between them (both characters having survived terrible experiences and still healing from them).
6) Creativity - The elements all seem very cliche at first... Big monsters, Big robots, FIGHT!  But the more the story expands the more del Toro's extreme attention to details and unique styling become a center piece to the film... He's oozing with creative genre-bending juice and this film is like an entire fruitbasket of it.

Cons:
1) Pace... This is a long movie and at times I felt like it was having to go out of its way to provide narrative exposition over weaving critical back-plot points into the story development.
2) Pace... There are times I was glad I was watching this with a rewind button.  This could be due to del Toro's Spanish-speaking background where rapid-fire dialog, full of sub-context and parallel conversations is a norm (not being racist/culturally insensitive here, just noting the nature of the language and how it's spoken).  While I enjoy this realistic banter, round-robin approach to dialog (think anything Joss Whedon has produced), it can make it hard to keep track of characters and sub-plot.

The effects are incredible.  The monsters and robots I can watch over and over for days.  Very cool.  The combat is reasonably exciting.  The Kaiju body parts and parasites harvested are very cool and gross.  So you should love this movie's effects.

The acting was excellent.  Criticizing the actors is wrong, because they had literally nothing titillating to work with at times.  Much of the dialogue was absolute drivel.  Many of the ""bonding"" scenes between characters were a waste of our time--firstly because nobody cares about these people because we have not had any reason or time to bond with them; secondly, because they are so FORCED it is nauseating.

This movie drops the ball on story and dialogue BIG TIME.  This is what deserves your hate.  Not the idea, which is very cool.  Not the acting.  Not the effects, which are perfect and amazing.  The lines are mind-numbing.  The scenes that are trying to FORCE US to care about relationships are tedious.  They wasted so many minutes on human interactions we do not care about!

Either make the film longer and develop the characters--INCLUDING THE MYSTERIOUS ALIENS SENDING THESE MONSTERS!--Or just cut the crap and give us more monster mayhem and titanic battles.

I liked seeing the mysterious beings from beyond, but not knowing anything significant about them is annoying.  That is another personal annoyance, by the way.  This is a sci-fi story.  Develop the aliens, please.

If you are a mecha fan, you know what I'm talking about: how can you not like a movie with a giant mecha fitted with a rocket punch and GM drive that the pilots have to 'pilder-ON' to ride it?  And that take-off lift.  AND THAT SYNCRO RATE THING.  I thought I was having a heart attack first 10 minutes into the movie...

As far as I know, this is the first hollywood movie that features a robot that requires pilots - a monumental moment in the history of mecha fandom. Same time, not making a same mistake of focusing on human instead of robot alone makes this movie superior to Tranformer movie series.

Some may lament that the narrative is a bit weak.  Well, it is pity that they couldn't fit all the story explained in the novelized version, but I think the movie still flows considerably well enough.  Besides, WHAT ARE YOU DOING LOOKING AT HUMAN, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT ROBOTS!

I watched this movie two times with and without 3D and I can you tell you - you HAVE to watch this in 3D, at least once!  You can only truly appreciate this movie in such way because subtle details like debries flying and water vapors are most visible that way.

Fan sentiment aside, this is a very enterntaining movie.  I think the only thing this movie is missing is a pile bunker, but that's just me.

P.S  There is a little girl crying in middle of a japnese city and Gamera doesn't show up?  What!?

For fans of classic Japanese mecha you'll love the throwback hints to classic Toho creatures and shows like Ultraman or Mazinger. Why the comparison to Shawshank Redemption?

5390729,1,B00A6UHC0U,",,, but it's just a really, really terrible film.  The underlying idea at the root of the movie is totally cool, ie  there's a interworld breach at the bottom of the Pacific Ocewan that gigantic monsters called Kaiju are coming through to attack cities along the Pacific Rim and mankind has responded by building gigantic fighting machines called Jaegers to destroy them.  How cool is that?  And some of the visual effects and imaging are really cool as well.  But throw all that out the window with a hopelessly predictable plot and some really terrible, god-awful acting and you end up with just a stinker of a movie.

I loved Charlie Hunnam in Sons of Anarchy, he perfectly plays the too wise for his years, brash, in your face, motorcycle gang punk, Jax Teller.  But he's EXACTLY the same in this movie, and this role doesn't call for it.  Sorry Charile, you've demonstrated that as an actor, you are as one-dimensional as a pin prick.  And speaking of one dimensional actors, Ron Perlman is another one.  He was fine in SOA, but when he showed up as the Kaiju organ collecting black marketeer in Pacific Rim, I laughed out loud at the absurdity of that casting decision.  Bad enough you got Jax Teller narrating most of the movie, now you got Clay Morrow too.  And then there's Maku, the love interest - another one-dimensional waste of film.  Add in two just too whacky scientists - for comic relief, apparently - in the research department and the mysterious Marshall played by some clown who apparently made up a heretofore unknown accent - in which he shouts out such corny, memorable lines like, ""Don't you know the world's coming to an end?  Would you rather die here or in a Jaeger?!"" - and you've got just a screeching, smoking train wreck of a movie.

Which is just a shame.  It's s stunning film visually and there is a kernel of a really cool idea there.  You can pretty up a pile of crap all you want, though, but in the end, it's still a pile of crap.

Yes, piloting the bots would no doubt be an awesome experience, but in the end you're a pilot with a job to do, so why would anyone think to put people in the pilot's seat who are headstrong and insubordinate as all of these pilots seemed to be.

 The special affects were what got this movie to a 3 star rating. Without the sweet visuals I probably wouldn't have even finished this movie.

Every scene has subtle reminders of relative size that constantly reference the scale of the robots and monsters involved- until the impossible becomes so ingrained that when the finale rolls, a complete suspension of disbelief has taken place. The plot is a skeletal framework supporting an absolute feast of eye candy which may well set fire to a fading genre founded by stop-frame animation, elaborate scale models and actors in rubber suits. Pacific Rim never forgets the fact that monster movies are supposed to be entertainment; this movie neatly avoids all the pitfalls which destroyed the latest effort to reprise King Kong- the overweening complexity, the misguided effort to explore the gaping flaws in human ethics, and so on, and so forth. It's an endlessly engaging brawl with a few dashes of heroic angst and a dripping scoop of silliness that never stops.

Yes, the movie can be downloaded to your computer, and moved to an tablet or phone, however, it has to have the Flixster app to watch your digital copy.

This also requires a UltraViolet account, a Warner Brothers account, and a Flixster account.  If you are like me and prefer digital copies, then AVOID this product and grab it on iTunes.

5390783,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim is the best movie by far from the 2013 summer crop, is a no brainer pure fun slug-fest of monsters and giant robots that makes you want to be a kid again and believe in the simplicity of the fight between good and evil. It makes you believe in all the things we could do if we stick together as humans. This is a movie i was dreaming with for almost my entire life, since those magic Friday afternoons watching Mazinger Z in local channel for in Puerto Rico. Guillermo del Toro made a lot of people very happy, i know many to the point of tears. He transformed our childhood memories into heavy metal reality, and all of us who love sci-fi, anime, and fantasy are forever in debt to him and all the crew who made this film possible. Is the movie perfect? Well, no. To me there is only one perfect film, is call The Empire Strikes Back, perhaps you have heard of it. But the movie perfectly blends the mecha and monster genre from Japan. Part Mazinger Z(actually a lot), part Evangelion and part Gundam, add a little of Godzilla, some Gamera, add some drops of King Kong, and even a hint of Independence Day and you get Pacific Rim. Is a beautifully made film, the production values could not be higher, everything look and feels real, from the light, reflections, transparencies to the actually volume and weight of both monsters and machines. Is a dream. so I believe you should watch it, without preconceptions and take it for what it is, a high tech fantasy for that part of us that can still dream and be wondered. I went with my wife and son who is now four. We enjoy  every minute of it. In that scene when Gipsy Danger(the main robot) turns on that turbine in its elbow and punched that monster we all screamed -Puno Atomico!!!(atomic punch)from our Mazinger days. My kid asked me with a smile that i will never forget- Daddy is that Mazinger? I said- No baby, but is a very close friend. Thanks Mr. Del Toro and team, thanks from the bottom of my heart.",1379980800,6,1973,4.361413043478261

5390790,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I'm not going to try to write a better or more detailed review than others that you will see here. I think they've said it better than I can or will.
First of all, let's keep this in perspective: I'm a mature woman (over 50), business professional and a martial artist - and I'm going back for an eleventh viewing tomorrow. (Ever watch a movie for the umpteenth time, knowing that once you get through the 'boring' part, you'll get back to the good stuff? Pacific Rim doesn't have a boring part you have to 'get through'; it contains only 'good stuff.')
What I can say is that this movie is beyond fantastic. It's brilliant. It's uplifting. It shows people at their best, rather than at their worst; it shows humanity at its best as well.
Is it flawless? No - but the flaws are minor and don't take anything away from the movie as a whole.
What truly makes this movie isn't the acting, the Jaegers, the kaiju or any other single aspect, but rather the absolute love of Guillermo del Toro for the genre; it shows in every detail. Watch for scenes like the flawless transition from Mako's transition from inside Gipsy Danger to entering her memory; the entire 'little Mako' scenario - it's terrifying!; the details like the rain bouncing off Gipsy Danger when she punches her fist after leaving the base in Alaska on the first mission of the film; Tendo's 'tap out' after the final battle; watch the incredible body mechanics that are captured in the motion of Striker Eureka's run in Hong Kong Bay (and in the fight in Sydney - and this is a scene that takes only a few seconds!), the motion of Gipsy as she recaptures her balance after being thrown onto the dock, Gipsy as she carries the oil tanker, and again, her body mechanics as she accelerates to run after the kaiju in Hong Kong. In most CGI, the 'weight' of the body is lost in the motion; here, it's captured beautifully - and for these little scenes alone, the movie is unparalleled. Add to this the great music (listen to the changes as the scenes in Hong Kong Bay shift from Crimson Typhoon to Cherno Alpha), the absolute refusal of Travis Beacham to yield to the typical cliches you expect in these movies, and you end up with a movie that is, as far as I am concerned, possibly the best movie ever.
Really.
No hyperbole.
Best.

Pacific Rim look like it was so much fun to make for all of those who made this movie. This movie comes along and just blows me away by the special effects, pilots' suits, the details, the monsters, just freaking awesome!  I had to see this movie 6 times, yes 6 times.

The Characters and acting: Likable and charismatic. Rink Kikuchi and Idris Elba steal the show but Charlie Day and Gorman Burn deserve a special mention too. They are incredible and funny.

The Effects: Perfect. Both monsters and machines are as real as possible. Amazing in 2D and even better in 3D.

The Soundtrack: Epic. Even if you didn't see the movie, its music will sound impressive.

You want plot? I'll give you plot: Giant robots. With buzz saws, swords, guns, and fists. Fighting giant monsters. With acid, horns, claws, and wings.

And that is all the plot you need. Let the most fun, action-packed, thrilling, awesome, escapist action/science fiction blockbuster event of the year begin! Pacific Rim is a film that appeals to the 12-year-olds in all of us. The action takes place on a gigantic scale, huge, operatic, devastating, lots of bashing and punching, but here's the thing: it was refreshing to see a climactic fight scene that did NOT take place in a major city, in which huge skyscrapers are destroyed, with people running from men in spandex. There was a lot of city destruction, but compared to Man of Steel or Star Trek Into Darkness or The Avengers, Pacific Rim was refreshingly ""light and airy.""

Those were director Guillermo del Toro's words on the tone he was hoping to strike for the film, as opposed to the usual ""super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie."" Although the majority of the film takes place in the dark and the rain, I believe he succeeded.

But let me tell you this: I have never been more involved in a movie than when I watched Pacific Rim in the cinema. I was cheering during the fight scenes and literally gripping the sides of my chair in some parts. The characters were real and sympathetic, and even the Jaegers become relatable characters. This is in no small part to the acting, which was all round excellent and, at times, surprisingly subtle.

Raleigh Becket is played with charisma&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Hunnam/dp/B0099JL0CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Hunnam</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rinko-Kikuchi/dp/B000NMW6M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rinko Kikuchi</a>&nbsp;turns in a surprisingly excellent performance as Mako Mori, Raleigh's drifting partner.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Idris-Elba/dp/B006GLQ092/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Idris Elba</a>&nbsp;is never bad, and although his character tends to be a bit dour, he is also really cool and brings a real presence to the film (And who can forget his line, ""Today...we are cancelling the APOCALYPSE!"" Oh yeah, By punching it in the face!). Charlie Day brings the levity and the comic relief, and both are entertaining as the as eccentric scientist Newton Gieszler. Del Toro's good luck charm is here too; the ever reliable Ron Perlman, who chews the scenery with his usual wacky gusto. Max Martini gives a surprisingly awesome role as Hercules Hanson, one of the veteran Jaeger pilots in the Pan Pacific Defense Corps.

The human characters have realistic drama and conflict, and their actions and emotions are real to the audience...blah blah BLAH. Of course; we all know that. Del Toro is a veteran director, adept at world-building, immersive atmosphere, memorable characters, sincere emotion, and utter terror. But that's not what you came for, is it? We came for giant robots versus giant monsters. And on that front...Pacific Rim delivers!

The action, is, in a word, completely AWESOME.  I say that in the literal sense. The Hong Kong fight will blow your friggin' mind. I was literally cheering at the screen. When you read it from a secondhand perspective, it may sound clichd or even juvenile, but that moment where Crimson Typhoon (China) comes out with its 4 buzz saws, and Cherno Alpha (Russia) starts punching kaiju face...it's enough to make you feel 12 years-old again. It's the most incredibly thrilling and viscerally awesome scene in a movie I have seen in a long, long time. And I see a lot of movies. I could have given Pacific Rim 5 stars for that scene alone.

But let's talk cons. This is definitely a more of a guy's movie. Nearly every female in the audience I watched it with described it as ""Crazy"", or halfheartedly called it ""Good..."" or, ""Not my type of movie"". There are a quite a few plot holes, and I feel that the climax was not handled as well as it should have (could have). There was a curious lack of emotion, and let me just say that it was slightly underwhelming for me.

But that is not to detract from this otherwise excellent film. Technically, Guillermo strikes home. The CGI is amazing, and the use of 3D adds rather than detracts from the film. The score by Ramin Djawadi is stirring and catchy and completely awesome; becoming my new  FAVOURITE 2013 SCORE, taking 1st prize over Hans Zimmer's more operatic  Man of Steel score. The editing is very good; no shaky cam here. The camera work is filled with Del Toro's typically beautiful, stylistic flourishes and striking imagery.  The production design feels lived in, worn in, and is realistic without taking all the fun out of the entertaining sci-fi world Pacific Rim takes place in.

...

I'm running out of things to say here. Just go watch Pacific Rim, preferably at the biggest screen possible, in 3D (excellent use of it, I must say), and with the volume blaring. It's that rare thing in Hollywood nowadays: the completely original blockbuster. And as such, we must hail Guillermo del Toro as one of the great cinematic visions of our time. This is a subject of passion to him, and he directs with passion and with fervour. And the audiences, well, they're just swept along for the ride of a lifetime!

Just go watch Pacific Rim! My rating? Level five kaiju out of five.

P.S. Guillermo del Toro, we NEED a sequel!",1378771200,70,5743,5.308370044052864
5390809,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I love all kinds of movies for any number of reasons. I can overlook flaws and suspend disbelief in most case. However, I personally have always had issues with robots (let alone gigantic ones) that are hyper-human in their actions and responses. No motors, servos, gears, supercomputers, gyros, or stabilizers will EVER match the human machine. Reach over to the person next to you and give him or her a little push. Notice how their equilibrium kicks in and nearly the whole body in nerves and muscles reacts in micro seconds to balance itself. Any robot would tip over before it could react. *sigh*  Yeah, I know. A silly hang up. C-3PO i can handle. Real Steel I won't even watch. Anyway, this was almost a deal l breaker for me and I almost passed on Pacific Rim, but I love creature movies too much to skip it. The Kaiju monster were awesome. The story was bloated with cliches, and consistency and continuity were absent most times. Some of the characters were almost interesting. As always the asian chick was hot. Other racial stereotypes were present, but not offensive - just more cliche content. Overall the movie looked great and at the end I found myself entertained and satisfied.  I definitely recommend it. Despite my aversion to robot movies I know I will buy this movie and watch it many times in the future,",1378598400,4,1327,4.666666666666667
5390810,5,B00A6UHC0U,"""Pacific Rim"" was one of my favorite movies this summer. It delivers on everything that a summer movie should - most importantly, it's a lot of fun and has a big heart. Guillermo del Toro is one of Hollywood's best working directors (particularly in genre filmmaking) - his experience doing creature features and his talents for visual design was exactly what this film needed.

Obviously, one of the most appealing factors of this movie is the spectacle. This movie handled scale very well. One of my favorite shots comes from the first sequence, when a destroyed Jaeger falls in the snow right next to a person on the ground - seeing this massive 250-ft. machine next to a human was amazing. And it all looks photo-real; the visual effects and compositing work on display is top-notch.

In terms of the 3D: it was post-converted rather than shot in the stereo format, but the process was given several months to be completed. ""Pacific Rim"" is an example of 3D post-conversion that was given the time and money to succeed, and as a result the consensus seems to be that it looks very good.

Also, a movie with monsters and machines is going to require unique sound design. The soundscape is every bit as massive as the visuals. The musical score by Ramin Djawadi is one of the year's best and adds a sense of fun and adventure to the film (I highly recommend the soundtrack album).

5390812,4,B00A6UHC0U,"For director Guillermo del Toro, who grew up with Japanese pop culture, they are not just monsters and robots. They are ""kaiju"" (literally meaning ""strange beasts"") and ""mecha"" or giant piloted walking machine. You may expect from something subversive from the director of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""The Devil's Backbone,"" but his latest effort ""Pacific Rim"" is surprisingly straightforward in telling the heroic story of kaiju-fighting robots.

To me the best part of ""Pacific Rim"" is the pre-title sequence where we get to see the world of near future. Because of an inter-dimensional breach deep in the Pacific Ocean, kaiju attack coastal cities, with the first monster wrecking havoc in San Francisco in 2013. To combat these monsters, humans create their own ""monsters"": massive warrior robots called ""jaeger.""

The real stars are these giant robots and monsters, and their designs. Each jaeger is given a name (like Gipsy Danger, Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha) and a back story that is more interesting that of the pilot. The way these huge robots move, operated from inside, is one of the most visually impressive parts of the film. Compared with them, all human characters are pretty flat except scene-stealing Ron Perlman's ""Hannibal Chau,"" though stars including Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba and Rinko Kikuchi are doing their best.

With thrilling action sequences that does not rely on dark lighting and shaky camerawork, ""Pacific Rim"" delivers what it sets out to do: exciting battles of monsters and mechanical monsters.",1378425600,2,1530,5.262295081967213

Personally i thought it was great and so do billions of other people...with a small fraction who happen to think it was crappy and a waste of time and money.

5390842,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I have been waiting for this movie my entire life. Maybe you have too. Ever since I was a wide-eyed kid watching Star Wars on a color TV in glorious Dolby Stereo, I've been dreaming about monsters and technological wonders. I've been watching summer blockbusters for so long I must have eaten enough popcorn to fill the Grand Canyon. So naturally if you're one of those people who absolutely hate summer blockbusters, giant robots, Kaiju, good acting, smart writing, lovable characters, spectacular visuals, and having fun...well this movie and certainly this review ain't gonna change your mind. If on the other hand, you, like me, played with LEGOs as a child and pretended you were building spaceships, if you walked through your LEGO town pretending you were Godzilla, if you laughed and cried and cheered from sheer overwhelming awesome watching Gundam and Macross and every other giant robot show you could get your salty-snack and soda-stained fingers on...then your moment has finally arrived. And it is GLORIOUS!!!!

Independence Day, Jurassic Park, Men in Black, Star Wars, Indiana Jones. You know this type of movie. It's about lovable characters going on amazing adventures and larger-than-life heroes saving the day before bedtime. This film is everything you would expect, and much, much, MUCH more. Just make sure you open your eyes, and your mind's eyes as well. Because while this film resembles your typical blockbuster, it is ANYTHING but typical.

A visual masterpiece

Within weeks of the release of this film there were people announcing they were starting conventions for it on the Internet. There were also long articles written about the film's visual genius. What the heck are they talking about? It's a movie for kids about giant robots and monsters! Or is it? Look. No, closer. CLOSER. Notice how you learn about characters by not just what they say (and don't say) but by their body stance and facial expression? Notice the enormous amount of personality you get from characters who barely have any lines of dialog at all? How about how someone's HAIR COLOR ties in with a visual cue from their back-story told in memory flashback? No? Doesn't work for you? Okay, maybe you noticed the EXTRAORDINARY amount of detail in the backgrounds? No, I'm not talking about random junk flying around in the background like in Star Wars Episode 1, stuff that has NOTHING to do with the story. No, no NO! I'm talking about the insignia on people's uniforms, the billboards and signs in the backgrounds. The stuff that makes this movie have STYLE and feel like a living breathing world of giant robot/giant monster awesome. What's that you say? You only care about the obvious? You detest analyzing anything no matter how awesome the treasures hidden? Fine then. There's always...

Explosive Action!

Okay, you saw this coming in the trailer. Giant Robots smashing and bashing and slicing and dicing through giant monsters! The CGI in this film is very, VERY good. Everything just feels...REAL. Everything has weight, mass, inertia. Nothing looks silly or cartoonish. And all of the amazing effects are BEAUTIFULLY framed and photographed. Seriously, incredible cinematography is on showcase for this film. The kind of stuff you could frame and hang up on your wall or buy a new Plasma TV and a Blu Ray player for. Wait...you say you're tired of stuff that makes you think AND you want a good story? You're a tough customer but you're still in for it because...

""For my family!""

That's right, even if you are too stupid to notice things in the background and too grown up to want to see nothing but mind-blowing-awesomeness for a few hours, this movie STILL deserves all your love, because it has AMAZING story and character development for a film of this type. As opposed to summer blockbusters that have shallow, stereotypical characterizations (Fighter Pilot, Punk, Asian Chick, Nerdy Scientist) that you could never believe in a million years (there's something about supermodels playing Russian physicists that stretches the bounds of all reason), these characters manage to be ARCHETYPES that still have great emotional depth. Good-natured Raleigh, who takes insults with a smile but will knock you out if you use foul language to describe a lady. Newt, the Kaiju fanboy-turned-scientist in love with the object of his study.  Stacker Pentecost (admit it, you love that name), the commander keeping a cool head and an open heart as he fights to save the world. And Mako....oh man, Mako! Mako manages to be...perfect. She's a woman, fighting to overcome childhood emotional turmoil. She's a realist, not afraid to tell the truth like it is. She's a fighter, not afraid to go toe-to-toe with anyone. She's a shy girl, who gets embarrassed when she's awkward, smiles like a schoolgirl when she's happy, and when she fails, gets right to the edge of tears and still holds it in. The actress who plays Mako....is AMAZING. Yeah, yeah, you say. That's all great. But does it have a rock'n soundtrack I could download to my iPod and run a mile to or blast in the morning to get me out of bed? Got you now, haven't I Mr. Reviewer!?!?

Like a rocket powered punch

Anyone seen Iron Man? Yeah, so have I. The same composer created the soundtrack to this movie, and honestly, it just might be his best work. The main theme of the picture is downright inspiring. And gets the blood pumping . It's a rock-infused symphonic delight that suits the picture perfectly, with nary a boring track in sight. It's got it's slower, more dramatic moments to be sure, but this is a popcorn flick, not an Oscar-bait film so most of soundtrack is meant to get into the awesome action and story onscreen. Which it does very well. Just got ahead and buy it already! Ok, ok, you can listen to it on YouTube first if you're such a doubter. Moving right along...

Not a War Movie But an Adventure Movie

This was a movie made by people who love monsters and giant robots FOR people who love monsters and giant robots. The director himself said so. Yes, there's plenty of drama to go around. From a father's concern for his son and partner to a commander having to let go of his adopted daughter. There's tragedy and loss, but that's not what this movie is about. This film is OVERWHELMINGLY about the spirit of idealism that is sadly lacking in the world today. It's not about a country saving the world. It's about the world saving the world (again, the director's words, not mine). It's about people coming together for a common cause. There's peril and some downers, but overwhelmingly this film is about the director's passion for his subject, and your passion for it as well. The jokes will make you smile. The characters will make you love them. The fights will make you squeal with delight. And if you have a heart that's open and idealistic and you love to have fun, you WILL love this movie. If you don't like giant robots, if you don't like monsters, if you don't like rock music, or good special effects, or good acting, or interesting characters, or pretty visuals....you should probably avoid this movie  and every other summer blockbuster that ever gets released in the future.",1376956800,13,7181,4.837947882736156
5390843,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Sometimes it's good to just sit back, relax, and let one's self be overwhelmed by the sheer awesome power of gigantic alien monsters fighting massive metal robots with the fate of humanity in the balance. Sometimes it's good to watch a film that presents a conflict that is delightfully simple, with stark contrasts. Sometimes it's good to be touched emotionally by the power of human friendship and family even in the midst of overwhelming odds. Sometimes it's good to laugh heartily at the gloriously absurd. Sometimes it's good to have a film simultaneously take itself both completely seriously and in the same breath mercilessly make fun of itself. Sometimes it's good to have a nice, clean film during which you do not have to worry about any content issues or subliminal messages aside from a heavy dose of old fashioned heroism and celebration of the human spirit. And sometimes, very rarely, it's good to have all these things rolled into one movie. Reader, I am happy to announce that Pacific Rim is such a film.

The plot of Pacific Rim is astonishingly simple: massive alien monstrosities, known as Kaiju, have invaded Earth through a dimension-bridge deep in the Pacific Ocean, and humanity has set aside it's differences for the greater good, building massive Jaegers, giant mechanized warriors piloted by two mind-melded humans to keep the creatures at bay. These pilots must act in perfect unison, even sharing memories, in order to pilot these massive weapons. I will refrain from detailing the plot further, not because plot details are important or their twists mind-blowing in the slightest, but because the joy of having the story unfold and realizing just how straight up heroic and enjoyable it is is an experience I do not want to rob from you. Suffice to say that the main character, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunman), is a classic cocky yet vulnerable American hero you'll be rooting for in a heartbeat. Marshal Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) proves to be a surprisingly empathetic character (as well as delivering one heck of a pre-battle speech towards the end). Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) is also a pleasant surprise as a heartwarming character, while two scientists played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman almost steal the show with their hilarious and endearing banter and antics.

And that is what is so phenomenal about Pacific Rim: it endears itself to you. You feel for the humans, amidst all of the over the top destruction. When the Jaegers suffer setbacks in combat, we genuinely fear and mourn. When they triumph (particularly our main American Jaeger, ""Gipsy Danger"") we exult and cheer. Director and co-writer Guillermo del Toro wisely does not use his impressive special effects to bombard his audience into submitting to the peril of the story (as Michael Bay's Transformers films did, relying on cheap humor to fill gaps between destruction). Rather, del Toro focuses primarily on building genuine characters and an engrossing tale so that when cities start getting flattened and our heroes are in peril we actually care who wins and who loses. When Gipsy Danger swaggers into battle to save helpless humans we cannot help but celebrate, because it is truly heroic.

Pacific Rim's heroes are offered up to us pure and wholesome, as examples to look up to. Humanity's enemies are portrayed as monstrous and repulsive, evil we genuinely hate. The film is surprisingly colorful, brash and clear in its portrayal of the conflict. It portrays epic amounts of destruction, allowing us to realize the tremendous stakes, but never revels in excessive violence, with a surprisingly low on-screen body count for all the city-leveling. Cinematography-wise, the camera moves slowly and methodically, allowing us to digest the action, instead of being disoriented by it, thus inspiring genuine awe. Pacific Rim is refreshingly simple and optimistic despite its titanic struggles, and is the type of story one would tell to an imaginative young child. Or perhaps it should rather be described as a story such a child would dream up, and is certainly the better for it.

5390844,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I'll admit it -- I liked Michael Bay's first and third ""Transformers"" movies (the second has too many problems for me to enjoy).  Emphasis on LIKE there, as despite being a giant robot fan in general and a Transformers fan specifically, I do not LOVE the movies.  They're mindless dumb fun and something of a guilty pleasure for me, but the confused plots and subplots, unlikable human characters, unnecessary cheesecake shots, and sex and toilet humor drag them down.  I enjoyed watching the robots and the battle scenes, but still awaited the day when a GOOD giant mecha movie would hit cinemas and bring the jaw-dropping WOW factor I was looking for in the Transformers films but never quite found.

""Pacific Rim"" was that movie.  I went in knowing full-well what to expect -- two hours of stuff being destroyed and giant robots and monsters punching each other.  And this film not only did not disappoint, but it offered some much-appreciated elements Bay's films did not -- an actual coherent story, likable human characters, and most of all a heart behind its titanium exterior.

A few years into the future, a rift opens on the ocean floor, admitting beasts from another world called Kaiju.  These monsters begin wreaking havoc along the world's coastlines, destroying cities and killing millions.  In response, humankind builds massive robots called Jaegers (pronounced yay-gers), piloted by teams of two or three who control the mecha with their minds, to combat them.  But the attacks are becoming more frequent... and more deadly, prompting the government to shut down the Jaeger program in favor of simply evacuating the coastlines and going strictly on the defensive.  In a last-ditch gamble, a retired Jaeger pilot assembles the last Jaeger teams together in Hong Kong, aiming to close the rift between worlds once and for all.  In the end, it may fall on a team-up between a cynical ex-pilot and a young rookie, as well as two bickering scientists, to save the world from a monster apocalypse...

Perhaps this film's greatest strength is its special effects.  The robots are incredibly well-rendered and designed, to the point where its possible to forget you're watching CGI instead of actual mecha.  The Kaiju are imaginatively designed, evoking memories of the old Godzilla and Japanese-giant-monster movies while still having their own unique twists.  The settings are creative as well, with the gritty yet fascinating look of a cyberpunk landscape -- with the Bone Slums of Hong Kong and the Shatterdome base perhaps being the most memorable settings.  And of course, the action scenes are phenomenal, and will have viewers on the edge of their seats.  Because what's not to love about 250-foot titans duking it out in the ocean or in the heart of a city?

To my surprise, there's actually a decent plot and characters to accompany the action scenes.  True, the save-the-world-from-alien-invaders isn't exactly new and does bring to mind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day/dp/B0012HF5NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day</a>&nbsp;at points, but here the stakes actually seem real.  I found myself actually caring about what happened to the characters, and feeling their terror and grief, their awe and apprehension, and even their joy and triumph.  The dynamics between the three main characters are believable and interesting, and the supporting cast brings their own brand of humor and humanity to the film as well.  Special props go to the two scientists (one a Kaiju-obsessed biologist and the other a grumpy mathematician who has to rein him in periodically) and to Ron Perlman's scenery-chewing cameo as a black-market Kaiju-parts dealer.  My one gripe is that I wish the other pilot teams could have been developed more -- the Chinese and Russian pilots are practically relegated to background characters, and the Australian pilots seem to serve as one-note rivals to the main characters.

That, and this film leaves out the elements that I felt bogged down the ""Transformers"" films, and is all the better for it.  There's little to no potty humor or innuendo in the film, and the obligatory romance between the male and female leads is so downplayed as to be almost unnoticeable.  The film does focus more on the human characters than the robots, but given that these mecha aren't sentient like the Autobots, this is entirely understandable.

If you're looking for something Oscar-worthy, or for a deep-thinking film that challenges your current set of beliefs, you'll probably be disappointed in ""Pacific Rim.""  But if you just want to have fun for two hours and enjoy some titanic action scenes -- and especially if you're a fan of giant robots, mecha anime, and/or giant-monster movies -- this is a must-see.  It's easily one of the best summer blockbusters I've seen in a long time, and I'd gladly watch it again.",1376870400,5,4912,5.173198482932996

But I want to add that, given the lack of psychological depth to the characters (done on purpose, as with 'Star Wars' or 'Speed Racer'), I found them and their straightforward stories engaging and at times moving. Idris Elba does fine work here, and the flashback to Rinko Kikuchi's character's childhood was astounding.

GIANT MONSTERS VS GIANT ROBOTS! Wait, did I not say that loud enough? GIANT MONSTERS VS GIANT ROBOTS ! So, if you are looking for meaningful human interaction, it's not here.

5390847,2,B00A6UHC0U,"When I saw that Guillermo del Toro was creating a giant robot movie, I was all in.  But much like Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch, Pacific Rim is a slick movie that doesn't live up to it's premise.  And like Snyder, del Toro gets sidetracked from telling the story at hand.

You see, two pilots are needed to run these giant robots and the pilots must under go a mind meld in order for the robots to work.  Because of the mind meld, we lose 20 minutes of story time learning how the mind meld works and another 15 on our hero selecting a compatible partner.  That's some serious time that could have been spent on monster butt kicking.

I actually like the robots and the monsters when they are on-screen.  The CGI is outstanding and blows away anything we've seen so far from the Transformers movies.  The hero isn't anything special but works ok for the movie.

Unfortunately, way too much time is spent on the female lead who has zero personality.  She talks in this annoying whisper and of course ends up sucking up another 10 minutes of screen time with her backstory.

The rest of the characters are right out of Might Morphin Power Rangers including two annoying clowns who serve as comic relief.

There is an audience for this movie but most of them saw it in the theater. If you are a hard-core robot fan and somehow managed to miss this in the theaters then by all means, check it out.  Otherwise, give this one a pass.",1376611200,9,1424,4.409961685823755
5390848,5,B00A6UHC0U,"A Guillermo Del Toro Masterpiece! H.P. Lovecraft-like monsters fighting awesome giant robots in a ""Weird Tale"" dripping with ultra-realistic special effects like sea-water streaming off gigantic Cthulhu, a mile tall, rising up from the sunken city of R'lyeh in the South Pacific. We witness an Earth-empire-in-decay, as the human race starts to lose to the ""The Call of Cthulhu"" inspired Creatures. World-Culture crumbles, in a realistically eerie take on this pulp adventure myth. However, in true Del Toro style, FEAR is balanced with LOVE. Guillermo goes further than any movie maker would, and gives this epic struggle ""Heart""! Passion & Honor! Like a grand opera! He writes people that you care about in these mecha-titans; even fan-favorite Ron Perlman gives his pirate Hannibal Chau warmth. I got teary eyed, and, yep... I cried, when the 3rd act came! When tough guy Herc Hansen tells his hard-ass son Chuck Hansen what a tough guy.. just can't say to his son... oh damn... (snif!) A Gosh Damned good monster movie! Perhaps the BEST! Horror/Pulp fans have waited since H. P. Lovecraft's story, ""The Call of Cthulhu"", was published in Weird Tales in 1928, to finally see his incredible creatures realisticly depicted in a film. Now, some 85 years later, movie technology has caught up with Lovecraft's imagination. Only Guillermo Del Toro could bring it to you with such fan-boy love and fine storytelling craftsmanship. It is an amazing fact that ""The Call of Cthulhu"" was written in 1926, and it's taken until now for us to produce visual SFX that equal H.P.Lovecraft's genius. Take all that and give it to a master story telly like Guillermo Del Toro and you get back cinematic GOLD. Maybe it didn't make the $ on the 1srt week-end like some badly written, throw-away comedy with a ""star"" attached to it, but TIME WILL TELL. This film, ""Pacific Rim"", will build a cult following. It'll be cherished for years. It was made with love and passion, and it shows. The other ""blockbuster"" films of this year will fade, till no-one remembers them.

That amazing sensation of seeing the impossible becoming alive was overwhelming. You will feel the same way watching Pacific Rim. This movie captures you in its world and only gives you back after the credits.

Everything feels real, be it the Kaijus, gigantic monsters hell bent in exterminating humanity, or the Jaegers, giant robots created to fight the monsters when everything else fails and nuking the planet repeatedly would only speed the monsters' job.

You can feel how their heavy mass reacts with the environment while they move, the destruction the Kaiju causes in their wake and the ocean reacting to Jaeger's movement. The battles between monsters and machines are perfect.

Without spoiling anything I can say that the entire movie is very entertaining, including the parts without fights, as the characters are likable and believable. Idris Alba and Rinko Kikuchi are amazing in this movie. My only criticism is that the movie doesn't focus enough in the awesome Russian and Chinese teams but they steal the scene in the few ones they appear.

By the way, as I write this the movie is still in theaters so do yourself a favor and go watch it in 3D or, better yet, in an IMAX theater. You can thank me later.",1376524800,6,1327,4.781659388646288
5390850,3,B00A6UHC0U,"`Pacific Rim' is not the type of movie I would normally be excited about seeing.  I do, on occasion, like the big budget action films, but more so than not it is when there is some nostalgia laced with it.  Superhero movies based on famous characters of my youth or reboots of franchises that I remember loving as a child; those are the special effects heavy behemoths that I generally gravitate towards.  Something like `Pacific Rim' looked, to me, like one of those geek-fest videogame movies that pop up and earn legions of devoted fans but get panned by critics and pretty much serves up forgettable explosions.  Still, some friends really wanted to see it and so they drug me to the movies last night.  I was really hesitant.  The guy at the ticket counter hadn't seen it, so he was of no help, and then in walked two middle-aged men who clearly lived with their mothers, chattering about `The Hobbit' and the upcoming `City of Bones' movie, and as I watched them walk into the `Pacific Rim' theater I was convinced that I was going to hate the next two hours of my life.

A lot about `Pacific Rim' makes little sense, but at the end of the day this was one fun movie!

Guillermo del Toro is not a director I'm very familiar with.  I know that he loves fantasy and videogames and he has a huge cult following, but the only film of his that I've seen is `Pan's Labyrinth' and so I'm not entirely versed in his filmography or style.  If this is any indication, he likes things big and loud.  He certainly delivered on both of those fronts.

The story is rather simple.  Mysterious creatures called Kaiju have been terrorizing earth for years.  The humans created mind controlled gigantic robots to fight these Kaiju and got really good at it.  Everything seemed well, the men who pilot the robots (known as Jaegers) are superstars and the world seems safe from extinction, until the Kaiju smarten up and begin to find ways of defeating the Jaegers, locating their weaknesses and developing weapons.  It then becomes evident that the Jaegers are not the best defense and the government switches to building a massive wall to protect earth.  That doesn't work so well (you think?) and so they develop some plan of attack to get a bomb in the portal used by the Kaiju to attack.  In the process, we have a washed up pilot and a wannabe pilot, both with tragic backstories, fighting against an arrogant pilot and a stubborn leader as they wage war on these creatures.

This is basically `Transformers vs. Godzilla: The Movie'.

Like I said, a lot of this doesn't make sense, and the film is littered with serious flaws.  The lazy backstory given the Kaiju, the fact that they only have one portal they come from, the fact that these giant robots are carried to the sea by a few small helicopters, the fact that they don't use their swords until after they are ripped to pieces, the fact that one fight scene literally wipes the entire Hong Kong population off the map.  The list goes on and on.  The fact that everyone YELLS EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME or the fact that stereotypes litter everything, especially when it comes to the nerdy scientists.

But, for all of these flaws, the film was a lot of fun from start to finish.

The graphics here are OUTSTANDING, and I mean that.  They are the cleanest, sharpest, most graphic effects I've seen in film in a while.  From the creation of the Kaiju to the detailed Jaegers, this is some visually impressive stuff.  The first twenty minutes of the film serve as a masterful example of what `movie magic' is all about, and this is one of those films where the 3D actually works a great deal.  I also loved some of the minor touches, like how when we meet out leading lady she is concealed with an umbrella, making us think that she is some big Hollywood face, only to have her revealed as Rinko Kikuchi.  I liked that most of the cast were unknowns, or faces known more for their television work.  It took out the `movie star' and gave this more identity.

Still, this movie can't escape being stupid.  It deliberately goes for camp in many areas, and for the most part it works, even when it doesn't, if that makes sense.  The plot holes were everywhere, but it didn't matter one bit, because I enjoyed every minute of it.",1376524800,2,4266,4.51171875
5390851,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Probably the most fun I have had at a movie since Star Wars and E.T. Yes, I'm a grown man, and I was giddy like a little kid all the way through this film. Great stuff!",1376438400,5,168,3.6944444444444446

You want plot? I'll give you plot: Giant robots. With buzz saws, swords, guns, and fists. Fighting giant monsters. With acid, horns, claws, and wings.

And that is all the plot you need. Let the most fun, action-packed, thrilling, awesome, escapist action/science fiction blockbuster event of the year begin! Pacific Rim is a film that appeals to the 12-year-olds in all of us. The action takes place on a gigantic scale, huge, operatic, devastating, lots of bashing and punching, but here's the thing: it was refreshing to see a climactic fight scene that did NOT take place in a major city, in which huge skyscrapers are destroyed, with people running from men in spandex. There was a lot of city destruction, but compared to Man of Steel or Star Trek Into Darkness or The Avengers, Pacific Rim was refreshingly ""light and airy.""

Those were director Guillermo del Toro's words on the tone he was hoping to strike for the film, as opposed to the usual ""super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie."" Although the majority of the film takes place in the dark and the rain, I believe he succeeded.

...

But let me tell you this: I have never been more involved in a movie than when I watched Pacific Rim in the cinema. I was cheering during the fight scenes and literally gripping the sides of my chair in some parts. The characters were real and sympathetic, and even the Jaegers become relatable characters. This is in no small part to the acting, which was all round excellent and, at times, surprisingly subtle.

The human characters have realistic drama and conflict, and their actions and emotions are real to the audience...blah blah BLAH. Of course; we all know that. Del Toro is a veteran director, adept at world-building, immersive atmosphere, memorable characters, sincere emotion, and utter terror. But that's not what you came for, is it? We came for giant robots versus giant monsters. And on that front...Pacific Rim delivers!

The action, is, in a word, completely AWESOME.  I say that in the literal sense. The Hong Kong fight will blow your friggin' mind. I was literally cheering at the screen. When you read it from a secondhand perspective, it may sound clichd or even juvenile, but that moment where Crimson Typhoon (China) comes out with its 4 buzz saws, and Cherno Alpha (Russia) starts punching kaiju face...it's enough to make you feel 12 years-old again. It's the most incredibly thrilling and viscerally awesome scene in a movie I have seen in a long, long time. And I see a lot of movies. I could have given Pacific Rim 5 stars for that scene alone.

...

But let's talk cons. This is definitely a more of a guy's movie. Nearly every female in the audience I watched it with described it as ""Crazy"", or halfheartedly called it ""Good..."" or, ""Not my type of movie"". There are a quite a few plot holes, and I feel that the climax was not handled as well as it should have (could have). There was a curious lack of emotion, and let me just say that it was slightly underwhelming for me.

But that is not to detract from this otherwise excellent film. Technically, Guillermo strikes home. The CGI is amazing, and the use of 3D adds rather than detracts from the film. The score by Ramin Djawadi is stirring and catchy and completely awesome; becoming my new  FAVOURITE 2013 SCORE, taking 1st prize over Hans Zimmer's more operatic  Man of Steel score. The editing is very good; no shaky cam here. The camera work is filled with Del Toro's typically beautiful, stylistic flourishes and striking imagery.  The production design feels lived in, worn in, and is realistic without taking all the fun out of the entertaining sci-fi world Pacific Rim takes place in.

...

I'm running out of things to say here. Just go watch Pacific Rim, preferably at the biggest screen possible, in 3D (excellent use of it, I must say), and with the volume blaring. It's that rare thing in Hollywood nowadays: the completely original blockbuster. And as such, we must hail Guillermo del Toro as one of the great cinematic visions of our time. This is a subject of passion to him, and he directs with passion and with fervour. And the audiences, well, they're just swept along for the ride of a lifetime!

Just go watch Pacific Rim! My rating? Level five kaiju out of five.

P.S. Guillermo del Toro, we NEED a sequel!",1376438400,16,6336,5.853579175704989
5390853,4,B00A6UHC0U,"After seeing many one-star reviews that don't even mention the film I thought I'd throw in my own review that actually analyses the movie so that you fully understand what you're getting into. I'll be covering:
Story(Spoiler free)
Sound
Visuals
Characters
Popular Criticisms(That aren't spoilers)
===
So in a fictional very-near future. A portal known later as ""The Breach"" opens up in the deep Pacific Ocean trenches. Kaiju(Japanese for giant monster) start coming through The Breach and begin destroying things. It takes several days to take down the first one using conventional weaponry(jets, tanks, ballistic missiles) so they decide to initiate the Jaeger program. Which created giant mechs that bring the fight with the Kaiju to an equal playing field. The story from there is an on-par story that won't make you think hard but it also won't make you feel stupid(Maybe just a little) either. It doesn't bring up any stupid questions about philosophy. The story shows what humanity can do when it puts the bs behind it and works together.
===
The sound is loud and jarring. A bit distracting at times but it fits with the fact that you have skyscrapper sized robots and monsters fighting. It's all very immersive and none of it uses stock sound effects. Also the soundtrack is great. If you need to understand the feeling of the movie just listen to the theme song on Youtube as that sets the mood for the ENTIRE MOVIE.
===
This is the best looking movie I've ever seen. Especially since it balances practical effects and CGI. The inside of the Jaeger and all the cables hooked up to the pilots are real tangible objects(Minus the spinning death blade inside Gipsy Danger). And the monster were designed with anatomical accuracy so that if these Kaiju were real they wouldn't be too far off from what you see in this movie. There is also so much attention to small details. Such as when a Kaiju named Knifehead stabs a Jaeger. It's blade has it's own blood on it from being cut up by the tearing metal. That's attention to detail you won't find in other summer action films. And I love it.
===
Characters in this film are deliberate cardboard cut-outs except for Idri Elba's character Stacker. This is all in homage to the b-list monster movies that many grew up with so I think they get a free pass(For the most part). Except when the one Australian character said ""I'll drop you like a sack of Kaiju s***."" Get it? Because the only thing worse than a sack of excrement is one belonging to what could end humanity? Yeah it's cringe worthy and dialogue like this influenced me making my review four stars instead of five.
===
A VERY popular criticism of the movie is ""Why didn't they use the sword sooner?"" Well that's actual answered in the beginning when it shows Knifehead tear the plasma cannon off a Jaeger because it was already hit by it once. You see, the Kaiju are living beings so they will learn as they fight(Later on a Kaiju actually disables on of the blades because of this fact). They show early on that you can't be a one trick pony while fighting. I'm not sure how people forget this.

""Why didn't they curb stomp that one Kaiju that they double-tapped?"" For the same reason this is only four stars and not five.
===
Should you see this film? Not if you're a philosophical scholar who thinks all films have to be deep, complex, and thought-provoking to be worth your time. If you're looking for the best monster movie of all time. Then yes.",1376265600,9,3464,4.641693811074918

5390865,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I read many reviews about this film saying it is garbage.
This movie is far from garbage. It's problem : oriental story for american market. Guillermo Del Toro was forced to make this film for the American market. That was the only mistake, this movie should have been directed by Del Toro but with a Japanese production.
He could have done in the style of the film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", a film totally oriental, then it would have been done better.
Considering that, this is a great movie. But only if you know the tradition of japanese stories in this style.
The action scenes are excellent. The story manages to hold the attention. Should have done more in the style of a comic book. The emotional scenes not convinced. There is a romantic couple inserted by obligation (ladies, girlfriends, wives?). Requirements for U.S. market and for a greater audience.
The film was produced in the best way possible and is the best (only one?) for fans of the genre.

Update:
Please support Del Toro and buy the blu-ray .

Premise: Aliens have decided that it's time to wreck a little hell on planet Earth and take it over. It's up the the last of the human resistance to make sure they save what's left of humanity from annihilation.

Review: OMG, this movie had me so excited as I sat there with my tasty, unnecessarily expensive ginger ale (at least it was free refills) and overpriced ""gourmet"" burgers. But enough about my shake down at the cinema, and on to one of the summer's most amazing movies!

Are you looking for action? Hell yeah, you are,  who isn't? Well, I'm here to tell you, there is tons of action in this movie. For every anime fan out there who loves anime shows/movies with huge robots battling monsters, this is also the movie for you.

Oh, and Sons of Anarchy fans will be happy to see both Jax and Clay in the same film. *Giggle*. What I loved about Pacific Rim was the special effects. They didn't look corny or too computerized. You actually felt like what you seeing could be real. The characters were well developed and they had heart. you actually cared when something horrible happened to them. Another thing I liked was that this plot went through a time line from the first alien attack and what was done to counter future attacks. It brought you up to date. So it wasn't like you had to watch them struggle with a plan, then waste action movie time building the machines. You get to jump right into the excitement even before the credits started.

That's how you do it, people.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and wouldn't mind seeing it again.

5390870,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Objectively speaking this is a bad film - subjectively speaking I had megatons of fun watching it! Below, all the reasons for which I think everybody should give ""Pacific Rim"" a try. WARNING - limited SPOILERS below.

1. Cool giant robots. The four Jaegers (Gypsy Danger, Striker Eureka, Cherno Alpha and Crimson Typhoon) are well done.

2. Cool giant monsters. The kaijus we see in the film are very impressive and they also have cool names (although not all the names figure in the film itself): Trespasser (the first one), Scissure, Reckoner, Onibaba, Spinejackal, Bonesquid, Kojiyama, Hardship, Reckoner, Ceramander, Tentalus, Knifehead, Yamarashi, Mutavore, Leatherback, Otachi, Raiju, Scunner, Slattern (the last to appear), etc. etc.

3. A magnificent absence of scenario. This is a very liberating experience, watching a film, which consists ENTIRELY in special effects and fights between giant monsters and giant robots.

4. A splendid irrelevance of most actors. Again, this is sheer fun to watch a film in which almost all actors are completely redundant, as the scenario doesn't give them anything important to say or to do. You could safely replace Idris Elba with Britney Spears, Charlie Hunnam by a card-board, Max Martini by a bottle of XXXX, Robert Kazinsky by a brick and Clifton Collins by a cocker-spaniel - and nobody would notice! And that really is a great thing allowing us to focus on:

- cool fights
- popcorn and soda
- making out with wife/girlfriend.

5. A hot Oriental chick. Rinko Kikuchi is cute like a button and she is also very important for this film, because if it was not for her the suits worn by Jaeger pilots would not be so cool (it was important to show her shapes).

6. The two utterly ridiculous and annoying scientists, Geiszler and Gottlieb, who act like a bickering old couple (I would not be surprised if they were one...) and provide most of the humour in the film.

7. Ron Perlman's shoes. Now, Ron Perlman is not really allowed to play in this film, but his shoes - now, that, is a whole different enchilada! It is a most cruel and thanks God not so frequent occurrence that an actor is outstaged by his apparel - but when it happens, it is definitely worth seeing.

8. The post-credits joke scene. Really good one - so wait a little before leaving the cinema or turning off the DVD player.

9. The possibility to better understand the upcoming ""Honest trailer"" by Screen Junkies and especially the ""Everything wrong with Pacific Rim"" by Cinema Sins - in both cases I expect they will have the field day working on this film ... )))

10. The possibility to invent new Jaegers. Here just a couple of possible candidates quickly gathered, mostly from the IMDB site: Panzer Angela (Germany) -best armoured, it would sing Wagner; Tropical Triad (Malaysia, Thailand, Singapour) - most agile, it would massage; Taekwon Victory (South Korea) - the jumpiest, it would kick @ss; Matador Fury (Mexico) - the most macho, it would wear a sombrero; Eager Beaver (Canada) - the most polished, it would give hugs...; Neutralium Interno (Switzerland) - the best armed, but it would not fight...; Holy Molly (Vatican City) - it would wear a tiara and offer last rites. As the possibilities are infinite, I expect this game to go on for some time on the web...)))

11. The possibility to see alien invaders even more stupid than those in ""Independence Day"" and ""Battleship"" - and that was a tall order to fill...)))

12. Preparation for a possible sequel. Well, even if this film rather underperformed, the sequel, with possible appearance of Category 6 and 7 kaijus, could still be made. So let's get ready.

CONCLUSION: Objectively, not a good film, but great fun to watch nevertheless. And honestly, the box office and reviews (including mine) be darned - it gave me good time and when patiently waiting for the next ""Godzilla"" I will buy ""Pacific Rim"" on DVD as soon as available, to cheer me up during some long, cold winter evenings and encourage me to consume more Jaeger...

5390874,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I have heard people compare Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim to the likes of Godzilla, The Power Rangers, Transformers and Voltron, but I liken Pacific Rim to a combination Godzilla, Transformers and Top Gun, but with del Toro's own unique storyline and vision. Yes there are elements from the 1986 film Top Gun in Pacific Rim, but I'll get to back to that in a little bit. In a summer filled with endless sequels and comic book films Guillermo del Toro brilliantly brought to life his science fiction monster epic that is both a breath of fresh air and highly entertaining summer blockbuster.

In the not so distant future aliens called the Kaiju have invaded Earth, but instead of traveling millions of light years to reach earth the Kaiju have invaded Earth from deep below the Pacific Ocean through a dimensional portal. These Kaiju are hundreds of feet tall devastating everything in their path. With the cost of taking down one single giant monster so high both militarily and humanitarianly the governments of Earth pool their resources together to create giant robots called Jaegers to fight the Kaiju. These giant robots require two pilots who must meld minds, and act as one to pilot the Jaegers. At first the Earth forces are highly successful in eliminating the Kaiju who incidentally only come through the dimensional rift one at a time, but that soon changes when Jaeger pilots Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and his brother Yancy Becket (Diego Klattenhoff) encounter a new kind of Kaiju off the coast of Alaska that is stronger, faster and has adapted to the Jaegers fighting abilities, and the Kaiju soon turn the tide on the Earth forces and the Jaegers.

Five years after the events of the coast of Alaska the Jaegers are losing on all fronts, which makes the Earth governments to make a desperately ill-advised decision of making huge sea walls. Why they actually thought that some walls would stop giant aliens from another dimension I do not know, but isn't surprising these are politicians after all, and these so called leaders of Earth make another unwise move by shutting down the Jaeger program sending their leader Marshal Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) to a base in Hong Kong where he and the last of the Jaegers from across the world make a last ditch effort to close down the portal between our world and the aliens world. Here in Hong Kong is the last hope to save humanity. Will they succeed or will it be the world as we know it come to an end? Well you'll just have to see the film to find out.

Travis Beacham and del Toro's script has many interesting elements to it from where the Kaiju come from, what they really are and what their goals are to the neural interfaces between the Jaeger pilots, which I thought was cool. The two Jaeger pilots minds are linked giving each pilot access to the others mind and memories, and the stronger the bond between the pilots the better team they are. I found this subject interesting, and could definitely see something like what is in the film happening in the not so distant future. Now with that said there are problems with the script. It is very predictable as you can basically know who is going to die and live, and basically how the film will end. For a few minutes in Pacific Rim I felt like I was watching Top Gun all over again. I am not sure if del Toro or Beacham have seen the film or not, but anyone who has seen Top Gun will know what I am talking about. For example all the Jaeger pilots are basically character from Top Gun. Raleigh is the lose canon ""Maverick"" while is brother Yancy is ""Goose"". Jaeger pilot Chuck Hansen is the ""Iceman"" while is father is ""Hollywood"", and Pentecost would be a combination of ""Viper"" and ""Jester"". The rest of the Jaeger pilots from Hong Kong and Russia would easily fill out the rest of the characters from Top Gun. There is even a battle scene in the film that easily resembles the climax in Top Gun where Iceman and Hollywood along with two other F-14's are ambushed and outnumbered by a squadron of MIG's, and it is up to Maverick to save them all, and to top it off the scene almost ends the exact same way.

Still even with the similarities I enjoyed the storyline and especially the characters. I really liked the character Raleigh Becket. Sure the character storyline is nothing original, but I thought Charlie Hunnam gave a good performance as Becket. Idris Elba who was great in Prometheus is stuck in a predictable character who gives the usual general or commander's speeches when faced with an insurmountable obstacle, yet he still manages to breathe some life into his character. Even though he was playing a similar character personality wise to Charlie Kelly who he plays on the television show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Charlie Day is still hilarious in Pacific Rim as Dr. Newton Geizler a scientist and Kaiju groupie who plays a pivotal role in the film. Hunnam and Elba might be the ""stars"" of Pacific Rim, but the real star of the film is Rinko Kikuchi. The Japanese actress plays Mako Mori the shy adopted daughter of Pentecost who desires for revenge on the Kaiju for killing her parents. The attractive Kikuchi brings such life to the character without much dialog whether it is from her facial expressions like a simple smile or from the look in her eyes Kikuchi can display so much with so little. I really never thought I would say this because I love Ron Perlman, but he was not need in Pacific Rim or at least with the character and storyline del Toro gave him. Ron Perlman plays the black market dealer Hannibal Chau deals primarily with Kaiju goods. The talented actor was wasted with the role he was given, and Chau was useless to the plot just as was the whole Hong Kong plot of searching for a Kaiju brain,, so they can leak to the Kaiju memories. I was hoping Perlman would have given a better character and role to play in Pacific Rim.

The Transformers films and Bay successfully made it possible to create believable giant robots in films, and whether you like Bay and is Transformers films or not I doubt del Toro would have been allowed to make Pacific Rim if the Transformers films had not been hugely successful. Instead Del Toro surpasses what the special effects artists did in the Transformers films and beautifully brings his world to life. The Jaegers are masterfully rendered on screen with each machine unique and detailed with their own personality. The same is said for the Kaiju. The effects are done wonderfully giving life to these giant alien creatures, which greatly benefit the action scenes that are remarkable.

I really wanted Pacific RIm to be a great science fiction epic, but what I got was a refreshing and highly entertaining film. Pacific Rim will not go down as Guillermo del Toro's best written or directed film, but del Toro does masterfully bring his vision that is Pacific Rim to life. While the some elements of the script and details of the characters are predictable they are both well-crafted and entertaining that you won't mind those flaws, and will be to distracted by the beautiful effects and outstanding action sequences. Anyone looking for a cool science fiction action film or just want to escape the endless sequels and superhero films than I highly recommend they go see Pacific Rim. I highly doubt you will be disappointed with Pacific Rim.",1375660800,6,7364,4.669491525423729

The story is very simple, and is relatively straightfoward. There are monsters coming from the ocean and creating alot of havoc, and mankind decides to fight back with giant mechs. There, I summed up the movie. But really, is that so bad? No.

It is a blockbuster through and through, but unlike other giant robot movies, there is no Micheal bay. Instead, we get really good characters (depending on who you are), Really good writing ( again, depending on who you are), and Kickass Kaiju battles ( they are kickass no matter who you are).

5390877,5,B00A6UHC0U,"""Pacific Rim"", the new film from writer/director Guillermo Del Toro (""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""Hellboy"") is very simply the film we all hope to see every time we go to the movies during the summer. It is, with one small exception, the perfect summer film.

Every summer, the studios overhype their biggest bets and get the movie going public excited about films that will probably end up letting us down. From the sequel with too many special effects and little or no character development to the endless big screen adaptations of super heroes and countless attempts to scare us with gory humor or gross out comedy, these films are usually missing at least one element to make them something special, something to care about, something to remember. Usually, that element is balance; special effects are good but need to be balanced by character development and narrative.

But ""Pacific Rim"" isn't a sequel, has great special effects, great action, a believable and interesting backstory and significant character development. If there is anything to criticize, it does use a tried and true formulaic set-up for the ending. But the rest of the film is so good; this can and should be overlooked.

The film opens a few years into the Kaiju War. A few years back, giant space aliens begin to invade Earth through a rift in the Pacific Rim. These monsters begin to attack our cities, killing untold millions of people and causing catastrophic destruction. Governments join forces and form an alliance combining resources to figure out how to battle these monsters. The solution? Jaegers - large robots manned by two pilots who are connected via a mind probe operating the large robots as a team. The Jaegers are dispatched from a number of stations located around the Pacific. And the program works until the Kaiju start to learn. And start to win again. Flash forward a few years, and the program is going to be shut down. Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), the leader of the program recruits a number of the best Jaeger pilots to lead one last ditch attempt to get rid of them once and for all. He brings everyone to Hong Kong, the last operational station, to join Dr. Geiszler (Charlie Day, TV's ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia""), who believes he can do a mind meld with one of the Kaiju, Gottlieb (Burn Gorman, TV's ""Torchwood""), the crazy inventor who comes up with the equipment they need and Ops Tendo Choi (Clifton Collins, Jr.) who is the man in charge of guiding the missions. One of the pilots Stacker brings to Hong Kong is Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) who has been living incognito for a few years, since his last mission failed and his co-pilot died. When the team is assembled, they begin to realize certain things about the Kaiju and come up with a plan to end the invasion once and for all. Stacker is forced to team Raleigh with a trainee, Mako (Rinko Kinkuchi), his own protg, but watches them very closely to see if they can handle the assignment.

I admire Guillermo Del Toro. He was clearly influenced by fantasy and sci-fi films as a kid and has devoted his career as a filmmaker to create more films to add to this genre. This early influence seems to drive him to make more interesting and unusual films, films that test the boundaries of these genres. As a director, he brings an incredible depth of detail to the composition of his films, layering images and ideas, creating something for the viewer to feast on, much like the creatures feast on their victims in many of his films. He has also used his newfound clout in Hollywood to produce and `Present"" a number of projects from other filmmakers - his hand has been in everything from animation to genre horror. While these films are more interesting and unusual because of his involvement, the films he directs are the special ones, the ones to keep an eye out for.

In ""Pacific Rim"", he and his team create an incredible backstory, smartly placing us in the middle of the action. Brief voiceover from Raleigh gets us up to speed and then we join him on a battle, watching the robots and monsters battle in the waters off Alaska. But that isn't enough for Del Toro - as each character is introduced, we learn something about them, their history, even if it is just from a seemingly offhand comment. Because we know more about these characters, they seem more real and we invest more emotion in them, making the outcome of their journey all the more important to us.

I have to say that with all of the CGI flooding the multiplex, I was worried that ""Pacific Rim"" would be another example of a director who runs rampant with his toy box, using every toy at his disposal whether it makes sense or not. And that is exactly what Del Toro does, but he does it in a way that works brilliantly. The key difference between Del Toro and most other directors is that the CGI is used to tell the story, not to cover up the holes in the narrative. In the ""Transformers"" films, the robots crash into buildings and streets and construction, causing destruction but surrounding areas are remarkably intact. In ""Pacific Rim"", these robots and aliens are huge, so when they move through specific types of areas, their movements cause destruction, breaking windows and walls simply because the huge creatures are moving through the area. It is a big difference and adds to the realism of the story.

The battles between the Kaiju and the Jaegers are impressively staged. The action is pretty thrilling and easy to follow, which isn't often said when watching action staged using CGI. Generally, a `real' element is needed to ground the action - frequently actors on the ground running from the large CGI beasts - and make it seem real. In ""Pacific Rim"", the CGI is so good everything already seems real so this extra distraction isn't needed. What is even more impressive is most of the battles take place at night, in the rain, or both, so the palette is darker. These scenes are more interesting and better staged than scenes in the ""Transformers"" films, most of which take place in broad daylight. Del Toro isn't afraid to step back and use a wide shot occasionally, allowing us to view the entire scene. Michael Bay keeps his compositions much more confined, which limits them and makes the film feel less grand.

The actors are all good and create viable characters - It helps that they all have a history to work with making them more interesting. Hunnam, cast in a role that was reportedly written for him, brings a lot of complexity to the role of Raleigh. Living off the grid for a while, it takes him some time to get back up to speed, to refill his hero batteries. Idris Elba is very good as the leader of this group. When the heads of the nations involved in the program tell him the Jaeger's will soon be replaced by a giant ""Kaiju-proof"" wall, you can see the disbelief, pain and disappointment in his eyes. His relationship with Mako also helps to create a lot of empathy for both, making us as invested in his character as we are in Rinku Kinkuchi. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman provide some much needed comic relief. And it wouldn't be a Del Toro film without Ron Pearlman, who plays a black market dealer specializing in Kaiju parts. His role is also funny, adding some much needed laughs.

My one complaint is that the last act is pretty predictable. Del Toro places all of the characters in very familiar places and you can easily see what will happen and when. In the hands of a less experienced or less interesting director, this would be a problem. But Del Toro has already created such a unique landscape filled with interesting characters when this happens that it is easier to overlook.

I enjoyed the first ""Transformers"" film, but ""Pacific Rim"" is heads and shoulders above that level. Which shouldn't really be a surprise. Michael Bay is no Guillermo Del Toro.

Come on, how could any film with giant robots battling giant aliens be bad? It's like watching a new, good version of a Godzilla-on-steroids film.",1375574400,14,7992,4.669034090909091
5390878,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Giant robots fighting Lovecraftian monsters. That is all. GIANT ROBOTS FIGHTING LOVECRAFTIAN MONSTERS.

That sentence tells you pretty much everything you need to know about ""Pacific Rim,"" which is Guillermo del Toro's loving valentine to Japanese monster movies and mecha anime. It isn't a deep movie, but it doesn't pretend to be -- it just wants to entertain you with giant robots beating up grotesque sea monsters, and it succeeds at that.

When an interdimensional rift allows monstrous kaiju to attack Australia, the US, Japan, China and Russia (for some reason, no Mexico and/or Chile), those countries band together to create Jaegers -- giant mecha suits to destroy the kaiju, with mind-linked pilots inside. Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) was one of the pilots, until his brother was killed and the American Jaeger ""Gipsy Danger"" was wrecked by a new, stronger kind of kaiju.

When the governments stupidly abandon the program (they're building a WALL!), Commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) takes the program rogue -- refurbishing old Jaegers and recruiting old pilots. He convinces a reluctant Raleigh to co-pilot the newly-repaired Gipsy Danger, but both Raleigh and his Japanese copilot Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) struggle with their traumatic memories.

In the meantime, Pentecost is planning to somehow drop a nuke into the fissure and close it for good. As the dwindling Jaeger forces are battered by new and stronger kaiju, wacky scientist Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) discovers the horrifying truth behind the kaiju invasion -- and what will happen to the human race if they aren't stopped for good.

""Pacific Rim"" does have a decent sci-fi plot about alien monsters attacking the world, but let's not pretend that is the movie's core. The real draw here is watching giant robots punching glowy sea monsters in the face, and then clubbing them with a convenient steel ship. Why? Because Guillermo del Toro is a nerd and loving it.

It also tends to be a bit over-the-top cheesy (""Today we are CANCELING THE APOCALYPSE!""), but del Toro does insert some quieter moments where the characters reflect on the horrors that have propelled them there. And the plot -- yes, there is one -- manages to be both simple and twisty, with a string of unexpected revelations about the kaiju and where they came from.

Admittedly the movie does fall short in some places -- the Russians have about two lines, and I don't think the Chinese triplets had ANY. Also, the comic relief scientists can be a bit grating, especially since they are American and British stereotypes.

However, the other characters aren't -- they're depicted as strong but damaged people, and there are moments where we see them reflecting on how they came there. Elba is powerful and restrained as the noble commander, Hunnam is a solid rugged hero you can root for, and Kikuchi is a lean, quietly intense presence as a young woman whose life was forever changed by the kaiju. And yes, we have Ron Perlman as the weirdest Chinese gangster you will ever see.

If the idea of robots bashing monsters fills your geek heart with glee, ""Pacific Rim"" is the perfect movie -- its only goal is to entertain you and blow kisses at Japanese entertainment. Definitely worth a watch.",1375574400,5,3250,4.981549815498155

Fun, action packed movie. Not a lot of depth in the storyline, acting isn't going to win any awards, but its a highly entertaining, visually stunning (especially in 3D), live-action-mecha vs alien straight popcorn flick.

I initially was hoping that del Toro would channel his amazing talent with mixing drama-horror (Pan's Labyrinth/Devil's Backbone), making something that was both emotionally deep and visually astonishing, but it was his Hellboy style all the way. If you don't mind the cheesy characters and storyline arcs that follow those kind of movies, then you'll find the movie a treat full of great special effects and sci-if action.",1375488000,7,815,5.174242424242424

Stoner two: ""I think Optimus could take Godzilla!""

5390882,5,B00A6UHC0U,"For me, Pacific Rim is the first of its kind for the Western Culture to make.  Now yes, there are Transformers and movies such as that, but to have Mecha involving the human aspect was definitely a first!  I'm always watching the SyFy channel; but this is first one I've seen from a Western culture standpoint where the ""robot"" is huge and the pilot is inside it.  Being a huge Anime fan (especially Gundam Wing - which is pure Mecha), I found this movie stepping forward in the direction of more Mecha films to hopefully come from the Western culture.

I've read countless movies' reviews, box office numbers, ratings, etc.  And despite the ""not so great"" box office numbers, this movie still had more positive reviews than a lot that came out around it.  Just the week before Pacific Rim came out, Despicable Me 2 was in the theatres and had huge box office numbers but the reviews were more toward ""average to negative.""  That alone shows the fans and even those who didn't know what to expect, did have fun watching something different.

One of my favorite things I enjoyed about this movie was the main Jaeger - ""Gypsy Danger"".  Even before I watched the interview of the different Jaegers, I thought of Gypsy Ranger as having a cowboy likeness.  Then I found out from what Guillermo del Toro had said ""...wanted very much to feel like a classic gunslinger.  And we gave it the anatomy of a big cowboy.""  I did enjoy how each and every Jaeger was different in more than just their appearance.

I've seen countless alien movies and cannot recall one that had huge aliens such as the Kaiju in this film.  I remember thinking the one Kaiju kept reminding me of a gorilla with how it moved and found out from another interview, that they did base the Kaiju off some animals with their movements and such.  It brought a sense of realistic ""monsters"".  Instead of a giant T-rex, you now have a giant gorilla.

The music....if the music doesn't match the movie; I will fall out of it immediately.  In Pacific Rim, the music ROCKED!!  The pounding, I could feel pound in my heart as the scenes played out.  The trailer had a song just for Pacific Rim and I feel in love with that one just as much as I fell in love with the soundtrack.

The last thing I want to mention is the storyline and the different emotions brought in.  There is not another Western Culture science fiction movie that I have seen that has brought out so many emotions.  At times, you have comedy relief that helps your remember to cling to the hope that the fighters will win - that there isn't hopelessness.  The characters are human and act like it!  They show emotions and cling to the past and try to figure out the future.  There are sad moments and I did cry!

5390896,1,B00A6UHC0U,"I'm one of the few that couldn't handle the tediousness of this film.

Brilliant director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy) really missed this mark on this one big time. He co-wrote the script with Travis Beecham (Dog Days of Summer, Clash of the Titans re-make) from a story that Travis originated, but above all else they didn't come up with characters or people we, as an audience, really care about. There was an attempt at a faulty brother bonding, and another attempt at a somewhat over ambition cross-overs of ego inflated military types and an yet another attempt at a father-son, father daughter-relationship that just wasn't real or believable.

Now this film is at least an hour too long as well because it literally runs over two and a half hours. The monster did things that defy their own logic. (Throw real physics out the window of course!) By the 47th building being collapsed, destroyed, knocked-down, I was bored. The sequences are really tied together strangely and the effects, although state of the art, have all been done before. The story is simple. Interdimensional beings have visited us in the past and now they want to take over the earth using a portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Really? Yawn.

For me, the best thing was this small, but powerful performance by a small Japanese actress played wonderfully by Mana Ashida (The Floating Castle, Beautiful Rain). Her performance was heartfelt, warm and although very short, it was very memorable. She didn't say much, but you knew exactly what was going on in her heart and head.

Now they tried to sprinkle in `hip-hop' type humor with Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Beauty & The Beast) playing a Asian mob-gangster (who is somewhat interesting) and a fairly funny scientist/mathematician played by Burn Gorman (Torchwood, The Dark Knight Rises) who does a great job at frustration and being over-the-top controlling as well as an American nerd with the right ideas but the lack of common sense know-how played by Charlie Day (Horrible Bosses, Monster's University).

The leads were, as always, pretty to look at but lacked any real depth in their characters. Charlie Hunnam (Children of Men, Sons of Anarchy), Diego Klattenhoff (After Earth, Mean Girls) play the separated brothers, Idris Elba (Thor, Promethius) plays the typical  military leader with issues and Rinko Kikuchi (The Brothers Bloom, Skycrawlers) plays the woman with a secret who's ambitions are subdued by her cultural beliefs.

I was so bored with this movie. Please wait for it to come on network TV where they'll hopefully cut out an hour (or two) for commercials. It might be more enjoyable then!",1375228800,20,2657,4.9707207207207205
5390897,4,B00A6UHC0U,"""Today we are canceling the apocalypse"".  One of the many one liners this film had. I enjoyed this, and I knew I would.  The trailers showcased robots fighting monsters and b then three films came to mind. Godzilla, Real Steel, and Transformers. And it does actually resemble all of those. I read a few reviews for the film and was sold, as they were all mostly positive reviews so I went and saw this. I mostly enjoyed this for all its worth but I still had issues which I'll share with you know; the problems were the plot, character development, and Ron Pearlman.  The main issue with this film is the plot. The plot is nothing really. Just a mix bag of fights, and talking about fighting.  No plot. It irritated me, because I just didn't get it. I didn't get the plot at all. Theirs monsters all over the world and now only for robot things to fight them somehow. There's a scientist who goes inside a monsters brain and  then has to hide as they search for him, the monsters that is, and bla bla bla,  Ron Pearlman cameo, bla bla, Robot vs. Monster fight again, bla bla the end. Yep that's the entire plot.  No, plot at all only fights. It's pretty sad and well uh.  The character development is very poor as well. Charlie Day's character is as far as we know a scientist, who likes the monsters, and Idris Elba was a monster fighting robot operator but stopped after getting a never ending nose bleed, and Ron Pearlman is a black market  monster parts guy?  Plus we get a lead actor who all we know is that he lost his basically twin brother in a fight with the monsters. How did he get drafted into the monster fighting robot men guys group? How? Did he have a love interest?  We don't know anything. My final issues are with Ron Pearlman.  Ron Pearlman who I think was excellent as Hellboy in Hellboy 1 and 2, but this time he just feels un-necessary in the film and very much annoying.  Ron Pearlman's character didn't need to be in this film, and neither did Ron Pearlman. Ron's acting is horrible, and I hated everything about his character, I hated his screen time with Charlie Day who I did enjoy. I hated his character all together. The good things with this film include the acting, cast, animation, visual effects, music, lighting, attention to details, and entertainment value.  The acting is just fine for me. This might be considered debatable, as I have heard that's some people found the acting  average, as did my father who attended the screening with me thought.""The Chinese girl's acting was terrible"" my father said, which I don't agree with, because he acting for me was excellent scents she was foreign, and I was able to understand her English, which is good.  Her acting was good and so was Charlie Hunnam, whose acting has been poorly received but I found it great.  The major cast members include Charlie Day and Idris Elba. I love Charlie Day. I always have loved his acting. It's excellent. This film is serious most of the time so Charlie provides us with the comical relief we need. His voice work in Monsters University earned him praise from me and his acting in this is earning him praise from me.  He's one of my current favorite actors, for his acting ability. He could play a realistic version of a scientist as well surprisingly.  Idris Elba is also a powerful cast member. I viewed him in June 2012's ""Prometheus"" and loved his realistic portrayed of a captain of a group. Idris Elba was excellent as the lead of a resistance against the monsters. He's an excellent actor and portrays the character realistically.  The animation for the robots and  monsters are excellently done. It's all beautifully  rendered and very sharp and realistic to the point I just loved it. The water was rendered beautifully realistically and everything was just perfect animation wise. The visuals are the same word as animation and it was perfectly done. The music was engaging and very fit in the scenes they were in.  The fight sequences with the monsters and the robots had perfect musical scores. They were engaging and original, and very load too.  Now another controversial  thing with this film is the lighting, which people found poor and too dark to see the fights and that. I have to disagree. I saw the fights excellently with the street of china filled with glowing colors and the monsters mouths filled with blue lighting. It's impossible not to see what's going on, because everything that's happening is filled with lights.  It was beautiful. This film has loads of details in the film. The animators and staff detailed everything from the water to the teeth of the monsters and the hands of the robots.  Everything is well detailed and just so realistic to look at its amazing.  This film is very much entertaining to watch.  The fights are well staged and exciting till the end of each one, the lights are colorful and entertaining to look at, and the leads keep your attention from start to finish. You could spend ten minutes just looking at a scene featuring the robots, it's just so cool and amazing to look at, and so dang realistic looking.  This is the film for fan boys and  young teens and boys.  Now as for the entertainment values for women I have none. Women and girls will most likely not enjoy watching this film, but men and teenage boys will. This is like what every boy dreams of. It's got everything to entertain the minds of kids for 2 hours.  This is the movie to  let the kids watch for 2 hours while you have some down time to yourself, it will keep their attention I will say that.  All an All this is a film with no plot at all but is so entertaining and fun and cool to look at that you really don't care all you want is more fights, cause of the excellent visuals.

5390909,5,B00A6UHC0U,"(Note: I will eventually update this with a Blu-ray review when I get around to it, someday).

I had the absolute pleasure of watching ""Pacific Rim a couple of days ago in IMAX 3D. I'd actually been listening to the soundtrack a couple of weeks straight prior to, as I had done with ""Star Trek: Into Darkness,"" since I'm a big enough nerd to really appreciate the unsung hero of a film: its music. And just as it did for Trek, the score by itself was enough to get me hyped up and excited for what I was sure to be another personal all-time favorite.

That being said, PacRim is one-of-a-kind. When I saw Michael Bay's ""Transformers,"" I was amazed at the craftsmanship that went into the design, execution, and scale of the giant robots. Well, with all due respect to Bay and his crew, he's just been outdone by Guillermo Del Toro and *his* crew.

The plot of PacRim is a pretty simple one: kaiju (literally Japanese for ""monster"" a la Godzilla and that whole monster-movie genre) are attacking humanity. To counter the threat of kaiju, humanity built these equally gigantic two-pilot robots called Jaegers. But when the stupid unified government decides to abandon the Jaeger program, the kaiju threat becomes increasingly greater with only a dwindling number of active Jaegers left to stop them.

Now as an anime fan, I'm pretty sure I've seen all or bits of these plot elements scattered throughout many an incarnation of live-action or animated Japanese media. As I mentioned, the kaiju self-reference to Godzilla should be an obvious influence in itself. And sure, the giant robot (aka ""mech"") thing was already achieved in Transformers.

However, the big differences to me between PacRim and Transformers is: 1) the sheer scale and size of the kaiju and Jaegers (which I'd estimate to be 3-4 times bigger than Optimus Prime); 2) the magnitude of the fight (two human pilots inside the Jaeger battling a giant monster, as opposed to a bunch of humans watching sentient robots fight each other); and 3) the very clear-cut style of reference to Japanese cinema (and yes, by ""cinema"" I also mean anime, 'cause I consider it genuine medium of art).

From the creature/robot design to the fight coordination and even to the common anime-esque character archetypes, this is the, by far, one of the coolest things I've ever seen made into live-action. And I'm so glad my first viewing was in IMAX 3D. Seeing such huge monsters and robots on a such a big screen in 3D only made the space depth *that* more gargantuan.

I highly, *highly* recommend this for anime fans (especially if you like mech titles). And while there aren't a lot of big names in terms actors or actresses or that ""deep"" of a plot (this ain't a psychological character study, so don't go expecting this to be a Christopher Nolan film or something), it's *so* finely crafted from a technical perspective (visually and musically) that I'm sure most anyone can at least appreciate it as the escapist spectacle that it is.

This is easily my favorite film of the year, so far. So go see it, preferably in IMAX 3D, or at least Real 3D.",1374883200,21,3098,4.7134935304990755
5390910,4,B00A6UHC0U,"If you're looking for Citizen Kane you've come to the wrong cinema.  There isn't a lot cutting edge about Pacific Rim but there are a few things lacking from many other recent action films on show here.  One: A sense of fun and Two: Well rendered fight scenes that don't outstay their welcome.  Three:  Likeable characters. In other words its a successful example of its genre where bigger names have fallen flat.

I was one of the many disappointed by Bay's Transformers so I was not the most likely candidate to find delight here but delight I found.  It's good old-fashioned fun and, okay, I'm Australian and it just didn't hurt that the fastest and most powerful jaeger was Australian.  We don't get to have a lot of national pride in international films and I'll take it.  I didn't even care that the accents were dodgy.  The Aussie spirit was and on song.  I felt like a kid again, bouncing in my seat.

I mean Jaegers are cool!  The characters were likeable.  The female lead wasn't just there as eye candy.  The fights were epic to watch and well-rendered.  The side characters were amusing and endearing.  The cast clearly had fun.  There were laughs and there was emotion in a balance I found satisfying.  There may be a few mcgiffins and plot holes but I didn't care a bit.  I was having too good a time.  That's what the film sets out to be and it delivers.  It's not trying to redefine it's genre but it ticks all the boxes this kind of film should tick (More than a lot of action films do, that's for sure).

I would have loved to see more of the other crews (I loved the little bit we got of the Russians and their jaeger was beautiful in its ugliness) though even with a longish running time the pace was rocketing and I guess there wasn't room. I would love to see an extended edition!

Any film I come out of buzzing is worth the price of admission to me and I left Pacific Rim on a high.

This movie is better than the Avengers, I'm comparing the two because they are both the definition of summer movies but the avengers just had way to much snarky comebacks and douche witty comments, the avengers was too saturated with iron man's attitude that everyone in the entire movie had a snarky comment to say.

5390912,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim, the latest film from visionary director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy films, plunges us into a world where giant creatures known as the Kaiju have emerged from a portal beneath the Pacific Ocean we deem ""The Breach."" When jets, tanks and bombs don't do the job, the major nations of the world come together to create the Jaeger Program; giant mechs controlled by two pilots over a neural bridge called The Drift, where two minds come together as one, sharing memories and emotions. The Jaegers seem to get the job done, keeping cities and countries safe, but everything changes when the Kaiju begin to learn our defenses, and the Jaegers begin to fall. Soon, the apocalypse begins, and only a few Jaegers stand against the tide.

Pacific Rim is one of the best science fiction films I have ever seen, having the fun, clichd blockbuster side of Independence Day, and the expert directing, flawless visuals and good acting of a purely well-made film. Is this a Best Picture winning film? No, but by all means, it is an instant SF-Action classic. The battles between Jaegers and the Kaiju always progress, becoming harder and more challenging, the characters do develop, even the minor ones (Hannibal Chou, the pilots of Striker Eureka, and the scientist duo), and the emotion is real. Del Toro proves here that he is capable of turning a mindless blockbuster hit into a work of art. I don't want to spoil much about this movie, but I must say, the Kaiju are some of the most amazing and creative creatures in all of cinema. Del Toro truly put all his heart into the movie, and it showed itself.

There is so much to this story that many questions are raised and left unanswered, but most of them can be through sequels. Cancelling the apocalypse is not the end. This movie is not for everyone, being pure science fiction and has loads of action throughout, but it is very well-made, even with the cheesy moments (momentum can be funny, to those who've seen it)

To be sure, there's a childlike fascination that runs through his work and connects to that same vibration within the viewer. Unfortunately that child must have been thrilled beyond comprehension with watching ""Godzilla"" and that same adolescent went on to make a movie about it. Big things that kids can control have been a staple of childhood since tin soldiers. Here's a movie that you've seen before (called 'Transformers"") beating up on flesh and goo monsters from under the sea from another movie you've seen on late night.

The bad:

The fights were sometimes hard to follow due to the darkness and close-up shots. Since many reviews said this was a highlight, it was disappointing. And the fights don't always make sense, contrary to reviews that said they do.

Sure, blame the dinosaurs. We always get the blame.

The hero is somewhat bland.

Some of it just doesn't make sense. Why does one Jaeger have escape pods and the other not?

The ""scientist geek"" characters are way too screechy and irritating. I'm not sure I could take another viewing unless I fast-forwarded all their scenes.

The Jaegers have to be transported by helicopter? Really? Seems slower to deploy than letting them get there on their own steam.

The good:

The kaiju are scary due to their design.

Fun with Ron Perlman.

Some interesting character backstory and interaction, although nothing terribly original. A couple of interesting twists regarding mind-melding with monsters.

5390928,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I've seen Pacific Rim twice now, just to make sure, and, yes, this movie is destined to be a classic in the sci-fi/action genre.  It's not perfect, but there is so much love, passion, exuberance and fun packed into every moment of the film, that any and all minor nitpicks are forgotten, in favor of the sheer joy of watching it.  This film is a love letter to Japanese monster cinema, but you don't have to be a fan of that genre to appreciate the spectacle that Del Toro presents here.  The CGI is stunning, each shot brilliantly composed.  The editing and flow is smooth and perfect, not jumpy and cutty.  Important moments and action is allowed to breathe.  Shots are as long as you want them to be-- long enough to fully absorb what you are seeing.  And there are terrific little moments of subtle and not so subtle comedy.  The performances are all solid and respectable, the story and dialog is crisp and tight and serves the overall purpose to establish this world-in-peril and get us into the action.  Some of my friends didn't like some of the sub-plots, especially, what seems like a pretty stereotypical conflict between two of the Jaeger pilots.  I agreed to an extent, but I think Del Toro is just trying to shoe-horn in a little character arc here and there, and the nasty pilot's resolve was stronger for having seen him at his worst.  There are a NUMBER of dumb little elements to nitpick:  How do a handful of helicopters carry the massive Jaegers?  How did this Jaeger technology come into being in so near a future?  To all of this I simply say that if you go into this film ready, willing and able to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride, you will be richly rewarded with an almost transcendent film experience.  Del Toro isn't promising anything other than a rocking, good time, and he DELIVERS exactly that-- in spades.  We've forgiven far worse transgressions of belief and plausibility in the many other films we've canonized as sci-fi classics: from planet-busting battle stations to head-melting golden boxes to an entire world powered by the body heat of enslaved humans.  Pacific Rim breaks the laws of reality in no worse way than these classics, and does it all with the same sense of fun and adventure.

5390931,4,B00A6UHC0U,"In the year 2020, a dimensional portal opens up in the Pacific Ocean, and our world is besieged by giant monsters called Kaiju (Japanese for `strange creature'). In response, humanity created large robots called Jaegars (German for `hunter') to fight these creatures. Unfortunately, the Kaiju are winning, and it's up to a washed-up former pilot and a rookie to save humanity from being annihilated. Pacific Rim is the brainchild of Guillermo Del Toro, visionary director of such visually striking films as Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth. Pacific Rim isn't a remake or a movie `based on anything' (aside from Del Toro's love of old-school monster movies), which is refreshing considering Hollywood's nauseating obsession with sequels, remakes, and superhero comic adaptions.

First, and foremost, the CGI in Pacific Rim is some of the best you will ever see. The Jaegars and Kaiju look awesome, especially when they are beating the tar out of each other (and destroy cities in the process). It is definitely worth the 3D upcharge. Del Toro's film also features a well-developed and colorful cast that keeps the film from being `all-style no-substance', like similar big-budget action films like Transformers and Battleship. A noteworthy performance comes from Dr. Newton Geiszler (played by Charlie Day of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia fame), a very enthusiastic and easily-excitable scientist that provides some big laughs and crucial insight into the Kaiju and how to defeat them. Ron Perlman has a memorable, but brief role as the Black Market Kaiju organ dealer Hannibal Chou (whose name comes from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Chinese restaurant). Details like how the robots operate, where the monsters come from and some of their biological facts (often provided animatedly by the aforementioned Doctor) are not only clever, but they give the world a certain degree of plausibility, another feature often absent from similar films. There is also a quick scene mid-credits which is worth sticking around for.

Pacific Rim is not without flaws, though. At points, the dialogue was hard to hear, although this may have been the theater's fault. A few moments in the film will cause viewers to think ""Why didn't they just do that before?"" For example: towards the end of the second act, the Jaegar piloted by the two main heroes suddenly unveils a blade attachment that can slice a Kaiju with ease, clearly more effective than punching and throwing said beast for 10 minutes (though admittedly less exciting). The fight scenes in the second act are so thrilling and over-the-top that the third act feels short and weak in comparison. While the cast is strong and there are surprisingly few clich/cheesy lines, the rookie and the washed-up pilot (the two main heroes) are not as well-developed as some of the other characters. All of the battle scenes are a treat to watch, but they take place either in the pouring rain or underwater. This doesn't deter from the enjoyment of the film, but to watch the two opposing forces duke it out on a sunny day (or even a cloudy one) would've be nice, so we could see them more clearly.

The good far outweighs the bad when it comes to Pacific Rim, and you probably won't ever see a more fun or intelligent monster movie. 7/10",1374710400,8,3295,5.020109689213894

But it exemplifies everything a big summer movie should be: great action scenes, naturally, but also fun characters, teamwork, an easy-to-follow but still gripping plot, and a sense of high stakes. In short, it's a fun time.

The characters cover plenty of different countries -- America, England, Japan, Australia, and Russia have all contributed characters to the international robotic struggle against the attacks of giant dimension-hopping monsters from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The comedic relief characters are refreshingly integral to the plot: two mad scientists who bicker with each other while figuring out how to stop the monsters for good. Ron Pearlman plays a great bit as a snappy-dressing Tokyo drug kingpin, too. The characters aren't fleshed out strongly, as there's too much monster-punching to get to, but what is shown isn't cliche. The film's plot takes an inspirational Independence-Day-style approach, as everyone bonds together in patriotism for their planet, bolstered by a rousing soundtrack.

The plot expands beyond just an endless stream of monsters, allowing the film to build to a climax beyond just the typical monster flick's bigger and badder fight -- although the climax is also bigger and badder on top of that. It doesn't happen on the top of the Empire State building, but I'm sure they're just saving that for the sequel.

The drama is high: since it's an ensemble cast, there's a higher danger that main characters can die, and a remarkable amount do. The apocalypse is nearing, too, and since they've been at war for a decade before the film starts, the possibility that humanity might be wiped out seems real, too. It's this drama, combined with the fun of all-out, fresh, non-cynical robot-on-monster battles, that makes Pacific Rim my favorite film of the year.",1374537600,5,1978,5.061349693251533

You won't find any silly fart jokes here. The female characters are competent heroic characters, not air-headed barely clothed trollops.

Pacific Rim belongs solidly to the latter camp, but it's a labor of love and is missing none of the flair that makes del Toro films so special. At its core it is essentially a Western Super Sentai film; heroes suit up in giant robots to battle monsters that are invading our dimension... And that's it. You can foist all sorts of allegory onto this movie if you want, and you can plumb it for deeper meaning- it's rich enough- but at the end of the day it's a thrilling adventure about friendship, big robots, and monster punching. Wet blankets need not apply.

Short summary: a portal to an alien world opens under the ocean and giant monsters come out. The governments of the world team up to battle them, eventually doing so with Jaegers, huge robots piloted by two psychically linked pilots who must act in tandem to control their war machines. For a while this goes swimmingly, but the money dries up and the monsters keep coming, and soon the fate of the world rests on crusty and intensely likeable Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) who runs the world's last 4 jaegers in an endless war against the monsters out of Hong Kong. Pentacost has a plan to destroy the portal that brings the monsters to earth but to do that he recruits emotionally scarred Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) who must copilot with the impetuous and vengeful Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) for one last big mission. Cue a ton of fighting and explosions.

This film showcases a lot of newcomer actors to great effect. The burgeoning friendship between Mori and Becket is particularly well done (it is best described as a guy-girl bromance really) and the rest of the cast does science, runs from monsters, or is Ron Perlman (yes that's a role now) very effectively. Idris Elba gets to play to his strengths very well here and chew a lot of scenery as an AGING HERO with SAD SECRETS, and lest you think that del Toro will craft a strong black lead then stick him in an office like every other director, rest assured that Pentacost punches monsters in a big robot too.

Of course the fights are the meat of the film and they do not disappoint. The robots and monsters convey a powerful sense of size and weight, as their enormous fists, tails, and jaws gnash and hit with weight and authority. Fights are almost wholly digital affairs and perhaps to save money they are usually in rainy darkness, but they are still exciting and tense. The multi-stage throwdown in Hong Kong at the film's peak is one of the best giant monster battles ever committed to film and I say that as a die-hard Godzilla fan.

Some critics have panned this film for a lack of depth, but the truth is that it does what it wants to- deliver a summer blockbuster- and it does so with unprecedented depth. Its writing, performances, and effects easily put it on par with The Avengers as a smart summer action romp, and to disrespect this film because it's not another Pan's Labyrinth is sort of like saying a really good ice cream sundae is undeserving of your time because it's not a baked Alaska. Lest we overlook it too, Rim is also an ORIGINAL film in an industry plagued by remakes, sequels, and general unoriginality. You don't have to buy it (although I would) but you should absolutely see it in theaters or rent it at least once. Don't miss out.

PROS
-Endearing performances from a young cast (with help from some veterans)
-Way, way better than Cloverfield
-Blends Artsy del Toro's flair for eerie creatures and dream imagery with comic geek del Toro's love of SMASH POW BAM
-Effective ear bug soundtrack will stick with you
-Really good 3D if that's your thing

CONS
-Some of the other Jaeger crews are not very well developed
-The very beginning crams a lot of exposition in pretty fast

UPDATE 10/21/2013

So I received and watched the disk. The standard version of Rim comes in a handsome slipcase with a fun holographic cover that APPEARS to be removable (although a true collector won't want to of course...). The BD itself is easily navigable and all trailers are skippable. There is a whole other disk of special features which I have not yet watched. Overall this feels very premium, more like a collector's edition than a basic retail set. The case doesn't even have cutouts to save material as many BD cases do nowadays.

Picture quality is outstanding overall. On the small screen, and without the slight softening effect of 3D, this actually reveals some sort of cheap-looking CGI in the first Kaiju encounter during the opening narration*. Thankfully, subsequent battles look great. The movie is free from excessive cleanup and boasts the odd bit of grain, making it look very filmic and natural, even when big monsters and big robots are clubbing one another with bits of dockyard.

Audio is suitably bombastic and rich, with voices, music, and effects all mixed to a consistent, listenable volume range (I'm looking at you, first two Iron Man films on home video).

Overall this is a great Blu Ray and watching it at home the film held up to my initial high opinion.

* This is probably because much of this sequence was produced long before editing of the remainder of the film was completed.",1374537600,806,5361,4.6553911205073994
5390943,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim is quite possibly the heaviest hitting summer blockbuster this year (by a good several thousand tons, to be precise). It's led by Guillermo del Toro, bringing together a somewhat lopsided cast with a promising story and a premise that's been proven since 1954.

The film starts off with a bang, setting up the story of the big, evil monsters (called Kaiju, a Japanese word meaning ""Giant Beast""), and the big, good robots (called Jaegers, a German word meaning ""Hunter"") within the first few seconds a la green, dot matrix text. Raleigh sets up the story, explains the Jaegers and their dual-pilot system over the next few minutes. The film does a good job of keeping its pace fast without losing the audience in unnecessary plot sinks or Jaeger jargon.

Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy) plays the lead role of Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot who lost his brother in the Kaiju War, damaged goods that finds himself two steps shy of Jake Sully from Avatar. Yet piloting half of Gipsy Danger and fighting on behalf of his copilot (played by Asian film star Rinko Kikuchi), Hunnam shines, and makes the rest of the cast look good while doing it. Rival Jaeger pilot Chuck Hansen (played by the British soap star Robert Kazinsky) does an excellent job of being a perfect ass when he needs to be. Del Toro adds in Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as two rival scientists with vastly different theories for dealing with the Kaiju problem (for comic releif and an action packed side story) and Ron Pearlman as a black market mastermind. Also making a special cameo, Ellen McLain provides her electronic voice for GLaDOS... I mean, the Jaeger AI.

Pacific Rim's faults are minor, and might have kept it from being a hit any other year. However, with the stale competition in theaters coming from R.I.P.D., it remains the only mid-summer film worth watching.",1374451200,5,1854,4.769470404984424
5390954,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I saw the movie last night and was blown away.  I truly look forward to owning this on Blu-ray and re-experiencing it as best possible in my home (7.1 SS / 73"" DLP).  As a 40-something, I recall the different creature features of the 60's and 70's (Godzilla vs. ...), shows in syndication like Ultraman and even cartoon(ish) shows like Voltron (Ro-Beasts, anyone?) and even (sigh) Power Rangers.  This movie goes beyond all of that, engaging the best aspects of each of the aforementioned and innovates of its own.  This is more than a slugfest of skyscraper sized creations.  It is a survival story of humanity and the human condition, very well presented by Guillermo Del Toro.  For some, the deeper thematics may not appeal.  Others might not buy into the fantastic reality this movie takes place in.  For me, I went in with no expectations and enjoyed it much more than Star Trek Into Darkness (don't screw up Star Wars J.J. Abrams) and Iron Man 3 (miss you Jon Favreau), both of which left me disappointed.

I certainly hope this gets a proper treatment in terms of its release as a video (DVD/BD/UV) and is full of special/extra content.  I plan to update this once the release is made.

Happy viewing!",1374451200,4,1208,4.650943396226415
5390955,2,B00A6UHC0U,"America has not had much success with giant monster movies.  ""King Kong"" is probably our proudest achievement, but it's not really a monster movie in the same vein of the ""Godzilla"" and ""Gamera"" series. The biggest difference is that the genre involves two behemoths battling it out -- so while ""Cloverfield"" demonstrated that a giant monster could be terrifying, it wasn't a legitimate entry into the giant monster genre. Guillermo Del Toro decided to fix that with ""Pacific Rim.""

Giant robot battles have been gracing the screen since the ""Transformers"" franchise launched, so it was just a matter of time before someone threw monsters in the mix.  And that's exactly what we get, several arena battles between Jaegers (a name for giant robots that first debuted in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heavy-Gear-role-playing-game/dp/1896776329/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heavy Gear role-playing game</a>) and Kaiju (the traditional Japanese name for giant monsters).  Awesome, right?

Well, yes, if you just want to see impractically-designed and operated giant robots fight blurry monsters in the water.  The battles -- when it occasionally hits land -- is epic.  While it doesn't have quite the same heft of the destruction in ""Man of Steel,"" Kaiju fans will finally get what we've all been waiting for...CGI conflicts between titans that looks awesome on screen.

But it's not as fantastic as it could be. The more interesting Jaeger designs are never used to their full potential; what you see in the trailer is pretty much all of it.  The Kaiju are almost impossible to distinguish because they're all gray in the rain, in the ocean, and underwater. Given that the Kaiju come from an interdimensional rift, they seem impractically designed to survive underwater. The Jaegers are no better.  It occurs to exactly nobody that maybe they should design a killer submarine to take on the monsters underwater...in fact, there's not even the slightest hint of any naval military capability whatsoever.

SPOILER RIM: And who needs them anyway when you have giant robots? Earth's united forces decide, at what can only be described as a plot gimmick, to just give up on the Jaeger program.  Why?  I was expecting some kind of accidental murder of a bajllion civilians like what we witnessed in ""Man of Steel,"" but instead we get...politics and economics.  Or to put it another way, the same military industrial complex that builds the Jaegers and has success killing them has its funding yanked in favor of a wall that demonstrably doesn't work. Not a single country on our fractious planet dissents.

But let's put aside all of that for the moment and focus on the plot. Jaegers are piloted by another staple of the genre, a mind-meld that requires two pilots working in sync known as ""the drift."" It's a pretty cool idea and fun to see on screen, as the two pilots experience each others' dreams and nightmares.  These teams are very close: brothers and sisters, fathers and sons, husbands and wives.  When Raleigh Becket's (Charlie Hunnam) brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) dies during combat, they're still connected and the experience scars Raleigh for life...until he is inevitably lured back into the program as part of a last ditch effort to stop the Kaiju army once and for all before the Jaeger program is cancelled and humanity gives up and dies.

But who will be his copilot? Pretty Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) is obviously the perfect match -- she's smart, athletic, and capable of keeping up with Raleigh.  And yet leader of the program Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) refuses to let her participate.  When Stacker finally does relent, I was looking forward to Mako kicking some ass and taking names.

Instead, we get one of the most offensive female Japanese stereotypes in recent memory.  She pouts, she wells up in tears, and she is a huge liability to the team.  It's clear that women have no place in director Guillermo Del Toro's vision of a robot future that has more to do with brains than brawn -- the women's emotions will just get in the way.  There are several opportunities for Mako to rise above all this, but she never does.  Even though she's standing right beside Raleigh, the plot finds ways to make Mako helpless and ultimately, require rescue.  Sorry girls, you can be a master martial artist with an advanced degree and still not save the world.

Putting aside the casual disregard for women, the nonsensical plot that could easily have been fixed, and the attempts at humor that even Ron Perlman can't save, the movie hits a new low when an EMP disables some of the Jaegers and Raleigh Jaeger, the Gipsy Danger, is unaffected.  Why?

""They're digital.  The Gipsy Danger is analog.  Nuclear.""

I'm sorry, what?  Yes, electronics made in the 1950s were made to withstand the EMP of a nuclear attack and are thus more resistant.  Jaegers didn't exist then.  Even though the Gipsy Danger is ""atomic-powered,"" it has electronics.  And the Kaiiju who fired the EMP apparently knows this, because it never bothers to try its pulse again.  It's a gaping plot hole in a sloppy script that could easily be rectified with a few tweaks.

But the robot battles are fun.",1374451200,5,5232,5.012731481481482
5390956,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim:

We have here a film that took my breath away. Awe inspiring. Those type of comments are typical of summer films, but I can assure you, this time, every word is earned. Without spoiling anything not shown in the trailers, we have a world (created with fantastic ease and nuance by director Guillermo Del Toro) that is under seige by massive, dimensional beasts refered to as Kaiju. The human race, up against the ropes, creates the ultimate weapon: the jaegers, massive, mechanical robots to beat the beasts back into their abyss. That's a very short summary, but the general story of the film is there. This film, from begining to end, is a gonzo spectale of epic proportions. The humans battle back against these skyscraper type beasts, massive hits that, as the viewers, we feel. Blue blood and acid sprays from the creatures with every hit, as the Kaiju rips and tear the Jaegers apart. We watch battle after battle against the Kaiju and the jaegers, and this is the best part of the film bar none. I spent more than a majority of the film bouncing in my seat, hanging on edge as these massive beings battle. You feel a naive sense of wonderment, and that is the film's triumph. Once again, awe inspiring. If the fights are the strongest part, then the characters are probably the weakest. Not that they are bad, the performances are strong, but the fights sometimes go over the development of our love story. But, likeable, if simple characters, are still good enough to like, and help you root for them as they pilot the jaegers, and watch from the side lines. One final note, the score of the film works well, and adds to the sense of doom and triumph throughout. I will be buying the soundtrack.

Pros:
The fights are AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING. The pinnacle of summer film spectacle.
The designs of the Kaiju's are amazing, with Del Toro's touch evident.
Decent performances.
Great score

Cons:
Cliche dialouge.
Weak character development.

I give Pacific Rim 4 out of 5 stars.

5390957,4,B00A6UHC0U,"***This review may contain spoilers***

  Even to this day, Toho's demented giant creature features and Devlin/Emmerlich's 1998 ""Godzilla"" remake have their defenders (and I am among them to a limited degree).  No doubt the monsters were often rubbery and freaky fakes with their wires showing and the (usually) Japanese protagonists were overwrought hams with often bizarrely-dubbed English dialogues and slow, boring personal dramas. Or, the monster may have looked, sounded, and acted convincingly and frighteningly but not given a hell of a lot to do (yes, you, 1998 Godzilla).  Nevertheless, these campy epics could be certainly watchable, diverting, and even suspenseful.  Yet, every so often, even champions of these ""kaiju"" (Japanese for ""monster"") flicks, and I, must have wished that these flicks could get a sophisticated big-budget CGI blockbuster treatment and still remain faithful to their roots.  To a triumphant degree, ""Pacific Rim"" (hereafter PR) has answered our prayers.

  As it should be, the premise is simple and direct.  As PR's prologue explains, for millennia, seemingly countless sky-towering kaiju kept emerging from a fissure or portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and ravaged the earth for food and resources.  Fortunately, mankind discovered that heavy nuclear weaponry could repel and destroy these bizarre beasts - at first.  However, more adaptable and invulnerable Kaiju emerged from the ocean floor.  As a desperate last defense, mankind (through the Pan Pacific Defense Corps or PPDC) constructed skyscraper-sized robots called Jaegers (German for ""Hunters"") to combat the Kaiju.

  These robots are not sentient.  Indeed, because of their colossal size, Jaegers require two pilots, each representing the left and right hemispheres of the brain, to operate the left and right sides of the robot body - like a combination of virtual reality and remote control.  To make sure the Jaeger functions fluidly (and not like a schizophrenic drunk), the two pilots must establish a neural link (called the drift) that permits telepathic communication and sharing of ideas and memories.  The only drawback to the drift is that the pilots may share traumatic memories that inhibit their performance and jeopardize the mission.

  Among the best of the Jaegar pilots is gung-ho, cocky, but appealing Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff).  The best, until an abortive Kaiju mission where the brothers failed to make sure the Kaiju stayed defeated flings Charlie's brother to his death.  Understandably having lost his confidence, Raleigh resignedly takes a job as an engineer working to construct towering coastal barriers in an attempt to contain the Kaiju after various Jaegar failures shelve the program.  However, after the barriers prove ineffective, PPDC commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba, a dependable actor redeeming himself after his underwritten role in ""Prometheus"") recruits Raleigh to give the Jaegers (namely Gypsy Danger) another go.  Besides the shocking memories of his brother's death, another obstacle to Raleigh's getting back in the saddle is finding a ""neurally compatible"" pilot.  Athletic, nimble, and martial-arts savvy Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) seems to be the ideal candidate.

  However, during the ""maiden launch"" of the Gypsy Danger, Mako's painful memory of a catastrophic Kaiju city attack that killed her family while she was a very young girl disrupts the proceedings and almost destroys the military facility.  As a result, Pentecost detains Raleigh and Mako and sends the impressively capable father/son Jaeger pilot team of Herc and Chuck Hanson (Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky) plus a couple of auxiliary robots (including one with four arms).  Chafing under their grounding and the taunting disregard of Chuck, Raleigh and Mako can only watch as the ""digital"" Jaegars are immobilized and crushed by Predator-like and bat-like Kaiju, which then advance upon a helpless Hong Kong.  Just in time, Stacker grudgingly deploys Raleigh and Mako, who get their act together and in a titanic battle stop both Kaiju.

  Meanwhile, one half of an accomplished but risibly cranky and contentious scientific duo, the loudly arrogant and bespectacled Dr. Newton (Newt) Geiszler (Charlie Day) examines cerebral tissue obtained from Kaiju corpses, including the one left in Hong Kong plus its fetus (!), and from a shady, potentially lethal ""Kaiju body parts"" black marketer Hannibal Chau.  Dr. Geiszler finds he can create his own neural link with the beasts and gradually learn more about them.  Of course this two-way reciprocal link means the Kaiju can read and pinpoint Dr. Geiszler's mind, which imperiled the Hong Kong bunker where Geiszler hid with some of the population.  With the help of the peevishly skeptical Dr. Herman Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) this all leads to a possible solution to the Kaiju problem: if the Jaegers can infiltrate the Kaiju portal and destroy it from within, no more monsters can pour out.  Can the Jaegers -named Gypsy Danger- do it, and can its pilots Raleigh and Mako get out alive?

  I found PR to be a satisfying but not mind-numbing adrenaline rush, with well-paced but exhilarating human, robot and monster action.  Especially during the Hong Kong sequence, the monster/robot pummelings and attacks were literally earth-shaking and engrossing and especially loud.  And yet, in quieter moments, PR took the time to develop character motivations and interactions, even if you've seen them a million times before, and to make them affecting and achingly real.  Mako's memory of her encounter with a Kaiju was especially shocking, sad, and eerily reminiscent of 9/11. Raleigh was appropriately committed, supportive, and loyal, especially to his partner but (refreshingly) not lover Mako, and strangely both loyal to and defiant of Stacker.  Stacker demonstrated both leadership toughness and (almost overprotective) paternal care towards an unexpected adoptive daughter, and can certainly deliver an inspirational fight speech.  And oh, yes, the scientists did manage to be funny despite occasional abrasiveness.  PR serves as a high-tech homage to Toho, Godzilla (including his roar), and even sci-fi films such as ""Independence Day"" and references them heavily, but always with style and intelligence and rip-roaring action.  I look forward to buying the DVD.

P.S.: I am dismayed to learn that PR is turning out to be a flop in the States.  Initially, I was baffled by this, then I pondered a few possible reasons why: 1) Although there are protagonists in the movie, primarily Raleigh and Mako, I guess they weren't featured often or prominently enough for some people; 2) Almost all of the monster/robot fight scenes were filmed at night, perhaps to conceal some perceived CGI flaws; 3) Admittedly it was sometimes difficult to differentiate the fighting combatants because of some quick, close-up editings, 4) I believe some people have a xenophobic and foreign bias against seemingly ""non-American"" movies, and 5) ""Kaiju"" movies may have mainly an esoteric or devoted cult status.  Oh well, that is their concern.  As retribution, I hope PR cleans up overseas, and particularly breaks box-office records in Japan.

P.P.S.: I've heard that a 2014 Godzilla remake is in the works.  For it to succeed, I highly recommend it have the lines ""He's unstoppable."" and/or ""All our weapons are useless against him.""",1374451200,2,7449,5.367786391042205
5390958,1,B00A6UHC0U,"In brief: Every bit as retarded as the trailers made it seem.

I didn't have a burning desire to see this film, though I will admit that I harbored some curiosity about it, given the impressive-looking spectacle of special effects indicated in the trailers, and a statement by one person on the Web who said it was ""awesome"". The fact that Guillermo del Toro directed it was certainly a plus, though ultimately, it boiled down to the fact that by the time my friend and I got together on the night in question, it was the most appealing choice with a time showing left at the theater, as we were too late to see anything else.

As it turns out, the film's entire content, much as I inferred from the trailers, can be boiled down to five words:

  ""Giant Robots Versus Giant Monsters.""

That's it.

When I say the ""the film's entire content"", mind you, I'm not being capricious with my words. That's all the film is about. What I mean by this is that while good stories may attract viewers with a flashy surface, they usually contain some substance or heart beneath it. ""Spider-Man"", for example, is not about a guy who gains spider-powers and swings around New York. It's about a young man who learns what responsibility is. ""Star Wars"" isn't about lightsabers. It's a modern take on the classic hero's journey, it's about confronting our own dark nature, with some classic Greek drama thrown in. ""Aliens"" isn't about blowing aliens way, it's a parable mirroring the Vietnam War, with added themes of motherhood. ""The Big Lebowski"" is about the emasculation of men. With ""Pacific Rim"", however, there is no ""about"". Everything about the film that isn't giant robots pummeling giant monsters is just filler meant to justify that high-concept, one-line, gimmicky premise, one that could've been written on a napkin by del Toro while watching one of his kids smash two of his favorite toys together, which pretty much embodies the film's sensibility--assuming one can use the word ""sensibility"" when discussing this mindless excuse for a story. Mind you, being inspired by a gimmick, in and of itself, doesn't necessarily doom a story. The idea of taking several of Marvel Comics' premiere superheroes that star in their own solo stories, and having them cross over by coming together as a team, for example, is essentially a high-concept gimmick. But that doesn't mean a good storyteller can't tell a story with that premise with interesting characters who affect one another, whose actions affect the public, whose responses to the story's major threat aren't influenced by--and in turn influence--their personalities, and who can touch the audience on an emotional level. Some of the genre's most beloved franchises started out as stories that could essentially be described as high-concepts or gimmicks. But that's because in way or another, those franchises harbored ideas or qualities that managed to transcend their shorthand, capsulized descriptions.

""Pacific Rim"", however, harbors no such ideas at its non-existent heart. It does not feature characters of any meaningful depth or originality. Much as ""Man of Steel"" contrasts with the Richard Donner Superman films, we do not really get a sense that the characters really care about the people they're ostensibly protecting, let alone that the Jaegers prevent more property damage and loss of life than they cause. We get no sense of what motivates the characters, how their interactions change them on a fundamental level, or how they affect the public. The film simply takes a premise that's idiotic on its face, and pads it with scenes that are A. Cliched B. Uninteresting and therefore make the non-fighting scenes drag, and C. Make no sense.

Let's start with the idiotic premise.

When these giant kaiju first start coming out of the interdimensional portal at the bottom of the ocean known as the Breach, governments naturally throw fighter jets at them, which is what they *should* be doing. While it takes a considerable pounding before the jets manage to kill it----tens of thousands of lives are said to be lost in the process----the fact is, they do get the job done. But, the narrator tells us, humans needed a better weapon to fight them, and this is where the giant robots, called Jaegers (from the German word for ""hunter""), come in. It's also where the creators inform us that any semblance of intelligence is about to go right out the window, as the entire premise of the giant robots is apparently predicated on the following, ridiculous-yet-unspoken notion:

  Punching giant monsters is a better way to kill them than with bombs.

Think about that for a second. The humans can simply drop nukes on these monsters before they even reach the shore, or they can simply use the most powerful non-nuclear bombs in their arsenal (thermobaric bombs), which should incinerate the suckers. We already have bombers in our arsenal, which are pretty efficient, and since most of the kaiju are limited to the water or the ground (we only see one in the film's second act that can fly), the pilots are fairly safe. Hell, we're already using unmanned drone bombers today, so by the future time frame of this movie, pilots could essentially be moot, so their safety wouldn't be an issue.

But no.

Instead, they decide that robots the size of skyscrapers, which must take years to merely to design, let alone build (Idris Elba's character, Stacker, informs us that the first one was rushed out in 14 months) which punch the monsters in the face, and which require pilots with great martial arts skills, are a ""better weapon"" than such bombs, though its is never explained to us WHY. When you go bear hunting, you take a gun with you. You don't bone up on your kung fu. But we're just supposed to accept this, without question, simply in order to justify the shots of the giant robots doing judo flips with giant monsters. When we do see fighter jets taking on one of the monsters in a flashback sequence showing Mako as a little girl, they use their machine guns only. But when we see the Jaeger appear on the scene, the Jaeger punches the monster, and then opens up a chamber on its chest with six cannons that kill the beast with bombs. Again, I ask, why couldn't the fighter jets just fire those bombs themselves? Why does that initial ""punch"" by the robot help?

For that matter, why do Jaeger pilots need to connect their minds to the Jaeger, let alone each other? The Jaeger's movements are pretty much simple: Walk. Punch. And that's it. How complex are their movements that a simple virtual reality set up like what we have with modern-day video games and flight simulators isn't sufficient?

This wouldn't have been so bad if there were something under the Michael Bay-ish surface of this movie, but there isn't. What we do have are boilerplate genre clichs so beaten into the ground that they're dating Chris Brown. Let's see:

  *Ace hotshot traumatized by past tragedy must learn to put aside their fears to perform whatever extreme physical activity in which they excel in order to save the day: Check (Twice, actually, since both this applies to both Raleigh and Mako.)
  *A rival starts trouble with the main character hotshot, because he thinks he's dangerous/a loose cannon/whatever, but comes to eventually respect the hotshot: Check. This is such a shamelessly overused trope that the writers of both Top Gun and Team America should've gotten a royalty for this.
  *A black supporting character in a science fiction film ends up sacrificing himself. Check.

Aside from the brief martial arts fight between two humans, none of these scenes are engaging, and therefore, they have the effect of bringing the story to a screeching halt. Even on their own terms, much of it makes no sense. When we learn, for example, that the Jaeger program is being terminated within eight months, in favor of a coastal wall program, Del Toro and co-screenwriter Travis Beacham actually had the opportunity to make the stakes seem important, and give a sense of urgency to the proceedings. But instead, they establish rather early on that the coastal walls provide about as much protection from the kaiju as popsicle sticks. Putting aside the question of why the Powers That Be thought those walls would work (perhaps this is part of the kaiju's ""adaptability""?), doesn't doing this remove the threat of the Jaeger program's shutdown? And why is the status of the Jaeger program never clarified or updated after the coastal walls are revealed to be ineffective? And do del Toro and Beacham even KNOW what an electromagnetic pulse is? By what retarded rationale are electronic devices unaffected by EMPs simply because they're ""digital, not analog""??

The robot-monster fight scenes ARE impressive. The film should get Oscar nominations for visual effects and art direction for the monster designs alone. But these elements are impressive in the same way that fan films like ""Ryan v. Dorkman"" are impressive: Something that's interesting to watch for several minutes, but not something in which I'd want to invest over 2 hours of my time and ten dollars. As storytelling goes, ""Pacific Rim"" is just empty calories, like an entire meal of whipped cream. It falls into the same pantheon of films as ""The Core"", ""Transformers"" and the films of Roland Emmerich, a standard to which it is disappointing to see Guillermo del Toro aspiring.",1374451200,31,9394,4.895531780994336
5390959,3,B00A6UHC0U,"Visually, the movie was AMAZING! And, I'm sure, seeing it in one of the finest theaters (and 3D theaters) in the world didn't hurt it any. I mean, this movie is seriously impressive to look at, especially in 3D. There's a lot of holographic imaging involved in piloting the Jaegers (the giant robots), and it looks super cool in 3D since you're seeing it the way the characters are supposedly seeing it. It's certainly a movie that I'm glad I saw in the theater, because a television set just would not do justice to the Jaegers and the Kaijus (giant monsters) fighting amongst skyscrapers and, frequently, knocking them over.

So, in short, if you want to see a film with lots of action and fight scenes, especially involving giant combatants, this movie is for you. Seriously, I think it's safe to say that there will not be a better looking film this year.

And it leads off with it, too, as we start out right at the first Kaiju attack. The problem is that it's a prologue, and a prologue with voice over, at that. I really don't enjoy that kind of thing in movies. To compound the problem, it was the prologue to the prologue. Yes, the movie had to have two prologues. Just about the time I was allowing myself to get into the movie and be unannoyed by the prologue, we find out that what should have been the beginning of the movie was just another prologue. So, now, we're something like 20 minutes into the film, and the actual movie hasn't even started.

That issue with the storytelling ends up being the movie's greatest flaw. Basically, they started what was an epic tale spanning years and skipped to the last battle. There's no emotional connection to any of the characters, no foundation for the arbitrary scientific-sounding crap they fling at you in the same way that chimpanzees fling poo (and, yes, I have a story about that... for another day), and no logic to the things that happen. IF they had started at the beginning of the story or, at least, closer to it, they could have built something more believable. It's kind of too bad, because, like I said, visually amazing.

I'm not even going to get into the specific story issues. They are just too numerous to list. In fact, I'm sure I've forgotten most of them. Let's just say this movie is more hole than cheese (Swiss cheese, you know).  I'll sum it up this way: After the movie was over and my friends and I were comparing notes, so to speak, they were all about how great they thought it was. But I wasn't saying much. Not much more than it was amazing to look at, at any rate. And they're used to this from me, to me being the one most likely to not like a movie, but I was really trying not to say anything, but I guess I had this look on my face, because they were all like, ""What? What was it that you didn't like? Because it was amazing."" So I said I would share the one thing I thought was the most stupid (the arbitrary choice to have two pilots because the ""neural load"" was too much for one (like I said, there's a lot of scientific-sounding crap flung at the audience to achieve what they wanted in the story, but that ""neural load"" crap is just that: crap)), and one of the guys started to respond with ""but the neural load,"" and I just kind of looked at him, and he stopped, and, then, all three of them started spewing various stupidities from the movie. And that lasted for something like half an hour, and I never brought up another thing. So, see, all three of these guys that walked out of the theater loving the movie couldn't hold the stupid back once the gate was open, much like the Kaiju gate in the movie.

I wish I could say something positive about the acting, but there's nothing there to talk about. No one was horrible, but no one was great, either. Or, even, all that good. It was a 'fest of mediocre. Okay, Charlie Day was good, but he was as good as it got. I mean, Idris Elba was so flat, they had to give him a nose bleed to pass for emotion.

The whole movie was like getting a giant present wrapped in the most awesome wrapping ever: glittery paper, bows, a great card, but, when you open it, you find an open package of chewing gum or something. To put it another way: big hat, no cattle.",1374364800,3,4202,4.338422391857506
5390960,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) has always had a fascination with fantasy and science fiction stories populated with unusual, colorful characters amid macabre settings.  Originally set to direct The Hobbit films, he has, instead, switched gears and created a new film populated with mega monsters and super robotic warriors in an exciting, action spectacle, Pacific Rim.  What sets this apart from most apocalyptic battles is its well developed characters and relationships.  While its subject matter may not be for all tastes, it should satisfy most action and comic fans to the hilt.

Set in the not too distant future, a growing threat emerges from an ocean breach in the form of enormous monsters (think Godzilla types) called Kaijus which ravage world cities.  To combat these powerful creatures, world leaders construct giant war machines dubbed Jaegers which are controlled from within by a set of mind linked co-pilots.  But the threat increases, and the creatures, who have remarkable, adaptive powers, duel with an ever dwindling number of outmatched Jaegers.  While mentally linked, the copilots share each other's thoughts and memories.  Ace pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) has traumatic memories of loss from an earlier battle and must learn to overcome this while the prospect of a new co-pilot in the form of Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) brings her own horrible past.  As relationships are revealed and challenged, the monstrous Kaijus must be met in a last stand not only on land but at its mysterious source beneath the sea.

While there is undeniable sexual tension between Becket and Mori, the filmmakers do not settle for clichd romantic scenes, which a nice change of pace. The film deals primarily with facing and conquering one's own demons. Themes of loyalty, duty and sacrifice crop up. There are super mind melds and a nice dash of samurai mentality in the training and battle scenes, and there are elements of other action films like The Matrix and Top Gun especially towards the end.

These Jaegers have some awesome, cool weaponry, and the high tech hardware is detailed and impressive yet well used and realistic.  Movies such as The Transformers and the recent super hero films have raised the stakes of massive battle sequences in an urban setting, but Pacific Rim enlarges the playing field even more. And these monsters have tricks up their sleeve that would make even Godzilla envious.  Although the scale of the film is breathtaking, del Toro always keeps things grounded in reality and honest emotions. These characters have a camaraderie that evolves throughout the storyline.  Just like Peter Jackson in The Lord of the Rings films, de Toro demonstrates an impressive ability to marshal large set pieces while throwing in minute details or intimate moments. These things add to the texture of the story and its players; you begin to care for them.

Idris Elba is fast becoming the actor of choice (from his start on TV's The Wire through the recent Prometheus).  His role as the leader of the Jaegers, is critical to the storyline, and he even gets to have his own Independence Day/Henry V rallying speech. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman are a riot as rival scientists who bicker while trying to find solutions to the crises.  Long time del Toro repertory stalwart Ron Perlman has an amusing supporting role as a black marketeer.

Production credits are outstanding on all facets.  Special effects are through the roof, and the score by Ramin Djawadi is appropriately heroic and pulsating.  Do stay for the initial end credits for an amusing bonus scene.

If this is not your cup of tea, it is best avoided.  It is true there are perhaps too many climactic battles of these titans  (Del Toro even displays a hint of shoe fetish).  Yet for those who are game, it is a fun ride and a cut above typical sci-fi fare.  For fans and geeks, it is nirvana.

If you're going to make a film about giant war machines fighting larger-than-life evil to save the earth and instill the requisite human element, this is a textbook example of how to do it right.  Imagine that: a sci-fi blockbuster that moves you!  Boy, they are going to sell a lot of toys with this one!",1374364800,3,4208,4.905367231638418
5390961,4,B00A6UHC0U,"The film opens with a narration. It explains that a portal has opened connecting us to another universe in the Pacific Rim. Through this hole emerges destructive creatures from 60's Japanese films, updated of course. In a missed plot point, conventional means of fighting them seem to be useless, so we construct 100-150 foot tall robots called Jaegers to combat them. Missiles fired from Jaegers are effective, but...okay I tried not to think too hard about it.

The Jaegesr are controlled by 2 people, dressed in ""Star Wars"" storm trooper gear, that are in a mind meld that would make Spock green with envy. They are called pilots because Jaeger masters might be a copyright infringement.

The film combines elements of ""Independence Day,"" ""Starship Troopes,"" ""Transformers"" and ""Ironman"" and sets them into a stolen Japanese plot. Of course the rule is if you steal a plot from Japan you have to hire someone from Japan to be in the film, hence we have Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori. She will eventually team up with John Rico, eh ah Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam because Casper Van Dien is too old) to fight against the monsters coming at an increasing rate. There is a subplot that includes Ron Perlman and Charlie Day.

There are two schools of thought. One is to use the Jaegers to kill the creatures, the other is to build a war to keep out the illegal aliens. When the wall fails to keep out the illegal aliens, the Jaegers can defend the world thanks to ""stand your ground"" principles. Pardon my attempt at political humor.

The supporting characters were better written than the main ones.

This is an over dramatic, action packed popcorn film. The language is designed to appeal to a teen/young adult audience. Looks good on the big screen.

5390962,5,B00A6UHC0U,"This review is for the movie; not the blu ray. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It reminded me of all the Japanese tv shows (anyone remember Ultraman?) and monster movies (Godzilla, Rodan) I watched as a kid.  It is just plain dumb fun to watch the big robots square off against the giant monsters. There's no logic, great plot, or character development. Nor should there be. It's not meant to be....just as when you were a child, you have to willingly suspend your disbelief and accept what happens as is. This movie isn't meant to be critiqued and analyzed to death. It's just meant to be enjoyed....watching the heroes square off against the monsters. Loved every minute of it.",1374278400,,680,4.714285714285714
5390963,5,B00A6UHC0U,"For the kid inside who grew up watching Power Rangers, old Godzilla films, and mashing Megazord and Transformers action figures together for hours on end Pacific Rim is a dream come true.

The back-story of the film is covered in the first few minutes of the film.  It can be summarized as: A dimensional rift has opened at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and giant monsters known as Kaiju have begun pouring out, attacking coastal cities (the ""Pacific Rim"") with the sole purpose of eradicating human life.  When our conventional weapons failed all the world's governments came together to create the Jaegers, giant robots controlled by two pilots who are neurologically linked to their  Jaeger and each other, working in unison to fight the threat.

From here we get the set up for one of the most spectacular action movies of the last ten years.

Pacific Rim is refreshingly light, not carrying any pretension to bog down its subject matter.  If you hadn't guessed, the story is fairly typical, and the characters are archetypes, but I feel the way they are handled in this film is to its own benefit.  It works in the same way your favorite cartoons growing up worked.  Sometimes it seems people forget that archtypes have survived so long for a good reason, and in the case of Pacific Rim it helps us understand each and every character without ever going to deep into their personal back stories.  It is clearly designed as being an introduction to this genre.

Mixing humor with spectacular action Guillermo del Toro has nailed everything this genre has needed on the big screen.  The action is perfect, the concept is treated with reverence.  All of it is familiar yet new at the same time. Every time one of the Jaegers enters the screen it is treated with respect that makes you the viewer feel as if you'd grown up with these characters.  I lost count of how many times my jaw dropped during this movie.  It really was a childhood dream brought to life.

Guillermo del Toro has been personal favorite director of mine for years.  At the age of 13 I saw Hellboy on HBO and became so infatuated with the characters, and the director's visual style that I'd watch it every time it was on before ultimately getting the DVD (theatrical and Director's Cut) and spending hours going over the special features.  Hellboy, simply put, was fun.  And that was del Toro with a budget of $66 million ($82 mil if you want to factor in inflation).  Now with a budget pushing $200 million Pacific Rim allows Guillermo del Toro to deliver one of the grandest, most visually captivating movies of the last five years.

Now, I'm sure some people are going to compare Pacific Rim to Michael Bay's Transformers movies.  Don't.  To compare the two is to insult the hard work of Guillermo del Toro.  Pacific Rim respects its subject matter, it respects that its audience members are people who grew up with these kinds of stories, or are children who may wind up looking up to the film for years to come.  This is a great director cutting loose and wanting to not only make a fun movie, but one that appeals to the inner child of countless individuals.  It is not a shameless cash grab made by cynical Hollywood executives.  In short: This is what the Transformers movies should have been.

If you are a parent and have children around the age of 10 or older you need to take them to this movie.  If you are an adult who still remembers the wonder of Saturday morning cartoons and action figures you owe yourself a ticket to Pacific Rim.  You won't regret it.",1374278400,3,3546,4.600318471337579
5390964,4,B00A6UHC0U,"This movie is the epitome of the big, dumb, loud, entertaining as heck summer blockbuster.  The characters are cookie cutter, the dialogue is corny, but the actors seem to be having fun, and the robot on monster action (which, let's be honest, is why we wanted to watch Pacific Rim in the first place) is top notch.  The special effects in this movie are some of the best that I've ever seen on screen, and the 3D is actually decent.

This is a fun (albeit forgettable) movie that you won't regret seeing, especially on the big screen.",1374278400,2,535,4.494845360824742
5390965,3,B00A6UHC0U,"In the modern-day action film you come to expect it: The big special-effects, blockbuster extravaganza! The world in peril; Only one hero can save us; It's all-out action! ""Pacific Rim"" is all of those things. And while it's enjoyable for what it is, it doesn't bring you anything you haven't seen before.

The plot revolves around an inter-dimension rift in the ocean, that allows giant monsters to come into our world. The only force to stop them are giant robots, called ""Jaegers,"" which rely on two pilots to control it. When the threat of the monsters becomes too great, the ""Jaegers"" must undertake a mission that is a do-or-die proposition for them and the Earth!

As I said, this film hits all the notes that you expect. There's lots of action and visual effects on display. And some of the battles are a bit exciting. But it also has character plots that are so by-the-numbers, that you could set your watch to them. The one jerk pilot (played by Robert Kazinsky) is always poking our hero pilot (played by Charlie Hunnam), so you know a throw down between them is inevitable. Then you have the story point about only one other guy having piloted a ""Jaeger"" solo, besides our hero, and they telegraph to you who it is, so when it is revealed, there is absolutely no surprise at all to it. Much of the character development stuff between the battles, while not dragging in pace, certainly doesn't do much to advance your interest or investment in the characters. It's decent filler material, but you'll see the ""twists"" coming a mile away.

There is some nice comedy relief from Charlie Day's and Burn Gorman's characters, as they play a couple of squabbling and competitive scientists, looking to figure out a way to stop the monsters for good. And Ron Perlman's turn as a sleazy black market salesman is good for a few laughs, too. They bring a little bit of campy life to the script and downtime moments from the action sequences, which are enjoyable. But, overall, the character moments are just there to kill the time between monster fights. Director Guillermo del Toro knows that he's not looking to make a great dramatic tale, but a fast-paced action epic that is filled with lots of visual eye-candy for the viewer. And, for the most part, he accomplishes that much.

In the end, ""Pacific Rim"" is what it is and does what it sets out to do. But it doesn't give you anything new, that you haven't seen before. To me, the film is basically ""Voltron meets Godzilla (the 1998 version)!"" It's a movie that's all about having some big, dumb fun, as it asks you to check your brain at the door. It's far from the worst movie you could see and there are definitely worse ways to kill 131 minutes of your day. So, if you are looking for a visually exciting spectacle, that won't cause you to tax your mental capacities, this film will give you what you crave! If you are looking for something more, you'd probably best look elsewhere.",1374278400,,2941,4.606870229007634
5390966,3,B00A6UHC0U,"For those raving about Pacific Rim, due to better CGI and overall technology, it is definitely the best monster movie this summer. However, the acting wasn't that good and the overall story was lacking. They even had a few awkward moments that made me almost want to look away. Rinko Kikuchi's character had quite a few awkward moments and the little girl portraying the young version of her character, even though she only had a really short scene, the whole way through was filled with overacting and bad directing. The ending battle was rather weak, especially compared to the one in the middle of the movie (the one shown throughout all of the different movie trailers). On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this movie around a 7 or 7.5. Anybody that says this movie is a 10 is a blind fanboy. Beyond awesome monster battles, mediocre story and mediocre to poor acting. I don't understand why they even bother introducing the other bots in the movie, waste of time since there's only one bot that did 80%+ of the battle or so...",1374192000,3,1027,4.556756756756757
5390967,3,B00A6UHC0U,"I actually liked this movie far more than my 3-star rating suggests. For a popcorn movie -- and that's exactly what this is, at the level of ""Starship Troopers"" -- it's well worth your $10 ticket. The storyline is formulaic: destructive aliens come to Earth; our only hope of stopping them comes with the Jaegers, a series of super-powered mechanized warriors operated by humans; there's a reluctant hero who suffered a personal tragedy and is dragged back into the fight; another one who wants to avenge their family and isn't allowed to fight; a rival that dislikes the hero; a stoic commanding officer who's hiding something; the nerdy scientist (or in this case, two) who makes a series of crucial discoveries; the dark, villainous person that the good guys have to trust to get what they need; the desperate solution; the heroic sacrifice that must be made to save mankind. There's even a love interest (but only hinted at). And all of this is set against the backdrop of explosions, death and apocalyptic-level destruction.

If this sounds familiar, it's because it's been done before many times. And that's the problem I have with ""Pacific Rim"": Lack of originality. This movie borrows from so many other films, it'll be amazing if the writers and producer don't get sued. About 80 percent of the film is lifted from the anime series ""Neon Genesis: Evangelion"" (fans of that show will know exactly what I'm talking about). There are also elements from the newest ""King Kong"" and ""Godzilla"" films, ""Independence Day,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Iron Man"" and ""Transformers""; there's even a ""Power Rangers"" feel about all of this. And the ending is straight out of ""Battlefield Earth,"" with an epilogue that copies ""Men in Black.""

Despite all that, the film works. You find yourself rooting for the good guys, even though you know how it's going to end about halfway through the movie. You marvel at the Jaegers and their various capabilities (amazing what the world can build when it stops fighting among itself). The CGI effects are believable (it helps that a good chunk of the film takes place at night); it might even be worth seeing in 3D. So, get yourself a bucket of buttered and a good date, and watch the latest war of the worlds.",1374192000,3,2237,4.822916666666667
5390968,5,B00A6UHC0U,"For those who saw the trailer and thought ""Oh, sweet, a big monster fight movie!""  Go see this.  NOW!  You will NOT be disappointed by the giant monster fights.  It outdoes anything Transformers has ever offered on that front.  Seriously, just go see it, you get lots of awesome monster fights.  Oh boy, do you get awesome monster fights...

For those of us who saw the trailer with some skepticism on whether a filmmaker even *could* successfully make what basically looked like a big budget modern version of a 70's Godzilla movie, put your fears to rest, this is a movie with more going for it than you'd think.  It has heart.

I'm not going to rehash the plot, you know the broad outline and that's enough.  What you do need to know is that Pacific Rim is a movie that actually offers an interesting human message.  In a nutshell, its that people need to stop being victims and work together.

The robot pilots work together in teams of two because the machines are so complex that its too much for one mind to take.  So to pilot the big robots, they link minds and share each others memories and thoughts.  This allows them to work the machine, but its dangerous when a person runs across a traumatic memory in the other pilots mind since it can derail the whole interface.  The two main characters are both people with some heavy emotional baggage.  Both have lost people very close to them to these monsters.  Both have to overcome that to work together and fight a greater evil.  Other characters have similar issues.  We see ego clashes, scars from bad parents, terminal illness, and more.  Yet in all of these cases, they manage to overcome their problems and confront their personal demons all so they can team up to fight the actual demons coming up from the ocean floor.

Its an interesting metaphor considering ours is quickly becoming a society filled with victims.  So many people do have big problems, big issues, but you don't have to let the past cripple your future, and when you concentrate on how you can help others, you find ways to overcome your own problems.  Its a good message, and thankfully one that's not sledgehammered into your head by the end of the film, all the emotional heavy lifting is handled with some amount of subtlety so at no point does it feel like a big soap opera is going on between monster fights.

The film isn't perfect, but most of those flaws don't really matter when stacked up to the big picture.  Pacific Rim is a movie that delivers what it promises, but gives you more than you might expect if you actually pay attention.  Yeah, its a Kaiju film, but how often do we get a big budget, American Kaiju film that not only is very very good, but actually has some heart and some brains?

...and to think this movie got beat opening weekend by Grownups 2.  Seriously, people give the Transformers movies billions of dollars but when a GOOD giant robot movie comes out, no one sees it.  *SIGH*",1374192000,2,2946,4.526515151515151

5390970,2,B00A6UHC0U,"I just saw Pacific Rim a couple of days ago and I'll be damned if I can tell you what the main character's name is.  What is it?  I have no idea.  Minor point I guess.
So here is the movie in a nutshell - get a blender and put in Godzilla, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers, Transformers, Independence Day, and Avatar.  Boom - you've got Pacific Rim.
I'll give the movie one big kudo though - they did grime right.  You see, heavy, grimy, industrial tech is the key.  For example, in the original Star Wars film, tech was big, greasy, and dirty.  In the prequels, Lucas screwed it up because he made everything new and shiny - more like Star Trek than Star Wars.  Are you listening Disney????
Regardless, they got the tech feel right in Pacific Rim.  Big and dirty.
So what is the problem?  Well  like usual, the plot makes no sense at all.
First of all, you need to have some sort of introduction to the main character - some reason to care about him.  In this case, all we really know is his brother got killed.  Who is he?  Why is he there?  What is his motivation?  Why do we care?  For that matter, what the heck is his name?
After his brother gets killed, what is he doing in construction and how does the black dude running the show (what is his name) know exactly where to find him?  He just lands in his helicopter and is like hey... let's go.
So here we are with main hero we don't really care about.  He gets paired up with Asian woman - what is her name anyway?  What the heck?  Anyway, at least they do a better job developing her character.  We see her motivation through childhood memories.  Of course, the confusing part is how they get paired up - apparently you choose your partner by some sort of kung-fu stick fighting.  Notice how everyone is usually paired because they are brothers, or twins, or father and son.  So what about main dude and Asian chic?  Well they figure it out by stick fighting.  Huh?
Oh, and what about that guy who does the mind meld with the chunk of brain?  What was his name?  Anyway... are you kidding me that the aliens then send a couple monsters through the breach just to get him?  Why?  What's the point?  He is worthless.  And when he freaks out down in the bunker that they are after him, everyone else just believes the guy?  Wouldn't they just think he was nuts?
Oh, and does it make any sense that the world governments are shutting the Mick Jaggar program down?  Why?  So they can build some big walls? Which of course fail, but then why don't they start funding the Mick Jaggar program again?
Oh, and if nukes seem to work on the monsters, why not use them more often?  The creatures come up out of the sea, right?  The people know when an ""event"" occurs, right?  So dropping a nuke on them would just create an explosion out in the ocean, right?  Uhhhhhhh.... I don't get it.
Uh, can't forget the politically correct mumbo-jumbo either.  These aliens apparently want our world because we polluted it, global warming, etc  so now it is just right for them.  Oh yeah, and they are jumping from planet to planet consuming the resources.... Oh wait, that was Independence Day... oh wait... nevermind.  Anyway - the whole ""man ruined the world"" theme is for pansies.  According to the film, these aliens sent the dinosaurs as well, but the planet wasn't ready for colonization at the time or something.  So what do they do?  I guess they decided to wait a couple million years for human to evolve just so we could have an industrial revolution and pollute the atmosphere.  I mean heck, I'm sure the aliens didn't mind waiting around for a million years or two before invading.  I guess the aliens figured they couldn't just do a little terraforming themselves... they would rather wait for apes to evolve into humans and for humans to create acid rain (oh wait... whatever happened to that?) or an ozone hole (oh wait, whatever happened to that?) or global warming... er I mean climate change... or something.
Really?  This is the best the writers and producers could come up with?  The aliens created the dinosaurs, invaded earth with them, but then decided to wait around for millions of years for humans to evolve and trash the planet?  Really?
So what is the deal with these Mick Jaggar robots anyway?  You build gigantic robots to fight alien monsters and they mainly do so how?  By punching them in the face?  If that was the main design idea, why not give them spiked knuckles or something?  At least the red robot has spinning blades on its hands.  Yeah, they have fancy weapons, rockets, etc  that they break out, but the main move is usually just a good old elbow drop to the cranium or something.
Hey - anyone else notice that Optimus Prime has the same sort of sword in his arm?  Anyone else notice that the acid spitting monster is just like the big bug from Starship Troopers?  Anyone else notice that the big speech scene before they go off to battle is just like the big speech scene in Independence Day?
Sooooo.... I guess the big plan is to drop a nuke down the breach and blow it up - except that they find out that there are some sort of gates in the breach and you need a monster's DNA signature to open the gates.  Whatever... I'm cool with the basic idea... except that leads to some questions about how the breach was created... but that's a discussion for me to have at your house next week over tea.  Regardless, so the Gipsy Mick Jaggar goes down the hole with a dead beast and the gates open.  Fine... but then how do the escape pods get back out?  I though you needed monster DNA to open the gates?  Right?  So how do the escape pods get out?  Do you only need monster DNA to go back down, but not up?  Maybe, but what would be the point in that?  The monsters never come back anyway.  Each one is on a suicide mission to cause a bunch of damage.
Oh... almost forgot. There are only 4 Mick Jaggars left at the Hong Kong base.  So what is the great strategy they use when they get a double event and two monsters pop up?  They send only two to fight, leave a third back in reserve, and leave the main character and his Gipsy Jagger back at the base.  In other words, they could go 4 on 2, but they choose to go 2 on 2 and get their butts kicked... of course.  Hey, how about at least going 3 on two?  What's the point in holding number 3 in reserve until you start losing?  By then it is too late.  Who came up with this plan anyway?
All that being said, I still give the movie a 2.  The effects were really pretty well done and it was entertaining enough if you didn't think at all about what you were watching.",1374105600,9,6594,4.315660685154976

All the nay sayers and haters don't know what they are talking about and they maybe thought they were going to see a ""drama"" or ""love story"" or any chic flick.  Maybe they didn't grasp the previews when they showed the giant monster destroying something?  Yes I could understand how that would throw someone off.  Yes my first thought was, ""my wife would love this dramatic telling of a love struck alien monster"".  My gauge for knowing a movie was very good is how fast the two hours go by.  During this movie I felt like I was only sitting there for 30 minutes.  I can't wait to get the 3D version on blu ray.",1374105600,,1204,4.5488372093023255

Whenever the robots fight the monsters, it's dark and rainy and you can hardly see what's going on half the time. The monsters are called Kaijus. They come from a portal underneath the ocean.

5390974,4,B00A6UHC0U,"This was a real surprise -- a big, loud, summer popcorn movie populated with flesh and blood characters.  It's a diverting action spectacle possessing that one ingredient missing from so many like-minded blockbusters of the modern era: heart.  PACIFIC RIM is slick entertainment that thankfully feels like a movie, not a video game, and director del Toro is to be commended for assembling the picture in a way that doesn't numb the senses with ADD-style editing and protracted battle scenes that wear out their welcome (attention, Zack Snyder!).

Question for del Toro fans: are shoes something of a signature for this director?  The only other del Toro picture I have seen is MIMIC, and it and PACIFIC RIM both make a point of drawing attention to shoes numerous times...",1374019200,,772,4.961240310077519
5390975,5,B00A6UHC0U,"After I finished watching this film, the first thing I thought was how this reminded me of Voltron.  It was a series I watched religiously as a child.  Of course, if you saw that show, the best part was when Voltron would battle a monster.

This shows that Japanese Anime was way ahead of its time.  This kind of plot between big machines versus monsters is a very old concept in that genre.  The problem is that the Japanese never made a movie like Pacific Rim.  It was probably because it would take a sizable budget to make a movie about it.  It was all cartoons and I finally grew up and stopped watching Anime.

That is why, after I saw the trailers, I was anxiously looking forward to watching this film.  It has a big budget.  Why is that important?  Because you know that the monsters and the robots are not going to look good with cheesy special effects that you see in a low-budget sci-fi film.

Then I saw Pacific Rim.  I was impressed.  I was not expecting to see the monsters until the very end of the film.  That was not the case.  You see the monsters and the robots throughout the film.  The first monster makes its appearance in under 5 minutes.  Awesome!!!!

I will tell you this.  The battle scenes are way better than the ones found in Michael Bay's Transformers.  You can actually see who is who and the fighting moves are vividly clear.  This makes the film more fun to watch.  My only problems with the fight scenes were they happened at night and, for some reason, it was always raining.  I guess there was a reason for that.  I will have to ask the director.

The good thing is that the film is not all special effects.  It has a pretty decent script.  The positive thing that entails is that the film engages you while there is no fighting or monsters in the film.  The downtime scenes are all pertinent to the plot of the film.  There are no baloney scenes in this film that make it longer for no reason.  In fact, I would say the film goes by fast and does not drag at all.

I give the film five stars.  This is for two reasons.  It is something you have to see in a theater.  It also is a movie you can add to your home collection and watch it again and again if you like sci-fi.",1373932800,,2208,4.2009569377990434
5390976,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I loved it! Guillermo makes beautiful eye-candy. This movie is fun, fairly paced, and invigorating. The battles build on top of each like a battle to 1-up each other. Great surprises as the movie moves along and beautiful design in the wardrobe, locations, digital interfaces, armor, robots, and the monsters (Kaiju). Not a new story conceptually, but good enough to motivate all characters to want to move forward. If Guillermo didn't do this, Godzilla in his hands would have been fantastic.",1373932800,,493,5.098765432098766
5390977,5,B00A6UHC0U,"I'll say up front, though it bears little resemblance to the monster sized dump that is Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" trilogy-Pacific Rim is the type of movie Bayformers should have been.  What I mean by that-is that unlike those hell spawned abominations-Pacific Rim delivers giant robots that awe and inspire instead of ones that pee on people and dangle metallic testicles.  Also unlike Bayformers you will not be forced to witness any dog humping or have to groan through lame ""jokes"" about red mugs in yellow rooms.  (No 45 minute long who-gives-a-crap job interview scenes in here either)

  Thankfully-Pacific Rim does not take an uber-cool property and twist it, turn it and crush it beyond recognition into some overly long, lame one-note joke of a film.  Instead, it's completely earnest and non cynical in its delivery.  I've been a fan of Guillermo Del Toro since Pan's Labyrinth (a BRILLIANT adult fairy tale) and have gone back and watched his other films to discover what a true master of the art he really is.  I went into Pacific Rim with realistic expectations-daring to hope that it would be the movie I wanted it to be.  I left the theater transformed into a little boy filled with wonder and amazement at what I had just witnessed.  Though this film is jam packed with special effects-they serve to add to the story not to take away from it or go unnecessarily over the top (I'm looking at you Man of Steel...).

  The Jaegers here are a marvel to behold and easy on the eyes (unlike the overcomplicated designs of the Bayformers).  The sense of scale and power they inspire is awe striking and the Jaegers are beautifully designed in every way.  In fact, the whole movie (praise to the art director) is incredibly consistent in its design-whisking us far away from the real world into the candy colored Kaiju vs. Jaeger world of the future which is EXACTLY what a good movie SHOULD do.  This film takes special effects far beyond mere gimmickry and serves them up as colorful and artistic as possible.  Even if Pacific Rim is not your kind of movie, you can't help but to be blown away by how beautiful it all is.  While the story here may not be Oscar-worthy, it's still very sound and interesting and the characters (mostly unknown actors) are very likable.  Idris Elba is good in everything he does and his role here is no different.  Charlie Hunnam also brings a lot of charisma to the protagonist.  In short, Pacific Rim is a well meaning film that knows EXACTLY what kind of film it is and it aims right for the heart of the little boy inside us all.  For me, it brought back that sense of wonder and awe my adult self had forgotten movies were still capable of delivering.  I really enjoyed playing in Guillermo Del Toro's sand box.  Pacific Rim is a monsters vs. robots smash fest and it's completely unapologetic about being exactly that.  Do yourself a favor and give Pacific Rim a look.  See it in the theater if you can for the sheer sense of scale.  Fathers take your sons to see this film too.  If movies like this continue to flounder at the box office, it's a guarantee that original ideas will cease to exist and the summer box office season will be bloated with more sequels, spin offs, reboots, etc.  Del Toro nailed this one, it's the movie his career has been building up to.  I just knew he had something spectacular up his sleeve and Pacific Rim is that film.  It's fantastic.",1373932800,503,3420,4.592409240924092
5390978,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I'm a huge fan of Guillermo Del Toro's work. He has a unique directing style. He provides good character development with breathtaking action scenes. I first became aware of him because of the work he did with 'Blade 2'.The best of the Blade series in my opinion. Last thing I saw was 'Pan's Labyrinth' and the creatures in that were uniquely horrible and grotesque and brought a new and disturbing style to the big screen.
You can see that style in these monstrous creatures that appear in our realm and they are wonderful to behold, as are the giant robots that battle them. Just about everything in this movie appealed to me ,from the character development to the fight scenes arising from conflict between the characters ,to the battle action with the monsters. I guess it was only a matter of time before humans driving massive robots was brought to western cinema as this sort of thing is quite common in eastern entertainment, especially in anime.
The acting was top notch. I hadn't seen Charlie Hunnam before and he did a great job as did the rest of the cast.
I have one complaint though. Two of the main characters were Australian. Being Australian myself,I won't say I was insulted,let's just say I was very disappointed that they had American actors portraying them and THIS happens EVERY time .....  OUR ACCENT IS BUTCHERED.A major plot shift occurs in Sydney. Why would you take the time to shoot a great scene with a monster rampaging past the Sydney Opera House and not have Aussies playing these characters ? We have a WEALTH of talent here. The rest of the world knows this. I don't need to list the many actors from here that are working in the states today.
In my opinion it's a bit of a sledge against our film industry and the Australian actors themselves. It detracted from my enjoyment of the film and I'm sure a lot of Australians will feel the same way. It's disrespectful.
Anyway , I'll get off my soapbox now and state that the film is well worth seeing, especially on the big screen. Check it out and ignore the Australian accents. The film is a ton of fun and it reminded me of those old Asian flicks you used to see on black and white TV on a rainy Saturday afternoon as a kid. The giant monsters battling it out or just one destroying a whole city brought back fond memories. With the special effects the way they are today,I was glued to the screen as I'm sure you will be as well.",1373846400,4,2414,4.486363636363636
5390979,4,B00A6UHC0U,"With the success of movies such as ""The Host"" and ""Cloverfield"" It's good to see the old time 'big monster' movies finding a new audience. This is up there with the best.

Here's the scoop. Aliens are cloning huge sea monsters to overtake the earth. All the countries have pooled their resources to create giant, 2 pilot robots to do battle with the near unstoppable monsters. It's a tough road because the right two pilots need to be paired up and most everyone involved has some serious baggage that keeps that from happening. Throw in two goofy scientists working a different angle and you have a load of fun.

From Guillermo Del Toro's earliest feature film ""Cronos"" one sees his fascination for elaborate moving gears. He jacks it up big time here. The robots are all very impressive. The monsters are no less so. Some could be in a ""Cloverfield"" remake (were there one). But they are mighty, dinosaur looking creatures. The effects are top shelf. I'm continually amazed at how good these keep getting. The cast is decent. Old 'hands in his pockets' Charlie Hunnam is no more or less than you've seen him in other projects. Cliff Collins is always good and here he's given a nifty hair cut and garb. Charlie Day is a hoot as the scientist and they pair him with the equally funny Burn Gorman as his partner/rival. They add much needed comic relief to an otherwise grim film. Del Toro borrows from (pays homage to?) films such as ""Independence Day,"" ""Bladerunner,"" ""Cloverfield"" and others. Some might call that cheating but I rather liked it.

The back stories are decent enough to add a bit of depth and break up the action, but they're a short putt from ""B"" movie stuff. The music seemed strongly influenced by earlier monster movies. One reviewer complained about the constant rain and that can be a cheap technique to add mood but it didn't bother me. This doesn't set out to be the greatest movie ever made. It's giant robots fighting giant monsters. What's not to like?",1373846400,3,1980,4.667621776504298
5390980,4,B00A6UHC0U,"""The deeper you bond, the better you fight,"" Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) tells two co-warriors. Syncing emotion with action with more action, Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim is a warmer Transformers -or Real Steel writ extra-large, complete with dad issues and hardware that's a bit lumbering but gets the job done. Something that could be said of the movie itself.

It shares a key niggle with Michael Bay's metal-on-metal orgies: some of the scraps, you just don't have the foggiest what you're looking at. Otherwise, though, we're dealing with a different model of FX-engorged blockbusting. One that's steeped in affection and sincerity and doesn't go in for jarringly crass stereotypes, slapstick or sex gags.

The pre-title sequence nails a balance between exposition, character development and mass destruction, as Charlie Hunnam's Raleigh Becket voiceovers the state of the play (invading aliens from an under-sea portal are combated by robots steered by two pilots sharing a mind-link called `The Drift'), before tragedy hits and he's out of the game... Until, of course, soldier-boss Pentecost pulls him back in.

After the opening rumble, it's a good hour before the Kaiju (them) and the Jaegars (us) have a rematch. No problem: GdT uses the downtime to get our heads around Drift-ing, which boils down to a not-too-mawkish metaphor for human connection.

Strutting and soulful, Hunnam is the hero, but the film's heart belongs to Babel Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuchi, who overcomes plucky-rookie-battling-inner-demons clichs with unstudied sweetness. Plus a few cool moves in the training dojo.

Elba is suitably commanding (and gets a corny-but-rousing Independence Day moment), Ron Perlman shark-grins through an extended cameo and there are two highly-strung scientists (Charlie Day, Burn Gorman) you think are going to annoy but grow to tolerate.

And this being GdT, the creatures are beautifully ugly creations: machete-faced, blue-acid-barfing, multi-tail-lashing... infused with less of Pan's Labyrinth's poetry perhaps, though there's a Harryhausen-like pulp majesty to their stately wrestles with the Jaegars.

You just wish, goggling as they thrash across cities, seas, space and beyond, that your view wasn't so clogged with embers, sparks, mist, neon and rain, rain, rain.

Still, such is the goodwill GdT marshals elsewhere -the little sight gags, the generosity towards all characters, good or douche-y, the sheer childlike delight in building a massive made-up world - you don't really mind not knowing which robot the severed arm that just flew across the screen belongs to.",1373846400,,2603,5.473815461346633
5390981,4,B00A6UHC0U,"After watching ""Pacific Rim"", it is no surprise that there is a ""Godzilla"" project in the works for 2014. Essentially, ""Pacific Rim"" is proof again that movie technology has once again lept into a new era. Sure, many of the scenes that depict the giant monsters from an under-ocean crevice fighting giant human created robots, take place in the dark and in the rain; a seemingly ongoing technique to lessen the difficulty when it comes to creating realism during editing process. Despite this though, ""Pacific Rim"" is still a monumental success of science fiction creation.

The best part about ""Pacific Rim"" though, is that it isn't just a special effects showcase. It was directed and written by Guillermo del Toro; a rare man in Hollywood who knows how to mix technology and effects with heart and soul. Although del Toro hadn't directed anything in 5-years, he has had his hand in many cool things, including ""The Hobbit"", both ""Hellboy"" movies and one of my all-time favorite movies, ""Pans Labyrinth"".  Not only did he bring the giant monsters and the huge bash up scenes, he also brought the heart and personality of the characters that ride inside the giant robots, to life.

Occasionally when watching a movie, you feel that urge to swing your own hand in celebration or mimicking the action on the screen. Just to name a few, this happened to me during Rocky, Karate Kid (the first one), Lethal Weapon 2 when Riggs grabs the guy with the pool sweeper on the balcony and probably during Die Hard a few times. I'm sure it's happened a few more times than that, but those are the movies that stick out in my mind and now I can add ""Pacific Rim"" to the list; a little bit. Oh, it wasn't out loud celebration and it didn't impulse me to take an actual swing with my right arm or anything, but I felt the nerve impulse trying to move my arm.  ""Rim"" is that kind of movie. It's plain and simple, fun, root for the good guy type suspense. The evil is great and the consequences are insurmountable. What more can you ask for?

""Pacific Rim"" is not a great movie, but it certainly is a good one. What may have been lacking might just have been something that was unavoidable. The monsters are pretty simplistic and unexplained. Even when they are explained, it isn't all that complicated. Despite that, the action is great, the story is a good one and the most important thing; the characters, Raleigh Becket, Stacker Pentecost and Mako Mori are vividly created and portrayed. Finally, somebody made a big blockbuster movie with giant large scale special effects and didn't fail or at least try to make us care for the people involved. For that, ""Pacific Rim"" is like a glowing beacon of hope for the future of movies.",1373846400,5,2717,4.628630705394191
5390982,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Effects. Effects. Effects.  That's why you wanted to see this movie.  NOT for a good story!  This is live-action anime.  If I hear one more fool (who thinks he's a deep thinker) criticize the story while overlooking the action I'm going to lose it.  You can't sound smart if your critique of the story suggests this movie is ""bad.""

This is one of those movies that gets your over-critical friends saying ""it just looks like a big blob of CGI.""  Sure, the scale of this summer blockbuster-style film is TREMENDOUS.  But, unlike the Transformers sequels, it doesn't get away from itself.  No.  We still find some Guillermo del Toroisms, especially in creature-creation and preternatural market senes.  The story, on the other hand, is quite simple. It strikes me as something out of a videogame or a futuristic Dungeons & Dragons adventure.  It's no Troy (2004).  Troy was an epic-scale war story that--among some AMAZING action sequences--still allowed its viewers to intimately understand the characters.  Rim is less (successfully) character-driven.  A few things are revealed about the characters, but they don't seem to ""develop.""  But why was this movie made, how was it marketed and who was it made to please?  Probably not a bunch of stuck up plot critics.  No, this was made for sci-fi effects and action junkies.  So, if you're not willing to check your critic's hat at the door, then I suggest you just shut up and wait for the next giant monster fight when you go see this.

Through some manner of portal between tectonic plates deep below the Pacific Ocean emerge giant behemoths called Kaiju.  These creatures come all shapes and plus-sizes.

There's your movie.  If you need great writing to accompany this, then shame on you.

To save humanity all of the world powers set aside their differences to pool their finances and engineer Jaegers, giant robots jockeyed by paired, mind-melded (aka, drifting) pilots.  All seems to be fine--given that we are under attack by 600 foot tall abominations--until the Kaiju start winning!  Though simple behemoths at first, subsequently emerging Kaiju are bigger, smarter fighters with more bells and whistles.  The world powers begin to doubt the Jaeger program, whose director Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba; The Losers, Prometheus) is running out of options.

Despite the simple story, there is a steady flow of information to keep us informed and updated about the Jaeger program and what we know about the Kaijus.  It provides a nice balance between the action, which was delivered with a sense of uncertain urgency as to just how bad things were going to become for the Jaeger pilots in many situations.  To put it briefly, the dire consequences of piloting a Jaeger are realistically depicted even as we enjoy a world-threat story in which humanity actually unites instead of letting our differences impede our success.

Pentecost turns to ex-pilot Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam; Sons of Anarchy) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi; Assault Girls), who get the most attention among several pairs of Jaeger pilots we meet.  Mori is meant to strong and complex, but to me her character seems ill-imagined and entirely out of place.  Raleigh isn't perfect either, but at least he's not another one of those ""reluctant heroes.""  There's a little romantic interest there and I think it fails both in execution and contribution to the movie.

Interspersed between pilot-Jaeger highlights we have a pair of bantering scientists who provide some silly, charming comic relief.  Dr. Gottlieb (Burn Gorman; The Dark Knight Rises, Red Lights) is some sort of physicist and Dr. Newt Geiszler (Charlie Day; who brings a welcomed quirky performance) is some combination xenobiologist-neurobiologist-biomedical engineer.  Lastly, Ron Perlman's Hannibal Chau is a Kaiju parts broker.  Why is he in this? I'd just say because del Toro can't seem to make a movie without him...Hellboy 2, Blade 2, Cronos.

Returning to the effects, the effects make this movie. They don't ""save"" it.  They make it a satisfying experience all on their own.  The Kaiju each come with their own distinct appearance and fighting style, and the same goes for each Jaeger and its pilots.  In fact, the Jaegers and Kaiju are presented as their own named characters.  Amazing attention to detail was placed on the movements of these over-sized combatants, their surroundings and how they destructively plow into and through them.  I already can't wait to watch it again because so much was going on in each of these fights that I feel I must have missed a lot of clever nuance.

5390994,3,B00A6UHC0U,"When i first heard that one of the greatest directors in the film industry Guillermo del Toro was going to be making a Giant robot Vs. Giant monster movie i got super excited, mainly because many people believed it was going to be a live action version of Neon Genesis Evangelion which is news that every Evangelion fan has been waiting to hear for years, and with Guillermo del Toro's capabilities it sounded like a dream come true. Unfortunately Pacific Rim wasn't going to be an Evagelion film, however del Toro is a big fan of anime and Evangelion did have a strong influence on the script and the style of this film, so much so that i can't understand why del Toro or the studio didn't just go ahead and make an Evangelion film instead, maybe that fault lies with Gainax, the production company that owns Evangelion, back in 2011 Gainax was sued by A.D. Vision, who claimed Gainax's refusal to accept an option payment for the perpetual live-action rights to Evangelion was a breach of contact and had resulted in losing an opportunity to produce the film with a major studio, so i'm gonna guess that might be one reason we've ended up with Pacific Rim.

So here's my first problem with this movie, you have an incredibly talented director who has a gift at creating complex and realistic characters that you really connect with as the story unfolds, at least that is the case with his previous films, Pacific Rim however is full of actors that are trying to be live action parody's of characters from Evangelion and various other anime shows and it just comes off as weird, what works fine in an anime doesn't always translate over to live action very well, at times it feels like i'm watching a parody sketch on Saturday Night Live, especially when the two bumbling oaf scientists come walking in completely hamming up any seriousness this story about a world being wreaked by giant alien monsters had built up from the beginning, I'm fully aware this was done intentionally, but this feels way below what del Toro is capable of.

My next problem is the lack of detail in the science of The Drift and how they figure out if two people are compatible. This is really one of the dumbest parts of the movie, in order to determine if two people are Drift compatible they have everyone fight each other with sticks, how is that supposed to determine if your brain is capable of connecting safely with another persons brain exactly?

Now for my last problem. In pacific Rim there doesn't seem to be a real reason as to why our only way of defeating the kaiju is by building giant robots, we see at the start of the film jets and other modern day weaponry taking down some of the first ones that came through the Rift just fine. Of course over time the Kaiju get tougher, but they can still be killed with more effective modern day weapons, heck drop some nukes on them, i know it won't work on the Rift, but a low yield nuke would kill the Kaiju just nicely. Instead we're forced to use slow, bulky, and week armored giant robots to dish out some hand to hand combat (and in one scene) only remembering that they have a sword they could be using only after they've been nearly torn to pieces. Evangelion didn't have this problem, the monsters in Eva had a form of force field that no modern day weapon could penetrate, so we created the Evangelion units, a machine that could generate an anti force field granting us the opportunity to get close enough to strike a killing blow to the heart of the monster.

In the end i still liked this movie, i also love Ron Perlman's cameo despite the fact that his character seems almost forced into the film with no real purpose. Guillermo del Toro set out to make a Giant Robot VS. Giant Monsters movie in the style of an anime and even though the movie has some considerable flaws he has somewhat succeed, most people will ether not notice the problems with this film or will simply ignore them which is fine, as for myself, i have to say i respect what Guillermo del Toro tried to do, but it just didn't fully work for me, Pacific Rim has the right look, it just lacks the intelligence and sophistication of his other films. One last thing, when the movie ends don't stop watching, wait till after the credits for a funny extra scene.",1373760000,,4277,4.486521181001284

Very disappointing. I won't give away any spoilers, although i don't see how I could since there is barely a plot.

Great cast & great director and yet this movie feels like the equivalent of a Bernie Madoff scam, lots of money invested, but no dividend.

Merge Transformers 2 and Starship Troopers add Godzilla (or Godzillas) into the mix then remove the humor & cultural parody, add more fight scenes and noise, make the film as dark as possible so the audience is force to squint throughout and you have PACIFIC RIM.

And before you rain down the hate on me, let me mention that I loved Transformers (the first one) and the campy Starship Troopers, and am a fan of Godzilla & monster movies.

He manages to keep the films movement consistent and still displays a deep level of character development. In other words who are these people and do we give a damn, the answer is yes we do. Most kaiju movies alternate between slow moving plot development and blasts of action. Should you go see this in a theater, absolutely. Should you view it more than once yes you should. Did Senor Del Toro get to make in the mountains of madness no, but he did get to make a HP Lovecraft inspired giant robot movie and thus redefine and reinvigorate the genre at the same time.

My favorite part is (seen in previews first) of the Jaeger using a boat like a baseball bat. SPECTACULAR!
Some people have said that it's this or that, or the other thing. I'm telling you to judge for yourself. If I had paid attention to the 'mixed reviews' it got before release, I might not have gone to see it. I would have missed out on a fantastic time, and a spectacular movie. Granted, it's not deeply philosophical, and the plot is formulaic, but that's part of what makes it GREAT!
VERY IMPORTANT: Stay all the way through the credits. You will not regret it.",1373760000,2,1417,4.232472324723247
5390999,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Ok guys, seriously, this movie is incredible, intense, insane, and just SO. MUCH. FUN. I have never left a theater feeling this physically exhausted. I had to constantly take deep breaths. Let me try to explain the Greatest B-Movie Ever Made:
(SPOILERS AHOY!)
So there's these giant monsters, the Kaiju. ""Kaiju"" is Japanese for ""strange creature,"" or so I heard. They're spawning every so often from the Pacific Ocean. After the first one takes out half of San Francisco (by attacking the Golden Gate Bridge first), the U.N. gets together and says ""HAI GUIZE, LETS MAEK GAINT ROBOTS"" so they build these 500-foot tall guys called Jaegers (German for ""Hunters""). AND THEY ARE AWESOME. They're stationed in Alaska, Hong Kong, Honlulu and other places around the ... PACIFIC RIM. Within a couple of years, the robots (sorry, JAEGERS) are easily defeating the monsters, and the Jaeger co-pilots are treated as superheroes.
BUT then the two greatest pilots come across one near Alaska that rips through the robot, eating one of the pilots, forcing his co-pilot BROTHER (now referred to as HeroGuy) out of comission. I forgot something: In order to pilot a Jaeger, you have to be DRIFT COMPATIBLE(TM) with someone. That's because the robots are too intense for one person to pilot. The program uses some sort of mind-melding thing called DRIFTING to link the brains and movements. Person 1 controls the right side, person 2 the left, and they treadmill along while fighting the Kaiju.
A couple years after his brother died, HeroGuy is building a WALL to protect people from the Kaiju (SPOILER ALERT: it's not gonna work) when Captain Chief comes down and tells HeroGuy to come with him to Hong Kong for one last stand. It's in Hong Kong where we meet Dr. Charlie Day, the real human star of the show.
Dr. Charlie Day is trying to get inside the brain of a Kaiju while his buddy Dr. Britishpants is trying to use math to predict the next attacks. We also meet Japanese girl Mori (Moki? maybe it was Moki. Not sure) who HeroGuy can tell RIGHT AWAY is going to make an excellent pilot. One problem: Her mind is not strong enough because when she was about 7 she was chased by Kaiju that was eventually killed by..... CAPTAIN CHIEF. Captain Chief has since refused to give her proper training to make her a pilot because she can't get that day out of her head. HeroGuy demands that she be his co-pilot, but after she nearly destroys THE WHOLE FRIGGIN JAEGER PLANT DURING HER TEST RUN Captain Chief says no.
Fast-forwarding now, there are some awesome fights, Dr. Charlie Day is sent to meet blonde Ron Pearlman who runs the underground dead-Kaiju body-part trade (favorite line: ""A cubic meter of Kaiju crap could fertilize a whole field"") because Dr. Day wants to DRIFT with a Kaiju, a couple of other Jaeger crews are destroyed because the Kaiju are evolving and are now Stage 4, and we come to THE GRAND FINALE.
The pathetic weak humans plan to drop a nuke in to the middle of the Earth under the Pacific Ocean because WHY NOT? EXPLOSIONS! So, HeroGuy teams up with Mori in Gipsy Danger(TM) while Captain Chief teams up with Admiral ForgettableDude in the only other robot left. Maybe it was called Striker. I'm not sure. They swim down to the ocean floor because WHY NOT? and it's there that they encounter... oh my God... a STAGE FIVE KAIJU. They know it's Stage 5 because they still have perfect radio communications with base in Hong Kong even though they ARE ON THE OCEAN FLOOR. Fight, fight, pew, pew, bang boom zap, and the world is saved. Dr. Charlie Day was right, because he is awesome. HeroGuy and Mori live happily ever after.
Now, as to why I was exhausted: Look, maybe it's the IMAX or maybe it comes across the same in a normal theater, but this is the most immersive move I've been to in a long time. I haven't had this much fun since The Avengers, sorry, MARVEL'S THE AVENGERS(tm). My heart was POUNDING during the very first fight. The 3D effect is hardly noticeable. But the visuals and sound and pacing are just spectacular. This is the very definition of a Summer Blockbuster. If you have any interest in fun, go see this movie right now.
I score it 10 out of 10 gigantic swords.",1373760000,2,4193,4.629530201342281
5391000,4,B00A6UHC0U,"I just saw this on the big screen in 3-D and was very pleased.  It was much better than I expected and was accompanied by big clanging and banging sounds as the robots fought against the creaming alien creatures.  The movie was pretty much non-stop battle action.

The robots and aliens are all massive in size.  The robots are controlled and fought by 2 people, synching up the right and left hemispheres of their brain, suiting up, and moving and smashing.  Of course, there are two analytical scientists in the background and a little bit of personal-life discussions.  But the movie is mostly clang and bang and pretty entertaining, especially on the big screen.",1373760000,2,666,4.798245614035087
5391001,5,B00A6UHC0U,"""Pacific Rim"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: When legions of monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot and an untested trainee - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.

The cast led by Charlie Hunnam (as Raleigh Becket), Idris Elba (as Stacker Pentecost) & Rinko Kikuchi (as Mako Mori) is excellent. The directing by Guillermo del Toro (who also produced & co-wrote the screenplay) is excellent. The story by Travis Beacham (who also did the screenplay) & screenplay by Beacham & del Toro is excellent.

The music by Ramin Djawadi is excellent. The cinematography by Guillermo Navarro is excellent. The film editing by Peter Amundson & John Gilroy is excellent. The casting by Margery Simkin is excellent. The production design by Andrew Neskoromny & Carol Spier is excellent. The art direction by Elinor Rose Galbraith, Richard L. Johnson, Andrew Li, Sandi Tanaka & Daryn Wakasa is excellent. The set designs by William Cheng, Rudy Braun, David G. Fremlin, Valdislav Fyodorov, Humberto Garcia, Matt Middleton, Brad Milburn, Sorin Popescu, Andra Totirescu & Evan Webber, set dressings by Toni Wong & Jonathon Stanton is excellent. The costume design by Kate Hawley is excellent. The make-up / creature effects supervised by Francois Dagenais, Jason Detheridge, Steve Newburn & Sean Sansom is excellent. The special effects supervised by Rocco Larizza & Clay Pinney, coordinated by Laird McMurray is excellent. The visual effects supervised by Lindy DeQuattro, John Knoll, Sebastien Moreau, Eddie Pasquarello & Zachary Tucker, coordinated by Paul Alexiou, Joanie Croteau, Ryan Cunningham, Brenda Finster, Rachel Galbraith, Nancy Heller, Anouk L'Heureux, Martine Losier, Karina Mariano, Carol-Ann Ouimet, Jakris Smittant & Mark Van Ee is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Branko Racki (also did the fight coordination), fights coordinated by Racki & Tommy Chang is excellent.

This is an excellent sci-fi action film that is entertaining & interesting. It is also an intriguing (also at times, funny), well-made, well-done and well-crafted film, as well. Guillermo del Toro has made another interesting and intriguing film that is impressive alongside the other films that he has made, thus far. Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba & Rinko Kikuchi lead a solid and well-acted cast, as well, Hunnam & Kikuchi making a solid on-screen team, too. This is one of the best films of the summer season and one of the best sci-fi action films of the year, thus far.",1373673600,,3109,5.1892430278884465
5391002,5,B00A6UHC0U,"In their day, Godzilla, Mothra, and all the rest were great fun. Then the day of the rubber-suit monster passed, and we've been largely bereft of that time-honored tradition since then.

Their day has returned! As usual, you have to swallow a few improbable premises to get the movie going - such as, when attacked by giant monsters, the solution is a fist-fight. You know, a giant fist-fight. But, as suspension of disbelief goes, other movies have asked me to suspend a lot more. Once the premises are in place, this plays by its own rules, right to the incredible finale.

This has all you'd expect in the way of computer effects, giant robots'n'beasts, and horrendous damage to cities (not just Tokyo this time). It has the heroics you'd hope for - brave fighters giving their all. It even has a chaste bit of romance (or at least, potential romance). But it's directed by Guillermo del Toro, the creative force behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B003Y1D7UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>. It has real characters with real histories and feelings, and works them realistically against each other. Except maybe for the two super-scientist types, who seem to be the movie's nod to comic relief. In the end, though, even they get to be heroes in their brave but utterly nerdy way.

del Toro has not just brought the giant-monster movie up to date, he's brought the whole genre up a notch in the rankings of real drama. This is not just an excuse to sit in the theater's air conditioning - it's truly a summer movie to enjoy.

5391014,5,B00A6UHC0U,"The Short: Guillermo Del Toro directs the most entertaining big summer blockbuster in years, proving him further as a master of multiple genres. It's equal parts smart, well directed, unbelievably entertaining and incredibly gorgeous; all coming together to be a heart pounding intense thrill ride that is both vividly original and starkly refreshing as compared to the reboots, sequels and other big budget films of the summer. Pacific Rim proves that there is still plenty of fun to be had at the movies.

9/10

As far as big, dumb, loud summer blockbusters go there hasn't been a solid entry for a long, long time. ""Transformers"" is the obvious comparison here to Pacific Rim, so let's get this out of the way right quick. Transformers, while pretty, is often times a clunky, poorly paced, horribly written, and immature big summer blockbuster film. Characters were weak and laughable, action was cool but often times hard to follow and the inconsistent tone would have driven any film-goer for a loop.

Now enter Pacific Rim, a bold and fresh big summer blockbuster with completely original ideas and technologies, a unique and beautiful visual style, all featuring a time tested conflict and original characters. A bold promise, for sure. But Del Toro and the team have strung together what is quite possibly the best summer blockbuster in years, hands down without question.

What better aspect to talk about first than special effects? Oh man, are they absolutely splendid. The special effects are incredible, unreal at times. Jaegers are designed with intricate detail, glistening in the rain and snow and sleet that they fight in and are brought to life with incredible realism. Moments outside of the action are fantastic too, combining amazing sets and gorgeous backdrops to carry the neo-sci fi style throughout the film. The Kaiju are brought to life with ferocity and gruesome majesty; these big hulking meanies are awesome, ridiculously cool and fun to watch completely obliterate cities. Del Toro is known for his monsters, and Pacific Rim doesn't disappoint.  I especially love the Godzilla vibes I get from Pacific Rim.  The original, directed by Ishiro Honda, would be proud.

One of the other high points is the incredible level of detail seen throughout the film. Every fight scene is sensory overload, with a huge amount of detail from realistic physics applied to building chunks, cars, and other structures that give a sort of tangible weight that is missing from most films of the same genre. The remarkable visuals, produced by Industrial Light and Magic (a sub-division of LucasFilm) has done the impossible: they have brought movie magic to the screen, drenched in class and style unseen in just about every single summer blockbuster for the past few years.

And then there is the earth shattering, bone crushing, kaiju smashing action fight scenes. Multiple times did I yearn to jovially jump up and cheer during the fight scenes like a kid on Saturday morning watching goons getting beat up in a Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers episode (and that's the truth). It's like Rock'em Sock'em robots on an unheard of scale, and it's perfectly balanced and respectively exciting to watch.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the action scenes are just an absolute joy. An absolute, unadulterated, bring-out-your-inner-12-year-old JOY. And it proves that there can still be plenty of fun to be had in a gigantic summer blockbuster. And it simply never stops being a blast. Brining gigantic scale ideas to life is one thing, but putting that into motion, directing the action, the pacing, the character interaction so that it all combines into one incredible experience; Well, very rarely is that ever done well...and here Guillermo struts his expertise and brings the fictional world of Pacific Rim to life.

But the action would fall flat and the pretty images would be filler if it weren't for a convincing human component and a little smarts, which Pacific Rim succeeds mostly to bring that dynamic to the screen. Is it convincing, well written, and well directed? I thought so, in that lovable cheesy summer B movie kind-of way.

The story follows Raleigh Beckett, a former Jaeger pilot out of luck after a major accident involving the kaiju. After some time to see how the other side works and lives, he's brought back to the jaeger team Gypsy Danger for one last crack attempt at stopping the Kaiju. The leading performances here are pretty good, most notably Idris Elba. His performance is strong, one that you can care for and is well written and acted. The rest of the cast, while there aren't any big name stars, is commendable on its diversity (one message that drives forward Pacific Rim), lovable cheesiness and well-acted script. You can feel Guillermo's signature character writing style in every one. Despite how minor, they have a shining moment or two (and a laugh here and there!) Charlie Day (It's Always Sunny in Philly) plays a hilarious comedic relief role but ends up being very important to the crux of the conflict. Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy) does a swell job as the hero and Rinko Kikuichi (Babel, Sideways) is surprisingly strong and well acted as the heroine of the story. Plus, Ron Perlman plays a kaiju black market dealer and is hilarious; a caricature of modern businessmen. And Ellen McLain (Glados of the Portal Series) acts as the Jaeger AI and has a few portal jokes for fans.

The characters are written fairly broadly with a slightly cheesy edge, and are probably introduced too quickly. But that's just the fun of Pacific Rim. It's a well-paced film that never slows down, so the multiple characters keep you on your toes instead of simply just letting your brain go on cruise. There really isn't any baggage or extra fat; the film is trimmed fairly close to perfection so that every scene is important to the story and character growth.

The rest of the elements that make up Pacific Rim are strong too. Ramin Djawadi's epic score is equal parts bombastic and musically memorable. What's cool is that Ramin's score matches up with the action at most points, so major brass drops and orchestra hits line up with the massive smashing punches of the Jaeger vs. Kaiju fights, further producing a cool and very Hanz- Zimmer-y effect. The sound design for the film is top notch too. Sure, it's loud, but there is a method to the madness. Every smash, crash, and subtle movement is in the mix. Dialogue is strong too, and you never have to strain to hear the humans inside the Jaegers. It's a subtle layer that most moviegoers don't even notice, but I greatly appreciate...because it's kind of hard to care about your characters when you can't hear them!

Oh, and a side note. You have to experience this film at least once in IMAX 3D. The sound is incredible, and the bigger screen really brings the conflict to life. But the major attraction, and one of Pacific Rim's biggest accomplishments, is the incredible 3D. This just isn't a foreground and background effect, post processing 3D aftermarket scam. Next to James Cameron's Avatar, Pacific Rim is the best use of 3D I've seen yet. There is a huge amount of depth, and the level of detail is only more apparent when viewing in 3D. I'm sure that most who've seen it will agree, the IMAX 3D experience is a must see!

Is there anything inherently wrong with Pacific Rim? Well, personally, I would've loved to have seen just one more epic fight scene stuck somewhere in the film. But that extra baggage could've pushed the film to the near 3 hour mark. Beggars can't be choosers, I guess! Like I stated before, the characters are a little broadly drawn but it's a more than excusable flaw when the special effects start flooding in.

As I'm flipping through notes and playing the movie back in my head, I can't say that there wasn't a moment where I wasn't entertained. Sure, it's a relatively simple plot, but the level of fun I had in this big monster smash-hit overshadowed any nit-picks I had with the film. It's pure unadulterated entertainment from start to finish, and I wouldn't have Pacific Rim any other way.

5391015,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Being someone who grew up happily watching movies where a guy in a Godzilla suit stomped on cars and bashed buildings, the preview I saw for ""Pacific Rim"" looked like just too much fun to pass up.  This is definitely one movie I am so very glad I went to see, and would love to see it again.
I am going to try very hard not to give anything away here and yet tell enough to let you know just how much fun this movie really is.
First of all, this is not a Godzilla remake or update.  Let's just say it appears the film-maker also grew up watching a lot of old monster movies and loved them.  Not to be disrespectful of Godzilla, you understand, but the Kaiju in this film make our Godzilla look about as scary as the Geico lizard.  They looked amazing, and were genuinely frightening even to a middle aged jaded person like myself.  More than once I found myself with my back flattened against the seat in an attempt to put just a bit more distance between myself and what was on the screen.
In addition, if you are also someone who has enjoyed Anime series like ""The Big O"" and ""Evangelion"", you will find a great deal to enjoy in this movie.  Personally, I was thrilled.
I was not familiar with any of the actors, they were all new to me. I thought they all did a fine job, though.  It is after all an action movie, not a straighforward drama.  Again, trying very hard not to tell too much, but the child who portrayed one of the main characters in the film, during scenes showing her childhood, did a particularly wonderful job.  She had tears welling in my eyes at one point.  There are touching moments in this film, as well as some unexpected humor.  The audience in the movie theater where I attended were laughing out loud at several points.
I really can't say enough about this film.  If you are looking for monsters, giant robots, action, emotion, and just a rockin' great time, this movie can't be beat.",1373587200,7,1913,4.312849162011173
5391016,3,B00A6UHC0U,"Well it's here everyone, my second most anticipated movie of the summer behind the exceptional World War Z. What could possibly be better than a worldwide zombie outbreak starring Brad Pit? How about a summer blockbuster about giant monsters and robots smashing the hell out of each other? It's like someone watched a bunch of anime and decided that, hell yeah, mechs VS monsters is a freaking great idea for a movie and American audiences will eat it up. I mean, how can you screw that up? Monsters, robots, in an anime inspired brawl to the death? Shut up and take my money! But as amazing as that sounds, Pacific Rim, though fun and most certainly enjoyable at times, doesn't quite manage to live up to expectations.

In 2012 a riff opened up at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean through which monsters of enormous size called Kuaji entered the earth and wreaked havoc on our major cities. First San Francisco was destroyed. Six months later, Manila. As time went on more and more Kuaji emerge from the riff to wreak havoc on our shores. In response to this threat humanities governments rallied together to create the Juager program (perhaps after taking too many Juager Bombs) and begin construction on a series of giant robots to battle the Kuaji. And for a while it works. More and more monsters come out of the riff with less time between attacks, and every time they are destroyed by the Juagers. But things have changed. The Kuaji are coming more and more frequently, and the Juagers are being overwhelmed. Twelve years after the initial breach humanity has placed all its hope in a gigantic sea wall around all its shores (which is exactly as stupid an idea as it sounds) and given up on the Juagers. With only four Juagers left operational, and extinction knocking on humanities doorstep, a last ditch effort is made to close the breach once and for all and end the Kuaji threat for good.

What follows is a disjointed, cheesy, fun as hell mess of a film that at the same time is one of the corniest films of the year and one of the most entertaining. Let me get the negatives out of the way now, and please hold off on the crucifixion if you can. The movie spends way too much time focusing primarily on the characters in the film, which would be great had there not been such terrible character development. Okay, that's a bit harsh. They aren't THAT terrible, but with so much time and effort given to them when we could have been watching a giant monster bash the very least Del Torro could have given us was compelling characters and convincing acting. A character driven story of the world's desperate fight against unstoppable odds is not a bad idea, in fact it was done quite well when it was called Neon Genesis Evangelion (for those of you who don't know, it's an anime mech series that has achieved legendary status), but Pacific Rim doesn't even do a passable job in developing its characters into people we'll care about. We do get a couple of touching moments, esp when it comes to female lead Mako Mori (played by Rinko Kikuchi) but all that is done in flashback and very little is done with her adult self. All the other characters are cheap one dimensional cardboard cutouts with no depth, little personality, and nothing at all compelling about them.

""But it's a monster VS robot movie!"" you say. ""Why would you go see this film if you wanted three dimensional characters?"" Well, you have a point.  I didn't go to the movie to see a character driven film. And that's the problem. Pacific Rim tries to be more than that and does focus on its characters a lot more than other movies of this type. It TRIES to be more then Star Trek, or Iron Man, or any of the other mindless summer fare we've seen this year. It just fails at it, and fails badly. EVA this is not. The script is full of pointless tension, cheesy one liners, and wasted characters. It really needed to go through another draft or two before they started filming.

Okay, now that I've got that out of my system, let's get on to what the film did right. For a film like this they really only had to do one thing right and one thing only, and that's the fights. And yes, I'm glad to announce that what fights they did have were actually quite good. Though I do have quibbles with how the monsters were designed, that was quickly forgotten the first time a Juager punched a Kuaji in the face. Such scenes of epic awesomeness are just too much for the human brain to comprehend. The robots are amazing, reflecting their countries of origin in both design, functionality, and tactics. Whereas the Russian Juager is built like a tank and fights in similar fashion, the Chinese Juager is a lot sleeker and uses its speed and many bladed weapons to their advantage. The tech is also interesting as well as the Juagers require two pilots to operate as it would kill a lone pilot. It may seem like a stretch to give a movie three stars for fight scenes alone, but come on. It's a giant monster movie. THIS is what people are paying for, so this is clearly the most important aspect of the film. And Pacific Rim blows it out of the water. I'll call it right now; Pacific Rim is the best live action American movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters. Hands down.

So is Pacific Rim worth seeing? If you want to see robots battle monsters in one of the most epic battle royals of the year, then yes. If not, nooooo. It's a fun movie, with a good deal of action to keep people entertained for a long time. Though the silliness, the bad character development, and the cheesy script hold this film back it does the battles right and that's all people really wanted from this film anyway. Is it a masterpiece? No, not even close. Is it a fun romp of a film with fun battles and amazing effects? Hells yeah it is.

5391017,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Fresh out of the theater, here is what I think about the film itself:

The spectacle of this film is unrivaled. The CGI budget for Pacific Rim must have been enormous, because you see an insane amount of money all over the screen. Everything moves in a way that looks natural, and on a grand scale that your brain sees and understands. The sound design is also first-rate and helps you feel like you're there. The plot is simplistic and standard, but that's a good thing, since it gets out of the way and lets you experience the main attraction of seeing the massive monsters throw down. And thankfully, the action is framed and edited in such a way that you can see and always understand what is happening and who is where. The characters and drama are serviceable for the most part, and don't really drag the film down, but they don't pull at your heartstrings much either. There is a really over-the-top nerd stereotype applied to two characters in a subplot that I didn't really care for, but even they moved the plot forward with vital information about the final mission. I had a big grin on my face for the entire movie, and a lot of people around me were cheering out loud at the great action. If you don't have fun watching this movie, maybe movies aren't for you.

About the blu-ray:

It is not released yet as of 7/12/13, the opening day of the film. However, these days every new movie looks and sounds great on blu-ray. This is not 2006 when people were still figuring out how to use the format and certain transfers were awful. That is really only the case with some older catalog titles at this point. Unless it is botched (very unlikely) this will almost certainly be a fantastic demo disc to show off your audio/video setup. I also hope there is an extended edition blu-ray of this with a little more fleshing out of the main characters (I think 10-15 extra minutes would be fine without dragging things down.) I will update this part of the review when I get the blu-ray.",1373587200,,1989,4.473829201101928
5391018,2,B00A6UHC0U,"Every summer, without fail, there is an epic adventure flick with high ambitions of being the ""next big thing,"" produced with a towering budget, and looking to cash-in on the box office frenzy that runs wild between the months of May and September.  In previous summers, some of the poorly executed, yet commercially successful films like Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Battleship, and Battle: Los Angeles, have managed to create an advertising blitz that brought people to the theaters, only to leave them with a bad taste in their mouths.  Earlier this summer, After Earth tried to cash-in with the off-world futuristic ""epic,"" only to fall flat on its face critically and commercially.  With that being said, it's only natural to see the endless advertisements for Pacific Rim and wonder what it's all about, creating an interest for movie-goers to go check it out.  Is it destined to be the next summer blockbuster, or will the film have audiences begging for ticket refunds by the time the credits roll?

Director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth, Blade II) helms the sci-fi disaster flick, set in the 2020s on planet earth.  For years, gigantic creatures, called ""Kaiju,"" have been rising from the ocean, with little resistance to stop them from devastating earth's cities.  However, humanity has put aside their differences and decided to fight back - building giant robot war machines, called ""Jaegers"" to deal with the rising threat of the massive creatures.  Charlie Hunnam stars as Raleigh Becket, a former robot pilot re-called to action by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps, commanded by Stacker Penecost (Idris Elba).  However, before Becket can return to the front-lines, he must first ""calibrate"" with his new rookie co-pilot, Marko Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Robert Kazinsky, and Ron Perlman also star in supporting roles.

For the ""fanboy kingdom"" out there, Pacific Rim will most likely be their new baby that they will defend to the bitter end - for reasons beyond comprehension.  However, it's the closest thing to authentic Godzilla-like action that anyone has seen in quite a while.  But, as someone that has never been into Godzilla or anything resembling it, I'll be the first to admit that a film like this is out of my element and beyond my typical safety zone.  With that being said, here we go...

Over the course of watching this film, the only thing that really stood out was the fact that countless other movies and television shows reminded me of it.  If you grew up in the 1990s, you most likely recall Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (yeah, I'm goin' there).  Every single time these gigantic robots, ""Jaegars (which instantly make me think about doing shots for some reason)"" would assemble together (prior to going into battle), I couldn't stop thinking about that highly annoying ""Go! Go! Power Rangers!"" theme music.  And, what made it even worse was when the robot started fighting with a giant sword (just like the Power Ranger's Megazord).  I'm not going to lie, these giant sea monsters are battling massive Godzilla-looking monsters for the fate of mankind and all I kept thinking was ""wow, this movie could really use the Pink Ranger right about now.""  Not only did these robots remind me of the zords from the Power Rangers (and Optimus Prime), but their pilots are wearing borderline storm trooper attire.  It's like writer Travis Beacham had just finished watching the Power Rangers boxed set, followed by the Transformers trilogy, and then finished his viewing extravaganza with Real Steel, Battleship and Independence Day (because I couldn't help but notice how Idris Elba's ""touching"" climactic speech paralleled Bill Pullman in ID4).

As long as I'm going to make a Star Wars reference, I might as well comment on how impressive the heavy use of CGI was over the course of this film.  Naturally, Industrial Light and Magic were responsible for the visual effects, so that would explain the correlation to Star Wars (at least in the prequel trilogy).  There is never a point in this film where the robots don't look hip or authentic enough to do their job.  These bots (and there are a variety of them) each feature their own system of weapons, with some being much cooler than others.  There's really no comparison: watching these robots flash some sweet, explosive weaponry always trumps watching them try to beat a monster to death with a pair of steel fists.  And, while the bots are pretty eye-catching, the monsters (Kaiju) were creatively effective in their own right.  Hopefully, Gareth Edwards (directing the upcoming American reboot of Gozilla) has taken note on how to make Gozilla look like a total bad-ass for next year's release.

While it's true, the CGI is extremely commendable on this film, it doesn't negate the fact that Pacific Rim is just another film with an excuse to constantly destroy city buildings and cause random mayhem.  In fact, you can probably set your watch that buildings will be destroyed every ten minutes or so.  One of the biggest beef about Man of Steel was the fact that it spends too much time on destruction and not enough time on plot substance - which is also the main complaint here.  Pacific Rim isn't a character driven film and obviously it wasn't meant to be since it severely lacks Hollywood star power, but something tells me characters are not the big ""draw"" for this film.  Although, on a side note - it is amusing how the whole plot appears to be based around the premise that global warming is essentially to blame for the earth's predicament.

Will Pacific Rim meet its quota for the summer (meaning hit its budget and earn some of that fat Hollywood movie cash)?  With a budget in the $200 million ballpark, it's going to be pretty difficult.  After Earth already failed earlier this year and that flick had Will Smith starring in it.  But, if terrible films, like Battleship and Battle: Los Angeles can do it - then Pacific Rim has a shot to be a successful future franchise.  However, at the end of the day, Pacific Rim is going to cater only to those interested in sci-fi action and sci-fi related genres.  There's absolutely nothing in this film that stands up and says, ""check out this fresh new idea.""  It's just one more lengthy battle flick that shows the earth on the end of its ropes, which is a tiresome tale that can easily cause the average movie-goer to get bored.  However, for the sci-fi lovers out there - Pacific Rim is mostly likely your new favorite movie of the summer.  It features beautiful CGI, a slew of action, and endless possibilities for future films.  In other words, the nerds will be out in force, having a ball, while everyone looks for something better to watch.

5391019,4,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim brings back the monster movie genre with some touches from anime. Following the steps of the popularity of the Transformers films and others that mixed massive action with massive budgets on top of a nerdy nostalgic series. Yet unlike the Transformer films, Pacific Rim doesn't need to insult the audience with crude humor, or exploitative sexual scenes, it only brings great action scenes that are only tarnished by some excessively safe and predictable characters and writing.

The obvious highlight of Pacific Rim are the action filled setpieces, and they do deliver. With most of the action coming in form of one on one combat through fisticuffs, grabs and throws, and even swords, the action is very impactful along with the good sound design. Those scenes themselves are shot relatively clearly, giving space for the scope of the massive combatants yet zooming on in for impacts. That scope of the film is where most of the excitement comes from, the massiveness of the aliens and the resulting robots means that cargo ships are now baseball bats, stadiums are now landing pads, and humans and any traditional vehicles are completely obsolete for combat. This results in a great sense of size when realizing how slow the aliens and robots are from being so massive (elbow rockets!). The only complaint I have of the action is, that despite the whole world seemingly teaming up to take down the aliens, there are only four or five robots that we get to see, which is a shame considering how each robot has different moves and stereotypical pilots. There seems to be a missed opportunity of having a final showdown with at least a dozen or so different countries having their own robots with their own flare to kick some butt.

However, while the action in Pacific Rim is terrific, around a third of the movie in total does a surprisingly good job of dragging the action down with anything that is not giant robots fighting giant aliens. There are about a dozen characters that all fit into their own extremely generic positions in order for the film to go through the motions. The comic relief from Charlie Day hits some occasional marks, and Rinko Kikuchi did a decent job with the script given. Yet I couldn't find myself caring about these characters at all when it was obvious where they were going to end up. But even with all that being said, the lackluster performances and writing, are not bad enough to ruin the movie, in fact it makes the action all the better once it actually gets going again.

All in all bringing back the monster film with Pacific Rim serves as a memorable experience, even after dredging through the boring parts. Go see it in a good theater with some friends, or at least get it on Bluray to push your home setup.",1373587200,,2763,4.728215767634855
5391020,5,B00A6UHC0U,"Pacific Rim 3D Review

Pacific Rim pays homage to the classic Godzilla movies of the past, but also steps up the excitement with three to four intensive Mech versus massive beast battles with spectacular special effects, colossal scale and tremendous urban decimation.

3D Review:
Pacific Rim's 3D utilizes a large portion of 3D computer generated graphics, with humans converted into 3D from a 2D source, combined seamlessly into one incredible 3D experience. The 3D in Pacific Rim is powerful in all the ways a 3D fan could hope for. There is thrilling pop out, depth and dimensions of characters, objects and backgrounds, with lots of particles filling the foreground such as raindrops, water or sparks. The presentation of 3D in Pacific Rim is phenomenal.
3D: 5/5. Comparable to the best in 3D cinema.

Like Del Toro's previous successes, Pacific Rim's characters, story, special effects and frenetic action shine forth thanks to his unique presentation. If you're looking for incredibly massive battles that decimate buildings and create engulfing tidal waves with every impact, backed by a worthy plot, look no further than Pacific Rim.",1373587200,,1142,5.229508196721311
5391021,5,B00A6UHC0U,"If Ray Harryhausen were still with us, I bet he'd be all kinds of giddy over PACIFIC RIM. And, yeah, maybe in some make-believe world, you can hear EVANGELION saying, ""Hey, what the--!?"" That's fine. Even more so than TRANSFORMERS or REAL STEEL or even IRON MAN, PACIFIC RIM is the ultimate expression of the rock 'em, sock 'em robot. And then you throw in the kaiju? Oh, my, it's over. As a fan of giant mechas and them rubber leviathans from the old Toho Studio days, I had to toss objectivity out the window. I defenestrated it.

Somewhen in the near future, collosal monstrous creatures erupt from the ocean depths to ravage humanity and lay waste to our cities. But look at the bright side. These catastrophic attacks result in the world's peoples at last achieving global solidarity. Resources are pooled, brains wracked, and one conclusion reached: size matters.

Required terminology: ""Jaeger"" is German for ""hunter""; ""Kaiju"" is Japanese for ""strange beast"" or ""monster."" PACIFIC RIM opens with a quick history lesson concerning the kaiju's arrival and man's development of the Jaeger project. After some experimentation, it's learned that the workings of a Jaeger construct are so elaborate that two pilots, locked in a neural interface, are required to operate it. We note the rise in popularity of the Jaegers and their pilots, their ascent to superstar status. But then comes their fall from grace.

The story picks up five years later as the kaiju's encroachments have grown even bolder and with the Jaeger project long abandoned. What does it say about the film's star power when the biggest name involved is its director's? Still, the fabulous Idris Elba lends dramatic weight as ""Stacker Pentecost,"" him what runs the tatters of the Jaeger program. You could say he's the, um, Jaegermeister. As you've seen in the trailer, Elba can deliver one of them rousing Henry V Let's Go to War speeches. He sure wants to cancel the apocalypse.

Maybe I'm biased. Maybe I'm predisposed to think well of this film and its performers. I liked the two leads, Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kukuchi. Hunnam is the maverick ex-Jaeger pilot ""Raleigh"" called back to duty, things having gotten so bad his antique Mark III Jaeger is getting dusted off. Kukuchi plays ""Mako Mori,"" the very polite restorer of outdated Jaeger constructs who herself longs to be a Jaeger pilot. Kukuchi is a breath of fresh air. She musters up gratifying doses of spunk when required. More importantly, she counteracts the truckload of testosterone. Hunnam has the less interesting role as the cowboy-type hero, but he and Kukuchi are very watchable when they share screen time.

Guillermo Del Toro shows his devotion to Japanese monster movies. He delivers big time in terms of fan service. I'd be gobsmacked if Japan's box office doesn't explode when PACIFIC RIM debuts there. The scale of the Kaiju and the Jaegers is staggering. The CG is tremendous. In the end I didn't even mind that the only show time left was in 3D. The Jaegers aren't as smooth in their movements as the Transformer robots. There's a lumbering heft to these mechas that settles them in place convincingly. I did have issue with how, occasionally, it's hard to make out what was going on when the Jaegers and the Kaiju were in combat. Maybe too many murky clashes taking place during the night in a downpour. Mostly, though, it IS AWESOME!

And just when the film threatens to get too oppressive or ponderous, Del Toro injects a witty grace note or two. I don't mean those two comic relief scientists played by Burn Gorman and Charlie Day (who seems to channel Bobcat Goldtwaith at his manic best). I loved that fleeting moment with the Newton's cradle in the midst of a city's annihilation. I appreciated the occasional striking character touches, Rinko Kukuchi and Del Toro favorite, Ron Perlman, championing many of these moments. Perlman has a nice extended cameo as an imposing black marketeer who holds court in the neon-lit Bone Slums of Hong Kong.

Some dead spots? A few. Rote dialogue? You betcha. But, mostly, a momentum is maintained, the characters are likable. Again, Idris Elba is very good. Maybe it makes sense that no big name star shows up. The film's gargantuanism should be the prevailing focus, and it takes someone like Del Toro, who'd already impressed both fan boys and the arthouse circuit, to inject a beating heart and a humanistic touch into what could've been a cold, soulless picture. Epochs ago, the dinosaurs were a trial run. In the near future, the clock on the Kaiju War ticks closer to spelling the end of the human race. So hit the theaters, sit back, and observe as a has-been and a rookie try to save the day, afloat in the Drift, caught in a neural handshake.",1373587200,3,4746,4.823095823095823
5391022,4,B00A6UHC0U,"This is RoboCop on steroids! As I watched this advance screener, I mentally scanned my Thesaurus for words that could describe these robots: Herculean, massive, enormous, gargantuan, stupendous, vast, humongus... Do you get the idea? I live on the eighth floor of my downtown condominium and these behemoths (there's another!) would have to stoop to look in my living room!

Earth has been attacked by gigantic monsters who come out of a volcanic rift in the Pacific Ocean. Humankind is helpless to ward them off and the end of the world (as we know it) is fast approaching. Only a handful of now-obsolete Jaegers (Hunters) offer any promise of hope, but each one requires two (2!) compatible operators to make it work.

Guillermo del Toro directed this action-filled (with Computer Generated Imaging) PG-13 Sci-Fi actioner. This is targeted specifically for fans of Sci-Fi actioners and last night, they were entertained! In addition, del Toro included clever bits for the rest of us, like tasteful pretend water drops splashed against a pretend lens, plus subliminal hints of other movies.

We see:
  * Idris Elba (""The Wire"") his rallying cry to his troops is Shakespearean, but we worry about his health. He has only two rules: One, you do not touch me. Two, you do not touch me.
  * Charlie Hunnam (""Sons of Anarchy"") is one of the last Jaeger operators.
  * Ron Perlman (""Drive"") gets the final word, wait for it! And check out those chuntaros (fancy Mexican shoes with extra long, pointed toes.)
  * Max Martini (Lots, and lots, and LOTS of TV) is a veteran in the Jaeger unit.
  * Robert Kazinsky (""Red Tails"") is an egotistical S.O.B. with daddy issues, according to his commanding officer.
  * Charlie Day (""Horrible Bosses"") provides half of the comic relief (and some science) for this doom-laden plot.
  * Burn Gorman (""Game of Thrones"") is the other half of the comic relief.
  * Rinko Kikuchi (""Sideways"") provides the estrogen for this testosterone-soaked story.

As a non-fan of CGI, this became a bit of an endurance test for me (131 minutes), but there were delicious bits of humor and the interaction of the humans was mostly believable (unlike the moment when one of the monsters sprouted wings and gales of laughter erupted from the advance screening audience).

The visual effects are overwhelming. There is hardly any profanity, there are no kisses or sweaty bodies and very little blowie uppie stuff, but endless mayhem as CGI monsters whale the tar out of one another. Whew! Amazon will notify me when the DVD becomes available.",1373414400,4,2554,4.906759906759906
5391023,5,B00A6UHC0U,"If you ever watched a Godzilla movie, or any other giant monster movie, and wanted to see what it might look like with today's special effects, grab your popcorn and check out Guillermo del Toro's ""Pacific Rim.""

In the near future, Earth faces invasion from giant monsters (Kaiju), who emerge from the ocean and wreak havoc on coastal cities.  The humans create giant robot Jaegers to fight them.  For a while this works, but the monsters grow stronger and once again overwhelm the humans.  Pacific Rim follows a former robot jockey who is called back to duty as the human defenses dwindle.....

I've looked forward to this movie for a long time, as I loved the giant monster movies of my youth.  This didn't disappoint.  Interesting and intimidating Kaiju, unique and powerful Jaegers, well choreographed fight scenes, and awesome special effects combine to make this a fantastic summer movie.  There were several scenes which had the audience cheering and applauding.

I've rated this 5 stars because it was exactly what I was looking for.  If you are looking for a deep character-driven film, this might not be for you.  I would question why you are going to a giant monster vs. giant robot movie for that.  If you want to see utter destruction and great fight scenes, you really cant' go wrong with Pacific Rim.

I saw this in the theater in 3D, and while the 3D was prevalent and pretty good, it faltered when the scenes called for 3D and subtitles.  Nevertheless, it is highly worthy not only of seeing in a theater (the scenes will not play as well on a smaller screen) but it is also worth paying the extra price for 3D (something I don't say often).

I got the newest sequel to this film and watched both back to back and this had the best 3D effects mostly because it was 1.85:1 ratio and the newest film is 2.4:1 ratio.
