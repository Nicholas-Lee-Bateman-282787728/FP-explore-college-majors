8543593,4,B009PEQEXO,One of the better amateur travel videos I have watched. Video was good and narration interesting.,1409616000,,97,5.125
8543594,1,B009PEQEXO,This is the last of a perfect trifecta of low-to-no quality discs that we purchased while planning a trip to Germany. And this one is the baddest of the lot. Contrary to the crisp and clear shot on the cover of the disc this seems to have been shot on low quality video or 16mm in the 80s. The video is grainy and out of focus and the narrator sounds like he might be someone's boring uncle who just dropped over for tea and fruitcake and was pressed into duty reading a poorly written script. This is simply a terrible product and should not be even offered by Amazon. Total junk.,1385078400,,581,4.243243243243243
8543595,4,B009PEQEXO,"This was informative but sadly out of date. It did, however show me parts of Germany that I knew nothing about. The background music and inane humor I could have done without.",1372636800,,175,4.5
