8543934,5,B009RPEA3C,"This set of the four symphonies was made in 2012 with the view of presenting Schumann in a new light as a result of deep and penetrating discussion and rehearsal. The orchestra chosen for this project is a chamber orchestra made up of musicians who value their own solo careers. The orchestra is self-governing and is used to having considerable input to their performances. In this way they form a collaboration with their conductors. This has certain similarities with Abbado's relationship with the Lucerne festival orchestra for example. The orchestra itself is about 50 strong and thus is of an appropriate size for Schumann. This is a modern chamber orchestra and there is no attempt to reproduce the sound world attempted by the 'authentic' movement such as with the Gardiner CD set for example.

There are a number of bonus films included with this set and these set out to enlarge on this approach to Schumann and the use of the venue etc. To do this there is an emphasis placed upon the views of Jarvi and individual orchestral members who illustrate their points with musical extracts. A clear attempt is made to relate all of this with the character of Schumann, a complete Romantic figure within music and beyond. There is also an interesting feature on Bremen as an industrial and cultural centre.

The performances of the music are expertly done with all of this in mind. The playing style is very disciplined with crisp enunciation, sharply underlined accents and tempo changes and a general clarification of textures. There is no evidence of the thick scoring that Schumann used to be criticised for in the past. This would also be true, not only of either Gardiner or Goodman with their authentic orchestras, but also of perceptive conductors with modern orchestras. Even Szell with his larger modern orchestra kept textures clean and tempi lively.

So in these performances we get a very good set of performances presented in a way that many will already be familiar with. The 'newness' is not really a revelation to those used to the Gardiner set which I would suggest is obligatory listening for any student of the Schumann sound. The first symphony is lively and light on its feet as is appropriate to the chosen subject. The second symphony is correctly darker with the most dramatic approach of the four. This is also appropriate. I personally think this has the edge over the similarly sized and engaging performance by Ashkenazy and included as part of a standard orchestral concert.

The third is a fine performance, again fairly sprightly but also with sonorous moments as in the trombone choral episodes. The horns are also rightly more highlighted in the symphony. I prefer this to the Harding one seen as part of an 'Homage' concert to Schumann. The fourth symphony is also light on its feet and is heard here in its much revised and familiar later version. This is a very successful performance and brings the set to a rousing conclusion. I personally find this a far more involving experience than that in the Chailly concert which includes an excellent concerto with Argerich as its highlight.

The sound is full ranging and presented in very clear DTS 5.1 and stereo. The camera work and imaging is engaging and offers tremendously clear detail.

Overall I found this a very engaging set which contains the most individually satisfying performances of all four symphonies so far available on video disc. The alternatives all come within mixed concerts so there is no actual comparison possible of a single disc collection of all four works. There are very good CD alternatives which should not be forgotten, notably those by Gardiner and Szell. These do not have imaging but have more music, good sound (excellent in the case of Gardiner) and fine performances of character. The Gardiner performance in particular gives an even greater insight into Schumann's sound world as it uses a highly experienced and top quality 'period' orchestra.

I would suggest therefore that this very generously filled disc is of excellent quality and value and will be a hard act to follow, let alone beat within its chosen formats. I would therefore suggest that it will give a great deal of satisfaction to a great number of purchasers. For that reason a 5 star assessment seems completely reasonable for what is likely to be a very attractive proposition for anyone interested in a specifically visual program. However for those particularly interested in the period aspects of the sound in any format I would suggest that the Gardiner version on CD is far more illuminating and includes far more music, especially the fine but rarely played Konzertstuck for four horns and all in splendidly vivid sound.",1364774400,2,4724,4.92713567839196
