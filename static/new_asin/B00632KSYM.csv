4934188,4,B00632KSYM,"Just a heads up, Alexander is split on two discs. Disc one has the first two hours of the film, and disc two has the last hour of the film plus extras (see this thread for more info: [...]. You'll have to swap out discs to watch the entire final cut. All three films share one thick case with a slipcover. Each movie has its special features. Picture and audio quality are great for all three films. For under $17, its a great deal, even though Alexander is average at best.",1327363200,43,474,4.21978021978022

4934219,5,B00632KSYM,"This isn't really a review, but as I found the product description lacking, I decided to compile this list of helpful information below. I hope this will be useful for prospective buyers to know what they're getting:

ALEXANDER (Director's Cut) (2004): 175 minutes - Director: Oliver Stone - Starring: Colin Farrell, Jared Leto, Angelina Jolie - Genre: Epic, history - Plot: A sprawling epic about the life of Alexander the Great, one of the greatest conquerors the world will ever know. R

TROY (2004): 163 minutes - Director: Wolfgang Petersen - Starring: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom - Genre: Epic, action - Plot: An adaptation of Homer's great epic, the film follows the assault on Troy by the united Greek forces and chronicles the fates of the men involved. R

300 (2006): 117 minutes - Director: Zack Snyder - Starring: Gerard Butler, David Wenham, Lena Headey - Genre: Epic, action - Plot: A visceral and stylized retelling of the last stand of 300 Spartan warriors vs. a force of innumerable Persian invaders led by their god-king Xerxes. R

Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $9.96, and contains 3 films. To find the value of the individual film you're getting, we divide the price by the number of films to get an individual price of $3.32 per film, an amazing deal for these action packed and incredibly entertaining Greek epics! I hope this information is useful to you. Cheers!",1418947200,12,1416,4.863070539419087

4934223,1,B00632KSYM,"I am dissatisfied with the quality of the movies, which are not even close to the Bluray quality (especially for both 300 & Alexander Revisited, whereas Troy was excellent) and wish to file an official complain regarding this matter.",1415059200,,233,5.0
4934224,4,B00632KSYM,"Troy and 300 are classics.

I previously posted that I found Alexander's blonde hair out of keeping with the period. Others promptly responded his hair was in fact blonde-like - due to (some say) a curry seasoning dye. Whatever. Still doesn't look or feel right for the period. Maybe I have to try the curry dye?",1412553600,,312,4.571428571428571

4934232,5,B00632KSYM,I loved this idea of putting 3 movies such as these on one bluray.  I had seen all movies and wanted to purchase them at some point BUT being able to have all 3 in one box is wonderful :o),1401667200,,188,3.7
4934233,5,B00632KSYM,Exactly as description said it would be. I really enjoyed watching these movies. Especially the first 300. This is sparta!,1397174400,,122,5.15
4934234,5,B00632KSYM,3 movies In one bundle.  That's great.  haven't watched troy or alexander yet but I will eventually. Alexander is on 2 cds not sure why but just letting you know,1396742400,,161,4.333333333333333
4934235,5,B00632KSYM,What a bargain for such a low price. You get all three disc's. And in blu-ray picture quality. So you cant loose with this set.,1396224000,,127,4.12
4934236,5,B00632KSYM,I really only got this for 300. I saw Troy as a kid and never really got it. Alexander too I saw a clueless kid. I enjoyed 300 a lot. But Troy and Alexander seemed kinda on the weird side.,1394236800,,188,3.725
4934237,5,B00632KSYM,"Loved the triple features film. If you don't have any of these movie and need an excuse to buy one of the film, I would suggest this bundle to add to your collection.",1393200000,,166,4.0606060606060606
4934238,5,B00632KSYM,"This is the best deal for three great classic movies on blu ray.
I am highly recommending this box set.",1392768000,,103,4.2
4934239,5,B00632KSYM,"Who wouldn't want these movies on blu-ray. The action, stars, & any scenes are awesome. I'm glad that I saw this.",1391126400,,113,4.428571428571429
4934240,4,B00632KSYM,"This is my type of movie, and the recent announcement of a sequel to 300 makes it all that much better. The films are good entertainment and the Blu-ray quality is okay.",1390953600,,169,4.3125
4934241,4,B00632KSYM,Three great ancient battle movies in one package.  Awesome action scenes.  Make a weekend out of it.  What else do you want?,1390867200,,124,4.545454545454546
4934242,1,B00632KSYM,"are not 3D and yet I received this item in 3D case. Which lead me to believe that the item I received was bought, opened, switched, repackaged, then sent back. Good movies but I wasn't expecting a repackaged blu-ray. If I'm buying something new, I expect it to be new.",1388620800,2,268,4.38
4934243,5,B00632KSYM,I can't believe I didn't find this sooner! I love all 3 of these movies and to find them all together and on Blu-Ray was like hitting the jackpot for me. A freaking steal at $9.99 too!,1387756800,,184,4.0
4934244,4,B00632KSYM,"The packaging of these three loosely-related-genre movies into one 4-disc package makes for an attractive price-per-movie. The video is, as nearly always, superior to the DVD versions. The audio may be as well but I haven't done any A-B comparison (I already owned Troy and had rented the other two in the past). I haven't watched Alexander yet but have read here it is split across two discs so you have to change mid-movie. I personally don't find this to be a big deal - that's what happens when a movie gets really long (remember Lord of the Rings on DVD, I think it was 3 movies discs?). There are other things in my life that are far, far more annoying than having to get up once during a 3 hour-ish movie. As for whether you'll like the content of the movies themselves, that's subjective, go read IMDB.",1387584000,,810,4.47972972972973
4934245,5,B00632KSYM,It is an excellent idea to use technology today. Having three close by plot movies in blu-ray format was great idea. All the three movies came in a high quality picture and sound and an excellent condition. I like this idea three in one and highly recommend the seller - fast and proper delivery. Thank you for this great combination!,1387152000,3,334,4.583333333333333
4934246,5,B00632KSYM,2 1/2 great movies for a great price!  I like Troy the best!  Movies arrived on time and I have no complaints.,1386720000,,110,3.9545454545454546
4934247,4,B00632KSYM,"I got it on Black Friday for only $6.83 haha

The thing I like the most besides of the price of course, is the outer box cuz of its design.

It's a good deal if you ever see it on sale or something. And Alexander comes in 2 different discs btw.",1386633600,,244,3.764705882352941
4934248,5,B00632KSYM,"There isn't much I can say here. The movie was great on the big screen and is great still on my 60"" TV.",1386547200,,103,3.5217391304347827
4934249,5,B00632KSYM,I BOUGHT THIS BLU-RAY DVD BECAUSE IT HAS 3 GREAT MOVIES ON THEM. I HAD 300 AND TROY IN BLU-RAY AND DVD BUT NOW I HAVE THEM ALL IN BLU-RAY!,1385596800,,138,3.6333333333333333
4934260,3,B00632KSYM,"300 is a great movie.  Alexander its also entertaining but Troy is boring and very long.
Great prize though.  If you like just two of the movies it is worth it.",1378857600,,160,4.129032258064516
4934261,5,B00632KSYM,"I love the three-for-one deals.  I bought this for 300.  Troy was watchable.  Alexander is a disaster which I wasted an hour on before finally shutting it off.  Still, for the price, this is a great value.",1373760000,,205,4.45945945945946
4934262,5,B00632KSYM,"As for me, I thought three blu-rays for this cheap was a steal. I recommend this to any fan of these types of movies.",1371168000,,117,3.9166666666666665
4934263,5,B00632KSYM,"Quality esp. on Troy is excellent!!, I bought this mainly for Troy, but the others included made it to good to pass up, good way to spend an uneventful night. Well worth the price",1366156800,,179,4.294117647058823
4934264,5,B00632KSYM,"The quality of these blu-rays is decent.  The only complaint I have is the movie ""Alexander"", I think casting Colin
Farrell was a mistake.  He comes off less as a leader and more as a self-serving pretty boy.  No wonder this film didn't get the reviews it hoped for!",1366156800,,266,4.387755102040816
4934265,5,B00632KSYM,"Recommended to those who like epic movies. These are the best price and having them all together with the best picture quality possible. You will enjoy the movies, they are fantastic!",1366156800,,183,4.935483870967742
4934266,4,B00632KSYM,"300 is an amazing visual buffet.  In Blu-ray it is so awesome you will go catatonic watching the great story and action.

I though Troy was an average movie but to watch it in Blu-ray makes it a whole different film.

As for Alexander . . . Meh.  Well it does make a nice coaster.",1365292800,,280,4.036363636363636
4934267,4,B00632KSYM,"One of these three movies suck, in my opinion... but the other two are quite welcome additions to my home library. Well priced!",1364947200,,127,4.565217391304348
4934268,5,B00632KSYM,"Love all 3 movies!  Owned them all on DVD and really wanted them in Blu-ray, just didn't want to pay too much.  This triple pack was just the ticket!  Great movies at a GREAT price!!!",1364860800,,183,4.171428571428572

4934278,5,B00632KSYM,"The Blu Ray enhancements for these films is incredible  I got Troy extended version on DVD and this blu ray version hammers it into the ground like Atlas (from the film) hammered that guy on the horse on the beach battle scene!  Great quality.
 As for 300 I think it was a vast improvement over the versions I've seen such as on HBO or such.
 And Alexander Revisited was wonderfully done ... you could count the hairs on their heads pretty much on this blu ray version",1364256000,2,468,4.344827586206897

4934321,5,B00632KSYM,I just bought a blu-ray player and am starting my collection. This is a great way to do it. I've seen two of the three and the quality is really good!,1357603200,,150,3.870967741935484
4934322,5,B00632KSYM,"How can Alexander Revisited, Troy, or 300 not be considered great on Blu-ray? The fact that all three came in a pack... AWESOME!",1357171200,,128,4.608695652173913
4934323,5,B00632KSYM,"Great movies, but 300 resembles a little bit a cartoon movie, However, I enjoyed all three movie but more Troy and Alexander!",1357084800,,125,4.7272727272727275
4934324,5,B00632KSYM,I bought this because its three great blu rays in one. Great deal. I bought another one just like it.,1356220800,,101,4.1
4934325,5,B00632KSYM,"The movies cam in perfect condition. I had got this movie pack because of Troy. Hadn't noticed that it was the director cut, which is just a longer slightly augmented version of the movie. Still a good movie",1355270400,,207,4.473684210526316
4934326,5,B00632KSYM,"Aside from Alexander Revisited, this is an awesome movie 3 pack! Couldn't ask for much better of a movie deal!",1346889600,,110,4.55

4934329,5,B00632KSYM,"3 of my favorite war epics all for one low price in high-def. Movies look phenomenal on bluray and the package only cost 14$ with shipping. 300 is an instant, violent classic while Troy keeps you on the edge of your seat. Alexander is a tad slow, but if you pay attention you'll learn to appreciate it. GREAT DEAL",1340409600,6,313,4.322033898305085
4934330,3,B00632KSYM,"I wanted to mention that the disc quality is regular, single disc convinced me Troy and Alexander, not that the quality of the image of ""300 is low,"" perhaps for that price. Otherwise regular.",1339977600,,192,4.676470588235294
4934331,5,B00632KSYM,"I bought it mainly for Troy, and 300. It was a bargain.

They look pretty good at 1080p. I haven't seen Alexander, but its about 4hrs long!",1337817600,,139,4.148148148148148
4934332,3,B00632KSYM,"Found at a warehouse store for about $12.

I was most interested in owning 300, followed by Troy, and least interested in Alexander.

Unfortunately, I would say Alexander has the best picture quality, followed by Troy which is ""okay"".  But the picture quality for 300 is almost shockingly bad.  Very grainy images throughout, and some scenes have a little brightness flickering.",1336176000,5,378,5.147540983606557
4934333,5,B00632KSYM,Excellent Picture and Sound Quality for all the movies. Worth Buy if looking for a good collection of 2 movies mainly out of the 3.,1332806400,,131,4.28
4934334,4,B00632KSYM,Excellent quality and all three movies in one package.  Be advised that Alexander takes two Blu-Ray discs and is quite a long movie.,1330819200,,132,4.739130434782608

8491634,5,B00632KSYM,"I bought this movie collection specifically so I could have a Blu-Ray copy of the movie ""Troy,"" with Josh Groban's enchanting song ""Remember Me"" in the end credits, as presented in the theatrical release.  Well guess what?  The Groban song is not there anymore in the Blu-ray!  Removed by copyright issues, I guess. Fortunately, I still have the original Troy DVD, which does include the original soundtrack and the Groban end song.  The movie is just not the same without it.  Never thought I would view a DVD over a Blu-ray, but I will in this case.",1510358400,,551,4.639175257731959
