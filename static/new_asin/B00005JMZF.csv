The Sitcome takes place in evening school for foreigners trying to learn the language. This brings the different ways of how the different cultures makes us think and act.
Look specially for the Pakistani VS. Indian. They are the focal point of the whole Sitcome.
I cannot wait for the release. I shall own all the availbale episodes on DVD. (...)",1085011200,,485,4.7176470588235295

1505223,5,B00005JMZF,"Being from a third world country, we were not introduce to the show when it first aired, but we got the chance to watch it in the 1980's. I had fun watching it then and I love watching it now. I get my American friends to watch it with me and they love it. Is there any more DVD's or is the volume 4 the last one? If anyone who reads this knows the answer, could you post your reply? Thank you in advance!

1505224,5,B00005JMZF,"I was telling my husband about this show and he said he didn't know about it at all. Not sure if it was aired here in Canada(I've been here only 3 years..I am from the far east). So when I saw it here on Amazon, I thought...hmm..it is about time !!.
MYL isn't only a good sitcom, it is to me a portion of a fond memory that is stored in my head forever. It is about a group of very different people in a classroom, learning that one language - English. The teacher was a good-natured guy(salute to Mr. Barry Evans who died in 1997) and was quite funny sometimes and often got himself confused after talking to some of his students.
What I like about it is the natural way all of them portrayed about themselves and each other. Some of them would often come into disagreements due to their race and country and background but in the end they always stood up for each other.
A show like this if made nowadays, I believe would arise some dissatisfaction among people but back then people were able to take it and much more importantly learned from it !. Makes me realize how people have changed...
However I am glad the DVD is out!. I wish ALL episodes are in it though but I'm quite happy for most of them are. Sometimes When I heard the opening theme, I would close my eyes and I could see my family sitting in front of the TV back home, quite late at night waiting to see what humor we could get that night.
How I miss those days !!....",1116374400,17,1436,4.169064748201439
1505225,5,B00005JMZF,"very pleasantly surprised to see available on D.V.D
I had some V.H.S copies I,d bought in England had changed over
But to see this show which I feared was forgotten on disc, four in total twenty six eps was great
the late Barry Evans (Doctor in the house)plays the teacher Mr. Brown, as he tries to hold together his multi racial class of adult english language students with hillarious results
hardly brain surgery, but lots of fun
the americans tried to make there own version
Starring Rob Scneider (S.N.L) which did not match the success or wit of the original",1113091200,,563,4.64

1505228,5,B00005JMZF,"Being a foreigner in two country where english is the spoken language, this work of art helped to take an ESL class while having fun, it helped me to improve and increase not only my spoken but grammar English in the same process. My hope is that most ESL class can make good use of this work of art as a didatic material to teach ESL class. I was watching a taped marathon of about 6 hours of Mind your language without minding the time.

1505229,5,B00005JMZF,"Yes! Almost 28 years after it first aired, this gem of a show comes to DVD - for North American fans anyway. In case you don't know, Mind Your Language is the British comedy about a young, inexperienced teacher Jeremy Brown who tries to teach English to a bunch of adult internationals at night school, while contending with the very stiff and proper night school principal, Miss Courtney. Playing off stereotypes and completely politically incorrect, the results are hilarious to say the least.

This DVD edition contains Series 1 - 3, which aired originally from 1977 - 1979. There are a total of 26 episodes here, and from what I can tell, the DVD set is actually 3 episodes short of the total 29 episodes that originally aired. Series 4 which originally aired in 1986, is not included. And if you are looking for extras and special features, you won't find it here either. But who cares? No complaints here - the picture is sharp and clear, and of course the humor is unbeatable. I love it!",1108684800,19,994,4.6158192090395485
1505230,5,B00005JMZF,"In the year of (( 1977 )) was proved to world that UK Comedian shows is BORN AGAIN ! Many successful British Comedy TV shows , but with this SHOW the matter has been different ... (Filled with laughs)Much of the comedy derives from the different accents , It was a successful performance and very entertaining.
- Abu Jarrah (MaximusQ8) is Laughing - specially, Hussain Nadheen played the role of Mr Brown (the teacher) pretty well. Also Farhan Mahboob, who played Ali, the student from Pakistan, gave a lively rendition. Ali's role was very strong and therefore I did not see any mistakes in the other players. I couldn't take my eyes off Ali because he was the most important and amusing character. The other players helped him to develop his role. Ranjith, Max, Rejini, Divani, Siripala, Sid, Sulli, Juanita and all the others helped them.
The wonderful Series for this British comedy ""Mind Your Language"", actually has be made for old generations , ""Mind Your Language"" STILL ... trade mark in the World Comedy Elements !
LOL .. & .. ""Laugh Out Loud"" again !",1089331200,3,1061,4.709677419354839

Mr Brown and Ms Courtney are hilarious. I grew up watching this in Tanzania,  East Africa (go figure). Another classic is The Black Adder with Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean to some of you). This is a bundle of laughs. Get ready for some really cocky British Humor.",1086652800,,434,4.564102564102564
