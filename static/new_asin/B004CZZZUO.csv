8424513,5,B004CZZZUO,"Anything Arliss is going to be enjoyable. Great to watch these when your in the mood for some early talkies. Because of the limitations of early microphone much of the staging is somewhat stiff as the actors couldn't roam far from the microphone hidden in a potted plant. Perfect for Arliss though as he can entertain just with 10 minutes of facial expressions such as he does wonderfully in a close shot in the movie ""Old English"".",1496793600,,432,4.623376623376624

8424517,5,B004CZZZUO,"This is a fine collection of three of George Arliss' twenty some odd films.  Whether he's acting, directing, or writing, George Arliss is one of the finest artists of his time.  If you are a fan of movie history beginning in the 1920's and '30's, you must add this to your collection.  I certainly hope that the rest of his films will also be offered, as all of them are fabulous.",1297900800,16,380,4.323943661971831
8424518,4,B004CZZZUO,"This is an interesting selection of movies featuring stage actor George Arliss which were filmed rather early on during the talkie era.
As I am a fan of silent movies and pre-1950 talkies, this was a good choice for me as these films are rarely aired on television or the cable giant TCM. The quality of all three films are o.k., as none have been remastered.
What makes this an interesting set is that all three films are considered comedies. As Arliss was primarily considered a dramatic actor and his best known films were in the dramatic vein, it is interesting to see him handle comedy with a low-key flair that reflects his wry sense of humor.
Considering the plots of these films which have relatively simple premises as well as their age and the public's perception of humor back then, the movies are actually pretty entertaining and will appeal primarily to film buffs.",1295827200,16,878,4.707792207792208
