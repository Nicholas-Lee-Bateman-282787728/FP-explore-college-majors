2524354,5,B000ENV534,"""Waiting for God"" is the ultimate BBC comedy on aging.  Tom Ballard(Graham Crowden) and Diana Trent (Stephanie Cole) wreak havoc in and around the Bayview Retirement Community, much to the chagrin of Harvey Baines (Daniel Hill) who runs the place and the confusion of Jane Edwards (Janine Duvitski).  Please take note:  the series has a definite beginning, middle, and end.  Most of the episodes do stand alone - however, I would like to suggest seeing them in order. IF YOU HAVEN""T SEEN THE FIRST SERIES/SEASON, YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER THAT BEFORE WATCHING THESE!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-for-God-Season-1/dp/B000EOTUTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting for God - Season 1</a>

For those who already know Tom & Diana, there is no better treat than a return trip to the Bayview Retirement Community ""for the almost dead."" The second series should include ten episodes of the battle for respect as waged by Tom and Diana. Some of the hijinx in store from the second season discs include the introduction of Daisy for two episodes (""just what I need - a real life Major Barbara banging about the place"") who increases a rift between Tom & Diana; Tom's policy of telling ONLY the WHOLE truth; and the hilarious hip operation which conflicts with Sarah's wedding.  However, there are three must-have episodes:  ""Glamourous Grannies"" in which Diana bets Tom she can be nice to everyone for a week; ""Young People"" which involves Harvey's latest scheme to be rid of Diana on the grounds of morality; and finally, ""The Boring Son,"" in which Tom's son Geoffrey (Andrew Tourell) leaves his wife and moves in with Tom driving everyone nuts in the process.

The British have a wonderfully understated way of presenting the trials and hassles of aging.  This series is the best to come over from England, and let's hope A&E/BBC continue to release the show!",1180656000,9,1906,5.243421052631579

2524362,5,B000ENV534,"The English do  great job on Comedies, much better the the garbage we produce (Lately). Then can take a serious situation and find  humor  in it.  The script is good and so are the actors!  This is one of the few series worth collecting.",1390521600,,237,4.295454545454546

2524364,1,B000ENV534,"I strongly disliked season 2 of waiting for god. I loved every episode of season 1; howeever, I found all except the very last episode of season 2 offensive, in bad taste, and painful. I felt worse after watching it. Don't get it - get season 1.",1344297600,,245,4.23404255319149
2524365,5,B000ENV534,"Oh dear what a travesty. Waiting for God is one of my favorite BBC Comedies *OF ALL TIME*.

Everyone should grow old as ungracefully and STUBBORNLY INDEPENDENT as Diana Trent.
And may we all have someone as Colorful in our Lives as TOM when we reach our GOLDEN years.

Trust me, you won't regret watching this. I'm so happy to see it on Prime Streaming for my Fire.",1327795200,2,365,4.352941176470588
2524366,4,B000ENV534,"I fell in love with this series and shared it with many people. Started buying the CD's. In Series Two, the Track 7 is damaged which is the only reason I'm rating it a 4, the series deserves a 5 unreservedly.  I've had it reshipped 3 times but we're still unable to view that show. Bummer",1270944000,,288,4.142857142857143
2524367,5,B000ENV534,"this is an outstanding series and with Season 2 it continues to be topnotch. Great acting - it's downright funny and we find ourselves laughing out loud. At the same time, it tackles real life issues that might be very difficult to hear about if not handled with so much humor and dry wit. Elderly people are even more disparaged in the U.S. than in the U.K. and so it all goes double. However, not preachy - just a fun take on how a few old timers fight the system and frequently win. Highly recommend",1242086400,,502,4.294736842105263
2524368,5,B000ENV534,"Each season gets better and better.  Diana is my Guru...I want to be just like her when I grow up!!  I love Stephanie Cole and I wish I could see more of her TV shows.  I would really love to see ""Tenko"", it looks really good, but it is not released in America, yet.  I wish it would.  ""Keeping Mum"" also looks very good.",1236297600,,321,3.953125
2524369,5,B000ENV534,"Waiting For God is a True Gem among the British or any other TV comedies!!  Stephanie Cole is wonderful in her role.  I can only imagine what a British retirement home is like, but if it is like this count me in-I want to go!  A brash,sometimes rude and sarcastic, sensitive, caring environment is portrayed here.  This is a must for fans of TV comedy and in particular British Comedy!!",1209686400,,386,4.4714285714285715
2524370,5,B000ENV534,"This British comedy is no longer shown on PBS where I live and I've really missed watching it!  Inasmuch as I live in an Assisted Living home, it is even more entertaining now.  There are so many similarities to reality in both plot and personalities.  What fun!!",1209600000,,263,4.553191489361702

This series is delightful and filled with laughs.",1206403200,,90,4.6875
2524372,5,B000ENV534,"I'm a true Brit Com Fan and this is one serious I had never seen!  I'm a bit irritated that we can't get the rest of the series, but these ones are well worth getting even if they leave you hanging for a few years until they allow us Americans to own the rest of the series!  Great laughs it will have you rolling on the floor! This is a MUST HAVE series!",1206057600,,355,3.8493150684931505

2524374,5,B000ENV534,"Absolutely love British sit-coms in general, but Waiting for God is simply the best!!!  There's no one like Diana and Tom to put life in its proper perspective.  Great series!  Great DVD of season two.  Be sure to get season one as well!",1196812800,,237,4.441860465116279
2524375,5,B000ENV534,"Witty, Sarcastic, Outrageous and always fun to watch and laugh to.  Belly laughs abound yet the underlying sadness of existence in a place waiting for God is everpresent.  Graham Crowther is a wonderful Tom and Stephanie Cole is bitter, sarcastic and lovable as Diana.  These episodes are great to watch and rewatch.",1196380800,,316,5.038461538461538
2524376,5,B000ENV534,This series is one of the best from the BBC and never fails to delight.  Tom's ever-present optimism and Diana's determined cynicism balance each other perfectly and my only problem is waiting for the next season to come out on DVD.,1191369600,,232,4.658536585365853

2524378,5,B000ENV534,"Continuing on an amazing first series, series two is just as strong, clever and a great show for anyone worried about aging to watch. Showing a real portrait of aging and how we don't have to resign ourselves to being boring old fuddies is an important lesson for our society to learn. Can't wait for the next three series.",1190160000,,323,4.491525423728813
2524379,5,B000ENV534,This is a wonderful series.  You can't beat British humor.  I look forward to purchasing the remaining seasons when they are available.,1186617600,,135,5.090909090909091
2524380,5,B000ENV534,"This comedy is absolutely one of the best satires I have ever seen! I used to watch bits and pieces of it when I was little, along with ""Keeping Up Appearances"" which I currently own the entire collection. I wish that this series was sold as a complete collection. As of yet it seems seasons 3-5 haven't been released in the US. I really hope they release them soon! I'm just dying to complete this GREAT collection!",1185408000,,416,4.415584415584416
2524381,5,B000ENV534,"I haven't actually watched this series, but I hear about it all the time from my mom. (It was a birthday present.) She raves about it. I enjoy listening to her tell me about what's happening, because she becomes really animated! She obviously gets quite a kick out of it...",1184976000,,273,4.48
2524382,5,B000ENV534,"Waiting for God is totally enjoyable. Imagine a home for retired people managed by a totally self-serving man who bullies his staff and attempts to bully the two stars of the show, Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden. Ms. Cole has been the bane of everyone's existence there for a long time and when she is joined by Graham Crowden, they create havoc for everyone. Crowden's ineffective son and vicious daughter-in-law add to the interest as does Ms. Cole's niece. Altogether a most delightful program. Excellent acting, writing, and directing.",1184198400,5,542,5.101123595505618
2524383,5,B000ENV534,"When I am an ""old lady"" I want to be just like Dianna!  This is quite possibly one of the funniest British comedies out there.

8111708,3,B000ENV534,I loved the show when I watched it on TV. This season so far (I've watched three episodes) have not been a funny as I remember. Ms. Cole has not yet developed her very sarcastic tones as yet.,1521244800,,191,4.052631578947368
