8009274,1,B0001ARE26,"The guy just rambles on about his own band and what he tought of nirvana he is a real creepy guy. Plus it's so low budget and it's retarded it doesn't even say what songs he's playing. He just lables every thing by riffs. Plus he goes through everything sooooo fast he doesn't even say what frets he on or anything. The dvd just seems like ""hey look at me I can play nirvana"" It's one of the worst dvds of all time.",1215129600,,415,4.0120481927710845
8009275,1,B0001ARE26,"I bought this DVD beaucuse I really love Nirvana's music. However, it is a lousy instructional movie with low budget. From the picture quality to the clothes on the instructor is just plain - cheap. Curt Mitchell started off the DVD rambling on and on about Kurt Cobain for the first 5 mins, which does not have anything to do with Nirvana's guitar skills. The rest of the DVD just him played riffs after riffs. I doub other DVDs in this ""Guitar Method"" series worth any good either. This is just some cheap DVD made by this company to profit from huge bands. Save yourself some bucks. Instead purchase Nirvana sheet music and play along their CDs.",1107993600,14,648,4.547008547008547
