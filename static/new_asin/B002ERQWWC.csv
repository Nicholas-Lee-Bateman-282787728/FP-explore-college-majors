3919377,5,B002ERQWWC,"My daughter is absolutely obsessed with Word World. She will be 2 in a few days and has been a dedicated Word Friend for about 4 months now. I am not one for TV shows aimed at little ones, but sometimes you just need something to keep them occupied so you can make dinner! We stumbled across Word World one day on PBS and I thought is was adorable. I then found out from my girl friend (who is a Kindergarten teacher) that her son watched it everyday and was starting to learn reading concepts from it. So, despite not wanting a ""TV Zombie"" I started letting my little girl watch it. She has loved it from day one. She has learned that those squiggly shapes are called ""letters"" and when you put them together something happens... which is pretty good for an almost 2 year old! Again, I am not a huge children's television plan and am very picky about what my daughter watches. I am also a special education teacher, so my background makes me even pickier. Word World is one of the few shows I think is worth anything as it is educational, fun, and teaches nice life lessons. We got this DVD for my daughter's birthday and already know she will love it. I HIGHLY recommend Word World to anyone!!!!",1260316800,18,1197,4.348214285714286
3919378,5,B002ERQWWC,"If you or your friends have active children, they will love the way this series teaches. My friends children are mimicking and repeating the songs and dances and the letters perfectly and with understanding of the visual meanings, as well as some of the words. Very well produced product.",1257552000,3,288,4.8979591836734695
3919379,4,B002ERQWWC,"I purchased one of these at a store for our daughter, just to see what it was. She enjoyed watching it. The great thing about it was that it came with a paper fold out map, which went along with the DVD, so in that way, it was interactive, she could follow what the dog (and other) animals were doing, and what letter they were searching for. This set does not contain the maps, but at this low price for all of them, they will still teach your kids / toddlers some great lessons.",1255478400,3,480,4.117021276595745

3919401,5,B002ERQWWC,"The first couple of times I played the discs, my 2 kids were not so into them as previously they were exposed to the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and Leapfrog series. Now, they are supplementing Word World with their other programs and I'm confident that they will learn to love it as the days go by.

Plus, I was pleasantly suprised to see on the back DVD cover that the program was an Emmy Award winner.",1405382400,,399,4.32

He has learned a lot of letters from watching and I even like to watch the show, too (not like most of the kids shows that are intolerable). The episodes are short (15 mins) and so cute.",1376524800,,389,3.875
3919419,5,B002ERQWWC,"My daughter has learned so much from this show.  I wasn't sure she was ready to start on letters, until she started responding to the show and was remembering what she learned. I like that it's good wholesome entertainment for her as well!",1373932800,,239,4.558139534883721
3919420,5,B002ERQWWC,"This gift was for 2 year old granddaughter who delights in the characters.  When it comes time to ""build a word,"" she chants the letters along with the characters.  I keep a magnetic board and letters near the TV and pause the show.  Together we find the letters and match the word on the DVD.  She gets a real kick out of it and is starting to recognize the easy words - and the fact that letters go together to make words.  All the Word World DVDs are awesome tools and so much fun for the kids!",1373328000,,497,4.082474226804123
3919421,5,B002ERQWWC,"My 3 year old loves to watch this, and I really like that it introduces her to reading concepts. I don't like her to watch ""mindless"" entertainment, but there are times when some TV fits into our day. Watching this makes me feel better about the content going into her brain. Each episode seems to have a cute little moral lesson in it too, like telling the truth, helping your friends, etc. I recommend it!",1373155200,,407,4.44
3919422,5,B002ERQWWC,"Watch out Nick Jr. PBS Kids may have some shows that can really educate your child. Because of this show my daughter knows some sights words. She actually learned the phonics of the the alphabet with this show.

She's not quite ready for LeapFrog:  Letter Factory (she loses interest), even though it's also a good video that she'll be able to use when she's older.  Wordworld holds her interest, especially with the songs and characters.  She likes these so much, we've started recording them on DVR.",1360627200,,409,4.704225352112676

3919428,5,B002ERQWWC,"I got this for my daughter, who has speech delay and sees a speech pathologist weekly. The results were amazing. Even her speech teacher noticed. She has started to pick up the different words in the show, her pronunciation has improved, and she loves the ""build-a-word"" music, and actually begs to watch. She pulls out the dvd and says ""word world! word world!"" I know some of the other reviews have said that it doesn't focus on the words long enough, but honestly, I find that to be a blessing. No toddler (my kid is 2.5 and has had this dvd for about 6 mos) is going to sit through a long, drawn-out word teaching session. She likes to dance and interact with the characters. And really, when is the last time you watched a dvd with a toddler only once? I think I have this thing memorized by now, she loves it so much. So, she gets plenty of repeats with the different words. I just can't say enough about this series. Highly recommend.",1356566400,,941,4.382857142857143

3919441,5,B002ERQWWC,"My son has been watching this show on the web for a while, and since he loves it so much, we got this box set to have better quality.  This set the best deal of all of the WW videos and there are plenty of episodes for him to watch.  I can't say enough about how amazing this show is.  My son just turned 2 and he already knows all of his letters and can sound out many of them.  We read to him a lot, but we use word world as a treat and he talks to me at night about what he's seen.  ""they lost the o!""  I find this show charming and I think it truly does have a real educational value.  I bought another for my brother's kids.",1348876800,,629,3.7196969696969697

3919446,5,B002ERQWWC,"It is just amazing how quickly my baby learned letter recognition and puting words together in order thanks to these animals.
The whole family was amazed how those little hands could put togehter the dog, cat, zebra, cow, etc.. all animals in the set
together in a snap.

We started with the dog as it is her faforite animal, obviously - like most kids :) and then we gradually were adding on
animals untill we ended up with the whole set before we knew it. It is so rewording to see your tinny treasure to
be able to do words!!! that it is jsut breath taking.

We did not need any foring techinques, flash cards or anything, she was just grasping the concept from my taking apart
the animal, sounding the letters and puting them together back for her few times and then she got it like
in the same day and from that day on she knew.

I think this should be every paretnt's every baby first educational toy. It is so baby friendly, perfect for the sens of touch,
soft and cozy - what actually is said to develop brain faster.
It is sucha pleasing design and there are places to chew on if you need ha ha ha..
We take the animals everyhwere we go and she does not only have fun she is reinforcing her reading skills and preparing
for future writing without knowing it!

We were lucky to get the animals that were issued in those white boxed packaging with DVD inside. Not the other version in
the orangy cheaper packaging and without DVD. Difference is really apparent. I got the animals as a gift to my niece
but I could not find anywhere the first edition in white packaging with bluish background and DVd included in the box
so Igot the other set on e by and apparently they are not the same. Similar and all but the quality is not the same.
The original edition animals are more plumpy, solid, and have better and more baby friendly feel and touch to them
whereas the other - not the white box- edition has cheaper feel to it.

Overall we are very very pleased with the set. I have heard that this design got so many rewards and it is so popular among parents
and I totally agree with the notion. It is great for the baby and it teaches something useful for life unlike so many toys
that do nothing. It is good to see your baby having so much fun and stay engaged for good while with them.
It is amazing how long attention span the baby has while playing with the animals.

As she grows I marvel how she can put together the simple words from different animals for fun.. as in she would take
different letters from different animals and still spell the word dog or cat or cow correctly and giggles
that each letters is from different animal.. like for instance she will take L from the lion with the head,
then put i from the fish and then o from the dog and n from the lion again and she is so proud to do that.
It shows me that she is not only putting animal together, she is actually aware of the letters..
and to prove it she can take just the letters without heads and not color coded and at random
pull the letters and put together a word that is independent of characters..

soooooo cooooooooool

I am shopping for the original set now to get it for Christmas for two beloved babies in the family
and they are so hard to find, yet I won't stop till I find them. This is THE gift of learning and
I wont' settle for less :)",1324080000,,3331,4.218210361067504
3919447,5,B002ERQWWC,"I purchased this for my preschool aged son's birthday. He really enjoys watching WordWorld on PBS.  After looking over the other reviews, I chose this DVD (mostly to view on road trips).  I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this DVD to others.  It is fun & imaginative for children and I appreciate the creative way letters are used to form animals & objects.",1323216000,,380,4.641791044776119
3919448,5,B002ERQWWC,"This is a great buy. I got this for my 16 month old son.  The cartoons and storyline are very creative and imaginative. Whoever came up of creating the characters base on the spelling of the word is brilliant! In addition, I love how they build the words. It keeps my son interested.  I will definitely buy the other DVDs.",1322265600,,322,4.35
3919449,4,B002ERQWWC,This DVD set is awesome. A lot of good episodes to watch and sing along to for our daughter. Another one for our collection!,1320192000,,124,4.208333333333333
3919450,5,B002ERQWWC,"In my opinion, the best show for teaching kids how to read. We used to have all the shows (looks like there may be 2 seasons after this box set) because it was on our netflix que but since they have taken it off my little girl is just beside herself. She loves loves loves this show and I hate to say it but I have to give most of the credit for teaching her the alphabet to this very show. Did I mention she's only 20mo?
This show is great about repeating letters and themes without being too repetitive! Like I said it teaches all the letters of the alphabet but it also teaches phonics, or how to sound out a word when the letters are all put together. It has great transitions and it gives kids a real ""sense"" of the word because after the characters use letters to make a word, the word turns into the shape of the thing it's spelling. The letters also stay in place after the word takes shape which I think enforces the spelling that much further. And with fun characters like Frog, Duck, Pig, Ant, Sheep, Bear and Bugs your kids will definately want to watch this show! Keep in mind I have seen this show A LOT and up until about the 100th time I watched an episode I didn't mind watching it myself :)

All 'n all you and your kids will really enjoy this show.",1319068800,,1267,4.129554655870446

It's the first DVD set we've purchased mainly because we use Netflix for our Word World viewing needs at home. This was for a long 8 hour drive to the beach to keep my 2-year old entertained in the car and it worked. :-) The only bummer to owning them on DVD like this instead of being able to purchase them by Seasons is that we miss the short skits between the shows. But, oh well. Still plenty of fun and I don't think my daughter misses the short skits a whole lot.",1315785600,,619,4.0
3919454,5,B002ERQWWC,"Most people looking for World World DVDs already know how wonderful these shows are. If you are new to Word World, then its something you should definately watch. My daughter has been watching it for about a year on and off, and since we are no longer able to watcch on TV, I decided to buy some of the DVDs. She has only really been paying close attention to it for about 4 months, but she is already learning to spell. Between the DVDs and some books we found she can already spell about 15 words, knows all her letters, and pronounces most of her words corretly ( though in our house we have never ""babytalked"", and I believe that helps).

Even my husband and I are entertained by Word World, which is great when you watch it for about 2 hours every day!

I'm just sad that one of the discs from this set was lost before she even got to watch it, we believe it somehow ended up in the garbage :( Just ordered 4 more discs though!",1313539200,,932,4.1722222222222225

(Unless you think having the theme song stuck in your head...he he. It's happened to me)  My son has watched this since he was 4 months old...yes it is the first television that has ever caught his eye and made him giggle.  And it still does...even though we've watched this together over and over and over...did I say over?!!  And I don't even get bored of it.  The only thing in any of these Word World videos that was any negative, for my son anyway, in one of the DVD title Menu's, BUG bumps into the screen and that made my son cry.

Up until I discovered Word World, no show I had watched with my toddler had been completely perfect in this area. Some shows are quite repetitive in nature (much of the show being the same cuts over and over, as if ""filler""), and some are just low on the production quality (for example, using one-dimensional characters or non-animated backgrounds). Word World is so thoroughly and consistently creative and well done, that it is not the least bit annoying. It is pleasing to the eye and ear of an adult. As an adult, this is the highest compliment I can give any show.",1280707200,2,710,4.345864661654136
3919473,5,B002ERQWWC,This is by far the best PBS show ever!  Both my girls love it!,1279497600,,62,3.4285714285714284
3919474,5,B002ERQWWC,"My son, currently 15 months old, LOVES this show! It's very educational, the animation is very bright and cute, the characters are adorable, and I'll admit I'm often impressed by how well they make the words look like the animals, houses, etc. Although my son is a little too young to really benefit too much from it's educational value right now, I think it does a great job teaching letters, words, different animals, and so on. I would say that the age range that this show appeals to is pretty wide, as my son has enjoyed it since he was about 6 months old, and my 3 and half year old nephew recently discovered it and is obsessed. I would also suggest purchasing this set over buying multiple DVDs. The other DVDs have 4 episodes, totaling 60 minutes, and this one has 180 minutes -- you get three times the amount of entertainment for just a few bucks more than one of the individual DVDs. Of course, we may purchase another one as my son has watched this one so many times, but I would highly recommend getting this one first. Would also make a great gift for any toddler!",1278892800,,1079,4.4
3919475,5,B002ERQWWC,This DVD set is great!  My 2 1/2 yr. old LOVES Word World and started spelling along with the characters almost instantly .  I would highly recommend this DVD!,1276214400,2,159,4.448275862068965
3919476,5,B002ERQWWC,We purchased this to take on a long road trip with our 3 and 1/2 year old granddaughter. She already loved WordWorld and this 2 disc set allowed for more selection and many hours of viewing. Since our return she has been trying to sound out words just like on WordWorld!,1274832000,,270,4.313725490196078
3919477,5,B002ERQWWC,"This is an AWESOME set! My 3yr old grandson was so thrilled. It is one of his favorite shows on PBS, and it is really nice to have them on hand anytime he wants to watch it.",1273190400,,173,3.7027027027027026
3919478,5,B002ERQWWC,"my son loved this dvd . this is one of the best dvds  i have seen so far.
learning words formation is fun and very effective by this dvd.
my son love to watch this dvds on our long rides.",1269734400,,187,3.675
3919479,5,B002ERQWWC,"As gift for a kid, it was great one. Buy it but be aware there was duplicate for senses.",1269475200,,88,3.6842105263157894
3919480,5,B002ERQWWC,"I purchased this as a gift for my 3 year old.  He had watched this program previously on PBS.  HE LOVES IT!  It is fun, colorful, and educational!  He watches the story lines, but also repeats the letters as the characters identify them to put words together.  He is now able to identify every letter of the alphabet and is also writing some letters on his own.  This is a great buy!",1268870400,5,383,4.25
3919481,5,B002ERQWWC,"I have a 3 year old girl who loves this show and couldn't get enough of it from the tv show so i bought the dvd's which have plenty of episodes each she has enjoyed both dvd's, i don't have any complaints. Great dvds for learning new words.",1267488000,,240,4.020833333333333
3919482,5,B002ERQWWC,"Entertaining and educational. My three year daughter loves Wordworld. After watching the Wordworld videos and some help from us, she is actually starting to put words together and is recognizing common words. I have purchased several WordWorld DVDs and I would highly recommend them.",1266364800,,283,5.454545454545454
3919483,5,B002ERQWWC,"My son loves these videos and they have really helped his budding reading skills. I think that some of these episodes are on other collections as well but it is nice to have so many on just two discs, I am changing them out less often. My son is 3 and will watch these over and over, laughing and learning. I like the concept of building a word because as he sounds out words it helps him to remember to say it all faster, each letter has a sound and pushed together (how they build them) they make a word. He asks for these movies more often than he does his other movies as well.",1266105600,,581,4.060869565217391
3919484,5,B002ERQWWC,Word World is such a great show. I don't feel guilty when my son is watching it because it is educational and entertaining. This video is great because it has 16 15min episodes on it. This show will definitely help a child to understand what letters are and how they are used. I don't think it will really teach a child to read but it is definitely good for the child learning to pre-read.,1265414400,,389,4.27027027027027
3919485,5,B002ERQWWC,"My 2.5-year-old LOVES the word world - if I let her she wouldn't stop watching. It's interesting how quickly she catches up with the letters! And even at the umptiest time, she really loves watching it...
Several animals shaped from letters (e. g. SHEEP is made looking like a sheep) experience adventures when they somehow lose or break a word - which is shown by actually breaking the lamp in its pieces (L-A-M---P). In the end, they manage to repair everything by building that word. The movie not only shows the letters of the words but also features background vocals from children and the animals.
It is fun not only for my little one, even I find myself enjoying it because it is so nicely made.",1264809600,,702,4.579365079365079
3919486,4,B002ERQWWC,"I cannot say enough about this show. It is one of the most imaginative, fun and educational shows out there. My son is a letter hound and is in love with this show (27 months)I think if any child is going to watch any tv it should be this show over almost any other.  The only reason I put a four on this review is to draw attention to possible duplicates if you already have other videos.  I am guessing that this is because Lots of Letters is a compilation set of all of their videos. With that in mind you should expect to see some that are on other disks.  Kind of like a best of.  If you are trying to budget what you spend you should know what is on other videos.  If you are only going to buy one Lots of Letters is the one. The best bang for your buck. Then by the Christmas, Valentines Day, and Halloween disks. They are very cute.  I did not know what was on the box set since I was new to Word World so I bought more than I would have if I had known.

IF you by this box set you might not want to buy Sheep's A Start.  Three of the four videos on Sheep's A Star are in this box set.  The Birds, W Drought, Chef Sheep. The only one no in the box set is Princess Sheep off that video.

Three of the four videos on Flying Ant are in this box set: Flying Ant,Catch that C and Play Ball.  The one that is not on the video is Shuffleword. So again, If you already have Lots of Letters it might not be worth the purchase for that one extra show.

Welcome to world word has two shows that are in the box set Lots of Letters: Happy Birthday Dog and The Mystery of the Disappearing Pie.

Once again, this is one of the most amazing shows I have ever made for kids.  My son fell in love with it so if you have a little one that is just in love with letters or a child that struggles...this is for you.  The holiday shows are great for kids when you want to treat then to a show but want it to be educational.",1263254400,116,1908,3.8688946015424164
3919487,5,B002ERQWWC,"My 3 year old son and I absolutely love Word World. If you are unfamiliar with this series, its a PBS show geared at teaching phonetically, letters and simple reading and spelling. All of the animals and the objects in the world are actually made of the letters that spell the word. For example, the character dog, is made up of the letters D-O-G. A hat is actually H-A-T.

Each episode focuses on a different word or sound, while cleverly folded into an entertaining story. My son has already picked up a couple a letter sounds and the spelling of a couple of words including his favorite: C-A-K-E.

I purchased this Box Set because it came with 16 episodes, 8 for each disc and was a much better deal than some of the singular discs which only come with 4 episodes. The DVD menu has the option of playing all the episodes, selecting an episode or the special features, which will play just the ""Build a Word"" song from each episode. I would highly recommend this series to any parent(s) trying to encourage their child to take an interest in letters, words and early reading.",1262822400,26,1077,4.517948717948718
