I actually had no problem following the story. It just throw me at first. Suprisiedly , I liked the movie even though it wasn't how I thought it would be. If you like Ryosei Konishi as Kouga in the Garo shows then you'll like this to. I'm NOT sorry that I bought this. I'll buy it again if this one were to ever get damaged.",1479168000,,489,4.147368421052631
8632025,2,B00HES29S2,"This movie follows after the events of Garo: Makai Senki (Makai Flash Knight). The hero of the story, Kouga, made a promise to search for Gajari's missing body part after helping him defeat Sigma Fudo. If you haven't watched Makai Senki, a great deal of this movie won't make sense for the beginner just starting it. There was never an official English version to this series; this DVD must have ripped off a fansub and sold it that way. The entire Garo series is actually available on YouTube in HD and in other public domains free of charge; you don't have to pay a thing for it. You should really look into the Garo wikia pages to know where the story begins and ends. Overall, it's not worth buying as it's not the official released version.",1430092800,,745,4.485294117647059
