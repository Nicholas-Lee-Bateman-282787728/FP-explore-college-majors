8190470,5,B000PC72N6,"""There's nothin' wrong with bein' rich, Teddy Bear, it's how he got that way that counts."" -- Roy to Teddy Bear

One cannot think of the American cowboy without two names coming to mind immediately: Tom Mix and Roy Rogers. And one cannot think of Roy Rogers without Dale Evans, or his horse, Trigger. Both are present in one of Roy's best modern westerns (cars and horses), and this was Dale's first appearance beside the cowboy she was to remain with her entire life. Rogers represented the best of the cowboy; his virtues and code of honor, and his willingness to go out on a limb for a friend, or someone in trouble. All those things make up The Cowboy and the Senorita. Roy gets to sing the pretty title song, and joins Bob Nolan and The Sons of the Pioneers for 'What'll We Do For Money' while out for a ride. Both songs were written by Ned Washington and Phil Ohman and are pretty terrific.

Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams is excellent as Roy's saddle pal, Teddy Bear, and Mary Lee is also appealing as Chip, the young half-sister of Dale's Isabel, in this topflight Republic western which wraps things up in tidy fashion in under an hour. There's even time at the end for a big dance number around a huge sombrero, featuring Cappella and Patricia, and Jane Breeze and Ben Rochelle. It's all about Roy and Teddy drifting around and getting into trouble before helping Dale's sister Mary prove her father wasn't crazy, and keeping her big sister, with whom Roy is smitten, from making a big mistake. Joseph Kane directed this and many other westerns and nearly always kept them entertaining. Anyone wanting to know what Roy Rogers was about, and why he is such an American cowboy icon, can see for themselves with this one.

A runaway girl, a bracelet with a message, a manganese mine, a letter with clues to a treasure, and a slick cowboy competing with Roy for Dale's affections make for one of Roy's best. Big Boy Williams has some humorous moments as Roy's sidekick, stopping long enough while escaping from the law to grab a chicken! After Roy talks the men sent to apprehend he and Big Boy into helping them prove Chip's dad was crazy like a fox, there is an exciting race against time to make a delivery before Dale sells the farm, so to speak. This nice little story by Bradford Ropes was adapted for Republic by Gordon Kahn. Roy, Trigger, and the remaining cast do the rest, turning The Cowboy and the Senorita into cowboy heaven. One of the better ones out there, and a marvelous way to remember Roy, who like Tom Mix, was a hero when we needed one.",1280448000,3,2558,4.508620689655173
8190471,4,B000PC72N6,"If you enjoy the older black and white westerns with some musical entertainment added, then this one might be a film you will enjoy.

The plot as expected for a mid-1940's western is almost paper thin, however, the film is so enjoyable you won't really take note of that. And other than the title song, the rest will not over excite you, and the big finish number is pretty much a flop with the enchilada number being awfully bad.

But with the performances, especially Mary Lee's, the film turns out to be pretty enjoyable. In fact, down through the years it has become somewhat a favorite of mine. Being born in 1943, I missed it at the box office but now have my own DVD and break it out to watch whenever a light dose of good ole time entertainment is needed.

Since I'm from Ohio, though now residing in Virginia, I saw Roy Rogers in person at the Hobart Arena in Troy, Ohio. And as I recall Roy grew up in  a place called Duck Run, Ohio, and never failed to return to his home state whenever possible. Yes, Leonard Sly was and is the real deal.  At the time I saw his road show it was staffed by all the members of his TV program of the 50's including Pat Brady and Nellie Belle. No Troy Bruin ice hockey in the building that day long ago in the early 1950's, the area was given over to The Roy Rogers Show Live, and boy was the place packed. And yes, Trigger was there too.

Want to watch an entertaining western, then watch this one. It is one to ride the trail with.

Best, pards.
