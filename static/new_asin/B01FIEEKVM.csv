8760822,5,B01FIEEKVM,"This is a show that everyone planning a nursery or having a baby should watch. The show itself is much more genuine than the other home improvement shows out there. It didn't feel scripted in that ridiculous way so many home improvement shows do. This particular show is all about building baby nurseries. They put a lot of emphasis on building nurseries that are safe, environmentally friendly, and nice to look at. My wife and I are expecting, so we watched the first episode on PBS. After seeing the first episode on TV and all the cool projects they did, I ordered the DVD for my wife. We both feel like building things for our son's nursery is much more meaningful than just buying things at the store. The DVD has at least 50 projects from ten episodes of building nurseries. My wife and I watched all ten episodes and we were able to incorporate four of the projects in our son's nursery (our favorite was a lamp out of baby books!). I have a little DIY experience, but my wife has none. The show does a good enough job explaining the projects in a way that we were both able to do them without any issue. My wife and I can't wait to see more projects on the next season. It's been fun for us to watch the shows, and then do the projects.",1467072000,,1245,4.302127659574468
