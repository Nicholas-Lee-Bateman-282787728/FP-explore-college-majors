8698917,5,B0064TLR7Q,"In this feature length documentary, Patrick Rosenkranz provides us with a rare glimpse into the world of collectors and collecting. In an attempt to understand the drive behind collecting, Rosenkranz interviews a select group of collectors, who share their experiences and passion for collecting such things as antique telephones, beer signs, and more. Many share their personal ideologies on collecting, how they started on the path of collecting as well as the dangers associated with collecting, mainly when you no longer own the collection but the collection owns you. In addition, this documentary offers a brief historical overview of each of the types of items collected, such as, crayons and confectionary molds. The picture quality of this film is outstanding, however, the sound quality, given the different locations of the filming, leaves something to be desired. This is a great introduction into the world of collecting and would be a nice addition to any public library's collection.",1326844800,,998,5.3630573248407645
