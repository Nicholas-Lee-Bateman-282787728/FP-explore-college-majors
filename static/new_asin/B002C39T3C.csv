3903504,5,B002C39T3C,It was alright. Great for every one in the family. Great price and it was entertaining. Not bad at all.,1390262400,,103,4.2
3903505,4,B002C39T3C,"If you like clean comedy and Tommy Davidson, Small Fire and other clean comics, this is for you. We laughed till we cried. I reccommend this product and the seller delivered as promised! satisfied customer. Thanks DT",1382745600,,216,4.864864864864865
3903506,3,B002C39T3C,I thought this was going to be all Tommy Davidson!  I should have read the description closer.  I was looking for a standup show from Tommy.,1369008000,,140,4.346153846153846
3903507,5,B002C39T3C,It was very funny without all the vulgarity so common in comedy shows. It puts the big name shows to shame.,1357776000,,107,4.142857142857143
3903508,3,B002C39T3C,"I was hoping this would be more enjoyable then it was.  The comedy was clean enough but it was more 'pleasant' then funny, no laugh out loud moments.  It was ok to rent and watch, but not a keeper for repeated review.  Feels longer then it's actual run time.",1347235200,,258,4.224489795918367
3903509,5,B002C39T3C,"This DVD is a great idea. My parents used to kick me out of their room to watch Eddie Murphy's Delirious, I had to catch some of it peeking under the door and laugh with my hands over my mouth. Today, I would never let my kids watch the comics I enjoy (Katt Williams, Dave Chapelle, etc.). I would say that this is definitely clean enough for kids 10 and up, so it makes for a good/fun family movie night. Tommy Davidson hosts the Family Hour (but it's actually longer than an hour), the comics are Chris Spencer, AJ Jamal, Small Frie and Kenny Johnson. I remember when Chris Spencer hosted the VIBE Talk Show some years back. He was the funniest of the 4 comics. He's a victim of the sub prime real estate market -- not funny in real life but definitely funny in stand up. Next best was AJ Jamal, I've seen him on a lot of other stand up shows, he's always hilarious. Kenny Johnson and Small Frie were new, to me anyway, but they held their own. Most of the jokes were about the economy, growing up, church and gaining weight.",1252022400,6,1027,4.244897959183674
3903510,4,B002C39T3C,"Great DVD! Me and my whole family had an excellent time laughing and clapping in sheer excitement. I was skeptical at first letting my teenagers watch along with my and my wife. But since it is billed as ""Comedy for All Ages"", I figured ""what the heck"" and let the kids live for just a night lol! Our favorite hands down had to be AJ Jamal! His routine about being extremely out of shape cracked the entire house up! My daughter loved Small Fry since she represented for the ladies. All in all this DVD makes for a nice night of entertainment for families, couples, bachelors and bachelorettes. Not a bad purchase for anyone looking for some laughs.",1251936000,5,649,4.508474576271187

8363053,1,B002C39T3C,I buy a lot of these comedy DVDs but this one just wasn't worth the price. It wasn't as funny as some of the others. I don't recommend it.,1463616000,,138,3.793103448275862

8363057,4,B002C39T3C,"Hilarious and on point but a few years old- before President Obama... But wish more comedians would consider clean comedy that the entire family could enjoy without squirming with embarrassment at inappropriate content! In this show, if there was a bit of something kinda racy, only a mature mind could understand the implication . But this was clean so, let's have more!",1395360000,,371,5.0
8363058,4,B002C39T3C,The DVD was received in excellent condition and shipped quickly. The cost was reasonable. I would recommend buying this product to anyone interested in buying a collection of several entertaining comedians telling jokes that the entire family may enjoy. The visual/audio quality was very good and the product was new.,1392249600,,317,5.36
