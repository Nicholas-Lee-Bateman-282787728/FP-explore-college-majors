7862007,3,6304124325,"This story was copied in a later film ""The Pledge"" that came out about 4 years later and starred Jack Nicholson in the main role. There is a good deal copied, such as the number of little girls killed, what they look like, how the detective quits and goes out on his own to find the killer, how he rents an old gas station on the road that leads to the killing area, and how he befriends a child and her mother in order to use the child as bait.

The production values are much better in the updated version. This version is extremely weak in that area. Plus the acting is slightly over the top, especially when it comes to demonstrating emotions. The play acting is clearly evident.

The story unfolds differently in this version. There is a lot more about the killer and scenes of him going through his own emotional issues.",1390780800,,826,4.357142857142857

I came across this movie in a local thrift store and bought it for $3, it was a dvd in a cardboard slipcase with what appears to be all Czechoslovakian text except for the title of the movie, which I then remembered that I had rented this on VHS from Blockbuster around 1988 and enjoyed it for being a well paced phsycological thriller.
 Well, I think the first thing about this movie that I found unsettling was the state of disrepair that all of the buildings were in, which included the police station and that set a menacing tone for me.
 From the standpoint of the characters, I thought Richard Grant, Lynsey Baxter and Perdita Weeks played there parts very well and were matched up with some beautiful scenery that looked to be maybe filmed in the Czech Republic. Now the other character that was awesome in this movie was the bad guy Simon Cadell, this guy gives a crystal clear perspective of the meaning ""living a double life"". His performance sent chills down my spine and made me want to wretch at other times when you think that there may be and probably is someone like this, somewhere in the real world.
Unfortunately it doesn't appear to be available on DVD anywhere I've looked, but I have just found it on Netflix and it looks better on Netflix than it does on my region 9 Czech Republic DVD.
Highly recommended.",1347235200,3,1490,4.979919678714859

7862010,2,6304124325,"The American version of this film is infinitely better. And not just because it has an all-star cast and a newly competent Sean Penn. He redeems himself for the reprehensible ""Indian Runner"" and ""Crossing Guard."" No, while those are good and valid reasons to see the American film they are not the most compelling. The most compelling reasons to steer clear of this film are these: 1) It is the only film I've seen that contains a scene where two grown men play patty cake in their underwear. (No this is not a obscere euphemism it is literally what happens. 2) It is the only movie I've seen where a psychopath shaves his genitals on camera. 3. It doesn't have the same ending as the American film. (I currently have the novel on order from Amazon but I don't know how it ends.) If you liked the Pledge as much as I did you probably won't heed my warning, so the best piece of advice I can give you is this: it is available new from a few websites....",1028073600,4,952,4.324022346368715
