3557482,5,B001EVGSHI,"The visuals and sounds are excellent. You can hear the engines, exhaust sounds of these impressive cars and get a good feel for what they might be like to see in person.  I wish this set was available in Blu-Ray.",1394150400,3,212,4.3
3557483,1,B001EVGSHI,"I think the headline says it all.  All six discs were individually plastic wrapped and bundled with white copier type paper handwritten with ""Sold As A Set.""  Four of them had broken mounting spindles in their retail case, so they just knocked around during handling.  If that's the best Amazon can do I'll just skip ordering from them in the future.",1388707200,,350,4.704918032786885
3557484,5,B001EVGSHI,"Awesome historical automotive series. Great gift for the car enthusiast! Money Well Spent. I own a small dealership and we let this series run for customers enjoyment and we always are asked where did we buy these dvd's. AMAZON, of course!",1386288000,2,239,4.853658536585366
3557485,5,B001EVGSHI,"Very, Very Impressive! Alain De Cadenet is a suburb driver and he gives an amazing insight into these wonderful vehicles!",1381017600,,121,5.1
3557486,5,B001EVGSHI,"A delightful set of documentaries for any car entheusiast. Lasting approximately 75 minutes each, these exquisite shows give you a chance to see and hear some of automobile history's finest specimens in action. The ""making of"" feature is also exciting to watch as it sums up the production of the series, thus giving the viewer an enticing preview of what's in each show. Camera angles carefully selected to allow detailed cockpit and engine bay views. Well narrated by driver Alain de Cadenet as he drives some of these automotive jewels sometimes rather agressively, given some of these cars are unique examples, some owned by private collectors, corportions or heritage funds. You can tell he's really having a good time. A must-have for anyone who collects miniatures, or has a passion for some of the world's most prestigious auto makers.",1367712000,,843,5.071942446043166
3557487,5,B001EVGSHI,"Great historic over views for each mark, and Alain De Cadenet's driving and narration are both entertaining!  You may find yourself wanting to slap Alain though.",1367539200,,161,5.1923076923076925
3557488,5,B001EVGSHI,"A series on the history of the great racing marquees from their beginnings through their glory years to... for the most part the early 90's. Alain de Cadenet gives information on the cars, the legendary drivers, history, noteworthy design and engineering aspects and then sits behind the wheel and drives the great cars of LeMans, the Mille Miglia and  the Targa Floria. Great Series.....my one only beef was the Porsche segment which I think was filmed using a potato...the rest have a great picture",1332201600,2,500,4.9523809523809526
3557489,1,B001EVGSHI,"Hmmm, where should I start without wasting much of yours and my time?!  Amazon sent me an email link asking for my opinion.

1: I ordered the full set but was shipped in the sealed shipping carton ONLY the Porsche, Ferrari, Alfa and Jaguar DVD's but the Aston Martin DVD was missing but yet had the sleeve and further the Maserati sleeve and DVD was missing!  I know there is a problem with education in the USA but when people are unable to properly count or package such a simple order, they have no right to be working. So I said it and now whoever packaged and approved my shipment, please go back back to school. ZERO stars.

2: For the trouble, an Amazon representative was very understanding and promptly arranged for the return, and kindly said they would give me a $20.00 credit or gift amount to be used on my next order.  Not that it matters, but since they offered it, I never received it.  ZERO stars.

3: At this moment, I'm between a commercial while watching an F1 race and getting a laugh at how far and ridiculous some of these big companies think they rule the marketplace.  Screw it, I'll buy my DVD set from a nice small business owner in Downers Grove, IL called the Motorsport Collector.  Check his website out.  Until then, I'll be able to review the DVD's.

Final review score is ZERO stars but they won't allow that.  Amazon is just like fleaBay.  Products are second hand, factory rejects and or many returned merchandise. Warehouse shippers not up to standards.

Back to the race.",1314403200,,1508,4.4963235294117645
3557490,4,B001EVGSHI,I gave this to a friend without viewing it but I know this DVD series so it's probably at least good.  I had previously watched the Ferrari DVD and it was excellent.  Seller was excellent - - sent immediately and received without delay.,1292889600,,236,4.465116279069767
3557491,5,B001EVGSHI,"This set of DVDs is without a doubt the best documentary I have ever seen or could imagine on the selected marques. That you get to see and hear these historic cars actually driven at speed is an achievement in itself. The video and audio quality is superb. I watched them on a large Plasma High Def TV and the quality was stunning. The color was magnificent and the audio near perfect. If you are a fan of any of these makes, a historic racing car buff or just like to see and hear the most outstanding historic examples of these marques then these DVDs are a bargain.
The racing history for each marque is shown by progressing from the earliest examples through the latest. Nearly all being driven so that the beautiful sounds of some of the greatest engines in racing history can be heard. The fact that the owners of these cars allowed them to be transported to an appropriate setting and then driven demonstrates the confidence in the producer and in De Cadenet's driving ability that the owner's had. Many of these cars are worth in the millions each!
Unlike most auto television shows and documentaries where the announcers will not shut up so you can hear the engines, De Cadenet and director Tony Maylam did the opposite and let the engines speak for themselves. Hearing an Alfa Romeo or Ferrari 12 cylinder engine on the throttle is music to my ears.",1255564800,12,1360,4.555102040816327

8299602,4,B001EVGSHI,"It's not really a set in that it comes in one box.  It's just all of the DVDs, in separate cases, shipped together.  Great content though.",1475107200,,138,4.269230769230769
8299603,5,B001EVGSHI,"The content is amazing.  I can watch these every few years and it doesn't get old.  The video quality is so-so at times, I wouldn't say its 'remastered'.  A def. have for any car lover.  Audio is great too.",1474243200,,206,4.205128205128205

8299606,5,B001EVGSHI,"This is how car TV should be. A knowledgeable host who understands the machines are the real stars of the show. You won't find any cheap ""reality"" theatrics here. My sincerest thanks to Alain De Cadenet for rounding up some of the most exciting, most beautiful automobiles on the road and delivering them to my living room.",1453852800,2,323,4.684210526315789
8299607,4,B001EVGSHI,"Overall, an excellent series. Excellent commentary and video images. I especially enjoy the Jag DVD. One or two of the DVD's lack the video sharpness of the later DVD's",1449446400,,168,4.827586206896552

8299609,1,B001EVGSHI,"I had already seen these videos several times and I decided that owning them would be a good addition to my varied collection of DVDs.  Actually, only received one, Jaguar.  In a lot of enthusiasts' eyes all you might need is Jaguar.  If you decide to order this, please be aware that the potential for disappointment is high.",1435968000,,326,4.586206896551724
