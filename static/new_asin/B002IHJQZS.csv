8370908,5,B002IHJQZS,"I found these dvds an easy way to learn collage concepts and get ideas for materials. Donna Hugh explains and you watch as she selects materials and piece by piece makes collages.  I am working with people who have alzheimer's and I have no art background.  These dvds (Vol 1, Vol2, and Vol 3) gave me all the information I needed to procede to make them with my clients. Vol 1 starts with simplest ideas and builds upon that.  Volume 1 has 3 lessons (and 3 different collages), Volume 2 has 2 lessons (and 2 different collages).  I was grateful to find these (at my library). Donna thinks outloud as she selects materials and as she works - very helpful way to instruct.",1354406400,,671,4.430894308943089
