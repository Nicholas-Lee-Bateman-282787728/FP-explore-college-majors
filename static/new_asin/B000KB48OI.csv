8155350,4,B000KB48OI,I enjoyed this movie because it provides a look at the people of Africa that is missed in the news and in programs that present Africans only as people who are in the need of aid from western powers.  Its story also celebrates the connections of people of African descent no matter where they live in the world and makes us proud of our ancestral homeland.  Good viewing for ages 13 and up and should stimulate interests in cultural studies.,1389571200,,441,4.5
