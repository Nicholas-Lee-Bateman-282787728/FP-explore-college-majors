2325199,5,B0009VNCWS,This Christmas Dvd contains many classic entertainers. I used to own the VHS version but the Dvd version allows you to pick your favourite moments.

2325201,4,B0009VNCWS,"This DVD packs a lot of holiday cheer into just 46 minutes; although some of the segments are edited, it flows nicely, and is mellow and entertaining, especially for Baby Boomers who remember growing up with Ed's show on Sunday nights. Lots of music and comedy bits, though nothing really rock & roll. Best of all I got this sealed, new DVD from an Amazon vendor for just over $2! This DVD is enjoyable to watch, but would be a perfect background for a Christmas Eve or party- definitely better than those Yule Log videos!",1195344000,36,522,4.505263157894737
2325202,4,B0009VNCWS,"Clip shows tend to bore me, but this one is creatively edited from years of Christmas Specials. These mostly color vignettes are a delight for those who remember the performers as well as younger folks who may not have been around.

True variety abounds with song, including a German children's choir that sings in English more perfect than one hears from many American choirs, and delightful comedy bits. This collection is a charmer.

The brief 47 minutes flys along with not a dull moment. Included is a clip from Bing Crosby's original movie rendition of ""White Christmas"" disolved into a live performance. Rich Little gives a classic remembrance of George Burns, Jack Benny and Ed Sullivan himself. (Sullivan, who visually projected as very tall, was in fact not tall and we briefly see that as he stands alongside Little.)

Connie Frances, who knew how to take the time to ""sell"" a song, is featured in a show Sullivan took to Cuba to entertain our troops.  Ventriloquists, Sheri Lews and Senor Wences are there as well as a couple of classic Muppet performances and Alvin and the Chipmonks. Lots of notstalgia and chock full of legends: Count Basie, Mahalia Jackson, Johnny Mathis, The Supremes. Each vignette is brief but satisfying with a perfect flow from one piece to another.

A genuine time capsule, delighful and uplifting. Nicely done. I'm so impressed, I'm ordering multiple copies to give as stocking stuffers next year.",1135468800,73,1437,4.946058091286307
2325203,3,B0009VNCWS,"Best features: Quality of the clips is mostly good to excellent; same with the audio. It was good to see Bing Crosby singing portions of White Christmas. No lingering watermarks in the corner of the screen. Unexpected, delightful surprise: The Cowsills...this family could SING. Fun clip: Alvin and the Chipmonks.

Worst features: It's not an hour long, it's only 46 minutes. The scene menu is hard to figure out. Too many of the clips are just segments, not the entire act. Comedy acts?...boring and outdated. Joan Rivers singing. Rich Little doing imitations of people long dead (was it really necessary to include an impersonator??).

Bottom line: It's inexpensive, but on the boring side. It will definitely not be on my annual viewing list.",1129248000,21,745,5.048780487804878

They're great entertainment and both old and young folks enjoy the hour or so of retro Christmas goodness. Everyone except my dad.

2325322,5,B0009VNCWS,"The Ed Sullivan Show is a classic program from TV's past. While this isn't an actual single program, but bits and pieces from the 23 year run from TOAST OF THE TOWN to when it became THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW.

[1:51] TOPO GIGIO wishes all ""Peace on Earth"" (with Ed Sullivan)

There is no way a person can watch this show and not smile, and sigh over what Christmas used to mean. This DVD, an Ed Sullivan Christmas is worth every penny, and if you're my age, the memories will be bittersweet. My wife, kids, and I totally enjoyed this little gem. Get it, share it with your family, and enjoy the memories.

2325372,1,B0009VNCWS,"The unfortunate thing here is that the sorry excuse for a distributor called ""SOFA Entertainment"" has the rights to anything related to Ed Sullivan.  The show itself has such great history and a magnitude of major talent appearances that unfortunately will never been seen by younger eyes.  The fact that SOFA has ""control"" over everything is just a sin.  Everything they manage to release is careless and clearly pieced together by special monkeys.

I took a chance on this release, and bought it used for under three bucks, with free shipping, so SOFA didn't get my dime.  The DVD and content sounds great, however, it's a hack job of poorly edited pieces and nothing remotely flowing in continuity. Incomplete performances, unnecessary patter, and what seems like a plethora of promising entertainment for the holidays, you get about 30 minutes of sitcom flashback style nothingness.  No clip is more than 3 minutes. Many are just over a minute.  Thanks?

The list price is a joke, but if you can get it for what I did, it's not much of a loss.  But it's more of a let-down as it just teases you with what it should have been. I question the positive reviews, as seriously, how could they be real?  We can only hope that SOFA goes bankrupted soon and gets taken over by a real distributor.

As a little bonus tidbit of info on SOFA entertainment.  They are responsible for getting hundreds of YouTube accounts terminated, and still go strong making false claims.  One in particular is the viral video that inspired Beyonce's ""Put A Ring On It"" music video.  The original dance routine was by Gwen Verdon, and the footage was from the Ed Sullivan Show.  The only difference was that people replaced the audio from the show, and added their own music. So, this pathetic company terminated accounts on footage (not audio) of three women dancing, ending the massive ""Rick-Rolled"" type viral video trend in it's tracks. Of course, they never uploaded their footage or offered it, so, what is part of history, they keep taking away. Just one example and warning to steer clear of anything released by these dolts.

Yes, verified purchase. But not without regret.",1330819200,37,2159,4.794594594594595

2325374,4,B0009VNCWS,"This was a fun DVD to watch. I wish that some of the segments weren't shortened and a few could have been omitted, But it was entertaining to watch and see some of the stars in their early years. Funny watching Ed Sullivan interact with some of his guests on the show.",1326326400,,268,4.173076923076923
2325375,5,B0009VNCWS,"For three bucks and free shipping I couldn't pass this up.  Unfortunately, I purchased it after Christmas and watched it on January 7th.  This would have been perfect to watch with the family on Christmas Eve.

It's a fast-moving 48 minute DVD featuring various Christmas clips from past Ed Sullivan Shows from the 60s and 70s that last no longer than three minutes each.  Some even less than that.  There are wonderful guests like The Supremes, Jack Carter, Johnny Mathis, a young Rich Little, Roger Williams, Bing Crosby, Mahalia Jackson, the Cowsills, Paul Anka, Shari Lewis, the Muppets and Joan Rivers, who for once actually behaved like a real human being with a heartfelt Christmas reading.  I didn't know she had it in her.

I was impressed with the picture quality for a show that's going on being fifty years old.  It makes me wonder why they can't go back into the vaults and release complete shows.

If you can get this for a bargain like I did, I highly recommend it.",1325980800,2,980,4.651162790697675
2325376,2,B0009VNCWS,"I am a huge fan of Christmas shows, new and old. I bought this expecting some great ""vintage"" performances. There were a few good ones, but many were actually cut off. A few were also just shown in a quick snippet. I was seriously shocked when the end came. I felt a bit cheated. There had to have been tons of performances that could've been included. Just disappointed.",1325462400,13,371,4.470588235294118

2325378,5,B0009VNCWS,"There are so many great artists on this dvd. George Carlin was funny as usual. I first saw this on PBS years ago. I have it taped on S-VHS and it still looks great, almost as clear as this dvd. In the PBS broadcast, there was a montage of shots at the ice rink at Rockefeller Plaza with Santa skating among other things with a classic Christmas song playing. This was ommited from the dvd.",1325289600,,389,4.2

However, this release blows that one out of the water. Unlike the other release, which is a staged tribute to the show that is only about one third devoted to original clips (all of which are heavily abridged), ""Classic Christmas"" is made up basically entirely of original clips of the show. Each clip also is run nearly entirely (I would imagine that there is some rather superficial cutting done after the appearances are concluded) and there are some really great appearances, including Christmas songs by artists like Brook Benton and Connie Francis and several skits by the early Muppets.

Really, really great stuff that certainly for me evoked the Christmas spirit, and actually it makes me wish that we had a show like this one again--could it work? There is such a fascination with live performing these days, seems like maybe somebody would give a new variety show a shot.",1323820800,2,1195,5.751412429378531

He was really great at hosting a variety show.  This dvd is a warm holiday show to watch during Christmas Season, I loved watching this dvd and enjoyed seeing some comedians that I haven't seen in such a long time.
