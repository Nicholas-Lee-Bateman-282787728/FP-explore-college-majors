8652937,3,B00JPQ1IOM,"Lets start with the positives: No technical issues and audio muffling. The negatives are that most of the flicks, besides The Woman Avenger,The Bravest Fist, The Ninja Avenger(BEST ONE),and The Mighty Four,are passible and lackluster. They were OK,that's all. The worst was Five Kung-fu Daredevil Heroes that kept me dosing off. Worth a buy regardless even though this is my least favorite compilation. The few gem flicks were worth it.",1462492800,7,436,5.242857142857143
