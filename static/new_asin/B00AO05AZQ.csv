5462312,1,B00AO05AZQ,"It is a remake with a beautiful picture. but...

A recommendation can never be carried out to the person who likes television series and an original.
A story is simplified, a picture is changed and, so to speak, it is completely a different thing.
To those who do not know Rurouni Kenshin which I want to look at television series.
It is not this.

These episodes tell a little bit about sano's past and ANOTHER fight between Kenshin and Sanosuke. Hmm, i wonder who would win, Kenshin + sword vs Sano - sword. Duh. anyways, the other episodes are basicaly filler episodes, but they are also good too. Since everything kenshin is good anyways. Well, i think that you should get it to add to your collection.",1003622400,2,534,4.631578947368421
5462314,2,B00AO05AZQ,"The TV Series' version had some issues, especially pacing, but it is a far superior adaptation than this. They just didn't provide enough time to cover the story, and the compression in time led to some really bad choices in storytelling, to the point that entire main characters don't actually serve a purpose and you wouldn't understand their motivations at all without prior knowledge of the story. They even recycled the music from the TV series.

Given the timing of the release, I would bet money that this was shoved out the door to capitalize on the release of the Rurouni Kenshin film. This was released about a year after the first film, and a year before the sequels.

The only good thing I can say about this is that the animation is a marked improvement from the TV series, and it's nice to see Kenshin in a widescreen format.

Don't waste your time or money on this.",1433808000,,880,4.556962025316456

It was animated in the style of Trust and Betrayal which I found to be marvelous, both then and now.  I would have preferred the entire TV series to have been done that way.

If this ever comes out dubbed, I would be sorely tempted to purchase it.

Number 2, If they do the Jinchu Arc, the fight between Kenshin and his brother-in-law, in the same type of animation, dubbed, it would be wonderful!

5462326,1,B00AO05AZQ,"I can say a lot of things about this OVA. A lot of things your Grandma wouldn't want you reading, but I'll try to keep it witty and PG.

The Rurouni Kenshin New Kyoto Arc is an OVA that retells the middle and typically highest praised story in the saga. An evil mummy-dude is gathering an army of villains to turn Japan back to it's chaotic and warring ways, and our hero Kenshin is the only one able to take him on.
You following so far? Good. Sounds pretty exciting, huh? Well, you'd best get the old DVDs or manga, because what we have here is a shadow of the arc's former glory. A polished turd whose only praise is it's aesthetics. And that's shallow praise, mind you.

If you haven't seen or read any of the story before, you're lost. Characters just show up without any coherent rhyme, reason or exposition. Even if you do know them, the characters are poorly written and never given any time to breathe or show real personality as the events of what did take weeks if not months in the original story's time is now put into a couple days. Dragged in all the main players? Check. Gave Kenshin his new super move and weapon? Check. Allude to the villain and his lady having gross mummy-sex? Check and eeeugh... Great! Now put em all on a boat and SWOARDFIGHTZ!
Oh, also have punch-dude use his mega punch against evil punch dude who you're pretty sure taught punch-dude the mega punch but the story forgets to remind you so whatevs.

So... yeah. In summary, what we have here is an appalling mess. Underwritten characters shoehorned into an incoherent plot with no backstory or exposition with no time to become invested with anything or anyone as flashy yet forgettable fights plod on until bad guy dies and the credits roll. A series this well known and beloved deserved much, much better. I'd only recommend buying this as a terrible gift to a fellow fan who you'd like to infuriate, otherwise douse it in oil and set it aflame like a certain renegade assassin.",1390435200,8,1970,4.4972067039106145
5462327,1,B00AO05AZQ,"I love Kenshin. The manga and the show, it's a very charming fun story. This is not.. a 30+ episode story cut into an 80 minute short. There's no comedy, the acting is horrible and if you're a new fan there's no way in Hell you""ll be able to follow the story. Did I mention the violence? Violence in anime is fine, I love Berserk, but in Kenshin?! Some of the scenes in this are comparable to Shigurui. Just stay away.",1389916800,10,418,4.172839506172839
5462328,2,B00AO05AZQ,"Preface: I love the Kenshin manga and very much enjoyed the original anime - especially the Kyoto arc (the subject of this movie).

Summary: this is a superficial retelling of the Kyoto arc, diverging sometimes drastically from the original story, with mediocre animation and no rewatch value.

The Good: it made me really appreciate the original TV series; it made me want to go back and watch the original Kyoto arc again.  Also, since some scenes were completely untrue to either the manga or the anime, it was occasionally interesting to see odd interactions you would never otherwise see (like Shishio fighting Usui directly).

The Bad: only good for a Kenshin fan (someone who wasn't really conversant with the plotline would be immediately lost), except that Kenshin fans will be the ones who are most disappointed.  Not deep enough for you to become emotionally involved, yet not superficially beautiful enough to blow your mind with fight scenes or animation.  I would say, ""determinedly mediocre.""

The Ugly:

This OVA destroys the entire point of Kenshin's character by having him (Kenshin) straight up kill Shishio.  Dead as a doornail.  With his own hands.  And PS: it's an easy, no-sweat-breaking fight for him.  Piece of cake.  Shishio's like a low-level henchman, difficulty-wise.

In the end, I wish I had gone back and selected a few episodes from the original series or reread my manga than spending my time watching this.  You want to buy it?  I'll sell it to you for cheap. ; )",1388275200,5,1657,5.392996108949417

5462330,2,B00AO05AZQ,"(Minor spoilers throughout.)

For those unfamiliar with Rurouni Kenshin, it was originally a manga (comic) from the 90s that was adapted into an anime TV show while the comics were being written.  Production issues with the animated version caused some story differences between the show and the comic, resulting in the show being canceled before the comics were finished.  There were also some OVAs (the anime equivalent to straight-to-video movies) produced as well as a movie.  However, most fans treat the comic series as the definitive ""canonical"" version of Kenshin.

The comics were roughly divided into three story arcs, and the New Kyoto Arc is a remake of this story line.  Contrary to what is suggested in one of the other reviews, this isn't simply a retelling of the same story from a different perspective.  Several key plot points were changed.

For those of you familiar with Rurouni Kenshin, you may be bothered by these changes.  Some of the story changes are relatively superficial.  For example, in the original story, Misao meets Kenshin by happenstance and is unaware of his true identity for some time.  In this version, the story begins with Misao hunting down Kenshin because she knows that he met with Aoshi (albeit, she doesn't know the details of what happened).

Some of the story changes from the original are puzzling because they detract from the suspense and drama in the original.  For example, in the original story, Misao meets and befriends Kenshin/Kaoru/Yahiko, but doesn't know about what happened to Aoshi and the rest of the Oniwabanshu.  Her lack of awareness in the original created drama and tension, as the viewer wondered what would happen when she found out.  In this version, she finds out fairly immediately, eliminating the drama and tension.  Another example of questionable plot changes involves the fight with Cho.  In the original, the fight was very well written with a climactic final blow that I won't describe in detail here.  Suffice to say, the encounter was rewritten in this version that saps all the drama from the original.

The tone of New Kyoto Arc straddles a line somewhere between the comic/TV series on one hand and the OVAs on the other.  The OVAs turned a lot of fans off because the tone was very serious and violent, whereas the comic/TV series was more jovial and humorous.  While there is more humor retained in New Kyoto Arc compared to the OVAs, it doesn't try to emulate the humor from the comic/TV show.  I don't think Kenshin says ""Orooo"" at any point in New Kyoto Arc.  Also, there's an unintentionally funny sex scene involving Shisio and Yumi, which puts New Kyoto Arc squarely in the adult category, whereas the comic/TV show was more for kids/teens.

The animation is an improvement from the original.  I didn't care much for some of the redesigns.  Kenshin looks slightly more disheveled and wild compared to his portrayal in the comics/TV show.  Hiko Seijuro looks older/uglier.  I also didn't care for the musical score, which is mostly a remix of the soundtrack from the TV show.

If you are new to Rurouni Kenshin, New Kyoto Arc may be inaccessible/inscrutable because it strips away all the introductions and context from the original.  There isn't much explanation of Kenshin's backstory and there are no character introductions.  The first five minutes consists of a whirlwind review of how each key character gets to Kyoto without much explanation as to who they are or their backstories.

In sum, I can't say this movie is worth purchasing.  I caught it on Hulu.  Might be worth watching if you are a fan that's curious to see what they are doing with the Kenshin IP these days, but otherwise stay away.",1380844800,2,3699,4.884430176565008
5462331,4,B00AO05AZQ,"The dvd set had both parts of New Kyoto Arc in one package, which was convenient and saved money.  The art style was bright and colorful, and the English dubbing was very good.  After watching ""Reflection"", anything is good, ha ha.  Yes, the story of Shishio was changed from the manga and the anime series, and left out a lot of the ""real"" storyline.  But it was still watchable, and at least it was something new to watch for Rurouni Kenshin fans.  I'll give it four stars because I liked the English dubbing.  I would rather have had the Jinchu Arc animated, but there is hope that this film will lead the way for that.",1379980800,,622,4.3652173913043475
5462332,5,B00AO05AZQ,I was really excited when I heard they were revamping the Kyoto Arc but was worried when it wasn't from Kenshin's view. I watched it subbed first before I was able to purchase the bluray and was impressed with the story and the artwork. I think they did a good job. If you are expecting the original english voice actors from the TV Show for the dubbed version of the movie you will be disappointed but the voice actors who did the voices did a great job! All in all I love this addition to the Rurouni Kenshin franchise!,1378598400,2,521,4.2727272727272725
5462333,5,B00AO05AZQ,"How could I not love this? I don't understand how others didn't like this. The new animation is BEAUTIFUL and I really appreciated the more mature take on the Kyoto Arc. If anything, it's a great collection completer.",1377907200,2,217,4.7368421052631575
5462334,5,B00AO05AZQ,"I love the recap of the old series into one single, enough of never ending fights like in Dragon Ball Z",1376006400,2,103,3.9523809523809526
5462335,1,B00AO05AZQ,"Sorry everyone, its a dud. A sad day for all us RK fans. I consider RK to be my favorite anime because it was the first series I really got into and introduced me to being 'otaku,' and I couldn't even finish watching this OVA. I was persuaded to do so and regret it.

All I can say is, what a waste. And where do I begin? Well, the animation looks extremely cheap, (sometimes it seems that Aoshi and Soujiro have the same hair) they mess with the plot big time (for instance Shishio kills Usui - which really made me mad because the Saitou-Usui fight was one of my favorites in the series), Soujiro has no major breakdown, fights and locations are changed or don't happen at all, etc.

Did we really need to see Shishio and Yumi doing it? No.

One big thing...Spoiler alert...

Kenshin kills Shishio. Yeah. Kind of a major character error there. I mean, wasn't the whole point of the series that Kenshin refused to kill again? But instead he cracks Shishio's head open with the hilt of his sword.

And of course - I'm not the first person to say this - why not just animate the Jinchuu arc rather than redo the Kyoto Arc?! But considering how badly they did this, maybe its for the best that they didn't butcher the Jinchuu arc.",1375660800,7,1228,4.321739130434783
5462336,1,B00AO05AZQ,You would have to be brain dead to think they could pack 34 episodes of a true EPIC story arc into a 90 min film. Come on what did you expect...I mean really?????,1375401600,2,162,3.9393939393939394

5462338,1,B00AO05AZQ,"It tries to do too much in too little time.  It therefore has some of the worst pacing issues I've seen in an anime.  In spite of the other examples that spring readily to mind.  It is a slight reinterpretation of the story so at first you think, 'well that might be interesting.'  But then it's not.  The symbolism of the original is deep and meaningful.  This is not even worth watching.  Go check out the live action movie if you need recent Kenshin.  They are apparently working on a live action Kyoto-arc story, so that might sate this thirst.",1373155200,9,548,4.41
5462339,3,B00AO05AZQ,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I am a purest when it comes to anime series and I grew up watching Rurouni Kenshin on Toonami and I own the Mangas and original DVD from Media Blaster. When I heard that they were creating a new OVA series after so many years, suffice to say I was excited, but that where it ends.

The good:
As far as the animation goes, this Blu-Ray is great because of the bright, vibrant colors and 1080P video. It looks awesome on my 42"" Plasma TV

The Bad:
This is a hacked up, condensed version of the Kyoto Arc, which was magnificently animated during the original release many years ago. For purest like myself, this version is an insult to the original animation and story. This OVA lacks the comedy, action and storytelling from the original. In addition, because of the nature of the release, they squeezed the entire arc into 2 disc, roughly about 2 hours.

Anyone who is a diehard fan or Rurouni Kenshin, I would say to pick this up as a used copy if you're interested in seeing this or wait til the price drops. But if you are expecting anything new or revolution because it's Blu-Ray or has new animation, you'll be very disappointed",1371168000,15,1170,4.407407407407407
5462340,2,B00AO05AZQ,"I am a huge fan of both the original tv show and manga so naturally I bought this new blu-ray. The only reason why I don't give this a one star is because I do like the updated animation of the two ova's and that is it. All this blu-ray is a two ova retelling of the Kyoto arc with all the good parts left out and other scenes changed. The best part, the fighting, is glossed over it was a total let down. Now the unforgivable part, the blu-ray itself. My blu-ray only had the english voice track even though it showed it had the japanese track also it wouldn't let me take off the subtitles. If you watched the original show you would know that the subtitles read differently than the english voice acting because of translation. So it gets really confusing having to watch a movie that says one thing and subtitles that don't always match plus they were pretty big letters. It would be one thing if i was able to watch it in it's original language and I was reading them. In conclusion STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISK SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!",1369872000,6,1032,4.270408163265306
5462341,1,B00AO05AZQ,"This rendition of Rurouni Kenhin is just a very quick look at the whole series. Absolutely NOTHING NEW.The american voice actors are horrible. I wish I would've waited until the price came down. It is not worth paying top dollar.
 I feel it is extremely important to realize that this Rurouni Kenshin DVD is a knock off of the entire series. In my opinion and I am a huge Kenshin fan this compilation is not worth the time watching.
 However, I did not listen to the Japanese voice actors. It maybe a totally different experience. I felt these OVAs were a terrible telling of Rurouni Kenshin the series. It seemed to be crammed together and not in a good manner; it is jumbled together.
 Thumbs down for me.",1369872000,10,707,4.5078125
5462342,5,B00AO05AZQ,"This new interpretation of Kenshin is a great start for people who want to get into the Rurouni Kenshin series.  The series is Shonen Action but I believe this Blu-ray is a little more.  The fights are short, sweet, and to the point.  BTW, there is two 45 min episodes on this Blu-ray.
The point of view is more from Misao instead of Kenshin but there is a fair balance between the two.  The other characters get decent screen time like Saito Haijime, Kaoru, and Sano.
The voice of Saito Haijime (my favorite character) is different because the original voice seiyu, Hirotaka Suzuoki, passed away years ago.  He is best known for the voice of Bright Noah from Mobile Suit Gundam, Z Gundam, ZZ Gundam, Char's Counterattack, and the Super Robot Wars series.
Lastly, they use some of the original music from the TV series but redone.  I love that nice little touch.
Overall, I recommend this Blu-ray because it best encompasses the most popular arc of the Manga/TV series.  Enjoy!",1369180800,2,977,4.678362573099415

5462344,4,B00AO05AZQ,"First off, it should be stated that unless you have seen the original series don't bother watching this. This is because the greatest flaw is that the plot starts in the middle of the series and relies heavily on the viewer having already seen the original. Another drawback to relying so much on a previous viewing of the original is that the plot moves incredibly fast leaving out a lot of character details. That said if you have seen the original and cannot find a copy of it anywhere this movie is overall done very well. The animation and art are much better drawn and more fluid than the original. None of the original cast reprises his or her roles, but that's not a problem as the only characters that really had their actors miss the performance mark are that of Kaoru and Yahiko.

So, if you have seen the original and can't find a copy anywhere this is a good substitute. Just keep in mind the flaws.",1365552000,4,912,4.428571428571429

5462347,4,B00AO05AZQ,"In the 1990s, the manga and anime series ""Rurouni Kenshin"" by Nobuhiro Watsuki, was one of the first major anime series to attract fans outside of Japan because it was aired on the Cartoon Network's Toonami block but in Japan, it was published in Shueisha's ""Weekly Shonen Jump"".

The series would lead to two OVA's, two animated films and most recently a live-action film plus video games, light novels and more.

And while the series ended back in 1999, in 2012, the manga series of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" had sold over 55 million copies and the anime has ranked among the 100 most watched series in Japan.

And to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of ""Rurouni Kenshin"", a new manga series titled ""Rurouni Kenshin Restoration"" is being published in ""Weekly Shonen Jump"" and two new animated films were created in Japan based on the Kyoto Arc, with part one debuting in theaters in 2011 and part two in 2012.  And now, these two 45-minute films will be released in the U.S. as a 2-part OVA on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.

VIDEO:

""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  Unlike the original series made in the '90s or the films and OVA's that were made in the early 2000s, the ""New Kyoto Arc"" features new animation by Studio DEEN.  Featuring all new animation, beautifully painted backgrounds and animation that is much more vibrant, sharper and better line-detail, I would imagine that fans should be happy with the HD presentation of the film.  I didn't see any banding issues, artifacts or any problematic issues with picture quality.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" is presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  It's important for people to know that the English dub does not feature the '90s Bang Zoom cast but does feature the ADV cast used for the original OVA and animated film release.  Personally, I feel that the English dub is subjective but in my opinion, the voice acting felt a bit off with a few characters, so I decided to watch both OVA's in its original Japanese dialogue with English subtitles.  For one, you get the same voice actors from the original television series and I felt that the dynamic range was slightly better than its English dub counterpart.

But both soundtracks are crystal clear, as with its musical soundtrack.  I didn't notice the surround channels being used or any LFE.  If anything, it was a front/center channel mix.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" did not come with any special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was very thrilled to know that with the 15th anniversary of ""Rurouni Kenshi"", we would get a brand new release of the Kyoto Arc of ""Rurouni Kenshin"".

For those who have watched animated films and are used to the abridged version of the stories, while it would have been nice to have three films (OVA's) instead of two, to include more storyline and feature more of the characters, for the most part, these two OVA's are easily accessible for those without any prior knowledge of the manga and anime series.

But by saying that, I know there are people who despise abridged storylines and would rather see a full TV series or multiple OVA's or movies to mirror the manga series.  So, if you are one of those people, you're probably going to complain about this release.

Otherwise, if you are used to seeing abridged films or OVA's but wanting to see ""Rurouni Kenshin"" in HD, then you can look at these two OVA's as a bonus to celebrate ""Rurouni Kenshin"" being released on Blu-ray.

For one, Studio DEEN did a magnificent job with the animation and art backgrounds.  The return of Mayo Suzukaze as Kenshin Himura is fantastic, also seeing the original Japanese cast return 15-years later is a major treat.  It was great to have Noriko Hidaka reprise her role as Sojiro Seta (a few years ago, she also reprised her role for the ""Gunbuster"" animated film release).  But you have Tomo Sakurai returning as Misao, Miina Tominaga as Yahiko, Ken Narita as Hajime Saitou and more.  So, it's a great reunion after all these years to bring back the Japanese voice actors.

And I hope that with the release of the two OVA's, it may lead people to watching the older releases or even purchasing the manga. But once again, those who never watched or read ""Rurouni Kenshin"" should be fine watching ""Rurouni Kenshin: New Kyoto Arc"" as they were released as films and directors know that chances of new viewers is quite high and try to make these storyline's, not too complex for them.

Sure, it helps to know the background of the characters and the storyline leading to the New Kyoto Arc but it's a pretty self explanatory storyline and the writers made it simple enough for those who have no intention of reading the manga series or watching the older anime.

But while the reunion of the voice talent and animation quality was a plus, I have to admit that its main hindrance lies in the fact that the storyline was too condensed.  Major battles were too quick for my taste and you miss out on storyline relating to the characters.  But I suppose one can easily watch the anime TV series or read the manga, but I felt that perhaps a third OVA could have made things much better, especially in the fighting sequences.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality for both OVA's are very good and audio quality is in lossless, crystal clear dialogue but not too active when it comes to surround sound use or LFE.  And unfortunately, there are no special features which is a surprise, considering it would have been great to interview the director or even the original Japanese voice acting talent about reuniting nearly 15-years later.  Also, with this New Kyoto Arc, you get a rating of TV MA V because of the violence but also a sex scene (no nudity) featuring Nishio and Yumi.

Overall, ""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" was a pretty cool way to celebrate its 15th year anniversary.  I found the two OVA's to be entertaining and I enjoyed them for the fact that it reunited the Japanese cast, features all new animation and its presented in HD.  It's caveat is due to the fact a large part of that storyline has been eliminated in order to fit the entire arc in two 45-minute OVA's, which may not please the more hardcore fans.  But for those who have no intention of watching the older series or even reading all the manga, may be fine with this Blu-ray release.

Until the original series is released on Blu-ray, ""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" is worth checking out!",1364601600,4,6511,4.684534270650263

The story is done way different then the anime, complete opposite. The graphics is nicely done, good show of the current time of animation. To be warn at first you will be confuse because of the original anime story, but after a while it grows on you. At least it did for me. Only a few cons to this new version which are in my case I was able to look pass it. 1) the voice acting (dub) was by far really really horrible, there was no emotion whats so every. For example in one sense Kaoru and Yahiko are arguing and it sounds as if they are just like robots. In the Japanese version (which are the original case)sounds much better. 2) This story arc was not funny what so ever. I found myself bored half the time. other than that I enjoyed myself and it is worth buying if you are looking to collect every Rurouni Kenshin. But be warn watch it in sub version, trust me even if you are the type of person who is lazy to read (which I am as well) it will sound so much better.",1364601600,2,1123,4.063063063063063

You will be absolutely and totally lost, with no way of figuring out who people are, why they are doing what they are doing, etc... The first segment is SO disjointed and rushed it's practically impossible to follow for those who ARE familiar with the series!  The second segment is slightly better. Part 2 doesn't follow the original plot line for either the manga OR the anime and goes merrily off into it's own territory, so it was a little easier to follow and a little more enjoyable. I liked seeing more of Monk Anji, and Yumi's role is expanded upon, but...

final verdict...if you're not a HUGE Kenshin fan, I'd pass on this. It's expensive, there are NO extras, and I wasn't even that impressed with the new animation. I'm being generous giving it 3 stars.",1364169600,7,844,4.657718120805369
5462350,1,B00AO05AZQ,"When they announced that Aniplex was going to release a new RK OVA, I was excited.

But then I read it was going to be a retelling of one of the more complex, longest story arcs in both the anime and the manga, I had my doubts. However, retellings can be good (Rebuild of Evangelion, Berserk, Hellsing Ultimate and so on), so I watched these two OVAs with an open mind.

But New Kyoto Arc is absolute garbage!

Important characters were removed, several important plot points were either removed, ignored or merged, the sword duels lack energy or any kind of passion, the soundtrack is made up of either remixes of memorable tracks from the TV series OST or new ones that are uninspired and immediately forgettable. No background information of the characters is given at any point, so those who never watched or read RK will feel completely lost, while those familiar to the series will get mad at how Aniplex treated such a beloved franchise with such contempt.

Perhaps the only decent feature is the English dub, which is actually better than the original English dub for the TV series. NKA features completely new animation, it looks good, but it falls apart when the characters have to fight one another.

If you like RK or anime in general, avoid New Kyoto Arc at all costs. It's not worth your time and money.",1363132800,16,1317,4.611111111111111
5462351,3,B00AO05AZQ,"Having watched the original Shishio arc, I can say that this 2 hour title has all-new footage, new dialogue, and even some major changes in storyline, in terms of survivors of the one-on-one battles.  It's worth a view, but definitely listen to the Japanese w/English subtitles, the dub is terrible.  The viewpoints of Shishio and some of the other villains come across better in this version, and Kenshin's retrieval of his new sakabatou is done well, but a bunch of scenes with Hiko and Saito are shortened or dropped altogether.  In fact, the battle with Shishio and his followers on the Black Ship takes the place of the final battles at his stronghold.  Worth watching, but original is still better, imo.",1363132800,,709,4.8347107438016526
5462352,5,B00AO05AZQ,Rurouni Kenshin and Inuyasha are the reason I love anime.  I loved the new Kyoto arc and was only disappointed that the original voice actors did not return and the story arc was shortened.  Despite this I highly recommend this latest entry in the Kenshin story.  I wish we would get more stories of this classic Japanese character.,1362528000,4,332,4.689655172413793
5462353,5,B00AO05AZQ,"Im not one to take shots but just a change of picture with simplified storyLOL it's insulting that 6 ppl actually found that helpful. Obviousy the person below and those who rated that remark have not actually seen this and is just going off the cover and some summaries they've seen i guess.

First lets clarify the title this is Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen Zenpen it is a remake of the Kyoto arch and Kenshin's battle with Shishio not sure why amazon is just listing it as Rurouni Kenshin and with the date of 1996 as this is not the original tv series nor the year it was released hopefully this will be corrected as not to confuse ppl.

Anyways back on point having seen and own the original series and as well as reading all the manga I have to say Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen Zenpen really was a pleasant surprise after hearing it was a remake you figure it was probably just going to be a recap cutting out some of the the filler from the tv series that wasn't in the manga but that isn't the case. There is absolutly no resued footage from the tv series it is all new animation which I have to say far surpasses that of it's predacessor tho seeing how it's been what over 10 years since the original tv series you would figure as much but the new breath taking animation alone isn't what gives this a worth watch/buy there is more to it than a pretty exterior. Rather than just following the same events/fights and battles leading up to the Shisho confrontation it offers new perspectives from Misao and other companions of Kenshin it's like looking from the outside in giving new narrative but don't worry Kenshin is very much still main attraction and the plot result is still the same just with added story and a new take on the fights.

I cant wait to purchase this and the second part upon release. I must say having watch the sub already online I was hoping they would dub it giving that always give me the extra incentive to buy and having the original english cast reunited would have been great but seeing how this is not being released by Mediablasters that will not happen it's a shame.

I am hoping that this sells well and that a part 3 will be made for those that don't the last season of the tv series after the shishio arc was all made up filler the final arc of the manga covering the next viliian former friend of Kenshin Yukishiro Enishi has yet to be animated hard to go into detail without spoiling if you have the chance read the chapters online after shishio you won't be dissapointed here's hoping Kenshin will one day get the proper send off it deserves.",1357862400,66,2595,4.4

8554997,2,B00AO05AZQ,"I thought it was going to be amazing to see my favorite Kenshin arc told anew with new animation and the old voice actors returning. The animation is refreshing and it flows beautifully and it's so nice to hear the old Japanese voice actors from the anime return to reprise their old roles - as no Kenshin film/anime would be the same without the iconic voices.. However, the movie forgoes the many unique stories that create the Kyoto Arc for a story that has already been told in a better way (referring to the 90's anime). The characters have been put aside, main events that are vital to the importance of the story are cut, and everything is RUSHED. This is why shows are created - so that the story can take as much time as it needs to tell the story as it needs to be told, episode by episode. Just stick to the anime/manga, please. :( Man - What a disappointment!",1492560000,,871,4.3496932515337425
8554998,2,B00AO05AZQ,"The animation is decently pretty. But that's about it. The story isn't as fleshed out as it should be. If you don't already know Kenshin you'll be lost. If you do already know Kenshin you will have almost certainly read or watched the original Kyoto Arc, which is superior to this.

Now about the dub. It's pretty awful. Now I know that they got the Kenshin from all the other OVA's and movies, but all around it's pretty lack luster. And most of the pronunciations are pretty awful as well. Now maybe this is just coming from a person who enjoyed the cast from the (Media Blasters) dub of the original anime, but this just was lacking. All around.

The Japanese track makes it better, but it doesn't do enough to realy save it. All around it's pretty lack luster. And actualy if we're honest about the animation - it looks pretty some places but it looks wonky and messed up plenty of other places. All around mediocre. If you want the Kyoto Arc - Read the manga. Watch the original anime. Watch the Live action movies. Just don't watch this.",1469059200,4,1043,4.455497382198953

8555000,2,B00AO05AZQ,Animation was good. But really trying to condense a whole arc into 2 hrs was not a good idea. And why throw a sex scene in? It was disturbing...,1458777600,,144,4.0
8555001,2,B00AO05AZQ,"I have seen the original show, the whole show. I bought the whole thing on DVD years ago. When I first saw that they were making an OVA of the show, I thought that it would be a fill in, type of thing. I thought that it would work with the original show, with additional things that happened.. A new story about things that may have happened in the middle of the original story, etc. Well, that could not be further from the truth.

All this was, is the name, with the same characters, with mostly the same opponents. But nothing was the same besides that. They completely left out the extra training that Kenshin and Sanosuke did. No new techniques, and no background info. Also leave out the decent battles, the whole cave in the mountain thing. No humor or much of a plot either. It is here, fight, 1 minute later (max) with a melodramatic ending, then the next one of the same. They leave so many loopholes in the OVA, that if you never saw the show, that it would leave you with more questions than answers. For example they go with the fact that Aoshi wants to kill Kenshin for the title of the best. But do not tell that more then in a passing. No history on why, nothing about why or how is comrades die, etc. They even gave Sojiro emotions in the middle of the fight to make the fight shorter too. Then add in the fact that they emphasize on Kenshin not killing anyone, but then he splits Shishio's head open (would that not kill him), yet he still is keeping to his no kill values? If that is not a contradiction, that what is it?

I can go with an slightly alternate show. I loved both versions of Negima, season one and two, which two was an alternate writing of one. But at least they kept in the comedy in the story line. This show, was a hacked story line, with very little explanation for anything, plus they completely changed just about everything that happened, and just left the main principle of things that happened. and nothing more. They needed more explanations, more of what made the show popular.. Its comedy.. more of.. well, just about everything. Basically, the best way I can explain this is take a running show like this, take a full seasons worth of fights, explanations, and fit them into a single episode, and leave out all the why's, how's, and where's, and that explains this version. Then add in there a couple scenes that tried to put in some humor, and very poorly execute that scene, and then add in some bad translations, or writing in with it.. and that pretty much sums it up.

I love anime, and am not one of those die hard, you can not change anything, type of fans... but you can not cut a full episode down to one line, and expect it to come out good. and that is what they did. In my opinion, this has to be one of the worst remake, extra OVA releases that I have ever seen. Even if I would have never seen the show, I would still think that this was a horrible release. On a positive note, they picture quality was better.. Yea.. (a little sarcasm anyone)",1456617600,,3005,4.30565371024735

8555003,1,B00AO05AZQ,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. This is meant to be a retelling of the Kyoto Arc of the Rurouni Kenshin anime. For context, in the original anime, the Kyoto Arc is the meat of the story. The Tokyo Arc is the beginning that introduces all the character which this OVA skips. So new viewers will be completely confused as to what is going on or who anyone is. This retelling crams the Kyoto Arc into a single 2 part movie, completely skims through character development, and has no emotional punch.  Not only is the storytelling horrible, but the art style is ugly. Characters look dull as opposed to the vibrant style of the first series. The only redeeming aspect is the animation (not to be confused with art style). The animation during the fight scenes is fluid and cool to watch. The music (which seems to be a new rendition of the old soundtrack) is okay as well. The english dub is a complete joke (whereas the original show's dub was very well done). Overall, this OVA is a disgrace to the franchise. Horrible for new viewers, and disgusting to old fans. Stick to the 90s anime series",1447804800,,1089,4.5561224489795915
