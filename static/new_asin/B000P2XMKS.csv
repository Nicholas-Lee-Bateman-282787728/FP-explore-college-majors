2808252,5,B000P2XMKS,"I saw this and then bought the whole PBS series.  This is really well-made with great information, great stories and Ted Allen has such an easy-going manner.  There is also these great extras about ""Everything you Should Know About Wine""--which actually helped me a lot (and I thought I knew a fair amount about wine) and a nice overview of French wine. Loved this...know I want to go to France!!",1193270400,,396,4.642857142857143
2808253,5,B000P2XMKS,"This series is a great intro and overview of wine. For me, it made the seemingly complex world of wine and wine appreciation fun and very accessible. I'm a fan of Ted Allen's from Iron Chef and Queer Eye and he has the right mix of knowledge and humor that really made this a fun and great series. I'm giving it to my friends who love wine or want to learn more...",1192060800,9,364,4.069444444444445

8188644,5,B000P2XMKS,"If you are just starting to unravel the confusion of European wine or just need a solid review if you have been there, this is the educational tool for you.  It's nice to repeat sections over again and get the fine details in Ted Allen's presentation.  it's now part of my reference library.",1355011200,,291,4.471698113207547
8188645,2,B000P2XMKS,Good tips but mostly a manufactures advertising DVD (mostly from the Gallo family and others). I would not recommend to buy this item.,1354147200,2,134,4.869565217391305
8188646,2,B000P2XMKS,"This DVD didn't offer much in the way of wine education. Rather it was a tour around California, mostly at different wine festivals in which the moderator would interview various people at the events. Didn't really have any structure to the DVD set, other than categorizing it by regions in CA that he visited.  Was hoping that it would offer more in the way of education and discuss wine making and talk about different varietals. If you're looking for much better education as well as imagery, I would suggest the suberb DVD collection on wine by Jancis Robinson,",1324512000,8,565,4.76530612244898
8188647,5,B000P2XMKS,"Funny and charming presentation on wine.  I learned so much in just one session, and it was done so well that I was able to recall every detail to share with others. Very hip, very clever, and full of information.  Absolutely superb teaching method for the novice and more learned on this subject.  Friends and family who have watched it have had the same reaction.  Great product!!  Highly recommend it!!",1267574400,,405,4.728571428571429
8188648,5,B000P2XMKS,"This is a fantastic introduction to the world of wine.  It's divided into six episodes, each covering wine from a different region. Each episode is 30 minutes, so you're not getting a ton of depth here, but that's not really the idea. It's a very broad, relatively simple introduction to wine and the world of wine drinking, and it's just informative enough to be entertaining for both the novice and the afficionado.

The first episode is a general introduction to the world of wine, and would make a great setpiece on its own. It's a brief overview of wine drinkers and producers, and is a fitting gateway into the rest of the series. Later episodes cover the Napa Valley, Sonoma, the Central Coast (of California), and France. I would have liked to see less California and more exploration of old-world wine regions, but that's just personal preference. Spending three hours with Ted talking about California and France is pretty great as it is.

It's not without its pretentious side, but let's be honest, it's a show about wine. Of course it's going to be somewhat pretentious. While most things are explained well, there are sometimes terms or concepts that are tossed about that might seem a little obtuse to the novice oenophile. This was most apparent in the first episode, owing I think to how little time it has to cover so much ground. Later episodes have more room to breathe. The second episode in particular is a lot of fun, giving a great history of the Paris wine tasting that put California on the map.

There's a lot of beautiful imagery and a lot of really great information. If you want an easy way to start learning about wine, or if you already love wine and want to bask in an undemanding journey through California and France, consider picking this up. I guarantee that you'll be anxious to head down to your local wine shop and pick up a few bottles.",1205366400,14,1876,4.641566265060241
8188649,5,B000P2XMKS,"I love wine and wine culture, and this series is terrific. Ted Allen provides a witty and far-from-boring narration.  The footage, especially of Napa and France, is beautiful.

Bonus features add even more -- Volume 1 includes a segment with Paul Roberts, Wine Director at the famed French Laundry in Napa about how to pair wine and food.",1193875200,8,338,4.810344827586207
