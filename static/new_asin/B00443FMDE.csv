8415735,5,B00443FMDE,"This series is awesome.  You can preview it on youtube: type in Warrior Women Budica or Mulan. These are historical documentaries about women warriors. Budica's story mentions that her 2 daughters were raped.  It did not show it. There are many battle scenes (this is about war). I do not see a recommended age listed, so I do not understand the other comment. However, war films are usually for adults.  I think for Americans a typical 13 year old could watch this, benefit from the information, and understand it.

Each title alone sells for $22 which is normal for DVDs and cheap for documentaries. The Joan of Arc is more expensive is purchased alone $39 maybe it is rare or more in demand.  These are from Europe, so this is not a bad deal for 5 movies. Buying it as a set, you save a lot of money.",1404864000,,803,4.398648648648648
8415736,2,B00443FMDE,"Great series, every one should see it as an educational series to make men and women realize women have a very diferent history then most people think and women are capable of being fine warriors.
 I would love to own it, BUT, and that's a big BUT, it is priced way to high.
Come on Amazon ! ,  give us a break !
Come down on the price and I would buy, $ 20.00 or less.
I give this a two star because no show with only 3 discs is worth over $ 200.00 !
If the producers want to receive a five star from shoppers on amazon , then they can price their work at a more normal price. !!!!!!!!!!!!!",1399334400,2,591,3.87603305785124
8415737,5,B00443FMDE,"This documentary is from Discovery Channel Europe.  Never shown in the US this is in fact a wonderful 5 part series on famous women warriors - the Icini warrior queen Boudica, a real Mulan Wang Cong'er, Joan of Arc, the Apache Lorenze, and Irish patriot and pirate Grace O'Malley.  Narrated by none other the Warrior Princess herself, Lucy Lawless, the documentary is well researched and has great production values.  The reenachments are well done and there are plenty of demonstrations of ancient weapons and fighting tactics.  The documentary is both entertaining and educational for both adults and students.  I have no idea why this series made in 2007 never was shown in the US but it certainly deserves a wider audience.",1373932800,6,727,4.975206611570248
