2317675,5,B0009SO7PW,"Wether you're new to the game or just wanting to improve, Swing the Handle series works! Eddie Merrins keeps it simple. Have you ever had a golf lesson stressing back swing positions, move this, now move that and you end up with a swing like Charles Barkley? Well this isn't the way the little pro teaches. He  concentrates on the target and how to get there! As he instructs different celebreties and pros you feel like he's talking to you. And it's not all chopped up like so many videos. He keeps your attention because you're learning.
Plus it works! And he's consistent throughout the entire series, from the short game to drives, he makes it simple. And if you have trouble getting out of the sand, he has a sure-fire way to help you. It really just makes sense. If you've done like so many of us have and read all the articles trying to improve only to find out you have conflicting information, then you will love this series. You will have the same golf coach all the way through. He will answer those questions you have and clarify your game. That reminds me, his discussion with David Feherty about playing the game really helped me with the ""right"" thinking as you play.
Simple and effective. It is already making my game more consistent. I shot a easy 79 (I didn't make any birdie putts) on Dec. 12th in Tulsa, just by swinging the handle. Looking forward to next year.
Hope this helps you too!

2317676,5,B0009SO7PW,Product was new and it arrived ahead of schedule. Impressive. I would do business with them in a second. Thanks much!,1257379200,,117,4.619047619047619
2317677,5,B0009SO7PW,"The title says it all. Eddie makes it very simple just like everyone tells you it should be.  Pay attention to the grip and the position of the handle at the address or set up.  This is well worth your money.

2317678,4,B0009SO7PW,"After viewing the ""Swing the Handle"" video collection, I found the main concept of swinging the handle fairly interesting and valuable.  While it's not ""wall to wall"" full of original golf information, it does contain a number of good ""nuggets"" of golf instruction.  They include keeping your body behind the golf shaft during the entire swing, tips on developing the right rhythm, tempo, and timing in the swing, and keeping a positive but realistic attitude about your golf game.  I think that the video series was a little long for the amount of actual instruction that is included, but with a little patience, you can get through it and benefit from Mr. Merrins' golf tips.  I would say that I would have been disappointed if I had paid the original price for the videos when they first came out, but at the current price of about $25, it's well worth it and the information may help your golf game.",1217721600,4,903,4.660377358490566
2317679,4,B0009SO7PW,"So very many of your everyday golfers could learn so much, play so much better and find enjoyment out of the game if they learned from this DVD series!
This set contains a wealth of easily explained, valuable, and usable information. The ""Little Pro"" teaches about swinging (the handle) in the most efficient and effective way, how to get the resulting ball flight you want, the achievement of rhythm and tempo, connectedness and so much more.
I'm sorry I didn't get the set earlier. I wasn't interested in seeing celebrities swing a golf club...but it works well.
I do have to agree with the first reviewer on a couple of points. It would be great if the producers came out with a more concise version.
I am also not a fan of the chipping methodology noted - but sometimes it works well for golfers that are not very accomplished.
Also, Mr. Merrins is a very gentle, low key man and some times the pacing becomes slow. Just be aware of that and don't let it keep you from owning this DVD set. Its great!",1199664000,9,1004,4.461956521739131
2317680,5,B0009SO7PW,The ultimate in sound and proven golf instruction that stands the test of time and keeps things simple.,1195171200,,103,4.777777777777778
2317681,3,B0009SO7PW,"First of all, ""swing the handle"" is a great concept. If you can learn that in the first video, it would worth a lot more than what you paid for the video. This will cure most of major swing problems out there - slice, hood, fat, and thin, etc.

Second good idea from the video is the sand play. The ""tee in the sand"" concept will make you a good sand player.

Some other ideas are not so hot, e.g. chipping. You DO NOT want to land the ball outside the green, as he suggested in the video.

The biggest problem with this video -- it is too long. More editting work should be done to make the total time 2 hours, and try not to cover everything in golf (he probably he knows that he is not super at some aspects of golf playing). Adding them to the video just diverts viewers' attention away from his core concepts.",1192665600,11,814,4.1069182389937104

8066206,4,B0009SO7PW,I bought this several years ago and it has been a great help to my golf game. Yes the videos are long and require your full attention and some practice. Long story short I went from shooting rounds in the 108 range to high 80's low 90's in one season!,1394150400,,251,4.04
8066207,5,B0009SO7PW,"This is very informative and entertaining, a must buy for anyone who loves golf and wants to improve their game.
MR. Merrins covers the complete game. This is a total package.",1389225600,,175,4.67741935483871
8066208,1,B0009SO7PW,The book show no clear golf techniques. It does show some known individuals swinging a golf club. A complete 5 disc set about much of nothing.,1385683200,,142,4.5
8066209,1,B0009SO7PW,"I purchased them used on amazon and was pleasantly surprised when out of the set only two of the dvds had been opened.  I really looked forward to them even though several of the other reviewers mentioned how slow and disjointed they were.  They were so slow and mechanical that we could not watch them.  Imagine two speak and spells doing an infomercial on how to play golf.

My wife and I set down to watch the first one and after about 15 minutes she commented that being forced to watch them might qualify as an ""enhanced interrogation technique.""

I will attempt to resell it and the next person who buys it will be pleasantly surprised that only two of the dvds have been opened until they watch about 15 minutes of it and decide to resell it.

I wasn't sure it was fair to post this review without watching them all, but the point is you will not get through these, so that is the review.  They are as bad as the others say.",1373068800,,931,4.285714285714286
8066210,5,B0009SO7PW,This video from the little pro who has 50 some years of experience in teaching golf has some wonderfully simple instruction that anyone can understand. I have studied many golf videos and I would go out after watching the instruction thinking that this is what I had been doing wrong. I would always feel like this is it. This is what is missing in my golf swing. sometimes I got results for a short time. Then I would go out and play again and I would fall right back into playing poorly. I would feel very disappointed. I would say to myself I will never understand this game perhaps I should give up. But I kept on trying and again I would have better results. But soon I was back to making poor shots and I would fall all apart and be back to frustration. I knew something basic was missing in my swing. Then I heard about Eddie Merrins through golf instruction on the golf channel. The show was on release the golf club properly. The teacher Martin Hall recommended Eddie Merrins Book for proper release. I also bought the tape series by Eddie and then I had a break through as swinging the handle finally broke through my misunderstanding of the golf swing. Now my game has improved over a 100%. Anyone can get this if they play the tape enough and take the little pros advice. The golf swing is not about the face of the club but about the forearms and the handle. This swing thought brings every thing together and is so simple to understand. Good luck! buy the book and video.,1354147200,2,1485,4.364620938628159
8066211,5,B0009SO7PW,Thank a lot for my purhase. All is alwright in time and the chipping was without trouble. The Video is correct and it's fun. PL,1329436800,,127,4.12
8066212,3,B0009SO7PW,"I am glad I didn't pay infomercial prices for this set. When I saw the commercial endorsed by the Shark, Byron Nelson, Fred Couples, etc... I was sure I wanted this DVD set. Now that I have it, I cannot easily get through the whole set like I can with Leadbetter's, McCord's or Mickelson's DVDs. The pro host, E Merrins, is waaaaay too verbal and ends up being downright boring. In summary, what he is saying is very simple and could be edited and covered much more quickly. The section in which he's tutoring Robert Wagner (he calls him RJ), he completely and rudely talks over Wagner to the point that Wagner is visibly frustrated and losing his patience. My wife and I laughed throughout this section. Wagner actually shrugs and grabs his forehead as he sulks while looking at the ground in one scene.
  If the concept of ""swinging the handle"" sounds like something you've heard of before, it is. This seemingly unoriginal philosophy is a direct relative of the original by Ernest Jones' ""swing the clubhead"" method. By the way, Jones' book is extremely verbal and I read it just before I watched Merrins' video series. I think the little pro (Merrins) is trying to make his modern mark as the new Jones. If you want a lesson on how educated people may have spoken two or three generations ago, you should buy this video. This series is way too wordy and teaches very few concepts for the amount of time invested in watching it.
  Interesting key point: If you want to learn how to golf with longevity, you might gain a little bit out of this set when it comes to taking stress off of your lower back. Wagner does make a statement that there is no stress on his back using the little pro's swing method.

Bottom line: It was cheap. There are better but more expensive dvd series out there. David Leadbetter's is the best I've seen. Golf for Dummies with Gary McCord is an excellent single dvd. I personally think this Swing the Handle series is just OK. For $24, it may make a decent gift for a golf fan.

Pros: Nice dvd layout visually. A few key tips can be pulled out of an extensive session of invested time.

Cons: You have to sit through a lot of talk to get the each simple concept. The banter ends up losing your attention.",1261958400,9,2234,4.447432762836185
