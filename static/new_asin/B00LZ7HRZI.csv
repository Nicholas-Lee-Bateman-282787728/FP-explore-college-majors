The original Tough Guise version is more effective, in my opinion, because the media clips were more vivid and interesting, and the content scope was broader.  The Tough Guise 2 version focused on gun violence, with far less emphasis on interpersonal, dating, and domestic violence.  Further, the narration was overwhelming.  Instead of letting the visual images and media clips ""speak"", Mr. Katz filled every second with a barrage of information; a surprising approach for someone trying to emphasize the visual and emotional effects of media.  Although I respect his passion and knowledge, the pressured, nearly evangelical tone became tedious at about the 30 minute mark.  Sadly, I have had to return to the original version for my domestic violence offender clients.  While they laugh a little at some of the outdated references, the original Tough Guise video has far more impact, is more visually interesting, has far less ""ranting"" by the narrator, and is more suited for generating discussion about the effects of media on the social construction of masculinity. If you have the original Tough Guise DVD, don't waste your money on this updated version.",1433894400,6,1200,5.186528497409326
8669160,5,B00LZ7HRZI,"Excellent endictment of our sick expectations of men and how narrow our definition of manhood has become, so that manliness in the face
of a loss ""allows"" only anger & or violence as a ""manly"" reaction.  (guns therefore secondary).  Look at our foreign policy.  We can no longer
admit mistakes (not manly) and have a narrow range of foreign policy interventions, primarily violent.",1430352000,3,381,5.015873015873016
