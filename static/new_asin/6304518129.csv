7874570,5,6304518129,Just as good as the rest of the series by this group.  You do need a region-free or multi-region DVD player (they aren't that pricey. One is well-worth buying for these shows alone). Includes the additional Christmas program as well.,1424217600,2,233,4.825

7874572,5,6304518129,"All 3 of my boys have loved this video.  All kids go through that ""horsey"" or""moo-moo"" or ""doggie"" stage, and this video has all those plus lots of other farm animals in extended live-action footage. We have completely worn out our original copy of this video, so I'm buying a new copy for my 22 month old. I highly recommend this to all families.",1084406400,,347,4.421875
