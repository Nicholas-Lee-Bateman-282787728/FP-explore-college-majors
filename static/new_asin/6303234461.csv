603659,3,6303234461,"The Brits love nothing so much as their heroic failures, and Scott of the Antarctic is pretty much the poster boy for Imperial underachievers, thanks in part to the publishing success his very heavily edited diary (none of those crabby bits blaming everyone else for his own mistakes made the cut) and a neat bit of mythmaking from J.M. Barrie, who invented a fictional heroic death for him.

Surprisingly, although it doesn't dare to criticize and does play down Scott's awkwardness and snobbery, Ealing's beautifully lensed color epic holds back from deifying him, offering a more sober portrait than you might expect. Amundsen is purely an offscreen presence here, despite proffering the sneaking suspicion that he's a bit of a bounder and a cad for getting there first by being competent (not the British way of exploring at all!), and legendary Norwegian Arctic pioneer Nansen only gets a brief look in (and no mention of his affair with Scott's wife: goodness, no!), but then this is more a film about stoic endurance in the face of `bad luck' (rather than bad leadership and bad planning) than the race for the South Pole. John Mills is surprisingly good casting for Scott, his slight awkwardness with others suggesting he'd done his homework (his gutted reaction to reaching the Pole second is convincingly bitter), and the supporting cast is full of welcome mainstays of the British film industry - Kenneth More, James Robertson Justice (without a beard for once!), Reginald Beckwith et al. Although the integration with the studio work isn't always entirely convincing, the location photography is genuinely staggering and Vaughn Williams score is impressively forlorn.

As others have noted, the Region 1 NTSC transfer is atrocious. Seek out the UK PAL DVD instead, which is devoid of extras but does have a good transfer.",1200441600,,1833,5.0462046204620465
603660,5,6303234461,"I agree with the other reviewers about the poor quality of the dvd. However, the movie places you there with Scott and the others as their mission of research, and, of course, personal glory degenerates into a battle for survival in the frigid air of the Antarctic. Can you possibly imagine day after day of below zero weather, pulling a sleigh, not with dogs, but human power, camping each night during the howling sub-zero wind, and slowly realizing you are going to die? The movie places one right there with Scott and the others. Very, very eerie and frightening. A must see for historical adventure fans.",1188345600,,609,4.754716981132075

There's now a far superior transfer available from Optimum Classic as part of their Easling Studios Collection - on sale from amazon.co.uk: vibrant colours and a much better soundtrack, so the extra dollars for that version are worth it!",1166313600,8,522,5.226190476190476
603664,5,6303234461,"Director Charles Frend showed he could turn real life stories into stirring drama with war films like The Foreman Went to France, and here turned his hand to a different sort of heroism. Whilst the war films showed small victories in what we hoped would prove to be a big victory, Scott Of The Antarctic shows a peculiar sort of victory, that of the human spirit in the midst of failure.
Whilst Scott is held up as a role model to every schoolboy, he was a flawed man, sometimes putting his own vanity and the desire to win above the safety of his crew. The film does not dwell on this, but the shoestring budget and hasty preparations are shown, as are some of Scott's own misgivings. The war had honed Ealing studios' skills in making films in the drama-documentary style and the realism of the sets is to be applauded. Photographs of the hut Scott built look almost identical to that shown on screen and the recreation of the Antarctic on Soundstage 1 in Ealing Studios is a marvel (though some scenes are shot on location in Norway).
The casting is very nice, with square jawed leading men Kenneth More and John Gregson in supporting roles here, James Robertson Justice in an unusually subtle role as Taff Evans and of course John Mills as Scott. The length of Mills's career, spanning from 1932 to date is surely tribute to his acting skills, as well as his amiablity. He isn't the John Gregson type you would necessarily associate with the heroic lead, but a smaller man, more human than super-human, and this probably works better in portraying a man like Scott.
A major contribution to the film's success is the rousing music by Vaughan Williams, which somehow adds a sense of realism and scale to the landscapes. Vaughan Williams cited this score as a particular favourite of his, and it makes a change from the usual Benjamin Frankel music that Ealing employed during this period.",1008806400,16,1890,4.6447761194029855
603743,5,6303234461,"The American Museum of Natural History put on a wonderful exhibit between May 30, 2009 and January 2, 2010 called ""Race to the End of the Earth""; a link to the online version appears in the first comment (it is an excellent overview of the ""race"".

The Curator, Ross MacPhee, put together a list of twelve ""most helpful"" books and movies for the guides and the explainers at the Museum. The complete list is attached at the end of this Review, and MacPhee considered this movie one of the twelve most essential.

If you don't know much about the ""Race"", take a look at the Museum's online exhibit before watching Scott of the Antarctic or read some of the leading references. As someone who knew the story well, I found this a very moving, deeply emotional, version, of one of the great sagas of exploration.

Despite the black and white cover, this is an early technicolor film made in England telling Scott's story from his trip to recruit Wilson in England until Scott's last moments in the brilliantly photograped scenes in the tent eleven miles from a large depot that would have saved the lives of Scott, Wilson and Bowers.

(In an ironic twist in real life, not shown in the film, Wilson brought a young and inexperienced relative along on the trip; Apsley Cherry-Garrard would travel with Wilson and Bowers on a trip to collect penquin eggs during the winter before Scott's assault on the Pole. Cherry-Garrard wrote a brilliant history of the expedition, The Worst Journey in the World, and was haunted for the rest of his life after finding the tent of the three dead men, and in particular the bodies of Wilson and Bowers.)

The film was made in Greenland and England, with some footage from Antarctica in 1948 and released in 1949. It was a big budget film with excellent actors and sets, wonderfully evocative music, and a real efforts to be accurate. The director was able to capture a great deal of the feeling of the era: the deep competition between Scott and Amundsen -- Amundsen's telegram to Scott that he was ""going South"" had to have been devasting to Scott but the stiff upper lip he displayed in front of his men as played by John Mills (and his distress alone with Wilson, played by Harold Warrender, a few moments later) are marvelous.

Ironies abound. Scott consults Nansen while planning the assault on the Pole. ""Tractors, ponies, dogs"" says Scott. ""Dogs, dogs, dogs,"" says Nansen. ""When the tractor fails, you'll only have a pile of metal."" Bowers repeats Nansen's ""a pile of metal"" when the second tractor fails during the assault. And, a brief camera shot of dog tracks in the snow at the Pole tells who was right with simple brutal elegance.

Scott's face while he reads Amundsen's letter to the King of Norway sent shivers down my spine. If I hadn't known the story, I'm not sure the scene would have had so much impact on me. But, I knew that Scott did take the letter back with him as Amundsen had requested, that the letter proved that Amundsen had ""priority"", and, perhaps most ironic, Amundsen had ""gone South"" although he had been publicly planning to try for the North Pole; he changed his plans because both Frederick A. Cook and Robert E. Peary claimed to have reached the North Pole. Those nuances would have escaped me without knowing the background of the story.

(Amundsen has been attacked for ""racing"" rather than seeking scientific goals; granted, but he was a patriotic Norwegian, just at the time Norway was escaping from Swedish domination, and national accomplishment was important for both Amundsen and given England's incredible accomplishments in discovery perhaps less important to Scott.)

There are many human moments in the film, understated pain when men are forced to drive the ponies hard or to shoot them, the simple gestures of removing and then replacing a rock back on the sledge on the return journey while the men were man hauling, the closeness of the four and then three last survivors in the tent while the wind howled, and even humor:

Herbert Ponting F.R.P.S. [played by Clive Morton: ""The sleeping bag, a poem. On the outside grows the furside; on the inside grows the skinside. So the furside is the outside, and the skinside is the inside. One side likes the skinside inside, and the furside on the outside. Others like the skinside outside, and the furside on the inside. If you turn the skinside outside, thinking you will side with that side, then the soft side, furside's inside, which, some argue, is the wrong side. If you turn the furside outside, as, you say, it grows on that side, then your outside's next the skinside, which for comfort's not the right side. For the skinside is the cold side, and your outside's not your warm side. And two cold sides side by side are not right-side when side to side! If you decide to side with that side, turn the topside furside inside. Then the cold side furside skinside, beyond all question, inside out!""

[Morton's relief at completing the recitation is priceless!]

I could go on and on about telling moments in this fine re-enactment of Scott's doomed attempt at ""priority"", but will close echoing the Curator's opinion; this film is essential if you wish to understand Scott's assault on the South Pole. Forgive the poor transfer, hope for a re-issue, but watch this film.

603746,5,6303234461,"After the death of Captain Scott and the last of his men, the English made sure he was made into an iconic hero. This movie, made in the 1940s, follows that edited version of history. Scott did make mistakes, but he and his men were examples of the heroic English spirit. A lot of the things that went wrong were chalked up to extraordinary 'bad luck.'

I like to contrast this movie with the series, ""The Last Place on Earth,"" which was made in the 1980s. That series is also very well done, but it's revisionist history and it attempted to strip away Scott's heroic veneer. Instead they showed Scott as a weak man and a tyrant longing for fame who callously treated some of his men. Some of his men hated him. The series showed that the bad luck Scott and his men experienced were caused by the bad planning of Scott himself.

The truth lies somewhere in between, but of the two productions, I prefer the original movie. There can be no doubt that Scott and his men were heroes and extraordinary human beings. Their suffering was incredible. A recent journal also helps vindicate Scott. He had ordered that men with a dog team be sent out to meet his party beyond the one ton depot. These orders were bungled. Scott and the remainder of his crew died just 11 miles short of that depot. They might have been saved had his orders been followed.

It was an accumulation of mistakes by Scott and others that led to the tragic end....and yes, there WAS bad luck and plenty of it. That's why this original movie is still the best. The epic mini-series from the 80s went over the top with their Scott bashing. The pendulum is swinging back toward Scott's favor.

What really makes this movie is the music. The famous Vaughan Williams wrote the score and he was so enchanted with the project that he later turned to the music into his 7th symphony. His music captures perfectly the Antarctic landscape, and especially the tragic ending. This symphony is currently available for purchase on Amazon.com.",1413072000,,1995,4.564245810055866

603748,4,6303234461,"In retelling the now-familiar tale of Captain Scott's expedition to the South Pole, director Charles Frend makes some points of particular significance to post-war Britain (the film was released in 1948).  The group of intrepid explorers, including Scott himself (John Mills), Wilson (Harold Warrender), Taff Evans (James Robertson Justice), and Oates (Derek Bond) stick together through thick and thin.  They might be reluctant to display their emotions, but they display the kind of loyalty and solidarity that is not only admirable, but helps to sustain their collective spirit.  For a bankrupt Britain recovering from the rigors of World War II, this was an important point - especially after having experienced one of the coldest winters in living memory in 1947.  SCOTT OF THE ANTARCTIC also emphasizes the spirit of nationalism - even if the explorers fail in their quest, they show a stoicism and tenacity that is truly extraordinary.  Such qualities were as important in 1948 as they were in 1912.  The film is surprisingly high-budget (for Ealing Studios); although some of the sequences are obviously studio-bound, some of the location photography (by Geoffrey Unsworth, Osmond Borradale and Jack Cardiff) is truly breathtaking.  The script contains some familiar lines (notably Oates leaving the tent saying to his colleagues ""I may be some time""), but the ending is still beautifully handled, with the camera focusing on the three luckless explorers finally lying down to die, even though they only have eleven miles to complete their trip.",1402876800,,1553,5.314285714285714

I read a review that described this film as ""important"" and I could not agree with that more.

603806,4,6303234461,"This is a first-class film but, as has been said of Vaughan Williams' Pastoral Symphony, it is one in which not very much happens. Vaughan Williams wrote the film score and subsequently turned it into an edition for concert performance as his Symphony No. 7. The film is about the ill-fated journey made by Robert Falcon Scott (John Mills) and his companions to the Antarctic in 1910-12. There were over a dozen of them when they first landed on the Antarctic ice so that they had enough men to make partial journeys towards the Pole and create signposts and food stores. The party also included many fine scientists, as this expedition was a scientific one and not merely a challenging adventure. The complete journey involved a trek of nearly 1000 miles over ice-fields, glaciers and crevasses. The scenery is spectacular in a forbidding sort of way and the courage and determination of the men is well portrayed. Those who accompanied Scott on the last leg of the journey reaching the South Pole were Lawrence Oates (Derek Bond), P.O. `Taff' Evans (James Robertson Justice), Lt. Bowers (Reginald Beckwith) and Dr E.A. Wilson (Harold Warrender). Unfortunately, a rival team led by Norwegian Amundsen had arrived at the Pole a month earlier. Scott and his men all died on the return journey. An epic atmospheric film, well acted.

603810,4,6303234461,"This effective and affecting film presents what was (at the time of its production, at least) the accepted account of Captain Scott's attainment of the South Pole and his subsequent death--along with his companions--on the return journey from January - March 1912. The actual conduct of Scott's last expedition has undergone substantial historical analysis and reassessment in recent years, especially since the publication of Roland Huntford's _Scott and Amundsen_, which was itself splendidly adapted as a television miniseries under the title _The Last Place on Earth_(Central Television, 1985).

Comparing both filmed versions is an interesting exercise in both film making and mythmaking:  the heroic self-sacrifice of Scott and his companions on the altar of scientific progress portrayed in _Scott of the Antarctic_ contrasts sharply with the account of jingoistic arrogance and Scott's personal ineptitude as a expedition leader told in _The Last Place on Earth_.  Where _Scott of the Antarctic_ is a paen to the tragically idealistic attitudes and enterprise which undoubtedly inspired Scott and members of his crew (and which his countrymen chose to accept as the _true_ significance of their heroism), _The Last Place on Earth_ presents a dramatic account of both how and (most importantly) _why_ the so-called 'race to the South Pole' between Scott and Amundsen actually played-out in the way that it did.  _The Last Place on Earth_ demolishes the myth (first recorded by Scott himself in his journal after discovering that he and his party arrived second to the Pole)that the Norwegians had ""found an easy way up"" to the Polar plateau:  Amundsen and his men succeeded because they respected nature and prepared for the worst polar conditions that they could imagine, whereas Scott apparently regarded 'the struggle against nature' as an end in itself and based his planning solely on the conditions that he and his rival, Ernest Shackelton, had experenced in earlier expeditions.  Scott's trust in ""British pluck"" and his tragic reliance on improvosation (rather than imaginative planning beforehand) doomed his party to slow, cold, miserable (and, likely, unnecessary) deaths in the course of attaining their goal.

_Scott of the Antarctic_ is almost exhuberant in its exultation of heroic self-sacrifice; _The Last Place on Earth_ is a sobering antidote for such sentiment.  Both productions are compelling and worthwile films that present contrasting perspectives on a historical event and its significance.",1334275200,,2523,5.484536082474227

Even the little details, for instance saying ""shee"" instead of ""ski"" as they really did in those days, are well done. The photography is superb in its starkness and grandeur.

We see Scott, Dr. Bill, Owens trying to get enough money for the expedition. Scott and Bill are torn from their wives to try to be the first to the South Pole. We see them leaving on an old coal burning ship with dogs, ponies and snow tractors. Amundsen's teacher tells them before he only recommends dogs, dogs, dogs. You cant eat your snow machine if it brakes down. But Scott had his own ideas to use all 3 methods of getting to the pole. Shortly the tractors fail and the ponies don't last too long and are killed. The dogs only take them part way to the pole and they must manhandle their sleds. Scott takes 4 others to the pole rather than the original group of 3 so he over extends the polar party. Plus the weather gets really bad for that time of year.

Amundsen beats Scott's polar party to the pole as he used all dogs.

I developed great empathy toward Scott and his men trapped in their tent only 11 miles from One Ton depot where there was plenty of food and fuel. I could feel their pain, sickness, massive frostbite, loss of feeling in their limbs and starvation. All perish. You feel so sorry for these men who gave 110% trying there hardest to come back from the pole only to be blizzard in 11 miles from food and fuel.

In the book Worse Journey in the World there was more talk of Killer Whales trying to crack through thin ice or try to topple flows to get to dogs, ponies and men to eat them. Also penguin and seal hunting for food. The DVD did not show this although I didn't expect them to kill penguins, ponies etc. The ponies are taken around and you don't see them killed.

I gave the movie DVD 4 1/2 stars but being so close Ill rate it 5 stars. The sound was very good. The scenery was fantastic and the acting was superb. First read The Worst Journey in the World then get this DVD. An excellent movie with a good portrait of a tragic expedition.  Captain Scott and all his men were true heroes.",1285113600,7,2115,4.209876543209877
603868,4,6303234461,"History and heroism have always made for fertile ground for storytellers. The story of the ill-fated 1910-1912 British arm of  the race to the South Pole that was led by Captain Sir Robert Falcon Scott would prove to be no exception to that rule. While history's opinion of Scott and his expedition has tended to shift back and forth and thus can cloud the issue of this film's historical accuracy one thing is certain though. That is that this film, not matter one's thoughts on its historical accuracy, is a fine film armed with a fine cast, strong production values and a fantastic score. The result is a fine film recreation of the tale of Scott and his men.

To begin with the film boosts a fine cast of actors. John Mills plays Captain Scott as a heroic figure doing his best to lead his men in one of the harshest places on Earth, an interpretation that (if other reviews are anything to go by) is certainly cause for controversy six decades on but in the film's context works well.  If one needs any proof of just how good Mills is listen to him as he reads out entries from Scott's journal throughout the film. There's also a fine supporting cast including Harold Warreneder as Naturalist E.A. Wilson, Derek Bond as Captain Oates, Kenneth More as Lt. ""Teddy"" Evans, Reginald Beckwith as Lt. ""Birdie"" Bowers, Clive Morton as famed Antarctic photographer Herbert Ponting and even a young Christopher Lee in the role of Bernard Day. Sadly the only actresses in the film, Diana Churchill as Scott's wife and Anne Firth as Wilson's wife, seem to be far too constrained by the conventions of wive roles of the time. Overall though it is a fine cast.

Scott Of the Antarctic also boosts some strong production values as well. The sets of Arne Akermark are some fine recreations of the various elements of the expedition including the Terra Nova ship, Scott's base of operation and the tent interiors along the way to the pole and back. The costumes of Anthony Mendleson are also fantastic recreations of the outfits and uniforms worn by those who took part on the expedition. Then there's the make-up work which helps to bring a sense of the effects of the Antarctic wilderness upon the men of  the expedition. There's also some incredible cinematography as well that reaches not only from the sets but to footage of the Antarctic as well. All together they make for a meticulous and incredible recreation of the places and things involved in the expedition.

The film is also blessed with a fine score from composer Vaughan Williams. Williams score is an epic and sweeping piece that makes, all by itself, an incredible portrait not only of the expedition but of the icy continent. Of special mention is Williams pieces for the opening credits, Scott's entry from the end of the Discovery expedition, the Terra Nova's arrival in the Antarctic and the music that accompanies the films last few minutes. The quality of the music makes it no surprise that Williams took this score (of which only half the music he composed ended up in the film) and created his seventh symphony from it.

Last, but not least, there is the script. If other reviews that I've read are any indication of things it is that the script is the single most controversial aspect of the film. After some six decades, the controversies surrounding Scott's expeditions make it nay impossible to properly judge the film on its historical accuracy. That said there are some definite changes to the historical events (the death of P.O. Evans being a prime example) but these can be forgiven as virtually every film based on a historical event makes changes to the facts to suit its needs . Judging the script from a writing point of view alone, the script is pretty good in terms of most of its dialogue and compressing years worth of events into under two hours of screen time.

While the historical accuracy of the script will continue to be debated I'm sure, there are plenty of other fine things to be found in Scott Of The Antarctic. These include the fine cast, the superb production values and the fantastic score of composer Vaughan Williams. If one can say nothing else about this film it is this: that after six decades it remains a good old fashioned film of adventure and courage.",1253577600,,4260,4.685828877005347
603869,3,6303234461,"The Bottom Line:

Scott of the Antarctic follows the facts of the doomed Terra Nova expedition rather faithfully (if dryly) but it fails to delve much into the character of Scott, depict the cruel twists of fate that lead to the deaths of the explorers, or convey the sense of despair and futility that accompanied their ultimate demise (they were only 11 miles from critical supplies and fuel); I can't really recommend the film because if you already know all the details you won't get anything out of the rest of the film and if you don't know the details you'd be better served reading a book about the expedition.

603870,1,6303234461,"This 905 edition of Scott of the Antarctic should be withdrawn from sale by Amazon immediately. The picture looks like it has been taken from a VHS tape, by an operator holding a shaky hand held camera. The sound is tinny to the extreme. There is no need to tolerate a film issued in this poor quality. The Optimum Classic version shows how well the film has survived, with beautiful vibrant colour and excellent sound to do justice to the Vaughan Williams score.",1238716800,2,463,4.590361445783133
603871,5,6303234461,"`Scott of the Antarctic` (1949) is an early technicolor film made in England (the B&W DVD cover is inaccurate). It is a fictional re-telling of Scott's last voyage to the South Pole in 1913. The best written account is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Worst-Journey-in-the-World/dp/0143039385/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Worst Journey in the World</a>&nbsp;(1922). I watched this after finishing `Worst Journey` and didn't have high expectations but was very surprised and delighted, the film added to and enhances the book, at least the part about Scott's trip to the pole. This was a big budget studio film, the actors and sets and music are all top rate, some critics say it was robbed at the Oscars that year. The film goes to lengths to be accurate - the gear is just like one sees in the old pictures and films, the actors look like the real people, the events are for the most part all correct. More so, the film was able to capture an aspect that I had read about elsewhere, but didn't pick up in `Worst Journey`, and that is the sort of pseudo-Medieval errant knights romanticism that was a sub-text to the expedition. The actors look, talk and act like they belong in the era - a film like this could never be made today because there are no actors that could play the parts convincingly. This is really a must-see for anyone who has read Scott or `Worst Journey` as it will bring alive in full color the gear, people, scenes, and the general spirit and mood of the time.

There is another DVD edition of this film on Amazon with the blue cover and from the reviews there are complaints of a poor transfer. I'm no expert on these things but I didn't see any problem with the version reviewed here (with the B&W cover). The color looks a bit off only because it's an early Technicolor and the sound is perfectly fine. It's a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, but looks like a normal factory product.",1231372800,34,1946,4.86144578313253

I don't think it put enough stress on the depots that had been laid and the reason that they ended up like they did (don't want to give anything away).  It did portray the hard man-sledging like I had imagined it, but not the bone chilling cold and how wet they got which made their times in their sleeping bags horrible.

I can't evaluate specific qualities -cinematography, acting skills, special effects, etc. I wouldn't put much weight on this review unless, like me, you watched it because you've read all the Antarctic adventure books you could possily get your hands on and the only thing left is movies and that's why you watched this one.

For my part, the visuals dissappointed my imagination;I didn't believe the presentation. It was a worthwhile effort, I'm sure, but I think this movie experience would benefit from the improved sense of immersion that contemporary technologies are able to provide.

If you have an interest in Antarctica and the historical events of this ill-fated but incredibly brave exploration literally into the unknown, then this is for you.
