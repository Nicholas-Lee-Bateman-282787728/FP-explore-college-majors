The title of this event is very justifiable.  Rashad Evans, TUF 2 Champion, is fighting the poster boy of the UFC in Chuck Liddell.  He sat back and let Chuck push the pace and caught Chuck, knocking him out.  He definitely made a statement and went on to win the belt.

The main event was a great fight.  Rich Franklin vs Matt Hamill was a good fight as well, but it is frustrating to see someone like Hamill not use his wrestling talent and mainly strike.  Then again seeing how Franklin is pretty much the reason Hamill has a career with the UFC right now I'm sure he had a lot of mental issues in this fight.

I love all MMA events but this one only gets 3 fights because I'm revising my review system.  To get 4 and 5 stars the event has to be pretty damn good or satisfy some of my bias towards certain fighters. (Just being honest) Many of the fights on this  card were run of the mill and nothing spectacular.  I'd recommend it for any hardcore MMA fan or Rashad Evans fan.

The DVD special features are not the usual fighter followings, but it shows the camera crew go through the UFC event.  It was a nice change.",1237248000,,1133,4.213953488372093
8305600,5,B001GJ4TVA,"If you are into MMA fighting, you have to see UFC 88. This DVD is stacked with some of the best fights known to the sport. Seeing the Iceman get KO'd twice is enough reason to watch. One punch from Evans and Liddell is down. Seeing that brutal knockout is a must for any fan, or even anyone just getting into MMA.",1233187200,,313,4.064516129032258
8305601,5,B001GJ4TVA,"Im a big MMA fan and have been following it since the early days of pride and UFC. I purchase almost every payperview and travelled to Ohio for UFC 82 and Altanta for UFC 88 (following my favorite fighter Dan Henderson), and can honestly say that UFC 88 was phenominal. The card was stacked and with the exception of one fight, (the first of the night between Chonan and Carniero) every fight lived up to the expectations. There was a solid mix of finishes, 4 KO's/TKO, 1 Submission, 4 Decisions and all were entertaining. The Marquardt/Kampmann and Boetsh/Patt TKO's were brutal, and if the Lidell/Evans KO doesnt win knockout of the year its a travesty. The Henderson/Palhares, Pelligrino/Tavares and Brown/Kim fights, even though they went the full 3 rounds were all action packed and very worth the watch. All in all UFC 88 was one of the best events of the year and well worth the buy!",1228867200,6,890,4.67515923566879
8305602,5,B001GJ4TVA,"The UFC 2 Disc sets are all worth buying. For anyone who didn't follow UFC during the event or are just getting into it now, get the 2 Disc sets. They contain the countdown show which explains how a few of the fighters got to where they are in MMA and in the UFC. Great to learn a present history of these great fighters. It also has extra features that include UFC interviews and weigh ins which are all great to view before watching the event.

UFC 88 features a main event between undefeated 11-0 Rashad Evans and the most famous fighter in UFC history, Chuck ""The Iceman"" Liddell. Some much anticipated match ups went down before the main event though including 2 middleweight fights.

One being Nate Marquardt vs Martin Kampmann. Kampmann was coming off a win against Jorge Rivera at UFC 85 and Marquardt coming off a controversial split decision loss against Thales Leties at UFC 85. Kampmann is one of the smaller fighters in the middleweight divison and with Marquardt being one of the biggest opponents someone could face in the division, Kampmann has his hands full. This fight didn't last long and the fighter who won came to prove he has improved more then people thought.

The other middleweight match features Grecco Roman wrestling machine Dan Henderson against dangerous BJJ and leg lock specialist Rousimar Palhares. Many people didn't like this fight but if you know the history of these two competitors, it was an exciting fight. Palhares had gone through a tournament winning all 3 fights by leglock and Dan Henderson was coming off 2 straight losses to Anderson Silva and Rampage Jackson. I guess people didn't like this fight because the outcome was kind of predictable but there were some very exciting moments throughout.

There was also a light heavyweight match up between Rich Franklin and Matt Hamill. This was Franklin's debut in the LHW division and Matt Hamill was a good opponent to fight. Fight doesnt go the distance but the man who wins showed why he is still one of the best fighters out there.

The main event is a fight not to be missed. They play the end of it all over TV constantly. Probably the most devastating knockout strike in recent UFC history since Cro Cop/Gonzaga. Almost everyone though Chuck Liddell had the fight in the bag and would hand Rashad his first loss in his professional MMA career. He definately proved a lot of people wrong, including me. If you buy this dvd for one fight, this is the one!
