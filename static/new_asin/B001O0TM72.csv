8328594,5,B001O0TM72,"My son likes this. He is two and sometimes gets scared, but the end always is great and teaches them not to be afraid! However, he does cover his head sometimes. Overall, I would probably wait until they are a little older to buy this. My son has already seen it and asks to watch it again though.",1412640000,,297,4.137931034482759
8328595,3,B001O0TM72,"I can't stand thomas videos....I hate the way they narrate  ""he exclaimed joyfully"" and all of that kinda stuff.  It annoys me......but the kids like it, so who cares right??
I have had no issues with other Thomas videos....aside from finding them TOTALLY annoying.  But this one caught me off guard.  It is kinda creepy.  They talk about ghosts, and the trains are scared.  I am surprised they didn't focus on trick or treating or something less scary.  My kids are 1 and 3, and they don't seem to mind...I will continue to show it to them...but I think some kids may find it scary.  I always HATED scary movies, and still do.

The only other issue I have is this. One of the trains says ""SHUT UP"" to the other.  I couldn't believe it.  Why would the writers put this in there????  I am completely disappointed in them.
This thomas dvd will go to goodwill after halloween is over.

Looking at other Thomas dvd reviews....I see that several of them mention the trains saying ""shut Up"".  I don't see the need for the writers to do this.  Don't the writers know that say ""shut up"" would cause controversy/piss parents off???
What a bunch of bonehead writers!",1287446400,,1156,4.516908212560386
8328596,5,B001O0TM72,This was one of my son's favorite Thomas DVDs that I bought him last year. Due to all of his use the disc got scratched and did not work properly. I promised I would get him a new one this year and Amazon had the best price. This weekend though I did find it at Target for the same price and it came with a toy train which this one did not come with.,1254096000,,350,3.7432432432432434
