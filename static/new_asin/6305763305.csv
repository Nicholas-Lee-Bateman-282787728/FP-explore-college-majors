The movie is great, highly inspiring and motivating. It does goes to show that music is indeed a huge part of our  life. All stars were great, especailly Meryl Streep (she's the best).

1081228,3,6305763305,"I love Meryl Streep and this is a strong part. The story is real life and for that it is clear and good. But not a story incredibly told. Hackneyed good-cause story-telling of how inner-city (Harlem, NYC) troubled kids are saved by music and a very talented, persistent teacher, Roberta Guaspari, played exceptionally well by Streep. But the story, though true, feels more like a fund-raiser than a great film. We have seen this theme before, we have experienced this cause before and while noble it unfolds predictably. I would like to have seen a little more of Roberta Guaspari's personal & inner life ... to have understood how she came to this point. I would loved Wes Craven to have plumbed one or two kids' family situations more deeply. Nevertheless, it is a moving movie and as a musician I love what it says about the power of music. I love what it says about the power of a vision, persistently pursued and I love that it says any human being can explore their talent to its peak, that talent may be squeezed from all of us however unlikely and any every child has a soul and dreams beyond any limits of their circumstances.",1478217600,3,1135,4.541463414634146

1081419,5,6305763305,"I love this Movie Music of the Heart it's an amazing true story. I played the Violin when I was a child & I had a dream. My Music Teacher saw talent in me I practiced every day. I had to give up my dream to be trained in the Philharmonic Orchestra because, of family problems. It broke my heart & soul with support I'm playing again, to heal. Meryl Streep was brilliant in this Movie. Roberta Guaspari was so, courageous believed that any child could learn to play the Violin. I admire her strength for not taking no for an answer, never giving up. Creating Opus 118 reinstated her Music Program the Professional Violinists that were in this Movie believed in the children as much as Roberta did. I purchased this Movie & I will treasure it always. It's so, inspiring & I'm grateful for Roberta. I'm also, going to purchase the Documentary.

discovered that it related to a close interest of ours, namely the Suzuki program for string
players, and music education in general.  We liked it so much that we have talked about it

1081568,5,6305763305,"I received this DVD movie a few days ago. I actually already had it on VHS tape several years ago and hardly ever played it, but, I
wanted it in a DVD format. I have seen this movie many times, including today, all day, June 17, 2014. Every time I watch it, I start
crying. To think that there actually might be human beings out there in the world who care about children learning classical music
and musical instruments is for me unbelievable. Meryl Streep is an excellent actress, one that I will always love with all my heart. I
know that I do not know her as a human being, but, she gives such powerful performances in all of her roles and Angela Bassett
is a wonderful, beautifully spirited lady, whom also gives such wonder performances. Gloria Estefan, such a beautiful woman with
caring, loving, and great musical gifts. This is a powerful movie.  I am 60 years of age and dying quickly of kidney cancer and heart disease among other things, I look back at my life and wished that I had met someone who cared enough about me and my dreams of learning classical music and instruments, but, I had attention deficient disorder as a child and my mother did not pay much attention to my teachers when they told her that I learning disorder problems. She was in a complete state of denial. To this
day it has still affected me. If I had my life to live over again, I would have loved to be an educator of music for children. My teachers would often tell my parents that Dione has a serious problem with her ability to pay attention. I never had any friends and was a day dreamer most of the time. I know that this has nothing to do with critiquing this movie, but, it truly is a beautiful movie and one that you should have in your home movie library. There is nothing more important than a child's ability to learn as possible. Thank You Lord God Jesus Christ for all of our children, may you continue to protect them, preserve their lives, and give them the necessary direction and purpose they will need to complete this life we live in inspite of adversity.

Thank you for sending this beautiful movie so expediently and packaged so beautifully. I just received it at my home a few days ago. Today is June 17, 2014. I would recommend this movie to person whom has children in their lives and the movie music
score is so beautiful, I just cry and cry and cry.

A number of times, throughout the movies; I was caught by scenes that perhaps Cher might have also been a good choice for the part.  But young Meryl gave a smart, captivating performance, that draws you in to the story, and not into her as an actress.  That makes for great entertainment.  Combine that with breathtaking music and a powerful storyline, and what a treat this movie is.

Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses and she did a terrific job as always. It is a great family film, it shows perseverance through heartbreak, and teaches what happens when family, good friends and even strangers sticks together for the common good miracles happen. this is an old movie worth purchasing so much better than the junk we see today.

Although she was strict and had that unique Italian temper, the violin was her one true love and she taught us not only to play well, but to love playing and to develop an appreciation for the beautiful music which the violin sends out when we learn to play it as she instructed us to. This movie, like Mr. Holland's Opus, is one I could watch over and over, and not get tired of it! I truly recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate the violin and who Meryl Streep portrayed in this movie; Roberta Guaspari.

Little attention is paid to important details, such as aging of the characters. While the children aged by ten or more years, the adults aged not one day. The students quickly jumped from learning the various parts of the violin's bow and how to stand properly to playing the instruments beautifully. The producer seemed intent on avoiding any scenes of hardship that Roberta surely must have faced during her teaching career.

1081851,5,6305763305,"This movie is really terrific, especially if you like true stories of people who overcome hardship and triumph in the end. If you like Meryl Streep it adds to the pleasure of it all. Streep plays a violin teacher whose husband has left her and her two young sons for one of her friends. She has no money and needs all the help she can get. Her mother played by Cloris Leachman is sympathetic and helpful to a point but wants her daughter to make a successful life for herself.

This was the first Meryl Streep movie, if not one of the first that I had ever seen.  Meryl Streep plays Roberta Guaspari(her best work since SILKWOOD)  a greek musician, who recently divorced and  moved to NYC with her two kids.  And since she doesn't have much money she needs to find a good job.  Her boyfriend, hooks her up with a principal of a private school, and although at first the principal is reluctant to hire her, she ends up a long-term substitute violin teacher at the school.  Her first group of students aren't very good, but after ten years they get better.

But THEN guess what happens?  The school board loses money and almost eliminates Roberta's job.  And during a conference at Roberta's home, they find out that the only way to save Roberta's job is for Roberta and her students to do a benefit concert.  So they book the 92nd Street Y.  And then the Y had a fire or something, so they lose their venue.  And it seems at that point that the program is really doomed.  But fortunately, one of her other friends makes arrangements for them to have the concert mounted at Carnegie Hall.

Many of the tunes that Roberta taught her students in the movie are also ones that my violin scholar cousins Emma and Jenny also learned on the violin.  This is a great movie, and one that should not be missed.",1244419200,3,1424,4.4192307692307695

1082004,5,6305763305,"One of the reviewers here, ""A Customer"", has panned this film and complains that it doesn't adequately reflect the allegedly miserable state of our urban student population. It sounds more like ""A Customer"" has NO idea what the inside of a city classroom looks like.

First of all, this is based on a true story -- it's not a fiction spun out of whole cloth by an airheaded liberal vistionary, as the sourpuss reviewer tries to suggest.

I grew up in a small, all-white town in New Hampshire, but have lived in Boston, Massachusetts, most of my adult life (I'm 56 years old). Iteach music in an inner city public pre-school in Roxbury-- the Harlem of Boston, Massachusetts. Our three-to-seven year-olds -- Black, Latino, Asian and White -- already speak and read very good, ""proper"" English, are learning to express themselves effectively in writing, and many are on the road to excellence.  Most of our three-and-four-year-old bilingual children come to us pretty much fluent in both English and Spanish -- sometimes they help translate for their parents.

Not only that: because of the fact that my principal values the arts, each one of our children has music and dance class twice a week.  In addition, all of our K2-First Grade classes have a chorus rehearsal once a week, and perform at least twice a year.  They sing four-part rounds and simple two-and-three-part harmony, have sung in English, Hebrew, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Thai, French and Haitian Kreyol.  By the time our children finish First Grade, even those who began with pitch recognition problems are singing fairly well on key, most sing very well, and we always have several who truly shine -- including a few with some of the most beautiful voices I have heard in my career as a music teacher and church musician.  Which brings me to another point:  a lot of our students come to school already singing well, because of experience from an early age singing in their home churches. Which has taught me that the ""war zone"" they're coming from -- and where I live as well -- has a lot more to offer than your cynical comments would suggest.

I have also taught music and academic subjects to all grades in an urban parochial with a 99% black population, and as with the children I teach now, I very rarely heard any ""barbaric slang"", though our children often spoke with a colorful dialect. (In the Catholic school many of the children were Haitian-American, most bilingual in English and Kreyol -- a few were trilingual, speaking French as well). I have taught older kids in both junior high and high school, and have subbed in Boston at all grade levels.  I will certainly admit that the upper grades prevented more of a challenge, but I see the problems as more of a systemic failure than any fault of the children.

In fact, at whatever level I've ever taught, I've never found more than 10% of the kids to be problem students, but I certainly agree that the failure of school administrators (and politicians) to implement effective discipline in the schools does not make our job easy.  I did quit my junior high job after seven years of frustration with the lack of administrative support for my attempts to assert discipline in my classroom, but I have to reiterate, as I said before, that the vast majority of my students were well-behaved, funny, enthusiastic, talented, and loveable.  My chorus performed gospel music, jazz, pop classics, international folk music, and selections from Handel's Messiah and an Italian opera in four-part harmony, unsimplified, originally as written. The numbers ranged from 80 to 120 singers, whom I rehearsed unassisted several days a week in our music room.

It appears to me that it's you, and not the 5-star reviewers, who ought to be ashamed for your ""cartoony"" stereotypes of city children. Fight for stricter discipline and academic standards if that's what's needed in your system -- as we all have to do.  Write your senators and representatives and tell them that the money spend in George Bush's trillion dollar war against Iraq would better spent in upgrading all of schools -- not just those in the city -- and a few more incidentals like our deteriorating bridge, levees, and woefully inadequate health care system.  But if you really don't like the children you teach as much as your hateful and pessimistic words seem to indicate, maybe you should look for another job.

As for the film:  I've seen it a couple of times on cable TV, and I came to Amazon to buy it so I can use it for enrichment at the music school I'm opening in my home so I continue developing my talented student musicians, beyond their work in the classroom, throughout their rest of their public school careers. I love the movie -- it's inspirational and moving.  Is it coated with a little gloss? Most likely, as are most films from Hollywood.  But the cast, the acting, the screenplay, and the music are great, and I pity the person who can only find things to tear down.  Fortunately, that doesn't characterize the vast majority of these reviews.",1203638400,,5051,4.774971297359357

I found all the kids and actors who contributed to this film very special. Each and every one of them was able to give you the feel of hope. The music was very inspirational and it could make you cry at times.

Another thing I want to point out is about Roberta's family. Even if she and her husband got separated because he cheated on her, her sons were still very supportive and helped her all through joy and sorrow. It made me feel very touched to see both her sons helped her out in the concert. It's very rare to have a family like that - let me tell you.

Overall, I loved the music and acting. It was very inspirational and touching. You must watch it!

It is sentimental to be sure, but also an inspiration and a reminder not to give up on kids. Once exposed to the arts and finding a sense of accomplishment in their success, children will carry this over into other areas of life as well. It is a message that is at once good, and true. It is brought nicely to the forefront in this very underrated Wes Craven film that boasts a terrific cast and an uplifting story of hope.

Meryl Streep is Roberta Guaspari, given a chance to teach violin to some kids in East Harlem, New York, by principal Janet Williams (Angela Bassett). Roberta is a single mother with two boys of her own. She initially has to provide the instruments for the children herself. Though some of the parents can't see how playing the violin will be of any use to their children, she pushes forward with a little encouragement from teachers like Isabel Vasquez (Gloria Estefan) and the response of her students.

She is demanding of her pupils, which rubs both them and their parents the wrong way at first. But as time goes on and she adjusts to them and they begin to know her, the program takes on a life of its own, giving the kids a sense of accomplishment and the ability to dream of something better in their lives. As the years pass the program becomes well known and is a shining point to a school system that is not always equipped to deal with the number of children as compared to the number of good teachers.

Roberta's boyfriend Brian (Aidan Quinn) can not see Roberta's true worth and she finally lets the relationship drop and concentrates on her kids. Her own boys have difficulty with their father's leaving, followed by Brian, but finally grow up enough to want happiness for their mother; they even try to set her up with someone. This is not a one-note movie or a one-note performance as some would have you believe, but a fine and well rounded film full of love and hope.

When school funding threatens to close the program, Roberta is aided by many famous musicians to raise the money needed with a performance at Carnegie Hall, playing with Isaac Stern and others. Streep has a luminous and heartrending turn in this sincere film. Cloris Leachman has a nice role also as Claire's not so perfect mother.

This film shows what can be accomplished if we make the effort to teach children the arts. It is just as important as academics, as this warm and caring film based on the real life of Roberta Guaspari shows. It is a movie worth owning and watching with your own kids.",1125100800,20,2610,4.521186440677966
1082118,5,6305763305,"MUSIC OF THE HEART, the story of violin teacher Roberta Guaspari and her fight to save a music program in East Harlem's school system, is based loosely on the 1996 documentary SMALL WONDERS. Ms. Guaspari believed, as did her principal Janet Williams, that studying music and art, in this instance the violin, teaches children discipline and provides them with a sense of self-worth and that the arts should not be treated as frills but rather an integral part of a child's edcuation.

Meryl Streep, nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Ms. Guaspari, is as always magnificent. She favors the instructor a little; but more importantly, she takes on her walk and speech patterns so as to actually become her. While Cloris Leachman, Angela Bassett and Aidan Quinn give respectable performances, the movie belongs to Ms. Streep.

The film adds new material not seen in the documentary; some of it works better than others. The relationship between Quinn and Streep-- she and her two young sons have been deserted by her husband-- could have been left out entirely without much having been lost. On the other hand, the death of a student from a drive-by shooting and the child who has to leave Streep's class and move away because her father is abusing her mother, while fictional-- at least they are not in the documentary-- add touches of necessary realism and keep the movie from becoming one-sided.

The highlight of both this movie and the documentary [included in the DVD version and is not to be missed] is the concert at Carnegie Hall by the students, along with some of the great violinists of the world, to raise money to keep the violin classes continuing. Apparently the concert was the brainchild of Arnold Steinhardt of the Guarneri String quartet and his wife who came to Guaspari's aid in her fight to save the violin program.

Ms Guaspari's vision, refreshing and heart-warming, is simple through profound: teachers make a difference, discipline is essential to learning, music is an integral part of education, all children can learn to play the violin, one should play from the heart. We could use more movies like this one, particularly in times like these when movie houses show documentaries entitled ENRON and THE FOG OF WAR while the casualties from the War in Iraq daily continue to rise and no weapons of mass destruction are found.

Parts of this movie will make you sing.",1117324800,8,2400,4.858190709046455
1082119,5,6305763305,"Director Wes Craven told the studio he would direct SCREAM 3 only if he could direct MUSIC OF THE HEART.  There's no Freddy Kruegers or screaming teens this time; and if Craven's direction is standard and to the point, it fits the mood of this uplifting salute to a caring and determined teacher.  As Roberta, Meryl Streep garnered one of her fourteen Oscar nominations, and as always, Streep is brilliant.  Instead of placing a halo around her head, Streep shows us a woman who is not always likeable.  She's hard on her pupils, but ironically, that's what they come to love and admire in her.  She's not had a great personal life and yes, sometimes she's a little rough on her two boys.  Roberta's quick-tempered, impulsive, but dedicated and compassionate.  It's to Streep's credit that her performance transcends the obvious; and to show her dedication to her craft, she learned to play the violin to boot.  And it was refreshing to see children so enraptured and gain considerable self-esteem as they learned their craft; the final concert in Carnegie Hall is appropriately schmaltzy but wonderful in its heartfelt conviction.  Perhaps focusing on Roberta's desire for commitment from lover Aidan Quinn was distracting, but it showed us the fragile side of her character as well.  The supporting cast is very good, too..Angela Bassett's regal stance as the school's principal; Jay O. Sanders strength and admiration, and the children are very good too.  Gloria Estefan is given very little to do, but she does a nice job with NSYNC on the Oscar-nominated title song.

What makes MUSIC OF THE HEART such a good film is its heart.  Seeing Streep take these underprivileged kids and make them proud of their achievements is uplifting, and showing how the parents likewise supported their children (even those who initially found it hard to do) gives this reviewer hope and faith that there is hope for children in this increasingly demanding world.  It proves that sports heroes aren't the only ones out there.",1116201600,,2012,4.949404761904762

1082121,5,6305763305,"This movie is NOT about a classroom or about proper English or about teaching methods. It's about taking the passion of something you love and being successful with it enough to make others love it just as much. It's about creating culture in an area of society that had none.

My mother taught piano, organ, and violin. In the 1920's she had her own girl's orchestra in the Chicago area. She always kept the attitude of ""I'm here if you want to learn, but I'm not going to push you."" Boy, do I wish she had! I cannot play any instrument and regret her NOT making me take lessons when I had the opportunity. But she's been deceased for over 30 years and when I watch someone play with proficiency I kick myself.

The children of Harlem were given an Opportunity (with a capital 'O') and I applaud the writers, producers, and directors who brought this to our attention with an excellent film.

I laughed and I cried. I hope you will, too. To all who read this, if you like music and inspiration, I recommend seeing this movie. And, I hope you see the depth of the true message and not the trivial details others have complained about.

It didn't matter to me if the school classroom was not portrayed as it really may be in Harlem. It didn't matter to me if Roberta was strict or made her children practice (if it's a true story, then so be it).

The movie moved me. I felt the pride of the parents whose children excelled in this TRUE story of accomplishment.

Meryl Streep plays Roberta Guispari whose husband leaves her for a younger woman .Needing a job she tries to persuade Janet Williams ( Angela Bassett) the principal of an East Harlem school,to take her on a violin teacher in a special programme and eventually succeeds thanks to an impromptu recital by her two young sons .( It would not have altered my decision -but then we would not have had a movie )

She faces resistance ,both from the pupils and one parent in particular ,who loudly avers that she is a meddling white liberal ,that dead white man's music is not relevant and that no black classical composers have ever existed .( The ranting ignoramus has clearly never heard of Samuel Coleridge Taylor whose oratorio The Song of Hiawatha is still a staple of choral societies in the UK .)

The movie unfolds ,in somewaht episodic fashion ,treating of Roberta's personal and professional life; the success of the programme and its threat of being terminated by funders  concluding in a Carnegie Hall fundraising concert)

Its sentimental without being overly schmalty but does tend to make all the students too glossy --well groomed ,speaking excellent English and with supportive parents .Such do exist but are by no means in the kind of majority we  see in the movie .It is unrealistic and this undercuts the very real achievement of the actual Ms Guispari in driving the programme over so many years .

1082146,3,6305763305,"MUSIC OF THE HEART is based on a true story of a woman named Roberta who wanted to teach violin to students, who believed that with the right discipline any child could play violin. The movie stars Meryl Streep who has been excellent in just about anything she's ever done in her career, this movie being no exception. The story follows Roberta, a single mother of two, looking for work and finding work as a substitute in a school in the East Harlem of New York. She has 50 violins and her class starts out small, and fast forward to 10 years later, where her class size has tripled. Roberta finds out that her class is being cut from the budget and will cease to exist. Enlisting the help of friends and family, they organize a benefit concert which eventually ends up taking place at Carnegie Hall, where they raise enough money for her program to continue.
The movie is a nice adaptation of the true story, however it falls flat in many areas. I felt there wasn't nearly enough character development, for any character for that matter. Roberta's goals and hard work are clearly inspirational but watching the movie you don't get that sense of inspiration that this type of movie should make the viewer connect towards. As well I felt the plot moved rather quickly, one moment the students were amateurs, then halfway through the term they are playing like rank professionals? Ok sure. Or how about her new students playing Carnegie Hall with seasoned professionals, and being basically presented as just as good as the professionals. I realize we're led to think there was a lot of practicing but it still doesn't ring true, they are children and not everyone is going to perform the same or do as well.
Regardless, it was a movie worth seeing for Streep's performance, another shining performance. Well worth the time, just ultimately a tad disappointing in terms of writing and character development.",1056499200,4,1906,4.743975903614458
1082147,3,6305763305,"This was a good movie.  However, it was more of a movie than a biographical account.  The bulk of the film seemed to focus on the ""fiddle fest"" concert at the end, but it realy didn't focus a great deal on the amount of work needed in the early stages of the program to make it work.  A white woman doesn't just walk into a school in East Harlem and start a violin program.  There is very little focus on the work needed to win the students over to the idea or even how they were taught.  One second she's showing them how to stand, the next it is half way through the term and they are playing songs.  What happened in between?!?
As a musician myself, I greatly disliked Roberta's teaching styles.  If that whole ""tough love"" approach was indeed how she teaches (""that's terrible"" etc.) then I have considerably less respect for her.  It works for some students, but not all.  She was quite the overbearing mother forcing her kids to practice.  I don't like watching kids forced into playing music-it ought to begin out of joy for the instrument, not because mom thinks that you must play violin.  Even her own sons quit violin-part of a teacher's job should be to instill a love of the instrument in the student, not force them away from it.

1082154,2,6305763305,"Meryl Streep got her twelfth Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Roberta Guaspari in Places in the Heart. Her performance is excellent [when has she been anything but?], yet it is not enough to bring the movie completely to life. This true story, which has been filmed before as a documentary called Small Wonders, is about a teacher who created a music program in the schools of the impoverished East Harlem area of New York. A single mother of two boys, Guaspari, who was trained as a classical violinist but who had little teaching experience, was given a job as a teacher in the 1980s by Janet Williams, a principal at one of the schools. There was no real budget for a classical music program, so she was hired as a substitute. Guaspari herself supplied the first violins. Ten years later, she had taught 1,400 youngsters. When the program was in danger of being axed due to a school budget crisis, Guaspari enlisted the aid of some friends, who arranged for her to give a benefit concert with her best students at Carnegie Hall. Famous violinist like Isaac Stern participated, and the Program was saved. In 1999, money was found by the city to assure its continuation.
I don't know who was responsible for Music of the Heart's rather uninspired telling of the story. It certainly wasn't Ms. Streep. It may have been director Wes Craven, who until now has made his mark in the horror genre, with creepy teen fare such as Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream trilogy. His choice to make a straight drama raised a few eyebrows, and perhaps he was overly cautious with the material. Some of the problem lies within the screenplay. Writer Pamela Gray concentrates on the main character almost exclusively. Ms. Streep is in nearly every scene. Except for some fairly good interaction between Roberta and her boys, most of the characters float in and out, acting almost as stage props. There is little that is memorable about them, and, as a result, we wind up not understanding Roberta Guaspari very well. We see what she does, and we understand that her work is noteworthy and inspirational. Yet the picture does not fill us with inspiration. It's not that it's a bad move, it's that it never soars, as movies about noble, dedicated people can when well done. While it is not a given, what usually provides the drama for such true tales is understanding what personal sacrifices an individual must make to fulfill a difficult goal. I feel certain that this happened to Ms. Guaspari in real life, but we see almost none of it in this movie. It is strongly hinted at a couple of times, but then the film simply glosses everything over and moves on the something else.
Music of the Heart is certainly worth watching for Ms. Streep's performance. The story is a fascinating one, but much of what makes a good story is the way in which it is told. Music of the Heart is not that much of a story teller.",1016496000,12,2902,4.615087040618955

In this fabulous, true-story, Wes Craven film, Meryl Streep plays a strong young woman named Roberta Gausperi. In the beginning of the film, Roberta is stressing over the loss of her husband - who (before the film begins) had left her and her two young children for another woman they met while living in Greece (her husband worked in the Navy and they were always moving around the Globe). Roberta takes her children (Nick and Lexi) to live at her mother's house. Roberta's mother soon urges her daughter to get a job so she can move into her own house with her kids. Soon, Roberta comes along with an old former high school classmate, Brian (Adian Quinn), and they end up falling in love. Since Roberta loves music and plays the violin (she even taught her two children to play the violin), Brian suggested to Roberta that she go to tough East Herlem in New York where there was a young principal at an elementary school Janet Williams (Angela Bassett), looking for substitute teachers. So Roberta takes Lexi and Nick and move to East Herlem, hoping that Roberta will get the job. When Roberta meets with Janet and tells her that she wants to be their music teacher, Janet first is hesitant to give Roberta the job because she doesn't think the school board will allow any music classes (mostly because of money issues). So Roberta finally proves to Janet - by bringing in her two sons to play the violin with them - that she can handle the music class and Janet just can't resist. Roberta soon gets her classes together and soon realizes that the job of being a violin teacher isn't easy! All of the children in her classes end up having their own problems, and things in Roberta's life become more emotional while working with them. Then, 10 years later, Roberta is still a music teacher at the school - but Janet ends up firing Roberta because the school board wants to withdrawl all music programs! Furious, Roberta schemes to come up with a way to get her music program back so she can continue having a job. With all the parents from her new classes help, Janet's, and a kindergarten teacher Roberta met and became friends with, Isabel Vasquez (Gloria Estefan), they find a way to beat out all the odds and Roberta becomes a true heroine!

The viewers were shown Meryl's character's struggle to find ends meet, bringing up 2 childen independently and giving her children reality check that their dad is not coming back anymore, overcoming xenophobia and helping the blacks in their neighbourhood to overcome their inferiority complex and channeling their anger and frustration towards something more meaningful that would change the course of their lives.  In this instance, that would mean being a violinist.  In other words, social and family issues are discussed here.  Perhaps, the pace of the movie could be quickened and that casts such as Aidan Quinn and Gloria Estefan could be given more protracted roles.

1082222,5,6305763305,"Wes Craven, director of the Scream trilogy, shifts gear and releases ""Music of My Heart"" based on a true life story of a violin  teacher in New York City.  The incessant ovation of this movie has proved  that shift of genre can be successful.
Roberta, mother of two boys, moved  to New York City after her husband had left her for another woman who  happened to a good friend of hers.  Through connection of a friend, Roberta  secured an interview with the principal of an elementary school in Harlem.  Roberta was later offered a position as a substitute music teacher.
Due  to meager supplies and budget, Roberta offered her own violins for students  to practice.  With much difficulty and challenge, Roberta founded a violin  program for elementary school kids within the neighborhood.  Roberta was  met with immediate challenge like student discipline, low self-esteem, and  opposition from parents.  On one occasion, one of the kids' mother refused  her son to take violin lesson because playing violin is considered a  Whiteman's practice.  Roberta's love for the kid has, however, won his  mother over.
After almost 10 years as a non-contract substitute teacher,  the school faced substantial oppression from the district about dismissing  Robert due to budget.  The community joined together, along with Roberta's  two grown-up sons and prominent musicians to raise money to preserve the  program.
""Music of My Heart"" is a movie about love and  perseverance.  Meryl Streep plays a non-showy music teacher; yet through  her persistance and self-denial, many students' lives are changed.  A true  inspiration.",967766400,63,1615,5.1953125

1082225,4,6305763305,"I must confess that I approached `Music of the Heart' with a great deal of  fear and trepidation. I really had no desire to subject myself to what I  envisioned to be a 124-minute barrage of inspirational life messages and  feel-good sentimentality. What a pleasant surprise then to discover this to  be a genuinely moving and heartwarming true-life tale of an extraordinary  teacher, Roberta Gaspari, and her equally extraordinary students.
In  plot, `Music of the Heart' doesn't deviate much from the standard formula  common to such films. We have, first, the neophyte white middle class  schoolteacher, plunged into the heart of a problem-ridden inner city Harlem  school, filled with burnt-out teachers who have learned to expect little  (and thereby garner little) from the youngsters placed in their charge and  children themselves whose troubled home lives provide little in the way of  a nurturing environment for academic achievement. We encounter the  predictable first-day stumbles of this headstrong, idealistic newcomer as  the students challenge her authority and the relevance of her violin class  in no uncertain terms; we see how, through discipline and the sheer force  of her own determination, she eventually connects them to the music they  are learning to play, building their self-confidence and slowly winning the  respect of their often skeptical, and, occasionally, downright hostile  parents in the process. Then comes the great challenge, as the school  board, after ten successful years in which the program has earned a sizable  reputation and even been featured in magazine articles, pulls the plug on  the funding. Thanks to the sheer determination of Gaspari, the parents  whose children's lives have been forever altered, a magazine writer and the  voluntary participation of a number of the world's premiere violinists (a  large number of whom appear as themselves in the film), the group stages an  amazing fundraising concert at Carnegie Hall, the proceeds from which save  the program and help ensure its survival for the next several years.
One  of the chief reasons that `Music of the Heart' does not dissolve (as it so  easily might have) into a puddle of goopy tears lies in the matter-of-fact  interpretation of the main character that both writer, Pamela Gray, and  actress, Meryl Streep, bring to bear on the role. At no time is Roberta  ever portrayed as a saintly figure. In fact, she is a woman filled with all  sorts of insecurities and vulnerabilities, exacerbated by the devastating  sense of bewilderment and loss caused by the unexpected termination of her  marriage and her seeming need to be dependent on a man for comfort, support  and a sense of purpose. She is often overbearing, pushy and pigheaded and  not just in the classroom where it counts, but also in her personal life  where it often alienates her from the ones she loves most. Yet, somehow out  of this mass of self-doubts and personal missteps, she finds the inner  strength and emotional wherewithal to work miracles. Streep throws herself  so completely into the role that we cannot take our eyes off her for a  single one of the film's 120 enthralling minutes (and I doubt that she is  ever off screen for more than a few seconds in the entire film). It is a  truly glowing performance.
Equally impressive, director Wes Craven is to  be highly commended for drawing such an impressive array of credible,  down-to-earth performances from a large cast of outstanding preteen actors.  Thanks to them and an air of naturalism in the dialogue, the scenes between  the youngsters and their teacher always ring true and believable.
I defy  anyone - even the most tone deaf, musically disinterested member of the  audience - not to be deeply touched by the final scenes of this film.  Craven, from all his years doing those slasher films I suppose, really  knows how to generate a sense of suspense as we follow the pre-show  behind-the-scenes preparations of the nail-biting participants. The  recreated concert itself, with a number of the real life participants  brought back to play for the occasion, is utterly engrossing and leaves the  audience both rheumy-eyed and covered with goose bumps. Well, maybe  ""Music of the Heart"" is, after all, filled with the  `inspirational life messages' and `feel-good sentimentality' I so dreaded  at the outset of the film. That being the case, I guess that isn't such a  bad thing after all!",965001600,,4451,5.066298342541437

When friend/lover Brian Sinclair (Aidan Quinn) sends  Roberta to Harlem, New York, to become a violin teacher, Roberta gets more  than she expected.  The rest of the cast, Oscar award nominee Angela  Bassett as Janet, the school principle, and Grammy Award Winning singer,  and making her motion picture debut, Gloria Estefan, as Isabel Vasquez,  (who should have debuted as Eva Peron in ""Evita"") give superb  performances that are believable and real.  Cloris Leachman, Jane Leeves  Jay O. Sanders' performances were essential and very effective to the  story.  Director Wes Craven, who is best known for the ""Scream""  trilogy, proves that switching genres is, in fact, POSSIBLE.

""Music of the Heart,"" directed by Wes Craven, is the story of one  of these heroes, Roberta Guaspari, played here by the incomparable Meryl  Streep.  Faced with a divorce and raising two sons on her own, Roberta,  with the help of a friend, writer Brian Sinclair (Aidan Quinn), finds a job  in an East Harlem school teaching violin.  Hired initially as a substitute  for two days a week, she struggles to make her program work, competing with  a tenured music teacher and less than cooperative students.  A violin  program seems out of place in Harlem, and there are some very real racial  barriers she must overcome, as well.  That she succeeds at all is due to  nothing less than strong-willed determination and tenacity; a former Navy  wife who was constantly on the move, she buys her first home, a fixer-upper  in Harlem she must renovate to make livable, acting as her own contractor,  which adds even more stress to an already overwhelming situation:  A single  mom living in Harlem, trying to make a life for herself and her boys, while  giving selflessly to her students, many of whom soon look to her as their  ray of hope in an otherwise seemingly futile environment.  There is triumph  and tragedy to her story, but the fact that she was able to help so many  young people, and raise the self-esteem of so many individuals as well as  that of an entire community, illustrates the difference one person can  truly make in our society.  Streep delivers an Oscar-worthy performance  (she was nominated), and as usual, disappears completely into her  character.  Indisputably the greatest actress of our times, it never ceases  to amaze the way she can take any role and not just play, but become, that  person; she is truly a chameleon at her craft, and a joy to watch.  After  watching her, you feel as if you really know Roberta; and the fact that she  enables you empathize with her so readily heightens the already emotional  impact of her story.  It is a touching portrayal that avoids any  sentimentality or pretentiousness.  The supporting cast includes  Cloris Leachman (Assunta Guaspari), Angela Bassett (Janet Williams), Jay O.  Sanders (Dan), Michael Angarano (Nick, age 7), and features cameos by Isaac  Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Sandra Park and Karen Briggs, among others.  Craven  has ably delivered a solid and moving film; he keeps everything to scale,  keeps it real, never allowing the story to become larger-than-life, one of  the pitfalls of many a movie biography, which can so easily diminish the  quality of the final product.  Happily, he never allows that to come close  to happening in ""Music of the Heart.""  This is an unforgettable film, with  a memorable performance by Meryl Streep; but in the end, what you'll really  remember is Roberta Guaspari.

1082254,5,6305763305,"This is a powerful, moving and triumphant true story, which springs from a documentary about a music teacher and her students.  This is the story of Roberta Guaspari-Tzavaras (Meryl Streep), a violin teacher who  single-handedly created a program to teach violin to inner city kids in  East Harlem, New York.  The film follows her from the dubious inception of  the program, which started as a substitute teaching job, through the  ensuing 10 years where so many children wanted to be in the program that it  had spread to three schools in the district and a lottery had to be held  each year to limit the number of students.  The last part of the film is  devoted to her fight to continue the program after the board of education  killed its funding.  It culminates in a triumphant benefit concert  supported by some of the greatest violinists in the world to raise private  funds to save the program.
This film celebrates the dogged determination  and courage of one woman who proved that a single individual can make a  difference.  Her life was not a pretty picture.  Her husband left her for  one of her friends, turning her into an emotional basket case.  Music was  her only solace and teaching was her gift.  Unfortunately, her lack of  experience in the education system made her unqualified to get a position.  So on the recommendation of a friend she convinces an East Harlem principal  to give her a chance as a substitute violin teacher.  She even supplies the  violins.
The story from there is an example of life often being more  remarkable than fiction.  The results she achieved with these children were  astounding.  My only criticism of the story was that it contained a little  too much treatment of her personal life.  Almost her entire relationship  with Brian (Aiden Quinn) could have been eliminated without hurting the  story.  I know that director Wes Craven was trying to give us some  character development on how tough her life was and how difficult a person  she was, but it was superfluous and the digression only bogged the story  down.  The real story here was about her and the kids.  He should have  stuck to that.  Otherwise, Craven did a fabulous job of directing,  delivering an emotional story with great power and effect.  I was quite  impressed, especially given the fact that prior to this film, he was almost  exclusively a one genre director (Horror.  Think `Scream').
The acting  by Meryl Streep was nothing short of brilliant.  I have read criticism of  Streep's performance as too harsh, it seeming as if she didn't really LIKE  the children.  In actuality her performance was dead solid perfect.  I was  lucky enough to rent the Collector's Series DVD of this film which included  a separate disk of the original documentary about the real Roberta  Guaspari-Tzavaras and her students, including the actual concert at  Carnegie Hall.  If you watch that documentary you will be in awe of how  well Streep utterly nails her character.  We get to see the real Roberta  teaching her students and she is like a drill sergeant barking orders,  throwing kids out of practice for not having their violins, reproaching  them angrily about plucking their strings while she is speaking, and  generally tolerating no nonsense.  She is impatient with them and  completely intolerant of anything but their best.
The children who made  comments about the real Roberta said things like, `I wouldn't have the  discipline I have if it weren't for Roberta.  That discipline not only  helps me with the violin, but with everything else.'  Another child said,  `I have to pay attention to what I'm doing or Roberta will get mean.  But  if I do good, she is pleased and that make me feel good.'  Yet another, `I  want to work really hard so Roberta will be proud of me.'  Clearly, these  are not the comments of children who were being negatively affected by  Roberta's no nonsense style.
Streep said in the featurette included in  the DVD that it is very difficult playing a real person because there is no  leeway for artistic interpretation.  Translation:  If she was to play  Roberta Guaspari-Tzavaras, she had to become Roberta.  This she  accomplished with stunning accuracy.  Streep captures not only Roberta's  irascible demeanor, but the essence of her drive and passion for drawing  the students very best.  Roberta is a complex and difficult character to  play and Streep throws herself into the role, delivering a tour de force  performance that very few actors have the range and depth to  accomplish.
This film is a must see for anyone who loves the arts and  anyone who can appreciate a great actress giving a career performance.  I  rated it a 9/10, subtracting a point for Craven's unnecessary digression  into Roberta's private life.  That is, however, hardly a reason to miss  this bravura performance and an inspiring story.",957052800,4,4869,4.852760736196319

1082257,5,6305763305,"""Music of the Heart"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie has it all: comedy, drama, romance, trauma, surprises....and this movie was also very inspiring. This movie (based on a true story) was about a young woman named Roberta Guaspari and she played the violin. After  her husband left her and her two kids for another woman, Roberta taught her  children how to play the violin and other instruments. They moved to New  York City (I think) and she wanted to teach other children how to play the  violin so they could actually feel like they could do something right. So,  she decided to go to an elementary school and ask if she could be the  childrens' violin teacher. The principal of the school at first, didn't  want her to teach at her school. And the movie is basically about how  Roberta ends up getting the job as a violin teacher and teaching the  children (who were very difficult, of course) to play the violin and  respect themselves and others. Meryl Streep was so excellent in this movie  (the entire cast was) but the only thing I wished was for Gloria Estefan to  have a bigger part. She only had like, one or two lines. I mean, she  appeared in a lot of the movie, but she didn't really have any lines. Other  than that, I think this was the one of the best movies I've ever seen (like  I said before) and can't wait to get it on video!

7895780,2,6305763305,"Were the lead part played by anyone other than Meryl Streep this snoozer of a ""chick flick"" wouldn't squeeze more than a single star from me.  The film's script is clueless about music, about teaching, about teaching to inner city kids, about the unique challenges of teaching music.  But the real problem is the writing, which is formulaic, unimaginative, and as predictable and corny as a piece of fluff like ""Patch Adams."" Last but not least, the budget for this powder-puff trip through a couple of classrooms in a NYC high school was a shameful $27 million! (With that kind of a budget, my mind reels at what I might have accomplished as a teacher of literature and music, occasionally with ""inner-city kids"").

The film defies credulity by depicting a protagonist-teacher (Streep) who ""happens to have"" 50 extra violins that she's picked up ""on the cheap"" and is willing to use in the class.  (My sister was a successful Suzuki teacher who had to fight for every down-sized violin available for her 1st and 2nd grade students.)  Next, Streep's character becomes impatient upon noticing that her students aren't all on board with her plans to make them respectable music-makers. As early as the first day of class, she ""fires"" an apathetic kid, telling him to go to the principal's office.  (Most music teachers don't have that luxury.)  Next, she encounters a student who is not standing straight and, upon discovering that she is wearing a brace, has her sit while all of the other students are standing.  (One wonders how great the little girl's accomplishment and morale boost was when she first stood with her classmates.)  Then, a mother tells Streep that she doesn't want her kid to play ""dead white man's music.""  Streep doesn't defend the music--only points out that Arthur Ashe played the white man's game of tennis.  Later, the mother relents (no reason given), and Streep allows her boy to rejoin the class, even offering free private lessons to help him catch up (big of her).

Streep plays her role straight up with no apparent revisions of the sappy, unimaginative dialog (my sister had to become a child herself, adopting her students' speech and behavioral patterns to win them over before she could assume the role of a traditional teacher).  Streep's character doesn't even know enough to concede that not all violin music is ""legit music"" played by ""dead white men.""  In fact, there's a long tradition of jazz violin, including black musicians like Ray Nance, who was given Duke Ellington's main theme (""Come Sunday"") in his first extended concert work: ""Black, Brown and Beige"" (described by Duke as a ""tone poem parallel to the history of the experience of the African-American in America"").

Streep's character is in the finishing stages of a divorce, which proves only a minor inconvenience since she has a supportive boy-friend (though his adolescent resistance to marriage makes him another ""project"" for Streep, much like her students). Since her two sons by her first marriage appear capable not only of playing the violin but of doing so with gusto and a smile, we have little doubt about her eventual success.

As for that budget, it certainly testifies to Streep's charge for showing up (can't blame her for demanding her share for doing a script as uninspired and banal as this one).  But no doubt it also was needed to attract some of the ""real life"" super-stars of classic music, including Itzhak Perlman and Isaak Stern.  The movie could have saved a ton of money by going to some of the major black players of the African-American art form called ""jazz.""  Clearly, the world of black music--every bit as ""legitimate"" as the music of all of the ""dead white guys""--is foreign to Streep's character.  For a starter, how about the virtuoso violin playing of jazz headliner Regina Carter (who was a publicized jazz diva at the time of the movie's release)?  Or was Streep's character too proud to learn about the violin music of living black people?",1521417600,,3985,4.882789317507418

7895785,5,6305763305,"I'm a 33 year old black male who played the viola (a slightly larger violin) in high school and I loved this movie. Whenever blacks are portrayed in the media, 95% of the time it's negative. Fortunately, this movie breaks the mold. It showed black kids who grew up in the ghetto defy the odds, with the help of Roberta, and succeed in life. There was one stereotypical single mom who initially had disdain for Roberta, but she eventually became her biggest supporter. This movie does have a tragic scene (that's described, but not shown), but it's the unfortunate reality of growing up in a rough neighborhood.

Some people may say that movies like this are cliche, but I loved it. My only qualm is that I didn't quite understand why a middle class white woman would move to Harlem out of the blue (""My husband left me, I'm upset, there's a job in Harlem, I'm going to move there...""). Nevertheless, I definitely recommend this movie.

The fact that Meryl Street is a Trump-hater is an added bonus",1516492800,,997,4.595505617977528
