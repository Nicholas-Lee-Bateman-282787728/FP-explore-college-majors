3867905,5,B0027P94CQ,"This film has just come out in the UK. For once, we (in the UK) got this film released here first. Its usually the other way round!  Absolutely loved this film from beginning to end. It captures the essence of that era perfectly, and it is a film I could watch again and again. The whole cast's acting was superb throughout. My biggest surprise came from Rhys Ifans who portrayed the sex god DJ Gavin fantastically. What a sexy voice for the radio - shame I can't mention one DJ on air at the moment who sounds the same...!

Unfortunately, I myself, was born in 1979, so wasn't around in that decade. However I took my mum to see this film as she was 21yrs old in 1966. She remembers listening to the pirate radio station in the middle of the North Sea, and remembers all the political controversy surrounding it. She thought it was a great film too.

If you appreciate the best music of all time, proper rock n roll from the 60's/70's, then you will love this film. It's a real feel good movie that you will appreciate if you ever wished you had lived through that era, or you were lucky enough to experience it first hand.",1239062400,69,1124,4.317535545023697

3867938,2,B0027P94CQ,"This particular version is missing what, in my opinion, is the 2 best scenes in this film: the stay party scene where they pub crawl and the scene where Simon lip syncs to ""Stay With Me Baby"".

I have recommended this to everyone I know that has the same taste in music and has a keen sense of humor.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance is fantastic and my favorite look at him in addition to ""Harry's War"" .  What a cast of characters this movie boasts!  Sometimes, I just put on this movie while I am running around the house and listen to it because I know it so well.  This obviously admits that I have seen it more times than I can count and have not tired of it at all.  If you haven't seen it, you are really missing out.",1483574400,,668,4.131782945736434

Very funny but also surprisingly moving. Maybe worth 5 stars if it wasn't for some odd album cover choices at the end. Since when are eminem and Taylor Swift considered rock and roll? Taylor at least plays guitar, but she's technically country or pop. And eminem? He definitely isn't rock. I wouldn't even call what he does music! Other than that, a pretty great film! Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays an excellent role!",1464825600,,592,4.542056074766355

believe that this film captures the ""feel"" of the period.  It does not.  It employs the soundtrack of the 60s shamelessly as a substitute
for any essence in the script.  There is no script.  Not really.  The characters do not talk as human beings talk or feel as human beings feel.  They are caricatures.  I don't know which version I saw, but it was long and boring and I admit I fast forwarded through some of it.  Even Hoffman could not save this sinking ship.  You want a good film about the sixties?

Yeah it has its flaws (some of the music is not in correct musical chronology, and there is some fudging of certain facts) but this is art baby, not journalism. To see on the screen one of Philip Seymour Hoffman's most earnest yet funny roles, Bill Nighy  being a stoned fox (as we boomers used to say) and Emma Thompson as, well, hmmm sort of a mash-up of the dames of Absolutely Fabulous with Princess Margaret makes this worth whatever it costs to purchase or rent this.

3868202,5,B0027P94CQ,"Please be aware, the review that follows is for the Brit blu-ray version of this film. For some reason Amazon posted it with the vastly inferior US version, explained below. Trust me, find the mutiple-zone version of the UK blu ray release:

Original review: This is the full uncut version of the movie that was released as ""Pirate Radio"" in the United States. The U.S. version was horrid, had most of the good scenes cut out (for length, I guess) and was an inferior film. This blu ray film, in its full length state, is wonderful. The movie tells the very real story (in fictionalized form, of course) of how off-shore radio stations in the U.K. in the early 1960s introduced Europe to rock 'n roll. It's amazing, but much of the music of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and other groups of the early rock days (in terms of the Brit Invasion, at least) were not given much airplay on the BBC because the stations (and advertisers) didn't feel it was appropriate. Most music fans got their first dose of great R&R from the off-shore pirate stations.

This is a great movie, very fun, with a brilliant soundtrack. The film is a bit too long in some ways, but better than the U.S. version by far. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (RIP) has a great role.",1429488000,8,1246,4.508849557522124

Well time seems to have forgotten this films story, which came as a complete (and pleasant) surprise. I love Philip Seymour Hoffman - is one of the great character actors of today and his role here is akin to his role as Lester Bangs in Almost Famous. Rhys Ifans and Bill Nighy should find their equivalent to the Coen Brothers in Britain because they are a riot in a quirky and understated way. The film had great one-liners, but became confusing and hard to follow near the end. Also, I did not care for the nearly 2 hour investment.

Probably because of the great music played throughout, but also because the actors so playfully represented the 60s spirit. It was a good script, nicely acted, good sense of camaraderie, great music, playful spirit, and don't forget to watch the deleted scenes which give the viewer more time with these great characters.",1420761600,,494,4.963855421686747

3868266,2,B0027P94CQ,"Mediocre teen male sex-comedy with a great soundtrack failing to disguise so much wasted plot potential. My mother was a teen in the UK during this era, and I thought it might be a good Christmas gift. Really glad I streamed it first. She's no prude, but even all the starpower in the world (Emma Thompson, slumming it; Philip Seymour Hoffman, phoning it in; January Jones, playing Betty Draper's vapid little sister) combined with a heaping suspension of disbelief (EVERYONE DANCE TO THE RADIO ON THE BEACH!!) could cover up the faked nostalgia and lingering Britstereotypes here.

Plus, and I'm unsure how to phrase this so it passes Amazon review: there's a disturbing scene where two men try to switch out who gets it on with a ""bird"" in the pitch dark. The way it's played by Nick Frost (of whom I'm otherwise fond) and Tom Sturridge, it's supposed to be amusing. I kept thinking they would switch it up and redeem the scene, but no, it actually went there. Date assault lolz!! I can only be glad we've moved beyond these dark ages....haven't we?

I wish someone would submerge this version and completely rewrite it. Quite disappointing.",1415577600,,1143,4.767676767676767

It's based on the true story of when Britain banned Rock music on the radio. The only way around it was to broadcast from a boat.  Some of it is just laugh out loud funny.

Great music and a fun look at the inside of the pirate radio stations ships that once rocked England. The story line is great as is the acting.

3868333,4,B0027P94CQ,its for the music. a coming of age sort of thing.  I lived in england for a while in the early 70s and listened to some of these pirate stations.  I did not get the politics at the time. it all seems so innocent now in the age of the cell phone video and TMZ.  but its a fun ride into recent history and music.,1399161600,,310,3.7384615384615385
3868334,5,B0027P94CQ,"Can we ever really fathom the time when rock and roll was illegal to broadcast for too long? The year was 1966 in Great Britain, and one radio station was only allowed less than one hour to broadcast rock n roll to the people. That was until the ""Pirate Radio"" boats decided to anchor offshore and stream in 24 hours a day, everything from the Kinks to Buffalo Springfield, to the Rolling Stones and The Turtles, without giving up their location. I could go on forever naming the huge supply of British top pop titles adding to this delicious soundtrack added by writer and director Richard Curtis which is unbelievably inspired by him and without a single flaw. 25,000,000 people on land were listening to the music from the boat in this film, which is named Radio Rock, and they were definitely pirates that loved it much more than anything life on land could offer.

Beginning with the exceptionally bad idea of an extremely quizzical mother, Charlotte (Emma Thompson), sending her son, Carl (Tom Sturridge), to the boat to get some discipline from his very dapper hipster Godfather, Quentin (Bill Nighy). Quentin is far from a role model as the captain of this crew of hedonistic and fun-loving DJs and Young Carl is about to learn the lessons of a lifetime. Meeting the crew that spins the greatest rock ever made is a bit daunting, especially not knowing how to fit in at first with this off-the-cuff bunch. Here, although, there are no prerequisites. The cast of rock n roll personalities partially include; ""The Count"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman), ""Gavin"" (Rhys Ifans), ""Dr. Dave"" (Nick Frost), ""Simple Simon"" (Chris O'Dowd) ""Thick Kevin"" (Tom Brook) and, of course, ""Midnight Mark"" (Tom Wisdom), who is on the air all night and amazes everyone by not saying really anything while broadcasting. This is because ""He's the sexiest man on the planet"", Quentin opines with awe. There are so many personalities aboard and a huge cast just to man the boat and create the hijinx that this captain and crew get into. But first and foremost, to get the music to the masses is job number one.

While these rockers are having the time of their lives, stuffed shirt and snob, Sir Alistair (Kenneth Branagh), and his duplicitous sidekick decide to tell the Prime Minister during a session that he is closing them down while creating a new law to make them illegal. The crew of Radio Rock is now behind the eight ball. Intimidated? Not a chance.

The movie is extremely funny and full of British wit and bawdy, raucous humor along with the extreme competition between The Count and The Legend (Gavin). I should say, although, that it is also full of very strong language and some exceptionally strong scenes that would make the film more for adults. There is much innuendo, along with double entendres throughout this film also included with so much interaction with the crew; game playing, interesting ways to pass the time while not broadcasting, and a lot of chicaneries. This is the U.S. version. I also own the UK version in Blu-ray titled, The Boat That Rocked which includes all of the deleted scenes and I find it a better watch altogether. It would be up to you as it is much longer because of its content, along with director Richard Curtis' comments and a super dance sequence with Rhys Ifans in the deleted scenes. Be sure to watch this reviewed version all the way through the end credits for a rocking song and dance sequence filled with classic album covers over time. I rewind this piece all of the time as I find it very fun to see all of my favorites, and certainly, hear them rocking...",1398470400,3,3596,4.704761904761905

3868392,4,B0027P94CQ,Bill Nighy is great as usual. This is great bit of nostalgia for those of us growing up in Britain during the 50s and 60s,1389657600,,121,3.88
3868393,5,B0027P94CQ,"I haven't heard anyone say they didn't like this movie-  Mostly, I hear ""You haven't seen that yet?  You'd love it!"".  Well, 'they' were right;  I did love it!  A look at a (MUCH) free-er time, I found this flick to be a heartwarming trip into a time I wish I could visit...  A bit 'wild & crazy' (sex, drugs, etc... hey- it's the 60's!), but overall a high-spirited trip through some good folks, good laughs and Fantastic music.

If you like rock, good times and won't be disappointed by a lack of a complicated plot-  then this will likely be two hours you'll be glad you spent.

I think I'm actually gonna buy this one...  :)",1389657600,,628,4.2905982905982905
3868394,3,B0027P94CQ,The movie is great. However I don't understand why some of the best scenes of it are cut and you can see them only if you Go to the special features section. There are many scenes cut. This diminishes its quality,1388448000,,212,4.195121951219512

I tried to finish it but i just couldn't/. This movie was too long and not worth my time ( or yours).
None of the characters were likable or memorable. If you are into profanity, sex, drugs an real comedy, go watch superbad instead. If you watch superbad, at least you will laugh.",1387756800,,302,4.315789473684211

3868401,5,B0027P94CQ,I love this film and bought two for gifts. This is the cut for U.S. release. This was a part of British Rock history that I had not heard about and it was magical. The actors seem very committed to their roles and the timing and delivery are excellent. The disk also contains deleted scenes with narrative from the director that you would not want to miss. These scenes are priceless. I would also like to be able to purchase the British cut of the film.,1385510400,,454,4.290697674418604

3868405,4,B0027P94CQ,"I remember hearing about pirate radio stations in the North Sea when I was in my early teens. I really enjoyed the wit and the music in this film.  Some very talented actors appear; Philip Seymour Hoffman's comic flair was a surprise with the mostly British cast.

A bonus, for me, was in the credits running album covers and there was the album of Scott2, a favorite of mine.  It was great to see the album shown since I wore out my first copy; Scott Walker is not well known here in the US, his home country.",1383523200,,510,4.237113402061856
3868406,5,B0027P94CQ,"I'm told this was a flop in the U.S.  It makes me wonder what people were expecting.  This movie is very funny, very enjoyable, a romp of a movie for all that it takes place on a ship anchored at sea.  The casting is outstanding and the acting is fantastic.  I recommend this movie to people all the time.",1382400000,,305,4.11864406779661
3868407,3,B0027P94CQ,I loved the music and the film has a great cast.  I've since read other reviews that suggest the version released in Britain was superior.  I'd like to see that version some time; but I'm not going to rely on Amazon to watch it.  The playback of my streaming experience was choppy.  It stopped and started so much that it was unwatchable.,1380672000,,338,4.403225806451613
3868408,5,B0027P94CQ,Love this movie. So many great performances. The music rocks. The history is pretty darn interesting too. It's one of those films you will find yourself quoting.,1380585600,,161,5.0
3868409,5,B0027P94CQ,This film is such a treasure! I had never heard of it before when I saw the trailer on Amazon Prime and when I rented it I felt it was totally worth it. What a great story about mid-century England and Rock and Roll!,1380067200,,216,3.9318181818181817

3868420,5,B0027P94CQ,If you were a kid in the late 60's early 70's you will recognize the tunes that play throughout the movie.

3868425,1,B0027P94CQ,"This looked like it would be a really good movie with great character actors like Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifan, Philip Seymour Hoffman... but, not too funny; not worth the time if you're looking for another ""Notting Hill.""  Guess they should have added Hugh Grant!",1369353600,,257,4.840909090909091

3868430,5,B0027P94CQ,A very watchable film. Excellent cast. Well written. A true feel-good movie. Some of my favorite parts are in the deleted scenes section. I had to buy the soundtrack too. This is a film that you'll watch over & over. I'm surprised that I don't remember it coming to theaters. I picked up a copy on a discount table & loved it so much that I bought the blue ray.,1368230400,,361,4.171428571428572
3868431,2,B0027P94CQ,"This is a bit too slapstick for me, I hardly ever quit watching a movie until the very end but for this one I made an exception. I may try watching it again at some point, the bits of music are certainly welcome and clarify the period, but the setting and characters are simply too unrealistic and unbelievable to be anything close to what may have actually taken place.",1367971200,2,370,4.3768115942028984
3868432,5,B0027P94CQ,"This review pertains to the Blu-ray version of The Boat That Rocked that is offered on Amazon.com.  The package is marked for sale in the UK, so I presume that it's the same film that is offered on Amazon.co.uk in Blu Ray.

There is approximately 40+ minutes of deleted scenes on this offering - these are included as extras and some are actually funnier than the scenes left in the film.  The film runs about 135 minutes, but please note that the product description does not list the running time for this offering (on Amazon.com site).

The plot of the film is recounted elsewhere in these reviews, so I won't add to other reviewers' apt descriptions here.  Suffice it to say that the movie is a lot of fun with a great soundtrack and great characters.  I loved it - and so did my date!  I particularly enjoyed the government goon who threatened to make a law against pirate radio stations just so he could shut them down - he was the epitome of big government run amok.

As far as the disk quality is concerned, the transfer and the sound are both great.

This is a really well-made and fun movie - I highly recommend it.

Edited to add:  This should have been titled ""Pirate Radio"", whether offered in the USA or the UK.",1367107200,,1225,4.4

3868438,5,B0027P94CQ,"I heard about this film years ago and wanted to see it but couldn't due to lack of time and money.  Then I see it was upcomming on TV and had a chance to watch it.  My family and I all saw it and loved it, so when my father had his birthday, he asked for the film and I was more than happy to get it for him.  I also got the soundtrack.  Great bundle and a great film.",1364083200,,368,3.5625
3868439,4,B0027P94CQ,"But this war was a pitched battle, a conflict between  feigned British moral principles represented by  a Jesuit-acting MP, more characteristic of an American  John Bircher or KKKer, wanting to rid the UK's airwaves of evil  rock music originating by a band of devoted DJs living aboard  a  coaster freighter- trawler cruising/anchored in the North Sea.  Enjoyable for its peaceful and kindly portrayal of British sexual mores, an easiness between the genders that Americans just don't get, but still lives in pub-crawling today in Britain.  So, boat loads of admiring girls visit to listen, chat, make love, and motor away, waving happily.  One young hero finds his long lost dad, quietly touching, because of its notable absence of accusations, guilt, and judgments ending in hated partings.  As Bill NIghy's character said in ""Love Actually""  ""And your Uncle Billy says kids, don't buy drugs.  Become a rock star and you'll get them for free.""  Funny.  Because Brits know that doesn't make kids drug addicts, yet Americans still haven't gotten it.  This movie is an easy, loose membrane of music and girl loving DJs living in a insulated island where the real world cannot penetrate but eventually does, in a surprisingly dramatic climax.  And, their saving grace, becomes, the very thing that has made their existence economically and socially viable.  Us, human beings, who love great music, and who know dancing to the music is about living your life to the fullest.  A gentle movie with deep messages for the discerning viewer.",1364083200,,1534,5.068

It brings back a lot of the great music I listened to as a teenager on an old style (circa 40's or 50's) radio at night in my room, and with it, a lot of great memories! It's funny how music can transport you back to a certain place and time. This movie does that for me. The cast seems to be having such a good time that it's fun and infectious and I just want to watch it over and over again! Love It!!",1361836800,,439,3.782608695652174

If you like a hilarious group of individuals and high quality story telling you will Love this movie. After watching Pirate Radio i had dreams of going back in time and being aboard one of the actual Pirate Radio ships. I am a big Philip Seymour Hoffman fan so that was just a bonus. A few of my friends found the movie slow, which is not surprising (they have the attention span of a 5 year old). My dad loved it as did most of my friends. The movie follows a crew of a Pirate Radio station that broadcasts from a ship in the English channel. It gives a glimpse into a different side of the 60s movements and sheds light on the conservative mindset of those that apposed the ""radical"" thoughts/ mindsets that were becoming popular at the time.

The scene was about a second visit by women on the week-end, at which time the government lackey also snuck on board and learned that the ship was barely seaworthy.  It's a shame the scene wasn't there, as it would have helped things make sense when the ship later got in distress.  Why was it cut, I wonder?

The most famous of these pirates was Radio Caroline, the inspiration for this film.  One of the oddballs who make up this crew of disc jockeys is played by the inimitable Philip Seymour Hoffman.

3868466,1,B0027P94CQ,"This movie completely fails to capture the spirit of the era it tries so frantically to recreate; it never seems like anything but a sterile 2000s parody of the 1960s, fairly well executed but very poorly conceived and written.

It tries too hard to be hip, and in doing so it misses the sense of urgency and dread that permeated that decade like the first tremors of a cataclysmic earthquake that can't be stopped but hasn't really hit yet. I and everybody I knew (I turned 18 in 1966) expected to die young, either from the crazy war in Viet Nam or a nuclear holocaust or a drug overdose or whatever; but the sense that death was knocking relentlessly at the door heightened every other experience and made life seem both terrifyingly fragile and infinitely precious. We had to live hard and fast, because we didn't have much time.

THAT is why our generation rebelled so strongly against our parents, who had created such a terrifying world and were so complacently offering us to it as its blood sacrifice - it was NOT just arrogant self-indulgence, as this silly and shallow movie makes it seem.

Just playing the music and acting like bad-as$ party-hearty clowns, trying to convince the world that that's what we were like then, is insulting and despicably ignorant.",1348012800,4,1272,4.7207207207207205

Radio today sucks for the most part. Thank goodness I live in a college town and I'm able to pull in the campus station. Clear Channel and the like have completely killed the spirit that drove these DJs to live on a ship and broadcast rock and roll to those who deserve it.

When was the last time you sat with a group of your friends and just listened to the radio? I remember doing it. It doesn't happen anymore. Many will blame iPods, CDs, etc.  I blame crappy radio. Who wants to gather around a radio in the break room or your bedroom to listen to a Nickleback song you can hear every hour and it sucks anyway?

A great movie. The Bluray is a real nice transfer. The music comes through loud and clear, the dialog is easily heard. The picture is clean. I'm glad they didn't add the deleted scenes into the film as a ""director's cut"". They're fun to watch, but I like the pacing the way it is.

You can pick it apart with facts but pirate radio changed the music world in England (the boats were mostly in the Southern North Sea) and the guys who did it were larger than life!  The music is the joy of the film held together by  some funny jokes and a threadbare plot.

3868479,4,B0027P94CQ,"I really liked this movie originally titled ""The Boat That Rocked"" and loosely based on real events from the mid `60's.  English radio would not play the up-and-coming rockers of the era (The Beatles, Stones, Dusty Springfield, etc.), so ships would park outside territorial waters and broadcast.  The political establishment didn't like that and attempted to shut it down.  I wasn't aware of all this until now so I don't know how much of this is fact, but the movie is funny, sexy and interesting.  Then of course there is the terrific soundtrack which I am very familiar with.  The closing credits also flash scores of classic rock album jackets.  The mostly Brit cast obviously had a lot of fun making the film.  Watch for TV stars January Jones (Mad Men) and Jack Davenport (Flash Forward, Private Practice) and especially Kenneth Branagh as the cultural minister bent on destroying rock `n roll.  He's a hoot as is the film.",1332979200,,930,4.80503144654088

I have seen this film at least 5 times now and I never get tired of watching it.  The screenplay and the acting are all top notch and the non-stop barrage of
classic '60's pop/rock make this film a gift to behold.  The energy in this film is infectious.  I have grown to love these characters and re-watching the film is now like visiting with old friends.  It's rare when a film like this comes around and I believe that someday, like ""The Big Labowski"", it will become a cult classic.",1327017600,5,646,4.394957983193278

3868483,4,B0027P94CQ,"Pirate Radio is one of those movies that does an excellent job telling the behind-the-scenes story of British Rock in the 60's and early 70's. For us in the States, that was an era for classic ""British Invasion"" rock ... but in the UK it was more like a real war.  The UK's Rock & Roll is an odd duck compared to Rock & Roll here in the U.S.  There the government OWNS the airwaves.  You can buy a radio or TV but you also have to buy licensing to actually use them!  And the British government owned all the radio and TV stations.  Also, to muck things up even more, the ""authorities"" classified Rock and Roll as ""Obscene"" and ""Pornographic"".  If it was allowed to be played at all, it was for only an hour a day or week ... if even that much.  So, ""pirate"" radio stations were set up on small ships and anchored out beyond the legal limit in the North Sea.  These pirates had their ships registered in places like Liberia and Panama to further protect themselves from the UK's governmental heavy-handedness.  And the great disk jockies of the era left the British Isles and set up business at sea.  An adventure, sure enough, as the movie concentrates the events of the times otherwise the movie would be hours and hours long.  They did a good job as the movie moves along with ... in my opinion ... no slow parts or dead spaces.  And there's action to go with the so-called ""Pirates"" as they invaded British airspace with ""corrupt"" Rock & Roll !  I won't spoil the ending ... just in case you who are reading this does not yet know how it ends.  It's an action ending, surely! But ,it's historically accurate.

Another adventure with this movie ... at least for me, personally, was whether or not I was going to be able to get a copy of ""Pirate Radio"" that worked.  But Amazon helped fix the problem ... even though it wasn'ttheir problem

I had seen ""Pirate Radio"" on HBO and I WANTED the movie for my collection.  I have watched ""Pirate Radio"" ... well, I lost count as to how many times!  It's a movie a lot of you will want to watch multiple times.  The movie is about rock & roll ... but can also be considred a historical documentary ... something I wouldn't at all be surprised if I saw it, one day, on the History Channel.  The historical accuracy is close enough for that, I feel.

So ... buy it (from Amazon, who sticks by its customers!) and watch it ... and enjoy the mucsic of the era in the background as the DJ's air it whilehe story unfolds ... for what actually were an oppressed people thursting for it.

Fun!  Good times!  I remember them all well !  For the music of that era helped me through Vietnam and helped me keep my head on straight.",1319587200,,2664,4.2885771543086175

3868487,5,B0027P94CQ,"This is easily one of the funnier movies I've seen in a while. It really captures the spirit of the hippie movement in the 60s and 70s. The ensemble cast works really well. None other the actors shines too much, and none get left behind. It's a good mix of strong personalities and weaker ones. The humor is of course dirty humor, but it seems to fit the plot and characters and is never forced. Personally, I thought this film had much fewer toilet jokes than most modern ""so-called comedies"" like Hangover and Old School. The toilet humor seems appropriate for and drives the plot. On top of that, you can't beat 60s rock'n roll music as a soundtrack. Overall, 4.5 stars.",1312761600,,673,4.524590163934426
3868488,3,B0027P94CQ,"The year was 1966.  Although the sounds of rock & roll, R&B , folk and soul were exploding all over the countryside the staid BBC continued to program only the news, interview programs and the same old dreary music.  The writer/director of ""Pirate Radio"" Richard Curtis recalled in a recent interview with Rob Lowman of the Los Angeles Daily News that ""In my dad's generation they literally had eight records.  They had ""The Unforgettable Nat King Cole"",  two versions of My Fair Lady""--the stage and the movie one--""Hello, Dolly"" by Louis Armstrong and one called ""Mantovani:  Song Hits from Theaterland"".""  Hmm.  Sounds almost exactly like the music collection my own parents had!  Meanwhile, bubbling just beneath the surface was this cornucopia of new and exciting sounds that was resonating with hundreds of thousands of British teens and young adults.  The void would be filled by some enterprising entrepreneurs who decided there was lots of money to be made.  So they set up radio stations on old merchant ships and broadcast from just a few miles off the coast just out of reach of the long arm of the British government.  The idea was an instant smash!  Teenagers loved the music while British officials absolutely hated  the idea.  ""Pirate Radio"" tells the story of one such ficticious station broadcasting from the bowels of an old tanker in the North Sea dubbed Radio Rock.  I was 15 years old in 1966 so I am keenly aware of what the excitement was all about.  It certainly was a great time to be a teen!

As you might expect ""Pirate Radio"" features a rowdy group of seafaring DJ's including Rhys Ifans, Chris O'Dowd, Nick Frost and the effervescent Philip Seymour Hoffman among others all under the dubious direction of the station's owner Quentin (Bill Nighy).  During the week these guys live for the music, their growing legion of fans and for each other.  But on Saturdays they are allowed a few hours of much needed female companionship and all hell seems to break loose.  Also on board for a visit is Quentin's godson, a naive teen named Carl (Tom Sturridge).  This is a coming of age experience for young Carl who gets to sew some wild oats while at the same time experiencing all of the madcap antics and personalities that surround him.  But wait!  Back in London plans are underway to put a stop to it all.  Sir Alistair (Kenneth Branagh) has vowed to silence these ""outlaw"" stations once for all and he will use every legal trick in his arsenal to make that happen.  Seems like it is only a matter of time before the government will catch up with them. Deep down inside everyone on board Radio Rock seems to understand that and they are just enjoying the ride for as long as it will last.

At the end of the day there is lots to like about ""Pirate Radio"".  Since this is more or less an ensemble cast the chemistry between these kooky charactors is quite apparent.  Then there's the music!  You will hear snippets of sensational tunes from groups like The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, The Who, and The Supremes to name but a few.  It's no wonder why people who grew up in the 1960's have such a hard time letting go of this music. I also read where most of this film is shot with a hand-held camera that gives ""Pirate Radio"" a certain authenticity you won't find in other movies.  So enjoy the music and enjoy the hijinx!

3868489,5,B0027P94CQ,"It might be hard to believe today but there was a time when rock and roll was considered scandalous, filthy!
When the ""establishment"" had the silly notion that the jungle beat would not only brain wash us but turn us into savage juveniles.
This is a movie that portrays that time to perfection.
The dj's are heroes and the music not only changed our lives, it saved our lives.

It was our music. Not the establishments, not our parents. Ours.
The movie itself is about those pioneering dj's that were brave enough to ""fight city hall"".
The performances are wonderful with each important scene puntuated by a great rock and roll track from the era.
I like the fact that they were true to 60's FM radio and featured a lot of lesser know tunes.

The montage (and music) over the closing credits will have you cheering.
No Beatles tunes but I'm sure that is due to the fact that rights could not be obtained.

Just a great story, solid performances and fantastic soundtrack. A must see.

3868492,4,B0027P94CQ,"There was a period of my life during which for more than 12 years I played in rock bands, worked as a DJ in rock stations, wrote for 3 different rock magazines and a newspaper, and lost a lot of money organizing rock concerts, but man, what a gas! Were? Doesn't matter and that's another story. So this movie was more than sweet memories and like living all over again for me. Never worked in a pirate radio station though, but those days are long gone. With Internet Radio Stations, the mp3 players and music downloading, with musical magazines going virtual, with the prostitution of the music industry and the general media, it's no longer fun. I've interviewed well known bands and people in the real rock world, but now days there's nothing worth covering and few things worth playing, mostly metal. Basically, radio, as we know it, is dead and so is printed matter. Ask any radio station manager, newspaper editor and any book editor. Not everybody is thrilled with things like the iPad.
Anyway, let's get to the movie `cause if you liked this one, then you're gonna love  ""Almost Famous"" (also with Philip Seymour Hoffman) and hell, why not, ""FM"", ""Good Morning Nam"" and even ""American Graffity"", the way I did. ""The Boat That Rocked"" (a.k.a. Pirate Radio) is a fiction movie based on real facts. That is: by 1967 there were about 20 pirate radio stations in the UK which played a Top 40 format, forgotten and probably forbidden in the Victorian norrow minded BBC. In the early 60' there were two well known pirate radio stations broadcasting from offshore ships: Radio Caroline and Radio London. The movie takes from them. There was also a government act in 1967, the ""Marine Broadcasting Offences Act"" (""Marine Offences Act"" in the movie). It was something ridiculous then and even now, but concerning the arts and technology all governments tend to be quite illiterate. The bottom line is that even today there are over 100 pirate radio stations in the UK alone. Why? The same old story. Official radio stations live on commercials and on payola. Yes, I worked in several and I knows how it works. So, there's music that they'll never play and only the pirate radio stations will be able to cover all the rainbow of music that people want to listen to. That's why I love Internet Radio, specially those commercial free stations. I don't know of any offical radio station playing, for example, psychedelic rock now days. Thus the success of the Internet Radio.
The plot in the movie is great. Simple, straight, honest, comic, with some hints of drama, but the essence is there, the music is there. The life DJs lived, and beleive me, those DJs in the movie are too clean and decent. Well the movie is too clean in that matter. There are some insinuations about drugs but you won't see anybody smoking pot or dropping acid or getting really plastered. The stag party was too decent for guys that are supposed to be rock DJs in the mid and late sixties of the 20th century. Anyway, one gets a lot of laughs and a Hollywood end.
The OST is great but there are a few mistakes that can be explained only by the fact that the person in charge of it, chose a specific song because of the moment in the movie. For instance, Hendrix' ""The Wind Cries Mary"" is from the album ""Are You Experienced?"" released in August of 1967 long after the period which is established in the movie, but there's a very nice touch of homage towards Jimi in the scene were Quentin (excellently portrayed by Bill Nighy - don't miss him in ""Wild Target"") enters the lower deck of the ship just to find DJ Mark surrounded by naked girls exactly as in the cover of the 1968 ""Electric Ladyland"" album. Hilarious. Another song is Jeff Beck's ""Hi Ho Silver Lining"", a single from 1967. So is Procol Harum's ""A Whiter Shade Of Pale"". You can hear The Who with ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" from 1971, but it wasn't included in the OST CD. I don't understand why David Bowie's 1982 ""Let's Dance"" was chosen for the closing credits of the movie. It's even included in the OST CD. Bottom line, again, it doesn't matter, the music is far out.
Although there are a couple of Stone's tracks, they are not included in the OST. Copyrights I suppose, Mick and Keith think they're still poor. Arthur Brown's ""Fire"" was also left out. So was ""Little Saint Nick"" by The Beach Boys. And so was Ennio Morricone's theme ""For a Few Dollars"" and several other.
Some mistakes I won't excuse: the Capitol and A&M labels on the records shown in the movie were designed in the 70's; there's a modern Panasonic headphones in one scene, you don't play a 45 singles at 33 RPM, slim straight arms for turntables and tape reels were introduced in radio stations many years later (specially the arms), there's a drum head that I'm sure wasn't there around those days and man, anyone who's worked in a radio station knows what'll happen if you climb the antenna during transmissions. And finally, we didn't call them condoms, but Johnnies.
The cast in perfect. I already mentioned Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bill Nighy, but not far behind are Rhys Ifans (unforgetable in ""Notting Hill"") as rock star DJ Gavin, Kenneth Branagh as the Hitlerian looking and dictatorial Sir Alistair Dormandy and Jack Davenport as the sleasy assistant Twatt (yes, with two ts at the end). Definitely a movie for all ages. For those who like to remember through music and for those who weren't born and have the interest and curiosity to find out how it was.
(P.S. From personal experience I know that record players are supposed to be flat horizontal in order to play and at the end of the movie there's no way they were leveled)",1306540800,2,5647,4.613320079522863

3868494,5,B0027P94CQ,"As a rabid fan of the British classic rock era who grew up hearing all this music during the sixties, it was amazing to see a film that could effectively weave so much music into a film. There is more than a ""coming of age"" element to the film. This comedy contains diverse characters, each with a story to tell while keeping a central plot intact. The story revolves around the frustrated and futile attempts authorities in the form of an angry and driven government bureaucrat Sir Dormandy, played by the grand villian actor Kenneth Branagh and his hired hand Dominic Twatt (Jack Davenport) scheme at every turn to keep rock and roll from the airwaves and homes of the UK's commoners and working class people, dancing and enjoying themselves. The cast is brilliant and imaginatively drawn up as celebrity radio disc jockeys that form a band of misfits proving that rock and roll itself holds a wide range of character and indeed is the main character of this film (Even the closing credits creatively display popular album LPs of today and yesterday). Predominantly mid to late 1960's English pop artists are featured like The Who, The Kinks, Cat Stevens, The Hollies to name just a few and there are also American rock artists scattered throughout the film such as Jimi Hendrix, The Beach Boys, The Isley Brothers and The Supremes. Curiously, there are no Beatles tracks in the film although in the deleted scenes of the Bonus Features, they make a late night visit to Abbey Road Studios to salute the Fab Four and the lead DJ Count, perfectly played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, whom is insulted by another newly seafaring competitor ""Radio Sunshine""'s motto ""Who needs The Beatles when you have Herman's Hermits"" eloquently uttered by the carefree, but all wise elderly veteran and station manager Quentin (Bill Nighy).

3868498,2,B0027P94CQ,"This film purports to recreate, as it says in the opening scenes, 1966, a heyday of British rock'n'roll.  Pirate radio was shut down in late 1967.  So it is baffling that the movie is loaded with references to the late 60s and even the early 70s--in its characters, clothes, and songs, esp.  (one Dj is an ancient, apparently 55-year old hippie, as though he teleported in from some 1990 film).  Two songs associated with American top-40 radio in 1969 (released in late '68) are used as signatures of British Pirate Radio--the Turtles' ""Elenore"" and  Tommy James' ""Crimson and Clover.""  Yeh, when I think 1966 English rock, I think of the Turtles and Tommy James.  Uh, no.  These weird anachronisms are potentially forgivable, but the script is too full of other inanities to list: it scarcely has a plot, but is a sort of collage of idiotic, disconnected scenes and jokes.  The film's real downfall is its script:  80% of the humor--I am not overstating the dumbness here--is a kind of reality-show, babbling toilet/ sex humor that would probably be abjectly eliminated from a Jackass movie.  The often sundrenched, high contrast photography is nice and poignantly suggestive of what the film might have been, so I give this two stars.  But the script is a no-star, frozen-dog-in-the-night ""woof.""  I have no idea how Philip Seymour Hoffman ended up in this thing.

How can that combination go wrong? How can a fan of everything rock and roll be so disappointed?

This movie has some nice scenes, captures the freshness of when this music was streaming off the radio and the wonderful outlaw nature of the early days of radio. The problem is that the movie is unbelievably so disjointed, jumbled and disorganized that it incohesively rambles. Rock and roll flicks shoudn't play like a boring, art film but ""Pirate Radio"" does. It's not a concert movie, it's supposed to have a plot and maintain structure but it does not.

The trailer is misleading because it creates a false sense through, what is in essence, simply a montage which is not reflective of the actual film.  While it does seem to capture some of the magic of the era, it's way too messy to be considered a quality film.",1298592000,4,1127,4.6767676767676765

Full of terrific cast chemistry and an amazing Catalog of 60's rock & pop the film runs 2 hrs. The crew are the targets of the generic UK establishment embodied by a superbly mirthless government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) who resolves to shut down the pirates. Meanwhile, subplots abound as Young Carl, a recently expelled teen joins the crew and attempts to fit in, possibly to lose his virginity with the aid of the DJs,  perhaps even to meet his father for the first time. The list of possible and improbable suspects include: Carls Godfather and 'station' manager Quentin (Bill Nighy), brash American DJ ""The Count"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman), ""Doctor"" Dave (Nick Frost), returned legend Gavin Kavanagh (Rhys Ifans). As pressure increases from the suits, so does DJ rivalry.

 Everyone is just fab in this, Nighy is as perfectly suited for this era as he was playing a rocker in Love actually, in fact Rhys seems to be playing a younger version of that very character, brilliantly !!! Frost is at his best, although I did not recognize him w/out Simon Pegg, as another of the amoral DJs. Hoffman is on his game as ever.  Emma Thompson has a great cameo role, suspiciously disconnected from her real ex's half of the picture. The best radio movie I've seen, well worth the running time. Many on the scenes seem shot in a one camera take that sells the crews moments together well. Ultimately the climax is predictable but still satisfying.

Surprisingly as more than two thirds of the nation were listening to these illegal broadcasts and they had probably the greatest rock bands in the world. The movie is not an exact duplication of what happened as some will point out, but a smattering of the overall operation on the ship. The music is great but lacks a few of the bands like ""The Beatles"" that were being played regularly at the time. Who knows why, problems with the records companies rights, or some other reason, but it's ashame as it would have given a more realistic musical soundtrack at least.

3868508,4,B0027P94CQ,"First Question: Who put the rock in rock `n' roll? Well, of course, Bo Diddley (okay, okay others too). Second Question: Who brought rock `n' roll to your double-locked bedroom, dank cellar, storage-filled garage, or other secret ear place back in old time battery-operated transistor radio (pre-ipod, alright) days? Well, of course, your local dee-jay who helped you while away your night, your dream-plagued rock `n' roll night, with his (mainly) mile-a-minute-banter, selection of platters (records, pre-CD, DVD, itune, youtube, you've heard about them, right?), and, yes, selected advertising targeted to the newly enriched (maybe) teenager with disposable dollars. Such names as Allan Freedman, Wolfman Jack, Murry the K, and Arnie Ginsberg come quickly to mind. And although the music, praise be, outlasted the careers and remembrance of that lot this classic rock period is associated in my mind (and yours too, I bet) with that very dee-jay night. And that, my friends, is the premise behind this very nicely done trip down rock memory land- British version.

In many ways the British 1960s rock explosion paralleled the American classic rock scene, although later than that genre's American 1950s heyday. The greatest difference, however, is the way that British audiences heard their rock- literally through the pirate radio of the title. Off-shore, out in the ocean depths, white waves splashing against some barnacled old tub of a ship, rock radio. Without getting into the ins and outs of British broadcasting traditions the battle, the age-old battle really, here is between those who wanted to listen to rock and not just in that double-locked bedroom mentioned above, and those nasty governmental officials and their hangers-on who want to outlaw it by shutting down this uncontrolled method. That battle drives the tension and plot line to almost bizarre (by today's cyberspace standards) ends. But what this film is about is a bunch of guys (mainly, again) who loved to play rock, who loved to present it in their own fashion, and who wanted the fame, fortune (and, incidental sex) that came with heroic dee-jay-dom.

This motley crew is ready to go down wit the ship, literally, in order to keep rock freedom alive. Of course there are more than a few gag (British gag, ala Monty Python) scenes that are better left unmentioned but this is a feel good movie with plenty of drugs, sex, and rock and roll on the high seas. Jesus. You might ask what was wrong with that? Ah, come to think of it what was wrong with that? The cast includes Phillip Seymour Hoffman (a very versatile actor when you realize that he also played American novelist Truman Capote in the In Cold Blood execution-driven drama Tru) as the Count, the only American in the lot. But this whole mix of radio personalities is a good out in the seas rock night, late night, early morning and so on. So, here is the drill. Bo (and, yes, others) put the rock in rock `n' roll but the Count and the boys put the bop in the be-bop pirate radio night. See this one.",1294272000,,3043,4.895348837209302
3868509,2,B0027P94CQ,"**SPOILERS**

**1/2

With a tone that is 180 degrees off from the subject it is chronicling, the soft and cuddly ""Pirate Radio""  appeals more to the wistful nostalgia of its aging, baby-boomer audience than to the spirit of teenaged rebellion that defined their youth.

The movie takes place in 1966, that moment in time when an entire generation of young people had begun revolting against everything their uptight elders stood for - with rock'n'roll, as the one indispensable and unifying force in the movement, giving voice to those feelings.  And considering that much of this musical iconoclasm was emanating from England itself - in the form of the British Invasion - it's rather astonishing to note that rock music could be broadcast for only a single hour a day on British radio at that time.  That is until a handful of anarchic DJs came up with the idea of floating boats out to sea, far from the reach of the censors and the law, and spinning the discs from there.  The result became known as ""pirate radio,"" a thorn-in-the-side for the morality-police in the government but an indispensable listening sensation for the millions of dedicated fans who tuned in on a regular basis.

""Pirate Radio"" takes us aboard a fictional ship called Radio Rock to provide us with a behind-the-scenes look at the station, but writer/director Richard Curtis hasn't come up with a storyline or a set of characters worthy of his subject.  The nominal protagonist is Carl (Tom Sturridge), a 17-year-old virgin whose mother (Emma Thompson) has sent him to the boat to spend time with his godfather, Quentin (Bill Nighy), the head of the operation (obvious shades of ""Almost Famous"" in the setup).  Carl gets to hook up with all the others on the boat, including Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a smug American DJ who goes by the moniker The Chief.  The trouble is that, despite all their assorted eccentricities, none of these people are particularly interesting as characters or convincing as rebels, so we're left with little to engage us beyond the snippets of all those amazing songs from the era that are constantly being played over the action.

Even worse is the ""villain"" of the piece, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy, hammily played by Kenneth Branaugh, who's made it his life's work to not only see that the station is shut down permanently but to make it a crime even to be caught LISTENING to the station, let alone running it.  Since Dormandy never becomes anything more than just a crude caricature of an uptight, petty bureaucrat, the dockside scenes are even less engaging than all the goofy hijinks and antics playing out on the high seas.  Moreover, the humor lacks the starchiness and brittleness one generally associates with the best of British comedy. And, in what would appear to be one of those bizarre inverse laws of physics, the more ""Pirate Radio"" strives to be a ""feel-good"" experience, the less good it feels.

Things really go awry when Curtis turns the whole thing into a mini-""Titanic"" in the closing stretches, a plot device that converts Dormandy from a pompous elitist snob into a heartless monster.  But no matter, for by that time we`ve already had just about all the self-congratulatory smugness and self-conscious cutesiness we can stand in a single sitting.  And what could have been a slashing satire about changing social mores and anti-establishment, youthful rebellion turns instead into a safe, middlebrow and comfy little heart-warmer designed to put a smile on our faces and a spring in our step - which is the very last thing a movie dedicated to the spirit of rock`n`roll should ever be.",1294185600,2,3633,4.890879478827362

3868512,4,B0027P94CQ,"Excellent period piece about the efforts to by pass the restrictions on the BBC by off shore radio broadcasting by what eventually becomes an outlawed radio station. Has elements of a true story reflecting Great Britian's conservativism clashing with its own great British Invasion. The movie has a lot of similarity to the 5 star film, ""Almost Famous"" since the main charcter is a young man who throws himself into an Animal House style group; in Midnight this case DJs on what looks like a fishing trawler. Like Almost, where the youngster is emersed in a rock band, here its the decadent world of care free DJs that are dedicated to the music of rock n roll with a passion that careens over the air waves. Each offers a different personal touch with their call names; The Count (Hoffman), Thick Kevin, Midnight Mark, Doctor Dave Simple Simon, News John and the princely late arrival, Gavin Canavagh.  The DJs have varying levels of egos that makes the film more interesting as some act like Gods, with powerful fan positive reinforcement. Tension build as the BBC starts to close in lead by  a Michael Palin look alike by the name of Mr. Roberts. The character almost makes me chuckle as the actor creates  over the top Python moments that are much more dry without the outbursts.  Hoffman is the other similarity to Almost as the film also revolves around him as the top DJ but tension builds as the super star Gavin arrives on board creating a boost to the station while creating a building rivalry between Hoffman and Gavin. Another complexity arises as the youth, who came on board to potentially spend time with  the station owner who is presumed to be his dad, played by (Bill Nighy) may not be sure since his rock star sexy mother, played by Emma Thompson, may not be sure herself.  The film has a great cast that includes January Jones (Mad Men) who plays the most desperate of dedicated fans. The film is very entertaining, captures some extreme decadent behavior of the period and a great contributor to the film of course is the outstanding the sound track  with a grand collection of 60s artists and hits.

3868518,5,B0027P94CQ,"PIRATE RADIO is a blast from the past. It's 1966, and the staid BBC is dedicated to snoringly slow commentary radio, The Classical Hour, The Afternoon Classical Hour, The Evening Classical Hour, The Wartime Hit Parade, The Whitebread Jazz Time, and the news. Rock 'n' Roll gets about 45 minutes worth of airplay between ads for Ribena and Oxo. And this at the height of the British Invasion. Of course, it makes sense. Rock 'n'Roll had jumped the pond, leaving British fans pining.

Except for Pirate Radio. Trawlers, anchored just outside of the UK's territorial waters, are hijacking John Bull's airwaves and squelching the Hit Parade under an avalanche of Top Forty tunes. The soundtrack to the film is the soundtrack of our lives. Donovan, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Gerry And The Pacemakers, Herman's Hermits, and The Beatles provide the killer soundtrack to this film.

What's wonderful about PIRATE RADIO is the Pirate Energy of the ensemble cast (with names like The Count and Thick Kevin), who are totally outside of convention, a madcap collection of rock 'n' roll warriors who are battling the British Broadcasting Corporation's leaden-arsed Establishment led by Mr. Roberts and his assistants, Mr. Twatt and Ms. Clitt.

3868519,2,B0027P94CQ,"This is a movie which doesn't really know what it's supposed to be. It's certainly not a documentary; those of us who were there. like me, remember pirate radio very well and it was nothing like this. Yet it's not really a comedy, in fact the first half of the movie has very little to laugh at and the film closes with a lengthy Titanic-type disaster segment, which is again purely fictitious. There's a coming-of-age sexual awakening theme, there's rivalry between the DJs, there's a stuffed-shirt government parody (Kenneth Branagh entirely wasted in a caricature of a right-wing government minister, ignoring the fact that the government of the day was left-wing Labour). The whole thing doesn't hang together and isn't very funny. The movie disappeared quickly at the box office and deservedly so.

Why should this have been? It's a great cast, the writer/director Richard Curtis has been responsible for some brilliant comedy (The Vicar of Dibley, for instance) and the theme was worthy of a movie treatment. It had everything in its favor and yet it's less than the sum of its parts. I think the answer lies partly in the special features, in which Curtis explains that the movie turned out way longer than anyone expected, so they had to cut a lot of the funniest stuff out. He's right; the deleted scenes would have made a better movie than what was left in. What we have here is a writer/director who needed badly someone else to come in with a big blue pencil and a critical eye and take out a lot of the dross. Shorter, snappier scenes and more real comedy would have worked better.

The other problem is that Curtis chose as his theme something that really happened and then made it into fiction. The trouble is that he didn't sufficiently detach reality from fantasy, so what could have been an engrossing story was lost in the made-up depiction and what could have been pure comedy was dragged out into a lengthy bore by trying to keep the story together. It's a movie which got lost at sea.

There is the redeeming feature of the music (which earned it an extra star), although as other reviewers have pointed out, even here the movie can't stick to the facts and plays discs from outside the period. Still, the songs are great and I'd suggest that you skip through the movie and watch the deleted scenes.",1288396800,2,2321,4.669926650366748
3868520,2,B0027P94CQ,"I will take this movie as a parody on how we view the 1960s today, with the dubious benefit of hindsight that automatically makes idiots of all authorities and the older generation and mixes it with anachronisms galore.

It is, indeed, true that BBC Radio by 1966, when this film begins, was playing very little of the kind of music we now describe as ""rock"". That left a market open to pirate radio stations basing their economy on advertisers. The British government, believing at the time that radio broadcasting should be non-commercial and purely based on quality, looked for ways to shut down these pirate stations, which not only played music but also commercials of the most stupid and annoying kind and probably didn't pay the musicians the royalties they should.

Also, it is only fair to say that after having managed to shut down the pirate stations, the BBC learned from their mistakes. It employed many of the DJs who had previous been working for the pirate stations and turned into the most wonderful, non-commercial, exciting and cutting-edge presenter of modern music in the world. It has stayed that way ever since.

But such a story wouldn't make much of a film, would it? Neither would conscious grown-ups being genuinely worried that their teenage daughters become pregnant or infected with sexually transmitted diseases. No, in the world of film we want colour on the screen but black and white morality, and what could be a better subject matter then than the mid-1960s?

Lets get a bunch of popular actors in and make them play some role they played several times before ... and then let the anachronisms begin. I'll list but a few of them.

1. The term ""rock"" and ""rock and roll"" runs through this film from its title onwards, but in fact nothing could be more unfashionable in mid-Sixties Britain than subscribing to this term, then only associated with the 1950s, greasy rockers, etc. Instead, youngsters would be into R&B, Soul, Modern Jazz, Motown, Blue Beat, Beat Music, Mersey Beat etc. Or simply pop music. But never, ever ""rock and roll"", and most certainly not the abbreviation ""rock"", which only came into use during the late 1980s, later to be flogged ad nausiam by Jack Black. Another term belonging to the 1980s is ""vinyl"" used for LPs and singles. I'm only talking about Britain here, but that is were the story takes place.

2. Loosely knitted hippie vests were not yet invented in 1966. You're at least half a decade off the mark there. Likewise, shoulder long hair and shaggy beards were not a feature for any men other than genuine tramps until very late in the 1960s. No girl would openly declare herself a lesbian to complete strangers, and if she did they would have a stroke on the spot. Men didn't talk openly to each other about their emotions, lack of sex life etc., and that's putting it mildly. In fact, as you may have noticed, most of us still don't.

3. About half of the songs played in this movie had not been recorded or released by the time the plot unravels. No wonder the film makers have omitted the dates of issue on the soundtrack credits.

4. About half of the records played in this movie display label designs from subsequent decades. Likewise, LP covers are nearly all reissues, displaying none of the characteristics of the period.

Finally, I have to say that the acting, camerawork etc. is very good indeed. While nothing here makes you scream with laughter, there is a general humour running through it all which I like. However, with its pretty adolescent obsession with sexual issues and general lack of some major concept idea, this would have been much better suited for a TV sitcom than a feature film.",1288310400,5,4293,4.773584905660377
3868521,2,B0027P94CQ,"Pirate Radio has one really big problem- it's not interesting at *all*.

The storyline consists of a bunch of young guys partying on a ship in the middle of the ocean. They get drunk all the time, they sleep with a variety of women, and then... they repeat the same formula over and over again until I eventually had to shut the movie off when I realized it wasn't going anywhere.

I gave it a chance for about an hour and 15 minutes though. I only had 30 minutes left. I didn't have the will power to stomach those remaining 30 minutes.

On rare occasions you'll witness the guys actually talking about the rock & roll scene that was popular at the time (the late 60's) by either asking each other trivia questions, and sometimes (get this!) they'll even play some Hollies or Stones albums and actually be DJs.

The segment about saying the ""f"" word over the air was definitely groundbreaking back in the day, but the movie failed to make saying such an extreme word dangerous, interesting or edgy. It just came across as bland writing with a failed attempt at suspense.

I can't believe how much emphasis was placed on sleeping with women and actually devoting lengthy segments to this portion of the storyline. It was a bit much to say the least.

The film soundtrack is good at least, but let's be honest- most of the songs played during the movie can be heard on any given classic rock FM radio station these days, so the song selection is nothing really exciting by this point in time because most of us are totally used to the songs

Now I have no idea if this really was how pirate radio stations REALLLY used to operate in Britain back in the late 60's, but let's say this was how disc jockeys went about their jobs. It's not interesting, and it's certainly not good enough to make a movie out of it.

I fail to see the appeal of a movie like this. I guess if you like pointless nonsense it's not bad. I don't.",1287878400,,1919,4.370786516853933
3868522,2,B0027P94CQ,"I will take this movie as a parody on how we view the 1960s today, with the dubious benefit of hindsight that automatically makes idiots of all authorities and the older generation and mixes it with anachronisms galore.

It is, indeed, true that BBC Radio by 1966, when this film begins, was playing very little of the kind of music we now describe as ""rock"". That left a market open to pirate radio stations basing their economy on advertisers. The British government, believing at the time that radio broadcasting should be non-commercial and purely based on quality, looked for ways to shut down these pirate stations, which not only played music but also commercials of the most stupid and annoying kind and probably didn't pay the musicians the royalties they should.

Also, it is only fair to say that after having managed to shut down the pirate stations, the BBC learned from their mistakes. It employed many of the DJs who had previous been working for the pirate stations and turned into the most wonderful, non-commercial, exciting and cutting-edge presenter of modern music in the world. It has stayed that way ever since.

But such a story wouldn't make much of a film, would it? Neither would conscious grown-ups being genuinely worried that their teenage daughters become pregnant or infected with sexually transmitted diseases. No, in the world of film we want colour on the screen but black and white morality, and what could be a better subject matter then than the mid-1960s?

Lets get a bunch of popular actors in and make them play some role they played several times before ... and then let the anachronisms begin. I'll list but a few of them.

1. The term ""rock"" and ""rock and roll"" runs through this film from its title onwards, but in fact nothing could be more unfashionable in mid-Sixties Britain than subscribing to this term, then only associated with the 1950s, greasy rockers, etc. Instead, youngsters would be into R&B, Soul, Modern Jazz, Motown, Blue Beat, Beat Music, Mersey Beat etc. Or simply pop music. But never, ever ""rock and roll"", and most certainly not the abbreviation ""rock"", which only came into use during the late 1980s, later to be flogged ad nausiam by Jack Black. Another term belonging to the 1980s is ""vinyl"" used for LPs and singles. I'm only talking about Britain here, but that is were the story takes place.

2. Loosely knitted hippie vests were not yet invented in 1966. You're at least half a decade off the mark there. Likewise, shoulder long hair and shaggy beards were not a feature for any men other than genuine tramps until very late in the 1960s. No girl would openly declare herself a lesbian to complete strangers, and if she did they would have a stroke on the spot. Men didn't talk openly to each other about their emotions, lack of sex life etc., and that's putting it mildly. In  fact, as you may have noticed, most of us still don't.

3868523,5,B0027P94CQ,"IF you want to know what it was like to listen to your radio in the mid 60's in Europe, buy this movie!

My family moved to Brussels in early 1964 when I was a teen. At that time, in early 1964 all I had to listen to was Radio Luxemburg. That station only played the first minute of any rock song, I have no idea why. In the summer of 1964 Radio Caroline started up, a pirate radio station. There were two of them, one in the North Sea and one south of England. I listened to radio caroline south all the time. They not only played a whole song, they actually played songs from everywhere, the west to east coast of America and British songs. This movie portrays the station as kinda crude in their language. Truthfully....YES! I will never forget New Year's Eve 1964 at 11pm, lying in my bed listening to them and hearing things I NEVER heard on American radio. I was lying there in pain trying not to laugh too loud for my parents to hear me as I heard their jokes. There were two DJ's on that night until midnight, both drunk!

The person who started Radio Caroline was an American and he named them for Caroline Kennedy. The radio control room you see in the movie is an exact replica of the control room on Radio Caroline.

Though this movie is fiction, the truth is that there was a wedding performed on Radio Caroline North and Radio Caroline South did sink in a force 10 gale, much to the glee of the British government.

This movie shows the audience exactly what it was like in Europe in the mid 60's with the freedom of pirate radios, like nothing America ever had, or the world will ever have again!",1286668800,30,1611,4.254901960784314

When you see the number of outtakes on the BD (45 min worth), and the love the director has for each one (by way of his introductions), you can understand why the film is long. Decisions, decisions. Maybe some of the best stuff ended up on the cutting room floor, but its inclusion would not have moved the plot forward, he claims. (A long scene in which Rhys Ifans describes to young Carl why he returned to Radio Rock, set in a Mexican cantina, is particularly poignant.)

All the disc jockeys in the film are very ""real."" Ralph Brown as Bob sort of reprises his role as Danny in Withnail and I. Philip Seymour Hoffman as The Count, the token American, is as irreverent as the rest. Tom Sturridge is perfect as the gormless lost boy, a fatherless, virgin, 18-year old sent to the ship as punishment by his mom. Kenneth Branagh, as the civil servant wanting to sink the ship, is an old-school, silent-film style villain born, as the British say, many, many drinks short.

3868540,5,B0027P94CQ,"Allow me to sum up the essence of this delightful movie by the gifted director, Richard Curtis:

When a pure life-affirming force of nature gestates and emerges, no matter what impoverished elements in society this miracle threatens--- in this case, the British government in the mid 60s, and this movie is based on actual events--it, the force of nature and its purveyors and celebrants...will triumph, thus redefining both David and Goliath.

Typical of Mr. Curtis""s films, this one has a large cast of characters.  In this,  each is endearing, heroic and truth centered.....mostly Brits, but one is played with his usual apparent effortlessness, by the American character actor of infinite range, Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

It seems to me,  whatever property Mr. Hoffman is moved to be a part of, ends up worth seeing.

This film, to both my horror and happiness, made me realize I had actually forgotten that rock and roll, in its early incarnation , and internationally, was an incredible, distilled  passion-joy-eros liberation infusion for every cell.

It awakened and galvanized the human core.....made every (often dormant) part of people worldwide ignite and burst free.  The Motown classic (part of this film's soundtrack) Dancing in The Street (Martha Reeves) conveys it all perfectly.

Remember when The Rolling Stones were young and fierce and juicy... and not oily wax replicants of their original selves?

Even if you were not yet on the planet, or only a zygote at the time...you deserve to experience the heady wonder of it.

Seeing/hearing/feeling this movie will deliver those goods: you will smile, you will maybe do some compulsive leaping about without a shred of self consciousness....and you may even end up editing the contents of your ipod as well.",1279756800,,1774,5.160839160839161

A lot of these running stories really don't work very well.

I also had some trouble with casting. Too many of the bunch were sketchily written and the actors did little to flesh them out. I simply had no feelings at all for these guys who were supposed to be the reason Pirate Radio lasted as long as it did and had the impact it had. Phillip Seymour Hoffman does his usual great job but I've never seen him phone in a performance, so there is little surprise there. The music was good (of course). They pulled a lot of tunes from the most important era in rock history.

There had to be more to all this than was shown here, particularly given the fact that they were targeted by the government for extinction.

3868545,4,B0027P94CQ,"Just had to say a few words about this movie. It means a great deal to me because as a little girl I lived in the UK and was one of those kids who listened to one of the Pirate Radio stations at night, and yes, in bed, and through my pillow, just like you see in the movie. So this meant a great deal to me. Hard to give a real honest review since I brought so much of my own emotion to it. Being a great fan of ""Love Actually"", and even ""Notting Hill"", I knew at least that this would be a likable movie. They do that so well. Maybe too likable. Maybe this time, everyone sort of knew they were loveable, and sort of lost a bit of the ""really? --- you think I'm loveable?"" feeling of the last two movies. This one got a bit too cute for its own good. I mean to have two lackeys for the bad administrator hell bent on destroying the radio station named ""Mr. Twatt"", and ""Miss Clitt"", it's well, you don't need to go that far. But these days, beggars' of feel good movies can't be choosers, and damn if you don't like these guys (and one lesbian), despite their self-inflicted adorableness. The most interesting for me was the bonus stuff. I'm a sucker for those bonus materials in DVD's, and always go to them first. Some are wonderful, other's horrible, and many just ""filler"". The worse seem to be in the ""deleted scenes"" section. In most DVD's these are little bits of scenes, not worth really putting on a DVD. They remind me of someone showing everyone at the dinner table the tops of carrots and apple cores before setting down the Salad. Do we really need to see these? But I must say I was flabbergasted by the ""Deleted Scenes"" section of ""Pirate Radio"". The director does admit that there's a lot of stuff there, and that they are mostly ""self contained scenes"". And he also forlornly ponders if perhaps he had put these scenes in the film, and not taken them out, maybe the box office would have been better. He has a very good point there. Instead of showing table scraps, what you get is almost an entire hour of fully developed scenes, some ten minutes long or more. It is virtually like watching a whole new movie. And yes, the director is right. Most should have stayed in the movie. He says most were taken out because they didn't ""advance the plot"", but the plot is thin and predicable (not a bad thing, just that the plot in this movie is not sacrosanct!), and no one is going to see this movie for its political theme of repression of free speech. They want to see the ""Love Actually"" kind of camaraderie and colorful likable characters and all that great 1960's rock and roll. A few scenes obviously were okay left out (a long scene where the DJ's have to say ""dirty words"" is a good example of something that didn't really work), but other scenes (including an entire room filled with naked woman, I mean, that's box office!!!) are just wonderful. One, where the main legendary DJ talks about why he returned to the ship, after finding fame and fortune on the mainland, is heartwarming, almost ethereal, and explains a great deal about his character and why they all are on board. I'm tempted to have my son, who is a computer wiz (aren't they all?), cut these huge juicy chucks of deletions into the main movie, and then sit and watch it all together. Why there isn't a ""director's cut"" is astonishing. This movie is a nice diversion of colorful characters that you really will be happy to spend a few hours with.

The film more than just succeeds in capturing the emerging, rebellious spirit of the times and the rigid, social structure that viewed this 'new music' and accompanying lifestyle choices as such a threat to the fabric of existence. The prevailing mindset of both sides were well defined, quirky and humorous, yet telling at the same time.  Ah, the British do have a way with comedy, don't they?

What really set this film apart for me was the extraordinary, off-the-wall cast of characters floating about on the high seas while devoting themselves to delivering the rock and roll gospel to the masses on shore. It's definitely the antics, verbal rantings and altogether dysfunctional personalities of this insane group of DJ's and assorted rock junkies that make this film a memorable, thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience.",1276300800,4,1054,5.157894736842105

These generic conflicts and characters could have been transplanted into just about any era and pretty much any situation: these ""wacky,"" ""carefree,"" ""quirky"" ""freedom-loving"" ""nonconformists"" might just as well have been frat rats, Hollywood types, soldiers, or college kids on spring break--nothing but stereotypes distinguishes them or links them to the Sixties.

The humor makes me think that the film needn't have been retitled, except to add ""National Lampoon's"" before the title: it's that sort of sophomoric humor.
It's really a shame, because there's an pontentially great cast here. While some actors seemed like they had a great time, like Bill Nighy and Nick Frost, the roles of three actors I love and would normally trust (Kenneth Branagh, Rhys Ifans, and Philip Seymour Hoffman) should have been re-thought. . However, when the script basically stinks(and is incoherent to boot), what's a cast to do?(Not that I don't like low-brow humor- I own multiple versions of all the View Askew films, and both 'Zoolander' and 'Bubble Boy' are among my guilty pleasures, and South Park Studios has a shortcut on my desktop). I've been a Nick Frost fan since I first caught ""Spaced"" and ""Black Books"" in the UK, and possibly Frost's cohort Simon Pegg could have added something here. I actually didn't think of Pegg when I saw this in the theatre, but watching the DVD, he might possibly have added to this film.

After I first saw ""Pirate Radio"", I gave it 3 stars. Now, after watching the UK DVD of it, it's sinking slowly in the West, maybe 2.5, and now, it's firmly stuck at 2 stars.
I'd mercifully forgotten Curtis naming Jack Davenport's character Twatt, but in the extras, when he was being introduced to Ms Clitt(called Miss C in the credits) that was all she wrote. Pointless. Stupid. Dare I say it: American-style. That's not the type of humor I'd expect from Richard Curtis, it's more in the vein of Mike Myers' philosophy of hitting the viewer over the head to make sure they know how funny he is.
Late 1960's rock is the soundtrack of my life, so I couldn't fault the soundtrack, although there were quite a number of songs that were released WELL past the time the film was set, and some reasonably large screwups: This film is set in 1966(and makes a point of telling us that), Herb Alpert's 'This Guy' was a 1968 release, and worse yet, Cat Stevens' ""Father and Son""(the very last tune in the movie) came out in 1970. Curtis should have fired whoever was in charge of the soundtrack, but since he's made a point of telling us that he hand-picked the music, maybe his memory is a bit do-lally, coming from Down Under.
In the case of this film, it shrieks for a remake.",1274572800,2,4874,5.9742489270386265

Emma Thompson is just as cute and a believable actor as ever. I lived through the real era and enjoyed the music snippets.

I had also heard that the British version of this film was left more intact.  Good performances by reliable, seasoned actors help salvage the shredded story that appeared on the DVD.  The subject matter has always fascinated me, on several fronts--why, in 1966, when the British Invasion was well underway in the US , did the exporting country go into denial with regard to its commercial and creative impact?  And why did radio not force the issue without having to resort to piracy?  The movie doesn't pretend to go after the answers to those questions, but neglects its own characters and story in the process.  A little backstory as to how the DJs came to be on that boat, and who, really, was the man behind the Bill Nighy character?  I never felt like I knew anyone beyond their radio personnae.  Maybe that was the director's point, but I doubt it.  Everything was so sketched out, and the contrivance of the demise of the station was indicative of a desperate need to wrap things up.  After seeing all the deleted scenes on the DVD, I felt that most of them would have contributed to a more fleshed-out film.  So, why even three stars?  I give the actors full credit for hanging in there with the material they were given, and tend to think they were often asked to create scenes out of thin air.  I understand the movie was meant to have a light touch, but it should have left that job to the soundtrack and concentrated more on the people behind the music.",1272412800,,1589,4.552816901408451
3868564,2,B0027P94CQ,"No writer, director, actor or producer should ever be held responsible for the arrant nonsense that is written on the dust jackets of DVDs, but in this case the blurb does point to the fundamental problem with this movie.  According to the jewel-case text, Pirate Radio (aka The Boat That Rocked) is a ""rip-roaring comedy"" but in reality it is...well, um, er, ah...

Inspired by Radio Caroline, the pirate station that broadcast pop music to the UK from a boat anchored just outside British territorial waters in the mid-1960s, Pirate Radio is part homage, part well, um, er, ah... nothing very much, really.  Despite the presence of Bill Nighy, whose mannerisms usually save anything he happens to be in, this movie has very little humor and very little of anything. We follow the tedious lives of self-obsessed disc jockeys living on a boat that doesn't move. Not a very promising concept, and even though writer/director Richard Curtis is a past-master of spinning engrossing yarns we don't get past Go. There's the usual young-man-finding-himself-and-his-father routine (and very few people will be surprised by the ""surprise"" here) and there's the usual bonding-in-adversity schtick, but in general nothing very much happens and we don't have any real reason to care about the rather silly and shallow DJs who inhabit their own solipsistic universes. We care even less about the strikingly one-dimensional performance by Kenneth Branagh, who normally electrifies the screen in whatever role he occupies.

Pirate Radio feels like a movie that was endlessly re-written by a team of hacks and then filmed by a director who simply didn't care about the material at all. Yet this can't have been the case because Curtis wrote and directed and presumably has enough weight in the industry to ensure that at least the core of his movie is preserved. Perhaps there's a fascinating untold story about why this film is so boring, but it's of little consolation to imagine that the behind-the-scenes intrigue might be infinitely more interesting than the tedious tale that is laboriously unfolded over far too many minutes here.",1272326400,3,2122,5.106628242074928

More importantly, there's too much of a focus on ""Hey! It's the Sixties! Even nerdy guys are getting sex!"". So we end up with a flick that's more like Porky's than it should've been.

From the poster and build up with this writer, you'd be expecting a rousing English comedy complete with Bill Nighy, Nick Frost, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kenneth Branagh, and appearances by Emma Thompson and January Jones. What follows though is more of an amusing historical account stringing together events that may or may not have happened on this boat to these characters with clips of people around Britain listening on their radios to remind us that these people are actually broadcasting. It has its moments, but its just situations and how well they play off.

""Pirate Radio"" is an ensemble film about a group of DJs who have taken it up to the high seas to avoid the governments limitations on their music so they can broadcast pop and rock all day and night. The competing personalities participate in all sorts of hijinks and shenanigans that make us feel the bonding that occurs in any kids summer camp movie or group road trip. Regardless of how women or family members treat them, the music is always there to help pick them up when they fall.

Throughout the film, Branagh and Jack Davenport (the downer rule-stickler from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies) try to thwart the crew of pirates with legislation. Branagh's character gets to say many lines that sound so funny out of context. My favorite scene in the film is when the stiff characters get together, Branagh's family with Davenport and try to celebrate Christmas complete with paper hats and one noisemaker. It's like having a party in a library or funeral home. I found it odd that the funniest parts of the movie were spent with the stiff characters, not the rambunctious free to do anything folks.

What story wouldn't be complete without a coming of age tale with little Carl played by Tom Sturridge. He is sent away to the ship for bad behavior which is ironic but once there gets the urge to try and play Mamma Mia with the crew since he has grown up without a father. There is music, but not as fun a game. It's a good thing Nick Frost is around to keep the joint hopping. All he has to do is exchange a look with someone and I laugh. It did make me notice the lack of Simon Pegg in this film though, the two should really never be apart, it's a bit of a crime. I love them dearly in ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"".

3868577,2,B0027P94CQ,"You'd have difficulty making up such a great story as that of UK pirate radio in the 60s. There's virtually no pop or rock music being played on the radio at the same time as the music world is being turned upside down by a seemingly unstoppable flood of new, young and hugely popular, UK artists & groups... so, some clever entrepreneurs hire a couple of beat-up boats, anchor them off the coast outside of the reach of the law, fill them with a group of equally young, inexperienced DJs, start broadcasting 24 hours a day and, within a year, are being listened to all the time by just about everyone in the country under the age of 25 who can receive a signal. And, because they're mavericks working outside of the law, the DJs can push the boundaries out as far as they dare and play whatever they like; and, because they're so popular, these DJs not only rapidly become as famous & iconic as the artists they play but have a profound affect on the development of UK music in what's now seen as its ""golden age"". The boats are raided, the establishment wants them closed down, and their vast number of listeners see this as the most obvious evidence of an older generation plot to stop the youth revolution that's going on all around them. How quintessentially ""60s"" is all of that?

A great story then and one that's just waiting for someone to turn into a film... pity that it's Richard Curtis who sees its potential. Why? Well what he comes up with is simply not what it was like - it's just a convenient backdrop for another typically slick romantic comedy which, while entertaining and funny, is a great shame for the story of pirate radio is so good that it deserves more respect and, above all, at least some attempt to make it historically accurate.

For example, virtually all of the DJs were in their early 20s and none were over 30 - a pretty important fact as it was precisely because they were so young that they could relate to, be accepted by and influence their audience. In the film, every DJ with the exception of one - the man who doesn't speak (no pirate DJ didn't speak, they all talked incessantly) - is in their mid 30s or mid 40s, with the most ridiculously glaring error being the John Peel lookalike who's in his 50s (Peel, one of the oldest pirate radio DJs, was 27 in 1966) and who's portrayed as an old ""hippie"" when, in 1966, there were no old hippies... in fact there were very few young hippies.

And, as another reviewer points out, none of the DJs seem to have any interest in music and there's no discussion about music between them at any point in the film. You don't get yourself banged up in the ridiculously cramped and unpleasant environment of a pirate radio boat for weeks on end unless you're heavily into music and, if you are, you'd pass quite a lot of your time talking about it. Maybe the boatloads of dolly birds braving the waves to get under the blankets with their DJ heroes made it all worthwhile... er... no, see the You Tube interview about the film with Tony Blackburn (one of the most popular pirate DJs who was 21 at the time) on this one because nothing like that happened, on board at least.

Oh and then there's the sea itself... it's pretty damn cold in the North Sea in mid winter, so cold that you don't survive long in it. Not that this seems to bother our jolly bunch of middle-aged DJs who possess super-human endurance in these freezing waters as their ship starts to sink. Odd? Even odder actually because the pirate stations were outlawed in August 1967 not, as in the film, in mid winter 1966 - getting this date right would at least have made their ability to avoid instant hypothermia partially believable. Not good, and it gets worse, because there's also the man from the ministry, Mr Twatt... Mr Twatt in both name & nature unless you'd somehow missed the double-entendre... come on, dealing with the pirate radio stations was a very serious issue for the UK government precisely because any move to shut them down was going to be so hugely unpopular, not a job for an incompetent. And, of course and as you'd now expect, several of the records played hadn't actually been released in 1966. Hmm... there's a limit to how far you can get things so wrong in the relentless pursuit of entertainment and we've reached it.

Any redeeming features? Yes, one, the opening five minutes absolutely captures the impact of pirate radio - young, enthusiastic, incredibly exciting and ""dangerous"" - you won't get a better recreation of what it was like to be a UK teenager listening to the Kinks' wonderful ""All Day And All Of The Night"" blasting out from your transistor radio and to know that, just by tuning-in, you were joining millions of other teenagers in something that was very special - I know, I was one. The rest is history, but not as portrayed here... ah well.",1264291200,5,4839,4.506833712984054
3868578,5,B0027P94CQ,"I saw Pirate Radio in the theater in the states and The Boat that Rocks has so much more in it! Ten times better. More music, more dialogue - awesome. If you have a blu ray player, I would advise getting it, doesn't look like universal is going to release it in the states even as Pirate Radio at this point. Awesome movie and Music!",1261094400,3,333,4.138461538461539
3868579,4,B0027P94CQ,"Released in the US recently as Pirate Radio, the DVD and BD discs have already been released in other regions as The Boat That Rocked (UK, Oz), Good Morning England (Fr), and Radio Rock Revolution (De). When you see the number of outtakes on the DVD (45 min worth), and the love the director has for each one (by way of his introductions), you can understand why the film is long. Decisions, decisions. Some of the best stuff ended up on the cutting room floor, but its inclusion would not have moved the plot forward, he claims. (A long scene in which Rhys Ifans describes to young Carl why he returned to Radio Rock, set in a Mexican cantina, is particularly poignant.) All the disc jockeys in the film are very ""real"". Ralph Brown as Bob sort of reprises his role as Danny in Withnail and I. Philip Seymour Hoffman as The Count, the token American, is as irreverent as the rest. Tom Sturridge is perfect as the lost boy, a fatherless, virgin, 18-year old sent to the ship as punishment. Kenneth Branagh, as the civil servant wanting to sink the ship, is an old-school villain born many, many drinks short. But music is king here, and the tracks are sometimes chosen to reflect the names of characters in the film. Too long? Maybe, but I bet you watch each one of the outtakes once you start. Perhaps it should have been a miniseries!",1259798400,9,1336,4.479508196721311
3868580,5,B0027P94CQ,"I think this is the best (and funniest) movie by Richard Curtis since ""Four Weddings And A Funeral,"" and I've loved them all (Notting Hill, Love Actually, and so on).  Terrific cast of characters, nifty plot with surprising twists, nice cinematography (including well-done hand-held camera work, which emphasizes the rocking of the boat, but only noticeable at first, when young Carl first comes aboard), and a good bit of the best music of the era.  The ensemble acting is fabulous (like so much of British movies & TV), though I especially liked Bill Nighy's character.  Just a great experience.  I plan to see it again in the theater, and get the DVD when it comes out.",1259280000,10,672,4.767241379310345

3868582,5,B0027P94CQ,"Pirate Radio sports a stellar cast including
Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Tom Sturridge, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost, Emma Thompson (all too brief appearance)and Kenneth Branagh.  When rock and roll exploded in the UK, the government and radio stations banned play over the airways.  Rogue radio stations broadcast from ships offshore. Pirate Radio captures the exuberance and the bigger than life radio personalities that emerged with the new culture.  Rated R for profanity and sexual situations, this film is full of laughs and any weaknesses are compensated for with an awesome soundtrack.  Great way to spend an evening.",1258156800,37,627,5.36734693877551
3868583,5,B0027P94CQ,"In 1966, a mad mod monastery of mostly male crew with one token lesbian as cook sail the North Seas on a boat.  Their mission is to broadcast rock and roll to the UK 24/7.  They're led by Quentin (Bill Nighy) and The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an American DJ. Of course, their vows are drugs, sex (but only twice a month when a ship of girls comes on board) and rock and roll.

Sir Allister Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) doesn't like the broadcasts, which he sees as damaging the moral fiber of the UK's young and as a government member, he's set out to take the ship off the air.  As he says, ""If you don't like something, you simply make it illegal."" He and his faithful sidekick, Twatt (Jack Davenport) start their nefarious plans by trying to stop the station's advertisement, then when their signal allegedly interferes with a maritime distress signal, they work to make the channels illegal.

The music's the best of 60's rock from Dusty Springfield's 'white soul' to The Who.  The lines will have you roaring with laughter. The film's R rating is justified for language, drug use and some nudity.  I cannot say I have laughed so hard or enjoyed the music from a soundtrack so much in years.  This is one film I will be purchasing and watching every year or so when I need a good laugh.

3868584,5,B0027P94CQ,"The Boat That Rocked AKA Pirate Radio is set in 1966. When Great Britain was only playing rock and roll 45 minutes a day. There was a group of DJ's on a ship in the North Sea that's playing rock and roll 24 hours a day. Of course their are those who want this to end at any cost. This is also a coming of age movie for early rock and roll and young love.

I have no idea why this movie has been out since 2007 and no one has seen it. It is a quite long movie, but keeps your interest to the end. This is not a no name movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Kennith Branagh, Talulah Riley and many more.
Pirate Radio aka The Boat that Rocked must have one of the best soundtracks since A Hard Day's Night (1964). This is one movie you should not MISS.",1257638400,10,754,3.9281045751633985
