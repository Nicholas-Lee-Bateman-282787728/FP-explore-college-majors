Let's start with the CHEESEY music, which, under normal circumstances, would be in the BACKGROUND.  Instead it is so LOUD and OVERBEARING I cannot hear anything being said as far as the supposed instruction is concerned.  In addition, the first half-hour or so is some kind of infomercial for an online DJ mgt company, (I assume this to be the case, but as I stated before, I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING BUT THE CHEESEY MUSIC!!!!).  Don't waste your time on this product.  There is apparently no way to get a refund for money badly spent, so let my loss be a warning to you.  DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!!",1252800000,,684,4.565573770491803
