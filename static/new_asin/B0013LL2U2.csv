3116114,5,B0013LL2U2,"In reply to Fae'c comment, the revamping of the old ideas was INTENTIONAL. I remember these when they were originally on the air in the late 60's, a time when the original 39 black & white Honeymooners weren't in reruns yet (at least I don't believe they were). The reason I liked them then and now is because they did rehash some old skits and ideas that people like me never saw before. And granted the dancing and musical interludes could have been done without, it was considered a ""Variety"" show. So just sit back, forget the age of the characters, forget the rehashing of classic Honeymooner sketches and JUST ENJOY THEM.",1245196800,3,627,4.607142857142857
3116115,4,B0013LL2U2,"Having been a big fan of the original Honeymooners in black and white for many years, I was plesantly surprised to find that there was something called ""The Color Honeymooners"", with Jackie Gleason and Art Carney reprising their rolls at Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton.
The only thing I don't really like is the ""variety act"" parts, where they try to incorporate music and dance, as if to make the episodes longer. Also, these seem to be taking on some of the older ""ideas"" and elaborating storylines. Little is extremely new in the plots, but it is still fun to watch.",1240012800,,566,4.6138613861386135
3116116,4,B0013LL2U2,"MPI video continues its' release of the Honeymooners sketches from the Jackie Gleason Shows of the latter /60s. There are 12 eps in this release spanning from Sept. 9/67 to Oct. 26/68.
Each Honeymooners sketch is pure delight. Jackie Gleason and Art Carney and their ""new"" on-camera spouses Sheila Macrae(as Alice) and Jane Kean( as Trixie) continue to add to the fun and frivolity with their special talents,all filmed before a live audience in Miami Beach. These shows were aired nationally on Saturday nights but were shot the previous evening. This gave them time to tweak the show for any over-time,throw in extra camera shots where needed,etc,etc.
I only have one negative I think you should be made aware of. I was a little disturbed while watching the four eps on the first disc. All of them, to some degree or other,have videotape anomalies such as dirt and stationary crease lines running periodically throughout;much rougher looking than I've encountered on previous releases. The rest of the eps on the other discs(coincidentally or not) are fine and have few such visible problems and are in keeping with the standards of the previous set releases. An FYI.
These Honeymonners,like those released before, are all musical in nature. So every ep here contains four to five musical numbers performed throughout by various cast members,generally with one or more singing partners. The music is brilliantly written by Lyn Duddy and Jerry Bressler and with great backing by Sammy Spear and his Orchestra ,it was a match made in musical heaven. Also there to dazzle you are the wonderful June Taylor dancers. I appreciate the work of June and her talented troupe even more now than I did back in the 60s when I first saw these shows in their entirety. The work,precision and professionalism from these guys and gals is astounding. Look closely and see if you can spot June herself dancing with her team!
Along with the belly laughs supplied in spades by the cast you will notice in these shows,more than the previous ones,several gaffs and some ad-libs;especially from Gleason and Carney. Being the pros they are they recover quickly but it's precious to catch these quick little faux pauxs. And speaking of precious moments,keep an eye out at the end of an ep on the first disc where Jackie introduces the cast. When the first person called,Jane Kean,comes out she rushes head long at Jackie holding his ""coffee"" cup. She bumps him a little harder than he expects and a bit of the contents of the cup spills. Jackie gives her a sly glance and shake of his head as she leaves,smiles at the audience and sips the spillings from the saucer. It's a pure Gleason moment,not to be missed.
As a brief little aside,the only regrets I've ever had about these releases from MPI are that the ENTIRE shows themselves have not been released. Like the shows that the so called ""Lost Episodes"" were culled from,the entire shows still exist for these releases also. However I realize this is not so much the fault of MPI as it's what the Gleason estate will allow for release;on DVD and in syndication. It's just that the only things missing from THESE releases,for the most part,are a precious five-ten minutes of opening show intros and dialogue from Jackie. When all things are considered however,I suppose we should be grateful for what we do get. But I can dream,can't I?
In conclusion Gleason,Carney,Kean and Macrae are all back and as funny as ever in the continuing releases from MPI of the colour Honeymooner sketches culled from the Jackie Gleason Show of the late 1960s. Be aware of the first disc whose eps are at times not quite up to the standards set by the others after them(in the set) and the previous releases. As usual the dancing,the music and the humour is all top notch containing the typical Gleason/Honeymooners spirit we all know and love.
By the way,watch out for some well known actors you might recall who come by in support of the cast. Who? You'll have to watch to find out!",1219017600,12,3995,4.799709724238026

8251747,4,B0013LL2U2,"Oh, man......how can I review this stuff? I absolutely LOVE Gleason's ""Honeymooners."" This is unlike the ""39"" in that they are musical productions. It WORKS!!!

This is one of those things that you need to see to believe. Sounds stupid, right? It's NOT!!!

The laughs are all there. Seriously. They are ALL there. Then there's the music. Amazingly, it works!

You gotta see it to believe it. I know that I saw these as a kid. I remember nothing. These days, it it amazing!

The DVD quality is good to very good. I've blown it up to a home theater screen and it still looks good. My guess is that they did the best they could with the source material.

8251749,4,B0013LL2U2,"As a teenager, I remember seeing the Trip Around the World (Collection 1), on WGN-TV, in Chicago. Those we're so much fun, but I had forgotten that there were others. I loved watching the foursome from Chauncey Street, through highs & lows. ""Get rich, quick"" schemes, Raccoon Lodge meetings, promotions from mere bus driver to Traffic Manager...I loved each and every musical note of these filmed LIVE, in the ""Sun & Fun Capitol of the World, Miami Beach"".",1361664000,,456,4.858974358974359
8251750,5,B0013LL2U2,"I have long been a fan of the older Honeymooner's episodes, and these newer versions that aired in the 1960's are a little different.  With a dance number at the beginning of each episode and singing by Ralph, Ed, Alice, and Trixie, it takes a little different tone.  Episodes are one hour, and some are drawn out a bit.

As funny as the old Honeymooners were, not ALL episodes were equally as funny.  This is true here. A few episodes are right up there with the funniest, like when Ralph is an exact double for a big shot gangster who is slated to be hit.  Ralph and Ed carry the show more so than in the earlier version; this Alice is more pleasant and loving, and Trixie a bit more assertive, but they are both EXCELLENT, just different. The scripts, the acting, the faces, and even many of the extra actors are the same as the older version. Even the sewer jokes are as good.  Norton is Norton and Ralph is Ralph, in every sense of the word.

I began with ""Collection 3,"" but I intend to buy the entire set a season at a time. Just allow room for a little difference and I think you will be as pleased as I am.",1301875200,5,1115,4.182242990654205
