8228714,3,B000IQUROA,"I found this DVD to be very general and simple. But while watching the whole video I kept hoping Leslie would show us how she did her own make-up. In the end, the women all looked lovely and natural, but Leslie looked exotic with these really gorgeous smokey eyes. This video is purely base mineral foundation and basic highlighting followed up by make-up setting with Mineral Veil powder. In the future, I would love a follow up DVD for their other products which shows the eye shadows, eye brow kit, lipsticks and blushes from BareMinerals wonderful line.",1256601600,4,557,4.752577319587629
