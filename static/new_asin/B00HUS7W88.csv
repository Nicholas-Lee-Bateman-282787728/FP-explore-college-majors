6226373,5,B00HUS7W88,"After Sofia helps a little mermaid, Oona, Sofia's amulet grants her power to become a mermaid and visit her new friend's secret undersea kingdom. But Cedric, disguised as a sea monster, plots to steal Oona's magic mermaid comb, and danger comes. Princess Ariel, The Little Mermaid, comes to help and she and Sofia go to rescue Oona, and prevent a typhoon.  My toddlers and I  love this movie.  It has fun songs and more episodes.  All the stories teach that when families and friends work together, they can weather  any storm and save the day.
I love Princess Ariel from The Little Mermaid, and she guest stars in Sofia the First, The Floating Palace.",1397692800,4,652,4.684210526315789
6226374,4,B00HUS7W88,"This is the third collection of episodes from the Disney Junior TV series. First was Once Upon a Princess (with Cinderella), second was Learning to Be a Princess (with Jasmine) and now The Floating Palace features an appearance by Ariel (voiced and sung by the wonderful Jodi Benson).

There are two kinds of Disney Junior series, educational (of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse variety that encourage participation) and more story-driven ones like Sofia the First. I tend to prefer the latter, more linear plotting. Sofia is a fine example, with some fine songs by John Kavanaugh, too.

The Floating Palace (Season 1, Episode 22) 49 minutes
Original Air Date: November 24, 2013
This is a double-length show in which Sofia (voiced by Modern Family's Ariel Winter) becomes a mermaid and and Cedric (Jess Harnell) tries to steal a magic comb from Oona (Mad Men's Keirnan Shipka). Very much at the high quality of a direct-to-video Disney movie.
Song: ""Here in Merway Cove,"" a big band/""Under the Sea""-type production number, sung by Benson and the Cast and ""The Love We Share.""

Tri-Kingdom Picnic (Season 1, Episode 10)
May 17, 2013
At annual games, a friendly competition between three kingdoms,  James (Zach Callison) learns how to be a good winner and a good loser.
Song: The Picnic of the Year"" Sung by the Cast

Finding Clover (Season 1, Episode 13) 23 minutes
June 28, 2013
Thinking Sofia no longer needs him, Clover fills in as a magician's rabbit.
Song: ""Why Did I Go?"" Sung by Brady and Winter.

Make Way for Miss Nettle (Season 1, Episode 16) 23 minutes
August 23, 2013
A garden fairy (Megan Mulally) schemes to steal the magic book from Flora, Fauna and Merryweather.
Song: ""Make Way for Miss Nettle"" Sung by Mulally.

As a bonus gift, this DVD package comes with two knitted bracelets with images of the sea woven into the design.",1397606400,50,1836,4.809523809523809
6226375,5,B00HUS7W88,"My youngest has become a BIG Sophia fan. She gets so excited wne any new episode comes on, and though she had seen this episode before, she wanted us to have it at home so that she could watch it when she wanted! This episode was a ton of fun and you got to see Sophia in a totally new way (as a mermaid!). My youngest also thought it was cool that Ariel was in this, especially because we had just seen her last week while we were at Walt Disney World. If you have never seen this episode or any episode of this series you should, as they are truly family friendly and ones that you can enjoy with your whole family.

The extra episodes are nice change too for a short video when I make dinner or catch up on something around the house.  The extra episodes are Miss Nettle, Finding Clover and Tri-Kingdom picnic.

8636090,3,B00HUS7W88,"In the dystopian dictatorship of Enchantia the noble families live lives of leisure sitting in floating palaces or traveling in flying coaches to their magically catered picnics while the peasants live lives of hunger and desperation.  Raised by a quirk of fate from the peasantry to the nobility Sofia tries to come to terms with her new status.  Learning which fork to use to or how to curtsy rather than starving in the streets or dying of the plague.  In this DVD she visits mermaids (with the help of her magical amulet), attends a magical picnic, makes up with her rabbit friend and finally prevents a revolutionary from overturning the established order Sofia benefits from.

Sorry.  Disney (R) brings out the Marxist in me.

So yeah.  This is exactly what is says on the tin: Princesses, parties, magic, wealth and privilege.  Our girls love it, I find it... tolerable.  There's not much to entertain an grown up here, it's just raw sugar for toddlers.",1492992000,,960,4.804878048780488
