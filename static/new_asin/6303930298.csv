730400,1,6303930298,"From the description of this video and the customer reviews, I couldn't tell this tape was mainly aerobics. Most of the moves were really fast combo moves, I have a really hard time following this type of workout. From now on, I'm going to stick with Pilates and Yoga type workouts and weight training.",1023148800,12,302,4.611111111111111
730401,5,6303930298,"I have been using this tape for about a year, and find that it is the most effective one in my collection.  Combined with aerobic exercise, this tape will greatly reduce your backside (when used consistantly).  The instructor is fabulous and the workout is quick.  Totally worth the price.",983145600,9,289,4.857142857142857

7855584,5,6303930298,I loved created this workout! Enjoy Janis Saffell,1395446400,,49,5.25
7855585,5,6303930298,Started using this video a few years after her series (10 Minute Buns).  It's a great workout and no equipment necessary.  These woman are absolutely gorgeous! Crunch fitness is well-known for creating challenging and fun exercise routines.  This I would say is definitely an advanced exercise program. I suggest you use her (10 minute Buns) video for at least 6 - 8 weeks first.  Have fun!,1362700800,,390,4.863636363636363
7855586,5,6303930298,"Superb workout and great for the entire body. As you can tell from the ladies in the video. Especially the beautiful tanned brunette in the pink leotard. ""I feel it already"" she said, so do I.",1321056000,,192,4.361111111111111
7855587,5,6303930298,"Ok so I did this video one time this past summer in an attempt to get back in shape. One things a lil irritating is the soundtrack of this video. Why the women behind the trainer was going ""whoo, yeah"" really loud I don't know lol and then it's like they really wasn't saying that cause they mouths wasn't going with what you hear! lol ok so trying to stay focused I followed along and it really hurt but hey I haven't worked out in a while so. I would recommend this to get your butt back, you know, you have to keep doing this in order to see some type of results.",1318118400,,566,4.017699115044247
7855588,5,6303930298,"Don't listen to the comments claiming this is an aerobic video.

Like almost all toning videos, it does begin with a light aerobic warm-up, but it's not complicated and it's over with quickly. The rest of the video is standing glute work, such as squats and lunges, followed by mat work. I love Janis Saffell, she is upbeat and a little perky but not at all annoying.

The mat work was really excellent. It contains a lot of exercises I've never seen that you can really feel in the back of your hips. This is definitely one of the better butt workouts out there. I own about 40 exercise videos, and this is the one I always look forward to doing.

And it's not aerobics!",1186876800,,671,4.352
7855589,5,6303930298,"i've been doing this video since '93, and have not found a better one since.  i came online to find it in dvd format.  tragically i didn't find it. this is a no nonsense, right to the point 30 min video that if done regularly 3-4/week produces amazing results. i don't like alot of silly dance steps - i like to get my workout in fast. it really takes so little time but targets and isolates the muscle group so well that it really works.  this video is why i still have a vhs player!!! thanks to this video i can wear a tiny bikini on the beach and look great.",1159315200,,561,4.036036036036036
