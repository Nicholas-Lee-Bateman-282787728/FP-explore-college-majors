8522974,1,B007XOHY0A,"Review of One More Mountain
Hot Toasty Rag, July 25, 2017

One More Mountain is a biopic about the Donner party. Yes, you read that correctly. Why anyone would choose to make a movie about them, Ill never know. In any case, the film focuses on the Reed family, rather than the Donners, who were involved in the famous trek to California. Meredith Baxter and Chris Cooper play Margaret and James Reed, who travel from Chicago to California in a covered wagon. They were wealthy and prosperous in Chicago, so there was no reason for the journey in the first place, but off they went, with four children and a sick grandmother in tow. Believe it or not, the movie is far from graphic. Children could see it, although I have no idea why theyd want to. The most upsetting and dramatic scene is when they're forced to lighten their load because the horses are getting tired. Chris Cooper takes his wifes precious China and throws it out of the wagon. Oh no!

Anyway, this is a very cheesy tv movie about a very unpopular family. I cant really think of any reason why anyone would watch it, unless they're related to a cast member and need to be supportive.",1500940800,2,1150,4.4714285714285715

8522978,1,B007XOHY0A,"This movie was the epitome of a man full of himself, who was responsible for the deaths of 39 people for his misdeeds and foolish pride, not to mention he almost lost his whole family. Then it ends with him becoming a leading citizen in San Jose! He should have been horsewhipped and put in jail for his crimes. The wife was the heroin in this picture and the only reason the family survived. I can""t imagine any man doing this to his family and bringing such a fowl punishment on them and others with his cruel self conceit. Terrible! The only reason to watch this movie is to witness how low a man can go in being deceived and deceiving others.",1471996800,2,646,4.30327868852459

8522981,5,B007XOHY0A,This was a made-for-TV movie from the late 90's about the Donner Party.  It is great for teaching westward expansion and the Oregon Trail.,1425513600,4,138,4.75
