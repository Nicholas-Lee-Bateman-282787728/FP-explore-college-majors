7351969,4,B012HOEK16,"If you are looking for something different that not too many people are familiar with yet, check this one out. It starts with a pretty far-fetched concept involving a man who is afraid his girlfriend is falling out of love with him. The man meets a stranger in a bar who convinces him to take part in a scenario whereby the stranger attempts to kidnap the woman and the boyfriend comes to her rescue, thus reinforcing her love for him. What the man doesn't take into account is the stranger's ulterior motives. What the stranger doesn't take into account is the resourcefulness of the woman. There is some nasty brutality in this, which some people will find off-putting. It is filmed in black-and-white and subtitled, which might also be a turn-off for some people. The closest thing I can think of to compare it to (although it's nothing like it, really) is BLUE VELVET. If you like your films weird and violent, this one is worth a look.",1476921600,3,940,4.601190476190476

7351971,5,B012HOEK16,"Im always prepared these days -- these years -- to be disappointed in one way or another with new films I come across on Amazon or Netflix.  If not right away or by mid-film, most movies I stick with to the end frequently unravel or disintegrate due to a variety of issues, and I am left having to give the movie a tepid thumbs-up or sideways, for having sent me on another thorny garden path to nowhere.

True Love Ways (German/French with English subtitles) is the first movie in the last 20 or so I watched where neither the beginning, middle, nor end did not in some way let me down.  The first 15-20 minutes were devoted mostly to story development, but the strength of Anna Hausburgs performance as Severine held my rapt attention even there while little else was happening.  And the rest of the movie was as spellbinding as any I have seen in a long time.

I tend to react most viscerally to actors that a) Im not already familiar with and therefore do not fit any possible preconceptions of mine, and b) actors I relate to personally, either from prior performances, or their actions and persona in the current movie.  So personally, I do not get that much enjoyment watching the newest Meryl Streep or Brad Pitt or Jennifer Lawrence vehicles  thats just me  but Im always on the lookout for the next indie gem that may come around featuring actors new and fascinating to me.  Foreign movies can be a great plus in this regard, expanding ones cinematic vistas almost infinitely.  And when you cast the net wide enough, you get lucky.  You find gems like True Love Ways.

Endings are important for me  where a story leaves you when all is said and done.  Style **can** be important, but only when it is appropriately subservient to the story.  And there must be at least some redeemable quality to the character I am watching, else why watch?  In all these respects, True Love Ways did not let me down, and left me with that rare feeling of having experienced something close to a perfect cinematic experience.

Reviewers here have cited several directors and styles they see influences of in this film; for me, its an homage to Hitchcock through and through, composed in elegant and atmospheric black and white, gradually building in intensity to certain doom  a film that would have fit nicely astride 1950s-era Hitchcock classics like North By Northwest and Vertigo.  Anna Hausburg as Severine bears an alluring resemblance to a young Julie Christie, and she is every bit as vogue as Grace Kelly or Kim Novak in her role, a wild mix of the childish and animalistic survival instinct.

I think to label True Love Ways as a horror movie is a bit off the mark; there is a good deal of requisite hacking and slashing which is simply required by the story and by character motivations, and not due to any insane psychos running amuck.  As the movie is filmed in black and white, its gore does not stand out and is never (almost never) lingered on, while the actions leading up to bloodshed are fairly rational, much more than, say, Tony Perkins in Psycho.  Still, tread carefully where stomachs are weak.

It really doesnt matter, though.  You could call it Hitchcock, or Hitchcock-Not, or German Dream Horror, or Freaky Deaky Eurotrash.  It doesnt matter, because whatever it is, they still know how to make movies like this, and thats a win for movie lovers.  Long live cinema.

7351974,4,B012HOEK16,"Severine (Anna Hausburg) is moody and has weird dreams. She wants some ""me"" time away from her boyfriend Tom (Kai Michael Mller). Tom goes to the bar and laments his woes to any stranger who will listen and one does. He will kidnap Severine and Tom will rescue her. When her car runs out of gas, this puts a kink into the plan and midpoint plot spoiler...the guys make rape/snuff films and need a pretty female lead for a role of a lifetime. Severine uses the hatchet she is pictured with on the cover to do some editing.

The film is cultish, filmed in black and white, steeped with odd scenes, I thought I was watching  Ingmar Berman making a film combining ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""The Story of O"" a German version of acid horror. I wish they had colorized the red blood, like on the DVD cover. I don't know why I gave the film 4 stars anymore than if I had given it 1 star. I am still trying to work the scenes out in my head. It could be genius or just crap.

7351975,3,B012HOEK16,"First part I dozed off. Then I fast forwarded and it was still slow. Yeah, I get it. Dreams of an unhappy woman, turns bizzare. Basically, I've had root canals that were more fun and took less time  than this movie. The best part was Buddy Holly's song ""True Love Ways"".  Art House or not, sorry, but this stuff is too Foreign and weird for me. Gave it three stars because I like Buddy Holly.",1480204800,2,392,4.213333333333333
7351976,5,B012HOEK16,This film plays like a grindhouse slasher seen through an arthouse lens. The artificial black and white creates a dreamlike motif that makes the bloodshed feel somehow more charged--more harrowing. It's Franois Truffaut meets Eli Roth meets Hitchcock. It's the kind of movie you can play for friends who think they're too sophisticated for horror.,1479686400,,347,5.327272727272727

7351979,5,B012HOEK16,"Loved this movie!  Definitely 'Indie,' so if you don't appreciate that type of movie you probably won't like it.  It does have some rather typical woman-in-peril horror movie things going on, including men with hokey acting chasing her (although, this may have been intentional because it was So over the top bad), but otherwise it's great.  Don't end the movie when you first think it's over...it goes on a bit more.  That's what makes the movie so great!!",1477180800,4,457,4.82051282051282

8726189,4,B012HOEK16,"At first, I was going to quit watching this movie because I did not think it would be a good film. I kept watching because it gave off the aura that it was something like Alfred Hitchcock would probably have directed so of course I oddly felt compelled to see where the plot would lead after I had that thought. I particularly liked the fact that the movie was filmed in black and white because I believe that added to the overall disturbing feel of the movie. I also believe that the main actress, Anna Hausburg, was utterly captivating to say the least and in my opinion she did an excellent job portraying her character.

All in all, this turned out to be a very intriguing movie with a rich quality of classic suspense. I unexpectedly enjoyed this movie a lot because it was different than the typical, watered-down, run-of-the-mill type movies that are normally produced these days. Mathieu Seiler really conjured up some sort of cinematography voodoo because I love the way he directed this film.",1509062400,,1002,4.661016949152542

8726192,4,B012HOEK16,"Snuff movies get the art house treatment, and it's almost masterful - as long as you don't expect 'I spit on your grave'. Not that it's lacking in gore, but the movie is consciously made to look and feel like maybe a 60s French noir movie, or even a silent movie (particularly in the over the top coincidences, and some extreme close-ups), and will disappoint if you're in only for the kill(s).

Shot in beautiful black and white, and set to a very effective score (often haunting and scary), the movie tells the story of a very troubled woman, of a crew of snuff film-makers, and also of how dreams can sometimes almost come true. There's an obvious other story in the background, indicated by increasingly frequent references and flashbacks, and it all comes together in the end.

I found myself rather mesmerized watching the movie...when I wasn't terribly annoyed by the endless sequence of idiotic occurrences which drive the action. To give an example, the girl flees successfully into the woods. The next day, she finds a well...and as soon as she does, one of the pursuers does as well (in the middle of the friggin' woods, on the next day!), his camera still in hand. I am fairly certain that the director/writer of the movie meant to create a dreamlike feel to it (dreams play a big part), and dreams are not logical; but it bugged me terribly. At times, the strange happenings actually work, and some of these moments are rather beautiful.

So be warned, or be attracted. It's very high-brow, if only as evidenced by several literary references (most notably in re-enacting the most famous moment of Wilde's/Strauss' 'Salome'). If you're like me, you'll fast forward some moments when something happens that is so not credible. But then the movie's last about 10 minutes simply took my breath.",1500595200,,1804,4.7756410256410255
