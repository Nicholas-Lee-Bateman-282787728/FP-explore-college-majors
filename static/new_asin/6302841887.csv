7832337,2,6302841887,"Billy Drago and Lance Henriksen are two of my absolute favorite actors. When I discovered that they'd been in a movie together, I made it my mission to own it.
Once I'd seen it, I felt let down. They share about two scenes together, and everything else about this movie is so boring, I just wanted to cry.
Billy and Lance are great, with what they have. Everyone else in the cast needs to stop making movies altogether.",1299456000,,419,4.384615384615385
7832338,4,6302841887,"This movie must represent what foreigners think American gangsters behaved like in the 1930s. Every actor plays to the rafters and surely had fun making this film. B-movie great Billy Drago (The Takeover) plays his cool, perfected, villain persona as Lucky Luciano. Think a hoarse Frank Black (Millennium) on drugs for Lance Henriksen (Stone Cold) as the tommmy-gun blasting Dutch Schultz. Martin Kove is the cigar-smoking G-Man who keeps it cool. But the real actor that will keep you rolling your eyes is hero FBI Agent Bone Conn played by John Christian. This movie has all the standard gatuitious sex scenes and violence but you just can't help thinking the actors must have had a blast making this. If you are into collecting certain B-movie actors or follow their work, it's a must have. It's also a fun bad movie to watch.",1000339200,3,829,4.845070422535211
