8151746,1,B000JLSYY4,"My son already counts and recognizes numbers. But I bought this for a plane trip, thinking it would be entertaining, and it was the worst purchase I've made from Amazon.  It's probably the most boring counting DVD out there.  It says for ages 2 and up but if your child is a typical active 2 yr old, this will bore him/her to tears.  It's very repetitive with boring graphics and sound.  Don't be fooled by the description, it is not interactive at all.  My 2.5 yo really likes the Richard Scarry Counting video.  Old, but well done and much more effective in actually teaching counting.",1182816000,,587,4.542857142857143
