As the shootout series goes, I like this DVD and would buy it agian. The only thing I didn't like was that it left out the second part of the battle. After it details the wounding of Lcpl Texadore it mentions the battle continues but doesn't follow it, leaving the viewer to wonder what specifically happened.

That said though, it's truly humbling to see the dedication, love, and fellowship these Marines have for each other. I think history channel could have done a much better job in recounting their story than they did, but it still comes across that they'd do anything for each other.

There needs to be a better way of telling of their exploits, for I think that the main problem is trying to stuff too much into a 90 minute segment.

However, more than enything else, we need more men like these U.S. Marines...",1252368000,2,887,4.559748427672956
