5410306,5,B00AEC68BO,"After seeing this once I had to own it. Bo was such an athlete. He was and still is a Role Model. He deserve to be in the BASEBALL hall of fame not only for standing firm but he was and still is a gentleman.

Some of these so called superstars today need to watch this and learn from BO on how to be a role model. There never will be another athlete like BO.",1368835200,5,358,3.7733333333333334

5410309,5,B00AEC68BO,"There are star athletes then there's Bo Jackson. This video is a testament to one of the
greatest athletes that has ever lived and a great and humble human being.
This documentary  was very well done with lots of interviews with people  who were
directly involved in Bo's life. I've watched it several times and look forward to
watching it again and again. Highly recommend it to anyone impressed with
extraordinary abilities in a sports athlete.",1364169600,9,446,4.855263157894737

3/13: Recently, ESPN did a tournament to find out who is the greatest athlete ever. Looking at the names in the brackets, I just knew that Bo Jackson was that. Only that I wasn't sure if he would be beaten out by Michael Jordan through favoritism. I was surprised and shocked that Bo Jackson had beaten Michael Jordan for the title, so I knew he was a shoo-in to win it.

That's how good Bo Jackson was, and I had seen him play football and baseball. In fact, I saw the All-Star game when he hit the lead-off home run. I had seen him run a for touchdown in a football game, where nobody could catch him. I saw the highlights of him which were daily occurrences on Sportscenter. His Nike commercials were famous and memorable. ""Bo Knows"" was the rage of the country. And I had the Beckett magazine of him in black and white.

Of course, I would tell stories about the famous NES game called Tecmo Bowl and what was so special about it. I knew that he never lifted weights, and I knew he never needed to take steroids. He was the last superstar next to Deion Sanders to play baseball and football professionally, and he was that good in both sports. There will never be a Bo Jackson again.

Watching ESPN Films: You Don't Know Bo relived the moments for me. I still remember him breaking a baseball bat over his knee to this day. So many times, I had really questioned it because I wasn't sure of my memory serving me right.

All in all, Bo Jackson was the greatest athlete ever played.",1363478400,16,1508,4.3144876325088335
5410311,5,B00AEC68BO,I saw this on ESPN and I had to have it to share with some friends.  Bo was incredible on the field. Thanks for sending it so quickly and having it in great condition.,1361750400,4,167,3.911764705882353
5410312,5,B00AEC68BO,"This outstanding documentary on Bo Jackson by ESPN, brought back tons of memories for this retired faculty member at Auburn University [1976-2010]. From 2000 to 2010, I was the 'Archivist' for the 'AU Athletic Department's Lovelace Museum and Hall of Honor'. One of our top attractions was a large screened diorama of Bo Jackson, with a lighted and narrated video of Bo, in his Freshman year, going 'Over The Top' to score the winning touchdown against Alabama in 1982. We updated the video as Bo's unbelievable professional career, and groundbreaking Nike commercials boom hit, both of which were very well covered by this documentary.

ESPN's '30 for 30's program 'You Don't Know Bo' brought back a lot of emotions, all of them good. Beyond Bo's Auburn years (1982-1985/Heisman year); his two sport [baseball & football hobby] exploits, brought me back to a great time of our family's and sports nation's lives.  I can't wait for this DVD to be released!

I hope that the TV Awards show honors this fantastic documentary, on a very excellent athlete; Vincent 'Bo' Jackson.",1356393600,12,1074,4.988826815642458

5410317,5,B00AEC68BO,"When you watch this, you will be speechless or find yourself muttering ""Wow.""  The whole documentary seems almost fantasy because it could not be real, right.  A person should not be able to do what he did (for such a small period of time).  I do know that, if you are a sports fan, you will enjoy this.  In all interviews, I have seen of him, Bo Jackson is a humble, superstar.  Some say that he is the greatest athlete in our lifetime.  It is hard to refute this.  This short documentary is a glimpse of his life.  Wow!",1454198400,,521,4.191919191919192

5410319,5,B00AEC68BO,"I am old enough to remember Bo Jackson playing. I was a kid, & knew he was awesome...but watching this with the commentary of the Hall of Famers that played WITH him, it makes me appreciate his feats that much more. Bo Jackson led what amounts to an anectdotal footnote of a career in MLB & NFL history. This documentary can be summed up in Howie Long's statement:  God just reached down and touches a guy like that and says, YOURE going be great; YOURE going to make GREAT athletes look average.

""All you could do was imagine how good he could've been if it had continued.""

If you're a football and/or baseball fan...OR you just enjoy documentaries about incredible athletes, this is a MUST watch. It's quite possibly the BEST of the 30 for 30 series!",1451865600,,754,4.489051094890511

He went on what he thought was an approved trip to Tampa and was told he had lost his college eligibility to play baseball. He chose baseball and was drafted by the Royals. His amazing feats are chronicled and his play in the NFL as a 'hobby'. Commercials, video game, and a cartoon.
