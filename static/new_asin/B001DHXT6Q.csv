3530980,3,B001DHXT6Q,"I believe as with most things, it is just plain hard to continue to please audiences.  The earlier Spongebobs were hysterical because they were something different and outrageous.  Season 5 is very funny, but it just lacks the wackiness of the earlier seasons.  This could be contributed to my age difference after 5 seasons of watching Spongebob, and I am sure kids will enjoy it regardless.  The quality of the animation is still top notch, the packaging is fantastic and everything is still quality stuff.

Season 5 Volume 2 contains ""21 tales of deep sea silliness"" plus 5 Karaoke music videos as a bonus.

Karaoke Music videos
1. Bubble Song
2. Good-Bye Atlantis
3. Dead Eye
4. Together
5. If I could talk to money

Get this to complete your Spongebob collection, but if you are starting out, go with Season 2 as I felt that was the funniest.",1226880000,12,847,4.644295302013423

* Atlantis Squarepantis- idea= good. execution= bad. 5/10
* Picture Day- nice antics with SpongeBob's psyche. 7/10
* A Flea in Her Dome- flies infesting Sandy's treedome. Doesn't that just sound bad? 4.5/10
* MermaidMan vs. SpongeBob- Plankton pitting MermaidMan and BarnacleBoy against SpongeBob. Doesn't that also just sound bad? 4.5/10
* Le Big Switch- I actually enjoyed this one a bit, although a bit similar to an episode from earlier in season 5, ""The Original Fry Cook."" 6/10
* The Donut of Shame- this has been done before so many times in so many different ways. 4.9/10
* Blackjack- I love how SpongeBob's parents are scared of Blackjack! 6.8/10
* Blackened Sponge- SpongeBob makes up a story about getting in a fight. Bad idea. 6/10
* Pest of the West- annoying accents, but good story. 7/10
* The Krusty Plate- a whole episode centered on SpongeBob trying to get a spot off of a plate? Bad idea. 4/10
* Pat No Pay- been there, done that. 4/10
* The Inmates of Summer- SpongeBob and Patrick think they're going to a summer camp, but they're going on a prisoner ship. Awesomeness! 7.5/10
* To Save a Squirrel- annoying. 5.8/10
* 20,000 Patties Under the Sea- annoying. 6.9/10
* The Battle of Bikini Bottom- too much disgusting humor. 4.9/10
* What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?- based off of a book that was far better. 2.5/10
* Goo Goo Gas- great lines. 5/10
* The Two Faces of Squidward- good story, but SpongeBob is very annoying. 5/10
* SpongeHenge- the wind whistles through SpongeBob's pores making music. Horrible. 3/10
* Banned in Bikini Bottom- good idea, but the ladies are horribly unfunny. I like the idea of the ""speakeasy"" in SpongeBob's house. 4/10
* Stanley S. SquarePants- Stanley is SpongeBob's cousin who can do nothing right. 5.5/10",1296691200,4,1923,4.792168674698795

3531109,5,B001DHXT6Q,"I currently own all of the Spongebob Squarepants seasons on DVD (1-5). My daughters love every single one of the episodes and my husband and I don't mind watching them either. There is not one negative thing I can say about this product or anyone of the seasons of Spongebob. Great picture and sound. Every episode is included in the seasons, even the specials. We love it and to be honest would be a little lost with out it, because at least 2 times every day im being begged to put Spongebob on lol.",1234915200,8,501,4.340425531914893
3531110,4,B001DHXT6Q,"Ok, a lot of people say that Spongebob is leaning towards rock bottom, but I don't believe them.  In fact, I like the new episodes better than the old ones.  I mean, don't get me wrong, the old episodes were okay, but they were kind of boring.  Thanks to the recent episodes, Spongebob is now my #1 favorite television show.  Sure, Patrick and Spongebob's IQs have dropped, but that's okay.  Many characters change over time.  Spongebob's voice is higher-pitched and he looks cuter than he did back in the old episodes.  The reason why Squidward is more frustrated now is because Spongebob pesters him more than he did back in the old episodes.  But in the new episodes, Squidward reveals his true artistic side.  Plankton still plans evil schemes, though Sandy has become a scientific genius, which is fine by me because I happen to love science myself.  Mr. Krabs is just as cheap as he was back in the old episodes because I remember the episode, ""Pickles"" in  season 1 where Mr. Krabs was begging Bubble Bass, Spongebob's former enemy, not to make him pay 2 bucks and in the episode, ""Born Again Krabs"" in early season 3, he told a customer to hand over the penny he found on the floor or his arm comes off.  My favorite episode so far is ""Boating Buddies""; it is hilarious!  Lol.  As for Patrick, I never really liked him in the first place.",1230940800,,1346,4.508264462809917
3531111,3,B001DHXT6Q,"I'm trying to figure out why I am not enjoying SpongeBob seasons like I used to. There are still incredibly funny lines and the characters are still great. The storylines are getting more and more predictable; for example, SpongeBob and Patrick enjoy things most find torturous to the bafflement of others, Patrick's slow mind taking days to form a thought, and SB is seen as destructive even though he has all the best intentions. What I think this particular volume needs is more Squidward. The Squidward-featured episodes are some of my favorites, and this volume has only one (""The Two Faces Of Squidward""). Sure, he's in other episodes making sarcastic quips here and there and has a larger role, as with the others, in ""Atlantis Squarepantis,"" but he is mainly a background character seen in one or two scenes. In the last episode, for example, he takes one look at Stanley, runs in his house, grabs his stuff, hops in a moving van and leaves! Extra doses of Squidward would have helped this volume a lot, especially in place of some of the weak short episodes like ""The Krusty Plate."" Still, there are many hilarious moments and some good episodes in this volume, it is just not as consistently top-notch as the early seasons were.

Disc 1:
""Atlantis Squarepantis""--SpongeBob and Patrick find the missing half of the amulet to Atlantis, a lost world of wealth, high culture and technological advancement. Mr. Krabs comes along for the riches, Squidward for the art, Sandy for the science, Plankton stows away for the weaponry, and SB and Patrick want to see the oldest living bubble. I like the video game scene--the characters look so funny. Too many songs, although the lyrics to Squidward's are very clever. Another highlight is the clip of Gary having a wild party while SB is away. This is an extra long episode which means segments with that annoying Patchy the Pirate.
""Picture Day""--It's picture day at boating school and SB must look his best but keeps getting into messy accidents. This episode reminds me of ""Missing Identity"" where SB had to keep redoing things.
""A Flea In Her Dome""--Sandy returns from a Texas science convention with a flea.
""Mermaidman vs. SpongeBob""--Plankton uses mind control to turn the Krusty Krab's #1 superhero spokesmen into destructive, Chum Bucket-promoting zombies. This episode gave me an idea, why doesn't Karen buy a krabby patty for Plankton to discover the recipe? That would be too easy, I guess. Funny episode, though.
""Le Big Switch""--SB is sent to a fancy restaurant and the Krusty Krab gets a snobby, high society cook as part of the chef exchange program.

""The Donut of Shame""--Patrick suffers immense guilt after stealing SB's donut.
""Blackjack""--SB's bully of a cousin, Blackjack, is out of prison and sends SB threatening notes about him and his family. Some of the details SB imagines are pretty gruesome for a kid's show. SB conquers his fears for the sake of his threatened family members and confronts his cousin, but the ending is stupid.
""Blackened Sponge""--SB gets a black eye while opening a tube of toothpaste (hey, it can happen) so he makes up a story about fighting Jack M. Crazyfish. Notice, he blackens his right eye and, when looking in the mirror, his left eye is correctly blackened (nice attention to detail).
""Pest of the West""--After learning about his friend's famous ancestors, SB reads about his great x7 grandfather Sponge Buck. I like Patrick's line: ""I don't have to accomplish anything in life, because my uncle already did it for me. Really takes the ol' pressure off."" Concludes with the funny, Hee Haw-like song ""Idiot Friends.""
""The Krusty Plate""--SB goes to extraordinary, over-the-top means to remove a stubborn bit of crud from a plate. This episode is stupid, but very short, fortunately.
""Pat No Pay""--Patrick commits the worse offense at the Krusty Krab--he doesn't pay his bill. Mr. Krabs makes him work it off, but that ends up costing him much more. Another sub par episode, but mercifully short.

Disc 2:
""The Inmates of Summer""--SB and Patrick plan to go to Sun N Fun Island for summer camp, but end up going on a prisoner ship to Inferno Island. I like how the prisoners try to take advantage of SB's makeshift paddle boat used for his play.
""To Save A Squirrel""--SB and Patrick follow Sandy on a survival camp and waste no time burning their food supply and shelter and using all their water to put out the flames. The ending is silly and makes little sense. The cricket with the helmet was cute, though.
""20,000 Patties Under The Sea""--SpongeBob and Patrick dig up a submarine and Mr. Krabs has them use it to sell krabby patties on the road (or, uh, water) and are met with competition (Plankton) and a monster in an abyss.
""The Battle of Bikini Bottom""--SB and Patrick get into a battle over cleanliness (SB) or lack thereof (Patrick). Funny one, I like the beginning when they're wearing the ""Best Friends"" shirts.
""Whatever Happened to SpongeBob?""--SB manages to make everyone he knows mad at him so he leaves Bikini Bottom and ends up in New Kelp City where the residents have a strange aversion to bubbles. What's up with everyone calling him ""idiot boy"" all of a sudden?

""Goo Goo Gas""--Plankton creates a gas that turns adults into babies in his never-ending quest to steal the krabby patty formula. The difficulty he has making the gas doesn't make sense because he got it right the first time. His line after watching a woman tell her baby she can take away its formula whenever she wants: ""Something about that woman reminds me of my mother,"" is very funny.
""The Two Faces of Squidward""--SB accidentally slams Squid's face with a door. When the bandages are removed, Squid becomes a chiseled hunk and his resulting popularity becomes too much to handle.
""Spongehenge""--A severe wind storm whistles through SB's pores creating music that attracts jellyfish (reminds me of the episode where the jellyfish have a wild party at SB's house after the jellyfish keeps following SB). SB hides in a cave and finds a solution to his problem. Clever ending.
""Banned in Bikini Bottom""--A tour bus of old biddies arrive at the Krusty Krab and decide to ban krabby patties because they caused SB to sing and dance. In the spirit of Prohibition, Mr. Krabs sells patties underground (well, not literally).
""Stanley S. Squarepants""--SB's klutzy cousin comes to live with him (how many cousins does SB have?) and SB gets him a job at the Krusty Krab. Stanley, of course, does nothing right and SB keeps being blamed. Mr. Krabs finally finds the perfect job for Stanley--the Chum Bucket. Very annoying character, I hope he is a one-timer.",1228003200,8,6640,4.85273368606702
