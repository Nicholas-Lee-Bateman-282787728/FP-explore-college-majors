8521677,2,B007SPPGSG,I didn't even think to check that it was compatible with DVD players in the US.... Sadly not readable by our players.,1494201600,,117,4.363636363636363
8521678,1,B007SPPGSG,"This is one of my favorite movies and series HOWEVER, the DVD brings up an error message on both my new DVD players which plays both blue-ray and regular DVD's.  I noticed on the back of the cover that there were Scandinavian type flags and no US flag listed which lead me to wonder if this mark was perhaps not intended to be used in USA DVD players.  Also, I see Region 2 listed which I have no clue what that means.  I received another Jewish based film from Amazon in the past which I was never able to play with the SAME error response.  Would be nice to know if this is so, and if it is, then will a refund be extended (I would be happy to return it as it cannot be used on any of my DVD players or laptop/computers.",1482451200,,722,3.9930555555555554
