8168861,2,B000MGBM8G,"I took a look at this movie because the online synopsis sounded intriguing.  As for the film, the photography is nice and there are some great, fluid camera movements, and some pretty set-ups.  That being said, I have to say this is one of the most boring films I've seen in many a month.  Believe me, nothing happens.  You can almost feel everyone involved in this production reaching for more, wanting to make something out of it--yet everything about it is ordinary.  Obviously the film makers felt lucky to get the one location (the house) so it all takes place there.  Although one location films are difficult to hold interst these days, it could work if the scenes were taut, the acting intense, the situations interesting.  But it's all deadly dull.  Most people won't make it to the end.  The characters are uninteresting the direction and acting competent but pedestrian.  You keep waiting and hoping for something to happen and it never does.  There's not one memorable line or one interesting scene.  No stand-out moments.  One scene happens after the other (some quite long and pointless) without any tension or excitement building up.  The film simply exists. I think everyone involved in this film will probably move on to better projects and I wish them luck.",1177632000,,1275,4.842592592592593
