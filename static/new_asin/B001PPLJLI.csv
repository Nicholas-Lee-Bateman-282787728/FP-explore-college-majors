8334094,1,B001PPLJLI,"This is, unsurprisingly, a trash film. Its the type of movie I would have loved as a 10 year old boy because I would have valued cheesey fight scenes over quality filmmaking.

Also, theres no way the 5-Star reviews of this film were left by real people that actually liked this dumpster fire. Someone directly involved with this film made those or had them made. No question.",1524009600,,375,4.597014925373134

8334098,2,B001PPLJLI,"""Street Warrior"" is one of many TV action films getting buried in the heaps of similar flicks that have sat around movie store shelves before heading towards the bargain bin. With a story that's not very inventive and fight scenes that were mediocre even at the time of its release, this is a watchable but totally overlookable addition to an already cluttered subgenre that will only truly interest fans of particular performers.

The story: Discharged war veteran Jack Campbell (Max Martini,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Unit/dp/B002G1WPHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Unit</a>) returns home to find his brother comatose after being drawn into an underground fight club controlled by a wealthy sadist (Nick Chinlund,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tears-of-the-Sun/dp/B000095WW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tears of the Sun</a>). Seeking revenge, he finds himself trapped in ""the Gauntlet"" as well when a family member is taken captive.

The movie's biggest asset is its strong cast: though these roles could just as easily have been played by lesser-known performers, the effort put forth by Martini, Chinlund, sidekick Max Pehrlich (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drugstore-Cowboy/dp/6305594333/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drugstore Cowboy</a>), love interest Valerie Cruz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Off-the-Map/dp/B00540G3GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Off the Map</a>), and a couple others is noticeable and keeps the movie watchable in lieu of a more compelling story or interesting fights.

As tends to be the case with low budget action pictures, the problem with these fights is how they're shot and edited. The camerawork could be worse, but it still stays too close to the performers most of the time, making a lot of the action tough to follow. Further hindering the cohesiveness of the brawls is how clunkily shots are shoved together, oftentimes with considerable gaps in the action. Max Martini does a decent job at playing a fighter, and the martial cast is a decent mix of better- and lesser-known film fighters (including a surprisingly large&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sidney-Liufau/dp/B00005MM6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sidney Liufau</a>&nbsp;as the champion), but their physical prowess can't save these mostly-bad thirteen matches.

Chances are you reached this film's page because you're an action fan to begin with, and if this is the case, let me assure you that you've probably seen this movie many times before with different covers and a slightly tweaked storyline. Unless you're building a collection of underground fight flicks, this one's not worth the prices of purchase. There's just nothing new here.",1363305600,,2862,6.6037234042553195
8334099,5,B001PPLJLI,"The ""Street Warrior"" is Jack Campbell, played by Max Martini, an
ex-army ranger, who comes back home to discover his brother beaten near
death because of an underground no holds barred fight club. He enters
the gauntlet to avenge his brother and bring order to the town that has
been corrupted by the ring leader, played by Nick Chinlund.

""Street Warrior"" supplies us with tons of great action fight scenes
that are at times vicious. Various styles of fight techniques are
used... martial arts, boxing, wrestling, street brawling, luchador, and
lots of cheat moves. What more can you ask from a fight movie? Well,
how about some beautiful women? Street Warrior has lots of great eye
candy as well to keep your interest piqued between the fists and blood.

The acting is very good and believable by the entire cast. Props to Max
Martini and Nick Chinlund on their performance, but also to the
characters of Baldus, played by Gary Kasper, the evil white supremacist
Nazi fighter who entices the rabid paying audience by yelling ""Hate
Me!"", and the character of Santo, played by Danny Arroyo, the luchador
fighter who befriends Campbell and is forced to fight in order to save
his wife and children.

Fighting, sex, blood, dancing women and great action... What more can
you ask from a fight movie? ""Street Warrior"" is well worth the rental or purchase.",1239580800,7,1351,4.83982683982684
