7900713,5,8015200695,"This product spans 3 albums from the band's history.  It is a pretty decent collection of pretty great songs.  There are two I can think of that one might want to skip over due to their extensive radio play, but all in all it is a pretty good video.

It has mostly songs from Beyond Belief and Unseen Power with a few from Wake-Up Call.  The are a lot of good videos on this one and great imagery

to go with them.  A few worth mentioning are Dance, Destiny, Unseen Power,

Seen and Not Heard, and Midnight Oil--these are all hard rocking and excellent.  Seen and Not Heard has a plus--it is humorous.  Of the slower songs Just Reach Out and Love are great.

(Quick note:  Also, you might want to check out the outfits on the two Johns, if nothing else it might be good trivia.  If you're a lady, you might notice it more--especially on Sight Unseen.  You wonder if they got their jeans at Snug Fit R Us or something).

To sum up the review, great job Petra!",1167523200,,958,4.220994475138122
