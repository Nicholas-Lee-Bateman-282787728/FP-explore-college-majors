I ordered a replacement from Amazon, and the new disc that came wasn't formatted properly to be watched on a DVD player. I had to rip files from the DVD onto my computer and find a program to play them on my PC. Serious quality control issues going on with this product. Stay away.",1424390400,,354,4.298507462686567
