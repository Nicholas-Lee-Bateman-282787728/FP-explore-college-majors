7776208,5,B01H2OWNG0,"My wife and I were genuinely (but pleasantly) surprised by this little gem. Ive been a fan of Marilu Henner since her Taxi days (1978-1983), so we figured wed give the movie a shot. The film definitely has a campy feel at times, but there are some genuinely touching moments in between the laughs. Although we weren't familiar with Chelsey Crisp prior to viewing, I suspect well be seeing a lot more of this young actress.",1473638400,8,422,4.565789473684211
7776209,5,B01H2OWNG0,"A delightfully, actually FUNNY rom-com. Chelsey Crisp is a treasure. Although a Christian theme runs throughout (one of the romantic interests IS a pastor, so...) it doesn't beat you over the head with it like other Christian films. Way more subtle. Can't wait to see it again.",1473638400,7,277,4.914893617021277

7776211,2,B01H2OWNG0,I was quite disappointed in this Regent University production.  I heard it advertised on the 700 Club and decided to rent it right away.  I am not in favor of films portraying Christianity as dumb and humorous and it wouldn't make me want to become one.,1473638400,4,253,4.478260869565218
7776212,5,B01H2OWNG0,Awesome innocent movie stressing Christianity. Well done,1473638400,,56,7.142857142857143
7776213,5,B01H2OWNG0,"Wonderful movie! I laughed and cried and thoroughly enjoyed this unexpected delight. Though faith based, it is current and relatable. You should see it!",1473552000,2,152,5.375
7776214,4,B01H2OWNG0,"Saw this on Netflix and was delightfully surprised by a truly smart, taut, funny and intelligently scripted story. I hope that folks will not be put-off by the genre some would call ""faith-based,"" because it is truly a wonderful romantic comedy, that just happens to use a Christian backdrop. While being an important adjunct and subtext to the story, it is so well done and hip, that you really just go with it. The commentary, though,  is well taken---some, perhaps many mainline denominational churches are so staid, so judgmental and so hypocritical, that they have become an impediment to folks ignorant of, put off by or just seeking spiritual help. Just a quibble, there is no epistle, Corinthians III in the New Testament, Pastor Ben-- a comment the character makes at a bible study.",1473465600,7,791,4.902985074626866

7776218,2,B01H2OWNG0,Wow. Not sure what to say. While I agree to a certain point with the 5 star rating comments and while I appreciate the intent of this movie I can only award it 2 stars. I wouldnt go so far to say I found it offensive to my faith but I didn't like the movie. The last 15 mins were real and honest and heartfelt. This I related to but the rest of the movie I felt made her look dumb and inconsiderate and disrespectful. Who would stand up and interrupt a sermon in real life?? It does show up the small mindedness of some church members and some christians which is a positive. Well done for trying but it missed the mark considerably in my opinion. God bless for your effort.,1507161600,,674,4.113636363636363
7776219,5,B01H2OWNG0,Delightful and captivating story. Kept my interest till the end. Highly recommend this movie.,1506384000,,93,5.714285714285714

7776224,5,B01H2OWNG0,"I found this movie on Netflix and loved it so much, I bought the DVD for my Netflix-free mom. And if Netflix ever discontinues it, I'll buy a copy for myself, too! It's a hilarious, sweet romance that even my husband will sit through repeatedly, which is good, as I watch it so often. The MC (main character) finds out her husband is a lying, cheating jerk, but just as she's set to divorce the jerk his father has an accident, and the MC ends up living with her mother-in-law and helping her pack up their big house to move. In the meantime, the MC has a few funny run-ins with the local pastor where sparks fly even as they profess their disliking for each other. To make things more complicated, the pastor is a widower, once married to the MC's sister-in-law, who passed away before the MC met her. Add some snotty church members who don't like the never-churched MC and some hilarious moments in church when the MC brings up some really good points, then throw in some serious moments while the MC wrestles with her feelings for the pastor and her introduction to a higher power while the pastor confronts his feelings about loving again after loss and what his church really means to him, and you've got yourself an enjoyable, engrossing movie!",1494806400,2,1250,4.535398230088496

7776227,5,B01H2OWNG0,This is such a funny & refreshing movie.  I love how they show a new believer's journey & the different responses that other longtime christians can have.  It was a great way to show how love & mercy should be extended & be aware of the judgmental attitudes that we all can sometimes fall into at times during our own walk with God.  The two lead actors were so good together. Really enjoyed the spunk & humor throughout the entire movie.  Wonderful script!,1493683200,,457,4.469879518072289
7776228,5,B01H2OWNG0,"Really love Romantic movie made for TV they are always light and predictable.. always have happy ending,... which is what I like

7776234,5,B01H2OWNG0,"This movie has made it onto my ""personal favorites"" list.  I decided to watch it, not really knowing, but suspicious, that it might be a ""faith based"" movie.  I don't often view such movies because of having seen several in the past that I thought were decidedly of poor quality, and had scenes where I felt preached at.  I am a believer, but don't try to cram Scripture ""down my throat"".  I feel very comfortable with how Jesus love and care is depicted in this movie.  The different characters on the committee were in many ways representative of folks that I have met along the way.  I esp. love Eddie, and his optimistic ""attendance is up"" attitude.  The struggles with acceptance and grief are real.  I have re-watched the movie many times.",1490745600,,745,4.590909090909091
7776235,4,B01H2OWNG0,"Cute for a film that had (very) limited theatrical release, and basically went straight to DVD and Netflix streaming.

As a Christian, I was happy to see a ""Christian film"" that doesn't bash people over the head with the Bible.  It's not a message movie meant to make people get on their knees and pray at the end.  It's a pretty standard rom com, with characters who happen to be Christian.  The funniest parts of the movie unfold as Chelsey Crisp's character explores just what it means to be a Christian.  Her awkwardness asking questions in church or socializing in Christian circles is very entertaining.

Nice way to pass a few hours on the couch.  Recommended.",1490659200,4,667,4.698275862068965
7776236,3,B01H2OWNG0,The movie was nice to watch but it lacked realism I thought.,1490486400,,60,4.083333333333333

7776241,1,B01H2OWNG0,This movie is a slap in the face to all Christian movies not to mention misinterpreted pieces of the Bible.  And who is this actress?  She is so bad it makes it impossible to concentrate on a storyline.  Stopped watching less than half way through.  What were all you five-star givers thinking?,1487721600,2,294,4.596153846153846

7776250,1,B01H2OWNG0,"This movie was a terrible disgrace to Christian movies. Full of the most appalling forms of misrepresented biblical standards. The film promotes divorce, inappropriate relationships between a Christian and a non- Christian, a pastor having a relationship with a married woman, and Christian parents aiding in the destruction of their non-Christian children. I cannot sit by and allow people who do not read the Bible to believe that this is what the Bible teaches. This movie is far from the truth of Scripture, and a disgrace to Christianity. Please do not watch this movie, and please warn everyone you know that this is by NO means a movie based on Bibical principles, but rather a confusion of the truth of God. I sincerely hope the producers of this film realize the great mistake they have made in misleading those who may not know the truth, but may watch this movie and think it is what the Bible teaches. I pray that God will not hold this to the charge of the producers of this film, and that any unsuspecting person who watches this films will go back to Scripture and find the true meaning of love, and the proper persctive of marriage. Nothing is impossible with God, and I trust that He will somehow use the falsehood in this film to make His Word be proclaimed. The knowledge that God is in control of this movie, and it's future remains my only source of hope for redemption from it's disgraceful contents!",1485043200,2,1422,4.669322709163347

7776252,1,B01H2OWNG0,"Absolutely awful. This was marketed to me as a Christian movie and as a Christian i fully disown it- the views on divorce, divorce being a subject of comedy, the pastor's behaviour being portrayed as acceptable, and the church, well",1484352000,2,232,4.825
7776253,5,B01H2OWNG0,A really fun romantic comedy with a faith based undertone.  Highly recomment,1483920000,,76,5.333333333333333
7776254,5,B01H2OWNG0,This is a great 'have the girls over' movie.,1483833600,,44,4.0
7776255,2,B01H2OWNG0,"Do the people who made this movie even go to church?  This movie is just one more sad, unrealistic portrayal of the pastor AND the church.  The pastor's character is so unbelievable.  His staggering immaturity is demonstrated by wild swings between milquetoast pandering and testosterone-fueled showboating.  What a joke!

Maybe the writers googled ""church beliefs on divorce"" and tried to include references to each?  Wow.  Again, unbelievable.

The two stars are for the only redeeming qualities, the two female leads.  Great actresses!",1482796800,2,538,5.463414634146342

7776259,5,B01H2OWNG0,"As a person who has watched all the ""religious"" themed movies she ever wants to see in her life, I was a bit wary of this one. But I was surprised to find this to be a touching and entertaining story that would be enjoyable to a person of any faith. The writer had rare ability to find humor and poke fun(tactfully) at some of the common failings in the way churches behave towards ""outsiders. Although it was produced by a college course for film students, it has none of the trademarks of a low budget, family friendly film. The quality of the production is excellent, the acting is good and the story is entertaining. Highly recommended.",1480723200,3,640,4.478632478632479

7776263,5,B01H2OWNG0,This movie was a real surprise. It is not high budget and the way it starts out made me a little doubtful that I would make it through it but it improves as it progresses. It has a nice romance and the lead character finding a romantic love and God is a touching story. Her journey brings me to tears every time I have seen it.,1479427200,2,327,3.9696969696969697
7776264,3,B01H2OWNG0,"The storyline was good, and the characters had chemistry.  A lot of the dialog was good & there were funny lines. However, the way Hollywood portrays Christianity is often so embarrassing. When the main female character kept interrupting the pastor during a service the first time, it seemed rude. After that it just seemed disrespectful. At the end, the choir has moved from singing sacred music to simple vacation bible school songs.  Of course there must be room in churches for people to ask questions and be curious, but there is no need to make a mockery out of what should be a time of worshipping a holy God.",1479254400,3,616,4.6422018348623855

It is a well acted, well cast, quality production with a well-written script that is engaging and has humor and meaning.  It has a predictable story arc and elements of a Hallmark romance. This is an entertaining movie with ecumenical messages (whether intended or not) about faith.

In-Lawfully Yours is a Christian themed romantic comedy that stars and is produced by Corbin Bernsen.  Not only does it have a unique love story, theres a positive message about Gods love and redemption.  This is another Christian movie that pleasantly surprised us with some funny moments and a good story.

Upon receiving the news of her father-in-laws illness, Jesse went to inform her husband, Charlie.  Once she tracked him down, she caught him in the arms of another woman.  Divorce paperwork and the death of his father soon followed.  Charlies mother, Naomi, takes the loss pretty hard as she lost her daughter six years prior.  Packing up and moving out of her mostly empty house is not something shes looking forward to, but her son is pushing her so she can move in with him.  Prepping to leave this small town behind she starts packing her things with Jesses help.

Jesse is from New York and is not familiar with how quickly rumors spread around small towns.  Besides the humorous and unwelcome treatment she gets at the only restaurant in town, Jesse is also treated rudely when visiting the local church for the first time in her life.  She has many faith questions and learns the hard way that its not proper to interrupt the pastor during his sermon to ask them.  The pastor, Ben, is her widowed ex-brother in-law who still wears his wedding ring.

At first the relationship between Ben and Jesse is awkward, but it doesnt take long for them to realize that it has some potential.  However, before things get too serious Charlie comes back into town stating that he wants to fix his marriage.  Is Charlie truly changed, jealous, or is he up to no good?  To find out Charlies true intentions and the future of Ben and Jesses relationship, I recommend watching In-Lawfully Yours which can be yours for less than $15 on Amazon.",1474156800,,1893,4.670694864048339

There should be a holy roller category in Amazon that I could look for and avoid.",1474070400,,175,4.67741935483871

7776303,5,B01H2OWNG0,"To be honest with you, I always get a little anxious when I see another attempt at presenting Faith through the medium of film. I am an artist who happens to also be a Christian, but in no way allow that to influence my rating of quality because there are plenty of NON- faith based titles that I have thrown under the bus over the years thanks mostly to the Lifetime Movie Network(my wife loves this channel so I'll leave it at that; don't want to get into any more trouble). I only believe in good or bad quality and that's where the buck stops. ""In-Lawfully Yours"" has knocked it out of the park in terms of an interesting story and thought provoking chemistry. It's a romantic comedy that rates up there with some of the best that have been produced. It will make you laugh so hard that you have to press pause to regain composure, but it will also require that you have a box of tissues handy. It is a charming, fun, thought-provoking adventure that will leave you wanting to be a better person to those around you when you're finished. I'm thankful I took the risk and didn't allow my previous experience with faith-based offerings to keep me from pressing the play button on this one. So much of the success regarding the faith side of this piece is due in large part to the brilliant partnering and chemistry of Chelsea Crisp and Joe Williamson. Rather than taking a cliched approach to presenting faith & life, they lived it truthfully and allowed for a real human response. I am happy to say that this would be the first Faith based movie aside from ""The Passion of the Christ"" that I have a given a 5 star rating to. Don't miss this one folks. It's one for the ""Romantic Comedy"" record books.",1473724800,13,1703,4.40952380952381

8764527,5,B01H2OWNG0,"It was a delightful movie that my family found by chance on Netflix.  It reminded us of our small country church where yes we do ask questions during the church and are encouraged to do so by our pastor.  My pastor makes it fun and likes the interactive participation of all that attend.  Faith doesn't have to be boring.  Just my 2 cents but if you believe and can get by the divorce, a pastor that lost his love and a family and community that is in the process of rebuilding their lives this is a fun movie taken in a positive direction vs a direction of violence and destruction.  I don't believe that the content of the divorce was approved of in the movie but the reality of coping with death, life, adultery and how to move on in your life and make a difference was the focus I saw in the film.  And you did see growth in the church and all the characters in their faith as they made the journey..",1521590400,,904,4.166666666666667
