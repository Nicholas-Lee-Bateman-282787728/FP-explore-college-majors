This is a well-organized, very simple, and totally fun DVD oriented for complete beginners, but packed with so many creative ideas that it would be educational and inspiring for anyone! This DVD is an excellent introduction for someone wanting to understand the basics of card-making with rubber stamping. I wish I'd had this when I started; it would have saved me a lot of frustration, plus given me a good start in card design.

The DVD is over two hours long. It has a special section called ""Basics"", information for complete beginners. This section covers supplies, rubber stamps, inks, papers, scoring, and cutting. Once you've viewed these, card-making project categories include: solids, colors, embossing powders, masks, backgrounds, resists, folds, windows, and pop-ups.

Card-making projects are simple and don't require extensive supplies or expensive supplies. Judi Watanabe has her own line of products called JudiKins, but other products can be easily substituted if desired. Variations are shown for each project.

The whole DVD is interesting, but I especially enjoyed tips about creating background papers, covering over mistakes, using masks, and resists.

Extras include a gallery with commentary by Judi, tips from projects arranged in an index, bloopers, and more. All of the PageSage DVDs are wonderful in the extras that are included, enabling the DVD to be more than just a class, but an easy tool for reference.

Highly recommended, especially as the perfect introduction for beginners to rubber stamping!

8205129,5,B000SC21WU,"If you've ever been to the JudiKins booth at a stamping convention, you know that the demos are always inspiring, whether the technique is simple or complex.  Judi Watanabe, owner of JudiKins, brings that inspiration to her DVD, Rubber Paper Scissors.

While this DVD appeals to beginners, experienced stampers will also be inspired by Judi's projects, her sense of design and style and the many tips and tricks that she uses to achieve her beautiful finished pieces.  From fun and funky to elegant, Judi's projects are a pleasure to watch--and make.

I also love Judi's bloopers...her sense of humor is infectious!!!

As always, PageSage provides much more than a standard instructional DVD.  Each one is a private class that you can take at your leisure...over and over again!",1187308800,8,778,5.0390625
8205130,5,B000SC21WU,"Did I say class? Yes I did and even better you get to see it as if you were right there standing in the first row of a demo. Even though Judi the owner Judikins (along with her husband) you see lots of products in her bag not just her own brand.

The level of this 2 hour DVD is towards a beginner however, as many people know, you end up learning a lot of new tricks from this level of training since when you were a beginner you were wrapped up in just the basics. Having said that, for the true beginners you will get more out of this DVD each time you watch it making it even more valuable.

If you have ever seen Judi giving a demo at a convention you know how deep the crowd around her table gets. Save you feet and neck, be in the first row, and take home this wonderful DVD.",1187049600,6,782,3.911949685534591
8205131,5,B000SC21WU,"I'm always impressed when I can get a stamping publication of any kind that teaches me something that I have not already read or learned elsewhere, so I didn't expect to learn anything new from this one, but I'm pleased to report that I was wrong.  Judi is very watchable--she makes every point that a beginning stamper needs to know about learning to stamp (without being overbearing about it OR boring, either!) as well as including some stamping instruction to appeal to the same stamper as skill improves and reminders for those of us who may be returning to a technique that has changed because of improved supplies.  Judi's artwork is always appealing and professional but what makes it more so is that even the baby beginning cards are very do-able!  Be sure to watch every single part of the DVD as the gallery includes more tips spoken over the artwork showing and the bloopers are a hoot and include a 'secret' joke that will make you watch the entire thing again just to catch it all!
I've taken shorter classes that have cost more and taught me less, and I'll be recommending this DVD to ALL my students as a staple for their stamping resource shelf!",1186963200,12,1162,4.603864734299517
8205132,5,B000SC21WU,"This DVD is long overdue! Judi Watanabe is a veteran in the rubber stamping industry and has recently been doing super scrapbook-related episodes on CraftTV. I've been longing for a comprehensive instructional DVD to come along to really go through the paces of using rubber stamps. I used to be a rubber stamper, but with a lot of old techniques. This is chock-full of step-by-step instructions, great video and audio. It's a PageSage production so if you're familiar with Tim Holtz' DVDs - this is the same high quality. Judi is a great teacher and has clearly thought out her projects so that they built on each technique. She goes through the Basics, using solid stamps (which always is a challenge for me), coloring stamps, using embossing powders, using masks (which really adds a lot of sophistication to a piece without a lot of complication!), doing resists, making backgrounds, a couple of other technique areas, such as, folds and pop-ups! I can't wait to do these pop-ups for kid's cards! And she always shows variations on the projects, too, to keep your creative juices flowing. You'll be introduced to some products, via name brands (i.e., Judikins), but this is definitely not a product-plugging DVD. It may seem pricey at first, but it has a run time of over 120 minutes! I watched the whole video from start to finish and I can't wait to dig out some old stamps that I was almost getting rid of because I couldn't see new uses for them. Hopefully, Judi will come out with Part II soon!",1185062400,10,1503,4.718631178707224
