4398537,5,B004KX70FQ,"I started watching this with no expectations, and after 5 minutes I was totally hooked. It tells of the real life experiences of Geoffrey Wellum, the youngest Spitfire pilot of WW 2. It is from his memoir and he is featured in this film. Although it is a drama his pieces to camera are as moving as the film.

He gets posted and is taken under the wing of the Flight Commander; they all develop a really tight bond and have their own ways of dealing with loss. The aerial fight scenes are amazing, and the CGI is so good that I kept thinking it must be real planes - which I am sure there were for parts of the film. It is hard to say too much without being a plot spoiler, but it deals with his determination to prove himself, his love life and what happens when battle fatigue takes its toll.

I was genuinely moved by this film and felt very emotional at the end. It is so important to remember all of those who died in WW 2 and the Battle of Britain is to be especially so for it was when Britain stood alone. With the exception of volunteers from around the world, these were mostly young, lacking in experience and had not really had a chance to live their lives. Yet they all went up every time it was asked of them this is a great testament to those few men. I can not recommend highly enough.",1322438400,95,1301,4.138339920948616
4398538,5,B004KX70FQ,"I read Geoffrey Wellum's book when it first came out in 2003. This film - adapted from the book - was produced as part of the 70th anniversary remembrance of the ""Battle of Britain"" and was first shown on September 14, 2010 in the UK. That may have been its only showing on TV. In a word it is superb.

Read a current day RAF Airman's Blog here [...] for a comprehensive review.

This is a sober account of what it was like to have fought in the Battle of Britain in a Spitfire. No heroics. No Hollywood glamor. It might be noted that Wellum was transferred to Malta after the Battle of Britain where the stress ultimately got to him. He reportedly had a compete nervous breakdown. Combat fatigue. In his early 20s.

It is little understood in the USA that Hitler really did intend to invade Britain in the late summer of 1940 but he needed air superiority to accomplish it. The Battle of Britain convinced Hitler to ""postpone"" the invasion and he then turned his attention to Russia. We know how that turned out. Without the RAF winning the Battle, the outcome of WW II might have been very different.

Wellum is still alive at age 90 and does the voice over narration at the beginning and end. My only regret is that there are no subtitles for the hard of hearing. The aerial photography is outstanding.",1318291200,164,1305,4.425
4398539,5,B004KX70FQ,"Being a huge history buff, I was quite impressed by the book and the film.  My uncle flew with the RAF during the  second World War.  Having read some of the reviews here, I do wish people could just appreciate the history and remember the lives lost due to war.  The actor playing Wellum was quite good and has performed some other brilliant roles.  But, this film was not about him.  I very much enjoyed that the true pilot Wellum shared his reminiscences as a very young pilot.  I found it a very interesting historical film.  Have always had a very soft place in my heart for the ""fly-boys"".",1471219200,,595,4.394495412844036

Sam Heughan is brilliant and moving as RAF pilot Geoffrey Wellum (a true story I'd never heard before) in the Battle of Britain. The supporting cast is splendid.

4398557,5,B004KX70FQ,Excellent movie!,1447977600,,16,7.5
4398558,4,B004KX70FQ,"This film is both engaging and heartbreaking. Narrated by the gentleman who is the actual subject of the story, the film is parsed between pictures of the man as he is in the present day, while showing dramatized pieces during WWII showing the beginning of central character's pilot training, the ongoing events of the character's and squadron's stories, and the closing narration.  It may sound unnaturally cut and pieced, but in this case, it actually worked.  I have a deeper appreciation of the Spirfire pilots' issues & obstacles of their missions.  I came to this film due to my appreciation of Sam Heughan's work in Outlander. First Light was released in 1996, so there's 10 years difference between the two projects. You can see the evidence of Sam's burgeoning acting skills; and (smiling here) it was fun to see a few of his personal quirks show through. The pleasant surprise for me was a supporting role done by Gary Lewis (again Outlander). It was a joy to see the two of them working together and compare/contrast their Outlander roles.

I wanted to give this a 5-star rating; however, the sound on this film just sucks!  There's no close-captioning. I have a hearing problem, and unfortunately, there are several moments in the film when the conversations were lost in noise and mumbling.  It made a difference in a few scenes when I couldn't pick-up the dramatic issue for lack of understanding the conversational points.  This problem really robbed from the dramatic effect.  I'd be surprised if even a fully healthy-hearing viewer could pick up all the conversations. Otherwise, the other aspects of the film were excellent.  I do recommend this, especially for Heughan's/Outlander fans, and if you have healthy hearing, or great tolerance.",1446681600,7,1758,4.993150684931507

4398560,4,B004KX70FQ,"I bought this because I love Sam Heughan in Outlander and wanted to see more of his work. He shines in this drama and you can see his growth as an actor. He looks (and sounds) very different from the curly red-haired he plays in Outlander but his performance is great. Sam brings a sense of humanity to any role he plays, such a great talent!!",1446336000,4,343,4.212121212121212

And for ""Outlander"" series fans, it stars a young Sam Heughan (Jamie Fraser) and Gary Lewis (Laird Colum MacKenzie). My only complaint is that there are no subtitles or closed captions for hearing impaired.

4398565,5,B004KX70FQ,"Great movie. Loved learning about the youngest Spitfire pilot in the RAF in the Battle of Britain during WWII. Sam Heughan portrayed Geoffrey Wellum with the right amount of excitement, fear and courage. Wellum was a true hero, and he lived with the effects of the war for the rest of his life. Doing what has to be done for one's country's survival, and hating the necessity of doing it, is the essence of heroism.",1444521600,3,415,4.546666666666667
4398566,5,B004KX70FQ,"Very interesting, well told story with believable mix of drama and history documentary.  I would recommend it highly to anyone who is interested in history and in particular World War II.",1444262400,3,187,5.032258064516129
4398567,5,B004KX70FQ,Interesting piece of history based on actual events....superbly acted...,1443830400,2,72,7.111111111111111
4398568,5,B004KX70FQ,"This was a very enjoyable account of one man's experience with the R.A.F. during the Battle of Britain in the early 1940's.  The movie includes some narration by and a few camera moments with Geoffrey Wellum, the actual pilot on whom the film is based.  It would be difficult for anyone that hasn't been in that sort of life and death situation to fully understand what it must have been like for these young men to risk their lives day after day.  I think the human point of view keeps the audience from seeing this as just another ""war story""  with aircraft, guns and crashes.  It helps the viewer to understand the depth of both the stress and the danger of these situations.  This is included in the subject matter of the movie and brings to mind current day issues for those suffering from PTSD.  Wellum's bravery in the film is not overplayed, nor does it overshadow that of his fellow comrades.  Sam Heughan does a wonderful job as Wellum as his fears, doubts and troubles are clearly expressed.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in WWII stories.",1443657600,3,1077,4.567708333333333

4398573,4,B004KX70FQ,"This is a fine biopic of Geoffrey Wellum the youngest pilot to fly for the UK in the Battle of Britain. The film is well done and the combat scenes are first rate. Film also deals with the stress of flying and the losses suffered. Wellum also makes a cameo appearance in the film. Enjoyable film about ""one of the few.""",1441584000,,319,4.245901639344262

4398576,5,B004KX70FQ,"I've read quite a few first-person accounts of the air war in Europe, and Wellum's book (also called ""First Light"") is a favorite.  So I jumped at the chance to watch this when it became available at long last in the US.  I can't judge how well it portrays the Battle of Britain, I suppose, but it certainly is true to the book, and the commentary provided by Wellum himself is especially interesting.  Note that his squadron commander, Brian Kingcome, wrote a book as well -- ""A Willingness to Die.""  Not nearly as popular as ""First Light"" but I thought it was excellent.",1440806400,,572,4.524271844660194

4398587,5,B004KX70FQ,"EXCELLENT!  Visually: Unlike the Battle of Britain movie, which overly used some fake looking model scenes (remember the destruction of the JU-87 Stuka where the wings explode off the fuselage that was used at least 2 or 3 times in the movie?), this movie used several scenes from the original Battle of Britain movie but none of the hokey, cheap looking aerial scenes and also did NOT use so many BoB scenes that you felt like you were simply watching the original Battle of Britain movie.  For pilots, theres probably still too few aerial shots but what they have is fantastic!  Storytelling: The DVD seamlessly weaves a few live, unscripted interviews and voice-overs of the main character (Mr. Wellum himself) with scenes that depict his adventures as a WWII Spitfire pilot.  I didn't expect that at all but it was a nice touch to the movie...almost like a documentary that goes heavy on the storytelling.  The emotional side of flying: I've read his book (""First Light"") that the movie is based on, too, and both the book and this DVD do a superb job of trying to describe what it's like to fly a high performance, single-seat military plane.  The scenes of him slicing around and through the clouds is perfect; I can attest that he describes the romance and thrill of it all perfectly. the thrill, the anxiety, the frustration, the fear and the joy.  A note to those with children: the language of fighter pilots, especially in war, is not what you'd hear in church, so I would not recommend watching this with children around.

4398588,4,B004KX70FQ,Excellent movie.  Learned a lot about the British pilots and their brave defense of their country in spite of the  odds against them.  The fact that it is based on a true story made it even more enthralling.,1434240000,,207,4.394736842105263

I love history and this is a true story set down with actual facts, emotions, and a lot of talent.  Sam Heughan is a chameleon of sorts and takes on the persona of whatever character he is playing, a true talent.  My  only complaint would be that the movie is too short, and I felt as though the last few pages were left out of the book I was reading.  I would also like to say that Sam has come a long way since the making of ""First Light"".

4398635,5,B004KX70FQ,First Light is the movie adaptation of RAF and Battle of Britain pilot Geoffrey Wellum's memoir of World War 2 service.  The movie is one of the best I've seen in terms of accuracy in the equipment used.  At one point I noticed that an officer was wearing an early RAF cap with a green visor lining - just like those worn in the first years of the war.  That attention to detail flows through the entire film.  This is a fine tribute to those who flew in the Battle of Britain.  The film mixes footage of Wellum in old age reading sections of his published book into the movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film.,1409875200,,610,4.260869565217392

And it had nothing to do with any aerial footage, airplanes on the ground or the war itself.  The movie personalizes the stories of the people who were caught-up in these events.  There are a few errors with regards to authenticity, but it in no way does it detract from the overall effect of the film.  Nicely done chaps!!!",1401148800,,488,4.551724137931035

This is a bit more emotional than the book - however, the reconstructions of what it must have been like are fantastic. Strongly recommended for anyone who has the slightest liking for the pre-jet era of flying",1394582400,,466,4.235955056179775
4398642,5,B004KX70FQ,"The viciousness of the Battle of Britain has always been understated in traditional books and movies but in recent years there are more realistic accounts coming out of what it was really like. ""Piece of Cake"" was the first to look at the personal cost in a more realistic light. Now ""First Light"" portrays the truth. I knew a Polish Battle of Britain pilot who flew for the RAF during the September 1940 peak of the battle. In three weeks he destroyed 15 German aircraft as certified in his RAF logbook making him the second highest scoring Polish Battle of Britain pilot. He told me how the effect on him of these three weeks was absolutely crushing and mind numbing. Like many Poles, he wanted to kill the men in the German planes, not just disable the planes like the British pilots. They hated the Germans with a passion for the rape and murder of their country and people. He said he could barely walk when his squadron was transferred to Scotland for convalescence and recovery. He was later shot down over France and escaped from Stalag Luft 3 with Robert Stanford Tuck just before the Great Escape ""walking"" back to England across Poland and Russia.

4398649,4,B004KX70FQ,"This film is a dramatization of Geoffrey Wellum's memoir, ""First Light.""  It was produced by BBC Television in 2011 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.  I read Wellum's memoir&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Light-The-True-Story-of-the-Boy-Who-Became-a-Man-in-the-War-Torn-Skies-above-Britain/dp/B000W9863C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Light: The True Story of the Boy Who Became a Man in the War-Torn Skies above Britain</a>&nbsp;and was absolutely enthralled by its directness and simplicity, but this docudrama does not quite capture the essence of the book.

Geoffery Wellum appears in the beginning, at the end, and in a few places during the film and it was fascinating to see him and hear his well defined thoughts about himself, the young pilots, and what it all meant. His appearances are the highlights in this film.

The portrayals of the people in the story are a bit flat, two-dimensional, and nearly bloodless and it's hard to believe that volatile young men in those volatile circumstances would have such a stiff-upper-lip quality about everything. Nobody ever raises their voices. Granted that Wellum didn't directly write much about the emotional roller coaster these young pilots endured but he very much intimates it and the film misses it.

The film concentrates on Wellum and just a few other characters and would almost make you believe that an R.A.F. squadron was composed of only five or six people. The main characters are fine and are portrayed by excellent British actors but they are limited by the direction.  Gary Lewis, who plays the squadron C.O., stands out and is the best of them all in this production.

The air scenes with Spitfires and Me-109s are pretty realistic and all too brief.

I liked the film very much as an adjunct to the superb memoir.  It helped me to visualize Wellum's story just a little bit better.  Unfortunately, the film really doesn't stand by itself.",1384128000,3,1990,5.516447368421052
4398650,5,B004KX70FQ,"This is one of the best Battle of Britain movies I have ever seen.  I don't know how I missed it, but as far as I am concerned, this is an absolute classic World War II aviation movie.",1383436800,,184,3.8421052631578947
4398651,5,B004KX70FQ,"I was a six year old in England during the Battle of Britain and vividly remember being bombed by the Luftwaffe.  My cousin John Bevan  was also a Spitfire pilot with 611-Squadron but was shot down and killed in 1943.  The movie was quite authentic in it's portrayal of life on the airfield as well as off-duty hours at the local pub.  The cast did a wonderful job of replicating life as it was on the flight line during those dark days when we fully expected a Nazi invasion, and the emotions felt by young pilot Geofrrey Wellum were superbly portrayed by Sam Heughan.  As a former member of the Royal Air Force I can assure you that the aerial sequences shown were quite fantastic.

I would encourage all WW-2 buffs to see this movie - after all, it's the true story of a very courageous pilot.  Thank God we had men of this caliber who put their lives on the line every day in flying against the Nazi air armadas.",1379894400,3,916,4.321637426900585
4398652,4,B004KX70FQ,"I admit I bought this to get a good look at Sam Heughan who is slated to play Jamie Fraser in the Outlander series on Starz next Spring. The movie was very good and my husband and I both enjoyed it.  The spitfire pilots of WWII had great loss of life however, thankfully there isn't much blood and gore in the movie.  The emotional toll on this young man (he is only 18 at the start) builds as his comrades fall. At one point he gets a 48 hour pass and goes home to visit his parents only to find he can't control his feelings and has to leave early. There are good action scenes and a bit of romance. Overall one is left with sadness that this very young man had to endure such experiences as the necessary price of winning the war.  Its a true story and the narrator is the same man, in old age. At the end he even questions if the sacrifice was necessary as he remembers all the comrades who did not survive.
Sam Heughan will be great as the young Jamie Fraser and this movie is well worth watching on its own merits.",1373846400,10,1020,4.09

But it also tells his story with flashbacks to re-enactors and surviving Spitfires and special effects. It is entirely proper to honor one of the very few of the Few to survive to the present day. But I found it unsettling to go from the hero in the flush of his youth to the ancient of today. If the ending is all in the grave, then what matter how a life began? Doubtless the world is a better place than if the Nazis prevailed. But the fate of the individual remains the same in the long run. I was looking for a little more of a glorious entertainment. I got a philosophical insight into the transitory nature of youth, victory and life. Of course, that lesson is inescapable.",1372550400,,793,4.438356164383562

4398664,4,B004KX70FQ,"A very intersting blend of documentary and dramatization. The sets and scenery were excellent. Most of the flight action was live action and the realism shows. The digital expansion (there simply aren't that many of these aircraft in existence anymore) blended well with the live action and for the most part appeared realistic. The action scenes were effectively linked to and advanced the story / biography. The acting was good.

When I walk out of most movies I think they are poorly edited and that they were too long or that the story was dragged out (or maybe it is that I recently saw part 1 of the Hobbit). However, I wanted this to be a longer film, and it quite easily could have been without dragging it out. More Wellum - he was used well but his involvment was what made this film very special. More connecting the characters to the key events in the Battle of Britain, and connecting the dots to events in 1941. It seemed that all of a sudden his 18 months were up. More character development about Wellum's personal life and how it was effected by his breakdown.

Please - make part 2 of this biography. There are so few good movies about the siege of Malta, and this would make a great one with Wellum's eventual breakdown and return to be a test pilot and to marry in 1944. It would be best in the same format so that Wellum himself narrates, and since he is 91 there is no time to waste.",1358812800,17,1405,4.4

4398674,5,B004KX70FQ,"If a person is really looking for a DVD relating to how it really was during the Battle of Britain this film is it. I have been a Spitfire addict since my early childhood growing up around A/C & have been fortunate enough to talk with a few RAF & RCAF pilots who flew Hurricanes & Spitfires during WW2. Actually the Hurricane had a higher kill ratio than the Spitfire during the Battle of Britain but that's another story. For those of you who are pilots , remember your first solo when your instructor told you to stop on the taxi-way, got out turning you loose on your own. That part in the movie as Geoff arrived at the base with the original Spitfire Pilot's notes on his lap to me was a story on it's own , you didn't have the opportunity to have an instructor along for the ride in a single seat fighter to offer advice,help,etc. Progressing through your training you're now deemed fit to fly a fighter A/C . You have no combat experience but you may or may not have anytime flying Spitfires. Can you imagine the pressure on you ? Is it any wonder your memory turns to mush while being briefed by your ground crew on engine starting procedures & the rest is up to you. A new kid on the block & only eighteen years old in control of the latest fighter A/C of it's time, scarey ? But that's the way it was. I find in this day & age a lot of people just can't visualize that these pilots just didn't go up against the enemy who vastly outnumbered them but the weather they often flew in was often to prove fatal to their existence. And remember these young pilots were not seasoned veterans, it was a learning curve of you lived or died , veteran or rookie. I myself completely enjoyed the film,especially the bit parts of the real Geoffrey Wellum speaking of his experiences. Vastly outnumbered & fighting against seasoned German fighter pilots in their latest fighter A/C I think a person has to recognize what a disadvantage Britain was up against. For the true Spitfire lover & history buff you will see a few inaccuracies such as late model Spitfires that never flew in the Battle of Britain with their 4-blade props,dual under wing cooling scoops , late model exhaust stubs & rectangular gun sights BUT we're 70+ years into the future from the projected time period, original Spitfires of the early "" Marks & Models "" are very scarce so I find such an inaccuracy excusable. As a lover of these A/C & times the movie held my full attention.  As a pilot I just loved all the cockpit shots , procedures, etc and as a history buff of this time period in history the movie captured my full attention & most of all this movie wasn't based on a Hollywood script but actually portrays the Battle of Britain from the youngest pilot to fly & fight in the Battle of Britain telling it like it was.

4398678,2,B004KX70FQ,"I enjoy films about military airplanes, especially ""recips"" (propeller driven).  The Spitfire is a wonderful fighter.
The movie was a disappointment. It was slow moving, with a poor story line.  Very little dogfighting was shown.
The editing was poor.  The scenes in bars and where they sat around were too long--made the plot drag.
This is a film not worth buying.",1324339200,8,365,4.950819672131147
