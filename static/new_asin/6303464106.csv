SLAMBOREE 1995

This was a god event over all and would also see the next inductees into the WCW Hall of Fame that year.

Spoilers

1.[TAG TITLE]HARLEM HEAT VS THE NASTY BOYS-the opening match on the PPV was for the tag titles and would be the Nasties last shot at the belts. For most of the match it would be Sags against the Heat as Knobbs was attacked earlier. Sags starts out strong but soon the two on one advantage leads to Harlem Heat taking control of the match. But Knobbs would emerge at the end and just toss Sherri out in a scary looking moment and get the win and belts.

2. KEVIN SULLIVAN VS THE MAN WITH NO NAME-this was a decent match between these two. Sullivan would be facing a future co member of the Dungeon of Doom. Good match over all but a little short that would see Sullivan win, and then his father would make his debut, the start of the Dungeon.

3. WAHOO MCDANIEL VS DICK MURDOCH-this was the legends match and it was shown in black and white. Also Bobby Heenan was joined by Gordon Solae on commentary. It was cool seeing these legends go at it but it was a short match with Wahoo getting the win.

4.[IWGP TITLE]THE GREAT MUTA VS PAUL ORNDORFF-this was a really good match and much better than I remember it being. Paul starts out well but Muta being the legend that he is just starts laying into him. Muta retains after a wonderful moonsault.

5.[TV TITLE]ARN ANDERSON VS ALEX WRIGHT-this right here was a great match, probably the best match on the card which wasn't a shock considering the two involved. Both men trade momentum in this match as Arn makes Alex good here but still pulls out the victory of course. Back and forth action at a great pace.

6. ROAD WARRIOR HAWK VS MENG-this match was basically just a brawl between these two killers. It was a fun match with Hawk looking really good in this solo match for him. Meng of course was always a tough guy. The brawl eventually spills to the outside where they are both counted out.

7.[LIGHTS OIT MATCH]STING VS BIG BUBBA ROGERS-this was a really good match between the two. Bubba said it would end the same way their previous PPV match did and Sting maintained a Scorpion Deathlock was in Bubbas future. Good pace with back and forth action that would see Sting bring a table down to the match. The table would be used by both men on multiple occasions. In the end Sting does lock in the Deathlock and get the win.

8. RANDY SAVAGE & HULK HOGAN VS RIC FLAIR & VADER-the match I was looking forward to the most back then since I love Randy Savage. Flair and Vader were always favorites of mine as well but The Macho Man is always my guy. It should be noted that Arn Anderson and The Renegade were out at ringside for this match. This was a very fun match as it gave you everything you could want from these guys. The typical Hogan spots for those fans, Randy going crazy and brawling everywhere, Flair and a figure four, Vader bombs and saults amongst other fun spots. Of course it wouldnt be a match with Flair in it if he didn't flip over the turnbuckle and get thrown off of the top rope. Of course Anderson and Renegade get involved and we get the typical Hogan gets the pinfall victory but it was still fun. After the match Savage, Hogan and even Machos father Lanny get attacked.

This was a better event than most people give it credit for like most of these 95 PPV events from WCW.",1477440000,,3384,4.330173775671406
7848150,1,6303464106,"The World tag team title match between Harlem Heat & The Nasty Boys was not great but pretty good. The match between Kevin Sullivan & The Man with no name was awful. The Legends match between Wahoo McDaniel & Dick Murdoch was a dud. The IWGP title match between The Great Muta & Paul Orndroff was 15 minutes of garbage. The TV title match between Arn Anderson & Alex Wright was not great but still watchable. The Meng-Hawk match was a no-sell brawl. The Sting-Big Bubba Rogers match was bad. The tag team match between Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage against Rick Flair & Vader was pretty fun. Overall,despite the two good matches it still stinks. I give this ppv a 1 out of 10.",1348963200,,672,4.384

7848152,1,6303464106,"With matches so boring they put you to sleep Slamboree delivers  weak and uneventful matches the worst being the legends reunion match aired in black and white to increase the already present eyesore.  Hogan and the gang run through the typical stale dated match with Flair and company which should've been aired in black and white as well.  Sting however and Ray Trailer aka the big boss man turn up the heat as they go through tables and turn the ring into a warzone, in an impressively revolutionary ""hardcore match-up"" I recommend soley on this match though.",980899200,,562,4.77319587628866
