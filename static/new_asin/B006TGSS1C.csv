8503985,2,B006TGSS1C,"I have purchased golf DVDs like the US Open 2008 where Tiger defeated Rocco Mediate at Torrey Pines in an epic duel or the DVD's on the Masters Golf tournaments like when Jack Nicklaus won in 1986 contain suspense and play like stories.

This DVD plays like a promotional video for the PGA of America where segments are interspersed throughout the 4 rounds and thus, the story telling part of the action is reduced.

As a high school golf coach, I like to show the team moments from big tournaments to learn how people play, think and respond to situations . . . when the story telling is right, it captivates and inspires young people more about golf.  I can only play snippets from this one due to the pacing and feel of the video.

Very disappointed and will not recommend to others despite the captivating finish to this PGA Championship.  I will avoid future PGA of America videos.",1356825600,,886,4.547169811320755
