8677773,3,B00NFV92DW,A little too much bluing in this product.  I have to use only a very small amount [less than I really need for the job] or else my pure silver-white hair will have a purple cast to it.  Otherwise I like it for it's property of preventing brassiness.,1463961600,2,249,4.166666666666667
