7921550,5,B00004RPR4,I saw this long ago when it was on TV and we had it taped on VHS though I lost the tape twenty years ago much to my disappointment. Some may consider it a bit campy and/or silly with sub-par special effects. But if you take into account for when it was released the special effects were pretty awesome. I love this show and at the time I had hoped and waited for it to become a series but alas disappointment with the tv/movie people is often as they love to cancel the best stuff after one show or one season I have found. If they were to release this show as a movie I would buy it in a heartbeat. If they were to remake it I would go see it and if they are true to the original show I would buy it as well and know many who would love it. The only thing that confuses me about the description info on this page for this show is why is it listed as in GERMAN when it was an American released show in English?,1376870400,,910,3.871657754010695
7921551,5,B00004RPR4,Loved the movie I taped it from TV years ago wish I could find it on DVD the put ma and pa Kettle on DVD and other old movies why not this one too. They should remake it for the Scifi channel or for the big screen have some of the original actors that played in it come back. I see so many remake movies that don't need to be why not this one not to many know about it and the idea is still not been used in other movies much. At least put it on Amazon instant to rent for $3.99 or on Netflix.,1345248000,3,493,3.660377358490566

Unfortunately, a recessive gene was activated by the serum in some people regressing them to Cro-Magnon state, causing the world to fall in to chaos. These regressed humans, called Recessives, were violent and uncontrollable. To survive, people gathered in cities protected by a force fields. Those unlucky enough to be caught outside the cities fall prey to bands or roving Recessives. The movie was intended as a pilot for a series based on this premise, but it seems to have been a no go, as it was never heard from again.",1336867200,3,690,4.80672268907563
