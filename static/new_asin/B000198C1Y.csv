1980235,4,B000198C1Y,"I still rate it 4 stars because I really enjoyed this DVD.  I have been to Jehan's school and her instructors are excellent.  The DVD showcases a lot of the dancers who were in her NYC show Goddessdance.  For those of you who are familiar with Jehan, she composes and performs her own music and that is what you are hearing on the DVD.
My only real complaint with the DVD is that the cuing could have been better especially during the warmup when your head is down and you are facing the floor, but after doing it a few times, you are familiar with the moves and it's not a problem.  I am able to complete the DVD without any problems and I definitely break a sweat especially after all those shimmies towards the end.
I would recommend this DVD to dancers who are not absolute beginners as it does not break down the moves.  But this is a much better bellydancing instructional DVD than Rania, Neena and Veena and the Goddess workout.",1082678400,20,935,4.350574712643678
1980236,5,B000198C1Y,"All I can say is I really really loved it and cannot wait to go home and go through it over and over again.  I am hunting for costumes, shimmies and belts now :-)  It is worth the money!",1078358400,6,186,3.7435897435897436
1980237,5,B000198C1Y,"This DVD is really incredible! It will teach you many of Jehan's earthy movements from top to bottom as well as give you a terrific workout. The movements are presented clearly, the music is wonderful and I love the periodic change in instructors. As a beginner, this is a great way to get started, and as a professional, it's a wonderful chance to brush up on your old skills as well as learn something new. Definitely worth the money.",1073260800,11,436,4.531645569620253
1980258,5,B000198C1Y,"I've never tried belly dancing before, and this video is super easy instruction. Not sure what everyone is talking about. This isn't good instruction for a beginner?

This video was super easy and fun. Even better, I broke a pretty good sweat, and I worked out the muscles that would've gotten worked out at yoga. From head to foot, and all the muscles in between.

The choreography was really lovely, with the girl in the purple being my favorite. She did some more Egyptian belly dance moves, and it was really lovely. Love the indian and arabic influences. This belly dance vid is complete sample of about a handful of basic dance styles. It demonstrates about a dozen basic dance moves, and by names that you'll recognize and remember should ever take a class elsewhere.

Anyway, I think this vid is appropriate for all levels of fitness. There is light stretching, but no really impossible moves. Some people just don't want to admit that they're terrible at following instructions.",1349740800,,987,4.828402366863905
1980259,3,B000198C1Y,"Ok, if you are looking for a beginner instructional workout, The Temple of Jehan is NOT what you want!  You must be familiar with bellydance basics! The moves are not broken down and the voice over instruction is used primarily to inform you of what movement is next in the sequence and that is it.

THE VIDEO STRUCTURE:

WARM UP: Led by Elisha
Voice over instructions including head rolls,maya hips,snake arms,upper torso stretches,undulations,""graceful oriental poses"",head slides,infinity loops, camel walk preparation, etc.

STRENGTH: Led by Neon
hip lifts,hip twists,shimmies,and traveling movements on releve'

SENSUALITY: Led by Blanca
Shoulder accents, layering with shoulder shimmies,deep head rolls,pelvic drops,hip circles,and odd traveling chest lifts with clapping in between.

JOY: Led by Tanna
Shimmies,hip lifts,hip circles,additional layering

PASSION: Led by Kim(Layla,Ayshe)
hip lifts,shimmy walks,bellydance basic back step,shimmy on releve with snake arms,hip circles,

ENERGY: Led by Ayshe

Shimmy layering with vertical figure 8's,undulations,pelvic drops,and hip circles. Running shimmies,maya hips, ""folkloric steps""
*horrible isolations and technique on this section.

COOLDOWN: Led by Layla

Reverse body waves, hip circles,""reverse infinity"",hand flourishes,snake arms,lunge with expanded chest stretch.

PROS:

*Warm up and cooldown are actually pretty good and not rushed. You can easily incorporate both into your workout regimen.
*If you are attempting to strengthen your shimmy, this workout provides MULTIPLE opportunities to do so at different paces.
*Choreography is not difficult.
*Opportunity to increase your range of motion,coordination,and flexibility.
*Various segments will indeed increase the heart rate.
*Multiple layering exercises.

CONS:
*Poor technique(Tanna and Ayshe especially)in reference to isolations. Facial expressions specifically from Ayshe and Kim
 are not welcoming at all. Down right odd and scary at times.
*Dancers appear to be thrown together and unsure of what comes next.
*Inadequate stretching for head rolls. If you aren't careful,injury could occur.
*Poor production  in
*If you aren't careful,you could possibly pick up bad habits(flailing hands). Case in point;Tanna in ""Joy"" section, shoulder
 shimmies.

Overall, the workout is not horrible, but if you want to really become a technical dancer with strong foundational moves,Jenna and Autumn Ward have excellent step by step instruction.",1349136000,,2461,6.104651162790698
1980260,5,B000198C1Y,I have been doing belly dance on my own for many years and this dvd is quite good. Belly dance is good for your core and you feel beautiful while doing it. The music for this dvd is excellant. I would recommend this dvd for any fitness level.,1338595200,,242,4.0625
1980261,3,B000198C1Y,"This workout really isn't for beginners. The moves are not explained, so if you are a complete beginner, you would probably get lost. I was aware from the outset that this video was geared more toward a workout than toward dance, which is fine if that's what you're looking for. Personally, I found the warm-up and the cool-down to be quite useful. But the workout itself could hurt someone who is not properly prepared for the neck and back movements. Really, this should have included a section on safety, and voice overs should have reminded you to do only what you feel comfortable doing and to be careful in order to prevent any strain.

I already knew some of the dancers on the DVD, but I don't feel that their talents were shown off to best effect, especially in jeans. I go more for traditional and folkloric bellydance than a hip-hop look. The set was uncluttered, which was a plus, but on the side of the video all the way through was the name of it. This branding was distracting and totally unnecessary. It should have been included only in the intro. The sound quality is good, but some of the music is pretty silly. If you start listening to the lyrics you might laugh.

I was hoping for a performance in the extras section, but instead there was a short ""prayer"" section that was quite goofy, maybe even rather obnoxious. It certainly annoyed me.

So, if you're looking for a professionally done video that is polished and teaches technique, this is not it. But if you want to have a little fun working on some moves and you're already aware of safety issues and how to prevent injuries, this could be something you might be interested in.",1333670400,,1655,4.546979865771812
1980262,4,B000198C1Y,"The shipper was quick. I found the workout easier than I expected as I had never done this type of workout. It is fun, and a good workout.",1295481600,,138,3.9642857142857144
1980263,3,B000198C1Y,"Ok, FYI, this is NOT an instructional DVD.  It is for exercise and conditioning, and there is no breakdown of the movements.
In some ways I liked this video because it moves along quickly....and the camera angles were done pretty well.  You could actually see what the dancers were doing which is great (no weirdo camera angles of some woman's breasts when she is moving her hips and things like that)...but the rest of it was less than stellar.  Like many, many other badly made videos before it, the instructor queues you to do what the dancer who is facing you is doing.  So, when the dancer moves to her right (your left) you have to quickly make a decision to either mirror her, or do what the voice is saying.  And it's a voiceover, not actual instruction, so what was the difficulty to instruct it properly? Also, there are a lot of times when there are no queues at all.  I spent several times being told to bend down and hold a stretch, and I suddenly realize I have been down there a bit too long....and they've stood up. But there is no voice queue.  I don't know about anybody else out there, but I have no eyes in the back of my head to watch them with.  There are other times when they do not queue you, but since you are looking at the screen you can follow along pretty easily.
Like another reviewer on here I also could have done without the ""I am the goddess"" nonsense.
This video would be ok for someone who has taken lessons....however, I am loath to recommend it to relative newbies, even with lessons because the head tossing and the pelvic drops to the front can cause damage if not performed correctly....and there is no instruction on how to do them correctly.  So, if you are a beginner and you want to do the head rolls/hair tossing sections where they're flinging their hair around....unless you like having a stiff neck, and possibly worse PLEASE find someone who will show you how to do it properly.  If you want to perform the moves where they drop the front of the pelvis down and open up the front of the stomach area, simply drop the front of the pelvis.  Do NOT arch your back and over do this move!  Either one of these moves done incorrectly could cause damage to the neck and spine. At the very least those two moves should have a section where they are broken down for those who haven't been instructed.  I feel that using these moves without any cautions is completely irresponsible on the part of the producers.",1293062400,,2452,4.41019955654102
1980264,2,B000198C1Y,"There are better belly dancing videos out there, in my opinion.  didn't use this video more than twice. Instead, I recommend Blanca's Sensual Belly Dance DVD. It's much more fun and well thought out. I",1291939200,,201,4.742857142857143
1980265,3,B000198C1Y,"It works for moving and working out, but is useless for learning real belly dance. The dancers are lacking of the technical an complexity of the belly dance moves. If you want fun working out, it may work. but if you are looking a belly dance instructional dvd, try something else.",1291766400,,281,4.529411764705882
1980266,5,B000198C1Y,"Love the DVD. Great work out. Instruction are excellent.
Highly recommended to anyone who is serious about Belly Dancing.",1285113600,,121,5.421052631578948
1980267,5,B000198C1Y,"I really like this DVD. Having read a lot of the other reviews I will agree that it is not for beginners, the dancer needs to be able to follow along and have a grasp of a little more than the basics. (imagine trying to follow along to a simple choreography, not having any previous introduction to it).I guess it all comes down to WHY you are buying this DVD.I have been bellydancing for a long time and I like to workout using bellydance moves. A lot of the ,""bellydance workout"" DVD's out there seem watered down to me,but not this one. It is constant movement, and except for the clapping ( ?) it is 100% bellydance moves. it also features some really good dancers, Neon, Blanca, Ashye, etc.
  Some people didn't like the plain white set and simplified costumes. They saw cheesy, I saw simple. Those same people complained that the movements were too hard to keep up with; imagine an elaborite backdrop, and fancy costumes on top of the movement combinations,and then see how hard it is to keep up.
  I did not care for the ,""music"",but didn't find it too annoying. Overall I understood what Jehan was trying to do, to take the rigid, masculine, de-feminized workout world, and put the feminine back into it. The ""chanting"" was actually a lot of positive affirmations about our beauty and power as women. So even though it was not my thing,I didn't mind that stuff being pumped into my head, it is better than other negative feminine stereotypes out there.
Good workout, a little different, preview it before you buy it, because liking this DVD seems a matter of taste to most people.",1268784000,4,1588,4.580985915492958
1980295,1,B000198C1Y,This video was boring and I was hoping for more bellydance moves. This looked like a homemade video and had little direction. The sound was not good either. I would not recommend this item.,1260576000,,189,4.588235294117647
1980296,5,B000198C1Y,I am a pilates instructor but I was asked to step outside of my comfort zone to sub a few belly dancing classes for a friend. I ordered a few dvd's and this one was the best of the 3 I bought. I was able to learn the basic moves very quickly and I like how each segment is broken down. I was able to teach the classes successfully and now they want me to teach it permanately! This is a GREAT VIDEO!,1252195200,,399,3.819277108433735
1980297,2,B000198C1Y,"I personally don't think that this workout explains how to do the moves very well besides the fact that I don't feel I benefited from the routines. I find them boring, and there's not enough focus on the isolations that really define belly dancing. I have been a dancer all my life and belly dancing for 6 years now and I know a quality video (even for beginners) when I see one, and this would not be one that I recommend.",1242432000,3,423,4.234567901234568
1980298,5,B000198C1Y,It's a great workout if you've just had a baby and want to lose the belly.,1236297600,2,74,3.6875
1980299,3,B000198C1Y,"Wow, it is really hard to give this one a fair rating because the quality really does depend on your dance and fitness level. I actually got my DVD at a secondhand store - a very rare find here in the bible belt, believe me. I purchased this one along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-Dance-Party-Bellydance-combinations-you-can-learn-tonight/dp/B0002CSBK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly Dance Party: Bellydance combinations you can learn tonight!</a>and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-For-Body-Shaping-Abs-Belly-Dance-Fitness-Workout/dp/B00068YUGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance For Body Shaping: Abs - Belly Dance Fitness Workout</a>&nbsp;for a price so low I felt like I was stealing them. The abs dvd was still completely wrapped and unopened. When I got them home to take a look, I could understand why someone might have given them away.

I was impressed with the warmup, which is graceful and relaxing but I immediately noticed that there is no breakdown of some of the moves, such as the large hip circle. I let that pass because it was just the warmup. I did the workout several times before writing this review to make sure that I was right about there being no breakdown of any of the moves, steps and combinations. There really isn't, and the DVD moves very fast. If I were at beginner level, I would have been very frustrated and probably would have given up on it too.

On the other hand - for those who are in great physical shape and pick up easily on dance and aerobic moves and for intermediate and advanced bellydancers, this is probably the best cardio workout I've seen. True to its title, the workout really is a bellydance workout and some fun folkloric moves are included as well. After the warm-up, you have a choice of four different styles of dance: Strength, Sensuality, Joy and Passion. The variety offered keeps this DVD from becoming a bore. Jehan's music is the perfect tempo and not so loud that it is distracting. The bonus features include the beautiful prayer dance (or Goddess Prayer, I can't remember what it's called on this one) and it would have been nice to include it in the instruction. The bonus feature showing the cast is simply a series of film shots that doesn't connect the dancers' names to their faces and I still don't know who is who other than Neon and Blanca.

I can't honestly say that the title is misleading, but the description stating that ""Dancers of all levels as well as non-dancers will benefit..."" is. It goes on to say that ""If you don't have any dance training, you will need sharp observation skills and focus to meet the challenge."" This DVD moves so fast that it's going to take a lot more than that for most people.  I also don't see the point of calling a workout ""bellydance"" if the instructor is not going to teach at least a few authentic bellydance moves.

Another issue that is hard to rate is the way that the dancers are dressed. For most of the cardio segments, they are wearing cute little tight jeans. I always appreciate an instructor who does wear pants because it is so much easier to observe what her legs and feet are doing, so I'm not really sure why the jeans bother me a bit. Perhaps it's because many of the women we talk to about bellydance immediately react negatively by saying that they are too fat. None of these dancers are too thin or anorexic and in fact, all are at very healthy weights - but there is something about the jeans that sends the message that bellydance is sexy and flirty. For some, this may be a very positive image and something to strive for but to the perception of those whom we are trying to educate about the dance, it does nothing to educate the misinformed about the art form and in fact, perpetuates negative stereotypes.

So, this one has been quite a dilemma to rate and I think I'm going to have to settle on the three star ""average."" I've tried a number of bellydance instructional videos before and after taking classes over the past three years. There are only two that I would recommend to beginners with no dance experience.

Magical Motion</a>&nbsp;by Atea and Friends breaks down all of the basic moves and shows you how to improvise a dance based on each one. It also offers a history lesson, a little zill class and a costume show as well as featuring dancers of all ages, shapes and sizes.

She did her research and consulted with Ansuya, who is also on the DVD, and actually teaches authentic bellydance moves and provides a short dance you can learn in addition to the workout.",1235347200,3,5175,5.250302297460701
1980300,2,B000198C1Y,"The first thing I noticed was that the audio was very poor, and the camera is off kilter much of the time. That pretty much set the tone for the rest of the video (at least what I made it through). Not to mention the large ""Ultimate"" print on the side of the screen, which is rather distracting.

As far as the workout goes, it is very fast moving with little instruction and explanation. It is difficult to follow, and having 2 years of belly dance instruction being able to follow along was the least of my worries. I can't say whether or not it is a good workout since I never actually finished it because it was simply too frustrating. I also found the music strange. The voiceover was also just weird at times, talking about your body's connection to the universe or whatever. Normally those things don't bother me, but it just seemed out of place. The attire of some of the dancers is a little strange as well; I'm not used to seeing someone do a workout video in jeans. It just feels less authentic than other videos where they wear traditional belly dancing attire.

On the plus side, many of the moves are authentic belly dance moves. I simply think there are better instructional and workout videos out there, such as Luscious Belly Dnace Workout for Beginniners, which actually features some of the people in this video as well.",1218412800,2,1339,4.506172839506172
1980301,2,B000198C1Y,"I guess sometimes it's true; you get what you pay for.  If you're looking for a bellydance workout video and you're strapped for cash, this will do just fine.  That said, I watched this through once and worked out with it once, and I will not be revisiting it.

I have been bellydancing for three years, so the moves in this video are familiar to me.  I haven't really injured myself in dance class, practice, or performance since I was just a baby beginner.  However, somehow I managed to injure myself while following this video.  I hurt my back so badly that it interfered with my ability to do my job the next day, I was in so much pain.  I'm not sure exactly how it happened, but I suspect it has something to do with the fast pace of the video.  It takes a ""follow the bouncing [...]"" format, with little to no explanation of the movements being executed, very few reps of each move, and very little time for transitions.  It felt like a pretty frantic pace to me; I was trying so hard to keep up with what they were doing that I was sacrificing my good technique and posture to do so!

For exercise and drills, I'd sooner recommend [...] are just a few bucks more than this one, and are much more thorough and easy to follow along with.  They're worth the money for the quality of instruction and the fact that they do more repetitions of each move and explain them more thoroughly.

I did enjoy the music in this video.  It's not traditional bellydance music, but I enjoy the new age flavor.  I liked the outfits that the dancers were wearing, too.  I have other videos by Neon and I enjoy those as well (""Belly Dance Party"" and ""Belly Dance Surprise"").  This particular video just didn't do it for me, though.",1216080000,3,1718,4.355345911949685
1980302,5,B000198C1Y,"I personally do not think this workout is for beginners, as the dancers do movements such as ""lotus hands"", ""snake arms"" and ""relev"" without demonstrating first; if you already know what they are talking about, you'll be just fine!  The workout consists of the warmup (9 minutes), strength (8 minutes, lots of hip drops and hip rolls), sensuality (7 minutes, lots of arm movements and chest circles), joy (6 minutes, lots of bouncing and leg kicks), passion (3 minutes, hips and chest), energy (5 minutes, lots of shimmies), and the cooldown (6 minutes.)  The movements in all the different workouts were very fluid and the outfits were a visual feast, from the traditional chiffon skirt and midriff top to hip-hugging jeans with hip scarves and jeweled belts.  The music, World Music by Desert Wind, was fitting and inspirational.  You will definitely get a good workout, not ""bellydance style"", but actual bellydance.",1201305600,5,919,5.066225165562914
1980303,4,B000198C1Y,"I would not recommend this DVD for a beginner. It does not give instructions on how to execute the moves. If that's what you want, find something else.

For anybody who has mastered the basic moves, this might be a fun DVD. The combinations are nice and fairly simple, depending on your skill level. And, depending on your fitness level, it is for most a low impact workout. If you want to sweat, get something else.

Usually, I would not care much for belly dancers in jeans, but it does give a good view on the legs and moves. The white background does not distract and makes it easy to see the dancers.

I did not give it five stars, since the production does not seem well reheased. The groups of dancers don't seem to be in sync at all times and at times seem to be lost on the choreography. Still, it is a nice change of pace in a market that is flooded with mostly beginner DVDs.",1192406400,2,886,4.230769230769231
1980304,3,B000198C1Y,"Then this might be the ticket. The theme is *variety* on this fitness DVD. It is an inexpensive DVD and fun workout, but minus two stars for the very low production quality and highly varied skill level of the dancers. Some of the dancers do have excellent technique and polish, but this is a big departure from the quality and consistency you find with bellytwins or superstars DVDs.",1189555200,3,384,4.661764705882353
1980305,5,B000198C1Y,This is a great DVD/workout for an intermediate dancer.  It's the best bellydance workout dvd that I know of.  And my favorite dvd so far from the NY series (Neon).,1188604800,,164,4.433333333333334
1980306,5,B000198C1Y,"I bought this DVD looking to pick up the pace with my bellydance practice and workouts and it did just that! Unlike a lot of ""beginner"" videos (which there are an abundance of) which have the redundant monotonous cues this one relies more on YOU to keep track of whats going on. (For the individual with a year or two of bellydance experience this shouldn't be a problem, but beginners may not be able to keep up without extra practice.)

I like how the workouts are broken up with each workout more challenging than the previous. I also like how a different girl leads each workout - it keeps it interesting. I admit I had to get used to the music, which at times seems to be very pagan and goddess-venerating. I'm not pagan but the music is ok and doesn't distract from the workout. Once I got used to it, it adds to the mystery of the dance.

As far as the logo on the side of the screen; I didn't find it an issue. It didn't hinder my view of the dancers. Note: this is not a performance or instructional video, so the set is not elaborate and the costuming may not be ""authentic"" or the women not ""perfect"". But I bought this DVD for a good workout and that what I got. I don't need superfluous backdrops or supermodel perfect women in elaborate costumes and was surprised to see reviews commenting on these things. I thought the girls were attractive and good dancers with individual styles, they demonstrated the steps in a clear straightforward way.

I am in reasonably good shape and found myself sweating 20 minutes into this DVD. Its a good workout and best of all its lots of FUN!! Only negatives I have to point out are A) I wish there was an option to turn off the narration and workout to only music B) I wish there were some performances from the dancers as an extra like most other DVD's give you. I enjoy watching those!",1186185600,,1838,4.352769679300292
1980307,5,B000198C1Y,"I bought this DVD wanting to have a workout in the form of belly dance. I have dancing for five months now, so I know the basics. I WOULD NOT reccomend this for a person trying to learn belly dance. I just wanted a workout that used dance as an excercise so I could strengthen the muscles I use for dancing. If you want to learn bellydance, I would DEFINITELY reccommend Belly Dance Basics: Techniques for a SOlid Foundation by Jenna. THe only complaint I have about the Ultimate Bellydance Fitness Workout is that it uses (in my opinion) cheesy instructions in some parts. An example might be: ""Stretch your fingers and feel the connection with the living energy of the cosmos..."" Personally, that embarrases me and I would never want anyone to overhear me doing this video. Also, I wish this video would explain safety issues. For instance, they don't tell you to be careful to not release totally so as not to damage your lower back when doing pelvic drops (which they do in rapid succession). They have some fitness dude explaining heartbeats and stuff, but that is pretty pointless and made me feel like I was back in gym class. Otherwise, I love this DVD and would definitley reccommend it to anyone with a basic knowledge of belly dance who wants a workout.",1185235200,2,1264,4.597345132743363

The moves are a bit fast and a few of the moves are a little complicated.  All in all I would say give it a miss in favor of something by Rania or Jillina.",1176422400,8,260,3.625
1980312,4,B000198C1Y,"I loved this DVD! Great workout, very sensuous and spiritual and fun. I thought the dancers were beautiful and talented.

The two reasons I didn't give this DVD a perfect 5 stars are:

(1) no instruction beforehand on the moves

(2) that annoying logo that appears on every frame!

I have done the twins (Neena and Veena) workout for beginners and enjoyed it very much. I was ready for more of a challenge and this one is definitely that. Got my heart racing, that's for sure!",1176249600,5,476,4.5
1980313,5,B000198C1Y,"I have very basic bellydance knowledge and could only enjoy the first 3 segments of this workout when I started. Now that I've gotten the hang of it I adore this workout! If your shimmies aren't strong, you might have to modify a few of the exercises until you can get them up to speed.

To the reviewers who whined about the set/costumes/editing/attractiveness of the dancers: Get over yourselves. This is a fabulous and fun workout from strong dancers. The editing ""blips"" are the only (mildly) annoying bit, but once you know where they are you can look away and complete the movements. Yes, the voice-over will call out poses you might not know, but if you can follow a woman on your tv screen, you can do them all.

Have fun with it and you'll see results in no time!",1173398400,8,772,4.468085106382978
1980314,1,B000198C1Y,"The title of this dvd is misleading.  It isn't anything about fitness, more about the dancers showing off their moves and their costumes.  It's very hard to follow.",1173312000,3,164,4.821428571428571
1980347,4,B000198C1Y,I have tired alot of work out videos and this is in my top 10. You know you're in for a good work out when a video has a great warm up and this one does. Sometimes I use this warm up and then go to other dvds. They teach you the moves as best as any dvd can and they increase in difficulty levels. I still can't do the last one! Its a great work out and you'll have a blast doing it.,1168992000,4,383,3.5714285714285716
1980348,5,B000198C1Y,"I wouldn't say that I completely disagree with negative comments, but I feel that they are perhaps exaggerated.

First of all, most of the instructors on this video look very pretty to me. Even the makeup doesn't seem to be ""too heavy"" to me for the most part. As for their ""robotic"" or ""jerky"" movements and absence of joy, I think this is true only for the backup dancers (they take turns), but whoever is in the front is almost always energetic and sexy. It is weird that whenever they move to the back they don't perform as well as when they step to the front, but I think it's not difficult to just ignore the backup dancers.

Somebody pointed out that the music is accompanied by distracting speech (instead of singing), but I'd like to note that there isn't much of it - only a couple of times, and only for brief moments, and the speech is rather soft.

Yes, the production quality is not perfect, but I find it good enough for our purposes. The choice of moves is great, and the music is very beautiful, which certainly compensates for the lack of fancy background and some minor flaws in camerawork. Ideally, I wish there was ""music without narration"" option, but the narrator is not annoying, so it's not a big deal.",1168905600,,1227,4.46875
1980349,3,B000198C1Y,I was disappointed.  This is definitely NOT an instructional DVD on bellydance.  It was several segments of 3 women in jeans with bras or in tight black pants with bras doing simple bellydance moves.  I prefer an instructional or artistic approach to bellydance.  There was no effort put into pleasing surroundings.  All of the sequences are against a stark white background.  This DVD might work for if your reason for bellydance is to go to night clubs and bust a few moves.  The DVD menu selecter was also annoying.,1168646400,3,518,4.752808988764045
1980350,2,B000198C1Y,"I'm somewhere in the intermediate range of bellydancing.  I've been doing it for about a year and have taken a class and done a couple DVD's.  I am, by no means, an expert, but I am a fairly good dancer by nature.  And I don't care much for this one.

1.  The narration is useless.  The ONLY way to follow along is visually.  The narrarator will commonly tell you to go into some pose, or do some move, but she's using a name like, ""temple pose"" without explaining it.

2. There is no slow break-down of the moves.  I can see how a highly experienced dancer might get bored by that part, and therefore, enjoy the lack of direction in the DVD.  But some of the moves can harm your back and neck and there is no attempt made to teach these moves in a safe way.  I call that sloppy and irresponsible.

3. Eh.  Nothing moved me.  It wasn't horrible, but it seemed very low budget.

This is definitely an exercise DVD and not an instructional dance DVD. It was a disappointing gift, but at least I didn't pay for it.",1167868800,6,1011,4.192708333333333
1980351,2,B000198C1Y,"If you have a lot of previous belly dance experience and/or you naturally have fantastic body kinesthesis then you will probably gain something from this video.  However if you've never taken a class to at least learn the basic moves and learned them WELL, you will probably be disappointed.

I've taken classes before but I don't have great body kinesthesis and in reality never will so I found this dvd to be too difficult to follow.  All the sections besides the warm-up are very fast paced with no instructions whatsoever.  I don't even think they warn you about what movement is coming up next, they just do it.

Honestly, I don't think the dancers on this particular dvd are very good in and of themselves. When I think of belly dancing, I think of sexy, sensuous, flirty fun.  These women were like robots with herky-jerky movements.

All in all I didn't care for this one. I ended up giving it away so I could stop feeling guilty for wasting my money. I gave a rating of two stars because someone with experience or who is naturally inclined will get a good workout, I just can't vouch for how much fun they will have while doing it.",1165190400,8,1141,4.509708737864078
1980352,4,B000198C1Y,"I am confident in myself and my body that once I master the initial moves...everrrrything else will fall off (weight) and into place (sculpturing my body).

And yes...I am mixing BellyDancing with other types of Cardio sessions.

You MUST believe in yourself. I am a beginner but I am a SEXY BEGINNER and while I am not exactly obese, I am what ""Anthony Hamilton"" calls 'Sista Big Bones'.

As a 40 year old woman...I carry it well...but our bodies if left unattended (just like a man for example)...will leave us.

BellyDancing is an art form in which the first rule that should be taught is 'self-esteem' (confidence). It is common sense from the moves alone that you must feel this.

I am not calling anyone a dummy if this is not realized or a person does not 'own themselves'.

What I am saying is, if you don't have this you will ultimately give up. I have never tried this b4--but I am and I will be good at it.

DAMN GOOD for I feel beautiful as we all are.

Now--while I haven't used this video yet...I ALWAYS sit and view instructional exercise DVD's first (at least 2wice) b4 I actually start performing them.

For me this does a few things:

1) Minimizes frustration. Frustration...is definitely a motivation killer.

2) It gives ME somewhat of an 'imprint' in my memory of the whole routine
  so to minimize stumbling with the direction the body is going.

3) I get an idea of level of difficulty so I an prepare myself mentally.
  Lets face it...other feedback is great but they are based on one's own
  experience. Some are fast learners and vice versa.

Number 3--is most important because after viewing the DVD, my conclusion is: I am VERY,VERY excited about the 'WORKOUT' which will be good for me but only AFTER--I get an instructional video on the basics. In the case of bellydancing...trying to walk b4 you crawl...is not in your best interest here.

The instruction format on the DVD is nicely laid out into sections with a different instructor for each.  I am choosing a beginner course with ""Neon"" as the instructor because of this.  I like the way she moves and she seems to enjoy it.

The music is good but the 'set' is lacking and could be a little more 'decorated' I suppose for visual effect.  That is minor though.

I am very excited about learning this art and you will be too, if you follow the little bit of advice I offer as well as others.

Good luck you sexy thang you!...Believe that.",1161561600,2,2420,4.518433179723503
1980353,4,B000198C1Y,definitely not for beginners. The pace is fast and the dancers don't spend any time on instruction. For a more experienced dancer it is a fun way to practice your moves. The different dancers featured all have their moments to shine.,1160352000,4,233,4.7073170731707314

The outfits that the dancers wear are very cute and will also give you some neat ideas on how to turn ""club wear"" into eye-catching belly dance costumes.

I would definitely reccommend learning at least the basics before attempting this workout, however, as it is definietly NOT an instructional DVD. The only complaint I have is that I wish the music was louder as compared to the voice-over direction. All in all, a great workout, well-presented.",1151280000,7,504,4.872093023255814

I don't recommend it for beginners because you should already know how to dance it in order to work with your flexibility. This film is right for me because I can dance it and I'm flexible enough so now I'm using it for fun! I must say I LOVE THE SPIRITUAL MUSIC in it! It helps me with the movement!

1980402,5,B000198C1Y,"I would not recommend this for a beginner because there are no breakdowns of the movements and trying to keep up could cause a beginner to learn movements inaccurately.

BUT for someone familiar with basic bellydance moves- this is the perfect workout.  It is constant movement and at a challenging pace.  What I love about this dvd is how each stretch and movement all have physical purpose but flow from one to the next in a continual dance- which is what a lot of bellydance workout dvds lack (we want to workout but we also want to dance- it is bellyDANCE afterall, right?) When there are constant breakdowns and pauses between steps, the intermediate dancer can get bored and fail to work up to cardiovascular benefit.  This dvd will get you sweating but it is so much fun, you won't even notice till you are done.

The warm up and cool down on this dvd are especially good, in my opinion.

The only drawback would be the filming is a little low budget and the music is not for everyone.  It is not your classic middle eastern tunes, it is music by Jehan.  The beats are really great but the talking in the music is something I could, personally, do without- the statements are affirming but some of the things she says were... well, like: ""I (pause pause) am fire (pause pause) burning (pause pause) burning (pause pause) in your heart"" If she could have sang these lyrics instead of just say them, it might not sound so odd.  But that has nothing to do with the workout- I still think it is a really great dvd.",1144454400,10,1517,4.447653429602888
1980403,4,B000198C1Y,"I just finished my second go at this dvd. I got a great, heart-pumping, body-stretching workout.

If you have never bellydanced before, this workout is not for you. Get Neena and Veena's 'Discover Bellydance' Series to learn basic moves, then move on to Jillina's 'Instructional Bellydance', then this dvd would be appropriate. A beginner/intermediate should do fine with this.

The dvd begins with a warmup, then about 30 minutes of workout-dancing, then a cooldown.

I loved the cute, creative costuming and the modern-based-on-tradition style of this dvd. There is no dance snobbery here. You feel welcome to continue to dance joyfully and enjoy your workout without feeling like you're preparing for a dance competition. The background music is fun and a little goofy at first, unless you are a Goddess worshipper, but you get used to it and it becomes part of the feminine ""power"" of your dancing.

I really liked that there were other dancers and body-types in every part of the dvd. It gives you an appreciation as to what the same dance looks like on longer legs, curvier body, etc. (Every dancer is fit and slim, mind you). I also got a taste of other dancer's ""vibes"", for consideration into other dvd's. For example, I mis-judged Neon's flashiness on her dvd covers and never bought any, now i realize i was wrong, and can't wait to pick up some of her dvd's. (Never judge a dvd by it's cover...just like mom used to say:)

Like pretty much every dance dvd I own, the only real problem here is the camera should have the legs and feet in pretty much every shot, and it is occasionally confusing as to what is happening below the thighs. This is only a very occasional issue. This is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Ultimately, a refreshing and fun workout.

If you have taken classes or learned the moves before hand this is a great way to practice the moves and get your heart rate up.  It is very modern and not traditional at all.  I would be cautious about trying to learn from this DVD since is never mentions the importance of proper posture and you could easily hurt yourself.

1980406,2,B000198C1Y,"This is a workout DVD, not an instructional.  It really is meant for those who already know the different between a hip lift and hip drop, a hip twist and a hip pivot.

The positives:  The length is quite decent for the price.  I like the segments it was broken up into.  The dance steps are done in a logical sequence that allows for good transitions.  Instructors can get ideas for teaching moves in a combination with a cardio effect.  It is a workout.

The negatives:  My BIGGEST complaint is the cueing, or lack thereof.  If you look away from the screen, you are lost.  There is no advance cuing--it took me watching it several times before I could follow along without hanging on the TV set to see what each forthcoming move was.

The details/aesthetics: The costumes are very modern--if you are looking for the bra/belt/skirt combination, or if you are offended by dancing in jeans, this is not for you.  It also uses untraditional Middle Eastern Music, and instead, the music of the talented Jehan.  This is fine--except many purists want something with a recognizable bellydance rhythm. The music is very produced and New Age, no tabla involved.  You must understand the moves before trying this video--they're glossed over and deep understanding of the move, or a muscle understanding of the move, isn't addressed.

I'd recommend this tape to those who have had a session of classes and want to stay in shape for the next session, or as a warm up for a workshop--I would not recommend this to a beginner, or someone with a minimal understanding of the moves.

HOWEVER, having said that, I do strongly recommends Neon's crash course and her DVD's.  If you have done those, this tape is a nice review.",1141689600,7,1710,4.681208053691275

What it did do for me was help me begin to add stamina to my dance, and to begin to layer my shimmies with other moves.  It gave me a good support for what I was already doing in my bellydance classes.

I am so glad that this was not my first belly dancing video because I probably would've given it up before I started.  This was only played once and I will now give it away.

I've taken some classes and worked with Veena and Neena's DVD series.  This workout isn't for the complete beginner.  What I like is that it gives me moves to work towards doing.  It also has plenty of moves that I can do or have finally been able to do. This workout has given me a really strong core and it gives a pretty good cardio workout.  I am always dripping by the time it is over.  It's not a long workout--40 min.  It is perfect for me because I have a toddler and that's about all I can squeeze in.

So, if you are looking for a workout that will strenghten your ""core"", help you drop a few pounds, and want to have fun with belly dancing moves--this is for you.  Also, you should probably have a little background in belly dance. I only gave this 4 stars because, well, the music is just soooo cheesy.

1980458,5,B000198C1Y,"I have only been using dancing DVDs for 2 years with no prior attempt to dancing before that. I still lack the ability to grasp new dance techniques easily. I have most of Neena & Veena, the bellydance twins's DVDs, two of the Goddess Workout ones, and only one Rania since she is way too stiff. With that help, I had no trouble with this DVD at all. This DVD is meant for keeping your heart-rate up & keeping the music always present. The music is very beautiful with a nice beat, but light & spiritual as well with subtle female singing.

Every move is done in 1/2 time several times before moving on to normal speed w/naration over the music. Since most instructional DVDs are slow, most times w/o music & barely repeat more then a few times, this is a refreshing change for when you just want to practice & get your heart rate up w/o stopping. There were a few moves I had not previously been able to master, but have through this DVD such as pelvic lifts & pelvic rolls. There are some more advanced ones I have trouble on, but I just do the best I can & keeps me inspired to keep trying.

There are separate chapters by mood such as: joy, sensual that work on different body parts. The Ultimate on left side was distracting at first, but easy to get used to. They are always dressed in jeans or gothic wear, but you can still easily see how to move the body. Many of the dancers on this DVD went on to make their own or are well known & have performance DVDs.

The warm-up & cooldown are 16 min of very slow bellydancing moves & stretching. The warm-up & cooldown in only a FEW spots of the whole DVD lack naration for the forward bends, but that's it. The regular workout is 28 min but feels like longer since it never slows down to a crawl/break.

I wouldn't recommend this as a first bellydance DVD at all, but maybe a 3rd or 4th, try using the bellydance twins Neena & Veena (there are trailer's for their dvds at collagevideo.com

BTW, I don't mention the set or how people look, because I only care about the talent of the instructor, how well they teach & the content. Most directors & producers screw things up by putting up cheesy sets & almost all have camera zooms & angles that take away your ability to see/learn. This DVD at least has one of the least camera problems then most of my 20 yoga, 15 latin dancing, 5 hula & 14 bellydancing DVDs. I am especially agast at A. Kite's ""boardgirl148"" reviewer who has the audacity to complain about the dancers' facial beauty. That shouldn't matter, I'd rather learn from an ugly instructor w/talent then a gorgeous one who has none. If anyone really cares, I do think the makeup was put on way too heavily & it distracts from each dancer's unique beautiful facial features.

I recently found a link to their main site which has a trailer & screenshots for this & a couple other of their DVDs: worlddancenewyork com/catalog/wbfw html",1110758400,108,2894,4.369888475836431
1980459,3,B000198C1Y,"The Ultimate Bellydance Fitness Workout DVD is titled hyperbolically.  Although I agree it is not a bad workout, there are better dance workout videos on the market.  Better videos have even been produced by the same company.

The video has several problems.  First of all, it's described as being appropriate for all levels of fitness/dance.  This is not true.  Few of the movements are explained, and some of the movements (like the head spins) are downright dangerous if done incorrectly.  Since no explanation is given, I wouldn't be surprised if people haven't already wrenched their necks badly.  I would never recommend this video for a beginner, but only for someone who already has a strong foundation in Middle Eastern dance.

Secondly, dance jargon is used in the video without benefit of definitions.  Ballet terminology is used without explanation, and is meaningless to those without classical dance backgrounds.

The voice-overs are often off-putting.  There are times when Jehan counts time with the music, and her rhythm is off.  Or she'll describe a move at a different rate to what is being done on screen (eg.  she'll be saying hip hip step while the dancer is doing some other combination).  This is very confusing.  It might be easier to do the video without the sound.

Next, the focus is very New Agey.  This may appeal to fans of Dolphina, but for more secular dancers and fitness aficionados, it is a turn off.

Most annoying of all are instances when a movement is described, but not shown.  A prime example would be a bouncy folkloric step in which the foot and legwork are not shown.  The feet and legs are integral to the movement, but are shown only fleetingly, and partway through the video segment.  This is bad camerawork and direction.

The video extras are not of the best quality.  One of the biggest problems is the onscreen text.  It is very blurry, and sometimes impossible to read.  I was going by guesswork on a few things.

The DVD also includes a dance prayer which is more silly than inspiring.

Generally, the costuming choices are good.  However, at the very beginning, Jehan is wearing a lovely, flowing skirt which obscures what her legs are doing.  Also, several dancers are wearing denim, which I don't think is the most comfortable choice, but at least it doesn't obstruct the view.  That's just a matter of taste, I guess.  The dancers are all very easy to see against the white background.  It's nice to see an uncluttered and distracting set.  However, the name of the video is branded down the left side throughout the workout, and that's pretty annoying.

On the plus side, anyone who does this video all the way through will be getting a good cardio workout.  The warmup and cooldown are solid (aside from the head flinging), and if you keep practicing with the video, your hipwork should improve.  The dancers are competent and have good camera presence.  Also, the music is interesting and works well with the workout sections.  The video has its flaws, but being boring is not one of them.",1110672000,20,3050,4.792307692307692
1980460,5,B000198C1Y,"I LOVE THIS DVD. It keeps you moving without doing the same thing over & over. I have the Twins ""SLIM DOWN"" & that got old after about 4-6 months. Each chapter last about 5-8 min so you are never bored & there are tons of moves to learn from.

My ONLY suggestion is that if you know nothing about bellydance, get a beginner DVD before becuase this does not explain how to do the moves it just tells you when & how many to do. The instruction is good, comstumes are awesome. The music is nice & it matches to each chapter very well. I have several workout DVD's (Veena & Neena Slim Down) & this one is by far a better workout & it taught me a ton of moves that I have never seen before.

My advice...

BUY THIS DVD, you won't be sorry.",1105488000,13,734,3.979591836734694
1980461,5,B000198C1Y,"I'm not a dancer, but I buy dance workouts because I get bored with the regular ones.  They don't keep me motivated to exercise.  This DVD is the interest holding champion! It's a workout and a dance class combined, it's fast-paced, really the closest thing to real dance but still a workout. I particularly appreciate this DVD for teaching me to shimmy! It makes you try the shimmy at so many angles, that my body just found the position that works for me. It has a driving force that keeps me focused and intrigued with what I'm doing. Some weightloss videos are so monotonous that I lose alertness. I REALLY don't agree with the reviewers who criticize the instructors' makeup or the backdrop:  If you are really working with this DVD (and it makes you work very hard!) you WON'T be thinking about that.  It's all I can do to keep up the workout and TRY to do the moves as beautifully as the instructors do. The white floor and walls are just totally New York professional dance studio.  You can see dance studios through their windows downtown in NYC that look exactly like this DVD.  So doing the workout is like being in a pro class  in New York - that's what it is for me every time.  Those artificial ""sultan's palace"" videos are very colorful, but they're distracting.  They show the background so much that sometimes you can hardly see the moves.",1099612800,21,1356,4.524590163934426
1980462,2,B000198C1Y,"Let me start by saying that I will continue to use this workout DVD occasionally, because the workout was OK, but I was not impressed.  Here are the things I did not like:  1) the word ""Ultimate"" is displayed along the left side of screen during the entire workout, which is distracting & takes up quite a bit of room; 2) I did not like all the chanting, though the music itself was alright; 3) the DVD looks cheaply made, meaning that the camera is unsteady & a little out of focus at times, plus there is just a plain white background; 4) NONE of the movements are ever explained, they are just called by name -- I have done some bellydance videos before, so I could usually figure out what to do, but there were a few times when I really couldn't determine how to do what they were doing; 5) the workout is not really challenging -- I didn't even break a sweat (though it does require some coordination); 6) the camera did not always focus the area that was being worked -- I mean, if I'm being told to do something w/ my legs, and the camera is focused the instructor's face or upper body, how am I supposed to know if I am doing it right?  And last but not least, and I know this will sound fickle, but the appearance of some of the instructors was just not what I would expect -- the ladies were, at best, average looking (as most of us are), and that is all I'm going to say about that.  This workout seems to focus more on the spiritual aspect of bellydance, as opposed to just the straight out physical benefits, and I am more interested in the seeing physical results.  If you want results, I would recommend some of the workouts by Veena & Neena or Rania, as those are, by far, much better workout routines.",1088985600,44,1718,4.241590214067278
8008324,2,B000198C1Y,The dance routine and music are great but the moderator announce the next move After the dancers have already moved on which causes confusion and loss of flow. I like the moves but it's hard to follow so it ends up not being fun.,1512604800,,229,4.2272727272727275

8008328,4,B000198C1Y,"As follows is the workout:
Warm-up
Strength
Sensuality
Joy
Passion
Energy
Cool Down

The workout from warm-up to cool down is 44 minutes - (the warm-up is 9 min. and the cool down is 6 minutes).

There is a pause between each section as they have a scene change so you have to wait a bit for the next one to start.

I found it easy to do except for the layering a shimmy on other moves.  I have been belly dancing for over a year now.

For absolute beginners it would be difficult as there is no tutorial.

I didn't do the warm-up I just clicked onto the first section, strength and the dvd doesn't keep playing you have to click onto each
section individually, so then the next time I clicked on the warm-up and scene skipped then it played all the way through.

They filmed up close to the instructors - sometimes I missed some moves because they zeroed in on the hips etc so I couldn't see
the feet.

It was performed with a workout in mind ie, four steps to the left then clap then back the other way four steps the clap to
change direction - and the moves are done hard rather than flowing - I suppose to try and keep the heart rate up to get fit?

It is all belly dance moves, which is good.

I was a little bit disappointed with this dvd, I was hoping for a longer workout 40 to 45 minutes with more of a dance feel as it felt
more like a workout - I like to exercise in a way that doesn't feel like I'm exercising - I want to feel like I'm dancing.

It's still a good dvd to have once you can already dance.  So enjoy",1396483200,,1525,3.9966996699669965
8008329,4,B000198C1Y,"This DVD gives you a good workout while exploring the sexier side of belly dance with a heavy dose of cheese.  Sample song lyrics:  ""I am a priestess--dance is my prayer!  I am a vessel of abundance--life is my dream"".  You will get a workout with this DVD beyond the eye-rolling, though.  No Middle Eastern culture, technique, or a breakdown of the moves is offered, but it does provide a great variety of moves for a fun, sexy workout.  This is a great low-impact workout for intermediate dancers who know their relevs from their plis as well as their shimmies.",1392163200,,563,4.58
8008330,2,B000198C1Y,"Totally ridiculously to me.  It felt very dated, in terms of film quality and setting/clothing.  There was nothing here that felt like a workout; the pace and movements are much too slow to increase your heart rate, and building from the prior move to the new ones were too far apart to even consider it at an anaerobic level.

Visually, the video varied from close up to far away, and the ones at a disadvantaged viewpoint make it difficult to ascertain exactly what the movements involved, so there are times when you feel like you did nothing but squint at the screen trying to figure it out, before they move onto the next one.  The belly dance movements themselves are extraordinarily basic; something I think anyone could pick up from simply reading book.  If either end (the workout or the dancing) had been stronger, they could have carried the video's purpose, but neither were anything special.  I wish I had something more positive to say, but my advice would be to look elsewhere for persons interested in one of both of those niches.",1385510400,,1046,4.688524590163935

8008332,4,B000198C1Y,"I own a couple of other bellydance work out videos. I enjoyed this one due to the fact that it doesn't repeat the same move over and over again like other work out/instructional videos, making it feel more like you're just having fun dancing. That being said, I wouldn't recommend this video to someone who hasn't been introduced to basic bellydance moves. I'm still pretty novice myself, but I understand the basic mechanics of bellydance moves and was able to follow along pretty easily. For those who don't have a bellydance background, the moves aren't broken down and explained like you might find in other videos more directed towards someone with no exposer to this style of dance. An additional issue for the inexperienced person, is that they often move on to the next dance move pretty quickly, not giving you much of a chance to learn new moves if you don't already understand them. I found some of the music a bit corny, but all in all, I will enjoy having this in my repertoire of work out routines and would recommend it to other bellydancers.",1356912000,,1057,4.657754010695188
8008333,4,B000198C1Y,"This workout is challenging if you're not familiar with basic Belly Dancing moves. BUT, in general...this DVD is a lot of fun! Its a pretty good aerobic workout and you'll learn some choreography. I highly recommend it if you're comfortable in your own skin and enjoy Belly Dancing. The video quality isn't great and if you're not a big fan of the genre you might find the make-up and comstumes a little scary. But once you get past that, it will fine tune your Belly Dancing skills and whittle your middle at the same time! Buy it! :)",1349740800,,535,4.469387755102041
