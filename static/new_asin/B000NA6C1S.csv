2763166,4,B000NA6C1S,"I am a Great Lakes sailor and know how rough the waters can be. However this film gives new meaning to rough seas. I found it fascinating and fun, especially because I have sailed a few of the lakes. Most people have no concept of their magnitude. Surf's up in Wisconsin?!!! I think it's great!",1216944000,,294,4.363636363636363
2763167,5,B000NA6C1S,"An excellent documentary for great lakes surfers or anyone curious or interested in those that surf America's inland seas. Up here 30-50 knot winds, powerful thunderstorms and blizzards are what bring the swells.  Then there is the freezing air temps, ice and just above freezing water.  Talk about surfing in adverse conditions!  The cover shows Stoney Point on Lake Superior, one of the best breaks on the lakes.  They catch a good winter swell there and bring in some pros to check it out.  It was cool seeing these guys braving a blizzard, the cold and ice to rip it up in Minnesota.",1212019200,,587,4.660194174757281
2763168,2,B000NA6C1S,"Watch this not-so-good documentary about surfing around the great lakes region for information only.
Interesting, but, not entertaining.
Informative, but, not insightful.
I would like to see a documentary about surfing the great lakes that was made by a documentarian with some actual talent.",1198713600,,292,5.659090909090909

8176123,5,B000NA6C1S,This movie was very well done! Love it!  Sound track was great too. Wish I could ditch work like some of these lake surfer dudes do whenever the surf is up on Lake Erie! Have to learn how to surf first though lol! Bucket list! Buy it you won't be sorry!,1435190400,,253,3.9607843137254903
8176124,5,B000NA6C1S,This is a wonderful video. No only watching these guys surfing but it has some wonderful video of the lakes.  I am a 73 year old woman who is thinking of taking a vacation to lake Superior & this video was very helpful. I enjoyed it very much.,1418428800,,243,4.0625

8176130,5,B000NA6C1S,"This movie was exactly what I was looking for in that it was something completely out of the normal. It has a lot unique footage of the great lakes. It also a compltely different surfing experience than that of the ocean and the surfers in it. It is really nice to see something different, besides Hawaii and all the well known surfing spots.",1243468800,2,342,4.444444444444445
8176131,3,B000NA6C1S,"lame.  Step into Liquid has the same guys in the same surf and does a better job in ten minutes than this does full featured.  Not to bust on those guys and all.  A good bunch of Lads, probably the mellowest and all around cool.  If I lived there, I'd probably want to hang.",1237248000,,274,4.018518518518518
