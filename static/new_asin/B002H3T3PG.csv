8370152,4,B002H3T3PG,"Ok pair of late 60's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no sub-titles) Blue Demon adventure films.  This time he's a wrestler and a secret agent on the side, working with a suave ladies-man agent and the agent's long-suffering girlfriend (also an agent herself).  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  The color and picture is very good.  Recommended for Mexican masked wrestler fans.",1463875200,,381,5.3
8370153,4,B002H3T3PG,"Both Blue Demon movies here deliver everything you want in a luchador movie. You got pro-wrestling, ladies in both good and bad outfits (all of which involve hilarious cone bras), bizarre villain plots, and lots of odd asides. I can't say I understand everything. My Spanish is not the best. However, you don't really need subtitles to get what's going on. The movies have a sorta cave painting primal quality to them. You get the point regardless of language.",1459900800,,460,4.8354430379746836

8370155,4,B002H3T3PG,"""Blue Demon - Destructor de Espias"" is one of my all-time favorite lucha libre films, mainly because it could have stood on its own as an entertaining movie in its own right without the masked wrestling interludes. It's easy to forget this in light of the Austin Powers adventures, but there were a lot of successful spy movies and TV shows in the mid-1960s that took the straightforward James Bond approach and added a degree of far-fetched self-parody that didn't quite become camp. Here, Blue Demon teams up with both Carlos East and Maura Monti in a clever film that stretches its low budget surprisingly well through some excellent set design and use of stock footage. The strong use of primary color is a reminder that a lot of low budget films were still shot in black and white in the 1960s, so if you were able to get a budget for color you had to really show off! As can be expected, the fight scenes are excellent when Blue Demon is involved. No, this isn't as good as a Sean Connery Bond film, but ""Destructor de Espias"" can hold its own against ""In Like Flynnt"" and Matt Helm series. It's well worth an evening's entertainment if you like the 1960s spy genre.

""Pasaporte a la Muerte"" isn't nearly as effective. It's talky, in an attempt to compensate for its low budget and despite having much of the same cast and crew as ""Destructor"" it just doesn't seem to have the same creative spark. However, the wrestling scenes actually constitute a subplot rather than just showing up roughly every 10 minutes as in too many lucha libre films. Still, this is a disappointing sequel that explains why we never saw these characters continue in future adventures.

This was really a tossup between a 3 and 4 star review, not just because the film quality is uneven but also because there are no subtitles, which is a pet peeve of mine with many low-budget DVD releases. Still, it's nice to get two films on a disc and presented with great sound and picture quality and since ""Destructor"" is so much fun I rounded it up. Get out the popcorn, and have some fun watching it!",1289692800,3,2075,4.545454545454546
8370156,4,B002H3T3PG,"The two films on this single disc are from a period when the Blue Demon was appearing in movies more as a secret agent than a superhero. They are both a lot of fun and are the equal of a a lot of the spy films that were coming out at this time during the 1960s. No,not the James Bond or Derek Flint flicks. More like the Matt Helm and Jerry Cotten movies. Actually these two Blue Demon movies remind me an awful lot of the Kommissar X series starring Tony Kendall and former screen Hercules,Brad Harris. Blue Demon plays the Harris role of the athletic straight man,while Carlos East has the Tony Kendall part as the suave ladies man. You'll find all the conventions of the super-spy movies here. You get lavish set pieces,improbable gadgets,gorgeous women and over-the-top action. Also co-starring in these films was Maura Monti a statuesque brunette of Italian descent who made movies with all three members of Mexico's holy trinity of pro wrestling(Santo,Blue Demon and Mil Mascaras).The one downside of this disc is that there are no English sub-titles so if you don't speak Spanish it may be a little hard to follow the plots. But I still recommend both movies. As I said before they are both a lot of fun.",1255651200,6,1211,4.585253456221198
