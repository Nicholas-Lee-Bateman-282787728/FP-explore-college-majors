8379864,5,B002T4QJBE,Such a great film....I once asked around at Seattle theaters where it was shown with Alan Bates  in The King of Hearts as a double feature.....answer was it was never transfered from 35 mm film to digital.  Someone must be able to find it in Scandinavia somewhere!,1487635200,,264,4.595744680851064
8379865,5,B002T4QJBE,"great movie, does anyone know how to be able to view it here in US. I saw it in Sweden when it first came out. It would be a cult classic if more folks could see it here. Anyone have a way of convincing Netflix or Acorn or Amazon to make it available to stream?",1483747200,,261,3.7636363636363637
8379866,5,B002T4QJBE,"When I was a young child, my mother took me to see this movie at the Neptune Theater in Seattle. I still remember most of the movie, even though I was only five or six at the time. My mother never found a copy. I still look from time to time. I guess we can't have it all.",1390089600,3,272,3.706896551724138
8379867,5,B002T4QJBE,"I, too saw this film in Portland Oregon at the very hip Movie House theatre in the early seventies.  What a great film, so magickal and timely even today, as globaliztion threaten to gobble up the world. I hope that somehow it makes it to DVD here in the States. It is just to cool a flim not to be available here.  If you get a chance see it.",1327536000,2,343,3.9565217391304346
8379868,5,B002T4QJBE,"If anyone is listening out there - re-issue this film on DVD in region 1 and 2 for all to enjoy.  It is a gem like no other.
It held me in a state of enchantment - over 40 years ago - and the feeling comes to me again whenever I think of it.
Like the lost love of your life - I don't know how it ha aged - and don't care.
A special film that deserves wide distribution - not to be limited to a passionate cult following - in both Sweden and USA.
For background info see wikip - great example of Hasse and Tage.
Can see bits of the film on Youtube in Swedish.  Youtube - download Chrome - enter Appelkriget - about 6 to 8 short scenes in Swedish.",1302998400,,645,3.8059701492537314
8379869,5,B002T4QJBE,This is an amazing movie and one of my fondest memories of early film exposure vs mass media releases!  I must own a copy someday!  I have been looking for years now!,1296950400,3,166,4.15625
8379870,5,B002T4QJBE,"This is an AWESOME FREAKING MOVIE. I wish I could own a copy!  I saw it at a science fiction convention almost 30 years ago and it's just not available anywhere, as far as I know.

Seriously want this movie.",1279497600,8,207,4.15
