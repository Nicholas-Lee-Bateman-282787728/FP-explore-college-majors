4642741,5,B005AX1XA8,"You can tell if you want to see or buy this movie by looking at the first scene.  A little kid is putting together a jigsaw puzzle of a nude woman, his mother comes in and freaks out, and he kills her with an axe.  If you laughed at that, as opposed to vomiting, I heartily recommend this movie.  Oh yeah, the kid grows up and kills a bunch of people on a college campus, blah blah blah, hilarity ensues.

Do you like ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""?  Do you consider Lucio Fulci a genius?  Does a movie that features both a chainsaw murderer and a kung-fu master sound not unlike the Holy Grail to you?  There's something for everyone here.  Female nudity, male nudity, naked chicks getting brutally hacked to death with a chainsaw, terrible dubbing...  If that doesn't sound appealing to you, well, you probably shouldn't be considering the purchase of a movie with a severed head on the cover.

It's not meaningful like Romero, it's not creative like Craven, it's not shocking like Tobe Hooper, and it's not a movie version of a Stephen King novel that bears no similarity whatsoever to the book.  It's just a bunch of unpretentious, two-dimensional people showering and getting killed with a chainsaw.  Not to mention a kid who looks like Steve Guttenberg getting more action than James Bond.  Good times!",1122508800,5,1308,4.6593886462882095
4642742,2,B005AX1XA8,"This berserk, little Spanish slasher film from 1983 was advertised with the tag line ""You don't have to go to Texas for a chainsaw massacre.""  Apparently, you can also go to Boston.

The mayhem takes place on a college campus.  Though the college itself is never named, we can probably safely assume that it's not Harvard or any of the other institutes of higher education one usually associates with Boston.  For one thing, there only appears to be a total of three professors at the school - one to teach anatomy, one to teach martial arts, and one who apparently teaches aerobic dance.  Luckily, there also appears to only be six or seven students enrolled in the college as well.  However, that number significantly declines when an unseen, chainsaw-wielding killer wanders over from the Dario Argento movie next door and starts cutting a bloody path through the (female) student body.

Detective Christopher George shows up to solve the murders and soon finds himself having to deal with several very obvious suspects.  The college's anatomy teacher is a suspect because he has a villainous mustache.  The grounds keeper, Willard (played by Paul Smith), has a habit of ominously fingering his chainsaw.  And, of course, the Dean is a strong suspect because he has an English accent and is played by former serious actor Edmund Purdom.  Actually, the strongest suspect would probably be Kendall (Ian Serra), a dorky student who is also the campus stud (it probably helps that he appears to be the only male enrolled at the school) and who happens to have talked with just about every victim within seconds of their own murder.  However, strangely enough, George instead deputizes Kendall with the explanation that, because of budget cuts, Boston doesn't have enough police officers available to patrol the campus; serial killer or no serial killer!  However, enough money is apparently found to send in an undercover cop (played by Lynda Day) who also happens to be a famous tennis pro in her spare time.  Some might question the wisdom of sending a famous athlete out to do undercover work but George has the foresight to ask Kendall to look after her.  Considering that every other girl Kendall so much as says ""Hello"" to over the course of the movie ends up getting killed minutes later, one might wonder if it's a good idea to entrust him with Day's safety...

Needless to say, Pieces is a bizarre little film and what little entertainment value the film possesses comes from trying to figure out if much of what happens on screen is meant to be satiric.  Indeed, Pieces has developed a strong cult reputation with those who think the whole thing is meant to be an elaborate joke.  Unfortunately, working against this possibility, is the fact that the film displays absolutely no sense of humor whatsoever.  Which doesn't mean that there aren't some good laughs lurking between the scenes of sadism and pain.  Consider the scene at the beginning of the film in which a roller skating student crashes through a window pane in an incident that has absolutely no relation to anything else in the film.  Or the way Kendall barks out orders at hardboiled uniformed police officers and the cops respond by doing exactly what he says.  Or the way one soon-to-be victim isn't the least bit disturbed when the black-clad killer follows her into an elevator, just happening to carry a chainsaw with him.  Or the scene every viewer remembers in which Lynda Day is randomly attacked by a Bruce Lee look alike who quickly apologizes and blames his actions on ""Bad Chop Suey"" before running off to never appear in the movie again.  Or the scene where all the suspects just happen to end up standing together as a group; each with a convenient excuse for being at the scene (except for Willard, of course, who seems to wander over from nowhere)....

The plot's lack of reality is strangely counterbalanced by the almost disturbingly realistic gore effects; indeed viewers whose knowledge of slasher films is limited to Scream and it's offspring will probably be shocked by just how strong the violence is.  Unfortunately, there's a nasty streak of sadism running through the film and since none of the victims are given anything resembling a personality, there's no emotional stake in whether they escape the killer or not.  Instead, it simply becomes a process of watching one person brutally murdered after another.  (Only one death, involving an improbably based waterbed, is really pulled off with any sort of style.)  Pieces is rated X for its gore and viewers should be aware of what they're getting into before they watch it.  Still, in this age of diluted, toned down, ""commercial"" horror; there's almost a nostalgic appeal to Pieces' misogyny.  It's a sleazy film with no pretense towards being socially redeemable and - to a certain extent - there's something refreshing about that.  As well, while most of the acting is beyond bad, the film does feature performances from B-movie vets Christopher George, Lynda Day, and Paul Smith who obviously understood just how to best perform such absolute nonsense.

Yes, Pieces is an amazingly stupid film but that stupidity makes it strangely fascinating.  Even those who hate slasher films can find hours of amusement just asking themselves, ""What were they thinking!?""",1117843200,3,5315,4.92152466367713

The film is not for everyone. It's very entertaining and funny, but some people just don't enjoy this type of unintentional humor. But I won't be too defensive, I love this film on every level. The story is amazing, and the actors have a off kilter seriousness in their hammy acting. The themes of this film resonant more than ever in our troubled times. I hope the world learns soon, but I won't be surprised if we remain blind to the many important lessons of Pieces. Prescient storytelling and excellent gore effects can go together.

4642761,5,B005AX1XA8,"On the surface this movie might just seem like some slasher that just simply serves to be something of a Psycho clone.  Upon further viewing one can see that it's kind of that but also Pieces is its own movie; make no mistake about it.  Indeed it does deal with a killer who was a rebel and yet a momma's boy from childhood to grown man and he does indeed grieve his mother's death even as he is the one that killed her as a child.  Beyond that this movie takes that Norman Bates-like element and goes another way with it.  The direction it takes is indeed different.

It all begins in Boston in 1942 where some 10 year old boy named Timmy is fitting together a pornographic puzzle in his room.  No sooner does his hard-a** mother barge in and threaten to burn everything pornographic that her son has.  Unable to handle being scolded and having his mags and such destroyed the boy grabs an axe and murders his mother in cold blood.  The police soon arrive to try and sort out what happened as someone close to the boy tells the cops of his aunt being the person to send Timmy to as the boy seems to be upset by his mothers death.  40 years pass and some darkly clad mystery person is rummaging through boxes containing Timmy's mother's blood covered clothes, a picture of Timmy's mother, and that nude jigsaw puzzle with some of his mother's blood on the puzzle pieces as the mystery person fits it together.  Soon a college campus is starting to lose female students to some mysterious killer.  As the police officers Lt. Bracken and his partner Sgt. Holden find themselves baffled they seek the help of a male student named Kendall and a beautiful undercover cop/ex-tennis player named Mary Riggs to be their insider people so as to help the cops trap the killer.  The possible suspects are the Dean, creepy and eerie Professor Brown, and Willard the groundskeeper.  They all have things about their personalities and mysterious behaviors that make them seem as if any one of them could be the killer.

Some Facts About The Film:  It comes from Italy. It was directed by Juan Piquer Simon, produced by Stephen Minasia, Edward L. Montoro, and by Dick Randall(of whom also co-wrote it), the other writer of the film is John W. Shadow.  The original title is Mil gritos tiene la noche translated to English that means A Thousand Screams in the Night or The Night Has 1000 Screams.  Musical score was done by Librado Pastor.  Cinematography was done by Juan Marine`.  It was distributed by Artists Releasing Corporation Film Ventures International.  Its theatrical releases were August 23, 1982 in Spain, September 23, 1983 in the U.S., and December 7, 1983 in France.  It made 2,032,311 in the domestic box office.  It stars Christopher George(Graduation Day), Paul L. Smith[Popeye, Crimewave, Maverick(1994)], and Edmund Purdom(Don't Open Till' Christmas).

This movie is just brilliant.  The pacing is comfortable in terms of its not moving extremely fast but not so slow that one would have a chance to get bored with it.  The musical score by LIbrado Pastor aka CAM is effectively creepy, eerie, has an atmospheric feel to it, doesn't overtake what's going on in its simplicity, and can go from calm and eerie tones to quite intense whenever the scene calls for it.  For sure the acting is bad but the performances by the major characters are indeed memorable.  The dubbed voices actually fit the actors that they're given to.  Many times the dubbed voices that are used for foreign movies is absurd and doesn't fit the actors at all so this is unique.  The gore is brilliant and realistic looking to have no trouble suspending disbelief.  Not Tom Savini gore but still holding its own and is beautifully done.  The intensity of the kills doesn't hurt either.  The cinematography and beautiful and masterfully shot.  The feeling of isolation with the rooms in the school and the dark and foreboding look to the killers rooms are effectively creepy.  The whole murder mystery element of this movie works as their is enough mysterious and in some cases odd and suspicious behavior to the characters that the movie keeps you guessing as to who the killer is.  The nudity is great also.  For all of this you get a gorgeous Blu-ray transfer that's cuts above any of the DVD transfers.  It has brighter colors, less confounding shadows, and has a more 3d feel to it.

A couple of my top favorite kills in this movie are:  The scene where the killer kills one of the sexy women he targets by stabbing at her on a waterbed.  Another one would we when he victimizes another sexy victim while she's showering as he slices his chainsaw right through her torso.

All in all, I would say that this movie was a tremendous masterpiece.  It features everything that makes a slasher great; as it has a killer with a traumatic backstory, brilliant and very realistic looking gore, great nudity, sexy and gorgeous victims, a genius score, a feeling of isolation with the setting, dark and foreboding rooms, a taut mystery that will keep you guessing, a nice body count, memorable characters, the killer has a chainsaw and wears a black and creepy outfit the pacing is nice and even, and besides getting 2 versions allowing the viewer to view the movie uncut and uncensored, and as if all of that wasn't enough, this set includes a second disc of bonus's, the movie's great score, a second disc, and best of all it has the best transfer ever.

4642763,1,B005AX1XA8,"One of the taglines for this movie is you don't have to go to Texas for a chainsaw massacre. It should be you don't have to go to Wisconsin for a cheesefest. Quite possibly the worst horror movie I've ever watched and I've watched many. This is considered a cult classic as far as I know. I almost started to buy it on a whim, but instead came to my senses and viewed it for free on YouTube. I wish I had my hour and 23 minutes back. Atrocious acting, atrocious special effects, absurd story line. In fact, the gore and blood in this is very tame by today's standards. Where did they find these actors and actresses for this? The local five and dime? Bad bad bad.... How this is as popular as it is is beyond me. This is coming from a child of the 1980's who grew up on 80's horror. I'm kind of surprised I never watched this one as a kid. Glad I didn't cause it might've ruined by love of horror. I like campy B movie horror but this is way beyond that.

4642765,3,B005AX1XA8,Movie is alright.  It tends to lean towards the boring side and each time a victim gets offed the movie becomes even more boring where as in other horror flicks it usually gets more interesting. Not here.  For the price if your bored and want to see an ok flick - this is your movie.  If you're looking for something to keep you up at night...PASS. Characters all seem like they drank warm milk before they went to shoot the scene. They all seem like they want to go to sleep as if they even know the flicks going to be a snore or it could be that it was shot back when character development was still in the development stages compared with todays actors.,1467849600,,656,4.232

I course it is a Spanish film with English spliced in.  There is an actual side view of a totally nude man and his male genitalia is seen which greatly surprised me.  There is also a couple shots during the movie of female genitalia as well.  The gore was realistic looking.  I just don't understand the hype according to the cover and remarks on the back cover.  There is one scene of a girl in the bathroom stall in the girls' locker room that was a little hard to watch and please, please watch to the very end and you will understand my reasoning on why this movie was a real let down.  The very end was so far fetched it made everything that happened up to that moment seem like a waste.  It ruined the whole movie for me.

4642787,5,B005AX1XA8,"From the hundreds of cookie-cutter slashers released during the boom of 1980-83 it takes something special to stand out, and PIECES has that indelible quality due to its shameless over-the-top premise, stinkingly bad dialogue/acting and implausible plot points that border on the ridiculous.

1942 Boston: a 10-year-old boy murders his hysterical harpy of a mother with an axe after she freaks out on him for assembling a jigsaw puzzle of a naked woman. Flash-forward to 1982 and someone on a University campus is dismembering young nubile co-eds in their attempt to stitch together and recreate the butchered mother. Is it the bearish gardener (Paul Smith Popeye) who gives everyone and the camera perpetual stink eye? Maybe the gay and closeted Biology professor who is constantly mocked by the bodacious female students who are constantly thrusting their mammaries at him? Or would it be the Dean--the only one who's old enough to have been alive when the prologue took place. Ya think???

The kills are pretty routine for the genre but you cant help but love this movie for its sheer ludicrous gall. I mean, NO ONE can spot a trenchcoat, fedora-wearing killer hauling a chainsaw around a college campus in broad daylight? Come on! A mid-film butcher knife attack on a waterbed, a Kung-Fu expert keels over after kicking Lynda Days gun from her hand, the infamous BASTARD! line reading, Detective Christopher George demanding his partner  Take some uppers or something!, PIECES has enough little bizarre moments to overcome any shortcomings.

The Bonus Features here include carry-overs from Grindhouse Releasings 2008 DVD including the live audience audio track from the 2002 Vine Street showing but if you already own the 2008 version I still recommend you upgrade for the MEMORIES OF 42nd STREET that features interviews with Lloyd Kaufman, Veronica Hart, 42nd Street Pete, among others as they wax nostalgic about the golden age of Grindhouse with anecdotes equally hilarious and disgusting that nonetheless make the viewer feel as though they missed out on something great had they not been there. And if that weren't enough, Grindhouse throws in a miniature replica of the blood-smeared nudie jigsaw puzzle seen in the film.

A slasher that definitely stands out above the rest of the pack, bestowed upon us in a lovingly-crafted package from Grindhouse, this Blu-ray is definitely worth the double (or triple) dipping for fans of PIECES.",1458345600,,2447,5.153652392947103

4642791,5,B005AX1XA8,"Back in the days when video stores were first hitting the U.S., you didn't have a lot of mainstream hits available to rent. When PIECES first hit home video in around 1984 or so, I was snapping up every Horror title that I could get my grubby little twelve-year-old hands on. Thankfully, I had rather oblivious parents when it came to film selection. That was when I first saw PIECES.

Let's get this out of the way: PIECES is stupid. Really stupid.

GLORIOUSLY STUPID.

It's the kind of film that you put on with some friends and have a good laugh. The pacing is insane and the gore effects and nudity are plentiful. Just don't expect any logic. You won't find it here. What you will find is delicious over-acting and a sense of gleeful abandon. As the tagline says, ""It's exactly what you think it is.""

Still with me? Then let's talk about the 2016 Blu-ray release by Grindhouse Pictures. Grindhouse doesn't release a lot of films. What that means, however, is that they lavish unfathomable amounts of attention on these crazy, often forgotten films when they do decide to release them. They gave PIECES a 4k restoration from the original negatives. Read that sentence again. They also ported over the excellent supplemental features from their previous DVD release. Because Grindhouse isn't a label that likes to sit on its laurels, they also included a very nice sounding CD of the library music used for the soundtrack and a feature-length rumination on the heyday of the 42nd Street grindhouse cinemas in the 1970s and 1980s. Finally, if you were lucky enough to get one of the first 3,000 copies of the Blu-ray, (I was not, sadly.) they threw in a small replica of the jigsaw puzzle that plays such a major part in the film.

In short, they care about PIECES. With the slow death of physical media, it's rare to see a studio who still gives a damn. If you're a fan of low-budget slasher films that will have you laughing as much as you are cringing, then you absolutely cannot go wrong with this release of PIECES.",1457395200,39,2022,4.605555555555555

4642794,4,B005AX1XA8,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Pieces""

1. This 1982 exploitation slasher film is so bad it's funny. Some people think it was made bad on purpose, as partly a spoof of other slasher films. The film is set in Boston, but filmed in Spain, so it doesn't quite seem like America. And of course, the dialogue dubbing is a little out of sync. It also has a strong Italian giallo flavor to it.

2. It starts out with a little boy (named Timmy, of course) putting together a jigsaw puzzle. His mom comes in the room and discovers that the puzzle is a naked woman. Mom freaks out that her son likes nude girls, and Timmy kills her with an axe.

3. Then the movie flashes forward 40 years, when someone starts killing women on a Boston college campus with a chainsaw, and then he takes certain body parts with him. Some female police detectives pretend to join the faculty to serve as bait for the killer.

4. It's not too much of a mystery as to who the killer is. The movie throws lots of suspicion on a couple of characters, so you know it's not them. But when you discover who the killer really is, you don't really care.

5. The female stars of the film were supposed to be professional tennis players, but none of the actresses knew how to play tennis, so a coach had to be hired to help them not look totally pathetic. Which reminds me, there's a lot of boobs in this movie.

6. Even though this movie was made in 1982, some of the gore effects are still pretty interesting. The stabbing on the waterbed was pretty impressive, as was the chainsaw killing in the elevator (which used a pig carcass)

7. The movie is 85 minutes long, which is about 25 minutes longer than it needs to be. There is a lot of silly and unnecessary dialogue, or aimless walking, just to serve as breaks in between the kills.

8. The final 30 seconds of the movie is one of the funniest and biggest ""WTF"" moments in slasher history. In my opinion, that scene (as well as the one that blatantly rips off The Shining) proves that the movie was not meant to be taken seriously.

9. Most people can safely ignore this film. Even a lot of modern horror fans will find the movie dumb. And it is. But for people who appreciate the history of horror, the grindhouse circuit, or just a good bad movie, you should add this to your list of films to see.",1455062400,15,2313,4.274599542334096

I wasn't sure if the information was entered correctly on here but decided to take a chance. I can now confirm that even though it is a British dvd release, it will in fact play on an American dvd player. Well, on my Phillips blu-ray player to be exact.

You can kill people with a bendy knife.

At anytime, you're likely to be jumped by a Kung Fu master

Tennis pros are really bad at tennis.

Discharging a firearm in an enclosed space doesn't hurt your ears at all.

After 20 years, blood is still REALLY red.

Having a net loosely placed over your head can render you unconscious.

Killers are BASTARDS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

80's slashers. I love, love, love this movie. It's ridiculously good fun.

I've seen the film many times since then and it's always been from a very rough print- complete with pops, lines, and color problems (and really, anyone who loves films like these is likely not bothered by that sort of thing), All that said, I wasshocked when I first watched this Blu Ray. The colors are rich and vibrant, suddenly textures and details I'd never noticed jumped out...but it still looks natural, with a bit of grain preserved.

Instead of putting a old film out for less than 20.00 they price it a 37.00 this is a foolish thing to do.  The local store that had this one had to send it back.  The movie itself is a giallo slasher and a ok one.  Christopher George died soon after this and he was good actor whose time on earth was way to short.  Here he is the best thing in this violent slasher film.  It's not up to what the great Dario Argento was doing back then. But it is worth collecting.

My favorite moments are the dean explaining one victims beheading as an unfortunate accident.  The way that none of the victims see a masked killer walking around with a CHAINSAW and don't seem to notice until it's too  late. The college  features classes in aerobic stripping and has water beds conveniently lying around for the  students.
