8417116,3,B004696M7G,Can anyone say why the price is so high for part 4? I got the other 3 sets for like $20 and the going price for part 4 is $99???,1367280000,,128,3.3
8417117,4,B004696M7G,"I really, only needed the second disc because I was replacing one disc from a second season collection.  The discs had no defects and played clearly the whole way through without skipping or freezing.  I got more than I wanted, but I did get exactly what I needed.  The price was reasonable; could have been lower considering the age of the series and that it was only a segment of the entire season.  Never the less, I got exactly what I was looking for.",1364860800,,455,4.380952380952381

8417119,4,B004696M7G,"I liked the first season a lot more, but this was still better than most of the giant robot anime I've seen.",1300147200,2,108,3.9545454545454546
8417120,5,B004696M7G,"This volume marks the end of the second season of one of the best Gundam series to be made in recent years, if not amongst ALL the alternate universe gundam series.

Great character & plot development, nonstop action, drama, and gorgeous animation.

This series does it all and still manages to juggle a massive cast of characters who are very realistic and mostly grown ass adults (unlike certain recent gundam series of the past) in a story full of political intrigue, taking original twists and breaking many Gundam conventions and tropes in a good way.

The final battle in the last couple eps is fantastic especially with the final battle between Setsuna and season 2 villian Ribbons Almark.  I won't give away the details but the final mobile suit battle itself is a delightful love letter to the entire Gundam franchise, going all the way back to the original series.  Fans will know exactly what I'm talking about.  Also couple the fact that the final battle is NOT conducted between the most powerful suits...but dredged up older ones.  Also fans of the japanese track and voice actors should be made aware the seiyuu of Ribbons Almark and what other Gundam character he's played in the past ;)

Great conclusion to an awesome series and excellent lead in to the Gundam 00 film: Awakening of the Trailblazer.  I've seen this movie recently and think the 50 ep tv series + the film make one terrific gundam story.",1298160000,4,1421,4.7439024390243905
8417121,5,B004696M7G,Only two seasons long but one of the greatest animes I'v ever seen. The special edition ones come with a manga based on the series. I was tickled pink to pick this up at the post office :),1296950400,,188,3.973684210526316
8417122,5,B004696M7G,"This is the fourth and final installment in Gundam OO's series. These episodes tie up a lot of storylines and introduce some major surprises. Some of those surprises tie in and tie up some storythreads, but there are a few that aren't. Those threads are left dangling in order to lead us to the wrap for the series, which is the original movie that we will probably get next year titled ""Awakening of the Trailblazer"".
  There is plenty of destruction and fighting going on, as the Innovators are trying to run the world, while Celestial Being, Katharon, and a group of military rebels fight the A-Laws for freedom.
  Some live, some die, and nothing is the same as it was. Watch it, and you will definitely not regret it.",1290297600,9,722,4.573643410852713
