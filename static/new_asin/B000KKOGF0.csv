8157808,2,B000KKOGF0,"According to the DVD this has German and English subtitles, if I understand my German ""deutsch und englisch ohne Untertitel.""  However, I could not get this feature to work. Instead we are stuck with mostly audible German, and English spoken in varying degrees of bad to worse (Kitten being most understandable, along with Udo Kier).  I couldn't figure out what on earth was going on, but it seemingly involved somehow an African nation attempting rocket propulsion and Udo playing a character who is a obsessive German military type who just happens to have a busty, lustful wife he's not interested in, and a buddy/fellow soldier who is his (male) lover.  My German is limited to a few vocabulary words, and the English scattered throughout just gave me a small clue as to what was happening. If you happen to be German speaking only, you would encounter similar difficulties as large stretches of dialog are English only!  Not sure who this was supposed to appeal to, I still think anything Kitten Natividad and Udo Kier are in has to be at least entertaining from a visual interest (meaning they just arrest my attention -- a sort of charisma); but here the director seems intent on covering both of them with various and sundry filth almost from the get go -- food, mud, and whatever else it's supposed to be -- which I always find disgusting.

Give this a miss.  I just had to see it, but it was an expensive indulgence -- plus you will have to have a region free DVD player that can decode PAL signal for your NTSC tv or monitor.",1324512000,2,1536,4.608058608058608
