3794769,4,B001U0HB5Q,"The story behind Killshot is actually more interesting than the film itself.  Originally filmed in 2005, the Elmore Leonard adaptation directed by John Madden (the Shakespeare in Love director, not the football guru that is) sat on the shelf and was subsequently subjected to re-shoots and vast re-edits, so much so that Johnny Knoxville's role as a crooked cop was completely removed from the finished product.  The end result however is that Killshot remains an engaging thriller, carried by the performances of its cast.  Diane Lane and Thomas Jane star as Carmen and Wayne Colson respectively; an estranged, soon to be divorced couple who run afoul of a deadly hitman named Blackbird (Mickey Rourke) and his young, recently acquired accomplice Richie (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  The couple enter witness relocation, but it isn't long before Blackbird and Richie are in hot, relentless pursuit.  Briskly paced and plenty compelling, Killshot often feels as if there are large moments missing from the film (and there are), as we see turns from Rosario Dawson, Lois Smith, and Hal Holbrook here for nothing more than what really amounts to extended cameos.  Still, the performances from Rourke and particularly the talented Gordon-Levitt make Killshot as good as it is, and in that respect alone, the film is more than worth seeing.  It should be noted however that despite the cuts to the film, there's no deleted scenes section, nor are there any Special Features on the DVD at all.  Maybe oneday Madden and the Weinstein's will release the film as originally envisioned.  One can only hope.",1243382400,17,1592,5.115830115830116
3794770,4,B001U0HB5Q,"Synopsis:  Armand ""The Blackbird"" Degas (played by Mickey Rourke) is a professional criminal who travels to the Detroit area to conduct some criminal activities.  He runs into low-life criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whom Degas takes a shining to despite Nix's reckless and sociopathic tendencies.  The two decide to engage in an extortion attempt on a realtor and inadvertently involve husband and wife Wayne Colson (Thomas Jane) and Carmen Colson (Diane Lane) into their schemes.  Well, after Nix is injured during the extortion attempt, the duo begin focusing on revenge more than the actual extortion.  Meanwhile, the story begins placing added emphasis on the deteriorating relationship of the Colsons, who prior to meeting Degas and Nix were considering divorce.  One thing leads to another and the Colsons have to seek witness protection to escape attempts on their life.  But not even witness protection will stop the criminals from trying to find the couple...

First off, I enjoyed the film because of it's setup.  The locations were excellent (my grandparents stay in Algonac, Michigan, so seeing portions of that and Detroit in the movie are awesome.)  I also thought the casting was excellent too; you didn't hate Rourke despite the fact that he was a violent person and Levitt's character was one you LOVED to hate.  The movie was intense but not entirely predictable like most action films are.  In the end, you have a movie that feels like an action-romance story that could be equally intriguing as either or despite how violent the movie is.

What bums me out is what we didn't see in the film.  The film wrapped post-production up in 2006(!!!) but didn't get to see the a wide release because many felt the story was confusing (and it can be at times; but this is a movie that's meant to watched twice.)  This lead to any and all scenes involving Johnny Knoxville (who played the role of a Deputy) to be removed from the film entirely.  I would have loved to have seen the uncut version of this film but for continuity purposes, this is the film that was provided to us.

All and all though, it's still one that's worth checking out and recommended to people who'd want to see what an action/romance film would look like.",1239321600,50,2252,4.853403141361256
3794771,4,B001U0HB5Q,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. There is a mafia hitman who lost a brother in a holdup (because of the brother's stupidity).

2. Said hitman is contracted by the mafia to kill an older boss (because they wanted an outside guy)-- but later they don't want to pay Mr. Hitman.

3. He runs across an obnoxious criminal that tries to rob him and whom he eventually befriends and that lets him in on a job.

4. While going on the job (extortion of a real estate guy), it doesn't turn out as expected and some Unfortunate Witnesses see his face.

5. The remainder of the movie is about the Hitman's trying to seek out these Unfortunate Witnesses so that he can kill them.

Review:

This was a good movie for an evening-- as in an evening rented from Blockbuster. But some parts of this movie were a bit difficult to believe. Or, I should say that they took a second viewing to understand. One thing is that he went back to his reservation (and this guy didn't look a single bit like an Indian) and found someone who he just happened to know and who just happened to know who saw his face durin a holdup. Another thing that is unbelievable is that a hitman of his caliber was worried about money.

Levitt's character was EXTREMELY OBNOXIOUS. Maybe this really was an example of good acting. Rourke's was also pretty good in his character.

There seemed to be a certain je ne sais quoi that made this film lose one star. But it is something that I would recommend to a friend.",1238112000,4,1469,4.3713235294117645

3794780,5,B001U0HB5Q,"Based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name, this is a dark (very dark) thriller.  A hitman for the Toronto mob teams up with a violent doofus who describes himself as a bank robber (his biggest score to date: $2700).  The latter (Richie Nix) draws the Blackbird, Armand Degas, into a scheme to extort money from a Michigan realtor.  The realtor is out of the office when they appear there and they confront, instead, Carmen Colson (a realtor) and her ex-husband (an iron worker), who have to join the witness protection program because the killers will come after them, having been seen by them.

They are relocated to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, but the killers locate them and, eventually, confront them again, back in Michigan, whereupon the couple are forced to fight or die.

This sounds as if it has comic overtones.  It does not.  This is not the Leonard of Get Shorty or Freaky Deaky.  This is pure noir, with threats, menace, and blood aplenty.  There are virtually no moments in the film when we can sit back and relax.  On the other hand, the basic plot is Hitchcock without the iconic settings.  Everyday people walk into a world of hellish violence and must, somehow, rise to the occasion.  That gives us some slight comfort.

Thomas Jane and Diane Lane are superb as the couple; Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the psychotic bank robber and Mickey Rourke the professional hitman.  Gordon-Levitt is hateful, to the bone, and Rourke is suitably scary, mildly sympathetic and chilling.  If noir is your thing, go for it.  Elmore Leonard never disappoints and neither does the director, John Madden.",1453507200,,1610,4.821167883211679

3794811,1,B001U0HB5Q,"Story not great. Movie made from story not great. Not up to Elmore Leonard's usual standards of colorful, complex characters that many times blur the line that separates ""good guy, bad guy"" or even bad guy but with some redeemable qualities. These characters just simply evil. One calculating, the other merely wreckless, neither with much in the way of redeemable qualities. One doesn't speak much, the other doesn't ever shut up. Plot more straightforward than most Elmore Leonard novels and mostly senseless at that.  Makes for one of the least interesting Leonard-based films that I have seen.

It didn't help that I downloaded the HD version and had numerous pauses for buffering and a couple of skips. My internet connection is fast enough that this rarely, if ever occurs. So not loving Amazon's no refund on digital content policy right now.",1401667200,,849,5.01418439716312

3794822,4,B001U0HB5Q,"""Killshot"" (2008) is a thriller/drama about a mob hit-man (Mickey Rourke) who inexplicably teams-up with a twerp psycho (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). They go after a separated couple (Diane Lane & Thomas Jane) who witnessed a botched hit. Rosario Dawson is also on hand as the twerp's girlfriend.

I've heard people go on & on about how this film had post-production problems, sat on a shelf, was re-edited and whatever else. As such, they say it doesn't flow well. Don't believe it. ""Killshot"" is a very professionally-made film and I never got the sense that the story didn't flow, regardless of what they edited out, re-edited or what have you. The story's easy to follow and makes sense.

Mickey Rourke is always a highlight even though he essentially plays the same character, which I guess most actors do. His character in ""Killshot"" is the same likable, brooding one seen in ""The Wrestler"" (2008) and ""Passion Play"" (2010) with the variation that he murders people for a living. Yes, that's a big difference and it does cause the viewer to disapprove of him but it's hard to hate him, unlike his two-bit partner. Somewhat likable or not, the Rourke character HAS to pay for his misdeeds (or should).

Speaking of the twerp partner, Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines here as a scumbag with almost zero redeeming qualities. Someone does something to him at the end and you just can't help saying ""THANK YOU!""

Thomas Jane is always a solid masculine protagonist as is Lane in the feminine department. The film is just as much about the potential re-establishment of their relationship as it is about the thugs trying to find them. But this is definitely a thriller/drama. You get a lot of quality drama interrupted by sudden and intense thrills.

The score's nice and atmospheric and there's a great song on the soundtrack (""Monkey"" by Low).

The film was shot in Port Perry, Uxbridge and Toronto, Canada, as well as Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Detroit.

When Mickey returns to the reservation, he finds out his grandma has died and he gets a cold reception from the tribe.

There are two subplots that are going on: One involves an ironworker who is also a hunter (Thomas Jane) with a lot of guns. He is splitting up with his realtor wife (Diane Lane). The second involves a slightly crazed youth (Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Richard Nix), with numerous anger management issues. He is attempting to extort money from a realtor. Rosario Dawson is his girlfriend.

O'Rourke is stiffed by the mobster who hired him to kill Holbrook. He inadvertently joins up with  Nix, that's ""N-I-X, not like Stevie Nicks."" in his quest to shake down a realtor. Things don't go as planned and there becomes a lot of loose ends to tie up.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a great psycho-killer. The movie seems to drag when he isn't in the scene. O-Rourke's character is incomplete. He never goes after the money he was stiffed and ends up lowering himself.

I thought we left all of the Caucasian mock NDNs back in the 1990s!

The plot of this movie was pretty nonsensical. There wasn't enough action nor wit to distract the viewer (if only momentarily) from the hole-ridden plot.

3794839,4,B001U0HB5Q,"John Madden's ""Killshot,"" though far from a perfect movie, deserves to be better known. The basic premise of an estranged couple on the lam from two killers--one a seasoned mob hit man, the other a kill-crazy punk--is familiar from countless previous crime films. Yet seldom has that plot worked better than here, because two genius-level actors, Mickey Rourke and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, play the killers. Both together and separately, they are mesmerizing. I don't understand the Bronx cheers some reviewers have directed at Gordon-Levitt's performance; the character he plays is way over the top, to be sure, but the way he plays him is breathtakingly appropriate. (Besides, part of the pleasure of watching such a character onscreen is waiting to see exactly when, where and how he's going to get his just deserts.) As for Rourke, his quiet gravity has seldom been so compelling or so menacing as it is here. His performance reminds us of the great acting he did in the 1980s, and makes us grateful for his career renaissance of the past few years in such films as ""The Wrestler.""

I didn't mind the complexity of ""Killshot's"" plot; this is an Elmore Leonard story, after all, and a little complexity is to be expected. What I did mind was that whenever Madden takes us away from the killers, and toward the couple played by Thomas Jane and Diane Lane, the movie loses momentum. Thomas Jane is a good actor, and good-looking, but generic; there's nothing distinctive about him. Diane Lane is one of my all-time favorites, thanks to ""Lonesome Dove,"" and she's wonderful in ""Killshot."" But her performance is much more vivid when she's being menaced by Rourke and Gordon-Levitt than when she's with Jane. It isn't just a matter of the plot situations; Rourke and Gordon-Levitt challenge her as an actress, and Jane doesn't. So, but for an error of casting, ""Killshot"" would be a forgotten masterpiece. It's still well worth seeing, thanks to Rourke and Gordon-Levitt.",1285804800,,1967,4.960606060606061
3794840,4,B001U0HB5Q,"An engaging thriller, Killshot sets up estranged husband and wife Wayne and Carmen Colson (Thomas Jane, Diane Lane) with some bad luck.  Aside from the age defying skin, perfect smiles, and bodies sculpted by personal trainers and dieticians, not to mention the genes capable of producing an Aryan prototype that would make Hitler involuntarily orgasm, they run into the combo of hitman with a conscience Armand ""Blackgird"" Degas (Mickey Rourke), who recently lost his brother, and sociopath underling/partner Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  The criminal pair is working an extortion job, and the Colson's happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Determined never to permit someone to see his face and live (which poses an odd morning bathroom dilemma), Degas and Nix stalk the Colson's into protective custody and beyond.

Overall, the film feels incomplete.  It comes as no surprise that there were numerous complications with production, and it took nearly three years post-production to offer it up.  It's as if entire sections of the script are gone, and it shows.  Thanks to the talented cast, however, the film stands up fairly well.  The mood and pace of the film is fairly even keel, leaving neither an acceleration to engage nor an anchor to lose the viewer.  In other words, Thomas Jane in every scene he's ever appeared.  Lane is beautiful as usual, but really never steps up to bat alongside Rourke; she's nearly an afterthought at times.  Together they are not convincing as a couple.  Rourke is as odd as ever.  At times captivating and others revolting, he's the wild card in any casting director's deck.  Gordon-Levitt, on the other hand, completely steals multiple scenes.  If there ever is a need for a ""borderline-inbred, sociopathic hillbilly with an inferiority complex and a hair-trigger""-role, then pencil in Gordon-Levitt right now.

While not perfect, the direction from John Madden is enticing enough to keep the gears moving without major plot holes, character flaws, or unnecessary plot developments that other directors think are clever.  Most of the time, they're not. Madden just provides the 90-minute meat and potatoes, which is exactly how the DVD is released (no extras), and how I feel about the film.  Good for a quick meal, maybe even enjoyable, but it's missing the trimmings to make it stand out.

The bad thing about this film was the usual mistakes made by characters in this kind of film. Gordon-Levitt's character is so annoying, it's basically a relief when his screen time comes to an end.

3794844,3,B001U0HB5Q,"I wouldn't miss a chance to see a film starring beautiful Diane Lane. And the film is based on an Elmore Leonard novel. In fact ""Killshot"" has an impressive cast including Mickey Rourke, Thomas Jane, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Rosario Dawson and Hal Holbrook as a cameo. But I never heard of the film (directed by John Madden, ""Shakespeare in Love"") until recently, and the reason is simple. ""Killshot"" is not very good.

Mickey Rourke is excellent as a troubled hitman Armand ""The Blackbird"" Degas thinking of retiring from his job. But when he encounters a psychopathic criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is hatching an extortion plot, Armand takes him under his wing. Ritchie's brilliant plan goes terribly wrong, however, when trigger-happy Ritchie mistakes a veteran ironworker Wayne (Thomas Jane) visiting for job interview for the real target. Moreover, Wayne's estranged wife Carmen sees the face of Armand, and one of his rules as a professional killer is ""never to leave living witnesses.""

A troubled production history notwithstanding, ""Killshot"" is not a total disaster. The storyline is disjointed and obviously the film is heavily re-edited, but the film still has original book writer Elmore Leonard's signatures - crackling dialogues and quirky characters bolstered by the competent works from the entire cast. Still the film's final act is a huge letdown and it is hard for anyone (including Mr. Leonard himself) to take the film's sloppiest Federal Witness Protection Program very seriously.

Certainly this is better than two recent disappointments, ""The Big Bounce"" and ""Be Cool,"" but ""Killshot"" is still a half-baked Elmore Leonard adaptation that could have been ""Jackie Brown"" with filmmakers who understand the original writer's unique worldview where violence and humor co-exist so naturally.",1264723200,,1825,5.396491228070175

3794848,5,B001U0HB5Q,"I'm amazed this film was 'shelved' for two years, as ""Killshot"", based on an Elmore Leonard novel, is a really terrific suspense yarn, with excellent characters, some engaging plot twists, and a nail-biter of a climax. It is certainly at the top of the class of 2008 in the genre!

While the premise (retired hitman is called on to do one more job, which goes wrong, and spirals into a chain of disasters), isn't a new one, you'll seldom see it played out with more panache. Mickey Rourke, as the half-Indian contract killer, is simply superb, his scarred, impassive features masking a man of scruples and a strict code of conduct; he is so good in the role, you actually sympathize with him, particularly when, after the 'hit', he bonds with a hyperactive, psychotic young bankrobber, who reminds him of his dead brother. As portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the kid is so 'over-the-top' that I thought the part was overplayed, at first, but as the film progresses, the contrast between the pair's personalities becomes one of the strongest assets of the film.

When the pair attempts an extortion con the kid sets up, not only does it backfire, but a couple (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) can identify both of them...which makes their 'elimination' essential, and initiates the 'cat-and-mouse' chase of the film. While the couple lacks the flashiness of the criminals, they are quite believable (both are facing personal crises, with Lane demanding a divorce, as Jane tries to find something to believe in, that will reunite them). Without giving away any surprises, I will say the plot takes a couple of very unexpected (and intriguing) turns, and you won't get bored!

Two supporting players are stand-outs; Hal Holbrook, in a very brief role as a mob boss, gives his character as much dignity as Rourke gives the hit man, and their scene together is terrific; and Rosario Dawson, as the kid's Elvis-loving mistress, will break your heart, she's that good!

Now, ""Killshot"" is not exactly an ""old movie"" at all; however, it has all the components of an ""old movie"":  Great plot and great people doing the acting and, apparently, the directing and everything else to boot.

I have been a long-time fan of both Diane Lane and Mickey Rourke.  I think I would rather watch and listen them read their grocery lists than watch a modern-day movie with a bad plot and poor acting.  Elmore Leonard also writes good books.  Man!  Put all of that together along with some really decent supporting actors and you have the ingredients for 95 minutes of great suspense.  And they pulled it off in an excellent fashion!

I won't give away more of the plot than the trailers show.  Suffice it to say that they managed to do in 95 minutes what a lot of today's films (and I like today's films, too) can't manage to do at all:  Keep the suspense, action, and thrills going without having to show someone's brains splattered all over the room.  There's blood, but then, there's BLOOD!  The director managed to shrug off the need for gore and concentrate on the plot instead.  Good for the director!  The actors/actresses managed to do everything they needed to do without over-acting their parts.  This is, in my opinion, what a group of actors who have been in the business for awhile can do with almost perfection.  This group managed that.

The story is a simple one, about a soon to be separated couple (Lane and Jane) who come upon an attempted assasination of a real estate agent by a half breed ""mechanic"" (Rourke) and his psychotic sidekick (Gordon-Leavitt).  The tension mounts when Rourke methodically plots their location even though they are under witness protection. I had an issue with the direction of this piece because I think director John Madden was the wrong choice to handle this type of material.  Perhaps either Scorsese, DePalma or Tarentino could've upped the ante on this film.  Anyway the cast is excellent with Rourke riveting as the silent, unassuming killer--this man can imply a lot with just a few gestures and body language. His opposite, Gordon-Leavitt, almost over-acted to the max as the psychotic sidekick but that doesn't deter from the impact of the film.

3794855,5,B001U0HB5Q,"Mickey Rourke stars as Armand Degas. Degas is a stone cold killer with a certain charm and sensitivity. The movie opens with him on the job as a Mafia hit man who doesn't believe in leaving any witnesses. In real life murderers are typically stupid louts, but we all know how much Hollywood loves the multifaceted homicidals. Degas emerges as something like, say, a monster that dances with its victims before invariably crushing their skulls. Of course, it's Rourke's acting genius that creates these images. He joins forces with a cheap hood, Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who puts the loose in cannon. Whereas Degas appears to have some smarts, Nix is a borderline idiot who enjoys running amuck. Gordon-Levitt put a lot into this role, but he could have ratcheted it down just a notch or two.

Particularly effective are Thomas Jane as Wayne Colson and Diane Lane as his wife Carmen. The Colsons are hunted by Degas and Nix because they ""know too much."" It was only by chance that the Colsons collided with the deadly duo. Now they face the fight of their lives.

It so happens that the Colsons had decided to separate, after fifteen years of marriage, just before they had their unfortunate encounter with Degas and Nix.  Even though Wayne comes off as a ""good man"" who bravely defends Carmen and desperately wants to get back with her, Lane perfectly portrays a woman who is just not having any of this reunion stuff. No matter what. Lane's performance ranks right up there with Rourke's.

A lot of the above is glaringly formulaic: bad bad guys chase good good people, and a marriage is on the rocks. This film manages to take those formulas and run. This is one suspenseful movie. Never a dull moment.",1248048000,3,1714,4.722408026755853

The movie has two strengths: (1) it adheres closely to the plot and even some of the dialogue of the novel; (2) Mickey Rourke is tremendous as Blackbird.

The book's ending is pitch-perfect; the movie ending keeps the basic structure but changes details and increases gunfire; the simpler book version had my pulse racing.  I found the movie's marital discord theme unconvincing.  In the book, the couple is happily married, which provides a nice contrast to the suspense.

One reviewer somewhere points out that John Madden makes for an unlikely director for this story, and that it was Quentin Tarantino who convinced the Weinsteins to option the novel.

When John Madden finally directed it, the finished product was shelved, re-cut, and delayed some more before quietly debuting. It's been said that Madden's original film was likely butchered during this process and no director's cut has been made available. Well, Killshot in it's current form isn't very bad. It's actually pretty damn good compared to the lukewarm reviews I've read for it.

2008's comeback kid Mickey Rourke plays Armand ""Blackbird"" Degas, a half-Native American hitman riddled with guilt over accidentally killing his younger brother. A chance encounter with eccentric, loud-mouthed criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) leads Blackbird to helping Richie get $20,000 from a real estate guy. Their plan goes awry when they mistake Wayne (Thomas Jane) for their guy. Now, with the police after them and both Wayne and his estranged wife Carmen (Diane Lane) having seen their faces; Blackbird and Richie have two relatively significant problems to get rid of.

The film's set-up and execution are nothing new for films in this ""crime-thriller"" genre, but it does have two memorable villains. Both Jane and Lane do exactly what the script asks of them. They play the confused, paranoid victims whose marriage is in shambles. But, this film belongs to Rourke and Gordon-Levitt.

Rourke is terrific, as I expected. What's really impressive is that many actor's would have taken a very wooden approach to this role. Rourke brings charm and vulnerability to it. Blackbird is not a sympathetic character, but Rourke makes you like him in spite of yourself.

Gordon-Levitt gives a high-energy performance, to say the least. Gordon-Levitt takes Richie beyond maniacal and goes over-the-top psychotic. Quite simply, he's overacting. I don't think any actor could play this role with even a hint of subtlety and he does create a very sadistic, unlikeable character. For some actor's, saying they were overacting would be saying there was a fault in their performance. Gordon-Levitt makes it work though. He's without a doubt one of the most talented young actor's working today.

Quentin Tarantino's longtime producer Laurence Bender produced the flick and author Elmore Leonard serves as executive producer which I think does show that there were people who had faith in the project. I think that if a director's cut were ever to see the light of day it wouldn't make much of a difference. I haven't read Leonard's novel and I've never heard anyone who has call it a masterpiece. I don't see this film being much better than it is now. Killshot is a well-acted, well-made, and entertaining crime film. It's not perfect and I don't believe it could be. However, it's not a waste of time and I think those who enjoy Elmore Leonard's books and 90s-era Tarantino films will find something to enjoy here.

And they're what really makes this film. Without him it's nothing more than a run-of-the-mill crime drama.

His subtle performance, including very believable physical and verbal mannerisms of Native Americans, really shines. Rourke completely fills his portrayal to the brim with the sad life of a guilt-ridden assassin who tries to move beyond and discovers he can't.

Nothing to fault against the cast. Who, collectively, produce solid performances, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt working up a decent psychopath. It's a bit overdone, but very respectable.

There are clearly plot holes which some viewers might find annoying - the laughable cardboard shell that purportedly serves as the US Marshall's Witness Protection Program for one.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is outstanding in his role in this movie, he's a natural and it shows, his character is a bad man, really bad and he nailed it.

A little action, alot of suspense, predictable if you watch or read alot of thrillers, but overall a great cast and a great story!

""Killshot"" was originally a book by Elmore Leonard, most of the movies made from his books are excellent, they are - ""Out of Sight"", ""3:10 to Yuma"", ""Get Shorty"" and ""Be Cool""!

3794866,3,B001U0HB5Q,"Director John Madden's film of Elmore Leonard's novel ""Killshot"" was shelved, screened for test audiences, recut,screened again, had reshoots and, ultimately, dumped on the market after being butchered. That's too bad because Madden's strong suspense thriller deserved better. Well made with taunt pacing and strong performances from Thomas Jane, Diane Lane as the estranged couple who witness an attempted extortion and murder by a jaded American Indian hitmman (Mickey Rourke in a terrific performance)and his hot headed partner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), ""Killshot"" breezes along at a quick pace (probably because an entire subplot has been cut and the film wittled down to less than 90 minutes)remaining suspenseful throughout its brief running time.

Sadly, the film doesn't get any extras nor do we get a ""Director's Cut"" with the excised footage restored. ""Killshot"" is an enjoyable thriller and it's a pity Madden's original version didn't get a chance to play in theaters or even on home video in its original form.",1244073600,9,1021,5.421383647798742
3794867,4,B001U0HB5Q,"Elmore Leonard on the Charlie Rose Show said character controls, plot second.  Offhandedly, America's most illustrious crime writer then voiced his rules for writing: never start the book with the weather, never write a prologue, never use any predicate other than ""say, "" or its close relatives, use characters to describe a scene and never use an adverb to re-enforce a predicate. In ""Killshot,"" his 1989 thriller, he gets this cold icy thriller to the screen  after twenty years.  A long wait,  but worth it to watch the youthful Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the psychotic and unhinged Richie Nix, heist the movie from a desiccated Mickey Rourke as Blackbird, the hitman, Diane Lane, the bleached out exhausted Carmen and Tom Jane, her hunting hero husband. Early in the movie, the viewer comes to appreciate how zany, Elmore's ride will be when Richie Nix comes to collect his money at the office of a real estate agent and all hell breaks out. No guns, no bullets, just mayhem as Richie loses it. I save the reader any descriptions. In an age when tumbling car crashes and senseless violence, ala Tarantino,  sate the savage beast of the movie public, this scene triumphs showing that good writing - good characterization- makes a more entertaining movie.  It is encouraging to see after so many mash jobs by directors that older novels by Leonard, now eighty three, can be brought to the screen and can prove worthy of his artistry.",1243728000,,1431,4.868312757201646
3794868,5,B001U0HB5Q,"Armand ""Blackbird"" Degas is a half-Indian hitman for the Toronto mafia. At a certain point while he is on the run he crosses paths with an ordinary couple played by Diane Lane and Thomas Jane. He believes that he has to kill them because they have seen his face and know that he is in the Agonac area. The movie traces the counterpoint between the couple who are coping with marital problems and the hitman who is attempting to elude the law.
There are several good performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Diane Lane and, particularly, Aldred Montoya as Lionel, an indian who doesn't want Armand back in the area. However the performance that is absolutely riveting, is that of Mickey Rourke as the hitman. His performance is so superior that by itself it moves a good movie to one worth watching more than once for the complex psychological portrait constructed by this very excellent actor.",1243728000,3,889,4.816993464052287
3794869,4,B001U0HB5Q,"Mickey Rourke gives a rather subtle performance as a hitman in this engaging thriller. He plays Armand ""Blackbird"" Degas who crosses paths with a small-time hoodlum/sociopath Richie [Joseph Gordon-Levitt] and takes him under his wing [as Richie reminds him of his dead younger brother, who was also reckless and a daredevil]. Richie asks Degas if he would like to partner him on an extortion scheme involving the owner of a real-estate company. When the pair go to the office, they meet Wayne Colson [Thomas Jane] whom they mistake for the owner of the company, and in the confusion, Colson gathers his wits and turns the tables on them, injuring Richie in the process. Colson's estranged wife, Carmen [Diane Lane] who works at the firm is a witness and Degas is determined to rid himself of the two witnesses, though Richie seems more vengeance-driven.

Events escalate out of control with the Colsons going into the Federal Witness Protection porgram, but the two criminals hunt them down, leading to a nerve-wracking showdown.

The acting is really quite decent, and given Rourke and Lane's well-defined acting skills, the overall quality of the movie is improved by their credible performances. Both Rourke and Lane share a strange chemistry that plays out well on screen, showing the shifting of power dynamics back and forth between them, like a cat and mouse game. Then there is the actor playing the role of the impulsive, rather foolish  young punk, Richie who succeeds in getting under viewers' skin with his performance as a totally out of control sociopath. Thomas Jane is also effective in his role as the enraged target and frustrated husband.

The cinematography is well above average, set during winter in Algonac, Michigan, with its snow-covered landscape, and serene beauty which contrasts starkly with the violence inherent in the film. The movie credibly blends in elements of violence, vengeance, romance and suspense and makes for an engaging viewing experience.",1243641600,,1984,5.13312693498452
3794870,4,B001U0HB5Q,"I almost forgot about this flick, seeing as I saw the first trailers for it back in 2006.  It was distributed and produced by the newly developed Weinstein Company(yes, after they left Disney with a good rep. they decided to release the ambitious and entertaining Grindhouse on Easter weekend, when an Ice-Cube family friendly crap-fest opened, those same Weinsteins).  They've gathered a lot of their old talent from Miramax(John Madden, Anthony Minghella, Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriquez) and commissioned films from them on their own company, but unfortunately most of them end up in either limited theatrical release(Outlander) or straight to video over two years later, like this film.  Usually when a film gets no theatrical run it indicates that the film is bad or mediocre, but with the Weinstein company it just doesn't hold true.

Apparently, this  dvd version of Killshot is the edited, non-director's cut of the film.  Johnny Knoxville was a main character at one point, and in the final film he's nowhere to be found.  It's based on an Elmore Leonard story, my favorite junk-food author, and that should tell you automatically that everything that happens in the film will be complicated as well as the characters' involved lives.  There's lots of strands involved in Killshot, which is basically your run-of-the-mill regular joes vs. the psychos story.  What seperates a Leonrad pulp story is the witty dialogue and interesting characters.  No one in an Elmore Leornad tale is completely perfect or good, they are many shades of gray.  This film keeps that from the original sources material and streamlines the plot, but it still works in a brisk hour and half running time.

The acting in this film is superb all the way around.  Micky Rourke, who is thankfully on the long awaited comeback trail after the brilliant film The Wrestler and will be completely vindicated next summer opposite Robert Downey Jr. in Iron-Man II, has the most complex and entertaining character.  Sure, he's basically the villain, but not a conjured from the bible figment of evil, but a human with a dark past.  He hints at a possibility of changing his ways, but his nature is too solidified in his older age for that.  He demands the attention of the viewer in this film.  Thomas Jane also is in the film and he is uniformly good as usual.  He has the least show role, and he plays it straight and believable.  Diane Lane plays his soon to be ex-wife and she, like Jane, is a reliable and believable performer. Why a good film like this with Lane gets shelved and dreck like Nights in Rodanthea and Must Love Dogs actually make the multiplex's is beyond me?

Special notice must go to Joseph Gordon Levitt.  Yes, the same kid from the sitcom 3RD Rock From The Sun.  He has grown into a really fine actor with varied performances in the last couple of years(Brick, The Lookout, Stop-Loss). He plays a putrid moronic character who is prone to outbursts of violence.  But he seems real, like a real A-hole that you would meet in real life, and not some buffed up, shaved head movie star pretending to be tough.  He is absolutely hateful in this film, but he is a live-wire and the audience is always left wondering what stupid or overly-emotinal thing he will do next to throw a monkey wrench into the plot.  Rosario Dawson has what amounts to a glorified cameo in the film as Levitt's abused and down-trodden girlfriend.  She is quite effective in her limited screentime and her character helps further flesh out certain inner-conflicts of the Rourke character.

John Madden(Shakespeare In Love) does a really fine job in the direction.  The film moves fast and never muddles itself into incomprehensability with its loaded plot developments.  A lot is going on in this film and he makes sure the audience is up to speed, except for certain moments where we're supposed to be kept in the dark.  The screenplay is sparse and to the point.  It manages to be true to the novel while still streamlining it into a film.  The film has a good sense of place as well.  The locations feel real and not Rockwell'd out.  It feels like a real American place.

The only gripe I have with the film is a plot strand that is simply brought up and then dropped.  There's a point where the main characters start to question whether the FBI is using them as bait so they can make a case against the Toronto mob, but then the plot wheels go into overdrive and it's glossed over.  But that's it.

The DVD is a bare-bones release unfortunately.  Not even a trailer is provided.  The transfer is perfect and the widescreen photography is really done justice with this disc.  I would've preferred or enjoyed to hear the director's thoughts on the much maligned project.  Also, some of the deleted scenes would've been a nice addition.  Then again, maybe the film will do so well on disc that it will warrant a director's cut special edition in the future.  Probably not.  Check it out.

PS:  I would love to know what the original theatrical poster artwork looked like, because the dvd artwork is atrocious.  It's just Rourke and Lane side by side, and Rourke looks air-brushed to the point of being a mannequin.  Plus, it has the usual blurred characters walking from an explosion behind them.  UGGHHH.  Poster artwork is already a lost art, the least we could get is the original concepts when the films hit disc.",1243641600,5,5389,4.73469387755102
3794871,4,B001U0HB5Q,"KILLSHOT is far from being a great movie.  I suppose it could be said that it isn't even a movie, but instead a DVD project as it has a rather leaden history. But though there was no theatrical release to garner public interest and little promotional material about its shelf release, it may just find an audience among word of mouth promotion.  It has enough elements to keep the interest of even late at night tired viewers - and that says a lot these days.  Elmore Leonard's novel has been reconstructed by Hossein Amini and John Madden has done his best to string together the various beads of the plots that comprise this story, and the result is a film peppered by some worthwhile actors who do their best to make the implausible story lines work.

Armand 'Blackbird' Degas (Mickey Rourke) is a long time hitman, an American Indian with a past pasted together by tragedies who accepts an assignment to make a new kill.  His plan is disrupted by his accidental and maladaptive association with a bonafide psychopath Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and girlfriend Donna (Rosario Dawson). Nix decides to partner with Blackbird and in the process they encounter a 'couple on the rocks' - Carmen and Wayne Colson (Thomas Jane and Diane Lane) - who happen to witness an incident that puts them in danger of Nix and Blackbird's recipe for not leaving witnesses.  The couple is put on Witness Protection Program but that doesn't dent the clever Blackbird from accomplishing his goals.  The rest of the story is a cat and mouse chase that has some moments of real terror. And as in most of Leonard's stories, things don't turn out the way they seem to suggest.

Things are missing from this film that create holes in the story and stretch credibility.  The work by the lead actors is quite good as is that of the momentary cameos by such luminaries as Hal Holbrook and Lois Smith. A great film this is not, but a film that maintains attention/tension it is and worth an evening's entertainment.  Grady Harp, May 09",1243641600,,2013,4.6770538243626065
3794872,4,B001U0HB5Q,"Armand ""Blackgird"" Degas (Rourke) is a hitman for the Toronto mafia.  When his dedication to the job brings about the wrath of his employers, he falls in with Richie Nix (Gordon-Levitt), a two-time crook who's a bit too anxious for his own good.  When they try one of Nix's many extortion schemes, they run into struggling couple Wayne and Carmen Colson (Jane and Lane).  Degas is determined to let no one who sees his face live.  Wayne and Carmen going into protective custody isn't about to stop that.

KILLSHOT is a perfectly decent thriller, with a wonderful premise that, though not wholly believable, is at least interesting and original.  I haven't read the novel yet, though I plan to do so; I have a feeling the novel (written by the illustrious Elmore Leonard) explores the thematic potentials more fully than the film, which at times feels like a mish-mash of scenes rather than one solid whole.  (This can be blamed on the long delay; I first saw previews for KILLSHOT years--literally years--ago.)  The script itself is fairly solid, except for a few cliched lines of dialogue; there are a few genuine surprises, and even some damned-fine humor and action sequences.

Thomas Jane is solid as usual (I won't say ""always;"" he's had some clunker roles in the past, though it's usually the film's fault and not his), and Diane Lane manages to steal quite a few scenes.  Overall, though, the film rests squarely on the broad shoulders of Mickey Rourke, who is delightfully sinister, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is overly campy and thoroughly enjoyable.  The interaction between the two isn't quite fleshed out like it should be (and their relationship isn't at all believable; a pro like Degas would never hook up with a small-time punk like Nix, no matter how much the latter resembles the former's deceased kid brother), but each actor holds his own in different ways: Rourke shows his mastery of restraint (watch THE WRESTLER for another example of this talent, albeit under extremely different circumstances), and Gordon-Levitt has one hell of a good time camping it up, letting his character's long hair and unjustified ego fly.

KILLSHOT isn't quite what it could have been, but it's still a solid film that's worth a look or two.  It's quick and suspenseful; if you can overlook some of its logistics errors, it's an entertaining thriller that offers some solid acting and an interesting plot.",1243382400,22,2410,4.906403940886699
8342523,4,B001U0HB5Q,"This film is based on a novel by the excellent novelist Elmore Leonard. The film is rather heavy handed. An assassin for the Toronto Mafia - an American Indian - killed a woman the mafia did not want killed when he killed a man they wanted killed, and although he had worked for the mafia for years, they want to kill him for the murder of the woman. They send other mafia assassins to find and kill him. The FBI is also after him for killing the man for the Toronto mafia.
He happens to meet an incompetent rather stupid young man who reminds him of his brother who acted stupidly and got himself killed during an assassin mission, and agrees to team up with him to extort money from a real estate man. Before meeting each other, the young man threatened the real estate man to either give him $20,000 or he will destroy his business. They go to collect the money and a man and his wife, but not the real estate man are there. The young fellow does a lot of damage thinking the husband is the real estate man who he had threatened. The husband beats them up. They run away, but the assassin wants to go after the couple that saw the two of them and kill them. He does not want to be identified.
The FBI agrees to place the couple in protective custody. They want to capture the assassin and get the assassin to testify against the mafia. The couple was in the midst of a divorce. They are clearly attracted to each other, but fight all the time.",1523836800,,1446,4.242753623188406

He is outstanding and takes this movie to another level. Diane and Thomas are witnesses to a crime by Mickey and Joseph and no one every sees Mickey's face, he eliminates all witnesses.
