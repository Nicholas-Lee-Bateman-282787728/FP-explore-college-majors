4581411,4,B0055V0K7M,"This movie was predictable.....but most holiday movies are. Also, it seems to me that the majority of holiday movies are about families with young children so it was nice to see a family with older children for a change. The plot isn't deep, and doesn't require a lot of thinking, but that is part of what makes it so enjoyable.",1318032000,17,328,4.483333333333333

I gave this a 10 because it did what movies are supposed to do: make us feel good. Ignore the negative criticisms made by some reviewers and just enjoy. Even though the grandmother was obviously too young looking, it did not keep me from enjoying the movie. By the way, David Sutcliffe was about 41 when this was made, so he certainly was old enough to be the father of teen boys. I put this movie in the category of the Hallmark movies.

This is a wholesome movie and I had a big smile on my face the entire time. I love the more dramatic series such as Daredevil, but once in a while it is nice to take a break from murder and mayhem and watch a simple, clean movie. Teens would probably find this boring, but not this old lady and many others like me out there!",1458950400,,769,4.126666666666667

4581431,4,B0055V0K7M,"I liked the film and I liked the actors in the film.  The part that left me a little unsatisfied is that her family never seemed to really address the heroine's feelings about this last Christmas before her sons leave for college, nor their somewhat self-centered demands.  More of the focus seems to be on what the heroine learned from the experience.  Those lessons were valid, but I would have preferred a little more balance between the two.  But overall I did like the film, and few stories are completely satisfying to everyone.",1451692800,,534,4.709677419354839

4581434,3,B0055V0K7M,"This is a strange holiday movie about a control freak mother (Daphne Zuniga) who feels taken for granted.  She wants her family to join in and fulfill her list of demands for Christmas........exactly in the way she would do them, if she had planned on doing them.  This allocation of chores does not go according to her plans and so she pouts.  And then she plots.  She discovers a means of publicly humiliating her husband and two sons by getting their shiftless behavior printed in the local newspaper!!!  Complete with their photos!!!  She basically puts targets on all of them and yes, people react when they see them.  Thats the loser from the article.  If you hated your family, this might be a grand way of getting even with them.  But she professes to love them while making them into targets of ridicule!  Naturally, the men retaliate with an article of their own.  This is war now!  Throughout this holiday movie, the mother tries coercion, guilt, and a form of emotional blackmail to get her irresponsible, thoughtless family to dance to her tune of tyranny.  She has expectations that aren't being met so she takes it out on everyone around her.  I might have had more sympathy for her if she hadnt been so manipulative.  This movie trivializes the meaning of strikes and what they are intended for.  Worse still, the ending trickles down to a lame speech that can be summed up in two words: never mind.
Her idea of Christmas was not their idea of Christmas.",1448323200,,1470,4.6395348837209305

4581446,5,B0055V0K7M,"This one is a different Christmas movie:  it's not about Santa, it's not a holiday romance, it is about a wife who is in love with Christmas, with her husband and two (almost-grown) boys, and she wants them to have a great Christmas.  But she can't do it alone, guys!

She has a job, a thriving business, that keeps her, her mother and a number of other employees very busy and yet hubbie and the boys just won't help put up the decorations or anything.  Finally she goes on strike -- not at work, just at home.  Just for Christmas, or until her family helps out.  They do mean well, it's just that they really don't get it. Instead of really helping, they take this as a challenge, one that they can win!  How hard can it be, anyway?  Come on, baking cookies?

So, how did they do?  Let me put it this way:  a jock, a musician, and a professor go into a kitchen and they're lucky to get out of there with their lives.  If there was a law against cruelty to eggs they'd be in prison for sure and they were lucky the house didn't burn down. Yes, they are an embarrassment for all of guy-kind.

Fortunately Mom keeps her cool, has a lot of her friends joining her in the strike, because they too have families who just don't help.  Inciting to riot is never a good policy, guys.

A lovely, very interesting, and wonderfully different celebration of the Christmas season.",1423008000,,1368,4.309803921568627

Still, like all children of any age, they expect Christmas to happen with or without their involvement. The mother finally takes matters into her own hands and goes on strike encouraging her friends and neighbors to do likewise.

4581465,4,B0055V0K7M,"- Stephen (to his kids during a disastrous cookie-baking incident): ""Look, your mom is gonna be home right after the shop closes, and we still haven't toasted our nuts.""
- Mark: ""Dad, don't ever say that again.""
- Jeremy (to Dad): ""You're so weird.""

Joy Robertson (Daphne Zuniga), domestic goddess, is a micro-manager. Her husband and two teenaged sons are so used to her being so capable that they tend to dismiss her quiet pleas for help. This is the Robertsons' last Christmas together as the kids, Jeremy and Mark, are set to go to college. So Joy really wants this Christmas to be super-special. The movie starts ten days until Christmas.

Joy's running behind, and she's starting to fret some. Getting the tree, let alone decorating it and the rest of the house, keeps getting postponed. Doesn't help that her teacher/writer hubbie, Stephen (David Sutcliffe), out of the blue expects her to host his school's English Dept. holiday party and that Jeremy is suddenly asking her to bake cookies for the football banquet. And, by the way, Joy also happens to run her own fabric shop, The Knittery, so it's not like domestic goddessing is all she does.

Eight days until Christmas, Joy is utterly swamped and has just about had it with getting taken for granted, fed up with her boys' always breaking their promises to help her Christmas preparations. And so, seven days until Christmas, Joy goes on strike. And then the movie really starts.

ON STRIKE FOR CHRISTMAS (2010), based on Sheila Roberts' book, turns out to be a breezy watch during the holidays and more fun than I thought it would be. Daphne Zuniga keeps it together, keeps it grounded as the long-suffering mom who finally puts down her foot. And maybe holiday strikes are contagious because Joy's knitting club soon joins her on strike, her pals also mightily fed up with their inconsiderate men. And when one of her pals, a journalist for the local paper, features her plight in a human interest column and then that story goes viral, well, things escalate into a city-wide battle of the sexes. Joy, hey, you're suddenly a rallying point!

It wouldn't be much of a story if the Robertson boys didn't feel the need to prove Joy wrong. We know it's coming, but it still induces big grins, watching the guys try to handle their business in the kitchen. Their first project: to bake cookies, cookies that, when all's said and done, taste like - to quote one of the kids - ""biological weapons."" Oh, it's a mess, that kitchen. And then the story conflict ratchets up even more when they get the chance to tell their side of the story in that same local paper. Oh, I shuddered when the article quoted Stephen as referring to Joy as ""Yulezilla.""

It's a light comedy and it's set during the holidays, so odds are, that happy ending is lurking 'round the corner. I think this is a well-done movie with several madcap moments. The premise turns your head. The gags are staged well, with amusing pay-offs. Equally important, there's a warmth to these proceedings. The sense we get is that even though Joy is on strike and the men are trying to show her up, the reconciliation isn't too far coming. But, man, I never knew separating the egg's yolk from the egg's white was so damn hard.",1388102400,,3242,4.669001751313485

4581478,3,B0055V0K7M,"Really, the only thing that saves On Strike For Christmas is the original storyline.  None of the acting is spectacular by any stretch but totally serves its purpose for the Lifetime Movie Network, and the humor is always really basic and Brady Bunch-like.  However, you know, sometimes an innocent movie like this is a breath of fresh air in a world full of corruption and violence (Bad Santa anyone?) so with that in mind -despite the extremely awful start- On Strike For Christmas is actually pretty decent viewing material.

It's about a mother/wife that reaches a point of being COMPLETELY fed up with her selfish husband and two inconsiderate sons since they seem to expect the woman of the house to handle all the Christmas shopping, decorating and cooking.  So... she comes up with this idea to literally go on strike and make THEM do all the work!  Really interesting idea, and the movie is honestly interesting enough to warrant a 3.5 rating which is good in my book, so with that said, I did enjoy my time watching this movie.  My favorite part by FAR is the husband/father and two sons attempting to make cookies in the kitchen, LOL!  They can understand directions and bake treats about as well as I can!  Yes that's right- I burn the bottoms too, lol.

A pretty original storyline saves it, and I really do recommend it for 90 minutes of innocent fun.  Perhaps the ending stinks since it's so predictable and lacks excitement, but other than that, worth watching with the family.  I just KNOW however, that a woman came up with this concept!  Perhaps several ladies that threatened to go on strike for the holidays!  Daphne Zuniga is really attractive too.  No WAY she's 50 years old!  I guess it sort of bothers me that her name is Joy in the film.  Come on that's too silly and obvious for a Christmas-themed movie, haha.",1356220800,,1837,4.640866873065016

This is very much a Christmas movie but I purchased it a week ago (long after Christmas had passed) and enjoyed every moment.  So if you want to put your feet up and enjoy approx 2 hours worth of entertainment then this movie is for you.,1329004800,3,427,3.941860465116279
4581486,5,B0055V0K7M,"This is a cute movie and for a lot of women, it can be true.  There are a lot of men that wouldn't bother with doing the festive Christmas if their mate didn't do it.  Now that's not all men, but there are some out there.  I really enjoyed this movie, just as a cute movie.",1326758400,2,273,3.8392857142857144

4581489,5,B0055V0K7M,This movie was funny and lighthearted. It gave a great message on what family means and what is important. This is a must see film.,1323734400,4,131,4.28
4581490,5,B0055V0K7M,"I have read the novel ""On Strike for Christmas"" by Sheila Roberts and I thought the book was okay. Still, I was intrigued to see the movie and see what they did with it. What a difference. I realize that Christmas is always going to have sad times as that is human nature, but I was relieved the screenwriters and/or directors/producers decided to dump the parts of the book that made it so dreary. This movie was quite funny at times and very enjoyable. I am usually skeptical of TV movies for fear of cheesy, silly acting (as was ""The Dog that Saved Halloween... but that is another review). The actors have a modicum of talent, especially Daphne. She is not overdramatic as an actress in this movie, although sometimes she has the right to be and still can underplay it while appropriately being horrified.

Essentially the story can appeal to every woman who has ever had to put together a holiday entirely by herself. In this case, Joy (Daphne Zuniga) is doing all the work to get her family ready for Christmas. She is doing the baking, the decorating, the tree, the shopping and all the party and meal planning that goes with Christmas. Her lovely husband and two older sons (I assumer are 17 or 18 because they are going off to college) sit back and watch her do all this. She makes lists of simple tasks for all to do (buy new Christmas lights, get decorations from gargage, stuff like that) and none of this gets done. So the men are left to fend for themselves as she decides to strike and chaos ensues. They apparently live in a never named small town in California and news of Joy's strike spread quickly and soon all the women in town are soon on strike.

Other reviewers labeled this movie predictable, and it is, but I tell you the scene where the dad and the boys make cookies makes this movie well worth the admission price, or at least 90 minutes of your time to watch it. I have seen far worse Christmas movies and if you are a frazzled mother who does everything yourself, you will enjoy this movie.",1320537600,32,2020,4.442048517520216
4581491,4,B0055V0K7M,"A simple tale of having appreciation for things done for you that you take for granted, in this case, Mum.

Simple but pleasant Christmas movie that is best enjoyed with the family together.",1320451200,11,190,4.757575757575758
