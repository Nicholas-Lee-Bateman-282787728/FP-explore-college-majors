7839892,1,6303162312,I purchased this video hoping it would be awesome especially the wedding scene of Eddie and and Shauni but it was horribly disappointing. All the original songs were dubbed especially the most beautiful All My Life by Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville which was the wedding song of Eddie and Shauni. I got horribly gyped!!,1453852800,,321,4.8545454545454545
7839893,4,6303162312,"I used to have a lot of Baywatch's from TV taped on some videos but this is the only one i have now,and it's the actual video as represented here. It's a unique episode in which it's the only one in Baywatch history that features my three favorite blonds on the same episode...that being Pamela Anderson,Nicole Eggert and Erika Eleniak. You see,Erika's last show was this one and it happened to be Pamela's first. This is also Nicole's debut episode. So,that's a little Baywatch trivia i guess. Anyhow,decent story with awesome scenery as it takes place away from the beach (mostly) and is set somewhere on the Sacramento river. It'll make you wanna go camping watching this. The only sour parts of the show for me was Hobie constantly singing that gold miners song (you wanna strangle him after the 2nd time) and the fact that Erika (Shauni) cut her hair at some point and has it short. It should be long like Pamela's!!",1123632000,9,921,4.621951219512195
