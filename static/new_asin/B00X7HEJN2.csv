7162465,5,B00X7HEJN2,"This powerful police procedural, an ITV television miniseries, was written by Matt Charman (Steven Spielbergs BRIDGE OF SPIES), directed by Michael Samuels (ANY HUMAN HEART). Its a tight psychological crime thriller that explores the burdens of undercover police workblack workon officers and their families; tells the story of a woman willing to risk everything to protect her family.

It is set in Leeds, an English midlands town thats certainly not over-exposed on this side of the Atlantic.  In this British mystery, police constable Jo Gillespie (BAFTA-Award winning Sheridan Smith, THE ACCUSED, JONATHAN CREEK) is dismayed to learn that her detective husband, Officer Ryan Gillespie, (Kenny Doughty, VERA), who  without her knowledgehad been assigned to work undercover, has been killed in suspicious circumstances. She struggles to stay strong for her competitive swimmer young daughter and teenage stepson. Is urged by her superiorsat the cop shop, DCS Will Hepburn (Douglas Henshall, SHETLAND) and Chief Constable Carolyn Jarecki (Geraldine James, SHERLOCK HOLMES), to leave finding the killer to her fellow officers. But the murder inquiry starts to unravel some dangerous and unsavory secrets about Ryan; Jos faith in him and her police family is shaken. She  begins her own investigation with the help of friend/colleague/possible future lover Jack Clark (Matthew McNulty, THE PARADISE, JAMAICA INN), although she is no longer sure she can trust him: she is no longer sure whom to trust. As Tom Piper, Ryans handler, respected veteran Philip Davis, known for ALIEN, NOTES ON A SCANDAL, VERA DRAKE, adds  weight, verisimilitude. The episodes are:

1. Jo Gillespies husband is found shot dead in a disused Leeds warehouse. Seeming inactivity among her police colleagues causes Jo to eventually feels she must start investigations on her own.
2. The apparent prime suspect is arrested but Jo isn't satisfied with the arrest, which leaves too many questions unanswered.
3. Further murders, and discovery of her husbands darker side, leave Jo feeling she must protect her family.

The box set consists of three episodes on one disc, totaling approximately 141 minutes.  It has subtitles, thank goodness.  Its for mature audiences only, as it contains violence, coarse language and sexual situations. I received this as a review copy. The three part script is intriguing, emotionally rich. The series photography is, of course, excellent, and its a good strong cast.  In the protagonists role, Smith is able to portray a broad range of emotions, carry the production manfully. Well, I make no secret of my general love for female-centered drama, except in those genres I dislike, which can best be summed up as mushy-centered chick lit/flicks.  Which this one surely isnt. So I loved it, binge watched it.",1452211200,4,2811,5.33710407239819
7162466,5,B00X7HEJN2,"This three-part miniseries was produced in 2015 by the British commercial TV network  ITV  which explains why each episode is about 47 minutes long. It has not been on broadcast TV in the US yet. I was provided an advance screener by Acorn for an objective review.

The story is about secrets both in a family where both the husband and his second wife are employed by the police. And within the department itself. The script (from Matt Charman who penned the recent Bridge of Spies for Steven Spielberg) is nicely layered so that the actual culprit (yes, there is a muder  actually more than one  but thats not a spoiler) is not revealed until the end of the 141 minutes.

The acting is excellent as well. It seems that many of this type film finds corruption among the ranks and this one is no different. But it didn't telegraph the ending.

The DVD has an English subtitle option and  while I usually don't need to use it, I found myself wanting to this this time and enjoyed it better. The subtitles are really large (often this is not the case) and VERY easy to read.

I do have one suggestion for those who don't like spoilers. When you choose the episode to play, you are taken to a synopsis of that episode before you can play it. My suggestion is to NOT READ the synopsis (or any synopsis listed in other reviews) as there are spoilers there. Just move on to the program itself.

There are no bonus features on the DVD.  If you like British detective stories I do recommend this one.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7162467,5,B00X7HEJN2,"Leeds, England, is the setting of police undercover operation going bad and the following cover-up. Jo (Sheridan Smith), the spouse of a dead agent/husband (Kenny Doughty Vera) is a Leeds cop who will not listen to superiors about leaving the case alone. It becomes a three-episode story of uncovering the undercoverer and cover-up, so to speak. It is a multi-faceted suspense drama that turns to bits of intense thriller. I almost gave this 5-STAR DVD presentation a half-star demotion due to the hairstyle and makeup of the protagonist, Jo, who looks to me better made up for a sci-fi space thriller; or an older Twiggy 1960s look, for those of us that remember back that far.
BUT the writing is soooooo goooood, done by Matt Charman (Bridge of Spies), the full 5 stars stand.

The rest of the cast offers outstandingly played believable characters. Older teens and upward, due to content.
Cast members you might recognize includes: Matthew McNulty (Paradise The Mill); Geraldine James (Sherlock Holmes x2); Lisa Dillon (Cranford); Philip Davis (Poldark); Douglas Henshall (Outlander South Riding); Andrew Gower (The Village); & Zoe Nash (Hope Springs) who is a real native-born Leeds beauty).

SDH SUBTITLES for all 3 episodes. No bonus material.
==1==Jo Gillespies husband shot dead in a Leeds warehouse. To find out how/who killed Ryan, Jo tackles the case on her own, slowly learning of her husbands many secrets and placing herself in danger. Her wannabe adulterous friend/colleague assists.

 ==2==Chief suspect is arrested but Jos questions continue. She uncovers more of Ryans past riddled with hidden facts. She was warned digging deeper might not be what she wants to know. Who can she trust?

==3==Jos unveiled shattering secrets of Ryan sends her running to protect her family. Another murder pushes her to find the ultimate truthno matter what. A satisfying and warm ending after such a trying investigative ordeal.
A DVD worth owning, because of the complexity of plot, it is one worthy of an immediate second viewing.",1451347200,6,2034,5.132930513595166

7162473,4,B00X7HEJN2,"Jo Gillespie has a strained goodbye with her husband, Ryan. She's taking their 8 year-old daughter, Melly, to swim practice and he says that work calls - he might not be there when they get back. He's a DS in the Leeds, Yorkshire Police, where Jo is also a constable. Ryan's last words to Jo are ""Am I losing you?""

His very last words. He doesn't come home that night. The next day his body is found in an abandoned warehouse with a 9 millimeter bullet through his heart. And then the unpleasant surprises start. DCS Hepburn tells Jo: ""Ryan was working on an operation for the last three years.... He was working under cover. He was asked to keep it very tight. No one knew.""

But something else is going on. For one thing, Jo examines a dangling tiny flex recorder that someone has hidden in the interior ceiling of her car. She's not supposed to be working on the case of her husband's murder, but she doesn't know who else  to trust to do the job.

I thought ""Black Work"" was a good series. The acting is OK but the plot's characterizations seemed muted. I couldn't decide if Jo was emotionally shut down or if that was just the tone of the whole series. Even Doug Henshall as Hepburn appears to be half asleep. The best part is the plotting of the mystery itself, because I kept changing my mind on who the killer was  and my guesses were wrong.

""Black Work"" originally aired in 2015. There is one mystery, solving Ryan's murder, told over 3 episodes totaling 141 minutes. The DVD presents the show in 16:9 widescreen and stereo. English SDH subtitles are available. I found the subtitles valuable, because some of the accents were a bit difficult for me. There are no bonus extras on the DVD.

Overall, a 3.8 star series for me, rounded up to 4 stars.

7162475,3,B00X7HEJN2,"Interesting plot.  However, the lead actress needs to brush up on her acting skills.

8715256,3,B00X7HEJN2,"Was it watchable? Yes. I wouldn't give it much more than that.

Sheridan did a great job with what she had, but it was just another ""suspense cop drama"" with neither suspense nor drama.

I didn't think the characterizations were well done, the writing was so-so but didn't blow my boots off. And my gosh, if you are going to make a cop show, can you at least make the cops act and think like cops?
