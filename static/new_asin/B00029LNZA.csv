2069818,2,B00029LNZA,"No doubt meant to offset the current rage for the bombastic Hollywood action thriller genre with its faster than the speed of light smash em up pacing, The Ladykillers moves so far in the opposite direction as to prove mind-numbing.  The characters here are, with one exception, so forced and flat that the entire film comes off as a huge static cartoon.  Intended as a ""modern"" update of the original Alec Guiness film from the early 50s, this version sorely lacks the liveliness and subtlety of the first one.
Good points:
1.  The gospel choir which provides a very much needed kick in the pants to keep the viewer awake. The music and its performance are exceptional.
2,  Marlon Wayans' performance which is the ONLY lively one here.  Notwithstanding the abusive language cliches, Mr. Wayans' character is another (scarce) animated element in an otherwise remarkably dull film.
3.  The always-changing expression on the face of a man in a painting.  Though this is a tried and true old comedy cliche, it's done very nicely here.
4.  The demise of a few of the characters near the end of the film (this is not a spoiler since there is no mention of WHICH characters).
Bad points:
Just about everything else.  While the story itself is acceptable, the execution drags on and on, due in large part to the ultra-contrived scripting--in particular, of the lead character played by Tom Hanks.  His nervous giggling, overly stylized language (done with much greater flair and zest by Tim Curry in the overlooked film Oscar), and constant rationalizing is ultimately and quite substantially annoying.  Add to that the cartoonish presence of a too-dumb-to-be-believed (or believable) football player and an ""inscrutable"" Asian character (let's milk these ethnic stereotypes for all they're worth, shall we?) as well as another character who suffers from IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), and you have a comedy so forced it almost literally begs the audience to giggle, chortle, or snicker.
A group of miscreants, headed by Mr. Hanks' Professor G.H. Dorr, PhD, rents the basement of a house owned by an elderly black woman in the deep South, ostensibly for the purpose of practicing Renaissance music.  Charmed by the ostentatious verbal spoutings of Dr. Dorr, Irma P. Hall's Marva Munson consents to his need for practice space which is really a ruse to tunnel into the office where Gawain (Marlon Wayans) works as a janitor to rob the place of its casino gains.
The moments of natural humor are few and far between.  While Ms. Hall's character is well drawn and unforced, the back and forth between her and Hanks--which constitutes a sizeable portion of the film--is increasingly tiresome and unfunny, as well as, subtly, insulting.  Juxtaposing a well-educated effete snob whose criminal tendencies get the better of him with an uneducated woman of upright virtue may appear to be ripe for comedic potential and all manner of satire, but the Professor's speech patterns and mannerisms are essentially meant to ridicule his listener's lack of education.  This is not an overt racist slur per se, but is nevertheless irritating.
While crime comedy is a Coen specialty, this is not a sterling example--not by a long shot.  Try their much earlier film, Raising Arizona, for a terrific entry in this sub-genre.  Other notable crime comedies, not by the Coens, include Welcome to Collinwood and Palookaville.
For diehard Coen fans, this is a film you will probably go see anyway.  For everyone else, definitely not recommended.",1080950400,,3515,5.02065404475043
2069819,3,B00029LNZA,"Despite a riveting central performance from Irma Hall, an invigorating gospel soundtrack, and a few situations that echo the Coens' better works (Fargo, Raising Arizona or even The Hudsucker Proxy), Ladykillers is a would-be wacky romp that never develops the comic energy it so desparately needs to take off.
It's remake that, like most remakes, falls flat despite many of the Coen brothers' usual elements of occasionally funny blowhards, visual gags, inventive camera work and florid language (a lot of the swearing was absolutely unnecessary). In fact, the movie just plain drags in the middle of its 100+ minutes.
Tom Hanks is convincing as usual, but this is perhaps one of his oddest roles to date, a miscalculation from start to finish. One wonders what is becoming of the Coens, given other recent misfires such as Intolerable Cruelty. Skip this tripe, or rent it out when it's out there if you are a diehard Coens fan.",1080864000,,928,4.955128205128205
2069820,3,B00029LNZA,"It is quite amazing to see the Minnesota native Coen Brothers and their films thrusted into the mainstream media when just a few years ago they were barely known outside the independent feature circuit. To say the creative duo have a fancy for crime capers would be an understatement ... They live and breathe felonious situations as many of their features have demonstrated over the years starting with their first film, Blood Simple. Another understatement would be to say that their films apply to the normal sense of logic as Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and O' Brother, Where Art Thou? can advocate to that. A more precise description would be to say that the Coen Brothers, as strange and outlandish as their films may be, are an inventive duo that continue to surprise the film community with their marvelous cinematography and spiritual music. It is only as of late, thanks to the wide reception of O' Brother Where Art Thou?, that the team has been pushed into spotlight with their romantic flick Intolerable Cruelty and now this but some wonder if this will go too much to their heads, which may result in the creative aspect so many once desired from them.
The story is based on the 1955 British Ealing comedy, The Ladykillers, starring Sir Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers with the situation this time being set in Southern Louisiana instead of London. Goldthwait Higginson Dorr III, Ph. D would seem the perfect gentlemen, most notably to a kindly old church-going woman like Mrs. Munson. He's well versed in oratory skills, intelligent, and charming ... The perfect disguise for the criminal mastery that lies underneath. The charlatan professor has come upon this perpetual household in order to establish his base of operations in the root cellar, which happens to be right in line with the gambling casino's underground vault. With the help of an explosives expert, tunneling operator, muscle man, and a ""inside man"", the criminal gang plans to rob the floating casino of millions of dollars all in the effort to become exceedingly rich. Everything seems to be going perfectly ... Until their upstairs host stumbles upon their little operation and threatens to report them to the authorities unless they return the money and go to church that Sunday. Left with no choice at hand, they plot to do-out the kindly old woman ... a task easier said then done. The story for The Ladykillers, as Cohen Brothers-esque as it may be, is too outlandish even for them. Some of the events that take place within the film, whether they were funny or not, are too over-the-top and stereotypical that it just off-balances the plot. On top of that, the entire feature, though time at a reasonable one hour and fifty minutes, feels dragged out and longer then it is.
Cohen Brothers films have always attracted top talent and The Ladykillers is no exception. Unfortunately that talent is somewhat squandered here which only adds to the disappointing reception of this film from a creative duo we expected more from. The biggest highlight of the feature, whether it be good or bad, had to be Tom Hanks as the villainous Goldthwait Higginson Dorr III, Ph. D. Hanks gives an over-the-top performance of a character that seems to be a combination of Colonel Sanders, the rooster from the Looney Tunes cartoons, and every charming villain ever assembled on screen. Whether or not this works for you, credit must be given to Tom Hanks for putting a lot of effort into a character that is so central to the story. Unfortunately it isn't enough to keep the rest of the cast, as well as the plot itself, afloat. J.K. Simmons's Garth Pancake, all acting ability aside, is just an absolutely disturbing and, at times, flat-out annoying character that, as much effort as the man puts into it, just doesn't seem to work all that well for the film. And Marlon Wayans, once again whether there is acting ability there or not aside, is the most foul-mouthed character to come across such a comedy in a long time and is quite a surprise coming from the Cohen Brothers.
Overall, The Ladykillers is one of the most foul-mouthed, predictable, and bland comedies this year and quite a disappointment coming the same team that brought us the creative masterpiece, O' Brother, Where Art Thou? Right off the bat, the use of offensive language came as one of the biggest surprises from this film, it not being a good one at that. Never had there been such a ridiculous usage of the words f*ck and the ""n-word"" in recent memory, or at least since Bad Boys II graced us with its abhorrent presence in July 2003. The detestable language served no real purpose in the plot of this film and seemed to hinder it more then anything else, though that is not to say that had the word usage been tone-downed that it would have helped out all that much. The plot itself may seem a neat concept on paper but watching it acted out on screen can be excruciating with the relatively simple story feeling dragged out longer then it actually is. And the fact that the events after the midway point of the feature become extremely predictable doesn't help out much either. Bottom-line is that this film will be a mixed bag ... some may come out of this disappointed while others will be laughing in stitches, it's all depending on the point of view and whether or not they have had experiences with the Cohen Brothers in the past. Fans of their work will certainly be disappointed by this outing ... Here's hoping they take a year off to rejuvenate those creative juices of theirs.",1080691200,2,5531,4.744548286604362
2069821,3,B00029LNZA,"In the pantheon of Coen brothers' films, this one will fall somewhere in the middle in terms of first-to-worst. It certainly seemed like a sure thing- team up the generally inventive Coen brothers with Tom Hanks (who is as close to guaranteed box office gold as you can get these days).
And the movie does entertain, if somewhat sporadically. Hanks plays a southern professor from the University of Mississippi at Hattiesburg with as penchant for dressing like Mark Twain and speaking like a southern gentlemen from an old Bugs Bunny cartoon. He has hatched a plot to steal the take from a Mississippi riverboat gambling operation. In order to do this, he and his partners in crime need to tunnel into the gambling operation's vault that is situated underground on dry land.
Irma P. Hall, playing a deeply religious widow who sends $5.00 a month to Bob Jones University, happens to own a nearby home with a root cellar that is perfect for the plan, so Hanks rents a room from her and pretends that he and his partners are a musical ensemble that need the root cellar to practice. Naturally for this type of film, Hall manages to gum up the works for Hanks and crew, even if often inadvertently. When the gang believes they have succeeded, she finds out what they've been up to and insists she will turn them into the law unless they return the money and go to church with her. Hanks' character seems more aghast at going to church than returning the money (it seems like something was left on the cutting room floor regarding Hanks dislike for the prospect of going to church), and at this point the movie turns a little dark, although still trying to maintain a comedic tone, as the gang decides they must kill her if they are to pull off the perfect crime. As you might expect, she proves more than a match for them, even while sleeping.
I'm not sure what the Coen brothers were going for here and I've never seen the original film it is based upon to know much about the source material. Hanks is always watchable throughout, even though he sometimes seems a little uncertain about what to do with his character. The remainder of the cast seems perfectly suited to their roles, but for some reason the movie just not come together. The comedy sometimes seems very forced as do the attempts at foreshadowing throughout the film. The foreshadowing, in fact, is rather heavy-handed at times.
Given all that, the film is still worth seeing, if only for the performances of the two leads and also that of Marlon Wayans. Wayans plays a streetwise, seemingly poorly educated punk, who gives a glimpse at his inner demons late in the film. The moment this happens is rather jarring, but it works.
It's worth the price of admission, just don't expect another ""O, Brother Where at Thou?"" While it is a rather average, uneven effort for the Coens, average for the Coens is superior to 80% of the other films out there.",1080518400,,2910,4.61969111969112
2069822,1,B00029LNZA,I just watched the movie and wished that i hadn't. The movie was absolutley horrible. No plot the acting sucked and the use of the F word constatnly was a major turn off. Tom Hanks is a vary talented actor and i cannot beleive he choose to do this role although he played it excellently it still did not make one bit of a difference because the movie was a mess. Do yourself a favor save your money and go watch something worth it.,1080432000,9,431,4.142857142857143
2069823,2,B00029LNZA,"I'm used to automatically seeing anything associated with the Cohen Brothers.  The previews for The Ladykillers made it look like a charming, Southern US, caper film.  Sure enough, there were plenty of grey-haired folks in the theatre.  I can't imagine they expected the constant MF swearing from one of the chracters.
This is a remake of the 1955 hit UK film of the same name starring Peter Sellers and Alec Guiness.  The new version relies on repetitive gag humour and the clash between a conservative Christian woman and a foul-mouthed, ""hippity-hop"" criminal, to get most of its laughs.  Some of the other supporting cast members are nothing but dumb cliches (big, dumb jock, quiet, sly Communist Chinese General, etc.)  Tom Hanks plays the role of ring leader as if he were a cartoon character.
There's really no intrigue or really good humour in this obvious  Cohen Brothers sellout.  Not a must-see film.",1080432000,,911,4.947368421052632
2069824,5,B00029LNZA,"My first thoughts when I saw the previews for THE LADYKILLERS, were, ""What in the world?"" I love Coen pictures. I was one of the few who really enjoyed INTOLERABLE CRUELTY. But, when I saw the previews for THE LADYKILLERS, I thought the brothers and Tom Hanks had gone off the deep in.  But, I was wrong.
THE LADYKILLERS is a comedy, actually a semi-dark farce with a touch of mystery. Irma P. Hull stars as Marva Munson, a widowed woman living not far from the river in the state of Mississippi. She advertises a room for rent in her house which is answered by Dr. G.H.Dorr (Tom Hanks). Dorr's sole reason for renting the room is so that he and his ""classical"" ensemble can rehearse in Mrs. Munson's root cellar. Well, actually Dorr is the only musician and the only thing he's directing is a scheme to rob the riverboat casino of 1.6 million dollars. The root cellar is the perfect place to dig a tunnel to the bank vault. And so the escapades begin. The team Dorr has assembled include a commerical prop master who sufferes from serious bowl trouble, a Chinese general who looks like Hitler and who runs a local donut shop, a very stupid college football player, and a young African-American man who has just started working at the casino. Their heist isn't as complicated as robbing a Vegas casino, but the problems are no less difficult. But, Ocean's Eleven this isn't.
The movie starts off kind of slow and initially doesn't seem to make any sense. But then all the pieces start to fall into place. Not only that, but then the humor starts. THE LADYKILLERS is an unusual comedy because it offers several layers of humor all at one time. For instance, there are fart jokes that coincide with witty verbal melee. That doesn't happen very often in movies. About 3/4ths of the way through the film, things seem to slow down again (seem being the key word), but soon the pace picks up until the movie ends at the same places it began.
THE LADYKILLERS is quirky, interesting, and fun to watch. It's also a joy seeing Tom Hanks get back into his comical roots. Combine all of that along with the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe, a rocking-gospel music soundtrack, Marlon Wayons, and some simple faith and you've got one of the most intriguing movies of 2004.",1080432000,4,2251,4.544334975369458
2069825,3,B00029LNZA,"In THE LADYKILLERS, Tom Hanks plays a con man posing as a classics professor planning the heist of a riverboat casino. In order to tunnel into the casino's counting room, he rents a room in the house of a sweet old lady (Irma P. Hall) and uses the root cellar as a staging area.
  Hanks, in his first full-on comic role in some time, is a wonder to behold. His performance is a carefully worked out assembly of tics and mannerisms, topped off with a fey Southern drawl. As a criminal, he's preposterous, but this is a Coen brothers movie, so he's right at home. Everything is just a little off kilter here, from the portrait that keeps changing expression to the dog in the gas mask.
  The Coens' let down a little in the scenes with Hanks and his crew--  led by JK Simmons as a demolitions expert and an unrestrained Marlon Wayans as the inside man. These scenes are played for low comedy and degenerate into jokes about the female anatomy and irritable bowel syndrome (not at the same time). I could have used more of Hanks and Hall together, her dryness seems to keep his performance anchored and their scenes are definitely the funniest. Hanks' crew is posing as an early music ensemble, and the lack of a scene where they play for Hall's church friends is an opportunity missed. Also with George Wallace as a sheriff.
  The soundtrack contains some first-rate gospel music, and I recommend it along with this movie. Although it's not one of their classics, there's more laugh out loud stuff in here than in any Coen film since THE BIG LEBOWSKI.",1080345600,,1549,4.530465949820789
2069826,5,B00029LNZA,"I went into this movie today thinking it might be off-beat and interesting because it's a Coen Brothers film, but I had no idea how much laughter I was in for. I literally left the theater with a laughter headache. The rest of the audience was very vocal, from the older black ladies beside me to the younger viewers below me, everyone was laughing constantly and it helped me laugh in spots I don't think I would have if they were quiet. Tom Hanks delivers one of his best performances ever, and it was nice to see him in a comedy once again. His Professor Dorr is not even close to the original 1955 Alec Guiness performance, but it's not suppose to be. He makes it his own, bringing an interesting creepiness to the character that is over the top at times and believable and charming at others. Since the Oscars recognized Johnny Depp's talents in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" by giving him a nomination, maybe they won't overlook this performance by Hanks even though it's in a comedy. All the supporting cast members are great as well, especially Irma P. Hall as the old fashioned and generous old lady lending a room to the Professor. She was funny at times with her simple logic (opposite of Hank's Dorr which is always complicated) and her scenes with Hanks were some of the best in the movie. Marlon Wayans got a few chuckles out of me, but his character really overkilled it in the foul language department and I was glad when he was finally shut up for good towards the end. I must also mention the costumes, music (mostly up-beat Gospel), and the wonderful cinematography. If your in the mood for an extremely dark and funny comedy, look no further than ""The Ladykillers.""",1080259200,3,1682,4.554455445544554

Pickles the cat,, the lady of the home and her deceased husband's gaze from the painting on the wall, throughout the movie set and held the moral line.  Maybe this would be a morality play.  And the church, the chorus and minister brought joy and  happiness. While the killers, especially Tom Hanks, the ring leader who plays the part so wonderfully,, spend their time plotting to enrich themselves and eliminate any witnesses,including themselves. They're very funny. They're seen hanging near the river island dump as their plans face one obstacle after another.  And the police men,do their job in this case of not looking too hard for the truth and thus insures good conquers evil.  Maybe I've gone overboard but I truly enjoyed this movie and my wife Kath would say the same. . It's definitely one of my all time favorites....  only problem I wish the language had been toned down some, so younger viewers would enjoy this too.....",1474502400,4,1106,4.804232804232805

More profanity than probably needed, a lot of subtle funnies, though, like the portrait, the dumping of bodies, the instruments.

2070026,4,B00029LNZA,"One of the best-loved films from the idiosyncratic British film studio Ealing Pictures gets an update from the equally idiosyncratic film making team of Joel and Ethan Coen in this offbeat comedy entitled,The Ladykillers. This black comedy film directed, written and produced by the Coen brothers and starring Tom Hanks.

If you've never enjoyed Alec Guinness in the classic 1955 British comedy that inspired it, the Coen brothers' remake of The Ladykillers may well prove hilarious. For starters, it's got Tom Hanks in a variation of the Guinness role, eccentrically channeling Colonel Sanders, Tennessee Williams, and Edgar Allan Poe in his southern-fried performance as Prof. Goldthwait Higgins Dorr, Ph. D., a deliciously verbose con man who needs a secret headquarters for his five-man plot to rob a riverboat casino moored on the Mississippi. In the film's funniest and least-caricatured role, Irma P. Hall plays the churchgoing widow who rents a room to Dorr, whose crew of ""musicians"" use the lady's root cellar to tunnel to the casino's cash-rich counting room. Rampant mishaps ensue, the body count rises among Dorr's band of idiots, and the Coens put their uniquely stylish stamp on everything. It's a funny movie, allowing for some nagging flatness to the material, but if you've seen the original, you'll eventually wonder what were they thinking?

The Ladykillers is small and compact and it doesn't kill, it's just a doodle but it's a very pleasant cartoon for grown-ups. It's some sweet fodder. Also,despite cartoon characters, over-the-top hijinks, and occasional lapses of bad taste, any movie that leaves you laughing up the aisle, has to remain well-recommended. Hanks' performance in the lead role is inspired, but this is a relatively minor offering from the Coen brothers. While being far from the Coens' finest hour, it remains more intelligent and ambitious than most of what currently passes for Hollywood mainstream comedy. Finally,this film is good but not great and it is simple and somewhat funny plus 'nothing more.'",1433116800,,2047,5.256880733944954

2070075,3,B00029LNZA,"A largely-overlooked, forgotten later entry in the Coen brothers' catalog, though that might just be for a reason. At a glance, it's got all the hallmarks; a strong, curiously mixed cast; one wacky, dark-hinged plot; heaping portions of personality and charisma; tons of ambling, how-did-that-work dialog. But despite the familiar recipe, it never really comes together. There's a decided lack of magnitude to things, as if we've spent the entire running time waiting for some sort of revelation - an air of quiet respite that never departs. It's at once wicked and silly, both Coen staples, but superficially so. I don't think I'd snicker nearly as often on a second viewing. In some ways, it feels like an especially long SNL sendup of the auteurs' well-known idiosyncrasies. Tom Hanks certainly feels like he's playing a glaringly colorful caricature in the lead role, tackling an out-of-time southern gentleman as if he were Colonel Sanders. Supporting efforts from JK Simmons, Marlon Wayans and Tzi Ma are no less flamboyant, nor less frivolous. At worst I'd call it gaudy, shallow and watery, though not irredeemably so. At best? A spicy little caper picture, speckled with immeasurable quirks, that's light and swift at heart.",1413244800,,1233,5.17

2070081,5,B00029LNZA,"This is a great movie: funny and quirky, it is a classic Coen Brothers film. Coens' wit and ability to draw distinctive characters goes even further than the original screenplay written by William Rose, which is an impressive achievement in itself.

I've seen both the Ealing version, and this version, umpteen times. The Coen Brothers version is arguably stronger for its music, script, and creative and fascinating use of camera angles. As with the original, the acting here is a terrific ensemble set: all convince in their quirks and foibles and are compelling in their roles. From Tom Hanks' idiosyncratic laugh as The Professor, to Irma P. Hall (the owner of the house, who upsets the balance from the outset), to Marlon Wayans (an easily irate criminal), to the always wonderful J. K. Simmons.

2070104,5,B00029LNZA,"....with the Coen brothers unique touch, this is a hilarious movie, with unexpected combinations of characters that make for a memorable experience.
I watched the original The Ladykillers YEARS and years ago-it was a morbid delight.

This version sticks surprisingly well to the basic lines of the original-but updated and substituting characters from the south for jolly old England.

Quirky and filled with gospel music, the Coen brothers have done it again.

2 things I could have done without. The references to irritable bowl syndrome (YUCK), and the amount of language in the film.

True, it's part of the humour, but it could have been reduced.

Tom Hanks is slitheringly good as the verbose villian. For those who have seen the original with Alec Guiness, the idea for the way his 'teeth' are comes from that legendary actor. For the LadyKillers he added makeup etc., including the 'teeth', for he aparently worked from the outside appearance in.

Great acting kudos to the Lady herself.

I love Coen brother films also because you get to see people who are not the usual Hollywood slim-and-good-looking characters. The football player looks like he could have walked right off an old Normal Rockwell painting. I noticed this in another film, the use of actors who look like those we might see in a movie from the 40's or 50's.

Quite frankly, my girlfriend and I who loved ""O'Brother Where Art Thou"" found this movie to be:

1.) Boring.
2.) Over-acted
3.) Hard to understand without subtitles
4.) Plodding
5.) Pointless

Perhaps the humor wasn't for me, but there was just nothing funny about this movie. The scenes didn't feel very well connected and though I love Tom Hanks as an actor, this was not one of his best performances.

This is definitely a love/hate movie and I'm sad to say that I fall into the hate category. This is not a movie for a hot boring summer night, this is a movie to put on when you want your kids to fall asleep out of sheer boredom. There's nothing clever about the humor at all, it was like watching a badly done Looney Tunes episode.

I think what annoyed me the most was that Tom Hank's character used verbose words all the time. You know how sometimes authors like to write books just to hear themselves speak or use confusing language just for the sake of it? That's what his character does, and it gets very tiresome to hear it. There was just nothing interesting about the characters or the plots or the motivations or anything of that matter.

2070166,4,B00029LNZA,"I simply don't understand why more people aren't in love with this movie. Sure it's not perfect and the toilet humor is misplaced, but the language, the language of this film is like nothing I've ever heard anywhere. Only Quentin Tarantino and David Mamet films can compare in terms of language.

Tom Hanks (the Professor) and Irma Hall (Mrs. Munson) together, not apart, make this film. When the professor and the old black woman talk, speak, converse! with each other, he in his elevated educated idiom and she in her down-to-earth honest well-behaved talk, we are witnessing magic.

The Professor without Mrs. Munson speaks with affected pretension. Mrs. Munson without the Professor is still honest and full of vim but she is not especially wise. Consider this exchange between the two. Professor Dorr is relaxing with a book one evening in Mrs. Munson's living room. She is knitting. She observes he is ""a readin' fool"". He agrees that he is and that he finds in books the accumulated wisdom of manking.

MRS. MUNSON
Mm. The wisdom of mankind, huh? What about the wisdom of the Lord?

PROFESSOR DORR
Oh... Yes, yes. The Good Book, mm. I have found reward in its pages. But, to me, there are other good books as well. Heavy volumes of antiquity freighted with the insights of man's glorious age. And then, of course, I just love, love, love the works of Mr. Edgar Allan Poe.

MRS. MUNSON
Oh, I know who he was. Kinda spooky.

PROFESSOR DORR
No, madam, no, no. Not of this world, it's true. He... he lived in a dream. An ancient dream.

The Professor calls her madam, he talks to her as a person and addresses her in the finest language. He goes on to recite from memory Poe's ""To Helen"". Mrs Munson doesn't speak as he does, she speaks her own words her own way, but she doesn't miss a thing.

The whole movie is like that. It's full of clever language, but when Hanks and Hall appear together cleverness disappears and in its stead you will hear some of the most musical dialogue in your life.

2070167,5,B00029LNZA,"THE LADYKILLERS is a comedy; well, actually it's a semi-dark farce with a touch of mystery. Irma P. Hull stars as Marva Munson, a widowed woman living not far from the river in the state of Mississippi. She advertises a room for rent in her house which is answered by Dr. G.H.Dorr (Tom Hanks). Dorr's sole reason for renting the room is so that he and his ""classical"" ensemble can rehearse in Mrs. Munson's root cellar. Well, actually Dorr is the only musician and the only thing he's directing is a scheme to rob the riverboat casino of 1.6 million dollars. The root cellar is the perfect place to dig a tunnel to the bank vault. And so the escapades begin. The team Dorr has assembled include a commercial prop master who suffers from serious bowl trouble, a Chinese general who looks like Hitler and who runs a local doughnut shop, a very stupid college football player, and a young African-American man who has just started working at the casino. Their heist isn't as complicated as robbing a Vegas casino, but the problems are no less difficult. But, Ocean's Eleven this isn't.

The movie starts off slow and initially doesn't seem to make any sense. But then all the pieces begin to fall into place and the humor revs up. THE LADYKILLERS is an unusual comedy because it offers several layers of humor all at one time. For instance, there are fart jokes that coincide with witty verbal melee. That doesn't happen very often in movies. About 3/4ths of the way through the film, things seem to slow down again (seem being the key word), but soon the pace picks up until the movie ends at the same place it began.

THE LADYKILLERS is quirky, interesting, and fun to watch. It's also a joy seeing Tom Hanks get back into his comical roots. Combine all of that along with the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe, a rocking-gospel music soundtrack, Marlon Wayons, and some simple faith and you've got one of the most intriguing movies from 2004.",1338768000,,1934,4.586705202312139

I agree it's a shame because it is such a great screenplay with an atypical and interesting story that I would have loved to let my kids see it.

I think it's pointless to compare it to the original 'Ladykillers' with Alec Guinness. Both are fantastic films told in completely different styles. Tom Hanks is brilliant, as is J.K. Simmons and the rest of  the cast.  As is typical with many Coen Brothers movies you have to pay attention and listen for esoteric jokes. The 'blowing the shofar' miscommunication is a prime example.
This movie is a pure hoot and is great for repeat viewings.

All in all, it was a sadly unfunny waste of talent.

The Coen brothers really deliver on this one with a great cast of misfits led by Mr Tom Hanks in my opinion his best role ever,sorry Forrest Gump..I say this because Hanks is always the protagonist in mainstream feel good movies made to please the general public. In this we get to see another side
a devilish and cunningly so bad he's good side as the antagonist Proffessor Dorr..The way he carries himself as Dorr with the style,tone,and just embelishe's the character so well that it's just flat out brilliant..So artistic,so well educated,but underneath all the bs,big words,and southern charm he is a mentally deranged and
very devious human being..The rest of the cast is brilliant as well it's never clearly told to you how they met or anything it's like they just simply are what they are..And the second best part of the movie beside Hanks is Irma P hall,the protagonist. She is absolutely adorable and hilarious as the Very religious,God fearin widow
who rents her cellar to Dorr..What ensues after is pure Coen Brother mayhem..The movie is so unique in it's good v.s. evil undertones,and very artistic and smart in
almost every way,with the music,atmosphere,I mean the movie takes place in modern day,but it looks and feels at times like it's happening back in the 20's,and of course all the writing for Hanks with the double talk,twisted analogy's,and just the way no matter what happens he never once in the film breaks his character,never
even raises his voice..Anyone who craps on this movie just doesn't understand it and can't really see the big picture and overall message/plot of the movie.

As if a remake or re imagining could only succeed if it were as exact to the original as possible and no more. I get the feeling these same people would complain if it was as exact to the original in every respect yet one character was missing his moustache: Travesty!

Reviewers coming to this with fond memories of Alex Guinness and his murderous mob do seem to miss the point entirely: it's not going to be an Ealing comedy, it's a Coen brothers movie; and as dark and twisted as ever the Coens have been. With a fresh pair of eyes and some back knowledge of their work, The Ladykillers is an underrated little gem that sits nicely alongside&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barton-Fink/dp/B00008RH3J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barton Fink</a>&nbsp;in their repertoire; not on a par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raising-Arizona/dp/B00006LPGP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raising Arizona</a>&nbsp;and not as finely rounded as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fargo/dp/B00009W5CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fargo</a>&nbsp;but certainly not the shambles claimed by the purists.

Hanks' is undoubtedly a star choice for lead and bares the brunt of much criticism from some reviewers: how can sweet Tom Hanks be so mean?!? But his OTT Col. Saunders and Southern smarm work and he brings a charming malevolence to the film. The Coens have given him some, almost&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Withnail-and-I/dp/B004ALIG4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Withnail and I</a>&nbsp;worthy, quotable scenes and he's surrounded by some of the best Coen brothers characters.

All the quirks of the ensemble cast lead to their undoing in some way with the excellent Irma P. Hall getting the better of them without lifting a finger.

True, none of these characters are loveable East-End buffoons and the old lady is hardly sweet but it's a Coen brothers movie: it's dark, it's black, vicious, deluded, smug and funny. There is nothing quaint here, nothing English and nothing Ealing. Only the basic premise remains from the original. The only real mistake was to weigh the movie down with such a familiar title. Reviewers hooked up on that really shouldn't be given any more credence than any other proselytising, red-faced, stick-in-the-mud, end-of-the-world-is-nigh buffoon.

That's the case with this film: I own it and have watched it many times and it seems to improve with each viewing. This folks, is a very funny movie and Tom Hanks is great, as are--not surprisingly, considering the Coen Bros gift for casting--virtually all of the actors in this film.

The film is, very briefly, the story of a small band of incompetent thieves who decide to try and fleece a floating casino in Mississippi. The plot may be a little thin, but it's a good enough premise to keep you watching. What shines in this film is the dialog and the acting. The opening scene of the film, of an old woman going to the local police department, not to complain about the loud music of a local kid's boom box, but to ask the sheriff to help the kid, is just hilarious. The cops are napping on the job, the woman is all fired up with good Christian intentions and the actress (I don't know her name offhand) delivers an extremely funny line about rap music that I won't spoil.

The rest of the film just follows the the robbers on their journey into crime and, again, while the plot is a bit thin, the actors (and, in particular, Tom Hanks) are absolutely enjoyable.

If you're looking for a funny film for a hot summer night, you'll like this. The negative reviews seem so hostile you'd think the movie cost a few hundred bucks.

2070192,3,B00029LNZA,"This film is essentially a remake of a very well done 1950s British Comedy. The remake is a mixed bag of good ideas and bad ideas that ultimately fails. But there are dashes of brilliance among the wreckage.

Tom Hanks does work playing an over the top southern gentlemen who is in reality anything but. The character and the mannerisms come across very well. The performance and the little touches in it are so well done that its shame they were wasted in this movie. But I fear that its a character that will not go over well with the typical American audience.

The first place the film goes seriously wrong is in the casting of Irma P. Hall. She and the character she plays are completely wrong for the material. The character and the casting are completely opposite to the original. She plays the big bossy loudmouth stereotype and that character just doesn't work with what Hanks is doing. The movie ends up trying to be two different things at the same time and each wrecks the other. You can't be a remake of a subtile British Comedy and a Tyler Perry/Eddie Murphy big momma movie at the same time. Its not that Hanks or Hall do anything wrong. Its just one or the other of them had to modify their character to make the film work.

The other place the film goes wrong is that actors that make up Hank's ""gang"" are broadly drawn cyphers. Marlon Wayans runs his mouth which is supposed to be funny but isn't in the least. The others are not much better. They are all used more-or-less as props because Hanks keeps all the acting to himself. Some of the comedy bits they do are good. Some are not. But their use puts all the more pressure on the performances of Hall and Hanks which, as said before, are at odds with each other.

To sum up, the problem is that the people who made the film created a wonderful role and character for Tom Hanks but neglected to build a working film around it.",1293580800,,1897,4.380681818181818

2070194,5,B00029LNZA,"I normally don't care much for remakes, as there's rarely any good reason for them. (See my comments about such in my ""King Kong"" review.) The Coen brothers' take on the classic Ealing comedy is, surprisingly, a huge improvement.

Part of this improvement is wholly subjective. The Coens have thoroughly Americanized the characters and story, making them more immediately appealing to an American audience.

They've also had the opportunity to analyze and rethink the original. The result is a wittier, funnier, and better-plotted script, that provides Tom Hanks the opportunity for a comic turn that easily outdoes Alec Guinness. I also like the cleverer (and less-nasty) ways the thieves are ""offed"" at the end.

The Coens do tend to delight in making their characters look stupid, and they're particularly obnoxious in this film. Marva Munson, the woman who rents a room to The Professor, enjoys sending a $5 check each month to Bob Jones University, a seat of higher learning well-known for its racially obnoxious policies. She comes off looking not only ignorant and stupid, but /insufferably/ ignorant and stupid. This leaves a slight bitter after-taste that is at least partly compensated for by the fact that her character is not quite so dense as the ""lady"" in the original.

Still, the Coen brothers have pulled off the small miracle of a remake that easily outclasses its classic predecessor. The almost perfectly even distribution of Amazon ratings probably reflects individual prejudice. Either you believe a classic British film (with Sir Eric Goodness, no less) cannot be improved on, or you are willing to give the Coens the benefit of the doubt. I urge you to do the latter.

2070196,5,B00029LNZA,"Ever since I first watched this film a couple years ago, I have been amazed at the bad rap it has gotten. It is just about lost as an entry in the Coen Brothers' formidable body of work, and yet I believe it is unjustly condemned. Many people do not see past the crude one-liners and stereotyped characters into the visual poetry and subtle irony that make it funny on a completely different level from the one that floats on the surface (like the barge that carries the trash of the town to the allegorically mythical ""garbage island"" in the movie).

For one thing, I really enjoyed the ""Seven Samurai"" method of gathering the caper gang, with the individual introductions showcasing not their strengths but their unique foibles and own personal brands of idiocy to be concentrated once they are gathered into Tom Hanks' professorial circle of ""musician"" thieves. On one hand, they work well together, their ostensible reasons for hiring being their professed qualifications; but as their acquaintances deepen, the broad individual comedy becomes syncretic and we are treated to the amusing spectacle of a bungling ex-hippie liberal civil rights activist spouting his old left-wing dogma to a modern gangsta black man who just doesn't give a crap ""because I don't vote."" The resumes are delicately presented by Hanks' too-genteel Professor Dorr; I guffawed when he introduced ""The General"" (Tzi Ma in a wonderfully understated and yet physically deft performance reminiscent of W.C. Fields or a dachshund-take your pick) as a man with ""massive tunneling experience in the jungles of Southeast Asia,"" thus suggesting the Viet Cong without coming out and saying it.

Hanks himself is the very picture of an overdone Southern gentleman, so much so that we can scarcely believe it to be a real person he's portraying but that it must be a put-on. Professor Dorr is presented with imagery that suggests the entry of Old Scratch himself, his unusual curled coiffure suggesting horns and his smooth Southern gentleman act the very picture of the obvious liar and con-man. Ms. Munson is at first charmed and then, as she discerns the nature of his character, she sees right through the ""doubletalk."" Oddly, Dorr's caricature persona sticks even throughout the travails of the caper; even when he is under stress and in private, he does not break the ""Professor Dorr"" mask of character; his portrayal leads us to wonder if Dorr is more of a mental case than a hardened criminal. For one thing, he doesn't seem to be in need of money. He easily sends Ms. Munson and a friend to a concert many miles away in a limo; for Professor Dorr, it is the artistic nature of the ""perfect crime"" that interests him, not so much getting rich, although it is definitely a factor (here he seems to approach the Guinness character more closely).

The Coen brothers suggest by music, Bible verse and various sinister signs that perhaps Dorr is an agent of Satan, a test for the pure-hearted Ms. Munson. Irma Hall in this role is just unforgettable; the very picture of a god-fearing, principled and feisty old black lady who takes her preacher very seriously but doesn't quite understand what he's saying. When she goes on about ""tunkeloparzen"" at the Sheriff's office, it is gibberish, but somehow she is trying to quote the sermon from Daniel, Chapter 5, on the ""writing on the wall"" (Mene mene tekel upharsen) at the Feast of Belshazzar but fails and creates the idea in the minds of the underemployed members of the Sheriff's office that she's got several screws loose. (Incidentally, this message in the Bible is written by a disembodied finger, thus linking the beginning and end of this film with perfectly symmetrical Biblical imagery--the warning of the kingdom about to fall).

It is, in essence, a tale of heavenly and poetic justice. Everyone gets his or her just rewards, but the road by which this happens is fraught with supreme irony; and the one-liners and stereotypes are but window-dressing in this allegorical tale.

There are many elements shared from the earlier Ealing Studios film, but this entry is so thoroughly reworked and imbued with not only deep symbolic imagery but with over-the-top modern caricature that it defies being pigeonholed as a ""crude comedy,"" which has been the won't of some reviewers. What you get out of this film depends on how closely you look at it and how finely developed your sense of ironic humor is. The parts described by some as ""boring"" are actually points of characterization and also setups for later ironic denouements. One could almost say that Poe's Imp of the Perverse was driving the action: the gangsta puts on his act but in the end he is moved by something very un-gangstalike. The ex-hippie liberal makes a show of caring for the rights of the underdog but is, in the end, just a greedy whiner whose very biological being is also ""irritated."" Lump is clueless, but by the time he gets a clue, well...you'll see. And The General I cannot praise highly enough. He has very little dialogue but evokes the spirit of W.C. Fields in many ways. In fact, I think the cigarette trick he does is one of Fields' tricks. He can also put on the face of the ""innocent dachshund"" when Ms. Munson reprimands him to perfection. And yet, of all of them, he seems to be the most hardened of tough guys. My favorite of his quotes, when asked by Dorr if there isn't a ""middle way"" according to Buddhism: ""You must float like a leaf on the river of life...and kill old lady."" So we see Buddhism doesn't offer the wicked a way out either! (Sorry, I find that funny).

To sum up I will say that this film may be enjoyed on several levels; those of you who are jaded with the stereotypical comedic portrayals of the gathered criminals may turn it off, disgusted with the lack of fresh characterization, but if one views the whole with the visual cues that suggest Mississippi as a balmy stage for a bizarre battle between good and evil and the poetic irony that assails the criminals in the most hilarious manner possible--the movie becomes both sublime AND ridiculous. The sermons, seen by many as unnecessary and run-on, closely accord with the action and the tests put before Ms. Munson. Even though she seems to miss the intended message sometimes, she is pure of heart and therefore beloved of God.

An interesting note about her dead husband, Othar: it is possible that he may be based in part on the well-known fife player Othar Turner, who also ""burned his own fife,"" as Ms. Munson is telling Professor Dorr in a quiet scene. This same scene also contains a horrid joke about ""blowing the shofar,"" which has to be explained to us Gentiles, but to a Jew it'd be a side-splitter, if a crude one. But that about sums up the way comedy is presented in this film. The most hilarious parts are not always the ones that are the most obvious, but as a whole, it is transcendentally funny. Did I mention how beautiful the photography is in this film? The motif of the garbage barge moving slowly through, receiving the refuse from the caper, inexorable but undeniable, the gargoyles of the bridge performing their ancient functions with the help of Poe's raven... the sleepy Southern town purges its evil. This film is both comedic and highly artistic, and I'd expect no less from the Coen Brothers.",1248220800,59,7317,4.7657728706624605

2070209,3,B00029LNZA,"Despite his two Academy awards for the dreadful Philadelphia and Forrest Gump Tom Hanks has never, not once, ever sold me on his dramatic acting abilities. I remember him from that lame 1980s transvestite sitcom with the little blond dweeb who later starred on Newhart. Whenever he tries to emote Hanks just looks silly and cannot help but have a goofy grin on his face. As pallid as his dramatic ability is he is, and has always been, a gifted comedian.
  This talent has never been put to better use than in the most recent comedy from the Coen Brothers, The LadyKillers, which is a remake of a 1950s comedy from the U.K. that starred Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers. Having never seen the original I can only say that even were that at the comedic level of Dr. Strangelove it would not alter the fact that this is one flat-out hilarious film. Basically, it's a comedic heist film in which a sad sack troupe of gangsters tries to rip off a floating casino in Mississippi by tunneling into its vault from an old black lady's cellar. To accomplish this the ringleader, G.H. Dorr (Hanks), poses as a college professor. Along with him are a young black punk, Gawain MacSam (Marlon Wayans), a former Vietnamese general (Tzi Ma), a dopey munitions expert, Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons- who plays J. Jonah Hameson in the Spider-Man franchise), and a big dumb lump of a football player named Lump Hudson (Ryan Hurst). The old lady, Marva Munson, is wonderfully played by Irma P. Hall.
  The LadyKillers is not a film for the ages, but it is one that when a little blue you can just pop it in the DVD and laugh yourself silly. That said, the DVD had a nice transfer- very crisp and in some places the film even looked like videotape. I don't know whether it was shot digitally, however. The music plays well, especially in assorted gospel scenes. There are only a few extra- standard featurettes on the film, but one extended outtakes scene that is funny- a scene where Marva is slapping Gawain silly for his use of profanity. As with everything else on this DVD it's funny as hell, and most recommended.",1221782400,,2096,4.581333333333333
2070210,4,B00029LNZA,"Hey, I liked it.  This is a remake of the wonderful film of the same name starring Alec Guiness.  It does not quite live up to the original but it's good in and of itself.  The scene has changed from London to Hattiesburg, Mississippi and the Guiness character is Tom Hanks as the Edgar Allen Poe look alike, a silver-tongued cad.  He cons an old lady into renting him a room and permitting him and his band members to practice their renaissance rococco music in her root cellar.

The problem is, these guys aren't musicians.  They are a group of criminal misfits bent on digging a tunnel from the root cellar into the vault of a nearby casino.  There are numerous misadventures including the premature detonation of a bomb which blows off one of the crook's fingers.  There are also personal animosities especially between one of the white hoodlums and a black crook who can't speak without the use of four letter words.  Hanks, with his quick wit, charm and smooth talk, is always there to mediate between his stupid and otherwise murderous brethren.

On the day of the planned heist, Hanks gets the old lady out of the house by buying her a ticket to a gospel singing concert.  The robbery goes off as planned but the old lady has come home early, planning on a tea and a music recital for her friends.  A bomb is blown to collapse the tunnel behind them and the old lady is alerted to foul play.

Hanks is obliged to admit that they are truly outlaws but, after all, they only stole from a den of iniquity and half of the proceeds of the robbery are to be donated to Bob Jones University.  The old lady won't compromise their principles but tells them she won't inform on them if they give the money back and attend church with her next Sunday.  Hanks says he'll have to confer with his gang.

Confer he does...Confer as to who will bump the old lady off.  Nobody wants to do it so they draw straws.  There is a whole series of deadly misadventures in which the whole gang methodically bumps each other off.  Hanks is the only one left.  Standing on the bridge, quoting his favorite poet--Edgar Allen Poe--a nearby raven knocks a stone off a tower and hits Hanks in the head.  Along with his criminal partners, he falls from the bridge.  The old lady give all the money to Bob Jones University.

The Ladykillers is not a bad movie, but considering the quality of its creators, its mediocrity comes as quite a shock. I don't agree with the other reviewers in regards to Tom Hanks.

It apparently tries to be all these things.

What it ACTUALLY is is an unfunny, schizophrenic, mean-spirited mess.

The movie starts out with great promise. Tom Hanks stars as what appears to be a somewhat-pompous, Edgar Allan Poe-quoting, Colonel Sanders vest-wearing, over-educated, genteel Southern professor of Renaissance music. What he actually is is a (still-likable) con-man and swindler. At least, that's what he starts out as at the beginning of the film. His dialogue is supurb, his accent and portrayal spot-on.

He decides he wants to rob a casino. In order to do this he devises a scheme to tunnel into the casino's counting room from underground. To fascilitate his plan, he lets a room in an old woman's house close to the casino, and convinces his landlady that he actually needs her basement to practice with his band of musicians. He cobbles together an unlikely assemblage of partners in crime, which include a Chinese general who has a Hitler complex (he even has a Hitler mustache), a strange jack-of-all-trades and explosives expert who can't stop farting, a stupid football player to do the digging, and Marlon Wayans, who plays the beyond-stereotypical black thug who loves rap music and constantly threatens to shoot people with his gun while yelling expletives. The Chinese general has a total dialogue of four words the entire movie (I'm not kidding, I counted!) and the football player about 12. What the point of those two characters was I'm not really sure.

Now, you'd think that with such a motley crew, there would be slapstick humor galore. Well, nope. There are ""incidents"" which often revolve around farting, one scene where a guy blows his finger off with explosives (I THINK that was supposed to be funny---it's tough to tell) and a lot of scenes with Mr Wayans saying ""F-this"" and ""F-that"" while waving his gun around.

Still, for the first 75% of the movie, I was still fascinated--simply because Tom Hanks' character is so unique and so memorable. His genteel humor and dialogue (which seems to come directly out of PhD theses on esoteric medieval literature, Rococo music theory and Edgar Allan Poe) and his portrayal of such is fascinating. Unfortunately, even that is not enough to carry the movie, as it loses focus and becomes mean-spirited about 3/4 though the movie.

After what appears to be an attempt at a quirky buddy-caper flick, about 3/4 through the robbers decide that it is necessary to kill their landlady. They are very serious about this. Suddenly things aren't funny anymore. Marlon Wayans' character gets killed in a struggle with the farting explosives expert after he attempts to kill the landlady. This is not funny. He is not killed in a funny way--- and why is there suddenly killing anyway, when the tone of the movie up to that point had been slapstick humor? They dump his body off a bridge onto a garbage barge going down the river. Not long afterwards, the Chinese general kills the explosives expert by choking him graphically with piano wire while he is farting. Apparently this is also supposed to be funny --- but is actually extremely not funny. It is sick and disturbing. They dump his body off the bridge onto a garbage barge going down a river. Soon after the Chinese general tries to kill the landlady and kills himself by accidentally falling down the stairs. Body to garbage barge. Tom Hanks tries to convince the football player to kill the landlady. He refuses, but accidentally shoots himself in the face with the gun while on the bridge. His body falls of it's own volition onto the garbage barge. This is extremely graphic, violent and not funny. Finally, a head of a gargoyle falls off the bridge and hits Tom Hanks on the head, and his body falls into the garbarge barge, too. Everyone's dead. The landlady keeps the money.

What's the point?

If it wasn't for the quirky performance Tom Hanks gave, this would have been a one-star for me.

Unfortunately, the Coens just didn't seem to get it and make one disastrous change in their remake: Mrs Lopsidey is now a huge, loud, obnoxious, hateful and extremely violent black woman who you want dead on sight. Not only do the crooks never stand a chance, but within seconds of her first scene you have no desire to watch a minute more.

Things improve slightly when Tom Hanks' loquacious decayed Southern gentleman appears, but he's fighting a losing battle with her spite and vindictiveness. They then compound the error by casting Marlon Wayans, whose ability to spout obscenities is almost miraculously untouched by the ability to make any of them remotely funny. Thus the stage is set for the Coen's worst movie, and one that alternates too few genuinely funny scenes - most involving J.K. Simmons and Tzi Ma's early scenes before the script run out of good ideas for them - with moments of pure torture (the less said about Ryan Hurst's painfully misfired performance as the dumb lummox of the gang the better).

2070235,3,B00029LNZA,"The Coen Brothers have slipped.  It was inevitable, nothing so good could ever last for so long without a fall.  Since their mid-80's debut Blood Simple, they have delivered more films than most directors manage in an entire lifetime, and each film has pushed boundaries and tickled expectations.  After the commercial success brought by Fargo, the Coen brothers movies have generally become more relaxed and comical - more Raising Arizona than Blood Simple, with the exception of their last great work, The Man Who Wasn't There.

Intolerable Cruelty was a different film for the Coen Brothers, different from their past work in that it had a plot with a more conventional Hollywood ending and rather tame subject matter.  Unlike previous works, IC borrows from the Coen Brothers' extensive oeuvre of work but contributes little, and more significantly, it takes place outside the Coen Brothers characteristic universe of hyper-reality mixed with black humor and a shot of existentialism.

The Ladykillers takes up where IC left off.  The Coen Brothers go through the motions, but this time, without the killer script that IC had, LK falls flat.  Without doubt, this is the Coen Brothers first great failure in film making.  Listing all the reasons why LK is a bad movie would only reiterate the points others have made here previously far better than I could have (although I'm mystified by the all the pretentious braying over profanity).  But while LK is unrewarding as a film viewing experience, it is quite devastating to me as a Coen Brothers fan.  If the Coen Brothers were a rock band, LK would be their ""reunion album,"" a studio project patched together by a bunch of middle aged men who've lost their passion.  It is always hard to watch even as great artists publicly thrash and grope their way out of  the creative doldrums.

Perhaps the Brothers could use a sabbatical, or something else entirely, like the making of a few political documentaries.  Or like Stanley Kubrick, they could go into hiding and emerge after sustained periods of regeneration with a searingly brilliant film as a snapshot of their slowly evolving perspective.  The pace of Coen Brothers' releases since the mid-80s has been breathtaking, and nobody could fault them for easing into a steady gallop as they pass into middle age.  Or maybe something more obvious is afoot, like the Brothers swapped wives and then got all funky over it.  There's no telling why they've slipped, but a falling out of the Coen Brothers artistic relationship would be a great loss to American Cinema.",1139097600,2,2566,4.969555035128805

Tom Hanks is a pretty good actor but in this film I'd have to say his acting was about as good as a retarded old man trying to play the title role in ""The life of marilyn Monroe"". The language used in this film is horrendous to say the least. Every other word was the ""F"" word and in some films it fits. But in this film it fit about as good as the elephant man in a motorcycle helmet. I wish I could only give it 1 star but what the heck, I guess the key grip deserves it.

2070238,4,B00029LNZA,"This remake of the Ealing classic starring Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers is not the best Coen film, most fans would agree with that. But, even a flawed Coen brother's film is better than most of the choice out there.

The score and soundtrack is, unsurprisingly for a Coen flick, brilliant and switches from merry to mischievious mood depending on the characters and settings. The gospel music is also wonderfully done.

Tom Hanks is great as an eccentric southern dandy with impecible manners, flawed only by his unwavering desire for deviant mastermind criminality. Only, his band of brothers are cursed with an ineptitude of gigantic proportions (all fail in their task to kill the old lady, played with righteous zeal by Marver Munson).

My favourite character is the General, played by Tzi Ma - an oriental, chain-smoking, and emotionless criminal who has a desire to stick his fingers right up peoples noses (in particlur armed robbers). Ryan Hurst plays Lump Hudson, a not too bright American Football player. He is the only character who has a moral conflict when it comes to 'bumping' off the old lady.

My favourite scene is when the local Sheriff calls at the old lady's house and Tom Hank's character, Prof. G.H. Dorr - not wishing to be discovered - hides under his bed. The old lady looks under the bed and says 'Professor, what are you doing under there?'. She then laughs and says to the sheriff 'Come and say hello to the professor.' The sheriff rolls his eyes (thinking she is losing her marbles) and leaves.

I really enjoyed this film and it's southern quirky charm. If you are not too sure whether you would like this film or not, I suggest renting it first.",1133481600,5,1681,4.743150684931507
2070239,1,B00029LNZA,"*** This comment contains spoilers ***

I didn't see much merit to this film. ""Intolerable Cruelty"" was amazingly good and clever with great dialog. This one doesn't even come into the ""almost clever"" range. (Both movies were written by the Coen brothers.)

Example: From the trailer, you have seen Tom Hanks insist that ""we must all have waffles forthwith."" That's not funny. I didn't laugh when he said that. That's one of the big laugh lines in the movie, and it's just not funny.

I don't think that much of this movie is funny at all. I don't remember laughing at all and I don't remember the audience laughing either, and I pay attention to that.

The plot is straightforward. It follows a single thread from beginning to end. There is one twist, but that twist exists in every caper movie you've ever seen (that is, someone turns on the team), so you expect it and it happens right on cue, and in no clever way.

Ok, the ending scenes are unexpected. I certainly never expected people to get killed off like that. But I didn't think that was funny, and I don't enjoy watching characters that I have come to like get killed. The first and second killings were in no way funny, they weren't even intended to be funny. The last two killings were especially disturbing. And for the last killing??? What are we watching Hannibal Lechter now? When that happened I felt a cold shock wash over the audience and we were all hushed from there on out.

The device used for the second to last killing was also used in ""Intolerable Cruelty."" That repeat is unforgivable, unless the Coens want to make a running gag in their movies of how many ways people can shoot themselves. However, in ""Cruelty"" the audience howled with laughter. In this movie I just heard a few nervous laughs, because it flat was not funny. Either way, I, personally, am still not jaded to such an extent to have lost so much sensitivity that I think watching people kill themselves is entertainment.

There is constant use of the F word. When it first began I was shocked. After I got used to it I'll admit that it was funny, the movie is rated ""R,"" and I do know people that talk that way. If you enjoy the kind of humor that depends on foul language, that's fine. I left that behind me in 7th grade and have moved on to higher pursuits by now.

My rating: F. Waste of film.",1131926400,4,2343,4.445221445221446
2070240,3,B00029LNZA,"Many, many reviewers and professional critics have panned this 2004 re-make of the classic Ealing/Alec Guinness opus, saying it doesn't quite make the mark and that Tom Hanks was off-form and too blathery. Those who have read my other reviews know that I'm not a blind fan of the Coen brothers, who I think run hot and cold, between genius and god-awful.  With the Ladykillers, I was proven wrong- this film is neither; it's just a pretty decent chuckle.

To watch this film, you have to accept that it is wacky and very over the top in a slightly less than slapstick way.  if you can do that, the inane plot of verbose Professor Dorr and his gang of inept robbers tunneling into a casino riverboat is actually funny.  They borrow the home of Irma Hall, who delivers a superb performance.  The ever-changing portraits of her deceased husband are an homage to 'Mousehunt' and her naive donations to Bob Jones University are a hoot!

There is also a humor in the repeated, ever-evolving sequences, such as the garbage scow/body disposal and the escalating injuries of the cast.

On the whole, the film would have benefited from being a little more tightly wound and from Hanks taking his Dorr character down a notch.

But still, a good comedy, really.  Not a five star job, but 3 stars and worth a watch if you're in the right frame of mind.",1127088000,6,1339,4.592436974789916

But of all the Cohen Brothers movies I've seen, I think The Ladykillers is my favorite. In the film, the elderly Marva Munson, a church-going widow who donates regularly to Bob Jones University, rents her spare room to the talkative professor Goldwaith Higginson Dorr, Ph. D. (played by Tom Hanks). Unbeknownst to Munson, Dorr has ulterior motives for wanting to take up residence in her home. Her gracious Southern house practically abuts the underground counting room of the nearby Bandit Queen Casino. Not only that, Munson's house has a convenient root cellar from which the cunning Dorr plans to tunnel into the vault.

To gain uninterrupted access to the root cellar, Dorr tells the gullible widow that he needs a rehearsal space for his medieval musical group. (Knowing she is a religious woman, Dorr notes that most of his group's works were ""commissioned by the Holy See!"" What a hoot!) Of course, Dorr's ""musicians"" are nothing more than conspirators to his plan. What ensues is an engaging criminal caper movie featuring one of the most interesting collections of characters I've seen on the modern screen.

Tough-talking Gawain (Marlon Wayans) works on the casino's janitorial staff; Pancake (J.K. Simmons) is a camera prop-man with explosives expertise; the tight-lipped General (Tzi Ma) is valuable to the team due to his tunneling abilities; and the vacuous Lump is the brawn behind the enterprise. Of course, the poetry-reciting Dorr is the mastermind behind the entire plan.

While the bumbling team of thieves is successful in stealing the money, their erstwhile landlord catches on to the crime. When Dorr tries to convince her to take a share of the money in return for her silence, she refuses, insisting that the money be returned and the whole gang attend church with her the following Sunday.

After a brief conference, the criminals decide that someone has to kill the old lady.

I thought this was a fabulous film. I wouldn't call it belly-laugh funny, but it will definitely keep you smiling throughout. Hanks is superb as Dorr, playing a character unlike any I've seen him play before. Irma P. Hall, who plays the squeaky-clean Marva Munson, gives Hanks a run for his money. The ironic ending, and particularly the final destination of the pilfered money, were both clever surprises.

While I highly recommend this film, it is not suitable for young children. While any violence in the movie is rather bumbling and comedic, there is quite a bit of foul language in certain scenes (particularly in the case of Marlon Wayans' character.)",1126656000,4,2684,5.006726457399103

Dorr, and is supported by a fine cast (Including Irma P. Hall, J.K. Simmons, and Ryan Hurst). The only problem I have with the film is Marlon Wayans, who is one of the most annoying actors in Hollywood. His comedy is never funny, and his acting is never good. However, the rest of the cast, the many comedic moments, and the great gospel music make up for a lot. Fans of the Coens Brothers, and of good comedies, will surely enjoy it.

They must have thought they had a winner here, but someone needs to sit down with the Coen Brothers and give them a stern talking to.  There's no sense in trying to teach Tom Hanks anything, the critical acclaim and the love of a vast international public have made him impervious to the outside world, but he is coming close to self-parody with this one.  We all know he's this generation's James Stewart but now he's trying to st-r-e-t-ch into a combination Guinness and Sellers as well.  They must have thought, the public can't be wrong and also, we're lucky to get him into our independent, quirky little movie.  They were wrong on both counts.  Maybe THE LADYKILLERS would have been a better picture if William Macy or John Turturro had taken the lead.  Either actor might have taken direction better than Tom Hanks did.

As for the notion that the movie has old-fashioned racist sympathies, in that all of the black characters come across like jackasses, if not morons, well, the Coen Brothers probably have the answer to that one too.  In the theater I was watching the movie at, the silence was painful.  Not one person laughed even once.  It was almost as though we were watching JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG or PHILADELPHIA instead of what was ostensibly a comedy picture.  The more silent we remained, the louder the action on screen, as Hanks & Company started shouting their way through their lines.

2070254,3,B00029LNZA,"There is much to love in the Coen brothers' recent offering, ""The Ladykillers.""  It's easy to imagine the ""pitch"" going very well.  Joel and Ethan Coen are among today's most prolific and successful writer/director/producer teams.  They've proven that they can do well using the South -- both culturally and musically -- as a vehicle, as they did so magnificently in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""  And they've landed Tom Hanks to play the lead, a fast-talking Southern gentleman with a criminal mind.

This combination was easily enough to overcome any possible concerns about remaking one of the more beloved British comedies, 1955's film by the same name which starred Alec Guiness in the lead and featured a young Peter Sellers among other worthy actors.  Many film critics disliked the Coens' remake on sight merely for remaking this ""classic"" film.

Not having seen the original, I can only judge this movie on its own merits, and I regret to say that it must fall into the category of the lesser Coen brothers' films.  Full disclosure -- ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""Fargo,"" and ""O Brother"" are among my favorites.

Components of the movie are a delight.  Tom Hanks does a wonderful job as the slick criminal ""mastermind,"" Professor G.H. Dorr -- as in love with the sound of his own voice as he is with his own brilliance (and that's saying something).  Dr. Dorr lets a room from the delightful Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall), an exemplary African-American Southern Baptist widow who carries on a no-nonsense dialogue with the portrait of her dead husband when she's not writing $5 checks to Bob Jones University (!).

While Dorr's cover story is that he wants to use Ms. Munson's ""root cellar"" -- ""basement"" is too pedestrian a word for Dr. Dorr -- as a rehearsal stage for his Renaissance ensemble, Dr. Dorr really needs access to the basement to tunnel into the counting room of the local riverboat-casino operations.  To do so, Dorr assembles a typically-wacky bunch of criminals.  Some of these characters work, like the explosives expert who also suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, while others are more of an annoyance, including Marlon Wayans' god-awfully irritating smart-mouth janitor and Ryan Hurst's dumber-than-dumb football player.

A word about Marlon Wayans -- I cannot stand his performance.  His rendition of a profane, horny, rude, lazy, arrogant janitor grates on the nerves, if only because this is how Wayans has acted every time I've ever seen him on-screen.  Based on his continued appearances in movies like ""Scary Movie,"" some people like this guy's screen persona, but for me, put him together with Pauly Shore and David Spade (without Chris Farley) in the Brotherhood of Comic Actors Banned from Movies 'Cause They Are Not Funny.  Yeesh, what a bore!

As one can expect in a Coen brothers' film, the music is wonderuful -- we get several gospel songs that raise the roof -- and there are demonstrations of mastery of cinematography, clever writing, and black humor.  And there's a high body-count.

But the movie fails to click despite all these elements.  Perhaps it's because the straightforward plot (the robbery) is not given many wrinkles -- compare this movie to the dizzying plot developments of other Coen brothers' films and it's razor-thin.  There just doesn't to be a lot of meat on this bone, and despite the apparently-best-efforts of all concerned (again, with the lamentable exception of young Mr. Wayans), the result is a less-than-satisfying meal.",1112572800,2,3491,5.022569444444445

In the interest of full disclosure, let me state right up front that the 1955 Ealing Brothers classic, ""The Ladykillers,"" ranks as one of my all-time favorite comedies.  A masterpiece of tone, the film, written by William Rose and directed by Alexander MacKendrick, is not only a sweet and gentle tale full of subtle wit and endearing whimsy but also a murderously funny black comedy centered on homicide and death.  A group of thieves, planning a heist, rent a room from an old lady who lives in her own insulated world of tea parties and Victorian Era innocence.  Pretending to be musicians, the crooks use both her and her establishment as convenient blinds for their nefarious activities.  The great fun of the film lies in watching the bad guys get their richly deserved comeuppance in the end, while the sweet little old lady escapes unscathed and unharmed.

Now a new set of brothers - the Coen Brothers - have decided to take a whack at the same material, but their attempt at modernizing this priceless comic gem falls flat for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, the remake systematically violates the spirit and tone of the original.  The genius in the '50's film derived from the juxtaposition between the evil motives of the criminals and the utter innocence of the sweet and befuddled old lady.  In this new version, which has been awkwardly transplanted from cool, foggy London to steaming Mississippi,  the old woman has been conceived as a far more mouthy, far more worldly individual, thereby undercutting the original's comic tension right off the bat.  It also doesn't help that the overall tone - as befits the current times - is far more crude, crass and vulgar, whereas it was the extreme gentility of the lady's insulated world that made the original comedy work so well.

Tom Hanks has taken over the role, originally filled by the inimitable Alec Guinness, of the group's leader and mastermind, here called Professor G. H. Dorr.  Hanks portrays him as a silver-tongued, poetry-spouting, white-suited gentleman (think a young Colonel Sanders), an anachronistic throwback to the days of the pre-bellum genteel South.  In fact, there is more of a comic contrast between Dorr and the men he is working with than there is between the crooks and their hostess.  Yet, it is a comic tension that pays off less well than the original.  The characters all too often turn into caricatures, and the comedy is frequently broader and less subtle in tone than it needs to be. Another problem is that, in the original version, the men actually use Mrs. Wilberforce to innocently tote their ill-gotten gains for them.  This clever little way of implicating the little old lady in the crime has been inexplicably dropped from this version.

Having said all that, however, I must admit that there are some genuinely amusing moments in the film, particularly in the second half, and the material itself is so ingenious and sturdy that it would be hard for any filmmakers - let alone those of the caliber of the Coen Brothers - to fail utterly in the endeavor.  Hanks gives a clever, winning performance as Dorr, despite the fact that filling Guinness' shoes is a tall order for any actor, no matter how talented and skillful.  Irma P. Hall  does a nice job as Mrs. Munson, even if her performance lacks the subtle shading of Katie Johnson's original.

If ""The Ladykillers"" weren't toiling in the shadow of its great predecessor, it might seem like a clever, offbeat little comedy, and perhaps that's the way it does appear to those unfamiliar with the original.

It is almost a commercialized Chaplinesque dark comedy comparable to Monsieur Verdoux. The use of death as comedy works in this instance better than in Chaplin's film. What helps it is the elements of mainstream comedy and stereotypes.

Each of the characters have their own stereotypes. There is the dumb jock, the ghetto black guy, the adept Asian, the bumbling professor, the Christian old woman, and the strange animal trainer. The use of these bring the film into a mainstream area and also make the film appealing to a wider audience. However, the stereotypes could offend and detract from the film's integrity because it took the easy way out in getting a laugh.",1111968000,,874,4.931972789115647

2070263,5,B00029LNZA,"Hollywood overall these days seems to have a real problem coming up with original ideas for new movies.  Just look at all of the remakes being done, usually much worse than the originals.  That the Coen brothers, known for their quirky humor and characters, would think of remaking an old and wonderful British comedy, is surprising indeed.  And looking at other reviews and at the box office of Ladykillers, it seems that many people had their doubts they could pull it off.

The presence of Tom Hanks in the lead role also seems to have puzzled many people.  The refined and larcenous Professor Dorr hardly seems like his kind of character.  And the supporting cast, although recognizable to many, are hardly of the same reputation.  And the plot seems to make less sense than usual for a Coen movie.  Yet it works.  Maybe not for everyone, but for people who love the bizarre story and characterizations of these filmmakers, it works.  Especially if one just sits back and lets the the story roll over them.

It's an old story, for sure:  A team of thieves plans to tunnel into a cash room for a casino from the cellar of a nearby home.  In this case the home belongs to Marva Munson, played by Irma P. Hall.  She is delightful as the Bible-thumping, husband-worshiping widow with a room to rent.  The glib tongue of Professor Dorr doesn't quite overwhelm her good church sense.  Yet, she is one of the luckiest of women, from beginning to end.

Coen brothers fans may find this too different from their usual fare, but it's worth taking a chance.  Hanks is wonderful in larceny.  And, although some of the other characters seem cliched, they are taken from an original -- one of the reasons for the cliches -- and given a bit more modern lack of sensibilities.",1111190400,4,1764,4.614147909967846

2070268,3,B00029LNZA,"There was a time when Tom Hanks was not just an everyman (or an everyman playing a coulda-been-every-man-if-he-just-hadn't-been-faced-with-this-crippling/terminal-problem). There was a time when Hanks was exceptional. The last time we saw that Tom Hanks was in the epic Joe Vs the Volcano.

We also saw ""that"" Meg Ryan for the last time in the same movie--but that, my friends, is an issue for another day.

In The Ladykillers we have the resurfacing of the exceptional Tom Hanks; the Hanks willing to stake it all on a risky performance. I, for one, am damn glad to see it.

The story is so-so. This is no Joe Vs the Volcano if you ask me. However, it has its own charms. This is Comic Noir at its almost-finest (the Coens did it far better in Fargo, and came close to perfecting it in The Man Who Wasn't There).

I think both Hanks and the Coens may well have been constrained by the ghosts of the movie they were remaking. Whether one is working with or running from a pre-set pattern, it  necessarily limits one's choices. Still: this is a movie worth seeing.

The ending is the strength of this movie. The Coens have a penchant for morality tales. This one's a doosy.

Irma P. Hall and Hanks are the other two reasons to see this movie. Their increasingly akward interactions drive the story and the humor. Both give if not priceless, then certainly memorable, performances.

On a scale of one to ten, The Ladykillers is a very interesting and watchable seven. Coen fans will love it. Being one myself, I give this movie a solid recommendation.",1107129600,2,1549,4.648351648351649

2070272,2,B00029LNZA,"This pains me to write because I am such a Coen brothers fan (see many other reviews).  I guess I will never understand why someone would remake a movie that is near perfect to begin with.  Yes, the original Ealing studio gem is old (1950's), but that is part of its charm, much of the humor arising from that particular time and place in Britain.  And yes, the Coens have updated and changed the story, also changing the setting to the South, and altered many characters and plot details.  So, the Coen's movie is quite different not only in setting and characters but in tone.  But is it a better movie?  Not by a long mile, so why bother?  It only serves to take away the audience that might seek out and find the original.

Will we need a re-make of Fargo?  Or Barton Fink?  Or O' Brother Where Art Thou?  I don't think so.  When it's done right the first time, leave it alone.

Despite how quite different the movies are in their details some comparisons are inevitable.  The Alec Guinness classic is quiet, wry and droll, moves very quickly, and has subtlety and taste. Even the violent ends the criminals visit upon one another in their bungled attempts to deal with ""Mrs. Lopsided"" is presented with humor and taste.  Alas, the Coen's movie is crass, loud, gross and crude.  And, while the violence is muted here as well, it is still more graphic than necessary.

Likewise, a great deal of the humor in the first film derived from these inept petty crooks completely unequipped to deal with a sweetly oblivious, tiny, elderly Englishwoman of the Victorian age.  The updated character of the black church-going landlady is a neat departure from the original, but she is hardly sweetly oblivious nor a woman of another era.  For me, Mrs. Wilberforce was not just an old woman, but a woman with the quaint and simple values of the old British empire era completely undoing a pack of post-WWII English ""wiseguys"".  They are at a total loss as to how to deal with her. Not only that, but the actress playing Mrs. Wilberforce was tiny and delicate.  The modern woman is a force to be reckoned with and you believe could knock any one of Tom Hank's band cold if she took the notion. Much of the wry humor is thereby sacrificed.

The good things about the Coens movie are the changes made, in that they have made a very different film, and the performance of Tom Hanks.  His ""professor"" is quite different from Alec Guinness and it is a richly humorous characterization.  He has some nice scenes, well done.  I did not care for the supporting band of crooks, however, finding the crudeness in language and behavior disconcerting rather than humorous.  Whereas that type of humor has worked so well in Coen favorites of mine like The Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona, etc. I found it off-putting here.  Perhaps because I could not get the wit and subtlety, the pure cleverness, of the original out of my mind.

So, I stick with the original and find nothing in this version to recommend other than Tom Hank's performance.  For me, a misfire and a poor choice for a re-make.  In the future, maybe such talented people would do better to re-make a movie with a good central premise that was botched, rather than a movie that has been a perfect comedy gem to movie-lovers for decades.",1106265600,8,3277,4.571183533447685

Now this is not going to go down as one of the Coen brothers landmark achievements, but it's not ""Barton Fink"" either.  The brothers seem to be coasting here.  We've got the impeccable down-home Southern ambience with Roger Deakins' gorgeously lit cinematography.  T-Bone Burnett contributes his usual well-chosen gospel and roots music for the soundtrack.  Tom Hanks adds another amusing character to his repertoire in the person of Professor Doerr, the larcenous verbose classicist.  Irma P. Hall does an amusing turn as the no-nonsense church-going Mrs. Munson.  One of the more amusing running gags in the film is Mrs. Munson's devotion to Bob Jones University.  For those who've never heard of this institution it is a Christian institution that at one time prohibited race-mixing on it's campus.  Hanks has an amusing band of co-horts in Marlon Wayans, J.K.

In spite of the negative reviews herein, I took the chance on this film wondering how it could possibly go awry... and sadly it does BIG TIME!  This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen Tom Hanks in and for the Coen brothers to allow this tragedy to happen is beyond words.  The Tom Hanks character would have been far better (and as a result the whole movie much easier to watch), if Hanks' learned, PhD, professor portrayal had been a TOTAL FARCE and displayed to ONLY the landlady.  At all other times in the film, Hanks should have portrayed a mis-fit character just like everyone else.  Geez guys, I'm a rank amateur story-teller and I saw that one a country mile away.

Having said all that, once you learn to ignore Tom Hanks' character in this film, the remainder is classic Coen brothers.  Every one of the other characters is PERFECTLY cast and written... and Marlon Wayans!  BRILLIANT!  In spite of this, the secondary characters are not quite enough to carry the entire film on their own shoulders;  the Hanks master-mind character was essential in the film, but badly done.  The plot and writing of the overall film is hilarious, the physical comedy well done and the background characters are vivid and totally believable just like every other Coen film.

There are many laughs throughout the movie; however, one could argue that it is mostly cheap humor, e.g. having a character that suffers from IBS.  Mrs. Munson (Irma P.

Because of its proximity to the casino, they must begin their dig in the root cellar of an elderly lady who is a devout Christian and regular contributor to Bob Jones University.

As with most Coen films, the complexity lies in its eclectic characters.  A nearly unrecognizable Hanks appears to be dressed as an off-duty Confederate Officer and speaks with the vocabulary and knowledge of literature that will remind many of another Coen creation, the George Clooney character from ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou"".  Hanks delivers long, confusing Shakespeare-like speeches overly decorated with flowery language and unorthodox sentence structure, causing many in the audience to only catch the gist of what he says at times.

His band of rogues contains cartoonish and often-times stereotypical caricatures.  After placing an ad for help, Hanks finds a bowel-irritated explosives man, a fowl mouth brothah from the ""southside"" of the bayou, a Ho Chi Mihn loyalist who specializes in tunneling, and a dumb brutish ex-jock.

The Coen Brothers have a good time playing with the setting in this film, as they create an alternative reality formed by crashing together two popular settings.  Much of the film takes place in the bucolic, sleepy southern plantation world, where people drink lemonade at picnics, read poetry and fan themselves in sweltering churches.  But with the nearby city and Casino, a hip hop world is added to the film.  It's as if ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Boyz in the Hood"" were put into a blender and out came the alternative reality found in ""Ladykillers"".

Tom Hanks is great, the cast is great, the filmmaking is excellent...it's just not that funny.  Or as funny as it should have been.

It almost felt like two completely different movies for the first part: the witty, obscenity-free scenes between Hanks and his new landlady, and then the BOOTY CALL-type profanity of Marlon Wayans' scenes.  It gave the film a wildly uneven tone, like mixing Black Southern Gospel music (after O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?, it's obvious the Coens love Black Gospel music) and the ""hippity-hop"" music.

I can see where the language would turn off exactly the type of people who would want to see a movie like this.  Basically, the grown-ups familiar with the original movie and younger folks weary of all the Hollywood gutter talk.  Sure, it can be funny, but we're so inundated with it in so many movies that it loses its meaning.

I think I was expecting a conventional comedy. The Coen Brothers however do not make conventional comedies.

From the first scene where Mrs Munson assails the sherrif about the playing of ""hippity hop"" so loudly that it upsets her dead husband, I knew this would be another ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"".

Tom Hanks as the ""Professor"" plots to rob the bank of a Mississippi casino boat and assembles a motley group of ""subject matter experts"" to tunnel from Mrs Munson basement to the vault.

They use the guise that they are Renaissance musicians who need a root cellar with good acoustics in which to practice.

Mrs. Munson a very proper and active churh going lady played with aploumb by Irma Hall catches them after the act, now they have to decide what to do and they decide to kill her to keep her from going to the sheriff. I'm not sure if the parts leading up to the robbery are funnier or all the sub-plots afterwards, but with this DVD you'll be pausing and backing up constantly to catch it all.

This is probably Tom Hanks best role since Forrest Gump as another reviewer pointed out, but the skill doesn't stop there.

J.K. Simmons ( J. Jonah Jameson - Spiderman ) has to be the best character actor in todays market. He plays Garth Pancake - Jack of all Trades and the groups demolition expert. The scene where he tells Gawain (Wayons) how he met Mountain Girl at an I.B.S. support group was ""moving"" experience. I moved. I fell off the couch laughing and hit my head on the coffee table.

2070294,2,B00029LNZA,"This has its funny moments, and the switch from East End London to a Southern middle-class black milieu is nice, but it doesn't touch the original (Guiness, Sellers, Lom... how do you beat that lineup?), and represents a low moment for the Coens.

  The original version was played straight, with the comedy coming out of the situation. Here, everybody (with the exception of Irma Hall) is hamming it up, either ludicrously (Wayans and Simmons) or with some effect (Hanks, who never screws up completely). It's as if they, and the Coens as well, didn't trust the material, which, after all, has been around longer than they have.

  So while I enjoyed the odd bit (I'm a sucker for obnoxious cats), the film as a whole ended up simply irking me, as yet another example of the useless remake, something I'd never have expected the Coens to stoop to. Their strength lies in their originality (who else could have made ""Blood Simple""? ""Fargo""? ""O Brother""?), and they should stick with that. Here's hoping they slam the next one straight into the stands.",1098921600,2,1051,4.779005524861878
2070295,3,B00029LNZA,"The Coen brother's previous cinematic adventures consist of brilliant stories such as Blood Simple (1984), Barton Fink (1991), and The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) to name a few.  However, when the Coen's directed this remake based on Alexander Mackendrick's original film Ladykillers from 1955 they fell far short from their previous accomplishments.  Ladykillers becomes an unconvincing attempt to recreate the comic masterpiece as the chemistry between characters suffers from an overburden of modern cinematic clich's.

The story begins with Professor G.H. Dorr (Tom Hanks) appearing at Marva Munson's (Irma P. Hall) doorstep asking to rent her available room.  Marva who is concerned with modern time music and the morally wrong messages in today's society is happy to rent her apartment to Professor Dorr as he seems to be a man of principles.  Professor Dorr's appearance is a well rehearsed fabrication as his true intention is to dig a tunnel to the nearby casino and steal the millions in the vault.

The supporting cast around Tom Hanks does not support the story as it becomes next to painful to watch Marlon Wayans swear like a rough gang banger as it obviously is out of context.  The chain-smoking General (Tzi Ma) repeatedly hides his cigarette in his mouth, which does not have the intended affect on the audience.  The Irritable Bowel Syndrome of Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons) becomes an irritation as it is as silly as making farting sounds in a college course classroom.  The sad part is that the actors are not given enough material to work with as same gags are used over and over again, and this is one of the biggest fall downs of the film.

The Coen Brothers will not be ousted out of the theaters as a result of Ladykillers as they will continue to fascinate audiences with their future films.  Despite the negative parts of Ladykillers the film has truly fantastic and imaginative cinematography that is extraordinarily appealing to they eye and the mind.  The best character used in the film is Marva's cat, which brings a refreshing wind to the cinematic experience.  This conveys that regardless of the quality of the film, the Coen's can truly allure the audience with visually intriguing stories as they will continue to mesmerize large audiences with each and every opportunity.",1098748800,,2309,4.997389033942559

All five in the ladykillers' gang are supposed to behave ridiculously and the only ""serious"" character is Irma Hall. But the distance is too large. Hanks's character was to give cohesion between her and the rest of the group, but his role is even more disgusting than the other four.

The plot is really interesting, and of course the location is wonderful. I enjoyed the way Prof. Dorr gets together the gang, the robbery and the assault and the way the gang is ""dissolving"". But the interpretation is not what it must be.

I was barely ten minutes into the movie when the trashy profanity started; inundated with uses of M-F'r, G-d-mn, N-gg-r, p---sy, and other assorted insults.  I suppose I could get by all that if the movie was interesting or worthwhile in any respect.  But this picture suffers from a terminal case of boredom, and aside from a few good opening moments, it's worthless.  I wanted to see this Cohen Brothers movie after the tremendous success of ""Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?"" but this rendering of The Ladykillers isn't just a waste of time and money, it's just really, really badly done poor taste.",1098144000,7,747,4.723076923076923

Infact, aside from Hanks' name being attached to the film, I doubt this movie would ever have seen the light of day. The glaring, awkward presence of Marlon Wayans' profane, wannabe gangsta character constantly takes away from any momentum and the 'Coenness' of the movie.  I don't know if they were trying to appeal to a broader audience, or if they felt that this character was really an asset to the film, but Wayans, among other flaws really stopped this movie from being all that it could be.  Don't get me wrong, I thought Marlon Wayans was hillariious in 'Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood', but that brand of comedy just does not mix well with a Coen treatment.  However, Hanks is absolutely hilarious and makes you wish the rest of the movie could have been as good as his performance.  As an aside, if you are a musician the extra feature on the luthier who made the instruments is really fascinating.  For Hanks' performance and the extra features, you might want to consider putting this on your NetFlix list, but I don't think this is worthy of ownership.",1098144000,,1180,4.59047619047619
2070305,4,B00029LNZA,"When you watch a Coen brother's film, you never know what to expect.  I have stated before that I normally go into these films not expecting anything.  Even if I have seen the preview, with the Coens you never know if they will keep you on the Hollywood path.  Luckily, they do not.  The Coens are notorious (or at least becoming notorious) for making films that seem mainstream, but after careful viewing you realize that they are not.  The Ladykillers is unlike any work they have done before.  I may be biased because I have not seen the original version with Sir Alec Guinness, but I thought this was a very well directed film.  The Coen's have not forgotten their roots and are a pair of directors that are not afraid to experiment with audiences.  I was a fan of Intolerable Cruelty and pretty much every single one of their films, so I can say that with the sincerest confidence.  This film was nothing short of spectacular.  The Coens crafted this film using big names, small names, ingenious shots, a powerful story, and most importantly hidden messages throughout.  This is no O' Brother, Where Art Thou?, but it does stand on its own two feet.

I have read reviews that complain about Hanks performance in this film, but to this reviewer it was flawless.  The character that he portrays is hysterical and defined.  I am impressed with Hanks ability to control this character and make us become interested in him.  The expressions alone on Hanks face during this film alone are worth the price of the rental or theater ticket.  His banter with Marva Munson (aka Irma P. Hall) is outstanding.  Never have I seen such a complete connection between these two characters.  I longed for more interactions between them just so that I could witness the Coen's cinematic genius in action.  Hanks couldn't have done it alone though.  Thanks to Irma Hall, he has the perfect person to counter his dastardly narratives.  She nearly steals the scenes from Hanks.  Thankfully, their banter is equally sided and enjoyable.  I can not be the only one that thinks this since Irma won top prizes at Cannes for her work in this film.  It was the characters in this film that gave us the juicy center to a very tasty pie known as The Ladykillers.  I have spoken about Hanks and Hall, but so much can be said about Wayans job and the rest of the crew.  They each had their own defined actions and personalities that it kept my attention throughout.  The great obsession about the Coens is that they take you in so many directions.  From the opening scene, you assume that you have the time frame figured out, but thanks to Wayans character you are never sure when this film takes place.  This film felt like a classic picture with modern day undertones.  I think that was the utmost purpose of the Coens when the decided to remake this film.  They didn't want to change it completely, but they wanted to just add onto it.  I don't want to go too deeply into this because of my lack of knowing about the original film, but just from watching this version, you get that feeling.

Secondly, I would like to add that coupled with the acting is some of the most beautiful cinematography to grace the silver screen.  It plays a dual role in this film by not only setting the stage for events to come, but also helps create the very dark theme.  The gargoyles, the barge, and even the police station seemed to be from a different world, giving the viewer a mythical feeling.  There were times that the Coens had been reading children's books when filming this movie.  There were several scenes that I felt came right from children's literature.  The barge and Hanks' character are just two of the instances.

I do not have much to complain about with this film.  I love the Coen brother's films and I will continue to pay my money each time they release something.  They are never similar and each time push the envelope of reality.  I especially loved in this film the battle between ""good"" and ""evil"".  One could easily argue that this film was nothing more than a creative way of showing a battle between God and the Devil.  There was so many spiritual references throughout the film that you couldn't help wonder if the Coens weren't trying to convert you midway through the film.  Ah, I enjoyed this film.  Everything from the classic picture on the wall (with changing faces), to the dimwitted burglars, to the beautiful gospel music, all the way to the over-the-top performances by Hanks and Hall, this film was nothing short of perfection.  The Coens continue to make quality films that do not speak to the mass audiences, and there is nothing wrong with that.  They have their own style and wit, which makes them one of the most creative directors in Hollywood!

2070309,4,B00029LNZA,"Joel and Ethan Coen wrote and also took credit for directing this remake of the 1955 classic with Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers. Tom Hanks (Road To Perdition) plays G.H.

2070310,3,B00029LNZA,"The Coen Brothers' string of hip, well-made movies hits a bump in the road with ""The Ladykillers"" which features a strong cast headed by Tom Hanks.

What goes wrong?  Well... most of the dialogue has the wonderful snappiness that characterizes many Coen Brother's screenplays, but there are times when genre's are crossed in ways likely to offend or bore anyone other than a hard-core middle of the roader.  What do I mean?

Well, Irma Hall gives an absolutely fanTAStic performance as Mrs. Marva Munson.  Miz Munson is the kind of southern lady who's primary social activities seem to revolve between going to church and carrying on conversations with the portrait of her long-dead husband. (The husband portrait provides a few chuckles as the painting is consulted in every scene set before the fireplace - which is often - and the expression on the painting changes to reflect whatever is going on).  Miz Munson is the kind of woman who listens to gospel music exclusively, and she has no patience for ""hippety-hop"" music, culture or language.  Marlon Wayans, so extremely good in other work (including ""serious"" work in ""Requiem for a Dream""), portrays a profane young black man with no apparent reason for being in the movie OTHER than to be in conflict with the other characters and get on Mrs. Munson's bad side.  His language here, side by side with a good southern Christian lady character, is worse than the language he used as a junkie in ""Requiem"".  If not for the language the film could have easily received a PG rating.

Hanks' character is Professor Dorr.... Ph. D., a well-educated and flowery speaking con-man who orchestrates an elaborate plan to tunnel into the vault of a nearby Casino.  The flowery language of Dorr is contrasted with the simple church-lady Mrs. Munson.  When he introduces himself and his name ends with ""Ph. D."" Mrs. Munson asks ""Like Elmer?"" thinking that Ph. D. was an alternative spelling for ""Fudd"".  These scenes produce a few smiles, as do the scenes where Mrs. Munson punctuates her disapproval for Marlon with her words and a few whacks of her hand or handbag.

Dear Joel and Ethan Coen - the language that Gawain uses may in fact be common street language, heard every day at bus stops and in locker rooms and college dormitories.  But does it HAVE to be in this movie?  Does it have to be juxtaposed with scenes of Mrs. Munson and the choir at her church?  It is said that there is a time and place for most things, and perhaps there are times and places for those long strings of profanities (I am thinking of ""Pulp Fiction"" or The Coen's Masterpiece ""Fargo"" as examples) - but I would argue that this movie is NOT the appropriate place.

2070323,3,B00029LNZA,"""The Ladykillers"" is such an oddball film, one can't help but like it. It's supposedly based on the 1955 British film of the same name, though I have not seen it. It's rumored to be a comedy, but the subject matter is eventually as macabre as an Edgar Allan Poe short story.

Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Cohen are said to have written and directed this Southern Gothic caper, though the glory days of ""Fargo"" and ""Miller's Crossing"" are but a distant dream. This does not mean ""The Ladykillers"" is a bad film, just dreary in a foggy, hungover way.

I laughed several times during ""The Ladykillers,"" but was secretly hoping for the comedic intensity of ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Raising Arizona."" Part of the problem is the characters are so despicable as to be repulsive. If I were to meet this ragtag group of criminal wannabes, I would immediately cross the street and walk the other way.

Tom Hanks plays Goldthwait Higgins Dorr, a Southern conman with the fashion sense of Colonel Sanders, the laugh of a snake and the articulation of an English professor from hell. Our dear Mr. Dorr concocts an ingenious caper where his crew of misfits tunnel into a casino on the Mississippi River. His colorful gang includes a Vietnamese tunnel expert (Tzi Ma), a jive talking janitor (Marlon Wayans), an absent-minded explosives tech (J.K. Simmons) and a dimwitted goon (Ryan Hurst). They must dig through the root cellar of the home of elderly widow Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall). These cartoonish characters are caricatures to the point of offense.

Viewers will find it difficult to take their eyes off Hanks, whose fiery performance is as refined as Tom Green's in ""Road Trip."" He's a hoot, no doubt, though I couldn't understand half of what he said. I enjoyed his impulsive recitations of Poe's poetry. Hanks gives us several clues as to the turbulent spirit of Mr. Dorr, conveying a quiet disrespect for religion and authority. Hanks' G. H. Dorr is never a believable figure, stepping from the yellowed pages of a forgotten 19th century stage comedy.

Hall has been mightily praised for her performance as the widowed Munson, a Bible-toting dynamo whose stride is as bowlegged as Gabby Hayes. Not for a moment do you believe she'll suffer at the hands of the cellar-dwelling gang. Her discussions with the intimidating portrait of her late husband are amusing, but it's a portrayal as broad as the rest of this wildly uneven movie.

The Hanks Gang is discovered by Ms. Munson, and they draw straws to see who will ""dispose"" of her in order to keep the crime a secret. To tell more would be to give away some surprising developments, including freak accidents, dark irony and fateful coincidences. Rest assured, nothing will shock or surprise you.

""The Ladykillers"" will hold your interest, though you may not entirely get the joke. This uneven journey from the Cohen brothers tastes like a cup of far too bitter tea.",1096588800,,2910,4.808
2070324,4,B00029LNZA,"This quirky project from the outrageously funny Coen Brothers will confuse you at first but leave you with a great appreciation for Southern stereotypes and Gospel music.

Tom Hanks stars in this film about an old-fashioned southern professor and his band of goons as they try to steal a stash of cash from a moored river barge. Hanks looks like a Mississippi gentleman complete with crisp white linen suit and a Colonel Sanders beard. In this role Hanks is absorbed in all the refinement and politeness of the South, capturing the accent with perfection. He rents a room from the religious and proper Irma P. Hall, who is incredible as the proud God-fearing woman that lends her root cellar to Hanks' ""renaissance"" band, despite being oblivious to what is really taking place. Marlon Wayans, Garth Pancake and Tzi Ma complete the peculiar criminal package and they all bumble their way into a hilarious farce about Southern rights and wrongs. With a background of great Gospel music that becomes its own character you will walk away from this movie kicking up your heels.

The Coen Brothers have remade this original 1955 film and they have done a superb job. While this movie isn't nearly as crazy as their other pictures it offers a very unique look at the South finding humor in all sorts of places. Everyone will want Irma P.

This is a remake of a 1950's English movie of same name.  The basic premise to both is a motely group of would be criminals plan to break into a vault by tunneling.  They begin their excavation from  a nearby house owned by an innocent old woman.  To gain access to her house they rent a room from her and get her to let them have their musical group practice there.  Of course at some point the plan goes dreadfully wrong.  The action has been moved to New Orleans and the charcters have become the usual group of Southerns - the bumbling, lazy, good old boy cops in particular.

Tom Hanks plays the lead criminal, an over educated, verbose con man.  His long winded dialogues are a delight.  His cohorts include a chainsmoking Asian tunneling expert, a hapless demotions man and his adoring girlfriend, a foul mouthed 'inside' man and the usual dumb muscleman.  Their landlady is a devoutly religious widow who believes their implausible cover story totally.

The supporting roles are little gems for the most part, making the viewer wonder how this person could possibly have come to be involved in this scheme.  The film is beautiful visually, long shots of the Delta country, and detailed interior shots draw the view into the action.

The biggest flaw in the film is the constant obscene language from the Marlon Wayans character, it would be possible to portray him as a young uneducated poor black loser without the continuous flow of filth.

The extras on the DVD include a short outtakes reel, a rather dry but interesting documentary on the making of the period instruments used in the film and two long scenes of the gospel choir.

My wife and I are normal hard working white collar people who love all sorts of movies.  I don't think we've ever missed a new release together on DVD.  My word speaks for those like us out there, please have trust in my comments.  Fargo was great...O brother was a little less than great....Ladykillers is not so great.  Mr. Wayans is funny at times but eventually you get sick of the abusive language.  Tom Hanks tries to overwhelm us with his brillance and falls short in this one, sorry Tom big fan but no on LK.  The characters were interesting if the movie was a short skit but two hours of the same babble from each character got tiring.  The story lacked pace and excitment.  Too slow and not enough action.  We got the metaphor of the whole movie but by the end it didn't satisfy.  I suggest you pass on this one even if you are a Tom Hanks or Coen fan.",1095811200,3,966,4.112299465240642
2070344,2,B00029LNZA,"Occasionally I buy a movie because it stars one of your favorite actors or actresses. Other times my purchase is based on who was the writer or director. Therefore, in my system of logic, ""The Ladykillers"" should be a killer movie because it has one of my favorite actors (Tom Hanks) teamed up with the writers and directors (the Cohen brothers) of  ""O' Brother,"" which is one of my favorite movies. Sadly, ""The Ladykillers"" butchered my opinion of both.

""The Ladykillers"" is a tedious reincarnation of several tired story lines. The movie's core in similar to an ""Oceans 11"" gone southern. Tom Hanks does his best to keep up the accent of a stereotypical Southern aristocrat while Marlon Wayans plays another stereotype; that of an excessively profane African-American lackey. Unfortunately the lackluster showing of the other cast members overshadows Irma P. Hall's superb performance.

As with ""O' Brother,"" the Cohen bothers are excellent at weaving music into this movie. The gospel songs in ""The Ladykillers"" make the sound track much more desirable than the movie itself.",1095638400,,1079,5.119318181818182
2070345,4,B00029LNZA,"The Coen's have definite signatures that appear in all their film, but their movies vary greatly as far as story-lines and themes. Thus there isn't a ""Coen Bros fan"" the same way there are 007 fans. One person I know loves ""Fargo"", his brother loves all their films *except* Fargo. I liked this one; think of this as an opinion piece from a semi-dedicated fan of the Coen brothers with minor spoilers, please note.

Yes, this film is disjointed. And if you don't like slapstick, don't watch it. Also there are tons of F-bombs in this movie, but, hey, I like ""Get Shorty"". Most of them are from Marlon Wayan's character and they fit well.

The gospel music soundtrack works incredibly well. It's definitely presented as the music of ""good people"" and placed in contrast with the hip-hop (Irma Hall's character, Marva, calls it hippety-hoppety) which is presented as the corruption that's in the world. Religion is presented as something that brings out what's best in people and greed is shown as bringing out the worst. Tom Hanks' character is a sort of ""insane villain"" (like Batman's Joker) who masquerades as an eccentric professor. Marva has a kind of protection from this evil that seems to be not so much due to her own wits or to luck a la Inspector Clouseau. Her protection is clearly of a divine nature as evidenced by clear indications that her dearly departed husband is watching over her as well as her clairvoyant cat (both of whom, it's hinted at, may be one and the same....)

The heist plan is so simple and yet the characters are so goofy that it's evident from the beginning that things are going to go wrong. The point of the movie is revealed in the interaction between what's good and sensible (Marva, her cat and the gospel choir) and what is evil and self-defeating (the ""Ladykillers"", the casino, the hip-hop gangsters, etc.).

The scene which proves this best is the discussion of what to do with the money. Professor Dorr goes into a long explanation of how they are going to gives part of the money to charity, insurance, the evils of a casino and how it's really justified, etc., etc., and after Marva is almost taken in by this she counters with her simple plan of 1) give it all back 2) go to church, otherwise she goes to the sheriff. This occasions their reluctant planning of her murder and the insanity which ensues.

The criticisms can abound among those who lose site of this theme and focus on the rapid turn of the movie from being lighthearted to dark and other supposed anomalies. Personally, I found the running joke about J.K. Simmons character's bowel distress to accurately describe people I know who suffer from this and go around telling everyone the details. You can ""poo-poo"" this as potty humor, but I was laughing so hard...sorry, maybe I'm immature. This is a comedy in the classic sense because it has a happy ending...well, if you're not rooting for the crooks....",1095552000,,2917,4.678362573099415
2070346,3,B00029LNZA,"In ""The Ladykillers"" Tom Hanks essays his most unusual and off-beat role yet. Looking all the world like the love child of Bugs Bunny and Colonel Saunders, Tom Hanks essays the star role in the American remake of ""The Ladykillers"". Hanks with prominent buckteeth, plays Professor Goldthwait Higgins Dorr, Ph. D. When widow Marva Munson (Irma Hall) decides to rent out a room of her home, Dorr arrives with bells on immediately ready to move into. Provided she has a basement that he and his ""band"" (Marlon Wayans, J.K. Simmons from ""Spiderman"", Ryan Hurst and Tzi Ma) can practice their inspirational religious tunes in. In reality, Dorr is a crafty criminal who hopes to tunnel through to a near by casino and break into their vault.

Slapstick humor abounds in ""The Ladykiller"" which gives it much more in common with other comedies they've made like ""Raising Arizona"" and ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" than the dry humor at the heart of ""Fargo"". ""The Ladykillers"" manages that rare feat of entertaining the audience, the Coens and critics all at the same time. While it isn't a perfect comedy, it's very funny and, not surprisingly, very quirky and well worth renting for casual fans and buying for hardcore fans. The Coen brothers continue their quest to become the next Preston Sturges with this interesting remake. ""The Ladykillers"" reminds me most of ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" both in terms of how successful the comedy is and the general feel of the film.

 If looks could kill, then the audience would be dead after watching this marvelous transfer A sharp looking transfer with a brilliant reproduction of cinematographer Roger Deakins crafty work, the detail throughout the film is crisp and colors vibrant. The soundtrack is awash with a number of gospel tunes and they are sonically vibrant here as well.

 An area where many of the Coen's movies could improve, we get a special featurette on Danny Ferrington who is really the man behind Dorr's band. There are also a number of cut music scenes featuring some terrific gospel numbers. The slap reel outtakes consisting almost entirely of one scene (where Hanks gets the stuffing knocked out of him by Hall) is a chuckle as well. Unfortunately, we don't get any other extras with the Coens discussing why they chose to remake ""The Ladykillers"". The Coens, like Spielberg, remain mum on the subject of their work. There's no commentary track involving the brothers, cast or producers. I'm sure Hanks would have been more than willing to contribute to this aspect of the DVD.

 A funny, light comedy from the Coens (if anything from them can be termed ""light"", ""The Ladykillers"" catches Hanks in fine form with a terrific and unusually stoic supporting cast. Although it isn't a great comedy, ""The Ladykillers"" has its moments and the performances help make the movie memorable. The Coens have become experts at dry, off-beat humor and ""The Ladykillers"" although it isn't quite up to the quality of ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", is pretty darn close. Somewhere Preston Sturges is smiling. Oh, while you're at it take a look at Sturges' classic film ""Sullivan's Travels"".",1095552000,,3123,4.925855513307985
2070347,3,B00029LNZA,"After originally seeing the movie trailer, I was pleasantly surprised to see Tom Hanks in more of an odd role than we're used to seeing him in. However, after about 15-20 minutes through the movie, it wasn't so pleasant...

Marlon Wayans destroyed the feeling of this movie. I realized this movie was rated R, but I didn't feel it was necessary for him to say f*** every 5th word, and some other type of profanity almost every other word. Maybe the creators of the film we trying to give us a distinct idea of what type of character Guwain was, but it was a little annoying.

Tom Hanks' good performance was kind of overlooked by f*** this and f*** that, and he really looked out of his normallity in this movie.

2070348,4,B00029LNZA,"The Coen Brothers, who brought us the wonderful and sublime ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" have turned in a pure delight in ""The Ladykillers.""  Set in the Deep South as was ""O Brother,"" Ladykillers is the side-splitting story of a motley gang of crooks led by the weird Professor G.H. Dorr, played brilliantly by Tom Hanks.  The crooks have such names as The General, Lump, Garth Pancake, and Mountain Girl.  The Professor is such a funny character, with such funny dress and mannerisms, that he becomes a classic movie character the minute he appears on screen.

Another classic movie character is the unflappable Irma P. Hall, played by the marvelous Marva Munson.  The professor seeks to trick her by posing as a professor of music with a traveling troupe.  He rents a room in her house, and sets up his criminal operation in her basement.  However, he did not count on Mrs. Hall being such an ""obstacle.""  What ensues is classic capers that had me and my husband busting our guts.

2070349,2,B00029LNZA,"For years, the Coen brothers have been trying to achieve mainstream acceptance. Their first real attempt was with The Hudsucker Proxy. Not even the presence of big-time Hollywood producer Joel Silver helped and the film was a critical and commercial flop. Over the years, the Coens have cast more recognizable names in their movies: Jeff Bridges, George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones in an attempt to garner larger audiences while still remaining true to their oddball cinematic visions. Their last two films, however, have seen them veering dangerously close to Hollywood sell-outs with the charming screwball comedy Intolerable Cruelty and their latest effort, a cartoonish remake of the classic Alec Guiness black comedy, The Ladykillers.

""The Gospel of The Ladykillers"" allows one to view the entire performances of ""Shine on Me"" and ""Trouble of This World"" by The Abbot Kinney Lighthouse Choir with Rose Stone and The Venice Four that were featured prominently in the movie.

The strongest extra is ""Danny Ferrington: The Man Behind the Band,"" an 11-minute featurette on the man who built the vintage musical instruments that Dorr and his crew pretend to play. Ferrington talks about his career and how he has built instruments for the likes of Johnny Cash, George Harrison and Pete Townsend.

""The Slap Reel"" is a tiresome outtake montage of Irma Hall slapping the crap out of poor Marlan Wayans. It wasn't that funny in the movie and it is even less so with this extra.

Stylistically, The Ladykillers looks and sounds as good as any other Coen brothers film-sadly, it doesn't have much else going on except for Tom Hanks' inspired performance. This may be due in large part to the fact that they weren't even supposed to direct The Ladykillers. This was originally a project intended for Barry Sonnenfeld to direct with the Coens only writing the screenplay. When he dropped out, the Coens took over and it shows. It feels like a half-hearted attempt with the Coens not fully committed. However, I wouldn't count the Coens down and out yet. There are reports that they are currently working on an original script and let's not forget that they rebounded from the failure of Proxy with the masterful Fargo.",1095292800,,2217,5.0
2070350,4,B00029LNZA,"That the Coen brothers would want to remake any movie, let alone the classic 1955 British comedy ""The Ladykillers,"" is surprising enough.  After all, when you think of ""Raising Arizona,"" ""Fargo,"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" you think about their flair for being original, so why would they indulge in a remake?  The answer might be that they got Tom Hanks with his pair of Oscars to step into the Alec Guinness role.  Guiness had the likes of Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom as his partners in crime while Hanks has to make due with Marlon Wayans and J.K. Simmons, which is as good of a way to capture the differences between now and then as anything.

Hanks plays Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, supposedly a professor of Latin and Greek, who dresses like Colonel Sanders and talks like a cultured silver-tongued devil.  The plot is similar to the original in that Dorr rents a room from a little old lady so that he and his partners can pretend to be holding music practice in the root cellar as a cover for tunneling their way to riches, which this time are to be found in the cash room of a river boat casino (fortunately the cash room is on dry land and not on the boat).  Dorr's partners in crime consist of Gawain MacSam (Wayans), a foul-mouthed hip-hop janitor who cleans the casino, Garth Pancake (Simmons), an explosives expert whose plans are always just a bit off; the General (Tzi Ma), apparently an expert tunneler who honed his skills in ""French Indo-China""; and Lump (Ryan Hurst), a big, strong football player who has taken way too many blows to the head.

But these guys do not stand a chance against Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall), the little old widow lady whose home is the base of operations for the gang and who has no compunction about slapping Gawain on the side of his head (her minister already explained from the pulpit that sometimes there is nothing else to do).  Marva goes to church regularly, still has conversations with the portrait of her dearly departed husband, and shows up regularly at the local police station to complain about her cat begin up a tree and other problems.  The gang has to get the money despite the idiosyncratic problems of each of its members, but then they have to get the money past the old lady, and that is just not going to happen (even though for some reason that passeth understanding Marva thinks that Bob Jones University is an appropriate place for a black woman to send a donation every month).

Ultimately what we have with this 2004 film is the story from the original Ealing comedy dressed up with the wacky characters we have come to expect from the Coen brothers, which is not a bad example of cinematic cross-breeding.  The nonsense of the proceedings is entertaining enough in its odd little way for anyone willing to accept that a remake that is not going to be able to surpass the original (some people cannot get past the idea of a treasured film being remade, and often they are right in their thinking).  Marva and Dorr are never boring and Hanks certainly lays on the eccentric affectations in his flowery speeches.  Hanks proves how good he is in this role when the situation forces him to declaim a poem by Poe, which he does quite charmingly.  I might refrain from hitting anybody on the side of the head after watching this movie, but I must confess to a sudden and intense desire to have waffles.

And best of all it's got Irma P. Hall, the churchy widow who looks to her venerable deceased husband's portrait (and his facial expression keeps changing to suit the situation) for moral guidance in how to deal with Hanks and his sidekicks, who are digging a tunnel in her root cellar.

But somehow, it all falls a bit short and begins to feel superfluous, esp as the body count rises toward the end, and I found myself only smiling instead of laughing aloud. I was pretty much over it before the final credits rolled.",1095033600,9,933,4.586826347305389
2070362,3,B00029LNZA,"Filmmaking brothers Ethan and Joel Coen seem to be in a creative slump. Their collective efforts reached a peak in 1997 when ""Fargo"" was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture. [It won two.] After that, they made three interesting movies [""The Big Lebowski"", ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", ""O, Brother, Where Art Thou?""]. These efforts were well received. No one expected another ""Fargo"", after all. Then came 2003's dismal flop, ""Intolerable Cruelty"". It proved that the Coen brothers could make a - gasp! - bad movie. ""The Ladykillers"" marginally restores their reputation. It has its moments to be sure. It's entertaining overall but is short of memorable.

Movies are more prone than other art forms to failure. A novelist, composer or painter can abort or destroy any work he or she deems less than worthy. The only thing lost is time. A movie is not only a collective effort involving dozens, if not thousands, of collaborators, it is also financed to the tune of millions of dollars. Once the decision is made to make a film, it's hard to go back. This may explain why even a Hitchcock or a Scorsese can sometimes fail dismally - as opposed to a Beethoven or a Hemingway. A film director is but one of many components.

In ""The Ladykillers"", loosely based on a classic 1950s British comedy, a master con man [played in fine form by Tom Hanks] entices a law-abiding Christian lady [played in even finer form by Irma P. Hall] into renting him a room in her fine old Mississippi home. He convinces her to allow him to use her vast root cellar as a rehearsal area for his band of classical musicians. In truth, this gang is using her house as a base to tunnel into a nearby riverboat casino's cash room. What ensues if a broad comedy which sometimes works.

In ""The Ladykillers"", the Coens, masters of Americana, revisit the Deep South. Essentially, they miss the mark, but, oh, how they try!",1094947200,3,1904,4.6946107784431135

This remake of the 1955 original is without a doubt one of the cleverest comedies out there. The movie is not a laugh out loud fall out of your seat kind of thing, but there are some moments that may have you howling. What really makes the movie hilarious is the irony, the movie is filled to the brim with irony. If you haven't seen it then I can't really talk about it too much because it will spoil all the fun. The other funny aspect of the film lays within the almost cartoonish characters. Imagine the most awkward people and throw them in a root cellar and there you have the ensemble cast of The Ladykillers. My favorite character would have to be the Chinese General, absolutely hilarious. Each character also has one aspect within their personality that makes the second part of the movie all the more ironic and funny. Professor Dorr loves the poetry of Edger Allen Poe, Lump has his stupidity, the General has his smoking, Garth Pancake has IBS (Irritable Bowl Syndrome), and Gawain has his ""hippity - hop"" gangsta attitude. Just make note of these characters and their signatures when watching the movie, if you've seen it then you know what I'm talking about. The last bit of irony is also quite funny, just make a note of where they all end up going. The reason why the movie works is because of these little quirks that characters posess and did I mention the irony of it all. Great movie, but still, we've seen better from the Coen brothers.

AUDIO: The music of this movie (and all Coen brothers movies) is fantastic. The sound while not the best is pretty decent. I think the music was much louder than the voice levels at some points.

VIDEO: It falls a little short in this department. Disney delivers another mediocre 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. While the colors were very vibrant, the picture was not all that sharp at times.

PACKAGING / EXTRAS: Standard case with an insert listing the chapters on the front and advertising The Alamo on the back. We basically get a barebones release here folks. I was pretty dissapointed. The only things are full length videos of the two gospel scenes in the movie, a look behind the construction of the instruments in the movie (not relevent at all to the movie itself but nonetheless very interesting), a Slap Reel (Outtakes), and a readable screenplay for your DVD-ROM. There are also some trailers for other Disney movies, but no trailer for the movie itself. Overall dissapointing, there is nothing on the making of the actual film.

Based loosely (very) on the Alec Guinness classic, this seems yet another outlet for the Coens to parody the South.  The plot is known: a fancy speaking Professor of the Ancient Languages (Tom Hanks) gathers miscreants from a small town in the South to rob the quasi-legal money from a gambling boat on the Mississippi. The staging facility is a room rented from a heady gospel-infatuated yet strong willed lady (Irma P. Hall) and from the basement of her house the ""Late Renaissance Music Ensemble"" band of thieves works their heist. Of course it ultimately fails and evil is punished.  But it is the in-between that is supposed to be funny. The actors in the band (Marlon Waynans, JK Simmons, Tzi Ma, Ryan Hurst) try to make the best of a flimsy script, but in the end it is the tour de force work of the stuffy, pompous, fancy talking  Hanks and the no-nonsense Hall that save what there is to save from this bit of treacle.  The constant deaths, the grotesqueries, the non-stop toilet language all have to be tolerated to make it through.

It is about high art and low art and high society and low society and how all those elements mingled together are hard to tell apart, none really turning out to be above or below the other.

Of course, it's more than that, and less: it's a damn funny movie.  By and large, reviewers found it minor and derivative, but what of the Coen brother's works aren't? I don't think I've seen a film of theirs that doesn't technically handle something I've seen before in a brand new way that catches my attention; in this one, the football field scene stood out-great fun to watch.

In this long, meandering take on the Crime Caper genre, Hanks plays a strange con-man out to pilfer a large sum of cash from a vintage sternwheel casino boat.  He hires a bizarre group of cronies by putting ads in the local newspaper!  They proceed to use an elderly churchgoing black woman's home as their base of operations.  Said woman has no idea these 'musicians' are digging a tunnel from her basement to the cash room of the casino.

The film does have a lot of potential, but most of it is lost in long stretches of wordy dialogue - most of it by Hank's character.  This has the effect of diluting whatever comic impact the particular scene may possess.  Things take so long to develop that one finds their eyelids getting droopy (I had time to wash dishes and do other housework without pausing the DVD, and didn't miss anything of significance).

Black humor indeed. But Jewish humor as you can't even imagine. The humor of influencing people with effete verbosity, with elaborate totally unbelievable lies that are all the more believable because they are unbelievable.

Jewish too their humor because it is shown from the only point of view of the leader who sees every event as a new difficulty and he is so relieved when finally his last accomplice falls into the trash boat after this last accomplice of his has killed himself convinced as he was that the gun was empty. It is so good when it stops, when the raven flying out of Edgar Allen Poe crosses the sky over his head and he jubilates then because he misinterpret the omen: the beginning of his own end whereas he thought it was the beginning of the end of it all, except of course himself. And he was rich. The punch line for him is a real punch line falling from the sky, hard and stony, deadly and fatal. And what his that poor black woman going to do with 1.6 million dollars? Even the sheriff tells her what the effete PhD had told her: no one cares because the insurance is going to pay anyway. So what is she going to do with all that money? And that is the last straw that breaks the camel's back, the drop of water falling into the sea that causes a tsunami, a tidal wave of the old times. It makes the whole film a farce of divine, celestial and even cosmic dimension. Stealing is covered by insurance contracts and the victims are just nearly congratulated with insurance money that looks like some kind of a reward for them having been robbed. So go on robbing the rich and businesspeople that deal with too much money. Anyway we pay we have paid, through our own insurance premiums what they will be compensated with. So at least let us get what we are paying for, once in a while. Very black Jewish humor. If it did not exist we would have to invent it.  Thank you so much, Coen Brothers.

Perhaps you don't appreciate the great and funny performances especially by Marlon Wayans and Tom Hanks.  Perhaps you don't realize that a great actor like Tom Hanks may want to stretch and play different characters.  Perhaps you know nothing about movies!
But then again, I'm glad you hated it, because if everyone loved the Coen Brothers as I do, and if they were rich moguls whose every movie was a huge mega-hit, perhaps they wouldn't continue to turn out quirky gems such as this, and perhaps I'd be the miserable one, instead of all you jamokes complaining about a funny and rare film such as this.",1089417600,8,757,4.8

Despite some funny moments at parts, this movie is too uneven, predictable and flawed to truly recommend. Ok, so Tom Hanks and Irma P. Hall are good on their roles, there are a couple of black humour scenes with neat dialogue and the directing is competent, yet the overall result is still forgettable and a bit disposable. Not really a bad flick, but not a particularly convincing one either. Good to watch once as it presents some entertainment value, even if the Coen brothers have done much better in the past.

2070385,4,B00029LNZA,"Here we are, then - a new Coen Brother movie. That's always a cause for celebration - and this time they did it astoundingly quickly. I just saw Ladykillers, and frankly I'm slightly taken back by the bad reviews it got. Now, the way I see it, the film falls in a grey area - it's far too commercial and mainstream for the Coens' fans, and too much of an oddball movie for those looking for a mainstream comedy. Certainly, this isn't the Coens at their best - there's no use comparing Ladykillers to masterpieces like Barton Fink, Big Lebowski, Fargo, Miller's Crossing, Hudsucker Proxy and O Brother, Where Art Thou? or even to lesser Coen projects like The Man Who Wasn't There, Intolerable Cruelty and Raising Arizona. In hindsight, Ladykillers probably is the duo's weakest offering to date. But even when the Coens are at their very worst, they're still the best around.
Even when dealing with a weak storyline and one-dimensional characters - and for the first time in their career, the story isn't one of their own - their brilliant, one-of-a-kind scriptwriting and directing make up for it. Nobody writes - or directs - a dialogue like Joel and Ethan. And even though they weren't able to arouse sympathy for any of the characters - not even the charming old woman - they still created some unique, memorable, hilarious characters in the best Coen tradition. Tzi Ma (The Quiet American), Marlon Wayans (Requiem For A Dream), Ryan Hurst (Remember The Titans) and J. K. Simmons (Spider-Man) are each uniquely terrific as the band of robbers, and Irma P. Hall is wonderful and hilarious as a classic god-fearing Big Mama. The show-stopper is Mr. Tom Hanks who, as Professor G. H. Dorr, grants one of his most memorable performances. Tom Hanks' characters usually have a Tom Hanks attitude about them; for this role his disconnected from that, and truly I haven't enjoyed him this much since Forrest Gump. The Coens also do as gorgeous a job with recurring motives as they usually do - in this case, a cat, a hideous statue, and a portrait that seems to change a bit whenever you look at it. The surreal, oddball atmosphere of a Coen Brothers classic is still there - more so, I would say, than in Intolerable Cruelty and even The Man Who Wasn't There. The feeling and the style are there; unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, the film suffers from a weak plot, which only become hilariously funny in the last half hour.
So you're more than welcome to follow the dozens of one and two star reviews on this page, if you like; I still think Ladykillers is well worth watching for Coen fans - AS LONG AS YOU REMAIN OBJECTIVE AND IGNORE THE COEN NAME ON IT! (Yeah, that's a tricky one, I know.) If you like the Coens' oddball humor and surrealism, just keep that `oh, whatever happened to them?' thought out of your head and enjoy the movie. And I'm quite sure you'll enjoy it.",1087084800,3,2879,4.625
2070386,4,B00029LNZA,"In the annuls of cinema, Character is king. Many can come up with a winning high concept idea but unless you fill it with a rich tapestry of Characters you've wasted time. For the greatest plot idea can become mundane if you've put the wrong character in the wrong place. Joel and Ethan Coen's THE LADYKILLERS is a mundane story that is saved by top notch and very rich performances.
Mrs. Munson (Irma P. Hall, Soul Food) is a simple woman. She lives at home alone, she goes to church every Sunday, and she prays for the souls of those young kids listening to that ""Hippity Hoppity"" music. So when she rents a room to Professor Dorr P.H.D (Tom Hanks, Philadelphia) little does she know that her annual contribution to Bob Jones University will never be the same.
Dorr turns out to be a criminal mastermind, trying to pull off a simple casino robbery. He's acquired a crack team of losers and creeps to pull it off: Gaiwan (Marlon Wayans, Dungeons and Dragons) The Inside Man, Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons, The First Wives Club) The Munitions Expert, The General (Tzi Ma, The Quiet American) the tactical man, and Lump (Ryan Hurst, Patch Adams) is the muscle. Will they pull off their brilliant plan? Only time and the two-hour running time will tell.
What the Coen's have crafted here is an acquired taste. The comedy is a little bit esoteric. The story plods along with almost reckless abandon, and they use swear words like their trying to buy a Ferrari with their swear jar. But something else is going on under the surface, a great character drama is unfolding.
Hank's overplays Dorr, but only to hide the fact that he might not be nearly as smart as he might claims. It's so subtle, and yet so garish I could see many thinking the performance is too over the top. But Hanks plays it so smartly and charming, you can't help but be enveloped into its complex layers.
I also liked how the Coen's screenplay polarizes it characters by playing the actors against each other. Dorr and Munson relationship works because it's the classic battle between brains and innocence. You may be able to quote Edgar Allen Poe, but if you can't do the right thing maybe you should get a real job.
The other great struggle is between Gaiwan and Garth. Gaiwan is a young black male with no conscience. Garth is a liberal white guy trying to knock sense into this stupid kid. Their escalating story builds from an almost a playful game of Older Vs Younger, but then raises the bar as it escalates into violence.
The Coen's have always had limited appeal because their films are dependent on audience involvement. You have to care for the characters; you have to put yourself in the characters place. Those who don't will leave the theater going that was weird, that was stupid, and that didn't make any sense. But that's why I like their films so much.
THE LADYKILLERS is worth the price of admission if you're interested in a silly and subtle character
drama but fails in plot. But boy it's a lot of fun, and if you give it a chance you might just walk away without that look of confusion you had on your face after THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.

A remake, therefore, has to do something to help the story march with the times, if it is to be a profitable product in a shabby age. This film, however - the second Coen Bros turkey in a row - exhibits some of the worst qualities of the cinematic art in our time: a self-referential irony that constantly rips the narrative fabric to shreds; overdrawn characters who are more like cartoons than like people; a smug and self-congratulatory visual slickness; and a relentless tendency to suppose that tiresome repetition of the ""f"" word represents something like humor, when it just doesn't fit into this tale at all.

I savor every quirky moment of The Big Lebowski, I believe Fargo is one of the best movies ever made, and I think that Barton Fink and Miller's Crossing are classics waiting to be discovered. So why did I dislike The Ladykillers so much? I honestly don't think it was a case of being let down; even a lesser Coen entry (Blood Simple) has its interesting, entrancing qualities. So why is this movie so lame? It sure as hell starts off promising: Tom Hanks, as Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, spews off Coen-esque words with innate skill and Irma P. Hall is hilarious as Mrs. Munson, the old lady who lets Dorr board in her home. They have a curious little chemistry, Dorr and Munson, and their scenes of dialogue elevate the movie. And then the real plot sets in, with supporting character after supporting character. And to boot, some of them don't even fit into the movie at all - Marlon Wayans is especially ill-fitting as a foul-mouthed casino-boat worker who seems to have no other purpose but give the movie an R-rating. But wait! Let's throw in some jokes about Irritable Bowel Syndrome, more cultural stereotypes, and a third act that drags on and on and on and what comes out is simply the worst Coen film I've seen. This movie could have been so much better, and in fact, it's not horrible. There's geniune comedy in it, but too often it's shrouded by the overly-confident directors urging us that we should be laughing our asses off at things that aren't that funny (black churches are hilarious! dumping multiple people into the river is funny even after the 5th time!). If only they'd deployed the subtlety and atmosphere that makes nearly all of their movies great. I wanted so much to like this movie, but when you're done with it after an hour, it's impossible.

2070409,4,B00029LNZA,"We just watched this one over the weekend, and were puzzled about why a Tom Hanks comedy would have an ""R"" rating.  I mean, how bad could it be?  We decided to take our chances and brought the kids along with us -- and regretted that decision by about the second scene.  It has been quite some time since I have seen a movie that made such heavy use of profanity -- and almost all of it the heavy-hitting four-letter words.  There were also some gratuitous references to the female anatomy which are not at all suitable for mixed company.  Aside from this, the movie was extremely funny and entertaining, and might have rated five stars.

You're probably wondering what I found to be so great about it, since several previous reviewers absolutely hated it.  I guess I would offer a caveat -- there's no accounting for taste, whether for or against.  I don't fault the opinions of those who were turned off by it.  ""To each his own.""

The story is set in a small, sleepy town on the banks of the Mississippi, where resides an old widow-lady named Ms. Munsford (or Munsen, or something like that).  She lives in her own quiet little world, talking to her cat Pickles and a portrait of her dead hubby Othar, going to church regularly, and dreaming of someday becoming a major financial benefactor of Bob Jones University.  One day on her doorstep appears the inimitable Professor Goldthwait Higgins Dorr (Tom Hanks), who rents a spare room while on sabbatical (so he says) ""to pursue my passion, a study of the music of the early Renaissance period.""  Dorr requests and obtains permission to use the widow's root cellar for his ""ensemble"" to practice their music.

Tom Hanks is masterful in the role of professor Dorr, an eccentric middle-aged gentleman of keen wit and erudite tongue.  He loves to recite poetry and read the classics, and has a particular bent toward the works of ""Edg'Allen Poe"" (as he would say in his polite Mississippi accent).  It is not long at all, however, before the scholarly squire and his true intentions are revealed.

Dorr's ""ensemble"" turns out to be a mishmash assortment of criminals, colorful characters all, including a former Viet Cong general, a young and impudent gangsta, a sentimental explosives expert plagued by irritable bowel syndrome, and a doltish ""ox"" whose only value is as a strong back.  The common goal of these rogues is to tunnel from the cellar out to an underground riverside vault that holds the money for a nearby casino boat.  They will enter the seemingly impregnable vault from its unguarded side using their gangsta (who is a custodian at the casino) as their inside man.  After they cover their tracks it will look like the money simply vanished into thin air.

The con-men pull off their task admirably and seemingly without a hitch.  It is only after the job is done (but before they can make good their getaway) that irony, fate and indeed, the hand of God himself, intervene to stymie their plans.  And through it all, the innocent old widow lady plays a key but unsuspecting role in their downfall.  The final ""denouement"" (to choose a term befitting professor Dorr) is played out with side-splitting comedy and irony, and wraps up in a neat little package that is the epitome of ""poetic"" justice (pun intended -- just watch what happens with the professor at the end and you'll understand what I mean).

I won't include any details about how things wrap up, other than to say that each of the conspirators, as well as the widow, get exactly what they deserve -- justice is meted out to each for good or ill.  This movie is an absolute riot from beginning to end, notwithstanding the fact that nearly all of the characters cuss a blue streak throughout the film (professor Dorr and the widow excepted).  Definitely watch this one -- but get a babysitter!",1083628800,8,3820,4.68815592203898

I was biased against this movie b/c I think the Coen brothers overindulge in swearing, body humor and all things crude (though they are undeniably intelligent).  Also, Hanks' character - from what I saw in the previews - slightly grated on my nerves, especially when he laughed.
That said, we went to see it last night.  I was surprised at how it kept my attention and at how much I laughed out loud.  Though there was the usual abundance of swearing, the Coen's seemed to have reduced their usual crudeness for this film.
Additionally, the Coens allowed for an unmistable sense of providence.  The old lady, a staunch believer in God and in Bob Jones University, is inexplicably protected from all evil.  However, there is more a sense that it is her dead husband who is looking over the situation rather than any divine presence.
Yes, the end was predictable.  Yes, the characters were all one-dimensional (they may not have been exactlu stereotypical, but they were all one-dimensional).  Yes, there is little in this movie to think about or talk about after it is over.

2070411,3,B00029LNZA,"I did have high expectations for this movie.  Tom Hanks could pull off some great characters, so I was expecting a lot.
In the beginning, the movie had some great visual eye candy that I thought was really good like the close ups of the statues on the bridge watching the garbage island and the keys to the jail cell in the police station covered with spider webs.  I found the first 15 minutes of the movie funny with the interaction with the old lady and the police, and then her interaction with Tom Hank's character.
Then the movie went downhill from there.  For one thing, there was no reason for all of the use of the F word in the movie.  If they removed most of the cursing from the script, this movie could have been rated PG-13 instead of R and not have lost any of it's goodness.  It would have gotten better.  The majority of the movie seemed to go very slow too.  I went to see the movie with my dad, and he slept (and snored) though most of the movie, so that must mean it went slow if it was a snoozer for some people.

And even after all that, I still think that Ladykillers is the most well-thought out comedy in a long time. The factor that I most hate with comedies today, is that dialogue never seems to be a key factor, but rather someone falling on their a**. In Ladkillers, the dialogue of Tom Hanks' character is brilliant. Now, people who did not like the movie because of ""sterotypical"" characters, were most likely referring to Mr. Wayans character, who, to be honest, does follow suit of the overused violent, vulgar, ""gangsta"" black man archetype, though he is excellant at playing the character. The other stereotypical character is Lump, who is a overly moronic football player. Other than that, the story, characters, filmwork, dialogue, and most notably, the music are all brilliant and beautifully put together. Speaking of the music, I should point out that all the music is either gospel or gospel-like rap from the Nappy Roots, this is to match Ima P. Hall's character and the fact that the gang of thieves are posing as a gospel-inspired enemble. Please, for once, I'd like to see a GOOD comedy do well, not to insult American Pie and Eurotrip and Old School, etc (all of which I did enjoy), but di*k and fart jokes aren't what I consider ""smart comedy"", which is usually well-thought out comedy [ie Futurama and The Simpsons(even though I now hate The Simpsons].

Some of it is visually stunning, too, like the island of trash that looks like an hallucinatory hell in some dreamlike sea.

2070436,3,B00029LNZA,"In the tradition of the 1949 gem, ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"", the original film that the Coen's based their work on was a 1955 British farce, ""The Ladykillers"". It is nearly impossible to improve on this version, which is usually the sign of a great film to use when presenting parody.
The Coen's have made a farcical update that seems destined to fail at the theaters, but could become a cult classic on DVD, much in the way ""The Big Lebowski"" has. Central to this possibility, of course, will be what DVD extras the Coens have saved for posterity.
I saw the film in the theater, and it invoked a lot of smiles, a few laughs, and a vague feeling of disappointment when I left. The concept they had was brilliant - try to repeat much of the first plot, but reset the film in the American south, where they scored so well with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"". They're faithful to the original gang of thieves in composition, but they weighed down the film with so many now-familiar and misplaced gags, that they sunk their own ship.
In plotting, Professor Dorr is a genteel and voluble gentleman who arrives at the home of widow Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall, whose film and TV will surprise you - she's been in small roles in everything!), looking for a room to rent. He also needs her basement root cellar for his musical group to practice. Said group plays Renaissance instruments and medieval melodies. Mrs. Munson seems taken in, particulary when Dorr is willing to rescue her cat, Pickles, from a tree.  Hanks gets the chance to play eccentric in just about every way possible, from his southern gentleman white suits, cut in Sherlock Holmes style, to his amazing overbite and his vocabulary and ability to quote just about every obscure work of fiction known to man.
The Professor is secretly a con man who has enlisted a gang of four to help him tunnel from the Munson residence to the vault at the local Mississippi riverboat casino. Hanks is deliciously smarmy in his role, and he must have studied every film made of Tenessee Williams plays to come up with his demeanor. He's way over the top, which is just what the Coens intended.
Hall, by contrast, dedicated to the memory of her dead husband, (whose expression-shifting portrait hangs above the mantel) is a churchgoing, genteel kind of lady with a backbone of steel. The Coens allow her to play it straight, with just a touch of the slapstick, and Hall really delivers. She's the central force of the movie, discovering the boys with their hands in their ill-begotten cash, enthusiastically moving to the music of her church's gospel choir, and evading all the gang's efforts to get rid of her when she learns their secret.
The gang's roles are all extreme in parody - and here the Coen's fail to deliver. Just a little subtely might have played better with Hanks' and Hall's mastery, and saved the film.
Marvin Wayans is Gawain MacSam, the inside man at the casino, who plays a foul-mouthed janitor. He's way too predictable, and the incredible amount of profanity loaded into his role (especially at the.. cringe...Waffle House scene) will drive away much of the audience. J.K. Simmons, a favorite of mine (you've seen him as the evil Vern in the cable show, ""Oz"" and as the astute psychiatrist in TV's ""Law and Order"") plays Garth Pancake, the demolitions expert. Simmons pulls the role off, despite being hobbled by two incredibly poor film gags; the opening scene with a bulldog and the horrendous bathroom humor of Pancake's suffering with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Tzi Ma, playing Vietnamese soldier, ""The General"" has a great opening in his doughnut shop, but fades in his role in later scenes. Note his Hitler-ish mustache. Ryan Hurst rounds out the gang as Lump Hudson, the requisite dumb football player.
As the gang begins to ""get theirs"", a final star of the movie, the local garbage scow, is used as a prop for the continuing saga. It will make you chuckle, at least a little. The Coens are an acquired taste, but I sure didn't leave the theater with the same feeling I had with ""Fargo"". I think, in this film, they unwisely pulled a few gags that took it from entertaining to absurd. Still and all, unless you can't deal with excessive cursing, ""The Ladykillers"" will be worth seeing on DVD, although it can't hold a candle to the original. I think another watch on DVD will give me a lot of the subtle film details I may have missed in the theater run.

The fact that it was different, however, didn't mean that the movie was free of faults.

The major hold-over from the original script seems to be the pacing.  The movie moves slower than anything else the Coens have done, and some of the gospel performances, while delightful, do begin to drag.

The story just wasn't ""heist"" enough for a heist film, and sure as heck wasn't funny enough for a comedy. Uh, who decided that Irritable Bowel Syndrome was funny? Oh no, I might have spoiled the movie by mentioning ""IBS"" . . . but if that's a spoiler, then that alone tells you what type of movie you're in for.
One last comment: bear in mind that I was one of the few people who actually LIKED Intolerable Cruelty, and still I wasn't impressed with this movie.
My advice : wait for the DVD release or at least catch the matinee showing.",1081209600,,808,4.429530201342282
2070440,5,B00029LNZA,"I haven't seen many Coen brothers movies but this was hilarious.
I haven't seen the original either but this was great. The movie is about an old lady named Ms. Munson (Irma P.Hall) who is a quiet,church loving woman offering a room to rent when
Goldthwait Higginson Dorr phd (Hanks) shows up on her doorstep.
He claims he is taking a break from teaching at a university to engage in his passion which is playing a music with a group he calls his merry little band of miscreants which include,
The General (Tzi Ma) a man who has a strange ability to hide a lit cigarette in his mouth,Garth Pancake a man who believes everything is the easiest thing in the world. Lump,a football player who has been hit one to many times and their inside man played hilariously by Marlon Wayans. But the groupisn't there to play church music but they are really there to dig through Mr. Munsons basement to get to an underground stash of casino money. The movie is funny but gets really dark at the end,Irma. P Hall,Marlon Wayans,and Tom Hanks are great and this is one great film. A- for the movie. Enjoy!!!",1081123200,5,1091,4.4874371859296485
2070441,3,B00029LNZA,"I've never seen the original version of this movie.  In fact, until the Coen Brothers' remake came out, I don't think I'd ever heard of it.  I do know that my loyalty is to the Coen Brothers, and their usual team: cinematographer Roger Deakins, composer Carter Burwell, musical producer T-Bone Burnett, and their usual repertory cast, which is inevitably bound to produce a sublime turn by John Turturro or John Goodman or Steve Buscemi or the like.
""The Ladykillers"" proves a little weak in the long run.  Oh, the hallmarks are there.  You can tell this is a Roger Deakins film by the look of the gigantic island of garbage being built, barge by barge, in the middle of the Mississipi.  The silent passage of the barges beneath the movie's signature bridge is exactly the kind of visual marker you'll get at the opening of a Coen Brothers' movie, like the tumbleweed narrating the front credits of ""The Big Lebowski"".
However, I found myself annoyed with the parade of stilted characters.  Off-the-wall characters with a believable human spirit: that's what the Coen Brothers were always about.  Even in his pathetic way, you had to feel some shred of remorse of Jerry Lundegaard in ""Fargo"", ice-cold as the character was.  Tom Hanks in ""The Ladykillers"" (with an intentionally distracting snaggle-tooth and a sometime British accent) is meant to be that un/sympathetic, but the character's ""joke"" (his tangled syntax) got stale by the second scene, and the movie still had 90 minutes to go by then.  Someone else has a loud case of irritable bowel syndrome (a plot done more believably on a recent ""Sopranos""), and two other supporting characters are wasted one-note jokes.
The casting is first-rate, as always.  J.K. Simmons runs a million miles with his character.  Steven Root is pleasingly weaselly in his two scenes.  Marlon Wayans, however, feels like he's on loan from another movie.  The gospel soundtrack, while rousing on its own, also feels misplaced.  All the elements are good on their own, but the sum total of the elements is a ""so what?"".
The ""main"" characters are Irma P. Hall, whose steadfast churchgoing Mrs. Munson foils the heist and saves the day; as well as her cognizant cat, who gets in the movie's last word (involving another Coen Brothers' trademark, a severed finger).  The final joke (a bequest to Bob Jones University) is the Coen Brothers' sardonic humor at its finest.  But there are so many other heists-gone-awry in the Coen Brothers' film library that ""The Ladykillers"" quickly rises to just the middle of the pack.",1081036800,,2553,4.902325581395349
2070442,2,B00029LNZA,"I went to see ""Ladykillers"" this weekend, hoping to have a good laugh with one of my favorite comedic actors, Tom Hanks, and to enjoy the silliness of Marlon Wayans. I was concerned after hearing the ""N"" word several times during the beginning of the movie from the African-American female star. Also, Marlon Wayans addressed everyone he met with ""What's Up, (...)."" There is a lot of unnecessary profanity in this movie, so it would not be suitable for youth. That aside, there are a FEW funny moments: the painting of ""Otha,"" the deceased husband of the female star, whose painted expression changes at different times in the movie, and ""Pickles"" the cat, a talented animal actor who ends up carrying off the severed finger of one of the criminals. Marlon Wayan's character is stereotypically the first to die in this romp... Take my advice and save a few dollars -- this is definitely a movie you can wait to see in video.",1081036800,,925,4.680981595092025
2070443,4,B00029LNZA,"The Ladykillers, while not being a remake completely, is surely a more than fun and different spin on the 1955 original classic starring Sir Alex Guiness and Peter Sellers.  This film is directed by the wonderful Coen brother, Ethan and Joel, who brought us Fargo, The Big Lebowski and O' Brother, Where are Thou?
  Tom Hanks stars as Golswaitt Higgenson, Dorr, Ph. D.  He's the leader of a bunch of thiers, including the hiliarious Marlon Wayans.  All the stars bring something to the movie, which really is truly a crowd pleaser.  Irma P. Hall plays the nice lady who offers Hanks and his band to practice in the root celler of her house, but she doesn't know that they're planning a secret heist in order to obtain nearly 1.6 million dollars.
Hanks with his southern accent makes a delightful perfomance and has a presence which resembles that of Colonel Sanders.  Though I should point that his performance though it is wonderful and more than entertaining is not really oscar worthy, but I'm sure he'll rack up a nomination.
  The Ladykillers is rated R for Language, including Sexual References.  THe language is excessive and pretty strong, there's also some sexual language/innuendo along with deaths which are intended to be humorous.  The film also has a sterotypical look, courtesy of the Coen brothers.  But a more than funny film, and not a bad film to see on a Saturday night at your local theatre, if not in a theatre definitly check out when it hits the shelves at your local Blockbuster.  Not a bad pick to own on Video or DVD.",1081036800,7,1544,4.695167286245353
2070444,5,B00029LNZA,"I have to admit I'm a huge fan of the Coen brothers, so I naturally went into this movie with high expectations.  And I have to say that, yet again, the Coen Brothers have come up with another excellent film. Who cares that this is a remake of some fifties movie, the Coen's create a version of the deep-south that is modern, and yet also timeless.  The scenery is beautiful, and the dialogue is as crisp and brilliant as ever.  A genuine highlight here is Tom Hanks, relishing his role as a bad guy for once, and turning in one of the best performances he's ever done.  Irma P. Hall is also fantastic, mumbling and lumbering through the whole film like the proverbial unstoppable force.  The rest of the thieves are a little stereotyped it's true, although what charming stereotypes they are.  Law and Order's Dr Emil Skoda is an exception to this - a genuinely fresh character rarely seen in movies, but his role never really goes anywhere (until he begins to go everywhere...).
The major hold-over from the original script seems to be the pacing.  The movie moves slower than anything else the Coens have done, and some of the gospel performances, while delightful, do begin to drag. But the slower plot does recreate the feel of the deep south and give the main character time to breath more.
The humor is dark, the story is ludicrously wonderful and the music is awesome.  Go see this one tonight!",1080950400,10,1402,4.58
