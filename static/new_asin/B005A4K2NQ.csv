8463189,1,B005A4K2NQ,When are we going to see the whole series in English only and will play on USA DVD's??  My special need's daughter loves the series!,1423440000,,132,4.28
8463190,1,B005A4K2NQ,"Although this is the full Lilo & Stitch series, avoid this product if you don't understand French. Make sure you have an all zone(international) dvd player. The first two DVD packs are English/French dubbed/subtitles, however, the last two DVD packs are French only. A bad way to do business if they advertise English and French. The seller is in no way at fault, its the company.",1395014400,7,380,4.7727272727272725
