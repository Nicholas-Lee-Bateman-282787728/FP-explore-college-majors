6461957,4,B00L1WJK2K,"Great packaging, and art work. sound was great. Quality of the video itself was good and acceptable. My only beef is with Warner Bothers or whoever produces the DVDs. I have seen many other old shows on DVD, for about the same price, that have been digitally remastered to HD quality. None of the FBI DVDs from season 1 through 8 have been remastered. That aside, I liked this old series, and watched most of the shows in adolescence. The only change the show did in season eight, was to change the beginng format. For the first seven seasons, they showed the beginning crime, and then freeze frame with the list of the crimes committed and the fictional characters names. This combination, along with the music cue opening was very effective. The last two seasons openings started with what was called a teaser. A few quick dramatic scenes from the show to come, then the opening. Producer Quinn Martin did this in many of his shows, like the Untouchables, and The Fugitive. Good old show.",1404432000,12,990,4.662857142857143

6461972,5,B00L1WJK2K,"Next to last season for this great series. The only gripe I have with the show is all the vehicles featured in it are Fords.
 I understand that Ford was the sponsor of the show but it would have been nice to include a few other makes of cars

Patrick Gray was not included (few people know that Hoover appeared in the season opening prologues of the previous seven seasons, though were not included when the series went into syndication probably because of pressure from the bureau).",1507334400,,377,5.3

8663280,3,B00L1WJK2K,Weak entry in  the series. Most of the episodes are boring with an emphasis on trivial crimes. The entry Gathering of Sharks is a prime example. Still one of my favorite series of all time.,1475452800,,189,4.4
8663281,2,B00L1WJK2K,"SEE BELOW ON THE DISCS THEMSELVES:

Though there is no remastering or cleanup of any kind (to the best of my knowledge although one season shows Dolby mono but not the others best I can tell), the plain film transfers are quite good. Our Blu-ray/DVD player did a great job on the output presentation with very minimal if any noticeable noise or artifacts even on a 78"" screen where just about every anomaly appears . The picture format was also set to 16:9 vs 4:3 ratio which also maintained very enjoyable (albeit slightly stretched) watching quality. Optimally we set our audio receiver to ""Mono"" which is a match for the audio output on these discs. The audio was not muddy and rather clean but of course it lacked much dimension. Both the music score and voice could be heard clearly without strain (we have a Denon receiver 5.1 sound). Additionally I had also performed an additional satisfactory test by playing one DVD (disc 1) on our computer (non Blu-ray) to a 50"" plasma TV screen and it too appeared quite good as well as the audio which was listened to via good quality closed ear (non ear buds) headphones.
Setting the performances and episodes aside (which I would rate between a 3.5 and 5), all things considered, this would get a 5 star on the straight film transfer to digital on Warner Brothers part. Perhaps for the small ransom they are asking though, surely something else could have been included such as bonus material, interviews, outtakes and so on as with the Quinn Martin ""Invaders"" series where Roy Thinnes has multiple introductions and the unedited pilot was included. The FBI film transfers show minute bits of dust, scratches and other anomalies only on rare occasion. The color prints held up quite well without any noticeable fading or color degradation overall. If you have an audio receiver I'd suggest flipping through your sound modes and check out the mono option if it exists. Overall I would certainly recommend this Season 9 except for the MODS - continue reading.

UPDATE: The packaging itself is a different story. Since we all don't play the disc right away I opted after a few days to inspect all the discs and found markings on Disc 1,2, 5 and 6. Well it gets worse from here. I ordered Season 9 with two damaged discs. Season 4 all seven discs had fine small scratches, two had blotch stains. Season 3 all but one disc had markings. one was acceptable, the others all had small scratches and or circular markings. These MOD discs are unacceptable especially at this price. It's hard to blame the reseller. Season 3 and 4 I had ordered from deepdiscount.com, a different vendor though they resell here on Amazon also. It's difficult to buy another FBI disc until WB remedies this issue. I have written to them with my receipts and evidence of purchase and photos. They have agreed to replace season 8 and 9. Awaiting a reply for Season 3 and 4. I've included a sample image of what you can expect with these discs. I am confident this is clearly a handling issue at the WB plant where they are burned and packaged.",1471046400,2,3061,4.656192236598891
8663282,3,B00L1WJK2K,Like the product. Should have been packaged with materials to prevent it from coming loose and apart during shipping,1456876800,,116,5.157894736842105
8663283,5,B00L1WJK2K,"Can't get enough of this well-produced crime drama. As with other seasons, really excellent remastering (even going back to Season 1 in 1965). When I was a kid, we used to argue (we had the one TV set) on Sunday nights about to watch Ed Sullivan or The FBI. I guess you know where I stood (no disrespect for the iconic TV host). Our compromise came from the logic of watching reruns (I actually wrote down the titles of episodes we watched so no one could say 'we saw this FBI already! OK....I was nuts, but it worked.)
I am not purchasing the FBI in Season order. I looked on the IMDb which lists the guest stars for all 9 seasons. I always though Vic Morrow was great in 'Combat!' and I knew he was on a couple of FBI's. He was:Seasons 6 & 8.
This is the full Season 8 (earlier seasons were sold in 2 volumes). The clarity of these classic episodes is really close to Blu-ray quality. I have other shows on DVD from the same vintage and not all were done as this series.",1453075200,,972,4.175531914893617
8663284,5,B00L1WJK2K,"Good packaging, standard DVD case with flipping holders for each disk.",1443657600,,70,5.454545454545454

8663286,5,B00L1WJK2K,Here is the 8th season of this classic TV show still going strong back in the 70`s.  Not too bad for a show that started back in 1965.  The episodes are full of non stop action.  A must have for fans of classic TV,1434931200,,213,3.7954545454545454
