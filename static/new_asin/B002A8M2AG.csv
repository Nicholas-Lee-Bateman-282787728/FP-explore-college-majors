8359085,4,B002A8M2AG,"I have a fairly good collection of ""B"" westerns from the 1930s and love them;John Wayne,Bob Steele,Tex Ritter,Harry Carey,Ken&Kermit Maynard,Mc Coy,Gibson etc,etc,but except for Ritter they are not ""singing cowboys""(yeah,I got John Wayne as Singing Sandy"" but thank goodness that never went anywhere) Autry was in a class all by himself,Roy Rogers was good but no match for Autry,(my personal opinion)and with Smiley Burnette made some of the most enjoyable films of the time. As a group,the films just up until Autry went into the Army Air Corps in 42 or 43 generally have many more songs/music in them than the films made after his return from the war. These are two of the better films out of 90 something he made. The ""Big Show"" has 11 songs I think including ""Nobodys Darling But Mine"" (nominated for an Oscar as best song of the year in 41 I think) and Roy Rogers has a speaking/singing part in ""The Old Corral"". Gene Autry as far as I know, is the only person to have a sidewalk star in all 5 entertainment categories in Hollywood. Google his homepage, its very interesting from a film/Hollywood history point of view. By the way,this Autry dvd is from ""Total Content"" and though they are not restored are functional and enjoyable.",1344556800,,1238,4.7627906976744185
