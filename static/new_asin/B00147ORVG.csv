3689944,3,B00147ORVG,"This movie took seven years of someones life to make. It had a few brilliant moments, but the dialogue was so poor that it virtually ruined the entire movie. So much time was spent planning, and raising money, and shooting, and editing that the director forgot to write a good script. It's a great companion piece to ""American Movie.""",1264291200,5,334,4.677966101694915

3689956,1,B00147ORVG,"I have seen a lot of bad movies throughout my 33 years of life, but this qualifies as one of the ABSOLUTE WORST EVER. There are a lot of cheesy, bad movies that actually turn out to be good because they are frickin hilarious. But this movie is not funny at all, it is definitely one of the most horrible movies ever made.",1433462400,,321,4.111111111111111
3689957,5,B00147ORVG,"First of all, this movie is a rip-of of ""The Craft"" (not necessarily a bad thing). The storylines converge throughout (e.g. the use of cantrips/glamours to mess with the other students, then causing some of their deaths), and the end scene is nearly verbatim. Secondly...bare breasts! A guy can appreciate that in a film...no matter how bad the production quality / acting / plot / scenery may be, topless women can salvage it. The outtakes are entertaining, too. That's about all I can remember about this flick. It's worth a look if you're bored or drunk one evening and need a good laugh.",1431648000,2,591,4.747572815533981

3689959,1,B00147ORVG,"I am a die hard fan of 'B' movies, but this one was such garbage. Not only was the acting horrible, the scenery/set absolutely rubbish, the story line so absolutely generic & ridiculous, but the, by far, absolutely worst part was that it straight out looks as if ZERO attempt was even made to TRY to make it a semi-watchable/relatable movie. The facts portraying to the storyline definitely should have been researched, that MIGHT have made it more bearable. I honestly wasn't going to leave a review BUT it was SO AWFUL that I felt others should be 'warned' NOT to waste those 100+ minutes of their lives... once they are gone, they are gone... never to be retrieved again.... The ONLY redeemable part was the bloopers at the end. So take some advice... fast forward through the entire movie & get a laugh at the bloopers.",1430870400,,823,4.605442176870748
3689960,1,B00147ORVG,"I gave it a go, but couldn't watch it.  Egad, C movie!  I think this was directed and produced in someone's garage.  Special effects get a D-. And who hired a 4-beat band which couldn't keep time?  I watched the first five minutes, then bounced around to other scenes, and just got more depressed s I watched.  The fake blood from the guy on his knees in the copy room was so horribly fake I wanted to cry for him.  OUCH!, but blessed be.",1422835200,,438,4.154761904761905
3689961,1,B00147ORVG,"I was going to try and resume witching this ridiculous movie but we're moving onto something else.

First of all the premise doesn't make one iota of sense. How is it that you have a bunch of out-of-the-closet witches attending a Roman Catholic College?  I'd really love to have someone explain that one away.

Secondly you have this raving broom riding B**** in that ridiculous cliche of a black slip with a huge upside down pentacle parading around the place bullying her mousey little minions around.
Excuse me but that ensemble does nothing for you honey. I've seen and bought better at second hand stores. I mean really, is that all you've got in your closet, sheeeeeesh.

And then we've got this Glinda goody two shoes who swears she's a ""good"" witch and then does an about face and partakes in blood letting. Bad mojo right there dearie. Ya shoulda stuck to the potpourri in the bathtub routine.

I laughed so hard at that line ""are you a good witch or a bad witch""
Personally I loved Endora's (Bewitched) response, ""oh, com si comme sa""

I have no idea how this tawdry ""Charmed"" wannabe ends but it probably has Glinda going after the Witch of the West and all that good stuff.",1420502400,2,1185,4.566037735849057

3689975,3,B00147ORVG,"Ok, well, I did not expect a high quality movie, and I got what I expected...lol... It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was close.  Basically it is like a very VERY low budget version of The Craft, with gratuitous sex and nudity thrown in. With three witches already being there and the fourth coming in and the power grows once they have their fourth, even to the point of having one of the coven members with a scar that was fixed by the coven's magick.  The acting wasn't that good either, they were rather stiff and fakey.  That being said, I don't hate that I watched it once, though I wouldn't watch it again.  I do love a good bad movie, and though this wasn't really ""good bad movie"" quality, for a freely streamed movie (on prime instant video) to watch while I worked on my chainmaille, it was ok.",1409529600,5,820,4.305194805194805
3689976,2,B00147ORVG,I gave it two star for its unique take on an classic cocept. Would i watch it again no!,1409270400,,87,3.6315789473684212
3689977,1,B00147ORVG,"This show is just stupid and offensive to anyone who's ever seriously studied or wanted to seriously study Witchcraft.  As a longtime Witchcraft author and teacher, I would never have even considered watching something like this, but I had to, for a paper in an anthropology class - to show how the entertainment industry is completely clueless about what Witches really are.  This show is a classic example.  Don't waste your time. (Read my books instead!  Just kidding.  Sort of. Haha)",1402531200,,487,4.962962962962963
3689978,3,B00147ORVG,"This movie is about witchcraft & the causes of using the craft in a wrong way. I like the fact that it's about witchcraft, even though it's mis-represent the Wiccan (witchcraft) laws in some instances. I would recommend this movie if you like to watch a cheesey version of the movie The Craft!",1399680000,,293,4.547169811320755
3689979,1,B00147ORVG,This movie was so bad I had to turn it off after a half hour.  Waste of time.  The acting was horrible.,1394064000,,103,3.6363636363636362
3689980,1,B00147ORVG,"It seems like a low budget film. I couldn't get past the first 10 minutes. Overacted, poor sound quality, and lighting.",1392076800,,119,4.714285714285714
3689981,2,B00147ORVG,"Supernatural horror is my favorite film (sub)genre mostly because I'm interested in 'the occult' anyway.  I don't expect much beyond entertainment or a laugh when watching a supernatural horror film.  Generally I'm disappointed even at that, though sometimes I'm surprised.  This film could have conceivably been worse.  Some of the acting isn't too bad and the plot is semi-coherent though very derivative of The Craft (1996) and utterly predictable, while the dialog is predictably bad. A young child might enjoy the simplicity of it. The actress who played the 'dark' witch was convincingly shallow and banal, yet beautiful at the same time.  It's funny, I watched the whole thing until the big climatic fight scene and then turned it off.  I'd had enough.",1375315200,,759,5.130081300813008
3689982,5,B00147ORVG,"Autmn is a new girl who is a witch and misses but had to leave behind her own coven when she goes to a new school, she meets Vallie the dark haired beautiful bad girl and tough chick and witch who is recruiting members to form her own coven the two become fast friends, and Autmn meets Vallie's friends. After a few weird and creepy things happen Autmn quickly learns that Vallie is heavily into black magic, and has enslaved some people with it. Vallie has hair from each of her victims that she keeps in a photo album book in the photo slots labeled with the persons name that she uses when she  wants to do something to them. Autumn and Vallie's friends have to ban together against Vallie in a battle of good versus evil, no easy task because Vallie is nearly as powerful as a demon. I love this film and watched it twice, great acting and characters",1374796800,4,854,4.304347826086956
3689983,5,B00147ORVG,"I just purchased Mark Borchardt's first public film release known as 'Coven'. Like many people, I didn't know what Coven was, or who Mark Borchardt was until I saw the documentary 'American Movie', and I'm glad I found out. Coven is the film short that Mark Borchardt created in order to raise funds so that he could finish his film 'Northwestern'. I personally have a soft spot in my heart for this film because I am an amateur filmmaker that is trying to get my projects in order so that one day I might get noticed. I think Coven is very Avant garde in it's approach, and that may be what turns certain people off, but if you watch amateur films, B films, monster movies, film noir, etc.. then you will like this movie. If your one of those people who wan't to complain about the films' low production values and the editing, then keep in mind that this was his first film, and that is why it is considered important and special to Mark and his fans. Check it out, and watch American Movie and you will understand this film more. (It's a great companion piece considering it's connection to this film)",1360022400,7,1104,4.443349753694581
3689984,1,B00147ORVG,"This movie is beyond horrible, and I am making this judgment after watching very little of the movie. From the second I hit play, I regretted renting it. It is like C or D rate, looks like something a bunch of film students threw together. I don't know if I will even bother finishing it. Do what you want, but I wouldn't waste the 1.99 for this garbage.",1343347200,,354,4.220588235294118

The actors did great, the camera work, especially with the woods and the water, was very good. The special effects - cheesy, but hey, that's what you get with a low budget film. I really enjoyed this movie, it made me laugh with the cheesy tone. If you're looking for an alternative movie and you have an hour or so to spend, watch this film - it was a good laugh.
