8297707,5,B001ECQN2C,"If I'd known I could buy all 3 of these together for 70 dollars I never would have purchased them individually for 10 dollars each.
Oh, if only I could turn back the clock, I could have spent twice as much money on these movies. Woe is me.",1362355200,,239,4.0
8297708,5,B001ECQN2C,i love all these movies and getting them in a bundle is like heaven! long live the horror genre and raimi,1354838400,,105,4.0476190476190474
8297709,5,B001ECQN2C,"I love, love, love these movies.  If you like zombies, then you HAVE to buy these.  Evil Dead 2 is the more humorous of the three movies, but they all bring awesomeness to the table.  The only thing I will say is buy these individually.  It's about 20 bucks cheaper based on the individual blu ray prices of these.",1288656000,,314,4.271186440677966
8297710,5,B001ECQN2C,"I have all 3 of these movies on dvd and vhs, but recently got into Blu-ray, so I had to have these 3 classics for my collection (yet again).  The description is a bit misleading on the Dawn of the Dead, but I assure you that it's the 1978 original included in the pack.  You save a few bucks by getting them together, but could probably find them even cheaper if you really hunted for it.  If you are missing these 3 in your Blu-ray collection, I suggest you grab them up.",1271635200,,472,4.108695652173913
8297711,3,B001ECQN2C,"well i bought evil dead 2 at walmart the other day for $10 but the other 2 were $19.99 each  for a grand total of.....drum roll.........

$49.98  but wait!!! you can purchase it on amazon.com for only $232.00 or $62.90 both are ""amazon exclusives"" the only differences is the release date.",1255478400,,289,4.627450980392157
8297712,4,B001ECQN2C,"The original versions of Dawn of the Dead and Day of the the Dead, combined with Evil Dead II.  What's not to like?  All 3 are must-own for horror fans, and getting them in this 3-pack saves some money as well.",1254528000,4,210,4.097560975609756
8297713,5,B001ECQN2C,As a huge horror fan I just had to add these three to my collection and they do not dissapoint! The picture quality is an improvement over the DVDs as well as the sound! Recommended.,1244419200,3,182,4.228571428571429
8297714,3,B001ECQN2C,"These movies are great.  However I am very confused.  The picture for the three blu-rays clearly shows the old version of Dawn of the Dead, whereas the description describes the Zac Snyder remake.  Which is it that comes with the bundle?  I don't know.",1241740800,4,252,4.659090909090909
8297715,5,B001ECQN2C,"Love these classics, especially Evil Dead II.  Was happy to add these to my Blu-ray collection.  The transfer is also good.",1239321600,,123,4.809523809523809
8297716,3,B001ECQN2C,"Okay, this bundle contains three great horror movies.  It is 100% worth the money.

My problem with this bundle is that it is called ""Zombie Bundle"".  In the entirety of Evil Dead series, there is not a single zombie; demons possess the bodies of the dead and living.",1223251200,,267,4.520833333333333
