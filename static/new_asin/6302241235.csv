446212,5,6302241235,"I have been a huge Red Skelton's fan when I watched his TV show, yes I'm that old. This movie is so funny I laughed and had a fun time watching this movie.",1402617600,,155,3.727272727272727
446213,5,6302241235,"As far as story & execution go, ""Watch the Birdie"" (1950) is probably a notch below such Skelton classics as ""The Fuller Brush Man"", ""A Southern Yankee"", and ""The Yellow Cab Man"". What do they have in common? Why Red, of course, giving his all to make us laugh. This was Red's final brush with comedy legend Buster Keaton (as this was a remake of Keaton's silent ""The Cameraman""). Told in a compact 71 minutes, WTB is a genial comedy about Rusty Cammeron who does what he can to save his camera store from foreclosure. Again, Red's talents are used to great effect as he portrays Rusty, his father, and grandfather. There are some terrific moments to savor: The changing room bit; Rusty's news story coverage (with each segment backfiring hilariously); the outboard motor bit; and an offbeat but funny climax aboard an elevated loading vehicle.
Cheesecake is sliced up in the form of Arlene Dahl & Ann Miller. However, the climax feels abrupt as the movie ends right when Red & Dahl deliver the crooks to police. End scene. There should've been a nice closing scene or follow-up gag.
No matter. This is still an enjoyable Skelton film, simply because Red is there. Kudos to one of the great movie clowns!",1344556800,3,1204,4.683962264150943

446215,2,6302241235,Warners is releasing all of the Red skelton movies of the late 40's and early 50's-good news. Bad news is they are releasing them separately on dvd-r at $20 each-dvd-r means NO subtitles or extras of any kind. These should have been released as a collection subtitled and reasonably priced. Warners is showing NO respect for people that need sdh and are being greedy and not very smart. They actually would sell more product and create good will my way. The dvd-r's are an insulting new wave by certain companies. What a shame!!!,1340496000,3,529,4.698924731182796
446216,5,6302241235,"what is wrong with this picture, Red Skelton Arlene Dahl Ann Miller in a remake of a Buster Keaton film ""the Camera Man"". the answer is...Nothing at All. it is a great and funny movie, on tape as it is here, or in a dvd format, it was make by MGM and Red plays three people in it. i watched it right away when it came in, i only wish i had an audience here in my house to see it with. it must have been wonderful years ago to see real comedies at the movie theaters in stead of the junk they make now a days.",1290556800,4,508,3.7570093457943927
446217,4,6302241235,"Red plays Rusty Cammeron (also plays Rusty`s father and grandfather) who runs a photography shop.
He decides to earn some extra money as a free lance photographer, but is just as inept at that as he is at running the camera shop.
The fun really gets going when he accidently takes a photo that exposes an embezzlement scam.
While this is not one of Skelton`s very best feature films, it is very funny and well worth watching.",1265414400,2,425,4.532467532467533
446218,4,6302241235,"There are no less than seven different films entitled ""Watch the Birdie,"" dating back to the 1920s. All of them concern photography. This Red Skelton edition was scripted by Ivan Tors, who would later create many famous disaster flicks and TV series like ""Flipper"" and ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea."" Keep a look out for a cameo by Jeff York-- he was a dead ringer for Li'l Abner when he played the Al Capp comic strip character in the 1940 movie, which also featured Buster Keaton as the strange little Indian, Lonesome Polecat. Keaton contributed some of his classic sight gags to ""Birdie.""

THE STORY:  Red portrays three generations of Cammerons: Rusty, who manages his dad's photgraphic store, the father (Pop) and grandfather (Grandpop). Rusty tries to earn extra cash as a freelance photographer. A woman named Lucia (Dahl) who accidentally causes him to fall into the sea from a boat, becomes affectionate toward Rusty. She helps him make a go of the camera shop. Rusty soon realizes that Lucia's business manager (Ames) is embezzling her money via a housing project. When Lucia has Rusty take photos of the construction site to promote the project, he unwittingly captures proof of the scam.

As of 12/08, this movie is only available on VHS.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YELLOW-CAB-MAN/dp/6302641829/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YELLOW CAB MAN</a>,  a Skelton vehicle released the same year, is not yet on DVD, either.

As with other movies by Red Skelton in my collection, Watch the Birdie was enjoyable, offering quite a few laughs
