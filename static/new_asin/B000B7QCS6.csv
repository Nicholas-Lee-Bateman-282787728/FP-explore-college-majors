2405240,1,B000B7QCS6,"This movie is so awful it's laughable. Ever go to the movies and feel you were ripped off. I got this movie for rewards points and still feel ripped off. Yes, it's that bad. Kate Jackson never could act, she had one voice she repeatedly used, it's a cross between southern and whinney and by no means pleasing to hear. David Carradine is a better actor (only by a little bit) but the writing is so bad, he can't begin to save this miserable attempt at movie making either. I gave it one star, because there was no provision for minus 5 stars. It's an hour and a half you'll never get back. It's too late for me, but save yourself and don't buy this movie.",1220572800,4,655,4.2063492063492065
2405241,3,B000B7QCS6,"The movie doesn't have many special effects or a fancy set, but it does have a good plot.  The many stupid gags almost make you laugh throughout the film.  Favorite scenes... David takes Kate's braw off from under her shirt and them breaking hundreds of bottles of soda onto a parking lot.",1215993600,3,289,4.538461538461538
2405242,2,B000B7QCS6,"No, Really.
I bought it as part of a fad I'm going through, looking for car flicks from the 70's. I knew this wouldn't be any Oscar winner, but YEESH! The story line was terrible, the acting about the same & other than the '57 Chevy, there was hardly any cool cars. :D
I did like seeing Kate Jackson as a youngster, though.",1207353600,2,323,4.142857142857143
2405243,5,B000B7QCS6,"A classic 1977 moonshine film (others include Moonshine County Express, a must for future DVD release with John Saxon, William Conrad, Albert Salmi Susan Howard, Claudia Jennings and Maureen McCormick).The DVD includes both full screen and wide screen presentation and the print is amazing quality. Everyone does an excellent job and it is one of those films where you like the 'bad guys' as much as the 'good guys'. David Carradine and Kate Jackson make a likeable duo and Roger C Carmel has fun with his role as does George Murdock and Charles Napier. Also look for Sterling Holloway as one of old time moonshiners. In all a fun filled romp for all.",1202860800,2,651,4.769911504424779
2405244,5,B000B7QCS6,"Awesome film, sorry to see the 57 Chevy get all beat up though. Great mid-70s movie, and Kate Jackson is pretty hot, a true angel. Ranks up there with all the boot-leggin' movies. Carridine was awesome, better than Kung Fu.",1200614400,4,223,4.6
2405245,5,B000B7QCS6,"I loved this movie, I saw it first back in the theaters in 1977 when it first came out.  I feel it's one of the best action movies around.  It has action, comedy, great performaces. I've always liked Kate Jackson and David Carradine and they work great together.  It's escapism and fun viewing on a Saturday afternoon.  Buy you won't be disappointed.",1161043200,25,350,4.596774193548387
2405246,3,B000B7QCS6,"Jackson. Hawai'i Five-0 vet Roger C.

2405247,5,B000B7QCS6,"This film had the misfortune of coming out in the summer of '77 on the heels of ""Smokey and the Bandit"".  Guess which film has more posterity?  I remember seeing this as a kid on a double feature with ""The World's Greatest Lover"" starring Gene Wilder and liked it immensely.  The film's selling point is the car chases but they are secondary to the witty script which was written by William Hjortsberg, author of ""Angel Heart"".  The Florida Everglades are utilized to great effect which adds to film's fantastic ambience.  David Carradine and Kate Jackson have great chemistry and an easy charm that goes down as smoothly as honeydew.  Enjoyable performance by Roger C. Carmel(Mudd from ""Star Trek"") as Ralph Jr., soft drink purveyor who dabbles in toxic moonshine distribution.  Also of note is the presence of Charles Napier, veteran of Jonathan Demme films, as one of Ralph Jr.'s thugs.  Bottom line this movie is Fun! Fun! Fun!",1134864000,37,931,4.848101265822785
2405248,4,B000B7QCS6,"When I first saw this movie I thought what was Kate Jackson thinking?! When I re-watched it, I thought ""They're just having fun so why don't you?"" This movie really grew on me. The chemistry between Carradine and Jackson is pretty good. Jackson's accent is a hoot! Look out for some amazing stunts! Don't expect Shakespeare, just sit back, relax and have a rip-roarin' good time, I did!",976320000,26,386,4.6911764705882355
2405249,1,B000B7QCS6,"I had a couple of scenes in this movie as background. It premiered at the drive in movie in the county where it was filmed! David Carradine is a fair actor but a snob in person! Kate Jackson, on the other hand was a very nice  person! I also had the privilage of doing her hair on the day her stylist  had the flu.",953769600,4,314,3.890625

2405289,5,B000B7QCS6,Great movie. Love the Sheriff. He is mighty bad. Great story and plenty of cool chases thanks to some hot Ford Galaxies and a hot Mercury. Really good early seventies film.,1391817600,,172,4.580645161290323
2405333,4,B000B7QCS6,"So un PC it is fantastic. To run into a chicken truck and see real live chickens scatter (sorry I do believe some animals were hurt in the making of this film.
Not the best acting/plot wise but entertaining for what it is.",1383609600,,222,4.186046511627907

2405335,5,B000B7QCS6,More hot rods and lots of racing and mystery. Sort of hokey but the cars were great to see and watch.,1375056000,,101,3.857142857142857
2405336,1,B000B7QCS6,"If ever there was a movie that had more corn in it that the moonshine this is it. The baloney accent that Kate uses is completely bad. In a chase scene the 57 chevy has a headlight out and it turns the corner its back! how did it get fixed so quickly? For my opinion Thunder Road and Moonshine Highway are the better ones,this one is pure dud.",1373155200,,343,4.0588235294117645
2405337,3,B000B7QCS6,I bought this movie because I liked the car on the cover of the jewel box....and it was all downhill from there! I did watch the whole movie and it was OK overall....It was fun to see old character actors from the 70's.....,1373155200,,223,4.209302325581396
2405338,5,B000B7QCS6,Haven't watched it yet.  Bought it because David Carradine was one of the actors.  A friend recommended the movie to me.,1365984000,,120,4.666666666666667
2405339,2,B000B7QCS6,"I mainly purchased the movie because of the '57 Chevy on the box cover, but unfortunately I was disappointed of the plot and acting. I was looking for more car tuning, drag racing, and car chasing like the '57 Chevy in ""Return to Macon County"" with Nick Nolte and Don Johnson.

This movie is not worth watching more than once in my opinion. The box cover was the only thing appealing enough to want to purchase the movie. As the saying goes, you can't judge a book by its cover, and the same can be said of this movie. I just could not sit through the whole movie without it losing my attention. It doesn't have enough of a plot or cool cars other than the '57 Chevy to even keep my attention throughout the movie.

I ended up giving this movie to my brother to add to his collection of car movies gathering dust. It is not worth cluttering a DVD collection when you have limited space to collect DVDs.",1365120000,,902,4.269005847953216
2405340,5,B000B7QCS6,I mean a classic i higlhy reccomend for anyone who appreciates these kind of movies and David Carradine is just amazing,1364601600,,119,4.714285714285714
2405341,3,B000B7QCS6,It was a campy movie. Not what I thought it would be. I should have read the description closer. My fault,1364256000,,105,4.0476190476190474

2405375,1,B000B7QCS6,Don't waist your money. I find something good in most movies but not this one. The director should be shot and all copies burnt.,1358899200,,128,4.375
2405376,5,B000B7QCS6,"I really liked David Carradine but this was definately not one of his better vehicles.  He was better off as a bad guy co-star in Lone Wolf McQuade than starring in this.  Still, overall it was a pretty decent plot.",1357689600,,215,4.35
2405377,1,B000B7QCS6,This is not a fun movie like American Graffdi.  Who ever rated it as good has no taste.  And it has nudity!!  Full nudity!  Cannot be watched by the whole family.  Total waste of money!!  Shame on whoever said it was good.,1357516800,,222,4.166666666666667
2405378,5,B000B7QCS6,I love watching classic action filled films. Moonshine was a big part of life for many poor southerners during the prohibition era and even beyond. This movie pretty much portrayed the perils exactly as it happened in real life.,1357257600,,228,4.871794871794871
2405379,3,B000B7QCS6,it was a b movie at best but still fun to have. I'll keep it in my movies the kids will watch it too..,1355097600,,102,3.2916666666666665

2405381,5,B000B7QCS6,"One of the best moonshine running movies ever.  David carradine does a great job as a moonshine runner in this campy classic about moonshineing, running from mobsters, running from angry fathers, and running from the law.",1342051200,,221,5.138888888888889
2405382,5,B000B7QCS6,This movie is about a moon shine runner. Car guys you are going to love this David carradine movie. It's a must for Ure collection.,1334361600,,131,4.28
2405412,5,B000B7QCS6,"Really liked it. Low budget but interesting, if you liked Smokey and the Bandit then watch this. A lot of funny side jokes, like the hitman (who was the voice for winnie the poah in real life) who watches captain kangeroo and doesn't like seeing violence on tv. Pretty basic plot, but the chemistry between the actors makes up for it. And Kate Jackson isn't bad to look at.",1328400000,,373,4.420289855072464

2405414,2,B000B7QCS6,"Odd combo of actors, wasn't all that impressed with this movie. Seemed to drag along. There were some action areas, nudity, etc, but not one movie I'd call an old favorite by any means.
Carradine and classic cars, not the mix I'd prefer to see.",1300492800,,244,4.444444444444445
2405415,5,B000B7QCS6,A definite movie to own for all ages!  It's funny and has a great plot and is full of action!  The car chase scenes are as wild as smokey and the bandit or more.,1299456000,,161,3.7058823529411766
2405416,5,B000B7QCS6,THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT SPEEDY TRANSACTION. ALTHOUGH THEY SAID USED...THIS IS LIKE BRAND NEW CD. THANK YOU,1284940800,,104,5.176470588235294
2405417,4,B000B7QCS6,"I just watched this and had a great time! Polyester, ridiculous dialogue, and fun car chases...what more could you ask for?? Most of the movie involves Kate Jackson (pre Charlie's Angels) tagging along with a young David Carridine as they try to catch up to a load of tainted moonshine followed by the law and gangsters, involving a lot of fun car chases and Keystone-cops antics. This film is a hoot! A precursor to Smokey And the Bandit, this is an obviously low budget romp directed by Roger Corman and stars several actors you will recognize, most notably Roger C. Carmel, who played Harry Mudd in two Star Trek episodes, and Sterling Holloway, who played the voice of the snake in the Jungle Book. If you like car chase movies in the vein of Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, Vanishing Point and White Lightning, this will make a fun addition to your collection. I laughed through the whole movie. Pop it in, crack open a Coors and enjoy the show!",1273968000,2,942,4.579881656804734
2405418,2,B000B7QCS6,"I had mentioned that Corey Allen was directing this feature when Sal Mineo was murdered. The photography was terrible by whomever the photographer/cameraman was. Too many ECU's (extreme close-ups). If Corey could redo the film today, I'm sure it would be much better.

I bought it because it was one of David Carradine's feature films from a long time ago. Corey Allen was Buzz in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. That role finished his acting career. He was always associated with that role, as the bad guy who fought James Dean. But, his directing career was pretty successful. This should be a collectible just to have a piece of Carradine's work, now that he is gone. I was surprised to see this on Amazon. Practically at a give away price too.

Corey died a couple of months after Dennis Hopper. The last featured actor of the cast from REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.  He died from Parkinson's disease.",1268524800,,889,4.685897435897436
2405419,3,B000B7QCS6,"Even though this is a campy movie, I still love it for the cars and all actors in it as most of them are not with us anymore, It was an overall great deal from Amazon to pay tribute to the Late Actor David Carridine, and is a harder movie to find these days",1247961600,,257,3.7777777777777777
