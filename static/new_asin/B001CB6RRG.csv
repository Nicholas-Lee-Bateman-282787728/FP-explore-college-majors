8286514,3,B001CB6RRG,"As I have written in other reviews, you must understand Mexican Spanish to enjoy these. These are a type of relatively innocent films as opposed to the more graphic type of films produced today. Basically there is a lot of Mexican style slapstick comedy plus a bevy of scantily clad beautiful women.",1435708800,,299,4.769230769230769
8286515,3,B001CB6RRG,"In this collection of ""3 Sexy Comedias Mexicanas Vol. 1"" from BCI, we got three for the price of one. The first title ""Las borrachas"" (""The Drunken Women"") from 1988 was a total dud! Which was a shame considering it had the very pretty Leticia Perdigon, Lorena Herrera, and Isela Vega. Even the very funny Manuel 'Flaco' Ibanez couldn't save this dull offering. There was no action to speak of, I gave it 2 stars. The picture quality was good. NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 83 mins.

The second title ""Las del talon"" (""The High-Heeled Ones"") from 1978 was directed by Alejandro Galindo. It was based on the tribulations of a group of prostitutes working a club called 'El Paraiso', this one was also a dud. This was more of a crime-drama than a sex-comedy, so it was an odd choice to be included among the three. Even a cast featuring Pilar Pellicer, Maria Fernanda, Ana Luisa Peluffo, Mora Escudero, and Abril Campillo could not save this dull clich&eacute;-ridden tale of exploitation. There was very little action to keep this one afloat. It gets 2 stars. The picture quality was good. NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 85 mins.

The third title ""Los mantenidos"" (""The Kept Men"") was from 1980 and directed by Jaime Fernandez. Finally, we got a real gem hidden within this stale collection! This was a thoroughly enjoyable and funny comedy, with plenty of sexy and beautiful women to keep us interested. When the three sons of an aging and philandering 'Don Juan' got reunited with their lost father, and were recruited to run the family business (brothels, clubs and showgirls), they got more than they bargained for! This was the typical kind of sex-comedy we've come to expect, with plenty of laughs, dance numbers, and the double-entendre jokes that made the Mexican sex-comedies the rage of the 80's. The cast was excellent, especially the beautiful Gloriella, who did 2 sensational and sizzling-hot dance numbers (she had various nude scenes too). Pedro Weber 'Chatanuga' once again with his comic genius, showed why he was indispensable to this subgenre. The opening 'montage' was proof enough that we were in for a real treat: a bathing platinum-blonde beauty whose face was never revealed, leaving you guessing as to her indentity. Where in all likelihood it was Rosella, and not Claudia Islas, that appeared in the opening credits. Unfortunately this title is not availabe on a stand-alone disc, so until then, this is the only sure way to get it. I gave this one 5 well-deserved stars. The picture quality was very good. NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 82 mins. Overall we had two duds against one gem, the last title made up for the first two.

Love and Peace,
