7797105,4,156938245X,"""Merlin, Arthur and the Holy Grail"" is a fun and informative review of the major characters and themes that make up one of the world's most enduring legends.  Enhancing the traditional stories with recent historical and archaelogical discoveries, this documentary explores possible truths behind the fiction, and how the two have blended into one.  Production values are good, and the whole is a colorful and informative viewing experience, especially for those who may not already be familiar with the Arthurian landscape.  Oddly, however, the chapter on the Holy Grail makes no mention of Sir Galahad.  Instead, the earlier story featuring Sir Perceval as Grail-finder is portrayed.  Though not definitive, ""Merlin, Arthur and the Holy Grail"" is a quality production, and I recommend it to anyone fond of the Arthurian realm.",1009324800,13,827,5.3307692307692305
