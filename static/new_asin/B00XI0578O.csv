8715918,4,B00XI0578O,"This budget-conscious two-disc set (featuring two movies per disc) from VCI comprises four somewhat lesser -- though each no less engaging -- films noir previously issued separately by the company. The prints used are the same as those in the individual releases (all of which I've owned at various times prior) but pairing them up like this results in admittedly minor compression issues (mostly notable on Naked Kiss, but really, you should probably snag the Criterion Collection edition of that one, anyway). For my money, the visual difference between these twofers and the earlier VCI singles, however, is negligble, even if the dodgy compression was probably unnecessary considering these are dual-layered discs. The more significant change, for some buyers, between this set and the original singles may be the dropping of the supplemental features. As such, you lose some interesting interviews from Naked Kiss and No Orchids For Miss Blandish, a full-length commentary from New York Confidential, some short subjects on Scarlet Street and various still galleries, trailers and restoration demos spread around the various titles. Instead you gain a reasonably priced combo pack -- perhaps even a starter pack for those less familiar with the film noir genre -- that takes up much less shelf space. For reviews of the films themselves, there are plenty of excellent sources online that should aid in justifying the purchase.

Technical notes: Scarlet Street is presented 1.33:1 full frame, No Orchids is presented 1.37:1 full frame, and both New York Confidential and Naked Kiss are presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen.  Only Scarlet Street contains removable English subtitles. All four films are in glorious black and white.",1448323200,6,1739,5.366300366300366
