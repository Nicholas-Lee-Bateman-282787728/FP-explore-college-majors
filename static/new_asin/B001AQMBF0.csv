3459267,4,B001AQMBF0,"I am very pleased with the dvd i bought (Brotherhood Season 3) but very dissappointed that it was the final season.  At least i have all three seasons on dvd to watch.

My purchases of dvd's from Amazon has been excellent, never a problem.

3459268,4,B001AQMBF0,"No complaints with the quality of the DVDs. As a collector of many DVD series, TV and movie, my one beef is with the presentation. The packaging with the first two seasons match, but the art doesn't. The art matches for the final two seasons, but not the packaging. I'm flexable with what style they (the poeple who decide)choose; I don't love the fold out style Friends and Supernatual used, but they're consistant. They make a nice presentation on my storage shelves.

Ok, one little thing about the story. It seemed all along money was pretty tight for Tommy. Now all of the sudden he makes a major, in stride, purchase with plans of very expensive related costs. Even his wife doesn't even remotely pause to question the accounting end of it. (as of the next to the last episode anyway)

There's stuff we all like and don't like about any given entertainment production. Storywise, I'm very happy with Brotherhood.

Enjoy",1254182400,2,925,4.732919254658385
3459269,4,B001AQMBF0,"The third, and sadly final, season of Showtime's Brotherhood finds the world of the Caffee family getting rocked like never before.  For gangster Michael (Jason Isaacs), he's finding that being in charge isn't as cracked up as it could be, made even more so by the release of Freddie Cork (Kevin Chapman) who himself isn't happy about his new role.  For Tommy Caffee (Jason Clarke), he seeks to leave his life of politics behind him and finally move his pregnant wife Eileen (Annabeth Gish) and family off of The Hill, which soon enough becomes easier said than done.  The rest of the crew has their hands fill as wel, including controlling matriarch Rose (Fionnula Flanagan) and her failing health, Colin (Brian F. O'Byrne) finds his loyalties to Michael tested, and Declan's (Ethan Embry) quest for peace with his wife and job hits a few roadblocks as he makes some huge discoveries that could shake The Hill and the Caffee's to their cores.  The third season of Brotherhood really finds the series hitting its stride, which is a crying shame considering that it got the axe after struggling ratings-wise.  Still, we should be glad that creator Blake Masters managed to wrap things up as much as he did here, and we weren't left on a never-to-be-resovled cliffhanger.  All in all, Brotherhood was a vastly underrated show from its inception onward, but now that it's off the air and on DVD, maybe it will find the audience that it deserves.",1253750400,17,1442,4.794354838709677
3459270,5,B001AQMBF0,"An outstanding series that is considered by fans and critics alike as one of the top shows of all time. Will buy again when it comes out on blu ray. Detailed, authentic, sublime genius. Incredible on every level.",1252713600,7,212,4.605263157894737
3459271,5,B001AQMBF0,"It's a shame this series only gets 3 seasons while shows like CSI Miami and Heroes continue and continue. Definitely was one of the best, if not the best show on television during its three 3 season run. The third season was only 8 episodes but quite possibly the best of the three. Easy five stars and something anyone interested in crime/politics should go out of their way to see. Amazing job by all involved.",1250380800,26,412,4.506666666666667
3459272,5,B001AQMBF0,"First off, I am extremely upset this is the final season for 'Brotherhood'. I, too, cannot say or even find the appropriate words to give praise to such an in-depth, multi-talented masterpiece, but that I love this series. I find myself following Rose's and Eileen's life's turmoils and triumphs the most. Yet, find myself siding with Michael more often then with Tommy. Hmmm!

Showtime has outdone themselves--they've hit the jackpot with series such as 'Brotherhood' and 'Dexter'. The extremely talented writers develop scripts which allows the audience to really 'think' about the characters, their lives and how they are intertwined. The bottom-line, Showtime needs to extend the seasons for 'Brotherhood'. The all-star 'outstanding performances' cast needs these characters to continue on. They still have a lot more to say!!  A+ Rating",1247443200,4,841,5.412213740458015
3459273,5,B001AQMBF0,"I don't want to spoil the final episode for those who haven't yet watched it, but I hope that those interested can find the time to watch all of the prior episodes before watching the last one of season three (hopefully not of the entire series). The final scene has to be some of the best writing and cinematography ever broadcast on television. In a word, apropos. If this is indeed the final season that Showtime orders, the final scene is a fitting way for the storyline to conclude.
There are obvious similarities to another great crime-based drama of the decade, HBO's The Wire. However, Brotherhood focuses more on the political side of crime/corruption, whereas The Wire spends more time on the street. If either of these shows were available on broadcast TV, they would captivate large and dedicated audiences and be phenomenally successful. When one reads reviews for both of these shows on any reputable website, they're gushing with acclaim. These shows have gained a cult-like following. It's a shame that HBO and Showtime instead choose to promote series like Californication and Big Love at the expense of these masterpieces.
The series examines much more than political corruption - the changing demographics and redevelopment of Providence juxtaposed with the longtime situation and residents of ""The Hill"" are continuous themes which are portrayed in a subtle, yet nuanced manner.
In terms of the actors, there really are no weak links. However, Kerry O'Malley portrays an incredibly sympathetic and complex character in Mary-Kate (Tommy and Michael's only sister). Her role and performance is supremely underrated. Although I personally have absolutley nothing in common with her role, she is probably my ""favorite"" character from an incredibly diverse palette that the series provides.
Showtime would make a great contribution to American television by ordering a fourth season.",1241740800,59,1898,5.246710526315789
3459274,5,B001AQMBF0,"i just want to echo what some previous reviewers mentioned about this excellent show only running 3 years, when much lesser shows, like the ones formerly mentioned , run ad nauseum.
this was as good as TV gets and i expected, at least, a 5 year run.
'the wire',and 'six feet under' both had 5 year runs, and they were in the same quality category as 'brotherhood.'
the show,it appears, was cancelled by SHOWTIME because of low ratings.
again, i get punished because of the ignorance of others.
in this america, MEDIOCRITY RULES!",1238457600,10,528,4.688172043010753

3460257,4,B001AQMBF0,Talk about a series that muttles the shade of gray when it comes to evil and the subtleness of being a good guy (continues to look the other way when it comes to family). Interesting to watch the family dynamics and the brutality of the older brother who is like a two headed coin.  I enjoyed the character of the childhood friend who is a cop that keeps trying to do the right thing but political corruption keeps pulling him down.  A good watch and see if you recognize any shady politicians that you have read about lately.,1455667200,,526,4.357142857142857

3460288,3,B001AQMBF0,"This was an interesting family drama placed in Providence which served well as an authentic background. It followed the familiar path of many family dramas with a good brother/bad brother motif. The acting was well done for the most part, the script was mediocre at times and as usual the worst part was the typical lame Hollywood attempts at New England accents. An easy to watch show with fairly predictable results.",1455062400,,418,4.901408450704225

3460321,5,B001AQMBF0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series, but then I am a big fan of Jason Isaacs. I liked the setting, the focus on the brothers and their friends and family, and the progression of the relationships (or ending of relationships as one person or another unfortunately gets killed or actually dies of natural causes - a rarity). Portraying Rhode Island natives, the Caffee brothers, Brit Jason Isaacs, Australian Jason Clarke, their mom, Irish Fionnula Flanagan, and a wonderful assortment of actors all turn in excellent performances. It does strain credibility that no one has arrested Michael Caffee at this point (I'm watching the Final Season DVD) as he has already pretty much maxed out his favorite dumping ground for his homicide victims, but I am enjoying the series too much to quibble. It is fun to watch the political machinations of Tommy Caffee, only slightly less bloodthirsty than his brother Michael's. OK, a lot less bloodthirsty, since the state representatives, Providence mayor, and various minions do not end up buried under an expressway overpass as do those who cross Michael, but still...This is a very good watch if you like this type of drama.",1454457600,,1161,5.020725388601036

3460914,5,B001AQMBF0,"loved this show  because it portrays the realities and complexities of family relationships.  Many of us are raised to believe that no matter what, we protect/support family.  This often is a cause of problems.  Also, i like the fact that we see the good and bad of each character.  There are no 'evil' vs. 'good' people, as in the case of the mother, who can be an extremely disruptive bitch but also be vulnerable.  i was sorry to see it end.",1399852800,,444,4.419753086419753

3460934,3,B001AQMBF0,"Season Three had reached a point where the writing just wasn't making it.  Even worse, it seemed the actors were tired of their roles.  It just didn't hold the punch the previous two seasons had.

Tommy resorts to unscrupulous means to get his will done.  In the meantime, he has real estate difficulties amounting to deeds attributed to Michael.

The one that about Brotherhood that rings true is the love-hate relationship between brothers, especially those on the opposite side of the spectrums.",1397174400,5,498,5.024390243902439

3460968,5,B001AQMBF0,"This is an adult drama with adult themes about an Irish-American family living in Providence, Rhode Island. The main conflict centers around the older brother who is a criminal, and the younger brother who is a politician trying not to be a criminal. The writers show the good, the bad, and the ugly of making choices and having to live with the consequences.

I liked watching season 1 through season 3 on Amazon Prime so to keep the story line fresh and current in my head. The acting is top notch and the episodes are so explosive that it is difficult not to keep going to the next episode back to back all day long. The human interaction of ""Brotherhood"" is realistically complex which kept me riveted to the series to see how it all would sort out. The last episode of season 3 still keeps me wondering.",1396051200,2,808,4.45945945945946

3460974,5,B001AQMBF0,I like the entire Brotherhood series. I only discovered it a year ago through my Amazon Prime account. I especially like how the series portrays the compromise that is necessary in politics. It really puts a human face on the actions or in-actions of politicians.,1392508800,,263,4.866666666666666

3460999,4,B001AQMBF0,"Good Showtime original series. Season Three, the final year of a three year series, was easily the best. No spoilers here, but some issues were resolved, others weren't...some conclusions drawn from a finale montage...definitely worth the wait of the previous two seasons. As stated in a previous review, Brotherhood depicts a contemporary working class Irish Catholic family from Providence, Rhode Island. The relationship between two brothers, Tommy, a state legislator, and Michael, an organized crime member, provides the dramatic tension which propels the plot lines. Very, very loosely based on the Bulger brothers from Boston. Some excellent  acting, good solid storyline premise...uneven editing, some heavy-handed juxtaposition...basically characters that one becomes interested in...above average entertainment...many contemporary issues and some timeless values are addressed and dealt with through the prism of the Caffee family...doesn't get five stars because - it ain't ""The Wire.""",1390867200,,996,6.0638297872340425

3461001,5,B001AQMBF0,If you are from Rhode Island it's a must see. It's a bit stereotyped but well acted. If you are a Tina Benko fan you will like this show.,1390867200,,137,3.7586206896551726

3461003,4,B001AQMBF0,"Season 3 was disappointing.

3461053,4,B001AQMBF0,I did not like Tommy's submissive role in his job.  I see the plot of the show is too close to real life.  The gangsters and the politicians are all crooks and thugs.  In fact Michael was a better liked character to me than his brother Tommy.  This show sums up just how hopeless society is today.  That makes it sad but true.,1379894400,,326,4.111111111111111

3461058,4,B001AQMBF0,"I love this series and it is loosely based on Whitey Bulger and his brother Billy. Billy was the President of the Massachusetts State Senate and the University of Massachusetts system. Billy is portrayed as Tommy Caffie and his brother Michael is based on Whitey himself. The third season is a bit slow at times but certainly worth watching as characters and plots are constantly developing. If you liked shows such as The Wire, Breaking Bad, and The Shield than you will certainly appreciate Brotherhood.",1376352000,,505,4.952941176470588

3461095,2,B001AQMBF0,"<spoilers...although why someone who is afraid of learning key plot details would read a review of the show let alone one titled like this is beyond me>

I got interested in this series after reading a very good book about the real life Irish-American gangster who inspired ""Brotherhood.""  I'm referring of course to James ""Whitey"" Bulger.  As I note in my title, this series was pretty watchable in its first two seasons because of a very strong performance by the actors playing the two Caffey brothers.

But I felt that by Season 3, the series really started to veer away from what I thought was plausible ...and given the incredible reality of what happened during the real Bulger case, I was surprised they didn't rely on events that we know did happen (albeit fictionalized for this series).  Consider these items and how believable you find them:

1.  Michael Caffey commits about eight or nine murders in a single year.  Whitey Bulger committed about 19 total murders in about 18 years.

2.  Michael Caffey murders an associate US Attorney and we don't see a particularly strong reaction by the police (granted, he ""disappeared"" the body), but I would think that if an AUSA who was working on organized crime cases mysteriously vanished, there would be massive pressure by federal and local law enforcement to find out what would happen and Michael Caffey, his Irish friends, and the local mafia would find themselves under unbelievable pressure.  Consider this:  Whitey Bulger never did anything like that because he knew the heat it would generate.

3.  The idea that Declan would be heading up an investigation into corruption was preposterous.  He had been a drug addict, had witnessed his partner murder an FBI agent, and then stood by and allowed Michael to disappear that corpse as well.  On the witness stand, he would have been destroyed by a competent lawyer.

4.  Eileen suddenly transforms from a coke snorting, pot smoking, vicodin inhaling addict into mother of the year without any difficulties. I would have bought her cleaning up her act some but it would have been a lot more believable if we'd seen her actually attend an AA or Narcotics Anonymous Meeting or maybe even go through some withdrawal pains.

Another thing I don't understand is why the series didn't use some of the same real life plot that made the Bulger case so incredible in real life.  Bulger had at least two FBI agents in his pocket and several more just about there, and he had at least one corrupt local police officer as well.  These men compromised law enforcement investigations and got informants murdered.  But the show used none of that.

So while I can give a recommendation to watch the first two seasons of this show, I can't endorse the third.",1362787200,2,2752,4.808510638297872
3461116,5,B001AQMBF0,Once I started watching this I could not stop.  My only dissapoint is it had to end.  I would issue only one caution however.  It is violent.,1361664000,,141,4.148148148148148

3461121,5,B001AQMBF0,"I'm really on the fence about this one.  I absolutely glommed all three seasons, it was that fantastic. Yet there were a zillion plot holes I was obviously willing to forgive.  They probably didn't have much warning this would be their season finale, so the creator had to come up with a finale that tried to tie loose ends together. I'm still wondering, though.  What happened between Kath and Colin?  Did anyone ever figure out what caused that scar on Michael's back?  Where was he for 7 years?  Did I miss something?  People would change allegiances like billiard balls, just willy-nilly depending seemingly on their mood. One day they're manipulating you to loathe Freddie Cork, then the next ep you can see the writers pulling strings to make him sympathetic again. And I forgave it all because it's SUCH a damned good series.  Jason Isaacs rules.",1345075200,,853,4.794520547945205

3461127,2,B001AQMBF0,"The season and the series as a whole are both very good. My 2 star rating relates only to the finale aspect and the very last episode. Do not listen to those claiming ""closure"" because their is none here.  In five years this season could start again and there would be no problems with inconsistencies.  Nothing happened in the final episode to close events! Things simply ended and the viewers were left hanging and waiting for more. SPOLIER ALERTS from here on!!!

Michael just walks away after murdering 3 people and torturing another. And how come he can kill two people with one shot each but cannot kill Nazzoli with five shots leaving Nazzoli to be up and doing well in the hospital within hours of being shot.
Tommy becomes Speaker after a presumed deal with a mobster to kill a witness?
Rose Caffey's illness was insignificant and useless.
The house on the shore was the same. It's not like Tommy was squeaky clean until then and only tried a deal to leave the state House.
Why was Eileen forced to stay in bed? Stupid plot point.
Colin screws Cath and leaves her in a diner after his puppy dog love for her?  I understand things weren't as they dreamed it would be but simply walking away (like Michael) is not an ending. Neither is Cath returning to her trashed house or her ex-husband hobbling around his job days after being brutally tortured.

I simply don't think the ending got the attention or the respect the rest of the series received and I am very disappointed.",1276387200,6,1482,4.556390977443609
3461128,4,B001AQMBF0,"Another good installment of the Brotherhood trilogy.  The blasphemy and nudity/sex scenes were unnecessary, and frankly, uncomfortable to listen to and watch.  It just didn't do anything for the story and if nothing else, it slowed it down with such detours.  It would have had a much greater sense of drama and intensity without such dialog and diversions.  I hate when writers/producers compromise an otherwise great story/series in this way, rather than utilizing great dialogue to propel the story / action or even no dialogue they stoop to blasphemy and explicit language.  Could have used more interesting shots or hints on what might happen for realism and suspense rather than relying on bad sex scenes / nudity.

A really good trilogy that could have been awesome with some audio and scene editing as noted above.  Otherwise, great cast, believable characters, just enough grit and tension, fast pace, good story and turn of events.  Interesting it was set in Rhode Island - loved the accents.",1275696000,,1002,5.067073170731708

I thought the final season was excellent, it had its drama and action, and we could finally see what people will do to get what they want in life.

It is difficult to be specific as it will become spoilers but we see how the two brothers while being polar opposites in their lifestyles and professions are really so similar.",1268438400,,623,4.408695652173913

Through the series the viewer is always challenged to figure out the motivations of the characters, who is really good, who is really bad.
