6678032,5,B00NT5NR2G,"This is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen! This is not for the faint hearted. If you like horror films, and you like independent films, then ""The Inside"" is for you. Written and directed by Knight of the Round table from ""Merlin"", Eoin Macken (Gwaine), ""The Inside"" captures the night of a group of teenagers celebrating the birthday of one of them. Deciding to celebrate in an empty warehouse before hitting a club, they get more than they bargained for. The filming is done through the eyes of the teenagers - 'Blair Witch Project' style, however don't be expecting anything to be as lame or as tacky. This is one ride you won't expect.",1414540800,2,654,4.5508474576271185
6678033,1,B00NT5NR2G,"Tedious, flailing, found-footage movie about some losers assaulting some girls, and then... a demon? Or something, attacks the lot. Too dark, too much shaky cam, too little actual exploitation... and the video played via Tivo had trouble connecting to a screen (luckily I had a computer monitor that also had HDMI w/hdcp, aside from the TV). This'll be on Netflix or Amazon Prime in a short time I bet: at most, wait till then. Ideally, skip it.",1414108800,8,445,4.792207792207792

6678035,5,B00NT5NR2G,Awesome horror film! Definitely getting my own copy but so scary you should try and watch it withe a friend the way I did. Great addition to any Halloween film playlist,1413849600,,168,4.451612903225806
6678036,5,B00NT5NR2G,"Horror and 'found footage' films are prone to be cliche. The Inside however is refreshingly unique and engaging in its approach to both the genre of horror as well as the sub-type of found footage. Horror films also usually have either evil and violent human interactions, or opt for a supernatural tormentor - The Inside again delivers both and in top quality form.
This film is no ordinary scream-fest. It catapults past every extreme even remotely imaginable and is fully nerve demolishingly terrifying. While it is a violent film, we never actually see the violence taking place, and yet we experience it perhaps even more strongly for not being distracted by viewing the mechanics of any of the terrifying occurrences. Nothing feels as if it was done for shock value in this film, every shocking twist and turn and scream, integral to the experience of the plot for both the characters and the viewers.
The cast's convincing performances are so realistic it is quite surreal to watch. What they brought to life was a brilliantly written, directed, and filmed creation by writer/director/producer/actor Eoin Macken, that brings more than scares and screams, but a lot of thought provoking material that makes us question the depths of humanity, the infinite expanse of the supernatural, and where we fit in... or what we create in it all. A MUST SEE for horror fans and non-horror fans alike.",1413849600,3,1396,4.97008547008547
8679957,2,B00NT5NR2G,"This movie was pretty grotesque, not in the gory way but rather the difficult to keep watching way.  It starts off with  just a plain horrible scenario that terns into a horror flick type of movie.

Unfortunately didn't care about the characters enough to care about what happened  to them",1433203200,,289,4.72

The Inside, AKA ""Stupid Obnoxious People Taking Way Too Long To Die"" is the first Irish horror movie I have not liked. No, let me rephrase that- it is the first I have hated. Not much really going on, so every scene is drrraaaawwwn out way too long. The exploitation has no impact, partly because you do not care about any of the characters, and part because it takes just a few seconds to know exactly how everything will play out. No suspense, no fear, just boredom. The writer tries to make a home break-in and torture movie suddenly become some sort of demonic monster movie, and it fails miserably. Okay- they are kidnapped, they are assaulted, now there are some runes painted on a wall. Wow, I sure am scared. As in every bad horror film, nobody grabs weapons, all characters either freeze or panic- in this case they CONSTANTLY make crying or screaming noises at all times, even when stealth could save their life- they make stupid decision after stupid decision after stupid decision. The funniest scene was when a boyfriend has a weapon (early on in movie) and he drops it because the three rapists promise him nobody will be hurt if he complies. Then (of course) he is beaten to a pulp and apparently he was full of raspberry jelly the whole time (kudos for using tasty condiments in place of fake blood). Someone gets away, for no reason drops the camera (which is her only evidence), a guy walking by picks it up, does not turn it in to anyone who could help, but retraces their steps and attempts to rescue a female or two with no assistance and despite all he has seen on the camera. The end is as inexcusable as the rest of this mess; a person who is comatose most of the movie suddenly lashes out at the person who is obviously there to help, striking him with a rock in the head; she escapes, and I guess he is dead. Seen this same nonsensical stupidity far too many times in bad horror, and it is just keeps getting worse every time a lazy writer uses this trope. Watch this movie if you like lots of film padding, very poor writing, and seeing things you have seen before many, many times in far better films.",1431820800,,2148,4.424242424242424
8679959,1,B00NT5NR2G,OK if you enjoy the camcorder point of view,1428105600,,43,3.888888888888889
8679960,3,B00NT5NR2G,"Not bad for B-movie style horror. The acting was bearable as the scenes began to pick up pace very fast. The Only thing that was irritating was the shaky hand held camera style which I felt was a bit overdone. It actually gave me a headache trying to keep up with the movements, if you can handle that than the rest is just left to enjoy.",1421884800,,338,4.136363636363637
8679961,1,B00NT5NR2G,"The brightest and least annoying character in this movie is the disembodied baby voice. I'd like to join one of the more articulate cast members in saying ""No no no no no no no please no"".",1420502400,,188,4.25

8679964,1,B00NT5NR2G,What the hell?!?  I'm a big fan of the found footage genre but this was bad. The audio was terrible and I could not understand what the hell was going on. Wait until it's free!!!!!,1415577600,,180,4.142857142857143
8679965,4,B00NT5NR2G,"When it comes to found-footage horror, I'm pretty positive. I think it really is the sub-genre most appropriate to where our culture is right now. Even more than that, I love movies that are explorations of weird, derelict spaces, such as Evil Dead Trap, Dark Feed, Session 9, etc.
Spoilers follow.
If you need everything explained to you, this is not the movie you want to watch. It begins when a band of girls and one guy choose unwisely to hold a party in an old, abandoned space. But the space is not abandoned. There are some truly evil thugs living in there who have nothing on their minds but rape and brutality...and there is also some sort of demonic force. Satanic sigils are scrawled on the walls of a stairwell. But by the time our heroines discover this, it's way too late.
I liked the camerawork and the intense acting in this movie. You really get a feel for what the characters are like in the extended party sequence that happens before the evil vagrants show up.
This movie was time well spent.",1415232000,4,1012,4.505434782608695
8679966,4,B00NT5NR2G,"I have to start off this review by stating THE INSIDE is a nice surprise.  Because of its premise, I wanted it to be good.  I buy movies from pawn shops on a frequent basis, and therefore Im familiar with what many of them sell.  As Ive perused the stores, Ive sometimes wondered if the owners ever find forgotten video tapes inside of video cameras or forgotten DVDs inside of DVD players.  Director Eoin Macken uses this premise and sends the viewer on a nightmarish ride into hell.  The result is a wicked and intense movie experience that is both haunting and satisfying.

I do have to give a warning about this film, however:  most of it is shot in first-person POV from a handheld camera.  Because of this, there are many shaky and dizzying shots.  People who became motion-sick from movies like CLOVERFIELD and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT will probably want to stay away from this film.

THE INSIDE is well made overall, and looks great from a production standpoint.  It is actually a hybrid movie, in that it combines found-footage with actual third-person POV shots.  I like this aspect, as it allows you to immerse yourself in what is going onbut it also lets you take a breather every once in a while when the intensity gets too amped up.

And speaking of intense, this film does not let up.  It takes a few minutes for the plot to unfold, but when it does, youd better buckle your seatbelt.  When things start to happen, they move at a shotgun blast pace.  I particularly like how linear everything is; there are no flashbacks or pauses for reflection.  When the proverbial crap hits the fan, the viewer is held spellbound until the credits start to roll.

The acting in THE INSIDE is very good as well.  I hate to admit I do not recognize any names in the cast list, but I will wager they will definitely do well in future endeavors.  Likewise, the special effects are pretty good, too, although there are not many of them.

If I were forced to find a flaw with THE INSIDE, I would have to say the lack of explanation for the supernatural aspects disappoints me a bit.  Its nothing at all that detracts from the film for the most part, however I, personally, would have liked a little more meat in this area.

Still, THE INSIDE is hell of a thrill ride, and horror fans should give this one a look soon.  I will be hosting a giveaway for a DVD copy of this film as well, so be sure and check that out after you finish reading this review.  Otherwise, the film is available now in a variety of formats.",1414972800,3,2510,4.416122004357298
