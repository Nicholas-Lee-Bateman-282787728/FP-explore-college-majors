This is quotes film from the 1930s that also stars Robert Young, later of Father Knows Best and Marcus Selby, M.D.  They were in several films together and this was one of the better ones. No special features other than the trailer.",1504569600,,272,4.666666666666667
8512972,5,B0079R1MA4,"I'm a fan of old movies, and this one is my favorite. Joan Crawford is wild and wonderful, and a perfect match for Robert Montgomery. He refuses to court her until he can provide for her, and he sticks to that until something quite shocking happens in the end. It's hilarious to think of the outcome of something similar happening in this day and age, but this is one of those fateful old fashioned romances just crazy enough to work.",1501632000,,434,4.4375
8512973,5,B0079R1MA4,Robert Montgomery and Joan Crawford were a great team on screen.  This early film of theirs is excellent.,1436054400,2,105,4.833333333333333
8512974,2,B0079R1MA4,"The story is trite. The acting is overwrought. The dialogue is clich.

So why watch this?

For me, it was an opportunity to see the earliest made ""talkie"" I'd ever experienced ... the first from the decade of the 20s. This is pre-crash and only two years after ""The Jazz Singer"" broke the ground. Remarkably, many film-makers and actors were still leaning HEAVILY on their old habits from the Silent Screen. Note the use of cards between some scenes to describe the plot's progression.

Joan Crawford is unrecognizable in this film ... she's actually pretty! LOL Her acting also reeks of a VERY slow transition in understanding the difference between her early performances in Silent and this new-fangled Talkie stuff. The physical over-emoting is literally comical. She constantly rolls her eyes up so that you can only see the whites. She alternates between vicious attack and cooing sweetness ... sometimes from line to line. How she survived this performance to become the major star we know is a mystery. Particularly watch how Crawford constantly rolls her eyes up as she sings, sort of in rhythm to the music. LOL

Robert Montgomery is actually pretty good here. Having started in film more recently than Crawford, he evidently had no ""silent baggage"" to overcome. Therefore his performance is more relaxed, smooth, and ""normal"" in appearance.

The boxing scene is especially comical. This was YEARS before techniques were created to make stunt-fighting look realistic (and from what I understand many of those techniques were innovated by John Wayne and friends). Punches that miss by inches floor and cut the other guy. It really is pathetic.

So if you expect a riveting movie when you watch this, you'll be disappointed. If you watch it to observe a prime example of the transition from Silent to Talkie, you could be quite entertained.

Cautiously recommended as noted above.",1388707200,6,1887,5.028846153846154

8512976,5,B0079R1MA4,"At least I'm sure I will love it, since Crawford  and Robert Montgomery are two of my favorite actors. I'm waiting to watch it with my granddaughter who also likes watching classic movies.  It arrived fast and in great condition.",1363737600,3,229,4.7
