2 Disc set In Your House 17 & 18
This is a blind buy that actually surprised the hell out of me
I've never heard of this distribution company
Both disc are in PAL format
So you must have a region free player to view them
i only watched the first disc (In Your House) Ground Zero
this PPV is from September 7, 1997 which is crazy it's almost 20 years old
Good Lord that makes me feel so old
The break down of this set
Why these are so unbelievable
The first disc is uncut (I'm pretty sure the footage is from the raw PPV Masters
Nothing is edited or cut out you have the WWF Logo everywhere
The footage is also crisp and clean it could easily pass for a HD 720p (It looks really good) I'm shocked
The audio on the other hand is 1997 it's dolby digital Stereo
That's the only real negative about the first disc
Onto my thoughts on In Your House: Ground Zero which took place at the infamous
 Louisville Gardens in Louisville, Kentucky. (Packed house) with fans from 9 to 70 this is during the Monday Night war when Pro Wrestling was a legit huge money maker

Matches
1) Goldust vs Brain Pillman  (Indecent Proposal Match) I'm pretty sure this is the last PPV Brain Pillman would be involved in
This feud/program was meant to build Pillman as a Main event draw after the Goldust feud The WWF Heavy weight title was going to be put on Pillman  but, Pillman passed away a month later
This is just a interesting match looking back at it now Pillman was super over as a heel and the crowd wanted his head
The angle was edgy or unique for this time the WWF wasn't full blown Attitude Era yet  4/5 Stars

2) Scott Putski vs Brian Christopher (This was the USWA's Brain Christopher not the comedy gimmick he would later be given
 This too is interesting and brought back memories how great Brain was as a heel the WWF/WWE lost sight of his strengths when they re-branded him Too Sexy  2/5 Stars

3)Savio Vega vs Faarooq vs Crush  (Triple Threat match)  This was WWF trying to mimic the ECW Triple threat matches a bit poorly
Guys that big don't do these types of matches good at all
This is a great example that WWF didn't know what to do with guys like Ron Simmons he was super over in WCW but, when he went to work for McMahon they buried him and discounted everything he did in the past  2.5/5 Stars

4) Max Mini vs  El Torito  (Interesting to see this type of match the WWE would never do this now)
very fast light comedy match  5/5 Stars

5)The Godwinns vs The Headbangers  vs The legion of Doom vs Owen Hart and The British Bulldog. (Fatal Four Way Elimination Match for the WWF Tag team straps
Interesting match seeing Legion of Doom being jobbed-out was a bit sad what's more sad 3 out of the 8 wrestlers are no longer with us
None the less it's a solid tag team elimination match  4/5

6) The Patriot vs Bret ""Hitman"" Hart  (WWF World Heavy weight title matches)  This is a solid match by both men
The Patriot was under used and used poorly the dude could go and was a huge star in Japan
He was only brought in as  the ""American"" Face  vs Bret being anti-American heel  (The two work well together 5/5 Stars

7) The main event
The first time ever! Shawn Michaels vs The Undertaker
Despite how much i loath Michaels as a human being this match is incredible both men pull out all the stops  5 Star match **Must See**

In Your House 18 Bad Blood
 took place on October 5, 1997, at the Kiel Center in St. Louis, Missouri.
This PPV holds a special place in my heart i was there in terrible seats but, it was still
fun and during a much different time for Pro Wrestling and the fans!

The story line between Brain Pillman and Goldust and his then real wife
would be cut short due to Brain Pillman's death
So the Dude Love vs Brain Pillman match was replaced

1)  The Nation of Domination vs  The Legion of Doom  (Three-on-two handicap match) slow opening match once again having one of the most over-tag teams of the 1980's being jobbed-out is a bit sad  2/5 Stars

2)Max Mini and Nova vs Tarantula and Mosaic  (Replacement match very enjoyable Lucha Libra style fast ""mini match""  5/5 Stars

3. The Godwinns vs The Headbangers  (Tag team match for the WWF Tag Team Championship) average match also forgettable 2/5 Stars

4)Owen Hart vs Faarooq  (Singles match for the vacant WWF Intercontinental Championship)  horrible booking this could've been a solid 5 Star match but, they were given very little to no time  3/5 Stars

5) The Disciples of Apocalypse  (aka 3/4 Original ECW guys) vs Los Boricuas  (Eight-man tag team match)
The Bruise Brothers + Brain Lee know how to work chaotic matches like this
This match could've been a standout match between former ECW Stars vs Puerto Rico/Japanese Stars
Poor booking and very watered down I'm sure a certain HBK couldn't be out shined by anyone else on this card  3/5 Stars

6)Bret Hart and The British Bulldog vs Vader and The Patriot  (USA vs Canada Flag match) for a gimmick flag match it's extremely good
mostly due to having four guys that work off each other....  4/5 Stars
This is the last time The Patriot would be on a WWF PPV which is a real shame since the man was a legit star
But, the WWF never understood talent that could put themselves over in any other company

7)Shawn Michaels vs  The Undertaker  ( Hell in a Cell match) This is the first Hell in a Cell match while even then wasn't anything new since these types of matches were done previously in NWA, FMW, and handful of Global promotions
It's a insane and underrated cage match it's the closest thing to a FMW style cage match it's very brutal and the pacing was just right
Both Michaels and The Undertaker leave everything in the ring!  5/5 Star match **Must See**
Much like the first disc this second disc is also uncut with excellent PQ  9/10

You can see some of these matches on the Network but, they will be edited
This two disc set is a very cool time capsule when the WWF actually tried and had major competition with WCW and ECW
This was a much better WWF now in 2016 the WWE is a horrible joke
It's a public traded company that cares about Entertainment not Pro Wrestling

These two disc set is a must have for long time fans that wanna see the real WWF uncut and uncensored  9/10",1461024000,,6247,4.339948231233822
