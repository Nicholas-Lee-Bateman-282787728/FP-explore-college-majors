2451503,4,B000C1V880,"This performance, dating from 1973, features a cast of excellent English singers. Ben Luxon and Janet Baker are the leading characters and both have fine voices and polished artistry.  The accompaniment is not as lean, thanks to Mr. Leppard's edition, as more modern representations but it is not as unbearable as another reviewer has indicated.  One positive thing about the production is it's simplicity and directness.  There is no attempt to liven up the action having the singers lurch about between each phrase.  Monteverdi's operas are very static and many stage directors seem to fall all over themselves to disguise this fact.  After a few viewings, this becomes annoying and ceases to serve the purpose for which it was intended. One can carp about a lack of authenticity (do we really know what that was in Monteverdi's time?) or just enjoy the production for what is does deliver.  Not being a native speaker of Italian I find that several hours of recitative does not hold my interest.  The cuts in this opera are welcome.",1214006400,5,1035,4.913793103448276
2451504,1,B000C1V880,"Dear God....

What a HORRIBLE production!!!!!!!  Although I have always been a fan of early music and a stickler for authentic performance practise, I have never poo-pooed modern instrument productions by Leppard, as they are (usually) musically enjoyable just the same.  Not so for this recording!  Although there are moments of beautiful string playing, most of the opera is accompanied recatitive.  Unfortunately, the accompaniment seems to consist only of a poorly reconstructed, clangy sounding harpsichord that sounds more like a construction site than a musical instrument, a strange organ that almost sounds synthesized (think scooby doo background music), and an entire section of cellos and basses with strange timbres and vibrato so wide it seems to fluctuate in octaves.  Occasionally, one or two harps will chime in, playing rolling chords that have very little to do with the harmonic progression of the vocal line.  BAD BAD BAD!!!!  If Monteverdi had been living in 1979 to hear this, he would have had a heart attack!  It resembles more the audacious Henze production from the '80s than Leppard's other realizations (which are okay).  I only recommend this DVD as an introduction to Monteverdi for Hippies. Otherwise, you will do well to buy any other DVD of this opera.  My favorite is the 2002 William Christie Production.  In short, do not buy this if you want to hear music written by the composer listed on the fromt cover of this DVD.",1178668800,4,1456,5.071428571428571
8095054,5,B000C1V880,"I was not at all familiar with this opera before viewing it but was familiar with The Odyssey, a story I've loved since high school English class, so I took a chance. At first I found the production very odd - the opening scene made me think I'd made a terrible mistake with its sparse stage, tacky props, and singers dropping from the ceiling like flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz. It seemed rather amateurish (and quite dated). But once Janet Baker and Benjamin Luxon took the stage, I was hooked. Their singing is fantastic - strong, passionate and resonant, and their facial expressions perfectly convey their emotions. The costumes were also wonderful, and the music glorious. I found it odd that the conductor and audience were never shown, nor do we get to see the performers take their bows. Based on the tepid applause, I'd have to guess the crowd was pretty small, or half asleep, for these performers surely deserved a greater ovation. Aside from these minor gripes, I was very pleased with this opera and this performance. I would recommend it to anyone who loves fine singing, early music, or the Ulysses story. I am now an admiring fan of Monteverdi and of both lead singers. Hang in there after the quirky prologue and you're in for a treat.",1518912000,,1258,4.645739910313901
8095055,5,B000C1V880,This performance of Dame Janet Baker is a feast for the soul. She is a treasure to be re-discovered,1487116800,,99,4.2631578947368425

8095057,5,B000C1V880,"I bought a VHS version of this production way back when and immediately loved it.  As I was updating my opera video collection, I decided to buy the DVD edition.  I still love it (non-authentic realization by Leppard notwithstanding).  There's really not a weak link in the cast, with both principals (Baker and Luxon) truly outstanding.  Though the staging is what nowadays is viewed as old-fashioned, that's my preferred mode.

There are a few things about the video itself, however, that any potential buyer should be aware of:  (1) The English subtitles at times are truly risible.  (2) The aspect ratio of the actual picture is confusing.  Although nominally in the then standard 4:3 aspect ratio, whatever camera equipment that was used to film the performance causes the viewed picture to be laterally distorted.  I started out viewing the DVD in ""standard"" video mode, but this all too often resulted in a laterally ""squeezed"" picture.  When viewing it in ""stretched"" video mode, there was periodic lateral distortion (a too-wide view), but that proved to be the best compromise for my taste.  (Note that this effect was also true of the original VHS video.)  (3) Whoever was responsible for transferring the original video to DVD format went a bit overboard in upping the contrast levels of the picture, which at times makes it look garish.

Finally, potential buyers should be aware that most of the ""comic-relief"" scenes in the full score were cut out of this production.",1407888000,4,1482,4.975609756097561
8095058,5,B000C1V880,"Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria is marvelous production of this opera.  The singers are what really make it come alive.  Mezzo, Janet Baker as Penelope, is in fine voice throughout.  Baritone, Benjamin Luxon as Ulysses, has such exquisite beauty of tone that he defies description.  We're so lucky to have recordings available by Luxon, whose career was cut short in the early 90s by a profound hearing loss.  He's one of the greatest baritones, ever.  The sets and costumes work well in the production, too.  If you love opera, please give yourself a treat and purchase this DVD.",1272412800,2,578,4.836734693877551
8095059,5,B000C1V880,"The Iliad and the Odyssey were the inspiration for many Baroque composers. Monteverdi uses the Odyssey to turn around Ulysses home to an opera. Reportedly, this return home took ten years and thus adding to the ten-year Trojan War, the hero has been out for twenty years. Long was waiting for his wife Penelope, who was on crack and still had to put up a bunch of crooks wanting to usurp the kingdom.
  Musically, Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria following baroque features: bass, recitatives and arias slow. Opera long, slow rhythm that makes his complicated scenario today. There are several versions on the market. I highlight two: that of Hans Werner Henze to Salzburg Festival (1985) and Pierre Audi for the Netherlands Opera (1998).
  The production of the Salzburg Festival opts for a full version, traditional costumes, and loaded a static scenario. Singers quality, Thomas Allen is superb as Ulysses, and Kathleen Khulmann Penelope makes a passionate and emotional. Orchestration right direction and one that is in the trivial, the story objectively, going straight to the point.
  Pierre Audi is a different reading. He wipes the story, cut scenes it deems unnecessary. I am against this procedure. The work must be performed in full, as conceived by the librettist and composer. I admit that the idea brought dynamic. His scenes are lightweight, minimalist, its light takes part in the scenic element, its moves toward the crowd. Costumes modern, bold, timeless. Print speed of a baroque opera, slow by nature. The soloists are outstanding, highlights for Brian Asawa and Penelope, Graciela Araya. Period instruments often sound strange to the ears of today, but the quest to reconstruct the original sound is very interesting - and often boring.
  Two versions that print different styles to the same opera. One follows the traditional rice and beans and chips, classic. Other resources employs modern theater, fungi risotto with red wine, innovative. It shows the viewer of developments in opera, singing with a few scenic resources was the theater, where the voice is one of the elements and not the principal. You choose your path.

Portuguese

 A Ilada e a Odissia serviram de inspirao para muitos compositores barrocos. Monteverdi utiliza a Odissia para transformar a volta de Ulisses para casa em uma pera. Segundo consta, esse retorno ao lar demorou dez anos e assim, somando-se aos dez anos da guerra de Tria, o heri ficou fora por vinte anos. Longa foi a espera de sua esposa Penlope, que ficou na fissura e ainda teve que aturar um bando de malandros querendo lhe usurpar o reino.
  Musicalmente,  Il Ritorno D'Ulissis in Patria segue caractersticas barrocas:  baixo contnuo, recitativos e rias lentas. pera de longa durao, de ritmo lento que torna sua encenao complicada nos dias de hoje. Existem vrias verses no mercado. Destaco duas:  a de Hans Werner Henze para Salzburg Festival (1985) e a de Pierre Audi para a Netherlands Opera (1998).
  A produo do Salzburg Festival opta por uma verso completa, figurinos tradicionais, carregados e uma encenao esttica. Cantores de qualidade, Thomas Allen est soberbo como Ulisses, e Kathleen Khulmann faz uma Penlope apaixonada e emotiva. Orquestrao correta  e uma direo que fica no trivial, conta a histria com objetividade, indo direto ao ponto.
  Pierre Audi faz uma leitura diferenciada. Enxuga a histria, corta cenas que julga desnecessrias. Sou contra esse procedimento. A obra deve ser encenada na ntegra, como foi pensada pelo libretista e pelo compositor.  Admito que a idia trouxe dinmica. Seus cenrios so leves, minimalistas, sua luz participa do elemento cnico, sua direo movimenta a galera. Figurinos modernos, arrojados, atemporais. Imprime agilidade a uma pera barroca, lenta por natureza. Os solistas so exmios, destaques para Brian Asawa e a Penlope de Graciela Araya. Instrumentos de poca soam muitas vezes estranhos aos ouvidos de hoje, mas a busca de reconstituir a sonoridade original  deveras interessante - e muitas vezes chata.
  Duas verses que imprimem estilos diferentes a uma mesma pera. Uma segue o tradicional, arroz e feijo com fritas, clssica. Outra emprega recursos modernos de teatro, risoto de fungi com vinho tinto, inovadora. Mostra ao espectador a evoluo na pera, de canto com poucos recursos cnicos  era do teatro, onde a voz  um dos elementos e no o principal. Voc escolhe seu caminho.",1268006400,2,4387,5.133614627285513
8095060,5,B000C1V880,"I never saw 'Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria' live but was fortunate to see it in a live television performance and, at long last, have a copy of the DVD, courtesy of Amazon. The recording is presumably a video or even film of a live production of the Opera given at Glyndbourne during the 1970s when Raymond Leppard and Peter Hall conspired to recreate something which gave a flavour of early opera, in terms of music, drama, stage machinery and costumes of the period. However, beyond the mechanics is a performance by Janet Baker and Benjamin Luxon which brings to life a vibrant slice of life, a near tragedy, great longing, revenge and, ultimately, reconcilliation.

The story os simple, after ten years Ulisses returns to his homeland. Recognised by his old retainer and later his son Telemachus, he is advised by Minerva to be cunning and disguises him as a beggar because his wife, the faithful Penelope, is in great danger from the attentions of rival suitors who wish to marry her in order to ravage Ulisses kingdom by their greed. In disguise Ulisses arrives at his palace when the suitors have made it plain that Penelope may no longer prevaricate and must choose between them. Inspired by Minerva, she says she will accept anyone who is able to shoot Ulisses' bow. The suitors try but all fail and the beggar Ulisses asks to try. He strings the bow with ease and kills the suitors and conspiritors. Thus he has doubly won Penelope - by faithful love and victory of arms. At first Penelope is shocked and confused, even when Ulisses is returnedto his own form by Minerva butgradually persuades her it is he by describing the coverlet on her bed which she had woven, depicting chaste Diana, which only he could have seen.

The opera is about longing, loss and reconcilliation but it is the power and beauty of Baker's voice, truthful, powerful and subtle which is the focus. She underplays the drama, touches the soul with her voice, her majestic presence, a public and confiding voice draws the viewer-listener to share her anguish, dread and longing. Luxon's voice is at his best, assured, bell-like and seductive. His duets with Minerva, Telemachus and the old retainer are joyous and mirror Baker's twists of mood. It is, however, the final act, with the stage empty of all but Ulisses and Penelope, he on the far right she far left,that the drama reaches its natural, human and dramatic conclusion; recognition, (signalled by the 'ting' of a cymbal,) a gradual moving together and finally they embrace and sing the most bitter-sweet duet not heard again until the Count and Countess Almaviva reconcilliation duet written by Mozart in last Act of the Marriage of Figaro. It is only as an afterthought that one realises that the ending is a conclusion, a resolution but also a beginning...",1252627200,7,2801,4.797101449275362
8095061,5,B000C1V880,"This past week a DVD arrived of a performance I'd not seen in more than 25 years: the 1973 Peter Hall production of ""Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria"" from Glyndebourne with Dame Janet Baker and Benjamin Luxon. This is, of course, the much loathed, highly criticized realization by Raymond Leppard which sends purists running to the hills screaming ""Blasphemy!"" Too bad because it is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful scores I've ever heard.

I first fell in love with this version in the beautiful set from Columbia from 1978 with the incandescent Penelope of Frederica von Stade and the warm, masculine Ulisse of Richard Stilwell . . . one of his finest roles. (The cover of that set remains one of my favorites). I still own the LPs (but don't have a turntable . . . something I hope to remedy this summer), so have not listened in years to it. The first time I heard it, I played it all over again - and did so - or at least great chunks of it - every time I played it, and it is one of those performances I find snatches of playing in my head without prompting.

As soon the performance begain, my face lit up, the (then) new arrangement of centuries old music springing to life in orchestrations both lean and spare, the full batter of the London Philharmonic's strings sawing with life through those opening measures - it takes my breath away.

Sir Peter's direction is flawless here, surely one of his finest moments. The Prologue, with the completely naked Annabelle Hunt as L'Humana Fragilta alone on stage, her torments being issued forth from the gods, who all arrive descending from the heavens gets things off to a really good start (though I prefer the tradition of Human Frailty being performed by the same singer as Ulisse). As L'Humana Fragilta descends into ornate, raised stage floor via elevator, the stage goes dark, with only the gods being lit as they ascend back to the heavens, and when the lights dim back on, there stands the forlornly stoic queen Penelope, in one of those quiet miracles of theatre.

Dame Janet begins the great, long aria ""Di Misera Regina"" and oh, my . . . I'm lost. Wrapped in an enormous robe, her arms immobile as a statue. Her singing is of such delicate, exquisiteness, her pointing up of the text, wed to the emotions of the score is heartbreaking. By her first ""Torna, torna"" I could not keep my eyes from flooding. Slowly the stage becomes active with her court taking their places behind her. As the aria turns hopeful near its end, servants remove the robe and help Penelope into a stunningly simple baroque frock and Penelope softens both in voice and demeanor for the section beginning ""Torna tranquila al mare."" Then, that final whispered cry of ""Torna, torna, o torna, torna Ulisse"" as she plunges back into despair, oh my. I'm blathering here for there are no words to adequately describe how exquisite a performance Dame Janet turns in. Both she, and von Stade win the laurel wreath for this moment, yet to be unmatched by any other Penelope I've experienced in any edition.

Benjamin Luxon makes a most worthy partner, manly, tortured, ever projecting the great leader Ulisse, even when at his most vulnerable. When first getting to know this opera, I was always amazed at the great love story at its center - yet its two protagonists live almost separate arcs for hours until their touching reunion. The libretto is quite simply a masterpiece and a great example of converting a work of great literature into great stage drama.

For me, one of the chief glories of Leppard's adaptation is his unorthodox way, not only with the score, but of setting music to portions of the libretto for which no music has ever been found. The best example of this is in the scene between Telemaco and Penelope, ending with the Queen's aria ""Debole fil di speme."" No edition but Leppard's has this aria, and I remember being fascinated to find that Leppard himself wrote the aria, the melody based on one of Monteverdi's more obscure madrigals. No offense to Monteverdi, but this is, for me, one of the most beautiful moments in all of opera and authenticity be damned, it is a powerful, heart stopping moment as the Queen again softens and nervously, cautiously tries to believe her son is telling the truth, but she daren't hope so.

The staging and pacing of the final duet, for me, puts to shame every other production, and the simplicity of its ending, Penelope and Ulisse leaning their heads forward, barely touching each other as the lights dim after their final ""Si, si mio core, si si, si si."" finds me a blubbering wet mess from the sheer beauty of the moment. The Glyndebourne audience sits in rapt silence for about 11 seconds (yes, I counted) before cheering. They knew.

The choruses, the magnificent costumes, the baroque stage effects, the singing, the playing of all of those ancient instruments blending in seamlessly with a full modern symphony - all of it comes together for me in a way that few performances of this opera can or have so far.

Obsessor that I am, I ended up pulling out the other four DVDs of ""Ulisse"" and began watching them all, throughout the week, returning to the 73 Glyndebourne after certain scenes to compare, including Henze's wild ride with the score for the Salzburg Festival, with marvelous performances from Kathleen Kuhlmann and Thomas Allen in a truly spectacular staging.

The one that has always moved me the least is the Harnoncourt/Ponnelle film which, for my money, never quite gets anything ""right"" - though certain images are indeed beautiful, the sound never seems to be coming from the lip-synching singers, and its over done ""high baroque"" sets, costumes - and the most unsatisfactorily staged ending of ANY opera I've seen, is (for me) almost painful.

The Christie led performance from the Aix Festival runs a close second to the less authentically Monteverdian Glyndebourne with stunning performances and a fascinating staging by Adrian Noble.

The Zurich production - with Harnoncourt giving yet another revision to the score, is musically interesting, but I loathe the production which looks like a touring production of ""Mama Mia"" - and that butt ugly little Greek house with its human face of a window is simply ghastly. Vesselina Kasarova, a singer I like in many other roles, is just too bitter and bossy, and dark of tone to make me feel for her Penelope.

Though I've always longed for a video of von Stade and Stilwell in the Peter Hall production, I'll gladly make due with the old LP set (which I hope to transfer soon) and this beautiful, beautiful performance by Dame Janet and Benjamin Luxon. If you're a purist, you may find it deplorable, but if you just let it - you may be surprised at how this show can just take you away. It certainly did me.",1245888000,17,6781,4.697811447811448
8095062,5,B000C1V880,"This is a simply wonderful performance of one of my favorite composers, Monteverdi.  The production was the production...it was fine, it was somewhat dated, but fine....but the performance was outstanding.  That final scene of Baker and Luxon sends chills up my spine every time I view and hear it.  I love period pieces done with period instruments, but I also love period pieces done with the most advanced instruments our ears have experienced.  They both have their merit.  But period or non-period,... the performance, singing and interpretation are the goal posts of excellence and they certainly have achieved that post.",1234828800,10,627,5.23
