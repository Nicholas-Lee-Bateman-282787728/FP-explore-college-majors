2455535,3,B000CC1TQ0,"This is a fun collection of B (or C class) film mysteries with stars you'll have fun watching before they became big names.  The only problem is that the quality of the movies is rather poor due to the condition they were remastered from--these aren't (with a few exceptions) clear digitized and remastered films; they can be grainy, hard to hear and somewhat in disrepair (there is a disclosure statement at the beginning of each film stating this).  So if you just want to see the movies because you're a film buff or curious about bygone cinema, this might be a product for you.  If you're persnickity about quality, pass it by.",1354147200,10,631,4.616071428571429
2455536,5,B000CC1TQ0,These movies bring back a time when they knew how to act.  Great old firm stars and great movies.  Sometimes b/w movies have something that the new color movies never have. Enjoyed very much.,1336780800,,191,4.588235294117647
2455537,5,B000CC1TQ0,"My husband and I bought this whole series and are enjoying them very much!  We live in a remote area of Alaska and don't have cable or streaming video.  So, we find these a very nice way to spend a relaxing evening cuddeling together on the couch!  (And, since there is nothing offensive in them, we find that we aren't constantly jumping up and forwarding to the next scene!  Come on Hollywood.  Somethings are just private!)",1310083200,11,426,4.552631578947368
2455538,4,B000CC1TQ0,"Chick Chandler, Bela Lugosi, and Lloyd Bridges were good in these movies.  I was a pleasure to see Lugosi in something besides a horror movie.  The sound and picture were good.  Very entertaining for a small price with no worry of bad language or lewd portions of the movie.",1211846400,20,274,4.551020408163265

2455540,4,B000CC1TQ0,See my former reviews regarding the mystery classics. I recommend anyone who loves old movie classics to buy these.,1417392000,,115,5.105263157894737

2455542,3,B000CC1TQ0,"IT IS SAD TO SEE CHICK CHANDLER GET THE LEAD ROLE IN ANY MOVIE. THE SOUND WAS SO BAD; IT SOUNDED AS IF CHANDLER WAS DOUBLE TALKING. I SAW 15 OR 20 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE; BOMO RATING.

I REMEMBER MR LUGOSI IN CHANDU AS A BOY; TO ME HE IS THE MASTER OF HORROR FILMS. BUT DUE TO AGE OF THE FILM THE LIGHTING WAS BAD AND SOME OF MATERIAL MISSING FROM WHAT I REMEMBER BUT STILL IT IS A FILM OF GREAT PRICE. I GIVE THE FILM A 2 AND A HALF; BUT BELA GETS A 3 AND A HALF JUST BECAUSE OF WHO HE IS...

TRAPPED IS A DECENT FILM: STORY IS ONE I LIKED. CLEAN CUT, WELL GROOMED AND MR SEAHUNT GOODY TWO SHOES BECOMES A BAD GUY. UNUSUAL ROLE FOR HIM; HE GETS A 3. BARBARA PAYTON GETS A 10 BECAUSE SHE WAS BIG TIME BACK IN THOSE DAYS. IT WAS GREAT TO SEE JOHN HOYT PLAY A GOOD GUY FOR A CHANGE AND HE OUTSHINED LLOYD BRIDGES IN HIS CHARACTER BY FAR. HE GETS A 4... THE MOVIE GETS A 4 STAR PERIOD...

NOW I COME TO THE BETTER OF THE 4 FLICKS. THE BOY JOCKEY, EX HARD NOSED TEEN  AND ALMOST A GROWN UP IS TRYING TO MAKE TIME WITH A REAL WOMAN; MARJORIE REYNOLDS. HE DOESN'T DO BADLY AT ALL; AND IS A HOT SHOT DETECTIVE OF SORTS AND FUNNY. THE HIGH LIGHT OF THE WHO MOVIE IS MANTAN MORELAND; HE CAN MAKE A ROTTEN MOVIE LOOK GOOD WITH HIS COMICAL ANTICS. THE BEST PART IS MANTAN & DARRO DOING THEIR DOUBLE TALK ROUTINE ON STAGE FOR FUN. THE MOVIE AND ANTICS GET A 5 STAR RATING...",1399248000,3,1360,3.76140350877193
2455543,5,B000CC1TQ0,"Mystery Classics are usually movies from the 30s and 40s. They've been improved, but occasionally a flaw will show itself. I like the old movies because they are well acted, don't depend on CGI to build the story, and blood is almost non-existant in most of the films. Most of the films are easy to watch and allow the viewer to let their imaginations out for some exercise. These films are good for the entire family. They don't contain bad language, adult scenes, or gratuitous violence. Actually, most of the violence takes place off stage or in shadow. I can recommend all the Mystery Classics collections since I have most of them.",1395705600,5,636,4.6875
2455544,5,B000CC1TQ0,Mystery classics was a great purchase for the price. The pictures were very clear and the sound was very good. A great buy at a good price.,1392595200,,139,4.185185185185185
2455545,4,B000CC1TQ0,Nice collection of movies for the price. This is number 10 of a collection. With collection 1 through 10 you will great classic movies. Picture quality and sound is very good.,1384646400,,175,4.67741935483871
2455546,4,B000CC1TQ0,"I have the same review for all the volumes. Being a compilation some moves are good, some not so good. Print quality varies from movie to movie. Good value and entertaining.",1383091200,,173,4.612903225806452
2455547,5,B000CC1TQ0,"These movies are great. It isn't too much more that can be said. Since I have been ordering them, I just keep looking to find the ones that I don't have. Anyone who really loves mystery movies from the past will love these.",1368835200,,223,4.209302325581396
2455548,5,B000CC1TQ0,We like the older black and white films. The movies bundled together are great buys. The plus side is all the actors and actresses that are not around anymore that you get to see.,1360281600,,179,4.294117647058823
8096849,2,B000CC1TQ0,"These were some of the crappiest mystery movies I've ever seen. Especially the one with Bela Lugosi.

I semi liked the one with Lloyd Bridges.

I hope I'm not mixing this set of 4 with another. I liked the set of 4 that included William Powell & one with Lloyd Bridges.",1522800000,,269,4.254901960784314

8096852,4,B000CC1TQ0,"Good old movies, enjoyed all four, but picture quality generally bad. Definitely a recommend for old movie fans but only at a discount price. ""Trapped"" is a good noir from the great era of classic noir. ""Up in the Air"" is a delight, with a talented cast- Marjorie Reynolds shines.",1445990400,,280,4.62
8096853,4,B000CC1TQ0,Mildly interesting films from very poor quality prints.  Some films are pretty good and some are laughable.  Echo Bridge Home Entertainment (ebhe.com) has them cheaper than Amazon.,1435363200,,180,5.62962962962963
8096854,5,B000CC1TQ0,"These Mystery Classics are the highest quality films.  Four films:  Chandu on Magic Island, starring Bela Lugosi; Trapped, starring Lloyd Bridges; Circumstantial Evidence, starring Chick Chandler; and Up in the Air, starring Frankie Darro.  The clarity and sound are supreme: like you're right there.  Fabulous!!!!",1432166400,,314,5.911111111111111

8096857,2,B000CC1TQ0,"The film quality is inexcusably poor. We are fans of old classic film and have found thousands of very acceptable films (quality and premise) from the 1930s and 1940s. We are aware that many of these ""B"" rated movies will not be stunning intellectual achievements, but many can be fun and, entertaining. Apologizing in advance for the film quality doesn't mitigate the fault ridden film quality. At the extremely low price of these, the films are, however, worth a chance. One such film, here, was the Lloyd Bridges work:  ***",1424908800,,526,4.844444444444444
