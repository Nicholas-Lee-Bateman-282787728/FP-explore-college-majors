8117361,5,B000F4RHPW,"UFC 59 is the most entertaining of all UFCs till date. Tito Ortiz's match with Forrest Griffin was a classic donnybrook. I thought Forrest outplayed Tito. I was astonished to see the judges awarding Tito with a win. Sean Sherk's brawl with Nick Diaz had elements of fisticuffs, grappling moves and jiu-jitsu. Evan Tanner's match against Justin Levens was a treat to watch. Karo Parisyan simply manhandled Nick Thompson. Jeff Monson was pitted against Marcio Cruz in a thoroughly enjoyable contest. The main event showcased two heavyweights namely Andrei Arlovski and Tim Sylvia slugging it out in a rematch. This spectacular fight was the icing on the cake.",1331078400,,657,5.092592592592593
8117362,5,B000F4RHPW,One of the best UFC events that I have seen in a log time! Tito Ortiz and Forrest Griffen was by far the best fight on the card. At first I thought Tito was going to make short work of Griffen. However Griffen came back and was able to sprawl and make it one great fight. The card as some other good fights that make this dvd worth the 15 bucks.,1171843200,,345,3.8732394366197185

Sure, Pride is a better org. with a lot more talented fighters than the UFC. That is a no brainer. The talent level is not even close. Pride is vastly superior. However, there are a lot of talented fighters on this card so it is definitely worth purchasing. A REAL mma fan will enjoy this dvd. UFC 60 & 61 is another matter. Two real weak shows.",1152748800,4,499,4.0

8117365,5,B000F4RHPW,"UFC 59: Reality Check

04/15/2006

Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, CA

I was really looking forward to this UFC event. Reality Check would pit Forrest Griffin against Tito Ortiz in his UFC return. Andrei Arlovski fighting Tim Sylvia was also a highly anticipated bout, but I knew it wouldn't have the excitement factor that a Griffin/Ortiz battle would produce. Arlovski and Sylvia are knockout fighters, so I knew that fight would end in the first. In any event, here is how it broke down:

Jeff ""The Snowman"" Monson v. Marcio ""Pe De Pano"" Cruz:

Marcio Cruz had just beaten Frank Mir, which brought some attention to his place in the heavyweight division. Monson had come back in UFC 57 to defeat Brandon Lee Hinkle, his first fight in the UFC since losing to Ricco Rodriguezs in UFC 35. This is a decent fight. The fighters almost seem to cancel each other out. They're both so good, that they can't really do anything to each other. Either one explodes and either one really does much damage. They both look unharmed afterwards. This one goes to a split decision.

Evan Tanner v. Justin Levens:

Tanner was supposed to fight Jeremy Horn, but Justin Levens steps up in his place to take this fight on short notice. This one is not all that exciting and it ends with a submission.

Forrest Griffin v. Tito Ortiz:

Forrest Griffin has been quickly gaining popularity since his win over Stephan Bonner in the Ultimate Fighter season 1 finale. After wins over 2 less-than-stellar opponents, he is thrown into the mix with a UFC icon, albeit somewhat past his prime. We would see if Forrest deserves to be in there with the top dogs, which most of us were hoping he would... He's just such a likeable character and his fighting style and personality make for some extremely entertaining fights.

Tito dominates the first round and things are not looking good for Forrest. He gets grounded and pounded for most of the 1st round. The 2nd round, however, is a different story. Forrest stuffs all of Tito's takedown attempts and starts landing some good shots of his own. After this round, Forrest's intensity triples and the crowd feeds off of it and gets fired up for the 3rd. He continues stuffing Tito's takedown attempts until the end of the 3rd. They trade shots, Ortiz finally gets a takedown, Forrest escapes and lands some final shots... and it is all left in the hands of the judges. After the fight, Forrest says he wishes it was a 5 round fight and the crowd goes crazy. This fight had me pumped, I have to be honest. Hopefully these two can fight again after Ortiz gets his grudge match with Ken Shamrock out of the way.

Sean Sherk v. Nick Diaz:

Coming off of the high that was the Ortiz/Griffin fight, this one seemed tame in comparison. Sherk looks strong in the 1st round, the 2nd and 3rd are close - and this one also goes to a decision.

Andrei ""The Pitbull"" Arlovski v. Tim ""The Maine-Iac"" Sylvia:

With 2 of 3 fights ending with decisions, the crowd was ready for a knockout. The main event would cap the night with 2 of the heaviest hitters in the UFC throwing leather in the octagon. WITHOUT SPOILING the outcome, I will say that each fighter lands a huge punch in the first round before it is stopped. It came down to whose punch was more precisely placed and who was more well-prepared to recover from a crushing blow that determined the winner in this bout. These 2 heavyweights will have their rubber match at UFC 61: Bitter Rivals, where Tito Ortiz will have his grudge match with Ken Shamrock (in what is hopefully his retirement fight).

Royce Gracie and Matt Hughes are interviewed in the ring after the main event to hype the coming of UFC 60: Hughes vs. Gracie.

This was another great UFC event. I can't wait to see more from Forrest Griffin and I am also excited for the rubber match between Sylvia and Arlovski. Both Arlovski/Sylvia fights have ended quickly... hopefully the 3rd will be more of a slugfest.",1150934400,7,3933,4.589158345221112
