8138498,4,B000HCPS9E,"If you've ever pondered this question, then ""Dreadheads: Portrait of a Subculture"" is worth a watch. From a sociological yet entertaining perspective, ""Dreadheads"" looks at the experience of white kids who tour with jambands and wear dreadlocks in their hair. The primary vehicle is the interview. The film crew followed many of the same phans around to various shows and festivals. The dreadheads discus why they dread their hair and how it gives them a sense of unity with each other while increasing their alienation with society as-a-whole. Outsiders may be surprised to learn how dreadlocks are formed and what is involved in their maintenance. Additionally, the film examines the roots of dreadlocks, looking at Jamaican Rastafarianism. While one might expect such a film to offer a biased celebration of the subject, this documentary offers surprising balance. Some of the interviewees are truly functional within their lifestyle while others are painfully dysfunctional, often dealing with substance abuse related issues. At one point a venue worker talks about how the dreadheads are the most difficult people to manage. ""Dreadheads"" earns legitimacy with musician interviews, most notably Bob Weir. Other interviews include Jimmy Herring, members of Widespread Panic and a think tank of authors who've documented the deadhead experience. The original score fits beautifully with the video editing. Some may criticize the production quality. This documentary is not a major motion picture; rather it is an indie film. Critics should be grateful that George Lucas isn't the only one who can afford to make films.  This is a documentary of the fans and by the fans. If you ever wanted a peek into this uniquely American subculture, ""Dreadheads"" delivers.",1174608000,6,1761,5.35740072202166
