6788860,4,B00P80Y2SI,"A little kitschy, but enjoyable film with Tony Sirico and Brendan Fehr. I'd recommend renting it.",1421798400,,97,5.125
6788861,3,B00P80Y2SI,"The film centers around Tony Zarro (Tony Sirico) a retired policeman. His brother Roberta, a mobster, was murdered. Bobby Stax (Wass Stevens) got eight years for the crime, but is getting out in two. Gino Zarro, is Roberto's son, ex-army and now an attorney. He is representing Vanessa Andreoli (Kelli Barrett) against her husband Frankie (Brian Tarantina) in a wife battery and child custody case. Frankie is an unlikeable punk gangster who took over after Bobby went to prison and doesn't want to cede anything back. Oh yeah, the FBI is involved too. Tony is obsessed with getting Bobby Stax.

The film takes place in New Jersey and stereo-types Italians as people who eat all the time. It has some of the worse swagger music I have seen to date. This is not a bad crime film, but has nothing over the top to distinguish it or make it memorable. Time wise it is a bit on the short side. Recommend as a rental for those who like Italian crime films.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. One scene of spousal abuse.",1421539200,,1012,4.554945054945055
