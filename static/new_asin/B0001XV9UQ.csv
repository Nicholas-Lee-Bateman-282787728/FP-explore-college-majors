2043093,5,B0001XV9UQ,"I first saw this movie when I was about 11 years old in the movie theater. I remember telling my friend at that time, that when I got married I was going to walk down the aisle to the same song.
I never forgot this, got married 24 years ago and the duo that played at my wedding, was able to find the music and lyrics and they performed it beautifully for our ceremony.
Several people commented what a beautiful song it was, yet they had never heard it!",1254960000,4,453,4.101123595505618
2043094,4,B0001XV9UQ,"Charlie McCready's daughter, Wendy, is about to go off to college, making her ""the marrying age"", and he wants to make sure she ends up with Mr. Right and not childhood sweetheart Bart. Bart's a good guy, but it seems like he and his friends only care about surfing and having fun, and they're all going to City College so they can stay together rather than aiming for big things in life. Charlie wants his daughter to attend prestigious Huttington and marry a lawyer like himself. Stressing out over it all and trying to keep Wendy and Bart apart leads to a lot of unnecessary trouble for Charlie, but it all works out in a classic Disney happy ending.

Disney's 1973 film, ""Superdad"", is an interesting one from the studio. During the '70's, they often used Kurt Russell to make family-friendly comedies with the teen audience particularly in mind, though the attitude of the era clashed a bit with Disney's somewhat conservative image. ""Superdad"" seems to try to be more timely and reality-grounded than the other comedies from Disney in that period, but its attempt to be contemporary and conservative at the same time doesn't play out that well. The most notable point is how the female lead's transition to college seems to be more about finding a husband than finding herself. But I'm just a guy, and a Disney fanatic, so that issue doesn't bother me that much except to raise an eyebrow or induce a chuckle. The course of the film basically can be divided into three parts: Charlie tries to understand Wendy's friends by hanging out with them, Charlie tries to just get Wendy away from them by sending her to a different college, and the very bizarre act three, in which Charlie has to save daughter Wendy from a crazy artist who is probably Disney's most dated villain. While it is all funny/enjoyable, even that third act, it's that final bit that I could take issue with if I decided not to like the movie for its good points alone. The artist character's sudden relationship with Wendy seems to come from nowhere and needs more explanation than is given. It's obviously a sudden excuse to have Wendy need rescuing, providing the ultra-happy ending.

So, why do I like this movie? No, it's not just because I have fond memories of watching it on the Disney Channel as a kid. Sure, that's part of it, but why do many of us have fond memories of watching stuff like this on the Disney Channel as a kid? I guess some of us just like these kinds of movies; the kinds of movies Disney makes. Whether it's the quirky characters, the better than real-life world they live in (though it's not always as rose-colored as people say/remember/think), or the happy endings, some of us just love Disney's whole thing, and some of us can even see it in their much maligned '70's stuff. Anyway, to get a bit more specific about ""Superdad"", it IS funny, but its big saving grace is the fantastic cast. You'll see familiar faces in roles of all sizes, and the film stars Hogan's Heroes' Bob Crane in the title role and studio-fave Kurt Russell as Wendy's boyfriend, Bart. Wendy is played by Dark Shadows alumnus Kathleen Cody, a young Bruno Kirby plays the role of key friend Stanley, and Disney legend Joe Flynn plays his usual complaining character too as Charlie's frustrated client. The cast really does carry the picture, even if Bob Crane is not the charming guy here that he was on Hogan's Heroes. His character is so cranky and snooty that he can actually be a bit hard to sympathize with at times, but not so much that we stop hoping things workout for Charlie, Wendy, and Bart in the end.

""Superdad"" (by the way, the title does not indicate that anyone in the film has super powers), as I write this review, is only available as a Disney Movie Club exclusive or through sellers who got it through DMC, or through Disney Movie Rewards (where I got it). The DVD is full screen (which I doubt it should be since this was indeed a theatrical release, but aspect ratio can be a hinky issue with Disney titles) and has no extras, unless you count scene selection. The old opening to ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" is shown before the film for some reason, and that's a really nice flashback for some of us too, so I guess you could consider that an extra of sorts.",1242950400,,4263,4.569934640522876
2043095,5,B0001XV9UQ,"I got this DVD as a belated birthday gift..Since I am a fan of older Disney films , it is a treasure to enjoy again

Disney was always known for family fare. In thge early 1970's, Disney pictures did amazing job of making family films with Walt's vision after his death in the late 1960s. Superdad was one of those. I remember seeing this film when it first came out ,on a Saturday showing, paired with Herbie Rides Again

The way this roles was written it seems a vehicle of Dean Jones or Ken Berry, rather than foor Bob Crane. However steps into the father shoes easily and makes this film work.

Charlie McCready, A business attorney,  still thinks his daughter (Kathleen Cody)is his little girl. He hangs around her and her friends Inclusing her boyfriend Bart (Kurt Russell). He tries to learn his daughter, but all it does is push her away

The supporting cast  includes Bruno Kirby and Nicholas Hammond (South of Music and 1980 TV Spiderman)as well as Disney staples Joe Flynn and (a Pre Eight is Enough) Dick Van Patton.

It may be corny by today's modern sitcom-like  standards, but this 1973 film still DOES holds up. It is enjoyable for great family fare..and maybe we need more of these films these days! NO messages just fun

2043098,5,B0001XV9UQ,"THE STORY: Charlie (Bob Crane) is a succesful lawyer who is worried and overprotective of his 18 year old daughter Wendy (Kathleen Cody). Recently graduated from High School, she hangs around with her surfer pals, listening to music, cruising, and having fun, but Dad wants her to get serious and get in the perfect law college, and improve the quality of her friends. He attempts to find a husband for her, and of course his choices don't match her own ideas. Her childhood sweetheart Bart (Kurt Russel) is still in the picture for one thing, and she is in love with him. So Dad embarks on an effort to get closer to his daughter in order to influence her and does the things she likes to do with hilarious results - including multiple injuries. The scenes of him screaming while being pulled on water skis alone are worth seeing this movie for, trust me, even if you didn't see the rest.. But see it all.

BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: The film required quite a bit of location shooting outside the studio lot in California including in San Francisco at Fisherman's Wharf; around the many houseboats in Sausalito; the First Christian Church in Pasadena, and the ""wedge"" in Newport Beach. There are 3 original songs in the movie all written by Shane Tatum, and the song, ""When I'm Near You"", became a popular song for weddings after this film. Directed by Vince McEveety. Actors Joe Flynn and Dick Van patten are great character actors in this film, a regular job for Disney during the period. The song ""These are the Best of Times"" was sung by Bobby Goldsboro. Filmed in Technicolor. Interesting trivia: Kevin Corcoran, a child actor in dozens of Disney films, worked behind the camera on this film and others for the studio. This Disney live action comedy was theatrically released on January 18, 1973, but had been in production since the late 1960's. It was shown on the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" television show in a 2 hour episode on February 15, 1976. It aired again edited as two seperate 1 hour episodes on November 26 and December 3, 1978. Theatrical version first released to rental VHS market in 1985. 95 minutes in length.

There is a lot to like in this film for any fan of clean Disney family fare from this era. There are some great scenes with a crazy beatnik painter on a houseboat, leading up to a big paint fight. Oh, and if you are a fan of Kurt Russel he is great in this one.",1219622400,24,2399,4.53810623556582

2043131,2,B0001XV9UQ,"According to Wikipedia, Superdad was a critical and commercial failure.  After viewing this movie, it's easy to see why.  Whether a poor transfer to DVD or just sloppy camerawork in the first place, the opening sequences are almost impossible to make out.  There's a poorly lit, ill-composed series of shots for the opening credits then a dark double exposure dream sequence with a ""la-la-la"" song that introduces the audience to an extremely sour malcontent (Bob Crane) who's entire outlook on life in general is one of suspicion and constant disapproval.  ""Those rotten kids, how could they grow up that way!?""  The story is slight, another tedious explanation for the generation gap.  Superdad (Bob Crane) is an obsessive control freak who has his daughter's life mapped out for her.  This includes going to the right college, dumping all her fun-loving friends, and marrying the right guy, preferably someone rich with a high-power job.  On cue, Nicholas Hammond (as Roger Rhinehurst) enters the fray.  ""He's the one for our Wendy.""  The bulk of the movie centers on a pompous Bob Crane and his character's attempt to micromanage his daughter's life.  Some slapstick is involved requiring Crane to squeal at every opportunity, when he isn't squeezing his eyes tight and producing edicts he expects everyone to follow.  The word tyrant comes easily to mind, as does the word unpleasant.  There are very few moments of real fun in this movie.  Barbara Rush, Joe Flynn, Dick Van Patten, and Kurt Russell are sorely wasted in roles that don't offer them any chance to show their talents.

2043138,2,B0001XV9UQ,"I was curious about this movie only because of ""Autofocus,"" the movie about Bob Crane's life and death that, whether or not entirely accurate, did not paint an especially attractive portrait of the actor who was apparently obsessed with a ""swinging"" lifestyle.  (I was also curious about Crane because for a number of years I lived just blocks away from the condo in which he was murdered.) ""Autofocus"" indicated that this was Crane's effort at a theatrical comeback when, after Hogan's Heroes, he had trouble landing parts and was primarily relegated to dinner theater, and Disney was apparently so unenthusiastic about the film that it shelved it for the better part of a year. Having seen the movie, I think I understand Disney's reaction.
If you enjoyed this film as a youngster or teen and want to relive those halcyon days, you may well enjoy it.  And no one can say it isn't ""family fare.""  It certainly was an effort at a good, clean, fun, family film. Crane is the Dad who realizes he is losing touch with his daughter, who is soon off to college, and wants to be more involved in her life and shape her choices, encouraging her to jettison her high school friends--a group that seems pretty much straight out of Scooby Doo or the films of the '70s in which the fun-loving ""gang"" hangs out, goes to the beach, and engages in generally harmless frolics--and to go to a ""good"" college and not the ""City College"" that seems the norm among her friends.  Of course, Dad blunders his way through most of these efforts, looking foolish as he attempts to water ski and play football with the gang at the beach, and his efforts to deceive his daughter about a scholarship to get her into the good school are exposed, which of course alienates her even further.  Since this is a comedy, all works out well, and her high school sweetheart (Kurt Russell) is exposed as more than a cut above anything Dad had imagined.
The biggest problems with the movie are that is isn't very funny and it is always predictable (so I don't believe the summary above gives anything away).  Dad can't water ski well and makes a fool of himself.  Hilarity.  Dad goes to college to spy on his daughter and ends up arrested as a peeping Tom after looking in the wrong window and trampolining into a swimming pool.  Side splitting.  Dad has a confrontation with a ""hippie artist"" who wants to marry the daughter and they end up covered in paint and doused in San Francisco Bay.  Uncontrollable laughter.  Finally. the limo breaks down and Dad has to ride to daughter's wedding in the back of a deli truck which leaves him smelling like, well, the back of a deli truck.  Big laughs.
It probably isn't fair to expect a lot from a Disney movie of the early '70s when family films were few and far between. But I don't see most adults getting much of a kick out of this movie. It is too cliched and predictable and just not funny.  Crane does a decent job in the lead, and the cast includes some interesting faces--Joe Flynn, Barbara Rush, Kurt Russell, Bruno Kirby, and others.  But unless you are starved for family fare, or simply want to relive an old ""favorite,"" I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, much less spend the $20 or $30 bucks that DVD copies seem to be going for.",1323216000,,3252,4.506802721088436

A real gem here is the musical contribution of songwriter Bobby Goldsboro.  ""These are the Best Times"" done by a children's choir at the church wedding of the main characters Wendy and Bart (played by a young Kurt Russell) is a young bride's envy!
