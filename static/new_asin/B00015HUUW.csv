8256814,2,B00015HUUW,"because you won't want to miss a single second of this classic poo poo mouthed anime. with the rhetorical question ""How do you know I won't kill you with this?"" we are whisked away to magical place, where the only way to get your robot to do what you want is to curse at him excessively, and computer experts are foul mouthed 'roid addicts. And between wondering why the slender looking, silver haired hottie in the beginning turns about to be a male vampire, and wondering if we missed something between the girl on the elevator and sengoku as they seem to have met before we got a chance to see it, we also get a chance to ponder the practicality of a building that's so tall it reaches into space. How do I spell classy anime? With a capital C of course. C for Cyber City. The animation's good.
