5737522,3,B00CS7PIW8,"Wendy Parks has spent the past year on tour supporting her book, an in-depth look at the attempted cover up of her husband's death in a plane crash.

Now all she wants is to return home to her mother Connie and her daughter, 15-year-old Samantha. But when a powerful solar flare strikes her flight home, killing the pilot, knocking out the co-pilot and frying all the electronic systems on the plane, it looks like she may not even get there.

As panic sets in among the passengers, Wendy works with flight attendant Jake to manage the growing chaos and tension on the plane as she tries to keep 30,000 tons of steel hurtling through the air at 500 miles per hour.

Flying blind, Wendy tries to find a way to communicate with air traffic control - one way or another, this plane is coming down. With the passengers' lives on the line, Wendy will have to find a way to land safely... or never see her daughter again.",1391644800,,915,4.434523809523809
5737523,3,B00CS7PIW8,"Air disaster pictures, I found this one worth the money. I don't know what it was, the plot just seemed to me fairly well thought up. Anything is possible regarding flying ( I haven't flown since 1988, for me, train,bus or automobile.
This picture provides more reasons besides high ticket prices,lost bags, to take the train. The side bar story of racial intolerance, in our post September 11th world is also reasonable. However, the performance was way over the top. The kid in the movie needs an aditude ajustment I don't enjoy smart mouth kids. Over all I recommend the picture with a three out of five stars.",1387584000,2,613,4.685185185185185
5737524,4,B00CS7PIW8,"Yes, the crash's etc. were not up to current but the performances by Dee Wallace and the grand daughter brought this show to life!",1382140800,,130,4.458333333333333
5737525,1,B00CS7PIW8,"This ""story"" (and I use that word in it's loosest sense) stands as testament to why you should never let anybody write or direct a movie if their sole exposure to ""science"" is an experiment involving diet Pepsi and Menthos...

Solar flares that kill people aside, this is a ham-fisted poorly-acted melodrama of such banality that it almost defies description.  The production values are so low-budget that it looks like something put together by CollegeHumor as a parody of air disaster movies.  The CGI is so woeful that it wouldn't have made the grade 10 years ago -it truely looks like a class project by first year college students who completed 3D modelling 101, but haven't moved on to texturing or shading.

A cast of D-grade actors, ably mis-directed by a guy you've never heard of, for a production company you've never heard of, slog their way through a script that is in equal parts turgid and predictable.

This is such an awful waste of everyone's time that I couldn't even recommend the trailer.

Do you remember Airport 77 ? The one where a private 747 lands intact in the ocean, and although full of air somehow manages to sink to the seabed?  Collision Course makes Airport 77 look like Speilberg directing Shakespeare",1375660800,3,1235,4.769953051643192

8585594,5,B00CS7PIW8,"This movie captured my attention depicting what can and will happen if and when a powerful solar flair hits the earth. The results can and will be devistating, not only for a plane in flight, but the electrical grid as well. Are we prepared? I think not, but I wish the opposite.",1485129600,,279,4.384615384615385

8585596,3,B00CS7PIW8,Just average movie and too much talking.  The collision didn't take place until the end of it.  Lots of people thinking to themselves and we knew what they were thinking in this movie.,1463356800,,184,4.545454545454546

8585600,5,B00CS7PIW8,"A great airplane disaster movie. A writer gets on a plane after writing a book about plane crashes. Everything goes wrong. She spends her time divided between problem solving & trying to fix her relationship with her teenage daughter who is on the ground with her grandmother. Things aren't going well on the ground either, power outages & carjackers are just some of the challenges those on the ground face.",1438819200,,408,4.8428571428571425
