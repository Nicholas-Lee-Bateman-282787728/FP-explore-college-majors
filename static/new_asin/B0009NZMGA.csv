8063924,4,B0009NZMGA,"I learned about this film from my video editing magazine. A new (and I should say talented) director, George Johnson, shoots a feature length movie entirely on consumer video equipment. He does manage to push the video format to the limit with good filming techniques, clever editing and some surprising special effects.

This is a movie about making a movie and, generally speaking, pursuing your dream despite the obvious obstacles. A teenager (Kevin) borrows his grandpa's video camera to shot a ""movie"" in the woods, with his friends as actors. Kevin wants no violence, drugs, adult language or sex scenes in his movie, but, as the script becomes popular, a producer with money offers him help if Kevin agrees to alter the script. I won't say anything else about the plot, except that I liked the intense dream sequences.

Recommended for teenagers and adults that would like to see something different, a thought provoking film. One more thing: I purchased my DVD copy through the Allegory Pictures web site.",1148342400,3,1013,4.988165680473373
8063925,4,B0009NZMGA,"When I first popped in the DVD, I thought I had accidentally bought a copy of somebody's home video.  It looked like something shot with an old full-size VHS camcorder.  I was intrigued by this gutsy stunt, but at the same time, hoped it wouldn't last too long.  Thankfully, about two minutes into the film, it changed over to a nice, film look.  Turns out, the beginning is intended to look bad so that the ""film"" portion of the movie would look better.  Interesting idea, and well executed.

As far as the story goes, I found myself confused, perplexed, laughing, and even a little frightened at times - but consistently intrigued.  It was obvious that there was more to the story than initially meets the eye.  There was a sub-level story going on, and it was a fun mental excercise trying to put it all together.

The end is absolutely GREAT!  I don't think that it is humanly possible to guess how it will wrap up, and it really sends you on your way thinking about life, and what kinds of possibilities it has to offer.

A great story, interestingly told.  A rare treat for those who like original stories.",1126051200,6,1112,4.505
