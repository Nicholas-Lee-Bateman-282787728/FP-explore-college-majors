6577650,5,B00MH3XSSO,"Collection four of the Raymond Burr Perry Mason TV Movies.  Shows during this period shot on film but edited to standard def video tape, so the final product only exists as a video tape.  So don't expect the clear images you get from the original series which was edited on film which makes possible DVD and higher resolution remastering.  Do expect Raymond Burr and Perry Mason, which is the reason to get this in the first place.",1437004800,,431,4.571428571428571

6577664,5,B00MH3XSSO,"I've already watched 2 of the movies.  ""The Case of the Fatal Fashion"" is one that you need to notice the panning of the New York skyline.  You must might see a couple of towers that are no longer part of that skyline.  A very interesting plot and mystery where Perry is one of the prosecuting witnesses.",1413590400,4,304,4.298245614035087
