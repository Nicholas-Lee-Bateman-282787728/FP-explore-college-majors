3058736,1,B001131GGC,"The DVD sold under the title ""The Spook That Sat By the Door"" (ASIN: B001131GGC) is an Asian bootleg distributed by Red Sun, and it has major problems.

I purchased (and returned) two copies of this import DVD, and both played exactly the same: about 12 minutes before the end of the movie, the DVD starts skipping, freezes completely, then returns to the Main Menu. You can't fast-forward past this frozen part, and if you try to select the last two chapters from the Chapter Menu, nothing happens. It's as if the end of the movie doesn't exist. Also, if you select the Greenlee interview in Special Features, nothing happens. I didn't check the data size of this DVD (DVD-R?), but there is definitely something wrong with this release.

As for the movie itself (at least what I saw of it), it's pretty provocative, heady, funny, bold stuff. Up until the malfunction, the DVD picture (anamorphic widescreen) and sound are fine.

3058737,1,B001131GGC,This item had to be returned because it did not play all the way through. Received another copy and the same thing happened. I guess it is just in the re-recording process. The seller was pleasant to work with and handled the return quickly.,1348012800,3,241,4.5

3058740,4,B001131GGC,Excellent movie for its time and even today. The Government is still running games and trying to manipulate the public. Loved the music as well.,1255392000,,144,4.8
3058741,3,B001131GGC,Preetty good film. I enjoy watching old school films from the 7o's sometimes. I like that the main character is trying to achieve a goal rather than sell drugs or beat woman. It's not as good as the book considering that it leaves out a few things that make the story clearer. You most likely would have to have grown up in the time period that this film came out to get the full weight of it though. This film will not reasonate as much with young African American growing up today.,1215475200,6,483,4.260869565217392

8239964,5,B001131GGC,"This movie has thought provoking dialogue, realistic scenarios and wonderful acting. I can honestly say that there wasn't anything that I disliked about it. What was refreshing was how the film ended. I wondered if there would be an ending that would leave a ""bad taste in the mouth"", so to speak, but the ending was fantastic. In my opinion, the ending also realistically deals with what choices any true revolutionary may have to deal with when liberation is involved. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys great storytelling, and in particular I would recommend this film to African-Americans. Very enjoyable, and It is a must see!",1402617600,,645,4.926605504587156
8239965,5,B001131GGC,Awesome !  Gives you a lot to think about. The what ifs also what can be accomplished if people are on the same page. In reality good does not always triumph over evil though. But who was evil?,1402531200,,193,4.078947368421052
8239966,5,B001131GGC,This movie took me back to a time that I could relate to. This movie was banned back in the day with good reason. It is not practical today but made a lot of sense back then. A classic in it's own right!!!!!,1380672000,,207,3.8372093023255816
8239967,5,B001131GGC,"Hitting ""the man"" where it hurts! Lawrence Cook kills it as Dan Freeman, the first black man recruited by the C.I.A. But instead of helping the government he goes back to his hometown of Chicago and trains a group of ghetto youths (including one dude who looks white,David Lemieux/Pretty Willie. Pretty soon the whole city is shook as Freeman and his militant brothers reek havoc on government officials and the national guard! See the movie America didn't want you to see!",1373414400,2,473,4.851851851851852
8239968,5,B001131GGC,I remember this movie from years ago and I found it just as entertaining and the subject matter just as true as long ago.  It is great to have a copy to watch and discuss with my adult children.,1364601600,,194,3.9743589743589745
