It's what you'd expect: a film about rival gangs in a prison competing for money, drugs, respect and the studied myopia of corrupt prison officers.  It's all action and you can't really get bored watching it.  But what makes me want to watch it again is the soundtrack. Just a handful of hardcore punk tracks, and the last one is called ""Sometimes Anti Social but Always Anti-Fascist"" - an anti-fascist anthem at the end of a football film works for me!  From a female point of view, Timothy V. Murphy's fake Russian accent is quite sexy.  Not rocket science but worth a view over Saturday night's takeaway.",1260316800,14,748,4.511111111111111

8356835,3,B0028S10Z6,"This film was a little bit unrealistic, come on, a Soccer (excuse me.. ""Football"") game to determine who deserves freedom from an over crowded prison o_O?? Riiiiight LoL. Not anywhere near as good as the the first movie, But despite the implausible plot, I found my self cheering for the GSE Firm lads, and the violent action was decent, what you might expect in a prison movie. And how strange is it that an actor can play a totally different characters in a sequel?  Actor/musician,Terrence Jay, who wrote the song 'One Blood' and plays the Harvard roommate Van Holden for the first movie, but then plays a prisoner named Jess Abbot in the sequel movie. Maybe the casting Directer figured no one would notice, and maybe a lot of people didn't, but i sure did LoL.",1356652800,,765,4.625

8356838,5,B0028S10Z6,"If you like raw violence that strikes you so real that you could be there, then you will really enjoy this one.",1286841600,2,111,4.090909090909091
8356839,3,B0028S10Z6,"After the events in the surprisingly fun first movie, the green street boys find themselves in prison with their arch rivals Millwall.  Now this depiction of prison is about as believable as an episode of Oz, but it is non stop action with fight after fight, with minor sub plots involving a crooked correctional guard.  There aren't any twists and turns to the story and the ending you can see coming a mile away.  If you like stupid action movies then this might be worth watching.",1261180800,4,483,4.593023255813954
