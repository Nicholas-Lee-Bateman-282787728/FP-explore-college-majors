1058336,4,6305667454,I am a true Golgo 13 fan and i did enjoy it it was the worst however  friends of mine did not enjoy it saying movie evermade and people should be  shot for making such garbage but i enjoyed it and fans of the manga and  anime probably will to.,961718400,,243,3.82
1058337,1,6305667454,"Those of you thinking you were going to find the Animated Golgo 13: The Professional, beware.  This is a live movie, NOT animation.  I was very disappointed to take it home and pop it in only to find a 1970's live  movie, and i'd hate for someone else to make the same mistake.",946252800,24,277,4.188679245283019
1058451,5,6305667454,"Evidently, it's not for all animation fans. But this is a classic. I didn't think that the music and sound effects are as good as ""Golgo 13: Queen Bee,"" but the plot more than made up for them in my opinon. However, the differences in the types of music used, is probably because of the considerably long time gap between the two movies (15 years). The ending was interesting as well.",996710400,,384,4.422535211267606

As a die-hard fan of the GOLGO 13 anime movies and comics and Sonny Chiba as well,this was great to watch. Sonny Chiba as the no-nonsense assassin is doing what he does best...killing.

1058453,5,6305667454,"Based on one of the most long-running manga series in Japan, Golgo 13: The Professional is simply one of the best action films ever made. Right from the start you'll notice that this anime has a huge retro spin on it, with its split-screen effects and such. Golgo 13 is looking good; sharp and deadly. The soundtrack seemed kind of unfitting for me after seeing Golgo 13: Queen Bee, but I found there were a lot of memorable retro songs in the movie. For those who don't care much, the plot is simple, but the analytical can delve as far into the meaning of it as they want- just like in Golgo 13: Queen Bee. Having this quality is definitely a good thing for the story. The Dawson Building finale definitely was the highest point in the movie, outdated computer-animated helicopter scenes aside. The action and intrigue never really stops, and the movies ending provides a rather unexpected turn.  Thankfully, Urban Vision has re-released this classic, as it was originally released by Streamline, which is famous for its [bad] dubs. In the dub, people swear constantly just because they can, and it really begins to sound stupid after a while. Lieutenant Braygon yells just about every expletive in the book, at about 20 cuss words a minute. The subtitled version has nowhere near the amount of ridiculous cussing, and better voice actors as expected.
Sure, it can be over the top sometimes, but, as they say, Golgo 13 makes the impossible possible. Go see it.",992908800,2,1462,4.733333333333333

One of my favorite Anime movies next to "" Akira"", "" Ghost in the Shell"", "" Ninja Scroll"" and others.

1058456,5,6305667454,"This video is the best  action packed anime ever exist. The story is simillar to "" Professional by Luc Besson"", and the tone can be compared to John Woo's films. But basically,  Golgo 13 is the Japanese answer to Coppola's  "" Godfather"". Most of the action animes are coming from the roots of "" Yakuza Flicks"". And that's why the animes  are so Japanese. But ""Golgo 13"" is built on the American ground  and touched by French perfume.  So this is the real international anime which anybody can enjoy.  If you get bored by  Disney World, you better start on a journey  into Anime World by picking up "" Golgo 13"", I insist.",975369600,2,620,4.415929203539823
1058457,5,6305667454,"Golgo 13's one of those movie's that goes around appreciated by only a few.  Most of my friends who've seen it either loved it or hated it, depending.  I think a lot of the sex scenes turn people off to the film, as well as it's noir setting and odd style of story progression.  Perhaps the film's an acquired taste -- I loved it after having seen it once, and even after several years since seeing it for the first time I love it still.  Many of the dark elements of the film -- exposing humanity's more negative aspects with no mercy -- I think leaves an unsettling mood in the audience.  But, heh, that's why I love the film.  In fact, I liked this one better than ""Queen Bee,"" Queenie being the one more people seem to like, I guess, because it has more of a ""linear"" feel to it than this one.
Anyways, SEE THIS MOVIE.  It's artsy, even in the scenes where a head's being blown off ... .",971222400,7,891,4.145348837209302
1058458,2,6305667454,"I loved the anime of Golgo 13, and I'm also kind of a fan of Sonny Chiba, but this movie wasn't too great.  It had some cool 60s style cinematography  and settings, but I think the film failed to have the same attitude and  style that the original comics did.  I recommend the anime version highly  over this one, but its worth checking out if you're a Duke Togo fan like  myself.
If you're looking for some great 60s Japanese gangster flicks,  check out Tokyo Drifter and Branded To Kill, both directed by Seijin  Suzuki.  They are really cool!",965606400,,545,4.424242424242424
1058459,4,6305667454,I picked this up at the movie rental place years ago and have probably rented it 5 times since.  Definitely not for kids because the story is  violent and involves some nudity.  Golgo 13 puts James Bond to shame as a  ladies man and is the essential assasin. You WILL root for the bad guy.  Plot isn't complicated but does involve some unexpected twists (one in  particular).  Buy this if you are ready for something different with anime.,965606400,,438,4.538461538461538
1058460,5,6305667454,"Duke Togo, aka Golgo 13, is a professional assassin. He never misses a deadline, and always finds a way to hit his target. For example: When Golgo  13 must dispose of an Ex-Nazi murderer in a lavish (bullet proof) penthouse  surrounded by the police, he calmly fires ten rounds from a beer sign two  blocks away, through a window of an office building, down the hall,  exploding a water cooler, out another window, and lined up into the bullet  proof glass until one makes it through and into the head of the sadistic  Nazi killer! And believe me, I gave nothing away. Please see this  incredible movie.",965174400,2,603,4.579439252336448

7892807,3,6305667454,"I'm a fan of the Golgo 13 character, but I will give this movie an objective review.

First thing is the compulsory ""this is not the anime"" statement. Let's get that part out of the way. This is a 70's live-action film starring Sonny Chiba.

The film is old, and is only as good as the celluloid source reel it was taken from.

Sonny plays the enigmatic hitman Golgo 13. He pulls the look off very well. His portrayal of the character is distinctively different from that of the anime. In this live-action film, Golgo 13 solves problems intelligently and displays a distinctly higher intelligence than in the anime. This is especially noticable in the last part of the movie.

Overall I would give this movie a low 3 for all it's flaws (poor quality, sub-par plot), but it's worth having a watch if you're a big Golgo 13 fan. It would be a rental if you could actually find a place that carries it which would be pretty unlikely. But if you're a big fan of all things Golgo 13 then it's a movie you should check out if for no other reason than having seen it.",1164240000,7,1059,4.333333333333333
7892808,5,6305667454,"""The Professional: Golgo 13"" is the best anime I have ever seen. This came out in 1983, which was between ""Fist of the Northstar"" and ""Vampire Hunter D"". The plot is so sophisticated that you will forget you are watching an animated feature. It is about a professional assassin codenamed ""Golgo 13"", who is trying to survive an onslaught of attacks from the CIA, FBI, and the Pentagon, not knowing who is behind them. He also has to go up against a repusive, biologically-engineered mutant called Snake. My favorite scene is when Golgo 13 and Snake go head-to-head in a glass elevator, each using his own distinct syle of fighting. Snake is the kind of killer that would simply tear you apart, wheras Golgo uses more precise martial arts to defend himself. Some people compare the character of Golgo 13 to James Bond. I disagree. Golgo is more like ""The Jackal"", played by Edward Fox. He is methodical, cold-blooded, and sociopathic, similar to Tom Cruise's character in ""Collateral"". However, you do tend to root for him, just like Edward Fox and Tom Cruise, because they are so professional at what they do, and all have a marginal sense of humanity. Golgo 13 is not invincible, contrary to poular belief. He bleeds, feels pain, and requires medical attention and recuperation before continuing on a job. Some people also complain about the sex in this film. If you have ever listened to the audio commentary by Osamu Dezaki during the movie ""Queen Bee"", you will understand that it reflecting the character's current feelings, and this is how he/she copes with them. Most of the people in the film have their lives destroyed, sans Golgo 13, who remains indifferent, since he is used to dealing with these situations. This is not a movie for kids, but makes a fantastic thriller/action film for adults. It taps into psychology, as well, showing how delicate the human condition realy is.",1104710400,2,1889,4.833333333333333
7892809,5,6305667454,"This movie was and continues to be my favorite movie of all time. I like all types of movies and its kinda odd that my favorite happens to be a japanese animation film. From beginning to end, the professional GOLGO 13 is an action plot twist full of surprises. Masterfully done with impressive english voice talents and an upbeat soundtrack, the movie is sure to keep adult audiences entertained (If you don't mind brief depictions of graphic sex.) My only gripe is its unavailability on DVD and VHS copies are hard to come by these days. If you happen to stumble upon this movie, by all means buy it. I cannot recommend this movie enough.",1091059200,,639,4.565217391304348
7892810,4,6305667454,"This is an anime classic, with lots of action and an interesting storyline. It had some very good graphics for its time! The film focuses on a killer named Duke Togo, code named Golgo 13, who one of the trained proffesionals that works as a hitman. It has at least 10 F-bombs, and that's okay. The violence is brutal, and there is nudity. The animation was [bad], though... But it must have been amazing to see 20 years ago. Anyway, it was a great action/thriller.",1055980800,,464,4.470588235294118
7892811,2,6305667454,"""Golgo 13: The Professional"" is a movie I struggle with. It has strong characters, an interesting plot, but a very tired feel and poor animation. It's about an assassin named Golgo 13. The film mostly consists of small stories about our hero on assignments and missions while injecting large amounts of excessive sex and sick violence. This film is not a feel-good. As a matter of fact, none of this movie is ever any cheerful. I suppose hardcore fans of anime might like this, but everyone else will want to stay away.",1040169600,,519,4.6521739130434785

Top notch animated action drama. The bodies begin to fall and the body count rises when Golgo 13 gets into action. Truly one of my all time favorite animes. I have been a huge fan of Golgo 13 for many years and hope to see more Golgo 13 anime in the future...",1014508800,,505,4.440860215053763
7892813,5,6305667454,"If you haven't seen this, what are you waiting for? When growing up I remember playing an NES game called ""Golgo 13"" and I always wondered when the story and characters came from, well my search ended about 3 years ago when I first saw this flick. So if that struck a cord I suggest you add this to the cart.
A great spy thriller that could have been a live action piece. The story of Golgo 13, a professional (yay a title reference :) assasin who is hired to kill a wealthy entrepenures son. After completing the hit Golgo 13 gets sent into a game of cat and mouse that brings the film full circle. The films artwork is great as well, minus a computer generated sequence that looks like it was made on an Amiga (and probable was). Again this is a must have anime for any collection.",1013644800,,783,4.226666666666667
7892814,5,6305667454,"This is one of the best anime bloody drama killer flicks I have EVER seen. Golgo is an assissin that never lets a contract expire under any circumstance, not even when they know he's coming.  He takes on an assignment that calls for him to kill the son of a oil billionare who has extensive financial influence on the U.S. goverment and all of it's intelligence agencies.  In turn the father gets the FBI, CIA, Pentagon to hunt down this invincible killer.  The pentagon produces one of thier secret BLACK-OPS project, Snake a bio-enginered apauling creature with purple skin that knows martial-arts and has a knife yo-yo that slits your throat from twenty feet away. The FBI sent two cannablistic, demented prisoners who participated in a secret experiment in which forty death-row prisoners were sent into the congo without food, water or weapons and had to go against jungle beasts, canabils, and various tribes practiclly barefoot. After seven days only two were left, and that experience left them psycotic (cant even speak), and immune to pain, these two are Golgo's last obstacle.  The ironic ending in the best when Golgo makes it through the impossible gauntlet beat-up with gunshot wounds, broken ribs and to the father's surprise the son hired the assissin himself... I call him superman because he is just one man going against mutants, armies, and enhanced psyco-paths while still fulfilling contracts killing for his clients... This, to me was one of those flicks that remains superior to it's sequal.  Queen Bee (Gollgo part two) failed to keep me attentive, and terribly lacked plot as in contrast to it's predessor.  You may not like this anime if you're female :)lol",1010534400,,1684,4.953900709219858
7892815,5,6305667454,"Ok, so it wasn't as great as the animated version but so what???  Sonny Chiba is awesome as Duke Togo and Sue Shihomi is awesome as Lei Lin.  However, I wonder what was the movie's original language.  I've heard it to be either Cantonese or Japanese.  After getting the Sonny Chiba Action Pack, I know now that it was shot in Japanese.  Also, while it was digitally remastered, the picture quality wasn't that great.  At least it was letterboxed and subtitled.  I only wish the one with Takakura Ken comes out on video subtitled and letterboxed soon!!!  I'm longing to see that version also.

Update:  The Ken Takakura version has finally been released on DVD in Japan but is not commercially available in the US.  However, fan-subtitled DVD versions are available on the Internet.",1008633600,,781,4.753731343283582
