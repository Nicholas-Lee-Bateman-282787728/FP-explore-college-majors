3117716,5,B0013LUDKC,"I have the original 1996 version of this video on VHS and I have the 2006 version of this exact same Video. I feel Ed Frawley is one of the best, if not THE best serious training people of dogs in the business. The first thing you need to understand is that he used to be a breeder of working line German Shepherd dogs and was a police dog handler. His videos are not breed specific, but if you can train a dog to the competition level required of Schutzhund or K.P.N.V, you certainly know a thing or two about teaching pet level obedience if you know how to teach competition level obedience. The second thing to understand is that he's been doing this since the 1970's and early 1980's. He really loves and cares about dogs and understand the human and canine relationship better than most.  The trend these days is food based, clicker only based training. While as the initial point of training this is fine, as it raises the concept of the desired behavior and what you want the animal to do, eventually, you will need to add a correction phase, and later still, a proofing phase, where the dog can behave in an off leash situation 100% of the time. If Fido is off leash and he knows the ""Come command"", but he's in the park, off leash, and he dashes off against that cute Poodle but gets hit by a car, do you think you'll feel better than you never corrected him or tested him under distractions in different settings and different situations? This is real world. It's first, taught by food reward and ball reward. It's taught as a game. But later on, it's a command and not a request, but as the word implies: a command, or that is, a demand.  The only want to proof a dog is to combine positive methods with correction based methods. This is not the old Koehler based ""yank-and-crank"" correction method only. It's  a hybrid approach of positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement, but only after the dog already fully understand what is demanded of him, not sooner. This is a realistic way to teach a dog.

This video is one of a series of videos. The newer videos with Michael Ellis combine this method with the clicker based method, and the difference between the 1996 and the 2006 video is the newer clicker based approach is added into the picture. But basically, the information is sound, logically presented. He is well worth the cost of the videos. Nobody breaks down  behavior and innnate drives (such as prey drive, pack drive, play drive, defense drive) the way Ed does. Nobody. He's the best. If you are serious about learning Schutzhund and competition level obedience, his videos are some of the best on the subject. I own the entire collection. But this video and the ""8 week-to-8month' puppy video and the ""Pack Structure with Family Pet"" are the 3 MUST have videos for the dog owner, whether you choose to go to more serious competition based system later on or not.

My only criticism is that the older videos, such as with Bernard Flicks ""building drive and focus"" and the video with Tom Rose on ""Training Competition Heeling Dog"", and the original 1996 Obedience video were as much about demonstrating as well discussion. I think the new video is too much talking and not enough demonstration as much as the earlier videos. I think however that he's packaged so much information into 4 hours, that you have taken 3 months of working with a professional trainer into a 4 hour video at a much lower cost than working with a professional trainer. Overall, I think Ed is one of the best teachers. Training a dog is easy. Teaching humans to undertand how to do it is hard.  He's one of the best. Period!",1405814400,,3630,4.541284403669724

The pack mentality theory was based on studying wolves in captivity. When scientists began studying wolves in the wild they realized that they actually function as a family and not a pack with a hierarchy. Also, all dogs can be trained with positive methods and be successful, there is no need to use force or cause pain. Try reading up on trainers such as Dr. Sophia Yin or Karen Pryor.

3117720,5,B0013LUDKC,"This is a DVD I purchased along with 2 others from Ed Frawley.  He is so awesome with showing the do's and dont's of training your dog to be the best he/she can be.  He is very dedicated to what he does and has a great background and a love for animals. I have used his techniques from this basic training DVD with my German Shepherd. She was totally out of control, hard headed, head strong, aggressive, very protective of me (since she became my service dog because I have seizures) I knew I HAD to have some help with getting her under control.  Unfortunately my husband didn't see anything wrong with her behavior, but I was with her 24/7 and he was only with her after work and on weekends. He thought her aggressiveness was ""cool"" and thought German shepherds were suppose to ""be like that"". We adopted her at 1 year old from the adoption center, 3 years ago.  We were told that who had to give her up for adoption was in some part of law enforcement and had her in training as a drug dog or a dog that would sniff out bombs, etc, but he had to return to the Middle East and she was not allowed to go with him. So I was desperate and after contacting some local dog trainers, I was told by each one, that she was not one that could be rehabilitated.  I knew I could not afford services from Ceasar Milan, but would have loved to have his help.  So I took the step of looking for something to help me help her.  I found these DVDs to watch over and over again, to get directions to rehabilitate my dog.  After applying the techniques from this DVD the very first time, my dog was responding to the simple commands immediately. As each day went by, she was responding more and more, and quite quickly I might add.  Today, I still use the techniques and she is a very different dog. I am so proud of her. And I thank Ed Frawley very much for sharing the right techniques on basic training for your dog. Mr. Frawley, you have given my dog the chance to be taken down the right path. She was so out of control that I was told by a dog trainer, that said she could not be helped and I had 2 choices...give her back to the adoption center or put her down.  Thank God, I did not listen to him. I love my dog, she is my child...I would NEVER have put her down. Now I have my dog back, the way she was before she got out of control during the time of me recovering from brain surgery and traumatic brain injury. She is an awesome and loving dog!!!",1379116800,,2443,4.12421052631579
3117721,2,B0013LUDKC,"I purchased this DVD expecting to have instructional demonstrations on basic obedience training, not to watch Ed Frawley sit on his chair lecturing.  I can get books, if all I get is some talk about training.  I find DVDs to be more useful if people actually SHOW you the step-by-step process of dog training.  As well, he likes to promote his website and what he sells on this DVD.  Definitely a no-go for me.  Go to the library and check out dog training books and save your money.

3117731,5,B0013LUDKC,"I searched quite a few hours for a training video or book that I felt would be helpful and that was provided by someone with experience with dog training and not someone that just happened to be particularly popular.  I found more popular trainers with a lot less training than I would have liked.  This DVD is very specific and covers alot of ground, you will not be able to get through this in one sitting and you will spend weeks upon weeks covering everything and utlilizing the information here over and over.  There are some aspects of training that I wanted to steer clear of (choke chains) etc and I appreciate that these DVD's do not focus on that specific type of correction, it gives you options and helps you understand how it applies directly to your dog and your situation.  As we all know, every dog is different.  This DVD has helped me to establish boundaries in  my house with my dogs and has given me the tools to knowing how to train them, how to understand if they need correction and if so, how to provide that correction without harming my relationship with my dog or forfeiting my ability to stay the master of the relationship.  I would recommend this video to someone like myself who needs guidance training their dog, who really wants to put the time into it and reap the rewards.  I had issues with a dominant dog and it has been wonderful understanding her so much better and being able to control her behavior, she is much happier as well as I.",1321574400,,1474,4.4535315985130115
3117732,5,B0013LUDKC,"I own an ""old"" VHS version of this production, what looks like it came out of the ark.  I'm certain this VHS version is quite out of date, unlike the DVD version, which appears to have been updated somewhat.  Regardless of this corny oldie, but goodie, the information is still quite relevant.  Using and applying the training techniques helped me and one of my female American Bulldogs achieve her CGC (Canine Good Citizen) certificate.  It has also made for an easier to control and better behaved dog overall.  That makes life much more pleasant for everyone, including the dog!  Good stuff!  Yes there are a lot of people out there that may disagree with Ed's methods.  If you want PetSmart training, then by all means, take your dog to PetSmart, but if you want someone with a law enforcement background, who has spent years training and formulating his own methods, and has a good understanding of dog behavior, give Leerburg a try.  It works!",1300406400,,949,4.737804878048781

3117735,5,B0013LUDKC,"We've enjoyed putting into practice some of the things in this training DVD with our dog. It's too bad that most of us will never purchase a product like this until we run into difficulties. I've had dogs all my life and never knew half of the stuff Frawley is teaching. I realize now that though we've had good experiences with our dogs, our experiences could have been much better if we had understood more in the way of what makes a dog ""tick."" The dog we have now (the reason for buying this and a number of other Leerburg DVDs) has become much more respectful toward our teenage daughter since she's been changing the way she treats the dog.

We also purchased the one about pack structure for the family dog, and that's a must as well. We've learned that our daughter's deferential treatment of this dog, whom she loves, was causing the dog to see her as an inferior pack member and causing the aggression problem which was our reason for the purchase. If you're only going to get one of these rather expensive videos, get the pack structure one. The alternative for us was having the dog put down, and that would have really hurt.

Oh yes . . . I should mention that Frawley has decades of experience in the real world and is not an actor playing a dog trainer or a celebrity dog psychologist. Some of the things (like ""alpha rolling"") advocated by these better-known trainers may be okay with a gentle (and small) dog, but with a harder dog could lose you your face. So be warned. I was advised to have our daughter ""alpha roll"" our dog, but had the sense to stop her when I sensed the dog's impending reaction. After having watched some of the Leerburg DVDs and heard some of his stories about this practice, I'm very, very glad we didn't push that one.",1262131200,,1762,4.418461538461538

As we all know, every dog is different.  This DVD has helped me to establish boundaries in  my house with my dogs and has given me the tools to knowing how to train them, how to understand if they need correction and if so, how to provide that correction without harming my relationship with my dog or forfeiting my ability to stay the master of the relationship.  I would recommend this video to someone like myself who needs guidance training their dog, who really wants to put the time into it and reap the rewards.  I had issues with a dominant dog and it has been wonderful understanding her so much better and being able to control her behavior, she is much happier as well as I.",1321574400,,1474,4.4535315985130115
3352229,5,B0013LUDKC,"I own an ""old"" VHS version of this production, what looks like it came out of the ark.  I'm certain this VHS version is quite out of date, unlike the DVD version, which appears to have been updated somewhat.  Regardless of this corny oldie, but goodie, the information is still quite relevant.  Using and applying the training techniques helped me and one of my female American Bulldogs achieve her CGC (Canine Good Citizen) certificate.  It has also made for an easier to control and better behaved dog overall.  That makes life much more pleasant for everyone, including the dog!  Good stuff!  Yes there are a lot of people out there that may disagree with Ed's methods.  If you want PetSmart training, then by all means, take your dog to PetSmart, but if you want someone with a law enforcement background, who has spent years training and formulating his own methods, and has a good understanding of dog behavior, give Leerburg a try.  It works!",1300406400,,949,4.737804878048781
3352230,5,B0013LUDKC,"I love this training dvd. Simple to understand, and I like the fact that it has different sections and you can choose what to watch. (like the sit command or down command)So if you need to go back and watch a certain section you can, instead of having to watch a whole video again to try to find the topic you need to watch.",1294012800,,324,4.078125
3352231,5,B0013LUDKC,You have to go to the Leerburg website. It has thousands of useful articules about dog training and behavior management. This is the best training DVD that I have seen- The next best thing to my dogs' trainers- Missy and Cameron! Buy it!,1263945600,,237,4.534883720930233
3352232,5,B0013LUDKC,"We've enjoyed putting into practice some of the things in this training DVD with our dog. It's too bad that most of us will never purchase a product like this until we run into difficulties. I've had dogs all my life and never knew half of the stuff Frawley is teaching. I realize now that though we've had good experiences with our dogs, our experiences could have been much better if we had understood more in the way of what makes a dog ""tick."" The dog we have now (the reason for buying this and a number of other Leerburg DVDs) has become much more respectful toward our teenage daughter since she's been changing the way she treats the dog.

We also purchased the one about pack structure for the family dog, and that's a must as well. We've learned that our daughter's deferential treatment of this dog, whom she loves, was causing the dog to see her as an inferior pack member and causing the aggression problem which was our reason for the purchase. If you're only going to get one of these rather expensive videos, get the pack structure one. The alternative for us was having the dog put down, and that would have really hurt.

Oh yes . . . I should mention that Frawley has decades of experience in the real world and is not an actor playing a dog trainer or a celebrity dog psychologist. Some of the things (like ""alpha rolling"") advocated by these better-known trainers may be okay with a gentle (and small) dog, but with a harder dog could lose you your face. So be warned. I was advised to have our daughter ""alpha roll"" our dog, but had the sense to stop her when I sensed the dog's impending reaction. After having watched some of the Leerburg DVDs and heard some of his stories about this practice, I'm very, very glad we didn't push that one.",1262131200,,1762,4.418461538461538
8252050,5,B0013LUDKC,I like the straight forward approach on dog training but I'm only 1/4 into watching it.,1519084800,,87,4.5
8252051,1,B0013LUDKC,All I can say for this it did come on time. however there was not obedience training on the DVD just a commercial telling me to go online. Since I was in a DVD player and not online that wsa not practical. If you buy this expecting anything other than a commercial do not buy it.,1508630400,,279,4.0

8252058,3,B0013LUDKC,Ok here we go and this is true. Ok leerburg videos are the best or one of the best resource DVDs out here. Yes most are old transfers from vhs but clean with wind noise. With this said you are not going to become a pro by watching this or any other video but it will help you lay the ground work needed for you and your family pack member.,1438646400,,339,3.857142857142857
