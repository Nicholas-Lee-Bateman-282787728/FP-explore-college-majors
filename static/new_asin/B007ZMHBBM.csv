5115141,4,B007ZMHBBM,"This has been circulating among bootleg collectors for years, and finally we get a ""first gen"" copy of the complete show with remastered sound. Having seen this before there aren't any surprises. There are a few caveats. Sometimes the video quality is not the best, and sometimes it's spectacular. The performances are very loose and at times chaotic, as musicians jump on and off the low stage with tables right up to the edge. And other times the music is as tight and brilliant as the blues can be. When the Stones show up and begin jamming, the band picks it up a notch, especially the rhythm section that does a fantastic job keeping this from becoming completely out of control. Muddy is not in good health at this time in  his life (he passes away two years after this show), and he spends most of the show sitting on a stool on stage. But when the band rips into Mannish Boy, Muddy can't keep his seat. He's up and jumping like he's a  young man again, and we see a glimpse of the power and majesty that the man possessed. During part of the show, Mick and Muddy take a seat to allow Jr. Wells (not bad, he should play the harmonica more), Buddy Guy (always a treat), and a drunken Lefty Dizz take turns at center stage. Yes, Dizz is drunk, and ends his feature song standing at the edge of the stage, flailing his arms around, saying or singing something to the audience without a microphone. You can't hear what he's saying but the band and the audience's reactions range from amusement to horror. Wells has to take the stage and literally push Dizz off stage. But it's great that whole sequence is included to give you the complete feel of the evening. No, it doesn't really cast a pall on the rest of the show by any means. It's just comic relief. The very best part of the whole video is the guitar playing and solos from Wood, Richards, Waters, Guy, and the guitarists in Muddy's band ain't shabby either. It really looks like it was a fun evening and one that the members of the audience probably are still talking about to this day. I am not a big fan of concert videos, but this one is fun to watch.

The bonus features are cuts from the Hampton 1981 PPV and are nice to have, but again this has been circulating for years. The DVD does not include the whole show, and the songs are edited to take out the dead spots when musicians are going on stage and strapping on a guitar in the middle of the song. Be grateful the whole show isn't on the CD; trust me on that.",1341964800,73,2482,4.310492505353319
5115142,2,B007ZMHBBM,"This could of have been a stellar event. Instead it is merely a satisfactory superstar blues jam. I would rather they edited it down to 20 minutes because as soon as a STINKING drunk and OBNOXIOUS Lefty Dizz walks onstage, ALL momentum stops and all the good vibes are killed instantly. His presence on this disc is a blot that cannot be overcome. The few songs with Mick and Muddy, Keef and Woody are fun, not spectacular..its a loose blues jam...and Buddy Guy steals the show despite his seriously out of tune guitar. A must have I suppose, for Stones completists and HARDCORE blues fans but not for the casual fan or the un-initiated. Again BE WARNED....When LEFTY DIZZ walks onstage, he RUINS the show.",1341878400,55,706,4.656
5115143,4,B007ZMHBBM,"Awesome Show!!! Lefty was obnoxious though, and you could read it on the faces and in the actions of the band. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. It must have been some record label/ management  spotlight deal with him; he certainly didn't earn it. What could have been was reduced when this guy got on stage. I still highly recommend it though; when it's cookin' it is COOKIN'!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1341878400,14,405,4.5479452054794525
5115144,5,B007ZMHBBM,"Apparently there have been bootleg tapes of this 1981 performance, when legendary blues guitarist Muddy Waters was booked into Buy Guy's Chicago ""juke joint"" (small club with tables right up against the small stage) and Mick, Keith and Ron showed up for front row seats. But this first ""official"" release (with wonderful brand new sound restoration) is the first time I've seen it. It's truly a historical moment and Eagle Vision has given it a nice packaging and a very reasonable price. (The DVD itself is under $15.00 and the combo pack with the audio CD with 11 of the 13 numbers is only five bucks more.

The whole show lasts 106 minutes though, in reality, there are two numbers up front by Waters band, without the Hootchie Cootchie Man himself. And while Jagger, Richards and Wood are on stage with Waters for quite a few songs, both Waters and Jagger leave the stage for two songs by guitarist/vocalist Lefty Dizz, though Wood and Richards remain on stage. Oh, I forgot the Junior Wells gets to squeeze on the small stage as well.

Waters sings his classics and plays on some of them (he puts away the guitar for a few numbers).

The camera work is super with nice close ups and you can really enjoy Waters and Jagger riffing with each other.

The DVD adds two bonus performances and an 8 page booklet with some photos and an essay by Robert Gordon that - in text - pretty much describes what you see on your screen.

Definitely a must-have for both Blues fans and Stones fans.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5115145,5,B007ZMHBBM,"The little stage that could hold the biggest of giants! That is what you could get & the Checkerboard Lounge. I was born & raised in Chicago & have been to most of the clubs in the area. What a show this is people! This is a piece of history you hold in your hands if you have bought this. This is Southside Chicago 423 E. 43d Street to be exact that Buddy Guy owned & now owns Buddy Guys Legends at 700 South Wabash Avenue. On this stage on this night on this dvd & cd you have nothing but legends like Muddy Waters, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, Ian Stewart, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells & Chicago legend John Primer who still plays often at Legends who i have met & hung out with some at a few places. This is a awesome dvd/cd set! The picture is better then i thought it would be too But the sound of the recording is amazing. Very loud upfront clear recording. Every song on this set is killer Muddy Waters. I am so glad they tapped this show i just wish this came out 30 years ago. But at least they did it right & have done a great job on the mastering. What can be better then the man who came up with the line Like A Rolling Stone to play with the Rolling Stones in a small club on the southside of chicago not far from where chess records first recorded Muddy Waters & then still get Buddy Guy & Junior wells on stage too. This is the best of the best playing low down sweet home chicago style blues. just listening to blues music is not the same feeling as going to the Southside Of Chicago & going to one of these blues clubs but this cd & dvd set makes me feel like i'm right there & i can smell the home cooked food & spilled beer. This just may be the greatest blues album to ever exist to man. Long Live Chicago Blues Baby!",1341619200,25,1746,4.005730659025788

  This show is Fantastic!!! The Fact that they are now making an Oficial Release with remasterted sound can only make this that much better!!!!
  If You Love the Stones,Muddy Waters or the Blues in General....This is a Must Have...
  Watch Keith walk the length of the table to get onstage when he is called up....and let's not forget the Late Great Ian Stewart right at home on the piano...

5115150,3,B007ZMHBBM,"Muddy and his band play great until ole rubber lips takes the stage and tries to upstage him.  This concert was right around the time that Jagger's brain formulated the opinion that he was too big for the Stones, and needed to go out on his own to become a bigger rock star.  We all know how that turned out.  If you want to see and hear some great Muddy Waters live, without distractions, Muddy Waters - Classic Concerts, is fantastic.  Three killer shows from the 1960s and 1970s, with GREAT back-up.  My rating further explained: Muddy, 5 stars; Muddy and MICK, 2 stars; Lefty Dizz, 0 star.  Now there's an idea - a drunk Lefty Dizz and Mick Jagger duo.  Let's see who upstages who.",1471564800,,685,4.388888888888889

5115205,5,B007ZMHBBM,"WOW!  I saw this on PBS months ago and recorded it on my DVR.  Upon recently viewing it again I must say, Muddy with the Stones together is not only a great combination of talent, but is also a stunning portrayal of what the blues is all about.  There are many styles on display here, from the basic riffs in ""Mannish Boy,"" the upbeat swing of ""Baby Please Don't Go,"" and everything in between.  It is all here.

When Muddy sings in ""Mannish Boy,"" ""I'm a rolling stone..."" you can tell that Mick is truly beside himself.  The Stones were greatly influenced by Muddy and other blues greats, and at this performance you can tell that they are overjoyed to be sharing the stage with him.

I really like the intimate feel of the small club they performed at.  At this point in the Stones' career they were mostly playing stadiums and large arenas.  Here they could have shook hands with the audience, that's how close they were.  Also the looseness and freeness of the show is very neat -- for example, when Muddy calls up each member  of the Stones individually.  That was cool.

I highly recommend this for any fan of the Stones, the blues, or music in general.  It is absolutely necessary on all levels.",1402790400,2,1202,4.454128440366972

5115221,2,B007ZMHBBM,"My feeling, watching Mick Jagger preening himself and pranceing around next to Muddy Waters, was that he was an embarresment, to himself and to Rock N Roll. He tried to upstage him, and by putting on the fake souther accent he tries to sing with, shaking his hair around like he is filming an add for head and shoulders shampoo- I felt sad for Muddy Waters. Someone like Springsteen or Dylan would have been completely respectful of their boyhood idols, but Mick Jagger is always worried about how he looks himself, like a concieted girl. He is more like  Madonna than he is Dylan or Springsteen. It made me feel that Mick Jagger was thinking this as he shared the stage: ""This here bloke might be the authentic, real thing, and I may have gotten about a billion times richer and more famous than he is by ripping him off like I did, but hey, I am better looking than he is, and thats all that counts. He must feel lucky that I came here to share my fabulous fame with him. But its OK, because I will get 90% of whatever money comes in from this DVD, and he will get almost nothing, like before. After all, I am a rock star.""",1384560000,8,1125,4.28169014084507

As more Chicago blues greats get on the stage, Ron and Keith become increasingly less important.  Mick looks like a fool in his tennis outfit.

The respect they show for Muddy Waters is palpable and Muddy's enjoyment of them brought tears to my eyes. What's even more marvelous is that none of it was planned and that is very obvious from the reactions of the performers and the audience. Muddy Waters' performance was being filmed and the Stones just came in to the Lounge to see him - seredipity at its finest.",1382227200,,534,4.459183673469388

5115228,5,B007ZMHBBM,"Muddy recorded Catfish Blues in 1949. 12 years later, (1961) a little group of blues fans in England got together, formed a a band, took a line from Muddy's song for their name and became ""The Rolling Stones"" They played the Black Man's Blues they heard in the UK and brought it to segregated America. When they 1st came to the US, the Stones were asked if the would like anything special and Mick said ""Yes, We want to meet Howlin' Wolf"" and they said ""Who is that?"" Americans only allowed white boys on the radio in the United States in those days. The entire British invasion that followed was just English musicians playing those blues they had heard and copied, and they called it Rock & Roll. This night in Buddy Guy's little Checerboard Lounge on the South side of Chicago in November of 1981 was the Stones paying homage to their mentor and Muddy recognized the respect and invited them on stage with him. The rest is history",1381104000,,933,4.4941176470588236

5115233,5,B007ZMHBBM,"Bought this DVD based on all the great reviews and I wasn't disappointed.  A great night of blues was captured here, in terrific sound.  I wasn't expecting the sound to be as good as it was, but in both the DVD and the CD it was absolutely clear as could be.  Seeing Muddy play guitar was a special treat for me, as I've never seen him play.  I've always been a casual fan of his -mostly seeing him guest in other's films without his guitar -The Last Waltz comes to mind.  When I first received this, I played the CD first in my car, and was impressed with the fidelity of the recording, an of course the performances were terrific.  After listening to the CD for a few months on and off, I finally took the time to play the DVD and discovered how much I was missing!  Besides the extra tracks, I was finally able to see which musician played which parts, as there are several guests coming and going throughout the show.  The guitar solos from Buddy Guy and Keith Richards were particularly great, but the occasional lead from Ronny Wood and then Lefty Dizz were also wonderful.  Muddy's brief guitar blasts were a revelation to me.  Like a hurricane coming through.  Awesome.  As a fan of electric blues, I couldn't be more happy with this purchase.  As for the video quality, it's 1981 in a small Chicago club, so with that caveat, I think it was shot about as well as it could have been.  There's 3 cameras, and I never felt like a moment was missed.  Considering the constraints of space and lighting and video tape, it was very well done.  However, it's the sound that makes this video worth having.",1377907200,,1605,4.389830508474576

Muddy invites them up to join him onstage, and a superbly loose and intense collaboration ensues.  Muddy, of course, is always in charge, but he gives Keith and Mick plenty of room to work with him and showcase their talents as well.

5115247,5,B007ZMHBBM,"I'll let the poets give this the justice it deserves. But I'll just call it indispensable.  The Stones, reaching the end of their peak, having recently released Some Girls, pay a visit to the Checkerboard Lounge in a act of reverence and gratitude. Too bad they didn't also bring the suitcase full of cash they owe Muddy. The performances here are amazing...... touching, funny, brilliant and just a perfect pure reminder of where this all came from and how it started. A shot of Muddy singing ' like a Rolling Stone ',during ""Mannish Boy"", with Mick next to him on stage is absolutely  mesmerizing. And the irony is not lost on Muddy. Jammed onto this tiny stage, this is as much about the characters as about the music and performances.
Muddy's like Don Corleone, with Mick almost a yippitty dog at his feet. Keef is looking whiter than the KKK  but playing amazing. and you can see what a gifted player Ronnie Wood is. They both look like teenagers having the time of their lives.  and who could blame them?  The cameos are priceless, from a Sam Cooke like Junior Wells to a drunken Lefty Dizz, who provides much of the humor. He's also quite an amazing guitarist.  Looking weak is Buddy Guy, who, looking like he just climbed down from a mountain of blow, can't seem to get in sync or even in groove with a couple of white guys. What's great and comical however, is the lack of deference paid to the Stones, they're welcomed but they're not considered the evening's stars. Love it love it love it. and the can of Old Style on the piano makes it perfect!
So much is owed to Mr. Muddy Waters, may he rest in peace, as he is sorely missed.",1370131200,,1640,4.45

5115258,5,B007ZMHBBM,"I SO wish I could say I attended this performance. This was the very performance when they raised the cover charge for the Checkerboard Lounge from $2 to $5.

I did attend the very next night, a Blue Monday jam, hosted by Lefty Dizz as usual. I walked in just as Lefty and Junior Wells were wailing at the same time. Buddy Guy, Johnny Twist, and Hubert Sumlin also played, deep into the night. Buddy Guy was the owner of the Checkerboard: Lefty Dizz and Junior Wells were partners. All were regular performers.

Muddy Waters was at this time playing mainly at larger venues, but as he observes early in this video, this night was very much a homecoming for him. As you can see, the Stones reacted to the Checkerboard in much the way I reacted whenever I went there: with a sense of awe. It was different from the sense of awe one gets in a cathedral, though: this wasn't a holy relic to be revered in a glass case, this was awe mixed with fun, joy, humor, and laughter. You knew this was IT, this was the real thing, this was where the blues are the blues are the blues. Enjoy them, without qualification. As an out-of-town friend observed, ""If we had this in Ohio, we'd be there every night!""

Dan Aykroyd thought that the Checkerboard should have been made a national monument. I agree, but it's too late now, it having been demolished years ago, unsurprisingly for safety code violations. There still is Buddy Guy's new place, Legends. And we do still have this video!

If I could rely on the company of Lefty Dizz, Junior Wells, Hubert Sumlin, and Muddy Waters in Heaven, and if I could get into Heaven by being good, I'd be good.",1366329600,2,1634,4.4186046511627906

Led Zeppeling, The Rolling Stones, The Allman Brothers Band, and many more based a lot of their music on the Delta Blues.  If you listen closely, some are basically covers of the Delta Blues.

We traveled to Clarksdale, Mississippi which is considered to be the birthplace of the Delta Blues.  The museum there has a wonderful exhibit on Muddy Waters including references to the Rolling Stones.  This CD/DVD combo brought it full circle.  This was a once in a lifetime event.

Muddy is my hero in the blues,as The Stones are my number 1 band( I have their logo - mouth and tongue - tattooed on my right arm).So,a match marriage made in heaven,You think?Well,not really so.

I'm a huge Mick fan but that night he was just too silly as he was on basically that whole tour they were on at the time of this show in Chicago.
Mr Jagger was just trying too hard and you can see him wildly smiling at Muddy for no apparent reason along with the fake 'gum chewing' thing that he's done a few times that I've seen.

There were some great moments at that show but without Mick overdoing it, it could have been a fabulous 'Muddy' show.

Sorry Mick. Nobody does what you do nearly as good as you do but that night you should have stayed in your seat and had a couple of Guiness Stout's. The anticipation of the crowd would have been more of a legend.",1363996800,7,887,4.091954022988506

5115283,5,B007ZMHBBM,"Don't get me wrong here - I like them, and their appearance here certainly spices up this set - but perhaps the Stones' most important contribution here is their appearance itself. Without that, we probably would not have this filmed document at all. But, thankfully, we do. And what we have is the undisputed king of Chicago Blues, with his band, playing virtually at ground zero of the blues world, the Checkerboard Lounge on the South Side. This is a stunning document of the power of Chicago Blues in all it's raw glory, and perhaps the best film of authentic blues music I have ever seen (with the possible exception of some segments of the American Folk Blues Festival releases). Incredible!",1361059200,,697,4.768595041322314

5115287,2,B007ZMHBBM,"I'm a fan of both Muddy Waters and The Stones but as I suspected when I first saw this DVD here, the two groups together didn't exactly hit it off. To me, the Stones were clearly out of their environment as they tried to be blues guys. Sure, anyone can play the blues but only a few (like Muddy Waters) were/are exceptionally good doing it.

  What baffles me as why there aren't any good DVDs of Muddy and Johnny Winter as those 2 were great together in the mid-late 70s.",1360195200,6,472,4.222222222222222

Ignore any negative reviews- this is an absolute delight for blues fans!  Beautifully remastered, sharp video and crisp sound.  Imagine those being lucky enough to have been there on that Sunday night in November, 1981, when the Rolling Stones showed up at Buddy Guy's blues club on the south side of Chicago.  Tiny club, tiny stage crowded with legends Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ron Wood, and others.

For those of us who weren't lucky enough to be there on that magic evening, this is the next best thing- this video is so good you almost feel like you are there.

If you appreciate unscripted, raw live performances, you will be really pleased.  I'm wondering what took them so long to officially release this- what a treat!",1358726400,,1056,6.046979865771812

5115320,5,B007ZMHBBM,"Thankfully this event and it's subsquent taping/recording occurred prior to the digital/twitter age. Otherwise the insuing riot/stampede that would have occurred would have overshadowed the performance itself. I saw Muddy Waters a couple of years before this event took place, and had seen the Stones previosly as well. It was interesting to see how energetic Muddy was, and how reserved/respectful the Stones were. If you appreciate the Blues and it's influence on the Rock Genre, this performance is a well worthwhile addition to your collection.

Aside from the Mick/Muddy duets, Keith & Ron Wood guitar riffs, the additional Chicago Bluesmen (Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, & Lefty Diz) make this one helluva jam! Too bad the CD doesn't include all the material covered on the DVD. Again this is a worthwhile addition to one's collection if no other reason it was a once in a lifetime event. Chicago still buzzes with anticipation of a similar occurrance everytime the Stones come to town.",1356912000,,987,5.130434782608695

It is a superb historical primary source that shows the Stones at the height of their powers but they were upstaged by a brilliant Muddy Waters & a superb Buddy Guy et al. Mick's rock star posing looked out of place in a real blues club alongside real deal bluesmen. One outstanding feature for me was seeing Ian Stewart rocking it out on piano, he truly was the heart & soul of this band.

5115329,5,B007ZMHBBM,Very good DVD and CD set.  Everything looks and sounds crisp and new instead of dated like the original bootleg tapes apparently did.  Watch the DVD I just couldn't stop thinking how those people who paid their minor door fee back in the 80's to see Muddy Waters suddenly found themselves treated to the Stones too.  Talk about the most bang for the buck.  This is all very cool,1356220800,,378,4.434782608695652

It traded heavily on VHS in the 80's and 90's under the title ""Champagne & Reefer"" but the sound and video quality this issue is so far superior to those as to allow me to toss all previous copies. Muddy is just wonderful here. ""Pops"" was nearing the end of the road and in two short years whould be gone but he still had his mojo working and he shows it off for all to see. Jagger isn't really all that impressive or maybe is just overwhelmed by some truly legendary blues men on this night. Junior Wells and Buddy Guy rip it up and Keith and Ronnie are just having a ball. Lefty Dizz is on fire and while virtually unknown to almost all but hardcore blues fans accords himself very well here.
This is an historic document of just one night in the lives of these men but it was one hell of a night and is a must have for any fan of American blues.",1355443200,2,942,4.06989247311828

5115336,5,B007ZMHBBM,"Muddy Waters was one of the finest Chicago Blues Players ever to lay fingers to strings.  He inspired countless musicians and bands to seek a career in Blues or blues-related fields, including the Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Eric Clapton and countless others.  In his later years he ended up opening for many of these bands...a travesty as the bands knew who was the teacher and who was the student.  Many made the statement that the situation should be reversed with them opening for Muddy.  Live at the Checkerboard Lounge featured Muddy in good form, doing what he did best.  The Rolling Stones went to the show, got invited to sit in and the rest is history.  Any video featuring Muddy Waters is worth buying, without exception.  This one is prime, indeed!",1355184000,,761,4.763358778625954

5115338,5,B007ZMHBBM,"This DVD is one of a kind. A great group of musicians playing off one another and obviously having a good time doing it. The audio and video are done really well when you consider this performance was 30 years ago. Several reviews made negative comments about Lefty Dizz's performance but he is an incredible guitar player and certainly not the only one onstage that had a few cocktails. Lefty was able to play a standard right handed guitar upside down without having it restrung, truly a talented musician. The impromptu style of this performance is what makes it such an amazing show!",1354406400,,587,4.70873786407767
5115339,5,B007ZMHBBM,"Muddy was the best. I also saw Lefty Dizz, sat in with his band and played his right handed guitar. I met Buddy Guy at the Checkerboard, and saw Junior Wells and the rollings tones many times. I started screaming like the Bears just won the Superbowl with a goal line stand when I started watching this video. There is a great moment in this video when Lefty is takin' a solo during a song Muddy is singin' and is gettin' ready to CLOWN and he points to himself and looks at Muddy as to say ""Can I go another 12 ??"" Muddy smiles, points to himself, and starts singing. I know Lefty had the ultimate respect for Muddy as did everyone. It still boggles my mind to this day that I never heard anyone ever say a bad thing about Muddy Waters 'cause all those guys loved to talk $h! t about everybody. Subtitles/closed caption was fun !!

5115345,5,B007ZMHBBM,"This is a wonderful DVD (plus a CD) of a concert at Checkerboard Lounge in Chicago (Buddy Guy's club). The DVD begins with a couple blues songs--""Sweet Little Angel"" and ""Flip Flop and Fly."" Nice playing, but I was wondering--""Where is Muddy Waters."" Then, Muddy heads to the stage and we see him perform with his band. Wonderful blues playing, with ""You Don't Have to Go"" and ""Country Boy."" The club provides a claustrophobic feel--small room where people sit almost on top of one another. People are lined up at the entrance, and are admitted as others leave.

The show really gets rolling during ""Baby Please Don't Go,"" as we see four Stones enter--Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, and Ian Stewart. When Waters sees them, he invites them to stage. In a way, this is eminently appropriate, since the Rolling Stones took their name from one of Waters' songs and since the Rolling Stones had extolled the virtues of Muddy Waters as an influence on their work (and sometimes had his songs in their play list). One of the touching aspects of this DVD is what appears to be genuine affection and warmth between the old blues warrior and his musical progeny, an unlikely band of Englishmen.

We see  Richards and Wood playing with Waters' band on a number of songs; Waters invites Stewart to play the piano. Jagger and Waters play off of one another on the vocals. Making the video more enjoyable--more guests, including legends like Buddy Guy and Junior Wells who join in the music. The small stage features players leaving to make room for new players. The improvisational quality of the concert is most pleasurable.

And the songs? It's hard to beat ""Mannish Boy,"" ""Hoochie Coochie Man,""  ""Got My Mojo Working,"" ""Champagne and Reefer,"" and so on. One feature that I especially enjoyed was the various guitar players playing off of one another--Wood, Richards, Lefty Dizz, Guy, and Waters himself at some points, among others.

The quality of the DVD is pretty good, given that it was captured in 1981.

All in all, a terrific and energetic concert. It was telling to see the obvious influence that blues legends like Muddy Waters had on the Rolling Stones. And how naturally they played the blues. An hour and a half worth of music that seemed to last only moments as the performance unfolded. . . .",1353974400,6,2307,4.7525

I almost felt like I hadn't seen it before.  Of course bootleg material is usually sub-standard, but I thought the most recent version was pretty darn good.  Turns out there was a lot of room for improvement, and this disc delivered.  Don't forget, the recording is from 30+ years ago, and it's not professionally filmed.  It was probably shot on the usual in-house video system.  So don't expect ""Shine a Light"" quality, but it's very good; all things considered.

5115356,5,B007ZMHBBM,"I think I have all available videos on Muddy Waters but in many ways this one is the best for the following reasons.

1.  This is the last recording that Muddy made before his death 2 years later
2.  We actually get to see the most popular tribute band play with the Man that wrote the song that they named their group After.
3.  We get a real treat in seeing Lefty Dizz of Chicago fame who  passed on in 1993 and who in  his life  worked with such greats as Hound Dog Taylor , Jr. Wells ,and John Lee Hooker.  To my  knowledge, nothing else on DVD is available on Lefty although There are a few videos available on you tube. It is the viewers luck that we get  a glimpse of this great  musical talent,who besides his musical abilities  held a college degree in economics.  Lefty was the same performer on this video as he was in  his live shows .
4.  Many behind the scenes glimses of Muddy such as seeing his wife Marva sitting at the table with Muddy at his left  at the beginning of the video and later with the Stones and a full view of her at the end of the song Clouds in my heart.",1350777600,3,1088,4.037558685446009

5115367,5,B007ZMHBBM,"Well I had to settle for the comfort of my man cave and my flat screen Panasonic lol, when watching this live concert at Buddy Guy's Checkerboard Club in Chicago.

Everybody was crammed into the club like sardines in a can. Muddy Waters was up front and center perched on his chair belting out the blues with his band when in walks The Stones in town to perform their own gig. The boys saunter into the club, pull up a few chairs and settle in while Waters is warming up the crowd.

The Stones idolized Muddy Waters back in the 1960's when Muddy was touring spreading the blues gospel to the rest of the world. The connection was made back then between the blues and rock and roll as we have it today. The blues seed was planted and the Stones nurtured this style of music into their own style of music.

It doesn't take long before Muddy is coaxing Mick up to the stage to join in and next thing you know he has them all up jammin' as if their lives depended on it.

Other Blues Greats make their own way to the stage cramming it to over capacity to the delight of all those lucky dogs who were present. Lefty Dizz, Buddy Guy, and  Junior Wells to name a few.

It seemed like everybody in the house was on something that night, a high octane groove was in the air and the banter and swagger back and forth between the performers was electrifying.

It was a hoot watching Mick strutting his stuff, wagging his caboose and howling to match one of his peers. His  band mates coolly just played off to the side, chain smoking and rising forth when prompted to do so.

A few drinks later, a few fine performances past, the whole joint breaks loose. Lightening rarely strikes the same spot twice. Wish I could have been there to see history in the making.",1348272000,8,1750,4.2948328267477205

There will be nothing to replace being there, but this is really, really close.  I was not there that night but this album brings in so many of the incredible talents that helped define the music we listen to today, from the Stones to Raekwon. A very important part of any serious music collector.  It provides a bit of insight into the process that gave birth to contemporary music.

5115371,5,B007ZMHBBM,"What an amazing historic event and we didn't have to miss seeing it just because we were not there. Keith Richards and Mick Jagger began to hang out musically as teens because of some newly bought records of Mick that included ""Best of Muddy Waters""  and other iconic american blues guitarists that Keith desperately wanted to listen to. This Blues music brought them together and infused and inspired all of their early songs. Muddy Waters also influenced their name as it came from a song on an oft-played vinyl laying on the floor of their studio. They both idolized and revered Muddy Waters and blues men like Buddy Guy and Junior Wells. And in this video, they are all on stage together!!
Better yet, on stage at one time (and its a tiny stage) are Keith Richards (#4 Greatest Guitarist of all Time -- Rolling Stone Magazine); Buddy Guy (#23 Greatest Guitarist RS) and Muddy Waters (#49 RS) + Ronnie Wood (who regrettably is not on that list)...

5115378,5,B007ZMHBBM,"On a cold Chicago winter night, November 22, 1981, the Rolling Stones were in the midst of their huge Tattoo You tour and had a night off.  Hearing that the legendary Muddy Waters was playing a gig at Buddy Guy's Checkerboard Lounge, they decided to catch one of their blues idols act.  Before the night was over, Muddy had summoned Mick, Keith, Ronnie and Ian Stewart to the stage for a night of jamming to some blues classics.

Fortunately for those of us who were not fortunate enough to catch that historical performance, it was caught on camera and is now made available to us on DVD and CD to watch and listen to as we wish - and we'll all wish to watch and listen to it a lot.

The package includes 16 tracks on the DVD, eleven of which are featured on the CD.  Featured on both are classics like Baby Please Don't Go (a Boomerocity favorite),  Hoochie Coochie Man, and Clouds in My Heart.  The entire collection is blues - historic blues - as it should be played.  The icing on the cake is hearing it played by the likes of Muddy, Keith, Ronnie, Junior Wells and Buddy Guy.  Add Sir Mick to the mix on vocals and, Wow! History is taking place right before your very eyes and ears.

This collection is a must-have for any serious music fan or musicologist since a line of this magnitude is rarely caught on film for posterity.  Order it today and pick up a couple of extra copies in order to get some very early Christmas shopping done for the music nut on your shopping list.

The Stones are like kids who found a pony under the tree at christmas and Muddy smiles with the pride of a grandfather.

There seems to be some controversy about Left Dizz's performance and at first it also put me off until I realized that the Stones (and by extension us) are getting a peek at real blues (and jazz) where cutting contests are a key part of the jam culture.  These were an essential late night rites of passage where various players display their skills and showmanship to oneup the others on stage.  This isn't a genteel ""after you sir"" but a macho competition that Buddy Guy describes as the blues world in Chicago at the time.  Dizz may well be dead drunk but he can sure play a hell of a guitar and it was in rough and tumble competitions like this that many players developed the techniques that later blew us all away.

The Stones wanted the real blues.  They got it and so did we.",1343606400,3,1191,4.486111111111111

Phenomenal historical musical event. Muddy grinding away at his slide guitar while the Rolling Stones sit in the audience, waiting to be summoned to the stage by the legend, Muddy Waters.

Man, to be in the audience for this, now that was the ticket of the year.

5115386,4,B007ZMHBBM,"It's my understanding that this classic collaboration has been on the bootleg circuit for some time.  This is an authorized release by Eagle Vision.  The Checkerboard was a Southside juke joint owned by Chicago blues legend Buddy Guy (who also makes an appearance in a white suit and giant Afro).  The headliner was Mississippi blues god, Muddy Waters and his band.

After a couple songs led by piano man Lovie Lee, Waters takes charge and whips through some electric blues that he helped launch.  The grainy home movie style camera work shows a mostly empty long table in front of the tiny club and postage stamp sized stage.  During the 6th song, ""Baby Please Don't Go,"" the table begins to fill with 4 of the Stones, their girlfriends and assorted hangers-on.  First Mick, then Keith Richards, then Ron Wood and finally Ian Stewart all join in the jam.  Jagger hangs in for several tunes (yes he knows all the words), the highlight of which is Waters classic ""Mannish Boy.""  Fueled by cigarettes and Bourbon, Richards and Wood hang in for the long haul.  Waters takes a seat and the Stones table and others take over including Guy, Junior Wells and a stoned out of his gourd, Lefty Dizz.  I'm not familiar with Lefty but as zonked as he was, the man can play.  And from what I can tell, he plays a right handed guitar...left handed!

It might have been nice to have some crowd reaction shots when the Stones appeared, but alas no.  No big deal.  The film is in a squarish TV-style 4:3 aspect ratio on DVD and comes with audio options in Dolby Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS Digital Surround 5.1.  There are 3 bonus songs including one from the Stones at their appointed gig at the Hampton Coliseum.  If you're a blues lover, you have to have this classic one time show.  Here's a track listing:

1) Sweet Little Angel 2) Flip Flop And Fly 3) Muddy Waters Introduction 4) You Don t Have To Go 5) Country Boy 6) Baby Please Don't Go 7) Hoochie Coochie Man 8) Long Distance Call 9) Mannish Boy 10) Got My Mojo Working 11) Next Time You See Me 12) One Eyed Woman 13) Baby Please Don't Go (Instrumental) 14) Blow Wind Blow 15) Champagne & Reefer.",1342310400,9,2155,4.47948717948718
