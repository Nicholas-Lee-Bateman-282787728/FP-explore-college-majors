8633995,5,B00HO13GZY,I'm 37 and as a kid I would never forget this classic!,1413676800,,54,3.5833333333333335
8633996,5,B00HO13GZY,"Was introduced to this movie by a friend on Facebook.  Was overly surprised.  Very well directed with long, creepy shots down hallways and spiral staircases and the music was top notch.  All of the actors are on top of their game.  You may think you know everything that's happening, but 2/3's the way through, it really changes.  This movie deserves a lot more praise.",1412380800,2,369,4.703125
8633997,3,B00HO13GZY,Corny and sometimes boring. The scenery was nice but it was hard to watch. Characters really plucked my nerves. Some of the scenes were predictable. Seem like someone was practicing film making.,1409788800,,194,5.09375
8633998,5,B00HO13GZY,"Slumber Party Massacre, Halloween - If you like that sort of film then you'll love this one.  Somehow the poor-quality film adds to the atmosphere.",1396828800,,147,4.88
