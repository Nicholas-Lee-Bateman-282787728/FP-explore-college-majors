1011735,3,6305365121,"As a devoted Star Trek fan, I must say I enjoyed this film. It was the most humorous of all the Star Trek films and the special effects were great.  However, it was not without flaws.  The script was mediocre and the  plot had holes in it. The new enemies, the Son'a, were not nearly as  entertaining as the villanious Borg from the last Star Trek film, Star  Trek: First Contact. They seemed more like cranky old men rather than space  villains. This was a pretty good movie, but it wasn't as good as First  Contact, or it would have done better at the box office. I guess the odd  numbered Star Trek movie curse struck again.",922406400,,627,4.299145299145299

1011810,2,6305365121,"2.5 stars. For such a beloved TV franchise, Trek has been very poorly served on the big screen. Of the Original Cast movies, only Voyage Home is tolerable, because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Be honest -- the rest of the OCs are pretty dreadful. (I will never, ever, be able to fully cleanse my memory's palate of row row row your boat.) Of the TNGs, First Contact is okay, though, as others have pointed out, they all just play like two-parters of the TV show. At least the reboots try to look and feel like actual movies, though they have major flaws as well. This one isn't the worst in the bunch (see row row row your boat, above), but it's meh. As always, the science is ridiculous and the story lame, including: the old let's hide in this nebula ""cloud"" bit (so ably parodied by Galaxy Quest); the ""manual control"" joystick; an alien planet inexplicably inhabited by hummingbirds and llamas; bouts of excruciatingly cornball dialogue, including Data's unforgettably cheesy ""saddle up, lock and load""; and lots of sketchy acting from a cast that was getting pretty long in the tooth by this point (I feel I can say that, being a geezer myself). As  a Trek addict from way, way back I put up with it. I wish I didn't have to, though.",1501459200,,1247,4.517699115044247

1011812,3,6305365121,"Good movie, interesting story, but is Donna Murphy the worst actress on the planet? I've never seen anybody so one-dimensional and lifeless on screen before. Ugh. After awhile I just skipped through the scenes she was in.",1500508800,,221,5.0
1011813,3,6305365121,"Possible spoilers.  After the previous chapter in this on-going saga was one of the best, it is disappointing to find this one is one of the worst.  Surprisingly Jonathan Frakes (aka Cmd. Riker) directed both.  Reverting back to a PG film, the story languishes about a colony of less than 1000 people living a rudimentary life free of gizmos and technological advances.  They live on an Earth-like planet with Saturn-like rings.  Those rings contain a vital element that magically prevents aging once reaching adulthood.  The specifics are sketchy.

The Federation under Admiral Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) has partnered with Ruafo (F. Murray Abraham), a sinister leader of an allied planet.  Their species is dying out and wouldnt you know, they plan to relocate the inhabitants and mine the magic dust.  And get this, they are going to use hologram technology in an attempt to hoodwink the locals.  Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart) first figures something is amiss when the android Data (Brent Spiner) has suddenly gone bonkers, threatening the planet.

The big to-do here is when Picard gets to the bottom of things he must disobey his commanding officer and indeed the Federation leadership, since they have authorized the partnership.  Theoretically one that will enhance all creatures.  Just staying on the planet briefly, changes in behavior becomes noticeable.  The crew become more friendly, more romantic [see Riker and Troi (Marina Sirtis) rekindle an old relationship on a G level].  Even Picard is smitten with one of the local leaders, Anij (Donna Murphy) but of course never acts on it.

The biggest problem with the film quite frankly is the PG rating as well as the lame script (Michael Piller).  Some of the dialog is downright laughable.  The pacing, the special effects and some of the action sequence are what you would expectvery good.  Still this may be the clunker of the Next Generation sequels.",1500422400,,1916,5.083333333333333
1011814,4,6305365121,"I had completely forgotten that this movie was even part of the cannon. Nice action scenes and a pretty good villain that never really gets to flex his muscles. It's fascinating to me that the Next Generation films seems fixated on Data. That's not a bad thing, but all of the STNG cast are worthy of a strong storyline. A solid movie that once again plays out like a bigger budget episode of the series. A nice watch for true fans.",1499990400,,432,4.345679012345679
1011815,3,6305365121,"Okay movie, but I really want to know why they never made even ONE Star Trek Voyager Movie for the Big Screen.  It was immensly popular before going off the air.  UNFAIR!",1499990400,,170,4.28125

1011817,4,6305365121,"First Contact has a higher rating generally on both IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, but Insurrection is actually much more authentically Star Trek.  At its highest and best use, the franchise was a vehicle that purported to explore strange new worlds as metaphor for exploring ourselves.  And while Insurrection might have fewer gratuitous star ship explosions than the previous film, its plot offers an allegorical perspective on some of our more problematic historical practices (displacing small, indigenous groups so that larger, more advanced groups can reap the benefit of their natural resources), as well as some of less savory modern-day practices (aligning ourselves with outside groups who share absolutely none of our human-rights values for political or economic expediency).  Its storytelling is a little ham-fisted in this regard, but it's also hews a lot closer to what lifelong Star Trek fans loved about the Next Generation series than some other movies that have come before or since.",1499040000,3,997,5.378205128205129

1011841,3,6305365121,"Star Trek Insurrection is an okay movie, but its not in my top four Trek movies, which include The Wrath of Khan, The Voyage Home, First Contact, and the 2009 reboot, Star Trek. Those four movies are all five star. I fell asleep watching the first Star Trek movie, but the two movies that I least like are Star Trek Insurrection and Star Trek Nemesis.

Youre probably thinking I don't like Star Trek, right? You decide. I own five of the six Star Trek series on DVD. The original 1966-1969 series is my favorite. Ive also seen the animated version of Star Trek, with voices by the original cast. I have a handful of Trek documentaries on DVD, Trekkies, Trekkies II, William Shatner Conquers the World, Trek Nation, and The Captains Chair, and Ive been to the Star Trek Las Vegas Convention, but I don't own a costume. Im a geek, but I haven't gone that far.

Books Ive read about Trek include Star Trek Memories. I split my time between reading and binge watching sci-fi and fantasy series.

I haven't seen any of the movies or TV series from the following book series, but I did read the first books, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Twilight, Outlander, Fifty Shades of Grey, The Long Earth, Divergent, etc. I sample a lot of first books, but I don't read many complete series. (Who has that much time?) The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and The Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) series by George Martin are a couple of exceptions.

Ive read both of those series more than once. Both are five star. The first three books in The Song of Ice and Fire series are the best. The Game of Thrones TV series is also five star. The first two Hunger Games movies are five star, but then they got greedy and tried to make two movies out of the Mockingjay book when there was barely enough source material there for one movie. The first two books in The Hunger Games trilogy are better than third book, Mockingjay, and the first two movies, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, are better than the two Mockingjay movies.

Starship Troopers (1959) (not like the movie) by Robert A. Heinlein is the book that got me started in sci-fi adventures, and has remained one of my top five favorite military science fiction adventure stories for decades. The Forever War (1974) by Joe Haldeman, Armor (1984) by John Steakley, Enders Game (1985) by Orson Scott Card and Old Mans War (2005) by John Scalzi, round out my top five military sci-fi adventure stories.

If you like any of the above you might also like Jack Campbells The Lost Fleet series, Taylor Andersons Destroyermen series, Andre Nortons Star Soldiers, Andy Weirs The Martian, or Frank Herberts Dune. Other sci-fi and fantasy authors I like include Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Terry Goodkind, Hugh Howey, Robert Jordan, George Martin, Larry Niven, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson and J.R.R. Tolkien.",1490918400,,2951,4.709302325581396

1011936,3,6305365121,"Classic Star Trek TNG style movie but it is lacking in spots.  There were several scenes that could have been explored a bit more to understand why things happened (how did Picard ""learn"" to harness something a native knew how to do...don't want to give away any spoilers!).  The CG scenes with the Enterprise and shuttles didn't look as realistic as they could have been using actual models like the early parts of TNG series on TV.  There were also a couple of scenes that were meant to be funny that looked to be too forced or straight from the script; they didn't feel organic enough for a really good laugh.  However, those minor issues didn't detract enough to make me hate the movie.  Good acting in the intense scenes, classic TNG moral dilemmas, and as usual some thought provoking situations about how we may handle things in today's society.",1482710400,,852,4.653333333333333

1012216,5,6305365121,I'm not really sure why but this is my favorite of the star trek films. Perhaps its the idea of a planet with low levels of technologies and the idea of eternal life.

1012306,3,6305365121,"I did not like this film when it was first released probably because it was under the shadow of first contact and growing up watch WWII battle ship movies I wanted to see a good battle choreography which Star Trek tropically lacked.  I think i needed to slow down to catch Insurrection. Years later on revisiting this movie and found I didn't give it it's due.
Though i had been a fan or Patrick Stewart (Dune, etc) I had not been a big Picard fan but this movie does him and the rest of the gang justice.  It's just a different pace and the tech is good but not entirely the focus.  It is worthy.  Well written, executed and shot.",1478044800,,631,4.233333333333333

1012340,4,6305365121,"Released in 1998 and directed by Jonathan Frakes, Star Trek: Insurrection is the third Star Trek film featuring the Next Generation cast. The plot revolves around a serene alien race, the Ba'ku, whose planet offers regenerative radiation and therefore extremely long lifespans; moreover, they live in harmony with their environment and reject advanced technology. With the aid of an alien race called the Son'a, the Federation secretly (deceptively) researches the Baku culture, but the Son'a intend to take the planet for themselves and others who secretly want to regenerate their bodies (i.e. drink of the Fountain of Youth). The problem is that Captain Picard and the Enterprise-E crew are loyal to the Prime Directive.

The plot is good with some interesting ideas  the paradisal planet where immortality is nigh reality  but something prevents the movie from taking off and soaring. It's decent; it's just underwhelming and doesn't always 'click.' Some kinks needed worked out in the creation process.

The film runs 103 minutes and was shot in California at Convict Lake, Mammoth Lakes Park; San Gabriel Dam, Angeles National Forest; Lake Sherwood; Bishop; and Paramount Studios, Los Angeles.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In the wake of the very successful STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT film that brought the Sci-Fi franchise back from the moribund wasteland of entries STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER, STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY and STAR TREK VII: GENERATIONS, comes the Sci-Fi feature film STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION. The good news for Trekkie fans and casual cinema-goers alike is that director Jonathan Frakes, returns for his second stint at the Starship U.S.S Enterprise helm, and has maintained the same entertainment level, although the tone is considerably more playful. Admittedly, anyone expecting a motion picture ""event"" from this film will be slightly disappointed STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION is little more than a very good, double-length episode of the defunct Star Trek: The Next Generation television series. This Sci-Fi film is not designed to alter the STAR TREK mythology, but to build upon its momentum.

STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION begins with a puzzle. Lt. Commander Data [Brent Spiner], on a routine mission to study the Ba'ku, a seemingly-backward people living on an idyllic planet, turns against  the other members of his team, including Federation officers and members of the alien Son'a race. Admiral Matthew Dougherty [Anthony Zerbe], the officer in charge of the mission, orders Captain Jean-Luc Picard [Patrick Stewart] and his crew to retrieve Lt.  Commander Data within 12 hours or destroy him. However, what starts out as a simple rescue mission causes Captain Jean-Luc Picard to stumble unwittingly into the midst of a conspiracy that involves Admiral Matthew Dougherty, the Son'a leader, Ru'afo [F. Murray Abraham], and the Federation High Council in a plot to violate the Prime Directive, which states that the Federation cannot meddle in the natural development of other civilisations, in the name of the ""greater good."" They want to forcibly remove the Ba'ku from their world so that the restorative properties of the planet can be strip-mined for distribution across the galaxy. Captain Jean-Luc Picard must choose whether to obey orders and head for home or risk his career, his ship, and his life by defying Admiral Matthew Dougherty and defending the Ba'ku against Federation and Son'a interference.

The simple message in STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION, which has to do with the immorality of displacing a populace and destroying a way of life in the name of progress i.e., what the European settlers did to the Native Americans, is somewhat more esoteric than the one in STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER and save the whales, but no less difficult to spot. The best STAR TREK stories are allegorical and in addition to telling an involving story, they're about something other than going into space and blowing up enemy ships. STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION continues that Sci-Fi tradition.

The Star Trek: The Next Generation cast is intact for the third Sci-Fi film, which they first debuted on the big screen in 1994's cross-over Sci-Fi film, START TREK: GENERATIONS. With the spotlight once again trained firmly on Captain Jean-Luc Picard [Patrick Stewart] continues to show why he's the most accomplished actor ever to put on a Starfleet uniform. In START TREK: FIRST  CONTACT, Patrick Stewart was given the opportunity to imitate Captain Ahab and a role Patrick Stewart later performed ""for real"" in a made-for-TV film. In STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION, Patrick Stewart is on less volatile ground, and one can question his ethical stance, but not the motives behind it. Patrick Stewart is a gentler, humane character than when facing the Borg, and the script allows him to play the romantic leading man opposite the beautiful Anij [Donna Murphy], a Ba'ku woman.

From a visual standpoint, this is easily the most impressive STAR TREK Sci-Fi film to date. With location shooting done in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, cinematographer Matthew Leonetti has captured a series of gorgeous vistas. The special effects, which rely more on computer generated images than anything previously attempted in a STAR TREK Sci-Fi film, look especially crisp, and give the space sequences a polish that they never before achieved. Plus we get the brilliant Composer Jerry Goldsmith, back for his fourth assignment overall and his second consecutive one, lends an element of musical continuity. Meanwhile, in two outings as director, Jonathan Frakes has proven that he understands what makes STAR TREK work on the big screen. And as we have seen the producers have continued to apply that knowledge so that STAR TREK X: NEMESIS, STAR TREK VIII: FIRST CONTACT and STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION have gone into other successful Sci-Fi film instalments.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Once again Paramount Pictures UK has done this Blu-ray a fantastic job, as the 1080p encoded image is totally brilliant and outstanding and so is the equally stunning anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect ratio makes this film look even better than when it was originally released on the inferior DVD format. Most notable is brilliant transfer between different scenes, which really enhances your viewing experience. But the outstanding part of this film is the outdoor and indoor scenes are well captured with vivid bright colours and very good contrast. Once again the outer space scenes have been transferred very nicely, with deep, solid blacks overlaid with bright stars and the colourful streaks of the obligatory photon-torpedo fire. So all in all this is a totally beautiful viewing video experience all round.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Paramount Pictures UK has been equally diligent in presenting your audio experience with an outstanding 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround, that fills your viewing room with brilliant ambient effects whilst at the same time providing a clear and spacious dialogue and is a very good example of how a Dolby TrueHD Surround brings out a truly spectacular audio experience. There is also some really brilliant sub-woofer ambience, particularly during the outer space scenes, which will give your surround speakers a good workout too. As usual the brilliant music composer Jerry Goldsmiths orchestral film music score is up to his really excellent outstanding standard and adds a great deal to the overall experience of watching this film. But be sure your neighbours are not around, as if they are they will definitely know that you are watching a Sci-Fi film of this calibre!

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary by Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis: Here both of them introduce themselves and tell us who is who in the film Insurrection, especially when the names appear on the screen and make little comments about them. They also praise the amazing village that was designed by Herman Zimmerman. They also give great praise to the late great genius film composer Jerry Goldsmith. As the audio commentary moves along, you can hear they are both enjoying and having a wonderful time doing the commentary and at the same time do some funny sarcastic remarks about certain people that appear in a certain scene in the film. Jonathan mentions that he finds it curious fact that all the Baku people have 99.9% blond hair and not one black actor among them, but Marina reminds Jonathan that they were originally descendants of the Swedish people, but how they got to this planet is not really explained. In general all the comments about the film is very light and frothy and we do not get any insightful information about the film, and just gives quick comments about the actor appearing on the film and things that went wrong with each scene shot and where sometimes when Michael Dorn [Worf] did his scene, he kept fluffing his lines and had to shoot a scene several times. As we get near to the end of the film and the credits roll up the screen, Jonathan and Marina make lots of comments about certain names appear on the scene and how they liked working with them, but we also get lots of comments like, we had a good didn't we Johnny, what a great gig (meaning the film). We get more comments on certain names that appear in the credits and say nice comments about them, they also comment on certain names of people who have sadly passed away since the film was released in the cinema. But as we get to the end of the credits, both say, That was a good picture. All in all, it was quite an amusing audio commentary and one of the lightest so far and was quite funny in places and will keep you amused throughout the film.

Special Feature: Library Computer [2016] [1080p] A very cool interactive graphic trivia interface, which is loaded with screen-specific information with just about every aspect of the 'STAR TREK' universe. The Library Computer is overflowing with data that pours out at steady amounts of clips. The Library Computer is an interactive experience that allows you to access information about People, Technology, Locations and more, at the moment each item appears in the film. Switch to Index Mode to scan the entire database and jumps directly to the items of interest. All content is divided into the following categories: Culture; Science & Medicine; Starfleet Ops; Miscellaneous; Life Forms; Planets & Location; People; Technology and Ships.

Special Feature: Production: Here you have a selection of seven different features, which are as follows:

01. It Takes A Village [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [16:41] Here we get an i-depth look at behind-the-scene filming of the film STAR TREK IX, plus comments from people involved with the film, especially the technical aspect of filming different scenes. The Ba'ku village was built in full scale on location at Lake Sherwood, California, with architectural designs combining Thai, Balinese and Polynesian styles. The village included a bakery, a farm with a full irrigation system, a city hall, and a city square which was referred to as the ""rotunda."" The location shoot lasted for six weeks, and had three months to design and construct 55 full sets for the film, eighteen more than used in the previous films in the series and was the most expensive film for building brand new sets. Find out what was so special about the Lamas in the film.

02. Location, Location, Location [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [19:56] With this special feature, we once again have a rare look behind-the-scene of the specific locations for the STAR TREK IX film, and we also hear how everyone enjoyed working on this film and especially being about to work on location at Lake Sherwood, California, as well in San Gabriel Dam, San Gabriel Canyon, Angeles National Forest, California. Everyone gives great praise for the awesome set design by Herman Zimmerman and how like a real village it looked and when the film was released in 1998, people wanted to know the exact location so they could visit it.

03. The Art of Insurrection [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [14:53] John Eaves [Illustrator] was the concept illustrator artist on STAR TREK IX, where he did several drawings for the space crafts, the sets and props. We get to see a lot of stunning black-and-white line drawings of the Enterprise space crafts, and other types of space crafts you see in the film. John Eaves goes into great technical detail why he chose the specific designs for the space crafts and the solar collector and tends to go into great long details and to me I found it totally boring and it will only be of interest to nerdy Trekkie fans who love all this vacuous information.

04. Anatomy Of A Stunt [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [6:33] The footage we are informed that you get to witness, was filmed for a stunt that never made it to the final cut of the film. Here Rick Avery [Stunt Coordinator] goes into great detail on the stunt they are about to film, which mainly involves Brent Spiner [Data] and with three stunt extras falling from a great height onto air bags. Then you get to see the finished scene as a rough cut.

05. The Story [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [17:19] Here we get to meet Michael Piller [Screenwriter] who explains in detail how he came up with the storyline for STAR TREK IX, which came about when he put on some face cream, and especially with the scenario of the Sonar are totally obsessed with wanting to stay constantly young, and searching for the fountain of youth, but was also in homage to the film The Magnificent Seven, but unfortunately the first draft storyline outline was rejected and so Michael decided to go back to the basics in homage to Gene Roddenberry and the scenario of being a rebel and going against the Federation. Michael talks about an old friend Gene Siskel, who was film reviewer for the Chicago Sun-Times, to host a show on the local WBBM-TV as news broadcaster, and through his widow, said that Gene Siskel thought STAR TREK IX was the best genuine STAR TREK film he had ever liked, and of course this meant a great deal to Michael Piller.

06. Making STAR TREK: INSURRECTION [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [25:06] We are told that STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION is a great story telling, but that they feel STAR TREK VIII: FIRST CONTACT was a hard act to follow and it showed that the cast were having a lot of fun on this movie, than the previous STAR TREK film and doesnt have the constant drama like they did with Generations and First Contact, but more aimed at a family oriented film, that has principles, ethics, morals, but most of all in showing peoples total greed and jealousy and what drives people to do the wrong thing, like in the tradition of the Gene Roddenberry storyline. All who are interviewed gave great praise for Jonathan Frakes as a truly special director and was totally suited to directing STAR TREK films.

07. Directors Notebook [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [18:56] This special is all about Jonathan Frakes [Director/William T. Riker] and his work and insight into directing STAR TREK IX and hearing his inner thoughts on working on the film in general, and although he felt it was an enjoyable time overall, Jonathan felt the storyline was not as strong as STAR TREK VIII, but felt more confident directing STAR TREK IX. Jonathan informs us he loves acting and directing, but with a couple of films under his belt directing, found it very luxurious, to be able to get to the studio in the morning and check the shoot sheet, have a cup of coffee with the crew, instead of getting to the studio a couple of hours before the shoot to have the make-up done, which is also nice, but the main difference he confides in us, that between being and actor and a director, is that being an actor we are pampered, and when you show up in the morning, they make you a cup of coffee, they exactly know what you want for breakfast, they cut your fruit, they give you your rye toast, the hairdressers are very gentle to you, hand you a newspaper, someone brings you lunch, someone puts your clothes out for you, but most important, they are always taking care of you. But when you are a director, you have to do everything yourself, and answer all the questions thrown at you. Jonathan sums up that he had a brilliant time in directing STAR TREK IX and especially what the camera filmed and what you see on the silver screen.

Special Feature: The STAR TREK Universe: Here you have a selection of seven different features, which are as follows:

01. Westmores Aliens [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [17:43] Here we get to meet Michael Westmore [Make-Up Designer/Supervisor] and talks about the hundreds of make0-up jobs he has done for all the aliens that have featured in all the different STAR TREK TV series and also the STAR TREK films. We find out Michaels inspirations in coming up with the concept for each alien and tends to get his inspiration designs from around the world, especially from a variety of insects, fish, birds, mammals and dinosaur bones. Michael informs us that working on the STAR TREK films was a great privilege and still does not get bored, even though at the start of 1998 he had been working for 12 years then when this interview was filmed and hopes to never retire, as the job gives him total satisfaction and fulfils a dream come true in being a professional make-up designer.

02. Westmores Legacy [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [12:45] Here we have a much more up-to-date look at the master STAR TREK make-up artist, Michael Westmore. Here we meet Michael in his home and talks about the Family Tree History and especially George Westmore [Grandfather] who use to make wigs for the Crown heads of England. At the turn of the century the family moved to California, where he taught his sons how to make wigs, and they were Wally, Ern, Perc and Monty Westmore and with each generation went into the same business. They also developed other innovations like latex, hair lace, individual eye lashes, and also a new beauty product entitled Tru-Glow. They also created the Westmores Salon of Beauty [1935  1965] at 6638 Sunset Boulevard. Michael talks about his time in working in the STAR TREK TV and Film franchise series, and over time really refined his skills. We get to see a special room where he has two rare STAR TREK pin ball machines that he designed; we also see a very rare 8 feet x 5 feet STAR TREK pastel coloured poster that was done by Ms. Carole Kabrin and Emmy award winning artist from Dearborn, Michigan. Michael also has mounted a rock that was part of the grave of Captain T. Kirk in the film Generations [1995]. Michael also received the Hollywood Walk of Fame on the 3rd October, 2008. Michael feels very proud and very honoured to have worked on all aspects of the STAR TREK franchise over an 18 year period.

03. STAR TREKs Beautiful Alien Women [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [12:40] Here we take a look at all the alien and human women that have appeared in both the STAR TREK TV series and STAR TREK films. Contributors include Jonathan Frakes [Director/William T. Riker], Marina Sirtis [Deanna Troi], Connor Trinneer [Charles ""Trip"" Tucker III], Mike Sussman [Producer/Screenwriter], Robert Picardo [The Doctor], Terry Farrell [Jadzia Dax], Chase Masterson [Leeta], Alice Krige [Borg Queen], Patrick Stewaart [Jean-Luc Picard] and Donna Murhy [Anij].

04. Marina Sirtis: The Counselor Is In [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:26] here we get an in-depth interview with Marina Sirtis and talks about her alto eager character Deanna Troi in the STAR TREK TV series and STAR TREK films and says if their STAR TREK TV and Film franchise was still going, Marina would still be there and loved all of the 7 years working on the franchise project, but when it all finished Marina was very sad, as she made lots of friends over the many years. Marina talks about her acting performances in the films First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis. All in all, Marina had a totally brilliant time with her acting career in the STAR TREK franchise and again was very sad when it all finished.

05. Brent Spiner: Data and Beyond Part 3 [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:17] Here for the third time we again get an intimate interview with Brent Spiner talking more about his character Data, especially of course in the STAR TREK franchise and how he approached to acting like an android robot. Brent informs us that whenever they were doing really serious scenes, which turned out to be comedy moments and sometimes they would go into uncontrollable hysterical laughter. Brent tells us that he has worked with F. Murray Abraham Original Broadway Production of the The Seagull in 1997. But because F. Murray Abraham lives in Spain, did not know anything about STAR TREK and did not know Brent Spiner was involved with the franchise. Brent Spiner finally informs us that he is most grateful to have played Data, and being part of the amazing epic that was STAR TREK, and way, way, way more ups than downs about it.

06. Trek Roundtable: Insurrection [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [10:50] Once again we meet those four boring nerdy people, talking about the STAR TRK IX: INSURRECTION film, and again what they talked about is such boring information and is just not worth viewing.

07. Starfleet Academy: Origins of the Baku and Sona Conflict [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:00] This is the ninth in a series of plot recaps hosted as though they were Starfleet instructional videos at the Starfleet Academy, Ex Astris, Scientia, San Francisco MMCLXI. In this episode, Starfleet Science Officer [Sarah Backhouse] from the 24th century examines the history of the Ba'ku and Son'a, along with the intervention of the United Federation of Planets in 2375. The Ba'ku which is from the Ka'bu term meaning ""the Peaceful"" and are a humanoid civilization that reside on the planet Ba'ku located in Sector 441 of the Beta Quadrant. The Son'a were descendants of the Ba'ku, who left the planet Ba'ku in 2270 when their rebellion against Ba'ku philosophies failed. These renegade Ba'ku soon took on an air of narcissism and materialistic behaviour.

Special Feature: Creating The Illusion: Here you have a selection of three different features, which are as follows:

01. Shuttle Chase [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [9:36] Here we get the voice over of Peter Lauritson [Co-Producer/2nd Unit Director] who was involved with the film Insurrection and goes into great detail about the illustrations you get to view of the designs for the space shuttles, which are stunning well designed illustrations. We also get to view brilliant 3D models and we also get to view the results of all these designs transferred into basic computer graphic images, which eventually we get to view the finished results of a rough cut clip from the film, as well as some rough cuts of actors again a blue screen. But eventually we actually see the finished film clip.

02. Drones [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [4:43] Here for the second time is the voice over of Peter Lauritson [Co-Producer/2nd Unit Director] explaining about the Drone sequences in the film Insurrection, and the drones you get to view are first of all computer generated images, then you get to see them combined with the film, which you see the finished results. We also get to see behind-the-scene filming and especially seeing an actual model of a drone. Contributions include Patrick Denver [Model Shop Foreman: Blue Sky/VIFX].

03. Duck Blind [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [4:36] Here for the third and final time is the voice over of Peter Lauritson [Co-Producer/2nd Unit Director] explaining about the storyboard illustrations of the Duck Blind sequences with Datas head appearing when being chased around the village. We also get to see some rough cut scenes with the guys in their red suites doing their stunts, plus finished clips from the film, especially where Data fires the phasor at the observation platform. One thing I am curious about is that no one explains why it is called Duck Blind.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [12:56] Here you have a selection of seven different deleted scenes, which are as follows: Ruafos Facelift Scene #32 Extended Scene; Working Lunch Scene #36 Deleted Scene; Flirting Scene #40 Extended Scene; The Kiss Scene #155 Deleted Scene; Status: Precarious Scene #268 Deleted Scene; Disabling The Injector Scene #270-277 Deleted Scene and Alternate Ending Scene #201-304 Alternate Scene. Here we get to see Peter Lauritson [Co-Producer/2nd Unit Director] explaining at the start and two other times why certain scenes were deleted from the film Insurrection. As usual you can either watch them separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Archives: Here you have a selection of two different features. To view the said features you get displayed, you have to use the right and left arrow keys on your remote control to view the said images in these galleries, which are as follows:

01. Storyboards: Secondary Protocol: Here you get to view a total of 49 very basic drawn storyboard images.

02. Photo Gallery [1080p] Here you get to view a total of 40 colour images of rare behind-the-scene filming and publicity images.

Special Feature: Advertising: Here you have a selection of three different features relating to the film STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION, which are as follows: Teaser Trailer [1998] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:38]. Theatrical Trailer [1998] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:38]. Original Promotional Featurette [2005] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:02]. With this last item, it looks like it was made for American Television.

Special Feature: BD-LIVE: To view the contents via your Blu-ray player, it has to be connected to the internet; otherwise it is not BD-LIVE capable. For possible solutions to resolve this problem, please consult your Blu-ray player manual.

Finally, some Trekkie fans really enjoyed STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION, others did not, but I personally found it a very enjoyable experience. STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION, is a film worth revisiting, and is a film that warns of the dangers of letting modernity and technology affect our humanity. It is a film that teaches us that haste makes waste and that slow and steady wins the race. It is a refreshing, nostalgic, funny, and romantic film. However, STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION, has the characters reacting as more of their normal selves, although also in surprising ways because of the narrative. , STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION isn't merely an adventure, as was First Contact, but also a social commentary in fine STAR TREK tradition. From a visual standpoint, this is easily the most impressive Star Trek film to date. With location shooting done in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, cinematographer Matthew Leonetti has captured a series of gorgeous vistas, as well as the brilliant computer generated images. Brilliant composer Jerry Goldsmith, back for his fourth assignment overall and his second consecutive one, lends an element of musical continuity. Meanwhile, in two outings as director, Jonathan Frakes has proven that he understands what makes STAR TREK work on the big screen. Highly Recommended!

1012815,5,6305365121,"This is my favorite Star Trek film of all time, after First Contact.  What I find most fascinating about this story is the reminder that governments, even the Federation, can be corrupted from time to time by greed and act in an unethical manner at the expense of innocent people.  The film was released in 1998 and could have serves a warning to America, especially after 9/11 and the fraudulent war on terror, to not abandon its liberal and constitutional principles to an unethical government seeking to suspend liberties in exchange for a false security state.  In the case of Insurrection, we see Picard willing to give up his career to do what he believes is the right thing to do: expose a conspiracy to relocate a peaceful people out of a planet that they had inhabited for hundreds of years.  The story is a reminder that people with conscience should not just go along with corruption but should take a stand to do the right thing, even if it means the potential end of your career.  If only America had a Picard and company that could help expose the lies and corruption of the deep state that is engaged in overt and covert wars around the world and the destruction of civil liberties at home for the last 15 years, spanning Republican and Democrat administrations alike.  This is what Star Trek is supposed to be about - questioning authority when it goes against your conscience and not just blindly following orders when you know you are right.  Some would argue that the Federation would never succumb to such greed and tactics.  However, Star Trek plots are often a mix of science fiction and real life allegories that teach a moral lesson.  Also, maybe those criticizers forget that Kirk and company violated some Star Fleet and Federation orders to save Spock in Star Trek 3 and went so far as to steal or hijack the Enterprise to do what they believed was the right thing to do.  Insurrection matches the same spirit of moral rebellion in that sense as the officers follow Picard to the planet in defiance of Federation orders.  The film was directed and written very well, combining humor and and beautiful cinematography.  All of the characters that faithful Trek fans grew up loving were at their peak in this film.  What more can be said.  Just very well done.  Too bad JJ Abrams has ruined the spirit and brand of Star Trek with ""Beyond.""  Star Trek should pick up where Insurrection and Deep Space Nine left off.",1473033600,3,2438,4.634883720930232

This is typical of the franchise up until the JJ Abrams reboot in 2009.  It is more like a made for TV movie than a feature film.  I will watch anything with the words Star Trek in it and this did not disappoint but the last three films in the reboot are so fantastic they have taken the series to a new level and the old films just seem stale.

1014433,2,6305365121,One of the lamest Star Trek movies I've seen.  Cheesy.,1468281600,,54,4.4
1014434,1,6305365121,"Here Star Fleet gleefully rescues a scenic baby boomer hippie commune (i.e. 300 years old) from their deranged and deformed offspring (read: Gen Xer agent orange babies) who plot to take over the perfect hippie commune for nefarious purposes, like political control.  The commune hippies are coded for the roughly 1946-1964 post WWII generation of groovy forever young people, while their decrepit, much older adult offspring are constantly stretching their faces with lasers (read botox obsessions), and would happily destroy the ecology of the entire planet if they can't control everything.  Their younger children are still beautiful and loyal to a fault.  Here the plot shifts the social blame not just for the alienation from the elders onto adult offspring, but also the ecological attack at well.  The elders are completely at one with nature, and are really quite magical.  The offspring led a despite existence in exile from the elder's perfection, and have none of their moral values.  So destroying them is perfectly ok.

But does that legitimize this inter generational justice narrative?  Were the Son'a (read: sons) of the Ba'Ku wrong to want political power under the age of 200+ years old when their ageless predecessors insist on up to 40 year apprenticeships before even art can be recognized as a career?  The extreme education expectations and long delay of adulthood is significant.  This plot asks those all these questions and returns very Old Order answers.  The heavily made up middle aged actors playing at youth with rosy cheeks and bright pink lips is enough to move the entire production in the direction of camp.  But is it wrong to want a change from baby boomer forever young perfectionism?  In this plot it is.  When Anji explains that yesterday is the same as tomorrow is the same as today for her middle aged tribe, what she really describes an impenetrable status quo.  What Picard over simplifies as a blood feud, is an inter generational struggle for power and access to resources, even the youth-bearing qualities of the planet are an asset.

Worth a close watch not for it's entertainment value, but for it historical import.  Star Trek intersects a number of ideas that interest me as a thinker, including the generational divisions of today.  This movie summaries through fiction an actual disconnect between baby boomers of the post WWII era, and Gen X, their immediate successors.  While the huge baby boomer generation enjoyed the post WWII stability in economics and education, subsequent groups did not, and in that sense, the elders failed to pass on the educational and economic opportunities of the past (symbolized by the craft/farmer economy of the hippie commune of Insurrection), nor did the elders innovate a new economy to reject the past for good.  When the offspring reject that unquestioning continuation of the past, they will be exiled from the fountain of youth that the baby boomers believe they are as a group.  This film, set in 1998, is a pivotal moment in the baby boomer era prior to the disappointments of Y2K, 9/11, and resumption of the Gulf Wars.  It is well worth closely watching for tell-tale signs of the new millennium dawning in the opposite direction from this worn out parable in space.",1468281600,,3267,5.0

1014511,4,6305365121,"Star Trek IX: Insurrection is one of the most ""thoughtful"" of the Star Trek films.  This is a story of ""They have it and 'I' want it.""  It's not a theme unknown to anybody and we've seen it thousands of times.  But that's not the issue.  What's at stake here is the value of one groups ability to live over another.  Like others have said before me, this movie plays out like an extended television episode, sans advertisements.

The Ba'ku, a peace loving, free-spirited type of people, lead by the ageless Anij (Donna Murphy) live a wonderful life on their planet.  This planet is graced by a radiation ring that prohibits or stalls the aging process.  The So'na, lead by Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) have set their sights on the planet and with the aid of one of the Federations Admirals intends to have the planet.

This is another Jonathan Frakes directed films.  He seems to get better with each go and this is no exception.  Of course, Enterprise-E lead by the fearless Picard will do whatever it takes to keep (1) themselves the heroes and (2) the little guy from getting stomped.  Don't judge this movie by the overused plot.  Judge it by how it plays out and the actors, especially the NON regulars.

On a seemingly idyllic planet occupied by just 600 persons 'The Ba'Ku' a plot is developing the intent of
which is their removal, at the heart of which is a 'Federation Admiral and the 'Son'a'
Captain Picard' and his crew are on the way, it seems 'Data' serving the Federation on the planet is out
of control.
On the planet's surface 'Jean Luc' finds the 'Ba'ku' are not as technologically nave as they first appear,
they tell the Captain that 'Data' has warned the planets inhabitants are in danger from both the 'Federation'
and 'Son'a'
The 'Admiral' orders 'Captain Picard' and his crew to leave. however there are deep suspicions among the
crew of the happenings on the planet.
Now the Captain must risk all by disobeying a direct order from a Federation Commander, to uphold the very
principles of the Federation and protect the population of the planet if but only 600, decisions and a plan of
action have to be made, quickly.
What is it that is so valuable on this particular planet to the 'Son'a' and seemingly the Federation that makes
it necessary to remove it's occupants.
It becomes a matter of principle for 'Jean Luc' he's prepared to return to the surface to help the 'Ba'ku' the
crew of the Enterprise insist on standing side by side with their Captain.
'Picard' directs 'Riker' and 'Geordi' to report to 'Star-Fleet Command and The Federation' what is happening
on the planet, to do so they have to take the 'Enterprise' within contact range, 'Jean Luc' is joined on the planets
surface by 'Data' 'Worf' 'Beverly' and 'Troi' to try to protect the 600 and prevent them being beamed up of the
surface.
The leader of the 'Son'a' has sent two of his vessels to intercept the 'Enterprise' while he continue with his plans
for the planet and it's occupants, the Admiral begins to get 'cold-feet' however the 'Son'a' are prepared to proceed
without Federation approval.
Not action-packed as is often true of 'Star-Trek' stories, the action there is on-board is good, this an absorbing plot
with the 'Enterprise' crew defending the rights of the innocent.
Picture and Sound quality very good as is the Special-effects.

1014854,5,6305365121,"It was drawn from several earlier TNG themes, including protecting the prime directive and not wishing to relocate a group of colonists because of Federation Council politics.  There were many things left unsaid, but then Jean Luc Picard was never a swashbuckling woman's man.  Although some scenes were a bit awkward, overall it was true to it's origins.",1442188800,,355,5.103448275862069
1014855,2,6305365121,"As a film this movie is good. It has good acting (at least from the TNG regular cast), it has a good flow from beginning-middle-end, and it tells a coherent story.

However I still consider it a bad Star Trek movie.

First, because of its message. Whatever greater philosophical interpretations there are, there is one message that is clearly displayed in just about every episode. The message that by advancing scientific knowledge, maintaining a moral anchor, and constantly seeking to see what is beyond the horizon then the human race will always have a better tomorrow. This movie however presents a message that is almost the opposite, That it is down-to-Earth rural communities where everyone works to grow the crops that will bring you a better tomorrow. Now I am not saying this is a bad message or that its wrong, just that it conflicts with just about every previous episode of Star Trek.

The real problem is the moral quandary of the film. On the surface it would seem obvious that the forced relocation of the Ba'ku is a bad thing, even recalling real world events to enforce the point. But if you dig a little the solution is not so clear-cut.

The casual movie watcher probably wouldn't know this but this film is set during a large in-universe even known as the Dominion War, a war between the Federation and a tyrannical dictator government known as the Dominion. It was a war the Federation was losing badly, and millions of citizens were dying. The new medical technology the Federation Admiral wanted from the meta-phasic particles could be used to save at least thousands of Starfleet personnel who were fighting on the front lines, and used to improve the health and lifespan of billions of Federation citizens. And all it will cost is the immortality of the 600 Ba'ku.

The Ba'ku wouldn't be killed, but they would lose the source of immortality that has kept them young, limiting them to the same life-span as those billions of Federation citizens.

So the question becomes, let 600 people live possibly forever on their little out of the way planet, or force them to move so that billions could be helped including those soldiers who are dying? That is a real moral dilemma that I would have loved to see the crew of the Enterprise debate among themselves. Instead they immediately decide that the forced relocation is bad and they're going cowboy to stop it, covering up the moral problem by making the So'na villains cartoonish bad guys interested in revenge.

This is kind of funny since there are several Star Trek episodes with a plot that focuses on the forced relocation of people, and give the subject matter much deeper thought then this movie does.

But this sidestepping of the moral dilemma in order to make it a Black and White issue is why I think this is a bad Star Trek movie, when it could have been so much greater.",1442188800,,2859,4.704

1014859,5,6305365121,"I watched this one on Amazon Prime.

If you enjoy stories that are a bit more complex and cerebral than the norm, ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" is as much fun as any Star Trek film from the period with, to my taste, the best core cast that the Star Trek franchise has seen.  It's an engaging story that held my interest through the whole movie.

I have to admit that my perception might be prejudiced by the fact that, though I've been a Star Trek fan since the first episode of the original series aired on television, I wasn't even aware this film existed.  (It was a quite intense time in America's real space program.  I was working on development of the International Space Station at the time.  1998.  Real life got a bit busy; we were launching and I was working in mission control.)  It was quite a treat to be able to venture out into the cosmos again with the familiar crew on an adventure that I hadn't realized even existed until I discovered it on Amazon Prime.

Avoiding spoilers as best I can, I'll note a bit of silliness:  For a while there, I was afraid that this film would once again prove the old adage, ""It's death to kiss a Cartwright!""  But no; I was happy to see that the writers quite graciously worked past that old trap.",1441756800,,1244,4.341991341991342

The problem is the nature of the plot and the significance of the villain make this movie seem more like an extended episode rather than a grand cinematic film.

I am sure I will upset all the Trekkers who will bash this review on site for my opinion.  I saw this film in the theatre when it came out and it was a few months before Star Wars Phantom Menace was released.  I felt like the studio was trying to capitalize on the momentum building up for the Star Wars Prequel films.  I thought both films were awful.  The movie seemed rushed and nothing seems to happen for long stretches of the movie.  I did not really see the problem with moving a people off the planet who are immortal if it benefits others who were struggling.  I thought to myself what's the big deal.

This film is the worst in the ST TNG movies out of the 4.  A lot of people did not like Nemesis but I would watch that film any day over this one.  The villain character was not very good or memorable.  I think they made Nemesis more action oriented because this film was so slow, and maybe they overcompensated for it.  Either way it is barely better than Star Trek V the final Frontier, that is still the worst Star Trek film ever made.  But this is definitely not one of the better movies in Star Trek series.  If you have not seen this film I would skip it you are not missing anything.  Your time would be better invested in buying a season of Next Generation or the previous movie First Contact.",1420761600,,1446,4.2226277372262775
1015270,2,6305365121,"In theory, there really isn't anything that horribly wrong with 1998's ""Star Trek Insurrection,"" since director-star Jonathan Frakes evidently did the best he could under the circumstances.  The utterly lackluster storyline involves a secret Federation conspiracy to forcibly take a pacifist world's natural ""fountain-of-youth""-like magic for its own ulterior motives.  Of course, only Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his Enterprise-E crew stand in the way, as they temporarily resign their Federation careers to mount a counter-offensive.  If it had been a two-part TV season finale, ""Insurrection"" might have likely succeeded on all thrusters.  However, as a big-screen Trek film, the end result isn't necessarily lousy but proves just simply boring.  Seeing the film once was enough for me.

This film is really meant only for Next Generation die-hards.

1015647,2,6305365121,"A couple months ago I found the special editions of the first 10 (i.e. original cast and next generation) Star Trek movies  in a used DVD store for a reasonable price, so I made an impulse purchase.  I always liked most of the first six films, had only seen Generations and First Contact once on TV, and had never seen the last two.  So I figured it was time to get caught up, and I've spent the last several weeks watching the movies and going through the commentaries and special features.

I've finally gotten to Insurrection, and after my first viewing I was tempted to say it's the worst of the lot (with the caveat that I haven't seen Nemesis yet).  But I think the fifth movie, Final Frontier, still holds that title.  Insurrection at least had decent production values, good special effects and OK acting.  What it doesn't have is a story worth caring about.  You know how sometimes when you'd watch the Next Generation episodes on TV, there'd be one that just seemed like it was thrown together because they had to fill their hour-long time slot?  That's how this movie feels.  Just basically pointless.

At first I was having trouble following the plot.  I thought it was because it was complicated, but then I realized it's because half the movie is spent trying to patch the plot holes of the other half of the movie.  Why do the Ba'ku have to be moved?  Can't the Federation just set up a base on the opposite side of the planet from the Ba'ku?  They shun technology, so they'd probably never even notice.  Oh, throw something in there about how the process of collecting the ""fountain of youth"" element will destroy the planet's atmosphere, so everyone has to leave.  Wait, doesn't that seem like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs?  Oh, add a line in there about how the planet will regenerate in a few hundred years.  Well, why doesn't the Federation just go look for another planet with the same property - it's a big universe, surely they could find an uninhabited planet?  Oh, we'll say the planet's rings concentrate the effect so it only works here.  Well, why can't they just set up a base to further study the effect and see if there's some way they can harness it without destroying the Ba'ku?  Uh, because the main bad guy is about to die and he needs the treatment immediately.  Well, why doesn't he just go live on the planet?  Because it would take too long to heal him.  Wait, didn't Jordi get his eyesight back overnight?  Why would it take too long?  Um, never mind that.  OK, if the planet regenerates DNA and makes people age backwards, why aren't all the inhabitants children?  Because we need a love interest for Picard...guess we should throw a line in there about how it doesn't take effect until you reach adulthood.  And on and on.

On the plus side, the second disc of the special edition does have some interesting behind-the-scenes features.  I particularly liked the breakdowns of various special effect shots, showing how they were put together.  We also get a glimpse at the script, and just looking at all the color-coded revisions listed on the title page might give a hint as to how the movie ended up the forgettable mess that it is.

As bad as ""Final Frontier"" was, it at least had the original cast, an interesting concept behind it and a few good scenes.  Insurrection just felt like an hour and a half of wasted time that was put out simply to keep the Star Trek franchise alive.  I noticed that this was the only film out of the ten that they couldn't find anyone to do a voice-over commentary for.  And almost all of the bonus material looked like stuff that was put together as promotional items when the movie first came out - not much new material specifically for this DVD.  It's like everyone involved has just disowned this one.",1390694400,,3798,4.539027982326951
1015648,3,6305365121,"""Star Trek: Insurrection"" is the ninth Star Trek film. The crew of the starship Enterprise discovers that the Federation Council is conspiring with an alien race to conquer a planet with radiation that bestows eternal youth on its inhabitants. Captain Picard decides to side with the peaceful inhabitants of the planet, and all the usual conundrums follow.

While ""Star Trek: First Contact"" (the eighth film) tried to take the Star Trek concept into the mainstream, ""Insurrection"" feels more narrow. To all intents and purposes, this is an extended episode of the series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". It feels nerdy, in-house and somewhat awkward. Not bad if you're a Trekkie, but personally, I feel a bit too old for stories about androids trying to become more human, aliens experiencing puberty and rogue Starfleet admirals...

But OK, I give it three stars. I mean, it's not bad for a Star Trek production.",1390521600,,914,5.046357615894039

1015650,4,6305365121,"I will add my review to the already 500 on here. There are a lot of mixed reviews about this movie and honestly it is a pretty good movie. In the Star Trek World I guess I would call it a Stand Alone Movie, no common Klingons, Romulans, or Borg. It is just the Enterprise, The Crew, and the plot that involves their interference and rescue of a world in distress. There seems to be a little more humor than other episodes and movies, part of the plot is that they are on a world that heals the body and stops and reverses aging. Now that I think about it there is more than a touch of young adult humor which is very well placed.  It is better than a glorified episode  and the only performance that I did not like was one of Lady's on the home world had this way of acting that came across as condescending and annoying rather than humble.",1389484800,,840,4.115853658536586

1015697,3,6305365121,"Not one of the great star trek films. I actually bought it because it's one of the forgotten ones (the ones that never get shown on tv). I remember seeing this film in theaters back when it debuted, and remember it being better than it actually is. That being said, it does have good effects, the acting is good, and it has good production values. The real problem here is the story, this movie is fairly short and all of it feels like what would have been a pretty good episode for the series during it's run. It's just too thin to make a movie out of.

If you're buying this expecting first contact level of movie, you're going to be disappointed. But if you're buying because you've never seen it -and most likely won't on tv then it's decent.

It is the perfect follow-up to the SciFi horror actioner First Contact and clearly superior to both the overly constructed Generations and the somewhat underwhelming, sterile Nemesis.

Characters are flat and their relationships reflect no desire for bridging cultural gaps, for understanding, something that  used to be so important in the saga. I do not really see why every feature version has to come with a full destruction of the ship, but so be it, if the story carries. Unfortunately, also the directing makes it clear from the very beginning that the god guys are going to win once more, an attitude which (since we know this will happen because it has to) frankly reflects the lack of precision in directing (not only the story).

1016152,4,6305365121,"Star Trek Insurrection(1998) is a solid Star Trek movie starring the cast from Star Trek The Next Generation(1987-1994). It's not as dark and violent as Star Trek First Contact(1996) and it is fun to watch. There are some gags that fall flat. The scene where Picard, Worf and Data sang Gilbert and Sullivan songs took a lot of criticism. The crew of the USS Enterprise rebel against Starfleet Command in order to save the peaceful Ba'ku from the corrupt, violent So'na. F. Murray Abraham(Amadeus, Last Action Hero) plays So'na villain Ru'afo and lovely Donna Murphy(Spiderman 2, World Trade Center) plays Ba'ku woman Anij. The So'na plan on using ""a collector"" to steal the ""metaphasic radiation"" from the Ba'ku homeworld. This film borrows some ideas from Lifeforce(1985), Seven Samurai(1954), and The Magnificent Seven(1960). The Ba'ku have a ""fountain of youth"" on their homeworld. Star Trek Insurrection has social commentary on the crimes and atrocities that human beings are willing to do to eachother.
 ILM was busy working on Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace(1999) and Deep Impact(1998) at the time. Paramount Pictures hired a different company to do the visual effects for the film. The late Jerry Goldsmith wrote a solid music score for the film. His fans claim his Capricorn One music score is flavored in some scenes. As in the original Star Trek(1966-1969), this Star Trek movie never takes place on or near Earth. The scene with the subspace tear was rehashed in the 2009 reboot of Star Trek. The humor in this film is a hit or miss affair. Riker pilots the USS Enterprise with a video game joystick! This is the kind of sight gag that we'd see in The Naked Gun(1987). The So'na constantly get plastic surgery to preserve their youthful appearance. The make up artists and producers actually did research on plastic surgery. Jonathan Frakes directed the film and he has little screen time as Will Riker. Patrick Stewart is superb as Captain Jean Luc Picard; in the Star Trek movies, he's more impulsive and reckless. In the TV show, Picard was a calm, focused intellectual. This film ends on the right note with Goldsmith's Star Trek The Motion Picture theme music playing over the ending credits. Star Trek Insurrection had an ""ironic"" alternate ending. Ru'afo is stuck in the planet's rings and he ages backwards into a fetus and into nothing! This ending was left on the cutting room floor. Star Trek Insurrection(1998) is a solid adventure made when Star Trek showed its tired blood.",1328227200,2,2507,4.940758293838862

1016157,4,6305365121,"I've stated elsewhere that Insurrection ranks as one of the best of the series. I would like to restate this stance a bit. Frankly, this is the kind of story Star Trek has always been best at, which is one of the reasons I think this one is possibly the best of the series when you look at it as a Star Trek story. As a movie, well, it's okay. Not exactly monumental, but then again, how many of us have been clamoring for them to get back to the lower key stories and lay off the attempted megasuperbombastic blockbusters because they just didn't measure up?

As a Star Trek story, it hits the mark quite well. This is precisely the type of story that Star Trek was meant to tell, an analogy to events right here on Earth. Where it falls short is as a movie, a stand-alone film, and too much of the success of the storyline depends on the audience knowing depends on the audience knowing something about the Star Trek mythos, specifically the TNG end of things. The TOS movies had an advantage in that category in that enough of the general public knows who Kirk, Spock, etc., Bottom line: As another installment of the TNG storyline, it succeeds. It fails in that the story itself isn't exactly an event (it could very well have been told during the regular run of the series, possibly within a single hour), and with that constantly in the background (in a movie theatre, it's tough to ignore), it's just hard to get excited about this one, hence the feeling of being let down. Personally, I'm starting to lean towards bringing the Enterprise back to television, probably with Riker in command. With the myriad television series, the need for a movie series just isn't there anymore.

Eventually, this film will most likely take its place among the best of the movies, and certainly the best of the TNG movies, but so long as the spectre of the poor box office return looms over this film, it will continue to be counted among the turkeys.",1305504000,,1942,4.483050847457627

This is 'standard' STNG fare, really. The quality of the imagery and graphics/EFX is cinematic quality, of course, but the story line is not. This is not to say the story is no good. It is good. But it should have been more.

I guess this film, and the X that followed, demonstrate the fact that this series has run its course, with X being a very real failure in many ways, yet also watchable in a 'fan of the series' context.

Not a grand review, I know. But unless you really are a fan, this film - and X - really are below the standard set, first with the series, and then in the transition to films. With the exception of ST V, which I will probably never actually own because it was so poorly executed, all the Star Trek films are good. It's just that these last two, Insurrection and X, were a disappointment when held up to what came before.",1295049600,,1005,4.2513089005235605
1016232,5,6305365121,"Star Trek: Insurrection plays a lot like an unusually long episode of the original TNG series - for some (myself included) this is a good thing, but for others it is a source of disappointment.  The television series was popular for good reason, so I can't see the reinvoking of that atmosphere as a bad thing, especially following on the heels of the rather dark Star Trek: First Contact.  All of the cast seem to be enjoying themselves here, and the film still has plenty of great special effects (all digital, by the way) on land as well as in space - and I think the story is quite good, as well.  Best of all, there's no over-the-top buffoonery such as Data trying to function with his emotions implant installed.  It's true that this film does open with a Data malfunction, but there's nothing remotely silly about it, as it sets the stage for the crew of the Enterprise to defy the orders of a Starfleet admiral.

After receiving a communication informing him that Lt. Commander Data has gone berserk while helping observe the inhabitants of an alien world, Picard and the Enterprise head into an area of space dubbed the Briar Patch to capture Data and find out what went wrong.  Ignoring all of his Starfleet protocols, Data had revealed the presence of a joint Federation and Son'a taskforce to the Ba'ku people, refused to let team members leave the planet, and even fired upon the starship carrying the Son'a captain and Admiral Matthew Dougherty of Starfleet.  Clearly charmed by the nature of the Ba'ku and their peaceful nature, Picard refuses Admiral Dougherty's order to leave the system until he finds out what is really going on there.  The increasingly evident rejuvenating effects among crew members of time spent on the planet give him a pretty good clue.  What Picard ultimately discovers is a conspiracy that leads him and his officers to defy orders and commit themselves to defending the planet's people and culture from exploitation by the Son'a and Federation central command.

When the Son'a aren't getting their old and decrepit skin stretched by weirdly alluring alien females, they are grouching about the Federation bureaucracy that keeps getting in the way of their getting what they want.  The Son'a aren't' that intimidating at first glance, but F. Murray Abraham does a great job of giving the race a sinister edge through his performance as Son'a leader Ru'afo - he even gives vent to what is possibly the second most memorable scream in Star Trek franchise history.  The Ba'ku, in turn, are epitomized by the graceful and elegant Anji (Donna Murphy), a woman whose charms are not lost on Captain Picard.  I think Michael Piller's script doesn't get the respect it deserves, as it tells quite a good story that includes a nice little surprise or two along the way - and lends itself to philosophical debate for any viewers so inclined.  Star Trek: Insurrection may not have the extra wow factor some seem to expect in a Star Trek motion picture, but it plays out like a delightful reunion of characters from a show that millions of us loved.  That is more than enough to satisfy this TNG fan.",1293408000,,3130,4.759704251386322
1016233,4,6305365121,"Insurrection is hugely under-rated. It is by far the best of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/four-TNG-films/dp/6305609659/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">four TNG films</a>, the only one to really capture the spirit of the show. This is important, because TNG was in turn the only Trek show to really capture the humanist idealism that allegedly inspired creator Gene Roddenberry.

The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original-series/dp/B001DHXT6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original series</a>&nbsp;had an optimistic tone, and contained many interesting and thought-provoking episodes, but it was really more about Captain Kirk's epic, larger-than-life personality than anything else. But Captain Picard was a highly educated intellectual, the type of person who really does believe in all that stuff about peace, truth, and non-interference in alien cultures. Compared to the original series, TNG had more complex and morally ambiguous storylines, and Picard would often struggle with moral issues. Yet, he would eventually firmly insist on doing the right, principled thing, even if it went against the more ""realist,"" realpolitik view of his superiors.

Sadly, the TNG movies largely ignored this aspect of the show. Instead, they tried to make Picard into an action hero just like Kirk. For instance, the abysmal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Generations/dp/6305181721/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Generations</a>&nbsp;contains a goofy geriatric fist-fight involving Kirk, Picard and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caligula/dp/B000UJ48T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caligula</a>.

Insurrection is the only TNG movie to get it right. It's about a moral problem. In a remote area of the Federation, there's a planet with some kind of energy field that makes it so that all the inhabitants live forever, without aging. The planet is technically inside Federation borders, but it was never really explored. So, Federation authorities never made official contact with the indigenous population. For their part, the locals prefer to live in idyllic isolation, without outside visitors.

Clearly, the secret of eternal youth is valuable to the Federation, but Federation scientists don't know how to collect the magical planet energy. Along comes a band of ugly space thugs, led by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/F-Murray-Abraham/dp/B00006DEFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">F. Murray Abraham</a>, with the necessary technology to do this (and destroy the planet in the process). So, Starfleet decides to secretly join forces with the space thugs, and use them to do the dirty work of forcibly relocating the inhabitants of the planet. By chance, Picard and his gallant crew stumble upon this conspiracy, and hijinks ensue. Is it moral for the Federation to force the people off their planet, when they're not even Federation subjects? What about the involvement of the space thugs? Will Picard allow the corrupt Starfleet admiral to flout the declared ideals of the Federation? Ah, now there's a classic TNG setup.

Naturally, Picard stands up for principle, and opposes the conspiracy. But the focus is on the problem, not the individual villains. The leader of the space thugs is not very prominent. F. Murray Abraham gives a clipped, terse performance that is very understated, compared to the epic grandstanding of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ricardo-Montalban/dp/B0000683DH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ricardo Montalban</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christopher-Plummer/dp/B0000UJL96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christopher Plummer</a>. While the guy is much less exciting than Khan or Chang, that's the point. There's no Shakespearean greatness in his evil, he's basically just a run-of-the-mill hoodlum. The corrupt Starfleet admiral is a weak bureaucrat, opportunistic but not hugely evil, who never expected the scheme to turn deadly. The issue, that a Starfleet admiral would ever stoop so low, is more important than the individuals involved.

Perhaps this firm insistence on principle was what made the movie unpopular. For instance,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roger-Ebert/dp/0767910389/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roger Ebert</a>&nbsp;didn't see why it was so wrong to relocate the planet people. Granted, they seem a bit selfish, but they have a pretty sound argument. From a ""liberal"" viewpoint, forced relocation is cruel and inhumane, and from a ""conservative"" viewpoint, the planet is their property, which they never agreed to share with any big-government Federation. But, the honest message of Insurrection clashes with the recent trend in movies and TV to excuse the nominal ""good guys"" from any moral responsibility for their actions.

Among the crew, the movie mostly focuses on Picard and Data, as usual. But, Riker and Troi get a couple of great scenes, reminding us that their relationship was actually pretty important in the show. Geordi and Worf get a couple of good moments as well. Really, only Dr. Crusher gets stiffed; they can't seem to find anything for her to do in the TNG films. As for Data, the writers are miraculously able to put a new spin on his quest to be human, which had become a trainwreck after Generations gave him emotions. Now, despite having emotions, he suddenly realizes that he was never a child, and can never grow old, allowing us to see a bit of the calm yet puzzled Data of the good old days.

There are action scenes, but Picard's involvement in them is toned down compared to the other TNG films. The obligatory space battle is handled by Riker, while Picard shames the corrupt admiral with his stoic, principled defiance. That's the way it should be: Riker does the fighting, Picard does the thinking. Picard also gets a romance, which was probably unnecessary (if he really needed a hot older girlfriend, Dr. Crusher is right there), but is still much sweeter and more convincing than his bizarre interactions with Lily in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Contact/dp/6305127638/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Contact</a>.

The movie also has a light tone in many scenes. I could have gone without the part with the goofy singing, but other than that, the humour is cute without being irritating. Certainly it is miles above the horrible one-liners of Generations. It gives the movie a comforting feeling -- finally, the TNG crew does things that reflect their personalities as developed in the show, as well as their friendships. Bottom line: definitely the best TNG film, and the moral aspect puts it on par with some of the classic Trek films, as well.",1290729600,2,6928,6.21584984358707

1016237,5,6305365121,"Why is Insurrection good Star Trek? Because it comes off like an expanded episode from the TV show. Let us not forget that Star Trek at its base is a group of TV series, begun in 1966 and continued capably by NextGen. If a Star Trek movie doesn't fulfill the feeling you got from enjoying the TV series, in my mind it isn't doing its job. Are there some flaws in logic or plotting in this movie? Yes. Even good writers are not perfect. ""Wrath of Khan"" is regarded by many as the best of all Star Trek films, yet the list of logic errors, factual errors, and silly mistakes in TWOK will go on far longer than a similar list from Insurrection.

So what makes it good? First, the cinematography and effects are eye-popping. Second, the characters do the right things. They don't diverge from the characters we know from the TV shows. Third, you get to know and like the Baku culture, and care what happens to them. Fourth, you even feel sorry for the surviving bad guys at the end ... not easy to do. Fifth, the Enterprise crew doesn't make rookie mistakes that belied their competence in the TV series (as happens in both TWOK and Generations, for example).

Now I'll admit that I'm (mostly) easy to please when it comes to Star Trek. I was 9 years old in 1966 when it premiered on NBC, and watched the very first show broadcast. Like all the original fans, I lived through a 12 year stretch when there was not only no live action Star Trek, but no certain indication there ever would be again! Those of us with that perspective are more likely to be grateful for all the Star Trek we can get, and approach new shows and movies without preconceptions. So when I see a Star Trek movie that seems like an entertaining extended TV episode, I'm quite happy with it. I've watched Insurrection many times, and enjoyed it every time, for the reasons above. This cast was outstanding in their roles, and there are a finite number of those performances. I certainly won't criticize this one.",1285891200,3,1980,4.451790633608815

1016293,3,6305365121,"....I don't know.  Once again, it seemed less like a movie and more of a long episode of the television series.  The plot in this movie just seems too small for a feature film.  The film reminded me of two TNG episodes, Who Watches the Watchers and Journey's End.  The movie's effects aren't really up to par either.  I know this was right after First Contact, which had, in my opinion, the best special effects of all the Star Trek movies, but still, these effects were bad.  Effects like these would have been okay for an episode, but not a movie.  But let me go into greater detail.

The movie starts out with Data being part of a Federation science team observing the Ba'ku, a peaceful race of people on their homeworld.  Data malfunctions, and reveals the team to the Ba'ku.  Data is later captured and repaired by Picard and the Enterprise.  He doesn't remember what happened to him or why he malfuncioned.  Picard and his crew go to visit the Ba'ku people and find the Federation science team being treated very hospitably by the Ba'ku.  Picard and the Ba'ku retrace Data's steps and find that the science team have hidden a holoship near the Ba'ku village.  The holoship has a program of the Ba'ku village.  It seems someone was planning on beaming the Ba'ku away while they were asleep.  The next morning, they would wake up in the holoship and assume they are still in their village.  Now that's the first big plot point I have a problem with.  They thought they could trick the Ba'ku by putting them on a holodeck of their village, fine, but what if some of them wanted to leave the village?  Like, say, the children going somewhere to play, or the adults gathering food and crops.  Did they program the whole planet into the holodeck?  Were they actually planning on keeping the Ba'ku on the holoship forever?  The charade wouldn't have lasted long.  Eventually the Ba'ku would have figured out what was going on.  And the Federation would have had to forcefully keep them from returning to their planet.  So why didn't they just go down to the planet and order them to evacuate the planet in the first place?  And how did they know that all the Ba'ku would be asleep at the same time?  What if someone wanted to stay up and read, or talk with someone, or maybe they were just having trouble sleeping?

Anyway, once Picard learns the Federation's plans, he contacts them.  Now, it was established earlier that the Federation is working with the Son'a, a strange and as of this moment underexplained race of aliens.  They have skin that has been stretched over their faces, and try to hide themselves underneath cloaks.  They are mentioned in passing as being a violent and aggressive people, which makes you wonder why the Federation is involved with them at all.  It is then explained that the region of space that the Ba'ku homeworld is located in, called the Briar Patch, contains metaphasic radiation particles which rejuvinate you and keep you from aging.  The Federation and the Son'a are working together to collect the particles for the rest of the galaxy to use.  Picard then discovers that the Ba'ku are not native to the planet they live on.  They were a group of people who migrated to the planet several hundred years ago.  The Prime Directive, which states that the Federation cannot interfere in other cultures, does not apply here.  The Son'a and the Federation want to use a large harvester to collect the particles.  But doing so would leave the Ba'ku's planet uninhabitable.  If the particles were harvested while the Ba'ku were still on the planet, it would kill them all.  That's why the Federation wants to move them.  Picard objects that that goes against the Prime Directive, and the Admiral responds (correctly) that the Prime Directive doesn't apply here.  He says that they are only moving six hundred people, and they will be able to halp billions of people.  Picard responds with the following question:

""How many people does it take before it becomes wrong?  One thousand?  Fifty thousand?  A million?""

Dude, were you paying attention?  It's not their planet.  No one said they could have it, and moving them would not be wrong.  It is kind of selfish of the Ba'ku people to keep all the radiation for themselves.  The rest of the galaxy should be able to benefit from it.  But on the other hand, why couldn't they just ask the Ba'ku people to get up and move?  The Ba'ku might refuse, but at least the Federation tried to be polite.

I want to bring up an episode from the series, called Journey's End.  That episode had to do with the Federation and the Cardassians signing a treaty.  The treaty sets a boundary between the two groups.  A planet that had been given to some Native Americans was on the Cardassian side of the line, and so the inhabitants had to be moved.  While sympathetic to the Indians plight, Picard agreed to go along with the Federation's decision.  Not in this situation, though.  Picard decides to try to stop the Federation from beaming the Ba'ku off the planet.  The rest of the crew (who have also been experiencing the regenerative properties of the briar patch, but I don't want to go into it because all the scenes are just so stupid and corny, except maybe Geordi's) decide to help him.  Here we get possibly the stupidest exchange I've ever heard in my life:

Data: I feel obliged to point out that the environmental anomalies may have stimulated certain rebellious instincts common to youth, which could affect everyone's judgment, except mine of course.
Crusher: Okay Data. What do you think we should do?
Data: Saddle up (cock's phaser rifle).  Lock and load!

Picard sends Riker and Geordi along with the rest of the Enterprise crew to contact the Federation and explain the situation to them.  Even though the Federation are the ones who ordered the evacuation, and obviously know what is going on.  The Enterprise heads away from the Briar Patch, but are intercepted by two Son'a ships.  A battle ensues in space.  The Enterprise, being the Federation flagship, easily destroys the Son'a.....no, wait.  Enterprise runs away, pursued by the Son'a.  During this scene, we get so many stupid lines, like:

Riker: (after the Son'a fire on them) a photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Geordi: I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like somebody.

Or:

Riker: let's get closer to that cloud.  I want to collect some of it with the ramscoop.
Geordi: the purpose being?
Riker: the purpose being, I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.

These corny lines, combined with the silly scenes of the crew being affected by the Briar patch, have some people branding this as the worst Trek movie.  These stupid scenes and exchanges make the crew look like total idiots.

Picard, Data, Troi, Crusher, and Worf set up transport inhibitors to prevent the Son'a from beaming the Bak'u off the planet.  So the Son'a send isolinear tags to beam the people up.  Just picture Darth Maul's probe droids, and they shoot darts which enable the transporters to get a lock on you.  Most of the action scenes entailed the crew shooting the tags.  It got so boring after a while.  Eventually, Picard and Anij are tagged and transported to the Son'a ship.  Picard then reveals that, due to a blood scan, he has deduced that the Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race.  Years ago, a group of Ba'ku children tried to take over the planet.  They were unsuccessful, and were banished.  Now, it seems that Ru'afo, the Son'a leader, wants to expel the Ba'ku from the planet in an act of revenge.  When the admiral learns this, he tries to stop the mission, but Ru'afo kills him.

From this point on, I liked the movie.  There is only about twenty minutes or so left, but I still like it.  Picard breaks free, and he and Worf, along with one Son'a who has had a change of heart, attempt to stop the collector from collecting the particles.  The res of the movie is just cheesy action scenes and catchphrases, but to me it's still entertaining.  Picard destroys the collector, and Ru'afo is killed.  Riker successfully contacts Starfleet and explains the situation to them.  A full investigation is begun....which doesn't really guarantee that the Federation won't decide to do the same thing with the Briar Patch all over again.

Star Trek Insurrection is definitely one of the weakest Trek movies, bt it's still entertaining.  Just like Generations, it suffers from a small plot that wasn't really up to film standards.  It's basically just a long episode of the show.  And just like Generations, it has some serious plot contrivances that almost, but not quite, make it a bad movie.  Insurrection is a fairly entertaining movie, and I do re-watch it ocasionally.",1265155200,,8772,4.708360763660303

1016296,1,6305365121,"Behind and before the plot, all the setpieces in place make for a gorgeous tale of gray-scope morality, moral dilemmas, and ethical concerns.

Instead, the writers make the crew stick logic up our asses and go the hippie-liberal ""Screw you, coherency!"" route, while proceeding to arbitrarily make the ""bad guys"" seem irredeemably evil... about midway through the film.

The story set up is one with some very faint racist undertones, involving a group of ""perfect"" people living in a pre-industrial ""utopia"", and their planet happens to have some sort of natural thing which heals people of all their ailments, and keeps them from growing old and dying.  Consider that a complete ripoff of the Star Trek episode ""This Side of Paradise"".

These people, the Ba'ku, despite supposedly being in ""utopia"" and the sweet, pure, innocent, don't-say-Aryan innocents, show themselves to almost immediately be prejudiced, as when the crew confronts them, they point out Data, and say they don't want his kind among them, androids.

The supposed ""bad"" guys, the Son'a, are not like that at all.  In fact, a pull-away shot from the don't-say-Aryan Ba'ku village shows a cloaked Federation observation post, featuring all the sorts of people the Ba'ku don't have---blacks!  Non-humans!  Minorities galore!  All working with the Son'a.

But that undertone is one that is very subtle and subjective.

The REAL problem with the film that completely cripples it involves the conflict at hand between these two.

The Son'a are old as hell and dying, because of a reason revealed later in the film.  So they want to forcibly relocate the Ba'ku from their planet, so as to harvest the magic healy-stuff.  The Ba'ku refuse this, basically wanting no one to acquire this magic healy-stuff.

All possible logic blows apart like so many Enterprise-D ass-portions.

So Captain Picard and his crew decide to defend these don't-say-Aryan backwardass backwater arrogant arseholes because they don't want to share this incredibly revolution in medical technology with the galaxy?

Here are some facts that only serve to drive a huge nail of frustration into your head as you bang your head on a wall at the sheer stupidity of the plot:

- The Son'a are a FEDERATION MEMBER.
- The Son'a need this stuff to survive.  And since they are Federation members, they might be willing to, or be coerced into giving some of the healy-stuff to the scientists of the Federation to study and/or replicate in some way
- There are millions of Son'a and only SIX HUNDRED Ba'ku
- The Ba'ku will NOT let ANYONE harvest their magic healy-stuff, while they happily indulge in it and live for hundreds of years.

The wall-banging stupidity reaches infrastructure-destroying proportions when Jean-Luc Picard DARES!  DARES!  DAAAARES!  to compare the attempted relocation of the Ba'ku to ""past relocation events"" in Earth history, undoubtedly making reference to the Native Americans.

Native Americans: Millions of them, forcibly removed from their homelands and murdered wholesale, to sate the greed of the white men for natural resources and expansion of their land.  They suffered disease, starvation, freezing, and such events as genocide, the Trail of Tears, and exploitation and racism.  They now survive in a handful of thousands, with lots of land granted to tribes.

Ba'ku: Only six hundred of them, forcibly removed from their homelands, and treated well by a benevolent and peaceful Federation, likely settled on a similar planet, where they would likely receive Federation membership and representation and supplies given to them if they so need them.  If the Son'a/Federation is successful in replicating this magic healy-stuff, the entire conflict will be for nothing, as the Ba'ku can continue living their lives of perfect utopia.

Spock would be dead now, from slamming his head into a wall from the sheer stupidity of this.

At some point in the middle of the film, the screenwriters seem to remember, ""Hay, wait a minute!  Teh Son'a are supposed to be the BAD GUYS!"" and so out of butt-crack nowhere, the Son'a suddenly start screaming and wailing and behaving like irredeemable monsters, saying things like they don't care about Federation regulations, and would slaughter the entire Ba'ku race, and even having their leader murder a Federation Admiral who was previously helping them, just to make sure you're on the side of the hippie-liberal good guys like Picard and company.

Out of NOWHERE does this sudden SWERVE take place, causing the inevitable ""sidekick with a conscious"" heel-face turn as he helps Picard to thwart the Son'a plot.

On the plus side, character interactions are slightly better than in ""Nemesis"", and the political drama, when ignoring the sheer stupidity of the Enterprise's crew, seems tangible and full of potential.

1016362,4,6305365121,"There are several great character moments in this movie, and the pacing does move the story along well enough. However there is a bit too much political posturing for my taste, which, as I see it, is one of the big things contributing to making this movie play out like a big-budget, big-screen episode of the TV show.

Of course, there is also the lack of feel of galactic scope or personal investment in the story. The scope of Star Trek II was narrow: Khan's revenge. But the audience had personal investment in the characters from the episode ""Space Seed"". Star Trek IV had the impending destruction of Earth. VI had galactic peace looming in the horizon. First Contact had the assimilation of Earth by the Borg and Picard's personal quest to ""make them pay"". Here, we have a people on an alien planet facing the possibility of forced relocation. Nobody we've met before besides the crew. Nothing that has immediate repercussion for Earth.

To be fair, it was specifically designed to balance out the very dark tone of the previous movie with much more light fare. On that level, it does work. The nature of the Star Trek movies is that they are all different adventures that are placed in the same universe. The tone can change, since it does that on the TV series from episode to episode. But the story still needs to resonate with the audience.

Again, the crew has some nice character moments, and the special effects are actually quite well done, but those are not what Star Trek movies are built around. They're necessary elements, but the audience wants a ride they care about.

In the end, it is competently made and it is worth watching. Just know that it was, by design, a much lighter fare than First Contact.",1236038400,,1724,4.624183006535947

He turns on the Starfleet personnel he is working with and exposes the entire operation to those being observed:  the peaceful, seemingly simplistic Ba'ku.  When Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and company gets wind of these events, they set out to find their friend and hopefully save him.  A Starfleet Admiral who's part of the compromised mission (Anthony Zerbe) orders the Enterprise and her crew to get Data and then get out while he ""ties up a few loose ends.""  As usual with Star Trek, things aren't always what they seem and the Enterprise uncovers a Starfleet scheme that goes directly against the Prime Directive and an alien race that's out for revenge.  Will Picard go against his own loyalties with Starfleet in order to do what's right or will he be a good captain and accept his orders?  It's time to watch ""Star Trek:  Insurrection"" and find out.

Many fans of Star Trek find this particular film to be a bland and contradicting addition to the Trek catalogue.  They state that Starfleet Command would never pull a stunt such as the one in this film.  They gripe that the humor that litters this story is too distracting or out of character for the TNG cast.  Some of them have even gone so far as to say that this story is too sugary sweet.  In my opinion, it's all of these supposed contradictions that make ""Insurrection"" such a solid film.

Granted, it does play out somewhat like an extended episode of the TNG series, but it's still highly entertaining.  For one, the humor is a welcome addition to this tale.  So often I've felt that TNG was much too serious and needed to lighten up.  Enter Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn) to add much needed doses of comedy throughout this tale.  From the ""frisky"" feelings between Riker and Troi to Worf's puberty re-awakening, there's plenty to laugh at.  Having Starfleet go against the Prime Directive due to misdirection is nothing new.  Through technicalities and greed, their actions against the Ba'ku are justified.  As far as all of the sugary sweet moments go, it's actually rather touching to experience a sunrise through Geordi's (LeVar Burton) eyes and the interaction between Data and a young Ba'ku child.

This film also features some excellent space battles.  Perhaps some of the best in all of the TNG films.  The effects (except for a couple of obvious CGI ""face stretching"" moments) are top notch, and the make-up is flawless.  The musical score skillfully swings from threatening to lighthearted without skipping a beat.

The cast is top-notch.  The key members of the Enterprise crew really get to shine here.  From Stewart to Gates McFadden, the entire group does an excellent job.  F. Murray Abraham (in heavy make-up) provides a wonderful but somewhat hammy villain as the leader of the So'na.  Zerbe comes off a little bit stiff in his role, but does manage to convey the internal struggle he is suffering from quite well.  Of special note is Donna Murphy as Annij.  Not only is she strikingly beautiful, but her performance is one of the most heartfelt in the entire film.

Jonathan Frakes is at the helm of ""Insurrection"" as the director.  It amazes how well he does behind a camera.  I'm impressed each time I watch his work.

The DVD extras are great.  There are plenty of Easter eggs to be had for those with the patience to find them.  There's a fun look at the female aliens who've put sparkles in the eyes of numerous men aged twelve to ninety since the original series aired.  There's a few excellent deleted scenes, an archive, making-of documentaries, and a wonderful look at the creation of the aliens for both the films and the various television series.

Overall, I highly recommend ""Star Trek:  Insurrection.""  While it may be nothing more than a long episode of TNG, it's still a fantastic story.  With space battles, romance and plenty of humor, I give it four strong stars.",1215648000,,4058,4.785302593659942

And the Son'a, the exiled children of the Ba'ku, seeking revenge on their parents and using the Federation to help them is an interesting idea. The crew feels natural and you can sense a real chemistry between them in this movie. The acting is top-notch, especially by the main Son'a villain Ad'har Ru'afo. The relationship between Picard and the Ba'ku woman Anij is very intriguing as well.

The thing that bothers me about this one is the humor. I guess the intent was to go back to a light-hearted movie like ""The Voyage Home,"" but the humor doesn't work well in this movie like it did in ""Voyage."" In ""Voyage,"" the crew were on a past Earth with no imminent threat, so the humor fit in since they weren't under any real pressure. But with ""Insurrection,"" the crew is under attack from the Son'a and the humor seems out of place and awkward in light of the urgency of their situation. Not to mention some of the jokes are very cheesy - Data is a personal flotation device?! Huh?

So, altogether a good story with great acting but some misplaced (and sometimes cheesy) humor really disrupts the flow of the story and the feeling of threat and urgency. Not the worst of the Star Trek movies (""The Final Frontier"" still holds that distinction for me), but an average one.",1208649600,,1623,4.589655172413793

We see Data further explore humanity, and the good guys come to the rescue.  There is humor, pathos, integrity.  I cannot say enough about it.  The only thing missing is the future.  This story could be told in any time.  The science fiction aspects of it are almost irrelevant.  To all dedicated fans, you have to see this one.",1200873600,,431,4.246913580246914
1016411,3,6305365121,"""Star Trek: Insurrection,"" the ninth Star Trek feature film and third film outing for the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (ST:TNG) cast, is a solid action story, featuring a morality tale, humor, and for the first time in a while for a Trek film, romance. In addition, this movie features far more location shooting than any previous trek film, which gives the film a grand scale.

""Insurrection"" opens as the captain of the Federation Starship Enterprise, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), learns that one of his officers, the android Data, has apparently gone berserk and taken a cultural survey team hostage on a planet populated by the mysterious Ba'ku people.

Picard and his crew arrive at the Ba'ku planet, where the Federation and another alien race, the Son'a (a nasty looking group) are conducting the cultural survey of this village of 600 people. The Ba'ku are very intelligent and highly developed, but have adopted a simple life on this planet.

The Ba'ku village - filmed in Sierra Nevada and stunningly beautiful - is the most interesting and gorgeous set ever constructed for a Trek film. As the opening credits roll, the camera shows children playing, and a breathtaking view of a rural community built along a sparkling lake, mountains in the background, livestock grazing and simple, happy people living a peaceful life.

But the Ba'ku planet holds an amazing secret: Its inhabitants are over three centuries old. Unusual rings surrounding the planet have created a ""fountain of youth"" effect. Anyone who goes to the planet will grow younger and live forever.

The Enterprise crew soon learn that the ""cultural survey"" is only a cover for a sinister plot to kidnap the Ba'ku, exile them from their world, and exploit the planet's fountain of youth properties for the Son'a, who we learn are an ancient, dying race. The Federation also wants to exploit this special planet, and considers the Ba'ku expendable, and obstacles in the way of progress. Why spare a mere 600 people for a planet that can grant eternal youth to millions? Or billions?

What makes this change of policy so compelling for Star Trek fans is that Starfleet would previously never have embraced such a plan. But we are reminded that the squeaky-clean Star Trek of the original series and ST:TNG have given way to a more gritty, more dangerous universe. For the latter half of the current Star Trek TV series ""Deep Space Nine,"" Starfleet has been at war with several belligerent cultures - and is feeling the pressure. The glory days of the Federation are over, it seems.

Picard is furious: If an entire people can be forcibly removed, destroying their culture and way of life, when does it stop? How many people before the act is wrong? A thousand? Ten thousand?

""Who the hell are we to choose the next course of evolution for these people?"" Picard asks.

For Picard, the principles that the Federation is founded on have to be upheld. The Prime Directive - which maintains that any civilization must be permitted to develop at its own pace -- must be preserved. Picard takes a stand, deciding he must put his career and loyalties on the line, and protect the Ba'ku homeworld. Naturally, his entire crew join him in the rebellion.

Making moral choices has always been part of the Star Trek tradition, and the stand-out episodes and movies have been those that stay true to the original premise of the show - entertain the viewers, and have a strong message underneath. Whether the topic is warfare, birth control, drugs, prejudice, or even saving the whales, these are the best treks.

This time around, a benevolent government is being manipulated into doing something evil for a ""greater good."" The comparison to many of history's forced moves of a group of people by one more powerful -- such as the American Indians - is obvious.

But there's also a second underlying message - living in the moment. Picard's love interest, Anij, asks Picard, ""Have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time . . . when time seemed to stop . . . and you could almost lived in that moment?"" The Ba'ku have discovered that a single moment in time can be ""a universe in itself."" It's a terrific commentary about the insane pace of modern life - whether it be in the 24th century of Star Trek, or right now in the 20th.

The crew reacts to the planet's ""fountain of youth"" properties in many ways; the most amusing is the normally stoic Picard, who forgoes his usual classical music for a rumba, and then begins dancing to the music. The scene is absolutely endearing. The cast's youthful reactions inject this film with a great deal of energy, and fun.

My one complaint about the film is a scene where Picard pursues Data in a shuttle-chase through the Ba'ku planet's atmosphere. Unable to reach through Data's temporary dementia, Picard recalls that Data had been rehearsing a scene from HMS Pinafore and breaks into song. This gets through to Data, who begins singing as well. It's an embarrassing moment, clearly played for laughs, and the film would be better without it.

Still, the movie will appeal to trekkers and non-trekkers alike. The story is compelling and also fun. With over fifty standing sets and far more location shooting than any previous Star Trek film, the movie feel bigger. The exodus of the Ba'ku at night is pure Cecil B. DeMille. There are space battles, computer generated pets (as in the Lost in Space film), armed conflict and lots of action, and of course, the Enterprise once again gets hammered by enemy fire. Picard has a real love interest, and all the regular ST:TNG supporting characters have interesting roles (including regulars Riker and Troi, who rekindle their previous romance). In fact, it's very obvious that the cast had a lot of fun making the film - they've so grown into their roles that they, for the first time, feel like ""real people."" It's unusual to see Star Trek characters acting so... well... so colorful and animated. The on-screen camaraderie, friendship and romance is very believable. It all makes for an exciting, interesting film.

Joining the cast this time are F. Murray Abraham as the sinister Son'a leader Ru'afo, who won an Oscar for Best Actor as Amadeus. Picard's love interest Anij is played by Donna Murphy, a Tony Award winner for her performances in The King and I and Passion. Anthony Zerbe, who plays Starfleet Admiral Dougherty, won an Emmy Award for his role on ABC-TV's Harry O, and has appeared memorably in such films as Cool Hand Luke, Papillon, and License to Kill.

Regular cast member Jonathan Frakes, who did a commendable job directing the previous Trek film, has also directed episodes of ST:TNG, Trek's ""Deep Space Nine,"" and ""Voyager,"" as well as Diagnosis: Murder and University Hospital.

Star Trek remains a profitable franchise for owner Paramount, with films, television shows, books and other merchandize grossing more than $1 billion worldwide. This film's predecessor, ""Star Trek: First Contact,"" produced the biggest opening-weekend gross of any of the Star Trek films, and earned $92 million at the box office.

I don't wish to give away any plot elements, but in order to adequately review the movie, I must make some minor ""spoilers."" This film highlights one of the ethical dilemmas that has come to be a hallmark of Star Trek since its inception. In a move rather similar to that of President Jackson in relocating the Southeastern Native American tribes, Starfleet officials in league with a shady group of aliens conspire to remove a primitive people from their world so that Federation citizens may reap the benefits of an unusual healing radiation emenating from the rings of said planet. Picard, ever the force of truth and justice, refuses to go along (hence the ""Insurrection"" title), leading to a battle between good and ""greater good.""

On the whole, I feel this was the most well-written and executed TNG Trek film. While I personally adored the previous 2, I thought their storylines were a bit contrived (not to mention the continuity errors caused by Kirk's ""death"" at the beginning of Generations). The deeper storyline of this movie is both its weakness and its strength; I had a bit of a problem following the plot the first time I saw the film, but after I was able to appreciate it, I realized how much better of a storyline it actually is.

More like an episode of the series than an actual motion picture, I personally believe the script should be blamed as the director, Jonathan Frakes (Will Riker himself) did an amazingly wonderful job on the previous entry in the series, Star Trek: First Contact. The film suffers from a lack of a significant and powerful villain. Never the less, there's a lot of fun to be had here. The crew seems more like a family again.",1172534400,2,500,4.5054945054945055
1016504,4,6305365121,"Star Trek fans and other viewers have long derided this film for what it did not do.  It did not follow on from the tension and excitement in First Contact, and it did not on the other hand live up to the pre-film hype that it would return to the humour of Star Trek IV.

However, with benefit of hindsight, this is in fact one of the Next Generation movies that does live up to Roddenberry's ideal - there is a real theme and message here that Roddenberry would have been happy to put his name to.

The story starts when Data, involved in a duck-blind observation of the Ba'ku, a peaceful 'new-age-y' sort of race, goes apparently rogue.  Picard and crew come to investigate, only to find that the planet may have the secret to eternal youth, and the observers have more than observing in mind - they plan the mass eviction of the Ba'ku.  Picard is placed in a position of choosing between principle and his career, living out the moral centre ideal that Roddenberry loved so much.

There are elements of humour, some welcome fan appreciated vignettes, such as Geordi having a chance to see, Riker and Troi becoming close again, and the story moves along at a respectable pace.  Set design is impressive, and the movie benefits from more on-location sets than any other Next Generation movie, giving it a unique identity.  However, the darker edge IS missed, and while good, the movie never quite reaches the heights of some of its predecessors, or explores the themes quite as much as you would want it to.

So this particular disc will live or die on the extras - and they are a worthy set.  Sadly, there is no director's commentary by Frakes, but there is a text commentary for the Trek Trivia inclined, by Michael and Denise Okuda.  On the second disc there are small chunk sized featurettes on production, special effects and the Star Trek Universe, as well as deleted scenes and archive photos and storyboards.  The deleted scenes are of interest, but were rightfully dispensed with to maintain pace.  The featurettes are often PR fluff, but quality fluff that genually educates on special effects in particular.  One standout is the interview with the writer Michael Piller who is surprisingly candid about the end script, and gives some fascinating insight into what the script evolved from - the earlier drafts which were more of a 'Heart of Darkness' story, must have been fascinating!

All in all, if you don't have it, then this is definitely the one to get.  If you have it already then you probably have all you need to have to form your own opinion of the movie.

If you have not seen the movie - don't be put of by the negative talk - sure, this is no Wrath of Khan, but it is probably (arguably!) the second best of the Next Generation movies.",1170892800,3,2761,4.567951318458418

Initially, the android Data goes crazy and uncontrollable for a while, but then he is captured by Worf and his memory circuits are fixed.

Picard briefly dances to the sound of latin american mamba. He meets an alien woman (from the ""baku"" people) who is 300 years old.

So she considers Picard (who is about 60 years old) to be a very young man. Picard actually falls in love with her.

Various jokes are told throughout the movie.

For example, Will Riker shaves himself and his face becomes smooth as an ""android's butt"" :)

Then Worf's hair start growing very long, because he is undergoing... puberty :)

It is a real surprise to see F. Murray Abraham, whom I have remembered as playing a role in a movie about the past

(the composer Salieri in AMADEUS), but I didn't expect to see him in a movie about the future.

His face is covered with so much make-up, that he is almost unrecognizable.

There is a conflict with the ""sona"" people, who want to exterminate the peaceful ""baku"" people.

This is really ungrateful on the part of the ""sona"", becuase genetically, ""sona"" people are identical with the ""baku"".

'generations' had so many holes in the storyline it wasn't even funny...(why didn't they go back while he was still on the ship, instead of five seconds before he was about to fire again...and why was picard so insistant on wanting to go back, when everyone said he would only want to stay...and, did they really come back to the planet, or were they still in the nexus, and kirk didn't really die...)...too many questions, very few answers...and yet, it still comes in second place...(that says alot about the other two...)

1016511,4,6305365121,"When ""Star Trek: First Contact"" was released to huge box office numbers, it was evident to Paramount Pictures that audiences were still extremely interested in this franchise, and were responding very well to the new crew.  So, wasting little time Paramount greenlit the 8th sequel in the franchises history, ""Star Trek:  Insurrection"", but this 'Star Trek' movie would be of a different mold than previous installments, and would that spell fortune or disaster for this lucrative franchise?

""Star Trek:  Insurrection"" begins with the crew of the Enterprise-E being notified by Starfleet that their android comrade, Data (Brent Spiner), while on a research mission has gone rogue.  Picard (Patrick Stewart) convinces Starfleet to let him and the rest of the crew of the Enterprise-E be the ones to bring Data in before someone gets seriously hurt.  When the crew arrives to confront Data, they discover that all is not as it seemed, and though Starfleet is indeed conducting research on this strange planet that holds the key to immortality, they are also planning something much more dastardly.  Starfleet, in association with an alien race, are planning to remove the people that inhabit this planet so that they may plunder the planet's resources for the ""benefit of mankind"", what they fail to mention, or realize is that by removing these people, their bodies will begin to age rapidly to catch up with the amount of years they have been alive, which could mean death for many.  With orders from Starfleet demanding the Enterprise leave the planet immediately, and their own consciences telling them to stay and defend these people, the crew must decide on which side they will stand.  Let the insurrection begin!

I thought that this film was another great installment into the 'Star Trek' franchise, though I feel it is weaker than say ""Star Trek:  First Contact"", it was still a very entertaining film.  I know that some fans were unhappy with this particular outing, feeling that it was too romantic and funny, with not enough sci-fi action for their taste.  I personally enjoyed the change in pace that this film gave to the series, after such an extremely action-heavy film with ""Star Trek:  First Contact"", the next movie needed to slow things down a bit, or else run the risk of being judged as having not enough story and too much action in the series.  Basically, it was a no-win situation, and I think Paramount and the creative forces behind this film made the right decision in terms of what was best for the franchise as a whole.

The actors all did wonderful jobs with their individual character arcs in this film, and this is where much of the movie's humor stems from, because each character begins to feel the effects of the planet making them younger, many funny moments come from Worf (Michael Dorn) going through a 2nd Klingon puberty, and another from Data overhearing a comment made by Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) regarding their breasts becoming firmer.  However, humorous this all is, there is still some heavy dramatic beats when the crew realizes what will happen to the people of this planet if Starfleet has its way, and all the youthful enhancements they are experiencing pale in comparison to the pain this people will soon endure.  Jonathan Frakes (who directed and starred in the film) does an excellent job leading his co-stars, his talent for direction is very well-honed, and he handles the more romantic story in a very cool way by having many of the camera movements be more lyrical, almost like the camera is dancing with the actors in the scene, a choice that heightens the mood of the movie even more.

Overall, this entry into the 'Star Trek' franchise, though not the strongest, is still very solid, and definitely worth owning.  Don't listen to the critics that hated this movie, if you're a fan of 'Star Trek' then watch this movie, you will be entertained.

1016573,5,6305365121,"I've been a Star Trek fan for a long time, and for the most part I agree with most people on the Trek movies.  For instance, I think Nemesis, is horrible.  But then I hear people saying this is a horrible movie.  I have to disagree, this movie is great.

One of the things that I love about Star Trek, is how the episodes are all about contempory and controversial issues, that is what this movie is all about, issues.  Society at large in this movie have decided that they can take advantage of a civilization because it benefits them more than it benefits this group of people.  This movie is much more complex than many of the older movies (and definitely more complex than the one movie that's newer).

What makes any movie great?  Issues that are covered in the movie that challenge society, I feel that this is something that's in any movie that is successful over the years, and this movie does that.",1141171200,4,907,4.421686746987952
1016574,4,6305365121,"The ninth caper in the Trek movie franchise initially received mixed reactions from fans, but it's definitely worth looking at a second time.

Some viewers scoffed at the notion that the Federation could have ""mis-used"" the Prime Directive, but in the Trek universe, anything's possible. Lapses in judgment and logic were part of Gene Roddenberry's ""morality play"" from the beginning. And besides, isn't this what makes good drama?

Capt. Picard is caught in a moral dilemma: Obey Federation orders and help ""forcibly"" relocate a peaceful alien race from their ""fountain-of-youth"" regenerating planet so that it can be ""strip-mined"" to help millions of others; or, oppose the Federation and defend this weaponless, technology-denounced, simple folk?

F. Murray Abraham plays the principal villian, Ru'Ofo, with over-the-top theatrical flair (not easy to do under a grotesque mask of prosthetics). His character becomes the chief motivator in trying to remove the Ba'Ku off the planet.

There are wonderful moments in subplot: Due to temporary exposure to the planet's regenerative effect, Riker and Troi rekindle their romance (as a result, Riker shaves off his beard!); Worf re-experiences Klingon puberty (complete with accelerated hair growth and acne); and the most heartfelt moment comes when LaForge's eyesight is temporarily restored, allowing him to see a sunrise for the first time, tears welling in his eyes. It's definitely LeVar Burton's finest moment.

There's also a sweet romance between Picard and a lovely Ba'Ku woman (Donna Murphy), as well as a poignant & charming friendship between the child-like Data and a 12-year old boy, who initially rejects him because he's a machine, but then grows to like Data.

But the moral issue embodies itself in the person of Admiral Dougherty (veteran actor Anthony Zerbe), who becomes entangled by his loyalty to the Federation and his faust-like partnership with Ru'Ofo.

There are some great action scenes here: Picard's retrieval of a malfunctioning Data in an exciting scout ship chase; the previously-mentioned malfunction, as a berserk Data jeopardizes a surveillance mission; and Ru'Ofo's scout ships swooping down and shooting ""transporter tags"" on the Ba'Ku.

But no Trek film would be complete without light comedy touches:

  Picard: Mr. Worf, are you familiar with Gilbert & Sullivan?

  Worf: No sir, I have not had a chance to review the crew roster.

  ---------------------------------------

  Riker (spotting a giant zit on Worf's face): You Klingons don't do anything small, do you?

  ---------------------------------------

  Worf (speaking to Picard from the alien vessel): They would like to discuss terms of surrender...it may also have something to do with having only 3 minutes of air left!

This a worthy addition to the Trek franchise, with Picard and crew sort of riding in like ""the Magnificent Seven"" and saving the day as they stand up for what they believe in.",1139529600,3,2949,5.368191721132898
1016575,3,6305365121,"Is it time for me to restate the oft-repeated explanation about odd vs even Star Trek films? Long story short: even good, odd bad. While I did like Generations(#7) and Search for Spock(#3), Insurrection(#9) does have some quite big concerns and plot holes and even a bit bad attempted humor but after being very dark with First Contact, it's nice to see them lighten up for once.

On a planet, there's a secret investigation that's sanctioned by Starfleet: the spying on and eventual removal of a race called the Bak'u or is it B'aku? Anyways, there's something special about the planet: some kind of radiation in the planet regenerates celluar structure continously. In layman's terms, fountain of youth. So of course it's no surprise Starfleet wants in which goes against the Prime Directive, meaning they can't interfere in the development of societies.

The race that's bringing out this is the Son'a, a race who try to extend life by going stretchy faced. With help from a rogue Starfleet Admiral, they try to keep the Enterprise off the planet and gone but wants our favorite crew realizes it, they go against orders and try to save the B'aku.

The film in a way has a tone that resembles The Voyage Home(#4, another fan favorite althought not saying 9 is). Voyage Home was largely character and humor based so it was very atypical but that's what made it special. To watch your favorite characters have fun was what made it appealing. Sort of the same with Insurrection although some of the humor is flat. The HMS Pinafore use, a ""firmer boobs"" joke and Worf's bit of puberty just comes across as lowbrow humor rather than just being very funny.

It is however a Star Trek movie so we can expect some cool action scenes and cool set pieces. To me, one of which stands out which is why the Enterprise takes on a Son'a ship in the middle of a nebula(Wrath of Khan anyone?) One thing that did strike me though was the set design. Meant to be shown as a kind of idyllic vacation-like village, it surely looks like somewhere you'd love to spend your summer. Very nicely done and beautifully photographed.

Performances are typical across the board, each character plays just like their character would so don't expect Oscar caliber(really, Star Trek for acting awards? That'll be the day.) Although disappointingly is F. Murray Abraham as main village Ru'afo. Villains like Khan stood out cause although they essentially badmouthed our heroes, you felt something when they were disposed of(namely ""take that punk!""). Here when our villain gets his comeuppance it's just simply ""well there he goes.""

It's not as bad a Star Trek as one would claim(that honor is fought between Nemesis and Final Frontier) but it is an entertaining B-movie with A level cast and production.",1135036800,,2773,4.80293501048218
1016576,4,6305365121,"This is a solid Star Trek movie, but slightly more disappointing than Generations or First Contact.

""Lost Horizon"" is plagerized, but that's okay... it's a wonderful theme.

 The ""Ba'ku' are very dull, however. They putz about, growing crops, making quilts, baking and playing with the children... but they don't seem to have any purpose! They ENJOY life, but is ""enjoyment"" all that life is about?

As contrasted with the Amish, at least the Amish have a defined spirituality and an expectancy of Heaven. Right or wrong, they have a future purpose. To the Ba'ku, their current life IS HEAVEN... and they are seemingly immortal. I wouldn't want to live forever, if all life entailed was farming, quilting or picking flowers.

The Ba'ku homeworld is a ""beautiful place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.""

The Son'a... the villians, are a good concept. An aging group who desire immortality. Their vanity isn't their ultimate goal... it's their satirical obsession as they stretch their skin to unrecognizable lengths.  Michael Jackson and Mary Tyler Moore should see this film.

F. Murray Abraham is a brilliant actor, even in ludicrous make- up.

The effects are good... especially the depiction of the ""Briar Patch."" Alas, ILM seems to have a better touch with the starship effects.

the ""Shuttle chase"" is a great sequence... which made me expect more excitement... that unfortunately didn't come.

The humor is great... albeit, overdone at times. Worf's pimple still makes me crack up.

The scenery is exceptional... great location shooting! Star Trek finally escapes the desert!

Complaints would be that the battles are fleeting and unfulfilling.

The starship battles leave you ""wanting more.""

 Crew members firing at dart shooting drones flying through the air has all the drama of shooting cardboard ducks at a carnival.

And most definately... TOO MUCH TECHNO- BABBLE!! This film has the most techno gibberish than any other Trek film.

For instance, I would call the episode Symbiosis average.  This movie is like Symbiosis, except longer.  I would give Symbiosis 3.5 stars, but I would give Insurrection 3, just because Insurrection is longer than it needs to be.

1016638,3,6305365121,"Despite my 3 star rating (I would give it 3.5 if I had the choice), I consider myself a defender of ""Star Trek: Insurrection.""  I think that this Star Trek film deserves points for trying big things, even if some of them didn't work.  Some people have accused this of being the ""lazy milking dry of a cash cow,"" (DVD Journal) but I see a lot of energy and love in this production.  True, there are many problems with it.  ""Insurrection"" doesn't fail as miserably as ""The Final Frontier,"" but there is something fundamentally dissatisfying about it.  Nonetheless, it is quite enjoyable, and indeed somewhat underrated.

""Insurrection"" both tackles a big issue and tries to be relevant to the current world situation.  The film argues that hurting a native population in order to obtain a valuable natural research is never justifiable, even if that population is miniscule.  Though many may disagree with its logic that the lives of 600 people are more important than helping billions, it is still easy to see Captain Picard's (a terrific as usual Patrick Stewart) moral center and to root for him.  For making a film with this risky message, I give ""Insurrection"" a certain leeway that I don't give ""Nemesis"" (which is a standard action film).  Tackling big issues like this is what Star Trek was meant to be in the first place.

""Insurrection""'s primary failure is the lack of tension.  The action in here is surprisingly formulaic, especially coming off of the rousing action of ""First Contact.""  Also, I think that this movie's strength is in its moral ambiguity at the beginning, so removing that renders the climax pretty flat.  Rather than Picard taking on the whole Federation, as would have been powerful, a two-dimensional villain is force fed to us instead in the form of R'uafo.  F. Murray Abraham is competent as R'uafo, but he is a pretty uninteresting character, and his inevitable end (""Nemesis"" was yet to come, after all) is pathetic.

However, one thing I like in this movie that others don't is the comedy.  Despite its big subject matter, this is a pretty light film.  It is like ""The Voyage Home"" and not ""The Final Frontier"" in that much of the humor is actually funny.  The ""Next Generation"" actors here are all having fun in their roles, and are probably more energetic than they were in any other of their four films.

""Insurrection"" has some major problems, but I think that it is overall a solid Trek entry.  Those searching for an epic were disappointed (though I would argue there hasn't been an ""epic"" Trek film attempted since ""The Search for Spock""), but it's good to enjoy ""Insurrection"" as light-hearted fun with some beloved characters.  For an odd-numbered entry, this isn't all bad.",1118620800,,2719,4.814655172413793

Definitely not a bad film just underwhelming.  Also nice to see that F. Murray Abraham is still working since Amadeus and Last Action Hero.",1118620800,,536,4.494845360824742
1016640,3,6305365121,"Having just viewed STAR TREK: INSURRECTION for the first time since it's initial theatrical release, I will say that the  passage of time has been rather kind.  Though I found it to be an extremely disappointing entry in the franchise the first time around, my revisit to the third NEXT GENERATION offering has yielded better results.

Taking a more light hearted approach than before, screenwriter Michael Pillar provides genuine laughs with his story as the crew attempts to prevent a race of people called the Ba'ku from being wrongfully removed from a planet of eternal youth by their enemy race, the Son`a.  The Federation's involvement in these nefarious plans draws quite obvious parallels to the historic wrongs done to the  Indians here in America over the last two centuries.  Jonathan Frakes again takes the directorial reigns and seems to really be enjoying himself, along with the entire cast.  Not all of the humor works, however, as we are occasionally subjected to embarrassing moments such as  the infamous ""breast"" conversation between Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi, Worf's pimple, Data's ""lock and load"" moment, and a few other not-too-funny moments.  Overall, the humor does work and is balanced well with the stories more action oriented sequences.

The story this time around is bit slow moving, but it offers up plenty of wonderful character moments for the cast along the way.  Geordi getting his sight back and watching his first sunrise as we would see it was very touching, reminding me of how good LeVar Burton is when the writers bother to utilize his talents.  Picard is finally given a romance again, after what seems to be an eternity of their having forgotten the Captain`s romantic side.  In regards to the characters, the movie excels, though the plot itself is founded on rather shaky ground at times.  As the story moves along, we are presented with an alien race obsessed with cosmetic surgery as the primary villains.  This is laughable at best and makes it hard to take their threat seriously.  I cannot help but think this was added as an excuse to use more silly latex facial appliances on the actors.  Also, the story is bogged down by silly plot twists towards the end, such as the ingenious last minute use of the holo-deck ship.  The space battles were not well written, resorting to silly ideas like ejecting warp cores to counter the effects of some kind of unexplained new weapon, as well as steering a huge starship via Nintendo joystick.  For every scene that made me enjoy this movie, there was another one that left me scratching my head in frustration.  Not helping matters was the not-so-special digital effects themselves, to which I can only ask the question, ""Where was Industrial Light & Magic when we needed them?""

We are treated to three new guest stars in this adventure.  Donna Murphy plays Picard's Ba'ku love interest, Anij, who shares some wonderful on screen chemistry with Patrick Stewart.  F. Murray Abraham plays the leader of the Son'a called Ru'afo.  Impatience is the key word here, and Abraham is never really given anything to work with that would humanize his character too much outside of typically bland villainous  motivations.  He does his best (while hidden away underneath ludicrous makeup), but not enough material was given to Abraham to allow him to become anything more than a generic antagonist.  Anthony Zerbe plays Vice-Admiral Dougherty of Starfleet.  He is actually quite good here, playing a man who genuinely wants to share the prospects of eternal youth with the galaxy, but through his dealings has lost his own ability to see the  immediate wrongs about to be perpetrated.  Zerbe brings to surface the aspects of a character that shows his regret at the direction things are going, but is powerless to truly stop it at this point.

This two disc special edition treatment Paramount has given us is another winner, I must say.  We are given the now expected text commentary by Michael and Denise Okuda which is always interesting, but curiously enough there is no audio commentary accompanying this outing.  Rounding out the first disc is a wonderful DTS soundtrack for the film that adds a great deal to the viewing experience.

The main attraction on Disc 2 is of course the deleted scenes, which oddly enough are not listed anywhere on the DVD packaging.  Seven scenes are offered up for this film, including the alternate ending.  A few of the extra scenes are preceded by comments from co-producer Peter Lauritson as he explains why the scene was deleted.  There are two scenes of note here:  ""The Kiss"" features Picard and Anij sharing a passionate kiss as time slows down around them, depicting one of those special moments in one's life spoken of earlier in the film.  ""Alternate Ending"" depicts villainous Ru'afo as he is stranded aboard the Injector pod.  After choosing to remain in the projectile rather than admit his failure, the pod is launched  into the rejuvenating rings of the planet with the Son'a leader aboard, causing him to become younger and younger.  It is explained that studio executives thought this ending was weak, but I feel that it would have suited the story quite well and actually fit the ideals of Star Trek much better than the more generic explosive ending we were given.

There are many interviews and mini-documentaries that give an informative look behind the scenes of the film, but ""The Story"" stood out as the best.  In it, Michael Pillar provides lots of insight as to what inspired the story, as well as how and why differing elements were altered along the way.  Plenty of effects interviews, storyboards, trailers, and photo galleries abound, as well as two interesting retrospectives; one featuring the career of make-up artist Michael Westmore and the other devoted to the women of Star Trek.

There is less action than in First Contact, but there's still sufficient action to liven it up.

1016642,4,6305365121,"Before ""Nemesis"" came around, ""Insurrection"" was the film highly debated and spoken about. Was it good? Bad? What went wrong, what did they do right? I think critics, and some reviewers, are a little harsh when it comes to this film. I'll say that it's a light-hearted film. It followed ""First Contact,"" which featured the Borg and humanity itself being on the line. ""Insurrection"" is, in my opinion, original in that it deals with new enemies, new aliens, and has Picard actually seeing the darker side of the Federation.

I say that this release redeems the film in that it fleshes it out more. There's lots of commentary on the production of the film, on it's development, on what went wrong and right. Those responsible for the script speak candidly about the changes in the script and ""what could have been"" while ending on ""this is what happened."" What I liked was that Frakes and Michael Piller don't pretend to like the script. They don't dress-up their commentary or act as if the film was perfect. They explain a lot and I came out of it actually liking the film even more.

The film does have over 2 hours of special features. No audio commentary feature like the origianl DVD release, but I didn't miss it because I felt it was made-up for in the bonus features.

In the production section, there are featurettes such as ""It Takes a Village,"" ""Location, Location, Location,"" and ""The Making of Star Trek Insurrection"" which has commentary from Frakes, Stewart, McFadden and Sirtis, as well as Donna Murphey and F. Murray Abraham about all the thoguht that went into the creation of the Ba'ku and the change of scenery from the usual starship/space backdrop to an actual planet-side story. Stewart had a lot to do with how the film came out, so he does nothing but gush about how great it is. I actually enjoyed hearing from the members of the cast who usually have smaller roles. This is a film that actually gives a lot of attention and time to the supporting cast. I also found ""Director's Notebook"" to be a great explanation for the film. Frakes comes out and says that the script wasn't as great as ""First Contact"" but explains in depth how he and the others tried to work it. There's even a part of the interview when Frakes is unable to talk because he's just laughing histerically. Perhaps that doesn't help the film, but it definately was interesting to hear all that he had to say, or laugh about. ""The Story"" features Michael Piller's side of the story and how the film was developed.

I found the ""Creation the Illusion"" section to be the weakest. They explain how the shuttle chase at the start of the film, the duck blind, and the drone scene were developed. Really, I found these to be dragging and rather dull. They could have explained the Briar Patch construction or the big battle scene between the Enterprise and the Son'a vessels. Instead, it goes for some smaller scenes that didn't need much explaination. I did enjoy all the jokes being dished about Spiner and the Data underwater scene.

""The Star Trek Universe"" section contains one feature on Westmore's Aliens and one on the alien women of Star Trek. I actually enjoyed both. I liked hearing how Westmore created not just the aliens for this film but how he's designed and developed them over the years. This contains footage and commentary on all of Trek, not just The Next Generation or this film. The ""Star Trek's Beautiful Women"" was a nice segment as well. Perhaps a tad bit sexist, because we certainly don't have entire segments devoted to Star Trek's men, but it was still entertaining. It too contained footage from all the shows and films. Even Robert Picardo (Voyager), Connor Trineer (Enterprise), Chase Masterson (Deep Space Nine), and the actress who portrayed Jadzia Dax on Deep Space Nine took part in interviews for this segment. I found Marina Sirits, as usual, to be hilarious and her commentary quite interesting, putting it mildly.

There are also a lot of deleted scenes included. The film on these is rather low at times and hard on the eye, but all of the deleted scenes were fun to watch. I enjoyed the extended Troi/Riker flirting in the library scene as well as the alternate ending. I wish the cut Quark appearance could have been included, but the many deleted scenes also made this release worth buying it.

As for the transfer quality, I thought it was okay. Some have been complaining that it's distracting at times because it's so high quality, but I didn't think so. Sound was great.

""Insurrection"" is not the best film but it's not the worst either. I saw it as a big episode, and perhaps that's where the movie is flawed. I do think the humor at times made it weak and wonder how they could have turned the film into a sci-fi comedy, or how Picard could turn into another Kirk and fall in love with a woman within 24 hours and yet show no feelings at all towards Beverly Crusher ... when Riker and Troi's romance was rekindled by being around this planet ... but all that aside, it's a decent film and a great DVD release chocked full of bonus features to please any fan. There are also three easter eggs, two including Marina Sirtis. She and Dorn have a hilarious hidden feature where she asks ""what is this film about?"" and he tries to explain it.

1016697,4,6305365121,"To non-fans of Star Trek,there is the""odd numbered film curse"",which odd numbered Trek film come off as disappointing (finally broken with Star Trek Nemesis).

Usually the problem is the filmakers second guessing fan expectation after the sucess of an even numbered film, injecting a bigger budget

The budget was more than the average box office take of the other films. Overall Insurrection was a better movie than most of the Oddies(except 3).It had some very funny moments,and Patrick Stewart seemed to be having fun as Picard. But one can't help but feel the story would've been better suited on TV.And considering the great quality of DS9 episodes with the Dominion War,you also feel the writers should've strived for more on the big screen.

As expected the Box office tally was lower than expected. But in the end,it was a very entertaining film but you feel it could've been better.",1117756800,,891,4.966442953020135
1016698,4,6305365121,"To date:

""Generations"" felt like a looooong TV episode, whose villains were second-rate Klingons and a man we'd rather pity.  Add in another version of the Enterprise, numerous TV show tie-ins, a lame explanation of Guinan's origins that put a huge spanner into many elements of Trek's historical canon, altered motivations (Guinan first says it's impossible to go in but 3 sentences later says if Picard goes in he can't get out... okey dokey, then...), and you've got a mess.  Now it's got its moments, and there is a tremendous intellectual appeal that just about saves it for some (myself included) but it's hardly major movie fare.  ""All Good Things"" would have been a better choice...

""First Contact"" is a worthless cameo-ridden farce, jumbling all sorts of fan favorites with very little coherence.  Yes, yes, the feds don't trust Picard to fight the Borg.  Yup, that's why they gave him their new flagship...  Yes, there's time travel.  To a period nobody can relate to.  Threat of destroying the ship too, I mean that's okay as there are plenty of letters left in the alphabet, right?  (how about sacking an inept captain for mindlessly destroying his own ship?!)  And, of course, the Borg themselves...

But this review shouldn't be about a sloppily-written , over-reaching, made-for-movie TV-episode followed by that total wretch of a farce!

""Insurrection"" dares to be new.  It dares to be different.  It dares to keep TV show references to a minimum; I for one didn't need to know all of the events of Deep Space 9 (aka ""Deep Sleep 9"") to know that the feds have been in a bunch of wars.  Not being able to stand DS9, it was nice to see how this in-reference was handled.  Indeed, this movie takes this fact and tries to BUILD on it, saying how the federation is a lame duck and it knows it's about to collapse if they get more involved with more enemies.  Indeed, that's an (unintentional?) in-joke to the Bermantrek franchise as, by 1998, things were ALREADY getting beyond trite...  where else could they go except to knock down the foundations of the dilapidated house?

Picard gets so angry at the Federation that he is inclined to resign in a big huff'n'puff scene that's actually very well acted.  If it weren't for the rubbish flick that preceeded ""Insurrection"", this scene would be much more powerful.  (it was to me, but many a reviewer said the same thing, albeit more undeservedly kindly...)  Instead, it reminds people unfortunate enough to have seen ""First Contact"" that Picard had violated orders before.  And in FC, he does so in a pantomime way that's too typical for that flick.  But, again, I digress.  ""Insurrection"" gets it right, without the camp comedy to muck things up.

Speaking of comedy, ""Insurrection"" is the first TNG film to keep the humor APPROPRIATE; it's almost in-tune with Trek III (or maybe Trek VI) in terms of keeping things serious with the occasional smooth-flowing joke.  I've said before that ""First Contact""'s excessive use of (often forced) humor makes it a farce.  Many jokes are contrived and not even remotely funny.  ""Insurrection"" gets the humor right, in tone, wit, and presentation.  All but one, but I will get to that momentarily.

Characterizations:  All in all, none of them is flawed.  The actors put in great performances and there is a sense of fun present.  But unlike ""First Contact"" it's apparent that the fun is meant for all of us.  Not just the actors involved.  There's a great villain in Ru'afo (F Murray Abraham) who also gets some great lines. I haven't felt this hyped about a strong villain since General Chang (Trek VI).

The plot:  Some in the Federation, who are weary of collapse due to losing a lot of recent battles with numerous enemies, want to revitalize and heal their own.  They team up with the So'na to extract a special radiation from a distant planet.  The inhabitants of this planet, the Ba'ku, would be adversely affacted by this change.  Of course, things get squirmy when it turns out that the Son'a and Ba'ku are the same race, but whoever said that sci-fi shouldn't involve two factions of the same race?  Meanwhile, Picard ends up in an unexpected love affair (that's refreshingly G-rated and pure in spirit, how could anyone NOT be drawn into the charm of it all?!) while Data marvels that Riker's shaved face.  Made shaven because kiss'n'tell Troi can't stand the beard.  (more well placed humor.)

Here are my problems with the plot:

1.  It is suggested that the entire upper eschelon of the Federation has turned bad.  I liked this.  But at the end?  Berman (long-time prodcuer and intellectually bankrupt) decides to say that it was, as usual, just one or two of the Feds that had gone bad.

2.  After analyzing the Son'a/Ba'ku subplot (what's up with the silly apostrophe marks anyway?), we should be feeling sorry for the Son'a, as they are the PARENTS of the Ba'ku, who had kicked them out.  Yipes.

3.  Picard summarily kills Ru'afo at the end.  I am tired of this macho Picard killing his own officers or killing baddies whenever it suits him routine.  Heck, even Kirk offered to save Khan at the end of Trek II.  But at least Kirk is a human and we can understand why he's had enough of Kruge or gets the last word against Chang.  Picard, for 7 TV seasons, is portrayed as being uber-moral this and life-that.  So now he's a mass killer in the big-screen movies.  Especially when his own crew saved his bacon in ""The Best of Both Worlds"", and 2 movies later he's gunning the lot of them down.  I have a big problem with this!  So did Ruby... whoops, I digressed again!

4.  There's a mini-musical of the HMS Pinaforte.  This is the one part of the movie that's utterly contrived.  Yes, it's funny  to see Worf shake his head in an attempt to not sing along, but... yuck.

5.  Worf seems to get his gortch (puberty joke) BEFORE arriving on the planet containing the special age-reversing technobabble radiation.  Now we all know Worf got jiggy in ""The Emmisary"" (Season 2 TNG) and 9 months later little Alexander came into trekdom so this gortch must be an effect from the radiation.

6.  Technobabble.  Bermantrek goes out of its way to create more and more technobabble (probably so Paramount can cash in on the patents should humankind create a device that fits Trek's description...)  And in this movie there's no exception.  We are an audience.  Not science majors at University.  While ""Insurrection"" usually keeps this in check, metaphasic this and hoobie-doobie that gets annoying after a while - but at least it's not the main focus of the story.  Then add in Data's ""morality circuits"" and it's amazing nobody broke out in laughter in the theatre.  That is so contrived.  If anyone is a fan of ""Red Dwarf"" by the way, Kryten (a send-up of MANY android-type characters and hardly a ripoff of bermantrek...) often talks of his ____ circuits.  Right down to a ""good taste chip"".  Except Trek tries to take the same goofy dialogue and make it serious.  No, Berman, please don't.  Data is a complexly programmed android.  Not a fancy Lego creation where removing one green brick can make a world of difference...

7.  There are but 600 Ba'ku.  SIX HUNDRED.  I know there's a great moral tale here (slavery, relocation, wiping out indiginous population, raping of their land, calling oil barons thugs; there are some GREAT lines in this movie that can't be beat), but for 600 people on one huge honkin' planet?!  Couldn't the Feds and Son'a merely open up a hotel/vac ation resort on one of the other continents and bother anybody?!  The idea is lovely, but the execution has a plot hole too big and too many.

The effects?  No contest.  Trek's first mass-use of CGI is exceptional.  I'm an old-school fan of model work, but the CGI in this movie was exceptionally well done.

Ditto for the sets and locale.  While I hate using the ""R-word"", this movie truly is rich in its use of location and architecture.  It accentuates the positive aspects of the story... but also reinforces the negative (the small population thing).

DVD quality?  Well, with each Trek release the quality gets better.  As the original release of Insurrection was horrid (making me hunt high and low for the LASERDISC version!), I'm hoping to see better here.  I very likely will.

The extras?  Well, I'll have to update this when the time comes.

All in all, this movie is grossly underrated.  It's got its faults (how many movies DON'T have problems?!  it's a matter of tolerating the mistakes), but those are made overblown by the movie's detractors (who'd rather see another Borg film with other bermantrek characters pop in and do a little dance) and other overhyped sequels are totally forgiven for far worse mistakes.",1117670400,,8722,4.7381745502998

I've also been buying all the ""Special Editions"" of the Star Trek movies, and this one is a bit disappointing. The two biggest are: 1.) ABSOLUTELY NO AUDIO COMMENTARY! Why, Why,Why?? Frakes did First Contact why not this one? It is his film. 2.) The menu is hard to use with the colours that indicate your movement.

That being said, if you are collecting like I am, buy it now. If you are expecting some insight from the director, skip it. Now the positives: 1.) Disk 2s extras have Deleted Scenes that will make you wish they put them back in the film for this DVD. 2.) Oluda's text commentary is always nice and sometimes funny. 3.) Star Trek's women short doc. was a nice bonus.

1016700,5,6305365121,"Dear M. IMRAN ""aka imranbecks,""

The last Star Trek Movie ""First Contact"" was not release in DTS 5.1 on the theaters.  Just like every other DVD that claims to be in DTS does not have the true DTS sound to them because they were not film with DTS sound, with a few exceptions of course.

The listing on Amazon.com only states Dolby while the last two Star Trek Movies states DTS 5.1.  ""Star Trek Insurrection"" was film in true DTS Surround Sound and I am just hoping that it is release this way.  That Amazon made a mistake but they probably didn't.

Please check this out and confirm if there is a DTS version of this movie.

When it comes to the movie I put it on the top with the few other movies that avoided the Star Wars style.  Star Trek is a science fiction dealing with idea and subjects to think about not to have the old one on one battle routine.  I know they fought back against the robots but that is not the same as killing other people and making it look as if this is the only answer to the problem.  War is sick and I am sick of war movies.  Please, they have now killed Star Trek because they turn ""Enterprise"" TV Series into a war story one episode after another and the last so called Star Trek Movie.

Star Trek has died because the people behind it could not see the beauty behind the previous Star Treks.  So, in my opinion ""Insurrection"" was the last Star Trek of any kind and is the reminder of the original concept of Star Trek.",1116201600,,1455,4.190647482014389
1016701,2,6305365121,"It's often been said that Star Trek producers and writers have the easiest and hardest jobs in the world simultaneously.  Different people tune in, pop in a disc, buy a ticket, or otherwise view Star Trek for different reasons. There's some that show up for nostalgia of the old Shatner/Nimoy series, the optimism of Gene Roddenberry's vision, maybe because they've lost some optimism over the years. Others want to be challenged with new ideas, new philosophies and viewpoints. And some, probably more than any of us would like to admit, watch to see weird aliens and ships blowing up. So, although the first group will generally be happy no matter what, it is very difficult to make a Star Trek movie to appeal to the latter two at the same time. The ones that do, though (Wrath of Khan, First Contact), are the ones that are the most memorable.

Insurrection tries to split the difference. Although the ideas of imperialism and ""might makes right"" are examined, they are often maddeningly relegated to the background for another action sequence. The result is a film that never gains a steady intellectual footing, but also never really develops a compelling-enough story to be more than a light show, but it is a fairly good light show.

That being said, the movie opens perfectly. Data seemingly goes crazy, exposes a ""duck-blind"" to study a primitive people, then engages in a dangerous outer-atmosphere tango with Captain Picard, which is an excellent scene in nearly every way. It is funny, in an absurd way, but also invigorating, and after seeing its brilliance, you figure that the movie might just live up to its predecessor. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a bright spot in a movie filled with scenes that hit the wrong chord. The subplot about Data discovering his inner-child doesn't really distinguish itself from Data's myriad attempts to understand humanity in the series (does anyone else remember his beard?). The Son'a don't make great villains-they're cold, vengeful bastards, but they don't seem to realize it, like Khan did, so they can't have fun with it. Rather than being villains you love-to-hate, a. k. a. the best kind, they're just villains you hate. Picard gives a speech so self-righteous, he starts to sound like Janeway. Okay, using a pure moral system, the removal can't be justified, but moving 600 people to improve the quality of life for billions? Come on, at least think about it. Picard's much-older love interest subplot does have some juice, but the scenes about slowing down time are preposterous, just another unnecessary element in a sea of gratuitousness. And the ultimate nadir is when Riker pilots the U.S.S. Enterprise-E, an enormous and sophisticated 24th century starship, with what appeared to be a Thrustmaster joystick, circa 1997. (Speaking of beards that should be remembered...)

Much has been said of the humor in this movie, and some of it does hit its mark, but Worf's ""aggressive tendencies"" line and Counselor Troi's ""boob"" line are groaners, and in series that have generally gotten by on tense action and drama, going for laughs is a sign that you've run out of material. Check out Superman III for proof of this.

I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on these guys-the movie is a lot better than Nemesis, if only because it isn't obsessed with gloom. Jonathan Frakes once again sits behind the director's chair, and he tries to make this hodgepodge work, but unlike before, the performances are surprisingly unnuanced. Where before he was able to expertly juggle planet-side and ship action, keeping both storylines interesting, he now struggles to keep the action engaging on either front, all the while the movie begins to feel like a cookie-cutter action project-which is NOT a good thing. This movie came out only two years after First Contact, so I think that there wasn't enough time to develop it. I hope so, anyway, because in spite of a few scenes, this one ranks just above The Motion Picture and Star Trek V on my list of quality. If you want entertainment in a Trek movie, you might enjoy this one (emphasize might). If you are looking for something more, don't bother.",1113523200,8,4147,4.8933143669985775
1016702,2,6305365121,"With the Star Trek film series at an apparent stand-still, it seems a good time to re-examine the various entries;  In particular, the ""odd-numbered curse"".  Star Trek: The Motion Picture holds up far better in its director's edition, and Star Trek III serves as a vital and emotional bridge in the original crew's saga.  Then things get complicated.  Shatner's The Final Frontier is an undisputed failure, but one with noble ideas and containing a number of nice character moments (i.e. Dr. McCoy's flashback), and Generations, while squandering a grand opportunity, is still fun viewing.  Which brings us to Star Trek: Insurrection, which is the only one beyond any redemption. And this is because it has no ambition whatsoever.  While the creative staff expressed a desire to craft a more light-hearted adventure, why do it with a story that seeks to create parallels with the forced exile of Native Americans?  The action pales in comparison to First Contact, and the laugh count is non-existent compared to The Voyage Home.  And both of those films managed to have a good deal of heart.  Heart has been a variable factor in Star Trek films, built largely upon the strength of a particular entry's guest stars.  First Contact had three knock-outs in the form of James Cromwell, Alfre Woodard, and Alice Krige.  Following up that, Insurrection boasts Donna Murphy, who is less engaged in the proceedings than Carrie Fisher in Return of the Jedi, F. Murray Abraham, who makes us yearn for Last Action Hero, and Anthony Zerbe, who would fare better if he donned sunglasses and a black robe.  All fine actors, all incapable of infusing energy into a script where nothing compelling exists.  I read a review that called this ""Star Trek: Save The Hippie Commune"".  Not far off.  So check this out for completeness sake, and try to find some moments to enjoy (Geordi watching the sunrise).  The good thing to be said here is that Insurrection inflicts no irreparable damage on the series or crew.  That would come with the following entry, that would violate the sanctity of even the even-numbered Treks.",1113436800,7,2101,4.923295454545454

Yes, sure, it is in the 24th century, and there's action, but mainly ""Star Trek"" is so popular because it gives us a safe vision of the future. That's why I don't understand people complaining about it being too sweet, because it isn't. It has a hopeful, positive ending, and is, in a way, the opposite of ""Nemesis""(which I, by the way, also liked).

Some basic ethnic questions were discussed in ""Insurrection"", the old philosophical part was back. None of the characters came too short.

The movie was overall well balanced, good story, great plotline, action, humor, romance, everything was incorporated. Nothing to complain about.

Maybe the joystick scene was a little exaggerated, but come on, it's science fiction! If you can beam people and create a warp core, why shouldn't you be able to fly a star ship with a joystick?

What the movie does NOT provide:

A senseless line of action scenes without real plot.

The humor wasn't wooden, I had several good laughs.

The dialogues weren't plump or sappy, I found them rather charming and intelligent.

The story wasn't boring, what was happening to the Ba'Ku homeworld became a question of moral and ethics, going back to the ""Star Trek"" philosophy.

Wrong characterization: I haven't noticed anyone acting out of character, although the Ba'Ku juvenile effects have them act a little younger(cute and hilarious), it addresses the whole midlife crisis thing. And Worf wasn't any weirder than usually, he was just being Worf.

Deanna and Will finally got together, how sweet! I don't think it was too sudden, but about time!

Picard finally had a love story.

Geordi was able to see for a while.

The use of music and imagery in the film was wonderful, beautiful landscape instead of grey star ship!

1016807,3,6305365121,"For STAR TREK: INSURRECTION (1998), unfortunately famous for Data saying the ultimate cheesy one-liner, ""Lock & Load"" (*cringe*), Jonathan ""Two-Takes"" Frakes, back in the director's chair, makes the atmosphere decidedly lighter. That's a good thing; however, after all is said and done in this, the ninth installment in the legendary STAR TREK film saga (and the third one featuring the ""Next Generation"" cast of characters), there is really not much meat on the bone. In this episode, which begins jarringly with a sudden murderous rampage by a malfunctioning android Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner, in not one of his finer moments as an actor here), the crew of the Enterprise ""E"" have beamed down to Planet Ba'ku and rather quickly become familiar with the peaceful residents of this planet. This planet is nicknamed ""Paradise,"" correctly so because it has magical regenerative powers which prevent its people from aging and dying. These people, numbering only 600, are peaceful and seem to have a kind of neo-religious quality to their personalities, as they live in total harmony with nature and openly reject any kind of technology. (This leads to what is probably the best scene in the entire movie, as the Enterprise is revealed to be camouflaged to blend in with the lush surroundings!)
Anyway, as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (the always-wonderful Patrick Stewart) begins to get friendly with one of the eligible female Ba'ku residents, and Commander Will Riker (Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) get friendlier with each other (leading to a surprisingly sensual hot-tub scene), there is trouble brewing in Paradise: an incredibly ugly band of aliens known as the So'na, led by the especially monstrous Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), who intends to displace the peace-loving Ba'ku residents and take over the planet for themselves, so as to de-uglify themselves (I'm not making this up). Not only that, but they are given full authority to do so by a suspicious Federation admiral (Anthony Zerbe, in his final film role). Because this order clearly violates the Prime Directive (which forbids the interfering of any sovereign planetary civilization), this puts Capt. Picard & crew into a conundrum: do they follow orders like good little Starfleet soldiers or do they uphold the Prime Directive to protect these peacemongers? Put it to you this way: Based on the title alone, plus what you know about the Next Generation characters, what do you THINK they will do??? Duh...Lock & Load!!!
Jonathan Frakes had an obviously daunting task: following up the incredible STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT (1996), one of the very best in the entire STAR TREK film saga. STAR TREK: INSURRECTION looks really nice (the visuals are, once again, truly amazing), but alas, there is not really much to care about here. F. Murray Abraham is one of the finest actors of our time, but he must have really needed the money in order to agree to fill a role in which he's not only unrecognizable, but also the recipient of the worst movie makeover in recent big-screen history. STAR TREK: INSURRECTION is certainly not the worst STAR TREK film ever made (that honor would unquestioningly go to the William Shatner-directed misfire STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER), but it's definitely not among the best. See it if you're a fan.
MODERATELY RECOMMENDED; AGES 10 & UP",1086134400,3,3354,5.066907775768535
1016808,4,6305365121,"The rule of odds and evens continues to apply in Star Trek Insurrection.  Being the second true Next Generation film it is a must-see for fans.
The film opens with scenes on a tranquil, agricultural planet.  Then things heat up as we run into Data and some Federation personnel.  It seems they are observing the tranquil society in what is called Operation Duck Blind (the inhabitants don't know they are being looked at).  From there we run into the rest of the main cast and the plot begins to develop.  It involves a malfunction Data experiences while assisting at Operation Duck Blind that results in the mission being compromised.
As the crew of the Enterprise investigate what went wrong with Data they begin to raise more and more questions.  As the main plot is revealed the crew must band together and stand up for what they feel is right.  In the end the crew triumphs (did we really think it would be otherwise?).
This is really not a film for people who are not already fans of the show as it is the way the characters act and their personal interactions that makes the film so entertaining.  Brent Spiner, Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis seem to have a tremendously fun time with this film.  Fans are treated to some great scenes of their favorite characters (although Gates McFadden was not particularly important).  We even learn some more about Data's design and operation.  But do not be misled by the title and the trailer, the scenes are all there but in the trailer they tell a much different story.
There are a few technical problems in the movie but you don't really think about them until afterwards.  These include small things like not being able to count (claiming two slave races and showing three), the Federation is pretty stupid (giving membership to a race that has just managed warpdrive but only has been around for less than a hundred years, has only six members and seems to have better ships).  There is the inevitable total ignorance of nebulae and what they are and just how not dense they are.  But these are all minor things that don't jump out as the movie progresses.
So if you are a Next Generation fan and want to see the crew back together in a story that is really just a long, but very good, episode, then you really should take the opportunity to see this one.  On a final note it passes Lynch's Law for a successful Next Generation episode in that it does not rely on techno-babble to drive or advance the plot but uses situation, character and emotion for fuel instead.",1085702400,,2521,4.583518930957684
1016854,5,6305365121,"While this movie does not have the cinematic gravitas of ST VIII First Contact or ST VI The Undiscovered Country it is still a really good time. I thoroughly enjoy watching this movie on my home entertainment center because it is just like a really upscale two part episode from TNG's glory days. Many people complain about the ""warm fuzzy feeling"" the movie has but it was not too sweet for my taste and maybe not for yours either.",1081555200,,432,4.481012658227848
1016855,4,6305365121,"Curse, what curse?  Almost as good as First Contact!
A number of movie reviewers in the past have talked about a curse on the even numbered Star Trek movies, I think this all started with Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, but this movie breaks that curse!
The storyline concerns a race of peaceful people, the Baku, on a planet capable of rejuvenating life and keeping it's inhabitants eternally youthful, but a group of  Federation officers want to remove them from their planet ""for the greater good of millions who would benefit from Baku's fountain of youth-like powers""  However, the Federation has a Prime Directive,  forbidding  the Federation from becoming involved with the planet's inhabitants and when Picard is ordered by a representative, Admiral Dougherty, to allow the removal of these people, effectively breaking the Prime Directive, Picard and crew rebel against this order and take matters into their own hands to help the citizens of the planet . As well, there is Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), who presents a threat to the Baku and the crew of the Enterprise-E..
 The Special effects, as in the last movie, are outstanding.  The action scenes are plentiful and the film's ""embarrassing sequences"" often referred to in other movie reviews I've read are actually very humorous, especially Deanna Troi's remark about Dr. Crusher's ""boobs"" firming up nicely and Worf`s Klingon ""puberty"".  It was a little annoying that the relationship between Anij (Donna Murphy) and Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart) didn't go as far it could have, especially in light of the romances Capt. Kirk had on the original Star Trek series.  As well, the friendship that developed between the boy and Data was cute, serving it's purpose in eliminating the boy's fear of androids, after Data goes haywire in the beginning of the movie.  It was good to see Commander Riker without his beard for once ( he shaves it off for Deanna early on), as he's had it since the 1988-89 season of Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The picture and sound quality of this DVD is excellent.
Extras -- The DVD has two trailers and a five minute behind the scenes look at the movie,  but nothing much else, still it's a pleasant little timewaster.

In the end, I enjoyed Star Trek: Insurrection, and unlike what some other movie reviewers have noted, it seemed very theatrical doesn't play like a TV Movie at all.  In fact, I would have to say that there was as much action in this movie as there was in First Contact.  In conclusion, it's as good as First Contact,  highly recommended to all Star Trek fans.
This review refers to the Widescreen DVD, which is enhanced for 16 x 9 viewing.
To everyone who reads this,  remember to keep in mind that this is only my opinion, don't take it to heart.  In the final equation all that really matters is what YOU thought of the movie!  If you enjoyed it, that's all that matters!",1081382400,,2889,4.765060240963855
1016856,5,6305365121,"I have to say that this film would probably only appeal to the more intense Star Trek fans.  I myself think it was great! Lots of humor, great acting, awesome special effects, everything that we've come to expect in Star Trek movies.  However, the story was more of a classic Star Trek story, almost like something you'd see in a tv episode, which I don't think would appeal to many fans, but again it is most definetly a great Star Trek movie.",1071792000,,444,4.402439024390244
1016857,4,6305365121,"Ok, from what I have heard, the main gripe about this film, is that it could have been a TV episode.  But when it comes to being a film, I think that this movie hits it right on the mark.
The humor in it adds some bubbly fun to a film that could have been all syrup and saddness.  And unlike some sci-fi films, the humor isn't contrived and it actually makes sense.  Who doesn't get a kick out of Worf's wart or Data's ability to be a flotation device?
Another thing that made this Star Trek film great, was that it didn't center on Captain Picard, like many of the other films (and TV episodes) have a tendency to do.  You get to hear about how other people are reacting to and experiencing this latest adventure.  Yes, this film does give Patrick Stewart an ample amount of screen time, but it also allows the viewers to enjoy little quirks about the rest of the characters we have grown to love over the years.
Complaints about plot holes and such I think are reading too much into the film.  This is sci-fi, ok?  Give the writers, directors, and producers a little leg room!
Overall, I believe this to be an excellent addition to the Star Trek family of movies.  A little bit of fun, adventure, intensity, and the well placed moral at the end.  So grab some popcorn, a pillow, and your phaser shaped remote control, as Insurrection takes you boldly into a different style for this crew, and has a bunch of fun doing it.",1066521600,9,1423,4.319548872180451
1016858,3,6305365121,"Please note: This review is for the Special Edition of ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" released 6/7/05 and was updated.

Most of these reviews of Insurrection damn the film with faint praise. It wasn't this, it wasn't that. The Federation wouldn't do this. There's petty squabbles about legal points, etc. Writer Michael Piller clearly uses Star Trek Insurrection, much as Roddenberry did, as a soapbox to decry the injustices visited upon others. Usually he'd use Star Trek as a analogy of what had occurred in the past or present.

The next to last installment in the ""Trek"" film franchise, ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" received a bad rap from the very beginning. Despite the fact that it was scripted by one of the series best writers (Michael Piller a producer and writer on ""The Dead Zone"") and directed by series vet/actor Jonathan Frakes the film was seen as disappointing as a follow up to the action driven ""Star Trek: First Contact"". While the film certainly lacks the intensity of ""First Contact"", the humor and thoughtfulness that drove some of the best episodes of the TV series remain remarkably intact. ""Insurrection"" certainly is much, much closer to an expanded bigger budget TV episode but it is by no means a bad ""Trek"" film.

Data (Brent Spiner) while on a covert mission to gather information on an alien race called the Ba'ku malfunctions and exposes the mission to the natives. It seems that the radiation belt that surrounds the planet is a fountain of youth reversing aging for those that live there. The Federation in collaboration with a race called the Son'a plan on relocating the Ba'ku so that the Federation can ""harvest"" the radiation belt and use it to cure people of illnesses. The leader of the Son'a Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) demands that Vice-Admiral Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) contact the Enterprise and find out how to deactivate or destroy the android. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) elects to take the Enterprise there to the Ba'ku's planet and try deactivating Data while keeping him intact. He discovers a conspiracy among the Federation and the Son'a that he would never suspect.

While it appears this is the same digital transfer as the first DVD issue, there's considerably better detail and crisper images as the result of improvements made since that first disc appeared. The deep, rich blacks and bright vivid colors of the planet come to life on this DVD. The wonderfully rich 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround and DTS mixes both sound terrific using the surrounding speakers exceedingly well. The DTS mix has the edge here with a deeper, richer bass and better overall presence but the two are exceptionally close in quality otherwise.

Disc one is devoted to the film and text commentary. Disc two has all the extras on it. There's a number of deleted scenes including, most importantly, an alternate ending not previous seen. The alternate ending is actually fascinating although it might have been a bit confusing for some folks. Evidently Ru'afo's exposure to the metaphasic radiation turns him younger and younger. Sadly, the optical effects aren't in the alternate ending beyond some simple computer graphics. We also have Peter Lauritson introducing the deleted scenes and giving us background on why they didn't make it into the movie including an extended version of Ru'afo's facelift. Image quality for the deleted scenes aren't quite as good as the movie because they weren't color corrected and/or completed. We get more scenes of Riker and Troi flirting which are quite funny and actually would have worked within the film quite well as part of a ""director's edition"". There's also a scene where Picard kisses Anij that was cut.

""The Star Trek Universe"" focuses on the aliens created by make up artist Michael Westmore and the beautiful alien women throughout the run of the entire series and films.  Jonathan Frakes comments on his favorite alien women that Riker has seduced.

""Production"" looks at everything from the creation of the Ba'ku village in Thousand Oaks, California to the creation of one of the most elaborate stunts that wasn't SEEN in the movie. We get to see Data save some of the Ba'ku fighting three aliens who are armed taking all three out with one punch. ""Creating the Illusion"" shows us how the visual effects were created for three sequences; the shuttle chase involving Data, Picard and Worf; when the drones attack trying to transport the Ba'ku and the sequence involving the Duck Blind at the beginning when Data reveals there are Federation personnel invisible among the Ba'ku in their village. Each one is introduced by co-producer/ 2nd unit director Peter Lauritson. We also see the storyboards for the sequence and what the visuals look like at various stages of production.

""The Story"" features Michael Piller discussing their take on the screenplay. Piller relates the story to the obsessive culture of youth we live in and relates a personal experience that inspired the story. He discusses the metaphorical nature of the story but also the real world issues that underlie the story and that could be applied to the 21st century. We also get footage from the original featurette and interviews from around the same time incorporated into a new featurettte on the making of the movie. There's also a section on the advertising featuring the teaser trailer, theatrical trailer, the original promotional featurette that appeared on the previous DVD and the Borg Invasion Trailer for the Las Vegas attraction. There's an archieve section with Storyboards and a photo gallery.

""Director's Notebook"" consists of video footage shot behind the scenes of Frakes shooting the film. Featuring a new interview with Frakes discussing the approach to the story which he felt wasn't quite as strong as ""First Contact"". He felt that the look of the movie was a highlight of the film. He also discusses the difficulty in balancing the story so that both old Trek fans can enjoy it but also so that new Trek fans won't feel excluded. It's tremendously difficult with a franchise with so much backstory as the franchise has. He also discusses the challenges of acting in a film he's directing.
Oh, and keep your eye out for Easter eggs on the second disc. There's one that shows the craft services food and Marina Sirtis discussing how difficult it is for the actors to remain so slim. It's a bit tongue-in-cheek but also interesting. Look for some of the little logos to the left and right of the area where the menu is and click on them to access the Easter eggs.

Surprisingly Jonathan Frakes either wasn't asked or elected not to do a commentary track for this film. It's a pity because Frakes' entertaining commentary track for ""First Contact"" was a highlight of that disc. He knows when to say something informative and when to stay quiet letting the film do the talking. Many directors could take lessons from Frakes in terms of doing a commentary track.

There is an extensive text commentary by Michael and Denise Okuda that's both informative with trivia about everything from Gilbert and Sullivan, to set redresses from the ""Voyager"" TV show and ""First Contact"" movie. There's also humor which has been a hallmark of all the text commentary tracks that the Okudas have done. There's also plenty of trivia about various episodes and how they relate to the film. Of course, there's also some useless information that is there just to be there but, on the whole, the Okudas continue to be a fount of useful ""Trek"" information.

""Insurrection"" certainly deserved the deluxe treatment that ""First Contact"", ""Generations"" and ""Nemesis"" received in their DVD incarnations. Hopefully ""Nemesis"" (one of the most polarizing of ""Trek"" releases) will also be expanded to a two disc edition but incorporate the best features of the previous version. While not the best of the ""Trek"" films, ""Insurrection"" is a good, solid adventure that has lots of humor and fun throughout the film. The visual effects are, as usual, spectacular and this is our first glimpse of a completely computer generated Enterprise in a film. A top notch release from Paramount, I'd be curious to see how Paramount could possibly improve this edition when they release the High Definition version of this film on disc.",1063584000,124,8260,4.976811594202899
1016859,5,6305365121,"I was really pleasantly surprised when I saw Star Trek developing into a higher level of story lines and incorporating new age ideals. This movie is one that has a few levels - if you're looking for an amazing story  - the story is one that you have seen or read in the past - but what have they said:
"" There are only 12 story lines anyway"" and they keep getting redone. But there is another subtler level of energy work here that I really enjoyed. The REAL story line, in my opinion here, was the quest for the perfect moment as opposed to the conquest of the universe. Isn't that what was really discussed? Now I don't think that it was done very deeply because it might have been lost on many - but I'm one who enjoys the SF jenre along with the fantasy part of it.
You'll enjoy this for the newness of it if you let yourself - and it will get you thinking long after you watch it - again if you allow youself!",1062979200,3,914,4.0777777777777775
1016860,4,6305365121,"Somtimes it feels that the franchise is getting tired. I first detected this with First Contact, although it was fun watching it, but with this film I don't know what they are trying to do. It is a wonderful story about one of man's greatest dreams where the legendary crew of the Enterprise fit beautifully. I think this is thanks to one of the greatest story supervisors Star Trek has ever had: Michael Piller. But then you can feel the touch of Rick Berman where I am sure he suggested and finally decided the movie needed a villan and a voilent ending. The part where Murray's character goes insane and kills admiral Dougherty totally spoils the picture. I always thought that Star Trek wasn't about a bad guy but about humanity's potencial to resolve any problem sensibly. Insurrection gives a very bad name to Star Trek for fans and non-fans, and of course with Nemesis it is impossible to do any worse.",1062892800,,909,4.617283950617284
1016861,4,6305365121,"""Insurrection"" is underrated.  Some folks have impugned the movie because, despite a title like ""Insurrection,"" it wasn't dripping with political intrigue like the latter days of the DS9 show.  Thank God it's nothing so boring as that.  Despite a few moments of manufactured cheese (Picard's love interest), and some dramatic overacting by F. Murray Abraham as the villain, the movie is excellent, entertaining, and above all, the funniest TNG movie.
WHY YOU'LL LIKE IT: The story is entertaining and even contains a surprise twist subplot.  Like ""First Contact,"" a portion of the story revolves around relatively mundane events on a planetary setting, but there is no shortage of spacefaring action, including a visually stunning nebular battle sequence that should make ""Wrath of Khan"" fanatics jealous.  Everyone from the core cast gets their screentime, but it's Data, Riker and Worf who are laugh-out-loud funny as they supply the most hilarious Trek movie dialogue since ""The Voyage Home.""  If it weren't for ""First Contact,"" this would be the best TNG movie hands-down.
WHY YOU WON'T: Some folks mentioned that the plot is a little thin, and they're not entirely wrong.  ""Save the Space Amish"" isn't a great title, but that would more accurately describe the gist of the movie than ""Insurrection"" does.  F. Murray Abraham, as the movie's more-disgusting-than-creepy villain, isn't much of a presence.  The movie makes some social commentary about the ""forced relocation of indigenous populations"" (a la Native Americans) that gets old pretty quickly, but it's never lingered over very long so you only have to tune it out for a moment or so every now and again.  Picard's afore-mentioned love interest and Data's child pal get pretty old pretty fast -- don't hope they die, you'll only be disappointed.",1061164800,2,1809,5.185567010309279
1016862,4,6305365121,"I am rather surprised to see the negative reviews this film has gotten here. I thought this movie was excellent, and would rank in the upper echelon of Star Trek features.
What is nice about this film is the character development aspects. One of my favorite parts of Star Trek is getting to know the crew members, and my favorite episodes of both TOS and TNG are the ones in which you learn a little more about your favorite characters, not the ones that are action oriented.
In this film, that is essentially what we get. We get to see a relaxed, very human Picard (versus the Captain Ahab madman Picard in First Contact), the friendship between the child and Commander Data, and the (finally) rekindling of Riker and Troi's romance.
There is also plenty of action to satisfy that component. The scenes which the crew must shoot down the probes that are chasing the settlers are very cool and quite exciting, and the space battle (with the ""Riker Manuever"") is also great. Granted, not as intense as the Borg battles in FC but this is an alltogether different deal.
There is a review that mentions a disagreement with the idea of moving 300 settlers. Firstly, I really don't take much account into a particular movie's politics, so I geuss that didn't bother me. However, I believe the movie was successful in pointing out that however beneficial the effects of the planet may be, they (the Admiral and his conspirators) were going about it in an entirely illegal fashion, so I had no problem with the feasability of that part of the story.
At any rate, fans ought to understand that the Next Generation movies have actually been done at a higher level of consistancy than the original series cast movies. Generations is the weaker of the four, but even that one isn't as bad as the putrid ST V, and the next three are all very, very well done. I sincerely hope that Paramount doesn't give up on this wonderful cast.",1059177600,,1917,4.608187134502924
1016893,2,6305365121,"MY REVIEW.  Star Trek movie rank 7th of 10.  OK.  We know that Patrick Stewart is a big time liberal over there in the land of English socialism.  Rodenberry was a conservative libertarian.  Hey there is room for everyone in the world, even in the world of Star Trek.  But this time they raised eyebrows.  Let me Explain.
Before we know that the bad guys are bad guys here is what happens.  A solar system has the secret to eliminate death, disease and suffering.  But tests must be run and to do that a small group of settlers must be moved.  Settlers mind you, not the ""forever, indigenous residents"" of the planet.  Picard goes nuts and takes up arms to support the settlers against the orders of a superior officer and against the approval of star fleet.  Only after starting a court martial offense, to prevent to discovery of the cure for aging and disease does Picard learn that the Star fleet admiral has been duped and that the experimenters are bad guys with ulterior motives.  New age idealism is one thing.  But here Picard weighed the conflicting ideas of settlers keeping their homes vs the permanent end to aging and disease and went with the settlers?!  Huh?  Isn't that like defending a settler farmer who wants to ploy up a field where the cure for cancer is growing before tests can be run to see why the current plant cures cancer?
Once you get past the idea our heroes are defending an absurdity, the rest of the movie is well. Done.  The scenery in this film is spectacular.  The special effects are impressive.  It just that the main premise for the story is stupid.",1056672000,5,1589,4.512280701754386

1016896,3,6305365121,"Jonathan Frakes returned to the director's chair to helm this ninth installment in the Star Trem motion picture series and third with the Next Generation crew.  Captain Picard and crew travel to a shangri-la like planet whose inhabitants haven't aged in over 300 years and uncover a conspiracy lying within the Federation to take over the planet and re-locate it's inhabitants.  The lighthearted plot is pretty routine and basic for a Trek film, although Insurrection tries to retain some of the original Trek's merits, and the film has a few comedic moments (such as Picard and Worf dueting a rendition of the HMS Pinafore to distract a seemingly malfunctioning Data) and is pretty amusing all in all.  F.Murray Abraham hams it up under some great makeup as the villianous Ru'afo, and although Insurrection isn't the worst film in the series, it feels like a two part big budget episode of The Next Generation.  Since it's release Insurrection has gotten a lot of bashing from Trekkies, and while I can see some of their points, Insurrection is still worth watching.",1053216000,3,1067,4.944134078212291

(Everyone who watched it, probably, except you had to really pay attention.)  This selection is a refreshingly ""freed"" and less stoic group of characters who are less worried about making a mistake and more worried about doing the right thing against the odds.
It's a good story, a wonderful showcase for the characters, including a wonderful flirtatious affair for the Captain, and a moral victory.  We get to root for the good guys and watch the bad guys either see the error of their ways or get incinerated.
Good fun overall.  You'll want to watch it more than once and keep it handy for when every show on TV is ""reality.""  Given the choice, I'll opt for Star Trek every time.",1047945600,4,793,4.635714285714286

I want Star Trek to be worth watching, but there hasn't been really good Trek since TNG 4th season.  That is where it started to go down.  In this movie, we are treated to cheesy character, shallow plot, really bad effects, slow music, and ""bad"" humor.  If the humor was really funny, like Voyage Home, it might have been better.  Unfortunately, the characters created in the TNG series died at the end of that series.  They have never been the same in the movies.  They didn't develop into the people they are now. They just became these people.  I don't like them.  I hope Nemesis will improve, at the very least, the story telling.

It has character instead of the usual pomp and circumstance (which I like as well). But, something was different here, there is a real cause, it provokes a real longing to see the right thing done. The acting was simply phenomenal. This is not your run of the mill sci-fi - simply much more. If you are just interested in visual effects - get a life and watch something boring. This one is way above the baseline. The movie doesn't rely simply on the techno skill of the special effects crew - it relies on the actors as well and the cause - a wonderful movie with a real heart. The people on this planet represent what we all might like to have - a real life of satisfaction away from the pressures and demands that drive us into the grave 20 years before our time - something worth fighting for.",1033948800,26,956,4.316666666666666
1016900,2,6305365121,"This is a flat entry in the highly successful film series. Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-E go to a mystical planet to save the inhabitants, who are kind of like space hippies. F. Murray Abraham is our over-the-top villain, Ru'afo, but is about on-par with the laughable (but better) Kruge or Sybok. And is it just me, or are nine out of ten Starfleet Admirals conniving, scheming lunatics? Admiral Dougherty is definitely one of them. I think what this film has going for it are the exciting climax and the neat-o space battle with Riker commanding the Enterprise against the Son'a. But this movie seems confused; it wants to be either a comedy, an action, or a love story, but doesn't succeed in either. Jonathan Frakes is a fine director and he gives this film a very fun look. It is the script that feels old and used, like it was thrown around the Paramount lot a little too much. Scenes with Worf and Data that are intended to be humorous fall flat on their faces. The scenes between Riker and Troi are cute and playful, but barely produce a subplot. Dr. Crusher and Geordi LaForge are pushed way in the background; there is a scene where Geordi at last has the gift of sight that is over before you know it and mentioned briefly, but never developed on. Here is a character that has been blind all his life now having the chance to see with his own eyes, and the screenplay pushes it into the far background. The scene between Picard and Dougherty work as well as the final fistfight between Ru'afo and the Captain, but the scenes between Picard and the Ba'ku leader, Anij, are just sci-fi blunders in an attempt to make a love story.

The prior reviews pretty much prove I am right.  Any objective analysis of this film leads to the inescapable conclusion that it is awful.  The plot is weak, the characters more clowns than heroes, and the script preachy and unrealistic, even by ST standards. It is a shame to see such a great actor as Patrick Stewart acting like a feminized buffon, but that is essentially how Captain Picard behaves in this piece of tripe.  Worf stumbles through his scenes more confused than anything, and the old ""Data goes nuts"" theme has been used so much it reeks of decay.  The piece with Troi and Riker in the tub together might have been nice 10 years ago when they were in their prime.  By the time this film was done, though, it reminded me of the scene from ""Friends"" where the gang sees their neighbor,Ugly Naked Guy, being intimate with his equally ugly girlfriend.  Middle age paunches and wrinkles do not a sultry scene make.  It is almost unbelievable that this film followed ""First Contact,"" which by my estimation was the best ST film ever.

What gets me is people complaining about too strong of a humorous element. Star Trek has always held some humor in it. From Bones and Spock arguing, to Data's misunderstandings, Quark in general, the Doctor and Neelix, humor has always been a strong element. Besides, this isn't even the funniest movie in the series. Everybody remember The Voyage Home? Kirk and Spock trying to get around in 1985, along with Chekov just being Chekov, made #4 a lot funnier.
There are some holes in the plot, but not as many as you'd think. Like, why was Data on that planet in the first place? And what was so special that Worf took a vacation and happened to on board. Besides a few others, this movie was very good, albeit not quite as good as First Contact.

1016975,3,6305365121,"I have been a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation for many years, and I always get a fuzzy, excited feeling when they release a film from this series.  Since I missed it at the theatre with much regret, I put a VHS copy of ""Insurrection"" into my VCR.  By the end of the film, I must admit that I was thoroughly disappointed.
I think that while Jonathan Frakes did an excellent job bringing some characters out of their shells in ""First Contact,"" he (and the writers) focus way too much on humor and not enough on character development and plot.  Some of the lines and gags are bordering on ridiculous.
Speaking of plot, this one was silly and pretty pointless.  A race that cannot age?  A conspiracy within the Federation?  Okay, sure.  I know it's difficult after almost fifteen years to come up with original ideas, but put your heads together guys and bring us something with more depth, more action, and more emotion so we don't get bored.  ""First Contact"" was so good because it got dark and gritty, two qualities we rarely see in anything Star Trek.
So why three stars, you ask?  Well, because it's TNG.  I love the cast and I still think they are fine actors.  The special effects are always awesome.  And while it's not a great film in and of itself, it fulfills the job of at least continuing the series.
Another reason I'm not completely bashing it is because of one scene.  Lt. Cmdr. Geordi La Forge, like many crew members, starts to experience the ""fountain of youth"" effects from the planet's atmosphere.  His blindness begins to fade and he is seeing the sky for the first time in his life.  This is one of the most defining emotional moments in the entire Trek series.  As he describes everything, the most die-hard Trek fan might be compelled to tear up.  Great stuff.
Overall, it's not terrible, but it's not very good either.  But fear not, fans.  ""Nemesis"" looks to be the most promising venture of the TNG crew.  Looks even spookier than ""First Contact.""  Here's hoping, right?",1027728000,,2000,4.546218487394958

Patrick Stewart and everybody else involved said from the beginning that ""Insurrection"" wasn't going to be another ""First Contact.""  They wanted to create a movie that had a lot of heart in it with a smaller amount of the action and they did that.

Why?
Because I love the entire Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) series, and it would be nearly impossible for them to make a TNG movie that I did not like.
That being said, Star Trek: Insurrection is not for people who are not familiar with the TNG crew. This movie is filled with many references to the past which require, at the very least, some knowledge of the history of the characters. Even then, however, to fully enjoy this movie you must have an appreciation for all the characters and their history. Without it, most of the jokes in the movie fall flat.
For most TNG fans, this movie will be appreciated for the character development more than for the action. It does follow the pattern of the odd number Star Trek movies (this is the 9th one) not being as good or strong as the even numbered ones, but is still exteremly enjoyable.

In contrast, Insurrection IS NOT the best of the movies, or one of the best.  It is not the worst of the other 8 either; I've held that spot solely for Generations.  And if there is one thing it is definitely not, it is not the parallel of The Search for Spock.
The DVD, on the other hand, plays on the visual effects and score by making look and sound more stunning.  Bonus trailers and featurettes on one DVD make it a great keeper.  However, it will never rival the Motion Picture, or First Contact.
Bottom line - Buy it for the DVD.  Just to say you own all of 'em.",1021075200,,841,4.148148148148148
1016980,3,6305365121,"Insurrection is the ninth in the seemingly endless series of Star Trek motion pictures. Only the James Bond series has run longer and produced more movies. These stories of space exploration have proved to be a gold mine for Paramount Studios, but if this entry is any indication, the gold may get scarcer and scarcer.
Technically, Star Fleet still glistens. If anything, CG driven special effects have made the space ships and the planets they visit more dazzling. These new technologies allow such visuals to be sharper and more detailed. Insurrection gets very high marks for its production values.
Unlike the now holy Star Wars series, Star Trek's key to success has never been in its visuals. With its origins in television, where the cost per hour filmed much be much lower than it is in movies, Star Trek's following is mostly story-driven. The continuing emphasis on cooperation between intelligent beings from very different cultures is lifted directly from our own human experience. The degree of success for each Star Trek episode, whether it be for TV or for theatrical release, depends on the quality of its story.
Insurrection is not one of the stronger tales, and this is why it is rather lightweight and tepid compared to earlier movies. At the beginning, the usually delightful Lt. Commander Data [Brent Spinner] seems to have had an android's version of a nervous breakdown. While on a mission to study the inhabitants on a remote planet, he attacks the Federation leaders of the mission. His friend, Captain Picard [Patrick Stewart] barely manages to save him from destruction. We later learn the reason. The planet has just six hundred people living on it. They are kept eternally young by some ray produced by the planet's atmosphere. The Federation, hoping to appease an ally and to benefit from this Fountain of Youth effect, has agreed to secretly move the inhabitants to another planet. Data has determined that moving these gentle souls will result in their destruction, and it is up to Captain Picard to decided whether or not to do anything about the situation.
I suppose this is as interesting and fantastic on paper as other Star Trek premises, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The people who live on the planet are supposed to be seen as peaceful and loving, but as portrayed, they are mainly bland and boring. There is also a bit of Hollywood's unintentional but ever present racism. These perfect people are, of course, blonde, blue-eyed and beautiful. While this is certainly no reason not to save them, it is hard to bond with them emotionally. The suspense isn't there, because we know what Picard's course of action will be. The Federation's role in the affair seems to be a complete turnaround from its attitude in previous movies. Finally, since the population is six hundred souls and since the planet appears to be very large, the reasons given for their not being able to share the place are lame. This makes the outcome predictable, which causes the movie to drag.
The cast does a fine job, but they should. Except for the F. Murray Abraham, who is great as the villain Ba'ku, they act in the present incarnation of Star Trek on television.
This is decent entertainment for the whole family. Just expect to be a little underwhelmed.",1016841600,3,3287,4.871428571428571

However, this will mean that Starfleet must force the Bak'u off the planet. Picard's only hope in both preserving the dignity of Starfleet, and preserving the peaceful Bak'u is none other than to rebel. Great feeling of home with the other TNG charaters, and Riker(Jonathon Frakes)& Troi(Marina Sirtis) renew their love for each other. What makes it even better is F.

1017028,4,6305365121,"Insurrection has had much negative reaction from many a fan, as well as a horde of loyalists who enjoy it for its character development. Insurrection is very much an entry into the Next Generation TV series genre of stories, seldom having the feel of a ""Big Screen"" sci fi action film, but more of the close-knit character-based stories you expected to see in the series. This works well as a contrast to the much more action-driven predecessor, ""First Contact,"" allowing you to see that the crew of the Enterprise are about much more than ""saving the world as we know it.""
Insurrection begins with one of the most beautiful opening sequences of any Star Trek story. The scenery, the music, all building the impression that this is truly a paradise (all while opening credits are rolling). It makes for quite a contrast to the opening credits for many of the other feature films, which typcially show elongated credit rolls over space shots, sometimes with a climactic conclusion (for example, the explosion of the Klingon moon in Star Trek VI). The contrast Insurrection then takes with the Federation Observation Post hints that all is not well in this picture-perfect, peaceful world. Certainly not all is what it seems. And Data's behavior quickly seems to confirm those suspicions.
Strong points throughout this movie are the characterizations of the Enterprise crew and their comfort in interacting with each other. There are many elements of humor in this story, but each seems in step with the characters and their comfort levels with each other. And many are almost ""flashbacks"" to the television series. Picard singing Gilbert & Sullivan to ""make contact"" with Data harkens back to the numerous episodes that depicted Data and Picard practicing plays aboard the Enterprise. And Worf's reluctance to sing is completely in character. As the crew begins to experience the effects of the solar system (growing younger, so to speak), we see Riker reverting to his previous, clean-shaven self and with a renewed interest in Troi. And the joke between Troi and Crusher about ""firming up"" is portrayed in a way that shows the comfort the two have with each other to discuss those matters (a comfort developed over their years of service together).
While the basic story is interesting enough, sadly it does not leave one wanting to watch this one multiple times. Once you know the ending, the movie then becomes a novelty, but not one you want to review and re-watch countless times. Or, if you do, you may want to just rewatch the first half.
There are several scenes in this film which merit criticism. One such scene is the ""freezing"" of a moment in time that occurs with Picard and his love interest. It comes out of nowhere, has little explanation, and serves no point. How is she able to do this? What is the point of this exercise? Yes, it forshadows something yet to come, but can we really believe that this particular action is even possible?
Regardless of the negative points inherent in this story, I am confident that if this were broadcast as part of the TV series as opposed to being a ""Big Screen"" theatrical release, it would have received more positive reviews than it did. If you enjoyed the Next Generation TV episodes (especially the latter years), you should enjoy this as a welcome addition to the series. If you are looking for an action-packed adventure where the Enterprise blows up or comes out looking like it warped through Hell, then this will probably not satisfy.",1008720000,2,3497,4.85929648241206

Because of ILM creating The Phantom Menace at the time, and the huge budget for location shooting, they had to go with a different effects company.  The effects look good, but they are far from Star Trek fan standards.  I give this movie credit of the fact that they did not reuse scenes from other Trek films...some of the best Trek films have saved money by rehashing old shots (ST2, ST4, ST5, Generations).  Insurrection, with its limited budget and alternate ending, did not reuse ANY shots.  The soundtrack is great and the holoship scenes are the best parts of the film.
It is an enjoyable film and gave the TNG crew a chance to have some fun, but it does not have an ending suitable to this crew.

1017032,3,6305365121,"""Star Trek: Insurrection"" is, in my opinion, the weakest in the long-running series of feature films based on Gene Roddenberry's ""Star Trek"" mythos. (For anyone who has lived in seclusion for the last 35 years, the ""Trek"" films and TV series chronicle science fiction adventures in a future of starships and deep space exploration.) In this installment, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew from the ""Next Generation"" TV series attempt to save the Baku, a pastoral people who inhabit a small colony, from sinister plans by a race known as the Sona.
There are a lot of good elements in ""Insurrection,"" but the film is severely hampered by a weak script, among other flaws. The plot is basically a collage of elements ""ripped off"" from past episodes of the ""Next Generation"" TV series (most notably, ""Homeward,"" a later episode guest-starring Paul Sorvino). The plot is also filled with too many weak contrivances and unexplained elements; it just doesn't make sense in retrospect.
The Sona and Baku are probably the two most poorly conceived alien races in the entire history of the ""Trek"" mythos. The Sona seem to primarily be a bunch of beauty parlor addicts (ooh! There's a frightening motivation!). The Baku, about whose fate we are supposed to care, come across as an arrogant bunch of technophobes who like to spout New Age-y platitudes.
A central element of ""Insurrection"" is a romantic attraction between Picard (played by Patrick Stewart, who also shares associate producer credit) and Anij (Donna Murphy), a Baku woman. But I find this attraction totally unconvincing. This relationship is quite a disappointment after seeing the dynamic chemistry between Stewart and Alfre Woodard in the previous ""Trek"" film (""Star Trek: First Contact"").
Despite the film's shortcomings, ""Insurrection"" does contain elements that make it worth seeing. There are some superb action sequences (most notably the opening sequence, which blends some great science fiction elements with more conventional hand-to-hand combat). The make-up designs of two minor races, the Sarlac and the Ellora, are quite striking (although underutilized by the camera). The ""Next Generation"" cast is as great as ever, and have wonderful chemistry in their scenes together. If you're a loyal ""Trek"" fan, give it a try.",1001808000,3,2288,5.220108695652174

A lightweight, inconsequential, New Age film which has the worst elements of LOST HORIZONS and THE SOUND OF MUSIC thrown in.

Ok, here's the plot : A few centuries ago , a band of interstellar hippies finds an uninhabited planet. They settle there, and over time, it becomes apparent that the planet possesses healing properties, which make the Baku essentially immortal and ever youthful. Others, inside and outside Starfleet, learn of this, and these people decide to remove the Baku unwittingly to an environment identical to that of ""their"" planet (the Baku are not native to this planet, remember?) but without the special properties. The planet the Baku are currently on would then be used as a giant hospital for the sick and suffering of the galaxy.

So there's the quandary : Should the Baku planet remain a private park for the 500-1000 or so interstellar hippies...or should it be used to cure the wounds and illnesses of uncounted sufferers throughout the universe, who cannot be helped by conventional means?

Naturally, Picard decides that the Baku should have the planet <i>alllllll </i> to themselves, and tough luck to the rest of the galaxy. (So much for,""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"") He decides to beam down to the surface to help the Baku ward off the intruders (the more recent intruders, I should say, as the Baku are NOT indigenous to the healing planet.) And equally naturally, when the rest of the crew learns of his plans, they paste dour, determined looks on their faces and beam down too.

I really, really hate this film, and I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who suggests this film as a feature for MST3K.

Discussing all the plot holes would be pointless, and I think those reading the negative reviews will garner that it's the smug selfrighteousness of the script and the characters which make this film so unbearable. So all just mention what I found the most annoying moment : When Picard's Baku squeeze, asked if she wouldn't like to see a bit more of the universe, says,""Where would hyperdrive take us except away from here?"" in the most smug , 'nah nah,  I got mine' voice imaginable.

1017107,2,6305365121,"This film is a rehash of the seventh film, STAR TREK GENERATIONS. In both films, an old guy is about to die, but he discovers a fountain of youth that will make him immortal. Picard is tempted by it, but rejects it. Since the acquisition of this fountain of youth would result in the death of a small number of people, he must be stopped. He is stopped, and Picard and his crew share a contemplative moment, then face the future with renewed vigor. Generations had a better score, however. (McCarthy better than Goldsmith? Yep.) Better villain, too.
Every time a character said, ""Ruafo,"" the name of the lead bad guy, I remembered the Lost Boys chanting, ""RU-FI-O! RU-FI-O!"" in HOOK, the Peter Pan sequel.
Riker indicated in this film that the Son'a (stretchy-faced bad guys) produced Ketracel White for the Dominion. Now, if you were watching DS9 at the time, you'd know that the Dominion was taking over all the major Alpha Quadrant species (humans, loud forehead-aliens, and pointy-eared invisible skulking aliens) one-by-one in an all-out war. White was absolutely vital to their war effort. Thus, the Son'a were indicted by Riker as incredibly important collaborators with the mortal enemy of the Federation. Everyone kind of let that slide, like if I had told you, ""It was supposed to rain last night, but didn't.""
Several months before the movie opened, I saw an alleged page of the script on the internet. I instantly knew it was a fake, because it had a stupid joke referring to the busts of the female leads. Turns out it wasn't a fake.",993945600,2,1546,4.75092936802974

The pacing and development of character relationships are nearly flawless.  It's a film with real depth, content, and integrity.

1017109,5,6305365121,"I went to see this one with a bunch of Star Wars fans (though their faith in the Force had just been shaken a little; they'd just seen _Episode 1: The Phantom Menace_).  I came out of the theatre with a bunch of Star Trek fans.
Perhaps the best aspect of this film was its brave decision to focus on a moral issue, and on character, rather than ""bigness"".
The film concerns genocide. But it chose not to use easy filmic ways of getting an audience ""involved"".  For example, the film could have shown victims being killed on-screen in horrible ways, or mutilated while vital fluids and key bodily organs are ripped out of their bodies.  That would work.  But instead the means of genocide was more subtle: destruction of an environment.
And where an audience might be bludgeoned into caring by being told that the issue involves a ""planet"", say, or ""the [fill in Trek name] system"", or - what the hell - the 17,000* worlds of the Klingon Empire, instead _Insurrection_ has its story about a group of just two or three hundred people. As Picard says, the issues are still the same.
I think, on skimming the negative reviews here, that where people were disappointed it was generally by the decision to keep this movie small and relatively intimate. Me, I thought it was a great decision.
I also felt that this was the best paced of the films since _VI: The Undiscovered Country_. _Generations_ is unfortunately a dull outing, and while long stretches of _First Contact_ are among the best Star Trek ever filmed (ie everything short on board the Enterprise) there were also long stretches where the film bogged down (ie more or less everything shot on 22nd century Earth).
_Insurrection_ by contrast keeps things moving forward throughout in an evenly paced linear story. The pauses for comedy and romance generally don't pause long enough to become mawkish or otherwise embarrassing.
A slight drawback for me was the excessive sweetness of the Ba'ku scenes. They looked like models in a brochure for a Californian Club Med - this is NOT a compliment - , and their New Age dialogue too often grated. The saving grace is that these moments were kept short. And though the score had its moments, being generally better in space than when describing pastoral paradises on the planet, it was not one of this series' best efforts. (An oddity of Star Trek is that the worst films, eg 1 and V, often have the best scores, while the best films eg VI and this one, have relatively undistinguished music.)
The romance between Picard and Anij is one of the best and most natural Trek romances. That's no praise at all, come to think of it, romance being something Trek is spectacularly bad at. I meant it is a believable and moderately appealing romance. (Shame on Paramount for cutting Picard's screen kiss, by the way. The moment where it was so obviously cut leaves us literally in the lurch. Still, no doubt their marketing people were coming back into control at a late stage in the editing; they figured teenage boys wouldn't have liked it.)
Anyway, in sum, this is one of the best Trek movies. It's one of the films I might show to a non-Trek fan, to show some of the series' charm. And although I liked _First Contact_ very much indeed, I actually preferred this film, overall. Recommended...
Cheers!

That said, ""Insurrection"" is easilly the worst film of any in the Star Trek series.  It is also a collosal disappointment next to the previous entry ""First Contact,"" the best of the Next Generation movies.  The biggest problem is that F. Murray Abraham is one of the wimpiest villians Trek has ever ever had.  Khan, for example, could have kicked his butt with one hand tied behind his back.  The second problem is that the plot itself is a snooze.  The Enterprise crew goes out on a limb to save a bunch of the dullest supporting characters they've ever run across.  But ultimately what does this film in is the lighthearted tone that drains all of the drama right out of it.  The ""Next Generation"" cast has always been far too earnest and serious-minded to be entertaining when they try to lighten up.

Basically an alien race working with the federation is trying to force the natives of the planet so they can collect the life giving force.

1017219,1,6305365121,"Star Trek: Insurrection, boy that sounds neat, doesn't it? That sounds like a continuation of that awesome first season episode, Conspiracy wherein these malevolent little creatures infest and begin to take over the  Federation. But alas that is not the case with the 9th installment of the  Star Trek movie franchise. Instead what we have here is plot by the evil  Son'a to boot the peace-loving Bak'u from their homeworld and take all of  the life-revitalizing radiation that is emitted by a system of rings that  orbit the planet. The Son'a are dying as a race with them resembling a  Jenny Craig skin peel. On the other hand this radiation that preserves  youth, also makes people erratic and do things not normally in their  nature. What this means is the crew of the Enterprise get to disobey the  orders of a Star Fleet admiral without actually being at fault.
 This  movie bothered me on a plethora of levels. First and foremost, it's dull!  We all know that change is bad and this is doubly so when it comes to Star  Trek, because they refuse to break from the formula that has worked in the  past. We all know that none of the main characters will die and we all know  that the Enterprise will never function properly, (In nine movies it has  never once worked right), and in this case the Federation flagship, the  Borg-killing ship-of-the-line, gets the snot pounded out of it by the third  rate alien species. Doesn't anyone have a problem with this? And as usual  we are treated to a third Next Generation movie that deals solely with  Captain Picard and Data. Unlike so many Trek fans, I happen to like most of  the other characters and feel that they simply are not getting the screen  time they deserve.
 The Son'a, while evil, for some reason want to  peacefully remove the Bak'u from their world by stuffing them all into a  holoship-basically a space faring holodeck of epic proportions and then  moving them to another world. Why these ships exist is quite beyond me.  Instead, the could have just bombed the single village from orbit then  moved in and taken over. Either that or, last time I checked, planets are  big, why couldn't the Son'a have lived on the other side of the planet,  away from the Bak'u? The Son'a are aided by an aging Starfleet admiral who  wants to enjoy the Bak'u's fountain of youth, forgetting of course that  people might notice the fact that the next time he shows up at an admiral's  meeting that he is twenty-five instead of sixty-five. This also ignores the  fact we know transporters can make people younger (Season 2, Unnatural  Selection), and we are treated to even more proof that the Star Trek  universe is not internally consistent.
 We get to watch Picard fall  in love, but not really, because that would mean changing the character. We  get to see Data do funny things and act weird, and we get to hear Worf  sing, which we really didn't need to. Riker shaves his beard and starts up  his relationship with Deanna again. And, as I said, the Federation flagship  gets hammered by Son'a, when it should have wiped the floor with them. This  film has very few moments, and those that are good happen between the main  cast, most of which are treated as secondary characters so Picard and Data  can hog the spotlight yet again.
 Why can't the powers that be at  Paramount simply make a Star Trek movie wherein the Feds send a fleet of  ships to go slaughter the Borg? Why? Because it's politically incorrect to  commit genocide...even if it's against a species that wouldn't think twice  about annihilating any other species. ""It would lower us to their level.""  they might say. Uh-huh, well, that's better than being made into a mindless  Borg drone. And no matter how dangerous the Borg (or any other race is)  they can't be wiped out, because that would mean change and change is bad.  This way they can keep recycling the same tired old story lines to an  audience that apparently are as apathetic as the writers. Why not a slug  fest between the Federation and the Romulans? Certainly the Star Trek  movies of late cannot be considered intelligent science fiction, because  all they do is reconstitute stories we have seen before.

There is a lot of ground combat, which is less  exciting, but Worf gets to fire this big plasma cannon, so it's kinda cool.

Where the film falls down is in  its attempt to be humorous. Some of the gags (like Worf's pimple) work,  others (the whole ""HMS Pinafore"" scene) don't. It all seems too  forced, too calculated, and though the Trek cast (particular Brent Spiner)  is commendably skilled at comedy, they can't pull it off.
And leave it to  Captain Picard to have a romance so ethereal, so intellectual, that nothing  happens. Wouldn't you think that Picard would pursue Anja a little more  passionately given that his last romp in the sack was about five years  before?
Overall, though, ""Insurrection"" is worthwhile and is  quite entertaining, forced humor or not. And the series goes on...",961372800,,1220,4.859223300970874

After the Trek movies ""Generations"" and ""First  Contact"", which were ok, but not quite up to earlier standards set by  Star Trek, ""Insurrection"" is a very pleasant surprise. Unlike the  other movies, which were fairly weak (mostly because of inadequate plot),  this movie proves that Star Trek is still going strong. The story in this  great movie warrant owning it, as you will most likely enjoy seeing it many  times.

It's not so much that this is a bad Star Trek  movie, but that I was hoping for a lot more. If they took this back to the  cutting room and remove 40 minutes they could make one of the all time best  TV shows. Instead, you have a movie which lies somewhere in the middle of  all Trek films.

1017360,4,6305365121,"I think Insurrection, along with First Contact and Star Trek VI, are the best in the series thus far. The worst were IV, V, and Generations. I loved the story and the acting in Insurrection; F. Murray Abraham did the best  job at playing a bad guy besides Christopher Lloyd in Star Trek III. Lloyd  played a Klingon in III, and I don't think that performance will ever be  topped; but, nonetheless I liked Abraham a lot. Data (Brent Spiner) had a  few absolutely wonderful scenes as well.  I've been a very, very loyal  fan to Star Trek over the years and have seen every original and TNG  episode made. That leads me to say that I do agree with other viewers in  saying that this one could have been done just as well as a TV episode, or  at least a two parter of the TNG series. The most disappointing aspect of  the whole movie is the space battle, which really isn't a space battle. It  would have been just as effective to report its happening off camera. All  of the action in the movie takes place on the planet, and there are some  very good, crisp action scenes there. Some of those shoot-outs were  classics, notably the two with the small flying drones. If you're a Trekker  this movie won't (shouldn't) disappoint you, even if you're looking for one  with a lot of action. In future movies, I would like to see more of a Star  Wars approach in reference to any space battles they may attempt (after  this one, they might not even attempt any more space battles, though).
  While very good, the whole thing isn't quite on the same grand, epic scale  as, say, II, VI, and First Contact. For epic good -vs- bad quality, those  were off the page, and the ones by which all Star Trek movies can be  judged.

1017364,4,6305365121,"Unlike other Star Trek fans, I rather enjoyed this latest entry in the series. The biggest problem with any new Trek motion picture is that people will have developed their own vision of what the film should be, even before they've seen it in the cinema. It's difficult to watch such a film  because a fan will always have an idea of how they think characters should  act, or which conventions shouldn't be violated (eg. killing off major  characters). On the other hand, watching an ST film with fans is an  experience to be cherished, because they understand all the humor and  action that plays out on the screen.
After the frenetic fast pace and  heavy action in the previous film (First Contact), it was refreshing to  watch a film that takes a slower pace. The cinemaphotography reflects this,  with some beautiful shots of the Baku village and the surrounding  landscape. The biggest complaint I have is that the Baku homeworld looks  far too much like Earth. Even Babylon 5, on a smaller budget, would attempt  to portray alien worlds as being genuinely alien. Just why should the Baku  be human? ...The special effects are surprisingly enough, on a par with those done by ILM in First Contact. It's the first time that the Enterprise has been totally CGI-rendered. The result is very good, although the first shot of the Enterprise at the beginning of the movie looks a bit too much like a hastily constructed plastic model. The battle scenes between the big-E and the bad guys are excellent - probably the best...And Michael Welch gave a better performance in this film than Jake Lloyd did in the lamentable Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. It's too bad the material didn't live up to the performances.
Picard's storyline was rather well developed, and once again Patrick Stewart turns in a sterling performance.  Just as William Shatner was the lead performer in the original series, Patrick Stewart is here. I honestly couldn't imagine a Trek film without him in it. It's also good to see Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Troi's (Marina Sirtis) romance being revived.
Now onto the dissapointments. Firstly, I'm amazed that there were only two references to the Dominion War in the entire film. I've never watched Deep Space Nine, but I gather that the Dominion War is the largest conflict the Federation has ever been involved in, a battle that threatens the very survival of the Federation. So why couldn't the writers use the Dominion War as a starting point, instead of the Baku? After the Borg, the Jem'Hadar and the Founders would've been obvious choices as bad guys. They almost certainly would've been better choices than the Sona'a.
I suspect that the reasons might've been a rift between the creators of ST:TNG and DS9. If that is the case, then shame on both sides. The movie's plotline gives the impression that the Enterprise has not been used in the Dominion War. Many columnists on the internet have assumed that the Enterprise would not be able to cope with the traumas of a real war. Considering the events in First Contact, I hardly think that's the case. But unfortunately, that's the impression I got from this movie.
  ...In conclusion, yes, Insurrection does have more in common with your typical TNG episode. But it's still a thoroughly enjoyable romp with some old friends. But although I understand the creators intentions to try something more lighthearted, surely they could've chosen a subject more in keeping with continuity? The Dominion War would've been a better choice than the Baku.  END",957916800,,3525,4.859766277128547
1017365,1,6305365121,"Okay; so I'm of two minds about this movie.
1). I kind of almost enjoyed it as Star Trek Next Generation movie.
I liked that visual nod to ""Brazil"" with the skin stretching machine. (Come to think of it, an awful lot of the underlying scenery looked like it was recycled from  ""Brazil"" but nevermind. Imitation is the sincerest form of  flattery.)
I also really got into the whole holographic  nothing-is-as-it-seems trip.
But the rest of the film was really  baaaaad. The writing was awful. They used every tired Data cliche in the  book. Poor Brent Spiner looked embarassed about 90% of the time. The female  characters really had nothing to do besides sit there and look ... firm.  And then there was the whole Klingon Puberty Trip. Hello!  MUST we be  treated to large, giant Klingon ZITS? Lock and Load?
2). I HATED it as a  Babylon 5 wanna-be.(Warning: rant follows. As you know, I get riled.)
I  was terribly disturbed by the fact that while Jean-Luc sang Gilbert and  Sullivan, he only made VEILED references to the Holocaust -- The 600!  Get  real.
And while I quite nearly almost enjoyed the constant use of the  word ""relocation"" ( an historical in-joke as the ""relocation  center"" Manzanar is within spitting distance of Bishop,CA, the  shooting location of this film), I was appalled that Jean-Luc conveniently  ""forgot"" to elaborate upon historical fact that the Federation  certainly would NOT have forgotten!
The writers, while self-righteous and  obviously quite pleased with themselves for referencing both the Holocaust  and American concentration camps, sat on the pot while conveniently  forgetting to POOP! They wanna be Babylon 5 but are afraid to deliver  because it might OFFEND somebody.
If one is going to MAKE connections,  one needs to follow through. Let's face it, a lot of Star Trek fans are too  YOUNG to GET the veiled references. It only takes ONE sentence to plant a  seed... And one sentence is all I really wanted.
I know Babylon 5 was  Different. The writers of B5 blatantly used the lessons of history in the  context of a future science fiction universe --I.E., references to the  House Committee and blacklisting as well as honoring those who were  destroyed by ""naming"" their NAMES both aurally and on screen. The  characters in B5 KNEW earth history and discussed it. Now, the characters  in STTNG come from the SAME universe. Are they just... shallow?  Is the  Federation educational system ranked on the same level with that of, say,  Arizona? What's up with that?
Star Trek Insurrection nearly almost  succeed as Star Trek and failed as B5. Do yourself a favor and buy First  Contact or Generations, instead.",957225600,,2655,4.87219730941704
1017366,3,6305365121,"Especially in the face of ST: First Contact, Insurrection comes across as a bitter disappointment. Many of Star Trek's greatest weaknesses shine through all too plainly in this latest rendition. The space battles suffer from the ""last-ditch effort that ends up completely annihiliating the  enemies"" syndrome, the regulars are far more goofy than warranted, and  the almost hubric human-centric foundation of the show is worse than ever.  (aliens once again look _just_ like humans, and Picard seems shocked when  Worf doesn't know who Gilbert and Sullivan are -- how much does Picard know  of 20th century Klingon satiric operatists? Not that the term ""20th  century"" isn't in and of itself a human-centric term...). The climax  is unsatisfying and smacks too strongly of the ones in a large portion of  Star Trek episodes. Nothing original, nothing innovative. Just same old,  same old, and that's just not good enough for me anymore.
Now that I've  got that out of the way, let me talk about the DVD. The video transfer is  only adequate in this film -- I still see some grain and the colors seem a  bit washed out all throughout, especially in the outdoor scenes. The audio  is mediocre as well, with little punch and a general sense of muting all  through the film. And as far as extras go, the ""featurette""  included is a joke -- merely a glorified commercial telling you how great  this movie is.
Yeah, go ahead and get it if you're a Star Trek collector,  but I'd caution against it, at least not without a rental first.",957225600,,1528,4.770992366412214

""Insurrection"" is not a bad  movie. It is fun, interesting, and visually high quality.  The problem here  is that it is a small and derivative plot that would be much better suited  as a one hour television episode. I know that a lot of negative reviews out  here have said the same thing, and at first, I was in total disagreement.  Looking at the movie now, however, I can't help but agree.
Star Trek  movies need to be big and exciting. They need to have excellent stories,  interesting villans, and good special effects.  Insurrection's story was  slightly above average, but it has way too many flaws. The villans are poor  at best, and I am not a big fan of computer-generated starships.
It seems  to have also gotten to the point where ""Insurrection"" has token  action scenes. I like space battles and blazing phaser guns, but the  Enterprise space battle was useless to the story and came across EXACTLY  that way. If a scene like this can't be done purposfully, then save money  and don't write it in.
I liked ""Insurrection"", so please don't  take me for an anti-trek person. I feel it was a very good movie. I just  don't think it makes a very good STAR TREK movie. I actually like 1 and 5  better.

I remember ST  was supposed to be more than just a space shoot 'em up..it was supposed to  be more thoughtful and adventurous, and yes, even HUMOR. The  characterizations and acting were great - you could see that everyone had  fun doing this movie. I loved the Riker/Troi subplot, and I really liked  the fact that Data didn't have the emotion chip (Data was always more  interesting with a purely android perspective) I liked the fact that Picard  had let loose a little (what's wrong w/a little mambo, is he supposed to  only listen to Beethoven's 5th?). I also loved the fact that yes the Fed  has flaws and that it was up to a few good men (and women) to put things to  right. What did the orig ST say? ""Absolute power corrupts  absolutely."" Like so many other gov'ts, the Fed has to look to itself  and make sure it still represents justice, not just power. This isn't the  first time either, remember Undiscovered Country? Also, I'm glad there were  no Borg!! Does every bad guy have to be the Borg? Tiresome. And you run the  risk of making the Borg into a 1D enemy, like the Klingons became in the  original.

However, I must say that Paramount has really missed the boat on these  DVDs.  Insurrection comes with a lame 10 minute making-of featurette, but  that's it.  Let's face it, we Trekkers are the ones who WOULD sit through a  two hour director's commentary, or 5 theatrical trailers, or real  behind-the-scenes documentaries, etc.

There are a few moments when I found myself wincing at the humour, but, they didn't taint my overall enjoyment of the film. There are so many delights contained  within it. First, the threat isn't to Earth. It's not a threat against  ""us"". It's a threat against a ""them"" who are being  viewed as an ""it"" by those who would have the secret of their  longevity. The character development is nowhere near as ham-handed as in  the previous two TNG film outings. It's blessedly subtle. The special  effects are almost totally breathtaking, and, for my money, my favorite  aspect of INSURRECTION is the believability of The Enterprise as a ship and  not just a set. There are subtle tricks involved, esp. the use of  realistically over-lapping dialogue in the scenes on board the ship. This  tells an intelligent and not overly-preachy story while satisfying a Trek  fan's demands for Riker-rants, Data-silliness, Geordi's-humanity and  Picard, well, Picard being the type of character to make one consider  adopting a What-Would-Picard-Do? outlook on life.

If you're looking for an entertaining science fiction movie  featuring both romance and humor, then this is the one to see. As a Star  Trek: NG fan, I persuaded friends and family to go and see it with me.  Everyone loved it.
It has comedy: the tongue-in-cheek moments with Data,  Worf going through puberty, and the interplay among the characters. The  funniest Star Trek by far.
It has romance: Picard and the mysterious  woman he meets and Riker and Troi finally get together! What more could you  ask for?
It does have a slow pace at the beginning (like that of a TV  episode) but again you shouldn't be expecting a grand space-drama. Every  scene will affect you in some way. It will make you laugh, touch your heart  (I.e. - When Geordi sees his first sunrise.), or leave you wondering about  the mysterious, fountain-of-youth planet and the aliens who want to destroy  it. The drama slowly builds and the mystery slowly reveals itself until it  escalates into a very satisfying ending. Add in great special effects and  superb acting all around, and this a great movie.

No mandatory scenes like in the first TNG movies.  In  the 1st we knew we would have to see some contrived plot putting Picard and  Kirk on screen at the same time.

Fortunately the DVD release has enabled me to check the film out again and I find that it improves with viewing. The reviewer  who talks about moving away from machines etc seems to be talking about a  different movie. The Baku have opted for a simpler life, they are not  luddites. Nor is there anything in the plot to suggest that they soon  realise their need to depend on machines. Try watching it next time.
All  in all I thought that it was well paced and thought provoking. There are  many examples in history of minority interests being trampled and this  ""greater good for the greater number"" ideology is sadly still  prevalent in the world. I like the message of the film and it restores my  faith in the Star Trek saga. Voyager still has a long way to go before it  gets this good. This film is a breath of fresh air and in spite of all  those who criticise it because it comes across as an extended TV episode I  think its good that there is the occasional film which moves away from  space battles. I hope that there will be more Next Generation cast movies  to come and perhaps its time to have two sets of movies, the other series  to feature DS9.
This DVD is a good transfer and the sound is good. Its a  pity that there aren't any other features even some bios might have been  nice.

The plot is, OK, standard Star trek fare, but at least it does not resort to banal, not to mention  totally illogical, time  travel twists. I was so disappointed with Generations and First Contact  because they refused to give the audience any credit for some common sense.  The story line in this film does not stretch our credulity, and allows all  the actors to shine.
Indeed it is so refereshing to see the characters  have their grand scenes ( though some what annoying to still see that  Picard is not allowed to have a true romance, his kissing scenes were cut  ), and also to see broad but believable comedy in a Star trek film. I was  laughing out loud many times.....
The film is most reminscent of The  Undiscovered Country in the way that it allows the plot to create  characters that we believe in. It makes for good heroes and remarkable  villains ( F. Murray Abraham is superb ). Ok some of the make-ups are a  little phoney, I am still not sure of the plastic surgery styling, and some  of the CGI effects are  a little computer game-ish, and I am still not too  sure if I like the new Enterprise, but overall this is now one of my  favourite Star Trek movies.",929750400,,1264,4.402597402597403

It was a period when DS9 was pushing the Star Trek to a new heights where Gene Roddenberry dare not go. In comparison, Insurrection appears to be stale and dull. I think the basic story line failed to excite any one. I don't mind the humor and the banter that goes on among the crew, those were the hallmarks of all Star Trek movies and shows. But the story was really a non-event and it take place during the DS9's Domainion War which was even mentioned in the movie. What was the Federation's Flagship doing so far away from the frontlines while rest of Starfleet is fighting for its life? When at the times when millions of people were dying in a war on DS9, this movie story sound pretty petty and trivial.

Eight years after the fact, the movie still don't look any better. The people who made this movie appears to forget that its always about the story in Star Trek. The fans can forgive special effects or other such things. Fans also can't understand why Worf was there. Doesn't he have enough things to do at DS9 to keep him busy?? When two Star Trek worlds don't jive, we usually blame the weak link and in this case, its the movie.

As a ""Trekkie"", I can watch this movie although I may do so without any great joy. The Special Edition DVD set come with a lot of extras which make up for the dour movie and I enjoyed the extras more then the actual film. The image presentation and sound proves to be excellent.

A better way to have ended the film would have  been to have lots of federation ships fighting the Sona and to bring about  what was hinted at - the fall of the Federation. That would have made a  good ending.

1017951,4,6305365121,"This film was critisised right from the start for being a long TV episode. To be honest, I don't care. Rather than the majority of Star Trek movies, which have a 'universe - threatening' feel, this kept it simple and  enjoyable.
First Contact was a better film, it has to be said, but this  does not make this any less of a film than it was.
True Star Trek fans  will, of course, snap this film up. The general public will like it because  of the TV episode feel, and all over it's only sufferance will be the  complaints that it could have been shorter (hence a TV episode). I  disagree. The film was enjoyable from start to finish, and has added to the  rapidly improving quality of the ST film series.
I won't be buying the  video. But I'm going to catch it on rental, and also when it's on TV. Good  fun for all the family (except the plastic surgery bits) - especially Troi  and Riker getting a bit hot under the collar...",926467200,,927,4.2457142857142856

1018114,4,6305365121,"Insurrection was by far one of the best television episodes, problem is, Insurrection is a movie.  The storyline was excellent and the graphics were well thought out (all except for that crazy scene with the  joystick...uuuugggtttthhhh!!) The best way to describe this movie is that  it would be best for a more diverse audience rather than just trekkies.  Perhaps the biggest fault with this movie, and all the STTNG movies, is in  the area of character development. Most of the development takes place  between only a few people and thus it tends to become seperated from what's  going on in the movie and the other characters. Lastly, the producers need  to realize that the STTNG show has been a big contributer to the success of  Star Trek all together. Instead of trying to come up with huge, granduer  plots, the movies should continue to follow the storyline being continued  with the current Star Trek shows still being aired.  I leave with this  question...Why would the flagship of the federation be off chasing petty  concerns when the federation is nearly being defeated by the dominion?",925344000,,1100,4.907608695652174
1018115,3,6305365121,"The movie was a two hour Star Trek The Next Generation television episode.  It was nice getting together with our old friends from NCC-1701-D.  Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard) was again exceptional.  Please kill off  Counselor Troi (What is her reason for being?)  Data was also exceptional.  Jordi was refreshing as was Riker.  I think that guiding the E Model of the  Enterprise with a ""Joystick"" was a bit over the edge (What were  they thinking of except maybe for the comic relief?) Overall the Enterprise  and her crew are exceptional and I also would like to see Q as the bad boy  again.  The special effects were not up to Star Trek standards, not even  Star Wars standards. I will purchase the video for my collection.",925344000,,728,4.682539682539683

1018179,1,6305365121,"The very best episodes of the Star Trek television series (pl) are those which hold up viewing after viewing--a strong plot, charismatic characters, believable dialogue, and unique (usually) story. The same holds for the  films, which is why this one is disappointing compared to most of its  predecessors.  The story lacks strength, the humor scenes are contrived,  and (in my opinion), the characterizations are wrong.  Most of the main  characters of The Next Generation cast are lost in the movie, particularly  Geordi, Troi, and Dr. Crusher.  The effects are good, but I would have  preferred less effects and more substance.
However, this is a fairly  ""good"" movie by box-office standards, and worth seeing at least  once, although three or more times would be too many.",924480000,4,776,5.128

By the same note, the people who say it was the worst Trek, or  even the worst film of the year are just mad that the film was not as good  as it could have or should have been.  The film lies somewhere in between.  It's worth watching, and if you own Star Trek:TMP, Star Trek V, or even  Generations, then you should own this too.",923788800,,487,4.073684210526316
1018181,2,6305365121,"Looking back through the Star Trek films, one notices that the even numbered movies are the ones that stand out to Trekkers.  No one can forget the nail-biting battle in the Mutara Nebula in the second film.  Everyone  quotes the famous line, ""Well a double dumb butt on you"" from the  fourth movie.  Then there was the sad farwell to the old crew in the sixth  film.  Finally the amazing special effects and action-packed battles in the  eighth film.  Star Trek: Insurrection did not have any remmeberable lines  or action scenes that Trekkers would relish in for years to come like the  examples just mentioned.  Aside from the touching scene when Jordi recovers  his eye sight after being born blind, I can't remember any other scenes  from the movie and its just four months after I saw the movie.  The special  effects were a disappointment compared to those of First Contact. The story  line was uncreative and lacked substance.  It kept the movie from dragging  on, but it also made the movie move too quickly.  I got the impression that  the movie was about 45 minutes long.  It did have good comic touches which  have been a good tradition in the Star Trek film series.  All the Trekker  can do with this is know that the ongoing theme of even-numbered Trek  movies are better and use this movie as a stepping stone to a movie with a  more exciting plot and special effects that are worthy of the nam Star  Trek!",923788800,2,1421,4.553784860557769

The cosmetic surgery freak is a lot  like Dr. Soren in that he wants to live forever, not caring about what it  costs to the innocent people that just happen to be in his way. These two  movies have the same ""Fountain of Youth"" type thing going on.  They could have thought of something better for the script.  Why not have  something about the Dominion with lots of carnage and battle scences.  Romance is good too, and I would like to add, I was relieved when Riker and  Troi got back together.

Insurrection was a movie for everyone: Trekkies, Trekkers and general movie goers.  It  combined drama, humour and moral questioning, provoking  the movie goings'  brain into thinking outside the realm of the storyline.
In previous TNG  films, the writers have tried to bring in new concepts that (for me) really  haven't worked:  Data with a sense of humour and Geordie with eyes.  This  film brought in some wonderful concepts which complimented the tv series,  rather than ignored the character development previously defined:  look for  some fun warbling between Picard, Worf and Data; the relationship between  Riker and Troy (it's been bursting to happen for years) and the beautiful  scene as Geordie catches the sunset over the village.
For the non  trekkie, the setting was beautiful and you can imagine this place being a  piece of heaven.  The direction and filming was good too.

7887964,4,6305365121,"Star Trek: Insurrection marks a turning point in the TNG movies where many of fans started to witness a decline in the quality of the TNG films.

Personally, I've always enjoyed this movie. I was a kid in the 90s when Star Trek: First Contact came out, and it is by far my favorite Trek film, up there with Wrath of Khan and Star Trek 2009. Like Khan, First Contact is an emotional roller coaster, and for a first time viewing, terrifying with the Borg.

It's for those reasons why I like Insurrectionit's a completely different kind of movie from its predecessor, more resembling a high budget episode of the series than a time travel Trek film with an overwhelming villain. It reminds us what the Federation is about, and exploration. It's a moral conflict film, versus a battle for survival like Khan and First Contact.

Does the film have some flaws? Yes. There's weak lead villains, and some writing problems (namely the whole ""I've never kissed you with a beard before"" and other ret-cons) and some child focused CGI creatures and Data humor that don't play well with an older Trek fan like me.

But there's also a lot to like here. Picard's romance, the re-ignited flames between Riker and Troi, and the situational humor that Data and Worf lend to the whole production.

Make no mistake, the film that comes after this (Nemesis) SUCKS. But this movie isn't as bad as you might think, and I enjoy re-watching it frequently.",1505520000,,1430,4.658730158730159
