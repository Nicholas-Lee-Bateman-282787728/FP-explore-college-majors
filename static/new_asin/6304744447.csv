7876373,3,6304744447,"Since its inception in 1995, the Alaye Calendar has become one of the most successful of the growing number of black-oriented calendars. This 75-minute video is a promotional tool that showcases the 1998 calendar,  which like the others features color photographs of high-profile black men  each representing a particular month. Many of the photographs show the men  bare-chested and/or posing in swimsuits or other informal attire. Some may  dismiss ""The Men of Alaye"" as superficial ""beefcake,""  but that may be an overly harsh judgment. The overall tone and presentation  is in decidedly good taste. The video consists mainly of brief interviews  with the men and snippets from the various photo sessions. Many of these  are entertaining and sometimes even touching, such as when actor Malik Yoba  introduces his mother. Actor Shemar Moore has probably appeared more times  than anyone else as an Alaye Calendar subject, and his upbeat, positive  comments are another big plus. Basketball star Rick Fox also offers some  interesting comments about his life, career and goals. Among the other men  featured in the video are singer Ginuwine, singer Kenny Latimore, actor  James McDaniel, and former athlete Willie Gault, who is also one of the  originators of the calendar. ""The Men of Alaye"" video, like the  calendar, is a nice diversion, and it offers a welcome break from the  ""thug"" and ""gangsta"" images that are too often  presented in the media as representing black men.",962841600,4,1479,5.168776371308017
