5170608,4,B008NNY8EU,An interesting DVD.  I enjoyed watching the movie and would recommend it to people who enjoy period movies about the  Roman Empire,1361318400,5,130,4.863636363636363
5170609,4,B008NNY8EU,"Gold for the Caesars is enjoyable without showing signs of great movie making. It follows a most interesting historical novel loosely, and gets at least one historical event wrong. The Roma emperor who immediately follows evil Diocletion is old Nervii. Trajan comes later. However, I would watch it again for entertainment value.",1361059200,6,329,5.346153846153846
5170610,3,B008NNY8EU,"Warner Archive has released Director Andre De Toth's 'GOLD FOR THE CAESARS' aka 'ORO PER I CESARI'- 1964, a film which hit theaters on the downward spiral of the sword and sandal genre or pepla as they were known in Europe.  An Italian American co-production, it stars two actors Jeffrey Hunter and Ron Randall who were involved in another Epic lensed in Spain from Producer Samuel Bronston, Director Nicholas Ray's 'KING OF KINGS'- 1961 and has some good action sequences but fails to hold up its 90 minute running time due to its lacklustre script by Arnold Perl.  Based on the a prizewinning historical novel by Florence A. Seward, it has Hunter playing a slave who happens to be a genius at architecture who is hired to oversee a Roman construction site and is promised his freedom if he can successfully deliver a gold mining operation.  Unfortunately, he has hanky panky with the mistress of a senator played gloriously evil by Massimo Girotti who, needless to say, doesn't appreciate the lack of affection.  In between the soap, we have some great elements interfering with the lovers: an approaching Celt army, Randall's equally villainous portrayal of a centurion working for Girotti and an avalanche at the mine.  It may read well as described but it comes off as a really flat affair.  Director De Toth, famous for having directed the Vincent Price Horror vehicle of 1953 'HOUSE OF WAX' in 3D despite having only one eye, does what he can with the script.  Mylene Demongeot, who is very pretty, is wasted as Penelope, Hunter's inamorata and bounces back and forth in a tug of war between the male testosterone.  Even the spectacular climax which was co-directed by Italian icon Riccardo Freda can't save the day.  Although boasting a fine music score by Franco Mannino and nice images by Raffaele Masciocchi, the film emerges as a disappointment for both action and sword and sandal fans.  Warner releases it as a DVD-R in a stunning 2.35 transfer with no extras.  For Epic completists only.",1348099200,13,2002,4.841642228739003
8529162,4,B008NNY8EU,"I was pleasantly surprised with this one, well done with a good story historically based (?!) and with Jeffrey Hunter looking like he is somewhat displaced on a set  A LONG WAYS FROM ''KING OF KINGS'' (1961) and the EXCELLENCE of THAT EPIC SAMUEL BRONSTON FILM  WITH THE PRODUCER'S OUTSTANDING  STAMP OF QUALITY  NOWHERE TO BE FOUND here in this cardboard corn- cobbing caper (as I call them!) which somehow  rises above the usual  EXPECTATIONS OF the' sword and sex and sand' Italian epics' that I have seen.

8529164,3,B008NNY8EU,"Well, I have to say this old 1963 ""sword and sandal"" epic was a cut above the rest. There were a few ""more mainstream"" actors that you may recognize from American movies at the time and not the usual cast of bad Italian actors. There are still the dubbed voices and the Styrofoam rocks that cascade down cliffs but not too bad. We do get a very young Jeffrey Hunter (OMG) as the slave architect building Rome's bridges in Gaul. The emperor wants gold, and they have to deal with the Celts to get it. The lone (main) female star? awesomely BAD! Her name may have been Mylene Demongeot and with any luck she never worked again.",1431993600,,625,4.35042735042735

There are few 'great' movies, so I find it silly to even rate it against movies of that caliber. It is still entertaining and I have watched it several times.",1401494400,2,282,4.4423076923076925
