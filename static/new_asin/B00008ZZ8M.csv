7988454,4,B00008ZZ8M,"In this drama, happily married Raj (Salman Khan) and Priya (Rani Mukerji) are devastated to learn that Priya can not have children.  She considers adoption, but for certain reasons, settles on the idea of a secret surrogate pregnancy.  Raj finds a young prostitute, Madhubala (Preity Zinta) who is willing to carry a child for the couple.  As can be expected, the path chosen by Raj and Priya is not a smooth one.

For the most part, this is a solidly good film, that has the viewer uncertain as to what will be the eventual outcome.  Those familiar with Hollywood's Pretty Woman, will recognize certain scenes, but they work quite well in this setting, too.  Khan seems to have only one emotion in this movie,  and  Mukerji spends most of her time weeping.  However, they are generally convincing in their roles, especially as they are the backdrop for Zinta's exceptional performance as Madhu. Regardless of how one feels about the topic, the movie is worth watching for her alone.

The cast also includes Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal, Prem Chopra, and Johnny Lever.",1521158400,,1065,4.834254143646409

7988456,2,B00008ZZ8M,"Though acting was WONDERFUL in this movie, the story descends into annoying stereotypes and misconceptions. Examples: The wife telling her husband that they could ""never fully accept an adopted child as their own,"" the filmmakers' idea that a surrogate mother would have sex with the husband, and that the surrogate and the couple would live together in an ""alternative lifestyle"" for a year. I mean, come on, who does that rather than using artificial insemination? Typical male fantasy - getting it on with a sexy prostitute along with your all-forgiving (participating!) wife. Then there's the stereotype of the noble, all-sacrificing woman that lays down her own dignity for the sake of her in-laws and husband. Father-in-law dreams of a ""mini Raj"" (a little grandson that looks just like his son), so of course the wife rules out adoption -- the kid won't LOOK like you, dear. Then there's the ginormous deception involved -- not telling the in-laws about the wife's infertility, not telling them about the surrogacy, which means of course FOREVER deceiving their child. It's like they were saying ""why does the kid need to know his or her origins?"" They will ultimately lie to their kid for the rest of their lives. Hopefully that bio mom doesn't come back at some point and spill the news.... Which brings us to the nice, clean tie-up at the end -- surrogate mom struggles for a minute with her agreement to surrender her child, wife slaps her (apparently slapping some of that noble, self-sacrificing spirit into her), and all of a sudden surrogate happily decides she will give her child over and just move on. No more contact, please. Be happy. Gotta love the copy-catting too (""Pretty Woman"" was ripped off line-for-line in many scenes). The acting was outstanding, but this one made me want to reach for the Pepto Bismol afterwards.",1239062400,4,1844,4.932475884244373
7988457,4,B00008ZZ8M,"Other reviews have covered the plot so I'll just add a few comments.
Comparisons have been made to 'Pretty Woman'. Actually there is a sequence that is a complete nod to a sequence in the Hollywood movie. Salmon Khan didn't do it with quite the same playfulness as Richard Gere did though. Apart from that the story is nothing like 'Pretty' Woman and this section of the movie is fairly short.
This movie is well acted by all. Salmon Khan can be a bit variable for me but in this movie he played the part of the sensitive caring husband very well and there was good chemistry between he and Rani. All the support actors were also good and portrayed an idealised warm family.
The script has many moments of caring people being unselfish for those they love. It is unashamedly sentimental (but I don't have a problem with that). It may be unreal but its nice to take a break from 'real' and hangout in the nice side of human nature.
The movie tackles a few taboos for India - surrogate parenting and prostitution- in a way that is non-judgmental.
No real noted dances for me and the music didn't remain with me (though Preity got into one more catchy one earlier).
Fairly solid little sanitised feel-good movie that I'm happy to revisit sometime.",1232064000,2,1244,4.533333333333333
7988458,4,B00008ZZ8M,"This movie has been compared to, and is roughly analogous to the American film ""Pretty Woman"" in a lot of ways, but it's actually a lot better!  If only they had cast someone other than the not-particularly-appealing Salman Khan in the male lead role, I'd have given it five stars.  There is a lot more going on here than in the predictable American plot.  Rani Mukherjee is fantastic as always, but Preity Zinta really carries the film right over the top.  She is an entirely sympathetic character, as is Rani, and that's what gives the film a very interesting complexity.  The only real question is, why would either one of them get worked up about Salman Khan?He is by far the weakest character of the three. Now, if it were Shah Rukh Khan in the lead, or Abhishek Bachchan, that would have given us all something to work with.  Whatever.  Farida Jalal is also excellent, as always, as the mother we all WISH we'd had.  I definitely recommend this film very highly.  Well, almost.",1153267200,3,983,4.603448275862069

7988460,4,B00008ZZ8M,"This film of ""Chori Chori Chupke Chupke"" is it's own original story, but it does have a hint of ""Pretty Woman"" in this which adds shape to the whole story.

This is a story about a rich man Raj (Salman Khan), who meets and marries Priya (Rani Mukherjee), and they intend to have a child right away.  Raj's grandfather (Amrish Puri) is anxious to see an heir be born to the family before he dies someday.  Priya gets pregnant and the family floods them with loving attention.  Then, while the family plays cricket, the ball lands near Priya who is watching the game.  As she gets up to retrieve their ball, she trips and falls and injures herself badly.  The doctor says that she will be fine, but they lose the baby.  What's more, Priya will never be able to get pregnant again.  Knowing that this will devastate Raj's grandfather because there will not be an heir to the family, Raj and Priya decide to keep this a secret from the family.  Raj and Priya decide to hire a surrogate mother to bare a child with Raj.  Raj heads out to the red light district and finds a willing ""lady of the night"" named Madhoo (Preity Zinta), and offers to pay her a small fortune to have his child.  So Raj and Priya tell their family that they are going to move to Switzerland for a year because Raj (says he) has a business prospect he wants to explore.  These two take Madhoo with them and so the three will live together.  Priya stays at a bus depot throughout a rainy cold night so that Raj and Madhoo can ""do the deed"" so that Madhoo can become pregnant.  As Raj and Priya take care of Madhoo, Raj tries to teach Madhoo how to walk, talk, and be more like a respectable lady, and not the ""no class"" bar girl that she has always been.  As Madhoo grows into becoming a respectable, loving, woman, she also starts to fall in love with Raj.  Priya begans to feel the threat of Madhoo's yearnings nearing the final stages of Madhoo's pregnancy.  And to make matters worse, Raj's family decided to show up in Switzerland in an unannounced surprise visit, to be with Raj and Priya when the baby is born.
