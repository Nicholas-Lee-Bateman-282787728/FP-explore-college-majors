8358442,4,B000KLPC2A,So far so good.  Have not watched all of it. Purchased for my students to watch.,1469145600,,80,4.0
8358443,2,B000KLPC2A,It's a good tape. Not truly what I expected due to the threading style used in the video is not the same as seen in all the shops.,1442188800,,130,3.6785714285714284
8358444,1,B000KLPC2A,I wanted to LOVE this. I hoped she would show the mouth holding method and give me lots is confidence pertaining to the brows etc. At one point she was threading feet! I felt it was poorly executed and I've learned more for FREE watching YouTube.,1438041600,,246,4.369565217391305
8358445,5,B000KLPC2A,I highly recommend it.,1415664000,,22,4.75
8358446,1,B000KLPC2A,"Bought this dvd thinking it would help me improve my threading technique. It was absolutely useless. She only shows one technique and literally shows that technique for less than 5 minutes. You are better off watching someone at a salon or on youtube. This is the 3rd video I have ordered from this company. The first being, Brazilian waxing and the 2nd facial waxing. All three were a waste of money. If you are a beginner you might get something out of them, but if you want to get some tips and you have been in the business a while, do not bother. For the price this company is charging for the videos they are way over-priced.",1291248000,2,631,4.401709401709402
8358447,5,B000KLPC2A,"Threading can be very difficult to learn, however, this video made it much easier! What I've learned about Threading is that it takes a lot of practice. I've seen some of those budget clips on youtube and they were useless! This video teaches the true fundementals of threading thoroughly and with practice I think most people can learn how to do it. I was really impressed with this video and recommend it to anyone wanting to learn how to do threading!",1207785600,,454,4.617283950617284
8358448,1,B000KLPC2A,"This dvd was a let down.  The specialist barely gave me anymore information than watching youtube videos.  Save your money.  Watch people doing it on youtube.  My skin care specialists watched it as well and just turned their heads in disbelief.  They end up using a tweezer to shape the eyebrows for goodness sakes. I hoped they would give(at least three I know of) different techniques such as using the thread off the spool instead of making a loop.  Or speaking about exact thread weight instead of just saying, ""use 100% cotton sewing thread"".  They didn't talk about using different colored threads or any other pors and cons or speaking about different kinds of cooling gels or using numbing creams.  Saira Soleri has a very thick accent and was also diffcult to understand. Very disappointed.",1189036800,3,800,4.874074074074074
