8760635,5,B01FCGI0Y4,"New DVD that appeared on Japan's anime TV channel in the early part of 2016. Along with the DVD ""Erased"" that was also released last year, these two DVD's won high acclaim as two of 2016's best...and the critics were absolutely right. Both are now available at very reasonable costs. Schwarzesmarken is a gem once you understand that it is a very violent story and definitely not for those under 18. An interesting 12-part DVD that takes place in Germany centered around a highly charged East vs. West which are still divided (with a ton of weird aliens fighting both sides) and are already distrustful of one another. The Japanese seem to have grasped the European political situation in developing this story running parallel to the iron curtain era.

The real villains are a third group (Stasi) which are a hard core socialists bordering on dictatorship and want to keep the East Germans and West Germans scrapping among themselves while also supporting the war against the alien BETA forces. Stasi is close to being akin to the NAZI of WW2 by maintaining a ruthless gestapo security force against the two German countries. That being explained...the story centers on the East German side where an elite fighter squadron commanded by a blond Captain (Ilsa) who is hard and unyielding on the surface (but, sensitive and patriotic inside). Her squadron is totally devoted to her (albeit some who are strictly cold military-minded). Ilsa has one male pilot who keeps to himself and does his job efficiently . He becomes the center of the story and cannot escape several situations which involve the other female pilots. He rescues one defector pilot (Katrina) from the West and has to continually defend her against the constant distrust of the other pilots. When his long-lost stepsister is assigned to his squadron, that creates even more distrust problems. He has to overcome so many problems internally, that he actually evolves into the a super patriot with a sensitive side to emerge as a hero at the end.

This is one of those DVD's that you might find the need to review 2-3 times to keep up with the complex plot. There are many characters and many sub plots, but they are done in-depth and done well. The animation is very good. The show becomes more and more intense and really holds your interest. You grow very attached to many of the female characters and began to really hate the bad guys and girls. The difficult part is that the battle scenes are violent and bloody (and, unfortunately several key characters are unexpectedly killed off). There is some minor nudity and racy dialog included. The constant battle against the BETA aliens almost becomes secondary to the excellent and complex character developments.

Schwarzesmarken is unique to most other anime action/adventure stories as it isn't centered in Japan and the graphic art definitely reflects Central Europe. In my humble opinion, this DVD is destined to become frontrunner for the quality of the story and the characters. Despite it's violent scenes, this DVD has a lot going for it and the last five episodes build so much tension, it seemed almost a relief when the somewhat happy ending finally arrives. I'd rate this one among the Top Ten Anime DVD's I've watched over the years.",1487116800,,3264,4.888086642599278
