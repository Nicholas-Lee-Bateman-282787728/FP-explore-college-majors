Yeah, I told him, ""Hey, no  more Nitrous Oxide"" but it made me wonder....had seeing this movie on  TV 20 years ago when I was 10 leave me hypnotized? Had the Crab Monsters  stolen my mind and replaced pertinent information with images of Clark  Gable? It was the hideous effect of those dirty Reds, I was sure.

941327,3,6304963084,"I've wanted to get this movie on video for years, and finally got one thanks to Amazon. A glorious low-budget Roger Corman piece that has some surprisingly clever ideas in its script, and a bit of genuinely creepy  atmosphere. Sure, the crab monsters themselves are a bit naff, but that's  exaactly what you expect when you watch a movie like this. If you can't  appreciate the finer points of a B-movie, you should obviously stay well  away. But if you remember watching this one on television when you were a  kid, like me, you may find yourself drawn to it the same way I was.
The  print used for the video is not very good, unfortunately. Too much  contrast, and it looks like it's more than one generation down from the  master video copy. It makes it difficult to see what's happening at times.  I don't know if other editions have better video quality. Although the  edition I have is recorded at SP, it almost looks as if it were dubbed from  an EP tape.
But you know what? I'm still happy I have the video. Any  Saturday morning I can escape back to my childhood by watching a cheap  B&W monster flick is a good one to me, and this is a perfect movie to  fit the bill.",946857600,15,1177,4.315068493150685

The crab monsters are ridiculous looking.  There is a fair sense of doom because the island the scientists are stranded on is slowly being eaten away by the monsters and whatever unnatural forces.  My only complaint is that the Allied Artists Classics DVD release is not the best quality.  The picture is not sharp and clear.  Hopefully a re-mastered will be released soon.

941558,2,6304963084,"Yes. Roger Corman was the king of low budget, cheesy movies in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s...wait! He's still making low budget, cheesy movies. Now and then he made something genuinely decent. This wasn't one of those times.

Here's the scoop. A group of scientists and a couple of sailors head to a remote Island to search for a previous crew who seem to have disappeared. While doing research, running various tests and occasionally searching for their lost comrades, odd things begin to happen and some in their party go missing or are outright killed. What could be wrong?

This is some awful stuff. Corman made a few movies where he puts a small group of people in a remote house with a looming, .malevolent force lurking nearby. It's the same here but we're supposed to believe this house, which would look right at home in Southern California,has been built to house a bunch of eggheads on a remote Island. The story is clunky with some odd stuff happening thrown in. So why is it the script writer had it so these dead folk speak, telepathically, to the live folk? And why is it the crab monsters need to destroy the Island bit by bit to herd their prey into a corner. Why don't they just attack outright. he movie is  replete with nonsensical stuff like that. The acting is uneven. The directing is uneven. The giant crabs are horrendous.

I remember seeing this as a kid, along with all the other Saturday matinee garbage I ingested. I had to visit it for old times sake. Thank God it has a mercifully trim 62 minute running time.

941562,4,6304963084,"I somewhat reluctantly admit that I was entertained by this movie, ""Attack by the Crab Monsters"". It's not that bad, if you keep in mind that it was made by B-film guru Roger Corman in 1957.

A group of scientists on a remote island in the Pacific are attacked by a gigantic, intelligent and apparently telepathic crab. Another result of nuclear tests gone dangerously wrong. Several of the scientists speak with distinctly foreign accents. The Einstein stereotype? Or Operation Paperclip as usual?

The crab has the ability to ""assimilate"" the consciousness of its victims, a common science fiction plot device. Unfortunately, it doesn't assimilate the morality of the dead humans, just their raw intelligence. Thus, the monster destroys most radio equipment on the island in an attempt to stop the scientists from calling in the U.S. Navy for assistance.

As the mother of all mutant crabs systematically starts destroying the entire island, the remaining heroes discover the monster's only weak spot: it's sensitive to electricity....

941564,2,6304963084,"I love these old 1950's sci-fi flicks. I grew up on a steady appetite of these movies thanks to my local Creature Feature. I'm always on the hunt for these ""forgotten classics"".

With that said, ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" is pretty bad. I will say that the creature F/X are actually really good! (Well, with the exception of the human like eyeballs on the crabs). The crabs looks creepy, and huge and scary, but that's about the only redeeming aspect.

A group of scientists show up on a remote Pacific island which has been bathed in radiation thanks to some nuclear testing done on another near-by island. The scientists also hope to learn the fate of a previous expedition which has been stationed on the island. The group of scientists soon come under attack by the titual crab monsters, and these crabs aren't just huge...they have absorbed the intelligence of the people they've killed previously.

While the monsters look cool, quite a bit of the movie is spent in a wood paneled living room while people talk. This is a very talky movie....so talky that the crab monsters themselves have almost as many lines of dialogue as the actors. When the crabs do attack, it's fun, but there are way too many dull patches of film to get through. If you are yearning to see people sit around talking about monsters, then this is the movie for you, otherwise give this one a pass, and watch something else.",1376956800,,1405,4.634538152610442

941634,4,6304963084,"""Attack Of The Crab Monsters"" is one of those movies best viewed if you leave your brain parked in the lobby and just sit back and enjoy.  I remember back in 1957, a certain 12 year old I know very well sat in the local Bijou with some of his friends jumping and screaming and having a great time pretending they were scared. Except that 12 year old was really scared. Over time that 12 year old I know so well has come to appreciate the inspired silliness this movie really is and tastier than a soft-shelled crab, but today that 12 year old is a bit older, still a lover of horror movies, and even Broadway musicals and loves to shoot pistols(if they ever remove the suspension from his LTC) but sometimes it's fun to be nostalgic even if it's over some lightweight piece of trifle like ""Attack Of The Crab Monsters"" and wonder, ""whatever happened to that 12 year old seated in the darkened theatre, clutching his box of popcorn in terror as he watched an oversized paper maches crab mobilized by someone wearing sneakers?""

Special note:  The four stars is for the nostalgia this movie brings, not the worth of the movie.  Back in the 50's most creature features were bargain basement budgets but a double feature was always fun on a rainy Saturday matinee.  Ah, the good old days,  a double feature+popcorn+soda and a box of juju beads=$1.25 total.  Nowadays, 1 movie+popcorn+soda-no juju beads=bank loan.  LOL",1325808000,,1414,4.628

Very enjoyable Roger Corman 1957 Sci-fi horror quickie that runs for 67 minutes as it was part of a double feature with the brilliant ""Not of this Earth"". Russell was way before his time of doing ""Gilligan's Island"" and this movie shows that his acting skills on film isn't cracked up to be.

941639,4,6304963084,"Before the sophistocation of film methods, mavericks like Roger Corman, Edward L Cahn and, yes, even Ed Wood attempted to put on film their vision. The Indie film is now respected more than ever, but the primitive filmmaking of those ""pioneers"" cannot be dismissed. Corman survived, with studio support, but many didn't. Films as crappy as Attack of the Crab Monsters are still viable as classic status because, thanks to the drive-in crowd, they made money. As a 60-ish film fan, I can't recall being more intrigued by these 50's schlock films as a child, genuinely scared and exhilarated. I love watching them again, smiling fondly at the bad acting and cheap sets, and knowing that there is value in these silly films, if only because they hold a place in my remote youth. These films are nostalgic, sure, but I'll bet those directors were trying to achieve something, if only a few bucks. Corman survived; his Poe series (especially Pit & Pendulum) intrigue even now. I am absolutely certain that there are very many out there who love this stuff. To the film snobs, we don't care what you think.

941714,3,6304963084,"This review applies to the ""Allied Artists"" version, not the other one floating around these days. As long as you keep your expectations fairly low, this is really fairly enjoyable.

Giant crab monsters, produced by atomic testing (of course), terrorize a scientific expedition sent to an unstable island, who were sent there to find out what happened to the last scientific expedition that was terrorized by the same giant crab monsters. Not really quick on their crab legs, the crab monsters are able to communicate telepathically with their soon to be victims, luring them into the creepy shoreline cave where the crabs hang out.

  As silly as most of this sounds, this movie scared the snot out me when I was a little kid. The special effects, even compared with other sci-fi flicks of the era, are pretty bad. Even so, the dialogue is decent and the acting is competent. The film is short (69 minutes) and it moves along at a good pace. Look for Russell ""The Professor"" Johnson trying to fix a busted short wave radio, a skill he would use again years later on Gilligan's Island.

  It's really a shame that there does not seem to be a decent print of this film out there. At least one reviewer has rated this the worst quality DVD that he's ever seen. I'd say that it's not very good but watchable. It seems to be out of print now but available on EBAY in the $20 range. The other version that I have not seen is cheaper; around $10.

  If you're a fan of these old 50's sci-fi flicks and you can put up with the less than great picture quality, you'd probably get a kick out of this one.",1263168000,,1595,4.450171821305842

941720,3,6304963084,"I had seen ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" many years ago, but recently bought the DVD when it was repeatedly cited as one of the inspirations for ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" (which I highly recommend) by filmmaker Larry Blamire in the ""Cadavra"" commentary track. Blamire correctly cites this as representative of the late 1950's monster movie genre, although I think he has more affection for this particular film than I do.

The movie is a standard adventure on a deserted island in which a scientific expedition is ravaged by horrific mutant creatures, in this case terrifying giant ventriloquist crabs, while the cast gets thinned out over the 69 minute running time. The most recognizable cast member is Russell Johnson (the Professor from ""Gilligan's Island"") who once again finds himself on an island without the proper equipment. The two highlights of the film for me are the somber earnestness that the cast exudes throughout the production (which Blamire so effectively parodies in ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"") and the startlingly abrupt ending, which is jarring even for the genre.

While this is a piece of nostalgic fun, this film actually drags quite a bit in long, boring conversational scenes, making the film seem much longer than its actual length.

941799,2,6304963084,"Having seen ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" as a child I already was familiar with the storyline and plot. And seeing it again - for the first time in perhaps 30 years - it certainly lived up to my memory. Although it is nothing more than your standard ""Late 1950's Sci-Fi 'B' Movie"", it does present some unique approaches to the genre in terms of the abilities of the monsters, the subject matter, and the mild gore that starts almost at the beginning of the film...

My only real complaint is not with the movie itself; rather, it is the LOUSY print that was used as the master for this VHS version. Exceptionally poor contrast, brightness levels and sound carryover make this VHS edition an utter dissapointment. The first 4 or 5 minutes of the film are almost unwatchable, with a sound level that sounds like you are wearing earmuffs! Thereafter, the video quality looks fuzzy and dull; the audio, limited in its volume to noise ratio and range. At first, I thought that either I had gotten a 'bad' tape, or that my S-VHS unit was 'on the fritz'; ultimately, it is just a really poor printing of the film. It is comparable to those pirated films you can buy on a streetcorner - you know, the ones where some shady character sneaks a video camera into a theater and just aims at the screen and shoots the movie ""live""? An hours worth of tweaking the video settings on my big-screen and attempts at equalizing and filtering the audio did little to improve the viewing experience...

Oddly enough, the packaging is first rate; the video sleeve images are crisp and the print is clear and legible.

All in all, I give 2 stars simply because the movie is worth a see for any Sci-Fi buff. If the master print were better, I could see a 4 - star rating for this product. Hopefully, if a DVD edition ever becomes available, the distributor would do well to hunt down a decent quality master print of the film first.",1163030400,3,1910,4.482758620689655
941800,5,6304963084,"This sci-fi movie is in black & white which adds to the forbidding mood of the plot. The cast of characters in this movie do a creditable job of heighting the suspense. While the notion of giant land crabs plotting the overthrow of humanity is a bit far fetched. The premise that these giant mutant crabs can gain knowledge by eating the brains of scientists and blowing up the Island bit by bit with stolen explosives thereby cornering the remaining survivors is entertaining.

Any way the movie: I grew up when the Aleins series was out. I was scared of that. This scared me more than that. It was extermly creepy. (Watching it alone in the dark did not help) This crab when exposed to radition, grows big with a hunger to boot. Nothing like that tang of human flesh. But it get worse. You know you are what you eat? The same is true for this guy. This monstor has access to the thoughts of all his victims. And he used mental thought patterns to ""call"" his next victim. Only it uses the voices is of past victims. Way beyond scary. I get the willies just writing the review! Like a sick to your stomach scary!

941804,4,6304963084,"Another Roger Corman classic staring monsters from the deep.  This time we have a research team investigating an island for effects of radiation.  We all know that radiation in a black and white film creates monsters.  This time is no exception.
In typical Corman fashion, the plot is established and the terror begins and at first we only see the handywork of the monsters and not the monsters themselves.  As quakes wrack the island, causing large sections to disappear, and scientists disappear, we become aware that there are some nast giant crabs on the island.  They have been eating the scientists and causing the island to sink.  If that wasn't enough, they have absorbed the knowledge, and voices, of those they have eaten.
The film climaxes with the final battle between the survivors and the crabs on all that remains of the island (about 10 yards across).
This is the type of movie that makes B-movies so much fun.  Monsters, suspense, bad effects, melodrama and sinking islands.  Great film.",1051574400,10,1004,4.899408284023669
941805,4,6304963084,"If you see only one talking crab monster movie in your life then this 1957 bad B-movie from director Roger Corman is the one to check out.  The monsters are stupid looking, the dialog is laughable, but just keep in mind the film's tagline--""From the depths of the sea... a tidal wave of terror!""--and enjoy the film.  The idea is that some scientist types are off to a Pacific island to study the effects of atomic radiation (they are bad; worse than you can imagine).  What they discover are a pair of giant crabs who (wait until you hear this) ate the previous group of scientists, thereby absorbing their knowledge and allowing them to imitate the voices of their human victims so they can get more people to munch on.  Just to make things fair the humans have guns and grenades, but they are trapped on the island when their plane explodes and bad weather stops their radios from working.  Oh, and did I mention that the island is slowly sinking into the sea?
Of course the scientists are mostly menu items, which leaves it to our hero, Hank (Russell ""The Professor"" Johnson), who proudly declares ""I'm no scientist, I'm a technician and a handy man.""  Well, those are the people who made this country and most monster movies great.  The human voices from the crabs are rather lame, but the clicking sound they make with their pinchers has its moments.  This is a nice example of an early Corman quick and dirty production, the second of nine films the director made that year: ""Not of This Earth,"" ""Naked Paradise,"" ""Teenage Doll,"" ""The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent,"" ""The Undead,"" ""Sorority Girl,"" ""Rock All Night,"" and ""Carnival Rock.""  But none of those have fake looking talking crabs rolling around on wheels on a sinking island talking with the voices of the human beings they consumed.  Look for screenwriter Charles B. Griffith as Tate and keep in mind that actors Beach Dickerson (Ron Fellows) and Ed Nelson (Ensign Quinlan) are doing double-duty as the operators of the crab monsters.  ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" definitely goes in the so bad it is good category.  In fact, this one might become your textbook definition of bad Science Fiction B-Movie.  It is a two-star movie but a four-star experience.",1046476800,16,2274,4.697732997481109
941875,2,6304963084,"The other reviews you will read about this unfortunate edition are all too true, and expose a basic problem with the releasing studio. Psychotronic films such as this often mean the difference between a studio making and losing money. The profits they engender help a studio make prestige films; in the case of Allied Artists, its Monogram subsidy frequently financed films such as ""Friendly Persuasion."" Yet, when it comes time to release these much-loved B's on video and DVD, we manage to get the worst prints for the highest prices. The murkiness and darkness of the print is worthy of the kind shown on a shoestring UHF station. It's almost as if they are thinking since horror/sci-fi fans will watch films like these, they are missing a few brain parts and will settle for anything, no matter what the quality. They wouldn't dare do that with a ""Cabaret,"" so why do it here?
And the real shame in this case is that ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" was Roger Corman at his absolute best. Done way before the French declared him a genius, thus ruining his product, The picture is a combination of weird acting and papier mache monsters, with an almost incomprehensible plot to drive the action. A group of scientists arrives at a desolate Pacific island, only to find the group that preceeded them is missing. As the action unfold we discover that a bunch of ordinary crabs has been enlarged by radiation and are intent on destroying the island. (Why, we don't know.) Worse, they like us for dinner as well as we like them, but they also have the ability to ingest the intelligence of those on whom they munch. After a war of survival, humanity wins when Russell Johnson (the Professor from ""Gilligan's Island) sacrifices himself to save the hero and heroine and make the world once again safe for seafood. From watching the movie it is obvious the crabs go best with cheese and that if it happened today, humanity would have nothing to worry about because the monsters would end up as ""Giant Crab Battle"" on the ""Iron Chef"" show.

I remember having a friend over for the evening,  watching our old B&W tv, and throwing a blanket over the monitor and  ourselves -- we were in a drive-in *grin*. Shows like this were what we  watched.
This film is a great 'time trip' back to those early days of  monster movies when atom bomb testing (did we really detonate those things  above ground?) was the cause for every mutation or monster loosed on  humanity. As a young boy, it had scared me -- the voices in the night and  an island which kept getting smaller gave me dreams. Of course, today's  film crowd would hoot at it. But it's not the cinematography, special  effects or even the story that makes this flick one worth adding to your  library. It's the wistful return to our youth that gives it charm.
If you  were born after 1970, you'll probably not have much in common with this  film -- bypass it. However, if you grew up watching 'Chiller Theater' and  'Movie of the Week', this film will transport you back in time to the less  complex world of our childhood.",960595200,32,1195,4.472222222222222

When the scientists mysteriously disappear, a second expedition is sent out to look for them.  What they find is not quite what they expected. They find a crabby enemy that can absorb the memories of those they eat. This is an absorbing movie.  Will they survive or will the crabs feast on people legs. The real question is who are the smarter?

This is truly a Roger Corman movie. Russell Johnson makes a habit of being stranded on islands (the Professor in ""Gilligan's Island) and the monsters are quite cute.  I wonder if the crab monsters prefer Alaskan Kings and that is why Alaska only has governors. They have a strange diet of brains and radio tubes.  The consumed people, become part of the crab, like what happened with the plant in ""Little Shop of Horrors""
