3417659,3,B0018LX9ZI,"Impressive DVD, but not as good as Stargaze (the best) and Stargaze II. The commentary on Stargaze provides the viewer excellent info on size, location, and distance from earth/our solar system;  the ""location feature"" of Stargaze II provides the same excellent info(BUT, without commentary).  I WOULD LOVE TO SEE ""A STARGAZE III DVD (WITH LATEST VIEWS & COMMENTARY) OF THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE'S ""VIEWS/DISCOVERIES"" SUBSEQUENT TO STARGAZE & STARGAZE II DVDS.",1225238400,14,461,5.47887323943662

3417661,5,B0018LX9ZI,"Beautiful images from our space observatories combined with the perfect music from 2002.  Images are awesome from our 71"" screen.

Can't wait for Stargaze II HD.",1219968000,3,161,5.153846153846154
3417662,4,B0018LX9ZI,"Overall, the quality is outstanding. The images are fantastic and the clarity is as good as I've ever seen. The sound quality is top notch even though I find it a little boring. But, there's nothing to stop you from listening to something else while viewing some of the most incredible sights the universe has to offer (like Pink Floyd's Dark side of the Moon :).

This isn't something I'd want to watch very often, but when you want to relax and just contemplate your place in the universe and the reality around you - this is the ticket!",1219449600,14,539,4.444444444444445
3417663,4,B0018LX9ZI,"Stargaze HD looks to offer stunning views of outer space.  While it is true these are only still images which are panned around and accompanied by music, the images are very captivating in nature and the panning motion is enough to keep the program interesting and moving along.

Unlike most of HDScape's other titles, Stargaze HD looks virtually free of compression artifacts.  Some of the HDScape titles look very rough with obvious macroblocking, but this title gets the job done.

Recommended for fans of space! :)",1218844800,13,518,4.988372093023256

HDScape has outdone theirselves. This Blu-Ray is amazing. They have all 3 space telescopes in this,the Hubble,Chaundra X-Ray and Spitzer. It is not a slide show. The images are in motion. They have chosen some of the best Nebula's,Galaxy's and even a few of Hubble ultra deep imaging shots. They do show several of the same but all are not the same,obviously. I think the fact at the end they go into each shot and credit the telescope,the observer and number of system. It is way more special than I had thought when I pre-ordered it.
A MUST BUY!",1217721600,25,740,5.91588785046729
3417665,5,B0018LX9ZI,"I now think I may be somewhat of an expert on the Cosmos.(smile) Good old Carl Sagan.
 I have over a dozen DVD's Dealing with imagery and information of the universe.
Including:
""StarLight,
StarGaze,
Runaway Universe,
Hubble 15 years of Discovery""
 And many more.
All are interesting... However If you want to put your HD system to the test, This is the One to own!
The quality is second to none
Slow zooming and panning movements of the most Awe Inspiring images I have ever seen.
Some of the Nebula look to have depth. Almost 3-D without the glasses. Wow!
The name of what appears on screen is projected in the lower right of the picture.
 The name fades in and out in about 4 or 5 seconds.
 It is not a distraction from the mind blowing beauty that nature has made.
The program will also repeat the images, on its own, without you hitting play on the remote....
 How cool is that!
The music is ambient and perfect.
 However I just watched it with:
""Gastiv Holst, The Planets""
In the back ground... and I must say you should try it.
Or choose your own.
Make your LCD HD a lovely changing picture of... Well you just gotta see this..
I hope this saves you some time and money.
If you gotta own one, Get this one.

3417666,5,B0018LX9ZI,"As a teenager my parents headed north out of the city for the weekends. Away from the influence of the bright lights from the city my friends and I would sit on the beach on a Saturday night and stare into space wondering where it ended. The beauty of millions of bright stars spread across the dark night sky with the Northern Lights was an amazing conversation piece. Man later visited the moon and sent research probes to other planets oh so far away. These pictures of deep space provided by one of mans conquests, Hubble, put into perspective how really insignificant we are. The true vastness of outer space is shown here with all its majesty, size and color. A must see video to show every man and woman on earth what we have to explore. We create wars and terrorism on earth when we should be putting our energies into traveling to true far off places. This video shows us just how many places we have yet to discover. Sit back, relax and dream of what is out there for us to discover.",1272844800,5,993,4.372972972972973
3417667,5,B0018LX9ZI,"This was an unexpectedly great purchase.  There weren't many reviews but I took a chance and highly recommend this blu-ray.  Along with Home, this is one of my clearest blu-ray movies.  Every song track is excellent, except for one up-tempo track that doesn't fit with the relaxing space theme.  The movie is 1080p and has some unbelievable photos of space.",1270512000,,357,4.9
3417668,4,B0018LX9ZI,"This looks great on my 1080p.  Would be cool to have some feature showing some stats of the pics presented, I didn't see that there was a way but didn't investigate much.  Still, my daughter and I sat there with our mouths open in amazement of the vastness and beauty of God's universe.  Cool.",1263945600,,293,4.388888888888889
3417669,1,B0018LX9ZI,"It is very disappointing that it is just a dvd with photographs. Although the pictures are nice, I can find those in my books. If I would have know I certainly would not have bought this dvd. Waste of money.",1263427200,7,207,4.2
3417670,5,B0018LX9ZI,"This is a really great mega hi-res 1080P of stars and far away galaxy's from three major telescopes like the hubble and an X-Ray telescope and the keck.
Has to be viewed in my opinion in 1080P not 1080I for stellar viewing. The music in the background is not too good so I play another CD when viewing it.
Over 60min which in HD land is rare! Enjoy this odd collection as its worth it for sure.

My grade = A+",1260057600,,409,4.049382716049383
3417671,3,B0018LX9ZI,"This blu-ray was kinda cool but if you want to look at pictures of stars, just go on the internet and look at hubble pics or somethin.

3417672,3,B0018LX9ZI,"Maybe I was expecting too much. But then I'm not an astronomy buff.

Each slide gives the name of the object, but no other information. You need to go to the last chapter for that information. So to me this just seems to be a random selection of images in no particular order.

It needs a better menu system. The chapters aren't labeled, there's just a sample picture for each choice. Maybe it would mean something to someone more knowledgeable than me. I don't know if they're grouped by type of object or by source of the image. Also I have no idea how to find what does interest me.

I was hoping for the Hubble Deep Space image. Maybe it's on here, but I don't know.",1235347200,5,670,4.25984251968504
3417673,4,B0018LX9ZI,"Stargaze HD heralds itself as nothing more than telescopic images of stars, galaxies, space dust, and color, and for that, I say it is brilliant.  I recommend turning the volume down to zero (the only negative is the soundtrack) and allowing this disc to serve as relief from the garbage that you would otherwise be watching on television.  If you have a wall-mounted hdtv and can adjust the height, move the screen as close to the ceiling as possible, so as to imitate more closely the real sky you could walk outside and see for yourself.  I suggest making some pompous snacks (fois gras, chorizo and cheddar crackers, or a delicate dish of calamari appetizers), inviting your elitist friends over for a wine tasting and chamber music party, and top the ordeal off with a small, but clean impromptu orgy.  While your friends or constituents pleasure themselves and others they can gaze into the universe from the privacy of your living room.  You are no doubt the life of the party now, you old dog you!

8269990,4,B0018LX9ZI,"The images in this Blu Ray are breathtaking.  I watch and read a lot of material on astronomy so I have seen a lot of images from deep space.  Given that, I was (and still am) amazed at the detail and color of these images.

My concern when I was considering purchasing this was how the movement of the camera would look on still images.  I can tell you that they did a super job panning/zooming at just the right speed to give an effect comparable to a fly-by tour.  And I can't stress enough that the colors are simply awesome, especially in HD.

A suggested improvement would be to add facts and figures in the subtitles about the galaxy/nebula/etc being shown.  Currently you get the offical name (example: Galaxy 2356) and that is all.  Distance from Earth, size, age or similar information would only add to the value of this Blu Ray.

The music isn't the best, but not bad enough a person can't listen to it.  If it bothers you turn on the stereo and turn down the TV volume.  We watch this with the sleep timer set on the TV, as we are going to bed.  The music is suitable for falling asleep to.",1312761600,3,1103,4.27536231884058

No explination of what you are looking at other than a small typed title at the bottom which disappears after about 10 seconds.  My son kept asking me ""What's that?"" and I couldn't explain anything to him.  Boy, was I was expecting MUCH higher video quality!  It looked like I had put a VHS tape in to watch.  I guess it was because this was a video of photographs.  I wish I would have bought the HUBBLE IMAX movie insted!",1306454400,3,527,4.381443298969073
