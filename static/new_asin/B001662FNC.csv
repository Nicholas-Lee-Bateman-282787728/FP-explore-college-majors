8261006,5,B001662FNC,"I remember being part of years-long petition to get the japanese Season 2 released in other languages. It was a rewarding day finally being able to purchase this DVD set. I'll cherish it forever, it is part of my childhood and a great show for kids. I actually first saw it aired when I was 14, which goes to show you never to judge a book by it's cover. There is drama, and death, and comedy, a very classic shounen tale.",1388707200,,422,4.222222222222222
8261007,5,B001662FNC,"I really like the new SD Gundam a lot I wish that they had done a movie to DVD as well as the new 26 shows as well that would have been nice too I do hope that they will do more shows of SD Gundam soon.

8261008,3,B001662FNC,"This box set has the second season of SD Gundam Force, which didn't air in the US.  It extends the storyline of the first season as the main characters go to the alternate worlds where some of the Gundams came from to free them from the Dark Axis as they did Neotopia.

My grandkids enjoyed the first set, and I hope this pleases them as well.  Don't expect deep or dramatic storylines here, this series was targeted for the grade-school set, and succeeds as such.",1212624000,3,464,4.435294117647059
