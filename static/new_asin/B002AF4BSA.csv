8359357,3,B002AF4BSA,it did not say it was in a different region when i had bought it. because of this it couldn't play in my region. i sent it back directly after receiving it. though the DVDs themselves seemed in perfect condition and it came in on time. i changed the region on my laptop to watch the DVDs anyways and they played perfectly. if it weren't for the wrong region i would have kept and chareshed it.,1419811200,3,393,4.184210526315789
8359358,1,B002AF4BSA,I received today the Death Note box set and I am really disappointed with what I've found. The cover was ruined (I don't know if this happened because there weren't any safety measurements tool when it was shipped - like an anti-shock plastic wrap or because the product was damaged in the first place) and there was no illustrated book inside as it appears in the product's photo and description. And the worst part is that this was supposed to be a birthday present for someone that is waiting it for three weeks...,1337126400,13,517,4.56989247311828
