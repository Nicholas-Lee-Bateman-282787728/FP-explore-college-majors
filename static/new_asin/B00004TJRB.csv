7922902,5,B00004TJRB,"I am very happy to have finally picked up this disc. To get to hear David Cronenberg himself speak in detail about his films, his actors and his experiences of making the films is not superficial by any means - but quite fascinating. To get to hear nine actors from his films speak about their experiences of working with Cronenberg is really the icing on the cake. Who cares if the image quality of some of the film clips is crappy (what, maybe three out of the thirteen films?) - I didn't buy the disc to catch glimpses of Cronenberg films. (Besides, if you are buying this disc then you probably already own all of the available DVD or Laser Disc versions anyway...) The picture quality of all of the interview footage is excellent and the transfer to DVD is clean and sharp. If you have an interest in making of Cronenberg films, I would suggest seeking out the Canadian DVD version of eXistenZ (a region one disc) because it has an incredible documentary called ""The Invisible Art of Production Designer Carol Spier"" - that also features extensive interviews with Cronenberg himself and is absolutely fantastic. And if you can read French, then check out the recent interview book published by Cahiers Du Cinema in 2000 - another fabulous resource about the films and life of David Cronenberg.",1011398400,6,1298,4.697368421052632
7922903,1,B00004TJRB,"Now that I have viewed the entire program, I felt compelled to follow up my original review by stating that the technical standards of this disc are ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!  Terrible tracking lines, shimmering, grainy video -  everything about it is terrible.  Film clips look as if they were taken from a second generation bootleg dub.  Content aside, the quality is terrible.  Fox Lorber has always been a poor quality company, releasing classic films with bad transfers and no extras, and this is just like them.",970185600,9,509,4.9411764705882355
