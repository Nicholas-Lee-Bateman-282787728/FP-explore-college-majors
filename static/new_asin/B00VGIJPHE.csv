7089378,4,B00VGIJPHE,"From 2006 to 2014, an ""Icon"" of professional wrestling came to TNA Wrestling full time to make an ""Impact"" which he did from having dream matches with other big names in this sport to reliving classic feuds from his past to facing off against the new generation of stars who grew up watching him in the ring to being the first member of their own Hall Of Fame...this is STING!  This is the second DVD set put out by TNA on Sting since their very first one during Sting's first year with the company (""Return Of An Icon"") close to a decade ago as it's strictly a one disc match anthology.

Matches Include:
w/Christian Cage vs. Jeff Jarrett & Monty Brown - This was Sting's debut in the Impact Zone & his full-time TNA debut with getting one of the loudest ovations in TNA at that time. Christian started out against both men briefly before tagging in Sting who got the chants of ""You Still Got It!"" after his first series of offensive moves against Jarrett while Christian payed a tribute to Sting delivering Stinger Splashes onto both Jarrett & Brown. Jarrett had to resort to dirty tactics in order to gain the advantage from a low blow to both Brown & Gail Kim working on Christian on the floor when the referee wasn't looking. Christian was separated from Sting building up to the hot tag which Sting eventually got clearing house leading to Team Canada getting involved but it still wasn't enough for Sting to be triumphant in his return match & getting his moment.
Final Resolution '06
[Sting: Return Of An Icon]

vs. NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett with special guest enforcer Kurt Angle - Sting must win the NWA Championship or end his career as he debuted a new look here which was a hybrid of his early ""surfer"" face paint with his ""crow"" look while wearing the same ring jacket he did for his match against Ric Flair at the first Clash Of The Champions. Jarrett took control early out wrestling Sting by constantly taking him off his feet & even out of the ring to the floor before Sting was able to rebound taking it right back to the floor throwing each other into guardrails & brawling along ringside up to the ramp with having different types of confrontations with Angle, who also got physical with the referee on more than one occasion, as the match settled back into the ring with both men trading momentum hitting some impactful moves along with one out of Angle's own playbook in what was an great match.
Bound For Glory '06
[Jeff Jarrett: King Of The Mountain]

vs. TNA Champion Kurt Angle - This edition of Bound For Glory took place in Atlanta which had sentimental value to both men as Sting worked for WCW based in that city for over a decade while Kurt Angle also won his Olympic gold medal there. Both men were working over the same area of the body along with different types of takedowns & takeovers as they started to get more physical taking the other over the top to brawl around ringside with whatever got in their way as Angle relied on a heavy amount of different suplexes & some aerial offense including one move I don't recall seeing from him before while Sting beat on the chest & back area as they traded submissions as others who had a vested interest in the match also made their presence known in what was a competitive match.
Bound For Glory '07
[Kurt Angle: Champion; Best Of 2007]

TNA Championship/Six Sides Of Steel Match vs. Mick Foley - Before the match, there was a change to the rules in that you could also win this match by escaping the cage but only climbing over the cage & dropping to the floor as the cage door was locked. Foley came as his Cactus Jack persona and busted himself open before the match got started. They told a good story here as Sting hurt Cactus' leg early on to the point where Mick had problems climbing out of the cage so his decision to have the cage door locked backfired so he tried different ways of escaping the cage...including trying to squeeze himself through one of the camera holes in the cage. It wasn't a blow-away match but you can tell both men tried their hardest here as it was the best Sting match probably since Bound For Glory while Foley heavily made up for his lackluster performance at Genesis months earlier telling a good story in the process.
LockDown '09
[Mick Foley: Hardcore Legend]

vs. TNA Champion Jeff Hardy - Sting came into this match with more motivation & aggression than we've seen from him in over a year as he was in control from the very start & even caught Jeff in the scorpion deathlock early causing Hardy to favor his leg. Jeff was overwhelmed & he tried to walk away only for Sting to catch him & suplex him on the ramp. Hardy caught a break when Sting missed a stinger splash on the outside railing but that didn't stop Sting as he delivered three separate Scorpion Deathdrops (including one with Hardy hanging from the top rope) to dominate his way to another TNA Championship reign.
""Impact"" Mar. '11
[Immortal Forever; Enigma: Best Of Jeff Hardy 2]

TNA Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. Mr. Anderson vs Rob Van Dam - Due to Anderson's attitude towards both men leading up to & at the start this match, he was the ""odd man out"" as both Sting & RVD took turns beating him up. This had some good moments between all three men such as Sting applying a double scorpion deathlock to both men, Anderson's double mic check, and Sting doing a scorpion deathdrop on RVD while having a double clothesline with Anderson. The bigger story here was the appearance of Hulk Hogan with a pipe trying to help RVD win the championship thinking he was going to join Immortal only for RVD to say make his decision, Mr. Anderson trying to take advantage of the situation, and Sting being able to retain his title. The match was decent & had some nice moments but it was more about the story with Hogan & ""what would RVD do?"" than anything else.
LockDown '11

vs. Ric Flair - This was their first match since the final ""WCW Nitro"" over a decade earlier as Sting had to go through Flair to get his match against Hogan or retire. Both men felt each other out early trying to work over the same area of the body & taking it to the mat with the match eventually making its way to the floor before Flair resorted to his ""dirtiest player in the game"" tactics while working over the leg while Sting was able to catch Flair & even get some unlikely help when it came to Immortal coming down to ringside in a match where you saw the best possible from these two considering this stage of their career.
""Impact"" Sept. '11

vs. Hulk Hogan - This match was for control of TNA as Hogan came out in his street clothes as he made it clear that he wasn't going to wrestle but instead fight Sting while Sting came out in his gear wearing a red & yellow ""Hulkamania"" shirt. Dixie Carter was sitting in the front row while Hogan revealed that Ric Flair was going to be in his corner with the special twist being that the referee was ""Jackson James"" who was revealed earlier in the night to be Eric Bischoff's son Garrett. Hogan kept overpowering Sting early while Flair got his shots in the floor whenever possible including both men hitting low blows on Sting. Hogan used a weapon given to him by Flair to bust Sting open before Sting was able to fight off both men & use the weapon to make Hogan bleed before delivering Stinger Splashes to Hogan's bad back followed by the Scorpion Deathlock. The aftermath here was the real story as we saw Immortal come out, the battle of the Bischoff's, and the REAL Hulk Hogan return. The match was what you would expect knowing Hogan's condition but what happened with Hogan afterwords was suppose to come off as ""he saw the light"" but just the way it happened came off very flat.
Bound For Glory '11

Also included are highlights of Stings TNA Hall of Fame Induction (the ceremony wasn't shown in full). It's obvious to me (and other reviewers/critics) that TNA decided to put this set out trying to capitalize on the recent fame Sting has gained for himself by finally working with WWE as TNA never released a set on Sting outside the one they did showcasing his first few months in the company almost a decade ago while also trying to use the appeal of other superstars who established their names outside of TNA in favor of the then-homegrown talent based off the matches selected which ultimately I feel hurt this project because some Sting had better quality performances against men like A.J. Styles, Samoa Joe, Bobby Roode, and to a lower extent Bully Ray than some of the selected matches on here. No different than the WWE release under this same title, I can't say this was the ""Best Of Sting"" but a nice collection or matches that I would recommend if you don't have a majority of these matches elsewhere.",1428278400,,8737,4.475533249686324
7089379,4,B00VGIJPHE,"This is a brand new ""Best of Sting"" DVD for TNA. This is clearly TNA capitalizing off Sting's success in WWE but I have to say this DVD is much better than WWE's Best of Sting video.

This is a one-disc set, 3 hours, this is a great match list for the Best of Sting. Sadly there are no interviews or any extras. Plus most of these matches are repeated on many other TNA DVDs, so if you own a lot of them you may not find much interest in this. But if you don't own too many of these matches or want to see great Sting matches in TNA then get this DVD.",1428105600,6,905,3.967032967032967
8710030,5,B00VGIJPHE,Good dvd,1486684800,,8,3.5
8710031,5,B00VGIJPHE,Great dvd.,1444089600,,10,4.5
8710032,3,B00VGIJPHE,"As other people have pointed out, they left out some of Sting's actual best matches (e.g. vs. AJ Styles at Bound for Glory). If you think about it, it's actually kind of sad that ""the best"" of this legendary star's career apparently amounts to 8 matches, 2 of which we against men at least 55 years old. They also could have tried to incorporate some sort of narrative to his career, as they did with the (far superior) Sting - Return of an Icon. As it, it feels like just a series of unrelated matches.

If this sounds pretty negative, it's only because there's so much negative to say about the DVD. It's redeemed only in that the man Sting is one of the most charismatic and legendary performers of our time. If you love him as much as I do, you can overlook all the weaknesses and the lack of effort that went into this DVD. If you don't, you're better off looking elsewhere for your wrestling fix.",1433376000,2,902,4.337278106508876

8710034,5,B00VGIJPHE,I wish there would have been TNA skits where he spoke on the microphone from the Icon to the Insane Icon. This is a collection though of some incredible matches!

8710036,3,B00VGIJPHE,okay first off this was a good set of matches with sting. but if you're like me after watching CM Punk's best in the world DVD or Blu ray. you expect something to the quality of that DVD or Blu ray with anything else that you buy. now obviously this isn't a WWE production but TNA could have done a lot better first off the main menu doesn't seem to fit the picture of my television now my television is extremely up to date it seems as though the DVD's main menu is on widescreen. and yet it cannot be fixed also there is no type of commentary by Sting himself there is also no type of TNA superstar interviews on this DVD also. this basically comes up as someone recording a bunch of staying matches with the DVR if I can say that and putting them together on a DVD. Tna could have done better. but if you enjoyed sting in tna and don't care about the little stupid mistakes this DVD has made then I would definitely say its a buy.,1428796800,2,933,4.103825136612022
8710037,5,B00VGIJPHE,This DVD is good. I say good because it's Sting. And obviously I'm here for Sting. I will start with the cons of the DVD. The layout is not very professional in my opinion. It goes from one match to the next with no real commentary in between like in the three disc best of Sting set. It's just not as exciting as that set. But with that said the matches are good Sting looks incredible and his hall of fame induction is worth getting this DVD alone. I realize this DVD is now sold out and I ordered mine two days ago and got it today. So if you do find it and are a hardcore Sting fan like me I suggest having it for your collection. But I highly highly suggest the three disc best of Sting set. That gives you more insight into his career from start to finish at that time.,1428710400,,775,4.006451612903226
8710038,5,B00VGIJPHE,"If i liked WWE's 3 Disc DVD set about Sting And his best matches in WCW incluiding one from the UWF alongside the late Warrior when they were The Bladerunners; The TNA DVD about Sting is equally awesome! His matches against Jeff Jarrett, Kurt Angle, Mick Foley And Jeff Hardy are included in the DVD!",1428364800,2,300,4.472727272727273
8710039,5,B00VGIJPHE,"I am a hardcore fan of Sting loved him in WCW. When WCW ended I was sad that Sting would retire and not continue wrestling as he didn't want to go to the WWE where he thought he would be buried. I am sure he envisioned what happened to Booker T, Nash, Steiner and Goldberg and was not cool with going to WWE. Yet he did I don't know what changed his mind but he went to WWE and as a result TNA put out this DVD to make some extra money. It's a smart move but I think it's a treat for Sting fans considering how much Sting meant to TNA and what a great run he had there.  Before I get started here is the match listing

Hall of Fame Induction in 2012

  I agree with one of the reviewers this dvd was missing his matches against Joe, Styles, Roode and Bully Ray. Also included could be more matches with RVD and Mr. Anderson. I would have liked more matches and at least two disc dvd. But this is still a great dvd as it has most of high profile matches. I thought his match with Flair was special. It was nice to see those two go at it one more time. Ric should really stay retired for his health but they had a great match. I loved his match with Hulk Hogan though The Hulkster might not be in his prime he is always entertaining to watch and it was nice to see Sting score a clean win over Hulk. It may have not been the greatest match but a big victory for Sting in his career.

  The match Sting had against Kurt Angle is easily the best. They tore it up and Sting proved he still had it. It was another big victory for Sting and proved he was the face of the company as for the second year in a row he won the title at Bound For Glory. Of course there is also on the dvd Sting vs Jeff Jarrett from the first Bound For Glory Sting appeared at and won the title at. I thought it was a good match. I was really glad they included this match on the dvd along with the tag match from Final Resolution as I don't think Dixie and Jarrett are on the best of terms. It was a great long angle of Sting's return and feud with Jarrett it was awesome to see him finally beat him and know Sting was in TNA for the long run.

  The match with Jeff Hardy was good but brief. I think it was one of the more important wins in Sting's TNA career. I think as Jeff was having his personal problems they needed Sting to come in take the title and carry the ball for a while. His match with Mick Foley was good though I would have preferred Sting win that match. I still think it was confusing what TNA's plans were for Foley. He started out a commissioner type role than became a wrestler. Finally the triple threat match with RVD and Mr. Anderson. That was a great match but it leaves you wanting more as Sting had some other good matches with those two that year.

  You can say what you want about Sting's TNA Career it was best he picked them over WWE where he would not be buried and could be used in that Undertaker role put over some of the young talents and win some high profile title matches against Angle, Joe, Anderson and Hardy. We saw once he went to WWE he was buried. Triple H wouldn't give him his Wrestlemania moment beat him at Wrestlemania 31 though something should be said at Sting pulled off a great performance at 56. His final burial and injury to Seth Rollins was just a sad way for him to go out. But he had a great run in WCW as The Franchise there and in TNA he created an alternative of wrestling to watch. Sting was a big enough name to tune in viewers though they were never in real competition with WWE  he gave us a place to see Sting used well and where his character wouldn't be destroyed and buried like WWE did with Steiner, DDP, Booker T, Goldberg, Hall, Nash etc.

  All in all this is a great Sting dvd. Sting fans won't be disappointed. TNA fans won't be disappointed. The honest truth there could have been more added to the dvd but there was enough there to make it awesome. I recommend this to all wrestling fans including the ones that never saw Sting in TNA. Also pick up his first TNA dvd Sting Return Of An Icon one of my favorite wrestling dvds and a great Sting dvd!  Cheers and enjoy the dvd!",1428278400,2,4432,4.0445714285714285
