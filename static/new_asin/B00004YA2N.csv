8515196,5,B00004YA2N,"A British guy named Ian goes on a trip sampling various aspects of Mongolia. I had read about Mongolia and factually knew various things. With all the change you wonder how accurate what you you read is with the current reality. What's good is the movie doesn't just stroll past some monuments and a few wrestlers at Naadam, but even the plug in the sink in the bathroom on a train. The shooting AND EATING by Ian of the marmot was absolutely shocking. He trades currency in a dumpy area that looks worse than a flea market. The UB Post woman brought an element of sanity to the whole scene. You think, she's been living there (a year), it can't be all that bad. Ian keeps a sense of humor, which really helps the otherwise stark scenery. I mean the ever whispy clouds in the sky and rolling hillside look great if you were just plopped down there, but you almost get tired imagining the mudholes or obstacles encountered just to get there--way out there. As a cyclist I liked the bike touring couple interviewed briefly. Seeing the real drivers and the reality shots was really what I wanted to see. Actually what I mean is who wants to see just the government buildings and maybe Naadam. That does not really reveal much--some, but the reality shots. Having not been there, they could go further, like walk in a market and see what they're selling, like especially food and clothing. I mean, what is available. How much Western goods are actually available to Mongolians, or that even some can afford? If you're interested in modern UB, it's an entertaining shot of reality.",998092800,,1576,4.592198581560283

Ian begins in Bejing and travels by train to Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia (the capitol and also referred to as UB).  Ian experienes what UB is like now, after the pull out of the Soviet Union.  He then travels to  Karakorum where Ghengis Khan ruled in the 13th century.  Somewher out on the plains, Ian experiences Mongolian throat singing and he eats Marmot (still known to carry the Bubonic plague).  From there, Ian heads for the Gobi desert and then hops a plane back to UB.  An amazing journey.
Also note that the VHS tapes of Lonely Planet episodes contain a couple more minutes of footage than the episodes that air on television.",974073600,7,705,4.691056910569106
