2697800,4,B000KX0HFK,"I had a little trouble in elucidating this story, but was drawn in despite this. I found myself backing up a few times to try and sort out who was related to whom and how. Insurance agent Abe Holt (played by the talented Forest Whitaker) is an ace in finding a way to get out of paying death benefits and other insurance claims. Has he met his match when a sinister young man makes a car crash look like an accident? Abe is suspicious, but he's the only one in town who thinks the burnt body isn't Calvin, or that the wreck was staged. Uncovering the facts may get Abe in deeper than he'd ever intended. This is a good thriller that is a challenge to figure out.

2697801,3,B000KX0HFK,"While I didn't hate this film, I didn't really love it either.  It had an interesting plot, although sometimes it seemed hard to follow.  I did think that Forrest Whitaker and Julia Stiles did good work in this film, but for some reason the plot never really got off the ground and the final resolution just defied belief and not just because of where Whitaker's character ended up.  The wrap up was definately NOT in line with the psychological make up of the husband.  He would not have done that. No how.  No way.  It wasn't in him.  And Abe (Whitaker) - Maybe think of something unusual like, oh I don't know, how about calling the police when it involves a police matter.  Despite the flaws though, I thought it was pretty well acted and a pretty interesting piece of work.  This was not one of the best films I have ever seen, but if you like kind of off-beat, atmospheric movies this might be to your taste.  Definately worth a try if you have a hard time picking out a rental",1176595200,7,983,4.351648351648351
2697802,3,B000KX0HFK,"A LITTLE TRIP TO HEAVEN  is a strange little Indie film by Icelandic director Baltasar Kormkur, a young director with some very fine ideas but with a script (written both by the director and Edward Martin Weinman) 'that is so spongy that the impact of the film relies on the considerable qualities of the cinematic images.  Filmed primarily in Iceland with some scenes in Hastings, Minnesota, the mood is dank and dark and cold - and so is the story.

We first meet insurance investigator ('adjustor') Abe Holt as he listens to his boss Frank (Peter Coyote) explain to a new widow why she will not receive full death benefits because the insurance company took photos of her husband smoking, the apparent cause of his death. Abe just sits in the background but we know he is in tune with the fraudulent activity of the insurance company.  Almost immediately he is assigned to a new case: an ex-con with a million dollar life insurance policy has apparently been found dead in a car crash burned beyond recognition.  Abe drives to the tiny snowy desolate village where his questions of the townsfolk reveal that the victim was Kelvin Anderson, the brother of Isold (Julia Stiles) who is married to a low life type named Fred (Jeremy Renner), a man who we have seen in flashbacks as the one responsible for arranging the car crash and setting the car on fire. Abe sneaks around the town, spies on Isold, and becomes involved in the investigation in more ways than the honest one.  It is the interplay of the three - Abe, Fred, and Isold - that provide the intrigue and mystery of the apparent framed insurance scam.

The screenplay is so full of holes that it is difficult to follow the case's development.  The actors are superb artists: Forest Whitaker made this film almost simultaneously with his Oscar winning 'The Last King of Scotland' yet here his character is plagued by an affected accent and by the lack of substance that might make us care about his plight; Julia Stiles does her best with the little she is given to do and Jeremy Renner is convincingly menacing without any factors that make us find him worth caring about. The supporting actors (Joanna Scanlan as a sleazy bartender, Iddo Goldberg and Philip Jackson as the police, Alfred Harmsworth as the 'son' of Isold, and Vladas Bagdonas as the coroner) actually fare better than the leads as far as material available.

The strong aspect of the film is the visual imagery, due to the decisions of picture composition by Kormkur and cinematographer ttar Gunason and  Mugison's musical is apropos for the mood.  But the film remains grounded and a bit on the confusing side because of  the director's lack of unity. One wonders why Whitaker, Stiles, and Renner signed on to this little film.

2697803,4,B000KX0HFK,"This is a somewhat unusual and very interesting crime drama film. Forest Whitaker, Jeremy Renner, and Julia Stiles are very fine. The widescreen picture is of high quality and enhanced for 16:9 TVs.",1318809600,,198,5.03030303030303
2697804,2,B000KX0HFK,"The most disappointing part with A Little Trip to Heaven is *easily* that it never improves past the car accident in the beginning of the movie.  When a mans car breaks down during a rainstorm, he's forced to pull to the side and get a ride from a stranger.  As soon as he gets inside the car, the driver apparently had a death wish and drove the car directly into the side of a bridge.  A *very* good segment that was!!  After that, you're probably expecting more excitement in the same style, but much to my surprise (and dismay) instead you get a VERY mediocre mystery drama.

Forest Whitaker plays the role of an investigator assigned to figure out the mysterious clues pertaining to this accident, however instead what happens is that Forest's character visits a family who has ties to the accident, and... the storyline settles into this groove of a slow-moving family and their fairly ordinary life and normal everyday problems.  Being an investigator, Forest sure didn't seem to be in any hurry to get the facts!

I love Forest's accent.  I suppose he was trying to imitate an Icelandic accent, but it ended up sounding more like a nerd who's late for geology class.

This movie is downright *boring*.  I don't know what else to say about it.  Eventually -without spoiling what exactly happens- we realize there's a scam taking place involving insurance, and the family (consisting of a man, woman and child) aren't what they appear to be.  Again, I can't spoil who they are and how they relate to the car accident in the beginning- all I can say is that it takes an eternity for the storyline to finally get to that point.  Seriously, you have to wait until at LEAST 70% of the way through to find out what's going on.

Overall, I refuse to recommend anyone see such a disappointing detective movie.",1313712000,,1808,4.609375
2697805,5,B000KX0HFK,"A great story about insurance fraud by a con-artist.  Whitaker plays a great Northern insurance adjuster, Renner plays a like-able while you get mad con-artist, Stiles plays a good 'victim who's in on the scam'. There are other amusing characters in this movie, too. I can say it was pretty riveting. I can watch this movie again (and I have) and still be in suspense.",1305936000,,368,4.661538461538462
2697806,4,B000KX0HFK,"Forest Whitaker is one of the most diverse, brave and fascinating actors we will ever see.
Unlike more famous, if not as popular actors like John Wayne, Mel Gibson and even one of my favorites, Clint Eastwood; no one in movies has played a greater variety of fascinatingly oddball and complex characters so well.
Even the ""Last King of Scotland"", for which Mr. Whitaker earned a long overdue Oscar, did not present the acting challenge this grim and complex little gem presented.
This is a morality tale that's high on great ensemble acting, deep and profound ethical and moral considerations. And Julia Stiles at the top of her considerable acting game. This movie will keep you engrossed from its surprising start to stunning finish.
Peter Coyote's brief but memorable performance reminds you of the Konstantin Stanislavsky (the inventor of the famous Stanislavsky Method) quote, ""There are no small parts, only small actors.""
I finally decide to get my own copy so I wouldn't be at the mercy of a cable movie schedule with no appreciation of what a fascinating little gem movie is.
Jeremy Renner finally got his Oscar for ""the Hurt Locker."" But he showed those acting chops way back when this movie debuted
One of these days, Julia Stiles and Peter Coyote will be similarly rewarded, I'm sure!",1297814400,,1296,4.8954545454545455

2697808,5,B000KX0HFK,"This is a beautiful little piece of noir that makes me think of some of the really great 1940s films.  We have a beautiful unappreciated woman, a dark controlling family member, an insurance investigator....  sound familiar?

 But tho the plot may resonate, this is a very original and beautifully done little film.  Of course, with such incredible acting talent, what would one expect?

 After a brief scene that introduces the insurance men to us, the film gives us a scene filled with a brutal murder and set up for an insurance scam.  As the insurance investigator comes to town to see if the one million dollar payout is justified, we meet people that may or may not be who they say they are.  And how perfectly this plays out for us.

 We especially enjoyed the little tribute to traditional noir films.  You know how sometimes we find the hero in a club with a beautiful chanteuse who may or may not be involved?  In this film, the club and the club employee are a bit more realistic.  We enjoyed the reference.

 I recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who enjoys good acting, thriller plotting, and an unexpected ending.",1283472000,,1142,4.663316582914573
2697809,3,B000KX0HFK,"This was an intriguing, although not satisfying,, movie and one I still felt was worth my few bucks I paid to rent it.

It was filmed in Iceland - one of the few films I've heard of with that locale - but the story in the film takes place somewhere in Midwestern America. I knew that going in, so it made it kind of strange to view, in that respect. However, the story seemed very realistic. In parts, it almost felt like a documentary, it was so real and atmospheric.

However, as much as I enjoyed the movie, and particularly Forest Whitaker with his odd accent, the ending was a big disappointment. The film had so much promise up until then. With a more satisfying ending, I would have bought the DVD and watched it several more times

Some people say this film had the feel of a Coen Brothers movie, and I agree with that. To some, this might also have been a bit slow or boring but I thought it had unique atmosphere to it.",1236988800,,929,4.237288135593221
2697810,5,B000KX0HFK,"Unlike some of the other reviewers I thought this was a great movie.  The scenery was beautiful, acting excellent and I can't believe the number of people who didn't understand the story.  It was fully revealed who the real Calvin was and in the end he tells his sister who actually died in the crash. It was revealed early on that he wasn't really her husband. As as for Frederick, look closely at the gravestone scene and the name on it.  The insurance agent may have been protecting the agency's interest in the beginning but how he breaks from that and what he does for Thor is shear martyrdom.  I highly recommend it but guess I must warn you to closely watch for all the clues.",1196985600,17,683,4.396825396825397
