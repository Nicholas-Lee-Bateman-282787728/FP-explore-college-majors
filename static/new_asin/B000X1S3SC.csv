8226549,5,B000X1S3SC,"Barbara Marx Hubbard may be the clearest, most loving visionary on the planet.  Without denying the chaos expressing in the world today, she sees it as part of an eternal upward evolution.  The visuals are both lovely and helpful.  Humanity Ascending is worth repeated viewings -- and you'll want the sequel, Visions of a New Humanity, as well.",1384387200,,344,4.896551724137931
8226550,5,B000X1S3SC,"Every time I watch this DVD, I just love it! The more I watch it, the more I learn and gain from it. Barbara Marx Hubbard's collection of thoughts presented in a unique fashion is easily understood as she takes us through history and the shifts we've encountered successfully. I find the material presented here uplifting and very positive!",1354665600,,340,4.779661016949152
8226551,2,B000X1S3SC,"I streamed this movie from it's main website. The movie was a simple idea, inflated to over an hour, with some pretty disturbing imagery. It was decently produced, but despite her seeming optimism, the structure of her presentation was a big turn off. I would not reccomend this product.",1341187200,,287,4.877551020408164
8226552,5,B000X1S3SC,"I love this DVD because it is full of hope and very well done. Barbara Marx Hubbard is an amazing human being, so knowledgeable and I have no doubt in my mind that this DVD will make history.",1305158400,,191,4.052631578947368
8226553,5,B000X1S3SC,A must see... Barbara Marx Hubbard should be read/seen along with Carl Calleman and Carlos Barrios for ANY information on 2012 and Humanity Ascending.,1277164800,2,150,5.291666666666667
8226554,5,B000X1S3SC,"Barbara Marx Hubbard does a beautiful job of conveying the message that humanity must ""Evolve or die."" Albeit this is a somewhat low-budget production, mankind's story is clearly conveyed with visuals that are memorable as well as beautifully appropriate for increased viewer understanding.

Most importantly, we need to wake up at the global level and pull together to end senseless war and the waste of the Earth's resources. Even if you do not consider this DVD a ""must watch,"" humanity's future depends on people realizing that this message is a ""must understand."" Our future depends on it.",1241654400,15,594,5.123711340206185
