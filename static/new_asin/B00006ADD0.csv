1735626,4,B00006ADD0,"Don't ask me why, but I watch this dvd over and over and over.  Something about Kenny Doughty's accent and the way he takes out his gum before he makes love in the car.  Tee hee!

Andie MacDowell is perfect in this older woman younger man romance.  The ending is truly tragic and sad and more than a little insipid.  But the story is full of magic and it is really too bad the writer did not find a way to memorialize that instead of turning it into a weeper.  The beginning and middle though is so beautiful, it makes up for a lot.  I love this dvd.  It always makes me happy for days...and it makes me look at men differently.",1038182400,6,628,4.090163934426229
1735627,3,B00006ADD0,"This quirky chick comedy tries to take itself seriously, then has second thoughts and reverses itself, losing all credibility in the process.  Kate (Andie MacDowell) is a forty-something headmistress of a private school.  She and her friends Janine (Imelda Staunton) and Molly (Anna Chancellor) spend much of their time drinking and telling ribald war stories about their exploits with men.  When Kate takes a tumble with twenty-something Jed (Kenny Doughty), their fling turns into a romance that turns a bit too serious for her friends' sensibilities.
Their plot to break up the lovers goes terribly wrong, creating a rift between Kate and her friends.  Serious melodrama ensues as the light hearted comedy becomes ponderously morose.  Then suddenly, inexplicably and incongruously everything is fine again and it is like nothing ever happened.  The story is cute in the beginning, but loses believability after it makes the first somber twist.  The melodrama is realistic, but the reconciliation is utterly implausible.
Andie MacDowell delivers an excellent performance.  She is light and breezy in the romantic parts and forcefully emotional in the dramatic scenes.  She conjures a believable character, but the script makes her look loopy because she makes so many obviously foolish choices.  Imelda Staunton steals the show with a droll presentation.  Staunton is unabashedly honest and blase as she delivers one outrageous zinger after the other.  Anna Chancellor is adorable as the police chief, and she looks like a little munchkin next to the towering Staunton and MacDowell, creating constant visual comedy by contrast.  Kenny Doughty is mostly window dressing, a Brad Pitt clone without many lines.  His entire job consists of being sexy and irreverent, which he accomplishes without much trouble.
This film is destined for a long run on Lifetime.  It will play a lot better with women than men.  Despite some good performances, the screenplay leaves one rolling one's eyes in disbelief.  I rated it 6/10.  Good for a girls' night out.",1033084800,,2047,5.284829721362229
1735628,4,B00006ADD0,"...what director John McKay has done in ""Crush,"" his first film, is to deliver a wickedly sly send-up of the typical chick-flick.
The friendship between the three female leads is so utterly ill and co-dependent, the way they treat their men and each other is so callous and destructive (up to and including virtual murder of one young lover and throwing up on the groom by his bride, right there at the altar, for crying out loud).  It's all here,
the disposable men, the latent lesbianism, the late-in-life discovery of the joys of sex, the jealousy of one girlfriend over her girlfriend's lover, the fatherless baby  who will be raised by the three ""loving"" girlfriends...and it is so over-the-top, it's AMAZING that no one seems to have noticed that this movie is PUTTING US ON.  If they made a move where three male friends did the things these three women do, to each other and the men in their lives, people would storm the box office and demand their money back...but because it's sweet Andy MacDowell, bonding with her middle-aged amigas, we CARE so much... It's Beaches on Exstacy, people, a brilliant satire on every chick-flick ever made!  And a classic example of how wit and talent just don't get their due.  Well, Mr. McKay...
I for one am ready for more.  You may just have the most subversive and subtle film sensibility since Mr. Hitchcock himself.  I, for one, get it!",1031270400,2,1386,4.702479338842975
1735629,5,B00006ADD0,"The first time I saw this movie was on British Airways on my way from London to Houston, it was such a nice movie, I usually hate long flights but this movie made my flight an agreable one.
It was really a very sad movie, very touching, I was very sad for Kate, character played by Andie MacDowell, it shows how friends when they try to over protect you, they ruin your life, the music is great and very emotive.
When I came home, I bought it because I needed a copy of that great piece of art.
The character is beautifully played by the inborn talented Andie MacDowell.
I strongly recommend you to buy this movie, you'll surely enjoy everything, the moral of the story, the music and all the other characters. It's also in a nice setting in England, very beautiful landscape. And prepare your handkerchief because you won't be able to hold your tears. Even guys will cry.",1030924800,5,872,4.422360248447205

Jed can captivate any woman. He is a very simple man, she is a very sophisticated woman. He is way below her social position. They fall inlove.
No, this is not a psychological movie, or one with an unclear end. It is a wonderful movie about love and about how much we should treasure it when  it happens.",1019520000,,516,4.0588235294117645

1735642,5,B00006ADD0,"I picked this up on a whim one day while living in England... I had never seen any of the previews so I had no expectations other than liking Andie MacDowell's work.

First, the scenery of this movie is absolutely gorgeous.  I can't remember the name of the town where they filmed, but if you watch the extras, they will tell you.

The acting is really good.  Like many movies, this one isn't perfect.  Some scenes seem implausible, and the twist in the movie is unexpected.  But I've read through some of the other reviews and I still think that the twist isn't a reason to write off the whole movie.  There are sad parts, and some people think that a sweet woman like MacDowell's character Kate would never be friends with the women in the film.  But in real life, how many of us have friends that seem really great but when you look closely you can see that they're selfish or arrogant?  I know I have.  And it isn't always a reason to cut them out of your life.  So I found that portion to be a good element to the story.  I found the character of Janine far less likely as a high-powered law enforcement officer who is intimidated by her friend.  But again, it wasn't a factor that spoiled the movie.

Overall, this may not be a warm fuzzy in which no matter what, everything is coming up roses at the end. But personally, those movies seem far less realistic.  There is great acting, beautiful backgrounds, and plenty of funny moments.",1333584000,,1441,4.384905660377359
1735643,4,B00006ADD0,"I fell in love with this movie because of the fine actors and the great story.  It's totally a chick flick.

1735644,1,B00006ADD0,"Kenny Doughty gives a movingly sweet performance, and this gay man instantly fell in love. For the first 70 minutes, this is a charming story about a 25-year old organist totally in love with a bubbly 40 year old woman. She has some unsavory 'best friends' who are bent on keeping Macdowell for themselves (particularly the nasty Sapphic gynecologist), and develop ever nastier ways to discredit her new love interest. When their poison finally taints her own feelings for him, she throws him out, and he gets killed in the dark by an oncoming truck. Instead of realizing what violence she has done to an innocent, angelic guy, she talks trash over wine for the final 40 minutes with these despicable vipers. Take the stupid girlie talk you find in 'Sex in the City' and make it 20 times stupider. Writer/director McKay needs to recall this film, and give it a proper ending, one in which the repulsive doctor gets her comeuppance, and where Macdowell repents for the gargantuan betrayal of a sweet young man who sought only to love her. Mr. McKay, how could you tear this promising work to pieces out of sheer boredom? Just despicable.",1327104000,,1136,4.742424242424242

Crush is special because it is like life - can be funny, tragic, dark, boring, etc.  I found all the characters totally believable Andy McDowall shows a depth and nuance in her acting that is superb,  Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton are outstanding as her (can't admit it to themselves) becoming bitter as they get older, friends.  Doughty is superb as Jed, the young man that Kate (McDowell) falls in love with - as another reviewer said, he was perfect in the part, played very subtly yet totally believable.  Kate is touched by Jeds soft side, playing music and seemingly much older than he is.  The magic of Jed is that he challenges them all, the women, their views, society's views and even men's views on women.  The twist the story causes each woman character to self confront to an extent that is life changing to each one.

1735648,4,B00006ADD0,"CRUSH is now a ten year old film written and directed by John McKay, a film that stands up well with the passage of time and the observations of feminine behavior.  It is blessed with a fine cast of actors and has the courage to take a comedic start and turn it into a tragic mode without destroying the main theme of the special friendship among a small group of women.

Kate Scales (Andie MacDowell) is a headmistress of a private school in a smallish English town and is close friends with policewoman Janine (Imelda Staunton) and physician Molly Cartwright (Anna Chancellor): each of the women is in the 40s range of age and each is single, their social life is meeting together for booze, smoking, and gossip and competing by putting themselves down for having the worst faux pas with men.  Kate encounters a young former student of hers, Jed Willis (Kenny Doughty) as he plays the organ for funerals.  There is a mutual attraction and soon they are having a frequent physical relationship.  Jed is sincerely in love with Kate but Kate feels the 20 some odd year difference in their ages in an insurmountable gap - though she is passionately attracted to Jeb. When Kate shares her 'affair' with Molly and Janine her friends are appalled and set out to destroy a relationship they feel is completely wrong and doomed to failure.  Molly and Janine take extreme measures to see to it that the couple is broken up and their intentions result in a tragedy they all must face. The repercussions of this behavior creates a whole new set of circumstances and despite the tragic elements the friends are able to reunite by film's end - with very clear discoveries about each other and changes in each of their lives.

There is a lot of well written and well delivered humor in the first half of the film with the trio of women creating a bond that seems to be ceaselessly entertaining. The introduction of Jed - played to perfection by the very talented Kenny Doughty - changes the theme of the story and while many viewers will feel negative about the turn of events there is here a chance for the examination of the spectrum of friendship that is solidly written and performed.  What seems to be a bit of fluff movie develops into a psychological study that makes it stand above many other 'chick flick' comedies.  Grady Harp, December 10",1293408000,2,2336,4.609638554216867

1735650,3,B00006ADD0,"This is a trite film, as can be seen by summarizing the plot, without revealing the ""happy ending."" Three somewhat hedonistic forty year olds enjoy smoking, drinking, and telling tales about their male conquests or near conquests. They are very close and enjoy each other's company. Then Andie Macdowell fall in love with a boy that is only around 25, close to half her age. He does not fit in with the other women, nor with their friends. The two friends try several ways to bring Macdowell to her senses.

What do they do? Is it anyway different than in other films? Will they suceed? What happens to the boy? What happens to Macdowell? The ususal breakupup of friends occurs for the usual reason. Will they get back together? Do we care?",1286236800,3,740,4.606060606060606
1735651,5,B00006ADD0,"I saw this movie a few years ago; while browsing through cable channels on a night of boredom... As I watched it became more interesting; and I was touched by the true love that was happening to this woman who had such bad experiences with her previous dates. I was disgusted by what her friends did to break her relationship in pieces. I rarely cry during movies but this was a tear buster!!! I needed tissue and a small jar of ""vicks"" by the time it was over!

Here it is years later, and now I happen to be in a similar situation; and I actually woke up thinking about this movie and almost in tears! the real issue that has been brought out in this movie is when two people find each other and are sincerely happy people prey on that and will do everything in their power to sabotage it. Especially if the woman is older than the guy she is dating. That becomes the number one factor in the talks of the relationship and to other people is grounds for an automatic split. It's sad that two people can't live their lives in peace loving one another when so many people around them are against them. It makes maintaining a healthy relationship that much more difficult. Her ""so called"" friends caused a tragic end in her happiness. I think it was God that instilled forgivness in her for them! ""Friends"" who do that; aren't friends at all!",1247097600,2,1341,4.364

They get together, eat junk food, smoke, drink and commiserate...nothing could possibly break this bond. Right?

Until one of them (Kate,the headmistress played by Andie MacDowell) finds unexpected love with a former (twenty-something) student.  At first, the ""girls"" are amused; but then when it seems that Kate's feelings contain as much love as lust, the conspiring begins.

Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor play the co-conspirators, who will do whatever it takes to get their friend back in the fold.

Tragedy follows, and then comes a powerful disconnect between the three friends...But just when all seems lost, an unexpected blessing brings the three back together into their tight-knit bond, but with a new and fresh perspective.

Somewhat predictable sisterhood flick...hence, the four stars.

1735653,2,B00006ADD0,"Several reviewers here have fallen into the silly groupthink that makes every character emblematic of their ""demographic."" No one is saying that all 40 year old women are desperate, sleazy, selfish and stupid. However, these three certainly are. Now, if that is a valid subject for a film is another question.....

One of the things that movies used to do, but seem to have forgotten how, is to show characters grow and change. When two people meet and fall in love, please, let us see some aspect of what sparks their attraction. But no more. What this couple sees in each other is never clear. I'm not doubting, I'm just wondering. We never see them together unless they are copulating or sharing coy glances. What do they talk about? What do they do when they ahe their clothes on? And they, like the busy doctor and the high-ranking police woman, sure seem to have lots of free time....

I have always found Andie MacDowell wildly over-rated. I bought the hype all those years ago and saw ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" and found her uninteresting and unconvincing. ""Groundhog Day"" was a great film in spite of, not because of, her. Nothing I've seen her in was improved by her wooden and stilted delivery. And here she is so totally implausible as the headmistress of a school that you are almost forced to laugh. Not a ******* chance, guys. This silly woman has no drives other than libido and ego, no manifestation of intellect other than bookshelves full of nice old books, and no ability to lead anyone anywhere except to her crotch. What a pointless and dreary film. And the double meaning of the title is all the more unpleasant after the big shockeroo in the middle. By the time it is over, you will feel soiled and cheated.

1735656,1,B00006ADD0,"This review is a warning to the innocent out there: Do not waste your time on this movie. There is a saying I heard: ""Pay the Quarter."" What this means is, pay the quarter for the two red-hot spears to poke your eyes out in frustration because you wasted two hours of your life watching a horrible movie. This is definitely a ""Pay the Quarter"" movie.

Why did I sit through this, then? I have no idea. The only saving grace is that I watched it on IFC and didn't pay a red cent to see it (well, if you don't count the cost of cable to get IFC).

This movie is completely unbelievable and insulting to women. If you believe this movie, all over-40 women are hopeless, insecure, neurotic (or in the case of the doctor chick- psychotic) wenches. Andie MacDowell is horribly miscast as the headmistress of an English school and I just felt sorry for her that she somehow got stuck in this ridiculous waste of a movie. What her ""friends"" did to her character is completely inexcusable and that she would take them back - let along have her little ""get-togethers"" with them again - is just unfathomable and unbelievable. There is not a shred of reality in this movie. Even the romance between Andie's character and the younger man falls flat. Sleeping with him in the backseat of the car? In your teens and 20s, maybe - but when you are in your 40s? Have some self-respect, woman! Maybe that was what the movie was trying to say in a bizarre way? Maybe the reason why I sat through this movie was to see where this miserable trainwreck of a movie would end up? Well it doesn't end in a good place, despite the ""lighthearted"" laughter with her reunited ""friends."" (Sounded more like forced laughter - and who could blame her?) Does the character even get that she is now a single mother? Was she that stupid? I dunno. But what I do know is don't waste your time watching it - even if it comes on IFC on a Saturday afternoon and you don't feel like doing anything else.

1735660,1,B00006ADD0,"Somewhere along the way, a Romantic Comedy really, really offended the writers of this film. I don't know if their wives/girlfriends/boyfriends/friends dragged them to too many showings of Sleepless in Seattle, or the Wedding Planner, or whatever other pointless romantic comedy you can think of, but even the people who wrote the film's description on the back of the DVD cover were in on it.

BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A COMEDY. It is a soulcrushing tragedy. Halfway through you may say to yourself, this is a romantic comedy that's a step above the rest: funny lines, beautiful cinematography, an interesting and provocative story, shopping trips to paris, champagne and bathrobes, gorgeous men and women, hilarious and sexy love scenes - why stop here? STOP NOW. Because otherwise, you'll end up falling prey to the evil schemes of this film's creators, who used their talents and intelligence to literally PUNISH their viewers for becoming emotionally invested in it.

This film is manipulative, sadistic, and nihilistic. It doesn't show us anything real about life's tragedies. I really can't even express how much this film not only disappointed me, but offended me and my friends for how blatantly it turned on its own audience and its actors. Andie MacDowell literally winces through the end of the movie, perhaps as offended as we are that the writers/director actually expect us all to lap this up and take it on the chin. That MacDowell's character should roll over and thank her lucky stars that one small ""miracle"" emerges from all this destruction is a final gut-punch to the female population.

Then out of nowhere comes a plot ""twist"" that is extremely cruel and unnecessary to wreck the whole thing. The 45 minutes or so that follow are completely unbelievable and wimpy on the part of writer/director McKay. If he had ever paid attention to female relationships, he would know that his resolution to this movie is laughable. No one in their right minds would forgive the things that Andie McDowell's character is expected to get over in this movie, and they sure as heck wouldn't be as peaceful about the way everything turned out as she is by the time the credits roll. The only reason that this movie got the rating it did from me is that the acting is actually quite good, but that doesn't save this movie. Ridiculous.",1104364800,8,1044,4.5

1735665,5,B00006ADD0,"I have just watched this movie for at least the 6th or 7th time (showing it to friends) and always find something else I missed because I get so caught up in the storyline and cinematography. I can completely feel what Kate (Andy McDowell's character) is going through at each stage as her acting is truly phenomenal. She does have wonderful help with Imelda (Janine), Anna (Molly), Kenny (Jared) and Bill (Rev. Gerald) beside her. Especially Kenny Doughty. Why he is not found more on the big screen, I don't know. Any Colin Farrell movie would have been 1000x better with Kenny in it instead. He has talent (and charisma) that far surpasses the usual we find out there in the movies of late and I honestly feel he could pick up the ball that Brad Pitt seems to have dropped (Troy only showed how Brad can carry his Legends of the Fall's Tristan from movie to movie - I'm getting rather bored with always seeing the same emoting from him. It's a good thing he's easy on the eyes).

Crush is definately a movie worth watching - especially if you enjoy the English way of life. I always feel like I've just spent  a few weeks in the British countryside after watching this.",1092268800,4,1172,4.47196261682243
1735666,2,B00006ADD0,"Recently seeing GREEN CARD led to me borrowing this from the library, where I had been ignoring it. Andie MacDowell is a fabulous, underreated actress. She has that smile that hits a man like a truck. The other two lead actresses, Imelda Staunton (the Police Inspector) and Anna Chancellor (the golddigging GP) are also fine as the English best friends of MacDowell, an American headmistress at an English prep school (an obviously improbable combination). All three do well with what they are given, but this movie flounders in its own confusion. It doesn't know what to be; the little comedy there is is poorly written, the melodrama is more than excruciating, and basically the thing just doesn't hang together.
Writer/Director John McKay could have used a better editor, both of the film and of the script. A little outside criticism from some well meaning friends may have made the thing more coherent. He tries to synthesize a screwball cartoonish essence with a sappy ""growth through emotional turmoil and healing"" thing that never seems to work. From the credits, McKay adopts a great comic style (reminiscent of Wes Anderson), using hard cuts and thematic music to introduce the characters to us that is excellent, but that flavor of ironic spontaneity is promptly lost, never to return.
 The relationship between the three women never even rises to the level of its own clich?, so its scheming quality and eventual breakdown is obnoxious and never either believable or amusing, being neither dramatic nor comic. MacDowell's relationship with the kid was annoying more than anything. It never seemed like a real relationship. I found him to be a rather odious little fellow, and fairly stupid. Thus I kind of rooted for her friends in trying to break it up. However, Chancellor's character was underwritten and cartoonish, thus her subsequent behavior, when McKay is awkwardly trying to turn it into a drama, is merely ridiculous.
Ultimately, the film is as superficial and two-dimensional as the characters, and mainly through underdevelopment. Oh well. Too bad. Life goes on. All in all a mediocre chick flick.",1085616000,,2121,5.077363896848137
1735667,3,B00006ADD0,"I thought the movie was good in a ""watch once but never again"" sort of way. The acting was decent but the plot had some slow points and the ending was dissapointing. Something bothered me about the way the story flowed and I still can't seem to put my finger on it, but I thought the movie was OK and held my interest the entire time,  but I wouldn't watch it again.",1075939200,,366,4.083333333333333
1735668,2,B00006ADD0,"To team heavyweight british actresses like Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor with accomplished Andie McDowell in a romantic tragicomedy must have seemed like a good idea, and, indeed, on paper, 'Crush' sounds like a solid, entertaining movie.
Shame, then, that in reality, it's a mindless, pointless serving of over-emotional claptrap, full of boring characters and histrionic situations. It's like someone took the stereotypical British reserve and tried (hugely unsuccessfully) to blend it with mawkish sentimentality normally associated with Hollywood blockbusters of this ilk.
Kate, Molly and Janine are all man-trashing, wine-swilling best buds, and when Kate finds romance with a man 20 years her junior, her 'friends', convinced this is a bad idea, do everything in their power to attemot to convinve her otherwise. The plot goes from predictable, to ridiculous, and back to predictable again, with very little room in between for anything worthwhile or redeeming.
MacDowell, Staunton and Chancellor are very fine actresses, so why their performances cannot save this terrible film from the festering recesses of Mundane is something I still haven't worked out. They each give decent turns as their respective characters but thanks to pedestrian editing and a ridiculous plotline, their performances are overshadowed.
It's partly the fault of a plot that isn't sure if wants to be a romantic drama, a screwball comedy or a portrayal of the evil nature of humanity. Why would Chancellor go so far as to seduce MacDowell's new lover in order to prove his unsuitability? Why would Staunton stay happy as a clam inthe background, offering neither advice nor caution to either of her so-called friends? All the good acting in the world couldn't save these huge idiosyncratic discrepancies from themselves.
The script is merely pedestrian, and the direction, forgettable. Even the most ardent followers of the 'Chick-Flick' genre will be hard-pushed to find any redeeming features in 'Crush' to warrant spending your hard-earned cash on it. Avoid.",1071619200,3,2050,5.429467084639499

1735670,2,B00006ADD0,"Either Andie Macdowall was miscast, or the two friends weren't right - something just failed this movie.  We wanted it to hurry up and finish because in the last 30 minutes, it dragged.  Frankly, no-one would make up that fast with a conniving bitchy friend whose actions more or less resulted in the death of the fiancee.  In fact, this is what spoilt the movie and helped it lose its credibility.  Ok, there's a few messages in this movie, but don't bother with it, it's just plain rubbish.  No wonder if went straight to video.  And did I mention the unnecessary smoking that these women did in the film? It was VERY annoying to watch.  Look for the scene where the Doctor friend smokes in the hospital while waiting for Andie's baby.  A doctor would know better ???",1048982400,4,769,4.521739130434782
1735671,4,B00006ADD0,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, though it was definitely not the light-hearted comedy I was expecting.  As a 25-year-old young professional, I settled into my couch on a rainy weekday night hoping to raise my spirits and de-stress with an old-fashioned romance infused with british humour, a la four weddings and a funeral.  I found myself at the end of two hours with tears streaming down my face.
The pluses of the film include the luminous performance by Andie McDowell -- she is concurrently believable as the prim headmistress of a little English town as well as an ethereally beautiful woman with a naughty side -- interesting enough to steal the heart of a younger guy.  Her rapport with Kenny Doughty is truly touching (and many woman can reminesce of the time they fell so much in lust and in love with someone not-just-quite-right but oh-so-alluring).  Jed, as the quirky little raver boy-slacker, I have to admit, stole my heart.
The minuses -- during the second half of the film, I kept wondering why the director didn't stick to Jed and Kate's story.  I sincerely wish someday, he would be inspired to come out with Crush Version 2... not focused on the horrifically catty women Kate calls her friends.  And with a happier ending.",1042070400,10,1243,4.785046728971962
