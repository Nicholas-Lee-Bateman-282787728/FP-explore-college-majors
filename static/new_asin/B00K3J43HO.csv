8659595,5,B00K3J43HO,This is arguably one of the greatest movies about pro wrestling I've ever seen. It's full of quirky humor and well done choreography in the matches. A must watch for fans of Korean comedy and pro wrestling.,1495238400,,206,4.594594594594595
8659596,2,B00K3J43HO,"film. I cant say I was expecting too much from it. It doesnt have anyone known attached to it and it is clearly pretty low budget. It revolves around a wimpy office worker who inadvertently, boring story short, becomes an underground wrester. The wrestling gives him more confidence, but he is still kind of stupid. Even when he stands up for himself, its just awkward. His boss is a jerk and its kind of ridiculous how he gets away with physically abusing his employees. This type of violent slap-stick goofy humor is popular in Asian countries Ive noticed. Some of the wrestling scenes are kind of wacky and funny, but this was just a boring pointless movie in the end.",1415232000,,671,4.6
