GREAT JAZZ REPERTOIRE... on/with the MANDOLIN(s)!
I love Don's mandolin playing and I have discovered much pleasantly Tony Williamson, Jeff Autry, Ben Tucker (""Fever"")
Too bad that the sound quality is so poor and often very weak
Even worse for the guitar sound (French: sourd, &eacute;touff&eacute;)
The picture is small. And it's good when the cam shows how the music is really played (close-ups on fingers)
Looking forward to a possible future Don Stiernberg DVD???

I would and have traveled many miles to see Don Stiernberg in concert - as all who have seen or heard him know, he's simply an amazing artist, playing with unparalleled clarity and nuance, a flowing stream of pure class. Tony Williamson spins long, beautiful melodies out of every one of these tunes. Every time I have been lucky enough to see him play I'm more impressed by the unique and rich contribution he makes. This was my first exposure to Jeff Autry but it won't be my last - some absolutely priceless thoughts were captured here. Ben Tucker holds it all together perfectly with some lovely breaks as well. It just doesn't get much better. Shot under small-venue concert conditions, the footage is not high-budget, but quite adequate and the closeup work is a gift to anyone who loves getting a glimpse of how it's done. I was so delighted and impressed by the individual and ensemble work captured in this video that I have just ordered another copy as a gift.

There's a preview on YouTube - can't post the link here, but search ""Low Country Jazz at Randy Wood's Pickin Parlor"" and you should see it.",1344988800,,1274,4.612334801762114
