5065362,5,B0079JMLUM,"My son is four and has sadly outgrown Wordworld&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WordWorld-Lots-of-Letters-Box-Set/dp/B002ERQWWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WordWorld: Lots of Letters Box Set</a>, and we've run Super Why into the ground. I am very picky about what my children watch- it has to be educational. When I accidentally DVR'd an episode of The Cat in the Hat and my reading four year old spied it before I did, we checked it out. I was happily surprised. My son loves the Cat in the Hat Learning Library books, and I love them as well, we learn so much! This DVD stays true and taught us a lot. My son and daughter always pile the blankets and pillows to be their thing-a-ma-jigger and take off on adventures! I didn't know that male seahorses have a pouch for babies! Way to represent Dads, seahorses! And otters holding hands so they don't drift apart? Cute! So many of the adventures have unique songs and the Cat's silly demeanor always entertains! And appearances by Thing One and Thing Two are guaranteed to get laughs!

The best part is when my son repeats to me something that he's learned from watching the show, and the show is a perfect bonus for him, especially when it ties into the Learning Library books we have.",1372809600,,1278,5.056872037914692
5065363,5,B0079JMLUM,My kids (ages 3 and 5) have loved this DVD.  The Cat in the Hat is so funny and silly and they also learn about ocean creatures while watching.  Definitely a good choice,1372377600,,169,4.090909090909091

5065365,5,B0079JMLUM,"Not much to say, just another great set of episodes from the cat in the hat knows a lot about that. Great purchase for kids who love the show and want to watch it all the time.",1350518400,,176,3.7837837837837838

Daughter absolutely loved this present.  It was encouraging to hear her laughing out loud throughout the entire DVD.  We had previously purchased ""Wings and Things"" DVD when the series first became available and loved all the animation and the goofiness Martin Short brings to the character.  This one was even better.  Great fun for all and educational too.  Highly recommended for anyone who has young kids.",1344384000,12,611,4.99009900990099
