2755795,4,B000N4SHNU,Good unrealistic little people look asian. Unrealistic plot. What is arthur waiting for to kiss the pirncess?,1179792000,,109,5.470588235294118
2755796,4,B000N4SHNU,"Invisibles is quality family entertainment.  It's a fairy-tale that's one part live actors and one part animation, but it's not your standard Pixar fare.  The animation is more like anime, and has the feel of a ps-2 game.

Freddie Highmore does a fine job again, as Arthur.  You may remember him from Charlie and the Choc Factory, and from an obscure little gem called ""Finding Neverland"" (both with Johnny Depp).

There's enough quality voice-acting here to satisfy anybody, but David Bowie's sardonic performance is outstanding.  And Mia Farrow is still so beautiful and has aged very gracefully.  It was a pleasure to see her again.",1179705600,2,635,4.9904761904761905
2755797,5,B000N4SHNU,"This is a great movie. I bought it on DVD and I was IMPRESSED!! Freddie Highmore and Madonna were great. It also has Jimmy Fallon, and Robert DeNiro. This is a great film for all ages! Your whole family will enjoy this movie!!",1179360000,2,226,4.27906976744186
2755798,5,B000N4SHNU,"To be serious I was expectin nothing... but left the theater really happy and I must confess that I watched twice. One by myself and the other to take my friends.

I really recomend it its pretty fun and the CGI are great.",1179273600,3,222,4.162790697674419
2755799,4,B000N4SHNU,"Can only get so far judging a movie by its cover, so even if the movie

looked like it was made for little kids..because of how CGI is evolving i

gave it a change....and im glad i did.

Its almost like a fairy tale, one that you never heard before, and that makes it even better.  A movie made for kids and big old kids like me. A movie with multiple characters that almost seems 3d....and by the movie's end i was surprise that David Bowie, Madonna and others have contributed their voices to this .....great little movie that can be viewed multiple times im sure....",1179273600,4,569,4.339622641509434
2755800,4,B000N4SHNU,"David Bowie was in LABYRINTH, not Legend...that was Tim Curry!

2755801,4,B000N4SHNU,"I went to see this film with very little expectations.  Actually, the primary reason I went was due to the fact that Madonna voices one of the main characters and I just love with her.  So, to be quite honest, I got far more than I bargained for.  I absolutely loved the film!  I have a little soft spot in my heart for animation and CGI as well as a beautiful use of color and this movie had it all.  It helped me to rehash old memories of childhood and the vivid imagination I've tried so hard to sustain.

Most importantly, I believe this is a great film to share with children.  It teaches great lessons in friendship, bravery, loyalty, and love.  It also does not try to sugar coat these lessons for soft-hearted.  It lays them out there and pretty much says ""here's how its going to be.""  If I had children of my own I definitely would have made sure they got the chance to see this movie.

Additionally, I loved the movie so much I borrowed the unabridged verison of the book on CD and listened to it while at work.  The movie truly does the book justice and really only snips the portion when Arthur and the two Royals first come to the Forbidden City.

Watch ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" and you're sure to get a fast-paced, lessons learned, ""god, what a cute movie"" feeling!",1177459200,4,1283,4.317991631799163
2755802,5,B000N4SHNU,"This movie is absolutely delightful! A story full of wonder and courage. Like the child I have seen in all my children. That part of them who does not give up, no matter what. This story spoke to me in a deep place. Amazing things happen when we stand for what we believe to be true. This story confirms that truth in a wondrously told tale.",1174089600,,341,4.181818181818182
2755803,5,B000N4SHNU,"One of the most enchanting and delightful fables to ever hit the screen, ""Arthur And The Invisibles"" is an odyssey of fun, adventure, magic, and comedy that's sure to delight kids of all ages and awaken the hearts of even the crankiest cinema-goers.

  A blend of live-action (about a quarter of the film) and high-tech, extremely detailed and beautiful computer animation (the other three quarters), this movie may be, in tone and spirit, the closest thing made outside of Asia to classic Studio Ghibili anime (ex. ""Castle In The Sky"", ""Spirited Away"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", etc.).  Arthur is a little boy who lives with his grandmother on a rambling old family farm while his parents are off in the city searching for employment during hard financial times.  Arthur is fascinated with the tales of his grandfather, a currently-missing old adventurer who in his younger days travelled Africa befriending and living with various tribes and cultures, and sometimes aiding the continent through, for example, helping local farmers to introduce irrigation to drought-prone lands.  There are many more fantastical adventures the grandfather claims to have had, including meeting a race of African 'wee folk' called the Minimoys.  When the family farm is threatened with foreclosure due to outstanding bills, Arthur decides that he needs to locate a treasure of rubies his grandfather acquired in Africa in order to come to his family's aid, and, convinced that these Minimoys now reside on the same land he, his grandmother, and their dog live on, sets out to find these small creatures and enlist their help on his search.

  Magically transported into the land of the Minimoys, Arthur finds himself transformed into one of them and, just as he needs help to save his home, finds the Minimoys in need of aid of their own.  For it's a time of great strife in this magical wee land, where races other than the Minimoys live and conflict is escalating.  An alliance of wonderous characters assembles to tackle their collective problems.

  The Minimoys, their world, and the myriad other creatures they share it with are all exceptionally well rendered, and the voice acting is very well performed. The characters are excellent; the Minimoy King, his feisty daughter, and his accident-prone but earnest younger son are among the most instantly captivating, and there's also a little mole with a much smaller role I found absolutely endearing. There's enough ""Shrek""/""Toy Story"" style humor to appeal greatly to fans of these movies (although in my opinion ""Arthur And The Invisibles"" is a significantly better movie) and fans of ""Spirited Away""-style Japanese anime, ""Fairy Tale: A True Story"", ""E.T."", and ""Lilo & Stitch"" should all see this as soon as posible.  A brilliant movie with room for one or more sequels; few movies have ever debuted which are so ripe for expansion into a full saga.  10/10",1170460800,9,2896,5.050420168067227
2755804,3,B000N4SHNU,"In the cinematic world, there are few things as disappointing as a good-hearted fantasy film that misses the mark. Such a shame: a lot of work went into Luc Besson's ""Arthur and the Invisibles,"" a film of great imagination and style. But something was missing, something that prevented the story from transcending its overtly unrealistic elements. It seemed that the emphasis on creating the right world for these characters was too strong; not enough emphasis was placed on developing the characters themselves, nor was there enough on immersing the audience within this world. This film felt only half complete, as if Besson was in a hurry to get his project finished and released.

The world that I'm referring to is that of the Minimoys, miniscule, elfin-like creatures that live underground. The parts of the film featuring these characters are completely computer generated, meaning that the filmmakers had to pay close attention to detail. Sure enough, details are abundant: we see immense dirt caves; we see elaborate contraptions of Minimoy design, such as weaponry and tools; we see finely built structures, such as aqueduct systems; we see grandiose throne rooms. But somehow, it wasn't enough. For one thing, what we were shown went by far too quickly; I never had the chance to fully absorb everything I was watching, which made it a lot harder to feel connected to the story.

The Minimoys' underground kingdom is located in a Connecticut garden, one that's on the property of Arthur (Freddie Highmore) and his grandmother (Mia Farrow). These characters are introduced in the live action portion of the film, which I could tell was purposely created to establish plot. In that regard, the story succeeds; everything we need to know is outlined during these scenes, such as the fact that Arthur's parents (Doug Rand and Penny Balfour) are well intentioned but incredibly neglectful. They live in the city, hoping that getting better jobs will help them through hard times. What they don't realize is that they're missing significant portions of their son's life, such as his tenth birthday.

We also learn that Arthur's grandfather, Archibald (Ron Crawford), has been missing for quite some time. He was a cultured, adventurous man who had once gone on an African expedition and returned with a small fortune in rubies, supposedly now buried somewhere on the property. While on this trip, he had become friendly with members of an African tribe, who have a harmonious existence with the Minimoys (apparently because of a universal balance; they're a tiny race of people while the Africans are incredibly tall).

Because Archibald is missing, a greedy land developer known only as Davido (Adam LeFevre) is ready to pounce on his property, currently occupied by his wife and grandson. Unfortunately, everything was done legally; the right people were present to sign all the right papers. If Arthur and his grandmother intend to stay in their home, Archibald must return with the right sum of money. Of course, Davido is almost certain that he will never come back, which allows for a display of arrogance commonly seen amongst fantasy film villains.

For the sake of the story, Arthur was crafted to be of the brave, ambitious type, one who feels that everything will turn out right if he holds out enough hope and shows enough courage. For years, he had been told about the Minimoys, gathering most of his information from a collection of illustrations and notes his grandfather left behind. From these sources, he learns that the treasure is within their world; if he can somehow speak with the Minimoys, then maybe he can convince them to give him the treasure. That way, Davido can be paid off, and Arthur's home will be spared (as well the home of the Minimoys).

Apparently, Archibald always intended for his grandson to complete a mission, and he tells him so through a series of cleverly hidden written messages. And according to these messages, Arthur is to enter the world of the Minimoys and find this missing treasure. With the help of a special telescope, the moon, and a group of African warrior types (how they conveniently showed up in Connecticut is anyone's guess), Arthur is shrunk down, pushed into the telescope, and transformed into a computer-generated, elfin-looking character.

Thus begins his adventure in the Minimoy kingdom. He meets a number of colorful characters, including: The King (Robert De Niro), who, for whatever reason, alters his appearance by sitting atop a furry monster; his daughter, Princess Selenia (Madonna), who feels she has something to prove; and her younger brother, Betameche (Jimmy Fallon). I would have believed these charactere were it not for the humorous dialogue, none of which seemed appropriate for this kind of film. It was especially prominent in a scene featuring the voice talents of Snoop Dogg and Anthony Anderson; it was obvious these characters were included merely as a way to add comedy relief to the story. But consider the fact that all the Minimoy characters were funny at some point; even the headstrong Selenia will occasionally make some wisecrack about her brother. The entire Minimoy civilization served as comedy relief, which I found bothersome considering they're supposed to be integral to the plot.

Arthur and the royal siblings make a perilous journey across the lawn to a necropolis city, which contains both the treasure and the evil Malthazar (David Bowie), leader of a warrior race who have long since been at odds with the Minimoys. His scheme is to unleash a flood upon the opposing clan. Exciting idea? Yes. But it wasn't handled properly in the final film; Malthazar's character was painfully underdeveloped. He's only seen during the last half hour of the movie, meaning his scheme practically comes out of nowhere. It doesn't help that he seems to be the only level headed one of the entire clan; all of his troops--even his own son, Darkos (Jason Bateman)--are nothing more than bumbling fools. Example: early on, a couple of warriors invade the Minimoy city. I distinctly remember this argument: ""I'll count to three ..."" one begins to say. ""Why three?"" the other interrupts. ""That's just the way it's done,"" the first replies. ""Why not five?"" is the other's suggestion. I admit that some of the jokes in this movie were funny. Still, is there no sense of seriousness to this story?

Maybe I'm being overly critical. Nonetheless, I can't help but feel that ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" had the potential to be so much more than it was. There are a number of problems I could list: far too much about the Minimoys was left unexplained, leaving what little there was seem completely out of place; some of the fairy tale element are unoriginal, the most notable example being Arthur's ability to pull a sword free from a stone; Freddie Highmore retains his British accent for his character, which doesn't make sense in a film taking place in the United States. But my biggest problem was being forcibly detached from the imaginative settings; the world of the Minimoys is rich and vibrant, and I wanted to experience it fully. When an idea so stunning is willfully pushed aside for the sake of pacing, you can't help but feel greatly disappointed.",1169596800,2,7253,4.987603305785124

This is one of our family favorite's. When it came time to hand pick some movies to download to our kindles the kids picked this one. I personally love it too.

2755894,4,B000N4SHNU,"Very enjoyable, watched with a batch of children who loved it. The stars providing the voices were surprising recognizable, considering I had never heard of the movie when it came out. The animated characters had a Dark Crystal feel to them that I appreciated, which was lost on the kids but they adored them. Definitely recommend this movie, but can't say the same for the two movies that followed. They had none of the joy and spontaneity of the first movie, and replacing David Bowie's voice for the villain with the unintelligible mutterings of Lou Reed was a major disappointment.",1405468800,,585,4.86

First it was sent to the wrong person in the wrong state of Australia!
lucky for me this complete stranger sent it on to me at her exspence.
Then when I got it and put it in my DVD player it told me I was in the wrong zone.
When I complained to Amazon they told me it was zoned for Canada and America ONLY!
Why did the seller not say this in the ad?
Instead of wasting everyones time and money [mine and the lady in Victoria]
Amazon have said they will refund me but if the ad was done properly in the first place they would not have too.
I'm not happy with the serve and angry that I can not have the DVD because it has been coded!",1364083200,,706,3.8424657534246576

2755937,2,B000N4SHNU,"The movie has SO much potential, but falls short in so many ways.

#1 - The movie seems choppy and poorly edited in some places.  Reading the other reviews, I understand that several scenes were deleted from the DVD and it makes sense why it's choppy.  It still doesn't fix the choppy transitions in some places or unexplained things, but at least we know WHY it doesn't flow smoothly.

#2 - If they're going to edit out crucial scenes on the DVD to make it more friendly for children, why do they still leave some things that are just not right for kids (The near-naked bartender, the repeated use of 'Oh my G**!"", etc.).  If they're going to edit it for kids, edit it all the way or not at all.

#3 - The story is too contrived (even for a kid movie) and poorly written in too many places.  The dialogue seems forced and fake too often, and the character transition (the stubborn independent heroine suddenly becoming soft and tender for no explicable reason?) is just not believable at all.

#4 - It seems like it's trying so hard to be a kid's movie but doesn't understand that the elements to make a good movie for grown-ups still need to be there for kids (believable characters, a consistent plot, no unnecessary scenes that make you scratch your head and ask ""What was the point of that?"").

Bottom line: The movie fell short of being truly wonderful.  It was cute enough and could easily have been a top-ten movie for us with a few minor tweaks.  It started out with a great idea and is right on the edge of going from mediocre to masterful...but never does.  Add to that a 5-year-old walking around the house saying ""Oh my G**!"" over and over and your 3-year old taking his pants off to be like the bartender and you get a frustrating 'kids' movie to have purchased with my own kids in mind.  Very frustrating for a parent to see your little ones mocking all the stuff you hated most in the movie.

Like I said, so close and yet so far away...",1360713600,4,1953,4.359116022099448

2755941,4,B000N4SHNU,This is a great film and good for the kids.  It's fun to see what lies in the grass and underground and to remember we are not the only ones here. I liked it and watched it a few times already with the kids.,1359849600,,207,3.7045454545454546

Movie Mars surprised me with getting it here before Christmas when it was not shown to arrive until much later. Great job guys! The dvd was well protected for shipment and arrived in Mint, Mint condition. I have them on my list to purchase from again because they show excellence in what they provide, and their pricing is great especially when you are having to rebuild/replace your collections. Plus they seem to have hard to find or out of circulation products. I DO like this seller!!!",1357171200,,635,4.781818181818182

2755947,5,B000N4SHNU,"This is a wonderful movie, and it does play in all Blu-ray players.  Just know that its first language is French, and you may find yourself digging for the remote to access the menu to choose English vocals instead.  When you do, the voices of Freddie Highmore (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and Madonna, and the live-action Mia Farrow will be much more pleasant.

Although the sequels can be had in Blu-ray in English, this multi-language version seems to be the only way to obtain the first film in the series, but it is worth the cost and the slight bother.  The animations are perfect, and the story is wonderful.  There seems to be no problems with the translation looking poorly synced.  I suspect it was filmed in English or converted with great effort.  The writer/director is Luc Besson, who wrote and directed one of my favorites, The 5th Element, with Bruce Willis and Mila Jovovich.",1354492800,,899,4.7243589743589745
2755948,5,B000N4SHNU,"I've never been so pleasantly surprised about a movie for kids.  Given that I never heard a peep about this movie, I thought it must be like the litany of other run-of-the-mill kids movies that are either corny, predictable, unnecessarily ""edgy"" to appeal to wider audiences, or all of the above.

Instead, I was very quickly drawn into the very likeable characters, the fantastic animation, and the endless creativity.  Sure, there are a few standard elements here and there, and I can do without Snoop Dogg as one of the bit characters, but even that scene was done well.  The live action is mixed seamlessly with the animation in a way that makes the animated world feel more real.  Simply one of the best kids movies I've seen.

Almost forgot, my kids (7 and 5) loved it!",1352505600,,775,4.62043795620438
2755949,5,B000N4SHNU,"We actually just listened to this book for the second time.  MY eight year old children love it.  My husband and I love anything read by Jim Dale, so we can flashback to our Harry Potter times, and we liked the story.",1351468800,,217,4.142857142857143

2755951,4,B000N4SHNU,"This classic yet modern fairy tale has a charming cast of characters, both good and Evil. The english voice cast was excellent, including Madonna, David Bowie, Snoop Dog and Robert de Niro. From Luc Besson, who brought us movies such as the  ""The Big Blue,"" ""The 5th Element,"" ""Leon The Professional,"" and ""La Femme Nikita"" comes a movie mixing live action and cg, that while borrowing generously from tales you're familiar with, manages enough originality to keep it interesting. ""Arthur et les minimoys,"" has a few sluggish moments, as if Besson bit off slightly more than he could chew, but overall it was a very entertaining family movie that will  appeal to children and to those young at heart.",1350864000,,700,4.873949579831932

His grandfather had helped some huge Africans who felt that they owed him for his help and introduced him to tiny, almost invisible people who lived on his property. The tiny people know about the existence of a lot of rubies. Arthur's grandparents owed money on their property, the bank sold the loan to a man, and he wants to foreclose on the property so that he can build condominiums on it. Arthur's grandfather went in search of the tiny people to bring back the rubies to pay off their debt. He left clues for Arthur to follow him, if he needs to do so. Arthur decides to find his grandfather and the rubies. The huge Africans come and help him reduce himself and go down into the country of the tiny people. He does so, has many adventures there, battles the tiny people's enemy, and becomes a hero. What and how he does all of these things, the interesting characters he meets, including a beautiful princess, and whether he saves his grandfather and the property, will delight viewers.",1315094400,,1213,4.726415094339623

2755988,4,B000N4SHNU,"This film was released in 2006 and I only ever saw it on a whim not expecting it to be anything special. How surprised was I to find that this was an incredibly enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout its entire runtime. Now I have to say something, I'm not a fan of Freddy Highmore and to be honest just find him incredible annoying. However, even I have to admit that he was great in this flick and don't really think this could've been done without him. Not only is this film carried by Highmores main role, but it's also a film that features two of the biggest musical stars of the 20th century of Madonna and David Bowie. This is just a picture with some massive names putting their voices and faces towards it. Snoop Dogg, Mia Farrow and David Suchet come together with music legends and the main antagonist to create this highly enjoyable film experience.

Arthur is a ten year old boy living with his grandmother whilst his parents are away looking for work. His eccentric grandfather has been missing for a number of years, and his grandparents house is due to be torn down due to massive debts. Arthur reads a book that tells of the land of the Minimoys and his grandfathers secret treasure hidden somewhere in the land. Arthur decides that this is simply his only chance to save their home, so he manages to get into the land of the Minimoys who are a people no larger than a human tooth who live underground. Upon venturing into their land he meets Princess Selenia (Madonna) and her brother Betameche (Jimmy Fallon) who offer to help Arthur find his grandfathers lost treasure.

What's the most surprising aspect of the whole film is it's simply not what you would expect. Although I stumbled across it, I had this dea that it would be a very childish film filled with idiomatic clichs and double entendrs that only the adults would get. What I got instead was a very clean and ejoyable film, not looking to over impress a particular audience but just looking to entertain. David Bowies voicing of the bad guy Maltazard is one of the coolest parts of the entire thing as I'm sure many will agree that the man himself is quite a scary persona.

I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a child or even if you don't have a child, borrow one from next door to give you an excuse to watch it. It's a great film, very clean and just a heartwarming experience but it's one of those that you couldn't watch on your own without appearing a bit creepy.",1230163200,,2474,4.469026548672566

2755992,3,B000N4SHNU,"This isn't a bad film, my kids liked it well enough.  My complaint is with the DVD editing.  I saw the uncut version on satellite TV in Japan, and this Weinstein release edited out some of the funnier scenes.  I suppose they were considered a little too racy for a ""G"" rating, but the material cut was very mild and shouldn't have been objectionable even to families with small children.  For example, when Arthur, the Princess, and her little brother are in a small boat about to go over the falls, Arthur needs a bit of rope so he can tie it to his sword, stick the sword into a log over the stream, and climb the rope to safety.  There isn't any rope, and Arthur starts to reach for the cord that ties the Princess's shirt front.  She swats his hand away and says something like ""just because we're about to die doesn't mean you can take liberties!""  He explains what it's for and takes it, so she has to hold her shirt closed with one hand.  Right away they have to climb up the cord, and he tells her to use both hands, but she needs one hand to keep her top on.  There are several cuts like that in this U.S. DVD release.  They make the story choppy and wipe out the context for some of the later jokes.

2755996,4,B000N4SHNU,"Arthur and the invisibles

I'm a sci-fi, fantasy, animation fan, so this movie is right up my alley. My favorite scene was the one where Grandma is telling Arthur about Granddad's travels. The lighting is that magical golden-amber and your imagination runs away as she tells the story of the giants, their brothers the little people and the rubies they gave granddad.

But let me back up, our hero, Arthur is a little boy who lives with his grandmother (Mia Farrow) in the country. His parents call from the city on his birthday because they are still there trying to find work. He's of course sad because they aren't with him. But grandma had someone bake him a cake, (their oven isn't woring) and she has a wind-up toy car as a gift for him.

Granddad disappeared a few years ago, and unfortunately, a bad guy is going to come take the property they live on because they can't pay the bills. This is where Grandma tells Arthur stories of Granddad's travels, and how he made friends with a tribe of very tall people, and another group of very small people. They are sort of two sides of one coin. They call each other brothers. To thank granddad for his help, they give him the rubies, which could be very helpful given their financial problems.

Arthur asks his grandmother where the rubies are and she explains that granddad hid them in the back yard, and looked tirelessly for them, but couldn't find them. Then, he disappeared.

Through a series of clues, (another of my favorite parts) Arthur discovers how to get to the land of the little people, and this is where the adventure begins. He becomes a Minimoy, which to us means he becomes an animated, and somewhat more hip version of himself. He meets the king (Robert DiNero) and his daughter (Madonna).

He finds out that his grandfather has been through their land and went to look for the rubies. A bad guy, with the voice of David Bowie, threatens their land, and has the rubies. Arthur, the princess, and her little brother go off to face the bad guy. On the way, they discover that one of Arthur's inventions is going to be used by the bad guys to hurt the Minimoys.

They find Granddad in prison, where they also end up. They of course get out, save the Minimoys and Arthur and his granddad get home with the rubies to save the day.

There is also hope for a future relationship, because Arthur is able to go visit every 10 moons. And the final scene the princess is looking at him through his window saying ""I'll wait for you.""

2755999,3,B000N4SHNU,"Yes, I admit it. ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" (""Arthur et les Minimoys""), Luc Besson's first animated film, is far from perfect. Its weak story borrows bits of elements from various fairy tales and legends and its combination of live-action footage with animation does not work as it should be. Still few animated films can attract such talent as Madonna, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg and Robert DeNiro (all providing voices for characters) plus Mia Farrow. And its colorful animation is delight to see.

Freddie Highmore (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") is Arthur, young brave boy who has only 48 hours to save his grandma's house from being sold to a greedy businessman and demolished. To seek the treasure hidden in the garden, he becomes small (using some device that need no explanation), as small as 2mm, and join forces with the Minimoys, tiny people threatened by evil ""M."" Thus Arthur's adventures with two Minimoys - independent Princess Selenia and fast-talking comic relief Betameche - begins.

You will find nothing particularly new in this story. The film's a bit contrived plot unfolds sometimes at hectic speed especially in animation part, which is often interrupted by live-action counterpart. Mia Farrow (who appears only in live-action segment) is not bad as the hero's slightly loopy grandmother, but her segment is rather dull to me mainly because the film comes back to her several times when not many things happen to her except, as you see, her missing grandson whom we know is all right.

I said this is Luc Besson film, but the film's original concept came from Cline Garcia and Patrice Garcia. It must have taken considerable time and efforts for them and Besson to develop the idea into the film's universe as it is, but I think with a simpler story and more round characters the world of the Minimoys would be more attractive. In short, we don't need ""Pulp Fiction"" parody. ""Antz"" already did it. We don't need a greedy businessman. Anyway kids love adventures and without that guy boys and girls would join in the travel with the Minimoys.

Instead we want more engaging stories behind the relations between the Princess and the Evil King; we need more adventures before arriving the destination; and most of all, we want to know more about the suggested love (with some sexual nuance) between Arthur and Princess, which is one of the most intriguing part of the film, considering the cast of Freddie Highmore and Madonna. This alone could have given originality with a more developed and attractive form.

I hear this is the first chapter of trilogy. I find ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" is surprisingly good despite negative reviews given to it, but I really wish that they give us a better story next time.",1192665600,,2737,4.90280777537797
2756000,4,B000N4SHNU,"""Arthur"" is cute bit of fluffy adventure, not at all what I expected from the director of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fifth-Element-Remastered-Blu-ray/dp/B000QTD368/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fifth Element (Remastered) [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-A/dp/B00005JPRV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel-A</a>. The plot is simple enough: Arthur has an amazing adventure in an enchanted place - he becomes a hero there, then returns to the everyday world and becomes a hero again. That much is great escapist fantasy.

The format is a little surprising, though. The movie starts with live actors, switches to some very good animation through the largest part of the movie, then ends with the live actors - but even there, Besson adds some fun fantasy elements.

There are lots of familiar pieces here: the curvy-but-chaste princess (this is a kids' movie after all) with an attitude, geeky sidekick, quest for treasure, a little safe romance, and even a sword in a stone. Despite that checklist of standard features, this avoids being completely formulaic. Most adults wouldn't sit through it on their own, but kids need movies too.

  Arthur and the Minimoys, the first of a trilogy, takes a little time to really get going but once Arthur manages to reach the kingdom in his garden the amazement begins. Besson and his many specialists are on a par with Pixar when it comes to animation. The characters are very smooth and dance about in an utterly realistic decor of mushrooms, vines and other types of vegetation, cleverly put to use as either building material or ornaments.

Author listens to the stories that his grandmother reads to him, stories of adventures and little people that his grandfather discovered and helped.  Fantacy or truth?  Author feels they are true and goes on a search to find clues as to where his grandfather has gone knowing he certainly must have left to find the treasure of jewels that he knew his family would need.

  It seems there is a land of tiny people living in Author's garden, a people called the Minimoys and Arthur must allow himself to be shrunk to enter this world, save his grandpa and bring the treasure home to save the farm.  The adventure begins as we meet a quite charming and fiesty Princess, a kindly King and a nation of adorable little bitty people. As in any good movie there is always the 'evil one,' as is the case here and we meet Maltazard who has been holding Grandpa captive and is planning to destroy the little people.

  This movie is cute a a button, going back and forth from normal to animated.  It held all of our attention from the 8 year old to the 60 year old.  It is fun, adventerous and has a happy ending.  I think you will like this one.",1180828800,8,1374,4.337254901960784
