Most of the classic swordsmen movies did not have excellent stories, but they did have amazing fighting scenes.
This DVD is dubbed with 3 languages, Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. However, the picture is not digitally repaired. I haven't found a repaired version of this movie at any store. The only repaired version I saw was not for sale. It was only shown on a Chinese TV channel.
If you know there is a digitally repaired DVD of this movie, please also comment. Thanks.",1492819200,,561,4.6767676767676765
