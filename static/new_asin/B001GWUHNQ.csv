3621739,5,B001GWUHNQ,This is one of the best documentaries and movies I have ever seen. It is very inspiring. Coach Newton's sayings have more to do with life than running. It is great even if you don't do sports. It is a true testament to young athletes and people everywhere.,1226361600,3,256,4.354166666666667
3621740,4,B001GWUHNQ,"As a cross country coach, I bought this movie looking for an inspirational running movie to show my team before their district championship meet.  I was also very excited to see a movie made that actually featured cross country!  The Long Green Line was a good movie, well made, and nicely paced.  However, the coach, not the athletes, is the focal point of the movie, which is kind of a shame.",1224979200,3,394,4.52112676056338
3621741,5,B001GWUHNQ,"Anyone who likes sports and sports films will like the Long Green Line.  It does a great job illustrating a Cross Country Season, a team, and a coach.
  The ""feel good"" portions of the film are really ""feel good""; the ""let's kick some tail and win"" sections are equally compelling.
  Anyone who likes profiles of success will enjoy seeing Mr. Newton's successful interaction with so many his runners - there are MANY lessons for all who deal with young people here.  The film is a window into the world of high school athletics.
  Finally, I must congratulate and thank the filmmakers for including so many extras in the bonus features - they are a VERY nice addition to the disc.
If you like sports, running, or compellingly filmed profiles of interesting people or events, you will enjoy the Long Green Line.",1224374400,,810,4.695035460992908

3621763,4,B001GWUHNQ,This film does a good job at providing an insider perspective into the program - what's strange is that it still leaves some questions unanswered about the technique / motivational methodology of the program Joe Newton has built. If the program is so founded in building upstanding young men of character then why did two of them commit arson and get kicked off the team? This point aside - I wanted more if only because I think so highly of this coach. I think the old school ways of motivating kids to do more and be more are sadly disappearing and I know some people would look at his coaching style as domineering. Here's to more State Championships for coach Newton and his teams at York...,1435968000,2,695,4.523809523809524

3621797,5,B001GWUHNQ,If you want to sit down and watch a great inspirational running movie this is it. I sat down for the first time and started watching it and right after had to go for a run.

3621802,3,B001GWUHNQ,Great service but the documentary wasn't as in depth as I would have hoped. Interesting story though with the athletes.,1320364800,,119,5.0
3621803,3,B001GWUHNQ,"I have to offer a slightly dissenting view on this movie. Yes, it's an enjoyable feel-good story of hard-working young athletes and the respected elder coach who leads them. The runners and the coach are likable and it's fun to root for them. But something is missing.

In this movie, we are told that Joe Newton is a great high school cross country coach. Indeed, he is seeking his 25th Illinois state cross country title. But what we don't see is WHY he is a great coach. We never see him, for instance, working with an athlete on his running form, discussing training methods (long runs versus sprints, for instance) or even advising a boy on race strategy. All he seems to do is read an inspirational quote at the beginning of each practice, and then leave the actual coaching to his assistants.

In fact, if I was to explain why Newton's teams are successful -- based on what I saw in this documentary -- I would say it's just a matter of sheer numbers. At the beginning of the season, Newton has his upperclassmen go around the school and recruit runners. They end up with something like 180 boys -- a HUGE number for a cross country team (you only need seven). When you start with that many runners some of them are bound to be good.

I suspect that those who know Joe Newton would say that I don't know the whole story -- and that's exactly my point. The movie doesn't give us a complete picture. It assumes we will just accept that Joe Newton is a great coach without showing us how he does it.",1304035200,20,1503,4.379928315412187
3621804,5,B001GWUHNQ,"If you are a coach (of any sport) or a teacher this film will inspire and encourage a renewed commitment to scholar-athletes. Newton has the highest expectations for his athletes but also develops positive, encouraging relationships with all of his athletes, regardless of natural ability.  A great story. The only thing I would wish for is for more footage of racing with better cinematography.",1290297600,,395,5.171875
3621805,4,B001GWUHNQ,"Over his more than 50 years as coach of the boy's cross country team at York, Joe Newton's teams have won 26 State Championships and 20 National Championships. Although some of his coaching is controversial, since his top runners are putting in up to 130 miles per week, there is no arguing with Coach Newton's results.

After watching the film, here is what I think is his formula for success:

* Recruit a lot of freshman. Coach Newton aggressively recruits 50-100 freshman for the boy's cross country team each year.
* Get to know every runner on your team. Coach Newton gets to know each and every one of his over 220 runners. He give each one a nickname. He shakes their hand at each practice.
* Develop each runner. One of the runners featured in the film has cerebral palsy and can barely run at the beginning of the season. Coach Newton invests as much time with him as some of his top runners. He is soon beating other runners in races.
* Challenge each runner to do their best. Coach Newton provides his team with an inspirational quote each day. It's clear that he sees running as a metaphor for life.
* Develop team depth. In the film, several of York's top seven varsity runners aren't able to compete due to various problems, but the team is so deep their places are taken by the next runners on the squad and the team's performance doesn't suffer.
* Celebrate wins. Coach Newton and the York team celebrate both team and individual wins through out the season.
* Create a winning tradition. By winning so many State Championships, Coach Newton is both able to recruit runners who might have chosen other sports and to motivate the runners on his squad to keep the tradition going.

I highly recommend this film for high school cross country runners, their parents, and coaches.

The dedication of Coach Joe Newton is nothing short of inspirational. Having watched this movie, however, on the heels of reading Chris Lear's 'Running with the Buffaloes' and watching many other running movies, I had hoped that equal time was provided between the hat's-off for Joe Newton, his coaching technique and inclusionary principals, with some footage and story line on the top guns and the hard work and dedication needed by these runners, to win their school's 25th State XC Championship, along with more associated training or running footage.

THey have over 200 guys on the Cross Country TEAM?!!  That's crazy.  My school's football team only had 70 guys on it.

Newton is a great American Hero.  He'd make Obama AND Sarah Palin proud.",1256774400,,478,4.3522727272727275
3621814,5,B001GWUHNQ,"As a devote distance runner, I've always looked for different things that managed to capture the essence of high school running. As a counselor for my high school team's running camp this past summer, our head coach sat us down one night and put in this movie. I had never heard of it before (or even York for that matter) but instantly fell in love with the production of this film. Yes, it captures what high school running is, but it does so much more than that. It shows how high school sports build character, help develop young lives, and give teens something to turn to and invest their energy in. By the end of the movie, you'll see why these kids show up day after day to run for one of the greatest teams in the USA! If you enjoy inspiring high school sports films, this will live up to your expectations.",1255392000,2,815,4.333333333333333
3621815,5,B001GWUHNQ,"This documentary was well done and very inspirational.  Joe Newton's career has been wonderfully successful and it was great to get a small glimpse into even one of his seasons.  York is one of the most successful high school sports programs in history, and I would definitely recommend this movie.",1249084800,,298,4.94
3621816,5,B001GWUHNQ,"Coach Joe Newton is a long-time close friend, an outstanding gentleman and coach.  His record as the winningest cross-country track coachn in the US is amazing, but what's more important mis his ability to motivate his team members to do their utmost, way beyond what each boy may have even thought he could accomplish.  Coach Joe of the Dukes of York is in high demand as a motivational speaker throughout the country.  This is an outstanding movie about an outstanding human being.

3621817,4,B001GWUHNQ,"This DVD tells the story of the 2005 season of the York High School boys cross country team from Elmhurst, Illinois. The story is both about legendary coach Joe Newton, looking for York to win a 25th state title under him, and the team, led by the twins Matt and Eric Dettman who had been on the three previous York state championship teams. The Dettmans had finished 2nd and 3rd at state in 2004, right behind York senior Sean McNamara for an unprecedented 1-2-3 finish. But they will confront health problems in 2005 and the team will lose two of its best runners for committing arson. The story is well told and the DVD offers some nice extras with interviews of some prominent running figures praising Coach Newton. Illinois has produced more than its share of outstanding cross country runners and this is due in no small part to the fact that Joe Newton has raised the bar for everyone.",1232928000,2,892,4.58125
3621818,5,B001GWUHNQ,"I loved this movie.  I am a runner.  I even ran Girls Cross Country at York H.S. many moons ago.  But you don't need to be a runner to benefit from this man's wisdom and spirt.  Joe Newton is a legend!  He inspires not only runners but all people to be their best self.

It is unbelievable what this man accomplishes year after year, decade after decade.  This is not a school that gets to offer incentives for top athletes to attend.  On the contrary, he takes whoever he gets. Often times,these are ackward Freshman boys who come out for Cross Country because it is a non-cut sport!  Over the course of a few short months in a season, and a few seasons in their H.S. career, he turns these young boys into athletes and respectable men.

One thing I found especially inspiring while watching the movie is how he and his Long Green Line are able to prevail dispite adversity.  He creates such depth in his teams that when trouble arises (as it often can with young men) they have additional talent to call upon--additional men to rise to the challenge.  Joe believes in them, so they believe in themselves. Perhaps this is how The Long Green Line continually manages to succeed!

This movie is inspiring for athletes young and old, for parents trying to inspire their children, for teachers and coaches looking for a way to make a difference.  Don't miss it!!!",1232496000,7,1360,4.520491803278689

3621820,5,B001GWUHNQ,"Likely few sports fans or many people at all have ever heard of Joe Newton, yet the guy may be one of the greatest coaches in the history of American sports.  ""The Long Green Line"" chronicles a season in the life of the York High School (Elmhurst, IL) cross country team, coached by Joe Newton.  Newton has 50+ years of coaching experience and over 25 Illinois state Cross country championships to his credit.

Newton is old school, doling out tough love with daily motivational quotes to his charges.  More than great runners, he aims to develop young men of strong character.  Challenges abound in this quest as teens are tempted by booze and the lure of petty crime.  The story lines are compelling and the movie is an inspiring glimpse of one man's commitment to excellence in his craft.

""The Long Green Line"" is superb!",1230249600,9,825,4.6482758620689655
3621821,5,B001GWUHNQ,"I was really looking forward to this movie ever since I saw the trailer more than a year ago AND it exceeded all my expectations. This is a wonderful documentary about a team, their coach and their quest for their 25th Illinois State Cross Country title. The Dukes of York from Elmhurst, Illinois are legendary in cross country circles. Their coach, Joe Newton, is an icon in the world of cross country. The filmmakers, former York runners, do an excellent job of capturing the unique world of the high school cross country runner. The season unfolds with drama, tragedy and tenderness. For anyone that doubts the capacity of today's youth to work hard and sacrifice need to look no further than than this fine film. For hardcore runners this movie is A MUST!! BUT it is a movie that everyone will enjoy because it touches at the soul of what high school sports can mean every young person. This easily ONE OF THE BEST RUNNING MOVIES EVER!!",1229126400,2,940,4.634730538922156
3621822,5,B001GWUHNQ,"We heard about the Long Green Line and purchased a copy based on a friend's recommendation. While I am athletic and never ran cross country this movie goes far beyond that. Similar to the hero himself, Joe Newton, it's about more than a sport. It's about excelling beyond your own expectation, surpising yourself with accomplishment.

I wish I had a mentor growing up that had half of the energy of this coach.

The film is well shot, well edited and has a nice narrative. HIghly recommned.",1226361600,6,490,4.686046511627907

8307306,3,B001GWUHNQ,"Coach Joe Newton overtrained the Dettman Twins that is why they got sick and lost in the nationals. And he insulted his number 3 runner Marchese several times. When Marchese had a stress fracture from Coach Newton's overtraining, he hounded him and said it was ""tendonitis of the brain"". What a jerk for a coach. Incapable of showing compassion for an injured runner. Then, when Marchese is having a hard time with his studies, he publicly announces his name as ""failing"" in front of the whole team of 200 runners and humiliates him. Then he asks him in front of the whole team how he could be failing? Terrible interpersonal skills! How on earth could Joe Newton win so many awards for coaching? Just a terrible coach! Didn't show any love at all to his number 3 runner. Then, when his number 5 runner Justin Jones gets caught drinking alcohol by the principal and vice-principal, he tells Coach Newton who then publicly scolds him in front of the team. And the assistant coach yells at the team too. Terrible! These runners were being so overtrained, that they drank some alcohol to help ease the pain. The coaches should have understood. And supported the runners and fought against the principal and vice-principal. And given them a warning. ""Don't get caught again or you may be off the team."" High schoolers drink. Stupid to kick them off the team for being young adults or teenagers! They aren't kids anymore. So, since the coaches showed so much hate and inconsideration for the things these guys were going through, both Justin Jones and Brian Marchese  acted out and committed arson at a construction site home. And got busted. That never would have happened if the coaches did the right thing! And supported them. Instead of humiliating both of them in front of the entire team! Just terrible coaches!

Coach Newman was more interested in winning the state championship than he was in showing love to the team. He showed hate to his star runners! He should have given the phone call of how he would help with anything to the number 3 and number 5 runners, Brian Marchese and Justin Jones instead of to the freshman with cerebral palsy. Or call both. But he neglected his star runners and they turned to rebel which they should have done because the coaches were total jerks. I'd use another word that starts with an A. They were total As!",1493769600,,2349,4.685230024213075
