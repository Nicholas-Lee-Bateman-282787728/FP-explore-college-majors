7895993,4,630575540X,"This 1982 recording can be seen as primarily an important historical document in so far as it shows the main trio of Argerich, Maisky and Friere at a much earlier stage in their respective and combination careers than they are at now.

Much of the programme is familiar Argerich territory and is performed with typical sensitivity for the music and to each other as well as demonstrating sheer virtuosity. Indeed Argerich and Friere recorded the Rachmaninov and Ravel items for a fine CD at much the same time. That was a state-of-the-art recording of the period and still sounds well today. This DVD is not in the same class. Neither is the visual quality very good even for 1982. It all seems a bit amateurish including rather clumsy cut-off editing at the ends of pieces.

However, technical imperfections seem hardly the point here as all the performances are gripping or magical or both! There is no alternative to be bought of this combination of performers and music at this time and the technical side, although not good, is at least good enough to appreciate the wonderful artistry on offer. There is manufactured surround sound or the original stereo to choose from.

The Schumann Phantasiestucke is played with particular sensitivity by Maisky and Argerich and there are moments when the music seems to flow seamlessly, like water! The music will also be familiar to many in its oboe guise as this is an example of Schumann doing a bit of re-cycling to good effect.

The production has various historical and liner notes on screen but nothing on the printed sleeve liner other than adverts. This might be irritating to some but the consolation is that the notes are very thorough and well worth investigating.

The technical imperfections must have an effect on the final grading and for this issue I suggest 3 stars for recording quality, 5 stars for musical content and therefore an overall score of 4 stars for the purposes of Amazon.",1342051200,2,1948,4.837837837837838

7895995,5,630575540X,"I've had Jacqueline du Pre's recording of Schumann's Phantasiestcke op. 73 for years before I got this DVD. A few notes of comparison. In the du Pre recording, the cellist is clearly the star, the Phantasiestcke a showcase for the cello, the piano mere accompaniment. Gerald Moore is made deliberately unremarkable perhaps, a muted background and ornamentation for the cellist. In this DVD, Argerich does not accompany Mischa Maisky; she performs Schumann with him. Argerich is legend, Maisky a celebrated cellist in his own right, yet there is no grandstanding or obsequious deference between the two. Instead their Phantasiestcke is a beautiful duet of equals, a sonata, a dance between seasoned lovers, a sigh. After their performance I understood more the excess of rubato that is the usual observation on du Pre; it also means that the Phantasiestcke too long drawn out can be dry and boring. We can forgive du Pre for this; she was 17 years old when she performed the piece. The half-fullness of the life of a teenager, however prodigious and gifted, would tell on the performance. One can only wonder how the mature du Pre would have assayed the piece had illness not felled her. With this DVD, we can be thankful that two seasoned artists performed it at their peak. At Argerich and Maisky's hands Schumann's work is infused with epiphany, humor, wisdom, and such nuance that the insight of years can mine. Don't pass up.",1153094400,7,1429,4.909090909090909
7895996,4,630575540X,"It was filmed in 1982. Martha, now in her old age, was still quite attractive then. What struck me instead was the similarities bewteen her and her former teacher Fredrich Gulda: the same kind of hands, the same touch, the equally strong sense of rhythm, and both almost equally dynamic...
Arrau had ears only for her and Barenboim amongst the younger generation. But for the latter, Arrau's assessment might have included his achievement as a conductor. For Martha, Arrau said, ""She is not very consistent but she has a revelatory power...""
That power did not come from Gulda alone as he was just a bit short of that himself, albeit that it was him who laid her foundations. Audience who is familiar enough with Gieseking can tell that Martha has absorbed quite a bit from Gieseking and then a bit of Horowitz too. And behind all these was her personality which includes her shyness and her rebellion against the piano and she ran away from it very often and for the longest period three years. An excellent way of not getting mechanical! All these contributed to her unique power.
From Mozart for four hands, we see quite a lot of Martha's hands. And from Rachmaninov, we have much of her bare ( upper as well as lower) arms so that we can see the whole arms/ hands/fingers in action. There isn't any secret about her hands. Her facial expressions and bodily rhythmic movements are instead more telling, some kind of swooning we get from Gieseking's playing.
Amongst her partners, Economou is rather new to most audience, he is young and he is very good. As for Nelson Freire, he is definitely one of the best pianists who is still around. His touch as well as his facility are just amazing. To some (and among them one is none but Martha herself), he is even more interesting than Martha. With a greater musical mind, he would have made another piano Czar!
As to Maisky, he is one of the most celebrated cellists today. He also played with his bare forearm, so that we can see his hands in actions. He is, like Elman the violinist, a rather small person and he often has to resort to a full swing of his whole arm when bowing, but the musicality is superb. He may not have the perfect ease or poise of Daniil Shafran, but he has definitely learned enough from Rostropovich and Fournier. Some audience even prefer him to YoYo Ma. It's a most lovely piece there.
The drawbacks: yes, the sound and visual effects aren't quite the best. But they are more than acceptable. The way each clip finishes off is quite odd too. Above all, it's quite short only 56 minutes in total.",1052438400,17,2573,4.559395248380129
7895997,2,630575540X,"dommage, dommage, un manque flagrant de travail preparatoire a cet enregistrement, une prise de son souvent discutable, ( le coup de canon de la Valse m'a fait croire sur l'instant au passage du mur du son d'un avion a basse altitude !) des prises de vue banales sans interet, mais surtout une interpretation de Martha dans le Mozart frisant la desinvolture avec un ensemble parfois discutable sur des pianos don't on se demande s'ils sont bien accords. La vedette de cette pietre performance reviendrait plutt a Nelson Freire au jeu strict bien cisel, un peu conventionnel. Un manque de respect pour l'auditeur - spectateur que je suis. A la posterit, jugera t on Martha Argerich sur un tel enregistrement ?",1046822400,3,708,4.908333333333333
7895998,4,630575540X,"This video is an excelent performance. In fact, Argerich was in a peak! Somethings that are not so good:
The Schumann's Fatasie is a very nice piece and the sound is really good. But, I don't know why, the cameras seems to treat Mr. Maisky as a kind of soloist, and Argerich's hands its almost never seen.
The cameras shows the faces of the musicians for a long time, more than necessary. When she was playing with Nelson Freire, there is a camera that shows a frontal vision of the two pianos, you see the ""body"" of the pianos instead of the hands. The hands appears too, but it could appear more.
Some positive points are:
The sound quality is very, very good. The selection is very special. The last two pieces are very strong. The performance is perfect!
There is some program extras, like biographies and music titles. One of them is a feature called music analisys. It's really interesting. You can listen to the music and see a legend explaining the parts of the music. For example, the parts of the sonata: exposition, codetta, development of the first theme and so on.",1010620800,27,1077,4.556701030927835
