3792447,1,B001TM0HSI,"Horrible to the point of negating the novelty factor of being horrible.

I love horrible movies, but there was such little effort put forth.  Independent film-making should be encouraged whenever possible, but in the case of all involved here, their parents should have been honest and crushed their dreams.  There was NOTHING redeeming or even fun about this movie.  No story, No gore or nudity, and no passion or ability either behind or in front of the camera. Don't bother.
Check out October Moon, November Son or even Urbania for a better take on the gay horror/thriller genre.  They're independent and may not have the most polished acting, but you can at least feel the effort and passion behind it.  SKULL & BONES is nothing but TRASH.",1249171200,21,743,4.811023622047244

3792451,1,B001TM0HSI,"Dumb movie with an even dumber plot.
I get the premise, but it was ineffectual given the campiness & lame nasty FX (vomit & poop).
Horrid acting & the unattractive actors made it even worse.

3792454,1,B001TM0HSI,"This movie should be censured by some law, which forbid stupidity BIG time.
What i thought was a thriller about gay murdere, turned out to be a , not a B movie, but a Z movie of bad script, BAD acting, bad everything.
First i thought that it was just bad acting or directing, but after 5 min i realised, that it just was someones pathetic attempt to make a "" fun / ironic "" slashermovie, paired with some "" secret club"" theory, some gay sex and some kind of ""underground cult movie aspirations.
I honestly think that, whoever made this film, had some kind of  pretencious artsy  intention with it, but for some reason they couldn't make it work, gave up, and just improvised the rest in to this silly mess, with NO direction, no thrill, no sexy stuff, no humor, no plot, no exitement, no nothing but waste of time!
Maybe the director really wanted to make a combination of a snuff and a porn movie, but since that is illegal, he ended up with this wierd bastard of half attempts, improvised "" acting"", bad cinematography, bad sound and BAD waste of time and money for everyone involved.",1415577600,2,1086,4.425

It was horribly acted, horribly written, and plain rude.  If your goal is to find the worst movie ever, or the most ""B"" movie ever, then by all means watch this.",1403049600,2,301,3.9833333333333334
3792460,1,B001TM0HSI,"Absolutely pathetic...the cover is what caught my attention.  Other than that, this was by far one of the worse movies I have sit through and surprised I did it!  Although, it did help put me to sleep late at night.

I got so tired of seeing and hearing the same ""Look, we got skull and crossbones..."" from the van, it became laughable.  I can understand a low budget movie, but whoever directed this one...geeze...could have at the very least not splice the same scene into each ""van pickup"" of another victim.

This is not horror...it is just a silly, and albeit ""gross"" movie of two idiots needing to find some sort of sick sexual gratification...

Oh well, good luck if you watch it, but if you have to pay one red cent to do so, you won't get even that money back!",1402358400,,769,4.380281690140845

The acting was hammy and overwrought, so much so, I laughed out loud at some of the scenes where I was supposed to be scared sh**tless!",1389571200,,346,4.164179104477612

3792468,1,B001TM0HSI,"I have long known Ariztical productions for having less then stellar movies.  However, enjoyed the Eating Out series and thought to take a chance on this one.  Folks, don't bother, the movie is not even worth the plastic it is recorded on.  Abysmal acting, gore that is repulsive.  Even high school theater departments could do better than this.  I wasted my money buying this and certainly wasted my time watching it.  If possible, I would rate a ZERO!!!",1376784000,7,455,4.769230769230769

3792470,1,B001TM0HSI,"This story of two gay serial killer-rapists getting revenge on elitist Ivy League jerks is quite possibly the most obnoxious piece of celluloid I have ever endured.

I see other reviews comparing it the works of John Waters and H.G. Lewis, but I guess I missed the joke.

All I got was an ugly, mean-spirited, ineptly made piece of garbage that seemed to be going out of its way to try to offend me, but instead just left me with a migraine.

3792471,1,B001TM0HSI,"This is a terrible movie.  It won't satisfy those looking for a gay film, nor someone who wants to watch a horror film.  Only the most depraved sadomasochist could enjoy something like this--and they would have to put up with a ludicrous plot, senseless torture and, above all, the worst acting I've seen in a horror film, which is saying a lot.",1324857600,4,345,4.548387096774194

3792473,1,B001TM0HSI,"I was so disappointed with Skull and Bones! The premise sounds brilliant and original, however the execution could not be more run of the mill if it tried.

a lot has been said of the script, and especially the repetition of certain lines, I'm not sure that that wasn't done with a purpose, the film is however so condescending of the viewer that I didn't really care what the directors comment on society was. It's also rather pointless to make a B grade trash film (in the vein of the great John Waters) and then to make it as insipid as possible. John Waters had balls and he nailed them to the wall for all to see in his earlier work, something which is essential for this genre to work, what we have here is a sad imitation.

I would suggest staying away, however if your anything like me, you're gonna buy it anyway and hope for the best.",1284508800,7,844,4.30188679245283
3792474,1,B001TM0HSI,"This movie is trash. I could not watch it all the way through. In addition to a sickening plot, the acting is terrible.

3792476,4,B001TM0HSI,"I first saw Skull & Bones at a screening in New York and thought it was hilarious albeit in a very dark way. I'm not sure it qualifies as a suspense or horror film - it's more of an over-the-top shocker. The film's strange mix of black comedy, violence and sex is truly original but it is certainly not for everyone. One reviewer above recommended October Moon and November Son - I'd rather die young than snore through those again. I've seen Skull & Bones at least twenty times and often have it playing in the background at parties - it never fails to elicit at least one, 'What the f#$% are you watching?' from delighted/aghast partygoers. If you're a fan of underground films (John Waters, Liquid Sky, Kuchar Brothers) this is a collectible.",1259625600,,745,4.567164179104478
3792477,1,B001TM0HSI,"Normally, I love B movies. But this movie was not good. The acting was terrible, the same lines were used over and over again as if the audience were stupid and couldn't tell. The plot could have been used well by actors worth anything, a writer who knew what words are, and a director who knew what he was doing. Of course, my boyfriend loved it. But he loves all gay films. The two leads were not even attractive (not a necessity, just would have made the movie more watchable). I mean, who wants to see ugly dudes rape frat guys? Not me. Don't waste your money. Buy a real movie instead, like SpiceWorld.",1252627200,8,607,4.333333333333333

These two gay boyfriends go on a murder spree after one accidental killing.  They get insulted by some Yale students who are the stereotypical snobs who boast about being in the skull and bones and even say 'It's a secret society"".  Well the two gay guys decide to get revenge.  They pick up the Yale guys, one by one and every single one of the Yale guys says the exact same script!!  I couldn't believe it!  Didn't the director even notice this?  Well the gay guys kill and rape the Yale guys but don't worry about the police with these five murders as we don't see a single one.
