This movie looks like it was drawn by someone with Vaseline on their glasses. It's not pleasing to watch at all. The characters are cross eyed half the time, the sound barely matches the visual, and everything moves robotic like. The dialogue is chunky and hard to follow. After a scary moment snow white asks, ""Are you okay Hannah?"" "" ""I just want to know if you have food."" What..? They could be on one topic and everything is happy then the girl says something like ""..it's the only thing I'm good at. Everything else just makes trouble."" Why's she suddenly beating herself up and why is her tone happy? It's written like a child was telling the story themselves or maybe it was translated to English? It seemed to keep the attention of my 6 year old off and on but it is not at all enjoyable for the parent to watch with their child.
Definitely would NOT recommend.",1482624000,,882,4.450617283950617
