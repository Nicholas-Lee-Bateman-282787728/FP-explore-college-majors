8676500,5,B00N80XDTY,"This product arrived in record time, much sooner than expected. It was a gift for my son, who is learning Hindi. Although not in typical DVD format, it works in our SONY VCR and plays on his laptop, too. The case it came in is cool, as it's double the length of a standard DVD case, heavy stock paper, but emblazoned with photo/text as shown--gives a real ""Just-arrived-from-India"" feel.  I had been searching in US shops and online for a Hindi copy of Harry Potter in vain for 6 months, so I was thrilled to find this available on Amazon at last! Very satisfied!",1466985600,,563,4.413461538461538
