The real gateway drug is milk! That's right - it's where the vast majority of people who go onto things like heroin and meth got their start!

Seriously, marijuana is anything but a gateway drug. It can actually help people overcome dangerous addictions and supply them with an extremely safe alternative!

Don't buy this book and don't buy into the idiocy it proposes!",1341187200,,577,4.693069306930693
8016009,1,B0001PFYKU,"This video is basically a bunch of anti-marijuana propaganda.  It shows no facts for the claims it makes.  It pretty much puts Cannabis on the same level as Cocaine, Heroin, and Methamphetamine.  Shame on the creators of this film for mis-informing the viewers.",1138924800,3,261,5.023255813953488
8016010,5,B0001PFYKU,"I get so tired of seeing these people leave there proraganda on every thing drug related on Amazon. This video does an excellent job of presenting very truthful and factual information about mariluana.  It makes no moral judgement about weather marijuana should be legalized or not, it just presnets the facts about what it can do to your body and mind.  Don't buy into the pro-drug hype these druggies are pushing.  Buy a professional and well researched video like this one and learn the real truth.",1115683200,2,501,4.8023255813953485
