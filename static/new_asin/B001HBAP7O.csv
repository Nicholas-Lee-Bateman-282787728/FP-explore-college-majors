8308467,3,B001HBAP7O,"Has a few glitches, i.e. halloween and 2 other holiday scenes do not work but the Christmas scenes and music work good and are good for background during Christmas gatherings or just to get into the Christmas spirit. It's dvd quality so don't expect crystal clear scenes but decent for background. If you have a fairly decent tv and dvd player looks good.
For under  $4 it's not bad.",1506556800,,383,4.550724637681159

8308471,5,B001HBAP7O,"The younger set liked this screensaver and it kept their attention for quite a while while the adults talked. A great purchase for the money & rated ""G"" of course.",1387238400,,163,4.466666666666667
8308472,2,B001HBAP7O,"I bought this DVD primarily for the Halliween Vignette. I was having a Halliween party. You can imagine my dismay when I discovered that all the other holiday vignettes played flawlessly, but the Halloween one has a glitch and stops and starts snd sometimes freezes. It wouldn't play at all on my computer or my ordinary DVD player, but on my Blu-ray player it played, but eith the glitches snd freezes.",1352160000,,403,4.690140845070423
8308473,5,B001HBAP7O,"Very simple aminated images that scroll along the screen.  If you are looking for big HD real life images, this isn't the DVD for you.  If you're looking for simple animation with scenery, then this is perfect.",1322438400,3,210,4.648648648648648
8308474,5,B001HBAP7O,"I have about 8 Christmas/winter wonderland/snow fallling on trees/fireplace ambience dvds - but I found myself liking this the most for wrapping presents and general peaceful feeling during Christmas.  There are about 10 or so (more?) animated scenes  - about 6 are christmas scenes, and the rest are July the 4th, Halloween, Valentine's day, and all are done through computer graphics. You can choose either natural sounds (my favorite is of the one with a cute little pumpkin colored cat meowing off and on through 3 different home interiors with the tree/stockings/fireplace/cookies for Santa scenes while the fireplace crackles (you can choose ""natural sound only"") and I chose this for the cat scene - you can see the cat wave its tail around the furniture, then sit and stretch then just sleep for awhile in the various scenes - soooo adorable!!! As far as I am concerned, this scene was worth the price for the whole DVD and more.)

There is a scene with an industrious and smiling group of Santa's elves making toys to the music of Tsaikovsky (you can choose any music)and watching them as they finish each toy and send it sailing into corner where it goes down the factory line to (I assume) Santa's bag - it is rather hypnotic and trancelike - I like it! Then there is one of some eskimo kids playing tag around an igloo in a snow globe scene while a polar bear walks past them. Then there is one where you are by a stream where the snow falls and cardinals and rabbits hop about while the lights on the houses wink, and the tree lights go on and off. Another one has rabbits, deer - I think also - around a snowman and christmas tree - you can choose the sound of rushing air or music. Very lovely and enjoyable. Well worth it. I just wish it was on Blu-ray.",1266364800,6,1769,4.5046728971962615
8308475,5,B001HBAP7O,"I love this DVD.  I have it on now.  A beautiful wintery scene with house decorated, snow falling, lampposts lit, birds and rabbits hopping around and very relaxing instrumental music.  There are different scenes and music selections to pick from.  I want to buy more of the series.  You won't be disappointed.",1260748800,5,310,4.884615384615385
8308476,5,B001HBAP7O,This dvd is wonderful!!  Beautiful scenes make you want to watch it for hours.  Just what I was looking for!  Makes the holidays even more special!  Great for parties.,1260748800,4,167,4.655172413793103
