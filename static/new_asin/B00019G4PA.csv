She loves it and Leo. The other stories take a little more effort to sit through, but she will. My 5 yr. old grandson son loves it all.",1184198400,,298,3.901639344262295
1982438,5,B00019G4PA,"My 20 month-old daughter LOVES this video.  I have been getting it from the library, but because she wants to see it so much I decided to buy it for her for Christmas.  She watches 2 out of the 4 stories on the video-Is Your Mama a Llama, and Goose.  The pictures and colors on the first story are identical to the book.  The story is read a little slow though, but she doesn't seem to mind.  The Goose story is narrated very well.  I think she is a little young for the other 2 stories-Leo the Late Bloomer and Elizabeti's Doll.",1102377600,2,529,4.137254901960785

8008715,5,B00019G4PA,"This DVD is part of the Scholastic/Weston Woods series that brings children's picture books to life.  This one contains....
1. Is Your Mama a Llama? - Narrated by Amy Madigan, a little llama goes around asking other baby animals if their mother is a llama.  The story is in rhyme, and the children watching get to guess what animal the mama will be.  Very cute.
2. Noisy Nora - A mouse, who is a middle child, is jealous of the time Mama spends with the baby, and papa spends with big sister, so she makes a lot of noise to get attention.  Read by Mary Beth Hurt.
3.  Each Peach, Each Pear - This one is still pictures, not animation.  The child watching has to find the nursery rhyme characters hidden in the pictures.  They will find people like Cinderella, Mother Goose, the Three Bears, etc.  This is a gentle, calming story.
4.  The Little Red Hen - You know the story.  No one will help the little red hen bake the bread, but they all want to eat after she does all the work.  Every child should know this story.
4.  Read to Your Bunny - This one is a little propaganda on behalf of us children's librarian.  A little rabbit wants to spend all day playing on his game bunny.  (Get it Gamebunny = Gameboy.)  His teacher sends the book fairy to his house to talk to his parents about reading to him for 20 minutes per day.  They are completely clueless. Mom reads recipes out of a cookbook.  Dad reads sports statistics.  They take him to the library for storyhour, and of course, he falls in love with books.  His pathetic parents don't even know you can borrow books from the library.  Even though it has a message, it is fun.",1516838400,,1632,4.305921052631579

8008721,5,B00019G4PA,"I purchased this DVD separately because the copy of it included in a set I had purchased recently - My Very First Treasury of 50 Storybook Classics: Preschool Stories (Scholastic Storybook Treasures) - somehow manged to arrived scuffed, cracked and unplayable or repairable.

The stories included the classic by Paul Galdone, ""The Little Red Hen"", plus a great bonus story, Rosemary Wells' ""Reading To Your Bunny"" - excellent. Wells' ""Noisy Nora"" is also great fun.

The production values by Weston Woods, New Video & Scholastic are superb - these are terrific stories aimed at kids from 2-7 years old.",1362009600,,602,5.070707070707071
8008722,5,B00019G4PA,"We had another copy that came with the Scholastic set.  It was cracked by a grandfather trying to remove it from the case...obviously was not an expert DVD enthusiast!  This was ordered to pacify the broken heart of one grandson.  ""Is Your Mama a Llama?"", is his all time favorite.  All is well. The DVD arrived safe and sound. (Grandpa is relieved of his DVD duties!)",1267488000,,368,4.53030303030303
