With 5 titles on the line, the action was hotter than ever.  In the main event it was the First  Blood-End of an Era match for the WWF Championship between Champion-Stone  Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker.  Edge defends his newly won  Intercontinental Title against former champ Jeff Jarrett.  Tag Team  Champions-The Hardy Boyz with Michael Hayes defend against the Acolytes.  The European Title is up for grabs between Mideon and D-Lo Brown.  For the  Hardcore Title, Champion-Al Snow takes on the Big Boss Man.  Also the Fully  Loaded Strap Match between HHH and the Rock.  The winner of this match  becomes the #1 contender for the WWF Title.  The battle for DX as Road Dogg  Jesse James and X-Pac take on Chyna and the 1999 King of the Ring-Mr. Ass.

7891862,4,6305565724,"1.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Jeff Jarrett (c) w/Debra vs Edge

This was an amazing match to kick off Fully Loaded! One of Edge's best matches from his early days in the WWF. Very athletic match from Jarrett and the future World Champion, Edge. An interference from Gangrel allows Jarrett to hit his finisher on Edge and retain the title. Jarrett's post-match celebration is cut short by the familiar glass shatter, meaning Stone Cold is on his way to the ring! Austin sprints to the ring, lays Jarrett out with a Stunner and cuts a quick promo on Undertaker, promising to find him backstage and bust him wide open

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The Acolytes vs The Hardy Boyz (c) and Michael Hayes

Back in their heyday, the Hardyz and the Acolytes were two of the most physical and competitive teams you could find in a wrestling ring. Michael Hayes gets in on the physicality but proves to be a liability as he falls to a double powerbomb from the Acolytes and we have new Tag Team champions. If you enjoy old-school Tag Team wrestling, you'll enjoy this match

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) WWF European Championship Match: D'Lo Brown vs Mideon

Meh. Not a bad match. But nothing overly impressive about it either. D'Lo gets the win with the Lo Down on Mideon

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Al Snow (c) vs Big Boss Man

It doesn't take a brain surgeon to know that Hardcore matches in the Attitude Era were nothing short of high quality entertainment to watch. This one was a treat to watch. The action starts out in the ring but it's only a matter of time before it goes backstage before spilling into the streets of Buffalo, New York. Boss Man uses his handcuffs to cuff Snow to a fence and beats him unconscious with a nightstick and pins him to win the title. Awesome Hardcore match!

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Big Show vs Kane  (Special Referee: Hardcore Holly)

Battle of the giants here with a lot of ring brawling. Hardcore Holly attacks Kane and Big Show takes advantage with a Chokeslam for the win. Following the match, X-Pac comes in and takes out Hardcore with a spinning heel kick and tries to attack Big Show. The Undertaker comes in and Chokeslams X-Pac before joining Show in beating up X-Pac. This marked the formation of The Unholy Alliance

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Backstage, The Undertaker is shown getting beat up and busted open by Stone Cold Steve Austin

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Iron Circle Match: Steve Blackman vs Ken Shamrock

This was pretty much the first ever Parking Lot Brawl to be literal. It took place in the parking garage, all the superstars parked their cars in a circle and Shamrock and Blackman fought inside of the circle. A very short brawl that just sees a lot of throwing and slamming into cars. Shamrock wins after choking Blackman out with a chain. Another meh kind of a match but a somewhat interesting one

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) Mr. Ass and Chyna vs Road Dogg and X-Pac

DX had recently split and everyone seemed to want bragging rights to the name of the group. The faction that was at the peak of its success just a year before was now on the line for ultimate supremacy. This was a fun and fast paced one to watch; beginning to end. Chyna and Mr. Ass work over X-Pac for most of the match until he finally gets the tag to Road Dogg. Road Dogg hits the pumphandle slam on Mr. Ass to win the match, guaranteeing him and X-Pac, bragging rights of the DX name

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Strap Match: Triple H vs The Rock

The Triple H/The Rock feud had a tremendous amount of success in 1998 and fans were lucky enough to see the saga continue into 1999. At the previous year's Fully Loaded, The Rock and Triple H battled in a 2 out of 3 Falls Match for the Intercontinental Championship. Now they were battling in a Strap Match for #1 Contendership to the WWF Championship. After a classic and humorous backstage promo from The Rock, the match is underway. A classic and solid bout, no doubt. After some outside interference from Mr. Ass, Triple H takes advantage with a Pedigree and is going to SummerSlam to fight for the WWF Championship. This marked the end of the Triple H/Rock feud for the time being but it'd pick up again in late 1999 and go into 2000, as they'd have numerous battles for the WWF Championship.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) WWF Championship End of an Era First Blood Match: The Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)

This match got a tremendous of hype going into the PPV. The stipulation being that if The Undertaker wins, Austin would never get another WWF Championship shot in his career. If Austin won, Vince McMahon agreed to leave WWF and never be seen or heard from again. Vince McMahon came out to the commentary desk for the first time since 1997 and did commentary with Jerry Lawler and J.R. This match itself was a classic and maybe an underrated one. Nothing short of a classic brawl with a lot of back and forth action going on throughout the match. Austin and Undertaker had both busted each other open throughout the night, so neither man was 100% going into the match. All hell breaks loose nearing the end. Triple H interferes, The Rock interferes, X-Pac interferes, and so does Shane McMahon ! Stone Cold manages to re-open Undertaker's wound with a TV camera. This match defined what the Attitude Era was all about. Fun, excitement, entertainment, mayhem, brutality, and chill producing action. It wasn't truly the end of the Vince McMahon character though, as he'd return to WWF TV, 2 months later.

Overall: A great, solid, entertaining show to say the least. While most matches on the card delivered, there were some that didn't measure up or were just fillers. It's nonetheless a great show and an Attitude Era classic",1406678400,,6522,5.42970297029703

Jeff Jarrett vs Edge for the Intercontinential Championship -

Solid midcard match.  Debra looked smoking hot in that bikini and she could easily distract you from the match itself.  Rating?  Probably a 7/10

Bradshaw and Faarooq vs Hardy Boyz and Michael Hayes in a Acolytes-rules match

What is a Acolytes-rules match, you ask?  Nothing more than a no DQ match.  The match was physical and solid.  This match really showed how good the tag team division was over a decade ago.  Rating: 7/10

D'lo Brown vs Mideon for the European Championship

Not a bad match, but very forgettable.  No real chemistry between these two, either.  Rating: 4/10

Big Boss Man vs Al Snow for the Hardcore Championship

Like with most hardcore matches in that time, this one was all over the place.  In-ring, backstage, outside, on the street, need I say more?  Weapons galore.  Match was entertaining for what it was.  Rating: 7/10

Big Show vs Kane with Hardcore Holly as guest referee

Really bland.  Then again, most matches these two had in the last decade were bland.  2/10

Ken Shamrock vs Steve Blackman in a Iron Circle Match

Iron Circle was nothing more than a Parking Lot Brawl. Remember John Cena vs Eddie Guerrero from Smackdown 2003 in a Parking Lot Brawl?  This match is exacly like that.  Various WWF superstars watched as Blackman and Shamrock beat each other senseless.  Rating: 5/10

Billy Gunn & Chyna vs X-Pac & Road Dogg with the rights to the DX name up for grabs

Match was ok, but the storyline was rather pointless.  Rating: 6/10

Triple H vs The Rock in a Strap Match

These two fought in MANY matches throughout the Attitude Era, and this match kinda just falls into the obscure category.  This match was pretty physical (ex: Triple H choking Rock with the strap), but not the most remembered match in their rivalry.  The match was symbolic though, as it started Triple H's rise to main event status, culmumating at Summerslam 1999.  Rating: 8/10

Steve Austin vs Undertaker in a First Blood Match for the WWF championship

Decent match, sloppy ending.  Strangely entertaining though.  7/10

Overall, I'd give Fully Loaded 1999 a 7/10.  Solid but not exactly the best PPV ever.",1363737600,,2352,4.7245657568238215

7891867,4,6305565724,"Another old WWF tape that I found from the Attitude Era of the WWF. The night after the King Of The Ring, Stone Cold Steve Austin regained the WWF Championship from the Undertaker but Taker showed that he wasn't done with Austin yet in proceeding to bust Austin open (along with doing the same act in constant weeks prior to the PPV) & challenging him to a First Blood match which for those that remember was the same match that Taker had cost Austin the title a year before. However the bigger story was Vince McMahon raising the stakes that guaranteed one way or another, this event would mark ""The End Of An Era"".

Intercontinental Champion Edge vs Jeff Jarrett. The night before at a house show in Toronto, Edge won his first singles title so this was the rematch. And just like his match with Owen Hart months before at BreakDown, Edge held his own against the veteran Jarrett in what was a good back & forth match with Gangrel getting involved at the end & Debra being quite the sight at ringside.

Acolyte Rules: WWF Tag Team Champions Hardy Boyz & Michael Hayes vs Acolytes. This was just a glorified handicap match with the rules being that the Acolytes can win the tag titles no matter who they pin. These two teams didn't disappoint as this was just a brawl around the ring with one moment to check out would be this clothesline that Bradshaw delivered to Jeff while in mid-air. Hayes didn't slow down the action but it was his mistake that cost his team the match that eventually lead to the Hardyz leaving Hayes in the future.

WWF European Champion Mideon vs D'Lo Brown. After months of the European title being on the shelf, it returns here but this was the first flop of the night as Mideon does nothing for me as a performer & D'Lo just wasn't good able to bring out a good performance out of Mideon.

Hardcore Champion Al Snow vs Big Bossman. This match had a wierd storyline as Snow was begging Bossman to put him out of his misery due the ""Head"" driving him crazy for the past couple weeks. Anyways, this match followed the hardcore pattern that the WWF did at this point as they brawled around the arena using various weapons including a golf cart before they would out into the streets with Bossman handcuffing Snow up against the fense to win the match & the title.

Kane vs Big Show w/Special Referee Hardcore Holly. Holly was just added to the match for some comedy based on his interactions with both men throughout the couple of weeks leading to this match. Even though this did get slow at times, this was actually a good ""big man vs big man"" match as this was better than their previous KOTR match or even their dull Backlash 2006 encounter with the aftermath featuring Undertaker & X-Pac that planted the seeds for their tag team match at SummerSlam a month later.

Iron Circle Match: Ken Shamrock vs Steve Blackman. This resembled the Parking Lot Brawls that they would do a couple of years later involving Cena/Guerrero as they just brawled in the parking lot surrounded with cars with some of the cars coming into effect at one point before Shamrock ended things with a steel chain.

""Rights To The DX Name"": X-Pac & Road Dogg vs Billy Gunn & Chyna. The stipulation to this match was that the winning team would get the rights to use the DX name. Anyways, this was the surprise of the night as everyone put forth a good effort & delivered a match that would have came off as a filler but made it fun to watch with moments like the interaction between Gunn/Dogg & even Chyna/X-Pac as we see Chyna dominate with her strength.

Fully Loaded Strap Match: The Rock vs Triple H. The winner of this match would face the WWF Champion at SummerSlam. This was a different strap match than most fans tend to expect as this didn't have the ""touch the four corners rule"" with the way to win being by pinfall/submission anywhere in the building. Out of all their matches, this was probably their stiffest match with both men using the leather strap at various times like Triple H choking Rock from the top turnbuckle along with one moment where Rock whipped Triple H in the chest with the strap that it made me cringe. The ending involving Billy Gunn didn't take away from this match that would have been worthy for Rock or HHH's DVD sets.

""End Of An Era"" First Blood Match: WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Undertaker. The climax of the Austin/McMahon feud as the stipulations here were that if Taker won, Austin couldn't get a title match ever again while if Austin won, McMahon would be forced to leave the WWF. Before the match, Vince McMahon decided to do commentary for this match. On top of that earlier in the night, both men were attacked & busted open by one another. This was a physical brawl between these two with both men selling the effect of their attack from earlier with Shane McMahon taking one of the hardest chairshots that I have ever seen in wrestling. Along with cameos from X-Pac, Triple H, The Rock & Vince McMahon, this was a wild encounter with a surprising aftermath to conclude one of the best feuds in WWF history.

In the end, there was only really one bad match on the card while the rest of the undercard also had some good matches along with progressing the storylines they were pushing at the time with the two main events being the highlights of this show so this is one I would check out if you find it at a cheap price.",1234224000,,5389,4.467479674796748

good hardcore action but their match at Summerslam was alot better. Bossman wins. ***1/4 (I Guess)

Kane V. Big Show

Horrible match. Show wins. 3/4*

Iron Circle Match:

Ken Shamrock V. Steve Blackman

this match was good I guess. There was no blood and no really big spots. Shamrock wins. The rating is N/A.

Road Dogg & X-Pac V. Billy Gunn & Chyna

Good match but pretty underwhleming with the Roadie (I mean Road Dogg) & X-Pax win. **3/4

Strap Match:

The Rock V. Triple H

Off night for both of these guys. This match was actually hard to watch. Triple H wins with the help of Billy Gunn. **3/4

End of An Era,First Blood Match for the WWF Championship:

""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (Champion) V. Undertaker

Good match that again was pretty underwhelming until the end. Austin makes Taker bleed and Vince McMahon can no longer run the WWF! ***1/2

Overall, a horrible show. Why is that ever time a Pay-Per-View comes to Western New York (Where I live) the shows suck.",1129507200,,1701,4.809027777777778
