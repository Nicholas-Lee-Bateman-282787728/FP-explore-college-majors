2461997,5,B000CEV3TQ,"My child loves this dvd and asks for it by saying A, E, I, O, U!  He's only 14 months!  We'd enjoyed another Plaza Sesamo dvd called ""Me Gusta Ser Yo"" and the characters he likes are in both dvds.  I highly recommend this cd because it is made for Spanish babies and not just translated from English to Spanish.  It makes a real difference, believe me.  In short, I highly recommend it:  Baby loves it and I love it too!",1328832000,,420,4.1234567901234565

2461999,5,B000CEV3TQ,"Completamente en Espanol. Si quiere que su nino aprenda rapidamente las letras, el video es excelente. Great video for kids to learn the letters in Spanish. The video is completely in Spanish. Awesome. My baby is almost 3 and she still loves it after watching it many times over and over again.",1307923200,8,294,4.673076923076923
2462000,4,B000CEV3TQ,"I bought quite a few of the Plaza Sesamo DVD's and my daughter has been fairly interested in them. She was afraid of a couple of the characters at first, but now they don't even phase her.",1182124800,,188,4.108108108108108
2462001,5,B000CEV3TQ,"Although these new Plaza Sesamo videos are not anything like they were when I was a child, (except the voice of the monsters are still Mexican.  However, not dubbed.), they do very well for children of this generation.  I bought this and Copa Sesamo for my daughter since both of her parents are bilingual, and we would like her to be the same: speak English and Castillian Spanish and not English and Spanglish.

Also, Plaza Sesamo deals with issues that relate more the the Latin American culture rather than the American culture, like Sesame Street is.",1150502400,20,555,4.760416666666667

8098629,5,B000CEV3TQ,"I am very pleased with this DVD. I wanted Sesame Street in Spanish so my daughter could learn the sounds and well as some of the language.  This DVD is in Spanish and plays on my Blue Ray/DVD player here in the USA. I stress that because another DVD I bought (in another language) will not play in my Blue Ray/DVD player.  This DVD also restarts automatically when it ends so you don't have to worry about restarting over and over for your little one.  It has a lot of the Sesame Street Characters from the USA, goes thru the whole alphabet saying the letter, sound and giving example of words starting with the letter. My 1.5 year old watches it and enjoys it, my husband and I enjoy it as well. It will be played a lot in this house!  Oh and it is Old School, not all the CD and flying fairies, it is very educational.",1388966400,4,820,4.170886075949367
8098630,5,B000CEV3TQ,"What can I say? This is a Sesame Street Workshop productions, and to find one that showcases Spanish was a struck of luck. There aren't many out there, which is a shame. I grew up with Plaza Sesamo, the Spanish version, and I am glad I can give my child wonderful memories too.",1388275200,,277,4.245283018867925
8098631,5,B000CEV3TQ,"Wonderful for little kids, were they can learn letters and simple words while they enjoy their favorite characters.very entertaining for kids.",1373673600,4,142,5.809523809523809
8098632,5,B000CEV3TQ,"Finally the characters, wit and educational value of the Sesame Street program has been applied to the Spanish Alphabet.  My Pre-Kinder class has learned a great deal from this video.",1358121600,3,183,5.1
8098633,5,B000CEV3TQ,I bought this dvd for my son who just turned 3.  We are raising him speaking only Spanish at home.  He loves it!  He had never been exposed to Plaza Sesamo before and now he LOVES Plaza Sesamo.  THis is a great way to teach the letters to your child.  Highly recommended.,1357776000,,271,4.134615384615385
8098634,3,B000CEV3TQ,We are a huge Sesame Street fan family. My daughter didn't like this video as much as the other Plaza Sesamo movies. I wish I could find Elmo's World in Spanish.,1354406400,,161,4.225806451612903
8098635,5,B000CEV3TQ,"This is Spanish Phonics! I don't have any more specific details to add! But my child and I both very much enjoy this video!! I hope they create more Spanish Videos to sell on Amazon! Me Gusta Ser Yo is our favorite, but, wow, this is fast becoming her new favorite! ; )
We need more of these videos! THey are incredible! I wonder if there is English captions for those difficult ""hard of Spanish"" instead of Hard of hearing? My TV is supposed to do fantastic stuff with Caption (So it says) but it seems to just put zero caption on any (ANY) of my spanish videos, except Disney's Tangled! That's awesome! Dubbed in Spanish! I Love it! I wonder if i can find more videos dub in Spanish on Amazon? ANy suggestions?",1328918400,4,712,4.32089552238806
