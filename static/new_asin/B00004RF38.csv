Humphrey, Mike Hamer, Ed Fridd and Co.

show of all how to handle kids, the

Possum Lodge way! Yikes! A long running

show that actually started as a comedy

skit on 'Smith and Smith' back in 1979.

It all went horribly wrong (or right!)

since then. A Canadian comedy classic

on the Comedy Central of Canada show.

Outstanding! And clean enough to be

shown on Public TV without losing it's

originality, et, al. Pick Up On It!",1149638400,,467,4.506024096385542

They watched it over and over again and now between the 3 of us, their kids don't know which way to turn!!!  Every parent or parent-to-be should view this video.  Had ALOT of great ideas to get back at your kids!!!!  I'd love to see a Parenting II or Red Parenting Guide for Teenagers!!!!  Thanks Red...You've come through again...",1027641600,2,405,4.405405405405405
7921252,5,B00004RF38,"Red Green, handyman extraordinare, hilariously gives his advice (as well as the advice from other members of Possum Lodge) about parenting - even though he is not a parent himself.  Nephew Harold is as nerdy, (yet funny!) as ever.  The snowball revenge is awesome.  However, my favorite sketches are from ex-con Mike Hamar in his ""Mike's Teen Talk"" segments.  This will leave you in stitches!",1004054400,2,392,4.984615384615385
7921253,5,B00004RF38,"It's amazing to see what kind of good fortune can befall an accident. Such was the case for Steve Smith's Red GReen Show, which started out as a temporary project for Smith while he waited for the ""real show""  he was planning, and is now heading into its tenth season. Not a parent  himself, Red seems to think he's an authority on the subject, probably  because childhood is something he can understand and with which he can  identify.
One can also tell that, though he puts on the front of ultimate  manliness, Red really does listen to his wife Bernice. For example, when  Red makes a girl's bedroom set out of old tires, he thinks he's got the  needs and desires of the typical girl all figured out. Also figuring  strongly into Red's understanding of parenting is his relationship with  Harold. No doubt, he views Harold as the rsult of how to completely foul up  the parenting process, but there is also a grudging respect on red's part  for Harold's handling of teenhood, of being bullied, and of outsmarting the  smarter.
This is a wonderful video, one which true Possum Lodge members  or Possum Lodge wannabes cannot afford to be without.",963619200,14,1147,4.646766169154229
