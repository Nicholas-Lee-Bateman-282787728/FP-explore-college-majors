For years, he and staff members he has mentored have advocated and utilized a 1-4 set ""X"" attack. The attack is simple, sound, and time tested utilizing principles laid out in detail. For any coach that has ever questioned his approach to attacking a zone, and those who are comfortable in their methodology, this video is a resource. Coach Brown was a 2005 Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor, this presentation serves as evidence to that distinction.",1376438400,,615,4.757009345794392

Unless you want to hear him give his opinions on former NBA teams and players. He may have other recordings that are good but this one isn't.",1342137600,,318,4.316666666666666
