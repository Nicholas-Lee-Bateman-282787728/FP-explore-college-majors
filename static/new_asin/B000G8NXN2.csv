8129566,2,B000G8NXN2,"This is a low budget version of Tyler Perry's Temptation. Though I gave it two stars, I actually enjoyed it because I fully understood the message that was being conveyed and it was true to life. The quality is definitely one that looks like someone is filming it from their personal camera. But I do suggest it if you enjoy black independent films!",1379808000,,349,4.555555555555555
8129567,5,B000G8NXN2,Astounding!  I enjoyed all of the movie.  Wonderfully done.  This writer should be in Hollywood.  I loved everything about it.,1356739200,2,126,5.15
8129568,3,B000G8NXN2,"The movie low budget as if someone is standing in the street or some kind of area filming this,the sound is the same way,but overall the movie had a sad hard learned truth in the story line,could be very educational to both sexes!!",1354147200,,231,4.395348837209302
8129569,1,B000G8NXN2,"Poorly filmed for a technical perspective, and the story was poorly written. Amateur-level acting with poor direction.  Even if you are extremely bored, do not waste your time watching this movie.",1255305600,2,196,5.32258064516129

8129571,1,B000G8NXN2,"No Stars not even one from this movie, but I'm gonna be nice and give one star for effort. The actors and actresses weren't even trying to act. You are sooo right, whomever did the first comment. The movie was nothing like I thought. At all. The plot was all screwed up. I thought it was about her getting with another guy because of her boyfriend sexual performance, and possibly going back to him at the end, it was about that, but there was some scenes where you're like, where the heck did this come from? (I'm talking about the brother killing the sister's husband, and the mother getting beat up. That was a little extra. The only thing that was important was when the girl thought she was going to get over on her man and she ended up being screwed by another guy. Very bad. Sad scene. Ended off sad. but I would not tell anyone about this movie. At all. Not all-independent movies are bad. But this movie was.",1164758400,5,917,4.337209302325581
8129572,1,B000G8NXN2,"Okay, I got duped on this here movie. This movie is so bootleg it's not even funny. I can see why I'm the first person to review this beyond low budget movie. I mean the camera man was even featured in this film. There was one scene where I saw the camera man's shadow. I couldn't believe it so I rewinded it back. The background music kept cutting off too soon, the acting was atrocious. They kept pausing as if they couldn't remember their lines and they had to think about it before they said it. I can't even rate this a one star cause it was just that dumb but I have too.",1163894400,8,577,4.0701754385964914
