8192768,5,B000PNPCE6,"Fabian Forte has often gotten short-changed by critics as an actor, but he's nothing short of amazing here!  In this - sadly - seldom-seen film by independent producer-director Burt Topper, Fabian blows his 'good-guy' image out of the water as a heroin-addicted drifter with a past, who stumbles onto a phony ""evangelist"" (Tony Russel), who promotes 'Matthew' (Fabian) as ""the son of Jesus"" from small-time tent-shows and into super-stardom.  The entire cast, including Nai Bonet, Larry Bishop and Casey Kasem (as Russel's somewhat bewildered 'yes-man') do great work, but it's Fabian who'll knock your socks off.  His scenes of addiction and withdrawal are nothing short of harrowing, and you believe him every step of the way, as the film unfolds to it's inevitable conclusion.
If you ever get the chance to see ""The Soul Hustler"" (also known as ""The Day The Lord Got Busted""), don't miss this riveting, but little-known, film.",1480204800,,929,5.139072847682119
