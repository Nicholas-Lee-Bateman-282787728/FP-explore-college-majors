8750151,2,B01BHD9KAY,"This movie was released in 1944 and is in Black & White and of poor quality. I would say classic deception is a foot here. A Nazi spy passes himself off as an optometrist in San Francisco's waterfront district. Someone robs him of his codebook, and he must get it back. It stars John Carradine.",1464048000,2,294,4.363636363636363
