2331866,5,B0009X4YTG,"This is the first season of this fascinating and entertaining television program about science and scientists.  It presents a different perspective of many famous (and some not very well known) scientific ideas, experiments, discoveries and advances and the people responsible for them.  There is more of an onus on the darker/creepier side than you'd typically find in a history book, and while it is served up in documentary style, it also is put forward in a story telling manner and is portrayed through dramatizations by actors.  It is both educational and entertaining.",1349136000,5,575,5.228260869565218
2331867,5,B0009X4YTG,"I learned things about heroes and leaders in our world from the past; that i didn't even think about them knowing; i learned some of them were pioneers in their field of endeavor, though not famous for these little known facts that this show talks about.  Here was time well spent.  Takaluksee, truly, mmgru",1348272000,,307,4.666666666666667
2331868,5,B0009X4YTG,If your into science and shock this is for you be ready test everything the history books told you this is not for the closed minded and it's very entertaining,1337558400,,159,4.333333333333333
2331869,5,B0009X4YTG,"John Noble (From Fringe, Walter Bishop) is the perfect host for this quirky science show.  I hope it does get renewed for another season because I have enjoyed every episode. Each episode presents three different stories in the history of science, each story is voiced by John Noble very well.  The show is not for the faint of heart and talks about very controversial things that happened in science that most people have never heard of.  If you enjoy a good mystery and science, then give this series a chance.",1317772800,15,512,4.666666666666667

2331881,5,B0009X4YTG,"I really liked the entire series, but I was really after the one about Hedy Lamarr, and her inventions that nobody took seriously at the time because a. she was a woman, and b. she was so physically beautiful. I really wish the whole series was available.",1428710400,2,255,4.446808510638298

2331885,5,B0009X4YTG,"Great serious, well researched and crafted with only a small percentage of suposition and waffle compared to most of these types of shows - the only worry is will they release the rest of the series on DVD - we are seeing these types of shows only being released on the internet - which is a real shame for collectors.",1411516800,,318,4.316666666666666
2331886,5,B0009X4YTG,Loved it! Can't wait for the next season.,1411257600,,41,4.25
2331887,5,B0009X4YTG,"This series is beyond awesome.  It's stories a science gone wrong or science doing a wrong, however the scientists did not usually start their work will ill intents.  I learned so much about the past watching this, things I had no idea had even happened.  What's also startling is that these little known stores are at the core of technologies or events that to this day effect our daily lives, it's beyond fascinating.  And the series has great style, very entertaining and fun to watch.

Recommended to ANYONE, except people who just hate to learn things as they are entertained.",1399075200,3,581,4.77
2331888,3,B0009X4YTG,"First, to be honest, the thing I liked most about this three season series is John Noble, one of my favorite actors. He does a good job of narrating this 'short story' format of scientific discoveries. These are quirky little blurbs more than anything else - from what really happened to Einstein's brain to Missing Cosmonauts - did the Russians really send humans into space; humans who died in space?

These are indeed more 'short stories' than anything else, but the series was interesting, and led me to look up some of the rather esoteric stories to gain more knowledge on the subject. This isn't brain science, but if you have a passing interest in science, this may very well be a place to start - more interesting tidbits that may encourage further research into items you find most interesting.

Overall? Enjoy with an open mind!",1394841600,,838,4.732876712328767

2331900,3,B0009X4YTG,"Sort of an interesting show, much of the stuff we have seen and heard of already with more in depth and accurate information than this show has.
One thing that bugged me a little was some of the mis-information. For example the one episode they are talking about Edison and Westinghouse competing with electricity. Edison D/C and Westinghouse A/C, they basically said Westinghouse invented A/C current, when he did not, Nikola Tesla did and Nikola worked with Westinghouse to make it available, didn't even mention Tesla at all. There are other things, but little misfacts like that make the information in this show pretty shotty as it presents itself as a documentary, but it is just another in a line of documentaries with false facts or agendas, Ancient Aliens is another that comes to mind.",1393459200,,795,4.896296296296296
2331901,5,B0009X4YTG,If you are in to Sci Fi and conspiracy theories this is the show to watch. Great take on some  Interesting Ways Of thinking.,1393372800,,124,4.166666666666667
2331902,1,B0009X4YTG,I knew the stories that were contained in the first episode.  The writers had a long build up to the information then failed to deliver on content.  It was all teaser and then partial information.  Granted that some of the additional information they left out is sensationalized and unsubstantiated but this is Sci-fi channel; they could at least have given the information to you as a believe-it-or-not fact.,1393372800,,409,4.985294117647059
2331903,3,B0009X4YTG,"An excellent re-hash of stuff I have seen elsewhere.  Nothing really astounding or new.  BUT it is an excellent introduction to the investigation of what seem to be paranormal events.  Perhaps I am just jaded, having seen or read so much on the edge between what is ordinary and what is extra-ordinary.  I was expecting new material and was disappointed.  But I don't want this to turn into a rant.  This was well paced and well written.",1393113600,,437,4.6103896103896105
2331904,5,B0009X4YTG,This show is both scary and true. John Noble is just the right actor to narrate. He does an excellent job!,1392854400,,106,4.095238095238095
2331905,4,B0009X4YTG,"Interesting stuff dramatized for our entertainment. I love learning about people and things that are so much different than my everyday, not so interesting life.",1392076800,,161,5.48

2331907,5,B0009X4YTG,This show is very entertaining and unbelievable. I found myself researching a lot of the episode's facts. You should do the same. The only bad thing about this show is that I wish there were more episodes to watch. I love this show and recommend it to everyone.,1391817600,,261,4.458333333333333
2331908,1,B0009X4YTG,Sorry but I thought it was ill acted and boring I did not finish watching.  Probably because I grew up in the 50's  It  was not like that and over acted.,1391558400,3,153,3.870967741935484
2331909,2,B0009X4YTG,"I was intrigued by the title, and eagerly began watching the first episode.  Unbelievably boring and the attempts to make it ""suspenseful (oooh) were laughable or maybe ""groanable""  would be a better word. (Don't you think ""groanable""should be a word?)
Save your time and/or you hard earned bucks.",1391212800,,297,5.166666666666667

2331931,1,B0009X4YTG,"I guess one hits the bottom of the barrel when one does the equivalent of channel surfing on insomnia nights.  Not only are the ""events"" over-hyped the dramatization even makes the history channel look good.",1389657600,2,207,4.914285714285715
2331932,4,B0009X4YTG,"Well, it is kind of like a twighlight zone theme, but in a more educational manner.  Interesting and enjoyable to watch. Well done!",1389398400,,131,4.695652173913044
2331933,5,B0009X4YTG,This show was highly entertaining! the history was very interesting! I also really enjoyed the renactment was not your usual bad acting but rather it did not take itself too seriously and is hilarious! Love this show!!,1389139200,,218,4.918918918918919
2331934,4,B0009X4YTG,All open minded people should see things like this with an open mind..Like to see season 2 if available. Tanx.,1387843200,,110,4.55
2331935,4,B0009X4YTG,It's a bit cheesy but the content is super interesting and the dramatization is pure comedy. I would definitely recommend this series.,1387238400,,134,5.136363636363637
2331936,3,B0009X4YTG,I love John Noble. I thought it would be more interesting. I only watched one episode. I might watch the rest.,1386979200,,110,4.285714285714286
2331937,5,B0009X4YTG,This show tells you the history that school doesn't.  Excellent presentation and acting.  This show really makes you think about what the government and news shows are not telling us.,1386892800,3,183,5.066666666666666
2331938,4,B0009X4YTG,"Basically, a decent show; interesting information, but superficial in its reporting. Seems to just skim the surface with the more sensational aspects of cases and leaves out the real ""meat"". Good for entertainment value only. Any serious study of the incidents would need to be much more in-depth and detailed. I actually wish someone would make such a series, but that's not Hollywood's style.",1386460800,,394,5.171875
2331949,5,B0009X4YTG,"Entertaining and educational, they will tell you the things that your school teachers never would!
Great family show too, in my opinion, not too ""dark"" for my 9 yr old son to enjoy as well. Recommend!",1385856000,,200,4.583333333333333
2331950,4,B0009X4YTG,"A very interesting show...IF what it says is true is really true, it has some very unusual stories to tell, which most people are probably unaware, again IF really true.  The narrator is a bit off the wall, but so are the stories...found the science stories fascinating, especially about Tesla & Einstein's brain.",1385683200,,313,4.90566037735849
2331951,2,B0009X4YTG,I couldn't get into this.  It was too slow and boring. I was hoping it would be interesting but its not for me.,1383523200,,111,3.8260869565217392
2331952,4,B0009X4YTG,"This is great for conspiracy loves as well as though who love learning the fringe sciences.
While i find the visuals effect a little off, the shows content  makes up or that.",1383091200,,174,4.4375
2331953,5,B0009X4YTG,"Very interesting and well worth watching. If you like this type of genre, you won't want to miss this one.",1383091200,,106,4.35
2331954,4,B0009X4YTG,"Dark Matters is not for the squeamish. It presents historically accurate stories that are often shocking, surprising or horrendous. I recommend it for adult viewers, but not for kids under 12.",1379116800,,192,5.225806451612903
2331955,5,B0009X4YTG,"Love this show, the man who narrates it is in Fringe, Love that show too!  It has very interesting odd science facts, if you like mysteriese at the museum then you will love this show!",1378512000,,184,4.257142857142857
2331956,5,B0009X4YTG,This movie describes about genius people of all the time. It also includes extraordinary scientific inventions that seem hard to discover.,1377907200,,138,5.619047619047619
2331957,5,B0009X4YTG,"This is an excellent series for those who are interested in lesser known aspects of science history.  While being entertained, viewers learn a lot about historical figures they thought they knew.",1377734400,,195,5.290322580645161
2331958,5,B0009X4YTG,"This DVD was pretty good! As a ""Fringe"" fan I thought it was right up my alley! John Noble is amazing!",1375833600,,102,3.9047619047619047
2331969,4,B0009X4YTG,"The info is what I have heard for years, but very briefly.  With this series, it becomes more in depth with truth.",1374796800,,114,4.181818181818182
2331970,3,B0009X4YTG,I was not that impressed with this series at all.  It would have been nice if the episodes played without interruption.  Amazon really needs to fix the problem of a dropped signal.  Its not my internet provider as their customer service suggested.,1374796800,,247,4.833333333333333
2331971,5,B0009X4YTG,I loved each of the episodes. Would love to see more if it is made available on amazon prime instant,1373932800,,100,4.05

2331973,4,B0009X4YTG,"Personally, any show covering the weird and strange immediately captures my interest, being one who is weird and strange, myself.  I found ""Dark Matters"" particularly entertaining as far as a ""strange but true"" show is concerned, partly due to the narration of ""Lord Denethor""/""that crazy, yet genius father/scientist in ""Fringe"".  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five was due to the typical dumbing down of any information for mass consumption.....it insults my intelligence as much as being served Gerber's baby food for a main entre at a four star restaurant insults my palate.  Either way, despite the simplistic presentation of odd-but-true facts, I found the show very enjoyable overall.",1373500800,,704,5.267857142857143

 So good that they better put out more!!",1373414400,,138,4.3076923076923075
2331975,3,B0009X4YTG,Interesting to watch but ultimately like an article in the Weekly World News; namely TOO little substance. It seems that these episodes should've been fleshed out more either by doing 1 topic per episode instead of three.,1372636800,,221,5.0
2331976,4,B0009X4YTG,"Nicely done series, explaining different bizarre events and their causes. Introduces the viewer to different men of science many who started out with faulty ideas and strange experiments. Events are dramatized to keep the viewers interest and to give an historic sense to the topic.",1371686400,,282,5.288888888888889
2331977,5,B0009X4YTG,All interesting stuff! And it's all true!! Very good show to watch by my self or with my husband. But not something I would watch with the kids!,1370649600,,144,4.178571428571429
2331978,1,B0009X4YTG,"If you like that one guy from Fringe and think him narrating would be awesome, if you like terrible acting and writing during the reenactments and if mundane ""strange"" stories are something that you like, then congrats!

2331993,5,B0009X4YTG,"Being one who independently researches the obscure and taboo, the dark and twisted, much of what is presented in this show may seem far-fetched to most who accept our world as bland and boring, lacking anything worthwhile, yet for me, it makes perfect sense.
A lot of very dark history to our scientific history. Things that shouldn't make sense in any normal way shows that ""normalcy"" can be a byproduct of the surreal. Scientific projects gone entirely awry, and others that were successful (for a time being), and others that I've read documented proof on some of the stuff on this show, including the mysterious object known only as ""The Bell"" and how it had permanently disappeared, seemingly, from existence. And, though I already knew about a mysterious object falling over Russia and exploding before touching the ground, I never thought it could've been connected to Nikola Tesla. That simply adds a new layer of peculiarity to the whole mystery in itself.
Bonus point for the show: John Noble being the narrator (he was one of the best characters in Fringe as Walter Bishop, so no wonder I got excited to see him hosting this show)!",1367971200,3,1142,4.831632653061225
2331994,4,B0009X4YTG,"Precisely... I adore leaning those odd and strange factoids with well researched and deftly explained details. Anything that makes me sit and gape in wonder is decent in my world. Although the ""re-enactment"" scenes are done in a simplistic style that I don't find as interesting as the information itself, I can look past it. If they did an overhaul of that one element, I do believe this could be a 5 star series. I also wouldn't mind fleshing out the stories a bit more, as well. Do give it a try though.",1367625600,,506,4.451612903225806
2331995,5,B0009X4YTG,"Great series.  I learned a lot of things, and discovered a few more mysteries that I need to uncover, I recommend this series to any conspiracy theory enthusiast.",1367452800,,162,4.785714285714286

One of the sections in this 3-part coverage concerned Thomas Edison's battle with Westinghouse over DC vs AC electricity.  In order to prove that his DC was better (safer), Edison partnered with a man and they, eventually, gained permission to perform the first death by electric chair.  I never knew this.  It was a horrible blemish on Edison, and one that affects somewhat the way I now view him.

The show presents the stories well, with enough detail to be fascinating.  I didn't see the usual showmanship that goes so far overboard with these types of shows.  What I saw was a true representation of the events backed with the facts that were available.

Excellent first show!",1367366400,2,870,4.708609271523179

2332019,5,B0009X4YTG,"I've watched every show of both seasons and these are must see tv. Each show could be a starter for the discussion of the ethics of science and politics. The show does a very good job keeping the politics out of it, just presenting the stories based on the facts and letting the viewer decide. I thank the show's producers for making a very entertaining and informative show. Sometimes it's a little funny too. John Noble (Fringe) is the perfect host. He does a great job on each episode. I can't recommend this highly enough.

Note: I think there is a comedian at Amazon or the people who put out the DVD. It says with ""astonishing virtual set"".... Ahhh. No. The sets look like virtual sets, but in a way it's endearing to the show. I really like the ""sterile"" look of the sets. Somehow it makes the stories better.",1363737600,5,816,4.44
