5880009,5,B00DZ48IH0,Excellent.  Video and audio is very good.  Great film noir.  Each story is different and keeps your attention to the very end to see what happens.  In the Hitchcock genre.,1404086400,5,171,4.6
5880010,5,B00DZ48IH0,"These movies, the ones starring Richard Dix, bring unexpected and unforeseen solutions.  They keep me on the edge of my seat.  I have not watched the dvd set yet, but I bought the movies because I have already seen them all and I find them fascinating.",1403913600,,252,4.456521739130435
5880011,2,B00DZ48IH0,"First of all please note that the 4 disks are home made DVD-R format.  My mistake was reading all the info on the left side and not seeing that someone had posted at the top of their ad that there were in fact home made DVD-Rs.  I have probably one of the first Sony DVD players and it plays all the factory pressed DVD's just fine.  These DVD-R's became pixelated, or large video blocks and eventually they just locked up in my player.

So, after a trip to a friend's house he was able to play them on his flat screen monitor and that's when you can see that they're all very grainy and looked like they were copied off of a VHS or Beta tape.  Also, we noticed at the bottom right hand corner a large logo would pop up from time to time and my friend mentioned these were probably laid over to cover up another logo like TCM, or whatever station was airing them at the time they were copied.

Finally, one more gripe.  The so called MP3 CD that is supposed to contain a collection of Whistler Radio Shows was another HUGE disappointment!!!  Instead of The Whistler it was filled with Ronald Regan Speeches!

My suggestion, save your money and wait until Columbia Studios actually digs into their vaults and releases the original prints in a quality befitting DVD.",1402012800,38,1264,4.390557939914163
5880012,5,B00DZ48IH0,"I have seen all of the films and i can say that they are  excellent.
People who love film noir should should check these out as they are very good.",1401235200,4,147,3.9
5880013,5,B00DZ48IH0,"Been a fan of TW for years.  There are 8 shows in 4 CDs. Visual  and audial quality are pretty good. The seller also threw in a Whistler on radio cd containing 78 mp3 files. Great for listening at night. If you are a fan of TW or Richard Dix, these are for you.",1398470400,,261,3.814814814814815
5880014,5,B00DZ48IH0,"The Whistler is in my opinion is one of the best radio shows.  At this time I have not listened to all of these.  I also like the movies,
they probably not considered cinema classics, I Like them.
Chris.",1390608000,7,203,4.17948717948718
5880015,5,B00DZ48IH0,"This is a top of the line dvd set.  I have looked for this for years, and this was the first that I could find it, so I snatched it up.  If you like the Whistler, you will love this set.  Picture and Audio quality are excellent!",1389916800,9,228,3.8085106382978724
5880016,5,B00DZ48IH0,"Man, if you like the good ol' stuff, snap this up. All eight Whistler movies from the 1940s, including the four directed by William Castle, plus 230 hours worth of Whistler radio programs. This is a collection to enjoy for the rest of your life.",1383350400,14,245,4.466666666666667
5880017,4,B00DZ48IH0,"These were good quality, fun movies on a par with Universal's Inner Sanctum Mystery series. Several were even better than the more well-known Lon Chaney films.",1381968000,4,159,5.153846153846154
5880018,5,B00DZ48IH0,"OnesMedia is selling these films at a very nice price.
Eight films on four DVD-Rs for $25.
Picture quality ranges from OK to pretty good, but OnesMedia did a heroic job of cleaning up the sound.
No subtitles, but I wasn't expecting any at this price.
These are DVD-Rs, but I had no problem playing them.

The Whistler is not really a B-Movie Detective.
He's a mysterious character in a black cape who prowls in the shadows and narrates this series of B-Movies produced between 1944 and 1948.
An observer of crime.
Richard Dix starred in seven of the eight films, before ill-health forced him to retire.
Dix didn't play the actual Whistler - the Whistler is anonymous and mysterious.

Based on a popular radio show, samples of which are included on a bonus mp3.

Since I wrote this review, ""Choice Collection"" has issued these films on eight DVD-Rs for $15 each. That works out to
Eight films on eight DVD-Rs for $120 vs Eight films on four DVD-Rs for $25 on OnesMedia..

I haven't seen the ""Choice Collection"" DVD-Rs so I am not qualified to comment on them, other than to point out that they are rather pricey.
Also, in my experience DVD-Rs do not have subtitles
This statement is based on experience - Warner Archive Collection DVD-Rs do not have subtitles, even though many of the same films do when shown on TCM

GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVD
A-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.
B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.
Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)

PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE
- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves. Still viewed with suspicion by the police.
- The Falcon has a shady past (never quite explained).
- Arsene Lupin is an unreformed jewel thief who sometimes helps the police if it serves his ends.
- The Crime Doctor used to be an Organized Crime Boss. He never actually reformed, but was conked over the head and woke up with amnesia.

I LOVE A MYSTERY
Three films, 1945-1946 starring Jim Bannon and Barton Yarborough
The last but least of the B-Movie Detective series.

PHILIP MARLOWE / SAM SPADE
These two detectives were the most famous Private Eyes of all time, but they don't really belong on this list.
They were A-Movie detectives all the way:
- 1931 The Maltese Falcon: Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade
- 1936 Satan Met a Lady: Warren William as Sam Spade - adapted from 'The Maltese Falcon' by Dashiell Hammett
- 1941 The Maltese Falcon: Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade
- 1944 Murder, My Sweet: Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'Farewell, My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler
- 1946 The Big Sleep: Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 Lady in the Lake: Robert Montgomery as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 The Brasher Doubloon: George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'The High Window"" by Raymond Chandler

But two Philip Marlowe novels were adapted as B-Movies for other detectives:
- 1942 Time to Kill (Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne) - adaptated from 'The High Window' by Raymond Chandler
- 1942 The Falcon Takes Over (George Sanders as The Falcon)) - adapted from 'Farewell My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler

5880019,4,B00DZ48IH0,"At present I have watched only four of the eight movies.  I cannot access the second movie on each disc, but I believe this is problem with my DVD player rather than with the discs.  One of the four movies I've seen had a few minor defects, brief instances where pixels appeared on the screen.  Otherwise the movies fully matched my expectations.",1425254400,,346,4.548387096774194

5880022,5,B00DZ48IH0,"What a nice set for Whistler fans. All eight movies AND a cd of the radio shows. This is not a big studio release, but rather a well put together collection by fellow fans wishing to preserve the series. The movies are packaged on four discs (two per disc), each printed in full color and tucked in a nice flip case. The cover art shows the various original movie posters. The cd of radio shows comes in a separate slimline plastic case (not a typical jewel case). The discs all played just fine in my Panasonic Blu-Ray player and there's a simple startup menu to chose which film you want to watch.

8599397,5,B00DZ48IH0,"While some of the films are better than others, a few are absolute masterpieces, and shows that great things can come out of the B units of the major studios. Some reviewers indicate that they were upset by the quality, but for me, this added an atmospheric almost ""drive-in"" like quality to the effect of the film. Certainly, the prints are not perfect, but unless you want to spend a ton of money buying each film individually, you are getting a great deal. On a medium sized digital T.V., it plays very nicely, and the sound quality is excellent. I've watched three of the four DVD's (6 of the films), and found something to enjoy in all of them. ""The Power of the Whistler"" is so far the best of the bunch, one I rated a ""9"" out of ""10"" on IMDB, and added it to my list of one of the top 100 films of that year.",1468368000,2,815,4.1645569620253164
