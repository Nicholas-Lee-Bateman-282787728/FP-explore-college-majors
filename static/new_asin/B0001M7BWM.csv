2015438,5,B0001M7BWM,"My family and I absolutely LOVED both of the Best of Donny & Marie Volumes.

Volume 1 has to be my most favourite of the two. The Perils of Marie skits are absolutely hilarious.!

These tapes are great for family viewing of all ages and certainly do bring back some great memories from the Greatest (in my opinion) showbiz family ever.

My only wish is that they would release the whole Donny & Marie Shows on DVD for sale, that would be a really great collection to have.",1128902400,4,472,4.340909090909091
2015439,2,B0001M7BWM,"i was  excited to find out there were a couple of tapes for this show floating around.

i was a huge fan as a kid back in the mid 70s, but i have to agree with the previous reviewer that this 'Best Of...' compilation is curiously disappointing.

while its great to see faces like Paul Lynde, Bob Hope, Ted Knight, and the rest again, most of the skits are quite painful to endure.

That is until Marie inevitabley cracks up.

She and her brother had a tremendous chemistry together, and they almost always looked like they were having a lot of fun.

for me, seeing them just relate to one another, especially in the opening segments, was worth the purchase.

but i would really rather have a good multi-disc DVD set.

wouldn't have to be a full season set, but something patterned after either Shout Factorys Here's Lucy set, or The Sonny & Cher Ultimate Collection.

3 discs, with an assortment of clips spanning the different seasons- hopefully with more representation of the first season, which is not the case with the two VHS tapes.

i wouldn't even go with complete episodes, since as has already been said, the scripted comedy bits (if the ones on these tapes are any indication) are now more cringe worthy than amusing.

If i were producing it, i would dedicate one disc for  clips of a good selection of the opening numbers, ice skating, the opening dialouge bit, the closings along with non-skit guest star appearences.

i would use disc two for a selection of complete musical numbers, and disc three could be reserved for solo skits and skits involving guest stars.

at least, thats what i'd like to see.

getting back to these tapes though,  the majority of clips on these tapes are NOT from 76/77 but rather from the tail end of the shows run (at which point the show had lost much of its popularity and Marie had a hairstyle that looked like she was 40 years old and running for a seat on the PTA board) .

about a good 60% of all the material is from the shows last season, and only 10 minutes or so, if that much, are from the first (and most popular) season.

i have to wonder if many tapes from that early 76 season actually even exist anymore?

while a disappointment, it was still a kick to see again because afaik, this show has never ever been syndicated and i haven't seen this stuff in almost 30 years.

a truly good collection for the shows remains to be produced though, and hopefully it will show up on DVD in the not too distant future.

D&M and this show were a major pop culture phenomenon of the Bicentennial era, and deserve a good DVD release as much as any other 70s era tv property.",1105228800,7,2619,4.4258872651356995
2015440,1,B0001M7BWM,"I purchase Vol. 1 & 2 . because I use to be a huge fan of the show when I was younger.  Watching it I couldn't believe what D & M  picked to be their best clips(???) I would have to say the best, (if I had to pick) was of Andy Williams,(thats it!!) Other then that, It was very corny and it didn't hold my interest.  The two video's were only from 1976 & 77.  I'm surprized !! Again, when I watch any of the Sonny & Cher Show or the Starky & Hutch oldies, now they bring back a lot of happy memory's of that time period & it was so much fun watching it!! I really thought I would have the same feeling watching these two video's of  D & M considering I use to be pasted to the tv set when they were on!
I'm disappointed!! Out of the full four years this is what they came up with (???)
In my opinion, D & M should of put clips together of their famous guest stars. Like Cher, Englebert Humperdink, etc. etc...
Just my opinion!!",1081728000,3,927,3.8835978835978837

From what I remember & Donny says in the 1st season episode ""We have a whole hour."" The complete opening credits (animated sequence), ""It takes Two"" segments, solos & music videos w/flower or seagull introduction, & more comedy sketches, are all missing.

I don't know why it had to cost the same as purchasing a 20-30 episode of a tv season from any series & why each episode edited & chopped in half couldn't have just been put onto 1 disc.

2015578,4,B0001M7BWM,"This 2-disc DVD set features only four episodes of the 1976-79 ABC-TV family show ""Donny and Marie"". One episode from each year, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979. The usual fare, it stars the singing brother and sister duo of the famed Osmond family, along with special guest stars appearing in some of the comedy skits. The first couple of shows features the regular cast of ice-skaters, the Ice Vanities, back when the show was produced in Hollywood by Sid and Marty Krofft Productions. The other two shows were produced in their home state of Utah. The Osmond family took over production after it was moved to their new home studios. The Ice Vanities ice-skaters were dropped from the cast.
However, after looking at these shows, I'm a bit surprised that these shows actally clocked in at approximately 35 minutes for each episode. I mean, these were one-hour shows when they originally aired on ABC prime-time on Friday nights. So I believe there were other sketches in these shows that may have been edited out (not just the commercials). If I'm correct, please let me know.
Despite that, ""Donny and Marie"" is still fun to watch. I can't wait until ""The Best of Donny and Marie: Volume 2"" comes out on DVD soon.",1202601600,,1209,4.7075471698113205

I would say that if you are a huge fan of Donny and Marie, this DVD volume may be a 4-star or a 5-star rating.

I remember watching several variety shows during this time period -The Carol Burnett Show, Sonny & Cher, Tony Orlando & Dawn Show, etc, and I vaguely remember this show.  I did not however remember it being this bad.  The jokes are really, really bad.  This collection supposedly has the best four shows of the whole run.  Oh my goodness, I don't think I saw one skit that was good.  I'm trying to think -I think a few of the songs were okay -they were known for their singing after all - but that was not enough to redeem this dvd collection.  Especially after watching Carol Burnett, who had some of the funniest skits of any variety show, and even Sonny & Cher, who were also a bit campy, even they were far more engaging that these Donny & Marie shows.  Very, very disappointing.  I must have liked it back then because I was at an age when I thought Donny was cute.

'why was this compliation set so heavily edited?'

 All the shows seemed incomplete and kind of stuck in a half way house, between the best of and a compilation set.

 The scenes that are there are wonderful and really capture the energy, talent and enthusiasm of D & M, but the editing didn't really capture the  spirit, pace and esscence of the original airings of the show.

 For example, I was so looking forward to that wonderful duet Donny did with Cheryl Ladd on season 3 ' I Just Want To Be Your Everything' and D & M's fab duet 'You Bring Me Sunshine' from season 4. Also, the guest stars duets would have captured the spirit of what the show was all about: showcasing the current talent of the day. Those are just 2 examples of typical 'Donny & Marie' classic scenes that were missed out.

 I would like to se a COMPLETE set of the shows released. The times are right for this. I would be prepared to pay a higher price for complete unedited shows as that's what I remember and loved about the show. It was variety at its BEST!",1165017600,12,1280,4.278008298755187

2015696,3,B0001M7BWM,"Growing up as a kid in the 1970s, my siblings and I always looked forward to Sunday nights when we would gather in front of our TV set and watch our favorite foreign shows on Channel 7 one after the other. It started with The Muppet Show at 6pm, Donny and Marie, Mork and Mindy, Charlie's Angels and, finally, Three's Company.
Having complete sets of Three's Company and Charlie's Angels, it was, therefore, such a joy to finally learn that Donny and Marie would finally be released on DVD. Inspite of the fact that this DVD set was advertised as ""Volume 1"" I still bought the DVD because, for me, owning this set was still better than none. Viewing the 4 select episodes with my mom last weekend (like we did 30 years ago) was a nostalgic event. We enjoyed seeing Donny and Marie all over again at their prime singing, acting and dancing their hearts out. I also still clearly recall their wonderful performance of ""Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing"" which was thankfully included in Episode 2 of this set so seeing this performance all over again was pure joy. After viewing the 4 episodes on 2 discs, (I got this DVD together with Season 6 of Golden Girls), I wanted more! I felt really disappointed that for 4 episodes, I had to pay $20.00+ which, when compared to the $27.99 cost of the Golden Girls Season 6 containing 21 episodes, was really a rip-off. It would have been such a great buy if this set was called ""Donny and Marie: The Complete First Season"" containing ALL episodes. When will we see that day? I am sure the manufacturers of this set had their reasons for releasing such an incomplete set but to fans like us, there is just no excuse for depriving us of the joy in seeing the complete first season and the next 3 seasons! I appeal to the people behind this set to please release the complete 4 seasons because I assure you of our complete support in purchasing the sets. The Donny and Marie Show deserves to be seen again and again by our generation and future generations as well because this show was simply brilliant and is a shining example of what great entertainment is all about. I would rate this 5-stars if it was the complete first season but due to incompleteness, I rate it only 3-stars.",1164758400,44,2221,4.472906403940887
2015697,3,B0001M7BWM,"I've read most of the reviews and I too have mix feeling about this release. Being an Osmonds fan, of course I was thrill when I heard that The show was going to be brought out on DVD.

Although happy that it was finally released, but am disappointed with it.

You can easily put in 4 hours of material on one disc, but all we get is 1 hour of badly edited show, and a 'defect Slide- Show' as a Bonus. (Defect because when view as a slide show, the back-ground music stop and start with every slide, and is very irritating. I did not even bother viewing it.

I'd spend more money on the entired show -  un-edited, then to buy another future complilation like this.

I'm sure whether the reviews are bad or good, Osmonds fans will still want to buy this set. But I would not recommend this to other ""curious-70's show browser"".

Sorry Donny for being honest.",1163980800,6,857,4.291925465838509
2015717,5,B0001M7BWM,"As a father and accomplished musician myself, I was thrilled to finally get to see the amazingly talented duo of ""Donny & Marie"" once again in my home, this time to the delight of my own son as well.

I continue to stand in awe of just how incredibly talented they were, especially Donny.  This guy had, and has, it all.  An incredible singer with brilliant phrasing for motown, rock, ballads.  You name it, he can sing it.  And Marie, wow.  Very talented as well, and absolutely stunning!!  Always my definition of the perfect woman with her humor, looks and gracious disposition.

And, unlike the other reviewers, I don't mind the editing of the shows, I just wish they would have edited them differently, focusing more on the musical segments, particularly those with Donny & Marie together and solo, as well as the Osmond Brothers...and completely eliminating the vacuous guest stars and little brother Jimmy (Am I the only one who has always seen Jimmy as the musical equivalent of nails on a chalkboard?)

I just hope R2 releases all the shows on DVD sooner than later!!!!",1163376000,6,1078,4.721925133689839
2015718,1,B0001M7BWM,"I cannot tell you what a disappointment this DVD release is. I have been waiting anxiously for this show to be released on DVD. I was thrilled when I found out that the same company who put out the Tony Orlando & Dawn show was doing it. I was expecting the same top notch treatment for D&M. Not so. Talk about cutting corners. This is the best they could do? This DVD has so little on it and I feel ripped off having spent $30. If this set is what future volumes of the D&M show are going to be, I certainly will not be buying anymore. Not only that, I will be very careful when buying future releases from this company as well. What the hell happened? It is puzzling that Donny himself was very involved in this release. Donny, do you need the money so badly that you've resorted to ripping off your fans? Shame on you and a BIG shame on the company that put this piece of garbage out. To those who have not thrown their money away yet, take my word for it, don't bother.",1163289600,13,972,4.121052631578947
2015719,3,B0001M7BWM,"Must admit to being an Osmond since the early 70s, and as I am now living in China, I jumped at any chance to Donny and Marie perform.  After a 30 year wait, what one gets is hardly a best of collection, but 2 sample discs of 4 incomplete Donny and Marie shows.  I realise that Donny experienced royalty and cost issues when he tried to create a compilation disc set.  This compromise leaves fans wondering if the full collection of 72 episodes will ever be released on dvd.  All this aside, am glad to have a high quality reproduction on DVD, as the sound and the images are awesome!",1163116800,37,584,4.281818181818182
2015720,3,B0001M7BWM,"This was my favorite show from the seventies, as a kid I didn't want to miss it on Friday nights! I bought almost all of the shows in the past four years on video thanks to the internet. I hadn't seen the show (except in clips) since the 70's. I was very pleased when I heard it was coming out on DVD. BUT the four shows are EDITED. Up to 15 minutes on the 1979 show. What a disappointment. There are also no REAL special features. I believe all of this could have fit on one DVD! I don't believe Marie was involved at all in this project. I hope future volumes have more to offer. R2 Entertainment could have done better!!! I have their Tony Orlando & Dawn & The Captain & Tennille collections and they are better packages than this. This DVD was supposed to come out originally in April 2006 and after waiting all this time I expected a better collection. The sound is great as well as the DVD picture quality, but the editing and lack of special features prevents me from giving it 5 stars. The 1978 show is really from 1977, the 1977 show was actually aired in 1976. I don't like the false advertising. Don't manipulate the fans because we know better!! We are the people who made the show a ratings hit in the first place and will be buying this product. I prefer to buy the show in it's entirety or at least a season collection and not 4 episodes a year. What a shady way to make money on Osmond fans.",1162944000,11,1407,4.195571955719557
2015721,5,B0001M7BWM,"OK - so they are a little bit country, a little bit rock and roll, and perhaps a little bit cheesy - but this DVD set is a great example of those long gone big production 70's variety shows.  Lots of music - and all wonderfully remastered in 5:1 - and Donny and Marie look great.  They are terrific performers, and there is a long list of great guests.",1162857600,3,352,4.086956521739131
2015722,4,B0001M7BWM,"I waited a long time for this release.  Thanks to R2 Entertainment & esp. Donny for all his efforts for all the time and effort in bringing this wonderful show back in the spotlight. The show has never sounded better!  Awesome sound quality! I do wonder WHY the 4 shows were edited.  I thought these were going to be COMPLETE shows.  ARE THERE PLANS TO RELEASE THE COMPLETE SEASONS ON DVD?  And we really deserve some wonderful extras. Fans of the show would love to see some bonus extras.  Suggestions:  past interviews of how popular the show was in it's day(Barbara Walters, Johnny Carson-should be easy with R2 Entertainment owning the rights to Johnny's show), a natative with Donny & Marie, outtakes, the original ABC pilot, and D&M hosting the Mike Douglas show--this is where it all started).... If you were a fan of this wonderful variety show, you will love this release!  I highly recommend it!  I've watched mine 3 times already!  I'm just hoping the COMPLETE UNEDITED first season will come out soon!  Please?!!!",1162771200,8,1025,4.767045454545454
2015723,4,B0001M7BWM,"The dvd's are nice.  The music sounds great.  It Seems like parts of the show are missing.  I'm guessing they have been edited.  More extras would be nice if more dvd's come out.  When I try to play the slide show, the music stops and starts as the pictures change on both dvd's.  I'm not sure if this is happening to anyone else.  Being able to watch this show again is really ""cool"",  even if watching it back then wasn't cool.  It's a great show.  Some might say it's too sweet, too cute, and corny.  But I say, that's the whole point.  They knew it, we knew it, everyone knows it.  Still, the talent shines through.",1162339200,9,619,4.232758620689655
2015724,5,B0001M7BWM,"Donny and Marie at their best!  When Marie was only 16 and Donny 18, the talented brother and sister duo perform their famous, ""I'm a little bit country, I'm a little bit rock and roll"" concerts amd slapstick comedy skits. The numerous guest stars that appeared throughout the years (Bob Hope, Carl Reiner, Ruth Buzzi, Paul Lynde and Charo to name a few) make this DVD a treat to watch for all of those wanting a bit of nostalgia from the '70's. The Osmond Brothers and the Ice Vanities also make their appearances and add to the fun of this weekly variety show.  Take a trip back in time and enjoy this DVD for the whole family.  A Bonus Photo Gallery is included. But please, next time Donny-the whole season's shows and not the heavily edited ones?",1161907200,13,751,4.467153284671533

2015726,2,B0001M7BWM,"No one could best judge this series better than the child we all were when we gazed upon Donny and Marie's chemistry that I'm sure most of us wished we had with our own siblings. I was laughed at by my big brothers for crying when the show was over, every night for weeks. I got over the tears but found a calling in the profession of music and singing, as a grown up, because of their show. I would absolutely support the creation of a DVD of more of the basic series; not just what someone thought was good. I even enjoyed their take on a daytime show. I missed most of their shows due to my father being stationed in Germany as an MP for the Army. But I truly still love Donny and Marie. Give us more!!!",1149379200,4,706,4.05
