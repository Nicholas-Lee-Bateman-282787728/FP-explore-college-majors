8344463,1,B000O79I66,"David ""English is my second language"" Evans (Mohammed Bardi) is an ex-cop and out of work detective who struggles with vices. When a couple of nurses from the Kingdom Psychotic Hospital are murdered, he is hired to investigate by his ex-girlfriend Maria (Amie Conn). We see the killings. It is a deformed blue skinned man who looks like ""he who which we do not speak."" There are no suspects, just a new electronic device to treat patients.  The victims have Arabic writing on them, famous quotes about revenge.

This was low budget all around. The script was terribly boring. The acting wasn't there. Mohammed Bardi has no business around a camera. The sound was uneven.  Worth a punch on the hacker's card.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1482019200,4,741,4.765625
8344464,3,B000O79I66,"Debutant director Harish Shankar is good in certain aspects. He manages to strike the right chords with husband - wife thread. He handles emotions and romance very well.
Ravi Teja  suited the role which has the dimensions of family orientation and revenge seeking. He did extremely well in combination episodes with Jyothika. Jyothika is lovely as housewife and she is a treat to watch in sarees.
First half of the film is neat. First half is driven completely as per the demand of script without going for commercial gimmicks. Second half lets you down. The revenge taking episodes are not dealt in interesting way. First half of the film offers something to the family crowds and the second half is action driven.
Overall its a worth watch movie.!!!!",1301011200,,752,4.875
