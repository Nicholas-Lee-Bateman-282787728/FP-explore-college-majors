8160046,2,B000L43930,"This video is sub par. The beginning shows the artist with 50 lbs of clay, he melts down an UNKNOWN amount in the oven, then says he needs more for the head sculpt and proceeds to melt down a lifesize clay arm to use for some more clay haha. Who knows if he used  50 lbs of clay for the hed or not, its never stated, you're on your own folks! Then at every step of the actual head sculpting process its edited so each step is magically done and he is lightly brushing an already sculpted section hahah! It shows and tells nothing! The second section on the dvd is more informative and you actually see him sculpt small heads. The guy is a master sculptor but not a good teacher.",1420588800,,678,4.136363636363637

8160048,5,B000L43930,I am a big fan of Marks from his DVD's Amazing talent and I have learned so much. I own several and they are just so professional. This is just like any of his DVDs. Cant watch them just once. I am new at this and its such a pleasure to have Artist like Mark who are not afraid to share their Talent and knowledge with us. This DVD covers the fine details it takes to make your work a realistic piece. Thank you Mark,1368835200,,416,3.9058823529411764
8160049,4,B000L43930,"On the DVD ""Sculpting The Human Head"", special effects artist Mark Alfrey creates a remarkably realistic life size human head in a material called ""Pro-clay"".  Pro-clay is not an ordinary modeling clay and ( as of May 2010 ) it is no longer available.  Shorter segments of the DVD deal with how to photograph sculpture and how to sculpt caricatures from ordinary modeling clay.

This DVD does not teach how to sculpt the likeness of particular person.  In the main segment of the DVD, Mark sculpts a life sized head of an old man from his imagination and a few measurements from his own head.  Not all of the sculpting is shown.  As the video progresses, the head becomes more and more realistic and smoother.  We see how Mark does the initial layout of the features and how he sculpts the eyes.  However, we don't see complete footage about the nose, lips and ears.  He explains how to create details such as raised veins and hanging folds of skin on the neck.  Areas of the head become smoother and finally the whole head is smoothed.  We don't see footage of that smoothing.  (Perhaps smoothing Pro-clay is a trivial task.  It is not trivial to smooth ordinary oil or wax based modeling clays. )  Next, Mark applies a skin texture and details such as pores and extensive wrinkles.  These procedures are completely explained.  (Senior citizens may find watching this DVD rather depressing.)

A supplementary section of the DVD is about sculpting caricatures.  Mark sculpts  palm sized caricatures of David Duchovny and Sarah Michelle Gellar in an ordinary wax based modeling clay.  These are not as detailed as the head sculpted in the main section.

Anyone planning to use this DVD should investigate whether Pro-clay or an equivalent material is  available.  The DVD gives a phone number as a source of information on Pro-clay.  The website motionpicturefx belongs to the company with that number.  By email (May 2010), the company says that Pro-clay is no longer manufactured and that no equivalent clay is available.  However, production of Pro-clay may resume later this year.  On the web, a company called ""TexClay"" advertises ""Superior Clay"" whose description resembles  Pro-clay.  I have not personally examined either of these clays. ( Pro-clay should not be confused with the ""Sculpey"" brand of polymer clay called ""ProClay"". )

Pro-clay appears to be a firm non-hardening modeling material.  Mark Alfrey says that warm Pro-clay ""stretches like silly putty"".  He says that the material can be heated and poured into an alginate mold to cast objects.  Mark uses tools when he needs to dig out the clay instead of using his fingers.  While working with a tool, he is able to brace his hand by resting a finger on the sculpture and the material is stiff enough so that this does not leave a fingerprint. The initial batch of 40 lbs of Pro-clay is prepared by melting  blocks of it in a oven set to ""well under"" 200 F.  He stores the unused Pro-clay under a lamp to keep it warm before adding it to the sculpture.

The somewhat dated computer graphics, the quality of the video, the faint meandering background music  - all of this delivers the message ""I was once a VHS tape"".  If so, this DVD is the reincarnation of a good tape.  The design of the camera work is superb and we have an excellent close-up views of the details of what Mark does.  He narrates the DVD in a smooth and scripted manner.  I think his comments were recorded in a sound studio instead of while he was sculpting.

Synopsis

Sculpting The Human Head

The sculpture is a life sized head of an old man, which is shown on the DVD cover.  It is not a portrait of a particular person.

This segment is about a 50 minutes.  There are places where the video skips ahead in time.  It isn't clear how long it took Mark to complete the sculpture.

The Pro-clay is prepared by melting it in an ordinary electric oven at its lowest setting.

The armature is a steel pipe on a wooden base.  The pipe is covered with aluminum foil.  There is a fist sized lump of paster on the top of the pipe.  Dimensions and other details are not given.
I think the armature is set on a turntable, but not clamped down.  We can see the sculpture wobble slightly when Mark works on it.

 Mark uses a plastic skull and his own head as references.  He takes measurements on his own head with calipers.  He forms a mass of clay in roughly in the shape of a head with the correct width and height.  He marks a vertical center line.  Then he establishes a horizontal reference line that touches the bottom of the ear lobes.  He establishes two points on the the side of the skull that indicate the bottom of the ear lobes.  From these reference points and lines he establishes the location of other features.

Marks uses a variety of ""loop tools"" for sculpting.  He says that cutting clay away should be balanced with adding clay.  He cuts away clay with the loop tools and adds back small lumps.  Mark sculpts a smooth realistic head.  Then he adds a skin textures all over it by using tools cut from a dog grooming brush.  He uses a small house painters brush to brush away fragments  of clay created from the grooming brush.  Then he adds detail like pores and wrinkles.  For cutting wrinkles, he uses a variety of small loop tools followed by brushing.

Photographing Your Sculpture

This short feature is part of the previous track.  It emphasizes using effective lighting and says not to use a flash.  It assumes the photography will be done with a film camera, but I think the lighting advice applies to digital photography.

Sculpting Caricature

Mark uses a medium firmness oil based clay ( a ""Chavant"" brand clay) to sculpt a pair of roughly 6 inch high heads.  These are caricatures of actor David Duchovny and actress Sarah Michelle Gellar.  He shows preliminary studies done in PhotoShop and also in clay.  The footage of the sculpting looks fairly complete but these heads are not as detailed as the full sized head done in the first track of the DVD.

I rate this DVD as four stars out of five to indicate that it is an excellent explanation of how to sculpt wrinkles and other  detail in Pro-clay.  I hope that anyone who has new information on Pro-clay or similar materials will add comments to this review.",1274918400,3,6273,4.6119673617407075
8160050,3,B000L43930,"This video really should have been called ""Texturing the Human Head"" then it would have been a great offering for that purpose. However, it does say it's a sculpting DVD, and thus I have to review it as such.

It's not that the sculpture is bad, in fact it's quite fantastic, it's just that you aren't really shown how to make it. You get a couple of minutes on the basic shape of the features and then it skips forward to them being completely finished. I don't know why this was done, were they paying Alfrey by the minute for narration? Important parts of the face are hardly mentioned or overlooked completely, and half of the short time spent on the structural elements of the sculpt is just spent on drawing lines to find where the features should be and on taking measurements.

Where the instruction really shines, however, is in the texturing. Every last bit of texture is shown in detail and most of the tools are adequately explained.

In summary, a great choice for sculptors that already know what they're doing and just want to add that extra bit of realism to their work, but for those that are just starting, best to look elsewhere for now.",1267920000,17,1156,4.521531100478469
8160051,5,B000L43930,"The level of detail shown in this video is incredible. If you are doing portrait sculpture this video will help you kick it up a notch.

His technique is very strong and you quickly see by watching the video some amazingly simple techniques to bring in even more detail to your artwork. Well worth the time to watch the entire video to see all of the little techniques that he adds throughout.

I also appreciate Mark showing the ProClay as an alternative to wed clay. Highly recommended!",1204416000,,488,4.597701149425287
8160052,5,B000L43930,"I found this video to be very helpful.  It does a good job of presenting the basic process, as well as offering many good ""tips and tricks"" along the way.  The narration is light-hearted but relevant and even quite funny at times.  The majority of the video is shot in close-up on the clay with the artist's hands ""in action"" as the work takes shape.  I found that aspect very useful as it gave a clear demonstration of effective use of the chosen tool for a given effect.  Reccommended for beginners (like me) but I'm sure there is something here for more experienced sculptors too.",1183593600,,583,4.514285714285714
8160053,5,B000L43930,"Mr Alfrey's dvd was excellent. It contained enough detail to help a sculptor improve sculpture abilities regardless of the experience level. I would recommend it for the beginner, intermediate, or advanced sculptor.

I wish I had bought this sooner, it would have helped me learn faster.",1168473600,3,287,5.239130434782608
