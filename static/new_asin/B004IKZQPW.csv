No chapters, all zones, recordable DVD (color) and distributed by ATI which is a company that duplicates DVDs.",1390608000,2,264,5.0227272727272725

4386964,3,B004IKZQPW,"In GO, JOHNNY, GO, the orphan boy (Clanton) striving for his R&R break plotline is just an excuse for many fine performances (and a few schlocky ones). Berry does three of his hits, the Cadillacs sound like the Coasters, 17-year-old Valens is outstanding in his only film, as is Wilson.

As for legendary DJ Alan Freed, we all owe a great deal to this crusading integrator and champion of rock & roll. This one's a must-see for fans of 1950s pop, r&b and rock music.

4386966,4,B004IKZQPW,"This DVD was more than I expected. The sound was good, and a well presented story. I didn't realise that this was an actual story, but I really liked it.",1355961600,2,153,4.133333333333334
4386967,4,B004IKZQPW,"Clocking in at about an hour, contains rarities of the early days of rock and roll.  The plot is dumb and in the way, and the only reason to see this is for some performances that otherwise would have been lost. The only clip of Ritchie Valens is here. The Flamingoe perform a jaw dropping song and dance number. Three Chuck Berry tunes, one of them being an extended Johnnie B. Good, played over the opening credits. If you love 1950's music you can't go wrong here. Much better than expected.

Is Chuck Berry the only one in this film who is still alive?",1335484800,10,556,4.336538461538462
4386968,2,B004IKZQPW,"Lots of people like this movie but I found it just corny. The only thing I liked was how cute Jimmy Clanton was. The acting , like in his other corny movie, was ridiculous. He's a cutie , though. LOL !",1327449600,3,201,3.926829268292683

Become A Rock n Roll Star. Rock n Roll Promoter Alan Freed Is In Search Of A New Star Jimmy Clanton Cuts A Demo Record With The Help Of A Young Sandy Stewart As A Back Up Voice He Makes It Big",1306022400,4,428,3.7142857142857144
4386971,5,B004IKZQPW,"Go Johnny Go"" is one of the most interesting and enjoyable of the early rock films. Chuck Berry features,not just as a performer but an actor as well
The movie has the only big screen performance of Richie Valens,who died very shortly after he filmed this appearance,in the notorious 1959 plane crash,which also claimed Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper.
Another tragic rocker here is Eddie Cochran,a car accident victim about a year and a half after he made the film.
The story,such as it is,concerns Alan Freed's desire to make a star out of a talented nobody-this means we get a lot of crooning from lanky teen idol Jimmy Clanton,playing the aforesaid nobody(the ""Johnny"" of the title).

Look out for scene with Alan Freed jamming on drums along with Chuck Berry and his group on the marvellous ""Little Queenie"",Freed looks like he's having a ball.

Performers(alphabetical)- Chuck Berry-""Go Johnny go"",""Little Queenie"" ""Memphis Tennessee"" The Cadillacs-""Jaywalker"",""Please Mr Johnson""(They may have been the poor man's Coasters,but they're great here,acting out their song stories on the stage in a club). Jo-Ann Campbell-""Momma can I go out?"" Jimmy Clanton-""Angel face"",""It takes a long time"",""My love is true"",""Ship on a stormy sea"" Eddie Cochran-""Teenage Heaven""(watch Eddie dance with his guitar!) The Flamingos-""Jump children""(a performance of breathtaking exuberance) Harvey Fuqua-""Don't be afraid to love me"" Sandy Stewart-""Heavenly father"",""Playmate""(the last one a perky piece performed in a recording studio) Sandy Stewart/Jimmy Clanton-""Once again"" Richie Valens-""Ooh my head""""(performed for Freed and his pals and a tiny group of teens) Jackie Wilson-""You'd better know it""(Wilson,a reliable showstopper as always-and one of the coolest rockers ever. If you've seen stills or clips of Jackie performing in front of a silly coffee pot with a face backdrop,this is where it's from!)

I can definitely recommend this great quality dvd set for Rock n Roll fans of all ages..",1300147200,22,1983,5.431818181818182
