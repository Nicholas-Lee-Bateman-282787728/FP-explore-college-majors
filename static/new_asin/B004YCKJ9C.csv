4498745,5,B004YCKJ9C,"Quite simply one of the best movies I have seen this year. The lead actor has mastered the art of deadpan humor in addition to just flat out being a superb actor.
Great plot, great characters, very intertaining....intelligent...I could go on and on. I rented this from Amazon Instant but am about to order a physical copy for future use.....this is worth seeing many more times than once!!",1315008000,3,389,4.735294117647059
4498746,4,B004YCKJ9C,"2:13 was a very good  psychological  thriller with some unexpected twists.
The cast was brilliant and the acting top notch,There are some very gory grisly scenes of torture and murder that amp up the horror factor.

 At the core of the story we have a cat and mouse between a Serial Killer and a Detective with emotional and drinking issues and that is always interesting if done right and it works here.

I won't say much because I don't want to give anything away but it is definitely worth a watch You can also catch this on Fios on Demand right now.",1310601600,18,553,4.382352941176471
4498747,4,B004YCKJ9C,Very good. Not quite as much action and mystery . More psychological suspense and leans closer to reality than many serial movies.,1308355200,4,130,4.954545454545454
4498748,3,B004YCKJ9C,"My husband and I watched this on Instant Video and we both were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. The lead actor was fantastic. Every emotion he was feeling was showed in his eyes and demeanor. I am not sure if I had seen him in other things, he was superb in this. I think the comparison to Seven and Silence of the Lambs is wishful thinking, however, this is a very good film in its own right. The plot, although done before, is about a cop who comes back from leave (you will know why) only to be plunged into a nightmare investigation of a serial killer who likes William Shakespeare. I will not spoil this for anyone who watches, there is a great surprise ending that I could never have imagined. If you are looking for a good psychological thriller this is worth watching.",1307836800,40,785,4.346938775510204

4498750,2,B004YCKJ9C,This is a little hard to follow. It does not make a whole lot of sense until near the very end.  It is a sad story and not something I will watch again.

4498752,4,B004YCKJ9C,The acting was just fine.  I think people are confusing acting with the actual characters.  They could have been more likeable and that would come from the writing and or casting.  I knew from the beginning who the killer was BUT didn't know how it would play out.  This is very good and kept my interest. Detailed back stories on the two main characters.,1517616000,,355,4.5

4498759,4,B004YCKJ9C,"Wasn't sure about this movie, but after reading a few other reviews I thought why not try it. I must say, I was pretty surprised that it actually ended up being pretty good. Has a unique (really creepy) storyline/plot and the acting was good as well. So if you are in the mood for a thriller that offers suspense, intrigue, and a few scenes that are gruesomely disturbing, then give this a go.",1515974400,,393,4.397260273972603

4498762,4,B004YCKJ9C,I'm so glad I didn't listen to the critics because I really enjoyed the movie. It had gore in it but wasn't overly done and had just the right amount of twists and turns that I didn't have any idea who the killer was until the end. I loved the ending also!

4498767,5,B004YCKJ9C,"Saw this movie in 2010 and it spooked me out.  Second time was a  spook-out for me out again, and I picked out a lot of deeper clues that I missed the first time I watched!  Loved the twists and turns of this psychological thriller, whose clues were from Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"".  The troubled, yet successful police profiler, played by Mark Thompson, comes across as a boozey character fighting to overcome his demons..........no one noticed the two caskets and who lay in one besides Amanda?  Loved the dog who played his part well, Dwight Yoakam did great in his bit part.  Anyone notice this was written by the protaganist himself?  If you like psychological thrillers, don't pass this one by.",1514764800,,712,4.786885245901639
4498768,4,B004YCKJ9C,"The acting was superb and I loved the movie, however, I knew right from the entrance of Tyler with the message from his long missing wife ""I MISS YOU"", that he was the killer.

The acting goes from okay to how the hell do you call yourself an actor.  It was just trite and blah.  Nothing edge of your set including the serial killer. Nothing memorable and I would wait till this hit Prime free rather than paying for it.",1512432000,,402,4.2631578947368425
4498778,4,B004YCKJ9C,"I enjoyed this detective mystery. It was suspenseful. I pretty much guessed the bad guy midway through. I think all of the acting was really good. The lead actor was impressive and has an amazing range. He was very natural in that part. I'd like to see him in more films. The bad guy was excellent and very powerful in his part.  Story wise, the one problem was the timeline and the ages of the main characters portrayed. I wonder if that wasn't a last minute change in the script. But if you ignore that, suspend disbelief and go with the plot, the film is very good.",1509753600,2,568,4.308411214953271

4498780,3,B004YCKJ9C,"RELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Charles Adelman, 2:13 was written by and stars Mark Thompson as a troubled L.A. detective chasing down an obviously sick serial killer who has a fetish for theater masks and mutilating his victims. Teri Polo and Jere Burns play his cop associates while Mark Pellegrino appears as a distraught victim of the murderer. Deborah Carson is also on hand.

This is a grim psychological crime thriller with grisly elements, bordering on horror, similar to The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and, in some ways, The Glimmer Man (1996). The movie is low-budget, but competent enough with a palpably grey, austere tone. Teri is thoroughly stunning throughout, nice & curvy. I enjoyed her characters relationship with the disturbed (alcoholic) protagonist; you could sense the warmth between them and its kinda moving.

Theres a focus on psychotherapy, which is reminiscent of Equus (1977). If thats your thang, you might be interested. Also consider checking out the micro-budgeted Sheltered (2010), which shares some similarities, but with an altogether different plot (see my review).

THE MOVIE RUNS 96 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles.

4498792,1,B004YCKJ9C,"The timeline and the relative ages of the primary characters was so ridiculously implausible that it ruined whatever potential the film might have had.  When the lead is 55 and the antagonist is supposed to be roughly 20 years older but looks 20 yesrs younger? Laughable.

Another huge problem with the film was the lead.  Mark (of Mark and Brian radio) wrote the story and cast himself as the lead.  He didn't have the chops to hang with even the modest assortment of B-level bit players he assembled for the supporting cast.

The film looked cheaply done, the editing looked rushed and done by amateurs, the dialogue was stiff, hokey and cliched - as if the actors were fed their lines moments before they woodenly recited them.

The story itself had potential.  Sadly that potential was abused by the lead, by poor acting, by cheap sets and wardrobe, by butchered editing, by puzzling choices.  Mark ruined his own movie with selfish and poorly executed decisions.",1428969600,2,967,4.818181818181818

CSI on TV  is more graphic and entertaining.  What a waste of my 3.00.  I want my money back.  The only good reviews for this movie are from family members and or cast members who took the time to submit high ratings since anyone can.  If you like boring, slow, imaginary gore horror flicks.

Movie is atmospheric with Se7en style flourishes, but ultimately illogical in the timeline of events. It's a diversion between seasons of Hannibal. Besides, you get to look at Ken Howard and say ""Damn! Has it really been 35 years since 'White Shadow was on the air?"" and Jere Burns is nothing like his Kirk Morris character, which means I must have slept through parts of ""Breaking Bad"". What I don't get though is why there are so many cut-a ways on an unrated movie? It's not like the MPAA got there Ham-Hands on it!

It doesn't make sense, either.  How old are some of the characters supposed to be?  We see one of them in flashbacks taking place in the 1950s, where he looks like he's about 13 or 14 years old (and why does he have long hair in these flashbacks?  Boys did not wear their hair long at that time).  We also see footage of him in the 1960s when he's a young man.

4498825,5,B004YCKJ9C,"2:13 is a well-made, thoughtful thriller w/ plenty of darkness and heavy atmosphere. It's also a cool police procedural (Ala: WIRE IN THE BLOOD). If you love movies like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HANNIBAL, RED DRAGON / MANHUNTER, SE7EN, THE ALPHABET KILLER, etc., then 2:13 should be a treat. Although there are the usual plot contrivances and red herrings, the storyline and main character portrayals more than make up for these tiny drawbacks. Highly recommended...",1327017600,6,463,5.1866666666666665
4498826,4,B004YCKJ9C,"I actually did a certain amount of research before viewing this, since reviews were so mixed (and I'm tight with a dime).  Ultimately, I'm glad I watched it.  Certainly, Se7en and Silence of the Lambs were superior movies in terms of production - they cost more, had bigger stars, and went way over the top with evil characters and gore.

Yet this movie was impressive for delivering some stellar acting.  As has been mentioned, the main character is well portrayed by the actor.  Just go back and look at all the little finger and lip tics he displays in moments of tension.

***SPOILERS***

I also suspected early on who the killer was, but was pleasantly surprised at how it all tied in at the end.  You just can't give that much screen time to a minor character and expect they don't play a part in the resolution.

It's one thing to deliver a film to jaded audiences who have watched film after film and *always* know who the killer is due to the formula.  It's something else to portray a character as investigating those same clues - following that formula - without making him seem an idiot.  Spivey never seemed an idiot to me.

I got who the killer was early on, but the film required me to think about why and how.  And that was the selling point that made it worth the money.  Ultimately, it's a nice addition to the genre with some real acting and tension-filled moments.",1324080000,,1384,4.484
4498827,2,B004YCKJ9C,"This film is a waste of time. The plot was unoriginal, I was able to figure out who the killer was by half the film, and it is a mediocre rip off of Seven.

Though the main actor was really good- kind of reminded me of Robert Downy Jr, and the gory parts were nice but the worst part of this movie was the end.

Anyone who has seen Seven, let me say this and you will agree it's ripped off ness:
A serial killer who kills with a theme
who leaves clues and messages to the cops
actually leaves one of those is some kinda underground sex room at a bar.
Enough said.",1322438400,,563,3.9298245614035086

""Probably not.""

Russell Spivey, a police profiler (Mark Thompson) no sooner returns from psychiatric leave when he suddenly finds himself caught up in a serial killer's rampage.  Fighting to keep the trauma of his childhood buried, Russell Spivey must confront the trademark of the killer: all too-familiar masks left on the faces of his victims.  The significance of these masks is reveled slowly and late, this is mainly a story about a cop with issues (they always have issues, in this case drinking).  A great deal of time is devoted to Russell Spivey's issues, which also involves Kevin Pollack as the doctor who is treating him.  I was less interested in this aspect of the film but most of the amusing moments came from their interplay (""light?"").  So I'm conflicted, I really liked this movie but it's definitely more a procedural than what the DVD illustration suggests.  If you went by the impression the cover gives you would be misled into thinking this was a horror film, it's not.  Even though all the elements represented on the cover are accurate to the contents, they're done in such a way that you would think it was a horror movie.  I think that's a bit of a cheat.
At any rate, I enjoyed it once I got over my initial disappointment.  But I didn't keep it for my collection.",1316995200,15,1329,4.689655172413793

However, they needed him alive to explain his part in the movie/killings. And they needed him dead to have a happy ending, so they couldn't kill him off until after he had relived his terrible past. After they arrest him... turn it off. Nothing else to see here. The end.",1526947200,,396,4.438356164383562
