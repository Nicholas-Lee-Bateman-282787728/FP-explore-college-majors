8104869,3,B000E372LI,"I found the film to be somewhat boring....and the question posed by the title was NEVER answered! Also the Indians speaking from their point of view blamed the army; the army blamed Red Cloud and his followers. That's not exactly something new now is it? From the many books I have read on this heroic and selfless hero and Sioux chief, it is clear he was murdered; it was no accident. When he was shot by No Water, Little Big Man held his arms...again when he was bayonetted, Little Big Man held his arms until Crazy Horse cut him with his knife....his vision was very clear that it would be his own people who would bring him down. Now, finish that giant monument out west near Mount Rushmore; and honor another great man in this nation's history. As for Grant, Crook, Sheridan, Sherman and the rest of them esp. G.A. Custer.....good riddance. They were a pack of murderers.",1358121600,2,876,4.550632911392405
