6373367,3,B00JKQHP3U,"Lovely scenes of countryside but it seemed something was missing in the interviews. I think the film maker meant well, but he just didn't get into the real feelings of the farmers interviewed. Perhaps it is that the French just don't open up their personal feelings.",1455580800,,266,4.804347826086956
6373368,5,B00JKQHP3U,Beautifully filmed.  Very interesting to see the old-timers from a fading life style.  I like these kind of films.,1454198400,,114,4.947368421052632

6373370,5,B00JKQHP3U,"This document is a hauntingly beautiful series of human portraits. It is a times very uncomfortable to watch as the dialogues are often a succession of uneasy silences..The self consciousness of the various subjects in the front of the camera is an obvious impediment to the flow of the conversations. The actual photography, especially when the camera is fixing its gaze on the farmers is of an exceptional aesthetic composure.",1452816000,,428,5.128571428571429
8651862,5,B00JKQHP3U,"The story is really told through the pictures of life...farm....total scene...not the interviews so much.  You can see into the eyes of people who have simple beautiful lives how hard, isolating, and committed their struggle to survive is. They all have beautiful character, stunning perseverance, and a quirky shyness around the camera.  It is a unique view into an otherwise lost world.  When this film is over you realize the interviews have given you a gift......You have witnessed true struggle, and loss....beauty, and reality of a way of life changing....and the soul of the French people",1485907200,,595,5.177083333333333
8651863,5,B00JKQHP3U,"This is a French film about aging French farmers with little if any plan for succession.  As an American farmer myself, this was difficult to watch.",1485129600,2,148,4.6923076923076925

8651866,5,B00JKQHP3U,"A guy documents the far-from-Paris and Nice Frenchman  and their struggle to scratch out a way of life in agriculture. These people are poor farmers who live simple lives. They are very hospitable, generous people. They remind me much of the Appalachian Americans. They have been ignored, passed by as they cling to their culture and way of life. It is remote and sad but lovely at the same time. They, like their Appalachian Americans cousins, are somewhat removed and removed by their encircling countries. In France they are Occitania. They even have an almost dead language/dialect. And they struggle to be different can be seen in the fight across the border in Spain in the Catalonian independence fight. I hope they achieve it. And I hope they rebound as a result of coming together.",1471132800,,790,4.851851851851852
8651867,3,B00JKQHP3U,"Interesting characters and scenery but interviewer was terrible. Not quite sure if there was a point and if so, it was not made well.",1464566400,,133,4.583333333333333
