2752373,1,B000N01YGQ,"can anyone tell me what aspect ratio this might be ?????  is it one episode or up to 55 episodes  ??? CAN THIS DESCRIPTION OF THIS DVD BE ANY MORE VAGE THAN IT ALREADY IS. using this description is like buying a box marked TV inside, then you find out its a box of rocks.  to the person who wrote product info,  IT'S ALL ON THE COVER / OR BACK SIDE OF THE PRODUCT

Turns out this is a 45 min. one story edition, had they been up front with this info, I would not have bought. This is FROM the series, not the complete series  This is MISSREPINTATION at its finest, or lack of. If you like this kind of cartoon, wait for the whloe series,  price will probaly be about the same as this one edition.

Cartoon is also not that bad to watch, would have been better if this had been the whole series",1283558400,19,793,4.006369426751593
2752374,3,B000N01YGQ,"The Mask Animated Series has that Spongebob Squarepants-kind of gross humor that kids like, though Spongebob has had a better handle on it.  I find it most unfortunate that New Line Home Video - in this VHS edition, at least - chose to put previews of their adult films, such as the R-rated ""National Lampoon's Senior Trip"" and PG-13-rated ""Dumb and Dumber"", in front of the feature presentation, necessitating a fast-forward past scenes of jiggly young women and amorous couples and on-screen definitions of words like ""stupid"" and ""idiot"".  Bad judgement call for New Line.",1274400000,4,575,5.042105263157895
