8323596,5,B0002DVAEK,"What I loved about this DVD is that you can watch it and then go do it.  For the most part, if you are an average crafter you will have the items you need to get going and create something awesome, like a book cover or fabric to wrap a box or to cover a journal.  I have posted images in the Fabricabra Gallery of a quilt that won first prize at our county fair.",1166745600,7,362,3.8133333333333335
