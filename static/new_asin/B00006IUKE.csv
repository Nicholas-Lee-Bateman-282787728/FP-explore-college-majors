7969866,5,B00006IUKE,"I don't recall FREQUENCY at all. The one with Dennis Quaid and Jesus Caviezel? Even when I read a synopsis to refresh my memory, no visuals came to mind.

If I live another 20 years, I won't forget DITTO. Released one month after FREQUENCY with the same plot device (a ham radio connection across time), DITTO did everything right. It had one utterly stunning moment. And, as usual, the Korean film is visually superior to the Hollywood film.

In this one, the ham radio operators are a young college man and woman living 20 years apart. Unlike FREQUENCY which carelessly messes with past events and uses action to try to keep the audience awake, this film gently explores the respective love lives. The characters and their interactions have depth enuf to seem real in spite of the scifi premise. The imaginative powers behind this film can be seen in a single scene where an entire thread of the plot is revealed in a short series of photographs.

The lead actress, Kim Ha Neul, isn't the prettiest actress but she builds a quietly powerful performance of subtle nuances that thoroughly won me over. The lead actor, Yu Ji Tae, is almost her equal (and is tall enuf to play pro basketball). Pretty Ha Ji Won, in a supporting role in her second film, is competent, and is made up to look really cute.

I should perhaps warn you that the ham radio portion starts a short while into the film. Be patient cuz that prologue pays off. My only real regret is the sometimes overwhelming piano background music.

BTW, another Korean film, SIWORAE (aka,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IL-MARE/dp/B000FWC74A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IL MARE</a>), would be released later that year. It would use a mail box to connect two people across 2 years of time -- and would be remade as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-LAKE-HOUSE/dp/B000HEWEE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE LAKE HOUSE </a>&nbsp;in 2006. I prefer DITTO to both of those.",1235692800,2,2010,5.3081761006289305
7969867,5,B00006IUKE,"""I can be your diary for awhile. Your talking diary.""

This love story from Korea has the tenderness of snowflakes carried gently from the heavens on a soft winter breeze. From its sepia hued opening to its final shot, this film will gently squeeze your heart until you feel the ache of love which remains even after we are gone, as does its scent. Filled with moments of great romantic beauty and heartbreaking sadness, its complex story told with a simple grace and elegance, it makes my personal list of all-time favorites.

Kim Ha Neul is endearing as Soeun, a shy college student in love with classmate Donghee. Their story of slowly getting together has a sweet innocence which is in contrast to the story of IN (Yoo Ji Tae) and his girlfriend. She is brash and quarrelsome, and is worried she may be an alcoholic. But underneath there is a yet untapped depth which will flourish near the end of this story.

Souen's life in college consists of going to see her her best friend, Sumi, in the hospital with a broken leg, and talking to an unexpected voice in the night, from a HAM radio given her by another student. It was not supposed to be in working order, yet she and IN begin to talk, at first in contentious manner, he thinking she is joking with him about attending the same college nearly 20 years earlier. Much to his girlfriend's displeasure, he makes arrangements to meet Souen.

Both think they were stood up, until her sincerity about current events leads him to give her news of future happenings, and both realize they are living in different times. Whereas most films would use this as a device to propel their love story, director Jeung Gueon Kin and photographer Kwang Suck Jung take this in an entirely different direction. The two come to care for each other, IN becoming her diary for her fledging romance with Donghee, while he wrestles with his girlfriend's drinking and initial disbelief at what he's telling her is happening.

His sudden realization that his parents are attending college with her leads to a romantically heartbreaking bit of information which changes both their lives forever. It also changes his girlfriend's mind about what has been happening, and she decides to support IN. In an emotionally wrenching scene, he discovers the scent still remains. To reveal anything further would ruin the experience for those who have yet to see this piece of film magic.

It begins slowly, and in such a simple manner, you do not expect the touching depth finally revealed. The two most wonderful things about this film are Kim Ha Neul's lovely performance, and the hauntingly beautiful score which helps set the unique atmosphere of a film which takes part of your heart with it, but gives more back. A very special film so heartfelt words cannot adequately describe its effect on the moviegoer. A must own film for anyone with a heart.",1221955200,3,2874,4.738
7969868,3,B00006IUKE,The point of this movie is about praising not touching someone with a family.  This movie is okay to recommended watching but not worth purchasing and possibly not worth a netflix rental.,1164412800,2,187,4.84375
7969869,5,B00006IUKE,"I just happened to watch this film in Arirang... and wow, I don't know what opportunity I would have missed if I had changed the channel!

The story revolves around So-eun and In, two people who only knew each other through a ham radio. As they become friends, they find out that they are separated by 21 years, as So-eun lives in 1979, and In lives in 2000. But they are not only connected by their ham radio talks... soon they find out that they are actually linked to each other by a web of human connections which makes you think that the world is really small.

Watch it and it would make you realize the other possibilities that could have happened in your life. Yes, the thought of this could make you cry, because it could make you regret... but at the same time, it could make you laugh at yourself for making the wrong choices. This sometimes slow, sometimes funny, thought-provoking, poignant, and unique tale about the mysteries of time and the people within its dimensions surely deserves 5 stars.",1146268800,8,1010,4.543956043956044
7969870,5,B00006IUKE,"Oh, did I ever love this.  I just received it in the mail today and watched it tonight.  It's 2:00 a.m., but I couldn't stop watching it or go to sleep before recommending this beautiful, sweet love story.  Soeun really is beautiful.  This actress is incredible.  She plays her roles so well:  the giddy in-love young school girl; the sad, but more deep person at having lost her love; and the briefly seen, but unforgettable wiser lady in the end.  I want to echo everything the previous reviewer said.  I couldn't have said it better.  I also found myself wishing for the perfect ending, where Soeun and In get together.  I was so much expecting In to dump his not so nice girlfriend and go for the one he seemed truly in love with.  After all, what does age matter, when you're adults?  My sweetheart is fifteen years younger than I.  What would be the difference if it were reversed?  Real true love doesn't know any age boundaries.  Such a beautiful film, and also a real tear-jerker. I'd recommend this film any day.",1140566400,15,1022,4.508196721311475
7969871,4,B00006IUKE,"Oh my gosh. I've never been on the edge of my seat ever before from watching a movie. In Ditto, I was just so focused, I didn't want anyone to disrupt my viewing. Ditto was very moving and sweet. Soeun (main girl) is so purrrdy (Her smile's the best). I only wished that somewhere toward the end, the 2 main characters would've somehow met magically (like how the HAM radio 'magically' worked unplugged) and lived happily ever after or when IN (the guy) passed by Soeun at the university in 2000, that there would've been even more than the deep stares. Actually the staring was kind of romantic, yet bitter-sweet. I think if would've been sooo interesting if IN would've starting speaking as if to the HAM right when Soeun passed him by... ""CQ..CQ..CQ.. do you copy?"" And then she stop... eyes widen, turn and tear up! VOILA, no more single Professor Yoon! O

Other than that, a respective 4.9. [More films like this baby!]",1125446400,7,924,4.6
7969872,4,B00006IUKE,"Summary:  This movie is a gentle love story that accurately portrays S. Korea in the 1970s and the present. Amazingly, a ham radio is the catalyst of the relationships and the cornerstone of the plot.

Acting: Yoo Ji-tae and Kim Ha-neul are fairly young actors, so there's room for improvement. Kim Ha-neul relies on her cuteness a lot, but she's getting better.

Historical Background: The symbolism in the movie might not make sense if you don't know anything about S. Korea's history.

This movie alternates between the present (2000) and 1979, a watershed year for Korean politics as the S. Korean president was assasinated.  The '70s are fondly remembered by the older generation as a simpler time (albeit under military rule).

Korean male/female relationships:  According to my native Korean friends, college guys and girls who like each other often flirt in a ""mean"" way. That's another cultural difference that Americans might not understand.

Anyways, all my girl friends have enjoyed this movie; I'm not sure whether guys would like it.",1107734400,13,1047,5.117647058823529
7969873,4,B00006IUKE,"I liked the concept and story (and the actress is pretty), but I felt like not enough stuff happened.  Worse than that, stuff kept almost happening and then didn't.  Mainly people who should talk to each other would just kind of look at each other awkwardly and then pass by.  I especially wanted the main characters to talk to each other at the end...arrrgh!  All in all though, a nice film.  I thought the ending was fairly bitersweet though, unlike some previous reviewers.",1103760000,3,476,4.686746987951807
7969874,5,B00006IUKE,"Incorporating the 'time travel concept', two ham radio students (boy/girl, of course) talk to each other on their ham radios, only to discover they're from different times. They discover they go/have gone to the same school and gradually develop a love interest. There are many other factors such as the respective male/female friends each have in their own present time. As the story evolves, we see most of the main characters are linked with each other, regardless of 'time-displacement'. To paraphrase another reviewer, the ending is beautiful, poignant and powerful.",1101254400,3,571,5.355555555555555
7969875,4,B00006IUKE,"Not as great as 'Il Mare', but still worth a look.",1074211200,,50,3.6363636363636362
