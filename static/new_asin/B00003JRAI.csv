1330877,5,B00003JRAI,"If you grew up on Scooby-Doo like I did as a child in the 70's, then you will love this DVD. I own alot of Scooby videos, but when I surfed over to Amazon.com one night, and typed in Scooby-Doo in the DVD-video section and  saw this DVD, I ordered it on the spot. Its about time they put the best  cartoon that has ever graced  Saturday morning tv on DVD format. If you  love Scooby and the gang, and want the original classics(FIRST FIVE  EPISODES) then, get this DVD, you will  love it....",952992000,34,491,4.170212765957447
1330878,5,B00003JRAI,"As a 30 year old man, I should probably be embarrased by the fact that I'm terribly excited that the original episodes are being released in this format.  Despite the predictable plots, the cliche humor, and the peculiar  fact that the Gang ran into unearthly or undead beings every time they went  out for a soda, these early episodes contain something magical...a  particular endearing quality like that stuffed animal that comforted you  for years and slept next to you in bed.  Sure, as an adult you don't sleep  with stuffed animals anymore...But maybe the world would be a better place  if we did.  Innocence isn't lost forever, it just goes to sleep for a  while.  DVD is waking the Gang up and I'm going to wake up with them to  experience the laughs and frights all over again.  Given the progression of  things, I don't think there will ever be cartoons like this produced again.  These are classics in every sense of the word.",952646400,5,937,4.628048780487805

No Scrappy Doo.....no Scooby Dumb....and no disturbing, witchcraft girl band (seriously!!  Who makes these awful, new Scooby Doo DVDs?!!).  This is 5 episodes of ""old school"" Scooby-genius.  They discover a mystery that needs solving, they find clues, bribe Scooby with Scooby snacks and victoriously unmask the villain behind the episode's creepy shenanigans.  Velma even crawls around looking for her glasses!  I'm not sure why other reviews are so critical of the quality of the DVD.  It's just like I remember.  WHO CARES if it's not digitally remastered.  My 4 year old son absolutely LOVES this DVD and so do I.  I would have paid double what I paid for it.

1330909,5,B00003JRAI,"Scooby Doo has morphed over the years.  More modern Scooby Doo cartoons involve such annoyances as
Scrappy Doo, celebrities, even really weird episodes where supernatural things happen (rather than more logical ""solve the mystery"" episodes).

1330978,4,B00003JRAI,"I watched Scooby Doo in the late 70's as a kid and loved it.  I still do at almost 30 years of age.  It's a great cartoon.  The mystery, the atmosphere etc.  These are all great episodes except the reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is the most obnoxious thing about this DVD.
The laugh track they have just about kills the enjoyment of watching these.  It is more obvious in some of the episodes, like 'Mine You Own Business"", where it seems like every time any of the characters says a word, you get this cheesy overbearing laugh track.  It almost ruins it totally for me.  Scooby says hello, here comes the laughs.  I don't know, if you can get by this as an adult, no problem.  The kids probably won't mind, but some may.
Needless to say, the episodes are still what they are and you'll enjoy them for what they are.  Good fun.
On a side note, I wish we could see seasons of Scooby Doo and not an episode here and there put on a DVD.",1065744000,12,936,4.093406593406593
1330989,5,B00003JRAI,"Scooby-Doo is one of the great TV cartoon stars, and the show, while cartainly fairly flimsy in the plot department (although pretty strong compared some of the other H-B cartoons), is still as entertaining as ever.
This disc has the first five episodes in order (unlike most of the other discs, which are just random collections of episodes), which is a welcome change to the compilation discs and tapes. However, as always, the special features basically stink if you're above the age of like 8, and there still hasn't been any sort of series (or season) box set, so if you want the episodes in order, this is it.",1052784000,10,615,4.651376146788991
1330990,5,B00003JRAI,"I bought both of these DVDs for my nephew and he can watch them over and over again.  I grew up being a big fan of Scooby Doo and wish that they can make a full box set of Scooby Doo: Where Are You? and The Scooby Doo Show; forget Scooby and Scrappy Too :(  There are alot of my favorite episodes from the first years of Scooby Doo that I would love to have on a DVD.  Some episodes are not even on VHS.  This is a good set of Scooby Doo episodes, but wish that WB would just put out the full seasons instead.  I'm sure there would be alot of people who would buy them.  Or, am I the only one?",1046390400,19,593,3.7419354838709675
1330991,4,B00003JRAI,"Scooby Doo and the gang may have hit the big screen, but this is the real stuff: the original Saturday morning cartoon series that so many of us grew up with. And although we might say we got this for our kids, the truth is that even as grown-ups we're addicted to these cartoon Scooby snacks ourselves!
This particular DVD offers the first five episodes in the series, each one running just under half an hour. ""What a Night for a Knight"" finds the gang investigating a suit of armor that comes to life during the full moon. When their ship run aground on a spooky island, the gang visits a creepy castle in ""Hassle in the Castle""--and encounters a ghost! ""A Clue for Scooby Doo"" concerns a ghostly scuba diver; ""Mine Your Own Business"" has the gang investigating 'the miner forty-niner' that haunts an old gold mine; and ""Decoy for a Dognapper"" finds Scooby himself dognapped and the gang searching an abandoned Indian village to find him. And you'll find all the stereotypes here: crazy clues, frantic chases, and the ""ghosts"" are NEVER real!
The animation is pretty flat, the music is 1969 wannabe funky, the plots are loose and pretty silly--no one would ever accuse the series of being great art. But it has tremendous nostalgic appeal. The episodes seen here have not been restored, but to my mind the scratches, blips, and dust spots just add to the sense of watching an old favorite. The DVD includes a number of extras that the kids will enjoy... if you ever decide to share it with them!",1036627200,35,1498,4.593283582089552
1330992,5,B00003JRAI,"In this Dvd are the first 5 episodes plus the pilot episode of the classic Scooby Doo Where Are You! series that started on the season of 1969-1970's.
With great humour Scooby Doo an the gang in the Mysterious Machine solve misteries and unmask bandits,ghots and misterious...
The Dvd includes a spanish audio track that are the same dubbing that have the episodes that were released here in Spain when I was young.
The only negative point is that the dvd doesn't have any subtitles or captions. Even the audience of this series are younger and the english level is not too high I don't understand why Warner Bros/Cartoon Network hasn't included it.
Perhaps another series would have.
I want more episodes more misteries to solve,Scooby Doo !!!!",1021507200,2,745,4.828125
1330993,3,B00003JRAI,"First off, Scooby Doo is my favorite Saturday morning series ever, and my 3-year-old loves it as much as I did when I was growing up. The stories, the music and the animation are all fun, so I was tickled when I found this DVD and got it to share with my son.
 He loves the DVD and watches it over and over, but every time we watch it, all I can see are the dust spots and scratches that are everywhere. It looks like the prints were gathering dust since 1969 and they never even bothered to clean the film before they slapped it in the duplicator! In some places, it's so bad that you watch pieces of fuzz blow across the picture while the action goes on.
 Come on, guys! Scooby Doo is a great property, so at least make sure the releases are quality work and not [something that] looks like you picked it up off the floor and sold it to us!",1018224000,17,842,4.066265060240964
1330994,5,B00003JRAI,"It was so nice to be able to enjoy these old stories with my 3 year old son.  I grew up with Scooby-Doo and he loves them too.  Having 4 of the short episodes on a CD is great when you do not have enough time for a whole movie and for a 3 year old- about the right amount of time for him to concentrate.
It is always nice to see how they catch someone and find out that it is a person behind the mask and that the kids do not see real monsters.  I hope they bring out more of the original series.",1012867200,,496,3.660377358490566

I've been watching Scooby cartoons for at least 25 years now, and I still can't get enough of them. Scooby is the favorite cartoon of both of my children, which just freaks me out. This DVD has the first five episodes of Scooby Doo. They made their television debut in 1969, and 32 years later, they are my children's favorite cartoons. There really isn't much else to say. Good, clean entertainment that is appropriate for kids 1-100. The special features aren't too bad either. For the price, you can't beat it.",1002758400,4,675,4.728813559322034

1331009,5,B00003JRAI,"I was flabbergasted upon discovery of this DVD. I never saw the first 5 Scooby-Doo episodes; I was only a year old when the series was first released in 1969! I only saw the repeats on Saturday morning, and never saw the earlier episodes, let alone the first 5. I never dreamed I'd be watching these spectacular shows on my computer! (Thank you DVD drives!) It even like, has recipes, sample music tracks and trivia questions, appealing to the trivia buff in all of us. Scooby and ""Those Meddling Kids"" will keep you happily entertained, satisfying the Scooby fan in you for a lifetime. The only improvement I could think of would be for the entire first season of ""Scooby-Doo, Where are You?"" to have been included on the DVD instead of just the first five episodes.",992736000,,767,4.605839416058394

Scooby Doo a talking Great Dane is a big scaredy-cat but can usually be bribed into doing something with a Scooby Snack as can hippie Shaggy. This volume contains the first five episodes of the famous Saturday morning cartoon.
My Opinion:  This is a classic DVD. It's fun to see the original Scooby Doo episodes. They hold up well. Why does Velma always get stuck going with Shaggy and Scooby when they split up? Freddy and Daphne always end up going off alone! And one Scooby snack never seems to be enough for Scooby. He always has to bargain for at least two just like my 4 year old daughter!! This is good clean fun.
DVD Quality:  Standard Full Screen 1.33:1 with Mono Sound. Extras include a music video and trivia quiz.
What You Should Do:  See it and show it to the kids. They will love it. Buy it if you are a huge Scooby fan. You can't go wrong.",992217600,7,968,4.421348314606742

My son treats this DVD like a shrine.  He is truly in love with this DVD.  I think all five episodes are good.  Like other reviewers I wish they would release more episodes.  Your kids will love this and since DVDs don't wear, you can view it over and over and over and over like my son has.

The episodes here are the first five, so while being classics, they are not my personal pick for the best selection.  I hope that Warner continue to issue all the ep's up to the '76-'77 series - I'd  buy them all!  My personal fav. here is 'A Clue for Scooby Doo', if only  for the classic character Ebenezer Shark: ""looks like your pooch found  me old diving suit!""

The images are clean and the colors are bright, especially  considering this is a 30 year old cartoon.  Looks great on a TV, but on a  laptop computer the clarity of the LCD screen reveals every spec of dust on  the film.  You can see every place they painted outside the black ink  lines, and if you look closely, you can see the thin shadows between the  celluloid overlays and the painted backgrounds.  In the opening, you can  see the grass in front of the castle bouncing up and down when the bats fly  across the screen.  Of course, none of this shows up on a television.  Also  look for a shot of Velma wearing lipstick when Hank, the caretaker, tells  the kids about the ""Miner 49er"".  Jinkies, that's creepy!  The  special features are lame, so buy it for the episodes, but buy it!  I hope  they release more of Scooby on DVD.",954547200,5,988,4.260869565217392

1331017,4,B00003JRAI,"You can't go wrong with the classic scooby. The five episodes are among the best with humor and mystery as the main theme. I loved the extra's on this dvd especially the scooby trivia. I would have given this dvd a  perfect score but the music video featuring the occultic hex girls from The  awful ""witches ghost"" movie kept me from it. But again a great  dvd.",954028800,2,361,4.358208955223881
