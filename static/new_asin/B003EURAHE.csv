4115587,5,B003EURAHE,"This set of CDs completes my collection on Rome.  They arrived as estimated nicely packaged.  I have not yet viewed this purchased collection (I watched it so many times on HBO), and need a little more time to pass before viewing.",1391644800,,230,4.585365853658536
4115588,4,B003EURAHE,"Love the series, and ordered both seasons for the youngest to add to their collection. Were quite surprised/disappointed to see they had really downgraded the packaging! Both seasons came in very flimsy paperboard sleeves, while our old sets were in beautiful, sturdily made boxes, and thank goodness, still looked brand new, so we gave them the older set : o",1388102400,5,359,5.0
4115589,5,B003EURAHE,I watched this series in college. I absolutely loved every episode. I look forward to rewatching them. I'm glad to have them in my collection. Best early Christmas gift ever.,1387411200,,174,4.833333333333333
4115590,3,B003EURAHE,"At the time it was produced ""Rome"" was the most expensive TV series ever mounted, and by the second season it was clear it just couldn't continue for a third. Because the very strong first season has concerned itself with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, from his victory in Gaul to his assassination in the Senate, it made sense to end the second series with the defeat of Caesar's assassins, Brutus and Cassius, and then the fall of his lover Cleopatra and his protege Mark Anthony. But the first season covered just five years, whereas the second comprehends twelve, and there's an awful lot to shoehorn into this given that the series is not just concerned with members of the imperial elite (i.e. Caesar's and Brutus's family, Cicero, Antony, and Cleopatra), but also the fortunes of two of Caesar's former soldiers, the grimly pious Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and the merry and bloodthirsty Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson). This worked very well in the first season, since we got quite a bot of fascinating detail about Vorenus's family life and both men's exploits in the army. Unfortunately, since Vorenus's wife Niobe died last season, the second season involves her widower going berserk and becoming a bloody gangmaster on the Aventine, which does keep the violence quotient up but which doesn't tell us much interesting about Roman daily life (and which also made the series much too tediously akin to other roughly contemporaneous HBO dramas such as DEADWOOD and THE SOPRANOS).

As for its portrayal of the elites, the second season starts very strongly in the immediate aftermath of the assassination conspiracy, with a panicked Atia (Polly Walker) and Antony (James Purefoy) trying to get out of town and stymied by the determination of Caesar's widow Calpurnia (Haydn Gwynne, excellent again in her smallish role) to do everything correctly and not be rushed. Though the major rivalry from last season between Atia and Brutus's mother Servilia (the superb Lindsay Duncan), and a new one between Antony and Octavian, also start well, once Brutus is defeated at Philippi everything in both cases runs out of steam: the Atia/Servilia rivalry has a disappointing go-nowhere ending that is not even true to history (well acted, however, by both women), and when Octavian comes back from Philippi played by Simon Woods rather than Max Pirkis something seems to be lost, especially when he marries Livia (who is portrayed here as a rich twit). The final episodes are especially disappointing because the entire romance between Antony and Cleopatra (Lynsey Marshal, not charismatic enough) is so rushed that the two seem fatally unsympathetic: you get tired of the debauchery and want Charmian to bring in that asp. The general sense of rush also means that major historical players in these events get excised from history altogether, including both Lucius and Gnaius Ahenobarbus, Octavian's first and second wives Clodia Pulcra and Scribonia, and Livia's husband Tiberius Claudius Nero. As before, the series is stunning to look at, with the visual climax, the Battle of Philippi, as spectacular as Caesar's triumph over Vercingetorix was the season before.",1385769600,14,3168,5.127659574468085
4115591,5,B003EURAHE,Really brought the history to life. Great visuals. Hopefully I will be able to take a class one day and see how closely they followed the actual happenings.,1378252800,,156,4.607142857142857
4115592,5,B003EURAHE,I was at first skeptical about this show. The best part about the series is how accurate Roman culture is depicted. The show starts out with the Roman republic in shambles after the assassination of gaius Julius Caesar. The plot twist are superb and by far one of the best shows about Roman culture.,1374710400,2,299,4.555555555555555
4115623,5,B003EURAHE,One of the best series HBO ever did. Very accurate in overall scope. Lots of similarities to America today.,1481846400,,107,4.684210526315789

4115628,5,B003EURAHE,"Treachery, loyalty, love, death, poisoning, orgies. Man, I miss having HBO. If the script doesn't make you fall for the characters, I'm sure the acting will. The sets, costumes, are fantastic. Low key CGI. Try to get the series with the bonus features that allows you to watch it with the historic pop-ups. The makers paid a great deal of attention to Roman history and tried to be as faithful to it as possible. And when they are not, for poetic license or what have you, they let you know. Great fun.",1466553600,,502,4.467391304347826

4115631,5,B003EURAHE,"HBO really hit it out of the park with this series.  I loved it the first time that I saw it and enjoyed it even more the second time around.  The characters are pretty complicated, the scenery is spectacular and the political violence is top-notch!

My only knock is that the history is altered to some degree to make the storyline more entertaining, but you can't win them all can you?",1457395200,,387,4.422535211267606

4115636,5,B003EURAHE,"Amazing show with exotic locals, incredible set design, and great actors. If you've watched season 1, you shouldn't miss season 2. This show does contain a lot of violence, and sex, and is not for the faint of heart.",1447200000,,216,4.564102564102564

4115640,5,B003EURAHE,"Great! If you like historical fiction set in ancient times, it doesn't get any better than this. Following the lives of two fictional characters as help shape (and sometimes derail) Western Civilization's first mega-empire, this is the first show I've seen that truly captures what I imagine life in antiquity must have been like. High stakes, high action and adventure, high drama, a a little humor to boot! Bear in mind, this is an HBO product, so you'll get your fill of graphic violence, sex, and nudity. Not a kids' show, but totally awesome in scope and detail. Highly recommend!",1437264000,2,585,4.86

Game of Thrones / Sopranos set in 44 BC!",1434412800,,69,3.6
4115642,5,B003EURAHE,Enjoyed the series. Wish they would make more.,1432339200,,46,4.875
4115653,4,B003EURAHE,"Hopefully if you are reading this you have already watched Season 1. If not stop here! Spoiler Alert!

I enjoyed this Season as much as Season 1. However some reviews I have read here mention that they thought Season 1 was better. This may have to do with the fact that Lucius Vorenus seems to be in a somber mood for all of Season 2 due to the death of his wife. We see him unravel.

I really liked several things about this season. One is the continuing fued between Atia and Servilia. This is very powerful to watch. I also liked the rivalry between Antony and Octavian. Octavian has grown up now and it seems he is competing with Antony to see who can be the bigger jacka$$. A nice job done by both actors. It makes me wonder what these two are like in real life. Are they as difficult as the characters they portray? I did think it was odd that Octavian seemed to pick out his wife in about 2 minutes. For the most part I also liked the scenes with Antony and Cleopatra, although at times it seemed overdone.

This season doesn't turn out to be a happy one for Titus Pullo. Although the actor who portrays him does a great job. We want Titus Pullo, the loyal friend, to be happy. But fate seems to have its own plan for him.

Wish there was a Season 3. Come on HBO!",1429574400,4,1270,4.150406504065041

4115678,5,B003EURAHE,"Season 2 fall short in comparison to season one, but it is worth watching, especially since the development of characters like Brutus and Marc Anthony reach their zenith. Titus Pullo shines, but Vorenus loses his luster. The change of actors for Octavius detracted from the image fashioned in season 1. Overall, I'm glad that I own both seasons, but will return to season 1 more often.",1406678400,5,385,4.848484848484849

8395647,4,B003EURAHE,"The first season discs come in a folding cardboard and plastic contraption that goes inside a folding wood box. The second season comes in a folding cardboard and plastic contraption without the wood box. The discs play fine. I didn't like Lucius Vorenus's wife in this series. The second season is more depraved than the first. There is homosexuality and a few perverts too. Lucius becomes a family man, but his daughters hate him. He should've traded his family for a few good slaves.

If you liked Spartacus: Gods of the Arena or Spartacus: Blood and Sand you should like Rome.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1521158400,,2010,5.537459283387622
