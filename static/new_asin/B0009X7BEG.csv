2333950,1,B0009X7BEG,"Unfortuately the practice of studios using the edited for syndication versions of shows rather than going back to the uncut masters (as seen on the network) continues with THAT'S MY MAMA.  The majority of the shows are edited by about four minutes each, though a small number appear to be uncut. Not acceptable....I won't pay for edited product.",1123113600,57,345,4.948275862068965

I saw this show in syndication I was a little girl when it syndicated. I used to love this show. Junior the mailman (Ted Lange) would come to the barber shop and visit and always said ooh weeh!!!!

I remember Wildcat Jester Hairston . I just used to love this show and I am so glad that it is coming to dvd I can't wait to get this and watch this thank you so much to whomever decided to release this on dvd!!!!

2333952,4,B0009X7BEG,"I remember That's My Mama fondly because of how funny it was and how talented the cast was.  It may not have had a long run, but like Buffalo Bill (also coming on DVD soon), the talented cast went on to bigger and better things.  That's My Mama should have had a longer run.  ABC (who doesn't learn from their mistakes) took the show in it's second season, new producers came in and made the show, quite frankly a little depressing.  The fun time in the barber shop was over and the recession was on.  That coupled with cast changes and a weak lead in show, caused this should have been classic to expire on Xmas Eve 1975.  A good show that should have had a four or five year run.  ABC would make similar mistakes with Mork and Mindy a few years later with similar results.  I am glad to see it back again and I have ordered both seasons.  I recommend you at least buy the first season, you won't be sorry.",1120521600,13,907,4.166666666666667

Clifton Davis was so cute back in that period & has gotten even sexier over the years.

I like all of the characters.  I like the two older men who were always in the barber shop. Junior was one of my favorite. His outfits were a conversational piece and I liked the way he always made his entrance. . I purchased an additional season and gave it away.

Dyer, Dewayne Jessie, Eric Laneuville, Christopher Joy, Jeffrey Burton, Davis Roberts. this pilot was intended for broadcast on ABC and why its not on here a special feature its beyond me the original pilot was good and and the entrie show worth watching",1284595200,4,881,4.547169811320755
2333999,5,B0009X7BEG,"Editing aside, I enjoy this set. Would have liked to see some commentary and special features, but that's minor.

I recall watching this when I was about 10 years old (1974-75) during it's initial run on ABC-TV. Much of the humor went over my head, as did most adult-oriented shows in those days, but I liked Ted Lange as Junior (OOOO-WEEEE!!!) and the FUNKIEST theme song to do a two-step to this side of the Godfather of Soul.

In watching this set today, I see why I didn't get it the first time. Bascially, the show dealt mostly with adult relationships and con schemes. But what makes the show work are a number of factors; clever writing, a pleasant and likeable cast, and good ensemble character-based comedy. Oddly enough, as was the case with WHAT'S HAPPENING a few years later, the cast's race is incidental and rarely mentioned.

Theodore Wilson, a familiar face from Black-oriented movies and TV shows of the 70s, plays Earl The Mailman to good effect. He originally appears as a fake lawyer in the pilot episode and another actor (less effectvely, as we see) originally played this character. Clifton Davis has the right amount of charisma and likeability to play Cliff the barber, around whom these episodes revolve, and Theresa Merritt is suberb as the title character whose wisdom (usually) saves the day in these tales. I also liked the guy who played Leonard the Nerd, Cliff's insufferable but amusing brother-in law. Also, Look for Belinda Tolbert (Jenny from the Jeffersons) as one of Cliff's many girlfriends in one story as well as Amanda Randolph & Ernestine Wade (from the Amos & Andy comedies) in some others. BTW, Wildcat is also played by Amos & Andy alum Jester Hairston who in turn would later rejoin Clifton Davis in ""Amen."" (funny how these shows cross-pollinate). He is particularly effective in the suprise ending to the tale of Cliff's father's alleged affair.

This show didn't get it's due perhaps because of the glut of Black TV Comeides in those days (Sanford & Son, Good Times, The Jeffersons, the long forgotten Tenafly, Love Thy Neighbor, etc). But the DVD age should rescue this from its undeserved obscurity. This is a good show with a heart. Enjoy.",1275523200,2,2192,4.8063660477453585
2334000,3,B0009X7BEG,"I was too young to remember this show as a child, so I was curious to see it on DVD. I was very pleased with this show. It is unfortunate it only  ran for such a short time.

This show also had a reference in John Landis' 1988 comedy, ""Coming to America"" (starring Eddie Murphy & Arsenio Hall).

Well it has been over 20 years since I have seen it air on television so I was very happy to hear that it was finally being released on DVD. In fact I was shocked since this show has never gotten the respect that it deserves. This is a very funny show that launched the careers of a few stars that we would later come to love on other shows. But this is the show were it started and it was finally being released on DVD. Well imagaine my anger when I found at that this release does not contain the orignal episodes as they first aired. This set is made up of the edited/cut syndicated episodes. Now while I have only seen the syndicated episodes I still prefer to have the original episodes as the aired in the first place. This is yet another example of studios rushing the release of a television show to make quick money rather than taking their time, putting in some effort and doing it right. Studios will continue doing this to us the consumer as long as we keep buying their inferior product. Accept nothing less than the orignal versions.

8069267,4,B0009X7BEG,"I don't know how this charming sitcom series got cancelled in the first place. The first season DVD includes three discs for the entire first season. I have never seen the series on television whether in syndication or first run so I can't explain if the episodes were edited. Regardless, I felt the show was slighted in this presentation without any special features like behind the scenes or the making of the series which was wrongfully canceled after 39 episodes.

I found this sitcom to be light-hearted and serious at times with a a terrific cast especially Clifton Davis (Amen); Theodore Wilson; Theresa Merritt; Joan Pringle; Lynne Moody; Ted Lange (The Love Boat); Jester Hairston (Amen); Gordon Jump (WKRP in Cincinatti) and Lisle Wilson in the cast. I'll never understand why the network didn't keep the series running about a young man Clifton who lives with his mother (Theresa Merritt) in Washington D.C. Clifton runs his father's barber shop, Oscar's, named after his late father. His sister Tracy (Lynne Moody) and her husband Leonard (Lisle Wilson) are also among the cast.

I enjoyed watching the series on DVD and don't recall seeing it earlier on television. If only they aired the episodes on television. I still would have liked special features about the series. It's a light-hearted series with a lovable mother played by Theresa Merritt.  Guest stars include Berlinda Tolbert (The Jeffersons) and Helen Martin (227) in the series.",1471392000,,1455,5.054166666666666
