8653437,2,B00JQYUUTW,One of the worst movies I've seen.  I bought it because one producer is an old friend.  Sorry.,1456099200,,94,4.166666666666667
8653438,5,B00JQYUUTW,"Great Indie film. This movie takes you off the conventional path of the mainstream rip'em'up horror movies

8653441,5,B00JQYUUTW,"This was an unexpected gem. I was expecting another poor-quality torture porn schlocker. But this is something different - it uses that genre as a springboard into something much more interesting. Without giving too much away, this became a psychological survival story - one that was clever, well-written, well-acted, professionally directed, sometimes humorous, and very entertaining. Side note: If you were ever a fan of the Evil Dead series, Alice Cooper, or McGuyver (and I have been a big fan of all three at one time or another), then this movie will offer you some happy little moments along the way.",1444348800,2,608,5.02970297029703
8653442,5,B00JQYUUTW,"Great movie!  Frightening, disgusting, and well written.  Calico Cooper is wonderful.  At one point I wanted to vomit.  You've got to see it to appreciate it.",1404172800,4,158,4.961538461538462
