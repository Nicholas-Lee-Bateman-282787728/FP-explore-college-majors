8101585,3,B000CS85IY,"This movie is a throwback to an earlier era of Hollywood films.  Made in 1945 and in black and white, Captain Kidd is heavy on dialogue and costumes, but not a lot of action.  Charles Loughton takes top billing as Captain Kidd, with his devious plans to capture the ship Quedagh Merchant as she sailed from India with a treasure-trove of riches.  The film is only about 90 minutes long so leaves out much of Kidd's story and exploits.  We enjoyed the movie but it was a lot different than expected.",1509840000,,498,4.43956043956044
