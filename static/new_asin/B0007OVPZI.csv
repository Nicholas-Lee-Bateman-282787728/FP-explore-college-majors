8049686,3,B0007OVPZI,"1.) Goldust w/Marlena vs Brian Pillman

The Pillman/Goldust feud that took place throughout the latter of 1997 was quite an edgy one. After being forced to wear a dress for several weeks after losing a match to Goldust at SummerSlam, Pillman raised the stakes by challenging Goldust to a rematch with a stipulation of his own. If he lost the match, he'd leave the WWF forever but if he won the match, he got Marlena to himself for 30 days and nights. All in all, a good opening match. I loved the back and forth action from these two. Pillman gets the win after snatching Marlena's purse and nailing Goldust with it for the win. Marlena tries to avoid Pillman but he forces her to the back, throws her in his car and speeds off just as Goldust arrives. Jerry Lawler retrieves Marlena's purse and reveals that a brick was inside of it. This unfortunately was Pillman's last PPV as he suffered an untimely death weeks later

2.) Scott Putski vs Brian Christopher

Relatively short match from these two. Nothing too big worth mentioning here. The bigger story going on here was that everyone was claiming Brian Christopher to be Jerry Lawler's child, which caused Lawler to get overly defensive on commentary. Putski ends up getting injured only a few short minutes in and the match is suddenly called off

3.) Faarooq vs Crush vs Savio Vega

This was an unusual yet interesting match. At the time there were 3 factions in the WWF; the Nation of Domination, Disciples of Apocalypse, and Los Boricuas. To prove whose group was the supreme, the leaders of each group fought in this Triple Threat of gang warfare so to speak. It's almost like a 90s gang movie came to the wrestling ring. The interesting thing about this match was that both Savio and Crush had served as members of the Nation earlier that year. Savio gets the victory after a spinning wheel kick on Crush. Pretty entertaining match to sit through

4.) El Torito vs Max Mini

For a short time in 1997 and even shorter time in 1998, WWF brought in these mini wrestlers to compete in the ring. Surprisingly this match gets a good reaction from the crowd in the beginning but they begin to quiet down as it progresses. A funny moment reignites the audience when Max Mini leaps on Jerry Lawler's lap and wears his crown. Max Mini gets the win with a sunset flip pin on El Dorito

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

We get an in-ring segment with Jim Ross interviewing Commissioner Slaughter about his decision to strip Dude Love and Stone Cold Steve Austin of the Tag Team Championships due to Austin's neck injury sustained at SummerSlam. Dude Love enters first and reluctantly hands over his championship before Stone Cold makes his entrance and gets in Ross' face, threatens McMahon, and challenges Slaughter to take the title from him. Austin says the WWF makes him sick and Ross gets dropped with a Stunner. McMahon contemplates getting involved, while medics and several officials including Slaughter check on Ross

5.) WWF Tag Team Championship Fatal 4 Way Match: The Headbangers vs The Godwinns vs British Bulldog and Owen Hart vs Legion of Doom

Shortly after Steve Austin and Dude Love forfeited the Tag Titles, they were up for grabs in this Fatal 4 Way Tag Team Championship match with The Headbangers replacing Austin and Dude Love. Didn't really care for this match. I never liked The Godwinns and wasn't a big fan of The Headbangers either. Unfortunately two great teams like LOD and Bulldog and Owen couldn't hold up this match with the other 2 bomber teams in this one. A few fair spots here and there but overall this didn't live up to the hype. Stone Cold makes his way back out to the ring towards the end and lays out Owen out with a Stunner while the referee had his back turned. Mosh takes advantage and gets the pinfall win; making the Headbangers the new WWF Tag Team Champions

Jim Ross is in the trainer's room with Commissioner Slaughter, pissed about getting attacked by Austin and threatens to quit the company if it happens again

6.) WWF Championship Match: The Patriot vs Bret Hart (c)

Not a bad encounter here. The Patriot and Bret really take it to each other throughout the match, giving it an A for intensity. The Patriot gets Bret in a Sharpshooter but Bret reverses it into his own and although The Patriot didn't tap, he seemingly tells the referee he gives up as Mike Chioda rings the bell and The Hitman is still the WWF Champion. Bret attacks The Patriot following the match and chokes him with the American flag to really play up the anti-American gimmick, getting him a ton of heel heat in the process.

7.) Shawn Michaels vs The Undertaker

This was a treat in and of itself as this was the first time that Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker fought each other one on one. After accidentally costing The Undertaker the WWF Championship at SummerSlam, he arrogantly went on to take pride in it and underwent a cocky heel turn in the process. This was a fun one to end the show. To play up his cowardly heel persona, Shawn hid behind the referee from The Undertaker but Taker knocks the ref's lights out. ""It's going to be one of those kind of matches"" McMahon accurately states on commentary This becomes a reoccurring scenario in this match as Michaels and Undertaker constantly knock out every referee that comes to replace the last one. The action in this match is off the charts as Undertaker and HBK go back and forth and keep the crowd entertained beginning to end in this one. The match goes to a No Contest as both Michaels and Taker get disqualified for constantly attacking referees. And in a chaotic ending, Undertaker and Michaels begin brawling that ends up being stopped with the intervention of the locker room, leaving Undertaker standing tall in the closing moments.

Overall: Not too much of a bad PPV. Ground Zero suffers from a few lackluster and filler matches but then there are those few on the card that delivered well and lived up to its hype. The amazing main event being one of them. The only noteworthy thing that really came out of Ground Zero in the end was Stone Cold's rampage and the Michaels/Taker match whose ending would lead to an even greater rematch at then next PPV in the debut of one of the company's most dangerous matches. But that's another review for another time. Overall, Ground Zero was a so-so PPV",1410825600,,7160,5.321523472099202
8049687,2,B0007OVPZI,"I guess I am just on a WWF online memory trip as this was another event that I found the internet. This In Your House was scheduled to be the most unique one of them all as this was the first time that the WWF booked this event to be a 3 hour show instead of a 2 hour show. On top of that, this would be the first time that Shawn Michaels would do battle with The Undertaker who promised to make Shawn pay for his actions at SummerSlam. Also, The Hart Foundation had alot on the line including the WWF Championship & maybe even the lost of a member.

Indecent Proposal Match: Goldust vs Brian Pillman. The storyline to this match got seriously personal since their last match at SummerSlam as this match had two stipulations in which Pillman would leave the WWF forever if he loses but if Goldust loses, then Pillman will get Marlena (Goldust's wife Terri Runnels) for 30 days. Just like the feud was built up to, this was a brawl with Goldust being more aggressive than usual till Pillman regained control. However, Karma played a factor due to what happened at SummerSlam in the end that lead to Pillman getting what wanted in his last WWF PPV match since he would die a month later.

Brian Christopher vs Scott Putski. This match never got going as Putski injured himself early allowing the match to be stopped soon after that with Lawler & Brian making jokes at Putski on the outside.

Savio Vega vs Crush vs Faarooq. Another first for the WWF on PPV as this was the first time that the WWF scheduled a triple threat match between the leaders of three different factions, Los Boricuas, The Nation & D.O.A. However for all that build up, this was a really weak triple threat match with botched spots at certain points with an ending that really made you go ""wait, that's it?"".

Max Mini vs El Torito. During this time, the WWF was having midget matches due to their working relationship with a certain company (can't remember what the name of it was though) so if you enjoy midget wrestling, give it a look, if not then you can skip this one.

Right around here was the time where Jim Ross was interviewing the WWF Tag Team Champions Stone Cold Steve Austin & Dude Love who were forced to forfeit the titles to Sgt. Slaughter due to Austin's injury at SummerSlam...but not before Austin got the last laugh by giving Jim Ross a Stone Cold Stunner that set up a series of events for weeks to come involving other WWF officials including Vince McMahon.

Elimination Match: The Headbangers vs Owen Hart & The British Bulldog vs The Legion Of Doom vs The Godwinns. This match was for the vacant WWF Tag Team Championship so this was another first for the WWF to have an elimination match for the Tag Team titles without champions. This was a good match to watch but stay tuned to the ending in where Owen got a ""Stunning"" surprise that cost his team the titles & allowing the Headbangers to win their first & only WWF titles.

WWF Champion Bret Hart vs The Patriot. The week before SummerSlam, Patriot scored a huge upset over Bret Hart with the help of Shawn Michaels so this was the rematch to that encounter. The crowd was really into this match as both men worked on different body parts throughout the match before picking the pace up with near falls that really got the crowd going along with cameos from Vader & Bulldog along with a battle of the sharpshooters at one point. This was a good match with some storytelling but the aftermath was more memorable as this was just to continue the USA/Canada storyline.

The Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels. Before the match starts, we had a hilarious botch as the pyro guys messed up Shawn's entrance due to how Shawn was acting. Due to HBK's actions at SummerSlam, this was their first match that is heavily forgotten about. Taker showed that he was out for revenge more than trying to get a victory as he showed at the opening moments by knocking out the referee. HBK takes a beating in this one as he was beaten up the ramp, down the ramp, gorilla-slammed on the stage & even knocked into the announce tables. Shawn plays the heel character perfectly by taunting the crowd & relying on Rick Rude, Hunter & Chyna getting involved to get the advantage before more referees kept being taken out along the way. The ending was something to see as the WWF locker room tried to stop the match that lead to Taker doing a dive over the top rope onto everyone just to get more of Shawn. This lead to their Hell In A Cell match a month later.

In the end, the best matches on this event can be found on other DVD releases (Pillman/Goldust on Pillman's DVD; Taker/Shawn on Taker's DVD) so this was a show that proved that WWF should have stuck to the typical 2 hour format for this event as the quality was hurt by extending it to a full three hour card.",1282694400,,4790,4.427922814982974

The match was sucking until Putski dislocated his knee cap and it's nasty looking. So Christopher wins the match. *
