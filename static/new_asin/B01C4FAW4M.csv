8752206,5,B01C4FAW4M,"Is this a perfect biography of Mario Lanza? No. It does, however, give Lanza fans and those who may have never heard of him, insights into his life and career. I first heard Lanza as a small child and was thrilled by his voice. He brought opera into the lives of many who might never had heard it. The film has interesting stories by Mario's daughter. It shows his was a joy of great joy and great sadness.  Those that want to pigeon hole Lanza as just another pop singer don't understand the magic of his voice. He never claimed to be another Caruso. That title was forced upon him.",1536796800,,583,4.3

Mario Lanza died nearly 60 years ago, so of course most of his contemporaries are gone. However it is preposterous for people who never met or saw him perform to present themselves as if they have firsthand knowledge about his life. These people are talking about what they have read or researched about Lanza, not about their personal experiences.

This is a British-produced documentary and having bought several documentaries about performers and musical groups that were made in Britain in the past, the common production is to present one person talking about a performer then cut to another person talking about the performer, etc.  Lanza's recordings are frequently used as background music in this film. The commentators talk over his singing, or we are given snippets of performances or short clips from his films.  Why won't they let the man sing? The producers attempt to compare Lanza to being a ""rock star"" in his time and assert his death preceded the ""rock star deaths"". Elvis, The Beatles, even David Bowie are mentioned during the documentary. There is even footage of a rock group performing. One of the commentators is a member of the rock group Genesis which is OK with me, and no disrespect to these talented performers, but attempting to associate Mario Lanza to other performers and types of music that became popular after Lanza passed away especially as a rock performer is pathetic. He was an operatic tenor and his exceptional voice stands out without the need to compare him to later performers in other genres.

There is a repeated obsession about Lanza's weight problems in this film. Young tenor Russell Watson who wasn't even born until 7 years after Lanza died, talks about Mario and his father eating 50 pounds of steak in a meal, as if he had firsthand knowledge of it or was there. Was the commentary in this documentary scripted and people asked to read what they were told about?

I had to stop watching the DVD after about 20 minutes of listening to all the constant blabbing by the commentators, frustrated that I couldn't see Lanza singing even one complete song. I have watched the rest of it in pieces which has been a battle. I want to tell the commentators, ""just shut up!""

I looked forward to seeing this film and sure expected more based on a title such as ""The Best of Everything"", and am just totally disgusted with it. This film is garbage.  I will never again buy a British-produced documentary film about a performer. You can find better information about Lanza on YouTube, including some full live performances.

The Lanza documentary/biography film to look for on DVD is ""Mario Lanza - The American Caruso"" which was a 1983 PBS film, nominated for an Emmy at the time. It also has a lot of people talking and limited performance footage, but includes interviews with people who actually knew Lanza and worked with him, and all four of his children share their memories (which are limited, as they were all very young when Lanza died). Unfortunately three of the four children have since died, and the better DVD is out of print. But used copies can be found for a decent price on eBay.",1525478400,,3231,4.7656529516994635
8752208,2,B01C4FAW4M,"I saw the new British documentary, ""Mario Lanza: The Best of Everything,"" today over PBS.  The quality of the enterprise is so poor that, as an example, the recording played of Enrico Caruso is of the bass aria from ""La boh&egrave;me,"" which the famous tenor once sang to assist an ill colleague, the basso Andr&eacute;s de Segurola, and recorded it as a fluke.

The present documentary strives to place Lanza above the tenors of his time, even sweeping Caruso himself away with Lanza's actual contemporaries.  But such a position ignores several important factors.  Lanza sang only one full, staged production in his life, ""Madama Butterfly,"" here in New Orleans, in 1948.  Singing arias in front of cameras or in concert in front of microphones misses the most difficult parts of a career as an opera singer.  Learning complete roles, memorizing entire operas, learning stagecraft and cooperating with stage directors and fellow singers, projecting over orchestra and chorus, singing through multiple rehearsals, followed by many performances of difficult music in front of large audiences over a period of many years.  Lanza did none of this:  Soon after that ""Butterfly,"" he was taken away by Hollywood to participate in a series of films of the lightest fare.  He was signed for ""La traviata"" in New Orleans, but withdrew in order to pursue the cinema.  (Herva Nelli was to have been the Violetta Val&eacute;ry, but was replaced by Eleanor Steber.)

His only memorable picture was ""The Great Caruso,"" and it is true it inspired many a young tenor to embark on an operatic career.  But how much was the determining factor the singing of Lanza, or the highly-fictionalized story of Caruso?

Various ""experts"" are interviewed for this documentary, including one who styles himself ""Dr Voice.""  The vagaries of Lanza's personal life and performing are glossed over.  He is termed a ""great actor,"" but surely in neither Hollywood or on the opera stage could he remotely be considered such.  In fact, he is placed above Caruso as an actor, which is a ridiculous position.  We see Lanza's singing on film, when the physical mannerisms had taken over, and the lachrymose style (to be sure, shared by many another tenor of the day) is all-encompassing.

Was it a beautiful voice?  Without question.  To most who heard that ""Madama Butterfly,"" however, it was also a small voice.  A beautiful voice is not enough for an operatic career.  In fact, it can sometimes create a level of vanity that stifles artistic development.

Hollywood seduced Lanza to compromise his talent, abandon all discipline, and ruin his health.  He died in 1959, at the age of thirty-eight, at a clinic where he was trying to lose weight for his next film appearance.",1512172800,3,2737,4.991169977924945
