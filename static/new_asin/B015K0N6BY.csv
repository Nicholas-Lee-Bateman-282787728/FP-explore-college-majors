7442572,5,B015K0N6BY,A lovely rendition. Colorful scenery and costumes. Singing is clear and easily understood.,1453680000,,90,6.0
7442573,5,B015K0N6BY,"I loved the DVD. It was exactly what I
wanted.",1453334400,,46,3.7
7442574,5,B015K0N6BY,"So pleasant in every aspect. The music, the costumes, Renee Fleming. This is a top notch perfermance, musically and artistically, everyone being perfect for the role, it all comes together beautifully. The opening dance is breathtaking, the beautiful couples, the dresses and the jewls, the opulant lights - all a feast for the eyes. Kelly O'Hara is so lovely and sweet, her voice charming and flowing. Renee Fleming looks amazingly beautiful and her voice is, of course, perfect. Such a pleasant surprise to see Sir Thomas Allen in this role. I always think of him as Don Giovanni, but the versatility of his voice is such that he can pull this off effortlessly. I could watch this performance again and again. I think that they managed to capture the essence of this piece, both in performance and stage design.",1453334400,10,813,4.856115107913669
7442575,5,B015K0N6BY,My students and I saw this production in a Met LIve in HD broadcast last year.  I am SO thrilled they are offering this performance as a dvd.  It is a gorgeous production and performance.  Thank you Met Opera House!,1452816000,3,215,4.325
7442576,5,B015K0N6BY,The Merry Widow is beautifully performed and sung in this DVD.  The Stage Direction and Choreography are excellent.  Thanks.,1451520000,4,124,5.473684210526316
7442577,5,B015K0N6BY,"I have to weigh in after these grumpy reviews. Our whole family enjoyed this when we saw it at the Met simulcast and again later on TV. English made it much more accessible for all of us, especially the kids. It is a little Broadway, but that's part of the fun. Renee Fleming's singing is lovely, Nathan Gunn is charming, Njegus is funny and Kelli O'Hara is all of the above. Very enjoyable - like opera comfort food. A family favorite.",1450828800,6,436,4.395061728395062
7442578,4,B015K0N6BY,"This is a very beautiful production of the Merry Widow. My only regret is that it is in English. I did not mind the spoken dialogues so much, but the German lyrics of all the sung parts  were so much missed. In fact the libretto used in English is not a true translation of the original German. The sung parts sound so different, so Broadwayan, and this is not a Broadway musical. The American musicals are very beautiful too but they are not
Wiener or even French operettas.  As with most operas people do not necessarily have to understand what the singers are saying if they sing it well. The best example today is the modern opera productions where singers sing and act differently from what the libretto words intend.
To me all the singers were good, specially Flemming. I have heard Nathan Gunn in better voice (War and Peace).",1449792000,4,833,4.546666666666667
7442579,3,B015K0N6BY,"I put this in the player with limited expectations and in that sense only, was not disappointed, My sense is that the Met cast this as a vehicle for Renee Fleming, much as they did a few years ago with Rossini's Armida with similar results. Fleming is now a bit too old to play Hanna effectively, and her voice, which has been a splendid instrument in the past, no longer is. Much the same might be said of the rest of the cast: Nathan Gunn is a bland Danilo, Alek Scrader lacks the depth of voice for Camille and so on.

Staging is also a bit flat: the Widow should bubble like freshly poured champagne; this one iis like a bottle that has been left out overnight.

For anyone looking for a performance of this operetta that achieves its potential, try the version on Art Haus with Dagmar Schellenberger (Hanna), Rodney Gilfrey (Danilo) and Piotr Beczala (Camille) from Zurich. One is also directed to the nearly as exciting version form the 2005 Seefestspiele Morbisch with Margarita Del Arellano in the title role, and Matthis Hausmann as her Danilo. Either of thesw (preferably both, if one is as addicted to this stuff as is your friendly reviewer) will provide a wonderful evening, with the kind of sparkle required.

This one is for die hard Fans of Renee.",1448928000,5,1263,4.579646017699115
7442580,5,B015K0N6BY,"Operetta as it should be presented. Perfect performances from all; first rate rich entertainment; one of Fleming's best performances. This is so much fun; this is so much fun; THIS IS SO MUCH FUN!

7442581,3,B015K0N6BY,"Not the best, not the worst, but my great expectations from a Met production of the splendid operetta by Franz Lehar have been almost totally disillusioned. Why? The story of THE MERRY WIDOW is just interesting and perhaps even better than the french forgotten play from which it derives. Here almost all is boring because of lack of humour even if the bravo maestro Sir Andrew Davis is excellent in giving Lehars music the real beauty it has. Its a pity that as usual there are cuts in the score, I mean the delightful cake-walk of the third act, kept off to add more cancan chez Maxims and add the extraordinarily beautiful waltz from Lehars PAGANINI to give  Rene Fleming a great moment to show her vocal qualities. The acting is poor or even less than poor even if it is, in a way, faithful to the original style. The actors are surrounded by heavy scenery and the costumes are not surprisingly chic. The role of Njegus may be acceptable but the actor seems to play each speech as if he says the most amusing sentences. The voices are not first-rate; Rene Fleming is indeed full of dignity but sometimes you may have nostalgic positive souvenirs of Dagmar Schellenberger or Sigrid Martikke or Beverly Sills or the splendid Gwyneth Jones in one of the best productions of DIE LUSTIGE WITWE - I mean the 1979 production of the Deutsche Oper Belin conducted by Caspar Richter in the Inszenierung by August Everding. La Jones was surrounded by a marvellous cast: Ren Kollo, the great Siegfried Jerusalem, Lucy Peacock ....  Now it comes to my mind the Vilja-Lied in this Met mise en scne: the direction is ridiculous - I have never seen Hanna Glawari walking so much during this jewel aria. Rene Fleming has her magic moments and she is lovely. Well, in conclusion, I dare say its a useless production and pardon me if I do not cheer this performance as the audience does, but let me also add that  this performance may be watched without rage ... as it happened, on the contrary, for example, with a more than horrible production of the viennese Staatsoper (one of the most infamous performances of DIE LUSTIGE WITWE) ...  but, here, after all and before all, the music of Franz Lehar may appease some reservations. Evviva Lehar, always!",1448409600,13,2238,4.643939393939394
7442582,5,B015K0N6BY,Loved it. Renee Fleming and Nathan Gunn are superb in their roles. The music is ethereal.,1494892800,,89,4.625
7442583,3,B015K0N6BY,"The Merry Widow is one of the most glorious of all the operettas of the early 20th century. This is the Metropolitan Opera's version. Franz Lehar's  music is indeed glorious, but some of the acting isn't so good. If you want a superior version of The Merry Widow, check out the San Francisco Opera's version from 2001.",1494115200,3,318,4.578947368421052

7442605,5,B015K0N6BY,"ALL REGION SURPRISE.!!!  After seeing this on a TV broadcast I wanted the BluRay. And I was surprised that Amazon only offered the D2 region (will not play on most U.S. players). I looked at the back page, enlarged it and scrolled down to the bottom and it was printed ""All Regions"". I did order it and it played to perfection on my 8 year old BluRay player. This production is Operetta at it's very best. Please do not take my word regarding the ""All Regions"". Check it out for yourself and ""ENJOY"" !!!",1460937600,,503,4.351063829787234

A/V production values are excellent ... looks and sounds great on my 65"" OLED ... in some respects better than the live performance!  I've been to the Met many times and often the view is poor, the acoustics are so-so and the audience is loud.",1459209600,,336,4.475409836065574

7442608,1,B015K0N6BY,"Well, in the face of all these high marks, I'm sorry, but I must differ.  The production was simply depressing. Dark, dark, dark designs.  Nathan Gunn, surprisingly, not up to it. The usual nonsense small roles were in the ""Don't just stand there..do anything!"" variety.  I accept that there is not much character scope in the ever changing libretto, but allowing singers to arrange their own business is death. Ms Fleming was her usual delight, save her wardrobe, which made her look dumpy. Kelly O""Hara was the surprise of the night.  Just charming. The same cannot be said for her Camille.
All in all, an huge disappointment .",1457308800,7,629,4.796296296296297

8733859,5,B015K0N6BY,"Finally the Met is releasing their operas on blu-ray.  This 'merry widow' is a delight for several reasons.
First, it is bound to please those who don't relish reading subtitles.
Second, Renee Fleming is not too old to play the part of Hannah....getting older, but she pulls it off
admirably, and it is convincing.
Third, the set changes for which this production is renowned are indeed worthy of renown.
Fourth, blu-ray...for opera and orchestra...is without doubt a sonic improvement (stereo, not multi-channel)
over standard DVD, and of course the hi-def video brings its own appeal.",1522022400,,586,5.168421052631579
