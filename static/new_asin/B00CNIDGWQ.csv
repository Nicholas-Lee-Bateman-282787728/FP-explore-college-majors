5731247,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"Joseph Kony, like Idi Amin decades before him, is one of the most ruthless military men that Africa has ever seen.

His military campaign against villages in Uganda has literally left hundreds of thousands of orphans and unfortunately child soldiers whom have been recruited to do his bidding.

In the wake of this catastrophe, retired high school teachers from Oregon-- Bob and Carol Higgins-- found themselves in 1999 as visitors on a trip to Africa.  What they found on their ""vacation trip"" altered their lives.

***
The story also deals with inmates at a federal prison system in Oregon.  Several of the inmates have turned their passion for art into a missionary tool to help fund the clothing and housing expenses for many of the orphans now under the care of The Higgins.

The details of this story is phenomenal: just as the tragedy of these orphans are heart-wrenching so are how the lives of unsuspecting people coming together, inspiring.

This is a wonderful story about compassion in the face of tragedy and redemption for those who've committed crimes and are looking for a way to contribute to the betterment of a society.

This story is truly, spiritually enriching.",1377475200,,1183,4.909547738693467
5731248,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"It is easy to become cynical in today's world with its wars, violent upheavals and truly evil outcomes.  Those of us who read newspapers, watch television and follow political events are often overwhelmed and even depressed as we search in vain for something to uplift our spirits, to give us hope.  Then, along comes ""Lost and Found"" a documentary introducing us to orphans in Uganda, those child-soldiers who were abducted from village life, as was nine-year-old Patricia Anyango and hundreds of others who were used, abused and even forced to kill or be killed. Not only were they ""lost"" to civilized society while they were captives, they also continued to be lost psychologically even after they escaped or were freed.  The story of how two retired teachers from  Oregon, found the orphans and also unexpectedly connected them with hardened convicts in an Oregon prison, is inspirational, overwhelmingly positive and an instant cure for our cynicism. These lost souls were worlds apart.  How could they possibly help or change one another?

As you begin to watch Sandy Cummings' exceptional documentary, stunningly narrated by NBC's Bruce Cummings, be prepared to be unable to move until its final scene is completed.  What was life-changing for the orphans and the prisoners will also change your life.  The interviews with the children in Uganda and the prisoners in Oregon are so compelling and inspirational, you will be moved to tears.

Yes, good can overcome evil.  Those ""lost"" in our world are not only capable of being ""found"" but can go on to change the world for the better while helping one another.

When the film is over, you emerge believing it should be required viewing for all who feel lost in today's depressive headlines. Not only will viewers find hope, they will be uplifted to a new level of positive action.",1374364800,,1836,4.967320261437909

5731250,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"I have watched Lost and Found many times, and each time it moves me to tears.  What many of us as Americans take for granted; safety, a home, 3 meals a day and a loving family is not a reality for these orphans in Uganda Africa.  This film is very well done, it shows how ordinary people can make an extraordinary difference in lives halfway around the world with the help and direction of the Lord.  It opens others world view and inspires a call to action.  It takes so little to help these helpless orphans, even the inmates in Eastern Oregon have found a way to help. Many thanks to Sandy Cummings for bringing much deserved attention to this unique human interest story.",1371945600,2,675,4.419354838709677
5731251,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"Child soldiers in Africa orphaned by violent militia, hard-core inmates in Eastern Oregon and  two retired school teachers on holiday in Africa - now that's a perfect storm we didn't see coming. Yet they weave together in the film LOST AND FOUND in the most compelling film story. Sandy Cummings and her many talented film crew supporters have taken one of the most harsh and devastating topics weaving it into a story of hope. Human kindness, sacrifice, passion for a cause and dedication to making a difference often gets lost in the media. We hear the stories murderous vicious  attacks by the Kony militia - LOST AND FOUND goes to the core with  the story of orphans who survived and the unlikely combination of people who changed their lives. The film entertains, but more than that - it provides the inspiration for any of us to choose a way to make a difference.",1371859200,3,869,4.666666666666667
5731252,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"Even though this story presents hard cold facts of life that most of us can never imagine in our lifetimes, it is done in such a beautiful way that it will haunt you forever. It has moved me to never take for granted my life as it is today nor will I ever be able to stop wanting to pay forward my good fortune whether it be huge or meager. My question will always remain, why did I get to be me and not one of them?",1371859200,2,416,3.793103448275862
5731253,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"While the subject matter of the stolen children of Uganda being tortured and forced into being child soldiers has been much publicized, what doesn't often make the news are the stories of human hope and rebuilding that do exist. There is much in Lost and Found to break your heart, but it doesn't leave you there. It takes you to a place where children can be saved and laugh again. Where the universe asked one married couple to do more than they could even imagine they had the power to offer, and the decisions they made changed not only many lives, including their own, but perhaps even the country of Uganda. Where broken lives living behind bars can still find purpose, and can reach beyond cell walls to help build a better world thousands of miles away.

When it is done, you'll want to go to Uganda to have fresh cinnamon rolls.",1371772800,,837,4.506578947368421
5731254,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"A powerful example of beautiful storytelling, artfully revealing how the lives of people continents apart are intertwined. Sandy and Bruce Cummings tell this story with compassion and candor, and the viewer gets the full sense of their professionalism intellectually, emotionally and visually while taking this important journey. This documentary gives the viewer a look into the complex lives of others and inspires pride in the human spirit.",1371772800,,443,5.626865671641791

8583779,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"You may know about this film workshop that takes every June in Culpeper Virginia that is known as Mostly Lost. For over three days, historians, scholars and fans try to identify silent films that no longer have their opening and closing titles. But many fans (including myself) haven't been able to make the trek down there to experience the fun and that's where Undercrank Productions comes in. Now for the first time, Undercrank brings that magic to the fans in the comfort of their own home with their latest dvd  release, FOUND AT MOSTLY LOST.

This one of a kind dvd shines the spotlight on past Mostly Lost workshops with 11 extremely rare (mostly silent) films spanning from 1911 to 1940 all presented here for the first time on dvd. Six silent comedies, two melodramas, two all talking shorts and one test footage are included here. Below are the films that have been identified and that is presented on this disc.

THE NICKEL SNATCHER ('20) An Arrow comedy featuring underrated comedian Hank Mann and with direction by Charley Chase who also appears in the film as one of the crooks. This film was originally released as a two reeler but only a single reel survives today.

FIDELITY ('11) A Pathe melodrama with forgotten screen actress Gertrude Norman

THE PAPER HANGER'S REVENGE ('18) A Bob Duncan comedy, shortly after the split with Lloyd Hamilton in the ""Ham And Bud"" series. Kewpie Morgan also stars.

A BRASS BUTTON ('11) Reliance drama.

JERRY'S PERFECT DAY ('16)A Cub comedy featuring forgotten screen clown, George Ovey.

ONE MILLION B.C. ('40) Test Footage

VENTRILOQUIST ('27) A Lee Deforest all talking short of William Frawley in a vaudville act.

FIFTEEN MINUTES ('21) Hal Roach short featuring fan favorite, Snub Pollard.

IN AND OUT (20/21?) Featuring Monty Banks and Cliff Bowes. Possibly originally distributed by the fledgling Warner Bros. who released comedy shorts in the early 20s.

GRIEF ('21) An Educational Mermaid Comedy with Jimmy Adams.

THE JOYRIDE ('28) An early FBO all talking short featuring Vaudville stars, George LaMaire and Joe Phillips.

Out of the 11 films here, several suffer from nitrate decomp and have been preserved with the prints looking really good to excellent on this disc and the great musical scores are provided by Phillip Carli, Ben Model and Andrew Simpson. In all, this is hands down a must have for your video library and hopefully this will become a regular dvd series in the future. Undercrank Productions is the new leader in the home video market on getting very rare silent comedies that no one will release to modern day film fans, so do yourself a favor on pick up your copy and checkout Mostly Lost in June.",1460937600,13,2682,4.878854625550661
8583780,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"Painting remained popular after the invention of photography and live musical performances are tremendous money makers despite the invention of recorded music.  Most unfortunately silent film comedy disappeared from the cultural consciousness after the invention of sound film.  Silent film comedy stalwart, historian, and musical accompanist Ben Model, and his crew, and the Library of Congress, toiled to bring us these gems of silent comedy that were originally slated for oblivion after their initial runs.  These films were shown at a film identification workshop hosted by the LOC.  Most of these films are not intact and gives the viewer an indication how fragile these old films are.  There is a well rounded selection of comedians and studios with a sprinkling of early talkie comedies and dramatic and test footage.  Thanks Ben and the LOC for a fine disc of antique film to watch.  May we have another?",1460419200,3,913,5.170068027210885
8583781,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"This is a fascinating disk. Take three parts entertainment, mix in two parts archeology, an equal share of sleuthing, along with carefully prepared scores, and you end up with a satisfying buffet of tasty cinematic fare. Platitudes aside, this item should appeal to anyone interested is our cinematic heritage. Though many of the performers and technicians found on this DVD are hardly household names, they all deliver the goods, and it's gratifying to see them once again plying their trades. I was particularly taken with the naturalistic acting contained within the short drama, ""A Brass Button"". It goes a long way toward dispelling the commonly prevailing notion that early performances were 'over the top'. For a film from 1911, it still packs a poignant punch. Special thanks go out to Ben Model and Undercrank Productions for sharing this disk with the rest of us, as well as all the fine folks who have attended the 'Mostly Lost' conferences hosted by the Library of Congress, and have breathed fresh life into these undeservedly forgotten gems.",1460332800,,1055,5.068965517241379

8583784,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"The gems on ""Found at Mostly Lost"" include William Frawley doing a vaudeville act in sound in a film found from 1927, and in Grief (1921) there is a very valuable find, children imitating Chaplin and Jackie Coogan from the The Kid (also released in 1921not shown on this disc obviously)! It shows the depth of Chaplin's fame to show children imitating HIM on screen. As well, from 3 years before Chaplin's grand entrance to film history, in 1914, we see a film that edifies one of Chaplin's early remarks that all his early comedies needed was ""a park bench, a policeman and  a woman."" As those three essential elements inhabit an early film not as well made as Chaplin's, but, I admit a bias. Other gems show up in settings, vaudeville acts that feature two comedians with a repartee that show wise-guy-hood including attempted knockabout punches at a woman, when asking her out on a date and off beat early Lou Costello-like sound effects. It's all fascinating and raw, and given that one might not have had the opportunity to attend the Mostly Lost conferences in Virginia in 2012 - 2014, this DVD provides glimpses of what film historians ""jaw about"" with passion. Hurrah to Ben Model and Undercrank Productions for the finely produced DVD that charms those with great interest and perhaps those with casual observance. There has to be something here to teach any film student. The pearl of this production for me was that we see less successful comedians and acrobats who may have been heroes and stars in their day, but have not had the lasting affect that the known Kings of Comedy had. Though, some of the gags are stellar and we see other uses of trains and autos an even Snub Pollard doing a spectacular back flip off a moving bicycle built for two.",1459555200,6,1759,4.655948553054662
8583785,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"The title of this DVD says it all. While many wait for the discovery of lost films like London After Midnight this DVD brings us films that are not lost but have instead lost their provenance. For the last few years film scholars and film buffs have gathered in Culpepper Va. to watch films that are ""mostly"" unknown. Viewers try to identify the films that little or nothing is known about. With the help of the people watching these films there origins and players are rediscovered. This collection is a result of the detective work. Anyone interested in early films will delight in these offerings. These films while great in and of themselves gives hope for what new discoveries are waiting to be found.",1459468800,4,706,4.701612903225806
8583786,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"I thought ""Lost and Found"" was a terrific DVD story about the plight of orphans in Uganda. I am particularly impressed by the couple from Oregon who have dedicated their declining years to the parenting of these lost children. I am also a little worried about their safety in such a chaotic country. May they have conyinued success.",1380758400,,332,4.741379310344827
8583787,5,B00CNIDGWQ,"""Lost & Found"" is the inspirational documentary about Bob and Carol Higgins and their work to help the orphans of Uganda. In 1999 Bob and Carol went to Uganda from the United States and have not come back to stay since. They were captivated by the need of the children of Uganda orphaned by AIDS and civil wars and terrorized by Joseph Kony.

They helped found the Otino Waa Children's Village so that the ""night commuters"" (children in dire need) would have a place to live.

The story also includes the story of felon artists at the Snake River Correctional facility in Oregon that sell their art to help fund Otino Waa.

Director Sandy Cummings has made an excellent film about these children and their needs but also how they are healing and growing strong.

My only complaint - I wish the entire film had been subtitled in English. I am partially deaf and it was difficult to understand parts of the film, with accents, etc.

NOTE: I received a copy of this film in exchange for my honest review.",1377734400,2,1001,4.538888888888889
