4188347,3,B003SHVY5M,"Judge Mike Rubino, DVD Verdict--Typeface, a one-hour PBS documentary by Justine Nagan, explores a dying art form once responsible for America's most unique advertisements. The documentary situates itself at the wood type Mecca, the Hamilton Wood Type Museum in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. Hamilton being the largest wood type manufacturer for quite some time, it now houses a massive museum collection in danger of extinction.

The documentary is less about the printing process (although it does cover some of that), and more about the rise and fall and current revival of wooden type and manual printing methods. Once all the rage in the 19th Century, Hamilton soon found itself outpaced by new printing methods and shifting industry trends. The museum, run by a staff of one (maybe a few others if you count the retirees), enjoys something like 20 visitors a month. Most of them are folks like me: graphic designers interested in the ways things were, prior to Adobe and Bezier pen tools.

For a designer, the story of Hamilton, the museum, and the folks that work there, is fascinating. Their day-to-day operations, the professors that visit there, and the print shops that still employ those techniques are all here to geek-out over. Typeface isn't, however, as accessible or as well put-together as something like Helvetica. The personal interest stuff is an afterthought, and I never felt a real connection to any of the ""characters""--short of maybe the curator who doesn't like to make prints. There isn't very much of a story arc; Hamilton is in trouble, but its story of possible bankruptcy doesn't have a sense of urgency or doom. Instead, the documentary trudges forward, making things like the historical society board meetings merely a footnote in the warehouse's fate. There's not really a bigger picture here, and unlike feature-length design documentaries, this PBS film is a niche product.

4188348,4,B003SHVY5M,"This interesting documentary covers two parallel stories at once - and adds a third one that will be of interest to graphic designers.

The small (population 13,000) town of Two Rivers, Wisconsin - which prides itself on being the Home of the Ice Cream Sundae, the economy has taken it's toll. It's largest employer - the Hamilton Wood Type Company - closed up shop years ago. Over it's history the company under priced its competitors and bought them up. Then it went out of business. Al, that remains is the huge factory. And the townsfolk turned it into a Museum, with a sole ""Director"". But Two Rivers is not on any major route so no one knows about it. On a good week, maybe 20 visitors come by, not much to use to pay the Director. The Town Council creates three more small museums but it's the ice cream sundaes that bring in the only real money ($500+ in a week!).

Director Justine Nagan follows the two parallel stories of the underused museum and the town losing its residents. But there is a third story and that is the history of the sign printing industry and how young graphic designers, trained on modern PCs are going back to the ""roots"" of the industry. A professor of Art Design at Purdue University in Indiana makes the 3-hour-plus journey to Two Rivers to teach students in how to use the amazing amount of graphically-interesting wooden type pieces in modern design. We meet a co-op of young artists who are spending time manually setting the typeface to recreate old posters. And there is a discussion of whether the painstaking work required to manually set the wooden type is superior than what I computer program can do.

The film is just over an hour and I found it interesting to watch. The bonus features consist of about 11 deleted scenes, which expand on the film.

This is both the story of a town surviving an economic downturn and a history of the lost art of manually ""setting type"". As a bonus there is the sound track that consists of about eight songs composed and performed by singer Josh Ritter.

4188349,5,B003SHVY5M,"Justine Nagan takes us deep inside the the lost craftsmanship of the print-age in this beautifully edited film. By focusing on one quaint museum in rural America, this film gives us more than a history of wood type, it delights us with a comprehensive sense of the soul and passion poured into this craft.

Typeface prompts the viewer to take a break from our chaotic world, to observe, to savor, and to simply appreciate. Full of textures, flaws and wrinkles, the ambiance of this film will invite you to reach out and touch, and even to lean close and sniff.  Even a person not interested in the history of wood type will appreciate the characters and feelings in this wonderful film.",1290988800,7,686,4.661157024793388
4188350,2,B003SHVY5M,"The beginning portion of the film is by far the better portion and more aligned with learning about traditional Type practices. Even so, the first portion's view of Type and its history is very limited. Only focusing on one particular town in all the country struggling to keep their local typesetting museum alive. The main point of the film is to create an appreciation of the history and the lost craft through technology. The issue is the film never expands beyond this small minor town except for a trip to Chicago where the documentary turns into a self promotion for the creator's local designers/friends and Chicago's Renegade Craft Fair.

Films I would recommend before this is Helvetica, and Art & Copy among others. Those films are focused on the subject matter they are titled after and reveal a full view of the subjects and their contemprary standings. This film seems to try to replicate Helvetica stylistically.",1284508800,5,927,4.9423076923076925

8404356,5,B003SHVY5M,"I am a trustee of a printing museum that has a large collection of wood type (and about 190 cases of foundry type).  We also have several Hamilton catalogs of wood type, but I had no idea that the story of Hamilton wood type could be so interesting.  And after the company went out of business,  the attempts on the part of interested townspeople in making the plant a working museum is a story very much like our own Marshfield Sun Printing Museum at Coos Bay, Oregon.  For anyone interested in hand set printing, or in saving a historic property in their home town. I highly recommend this documentary video.",1404691200,,610,4.5181818181818185
8404357,4,B003SHVY5M,"Loved the film. It really opened my eyes and gave me a deep appreciation for the long lost craft of wooden type and letterpress. I'm from Wisconsin, but never knew the museum existed in Two Rivers. Now I know where I'll be visiting this summer.",1402358400,,244,4.444444444444445
8404358,3,B003SHVY5M,"Well...

I had hoped for something with more typographically oriented content.  Like the ""Helvetica"" movie.

This is a fascinating human interest story about an old wood-type factory, from back when they printed big circus billboards with real type made of wood.  Posters and such.  Lots more about the personalities and lost-art human interest than about the actual type, though.

It didn't really include any of the history or interest IN the type faces.

Good for a human-interest documentary - not so good if you're interested in type faces.",1396137600,,545,5.125

8404360,5,B003SHVY5M,"Type Face is a must see film for graphic designers and anyone involved in art, type setting, or printing. It is about an
obscure type house in Michigan in the middle of nowhere that is a museum of type, a printhouse for artists interested in Intaglio and Letterpress
printing and a type production house, done the old fashioned way. Inspires a love for the process of creating
fonts and the skill needed to create type. The production of this video has not only generated a new interest
in Typography, but is also generating much needed income to keep the Michigan facility in business. It is
also generating interest in resurrecting small type houses across America. What an exciting revival.
Yes, we've come a long way with computer typesetting, but something has been lost in the ""progress"". There is
much to be said about the tactile aspects of this art form, not to be missed.",1353801600,,881,4.7272727272727275
8404361,5,B003SHVY5M,"This documentary is, on the surface, about the Hamilton Wood Type Museum in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, but really it's about tensions in the hipster aesthetic.  Wood type is an excellent subject because it is the epitome of the authentic - it is relatively difficult to use, has a natural grain, and is a dying art form.  Many graphic designers are drawn to it, but also need to make a living.  That's where the opposite of wood type comes in - polymer.  Polymer is absolutely inauthentic as a medium, being quite literally plastic, but it can be made in any size and can help letterpress artists make a living.

The documentary explores the tension between authenticity and convenience, between the need to be true to one's self and one's hipster identity and the need to make a living.

One of the interesting subthemes of the movie is the contrast between the way the original workers at the Hamilton factory interact with the type and the way the hipsters do.  For the workers, wood type was a way of making a living, not primarily a means of expression.  For the hipsters, this is reversed.

This is a fascinating documentary and one I'd recommend to a wide audience.",1317600000,7,1168,4.658536585365853
