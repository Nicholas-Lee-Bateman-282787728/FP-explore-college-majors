8624692,3,B00GMM10SQ,"First off, if something claims to be for a beginner i would expect it to start from the beginning. That means before you even get into the software instruction be sure
the student knows how to connect the interface (whats that?) and cables correctly. Nothing is mentioned about any of that. Secondly, the video qualtity is very
poor. I could have given 1 star for video quality alone. For some unknown reason (no pun intendent) this production appears to have been produced in the 1970's
way before the era of HD video. Really poor quality. I would not buy again or recommend to others videos from this company. One last thing, the guy giving the
instruction is dull and seems bored with the whole thing. Not very inspirational to those watching or trying to learn the material. Im sure there are better tutorials
Out there for reason or better yet get on youtube. Anything is almost better than this.",1395705600,2,901,4.672955974842767
