8336173,4,B001QQ75C8,"Episode 1 - October 1968: With Bobby Darin and Mitzi Gaynor. Darin elevates the proceedings with several spots, does alot of characters, works well in sketches. His fans should know about this item. Humour is hard to detect otherwise; in fact, the real amusement is watching very gifted people work around the juvenile drivel. (Usually the work of 11-13 writers).
Some good lines bleed through ""The Party"" set piece, with some very engaging characters, go-going it up, then blurting something out when the music stops.
Judy Carne pulls off some semi-scandalous dance moves...without JC and her images on this show, I doubt the ratings would have been as high.

Episode 2: January, 1970: With Peter Lawford and Bing Crosby (with famous Nixon impressionist, David Frye). Alot of political humour, some quite literate and edgy for the time. Production numbers, as usual, of a high caliber. By this season, the viewers were used to the bad jokes buttressed by entertaining set pieces and a slew of catch-phrases - too many to mention.
A big plus was the presence of Lily Tomlin.
