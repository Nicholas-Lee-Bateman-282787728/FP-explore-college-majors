7994801,1,B0000A03KE,The picture quality is very poor and sound is very bad as well. I am very disappointed my advice is save your money,1490572800,,115,4.043478260869565
7994802,2,B0000A03KE,I viewed the DVD from Miracle Pictures which looks to be complete at 101 min. but is in full screen and low quality.  I would avoid this and get the Warner Archive in it's proper OAR.,1453420800,,183,4.083333333333333

7994804,3,B0000A03KE,"This unusual little spy-vs.-spy-vs.-agency thriller is satisfactorily entertaining, thanks in large part to Richard Widmark's anchoring gravitas and a story that lulls you into a false sense of genre-weariness, then steps on the gas with some exciting turns-of-plot that pay unexpected dividends on your investment of time... and speaking of time, the Warner Archive release of 'The Sell-Out' (1976)-- an Israeli-Italian-British co-production that suffers often from its amateurish production values, including a score better suited to 'Shaft' than something trying to appeal to the international-espionage market-- features the full 101-minute version of the film rather than the 88 minutes described in Amazon's specs listed above (likely referring to the edited-for-television cut that has been circulating in the public domain for years).  Anamorphic-widescreen picture is sharp, though apparently not restored (there are a couple sizeable tears in the source print), colors are vivid and sound is consistently clear, which has been known to be a problem with these no-frills, made-on-demand DVD-Rs.  Movie rates 3-plus stars, presentation/price 3 stars.",1374192000,3,1158,5.92814371257485
7994805,3,B0000A03KE,"I was a little dissappointed in this  flick, Widmard playes a weak role in the story plot, and looks like he was just doing the movie for the money, his heart was not in it.",1368057600,,173,3.942857142857143
7994806,4,B0000A03KE,"Warner Archive continues to uncover some rare titles from their library and here's a British/Israeli production from 1976 that's been kicked around budget VHS and DVD labels in sometimes shoddy transfers.  Throw them all away for here we have a beautiful 1.85 transfer of Director Peter Collinson's Espionage caper 'THE SELL OUT'.  Directed in a very straight forward manner resembling a TV movie of the week, it boasts a great cast and a tricky plot twist but takes a long time getting going.  The endurance of friendship is put to the test along with the test of endurance on the audience's patience as we have both heads of the CIA and KGB deciding to eliminate their top operatives once they are no longer in the field.  Unfortunately , they decide to get rid of Gabriel Lee played by Oliver Reed with a very good American accent who smells double cross and pays a visit to his old friend and mentor played intensely by Richard Widmark for aide in alluding his assassins.  Thrown into the mix is Gayle Hunnicutt who plays Widmark's wife and who had a past history with Reed and you have a triangle of danger.  The underrated character actor Vladek Sheybal who cameoed at the beginning of Director Terence Young's Connery Bond 'FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE'-1964 and played the memorable villain Maynard in Director Geoffrey Reeve's excellent 'PUPPET ON A CHAIN'-1972 again shines as the Dutchman, an assassin extroadinaire who will stop at nothing in bringing Reed to his demise.  Director Sam Wanamaker takes a turn at thespianship as the head of the CIA.  The only beef is that it could have been more tightly edited and in spots , its very slow going.  Available through Amazon.com as a DVD-R , the price is kinda steep but worth it for all you Spy fans out there. Pretty good bantering between Reed and Widmark makes this endurance test worth experiencing and shows what great actors they truly were. All in all, it makes for a memorable cat and mouse thriller.",1302739200,5,1962,4.730205278592376
7994807,4,B0000A03KE,"***1/2 1976. Israeli co-production directed by Peter Collinson. The CIA and the KGB decide to eliminate Gabriel Lee, a spy currently working for the Russians. Lee finds refuge at Sam Lucas's home. Sam is a former CIA agent who retired a few years before. If you like spy thrillers on location, check this one. The film is not a masterpiece but is still watchable although the copy presented by Westgate is far from being perfect (VHS quality, no more). In fact, I really appreciate the mood of the American spy thrillers of the late 60's and the 70's. There are always car chases and explosions with a cool jazz-pop musical score easily recognizable. I also liked, in the SELL OUT, the streets of the old Jerusalem (empty most of the time because of the shooting) and the performance of Oliver Reed. Recommended.",1237507200,3,812,4.725352112676056
7994808,3,B0000A03KE,"As the first reviewer said, the direction of this is clunky at best.  The acting is good, but this is one of the poor efforts that Read made for money  when his career was derailing due to drinking and simple laziness.  Widmark is quite good, as are the Israeli operatives, and you believe their tragedy.  What I most liked about the film is that more is left unexplained and while Read gives a bit of a soliloquy at the end, it is not clear what all the agendas were and no simple labels seem to apply.

This is above average for a spy film, but could have been much much better.",1197158400,,580,4.1891891891891895
7994809,2,B0000A03KE,"In this work filmed entirely in Israel, Richard Widmark gamely portrays Sam Lucas, a ""retired"" CIA operative who discovers that he is involuntarily back in action due to the sudden urging of his former initiate Gabriel Lee (Oliver Reed) who has been turned by the Soviet Union and now wants to come back into the American fold, not realizing that both players in the game have sent assassins to Israel to eliminate him, and Lucas as well. The direction is flabby with undue emphasis being placed upon silly and, naturally, superfluous stunts and car chases, with an inappropriate free hand being given to Gayle Hunnicut, playing the wife of Lucas and former lover of Lee, whose melodramatism proves distortive for what should be the critical scenes in this leaden affair, while the pudgy Englishman Reed, ill-advised to strip to the waist, has his lines dubbed in order to present an acceptable American accent.",1114473600,6,911,4.96078431372549
