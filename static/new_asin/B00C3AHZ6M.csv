8576965,5,B00C3AHZ6M,"Great lesson in this anime. It is not the job that moves one forward but the positive attitude that one has. I went back to school after working a professional job when I was in my 20s. Washed dishes and waited tables between classes. I can relate to this story very much.

Imagine Sauron being banished from Middle Earth and landing in modern day Tokyo. He can no longer use magic and has to work at McDonalds to survive.

This has a tightly written and coherent plot. The characters act intelligent and there is no fan service or nose bleeds. There is a lot of good dry humor based on the irony of the situations.

One of the themes is growth and redemption by working with and understanding those around you.

It is a fun smart anime and makes a great introduction anime for adults.",1394323200,5,785,4.393103448275862
