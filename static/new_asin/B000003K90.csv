7902584,5,B000003K90,"As others have stated, this is a must-have for fans of the shape-shifter.  Regaining his abilities is a small aspect of this beautifully scripted tale focusing on Odo as a member of THE GREAT LINK and his attempts to ""teach"" the young changeling. Character actor James Sloyan returns as ""Dr. Mora"" and also adds an element to the well-crafted installment.
Also makes one wonder: How do shape-shifters ""reproduce""?",1047686400,,413,5.073529411764706
7902585,4,B000003K90,"This episode deals with the issue of parenthood...and what that really means.  There are two storylines going on here - one involving the birth of the baby Kira has been carrying for the O'Briens, and the other involving Odo and his old nemisis, Dr. Mora.
As Kira gives birth, Chief O'Brien and Shakaar spar over their respective roles in the big event.  At the same time, Quark lets Odo in on his most recent acquisition - a baby changling.
As Kira's labor continues, Odo, Dr. Bashir and Dr. Mora (the Bajoran who ""discovered"" Odo's true nature) work with the sickly changling, trying to bring it back to health and to get it to grow.
In the end, both Kira and Odo experience a sense of loss...but were the experiences they had worth the pain they now feel?
I really enjoyed this episode - espeically the storyline involving Odo, Mora, and the baby changling.  I give this episode 4 stars and call it a ""must see"" for Odo fans!",1008201600,3,928,4.511904761904762
7902586,4,B000003K90,"This episode serves to round-off two of Deep Space Nine's best storylines,  Odo regains his shapeshifting abilities and Kira FINALLY gives birth.
Quark sells Odo a gooey orange looking thing, you guessed it, a  Changeling. Except this Shapeshifter is only a baby and is sick. So Odo  must help it, and while he teaches new things to the wannabe-Founder he  realises some new things about himself. Then Dr. Mora arrives on DS9, the  man who brought up Odo as an infant, the same man that Odo dislikes so  much. Dr. Mora wants to help the baby Changeling with his knowledge of Odo,  but the Constable wants him to go back to Bajor. When the baby Changeling  begins to die it is up to the TWO of them to save it... great episode!",966729600,8,726,4.446969696969697
