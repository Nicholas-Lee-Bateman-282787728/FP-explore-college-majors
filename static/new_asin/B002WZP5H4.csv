8383478,3,B002WZP5H4,"I had seen this movie several times before, but as I don't speak Spanish, I could only ever pick out a few words and phrases. Still, I enjoyed the campy fun of seeing these three legendary luchadores bashing the undead.

However, once I watched this subtitled version, I sadly realized THIS MOVIE MAKES NO SENSE! There are references to scenes and events we never see happen, bizarre unexplained encounters, and just general incontinuity! Being unable to understand the dialogue, I had just ASSUMED there was some logical flow of events... but there really isn't!

Now, to be fair,  there does seem to be a slight discrepancy in the running time of different versions I've seen, so maybe there are scenes missing from this transfer... but the print appears to be in fairly good shape.

There's still plenty crazy lucha action, and Mil Mascaras looks pretty swanky in his tailored leisure suits, but if you're looking for narrative... keep walking!",1367539200,,947,4.937106918238993
8383479,1,B002WZP5H4,The dvd itself is fine but the movie is pure garbage. The fight scenes are lame and there are no really sexy women. The mummies do look creepy but that's about it. Don't waste your time with this movie.,1355011200,,202,4.205128205128205
8383480,5,B002WZP5H4,"Despues de buscar sin exito esta pelicula del Santo en Amazon por mucho tiempo (ya que hasta hace poco esta disponible aqui) la encontre por casualidad en un viaje a Mexico (precisamente en la ciudad de Guanajuato) hace varios anos. Es una pelicula que debe estar en una coleccion del Santo que se precie de serlo. No es su mejor pelicula, pero si de las mas famosas. Es una de las dos peliculas en las que el Santo aparece con Blue Demon y Mil Mascaras, pero es curioso como se ve en la pantalla la rivalidad profesional que Blue Demon sentia por el Santo cuando duda en llamarlo para que venga a ayudarle a liquidar a las momias que aterrorizaban Guanajuato, al grado que el Santo paracece casi al final de la pelicula, cuando faltan como 15 minutos para que se acabe. A pesar de que Blue Demon (y Mil Mascaras) estan en la pelicula por mas tiempo, es el Santo quien se lleva el credito y de paso el titulo. Originalmente se le habia llamado solo Las Momias de Guanajuato, pero despues se le agrego Santo contra Las Momias de Guanajuato. Si, la musica de organo es repetitiva y hay un numero musical en un cabaret que dura mas de lo que debiera, pero de cualquier manera, esta es una pelicula indispensable para el coleccionista.",1336176000,,1231,4.451327433628318
8383481,3,B002WZP5H4,"I have to admit I'm finding this movie a bit difficult to rate.  I went into it only having heard and read that many consider it to be the best luche libre movie ever made.  I'm not sure where THAT misleading notion came from, though everyone is entitled to their opinion.  It's the first of only two on-screen meetings of Mexico's Big Three masked luchadores - El Santo, Blue Demon, and Mil Mascaras (though El Santo doesn't join the fray until the last 15 or so minutes, save for an earlier ""flashback"" wrestling sequence, in which he's actually supposed to be his own ancestor).  Perhaps I was expecting too much, but the story is pretty uninspired, and seems to amble across the screen in a rather lazy manner - much like the dinky, ill-suited organ music soundtrack accompanying the opening and closing credits.  It just doesn't seem to generate a great deal of excitement, sometimes shuffling along at the pace of, well - a centuries old mummy.

The camaraderie between Blue Demon and Mil Mascaras is good, though it does seem better developed in their Champions of Justice movies.  And Blue Demon certainly doesn't hide his reluctance to call on Santo for help.  When the Big Three eventually do all get together for the climactic battle with the mummies of the film's title, the movie finally catches fire, so to speak.  Unfortunately it ends all too quickly.  The DVD comes in at a scant 80 minute running time, even though the product description says 95 minutes.  IMDB says 85 minutes.  Is this DVD an edited version, perhaps?

The full frame picture quality is pretty good, and the English subtitles are very easy to read.  I do have to hand it to these companies who release these DVDs with non-Spanish speaking viewers in mind.  I have several of these masked luchadore movies that are neither dubbed (which I generally dislike) nor subtitled.  And while it doesn't take a huge amount of brain power to halfways follow the plot on most of these type movies, English subtitles are always appreciated, and sometimes turn out to be pretty darn funny translations.

Would I recommend this movie?  Of course!!  The first of only two team-ups involving the Big Three?  That's a no-brainer!  And I don't mean to imply that I don't like this movie.  I find it a ""comfortable"" film to watch.  I can put it on for a Sunday afternoon viewing, kick back, and the opening organ music will almost put me to sleep.  Thankfully, the movie itself is a bit more exciting than the music.  But for the life of me, I still can't quite figure out where it gets lts highly regarded reputation.  I really would love to give this film four stars, but I just can't.  Three and a half stars maybe, but not four.  Had Santo been in it more than just the last fifteen minutes, I may have rated it a bit higher as well.  But as another reviewer of Mystery in Bermuda, the second and last team-up of the Big Three, put it - when a rare DVD with Santo, Blue Demon, and Mil Mascaras is made, you buy it!

One more thing.  I love the way this movie ends, lazy organ music notwithstanding.  Victorious, Santo and his manager in his gold (not silver?) MGA, Blue Demon and his son in his green (not blue?) MGA, and Mil Mascaras, with his best gal by his side, in his green dune buggy, all drive off together, presumably to go eat and par-tay...  A reassuring ending to a mildly entertaining movie that leaves you feeling that, once again, all is well with the world.",1331251200,8,3443,4.546341463414634
