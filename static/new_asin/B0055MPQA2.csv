8458472,4,B0055MPQA2,I wanted to get the behinds the scenes look at JKS and this DVD set shows that. But I did find it to be a bit repetitive. He's an amazingly hard worker and this gives a taste of what goes into supporting his fans and growing his entertainment empire.,1390176000,,250,4.122448979591836
8458473,4,B0055MPQA2,"I bought this dvd after seeing Jang Keun Suk singing on You Tube. I love his voice! He is a wonderful singer and also a wonderful actor. These 4 dvds shows Jang Keun Suk everyday tour life, how he prepare for a show, what he does to relax and have fun (seem like he love to swim). It also shows many interviews, fans meeting, and singing during his tour in Asia. Although I like his interviews and interaction with his fans because he is so funny and has a very charismatic personality, I had to rate this dvd 4 stars because there wasn't enough singing for me. But I still recommend this dvd to everybody who like Korean music because he is a good singer and it was fun to watch his every life when he's on tour.",1357948800,,713,4.173913043478261
