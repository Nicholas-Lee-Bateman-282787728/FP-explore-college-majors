613483,5,6303270905,This movie is a load of fun to watch.  It's campy and crazy and you have to watch it several time to pick up on all the nutty humor.  I loved it!,1036886400,5,145,3.5
613484,5,6303270905,This is the FUNNIEST movie of all time! Hilarious! Kinda like Loaded Weapon and Airplane but in ten time better!,1011139200,4,112,4.65
613485,5,6303270905,"silence of the hams is the best movie ever created. Half of the movie makes no sence, but it makes no sence in a way that is positively hillarious! I love the part with the waffle!!!",1006905600,2,182,4.083333333333333
7842264,5,6303270905,"This movie is a masterpiece that everyone needs to see. If you love screwball type goofy movies, you'll likely enjoy this.",1482451200,,122,4.857142857142857
7842265,5,6303270905,"This movie made me laugh so hard I almost had a stroke. Yeah, I know, it's stupid humor, but it's still funny.",1405382400,,110,4.045454545454546

7842267,5,6303270905,I saw this movie years ago and thought how stupid it was then I saw it again and thought I should have it to show others how damn crazy stupid funny it is!,1365292800,,155,3.727272727272727
7842268,5,6303270905,Sorry to see this is still not on DVD. This movie is a hoot and had me in stitches. Jam packed with idiot humor. And the actors in this movie pull it off so nicely. Seems like the good ones like this never seem to get transferred over to a DVD format. We'll be driving hovercraft first before you'll see this on DVD. Sad isn't it?,1321574400,,330,4.015151515151516
7842269,5,6303270905,"Well, I have to disagree with the self-proclaimed ""truth seeker"". ""truth seeker"" clearly has no appreciation for spoofs in general. This movie is very entertaining. To enjoy a good spoof, you have to appreciate the movies that helped create it. In any case, the Silence of the Hams is a very funny experience. Using some of the greatest movies like Silence of the Lams and Psycho, this is just wonderful film work. Much worth the price of this hard-to-find video.",1200096000,,463,4.8
7842270,4,6303270905,"I love this movie that goofs on Silence of the lambs, Phycho, Addamms Family so many more.

Many fammiluer faces like that guy who played Captain Chaos. The guy who wore purple pajamas in The Phantom. That guy who wrote Blazing Saddles. The dudett from this movie. The guy who played the father in Adamms fammily. Hightower from Police Acadamy, and Proctor. many, many more household names.

And now, for my silent review of the film.......

  . thank you",1108166400,5,455,4.708860759493671
7842271,5,6303270905,"So you love Leslie Neilson, and you can't get enough of the movie Airplane or mafia.  Here's your next step.  This movies kicks out the physical comedy like Steve Martin drunk on New Years Eve.  A must watch for stupid spoof movie fans.",1103673600,8,236,4.441860465116279
7842272,2,6303270905,"I'm sorry, but the last review was hilarious.  i hope it wasn't serious.  this is obviously not ""The Silence od the Lambs""  this is just a horror movie spoof with very cheap and bad jokes.  The reason i gave it 2 stars is because it's a horror movie spoof that came before ""Scary Movie""",1067212800,3,286,4.2407407407407405
