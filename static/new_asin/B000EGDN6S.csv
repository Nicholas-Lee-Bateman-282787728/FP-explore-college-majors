2518177,5,B000EGDN6S,"I just got this DVD and I love it!  Being new to ""stepping"" I mistakenly tried The Firm's DVD and thought my legs would fall off!  Kari balances taking her time yet keeps things moving along a great clip so that you are energized, exciting and most importantly buring fat!  At the end I was pleasantly tired...not exhausted...just feeling wonderfully tired, like I had really worked out.  With Kari I finally learned how to step and now I am stepping my way to a healthy body!  Thanks Kari! My advice...buy it...buy it...buy it!",1186012800,2,528,4.634408602150538
2518178,4,B000EGDN6S,"Kari Anderson's ""Go: Step Workout For Beginners"" is an excellent workout but it is absolutely more advanced than a workout for beginners.  If one is foreign to the step workout routine, this dvd should be previewed a couple times in advance before attempting the workout.  Also, one flaw I noted is there are no instructions on proper workout form and proper foot placement on the step. I am familiar with step so this was not a problem for me, however for someone unfamiliar with a step workout injury can occur if one does not place the whole foot on the step or maintain form.
The workout is divided into a five minute warm up, two workout sections, and a cool down.  Kari calls the first workout a ""starter workout"" which is 30-minutes long.  It is fast-paced and contains many step combinations.  Kari suggests doing only the starter workout when starting to familiarize oneself with the routine or use it on days when an easier workout is desired.  The second workout is an additional 15-minute calorie-burning workout that, as Kari puts it, ""is just slightly more challenging"".  The dvd is divided into chapters so the user can easily jump from the end of the first workout right to the cool-down.
The workouts are very fast-paced and will make you sweat.  However, they contain many advanced step combinations in fast sequence which can trip up a beginner.  For example: at one point Kari says ""We're going to try `curl, corner-to-corner' then immediately goes into the combination without showing an example.  Also, Kari often neglects to give instruction as to which foot is the ""lead"" foot on a combination.  Previewing the dvd helped familiarize me with the routine so it I wasn't caught off guard as much during the workout.
I do like Kari's as an instructor.  She is very encouraging, energetic, and has a pleasant speaking voice.
I recommend this dvd for anyone who is already familiar with the step and also knows the proper form and foot placement.
I do not recommend this workout for anyone who is totally new to the step. (Hence four stars instead of five).  For the true beginner I would recommend using Gin Miller's ""Everybody Steps: A Guide For New Exercisers"" until familiarizing oneself with the basics then use Kari Anderson's ""Go Step"" as an advanced-beginner routine when ready to kick it up a notch.",1171411200,51,2327,4.802005012531328
2518179,5,B000EGDN6S,"This workout is formatted pretty simplistically. A 5-minute warmup that goes right into the first 15-minute workout, which is then followed by another 15-minute workout and then a cool down.

I persisted through the whole 45-minutes and found that it was exactly what I needed. At right about the time that I started to become tired and feel a cramp in my side, the instructor began the cool down, which was perfect timing for me. While it's true that this workout could frustrate a true step beginner, with some practice it isn't nearly as difficult to learn as one might initially think. I watched the video the first time, then decided to try it and screwed up and got confused a lot thoughout. A couple of days later I did the workout again and only got a little flustered during the second workout. But by the third time I pretty much had it down. I can now appreciate the fact that it wasn't too easy to learn, or else the workout itself might not be as effective or challenging as it is. My heart-rate stayed up the whole time in spite of the fact this this is low-impact and dubbed ""for beginners."" I certainly can't think of any low-impact floor aerobic workouts that elevate my heart rate and actually cause me to break a sweat. But this step workout most definitely did!

Kari Anderson is a great instructor, and once you memorize which of her queues are associated with what moves, it's pretty easy to follow along. Her personality is fun and outgoing, but not over-the-top, and I enjoyed the accompanying, mostly techno/electronic music throughout, which suited the moves just perfectly. Kari is accompanied by several other steppers - including one modifier who does many of the moves on the floor - set against a dark blue backdrop.

Although ""Go: Step for Beginners"" is titled as such, this workout will certainly keep even an intermediate exerciser feeling challenged throughout. Highly recommended!",1168387200,20,1916,4.782477341389728
2518180,3,B000EGDN6S,"I bought this recently and have done the routine about 3 times. I think it is a great ""workout"", however it is not for true step beginners.  I find the step combos to be a little complex for the small amount of time she explains/shows them.

I didn't find her to be that relatable, but I did like that she used her actual  students in the video.

I would have given this a 4 if it were better titled, or offered an actual beginner work out.

I think this is a good choice for advanced beginners.",1168300800,15,495,4.114583333333333
2518181,5,B000EGDN6S,"This is only the second workout I have tried by Kari Anderson, who is known for more complex and dancy choreography.  She has come up with a great step workout for beginners and intermediates.  I would consider myself a solid intermediate in step who simply prefers easier choreography, doesn't want to have to think too hard and just wants to step and burn fat.  While the choreography is simple, I wouldn't call it super basic, therefore it is enough to keep beginners/intermediate steppers interested and not bored once their fitness levels increase.  Kari is joined by 6 of her students, 2 of them on the right side of the room show easier modifications, whether it be performing some moves on the floor or leaving some of the trickier moves out.

There are 4 segments to the workout, a 5 minute warmup performed mostly on the floor but the step is utilized a little bit.  Then you move into the first segment which is 15 minutes, some of the moves you will see here are corner to corner kicks and knee lifts, basic steps, walking around the step, repeaters, hamstring curls, straddles, side leg lifts and stomps.

Segment 2 is also 15 minutes long and slightly more complex, but still easy to pick up.  Here you will see more basic steps, alternating knees, T squats w/side leg lifts, V steps, around the world, mambos, corner knees, inner thigh lifts, front back front repeaters, turn steps, turn shuffles, over the tops and rocking horses.  Then it's on to the 10 minute cooldown and stretch again which uses the step a little bit.

Kari does a great job choreographing these routines, they are simple and easy to follow thanks to her great cueing.  The music selected is very good and fits the workout well.  Kari is an excellent instructor, she is encouraging, offers options to increase or decrease the intensity and is good about interacting with her students to make the workout fun for them too.  I get the impression that her live classes are a lot of fun, she seems like a very caring and personable individual.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for step workouts with simpler choreography.  While it's labeled for beginners and it is fairly simple I still get a great workout from it. Great effort from Kari.",1157846400,115,2232,4.687179487179487
2518192,5,B000EGDN6S,"What I liked best about this workout is the instructor takes time giving you the steps and repeating them. It's fun and lively without being too much right off. I bought this for winter aerobics, those times of year when I can't get out and run or bike. It's perfect and fun on a winter day. I picked up the steps right away and once I knew them I could turn the sound off and play whatever music I liked. I am a ""senior"" citizen, in years, and would recommend this for active seniors, these steps can also be done of the floor so if you're unsteady or a bit slower to learn the steps you can still have a great time. And get a good workout any time of year.",1365811200,3,658,4.030534351145038
2518193,2,B000EGDN6S,Average. For someone who has never done step it moves very very quickly. Also found it confusing when the instructor didn't say they were heading left or right as because you are watching it on TV it is all back to front so can be tricky and easy to get out of sync.,1357344000,,266,4.037735849056604
2518194,5,B000EGDN6S,Nice straight forward workout. I use it when I need to do something of a workout but don't want to kill myself. You can bump up the intensity on your own. She is delightful!,1357171200,,173,4.117647058823529
2518195,5,B000EGDN6S,"This is my first time seriously participating in step. I did some step aerobic in high school PE, but that was 5 years ago and kind of ""just for fun"" to change up the old run-around the track or gym routine. That being said, I found the pace a little too fast at first. But like what others may have said, Kari provides cues at just the right time. If I ever lost the cadence I can get back without a problem. It took a while to get the sequences down, but I had fun doing it... definitely beats the death(tread)mill and got my heart pumping within the first few minutes. As a beginner, this dvd definitely provides a challenge for me. And it's something to ""grow"" into. I probably won't get bored for awhile with this. If you are looking for something slow paced, this dvd may not be for you. I do recommend it for those looking for a fun heart pumping exercise routine.",1339200000,,871,4.253012048192771
2518196,4,B000EGDN6S,"I say old fashioned because there are so many new workout routines that are just beyond my physical abilities -- filled with lots of dance steps, bouncing and jumping. I'm not in a position to add any more bounce to my already bouncy body. So I was looking for a basic step routine that would get my heart rate up but be 'easy' enough to keep me going and not give me a reason to walk away due to difficulty.

I like this routine. It is standard in that Kari teaches a step and builds on the routine each time. She gives easy directions and all of the steps are enough to get your heart rate up but not so difficult to discourage the average beginner. There is a warm-up and then 20 minute beginning routine. If you want to go further, there is an additional 15 minutes you can continue with to make your total workout 45 minutes.

If you are like me and looking for the old style of up-down, step-kick, over and back kind of routine, this is the one.",1332201600,5,951,4.191256830601093
2518197,5,B000EGDN6S,I had purchased many different step DVDs and they were too hard to follow.  This one is for beginners and is easy to follow.  At the same time you get a great workout in.  I have been doing this one for a while and purchased her other step videos as well.  She explains every move in advance.  I love it.,1326412800,,304,4.0
2518198,4,B000EGDN6S,"I could not believe how hard it was to find a good step workout on DVD.  I loved step aerobics back in the day and wanted to get back into these type of workouts.  I had an extensive collection of exercise VHS tapes and have been trying to find DVD workouts to replace some of my favorites.  Unfortunately, I cannot find exact replicas of my faves, but this one is a good start.  It's a good workout for those who are old enough to have been around when step workouts first became popular and will be a staple in my new workout collection.",1324944000,,539,4.203883495145631
2518199,5,B000EGDN6S,This was a great workout to start my post-partum recovery.  The moves can be relatively tricky if you have never done step before but keep with it and they will come. What's the point in working out if you aren't challenged!,1321488000,,224,4.463414634146342
2518200,5,B000EGDN6S,I am having fun while burning calories.  Kari is easy to understand and gives you options of a hard work-out or an easier one.  I'm very happy with this purchase.,1309996800,,162,4.366666666666666
2518201,2,B000EGDN6S,"I purchased this dvd because it said it was for beginners. I used to do a step workout daily, about 15 years ago and loved it. I wanted to start doing my step workout again, so I thought I would try this dvd. When I actually tried the workout, the moves were not for beginners. They show one person who is doing the workout that is not on the step, but doing the workout on the floor. What a waste to time! I was very disappointed! I thought the moves would be easier since it said it was for beginners. Try checking this one out at your local library before you buy this one, I wish I did.",1308528000,2,590,4.008474576271187

2518213,5,B000EGDN6S,"I am really glad I picked this step dvd after being away from step for awhile.  It is easy enough to catch on, yet also provides a really great workout.

I am new to stepping, but not new to dance/workout videos. It wasn't what I would have classified as beginner, but maybe intermediate or advanced beginner.

The first part is great, simple but gets you going even for an intermediate level.  Don't like the 2nd part where the moves are a little more complicated and dancelike.  As someone else mentioned, the first workout doesn't get boring as there is enough variety to keep you going.  She does a very good job at instruction.",1278201600,,486,4.426966292134831
2518216,5,B000EGDN6S,Just starting out this is a great beginner workout.  Also the outfits are not out of the 70's.  So the people are not horrid to watch.,1270944000,,134,4.115384615384615
2518217,4,B000EGDN6S,"Some think it's not a beginner's workout. Actually, the moves are easy to learn and beginner's level. The difficulty I can see people having is that the trainer keeps switching to the next thing so fast, and often it seems without warning. If you can handle that, this is actually a good and simple workout; the constant changes keep it interesting for some people. If you get lost, which every single one of us that tried it did, just flail along. She even says as much right at the beginning of it. I don't recommend this for a perfectionist who wants to follow along perfectly though.",1269475200,2,587,4.547169811320755
2518218,5,B000EGDN6S,"I was looking for a step workout that was -only- step aerobics. No interval training, no abs workout, no yoga, etc. I already have those kinds of workouts, and I wanted something that was aerobics only, to use on alternate days when I'm not doing strength training, or as an alternative to walking.

This DVD was just right for the job. It's low-impact, the choreography isn't too difficult, it isn't ""dancy"", but it does the job in getting my heart rate up.

The separate 15-minute sections allow you to customize the workout a bit - do one or both of the segments, or repeat a segment if you want.

My only minor quibble is that the cueing could have been a little better in a few places (mostly in the second workout section), though overall it's fine, and once you've done it a while, it doesn't really matter.",1268092800,,814,4.486486486486487
2518219,4,B000EGDN6S,"Worth investing in! I am a avid step areobics fan. I haven't done step for at least 10 years maybe more. I have done this DVD in the last few days. It is a good refresher, I was extremely tired and sore when we got done. I sweated like crazy but felt I had a great workout. I also felt for someone who hasn't done step in a very long time this is great to get back up to speed. I was not able to keep up with all the moves because of being so green. I am also out of shape and alot older than I was when I uesd to do step at the gym 3 - 4 times a week. I will continue to use this DVD and hopefully get much more comfortable with the program.",1263772800,,642,3.6258992805755397
2518220,1,B000EGDN6S,"The title is misleading.

The DVD is 5 minutes of warm up, and 2 fifteen minute work outs, one of which is 'moderate' and the other is more 'intense', and a cool down.

For a BEGINNER, it should be 5 minute warm up, 40 minutes of 'moderate' and then a cool down.

She should have made 2 one hour routines, one for BEGINNERS and one for people that can do a more intense work out.

I'm 60 years old, am in reasonable shape (and probably better shape than most 60 year olds,) work out at the gym, when I have time, for an hour a day.

Kari does not do endless repetitions of the same exact move, which I like.  I do not like to do more than 4 of any move in a row.  The music is good and Kari is cheerful, and encouraging without being obnoxiously chipper.

While the choreography is simple, you might have difficulty if you've never done step before.

What i found is that the only ""bad"" review i read, was accurate.  If you have not been working out prior to this video and in good cardio condition, you will find this cd to be too challenging.

The tempo is quite fast for beginners, the moves are not all that simple either.  She gives bad cueing, and no examples before she just switches moves.  I don't know of any other video that she has created, but this one is not for beginners, and it seems that she forgot that true beginners are not in shape.",1255824000,5,676,4.209302325581396

I didn't realize that only the first 10-15 minutes was for beginners!  The rest is for intermediate and I almost killed myself trying to do the workout.  The second half... which is the most difficult to keep up with, she is horrible at cueing the moves so in order to do the workout you just have to learn the moves.  If you try to keep up with her while learning the moves you could hurt yourself, (I fell twice and twisted my ankle once).  I've been doing the workout for over two months now in rotation with three other dvd's (two cardio and one other step).  The music is not very motivating and sometimes sounds like weird african drums. Kari's voice is very monotone which becomes very irritating.  If the steps weren't so challenging then I would have fallen asleep.  You will sweat with this workout, but there is nothing fun about it and I only do it because I haven't bought a new step dvd yet.

If you are a beginner/intermediate stepper who does not like a lot of dancing coreography, you will like this.  if you want lots of fancy moves - this is not for oyu.  I am a step instructor and I bought the DVD to give me some ideas for my Step classes.  I could take her coreography blocks and use them to build into my existing class for some variety.

2518253,4,B000EGDN6S,"I like this step video.  I don't love it.

Kari Anderson is an EXTREMELY energetic person.  She frequently adds additional spirited moves into her exercises just... ...because.  This can have a polar effect on you - either you're in the mood to really push it a notch and match Kari's efforts, or you've had a rough day and feel like telling her to kiss your rump!

Kari's DVD is divided into a Warm-up session of five minutes, a general workout of 15 minutes, a secondary, more challenging work out of 15 minutes, and a 10-minute cooldown.  The warm-up is effective and comfortable.  The first workout is a little boring and repetitive.  You basically do a few exercises over and over again, while throwing in some of Kari's energetic moves.  The second workout is FAR more challenging - so much so I've only attempted it once so far!  The cooldown is one of the most frustrating parts in my opinion - using a very ricky rock-step that always seems to trip me up at a time that I'm already pretty winded.  But her stretches are very thorough and I definitely feel an improvement in the past two months of using this DVD.

Lastly, Kari is a playful person surrounded by other playful participants.  I think some of her jokes and quips and replies from the other participants ""cheese"" down the video and seem to add a level of unprofessionalism.  Some people however may enjoy the relaxed atmosphere this creates.  I however prefer a more neutral environment - I don't like people trying to make me laugh when I'm covered in sweat.

I still give the video four stars because it's definitely effective.  I started with a Cathe video that reacclimated me to STEP exercise, and by following other reviews for this video, used it as my next level.  I can't really refer to this as a beginner's video, though she does still try to explain some of the basics.  Unfortunately, she explains them after you're already doing them.  You'll have to go through the DVD a few times before it becomes comfortable.  I don't think that I'll rely on Kari very long before upgrading to yet another more challenging video - it just tends to irritate me more than I'd prefer.

I think women will enjoy this video because it will make them comfortable.  Even I appreciate the fact that one of her backup ""Steppers"" is a man (though rather dorky looking) and I think some women would also be glad to see a rather heavyset woman exercising on the far right.  It's a good contrast to videos employing nothing but scantily-clad models.

As a man, the only real perspective I can add is that, if Kari Anderson has a husband, he's a very, VERY lucky man.  I just hope he has a good chiropracter...",1218931200,,2668,4.575949367088608
2518254,4,B000EGDN6S,"I would agree with the other reviewers that said this is not as beginner-oriented a workout as implied, primarily because of the lower leg flipping choreography in the second half.  It has less complicated and easier to learn stepping routines than other videos of Kari Anderson's, but it's not as basic as say, many of Kathy Smith's or Denise Austin's basic routines. I consider myself intermediate as a stepper and I really like this video. It seems laid back compared to Kari's usual complicated routines, but I often think about issues on my mind while exercising to well-known favorites, and this is becoming one.",1216166400,,618,4.9423076923076925
2518255,5,B000EGDN6S,"I am an avid fan of step aerobics, so I may be a little bit biased--but I love this workout! I get a good sweat after 15 min but usually keep on going thanks to Kari's motivating and fun attitude!  I don't have all the moves 'down' yet--it will take time and I figured that before purchasing--all new things take time!",1212451200,,318,4.213114754098361
2518256,5,B000EGDN6S,"I really enjoy this workout - yes, I actually enjoy it!  I had tried step classes at my local gym, but was completely unprepared for the quick and difficult choreography.  Not a problem here!

The steps are easy to learn and Kari is personable and fun.  It took me a few weeks to make it all the way through the workout - but now I do it once a week.  She has a few women and one man in the background.  One of the women is overweight - she often does the lower-impact versions of the moves, which I also did at the beginning.  It was very reassuring to see an overweight woman in an exercise video - it kept my motivated like, ""if she can do this, so can I.""

I recommend this one for any one new to step or for anyone who just doesn't like complicated choreography - I for one, find comfort in repetition.",1211155200,,807,4.063291139240507
2518257,5,B000EGDN6S,"I love this workout.  As a beginner, this was easy to follow and not master by any means.  Every time  go through this workout, I get more fluid.  I also really like how she instructs.  She is clear, kind, and keeps a humane pace.",1207785600,,230,4.136363636363637
2518258,5,B000EGDN6S,"Okay, I took step aerobics for 1 semester at my school and I fell in love! So, I (thinking that I was an advanced beginner) bought (sp?) this dvd to go along with my new rebok step! Of course I looked into it first and all the reviews said that it was a masterpiece! I agree.

I put my adjustable step on the medium level instead of the first. I've used this dvd about 6 times now, and today I finally got to the end! It is a difficult workout! The coreography is way basic. Kari is lovely! She is also a dancer which means that (towards the end) there is a mix of dancy moves and basic moves, but they are all workout moves. They all do something for ya!

The dvd is in this format:
5 minute warm up (good warm up there is only one move that I refuse to do because I feel it does nothing for me)
15 minute beginning workout (It tricked me! I was going about it thinking that it was too easy, but then the moves became more advanced yet still fun!)
15 minute intermediate workout (Kicked my butt! As I've said before, today is the first day that I could actually make it to the end!)
5 minute cool down and stretch. (I liked the cool down. The stretch I couldn't possibly care less for. It's probably because of my pilates bias. I only do",1202169600,4,1238,4.069672131147541
2518259,5,B000EGDN6S,"I'm an intermediate who prefers basic choreography. The choreography in Go is the most basic of any I have tried. Even the workout that came with my step was more complex than this one. I really would recommend this to the true beginner, but as an intermediate I still enjoyed it and got a good workout. Kari Anderson tends not to cue which leg leads, and this workout is no exception. However, these routines are so simple that it's not really a problem. She does a move on the right leg first, then does the same move on the left. It's not hard to figure out. Any reviewer who thinks this choreography is too complicated for a true beginner, I wonder if they have done any other step workouts. I don't think you'll get any simpler than this, unless all you want to do is basic stepping up and down. If you want to learn moves that you will use in future workouts, like ""around the world"" or ""corner to corner,"" I would recommend this video for some good instruction.

What's good about this workout for the beginner is:
1. The combos aren't long, there aren't a lot of different moves to remember at the same time.
2. Once you do a combo you ""throw it away"" so you don't have to remember it for later.
3. She has you do a basic step or march while she previews harder moves, so you get to see it and hear the explaination before you attempt the move.
4. Different modifications are shown so you can make the moves more intense as you get better at stepping.
5. The camera stays in place, either straight on Kari or gives a shot from in front and a little above. The angle shot is great because you can see the entire cast, and you can see the entire top of all their steps, to fully see what they are doing.
6. There's a lot of repetition of each move.",1201996800,6,1754,4.235820895522388
2518260,5,B000EGDN6S,"I bought this dvd not too long ago, and I'm someone who has been stepping for about 12 years.  This was a good workout for both beginners and more advanced steppers(on a higher step level).  The instructor is very likable, and she gives really good cues to the next step routine.  It was not hard to learn, and it gave me a pretty good workout.  The moves are not complicated or too ""dancy"" which is what I like.  I liked it so much, I bought another step workout from this instructor.",1201651200,,485,4.285714285714286
2518261,4,B000EGDN6S,"On the whole, I agree with the other reviewers that this is a great basic step workout, not overly complicated, but you still work up a sweat.  Also, it's pretty laid back, which is a plus as far as I'm concerned, because I am so not into perky people telling me to lift my leg higher, etc.

But there is one issue with the DVD and another with the cooldown that are worth mentioning.  The workout is (supposedly) structured so that you can do the 5 minute warmup, then a 15 minute workout, then the 10 minute cooldown, OR you can make it longer by adding the other 15 minute segment in the middle.  If you're just starting, just the first 15 minute segment is arguably plenty.  But the disk does not STOP... you have to stop it and then go to the cooldown segment, which would be ok too, except that the part that is supposedly the cooldown doesn't start there; it begins in the middle of a complicated (for those of us who are kind of choreography-impaired) step bit that goes on for quite a while.  If I'd wanted to fast forward, I would have bought a tape!  I mean, this is not a long DVD.  Would it have killed them to just put the workout on twice, cued to run through properly both ways?

My other note is a caution for the old and fat (like me!).  While this is really a good workout, the cooldown is hard if you're not very flexible.  It's FAR easier to skip sitting on the step, as Kari and company do, and just sit on the floor.  I can do all the stretches that way, but trying to balance on the step while draping myself over it with one foot back is, well, pretty much impossible.  Also silly-looking, but that doesn't matter!",1198108800,,1639,4.231511254019293

Kari provides very clear, helpful instruction, breaks down more complicated moves in a way that's easy to follow, and has a couple of people showing modifications (although the moves are straightforward enough that you might not need them as a reference).

8109388,3,B000EGDN6S,"Kari is great & the complexity & strenuousness are right up my alley (i.e. not very complex & moderately strenuous). Unfortunately, there are some big flaws:

1. The legs aren't worked evenly.
Since it's for beginners, basic step is used a lot for transitions. Unfortunately, she only does the basic step with the right leg leading. Seriously. (No, she never taps back to alternate the legs.)
Most (if not all) of the routines are also performed more times with one leg than the other.
(For me, neither of these are deal-breakers b/c it's pretty easy to make adjustments to even it up.)

2. Instructions are for a beginner in the first 2/3 of the video, and for a long time student in the last 1/3 .
Initially, she introduces new steps & complexity slowly, with plenty of verbal instructions & with a chance to watch the new steps before performing them. Then one has plenty of time to get comfortable doing the new steps before she adds on.
During the last workout segment & the cool-down, she uses more complex choreography & faster music. These changes are still beginner-appropriate, BUT the level of instruction is not. She reduces the amount of instruction & eliminates the opportunity to watch before doing. To make matters worse, she keeps adding new steps/complexity without allowing time to master the last new move. During this section she also forgets to say the next move sometimes. This segment feels like she's teaching a class full of long-time students, not a person new to her class & possibly new to step. Being fairly uncoordinated, I find this section frustrating, even after doing the workout multiple times. (Oh Kari, why did you spoil a great thing?)",1393545600,,1674,4.809027777777778
8109389,4,B000EGDN6S,"This is my go-to for days I don't feel like pushing it too much. I like Kari a lot and her group really endorses her in a post workout segment.
