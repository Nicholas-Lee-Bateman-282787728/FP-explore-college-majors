Arguably, ""The Wandering Swordsman"" is the weakest of the four; this may be due to the ""Peter Pan"" nature of David Chiang's part.

8230172,1,B000XXWE1W,"The movie Water Margin will most likelyalready have a hairline acrack whenypu receive itand will be evident upon removal. A number of reviewers have blamed themselves for this happening when removing the disc but it is always the same disc of the four packaged. I encountered every conceivable disc packaging arrangement and while this arrangement is poor and is challenging it is not the most difficult I have encountered. I took precaution and slowly and gently as possible removed the discs for inspection. It is obvious to me that the disc The Water Margin was cracked during the original packaging process and NOT by you, It was most likely jammed onto the spindle with excessive force  by what ever person or machine during the original packaging process. My Recommendation is for anyone TO AVOID THIS SET UNLESS YOU ALREADY OWN A COPY OF THE WATER MARGIN. You have been alerted to this and if you end up with a cracked copy it on you.!!",1452297600,2,943,4.75

8230174,1,B000XXWE1W,So disappointed.  Fight scenes are predictable and dull.  Nothing about these are action packed.,1445472000,,96,5.785714285714286

8230177,5,B000XXWE1W,the one thing i really love about this martial arts masterpiece it's in the original mandarin chinese format...just like watching japanese kaiju monster flicks in the original japanese format...it's broadens your horizons!!!,1422835200,,224,6.03125
8230178,3,B000XXWE1W,"The case on this collection is so poorly engineered that some discs are at risk of breaking every time you remove them, and others simply flop about.  So, I broke my disc of Water Margin.  I used to make fun of reviews like this, which were obviously written by people who don't know how to work DVD cases.  Then I became one of those poor suckers.  IT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU!! Anyway, nice job on the case, jerks.",1422230400,,409,4.205128205128205
8230179,4,B000XXWE1W,"super great, but why don't you let the customer know in advance if film has sub-titles as my order did. i would have paid without sub-titles if i  had known. OK.",1417219200,,161,4.193548387096774
