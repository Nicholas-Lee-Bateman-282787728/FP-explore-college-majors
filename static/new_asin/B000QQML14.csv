If you love National Lampoons movies then the Dorm Daze Trilogy is a must see for sure.",1399075200,,277,4.56
8277292,2,B000QQML14,"Van Wilder was one of those comedy movies that had some over the top humor that was crazy and often really childishly stupid, but that is what made it a great comedy classic.  Of course, the studio went back to the well to cash in on Van Wilder's cult following by makeing Van Wilder 2, The rise of Taj.  And getting Kal Penn back to revive the role of Taj gave them what they thought was a green light to bring Van Wilder back to the big screen.  But, they should have went strait to DVD because now they will never sell one after a few brave souls (like me) wasted my money to see this in theaters.  Just not funny, and the story line was thin, and what Happened to Taj's girl from the end of the last movie, and this is just a hint at the problems.

The story, if you haven't figured it out, is based around Taj, the secretary/understudy of Van. Well, I guess Taj graduated from Coolidge and is now going to Camford in England to get a Doctorate and work as a teaching assistant, following in his fathers footsteps.  Well, He doesn't make the ""fox and hounds"" fraternity, so he makes due with the characters he meets at the place he was sent to ""the Barn""  And, All of these people are ""loosers"", and Taj takes them on as his new Fraternity naming themselve ""[...]"".  Of course, in revenge of the nerd style, the [...] are taking on the Fox and Hounds (as well as other Fraternities) in a campus competition.  As we soon see, the gang of loosers are actually brilliant in their own ways (and the woman of the gang is smoking hot, does not fit the nerd role anyway). Taj, as van wilder did, falls in love with the woman that is dating their arch rivals.  And the ending is the same too, Taj gets the girl and the team wins.  They might as well have called this movie Revenge of the Nerds, because the overall story line was the same, with just a few similarities to Van Wilder.  The biggest change to this movie....ITS NOT FUNNY.  Save your money, rent this one when it comes out if you must see it, or sucker a friend to rent it for you. Best if you can share this agony with someone else.",1165104000,12,2092,4.2
