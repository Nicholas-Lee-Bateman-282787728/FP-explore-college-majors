8270335,4,B0018ODXVU,"What intially intrigued me was the absence of an ""artist/maker"" for the product collection. I was expecting perhaps a bootlegg copy or compilation of better known works.
What it's actually is a three DVD set (Historical Perspective; People & their Culture; Art & Archeology) with almost 10 hours of media covering any/all things Native American.
From 1950-1994 a vast variety of artists, activists, & government agencies set out to document the disappearing culture of Native America.
The whole collection has a ""Them/Their's"" feel to it...but perhaps that's appropriate considering the source/method...Insider interpretation/explanation for the outsider.
This eclectic collection of radio shows, narrated slide shows and short films cover a hodge-podge of topics, in no particular order or sequence.
This is a great addition for the consumate collector to fill out their Native American works collection.
No worries about overlap with any Ken Burns, PBS, or National Geographic presentations.
Most items should be new & unknown/seen to the viewer, unless perhaps a film from grade-school of the 60s-70's brings back memories.
Also know that all was originally done in analog format...so if you're viewing this on a 52"" Jumbo-Tron sit back, way back...might as well turn-off the surround-sound too.
I would not recommend this to a novice collector since there is no real defined storyline, structure or chronology. Akin to trying to learn about Christainity by randomly opening the Bible...could do more harm than good.
The price (~$5) was well-worth the cost & effort of finding, collecting, and recording all this data. The volume of material is really unbelieveable!!",1255478400,2,1670,5.476744186046512
