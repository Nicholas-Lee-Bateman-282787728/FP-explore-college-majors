5683121,3,B00BZILQL8,"Robot Chicken, like Saturday Night Live, Lipitor or Cymbalta, is not for everyone. But it's enjoyed significant success. This particular entry in the stop-motion Adult Swim satire series provides quite a notable twist in the ongoing saga of super powers engaged in battle -- not superheroes, but entertainment companies with growing portfolios of characters and franchises.

DC has had some bumps along the big-screen freeway to box office and critical success while Marvel is enjoying a measurable edge. However, Warner can spoof their characters to a searing degree. Disney probably would demur to do the same with its properties. It's ironic that Robot Chicken, which hit big with its Star Wars sendup (before Disney bought Lucasfilm), has allowed satire within its own library, from Space Ghost: Coast to Coast to Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law.

Some may take umbrage at how Warner can produce satires of this kind with their classic characters, but the point is in the irony. Robot Chicken is an unapologetically crude, edgy puppet show that is now a six-season series with over 100 episodes. Big name stars do voices and awards have been won. I'm not making an evaluation here, just observing and tilting my head to the side in wonderment.

Members of Robot Chicken's team are also behind Cartoon Network's animated MAD series, which follows the same rhythm, transitional devices and hit-and-miss satire, albeit for a younger audience. MAD does not come near the expletive level of Robot Chicken.

But it's not the use of language that makes this particular entry in the series funny, it's the silliness and the running gags. Aquaman's lack of respect is the show's ""through line,"" as the writers call it on their commentary. I got a kick out of the nod to Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In in the ""That's Bane"" gags. It's also nice to see Captain Carrot and His Zoo Crew mentioned - in a sketch reminiscent of the classic ""Chuckles Bites the Dust"" episode of the Mary Tyler Moore Show. And let's face it, Mister Banjo steals the show. He should have his own big-budget tentpole CG feature film.

Robot Chicken moves at such a breakneck pace that a lesser gag is forgotten when a greater one follows it, also a ""Laugh-In"" technique and a luxury that the longer format SNL does not have. Having this episode on DVD bears repeat viewings in order to catch the gags - and of course, the more you know the comics, the funnier the jokes. Although it's a half-hour special, there are a lot of bonus features.

As a special note, I have never read a funnier DVD box than the one in which this is packaged. Whoever wrote it deserves props, and those who shepherded it through what is likely a series of corporate approvals is also a superhero. It even has fake prices! I could just imagine someone saying, ""If we put a price of 12 cents on the front cover, the public may expect to pay that...""

BONUS FEATURES

1.  The Making of the RCDC Special
Even though specific words are bleeped on the special, they are heard here in voice sessions. Apparently the stop motion animation is all done domestically, at least from the way it looks in this segment.

2.  Writers' Commentary
Nice explanations of the concepts behind the gags and how the show is structured.

3.  Actors' Commentary
It's fun to hear Alfred Molina talk about the British comics he grew up with, as well as his take on doing this show. Guess who Banjo Man is?

5.  DC Entertainment: The Tour
Seth Green and other creatives tour the office lobby, research library, toy graveyard, things in storage, video game room, product room, archives and writers room.

PLUS:
6.  Aquaman: His DC Special Origin Story
7.  Chicken Nuggets (sketch-by-sketch commentary)
8.  Stoopid Alter Egos costume wrap party
9.  Outtakes
10.  Cut sketches: voice sessions and storyboards",1374105600,4,3817,4.82361963190184
5683122,3,B00BZILQL8,"So, it's 23 minutes (+2 hours bonus features) for ten bucks. Have to agree with those people who said that it would be nice if those ""bonus features"" included all of the previous DC Comics character segments from past seasons of Robot Chicken. As it is, the bonus features are two different audio commentaries, a ""pop-up"" fun-facts version of the special, a behind the scenes feature, and some deleted sketches (not actually filmed; audio with storyboards). So, it depends on how much of a hardcore Robot Chicken and/or DC fan you are whether this will be worth it to you. It's about the same as the RC Star Wars specials in terms of content, so be forewarned.

The one really odd thing I found (as a toy collector and DC fan) in watching this special was the odd mix of classic Mego-style action figures with the regular larger size ""DC Universe Classic"" (Mattel) figures and ""DC Direct"" action figures. I wish they had gone either all Mego-style or all modern-style, because mixing the two types together in one sketch gives the viewer a strange feeling of incongruity. Other than that, the material is pretty funny.",1373846400,3,1118,4.733333333333333
5683123,1,B00BZILQL8,"DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!  It's got very little new material, they re-use the Bane breaking Batman's back skit and then waste time with talking heads that are always boring and stupid!!

Robot Chicken is funny, but NOTHING'S worth this ripoff price!!  As soon as I saw Geoff Johns of DC Comics on there, I knew I had been had!  He/DC charged EIGHT DOLLARS for his last Green Lantern comic which was AS BIG A RIPOFF AND OVER-PRICED AS THIS!!!",1373500800,2,446,4.469135802469136
5683124,2,B00BZILQL8,"I feel ripped off. It is only 23 minutes long. I love DC comics and I love Robot Chicken, but most of the jokes were lame. I wish I could return it.",1373414400,3,148,3.65625
5683125,3,B00BZILQL8,"I love DC. I buy all the stuff they put out, so I had to check this out.

I was shocked to find the ""RC/DC Special"" is only 23 minutes long! I had assumed they were going to throw in all their old DC comics sketches, but NOPE... It's just the main 23 minute episode.

Sure, they got two commentaries (with the creators and with the actors) and lots of behind the scenes stuff... but it's still not worth it. If they had thrown in all the other DC jokes they had done before it would have been good, but they didn't.

I feel bad for spending $10 on the DVD, so speading $15 for the bluray is ridiculous. If you ever find it in the $5 bin of your local retailer, it's totally worth the $5, until then... I'd give this a pass.",1373414400,36,723,4.006944444444445
5683126,4,B00BZILQL8,"Robot Chicken's Season 6 premiere last September began with a DC Comics Special.  Written by Geoff Johns and regular RC writers, the Special was a fast and, in my opinion, sporadically funny comic spoofery of the Robot Chicken kind.  Meaning lots of jokes, of which many that hit and many that fall flat.

As an avid fan of Robot Chicken in general (and owner of every RC season), I was really looking forward to seeing DC Comics Chief Creative Officer and famous comic scribe take on the Robot Chicken 10-minute, rapid-fire skit format and for the most part he succeeded in providing lots of laughs.  The in-joke in Bane reappearing to 'break the Bat' in multiple Batman skits is priceless.  And so is Aquaman's early floundering (excuse the pun) with his fellow Justice League-ers and later...you'll find out!

In a manner of speaking, Robot Chicken's DC Comics Special is not as funny or memorable as any of the three Star Wars Specials they've aired in years previous (which were AMAZING).  Yet the veteran writing skills of Geoff Johns shines through and allows the viewer to get the in-jokes while laughing through most of the special.

The question on your mind just may be: Is Robot Chicken's DC Special worth forking over the cash for?  Well, that's up to how dedicated a Robot Chicken viewer you are.  If you are a dedicated viewer, then nothing's stopping you for purchasing the 9.99 DVD or 14.96 Blu-Ray. With either the DVD or Blu-Ray format to choose from, it's completely up to you to decide on which platform you prefer (or have).

If you're a casual Robot Chicken viewer, (which is absolutely okay) then I would recommend the purchase as well for the reason that 23 minutes of content, decent Robot Chicken content at that, and 2 hours of Special Features (on both DVD and Blu-Ray, legitimate proof from Entertainment Weekly: [...] that allows you to see their making-of featurette, outtakes, deleted sketches, and even a tour of DC Comics Entertainment from Geoff Johns!  On the DVD and Blu-ray extras front, Robot Chicken always delivers.

So, to wrap things up Robot Chicken DC Comics Special is a decent Robot Chicken spoof, in my opinion, of many of DC Comics most revered (and very much lesser revered) comic icons and the many in-jokes/comedy that can be mined from their characters' inconsistencies (over different comic book runs) and traits.  For some, once may be enough in terms of viewing the RC DC Comics Special.  For others, if this is you, it may be the first of many times!  Here's to the upcoming 2nd DC Comics Special delivering on the levels of greatness that the Star Wars Specials reached.
