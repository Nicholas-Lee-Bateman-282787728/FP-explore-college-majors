7878275,2,6304819714,"What happens when a hairdresser gets obsessed with a skinhead? The very notion of his work is mocked by a style that requires no hair. And what does the hairdresser want from him? Is it simple companionship, sexual intercourse or something else, something much more difficult to obtain? Bruce La Bruce relies heavily on images to tell a story that focuses mainly on undefined desire. Through constant narrative disruptions and a somehow erratic storytelling, the meaning of ""No Skin off my Ass"" becomes diffused and blurry. Perhaps, it's La Bruce's postmodernist approach to cinematography and thus a story devoid of meaning is appropriate for our times. Perhaps, as literary critic Roland Barthes would have demanded, meaning can only be found in the readers or spectators. Every one has to work with the elements presented in the film to build their own story, the meaning does not come from the creator but from the interpreter, from the viewer.

There are, however, certain themes that are exploited since the beginning. Fetishism is one of them. The obsession of the hairdresser towards skinheads comes from the clothes they wear and especially their boots. Footwear has always been one of the main fetishes in classic psychoanalytic theory. Freud, for example, used to say that all women desired the man's penis (he was no feminist, of course). A woman was somehow incomplete because of the lack of penis. Other authors have stated that foot fetishism starts at a very early age: A child, any child, is playing in the floor and raises his head to look at his mother, looking through the mother's skirt, he realizes she does not have a penis, and therefore she is incomplete. And the young boy suffers as he stumbles upon this discovery. And he suffers so much for it that he wishes to fill that void, to replace that lack of penis with something else, hence he looks down to the floor again and he stares at her mother's shoes, and unconsciously he turns those shoes into the penis, thus replacing the absence with something else. The shoes could be seen as a symbolic penis; Lacan, for example, would later re-elaborate the theory explaining that the high heel shoes function as the mother's phallus, a phallus which has been previously denied by the father.

It would be interesting, however, to contrast these definitions with homosexual desire. What are shoes for a gay man? Are they necessary the mother's lost phallus? There is a very erotic fixation on the skinhead boots, and as the film progresses we understand that fetishism can take many forms.

Another interesting character is the skinhead's sister. She plans to make a movie about women, much in the same way that Luce Irigaray envisions feminist literature in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speculum-of-the-Other-Woman/dp/0801493307/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speculum of the Other Woman</a>. It's all about bodies, whether the female body trying to attain a certain supremacy or independency, or the male body removing itself from the classic Lacanian masculine position.

Although the exploration of the body is very valuable, there are moments in which there is no pathos, moments that one as a spectator would deem necessary. The ending is not as subversive as the rest of the film, perhaps it's too conclusive in a story that should have been left open and free to be interpreted and reinterpreted by the viewers. The meaning of text, after all, as Barthes would have wanted, does not depend on the author but on the reader. And in Bruce La Bruce's production this task falls heavily on the spectator.",1320537600,,3622,5.113175675675675
7878276,1,6304819714,"The grainy black-and-white film has a sort of charming nostalgia value.
There's some great music (but isn't film essentially a visual medium!?)
There are some wry jokes.
But NONE of this can excuse or compensate for the lack of ideas or the long, long, looong stretches of tedium between the very occasional shining monment.",1235001600,,324,5.018518518518518
7878277,4,6304819714,"Two observations for people who don't 'get' this film...

First of all, the style: grainy B&W film with voice-over narration, was clearly done as an homage to earlier sex/art films, in particular the early Andy Warhol/Paul Morrissey films.  This film - 'No Skin' - was made in the late 80's or early 90's and clearly the director could have gone with sync-sound home video, IF, he was simply trying to make a low-budget film.

Secondly, this film is obviously much more enjoyable to anyone who would fantasize about sex with a skinhead young man.  If that's not your thing, then the sex in this film will probably be an overwhelming turn-off!  (Likewise, I have no interest in seeing Hostel or Saw II because I'd rather see young people getting blown than getting blown away!)

7878278,2,6304819714,"I usually go into indies with an open mind, and keep it until I form an opinion...after the movie.  But, almost immediately, this movie really looked like an attempt by the author to exploit his personal, sexual, relationship for the sake of his other love - film-making.
I easily got past the gritty cinematography.  I've enjoyed other movies with such poor quality image; seeing past the artist's financial limitations for the story they are trying to tell.
The problem was that this movie simply regurgitated a story (A Cold Day In The Park), and did it poorly.  The dialog is actually a narrated script.  It was like watching an episode of ""South Park (tm)"" with a dozen actors playing the parts...but 2 guys doing all the voices in overlay.
The sex...which is, I am sure the biggest draw to buy...is downright porno.  There is fellatio penetration and some simulated sexual activity.  However, it is not even believable that the participants want to be doing it.  A fact which makes even less sense when you realize that [rumor has it] the skinhead boy is actually the main character's boyfriend in real life.
Overall, this movie is for the dedicated followers of Bruce La Bruce and nobody else.  I don't believe it tells a good story, or that it makes any sort of film statement whatsoever.  It's an excuse to redo a film and attempt to make it 'saucier' through the director's exploitation of his personal relationship.
I gave it 2 stars...but really as a reward to myself for making it through the entire film.",1044403200,5,1518,4.741444866920152
7878279,1,6304819714,"Sorry folks-I love low budget, off the wall, extreme camp, all the cult films, etc but this one just doesn't cut it in ANY genre.  A lot of it is the same footage played over and over, same with the music. The sound quality is HORRIBLE, not to mention that a lot of the sound was recorded seperately and doesn't even match up to the moving mouths of the (dare I say?) actors.  I think Bruce La Bruce might have been shooting at an ""artsy-fartsy, foreign"" type feel with this film, along with the B & W thing, but fell WAY short.  The skinhead stays mute for about the first half, where he basically takes a very stupid & LONG bath, then dances around badly in only his boots, flailing his arms around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Purely stupid film.  I rented it, so I FORCED myself to finish watching it, hoping something, ANYTHING would develop.  The thing ended as stupidly as possible and made no sense whatsoever.  Do yourself a favor and rent something else.",1024272000,3,974,4.383333333333334
7878280,4,6304819714,"This movie really isn't for everyone - the poor sound quality and sometimes poor black and white filming will easily discourage the casual  viewer from finishing the film.  Those who stick through it, though, will  be treated to a wryly humorous, adult love story which borrows its basic  plot from ""That Cold Day In The Park"".
Bruce La Bruce puts in a  fine performance as a hairdresser with a skinhead fetish.  He comes across  a skinhead in a park (played by the very cute Klaus von Brucker) and  invites this seemingly mute fellow back to his apartment.  The story  circles around the hairdresser and his obsession with the skinhead (and  skinhead culture).  Along side this main story is the skinhead's sister  (played by Gloria Jones) who's making a film about feminist  revolutionaries...more-or-less.
Throw into this a great soundtrack  (including Operation Ivy and Fifth Column), a truly bizarre apartment (just  where did that pool/grotto come from?) and some Very Explicit Adult Content  (yow!) and you've got something that defies easy classification.  Occassionaly slow, but always interesting, it's definitely worth checking  out.",967507200,22,1144,5.2555555555555555
7878281,2,6304819714,"OK.  I dare say this film does not belong under general comedy.  Others may say it does not belong in Amazon; I am surprised that it is.  This is a special kind of ""Not Rated"" film that has a rather DEFINITE  (attn. ALL reviewers: that is how the word is spelled) target audience.  It's the kind of film to which the poor, impressionable Motion Picture  Association is not normally subjected.  Following the pace of the film,  which actually waits awhile before revealing its true purpose, this is an  indie gay porn flick. The plot begins with a meditation and variation on a  stereotype, one of few interesting parts about the film.  In a sickeningly  self-indulgent role, Mr. LaBruce (ugh) plays a hairstylist with a skinhead  fetish for (hey/ha ha, it makes sense, right).  In a highly convenient turn  of events, he meets one who lives in the park and is cold, so he takes him  home and basically locks him in his apartment.  Fortunately (?) the  skinhead turns out to be fancy lad also, otherwise there would be no porn  but rather a potentially interesting situation of a gay man with a Nazi  locked in his bedroom.  But nooooo, they have to fall in love, and he makes  sure we miss neither the tender moments (i.e. the bathing scene:  ""here, let me help you with the soap."") nor the opulent,  animalistic orgy scenes.  (You WILL look away.)  Incidental characters are  thrown in to explain why the skinhead plays a frustrating mute routine for  half the film, but they have no bearing on the plot.  LaBruce spends  considerable time ""developing"" the independent pornographer  character (a woman, haphazardly tossed into the fray for balance?) but she  somehow manages to be the worst in the film, despite flaming competition.  Basically, there is little redeeming value to this thinly-masked F*-fest.  The snippit with the Nazi salute, followed by the limp-wristed version, is  briefly amusing, and the aqueduct scene is oddly interesting; but no  nonsexual action is anything but biding-time before the next bombardment.  I grow fearful that until now this is beginning to appeal to some people.  The dubbing is rather poor, camerawork is annoying, and I've mentioned my  issues with the plot.  Objectively, it's an impressive work for an  independent filmmaker.  Realistically, is a gee-darn piece of filth. I saw  this with a gay man and a budding bisexual as a part of our college film  series in '99.  The latter walked out early, and the former declared that  the film quite nearly ""scared him straight.""  For me, it was one  of those things you can be proud say you did but you would probably not  choose to do again or even in the first place.  This film should be  relegated to the back alleys of SF and never released to the mainstream  again.  It is pointless and disturbing regardless of one's sexual  orientation.  If you prefer graphic gay violence to graphic gay sex and gay  Chinese men to German, I suggest ""Happy Together"", which was also  shown by our film series.  That one was annoying and no good either, but  others seemed to like it (I won't bother reviewing it; it seems many have  gone into depth).  Note to parents (yeah, right!):  the colleges of today  study nothing but homosexual pornography.  I hope I've been more helpful  than the previous reviewer.",959472000,12,3291,4.772808586762075
