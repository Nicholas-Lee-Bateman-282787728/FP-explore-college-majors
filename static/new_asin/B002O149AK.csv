8375767,2,B002O149AK,"Television documentary by the History Channel about Deadwood, South Dakota and Fort Meade.  This originally came out in 2007, and was intended to be educational regarding the old west, gold mining, and defense / overtaking of Native American Indian Territory sacred to the Dakota Indians.
Lost Worlds was a series of TV presentations about ancient to modern times, recreating if possible, the time periods most pivotal to a specific area or community.  Not limited to the United States, there are 32 episodes, released to DVD.  Egypt, Greece, Germany, Israel, England, Scotland, India, Ireland, Denmark, Russia, Turkey, Jamaica, and other locations of legends based upon historical details.
This specific episode ""Sin City of the West"" is the typical dry and redundant style of nearly all documentaries who filibuster away your time in their own lucrative efforts to make fifteen minutes of information stretch out to an hour of viewing time.
Slightly more interesting than my grandfather's home movie on his 8 MM  movie camera about the garden he and grandmother tended in the side and back yard of their house, circa 1965 in Midwestern Kansas.
My advice before purchasing this particular History Channel episode of the Lost Worlds series, is to look this title up on Wikipedia, ""Lost Worlds (TV series)"", verify this title is in the list of 32 titles, and perhaps seek the title that interests you the most.
To sum up, this DVD has nothing whatsoever even remotely to do with the 2005 release of ""Sin City"" with Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Powers Boothe, etc, which is a crime thriller film about Basin City and the corruption faced by people unfortunate enough that tried to live there.  THAT film is R rated.  This DVD by the History Channel is NOT that film.
The DVD advertised here, is educational foremost, with little entertainment intended in the making of History Channel's ""Lost Worlds: Sin City of the West"".  The photo marketed as being part of this DVD, is not on the outside of the case, which instead has a plain brown wrapper that the History Channel uses, which other than a non-descriptive text that lists the episode title, could be easily used for any of the 32 episodes.",1413072000,,2231,4.949197860962567
