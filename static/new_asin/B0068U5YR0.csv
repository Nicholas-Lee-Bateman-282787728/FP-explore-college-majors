4979383,3,B0068U5YR0,"It is the culture and the law of Saudi Arabia. Of course, all rooted in the religion of Islam.  Hard to believe educated, obviously intelligent women would not only accept this culture, but in some instances, applaud it. Good to see that change - for the better - is occurring. Slowly, but surely.",1353715200,3,297,4.60377358490566
4979384,5,B0068U5YR0,"I presented this documentary to my Psych of Women class and my students found it very interesting. One of the underlying themes in this film is the controversy focusing on the right of women to vote in Saudi Arabia (at present they do not have that right). With an American presidential election coming up in a week this film hit home with many of my students. In addition, this film is a prelude to another movie that will be shown in this class which focuses on the suffragette movement in the United States. Women of the Holy Kingdom encouraged a great deal of discussion in my Psych of Women students on several points including that over 50% of university students in Saudi Arabia are female, that an interviewed woman who does not believe in gender equality is married to a wealthy husband, that Saudi Arabia cannot depend on the oil industry forever and the role that women may play as the Kingdom adapts to non-oil production sources of revenue, etc.

Overall, from my point of view, this film is also very poignant. Please watch it.",1351209600,3,1041,4.627027027027027
4979385,5,B0068U5YR0,"Although the film makers take a position of female equality, there is sensitivity to the difficulty of integrating this new thinking into a traditional societal framework. While the context of how and why the traditions came to be are not explored, there was a useful and nuanced portrayal of the current state of women in Saudi society from many different perspectives.

I appreciate that this film was offered for free online as an educational tool.",1349654400,,451,5.013333333333334
4979386,5,B0068U5YR0,"In the early '80s, while living in a remote location in Saudi Arabia, we often remarked that we'd love to see ""women's lib"" come to the kingdom. Thirty years later, some progress has been made.
This is an excellent documentary, made by an all female crew, showing the advances that have been made and the obstacles that still remain. I continue to hope that one day Saudi Arabia will recognize women as equal citizens.",1345248000,8,418,4.662162162162162
4979387,5,B0068U5YR0,"I've read a lot about women's rights and specifically women's rights in Saudi Arabia, but I have never seen such compelling footage on the subject.  Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy gives the viewer the full spectrum of the topic shown through the experiences of real Saudi women.  I originally saw this on the Discovery Times Channel, and it stayed with me for a while.  I'm glad I can finally pick up the DVD for such a good price.",1334534400,2,422,4.526315789473684
4979388,5,B0068U5YR0,Before this film I knew very little about the women of Saudi Arabia.  This films gets you emeresed in the struggles of Saudi women.  It's incredibly eye opening and so radically different than how women live in America.  Truly fascinating.  This film raises a lot of questions.  I found it to be a great film to show in my high school class (I'm a teacher for 12th grade) that studies current global issues.  Everyone should see this film.,1334534400,3,439,4.564102564102564
4979389,1,B0068U5YR0,"Interesting perspective of one Pakistani woman's experience in Saudi. Not an objective documentary; the woman talks over interviewees who don't share her specific ways of female empowerment. She becomes progressively more judgmental as she seems truly affected by her experience as a foreigner filming on the streets with an all female crew, but  doesn't adapt her tactics in a conservative culture to show the real life of Saudi women's everyday lives. A lot of the film is focused on her asking questions, reacting to responses, and her own interpretations to cultural laws. If you don't care about the bias, watch this film if you want to see some of the interesting people (mainly rich educated women) in Saudi who are fighting for female liberation.",1440460800,,754,5.080645161290323

4979392,2,B0068U5YR0,"I was interested in viewing this film because I live in Riyadh and am curious as to how the country is presented in the media. While the director/narrator offers a few pieces of helpful context, overall the film is seeped in deep bias and presumption. She offers zero critique of her own beliefs, position, and prejudices---crucial for any legitimate sociological work--and consistently draws manifestly unsubstantiated conclusions from her experiences/interviews. The film is a case-in-point for confirmation bias.

This piece could potentially prove useful, but only for people who a) have some level of familiarity with the country and its people and b) are specifically researching ways in which KSA and Saudi women in particular are so often forcibly mischaracterized. The filmmaker engages the issues she addresses at only the most superficial level, and, as a result, succeeds in propagating extremely problematic stereotypes. Thus, this film should not be billed as a learning resource for individuals with no background knowledge or experience of Saudi Arabia or Islam.",1430956800,2,1078,5.493975903614458

4979398,5,B0068U5YR0,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I was completely unaware of how strict Islam was practiced in this country. The journalist cited Saudi Arabia is so much more strict than Egypt or UAE and others. How could the Western World not be aware of such atrocities. I read a review on Amazon from someone who clearly thought that driving, voting, working, and showing your hair had nothing to do with family happiness. That's the Stone Age talking here folks.

I actually felt afraid that this element is allowed to be so prevalent. I hope that after viewing this film I can accept our differences and respect this culture. But how is this allowed to exist in what I previously thought was a progressive country, an ally of the USA. How could a woman president ever interact with such a backward thinking group?

Makes one ponder why these dudes are so deathly afraid of women to enforce so many absurd, arcane, bizarre laws. I watched a show on TV with Anthony Bourdain touring the country and these issues never came up. I guess if I just wanted to sit on my ass and eat bonbons all day and let men be my slaves and drive me everywhere and take me out and never have to do anything, guess this might be the ideal Shangra-La. What a disaster, but bravo for providing this insight! Invaluable.

PS - If you want to compare hormone issues in men vs women, hands down MEN WIN for becoming uncontrollable, maniacal, irrational, idiotic, and plain f'n stupid!",1415664000,3,1455,4.563218390804598
4979399,5,B0068U5YR0,I lived in Jeddah in th 1980's...I found this very interesting in the changing of the Saudi Woman of today.  A great step forward.,1415318400,,130,4.416666666666667

4979401,5,B0068U5YR0,"I lived in Saudi Arabia for three years back in the mid-90's and things have progressed somewhat. I returned to the kingdom in 2009 and saw things that never would have been when I lived there such a men being depicted in billboard ads on the road from the airport in Riyadh. I lived in Riyadh and I traveled in and out of the kingdom without my husband but with his permission. It is there country therefore we are obligated to abide by their law whether we agree with it or not.
I saw the women's lives from many angles. I was an English tutor for members of the royal family and I traveled with them so I know the lifestyle they live. I worked in an all woman household. My employer had her male relative when she needed him (she was a widow with five children) but she not only married a Saudi prince but was a princess in her own right. Therefore she was a very independent woman with her own businesses and properties.
I also tutored women who were not royal which allowed me to see the other side of the coin as well as getting the chance to interact with some Bedouin women. I found it to be a very rewarding time in my life. The people that I met were good hearted and with deep intent on doing what they felt was God's will. That's not to say that there wasn't a dark side to all of this. They were still doing public beheading of crimminals at high noon in the center of Riyadh on Fridays when necessary, according to Sharia.
Women have more influence than was depicted in this film but for the most part it was very accurate. Certainly the attitudes were accurately reflected of the women. Some of the men I think were speaking to the camera and not necessarily speaking their true mind. The muttawa (religious police) were accurately portrayed for certain. I liked the film so much I'm going to buy it.",1412812800,13,1815,4.309941520467836

4979404,5,B0068U5YR0,"Very interesting film. It reminds me that, when we criticize a government, we should think that it is in the middle of more extreme powers (left and right) inside its country. If we were to put an opinion on other cultures/ countries, we should calculate if our opinion really helps on people we want to support.
P.s. I am amazed by some of the review here saying that why didn't the film ask if Saudi Women are happy in their families. This is laughable. A). Those 'traditional' women would not speak to the outside world due to what they believe so it is mission-impossible. If you don't want to speak out, how can other people know your opinion? B). Happy or not is not an objective standard. Freedom to control your own body, your own life is. I bet there must be happy slaves only because they were optimistic and strong in mind. Does it mean that we should enslave people? NO!",1403395200,,882,4.450617283950617
4979405,4,B0068U5YR0,"This is a very insightful film that shows what it's like to be a woman living in Saudi Arabia. It's a tough existence and you see it up close here. The producers also interview women that are satisfied to have their entire public life controlled and actually fear change, so you see the whole issue. The government is also allowed to give their spiel and justify the repression in Saudi society. And they do so shamelessly. Perhaps some of the most interesting moments in the film took place when religious police in one instance and military police in the other, stopped the film crew and was prepared to arrest them on the spot for absurd ""violations."". You really got the feel of living in a police state environment. An excellent and timely documentary.",1398988800,4,757,4.6992481203007515
4979406,1,B0068U5YR0,I dragged the play button to the middle and decide to take a look from the first 15 seconds i realized that this is so lame documentary and it lacks credibility. (a woman can't get admitted into hospital without permission by her father or husband?!) this is absolutely not true and from the fist second the narrator accent with that creepy non-Arabic music (i guess indian) i knew that this is not the type of documentary I would watch to learn.,1394236800,2,446,4.518518518518518
4979407,1,B0068U5YR0,"What is the freedom? I just hear her definition of freedom but i don't hear it from the women in the interview. The women in the interviews are NOT Saudi by the way. I just feel like they came together to insult Saudi women and show the world how bad their situation is. There are many other things more important than driving, working, or voting. Are these women happy in their family lives? It focuses on how women are abused by men but it doesn't show how men treat women generally.",1393718400,2,485,4.34065934065934
4979408,1,B0068U5YR0,"She just tried to show the negative things, she does not consider as a Muslim since she does not know that she must were abaya, plus she was trying to relate every negative things to the religion not the culture or the environment around people. For me she lacks honesty and she went to do this documentary just to show her own prescriptive.",1392422400,2,341,4.428571428571429
4979409,1,B0068U5YR0,The woman who made this film is so biased toward her own point of view that she doesn't listen to what the women in the film are saying. She repeats herself over and over and her feminist bias is over-the-top.,1388793600,6,209,4.25
4979410,4,B0068U5YR0,"Having completed the documentary by a female reporter added more substance to the documentary.  It was her point of view in which I found more interesting, since she was an outsider looking in.  I have never been to Saudi Arabia, however after watching this film I have to come to an understanding that there are many, many inequalities that the country will need to address in the next few decades.",1388620800,2,399,4.685714285714286

4979413,5,B0068U5YR0,This was an incredibly interesting film from a western woman's point of view.  The differences in culture and beliefs are drastic and huge.  I enjoyed watching this and learning about what it is like for a woman in Saudi Arabia.,1385856000,4,228,4.675

4979415,5,B0068U5YR0,"This was a great documentary that exposes a little fraction of how Islamic society allows very limited freedom of expression and rights among Saudi women. Islam is a very controlling religion and it is the law in these countries. The West is so luck in respect of having freedom to express our voices and rights when is necessary and most of the time the government works on doing something, it might not be perfect but they do something. The East is the opposite of that, and most countries there will sentence you to death if you try to voice a different opinion.",1371686400,5,565,4.549019607843137
4979416,3,B0068U5YR0,"This film discusses the role and rights of women in Saudi Arabia. It is interesting to see educated women endorsing such a male-dominated culture. I am very thankful everyday that I was not born in such a culture, but that I have freedom of movement and that I am free to pursue all my goals in life.",1364428800,3,300,4.280701754385965
4979417,5,B0068U5YR0,"This film was very concise and to the point. It explored issues such as women voting and ability to run for office in Saudi. As a women's studies and sociology major I could appreciate the fact that it included voices from many sectors. Such as the media, women's advocates, educated women, young college students and even religious clerics. I would recommend it.",1356652800,11,363,4.870967741935484
4979418,4,B0068U5YR0,"I would recommend this video for those who are interested in the status of women in the Arab countries in general.
I could not say I liked it due to the thematic but it was well done, the information was not biased (in my western view) and it brought me inside a culture that is foreign and different from mine.
I am both interested in status of women and Middle Eastern studies and I was very saddened to see the way women are treated for no apparent reason in Saudi Arabia. The most shocking realization was to see them accepting that behaviour as natural.
Of course it is natural for them as my mentality would be shocking to them, in turn. However, listening to their perfect English and well cultivated manners, these are not rural uneducated women, these are well educated women with a place in society that has been relegated for centuries.. It's a state of mind that is starting to change with baby steps.
Of course there are also courageos women who go against the grain and boy! do they have obstacles....
Great information inside, give it a try.",1354147200,,1056,4.534031413612565
