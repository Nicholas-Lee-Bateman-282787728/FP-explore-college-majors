8147359,5,B000ITESBA,"The construction of ""Boulder"" Hoover Dam was so interesting.  It was an enormous undertaking and seeing how it came about was fascinating.  A part of our history that should not be forgotten.",1373846400,,191,4.9375

8147361,3,B000ITESBA,"This was a great dvd - lots of really cool footage, as they said. However, there is NO SOUND! The beginning is in silent film style (with pictures and then a screen with words). The second film is just snipits pieced together with no sound.

Not as expected, but it was still really cool to see the footage. Overall would recommend!",1179446400,3,332,4.442622950819672
