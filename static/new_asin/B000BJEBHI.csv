8087388,5,B000BJEBHI,"I bought the Skippy DVD for my son to see some details of Australian life and to see what a fascinating animal a kangaroo is.
 Mission accomplished.
What I did not expect was  that, so many decades on, the series would be a big hit. Skippy is cute and this recording shall be making the rounds among my nIeces and nephews for a while to come.
I'm glad I bought this product and I would recommend it to people with children under ten.",1317427200,4,433,4.204819277108434
8087389,5,B000BJEBHI,"I have vivid childhood memories of watching ""Skippy The Bush Kangaroo""
on Saturday Morning TV in the United States when I was young. Although
the premise of the show was a blatant rip-off of ""Lassie"", I fell in
love with Skippy and the gang at first sight. It was like nothing I had
ever seen in the USA. To see a loveable Kangaroo roaming freely
as a family pet and solving improbable tasks was mind blowing. In
America it's all Dogs, Cats and Hamsters and this kid had a freakin'
Kangaroo as his sidekick! Plus the locales of the Outback were so alien
and interesting compared to what was outside my door. Most American kids
only see a kangaroo in a zoo and to see one playing drums with a rock
band was a hoot (Yes, I know Skippy didn't actually play drums but back
then I thought he could do anything). How this show made it to US TV is
a mystery to me but it translated well to the US market. Years later I
bought an all regions DVD player and this series is the reason why. Sweet,
Loveable, Cheesey and fun, ""Skippy"" recalls a innocent time long forgotten.
A Word of Warning: Once the ""Skippy"" theme song is heard you will never
get it out of your head. In fact I'm singing it right now: ""Skippy...Skippy
...Skippy The Bush Kangaroooo...""",1278115200,8,1244,4.343347639484978
