It took a very long time to get here, and on x-mass morning when he wanted to watch it we found out that we did not have the right dvd player for the region, I guess it only plays in England.  We never knew there were regions and everyone I asked also knew nothing about it.  The co. pretty much said we we shiot out of luck and to buy a new dvd player they had some, need less to say I did not purchase anything else from them..  They should of explained things better we still have not been able to watch Rich Man Poor Man.",1244764800,,637,3.876923076923077
8193213,5,B000PSTBUM,"After waiting many years for this to be available, I was not at all disappointed!!! In many ways it was much better than I remembered! I had a much different take watching it as an adult than as a teen. Personally, while my girlfriends were digging Nick Nolte, I was and still am a huge Peter Strauss fan!!  I still have my Rudy Jordache poster!  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed watching and discussing it!!  If you like Peter Strauss, I recommend Massada. Another terrific performance!",1240012800,,490,4.674418604651163
8193214,3,B000PSTBUM,not as good as I remembered it but hey what things from the 70's are?,1238976000,,69,3.6666666666666665
8193215,5,B000PSTBUM,An excellent TV series. I wish it was available in USA. Very happy with transection.,1229385600,,84,4.666666666666667
8193216,5,B000PSTBUM,"Like a previous review, I can only praise this mini-series and am disappointed and bemused as to why it has never been released for DVD viewing in the USA format.  It has been a joke trying to contact the original distributor and studio to voice a complaint.  If anyone knows how to facilitate a ""request"" campaign...please share!",1220832000,5,330,4.771929824561403
8193217,5,B000PSTBUM,"I remember the series vividly from 32 years ago but I have no idea why they have chosen to only release it on DVD in the UK. Why is the rest of the world denied? This was a multi award winning mini-series of epic proportions and yet it still isn't available except in the UK and it has never aired (to my knowledge) since it's inception. It's about time it was made available...PLEASE!!!
Maybe if everyone who wants a copy outside the UK leaves a comment here, they will get off their butts and release it! I sure would like to see it again before I die.",1219622400,9,554,4.186915887850467
8193218,5,B000PSTBUM,"This has to be the best miniseries of all times. Sorry Shogun!!!! Nick Nolte was at his best. I just hated Julie through the entire series. This is truely a must have for the entire family. Tell me, is there anyone alive who did not cry when Tom died?",1210550400,7,251,4.142857142857143
