8214134,5,B000UOD0DK,I am not a choreographer so my students were missing a fun part of music.  The DVD solved that problem with fun movements that my middle school chorus really enjoyed.  I was able to apply the material presented immediately and plan to use other material that is on this DVD during the coming year.  Highly recommend to any choir director looking to movement into their show.,1340668800,,374,4.636363636363637
