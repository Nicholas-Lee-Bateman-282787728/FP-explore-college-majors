4013164,3,B002YI9304,"What went wrong here?  Why does this film just stop instead of reaching a conclusion of some sort?  What happened to the ending?  CABIN FEVER 2 is not a good sequel to the original film as it strays way too far from the things that made the original work so well.  Setting the film in a high school was the wrong idea from the start, but the film did manage to have a lot of fun going for it.  It even managed to ""get me"" once with a scene involving a head hitting the side of a swimming pool and there are plenty of fairly revolting gross out sequences.  There are also some major laughs in this movie and it does manage to convey the strange offbeat nature of the first film fairly well.
Deputy Winston is back and his character provides some of the best moments in the film.  This time he is joined with his cousin, Herman, played by Mark Borchardt of COVEN fame.  The two are great together.  Somehow Rider Strong gets top billing in this thing and that is very deceptive.  He is onscreen for perhaps 45 seconds and is in makeup that entirely obscures his face.  Anyone could have played the role in this makeup.  He has no lines and simply gets up out of the water and runs to the road where he is immediately run over by a school bus.  This is even before the (bad) opening title credits.  Speaking of the credits, they are animated and the tone is way off.  The end sequence is likewise animated and it is truly a stupid choice.  In spite of the flaws in this film (one of which is the cast, most of whom are rather unattractive) I really enjoyed the first 70 minutes or so but the ending (or complete lack of one) really brings this film down.  Clearly this was a movie that was building toward something and I believe the director had a clear vision in mind of where all this was heading.  Sadly, nothing gets resolved.  The film simply stops with no sort of climax or resolution to anything.  It seems like an unfinished film. Director Ti West has went on the record to disown this version of the film and correctly so.  It is apparent that something seriously wrong happend here.  It isn't good enough on its own merits to justify a directors cut of the film so this mess is what we will have to live with.  Frankly, I hope there are no more CABIN FEVER films.  The first one is a classic and if this is what the producers are going to do with the sequels then I would rather not see any more.  It isn't an awful movie, has fun and grotesque moments, but the butcherd cut of the film LionsGate has released is a real disapointment.",1266364800,,2542,4.245833333333334
4013165,1,B002YI9304,"I was super excited to see this, and Cabin Fever did need a sequel, but this was just awful.  I was excited that deputy Winston was back, but his lines weren't funny at all. Oh and Rider Strong is in the movie for less than a minute.  There are a couple of cool gory parts, but they aren't tied into the movie in any way.  They are just random gory parts just thrown in between the crap scenes.  The only plot is developed out of a fat kid wannabe ""Seth from Superbad"".  Save your time and just watch the original.

4013181,3,B002YI9304,"Certainly not as good as Cabin Fever and Cabin Fever 3. This movie's two main problems is the low budget cheaply done gore and the overkill sexually scenes. There are sexual parts that I honestly have to fast forward through since they are too disgusting. The only reason I give this three stars and not one is because I am a very huge fan of the saga and the humor was pretty good and so was the overall plot.

The idea of the virus breaking out on prom night was a pretty awesome idea and seeing Winston appear again was hilarious. But the sexual themes and cheap gore ruined it.

Plus the strange thing was...the school and town was supposed to be in the same town as the first film but it didn't seem like it was. In the first film, the town was VERY redneck and country. But in this film, it's more modern and suburban. So that makes it awfully confusing.

4013189,1,B002YI9304,"I love ""Cabin Fever.""  It's a hilarious film with more than ample gore, that succeeds as a satire as well as a horror film.  It was creative and fun.

On the other hand, ""Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever"" is an appalling lifeless mess, a waste of 100 minutes of your life.  It fails on every level.  Where ""Cabin Fever"" was fun, ""Cabin Fever 2"" was boring.  Where ""Cabin Fever"" was creative, ""Cabin Fever 2"" was a mechanical paint-by-numbers regurgitation of hoary old horror tropes.  The script and story are awful, the direction is awful (what is up with the fact that every other shot is a Steadicam held 8 feet in front of two people walking???), and the acting is awful.

""Cabin Fever 2"" is quite literally the worst movie I've seen in 2014.  Do not buy, do not rent.  Put it out of your mind in that category of sequels that people say exist but really don't, like Alien 3 or Terminator 3.  I will now stick my head in the sand and forget that this (fortunately forgettable) monstrosity exists.

4013190,4,B002YI9304,"I'm a huge fan of the first movie, and I generally enjoyed this one- but there are some major issues that pop up out of left field and left me liking this less in the end than I did for the vast majority of the movie.

Yes, there's lots of sexual talk and even some nudity and sexual acts (not graphic, but more than implied). It's a horror film, one revolving around teens, and there was such in the first, so I don't understand the complaints about it. Yes, it's gross. Majorly gross at points (how do you feel about uber-gross fingernail or genitalia issues?) But it's a horror movie about a highly contagious flesh eating virus, so what else would you expect? It's not crazy-over-the-top-can't-watch-it type stuff for most of us who love gross horror, but it's boundary pushing a time or two. I don't understand how that shocks some, given the nature of this type of movie.

Some complain about the 'pointless cartoons' at the beginning and end. If you pay the slightest bit of attention, you'll understand that these cartoon vignettes are critical to move the story along and explain some things, like how it spread to the point where it's an issue at the high school prom and past that. A cartoon compresses the explanation to give the viewer the info far faster than having everyone act it out or coming up with 'live' scenes that give the same info. I personally liked them and thought they were well done.

(Mild spoiler alert)

So where it fell apart-
Despite being decently thought-out and 'plausible' for most of the movie, it falls apart in the last 15 or 20 minutes. It's like the director just wanted to get it done and didn't give a damn how, as long as they wrapped it up. There's an amputation scene where we understand why the character opts for such drastic measures, but the way his companion just goes along with makes no sense, given that one's nature. Nor does it make sense how they're both A-OK with the 'surgeon' getting drenched in infected blood, even though the characters understand how it's transmitted and the surgeon's (as far as we can tell) uninfected until then. The guys-in-space-suits crew working to contain the outbreak tackle one character as they attempt to escape. They ALL pile on that one while the other clearly-infected character dashes off to obvious freedom. ""No, Joe, let that one go. We need all 8 of us to pin down the one that can't even stand!"" (not a real quote, but a plausible one, given what they did there)

The dopey cop from the first one is back, and he goes gets his cousin to sneak him past a roadblock and out of town because he's caught on to what's going on. He still opts (without hesitation) to pick up an obvious prom-goer covered in blood from head to toe. So he 'gets' what's going on, understands people are dying at the prom from this flesh-eating disease, but he still lets the prom-going, blood-drenched hitchhiker in with a smile. C'mon...even he's not that dumb!

Very good for 3/4 of the movie, about 10 minutes of 'Really? I'm supposed to buy THAT?!' and then another really good 10 or 15 minutes. I would have loved it as much as the first if not for the 'lazy' span where the director let stuff fly just to get it done. I liked it in general, but the sloppiness in the plot really eroded some of my enjoyment of it in the end.",1407283200,,3309,4.506666666666667

4013196,4,B002YI9304,"This was not a perfect movie but it was fun

I almost want to say that I liked this more than the original, but that isn't something I can say. I like that this movie had many of the same people from the first one. There were many callbacks to the original, and it even gave a larger part to some side characters from the first one. This was a welcomed surprise.

I also enjoyed the fact that this movie was made in a setting other than a cabin. I know that sounds silly but for this movie to be in a cabin might very well have lead to a rehashing of the original story. Instead, we get a telling that isn't perfect but at least it tried to ensure that things went a different direction. This movie made me laugh and had some gore, i think that is all we should expect.

As you probably know, the virus from the first time basically ends up in a high school on prom night(which makes the whole ""Spring Fever"" thing a head scratcher).  Before the prom climax, we're treated to a rather standard high school melodrama about an average Joe trying to win the love of his childhood sweetheart.  Naturally she's dating the biggest jerk in the school, and naturally our hero is accompanied by a chubby, horny wisecracking Seth Rogan type character.  And of course when the poop finally hits the fan, our hero and his love interest seem to be the only people who didn't get infected and are now looking for a way out of the school.  Plus, the school(and town) have been sealed off by those pesky gun toting brutes in the gas masks and hazmat suits who are mowing down everybody in sight.  No explanation is given as to who they are or where they're from, but since we've all seen these types of films many times over, we can safely assume they are a special government branch sent out to contain the virus.
Like the first film, this one goes for the more zany, comic angle, rather than trying to scare your pants off.  The emphasis is really on gruesomeness.  Like many horror films these days, it likes to see how far it can push things.
SEE....A Pus Oozing Penis In Shocking Technicolor!!!!
While the grossness is fun in it's own right, the movie isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is, nor are the characters all that interesting.  It is rather cliche ridden, in both the horror film sense as well as the high school teen flick sense.
I was kind of surprised however to see a scene in which an obese girl is seduced by dashing, blond jock.  Usually in films, any sex involving an obese character is usually done for comical reasons.  Or the seducer does it because he has selfish ulterior motives(like distracting the girl while his dimwitted buddy sabotages something).  But that's not the case here-The guy seems legitimately turned on by her and takes her away to do the deed with her.  Of course, this being the movie it is, it ends gruesomely. But his intentions seemed pure though!  I thought that was kinda cool actually.
Problems plagued the production of this film, and director Ti West probably wants to distance himself as much as he can from it.  Considering all that went on, and a lack of Eli Roth's involvement(not that I really care about that, because I think Roth is the most overrated horror director of the last decade), the movie could have been so much worse....so much.

This movie should had been located in the ""cabin"" like the first and not in a school. But, it being not in a school is the least of its problems.

The character development in this movie is really bad. When I started to see each and everyone of the main characters die, I didn't really care. All I thought was, ""everyone dying really fast"". There's is no scary or horror feel to this movie. It is just people dying one after each other. Or it is people trying to escape from the extermination people. The extermination people were never really introduced and just seemed to come out of no where. Then, they just started killing people off.

This movie doesn't seem to have much planning out to it. The first movie was much better made. It had a few main people. Then, one of them slowly get the disease and they all try to help that person. Then, another gets it and that person try to find help. Then, one after another gets it, but it is slowly done. This is good because you get to know the characters better and by seeing them more and more you start caring for them to stay alive.

What this second installment lacks in special effects it makes up for with guts, plot-induced or otherwise. The last of the mutated survivors from the first movie gets hit by a car, exploding in a blood-bag spatter into the town's water supply. I'm a sucker for animated montages, and Cabin Fever 2's introductory cartoon, accompanied by a grim folk song, sets the right tone for a town about to get very, very sick.

The acting is surprisingly good for a movie about a blood-vomiting infection. It centers on the town's prom, and to the writers' credit he takes time to explore each character's hopes, dreams, and petty grievances before making them puke their brains out.

Nothing is sacred in Cabin Fever 2 and no orifice is off limits.  Blood ends up everywhere in the most awful circumstances imaginable, and for those who enjoy that sort of thing Cabin Fever 2 delivers in buckets. It also borrows a plot device used in Quarantine - the men in biohazard suits that show up to contain the infection are worse than the infection itself.

Unfortunately, once the prom is over Cabin Fever 2 runs out of bloody steam.  There's an extraneous clip of a stripper who missed the prom infecting other people, another unnecessary animated montage, and a feeling that the ruthless moviemaking apparatus that churns out grad z horror movie sequels will not be denied.

4013217,4,B002YI9304,"I suppose if you are going to do a horror movie done in an older time period bringing Ti West in was the absolute best move they could go with. While I was a bit hesitant at wondering how Ti would address the blatant overuse of blood and gore that was used in the first Cabin Fever he showed he can do a fun B styled horror movie just as well as one that focuses on suspense. This is two movies under his belt that are just outstanding pieces of work that draw on the roots of older horror themes.

The movie itself begins with a police officer who was involved in the original story, Winston, cleaning up after another survivor who was hit by a truck. We are quickly after that shown in an amazingly well done cartoon style that is completely reminiscent of the 80's how the disease was able to spread through a water company to a nearby school. We flash to the school and are introduced to our lead characters. It's the day of Prom and a combination of a group of friends and acquaintances are gathering to prepare for the night. While most of this group are planning on staying in there are a few that want to go and show us that most end up there.

At prom the infected bottled water is being rapidly spread through the student body as it has been used in the punch that everyone is drinking from. The amount of creative uses of this disease as well as the gore that is used completely reminds me of a classic B movie. One of the first instances of the gratuitous blood involves a pool scene which I'm sure everyone will love. One warning though - soon after though we are shown the government has been made aware of the water supply being infected and the entire school is locked down.

There is a scene that every single male watching this will visibly cringe at. It wasn't necessary to add in and is Ti's cruel joke on us all. That's my only explanation. Seriously you'll briefly hate him for the scene before being drawn back into the story.

Ti closed the film with another 80's styled cartoon that showed how they could lead it into a third movie or end it where it's at. While I am loving Ti's stylized almost time period pieces I hope he is able to tackle a modern day or paranormal film with the same form of style, currently in the works Ti has a comedy being made and more importantly for what I just said a horror film about two employees that work at a haunted hotel. While it's not planned to be released until 2011 I hope he is able to do a paranormal movie as the two I've just gone over were amazing pieces of work and I cannot wait to see where he goes with it.",1301875200,,2583,4.212121212121212

I recommend it to horror fans that like blood and some genre cliches. You see most of it coming but it is still cool to see it go down. It's not as good as the original but based on the lower budget that they filmed it on that is not surprising. Also they leave room for a third which I would love to see.

4013219,2,B002YI9304,"Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever (Ti West, 2009)

Those who are familiar with Ti West's other 2009 release, The House of the Devil, will probably be very surprised by Cabin Fever 2. Unless, that is, they are also familiar with The Roost, a terrifyingly bad film West directed back in 2005 that pops up occasionally on a certain horror-centric cable channel that shall remain nameless. The gap in quality between those two movies is less a gap than it is a chasm. And when you realize that Cabin Fever 2 was actually shot about halfway between those two films (it was shelved for two and a half years before finally getting a release), everything falls into place. Which is to say, while this movie is not fit to lick the bootprints of The House of the Devil by anyone's standards, it's a couple of orders of magnitude better than The Roost.

If you will recall, we left Cabin Fever, Eli Roth's wildly entertaining gorefest, with one of the victims finally succumbing at the very edge of a body of water, after which we get a quick montage of... exactly where this movie is going. The nasty flesh-eating bug that was previously confined to a crazy woodsman and a cabinful of partying kids is now drifting into the local water supply (which also happens to contain a bottled-water factory). The virus hits town just as the local high schoolers are getting ready for prom, and our pals the guys in the biohazard suits show up just in time for the first kids to start falling apart, locking in the uninfected (most notably Deadgirl's Noah Segan and Factory Girl's Alexi Wasser) with a bunch of crazy, murderous thugs.

Rider Strong (briefly) and Giuseppe Andrews return from the first movie; otherwise, the cast is all-new, and not all that hot, aside from a cameo (even more briefly) from Larry Fessenden. The script was written by one Joshua Malkin, the second unit director on the 2007 film Borderland (where he came into contact with Rider Strong, presumably); this is his first and, to date, last attempt at feature screenwriting (off a story by West and Randy Pearlstein, who co-wrote the script for the first one with Eli Roth). It is, not surprisingly, terrible. But really, all you need to know about this movie is that West attempted to disown it and was denied by the studio. That wasn't a bad idea. * ",1299542400,,2304,4.639705882352941

Re: At some point after the first, far superior Cabin Fever, an infected victim staggers from the woods and is struck by a bus. Then, according to a craptastic animated opening, the infection is spread to the water supply and neatly bottled for consumption. Naturally, the bottles are delivered to a high school full of 27 year olds and people start leaking and oozing all over the place.

Outstanding: Nothing. There were brief moments of decent gore, surrounded by abysmal gore.

Unacceptable: Where to start? The acting, the casting, the effects, the opening and closing. The middle. The story, the direction and the location.... Take your pick.

Summary: Not worth watching. The only reason I made it through to the horrible, unfunny end was because I had my laptop open in front of the screen while I worked on other things.

4013222,3,B002YI9304,"It's never a good sign when a director attempts to distance himself from a film. Such is the case with the sequel to Eli Roth's gross-out opus, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cabin-Fever/dp/B0000VCZNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cabin Fever</a>."" Director Ti West tried and failed to remove his name from the final product that is ""Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever"" and it's easy to see why. The film is as messy and ridiculous as it is uneven and patched together. That's not say that some enjoyment can't be milked from this unnecessarily but entertaining sequel, though. If you are of the variety who enjoys cheesy splatter flicks with a heavy dosage of gross-out humor, this might just be up your alley.

Picking up where the first film left off, the virus has now spread from a cabin to a high school prom where teenagers are unknowingly knocking back tainted punch. Before long, the school is quarantined and its up to a couple of misfits to get out and warn the rest of the world. Needless to say, things get nasty rather quickly.

Aside from returning actors Giuseppe Andrews and Rider Strong, ""Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever"" features an all-new cast. Andrews is thankfully given a larger role than in the first and is the saving grace of the film. He's as hilarious and off-beat as ever and is probably the best connection this movie has to its predecessor. Strong has a decidedly smaller role, however. Without giving too much away, his part is minor at best (certainly not worthy of the top-billing he receives on the film) but he was probably just happy to get work. Afterall, the residuals from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boy-Meets-World/dp/B0044LYRFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boy Meets World</a>"" re-runs ain't gonna pay the bills. The rest of the cast is competent if forgettable, with a few in particular looking and sounding as if they stepped off the set of a Rob Zombie film. Judah Friedlander of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Rock/dp/B002N5N5KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Rock</a>"" fame has a fleeting cameo, but it's really the cast of mis-matched teenagers (see: 20-30 year olds) who are left to carry the film. In spite of their lack of charisma, they certainly add some color where the film needs it.

The narrative at hand isn't particularly inventive, but is a nice throwback to 80's teen splatter flicks that would likely make Roth proud. It's a shame though that the film is so uneven and comes unraveled towards the end. Director Ti West was left out of the cutting room and it shows. While it serves its purpose as a campy homage to Roth's original and the genre itself, the film can't help but succumb to its own short-comings. Just as it gets good it ends abruptly, leaving many questions looming over the viewer's head. Perhaps someday West's cut will surface, but in the meantime, warts and all, ""Cabin Fever 2"" is an acceptable if tough-to-love follow-up.

Actually, it turns out that West tried to get his name removed from the credits of the film and basically refuses to claim any part of the film as his own.  I certainly can't blame the guy for that because Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever is the kind of film that could and probably should ruin the careers of everyone even remotely associated with it.  This is just one humongous, steaming pile of cinematic cow patty here.

So just how to you take one of the horror genre's most disappointing and overrated movies and actually fall to new lows with the sequel?  Isn't it obvious?  You turn the whole production into the lamest high school horror comedy of all time and top it off with copious amounts of projectile vomiting.  That doofus cop from the first film?  Make sure he has plenty of scenes in this one.

Hey, cameraman, let's do some weird angle shots, especially of that ridiculous-looking teacher with the beehive hairdo - the kids just go crazy for those weird camera angles.  Oh, oh, oh!  Heeheehee!  Let's animate the opening credits and an ending sequence - that'll really mess with viewers' puny little minds.  A decent story?  What are you smoking?  We've got kids projectile vomiting on each other all over the place - we don' need no stinkin' story, amigo!

OK, I have to admit there is actually a story - not much of one, but a story nonetheless.  Cabin Fever 2 basically takes place immediately following the events of the first movie.  By this point, the contamination has spread to the water supply, and the local bottling company's first shipment of contaminated water goes to the high school - on the day of the prom, no less.  That does not bode well for the obligatory party punch, which all the kids will be drinking (actually, thanks to the 12-year-old mentality of the filmmakers, there's an even more disgusting ingredient than the flesh-eating virus that finds its way into the punch).  I guess we're supposed to care about the three main characters, but I will leave that option entirely up to each individual viewer.

To sum up, I hated every single thing about this movie.  It's an insult to the viewer's intelligence; it's offensive in the way it shamelessly ridicules the outcasts of high school society; its pitiful attempts at humor (mostly juvenile) fail completely; and it relies entirely too much on blood and gore for its appeal to viewers.

Ti West, director of the cult favorite HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, disassociated himself with the project, citing numerous difficulties in the production process. Anyone that has seen the final product can understand why, but this straight-to-video sequel isn't the complete disaster it has been made out to be. Students at the local high school are in for a big surprise when the flesh-eating virus from the previous film finds its way into the prom care of a case of infected spring water. Though the teen-edgy script is wholly idiotic, it is equally entertaining with its low-brow humor and gooey gross-outs. Even the stock characters and empty plotting are outweighed by the exploding bodies, projectile vomit, bloody water sports, and countless other repulsive gags. Following Roth's lead, Ti West also includes a number of references to genre classics, most noticeably in the reprisal of the PROM NIGHT theme on the dance floor. Despite its harsh criticism, CABIN FEVER 2 is a surprisingly enjoyable if not utterly stupid shocker.

If I can contribute anything to the horror loving community - save your money and your time and avoid this piece of drivel - the only thing it has in common with its predecessor is in the title, thats it. What a disappointment!",1272067200,5,930,4.491124260355029

4013241,3,B002YI9304,"Seriously, no cabin in Cabin Fever 2! Okay, there's been lots of good reviews here about what's right and what's wrong. I enjoyed the characters and the writing, strong high school interacting reminding me a bit of ""Heathers"", though not near that caliber. Noah Segan was a great leading man as John, the only thing I remember his from was as the ""twink"" in ""Adam & Steve"" and he was quite scene-stealing in that brief appearance!

Besides missing the cabin, or as I envisoned from the cover art I thought maybe a bus would break down in the woods at least! But that was ""Jeeper Creepers 2""! Okay I missed the slow skin-devestation from the first movie. These guys just started vomiting blood too fast, and for many that was it! Vomit, then dead! None of the tension of discovery that took place in the first Cabin. But of course you couldn't actually do that in a prom movie. Anyone slowly discovering lesions whilst getting dressed for or arriving at the prom would flee immediately to a doctor!

So the epidemic becomes rather rushed in this one. I actually can't remember how it ended now all of a sudden, and it was just last night! I guess that speaks for the ending. Last night while watching I wondered if I'd keep this or re-sell it, esp. since my horror dvds have grown beyond the boundries of the shelves I have them in. I think I will for now. maybe instead I should figure out how to pawn off that awful ""Bottom Feeder"" I watched the other night!

Oh, Rider Strong gets top billing? For a cameo that could me anyone under that make-up? Pleez, I want that kind of agent! :)",1270339200,,1585,4.439862542955327
4013242,3,B002YI9304,"Apparently, everybody here is knocking this because of it's title.

I know this movie went through some major post-production overhauls (like the new ""The Wolfman"" - and that sucked); but, for what it is - there's a legitimate indie feeling to it I don't usually get from a studio released film (even straight to video).

Maybe credit it to Ti West?

Either way, worth a look. I enjoyed it - and took it for what it was. If you compare it to part one - you'll be disappointed. If not - you may enjoy it.

4013244,5,B002YI9304,"I know why this movie was straight-to-DVD, and it's not because it sucked. In fact, the movie was quite good, and much better than I expected it to be. Okay, okay -- it was no ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" but it certainly was no ""Jeepers Creepers II,"" which was not a good sequel. As a matter of fact, ""Cabin Fever II - Spring Fever"" was actually a very campy and very unexpected. If you're going to watch this -- which I do recommend, even if you haven't seen the first ""Cabin Fever"" -- be open-minded, because it's actually quite good. And -- don't eat anything beforehand! I wanted to throw up from the very beginning; the crude images of the film are vomit-inducing, disturbing, gruesome, and so outrageous that it seemed impossible for it to be a mainstream film.

The film pays homage to many horror classics: ""Carrie,"" in that the prom-goers try to bum-rush the doors out of the gymnasium. ""Prom Night,"" in that much of the music imitates the music from the ORIGINAL ""Prom Night."" And many, many others. The film has ripped-out fingernails and teeth, and hammers to the head, saws, miscarriages, and, of course, the notorious flesh eating virus from the first ""Cabin Fever.""

This film was a splendid surprise, and very campy, and very reminiscent of the 80s classics. I would strongly recommend you try out this movie.",1269043200,2,1325,4.6581196581196584
4013245,2,B002YI9304,"...but nowhere as good a film.  The best thing about this is the clever animation opening and ending.  Rider Strong gets top billing and was only in the quick opening.  All the students look 25 or older, and most of them can't act.  There is so much gore that it becomes comical.  The ending comes too quickly without any real resolution, although another sequel wouldn't surprise me..and the peeing in the punchbowl just over the top!  No wonder so many remakes are Hollywood's thing now!",1268092800,3,489,4.694117647058824
4013246,4,B002YI9304,"When I heard they were making a sequel to 'Cabin Fever', I immediately brushed it off.  First off, Eli Roth would not be returning as the director...although, not necessarily a bad thing.  But the fact that new director Ti West had completely disowned the film and it was going to be released straight to DVD, I knew this had to be a total suckfest.  But boy was I wrong.

The film starts up basically where the first one left off.  Paul (played by Rider Strong) makes his way through the woods, leaving behind a trail of loose flesh with every tree branch that he brushes up against.  If you haven't seen the first film, it's basically about a group of teenagers who comes in contact with a deadly flesh eating virus.  In this film we find out that the culprit is a local bottling plant in town called ""Down Home Water""...and unfortunately they just so happen to supply bottled water to the local high school.

Rider Strong's character quickly meets his demise via the front end of a speeding school bus and this leads us into the next chapter of the 'Cabin Fever' saga...A new group of kids, same deadly virus.  A majority of this film takes place around a high school prom where the teens not only try to survive the deadly outbreak, but they also have to contend with a contamination squad who shows up looking to use deadly force as a way to contain the virus.

Overall I enjoyed this film much more than I did the original and it surprises me, having now watched it, that Ti West had such an issue with the end result.  The thing that I liked the most about the movie was the overall tone.  Even though the movie is filled with gallons, upon gallons of the ""red stuff"", which is sure to gross out most movie goers, the dialog and acting is presented in a rather campy way which makes it so much fun to watch.  You can tell that the actors really had a blast with the roles they are given because it certainly comes across that way on screen.  There's also some really great cameo appearances with comedian Judah Friedlander and also Mark Borchardt of 'American Movie' fame who shows up playing Giuseppe Andrews' heavy metal listenin' cousin Herman.

The makeup effects by Quantum Creation's are surely the main selling point of this feature.  Like I said before, there's tons of gore in this film...Before the movie is over we see blood splattered throughout the entire school practically.  Some of the more memorable bits for me include Paul getting hit by the school bus in the beginning of the film and also a local townie who succumbs to the virus while eating pancakes at a local diner.  There's so much stuff going on though that it's hard to pick out a favorite really.  Gorehounds certainly won't be disappointed.

'Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever' was released by Lions Gate Home Entertainment on February 16th, 2010 and fans of the original will definitely want to give this one a watch.  Even though most of the reviews I see regarding the film have been negative, I can't help but to call B.S. on all of them.  Other than the less than stellar ending, I found this movie to be highly enjoyable and definitely worth checking out.

3.5 out of 5 stars

4013247,3,B002YI9304,"It's frustrating to think what could've been.  Adam Green (Hatchet) wrote a treatment for this movie, but it was and never will be produced.  I think the biggest problem this movie has is in its context as a direct sequel.  If it was heralded as an 80's throwback gross-out feature and re-packaged as ""Prom Fever"" we all would have lowered expectations and enjoyed it more.  In keeping the crossover material, it would've worked better as the second film in a ""Fever"" series, kind of like how George Romero's films work.  Also, Ti West is great at what he does, but may have been a poor choice for this particular film.  I think Adam Green, however, could have given us the kick ass direct sequel we were all hoping for.",1267920000,2,720,4.542635658914729

4013250,3,B002YI9304,"Maybe if they release a ""Directors Cut"" with more conclusion or story, this might have been a great movie. It just picks up and goes, with no background and completely makes fun of itself along the way.

""This Is Evil Dead II Fueled By Teenage Hormones!""  ... Is possibly the worst comparison in the world. Only thing remotely close in comparison is the fact the lead character... or teenager, takes his arm off, yes arm, to the elbow. Although the next seen he's just missing his hand?

I know, im sure there was some sort of budget. And I was wrong for going into this hoping for something great. I give up hope on Direct-To-DVD films. Seems like no one is even trying anymore. This film for example, they had a great plot, awesome potential of a story, even returning cast from the first (Which was great and original)... Seemed the film was more focused on a ""Gross"" factor. Thats not a selling point, lets move on.

Rider Strong... well, I think he did great in the first one. My hopes of having some focal point with his characters awakening, were literally smashed with a bus in the first 2 minutes. So why is he mentioned as leading role? Why did you come back to this horrible sequel, Rider!?? The effects were great, but why? Anywho... moving on.

As I mentioned with the bus scene, the effects are pretty good in the film, definately credit due. No complaint, except as to why they really needed a scene with the kid and his infected junk spitting. Theres a difference between good gore and over-doing it. That was it.

The acting was surprisingly decent, and it was great seeing the main character lose it and scream at the girl he loves. That scene was well worth the watch, who hasn't wanted to blow up and say everything on their mind like that at some point?

As for the story, so much potential and so much left undone. Why didn't we put more effort here??? My biggest complaint, who are the guys in the suits? Im sure its some sort of government team sent in to clean up, but why no details? Another thing, what happened to the main character? He gets taken away and BAM, next scene. First film did it right, you were attatched to the lead characters, then they were taken away and you hated it. This film, when the characters are taken away, all I felt was... oh well.

I don't want to steer people away from this film, because I loved the idea of a sequel, and even the scenario. It just could have been better. I recommend a rental, but its not worth the $16.99 as listed. Maybe $9. If for some horrible reason you guys ever make a third installment... PLEASE, learn from the mistakes. Take your time, and make sure it doesnt suck... actually watch it.

4013256,3,B002YI9304,"I admittedly wasn't too fond of the original Cabin Fever, and with all the news of production problems that plagued this Eli Roth-less sequel, plus with all the time it spent on Lions Gate's shelf, it's a wonder how Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever didn't turn out to be a steaming train wreck.  Instead, what we get here instead is a film that feels as if it's half-finished, and for all rights and purposes, it is.  Ti West helms the film, which picks up shortly after the events of the first film, with that same flesh eating virus wrecking havoc upon high school kids at prom.  Where the film shines is surprisingly with these high school/teen conventions, which West manages to handle with actual care, just as he did with his excellent recent film The House of the Devil.  And oh yeah, there is a heaping amount of gore and sick gross out moments to be had as well.  If you're a gorehound, you'll be happy with what all you find here.  Where the film fails however is thanks to its ending, or rather lack there of.  West had many disagreements with the producers, leading to an ending that truly has been assembled without the man's approval.  Still though, there's enough here to recommend Cabin Fever 2 if you have the stomach for it: the animated segments are nicely done, there's a great soundtrack, Giuseppe Andrews returns as the party loving cop Winston (as does Rider Strong in an incredibly brief, but oh so memorable, turn of events in the film's opening), and as said before, there is a heaping amount of gore and just plain disgusting moments.

8384226,1,B002YI9304,"The movie is godawful. I was considering to give it 2 stars for at least being shot professionally, but I was annoyed almost through the entire movie after an ok initial sequence that ends when a school bus enters the picture.

It starts with Chris Tucker's biggest fan, Giuseppe Andrews, a cop of sorts, imitating to a tee Tucker's amazing diction (you might know Andrews from having directed such avantgarde classics as ""Who flung Poo?"" and ""Cat piss""). You then are treated to the most underachieving high school in the U.S. ...or at least you have to assume as much, as every last student's age is clearly such that they not only finished high school, but also college, graduate school, and some post-graduate studies (the lead is around 29 at the time of shooting the movie, from IMDB). The lead's sidekick is utterly grating, but in no good or clever way; his love interest kinda cute, but around 30 too.

It's apparently meant to be a comedy. However, the humor is like an 80's middle-schooler's idea of something funny; the jokes revolve around people being fat and ugly, or having a harelip, and such. The only humorous moment is when they appear to justify the idiotic flesh-eating epidemic killing within 2 hours of infection (based on the prom sequence) as Necrotic Fascitiis. This disease kills considerably slower and is treatable...but the CDC comes to exterminate everyone. I mean, wtf, seriously? The gore is bad, and consists mostly of people vomiting blood into each other's faces (really).

The writer/director disavowed the movie, and unsuccessfully tried to have his name removed from it. If you dare watch it, you'll understand why.",1501027200,,1655,4.924731182795699
8384227,3,B002YI9304,"So this is nothing like the first film; it would have been better to have called it something original (Bloody Prom Night?). It wasn't directed by Roth, so if you're expecting a real sequel to the original you will be disappointed. This is more in the gore-comedy range, like ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil."" It's not nearly as good as that film, but if you enjoyed that one, my guess is you will enjoy this one. Giuseppe Andrews does reprise his role, however, and is good. Lots of gory scenes, such as (spoilers!) a kid pulls off and then superglues back on his fingernail, lots of people projectile vomiting into each other's mouths, and there is an amputation that is then cauterized with a blow torch. So if you're not into gory effects, then skip this one. Otherwise, it's a pretty entertaining entry into the gore-comedy genre, sort of an Evil Dead meets Carrie meets Heathers where everyone catches a deadly skin virus. I personally thought the opening and ending animation sequences undercut the rest of the film, and it has a sequel bait ending that feels unsatisfying: it doesn't end this story but just potentially sets up another sequel where the skin virus travels farther afield. So I'd give it three stars: the gore sequences are good, and it's a pretty funny satirization of high school, but it would have been better if it had a real ending.",1499558400,,1354,4.669456066945607
