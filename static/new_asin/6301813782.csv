7815780,3,6301813782,"Rich girl goes to work in a shelter for homeless girls. She faces resistance from all around her and becomes too emotionally involved with the girls. This is a well-intentioned film, and Masterson is usually a solid actress, but she's not at her best here. The movie is clichd  and boring.",1489190400,,289,4.666666666666667

7815783,5,6301813782,"Mary Stuart Masterson is her ever-feisty self in this very early film of her career. The story of an idealistic, upper middle class girl trying to do some good in the world and finding the obstacles of the hard, cruel world ... well sometimes not so hard and sometimes not so cruel, but bad enough if you are young, female and especially, black. Inescapable intrusions into your personal life, something so outrageous if you were an ordinary white girl living an ordinary American life, that its good to be shown how bad it can be for those without respect, voice or status. A young James Earl Jones with his wonderful voice makes a believable bureaucrat caught between the two worlds of the welfare system in a white dominated America and a truly sympathetic attempt to help young, (mostly) black girls.",1297468800,,804,4.75
