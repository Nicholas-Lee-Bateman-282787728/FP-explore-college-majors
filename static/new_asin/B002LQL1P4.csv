3948837,5,B002LQL1P4,"Christians previously tested in life trials, face more in this film. More of an honest look at life, bad with some good, like golf shots. Faith based filming has developed well over the years and director/lead actor Mike Norris takes ""birdie & bogey"" into the upper realm of contemporary religious film storytelling. He keeps preaching to low-key but the message is there. So is the golf.

Birdie (Amanda Alch) is a teen girl who's already winning in golf locally. She learned from her golf-pro, ex-tour, dad Danny (Mike Norris-yes, son of Chuck Norris who executive produced here) who messed up years ago and his nickname changed from The Eagle to Bogey. It happens (Tiger). Birdie gets her dad into a local tournament by betting him and beating him on the course. Of course that develops into another attempt at playing the professional game, with Birdie as his caddy. OK, that's probably not realistic, but it's cute, and Birdie is contagiously enthusiastic which rubs off on the viewer. In the background is friend Amy, (Janine Turner-`Northern Exposure') who cautiously takes the place of Birdie's deserted real mom.

The golf gets good, wins mount, then disaster...Birdie gets sick. Cancer. Birdies desire is her dad keep playing through her treatments, with his old caddy Lester (Carey Scott). He's turned clergy offering some humorous lines like, ""My boss is into miracles."" Without spoiling the movie for you just let me say that birdie & bogey take you on emotional uppers and downers before a satisfying climax.

There is more than just a father/child relationship presented here. And although you spend a lot of time on Texas golf greens, it's not all golf either. A solid award winning, Dove Approved, PureFlix story.",1325980800,6,1730,5.020905923344948
3948838,5,B002LQL1P4,Even though he wasn't in it Chuck Norris was involved with this movie.  His son started in it.  Janine Turner and she also was in the movie with Sheree North.  Sweet movie about a girl and her father and her love for him and the game of golf.  can't go wrong with this movie if you are looking for something to watch.,1319414400,2,317,4.064516129032258

3948843,1,B002LQL1P4,I am so sorry to have to say this but this movie was excruciating to watch. I could not get past the terrible acting to find anything enjoyable or endearing about this movie. The movie actually froze about 1/3 of the way through and I could not fix it so it had to go back.,1376179200,,273,3.981818181818182
3948844,2,B002LQL1P4,"I have sat through a lot of not so good movies, and this one makes most made for TV movies a home run in comparison.  Although it had a tear jerker for a plot it was slow, payoff wasn't there, pretty predictable.  Acting was way below par, seemed forced and unbelievable. Sorry Chuck.",1375660800,,284,4.339622641509434
3948845,2,B002LQL1P4,"I looked at quite a few reviews before purchasing this DVD they were all mixed so, I figured people have their own opinion maybe they're wrong. I've watched many Christian movies and they don't have the best acting sometimes, the quality isn't so good either but, I figured if that's the case I can get past that hey they're Christian movies. The acting in this movie was terrible it wasn't even sub-par it was almost unbelievable at times. I couldn't even finish the entire movie my wife even thought it was bad. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to waste your  and ignore the reviews like I did. Take heed to the reviews and don't purchase this film.",1373587200,,676,4.540983606557377

3948848,5,B002LQL1P4,"I was so touched by the acting in this movie. This is a heartwarming story of a father raising his daughter alone. Father and daughter have such a close relationship that it melts your heart. When adversity comes along in the form of a terminal illness, faith, hope and love triumph and cause a surprise happy ending. You will love, love, love this movie. The actors are all top notch. Love Janine Turner, Mike Norris and Amanda Alch.

If you love the sport of golf, you will enjoy this spellbinder of how a father's love fulfills a little girl's dream. Birdie O'Conner's greatest wish is that her father regain his life's goal to go back on the PGA tour. With the encouragement of a special friend, love wins supreme. The ending will have you believing that a tiny mustard seed of faith can really move mountains!

3948849,2,B002LQL1P4,"The cinematography is good.
The film is slow moving, not well acted, and the story line is not well done.  I shut it off after about 45 minutes.
The girl cast as the daughter seems a little fake.
I don't recommend watching it.",1339804800,,226,4.255813953488372

8373231,2,B002LQL1P4,"Birdie (Amanda Alch) is a 12-year-old girl who's great at golf, but what she really want is for her father, who once almost became a pro golfer, to take up the game professionally again.

Mike Norris directed and plays the father. He's not a great actor but i did like some of the scenes between him and his daughter. I didn't find the story very interesting to begin with and after a while it became extremely overly sentimental. Way too much for my taste but other might like it better. But the story is still full of clichs and not very good.",1440374400,,545,4.3431372549019605
