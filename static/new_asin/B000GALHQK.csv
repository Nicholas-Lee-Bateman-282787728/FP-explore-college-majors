2603924,4,B000GALHQK,"""Sideline Secrets"" is a great little indie film! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the film. It is a lot of fun. What seems to start out as the all-too-familiar ""coming out of the closet"" story turns into much more than any of us would have expected. ""Sideline Secrets"" is a mystery film with a new surprise around every corner and a steamy romance story that can rival a lot of the competition. The film is low budget, but there is a lot of detail given, and all comes across very professional; especially when you take into consideration this is the first feature legnth film for In The Pink Productions!

The cast of young actors is really something special. They all carry their scenes very well. The two main characters, Devon and Brian, have a chemistry together that is perfect. I am sure both actors will easily go onto bigger films in the future. Supporting roles by Summer Smith and Sarah Kelly are great as well. Their characters are complete opposites and clash to much comic relief... In addition, the Drag Queen, played by Brandon Alexander is hilarious as well!

A lot of focus has been giving to the erotic content of the film. And, I must agree with the majority of reviews I have seen on the film-- these scenes are HOT!!!! WOW WOW WOW!!! Seriously HOT.

While so many gay-themed films coming out seem stale and a complete xerox of one another, ""Sideline Secrets"" stands out all on its own. This is a truly original film with hot actors, steamy romance, campy humor, dark and twisted mystery and more-- all a perfect combination for a playful movie night with the boys!!!

Loved it!",1150848000,5,1615,4.597222222222222

Jayson wrote on 08/14/2006:

I kept seeing this movie listed on the bestseller charts for the past two months. It has stayed steady between #2 and #4 and in time, my curiosity was struck pretty heavily. So, without anymore hesitation, I placed an order and waited for the ""secret"" to arrive on my doorstep. It did not take long before I discovered why it has been a bestseller-- its actually good enough to merit such. The movie starts out like something we have seen time and time again but just as you think you have things pinned down-- Wrong. The secret to this film is its true originality. Very well-done from start to finish. This is like a Disney Mystery Movie turned naughty. So much fun. Story/Writing: B+ Acting/Characters: B Film Direction, Editing, etc: A Soundtrack: B- Overall: B I think I know what to get some of my friends for Christmas this year. Such a guilty pleasure in every way. THUMBS UP!!!!

""3 1/2 stars""--  too awesome

Eric Joseph wrote on 08/13/2006:

For a movie with little budget, this film is awesome! From the very first scene, I was hooked. Not only is it full of total hotties (most appearring in the movie naked at least once!), but the story is great. Everytime I thought I had someone/something figured out, another loop was thrown into the path of things. Moer gay movies need to be like this-- erotic but with a solid story and good talent. Mind, while all the young actors were terrific, some of the adult actors playing parents and stuff came across a little forced. But, easily putting that aside, overall loved the movie so much!

Cute film with a dark side. Made me smile all the way through. Some very nice storytelling here along with very likeable characters for the most part. The relationship at the core of the story with Devon and Brian is very nice. I enjoyed seeing it start from awkward tension and grow into much more by the end. Some of the supporting characters are terrific and do deserve larger roles in any upcoming projects they may be a part of. To add to it all, the erotic aspect of the film is very pleasing. It is so great to see a gay film with erotic content done in a tasteful way. I enjoy how it shows you a lot sexually, but at the same time leaves that much more to the imagination. Definetely hotter than a lot of previous films of its kind. I am so glad I added this film to my library.

""Want the soundtrack! Twisted""

Totally original and twisted movie so much different than what I expected. Very cool to see so many storylines intersecting. No one is quite who they seem to be by the end of the film. The bad guy is such a SLEAZE. Great job!!! You go on a journey with every character as the mysteries are revealed. I totally love the soundtrack. If there is a way to get the cd I would love to. This is a very fun movie to share with friends.

CourtMonster wrote:

Putting it plain and simple-- by the end of this movie, I needed a big bottle of lotion and an empty room! The countless eye-candy in the movie can be blamed for that! This is how I like my movies. Sideline Secrets is the perfect blend of eroticism, twists and more. If you like erotic films that push the boundaries with their sex scenes but still come across very tasteful, this is one to get. It is not porn (which is a very good thing), so don't be mistaken if that is your cup of tea. The teenage characters all feel very real. Devon's confusion, depression, timidness to accept happiness is all legit. He is the persona of what a lot of young kids, coming out with their sexuality, not in the best atmosphere, experience. The characters' emotions and personalities are all accurate and feel real because of it. I for one would love to see a sequel. I think there is a lot of story we don't know yet as a viewer. Yes-- why is Devon's mom eastern european? Does the villian come back? Is there more to Nicole and Andrew that we don't know about yet? What truly happens with Devon and Brian's romance? I like to think they are all questions that are left open for a sequel! Turn off the lights, grab a pillow and enjoy. You won't be disappointed. Oh-- and its always good to have that big bottle of lotion and an empty room available in case anything ""comes up""!!!

""Cool Combination""

I liked this movie a lot. My favorite scenes were the ones between Devon and Brian at home. It is a cute romance movie but also a mystery/thriller. It was cool how the two were combined. Not too crazy about the actors playing the parents, but the younger actors playing the teenagers all do good. I think the ending wraps things up a bit too quick... would have been cool to see more thrills at the end. But, it all works well. I recommend it to everyone to see at least once.

A must see!!!

I think a lot of people might say this is a bad movie, but knowing this is a low budget film and having limited resources, this movie is pretty good. I got this video yesterday, and I have watched it 4 or 5 times in 2 days. Obviously something in this movie got my attention, and no, it was not the sex scenes or nudity. It definitely has a good story, so I am totally recommending seeing it at least once. You just have to take into account that this movie doesn't have the budget or resources of a blockbuster movie.

I think I was drooling from start to finish with this movie. The story is kind of dark and twisted but it is presented light. It kind of reminded me of a teen disney movie turned very naughty. I liked that! The boys are all really hot. There is a big variety of guys.. you have your twinks, jock, college guy, etc. There is something for everyone. I like how the nudity and sex scenes all have a strong purpose in the film. They all go with the story unlike a lot of other movies in this genre that just like to toss in some bad nudity/sec to make up for an even worse story. I can name a lot of those. Sideline Secrets is way above this. There is A LOT of nudity in this movie, but it all fits perfectly. *drool*. The filmmakers know what they are doing here and have made a really fun and well-done movie. I want seconds of this! Overall Grade: A.

SublimeMediaMan wrote:

SIDELINE SECRETS is a lighthearted mystery/romance that knows, for its own good, not to take itself too seriously! Poking fun at itself, in good manner, with dialogue such as ""and how come we never get to see the guy's dick?!"" then cutting to a full frontal shower shot.... venturing into campy Nancy Drew type mystery and much more, it is a very entertaining piece of work. The young actors all have something great going for them! James Townsend comes across very natural as the innocent high schooler struggling with realizations of himself. Brandon Alexander is hysterical as the drag queen. Summer Smith steals every scene, as the comedic and very ""open"" lesbian friend... Sarah Kelly has a presence about her that makes you want to have her as your best fag-hag! She is beyond sweet and possesses something many young hollywood actresses lack. Reading reviews on other sites, some people have made comment of certain adult characters being a little weak. But, I have to disagree, the film isn't necessarily about the adults, but moreso about how the teens view their changing world, and react to the pressures thrown against them. The adults may seem a little distant, out of character, but it works for me! The films does its best with what it has to work with. Obviously the budget was very low, but in many scenes, you would have no clue of such. The film is done very professionally with a lot of attention to detail. Pay close attention to a pink squirrel that pops up in unexpected places, the pink color schemes to much of the film, etc. I have a feeling that in the years to come, In The Pink Productions will be a studio to keep a very close eye on. They will be doing some great stuff once they have the resources to do so... As for the erotic content in the film... simply stated-- HOT HOT HOT!!! You may have some trouble containing yourself...

""Great fun and cute bodies""

A very pleasant surprise! Although not perfect, the film, coming from the small budget it does, and managing to make use of everything in a very collaborative effort, is great fun! ""Sideline Secrets"" is one of those wonderful films you can toss on in the company of a bunch of friends and just have fun with. It has been awhile since I have enjoyed a film of such level in such a long time. I very much enjoyed everything about it. What starts out as a sweet coming-of-age tale of the adorable Devon (James Townsend) coming to terms with his sexuality amongst the pressures of his girlfriend (Sarah Kelly) and high school, soon takes a turn into being a campy mystery that keeps you guessing till the end. No one is really quite who they seem-- as each character possesses some secret of their own, one way or another. The challenge of keeping the film light, yet dealing with such dark subject matter is handled with much intellect. For, the film is full of wonderful comedic and romantic moments. Yet, it also deals with serious issues such as rape, molestation, sexual abuse and more. You find yourself falling in love with the characters... feeling their happiness, sadness and fears. The young cast is terrific! I can easily see a number of the actors (both male and female) moving on to much larger films in the future. This film does indeed possess much talent. The chemistry between the characters of Devon (Townsend) and Brian (Alex Wilson) is terrific as you watch their relationship grow from awkward nervousness, to first-love romance. Perfect pair! On another level, the film does contain quite a bit of nudity. It is all very well done and is not afraid to explore the issue. Some of the nudity/sexual situations are erotic, downright HOT!!! showing just enough, leaving much to the imagination-- very typical of scenes you would see in something like a Queer as Folk episode... while others are included to make you feel a sense of dread and discomfort for those involved-- not afraid to show it all, and in thus push forth a sense of pure reality. It works amazingly, hitting its target each time. I must say, it is nice to see strong story lines willing to cross the erotic-line without becoming full-fledged porn. We are seeing it more and more lately. So many straight-films get away with it-- take it for granted. It is time, that gay cinema gets its share as well in such a caliber as this. On a negative level, the film does suffer some sound problems-- which is typical of such low-budget films. However, it does not take away from the story at all. There may be a word here and there that doesn't exactly match up with the actors moving lips, and you may encounter the buzz of room ambiance in a scene, yet it is nothing to worry about. This too happens in many big-budget films. On another note, it would have been great to see more of a relationship between Brian and his best friend, Shawn, who pops into the movie every once in awhile. The movie is also filled with plenty of homages, tributes (whatever they may be called) to a lot of pop culture, films, icons, etc. Very nice touches that add to the fun... I definitely had to giggle in seeing that the film takes place in Ciccone, CA... (Ciccone, correct me if I am wrong-- being Madonna's last name?)... there are quite a few David Lynch references (streets, the way the nightclub is presented in subtitles in the earlier part of the film, etc), and an Adam & Eve type idea where Devon and Brian share an apple before all hell breaks loose in the story!!! All subtle touches that easily bring a smile. Overall, Sideline Secrets is great! I can't wait to get this movie and watch it with friends. So, when is the sequel?!

Very Good Sexual Identity Thriller

Art wrote:

I saw this film as screener and it was very good. The story has a number of plot twist that are unexpected which definately keeps the viewers interest. The lead character, Devon, is struggling with his sexual identity, while also dealing with a turbulant home life due to an evil step-father. Though there is plenty of nudity in this film, it is not the nudity that makes this one a stand-out effort for Director Steven Vasquez and Screenwriter James Townsend, who also plays the lead role. The storyline takes some unexpected turns, that you will have to get this one to see how Devon fairs in the end. Does he get the boy or does he fall victim to the evil around him? I give this one three and a half stars.

For low-budget indie films that's a tipoff that the filmmaker (and in this case 'filmmaker' is a very generous term) is going to try to substitute soft-core porn for any semblence of a real movie. Which is fine if that's what you want. I don't. Call me wacky but I expect more from my moviegoing experience; hmm...let's see...a plot would be nice, some continuity, some decent production values, and some acceptable acting.
I've said it before: Just because a film is low-budget doesn't mean it has to look low-budget. The wardrobe department bought most of the costumes at K-Mart on a 15% employee discount and they took home an Oscar for Best Costumes!
Too bad there isn't an Oscar for posing because that's all the actors in this film can do.

2603954,2,B000GALHQK,"Steven Vasquez directed and co-wrote with James Townsend, the star, this strange little drama cum horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions: make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller.  So why doesn't it work?

For starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather aimlessly throughout the film, dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting sidetracked into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters.  Not that that is a bad thing: it can certainly enhance some films that have been Hollywood successes.  The film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women, relationships, disturbed parenting, the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events - and murder.  It is all a bit much to cram into a 96-minute film.

Devon (James Townsend) by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend Jenna (Sarah Kelly) but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets Brian (Alex Wilson) who has been down the same path and can offer Devon assistance on every level.  They bond, Devon comes out, and the mysteries begin: boys are missing in the neighborhood, Devon's stepfather psychologist Dr. Kirk Tyler (Dan Swett) is not at all what he appears to be and despite Devon's consoling mother Donna (Sonja Fisher) Devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship.  It seems Dr Tyler is in a dark business with hunky Detective Cunningham (Earl McDougle) who apparently is investigating the missing boys...  Devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend Jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of Dr. Tyler and his detective sidekick.  And through it all Donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy, etc.

Some of the actors are pleasing to the eye (and there is very little the eye doesn't examine frequently!) but the degree of acting is at an all time low.  The only thing that makes us forgive that (and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive) is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved.  Yes, this is a low budget movie and yes, the director needs time to learn his trade.  But in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level.  Maybe their next one will be more polished.

I've seen better high school and community theater productions! The acting--particulary the mother and step-father sounded as though it was being read for the very first time.

With the right cast, the script might have had half a chance, but even that's questionable with same old tired gay cliches and predictable stereotypes.",1161993600,7,516,5.130952380952381
2603960,1,B000GALHQK,"I am not sure what the filmmakers of this train wreck were striving for when they made this low budget movie. I think the film is nothing more than an excuse to film young male actors nude. The film wants to be something it is not--it wants to be a mystery film when in reality it is a no-class softcore porn flick. To call this movie cinema is an insult to filmmakers and to viewers fooled into watching it!

  Needless to say I think this film has few, if any, redeeming features. Where to begin? The plot is weak asking us to believe in characters doing things that no one with one ounce of logic would do (for example, the mother leaves home for a few days to visit an aunt knowing her husband recently slugged her son in the face without provocation).

  I did not believe for one single moment any of the situations that were happening. The acting? Hmmm. Okay, I'll give the two young male leads some credit here. They made the best of a bad situation. In fact, most of the the young actors were passable (just passable), however, the adults are another story entirely. I would venture the entire movie's dialogue, especially the well-intentioned actress playing ""Devon's"" mother, was looped. The voices don't sound right. The acting ability of the actor portraying the step-father was about as subtle as the smell of a fertilizer plant... i.e., he reeked!

  This movie has cardboard characters possessing no real sense of believability. For those who claim this movie is camp is doing that genre a disservice. I read a few reviews that complained that the young male actors weren't hot enough-- what a ridiculous notion! Those comments miss the point of this film entirely. This was not supposed to be a story about hot men, but about teen exploitation. In effect, what this story tries to warn the viewer against is exactly what the film becomes. The actors were used and used badly by this film's production team.

  I lay the blame entirely at the feet of the producer, the writer and director. This amatuer drivel is the worst kind of schlock available to buyers. I could go on and on about how bad this movie truly is. As a writer I can say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Save your money. There are pleny of other gay-themeed films that are worthy of your money and your time. It is not often a film makes me so angry. Stay away from this one!",1161302400,8,2374,4.482598607888631
2603961,2,B000GALHQK,"I understand the low budget...stuff like that happens, but the voices didn't match. The mothers voice didn't seem real at all. It sounded like it was from a child. No way would an older woman's voice sounds like that. I like it how Devon's character has to understand his new and emerging feelings, and realize that he's not the only one that feels that way. It's nice to know that his soon to be ex-girlfriend is the understanding type. She's even involved in the end when it comes to uncovering the truth about Devon's step-dad. That's a true friend.

I felt so bad seeing Brian in such a bad shape when Devon rescued him after he was beaten up. I was gonna cry. He said that he was raped and that's just one topic that always gets me. My heart just goes out to the victim. I'm glad that earlier in the movie he becomes willing to share his feelings more with Devon, and actually calls him back after they get into their first fight. Brian cried once he hung up the phone and that always shows a more sensitive part of the man and that's such a turn on for me.

Good movie...I've seen better when it comes to acting, but it was still good. I'm glad that I bought it, but would've liked to have seen more of the Devon and Brian relationship. Oh well. Good job. B-",1159228800,5,1264,4.2625
2603962,1,B000GALHQK,"uhmm....yah... this is a low budget ""film"", but low budget doesnt mean it has to suck.  i've seen tons of low budget films that were absolutely beautiful pieces of art.  it's impossible to even figure out where to start in reviewing Sideline Secrets; for even untrained actors this is bad, it seemed that the voices were completely dubbed like in an old japanese movie, and i think i even saw someone moving in the background in the supposedly tense office scene when there wasn't supposed to be someone in the backgroung.  i will give whomever a tiny bit of credit though for turning a livingroom & a garage into what was supposed to be a club - and at the end of the home movie, i was pleasantly surprised to see the gogo dancer was actually attractive (quite so too!) as opposed to the rest of the young cast in this trying ever-so-hard to be a soft-core porn\thriller.  in all seriousness, this thing gave me a horrible migraine.  if you are stupid enough to actually buy this (thankfully my roommate rented it) invest in either a bottle of Advil or a sledge hammer - you'll want to use both on your head after the first 20 mins....",1157328000,10,1136,4.468599033816425
2603963,3,B000GALHQK,"I think a lot of people might say this is a bad movie, but knowing this is a low budget film and having limited resources, this movie is pretty good. I got this video a few days ago, and I have watched it 4 or 5 times in 2 days a;ready. Obviously something in this movie got my attention, and no, it was not the sex scenes or nudity although they were pretty well done. The film definitely has a good story, so I am totally recommending seeing it at least once. You just have to take into account that this movie doesn't have the budget or resources of a blockbuster movie. A lot of people are pretty incompetant when it comes to watching smaller low-budget films. They don't see some huge explosions or special effects and they automatically label a film as being boring, or terrible. Don't fall for that. This is a nice endeavor with a lot of potential. See if you can find the hidden references to several pop culture itesm-- madonna, twin peaks, cher, gilmore girls, and more. Very cute and well done.",1152748800,13,1005,4.379679144385027

I can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film!  The guys are not hot...not even lukewarm for that matter.  The acting is terrible.  Please...anyone who had anything to do with this, don't continue in the film industry.  If it was possible to assign negative stars, I would do so for this awful experience.

Putting it on, I was quickly thinking it would be yet again the same coming of age story we have seen a dozen times. Boy was I wrong. It quickly turns into a mystery movie with a lot of plot twists. The film isn't award winning caliber by far, however it does nicely for a night in front of the tv with a blanket and a bowl of popcorn.

It was somewhat suspenseful, leaving you guessing who the villain is until the end. Not the greatest movie in the world, but there are so few gay films in the Thriller & Suspense genre.

8130077,1,B000GALHQK,"Unbelievably inept erotic thriller which is neither erotic nor thrilling.  Everything about ""Sideline Secrets"" is bad.  Bad lighting, bad photography, bad sound.  The dialogue is terrible, the plot incomprehensible.  (It has something to do with missing boys, dysfunctional families, crooked cops, infidelity, alcoholism, coming out, and a bunch of other things.)  But the worst aspect of all is the acting.  This is one of those movies that is painful to watch.  It is embarrassing to see these amateurs attempting to act.  What were they thinking of?  What was the director thinking of?

Apparently ""Sideline Secrets"" is so popular that there is a ""director's cut"" version of this thing.  I can't even begin to imagine what the deleted scenes were like.

I won't say ""Sideline Secrets"" is the worst movie ever made.  I haven't seen them all. I won't even say it's the worst movie I have ever seen.  I'm sure there are one or two cinematic stinkers I have mercifully forgotten.  What I can say is it is the worst movie I have seen in a long, long time.

8130078,2,B000GALHQK,"I'm not sure this qualifies as the worst piece of rubbish I've ever seen, but it has to be in the top five. Even judging by the worst porn industry standards, this is a crappy film. It's like a bad porn, without the sex.

There's a formula for this sort of mess. Start with a cast of nondescript to unattractive boys that can't act their way out of a paper bag. Add about three mature actors that obviously never got hired for anything in Hollywood that got them closer than a half mile from a camera. Mix them in a large, tired plot. And sprinkle with lousy music. Then tie your audience down for an hour or so of torture. Even for soft porn, this was disappointing. And generally speaking, I can manage to enjoy a little soft porn, no matter how bad the plot or the acting. Maybe that's because even the worst soft porn films find cute actors to take your mind off the sex you won't be seeing. You feel like you get a little eye candy. Something pleasing to watch. These guys were NOT CUTE, and there was nothing pleasing about ""Sideline Secrets"".

Avoid this film at any cost. If there was a shred of conscience in the heart of the director, he'd refund the purchase price to every buyer.",1265241600,2,1191,4.3125
