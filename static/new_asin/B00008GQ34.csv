1846362,5,B00008GQ34,"The sequel to Disney's family favorite, ""Old Yeller"" and every bit as good.  Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran reprise their roles as frontier brothers, Travis and Arliss Coates.  Both mother and father (originally played by Fess Parker and Dorothy McGuire in ""Old Yeller"") are away visiting McGuire's sick mother and have left oldest son, Travis in charge of things.  Travis and Arliss are once again at odds with the old issue ""who's in charge?"" with Travis trying to get the work done and Arliss wanting to go off hunting with Savage Sam.  Brian Keith plays the uncle who comes by to check on how the boys are doing and gives advice to Travis on how to handle Arliss a little better.  During the story, Travis, Arliss, and their neighbor's daughter, Lisbeth are taken by Indians.  Brian Keith gathers up some neighboring men to go in search of them, which include Lisbeth's father, Bud Searcy (once again played comically well by Jeff York) and Slim Pickens joins the group for a well rounded western adventure.  The dvd plays with a clean transfer and good sound.  I've not seen the newly released ""Old Yeller 2 movie-collection"" including ""Savage Sam,"" but I don't think it features ""Savage Sam"" in the widescreen format either.  I highly recommend ""Savage Sam"" as well as it's predecessor, ""Old Yeller.""  These films will never lose their power to entertain and their appeal and charm are timeless.

**UPDATE!**  ""Savage Sam"" and ""Old Yeller"" are now avaialble on one DVD disc in Disney's ""Old Yeller & Savage Sam - Two Movie Collection."" And for a ""nice price,"" too!",1142899200,19,1569,4.813432835820896
1846363,5,B00008GQ34,"One of the hardest OOP Disney movies to find in the white clamshell.

This movie is very nicely done. A sequel to the well known classic Old Yeller. If you liked Old Yeller, you'll for sure like Savage Sam. It's a story about Old Yeller's pup, Sam.

Has most of the original cast from the first movie. If you are lucky enough to get a hold of this very RARE movie, you've really got something. A must have for the serious Disney Collector.",1134691200,4,439,4.27710843373494
1846364,1,B00008GQ34,"This movie is absolutely racist. I can't believe reviewers do not point this out. How many times are the Natives called ""Injuns"" or ""Savages""? The Indians whoop, they holler, they steal, and they hurt dogs for nothing other than fun. Right.

When someone in the movie points out that the whites have taken over the land and the Indians...oops...I'm sorry ""Injuns"" feel threatened...he is told that it is okay to hate Injuns because they scalped some guy's family.

The stereotypical depictions are absolutely despicable. This is why kids always made fun of me (A Native American) when I was in school. Where is my Disney movie depicting my great-great-great-great grandfather Chief White Antelope getting scalped by the white guys? (Note: That is a historical event actually based in fact, unlike the tales in this movie.)

This movie is recommended only to persons wishing their children to hate Indians and join the Aryan Nation. I couldn't believe what I was watching. I'm saddened that others have not pointed this out. Are you all really that blind?",1111968000,10,1054,5.011428571428572
1846365,4,B00008GQ34,"I bought this movie today & I think it has some good things & some bad things about it.well we'll start with the good things. It has Travis & Little Arliss back in it & they're great characters! It also has Brian Keith playing their uncle,which is a really good actor. But here are the dissapoinments:in the first one,Sam looks like Old Yeller,in this one Sam looks like a coonhound. Next,the mom & dad aren't in it,& lastly Lizbeth has another actress playing her,who doesn't compare to the original. But overall this is a good sequel. I think it's made for t.v. Anyone who enjoyed the first will LIKE this one.",1100908800,4,612,4.5225225225225225
1846366,5,B00008GQ34,"I first caught this movie on the television and had no idea there was a sequel to Old Yeller. Although I haven't yet figured out how he turned out to be a blue tick coonhound, it is a wonderful movie. Seeing the boys from Old Yeller back at it and into things is wonderful. I couldn't wait to add it to my collection and was tickled that it was already on DVD when I looked for it. We need more movies like this! It is full of adventure and if you own coonhounds, it does them justice. I hate to say much about the movie because you need to watch it and I hate to know the ending or too much about one when I get one, but the saying boys will be boys is true for Arlis. There is nothing like the love of a child and his dog!!",1077753600,17,725,3.84
1846367,4,B00008GQ34,"Disney's ""Savage Sam"" is an entertaining and authentically staged presentation of the Fred Gipson story. It's presented in square-screen format, but since Disney films of this type were produced with eventual TV airings in mind, the cropping of the image is minimal and no action is lost. The quality of the image is good. It's not a ""Vault Disney"" piece like the other Gipson story, ""Old Yeller,"" but it's worth having even without bells and whistles.
One thing that didn't age as well as the rest of the film is the title song. Really hokey. But after that's over, the story is told in a no-nonsense style. It dramatizes something Texas settlers contended with for four decades: the abduction of children in an Indian raid.
As befits a family film, ""Savage Sam"" soft-pedals the realities of such raids. Tommy Kirk's character, a teenage boy, would have been treated more harshly. Torture on the trail and a horrendous death upon arrival at the tribe's base camp would have been his fate. The teenage girl would have been raped right off. But Kevin Corcoran's character, a young child, would have been taken for adoption, just as the film shows, and the Indians' good-humored toleration of his combativeness is right in line with that.
All in all, a serious depiction of a slice of history that few Americans learn about in school anymore.",1055548800,31,1340,4.8304347826086955

Everything that was charming and wholesome about Old Yeller was mostly lost in this movie.  What you're left with is two brothers who spend most their time complaining about chores and bickering at each other.  I really wanted to like this movie, but I don't.  If you're expecting this movie to be anything like Old Yeller I wouldn't waster your time or money.  Perhaps I was expecting too much.",1449100800,,527,4.736263736263736

1846379,5,B00008GQ34,"Remember  the  pup  at  the  end  of  the  movie  old Yeller?  Sam  is  supposed  to  be  that  pup.  Watching  this  movie  for  the  first  time  I  was  surprised  that  they  wouldn't  use  a  same  breed  of  dog  as  yeller  for  Sam,  cause  that's  what  the  pup  was.  If  any  of  you  have  ever  watched  (Homeward Bound 2)  get  a  good  look  at  the  dog  called  Bando.  I  do  believe  Sam  &  Bando  are  the  same  breed.  Both  hound  dogs.  Travis  (Tommy Kirk)  I  think  was  either  20  or  21  yrs  of  age  in  this  movie.
Anyways  what  happens  is  Sam  loves  trailing  Jack Rabbits  or  foxes  &  cougars  &  squaring  off  in  a  one  on  one  duel.  Arliss  &  Travis  are  the  same  as  always  never  getting  along. Travis  prefers  to  stick  with  the  work,  But  Arliss  takes  a  liking  to  just  being  young  &  doing  everything  boys  his  age  do.  Not much  on  responsibility  or  nothing.  (Brian Keith)  is  uncle Beck  in  the  movie  &  does  a  better  job  of  getting  Arliss  back  under  control  after  he  corners  his  brother  in  the  outhouse.  If  it  had  been  me  I  wouldn't  have  stayed  in  the  outhouse  like  a  coward  I  would  have  gotten  me  a  stick  &  whipped  Arliss.  That's  the  right  way  to  handle  it  though  the  way  uncle Beck  handled  it.  Getting  to  Arlisses  soft  &  tender  side.  That's  what  I  found  funny  in  the  movie.  So  they  get  back  to  their  original  route  grubbing  brush.  Arliss  takes  off  him  &  Sam  &  Jumper.  Bud Searcy  &  Elizabeth  show  up,  Travis  &  Elizabeth  go  after  Arliss,  Elizabeth  went  along  for  the  love  of  the  ride  &  to  see  the  bobcat.  This  I  think  was  either  filmed  in  west  Texas  north  of  Alpine  or  in  New Mexico  somewhere.  I'm  not  sure  exactly.  But  that  would  be  my  guess.
Soon  they're  captured  by  Indians.  Although  uncle Beck shows  up  &  fires  some  shots  from  a  cliff,  I  don't  think  he  was  aware  of  what  was  really  going  on,  not  until  he  returned  to  the  house.  All  Beck  did  was  fire  some  shots  trying  to  scare  the  Indians  away,  because  they  were  a  little  too  close  to  the  house.  Also  to  reassure  the  safety  for  his  family  members.  He  wasn't  yet  aware  of  Travis, Elizabeth,  &  Arliss  getting  kidnaped.  Sam  did  get  knocked  out  by  one  of  the  Indians.  But  got  on  their  trail  on  his  own  after  regaining  consciousness.  Travis  is  the  only  one  who  seems  confident  that  they  can  get  away.  They  almost  did.  Then  the  Indians  get  chased  by  soldiers,  &  turn  Travis  loose.  Travis  isn't  able  to  get  their  attention  to  point  out  the  situation  to  them.  He  finds  Sam,  then  after  a  while  uncle Beck  shows  up,  he'd  gotten  6  other  guys  together  or  so.  But  they  must  catch  Sam.  Sam  had  gotten  injured  by  wolves  &  was  wounded.  Getting  Arliss  &  Elizabeth  back  meant  as  much  to  Sam  as  it  did  to  any  of  them.  &  he  does  pick  up  the  trail  once  he's  able  to  run.  &  they  close  in  on  the  Indians  for  the  battle.  This  one  does  have  the  adventure  in  it,  &  I  liked  some  of  the  other  cowboys  in  the  movie,  Walley Crup  (Slim Pickkens)  &  Pack Underwood  (Royal Dano).  How  long  after  Old Yeller  was  this  movie  made?  I'm  thinking  5  or  6  years.  Beck  did  good  being  the  leader  of  the  group.  I  liked  how  he  handled  authority.  The  others  were  kind  of  silly,  one  was  just  kind  of  clumsy  &  funny, &  another  real  hateful, &  one  who  wasn't  good  at  listening.  It  appeared  each  of  them  had  a  different  reason  for  going  after  the  Indians.  But  most  of  all  for  Arliss  &  Elizabeth.  Then  they  catch  up  with  them,  &  fight  off  the  majority  of  them.
I'm  not  sure  exactly  just  how  far  away  from  home  Travis  &  Arliss  were.  I  think  probably  around  100  miles  or  so,  something  like  that.
This  is  a  good  movie  for  adults  &  children.  It  has  the  action  &  adventure.  In  one  part  of  the  movie  Beck  tells  White  a  short  story  about  Pack  underwood  losing  his  family  to  the  Indians.  That's  a  sad  story.
Not  like  most  westerns  where  you  see  wagons  &  stuff.  But  definitely  a  very  very  good  movie!!!!!!",1437523200,,4423,4.167590027700831

1846429,3,B00008GQ34,"Savage Sam was released in the United States on June 1, 1963 starring Brian Keith, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran. Savage Sam is the 1963 film sequel to Old Yeller written by Fred Gipson. It was inspired by the story of former Apache captive Herman Lehmann, whom Gipson had seen give an exhibition when he was a child. Norman Tokar directed the live-action film, which was released by Walt Disney on June 1, 1963.

Summary: The picture opens with Arliss coming outside and spotting his dog Sam chasing a bobcat. Now both of Arliss parents are back East attending to their Grandma leaving Travis in charge. As in Old Yeller, Travis and Arliss are at war as Travis tries to get Arliss to get some work done. Arliss wants to go hunting with his dog Sam and Travis won't let him. Therefore, Arliss who can't shoot a gun but can really throw rocks starts to throw them at Travis. Arliss has Travis pend down in the family out house when a man on a horse rides into the farm. The man turns out to be the boy's Uncle Buck. Uncle Buck tells Arliss that his daddy use to do the same thing to him when they were young, bossing him around telling him to do this and that. Travis and Arliss are out in the fields working when Sam gets into a fight with a bobcat and Arliss takes Jumper the mule and takes off chasing them. Travis goes back to the family farm where he finds Bud Searcy and his daughter Lisbeth riding telling Travis that there are Indians in the area. Bud goes into the house to eat while Travis and Lisbeth get on a horse looking for Arliss and Jumper. Travis goes up into the mountains with Lisbeth on the horse when they hear a ruckus going on. Travis gets down investigating only to find Arliss and Sam in a hole fighting the bobcat. Travis pulls Arliss out and just then, some wild horses and Indians going riding pass them.

Questions: Is what Travis saw real Indians? Did the Indians take Travis, Lisbeth, and Arliss? If they did take them, where did they go? Does Uncle Buck find out about the boys? If so, what does Buck do about it? Does Buck ever find the boys? How does the dog Sam play into all of this?

My thoughts: The film received poor reviews and fell short of box office expectations, paling in comparison with Old Yeller. Pat Hogan appears as tribesman Broken Nose. Dean Fredericks, formerly Steve Canyon on NBC, played a Comanche chief in this film. The beginning of the movie wasn't bad if you can get through the opening song which was really bad. The character Arliss had a real mouth on that boy and if I had been his big brother, I would tan the britches of that boy. I thought the cross-country scenery the Indians took with the wild horses was great. It was nice to see some of the old timers that used to play on Gunsmoke show them acting in a movie instead of just on TV. This movie didn't have a leading lady but it wasn't boring either so I'm going to give this movie 6 weasel stars. You can find this movie on Amazon.com",1342483200,3,2958,4.326126126126126

THE STORY: The two brothers from the first cast are reunited, played by Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran. Sam is the pup of Old Yeller, and is played by a Blue Tick Coon Hound. Disney regular Brian Keith plays the part of their dad's younger brother who checks in on them and provides guidance. And the boys are once again fighting over who is the boss, right where they left off in the first movie.

The title song was released by Disney Records on a 45, ""Savage Sam And Me,"" performed by The Wellingtons, with ""Old Yeller"" on the B Side. Character actor Royal Dano appears in the movie, and was selected by Walt to record the voice of the audio-animatronic figure of President Abraham Lincoln for the ""Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln"" show at the Worlds Fair in 1964. The attraction later moved to Disneyland.

THE STORY: The two brothers from the first cast are reunited, played by Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran. Sam is the pup of Old Yeller, and is played by a Blue Tick Coon Hound.  Disney regular Brian Keith plays the part of their dad's younger brother who checks in on them and provides guidance. And the boys are once again fighting over who is the boss, right where they left off in the first movie.  Things get really scary when some local kids are kidnapped by Indians, and once again the family dog is in the middle of protecting them with his tracking and fighting skills. Slim Pickens appears as Willy Crup, and Jeff York returns as Bud Searcy.

DVD: Image is clean, colors are good, but it is in full screen.  Sound is clean and reconfigured to Dolby Digital 5.1 surround from the original mono sound.  No extras, except for Disney commercials. Running 104 minutes, about 20 minutes longer than the first movie.

BEFORE YOU BUY: There is another DVD version of this movie that has both Old Yeller and Savage Sam in the same package.  In addition to both movies, you get five terrific extras.",1262908800,3,2217,4.564231738035264

1846434,5,B00008GQ34,"This is a great family movie, and if you liked Old Yeller, you will love this one too.  I recommend watching Old Yeller and then watching Savage Sam - the two together would make a great ""family movie night"" companion set.",1177804800,3,222,4.414634146341464
1846435,5,B00008GQ34,"Entertaining movie showing Indians (Injuns) having some fun..  We are Native American and Aztecan Indian so my daughter loved this movie.  It is for fun, not to insult anyone.  Bambie was as fake as this movie but we still like it.  This movie has so many funny moments with people and animals.  Will watch many more times.  Movie is old so no reference to cross dressing, homosexuality, or foul language like so many Disney and movies in general have today.  Not sure why Disney feels compelled to put adult humor in their movies for kids today, that to me is why they aren't making the great films of Walt's time.  Disney classics are timeless.",1173139200,10,646,4.605263157894737
