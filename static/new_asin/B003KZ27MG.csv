4134288,1,B003KZ27MG,"I have been a huge fan of the SG1 and SGA series since they began. I was really looking forward to the SGU series.  Some of the episodes seem decent. BUT (beware of the BIG BUT here) Syfy (which I still hate the name change but that is another matter) decided to take this epic series franchise in a different direction which was to capitalize off of the Battle Star Gallactica mode of filming. They chose to take a great type of filming, which had quite a bit of comedic timing and great character building and build this into a 'serious' type of series.  While this may be fine for newcomers to the franchise this left most of the fanbase of the StarGate shows and movies left out of what we have all come to expect.

On in't own merits, SGU is somewhat decent but each episode is done so differently that they still seem to be looking for how this series is to be built.  I cannot get into any of these characters at all and was really dissapointed.  I still watch the series hoping that I will finally get it but after 2 season (I think..more on that next) I just do not get the direction that they want to take this..and after watching this I can tell they don't knwo which direction they want to take this. It seems like they are using us as a big focus group still.

As for the series 1.5 this is jsut a stupid marketing ploy for Syfy (It's really SciFi) to make some more dough by adding in some extra episodes from season 1 and what will be season 2.  I seriously hate these lame marketing ploys but this is Syfy and they really do not care about the fanbase so this is to be expected.  They did the same thing with Battle Star Gallectica so it's going to happen since they are trying to capitalize off of that (it aint working...storywise at least).

So bottom line is buy this at your own risk or do the smart thing and wait until season 2 is out so you don't waste your dough on this.

4134289,5,B003KZ27MG,"I think SGU is so much more substantial than the other Stargate franchises.  No trite dialog. More challenging circumstances.  I think the creators would have done themselves a favor if they'd left the name Stargate out of the title and used it as a small subtitle (i.e. Stargate IV - or whatever iteration this is). I'm a facebook denizen, and many of the early complaints were that the show is so little like the older Stargates.  The fans of those shows wanted more of the same, and were disappointed that this veers way off that track.  I began watching this show hoping for something totally different, and was amazed that it's what I got.  Not boring formulaic stories, interchangeable with the other shows, barring a few detail changes.  Much of what other reviewers don't like cause me to love this show.  I think it's realistic that the people on this mysterious ship would be isolated among themselves.  They weren't meant to be together on a voyage, scrabbling for their very lives. Their behavior is unpredictable and often not particularly admirable.  That's what I'd expect under those circumstances.  I find myself so involved in the story that I don't think of the cast as a group of actors, but the characters they portray.  That, to me, speaks well of the creative team's choice of people to play the diverse travelers on Destiny. As for offering another DVD of the partial season, I have mixed feelings.  If there's enough extra material to make it worthwhile, I might be tempted to buy it.  As for the show: I'm in for the duration. I'll go anywhere with Young, Scott, Greer, TJ, ""Math Boy"", et.al.",1276732800,3,1618,4.735714285714286
4134290,2,B003KZ27MG,"The other reviews cover SG:U pretty well. I should say I love the show so far. We have purchased all of SG1 and SG:A, are big Stargate fans, and want to own Universe at some point, but releasing these as half-seasons is just an annoying money grab :/",1276646400,5,250,4.229166666666667
4134291,5,B003KZ27MG,"This show is dull, a Battlestar Galactica knock-off, and poorly lit.

I love it.

Something about this space set soap opera relaxes me more than a puff of you know who.  I love that big mysterious ship, that the characters hate each other, and just the mindless wandering through space.  The Destiny is my Destiny, Friday nights that is.

4134292,5,B003KZ27MG,"Buy season 1.5, or the ""Second half"" of season 1. It is worth it. To explain, the season started off slow, then really picked up (all things considered) and left us with a ""what do they do now"" feeling (at the close) in the best SG-1 Tradition. I hope to see the series back for season 2 (the cast deserves at least that) and then maybe a season 3. After that, I think the idea pool for ""Robinson Crusoe"" on a ship will be at an end. But on to the resolution of the Lucian Alliance problem....

4134293,5,B003KZ27MG,"I have been a fan of the Stargate saga since the movie ""Stargate"" was released in theaters. Although, for me at least, it was difficult to get into the new storyline with each Stargate storyline, it was still a familiar theme. SG:U is altogether different, at least for now.

SG:1 and SG:Atlantis dealt with the stargate as the center of the storyline universe; Stargate:Universe does not. SG:U focuses more on the characters, trapped within an Ancient-designed ship and hurtling into the farthest celestial territory imaginable. This is where SG:U shines. Unlike previous storylines, they can't just step back into the stargate and return home. In fact, it is quite a challenge for the characters to just survive on this aging vessel that tries to kill its passengers with each lightyear traveled.

I don't really care why the studios want to release SG:U in half season increments. I'm just glad they do it, since I can get more episodes on my shelf to review at my leisure in a shorter amount of time.

I loved SG:U 1.0 and am eagerly awaiting the arrival of 1.5. July can't come soon enough!",1275609600,27,1095,4.783068783068783
4134294,1,B003KZ27MG,"I have all the Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis seasons on standard DVD. They upconvert to near hi-def better than any other (standard-def) series I have seen, so upgrading to higher def is not an option when they release the blu-ray seasons.

I never did understand the Battlestar Galactica versions when they started releasing them in 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, etc. What season was I getting if I purchased a ""box of versions?"" Was the box that was labeled v3.5 season 3, or was it something else?

So I never purchased any of the Battlestar Galactica ""versions"" series.

Now Stargate Universe is doing this ""version"" thing too. I do know that version 1.0 was only half a season. So is this v1.5 three-quarters of a season? Will the v2.0 release be a full season? Don't know.

BTW, we all know why the studios do this, so I don't need to go there.

I guess I am just to stupid to get it, so I will not purchase any SGU either.

When the studios get their sneaky/greedy little heads out of my assets, and release a series in boxed seasons, I will purchase them.

4134353,5,B003KZ27MG,"1.5 is the second half of the first season. I really hate how they've started doing that but in any case, everything about season one part one continues here (I guess see my review for 1.0 for full details of my opinion on that). As there, Stargate Universe split the fan base right down the middle into people who loved Stargate so hated Universe because it was too much like Battlestar Galactica, and people who hated Universe because it was too much like Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis. Having said that, there were leftovers in the middle and we loved this show. The balance of Stargate tech and complete, complex realistic characters who interact like real people, screw up, try to do right, are self-serving or just misguided was catnip. And the spectacular performances were the best part. (The totally cool ship was nice too.) Yes, the premise sounds like Star Trek Voyager, but the show itself was nothing like that. Try part one and if you like it, you'll want to see the rest. If you don't like it, don't bother with this half. It's pretty consistent all the way through.
One caveat: they're big on cliffhanger endings, especially over the season break so if you find yourself hooked on season one, try to have season two lined up before you watch the finale. PS Season 2 is not currently available on Blu-ray.

As for the Blu-ray set itself, it does include all the very many extras the DVD sets have and a few more. There are cast interviews, commentaries on every single show, specials and the entire collection of Kino Diaries that were on the net during the show's run are here.",1338681600,2,1590,4.618374558303887

However, I should have waited, because this only includes the first half of the first season- this set should really be named 0.5 instead of 1.5. ""Stargate Universe 1.5"" makes it sound like you're getting an SGU season and a little extra on the side.

Well, at least 1.5 came with a cardboard case to slot in the other disc that would complete the season. Yeah, thanks.

However, I love the show's darker spin on the Stargate franchise, and still do. Am slightly bitter that SciFi (I refuse to say SyFy) didn't give SGU a new season, although I knew the decades of Stargate had to end somewhere.",1326326400,,712,4.345864661654136

The tone is very different to the other Stargate shows, but this is no bad thing, it means SGU can be looked at as a standalone show in it's own right. Every character has shades of grey, and every one of them has their own story. They're well written and incredibly well acted, special mention has to go to Robert Carlyle - Dr. Rush can be a massively dislikable man at times, and Robert Carlyle does bring a lot of warmth and humanity to him. Similar kudos to David Blue, who plays Eli and Jamil Walker Smith, who plays Sgt Greer - woefully underused but a joy every time he's onscreen.

SGU is different from the other two series: SG-1 and SGA. There's lack of humor that I usually get in the other two shows. However, there's one thing I like about this series. The enemy doesn't only come from outside the ship, but also inside. The people involved in this drama don't like each other. I like Dr. Rush the most, he can be both a hero and a villain.

For me it's the pull of undiscovered worlds and technology as well.

My last sci-fi faves were Firefly and Farscape, and I'm pleased to find another Sci-fi series I really dig.

4134397,4,B003KZ27MG,"Once again, I admonish poeple to review the product, not the price of an object.  Several of the reviews again focus on the multipack season and the sheer cost of ownership when you want to buy  a season.  My review of the first half of the season explains why this show deserves to be given a chance.  New episodes are on my DVR and waiting to be seen, but I feel like I have finally digested this half of the season, so I haven't watched any of the new ones yet.

The second half of the first seaon is a bit of a letdown in my eyes.  In an attempt to create a bit more suspense and adventure, the producers created a couple of situations that required them to use a ""god in the machine"" approach to get out of.

Example: Dr. Rush being marooned, then magically showing up on an alien ship that is attacking destiny.  Sure, he explains how it came to pass, but things like this should not happen.

Example: Scott, Eli and Chloe's gate to gate race to find destiny.  They finally make it to Destiny thanks to a plot element that is so convenient as to be rediculous.

Secondly, the character development of the main characters seems to stall.  To be honest, I can only take so much of Eli's pining for Chloe.  Get over it.  She is out of your league.  She prefers guys who can actually SEE their penises when they pee.  Hit Destiny's gym and try again in a couple seasons dude.  Lt. scott has become a dry hole.  there is nothing more to be sifted out of his character (ditto Col. Young), and how much do you want to bet that at some point they might do a priest abuse story line with him?  Dr. Rush's moment in the sun with the flashbacks of Daniel Jackson and his wife were great, but is was the same character just in a different time period.  It would have been nice to use that for character development instead of backstory.

The cliffhanger with the Leutian Alliance finding another ""Icarus planet"" and dialing on to Destiny was another relatively crude plot twist used to create some continuity with to other series.  don't live in the shadows, SGU!  Step into the light and grow into the show we all know you can be!  There is too much potnetial in this series for clumsy, formulaic writing!",1286928000,,2200,4.322738386308068
4134398,5,B003KZ27MG,"This show started out great and it just keeps getting better and better. Robert Carlyle is stand-out in the episode ""Human"" providing arguably the best acting television has ever seen. More planets feature in this half of the scene, which is a much-needed change for both viewers and characters as the ship can be depressingly claustrophobic after a while.

I am slightly concerned about some of the plot holes that are starting to arise in the more action-centric episodes, such as ""Space,"" ""Sabotage"" and ""Incursion,"" which is in stark contrast to the first half of the season, which other than Greer's magical flamethrower, I couldn't find anything logically wrong with. However, the show is definitely exceeding the quality it already matched for itself in in the 2009/2010 season. Now, onto the episodes:

Space - Very exciting episode that kicks off a new arc. The visual effects on the aliens are stunning - which makes sense after I found out that they were done by the same people who did District 9, which also had photo realistic VFX done on the cheap. Slight logical concerns in this episode, however - why did Dunning not do anything to help Chloe being abducted when he was in the same hallway as it happened? Why did they not take him too? How did Rush and Chloe get off the ship so easily? 4/5
Divided - Very dark, tense, thrilling episode that is both stand-alone and a sequel to Space. Paul Mullie never ceases to amaze me with his writing. I love the scene at the beginning where Col. Young accuses Dr. Rush of keeping a communication stone for himself for his own purposes. Dr. Rush's response? ""Oh well."" 5/5
Faith - An outstanding episode providing lots of soft, touching moments and some humor. Stand-out is the seconds-long shot during the montage on the planet showing the team playing soccer with eachother to pass the time. Dances around religious discussions without being in-your-face or taking to one viewpoint. 6/5
Human - Overwhelmingly good acting in this episode by Robert Carlyle and Louise Lombard. The plot leaves a bit to be desired, and the acting can't make up for it entirely. The ""46"" thing in Rush's story is a little too easy, and Greer emptying half a magazine into a spider and bringing the catacomb down was way too stupid for me, bordering on plot hole. If the acting wasn't so good, I would give this a 3. 4/5
Lost - Great episode. It's nice to have some classic Stargate thrown in here every once in a while. Greer's flashbacks were enlightening, but didn't completely explain why he's so messed up. Hopefully we'll get more Greer flashbacks in the future, that might even connect with Young and Telford's past. 5/5
Sabotage - This episode was bad. In the first draft of the script for this episode, Rush had sex with Amanda Perry while she's in Wray's body, but the writers apparently pussied out. And add onto that Scott, Chloe and Eli strolling through the gate Atlantis-style... bad. So bad. 2/5
Pain - For someone who's seen SG-1 and Atlantis twice, I didn't enjoy this episode too much, plot-wise, as it's just a rehash of the classic ""characters experience hallucinations/nightmares because of an alien virus"" episode. The acting is beyond amazing, however, especially from Volker, James and Scott. Volker's claustrophobic scenes are somewhat haunting. 4/5
Subversion - My favorite this season, after time. It feels like an SG-1 crossover, with an edge. Guest starring Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks and the gorgeous Rhona Mitra (Doomsday, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans) as Kiva, commander of the Lucian Alliance. Science fiction thriller at its best. 10/5
Incursion - Action packed, dark and grim - just the way I like it. This two part finale features the Lucian Alliance boarding Destiny that starts off with a frantic shoot-out that I must say was the most intense thing I've ever seen on television. I was holding my breath the whole time because of the 18 episodes of character development that came before it. I was terrified that a character I liked was going to die. And that's why this show rocks. However, prepare yourself for a nasty cliffhanger at the end that you'll have to wait til season two to have concluded. 5/5",1286409600,3,4196,4.810249307479224

After watching the previous Stargate series, I have learned to appreciate the fast paced ""bottle"" episodic style of Stargate. But after the producers went from 10 season with Stargate: SG-1, to a seemingly quick 5 seasons of Stargate: Atlantis(SGA), I think they clearly saw that they needed to make a bold new change or the next project won't get past a single season or even a pilot episode.

It would appear that there are people who will never like Stargate: Universe! I think that's a crying shame and you're missing out bigtime! I like the fact that they take 2 or 3 episodes to resolve an issue. I adore the shooting style of the show. I love the level of detail of the sets and the characters' back stories. As was revealed in a commentary, one of the producers got a chance to visit the set of Battlestar Galactica where he found that the level of detail there was stepped up another level for shooting in HD. There is alot to love about this show and they don't give everything away in the first episode so you will need to be patient and enjoy the journey!

  I do admit that the finale of 1.0 does end with a bang though and at least did finally give me a reason to stick around.

Remember that season 1.5 comes with a cardboard housing so that you can keep both sets 1.0 and 1.5 as a season pack.

This is a fantastic show. I for one thought the franchise had met it's demise with the halfbaked straight to dvd movies. But these guys are back with Tv magic. It is truly sad that ""fans"" are willing to degrade the show by giving it 1 star reviews because you don't like the price.

Sure, it resembles Battlestar too much, but that is what the syfy channel ordered. If it weren't dark and broody with a nonstable camera it wouldn't be on tv. It's worth it however, in order to be back exploring the universe through the stargates. How happy were I when they started exploring planets again, I honestly feared they would be stuck on that ship 24/7. The stones are a great way of bringing the crew back to earth eventhough they are on the other side of the galaxy.

4134434,2,B003KZ27MG,"**Synopsis of my synopsis is below**

I've watched the entire first season and found it all to be very formulaic, soap-opera-like fare.

You could have made this show using interchangeable characters from any Showtime drama, the latest iteration of Battlestar Galactica, and a miniscule dash of SG flavor. If people think this storyline is somehow magically unique, they need to read a lot more sci fi and watch a lot more old movies.

Every episode you watch, you will know what is going to happen even before the obvious foreshadowing kicks in. I find the characters incredibly one-dimensional and boring, the sex scenes contrived, and the drama and intrigue tedious, at best. I really don't like the random pop/irish folk songs thrown in either, as the songs that are picked don't add anything to the scene, but hey, they remind me of every other drama currently available.

The direction leaves much to be desired, with the hand-cam/shaky/indie camera shakes which are incredibly distracting from scene to scene. Didn't they have money to buy a tripod on wheels, at least?

The one redeeming quality is the acting, but the writers destroy that by creating a crew that you can't like, at all. I don't want to spend an entire season hating the whole ship. I feel like they're trying way too hard with the drama, and they could have done it with a lighter touch and come up with something that was well-paced and interesting. I am waiting to get the evil twin from an alternate reality plotline...Yes, things really are that predictable.

There's a reason why people loved the SG series: they were light, interesting sci fi with humor...not some melodramatic soap opera. I have tried very hard to like SGU, and I made it through the first season. Honestly, if the ship blew up in season two and everyone died, I might be sad about Eli, as he seems to be the only one with any kind of semblance of humanity in him, kind of like this series.

** For people who just want short/angry sentences & People who think I only like humor because they can't read the entire review **

- I watched the whole season.
- This series is mediocre, at best.
- The writing is predictable, a majority of the characters are trite and unlikable.
- The direction could be done better by chimpanzees with HD handycams.
- The interjection of pop music is really disjointed.
- The sex scenes are gratuitous and not hot, at all.
- They're ripping off every plotline from every other drama out there right now/in the past.
- If a viewer is looking for some semblance of the Stargate of the past, they'll be disappointed, as all you're getting is West Wing on a ship...and it isn't even a good mimic of West Wing.
- Sometimes people die, and don't forget the gratuitous sex.
- It isn't interesting science fiction, and it isn't even interesting drama.
- I really hope they can pull it off, but so far, they're not.
- This show isn't smart or interesting or educational or intriguing, it is just boring and tedious.
- Yes, I spent however-many-hours watching the whole season because I wanted to give it a fair chance.
- At the end of the last episode I was hoping it would end in all sides destroying one another and the Destiny to be flying through space on her mission; an intergalactic graveyard full of useless characters.",1281225600,3,3298,4.635273972602739
4134435,1,B003KZ27MG,"The writers of this series are hopeless.  They expect the viewer to believe that the crew of the ship could not stop the Lusian Alliance.  They used the stargate to get onboard the Destiny and were trapped in the gateroom.  All the doors were shut.  They then give them enough time to blow the doors and get out of the corridors and gain control of the ship.  What load of rubbish.  The passage ways of the ship can be individually sealed.  Being shot at with automatic weapons down a metal corridor woud result in mass death.  This show is so unrealistic and unbelievable.  For the sake of a plot they abandom any semblance of reality.  It is totally disapponting.  I have thrown out the dvds and will not bother to watch the series.  The writer shold be sacked and give whatever money they were paid back.
I am a fan of SG1 and the other spin offs but not this poor excuse for a science fiction drama.",1281139200,6,903,4.341317365269461

just one thing : the colonel is a real stupid man, and take always bads decisions (so evidents), and some time it remember me the ""battle stars galatica"" series (i hate this series)

over wise it's a real nice series not for kids",1280966400,,395,4.549295774647887
4134437,3,B003KZ27MG,"I don't want to criticize the show merely because it isn't like the other two Stargate series. If the Stargate franchise folks wanted to take it in a new direction, then it should be judged on its own merits, not on its similarity to what came before.

With SG-U they decided to go for more serious, less camp. That's not a bad thing. There's a great deal more conflict between the ensemble cast members, too. Again, not a bad thing, necessarily. The premise of being stranded on a runaway starship -- or at least a ship the passengers do not control -- is something different. It has potential.

I have found the series watchable, but barely enough to keep me tuning in. Frankly, there aren't many characters I find likable, let alone heroic. And most shows are too much like the Bickersons in space. Crew arguing with other crew members, plotting against other crew members, manipulating other crew members, sometimes even getting violent with other crew members. This is not a happy ship! The captain is often arbitrary, capricious. The stones are interesting -- where one's mind can reach across the galaxy and inhabit another body. But then they do icky things while in another person's body. This is not exactly a family show. Also, does the lesbian angle really need to be pushed? Does that add anything to the show? It seems forced.

Really, the more I think about these characters, the less I like them. The geeky computer guy is hard to dislike. But I wish he wasn't such a doormat for the gal he's got a crush on.

The plots of the episodes can be interesting, though the ship being threatened with destruction every other week gets a little monotonous. I wish a little more thought was put into the writing. The actors are mostly great, doing their best with difficult material.

Would I watch this? Yes. Will I continue watching the second season? I'll give it a chance. Would I pay money to own it? No, one viewing is enough for me.",1280966400,6,1946,4.61271676300578
4134438,5,B003KZ27MG,"I've been a fan of the Stargate franchise since the original feature film. While I loved both SG1 & SGA, I have to admit that SGU has quickly become my favorite of all 3 Stargate series. The casting is perfect and the large ensemble cast works well together. This is a much more realistic and gritty series than its predecessors. Comparisons with the recent version of Battlestar Galactica are inevitable, but only because like BSG, the emphasis here is more on the drama of survival.

Yes, the series started out slowly, but the 3-part AIR was a perfect way to bring us into a very different Stargate world. While the first 10 episodes established that world and the personalities/relationships of the people onboard Destiny, the 2nd half of the season became a much more intense drama where traitors and heroes were revealed (sometimes they were the same person). We also saw sides drawn and allegiances formed, with people taking surprising stands. Ongoing power struggles keep shifting, with most people caught in the middle, while others aligned with whatever side could further their ambitions. The last 3 episodes brought things to a major climax that leaves us wondering whether the confrontation can bring the crew together, or shatter their fragile relationship even further.

SGU is rewarding viewing if you give it a chance. For all those negative SGU haters out there, if you don't like it, just go watch your SG1 & SGA box sets and leave SGU alone for those of us who truly appreciate it.",1280707200,4,1502,4.86328125
4134439,4,B003KZ27MG,"Although ""military sci-fi"" is my least favorite subgenre of space shows, i have loyally watched every episode of Stargate since 1997, buying seasons as they came out on disc. SGU breathes new life into a franchise that ran its logical course - any longer and it would have been like staying at a job beyond the point where you learn new things and find your job a worthwhile challenge. Atlantis was starting to get repetitive and i was basically only tuning in to experience the witty, whiny sarcasm of David Hewlett. If we were in Season 13 of SG-1, I doubt it would have anything new to give us. SGU not only displays some talent in acting, but also a few new ideas in plot that were not explored in Stargate shows previously.
To those who say it is ""untrue"" to its predecessors, I have one just word: Evolution. As a sci-fi audience, I am surprised that more people don't embrace evolution. The fact that the military doesn't succeed in ruling the miniature society aboard Destiny with Martial Law is what makes the show work. Sure, the soldiers come in handy, but most civilians don't want to live under a military dictatorship, and that comes across nicely.
While the camera work, grim atmosphere, and recipe laced with sex blatantly copies BSG, I will not hold it against the producers for trying BSG devices to make a new SG show work. Luckily they also copied BSG's inclusion of philosophical debates (whether spoken or inferred) and the grand social experiments that spring out of one of sci-fi's oldest scenarios: people being stuck in space with each other. You'll also notice that they are playing around with flashbacks; many shows do this, but i got a distinct impression early on that they were trying to mimic LOST. Sometimes it works, other times it's just distracting.
SGU was struggling to find its footing in the first half of the season, and it suffered from some particularly boring plots, such as one horrible episode that was the equivalent of having a wasp stuck in your house and trying to chase it out a window. Yet my perseverance in watching has finally paid off in the 2nd half of the season. The story arc is finally developing nicely, including a new group of aliens who lack the cheese factor of SG-1's Goa'uld and so far have proven more mysterious than the Wraith (and thank the gods that there's no sign of the replicators yet - the equivalent of space kitch).
One thing that annoys the hell out of me is random inclusion of songs in the eps that i guess are supposed to be part of the narration or something but bomb the mood instead of affirming it. I mean the emo or whatever type of crap music they use is not as much of a disaster as if they woulda spliced a rap song into the footage, but they really screwed up bigtime by including music with lyrics. Obviously someone on the production team wanted to be trendy and/or include their favorite artists: this indulgence should not have been permitted.

Edit Feb. 2013: As for complaints about the seasons being released in halves: I agree, this is bogus, in a sense. However, at this point I wish I had bought them when the show was still on the air; if more fans had done this, it may have been justification for the studio to continue production (or perhaps this is just wishful thinking on my part).

Anyway, the plot possibilities are almost limitless, and I think SGU has potential to pull off some great story arcs and keep the generally smart tone of the show without the trappings of its predecessors. Let's hope they keep moving in the direction that the 2nd half of s01 turned towards. This could be the best SG yet.",1280707200,3,3616,4.570107858243452

Hollywood likes to rear its greedy head as to how the Internet is full of piracy,blah blah blah but I see them as the real pirates. They have ripped us fans off in many ways. This is just one of them that is forcing fans to buy 1/2 seasons which costs more for us consumers and may even take up more of our shelf space. I for one am sick of greedy corporations and there are many of them in our world. That is why I only gave this one star. And as much as it hurts I am buying both of these sets used not new.
hollywood stop splitting shows into 2 or I for one will never buy them new.

Now onto the show:
This new SGU is definately not like SG1 or SGA and I do enjoy the show but not as much as the older shows. To much drama not enough good action and humor. Maybe season 2 will bring a change.
I am sticking with the show and not jumping ship. I do enjoy the Stargate idea and love the going thru the gate to new and exciting places. Hope we gate more in season 2.",1280275200,16,1070,3.798206278026906
4134443,5,B003KZ27MG,"Picked this season 1.5 up at Walmart yesterday - thought I'd let people know what was in it. But before that, it looks like I could have gotten the Bluray set here on Amazon for what I paid for the regular dvd set. Anyway, no big deal. One thing that might interested some people, when I picked up the dvd set I noticed that there was a pouch attached to the back of the DVD case. Wasn't anything mentioned on the cover, but I assumed that it was an extra DVD or something. Turned out to be something, inside the pouch was a folded up box that when put together becomes a slipcase for the two  seasons - turning them into the full season of SG:U. Which I thought was nice. Also, inside the DVD case there is a rebate check good for $10 off either a season of Stargate SG-1 or Stargate Atlantis. The rebate check does me little good as there was something stuck to it which resulted in a good part of the check being destroyed. But, seeing how I already have all the seasons so that wasn't a big deal for me. Have no clue if these two extras are just something that comes in sets available from Walmart, or if they are also in the sets sold elsewhere.

There are three discs in this set,

* Disc one episodes: Space, Divided, Faith
* Disc two episodes: Human, Lost, Sabotage, Pain
* Disc three episodes: Subversion, Incursion - Pt. 1 & Pt. 2

Back of the DVD case lists the following special features:
* Chatting with the cast featurettes
* Designing a New Race: Space Aliens
* Tanked! Elyse Levesque goes for a swim
* Kino Video Diaries

4134444,1,B003KZ27MG,This is the worst SCIFI - Stargate show.  The hold experience is a do nothing go nowhere in space.  The story is centered around a bickery cast with a poorly written script.  The show has no real leadership on a ship called Destiny cast afloat in space.  The sex (hetro and homo) is totally out of place and unnecesseary in this production.  I would not recommend this show to anyone. IT's overpriced this 1.5 just as 1.0 was.  They are charging you for a 1/2 season.,1280102400,6,467,4.372093023255814
4134455,1,B003KZ27MG,"Dude...
I own every episode of SG TOS and watch them religiously.  This series has so much potential in either direction.  If you have ever seen this series you know which direction the writers chose.  I'm going to purchase all the episodes of SGA and forget they ever created the SGU series.

More to come in regards to the enormous mistake of how this series is setup.

the ship is leaving the galaxy?
what galaxy did the ship start in?
why did you need zero point module to jump to the ship?

Please...slow down the pace of the ship writers and screw the back story...we know the back story...the ancients are bad-asses and left toys to play with :).",1279756800,6,653,4.445378151260504
4134456,1,B003KZ27MG,"Season 1 was sort of up and down for me. It's definitely more of a nu-BSG lite type show with a darker/edgier take which served BSG well. However, as a big fan of SG-1 and Atlantis, it was almost too big a departure at first. I've kept an open mind about the conflict between the characters and while I don't want a Star Trek Next Gen. feel where everyone's perfect and get's along with everyone show, I'd appreciate it if they went ahead and had civilians bury the hatchet with the military (and vice-versa) and start focus on stories outside the ship a bit more.

There's some very likable characters and there's some talented actors on the show and I think they could make this into a pretty solid show so I'll be tuning into season 2. I will not, however, pay for the half-season rip-off DVD's that Sci-Fi is trying to milk us with now. Either I'll buy the whole show when it's released or not at all. I'd encourage everyone to vote with their pocket book and do the same.",1279670400,7,976,4.362637362637362
4134457,1,B003KZ27MG,"Having watched numerous episodes of this series on TV, I find ABSOLUTELY *NOTHING* I LIKE about this CHEAP STARGATE IMPOSTER.

The biggest problem is that I don't REMOTELY find *ANY"" characters I like or identify with. NOT A SINGLE ONE! And OFF the STATION GOES. BOOOOOOOOOOOOR-ING!!!

The BRAIN TRUSTS AT SY-FY decided Stargate Atlantis COST TOO MUCH so they replaced it with THIS GARBAGE TO SAVE MONEY. So BEWARE! Even if you actually TOLERATE this series, you can bet your rear that SY-FI will cancel and replace it the moment they think it ""costs too much..."" no matter HOW POPULAR IT MAY BE.

Is this Stargate or a soap opera.  I am extremely disappointed with the direction they have gone.  But his is just my opinion.  I find it boring at most times, but am still open to hope.

4134459,2,B003KZ27MG,"(NOTE:  This is more of a commentary on the show itself, and not on the DVD set)

I've been a fan of Stargate since the movie, and just loved Stargate SG-1 ever since it started on Showtime.  When Stargate Universe was announced, the premise was awesome and I thought it would open up new plot lines and storytelling.  And it did.

However, I feel somewhat frustrated at the same time.  There are plot holes, inconsistencies, and some other things that just don't make sense.  It also seems like it's the same bunch of writers from Battlestar Galactica, from the gloomy soundtrack to the use of the term ""FTL"" (I don't think it was used in SG-1, although I'm not sure.  The first time I ever heard the term FTL was from Battlestar Galactica).  They also abuse the communication stones.

Hopefully the writing gets tighter and more consistent as the story continues.  In general, this series does have a fairly engaging plot, and does try to make a more grittier SG-1 (like how the new BSG was a ""grittier"" version of the old one, and how all the reboots tend to be ""grittier"" versions of the originals).

It is worth having a look for yourself.",1278979200,7,1144,4.553921568627451
4134460,2,B003KZ27MG,"Up to this point, I adored the Stargate Franchise. However, this series seems to be a an attempt to copy the popular Battlestar Galactica remake.  Just because you CAN stick a stargate in the middle of a show does not necessarily mean you should. This series likes to make a point of shoving in your face how young their characters are--most of whom actually state their age during the first few episodes (in case you are harboring any illusions they're not in the target 20-something group).  They even go so far as to give the oldest person on the series the name ""Young"" (I guess to apologize for the fact he's not in his 20's).  I suppose the purpose of this is to appeal to a younger demographic.  Those of us who have been with Stargate since the original movie/tv series are obviously not in our 20's any more.  The amount of angst and personal drama on this show will probably entertain the ""New Moon"" crowd, but frankly, as a pragmatic 40-something, I find it mellow dramatic and tiresome.",1278979200,5,998,4.553072625698324
4134461,1,B003KZ27MG,"As I have adamantly proclaimed before, the 1/2 Season rip-offs absolutely have to stop. I'l explain in detail what I will do to the marketing executives. I will only buy SGU as a complete season box set, or I will wait for both the 1/2 seasons to fall beyond the price point together well below the average full season price for other series. YOU WILL NOT GET THE EXTRA MONEY!

On its own merits SGU is an interesting premise and approach to the setting. I like it well enough and want to see more. But I will NOT support the price gouging tactics of the marketing execs. If that ""percieved lack of income"" ends up killing the show (which could and should otherwise survive on its own merits) the blame is on them, not the public that refuses to be ripped off.",1278892800,108,760,4.352112676056338
4134462,5,B003KZ27MG,"This is just a quick review (maybe even a spoiler).  The ending of SG-U season one, unlike the other 15 stargate xx season finales, is quite intense: the characters you learn to love, and even hate, are faced with an execution.  And it is believable! (like 24, where there's no character, except Jack, that is immune from death).

I'm looking forward to the next seaon!

It's too bad the whole first season is not grouped into one purchase.",1277164800,2,440,4.602564102564102
4134463,3,B003KZ27MG,"So far Universe has been a big disappointment, but I am hopeful they can turn it around.  I have watched every episode of SG1 and Atlantis and love the concept and intrigue of ""Gate Travel"" that both are built upon, and therefore looked forward to Universe.  Sadly, this installment seems to focus more on human drama and less on Sci-fiction.

The concept of Destiny is most intriguing.  A ship that has been traveling for hundreds of thousands of years, to a region in space that could never otherwise be explored, offers all kinds of appealing possibilities for excellent sci-fiction.  Sadly, the storyline thus far has had very little to do with Sci-fi and seems to go in an endless loop of boring character development. Sadly, there have only been a couple of episodes where any exploration of space is accomplished.

I would get rid of about every character except Dr Rush, who by the way is outstanding, and assemble a crew who unites together for the simple fact that in order to survive they have too.  Give us episodes that have more alien involvement so that crew does not have time to waste on petty differences.  Get rid of the cheating husbands and wives and lesbian themes and give us real sci-fi.  Otherwise, move the show to ABC and have it follow General Hospital.",1277078400,6,1281,4.683035714285714
4134464,5,B003KZ27MG,"This is a series that you are going to love or hate.  I am not here to persuade you one way or another. This is obviously just my opinion and nothing more and nothing less.

On one end, purist of the SG franchise, at least from my experience, usually end up disliking the show because it is not a fun filled action sci-fi show.  It does not have the humour or the fast pace, so the obvious change is what is making them trip over their own feet. They talk about they do not know how to write a show, but the show has been having the same writers since sg-1.  So the question I ask is, you loved them before, why dislike them now?

On the other end, it does have drama.  Sci-fi to me is not always about goofiness cliche's, wild aliens and big bangs of fire.  It is about the actions between people with a hint of possibilites.
This is where Star Trek took its cue from.  Roddenberry realized that there has to be some potential realism to make sci-fi believable and the cool gadgets and other what nots made us believe that these things are possible futures.

I love SG-1 and SG-A, both always have drawn me in and made me believe and I do love the camaraderie between the cast. This series takes it a step up and show that not every one will get along.  There is a deeper torture between the cast and a sense of jealousy and hatred.  It is almost a cast of sins and inner demons.  Regrets and low self esteem.

I read comments that each episode is so different from the last.  Well is each day that goes on with your life exactly the same as yesterday?  No, I think not.

Others say its a BSG rip off.  Somewhat, but even BSG wasn't an original idea and a rip off off the original.  Yeah yeah yeah, a re-imagining of the show.  Still not original I say.  I actually found the BSG quite boring and trite.  Though, I am in the minority of that opinion.

The thing here I love is the fact there is this ship with folks who are stuck and have to learn to live with one another even if they do not like them... that in itself is a challenge.  I can not imagine me living with someone who, lack of a better word, hate.........and who I can not escape from because they are stuck with me.

All in all, you have to crawl before you walk and this show is going to take time for you to really enjoy.  Unless you come in with a perceive notion on how SCI-FI is s'pose to be..let the show get its barrings.  Hell, I hated the original Star Wars, but loved Empire Strikes Back, but I gave it a chance and now love the whole series (4,5,6)

last but not least

What I do love about the show is the continuity.  Bringing back characters from the original series to make the show more believable as far as time line goes.  You know it takes after SG-1 and SG-A and sprinkles the characters through out the series to let you know, hey, they are still connected with these people in some form or way.  They are part of the SG crew....

I imagine the show will start to ramp up a bit on the action, but who knows right..

All in all, keep an open mind ... imagine yourself on that ship and figure out who you would be your friend if you are cut off from everyone or who would you go against because of your beliefs.  Imagine yourself being stuck with a life or death situation and the possibilities are there... you just have to take in the show and see for what it is and not compare it to other similar shows because no matter what, we all borrow things from folks all the time.",1276992000,37,3462,4.125560538116592

It has truly idiotic relationships, plots, etc. The protocols, mandates, etc. in the series change from episode to episode. Robert Carlyle is so much better an actor than Louis Ferreira, who is his (supposed) military counterpart. In fact, Carlyle is probably the best actor on the show; he has forgotten more than the rest will ever know. I am including Lou Diamond Phillips & the occasional guest ""stars"" (""actor"" is more accurate than ""star""). BTW, I saw a fast food (DQ) commercial this week with a much thinner David Blue, the actor who played ""Eli Wallace"" on the show. Although the CGI & FX are much worse, Stargate Atlantis blows this series out of the water. SG-1, too. The best is ""Firefly"" (2002-2003), which has a truly huge worldwide cult following. It also has a much better cast & writing. The director, Joss Whedon is very, very underrated. Even though it originally had 11 episodes, with 3 more (that were unaired) along with the film ""Serenity"" (2005), it has been preciously saved on the largest video streaming company.",1478304000,,1183,4.775609756097561
