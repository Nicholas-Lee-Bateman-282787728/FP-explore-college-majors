8527181,5,B008ERNL3Y,"My second-favorite baseball team has a history of 130 years, dating back to the New York Gothams of the 1880s. Yet in that incredible history in two cities (New York and San Francisco), with titanic pitchers on the roster (Christy Mathewson, Carl Hubbell, Sal Maglie, Juan Marichal), it never had a Perfect Game.

Plenty of no-hitters, yes -- Mathewson, Perry, Timmy Lincecum with two, Amos Rusie, Jeff Tesreau, Rube Marquard, John Montefusco, Ed Halicki, and Jonathan Sanchez, but never ""27 up, 27 down.""

Fortunately for Giants fans of the modern era, Matt Cain did it in 2012, which meant that it was videotaped in the precise, full-color, multi-camera format we have come to take for granted in the last 10 years, and called by two favorite Giants broadcasters, Mike Krukow and Duane Kuiper.

With this DVD, you get to see every pitch and every inning of this historic game. With the statistics and other shots, it's more than just a Perfect Game, it's a freeze-frame of a moment in baseball history. You get every at-bat, every pitch, every play, managers sweating it out, fans becoming increasingly nervous as Matt closes in on history, and the explosion of joy when history is made.

In between, viewers also get the ""social history"" of the time...as Kruk and Kuip make their promotional announcements, they talk baseball trivia, discuss baseball as it was in 2012, all stuff that will tell future generations what 2012 Giants baseball was like.

For us, this is ""the world we live in."" But our grandchildren will look on this as ""the old days,"" and ""a story.""

This DVD brings the game a level of immediacy for decades, and provide Giant fans with a moment to savor for decades",1414627200,,1685,4.813148788927336

8527183,5,B008ERNL3Y,I actually went to the game and experienced the thrill of a perfect game live.  I looked everywhere for a copy of the game and finally came across it here.  Thank you for helping me preserve one of my most cherished memories so that I can watch it over again with my kids!,1401235200,,272,4.113207547169812
