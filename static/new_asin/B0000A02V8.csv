5.0 out of 5 stars Movie Info February 16, 2007
By G. Burrell

1. Escape from Sobibor -  a really excellent movie based in truth about the concentration camp that the inmates escaped.

2. Beyond Justice - This is the 'movie' version of a very HTF mini series.

3. Cold Blood - very interesting made for TV German movie.  With someone doing RH's voice over!!! Very strange seeing a you and very handsome RH but hear this odd sound voice.

A fair to good transfer.  Looks like TV from the 70'sor 80's which I think it is.
I would recommend this to all Rutger Hauer fans.  A very eclectic set.",1400198400,,826,4.11875

7994752,5,B0000A02V8,"Since there wasn't any info on these three movies I added this info:

1. Escape from Sobibor - During WWII, the death camp at Treblinka had an escape, causing the Commandant at a similar camp in Sobibor to vow (actually threaten) that his camp would never experience the same thing. But those who were its captives, the Jewish laborers that had been spared from the ovens, knew that they were on borrowed time and that their only hope was to escape... the only question was how to do it.

2. Beyond Justice - A woman's ex-husband, who is the son of an Arab chieftain, kidnaps their teenage son and brings him back to Morocco, where the boy is to be made the leader of the tribe. The child's mother hires a mercenary to get her son and bring him back to her.

3. Cold Blood - Corinna witnesses how three guys chase and shoot a man in front of her lonesome house. As only witness, they force her to come with them and care for the guy's wound. But she manages to flee shortly after and takes Blondi to a doctor. He tells her his story, how he used to smuggle drugs, but one day fled with a suitcase full of money. Corinna inexplicably falls in love with him and decides to accompany him on his further flight. But the villains are close behind them.",1171584000,12,1247,4.297872340425532
