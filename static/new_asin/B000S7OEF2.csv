2883219,1,B000S7OEF2,"I should have listened to the review that said this was a complete ripoff.  I was also thinking I was getting the whole Crossroads concert, but not only is there only one song from that concert, the other songs (at most maybe 5 other songs) aren't performed in front of a live audience.  There is about a 10 min. interview with the band.  I bought it for my husband for his birthday and feel is was the worst gift I've ever given him.  I can't believe that I paid over $30.00 for it!",1274659200,18,483,4.161290322580645
2883220,1,B000S7OEF2,"This was a rip off.  I thought it was the whole CMT Crossroads show and it was just one song from it.

8204642,1,B000S7OEF2,Read the description carefully at Amazon.  This is not the CMT Crossroads DVD.  There is only one song clip from the actual Crossroads event.  The rest is just some stuff from closed studio practice sessions.,1462838400,,208,4.885714285714286

8204645,1,B000S7OEF2,"Not at all, I was looking for the entire Sugarland crossroads performance, Not just the one song. It was a big let down : (",1392076800,,123,3.96
8204646,4,B000S7OEF2,"This was a gift for a friend who is a huge Bon Jovi fan. She tells me that this is one of the best CMT concerts she has ever seen. Plus, they team up with Sugarland for one song.",1383177600,,178,3.58974358974359

8204649,1,B000S7OEF2,"Should have read the reviews!!! I got so excited thinking I'd found the ACTUAL CMT CrossRoads Television video of Bon Jovi and Sugarland, I just ordered it. Totally bogus. Only 1 song do they sing and play together on this video. On the REAL CMT CrossRoads they played 8! I found it yesterday at [...].
I don't have it yet so can't testify that it's great, but I'm hoping to not get ripped off again. This item here on Amazon should be removed from this site as packaged.",1347235200,7,471,4.363636363636363
8204650,5,B000S7OEF2,"This was a great DVD. Very entertaining. Great for viewing, especially when you're in the mood for a concert. wish it was longer.
