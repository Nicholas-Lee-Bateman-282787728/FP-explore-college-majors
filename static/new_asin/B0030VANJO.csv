4046832,3,B0030VANJO,"Just an FYI. Buyer beware.

Mill Creek won't be issuing versions w/ the original songs -- and they won't be shelling out the bucks for music rights to the Dead Dog Records arc (hence they simply aren't including those episodes at all.

If that's not a big deal to you, go for it.",1262736000,139,279,4.245283018867925
4046853,4,B0030VANJO,"Fell in love with this series when it first came out and was thrilled when I found it on DVD. However, I was a bit disappointed when I learned that ""The Collector's Edition"" did not include the Dead Dog Records arc, and that some of the original music was changed due to music copyrights and such.
Maybe some time in the future the Entire series will be released with the original music, but until then, I will still get my fix watching the old episodes.",1472860800,2,454,4.352941176470588

4046855,3,B0030VANJO,I loved this TV series and still do.  The problem with the set I received is that some of the discs did not play properly and by the time I got to those episodes it was too late to exchange them.,1472515200,,195,3.7560975609756095
4046856,5,B0030VANJO,"Referencing other reviews complaining about exclusion of the ""Dead Dog arc"" (and not at all among the best arcs of the show) due to music clearance issues, I bought the DVD set in the 90's and love it!. The Steelgrave and Profitt arcs alone are worth it as they were the definitive of the show.

To one particular reviewer who wrote that the Steelgrave finale episode was ""massacred"" because a certain Moody Blues song was replaced by a perfectly fine orchestral underscore, my suggestion is to get over it.

Anyone who believes that scene doesn't stand on it's own without a certain pop song playing is lost in issues that have no real bearing to dramatic content.

Throughout this series, the great Mike Post score clearly displays what's sadly lacking in TV music today.

So you can either buy the best show ever on television  (subjective opinion) or not because of music rights clearance exclusions that ultimately add up to squat in my opinion. The collection is well worth it.",1471824000,,983,4.758823529411765

4046860,1,B0030VANJO,I purchased this series specifically to watch and share the season about the music business with Glenn Frye.

4046875,2,B0030VANJO,"Butchered by the lack of inclusion of the Dead Dog Records arc owing to music rights nonsense.  As this is (arguably, perhaps in competition with the initial Steelgrave arc) the most memorable arc in the series, that's a pity.  The Dead Dog Records arc can be obtained...elsewhere.

Quality varies throughout; these were not preserved as well as I would like.

Most of this is not the company's fault - they did what they could with what they had.  Overall though, hardly what I'd term a ""collector's edition.""  More like, ""This is as much as you're going to get, so you better make the best of it.""",1461110400,,599,4.60377358490566

4046880,3,B0030VANJO,"Wiseguy, when I watched it on TV in the 80's, was FANTASTIC. NOT because of Ken Wahl, in MY OPINION. But because of Kevin Spacey. When I watched the entire 'season of 'Mel & Susan', I KNEW and VOICED to my friend's and family that Kevin Spacey will one day be one of the world's best actor's. Well, look at him now. A FANTASTIC ACTOR IN EVERYTHING HE DOES. I WILL mention actor, Ray Sharkey, (R.I.P - He died of AIDS related complication's) as well. He did a marvelous job in this short running show. The final episode with 'Sonny & Vincent' was incredible...the song Nights in White Satin still haunts me to this day. Mel (Kevin Spacey's performance is unforgettable. Not entirely positive, but I DO believe that this show was his first ever, acting in front of the camera, job...at lest on TV. IF I am wrong, please correct me. The 'Star' of the show, in my OPINION ONLY, cannot really act his way out of  paper bag, but Spacey and Sharkey outshined him in SO many ways. IF you are a Spacey fan? IT is definitely WORTH IT to buy this set. A++++++++++++++++++++++++++",1453334400,,1068,4.448979591836735

4046882,3,B0030VANJO,"Great series but I wish I had known that my favorite arc was removed from this series because of music issues between the production company and the music companies. Because of this, my favorite arc, or storyline, that involves Blondie, Tim Curry, and Paul Winfield, among others, is removed. If you watch closely you'll hear a quick mention of Isaac because Vinny has a short-lived relationship with Isaac's widow and she mentions Death Dog Studios in season 3. The series was great and the world got a chance to learn about the shady underground through a well-placed undercover cop. It is my hope that the problems over copyright will one day be resolved and we can see Wiseguy in it's entirety. Till then, I'll hold on to this set and watch it from time to time. Still, I really miss that arc for Death Dog Records.",1447891200,7,819,4.616438356164384

4046884,4,B0030VANJO,"The first season was by far and away the best. When actor Ken Wahl injured himself, and they ""replicated"" it on screen to explain why he was laid up the entire season, the show quickly died off. I am also perturbed that this release IS MISSING AN ENTIRE ARC of the series due to music copy write issues. The show is taking off like wild fire again of social media, and yet they still skimp and will not release the missing episodes. Sad.",1443571200,2,437,4.27710843373494
4046885,5,B0030VANJO,"If you loved  The Departed, or were fascinated by the machinations of Breaking Bad, give this series a look.  The premise of an undercover cop carrying a conviction and time to enable him to operate with credibility with various gangsters was brilliantly executed, especially during the first season.  Of course it didn't hurt that the first two criminals he went after were played with a vengeance by the late Ray Sharkey and Kevin Spacey.  Be prepared for a change in the show for the 4th season, after Ken Wahl left Wiseguy.  Also be aware that for reasons of cost, one story arc, about Dead Dog Records, is not included.  You can, if you like the show, find a seller on the net.",1440460800,6,682,4.549180327868853

The downside is that they're so good they highlight the deficiencies of the less talented actors in the show.  Ken Wahl and Jonathan Banks are superb.  My only complaint is that the story arc set in  the music business and featuring Glenn Fry, Debbie Harry and Tim Curry is missing.

Its not completely the fault of the set's producers... no subtitles, no additional audio languages, no commentaries which were included in previous sets ARE their fault but missing half of the second season (and changing the soundtrack on other episodes) I believe is due to the show's original producers not properly getting the rights to the music used when the episodes aired.

4046999,3,B0030VANJO,"It was great being able to watch this again. A fond memory from back when I was a kid. At the time,I never had seen anything like this : Stories unfolding for a whole series of episodes, complicated plots with twists, cliffhangers...and an incredible gallery of damaged or neurotic characters (Bad AND Good guys !) played by fantastic actors. Just watch the box-set sleeve : Ken Wahl, making his undercover agent Vinnie Terranova smart, likeable and wounded. Then the great Johnatan Banks played the part of Vinnie's supervisor and protector: Frank McPike. Grumpy, droopy-eyed, with an irresistible, deadpan sense of humor.
(These days, Banks is also known as Mike Ehrentraut in Breaking Bad). And last but not least : Wiseguy introduced us to Kevin Spacey, then mostly an obscure NY theater actor. His bad guy named Mel Profitt remains as one of the most striking characters in the whole series. Spacey made Mel completely insane, hilarious, manic, unpredictable, dangerous, ridiculous, and pathetic. Great performance.(Still one of his best, in my opinion.) Not forgetting dozens of other actors, in big or small parts, who populated many A or B movies throughout the 80's. (To name a few: Dennis Lipscomb, Paul Winfield, Joan Severance...)

BUT.

My wiewing of Wiseguy, as a 40 year old guy was a bit less joyful as expected. First of all, let's face it : Those 80's show don't age very gracefully. Haircuts. Music. 4/3 screen format. PHONE BOOTHS  ! Well. You have to accept  it. Comparing this to contemporary shows is vain. You have to consider Wiseguy as the ancestor of those programs. Experimenting, trying things and not always succeeding.

And then there are other disappointments, this time related to the box-set itself. Well, ok. The show is in 4/3 format. But it turns out it hasn't been remastered either. So it's really an 80's experience, complete with visible frames, blurry pannings and sometimes faded colors.
And then comes the real big letdown :
There is a whole story arc missing. Too bad, it was one of my favorites. But that's the way it is : Buying this ""collector's edition"", you won't get to see the ""Dead Dog Records"" plot. What a shame. It was great fun. Featuring Deborah Harry as a singer struggling with creative problems, Tim Curry as an evil record company mogul, and various other excentric music business whackos.
Apparently, this segment couldn't be included due to expansive musical rights.

This is why I only rated the boxset ""okay""..
And then there's ...er...the fourth season.
Artificially rejuvenated version of a dying show. Ken Wahl's gone. Another guy's here and noone cares. Title music turns latino trying to catch up on Miami Vice. Boooohoo.

Anyway. This can be viewed as a prototype for many current shows, and it is still fun . Especially the first two seasons.",1359331200,,2815,4.951271186440678

Thus when I saw the Wiseguy Collector's Edition, Seasons 1-4 I was really excited. I started out with the first season and watched all the episodes and I also noticed that the ""finale"" for the Sonny Steelgrave arc was missing the music to ""Knights in White Satin"". Luckily I still have the VCR tape of the episode when it originally aired so I was not too disappointed.

But when I got through the Mel Profitt, Terrance Knox, Jerry Lewis stories, and got to the next series, I saw that the Amber Twine arc did not include the entire Dead Dog records storyline and was wondering why as I remember it included Paul Whitfield as her husband and the owner of a record company.

Glad I looked up the reviews so I now know why the storyline was butchered. I  thought it was just me having brain fade. I am glad that I am able to watch it to catch up on what happened after that storyline but glad I did not buy the DVD product. It is worth the free viewing with Amazon Prime but I agree it is not worth buying. Maybe someday we will get a complete unedited product and at that time I might purchase.

4047010,5,B0030VANJO,"BMI and ASCAP are writers unions that have a lot to do with the reason the music is missing. They represent the songwriters and have been known to shut down the live entertainment at local restaurants if they don't pony up as much as 10 cents per seat per night regardless if the seat is occupied or not. All the clubs that have live music are paying per person per night for the bands to play songs written by writers of these unions. They don't care if the restaurant/club is just starting out and on a good night will only have about 25% occupancy. They charge for 100% of the potential occupancy and if it happens to be more than the enterprise takes in then it's no big deal to them. Hey at least they prevented the small timer from profiting from the labors of their writers. Most of the people who bring in live bands don't think about it until about 2 or 3 months after they open they are told to pay or stop playing songs written by their members. If they continue playing the music then they are sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars. I shudder to think how much the series would cost if they did have the music. I guess the ""real die hard"" Wiseguy fans wouldn't mind paying several hundred dollars for the series but those like me who have limited funds couldn't afford the DVDs and we would just be out of luck.

Leaving out some seven episodes is significant in my view. Not to mention the omission of ""Nights in White Satin"" is just plain WRONG. Without that song,the entire scene is just a couple of guys sitting on the floor looking at each other. And ""Stairway to Heaven"" without ""Hit the Road Jack"" loses the entire reason for Frank shooting the jukebox.

A collector's edition is something you pay more for because it's worth it, something you really want and will return to again and again. Not something you get simply because ""oh well, I can't do any better so I'll settle for this."" I suppose the idea is that we should be grateful for whatever we can get. ""Wiseguy"" is ""Wiseguy,"" after all. And yet Wiseguy without an entire plot arc, Wiseguy with massacred music, this is just sad and disappointing. I may be chasing an elusive holy grail dream here, but I want Wiseguy in its entirety. I want to see Vinnie and Sonny eyeballing each other to the strains of the Moody Blues and Frank McPike blowing the jukebox to blazes with ""Hit the Road, Jack"" as the number that drives him over the edge.

This really is a great look into government undercover operations against organized crime. Vinnie must deal with his own morals as he lives the seductive stlye of those he is working to bring down. Throw in a priest as a brother and a mother who wants nothing to do with her hoodlum son and you have the making of a man who is plagued with doing what he knows is best or getting out so his family will love him again. This is not just another white hat vs black hat drama. You get to see both the good and bad of the criminals Vinnie becomes involved with. Jonathan Banks protrays Vinnie's FBI boss. At first you think he is a real jerk, then you come to understand that he has a very witty dry sense of humor, wants to protect Vinnie, and count the victories every time they take out a major criminal. Show has great guest stars playing the roles of the criminals.  I am so glad that I found that Amazon has this entire series.  I have had no trouble with any of the discs in this collector's edition.

It should be advertised that it is missing episodes, and not called a collector's edition. I gladly would have paid more money for the set to have the story arc in it and the music from the original airing. Reminiscent of the Tour of Duty releases.

I wish I had read the reviews thoroughly, but I didn't because the label ""Collector's Edition"" implies that all episodes are included and that there will be bonuses.  This is downright fraud in my opinion.  The item description, which I did read, did not mention missing episodes.  Also, the discs deliberately mis-identify the last five episodes of Season Two as Episodes 11 through 15, when they are actually episodes 11, 12 and 20, 21 & 22.  Episodes 13 through 19 are not included in this set.  I love this show and Ken Wahl, Jonathan Banks and Jim Byrnes were great.  It also usually had great writing, with some duds, but it was far superior to most shows ever produced.

This item must be labeled with a notification that these episodes are not included.  I am livid over discovering this so long after my purchase.  I waited to watch this show slowly, to savor it, only to find out while watching the end of Season Two that seven precious episodes from a compelling arc are not included.

I will avoid buying anything from Mill Creek and I will advise all of my friends to do the same.  They have done a great dis-service to fans of this show.",1313193600,9,1279,4.631111111111111

It is great to see that some of our now established stars such as Kevin Spacey and Annett Bernning actually had their start on this show. I really miss this quality now in tv. Most of all, I miss Vinnie Terranova, the character as Ken Wahl portrays him, is timeless and endearing like a boyhood friend.",1310947200,2,580,4.686274509803922

4047032,3,B0030VANJO,"When I found out the producers of this DVD set excised the ""Dead Dog Records"" episodes because of disputes over music royalties, my interest in it fell nearly to zero. What good is this ""Collector's Edition"" of ""Wiseguy"" if it's not the complete series? The ""Dead Dog Records"" story arc is crucial to the full impact of the series. I can only imagine how Tim Curry, Glenn Frey and Patti D'Arbanville feel about having their very fine work on this series obliterated. And who can feel good about the erasure of an important role in the career of the late Paul Winfield?

If I buy any ""Wiseguy"" DVD set, it probably will be the Complete Season 1, the ""Nights in White Satin"" brouhaha notwithstanding. You still get all the glory of Kevin Spacey, an obvious star in the making, in his proto-Keyser Soze role as Mel Profitt. (William Russ, who was Spacey's equal in the Mel Profitt arc as the wild man Roger Lococco, faded back into supporting roles; it makes you wonder about show business.) And you get all the excitement of Ray Sharkey as Sonny Steelgrave, who would have fit just as handily into ""The Sopranos"" or ""GoodFellas"" as he did in ""Wiseguy."" To see Sharkey is to feel all the sorrow of watching a wasted life and talent; instead of the star career he should have had, Sharkey ended up in a junkie's early grave.

To watch ""Wiseguy"" again after nearly a quarter-century is to marvel at how little it has dated, the pay phones and toned-down language notwithstanding. This is a show that still has snap, verve, and excitement, largely because the characters and the actors who play them are so exciting. Ken Wahl still cuts a charismatic figure as Vinnie Terranova; it's a tragedy that a combination of inner demons and physical calamities forced him out of acting. Jonathan Banks, as the surly, smart-mouthed McPike, could have taught even Dennis Franz a thing or two about being a great curmudgeonly cop. And Jim Byrnes was always a joy to watch as Lifeguard; his presence begs the question as to why Hollywood still lags behind so shamefully in hiring disabled actors.

Anyway, I love ""Wiseguy,"" and I look forward to the day when someone ponies up the dough to produce a REAL DVD set of the complete series.",1310428800,5,2218,4.653061224489796
4047033,4,B0030VANJO,"I admit, when a relative of mine bought Volume One of this show, I wasn't too enthusiastic about it for some reason. but during the first few minutes of the two-part season premiere, i was intrigued, and by the end of it, I was hooked. My first impression of McPike as a P.I.T.A. (I can't say what that stands for here) didn't wear off until late in Season 3. but i'll take this one season at a time. Ken Wahl gives a magnetic (and award-winning) performance as Vinnie Terrranova, an undercover operative for the OCB, a (fictional) branch of the FBI (Federal Bureau Of Investigation). Jonathan Banks co-stars as McPike, his tough superior with brass marbles, and Jim Byrnes (a real-life amputee who lost his legs 15 years to the day he got the role in Wiseguy; the circumstance in which he lost his legs in real life is explained in an episode) co-stars as Lifeguard, Vinnie's contact person.

Season 1: The Sonny Steelgrave story arc was excellent and full of tension, every episode being well-written and the suspense carefully constructed. There were a few scenes in a couple of episodes that were strongly remeniscent of the 1972 classic ""The Godfather."" SPOILER ALERT!!! The arc ended in a different manner than I thought it would, as there's a website that tells you how an arc ends. I thought Sonny would go into his office, and there blow his brains out with the camera cutting away to the wall where some blood splatters just before he pulls the trigger. I think it should have ended that way. but other than that, I thought it was a good arc. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!!

The second half of Season 1 was taken up with the Mel Profitt story arc. It was really good, featuring a star-making performance from then unknown stage actor Kevin Spacey as Profitt. Joan Severance also turned in a terrific performance as Mel's sexy sister Susan. But it was all about the really manic performance of Kevin Spacey, which is a forerunner of his Academy Award winning turn in ""The Usual Suspects."" William Russ (Disney's ""Boy Meets World"") also stars.

Season 2 begins with a shocker, as Vinnie deals with a white supremacist group. Fred Dalton Thompson and Paul Gilfoyle (""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"") star.

Then, he deals with a clothing company threatened by a mobster. Jerry Lewis, Ron Silver and Stanley Tucci star.

After that, he...HOLD IT. There's a story arc missing here. Which leaves a loss in continuity with the rest of Season 2, as a recurring character who Vinnie was dating is no longer around (and the final scene of the last episode she appears in has her and Vinnie together in his mom's house, setting up the Christmas tree. The stand-alone episodes sprinkled in Season 2 are quite good. Ken Wahl even gets in on the action, making some white noise. Then, we're launched into a storyline about the Mafia, which is apparently connected to the arc not included in this set. Confusing (since the arc is missing), but quite good. It ends with a bang...literally.

Season 3 continues with the shocker that Season 2 concluded on with the Mafia storyline. Terrific, if a bit confusing (and again, some scenes are remeniscent of ""The Godfather""; it's not a put-down, I'm merely noting this).

Then, Vinnie is called up to Washington, D.C. seemingly to investigate a plot to counterfeit Japanese yen, but he suspects that there's an even bigger conspiracy brewing...

Vinnie then heads up to the state of Washington to smoke out a serial killer. Once again, some things aren't always what they seem. The stakes are even higher here than ever before...

Then, Vinnie...wait a minute. Vinnie's not here. What happened? CBS decided they wanted to change the way the series was going, with its to-be-continued storylines, and told co-creater/executive producer Stephen J. Cannell to talk to Ken Wahl about it. But Mr. Wahl (understandably so) did not agree and the dispute got heated, and he walked out and thus was written off the show. Oh...so THAT explains why Vinnie's no longer here. Okay...moving on.

Season 4: I have mixed feelings about this season. First off, I don't like that Ken Wahl was written off the show the way he was. They should have had a double play him (seen from the back) and lead into the new character. Seeing Vinnie written off like that would probably have made the audience understand more instead of the writers doing it the way they did (a la ""The Trail Of The Pink Panther,"" where the producers incorporated deleted scenes from the previous movies starring Peter Sellers into the movie to explain why he wasn't in the film, as Sellers died before production began on the movie). Pity too, because the storylines were still going strong, especially the final (unaired) episode, of which there are III included in this ""Collector's Set.""

I give the set 4 stars because the Dead Dog Records story arc is not included, thus making the next storyline somewhat confusing and a bit difficult to follow.

The series is rated TV-14. Let me address that. The first 10 episodes (in my opinion) are TV-PG, as the language is tame, a majority of the violence is implied rather than shown & what is shown is barely, if at all, graphic, and there's no sexual content (ie. characters making love in bed). Parental Guidance suggested.

However, beginning with the Mel Profitt storyline and from then on (minus one or two stand-alone episodes), the episodes are TV-14, as the language gets a little rougher, the violence is a bit more graphic and the sexual content goes up. Viewer Discretion advised.

With the above sentence said, I highly recommend this series.",1309478400,8,5584,4.791060291060291

4047036,5,B0030VANJO,"Wiseguy is probably one of the best cop dramas to come out of the 80's.  In a time where extended multi-story episodic shows are the norm, Wiseguy was one of the first to use this format in a prime time drama.  The first season is a classic starting with the Sonny Steelgrave arc, and Ray Sharkey as Sonny is the perfect foil to Ken Wahl's Vinnie Terranova. Every episode has something worth watching, with appearences by Ray Sharkey, Annette Benning, Kevin Spacey and many others you'll probably reconize. The regular cast is terrific too, and it's great to see the 3 main characters, Vinnie, Frank and Lifeguard, begining as strangers working together, and form a tightknit ""family"".

4047038,4,B0030VANJO,"Wahl is a remarkable (small) screen presence, part Elvis, part Brando, all hurt sincerity!  And Jonathan Banks's droopy eyed sarcasm plays off against him very well.  The show is worth watching but is pretty uneven, I must admit.  Acting and writing can be wonderful for one episode, or one scene, then seem just thrown together the next, without probability or intelligence, just actors reading their lines and going through the motions.  Deadlines are deadlines in TV production.
  Those who complain about the altered soundtrack in the final Steelgrave episode are rightly disappointed, but this isn't a restoration of the Sistine Chapel!  For the sake of nostalgia, just put on a Moody Blues album afterwards.
  The loss of the Dead Dogs arc is a greater pity.  Tim Curry was unforgettable in it and there were a few priceless scenes (the scary cell-mate singing to him, for example).  There are some technical glitches in my set:  I found that in the second season some episodes are not accessible by the menu, and I keep  going back to the first episode, using Play All, then running fast forward to where I want to go.

If you don't have the extrodinary amount for the offical four seasons, it's still a good buy.  I think Ken could have been on this show for ten seasons if not for his accident.  It was sad to see what happened to the character. Stephen Bauer was a good replacement.  However when the O.C.B. was eliminated the show became something that wasn't Wiseguy. If you want to see an extrinary show without spending a fortune for directors and actor commentary, this is the best set available.

I have to wonder why this show was never run in syndication more often.  It has an edge that many shows today don't have.  You didn't know from week to week if the actor portraying Vinnie Taranova would quit or walk off the set.  The Garment District story arc with Jerry Lewis was one of my favorites because you never knew what was going to happen. What I didn't like is when the entire O.C.B. backdrop was removed for no reason other than ""budget cuts"".  It took the danger and uncertainty out of the show.

I own the original DVD sets that were released, and while this current set doesn't include the the special features that the original DVD's did - this set includes all the other arcs (minus Dead Dog).

The issue I have is the transfer is incredibly cheap.  The audio and video isn't synced with some episodes (thankfully I have them on my other DVD set) and the interior packaging is a joke.

No versions released include some of the original music (great songs by famous artists were used) as the owners of the rights must have wanted huge amounts of money to let the producers release Wiseguy on DVD (because when it was produced there was no such thing as DVD's and generally TV shows did not last that long hence I think they only purchased the rights for a period of time for TV use only when originally made which is why you will not see reruns of this TV show).  There is an explanation of this on imdb.  There could be illegal versions available on the net with the original music but to be honest it's a great TV show and the story, writing and acting are a huge part of this fab show.  The Music Arc is not on any versions due to this issue (S2 E13 to 19 - 7 episodes).

I have gone from first released to latest.

After the Netflix vein petered out, we looked around for a way to continue the Wiseguy experience and here comes the ""Collector's Edition"" with ""Seasons 1 - 4.""  Perfect!

EXCEPT: They fail to mention that the Dead Dog Records arc was completely removed.

EXCEPT: The disk quality is so dismal that sections of the videos as long as 20 minutes are UNWATCHABLE.

I have debated returning the entire mess to Amazon, but keep trudging on because I am such a fan of the show.  It's too bad that after 20 years, they didn't take the time or spend the cash to do it right.

4047068,1,B0030VANJO,"I've watched every single thing Ken Wahl has ever made starting with the movie The Wanderers back in 1979.  The man is a genius, not only in front of the screen, but behind it as well.  His attention to every detail and keen sense of knowing what the public wants is nearly unmatched by today's standards of churning out trash TV.  I watched Wiseguy when it originally aired, and again in syndication (and I now thank God I taped them).  I was thrilled to see the box set DVDs come out and eagerly purchased all of them, like an idiot.  I have never been so disappointed in my life as I was with these box sets.

Simply put, they massacred the final episode of the Steelgrave arc by not having the song Nights in White Satin play in the background when Vinnie and Sonny were silently reflecting their intense brotherhood.  That was, and still is, the single most electrifying and chilling scene I've ever witnessed on any TV show or movie.  I still get chills when thinking about that scene.  I cried my eyes out when watching it.  Still do.  It's something that you ""had to be there"" (so to speak) in order to ""get it"".  These box sets simply robbed people of that experience.

I was appalled when watching the rest of the episodes in the box sets to see how much they removed from the original show.  Those songs, along with other details, were what made the scene believable, understandable and enjoyable.  The only thing I did enjoy from the box sets were Ken Wahl's commentaries that gave a lot of the backstory and set ups to the scenes that you would not have known otherwise.  Thank you Ken, for taking the time to do the heartfelt, interesting and sometimes comical commentaries.  I laughed along with you and enjoyed hearing about the series.  However, it's just too bad that they took advantage of you and your talent, the great Wiseguy series, and the buying public by cranking out this crap that slaps Wiseguy right in the face.",1271808000,81,1941,4.512893982808023

The ""Collector's Edition"" is not complete.

I enjoyed the set up until I came to an episode that began with McPike telling Vinnie that the case was over. This was a total buzzkill.",1271721600,20,490,4.136842105263158

So, I got it and immediately started watching it again. I don't care a bit about the packaging, where paper envelopes are used in lieu of plastic retainers for each disc, it's a non-issue, it's the show that matters. Still great writing, still great acting, still great characters and acting. Then I hit the speedbump in Season 2, when there's a huge gap in the flow of the series.

Did a little looking and noted that the Dead Dog Records arc is missing; yeah, I got all 13 discs, almost 3100 minutes of video, but only got 67 of 75 episodes because of copyrights and associated costs; no one wanted to pay for the rights to the music used, so they just cut the whole segment of the series out, and I fell for it, blindly.

Well, shame on me for thinking I was getting a single complete and iconic piece of dramatic history in one box, to be viewed and enjoyed over and over. I know, stupid, huh? And shame on Mill Creek Video/Stephen J. Cannell for getting cheap on something that I've really enjoyed in the past, and looked forward to owning when it became available.

For instance, the opening credits during the Lynchboro arc are the credits from the Turf Wars arc. And the opening credits on the last three episodes of the series (when Michael Santana moves to NYC) are from the earlier Santana arc, and feature Guzman.

Overall I'm happy with the set because it means I can toss out my crappy old VHS tapes that featured the syndicated episodes. But still, I'd pay good money for a true, complete set: all the episodes, with original music and correct opening credits.",1268784000,6,681,4.628099173553719

It's a shame because Wiseguy is a perfect example of how great TV used to be, but you wouldn't know that from watching these DVDs. When Season One aired, I knew someone who cried during Nights In White Satin. Without the music, much of the impact is lost. It's just a shame, no other way to put it.

4047077,5,B0030VANJO,"Its unfortunate that they excluded the Dead Dog Records arc, but I have loved and remembered Wiseguy for  the past twenty years....never dreaming that I could see ANY of those shows again.

I  especially missed  its star, the breathtakingly beautiful Ken Wahl, who played Vinnie Terranova, who left Hollywood not long  after the show ended.  So, Wiesguy was like a wonderful  but dim memory from many years ago.

So when I saw a chance to get most of the shows in a DVD collection  ( like 50-60+ episodes--wow!) I was so happy!  I won't complain if a few are missing!

Wiseguy was so ahead of its time. It should be on TV right NOW and it would truly eclipse any show going. All were great, but my favorite arc was the first one, the Steelgrave story.  Ray Sharkey gave an unforgettable performance as mob-king  Sonny Steelgrave, a delicious  snake charmer who almost pulled our boy Vinnie over to the dark side for good.

This series was the launching pad for an amazing number of stars--Anthony Dennison, Stanley Tucci, Ray Sharkey,  Kevin Spacey, etc. etc. And some of their best work was done right here.

Vinnie was gorgeous and stole every scene with his stunning looks and continuous struggles of conscience--a smart, sexy street thug who could be good and bad at the same time. And he also had a stellar back-up cast as well--every episode was riveting included many  top notch performers.

I have been waiting for the Dead Dog Records arc - patiently, waiting.  Now, we have ""the complete series"" with no Dead Dog Records????

What's the deal?  I know there are litigations, but the money that would be made by selling the REAL COMPLETE SERIES would help pay for the music fees, artist fees, etc.  If the artists won't agree - they were already paid when they appeared on the show, then let the fans know.  Then we will really let THEM know how we feel.

This is ridiculous.  Thank you other reviewers for letting us know that we would be short changed again - no Nights in White Satin (which is a fabulous song and even better when the Moodies perform in concert) and no Dead Dog Records Arc.  Why buy it?",1267660800,22,886,4.315151515151515

I hate when shows are released without music, but I went ahead and bought sets like Roswell and Hunter anyway.  Wiseguy is different.  It's one of my Top Five TV Shows Of All Time, and the original music is VERY important to me.  Especially in one scene from the first season.

Again was excited to hear of this new 'collectors edition' hoping against hope that they music was fixed and the Dead Dog arc was back in, but nope, this is another cheap attempt at extracting dollars from our wallets with a half baked product. Again I shall pass.

The temerity of companies doing this galls me beyond belief. Release the show, as broadcast, uncut and with all original music or just don't bother. This non collectors edition is just another two fingers up to the consuming public.

Be like me... don't buy it... and continue to not buy it or any other show given such a disrespectful release until it is issued in its entirety and in its original presentation.

4047085,1,B0030VANJO,"When Wiseguy originally came out on DVD, I was excited beyond words to finally see my favorite tv show of all time after so long.  Right before I went to the store I decided to check Amazon for reviews, which is where I discovered the most climactic scene out of the entire series had been massacred.  Any other episode I might understand, but for the studio to care so little about the show to not pony up the extra dough to keep ""Nights in White Satin"" in the final scene told me a lot about not only how much they care about the profit margin, but also how little they care about the fans.  To me it's the same thing as taking John William's music out of the final Death Star scene in the original Star Wars movie.  At that moment I refused to buy any Wiseguy DVDs, from any season.

Years later I hear about this collector's edition coming out, and again I get potentially excited..until the announcement comes out that's it's not a collector's edition at all, just a repackaging of the previous releases.  I can at least understand the Dead Dog Records arc because of the sheer number of songs and the editing issues, but one song in what most fans consider the most poignant and emotional scene of the series?

Great job to the studio and Mr. Cannell.  After all these years you still know how to put the screws to the fans.  I guess it's time to find some old VHS copies and convert them to digital format.",1264204800,243,1413,4.342205323193916
