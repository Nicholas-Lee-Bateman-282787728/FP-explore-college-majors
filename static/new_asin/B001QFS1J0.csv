3764898,5,B001QFS1J0,"Let me just say that I do not currently own the Bar Method DVD's. I do, however, take the classes here in LA 3x a week. After only 3 weeks I absolutely love what it has done for my physique. While I carry most of my weight in my hips and thighs, my legs have become more toned, I am overall much leaner and my flexibility has gradually increased. Even my flat booty has lifted slightly from all those awesome ""Pretzels."" The isometric toning is a great burn (weird, I know) and I actually look forward to coming to class each time to push myself a little harder. I've also learned that this form of exercise is good for those who have back issues because you're constantly engaging your core. The first class was definitely a challenge (I was a mess!), but over time I've noticed that my moves are more graceful and fluid. I wake up the next day sore in all the right places and I love that I do because it tells me that my body is really working muscles that I never knew had existed before. I'm a huge fan of the classes, but because I can't get enough, I know my 3x a week habit will start to weigh heavy on my pocketbook. I am definitely going to be purchasing the DVD's so I can keep my routine going. If you're a little apprehensive, I highly recommend going to at least one class so that the instructors can help you with correcting your positions, posture and ""tucking,"" but if you can't, I have confidence that you'll enjoy what the DVD's give you at home as much as I love what I get from going to the classes.",1285891200,5,1520,4.208904109589041

3764900,5,B001QFS1J0,"I bought the Bar Method DVD and I am in awe at the changes I have seen in just a few workouts.  I have always loved the way dancers bodies look and I will have one very soon. I have a herniated disc in my upper back and I have not had any problems doing the dvd. I have a bookcase of exercise DVDs and this is the most effective exercise DVD I have ever done.  I have only had the DVD for 5days, I will post again after a month.  If I could give it 10 STARS I would have.",1280275200,10,471,3.6435643564356437
3764901,5,B001QFS1J0,"After starting with Burr's Fat Free workout which is great, I decided to get her newest Change Your Body and Accelerated DVDs. I shoot for 4x a week (it's hard, but try). I am so happy I did! I have trouble with my lower body (hips, thighs and butt) and this workout has really targeted my trouble areas. I have been doing it for about a month and my pants are much looser & my butt is perkier. My stomach, which was already flat and is now ever MORE defined. I am firmer but not bulky, which I love. Also...call me crazy, I could swear I have less noticeable cellulite on my thighs!
 What's also great is that this program creates smooth, defined, elongated musculature. My posture has improved a great deal, as well as my energy levels. People are offering me these great compliments on how slim I am looking...so I am going to keep it up! I like Burr's teaching personality on the DVD's and I love how she encourages stretching. She's pleasant to listen to and not annoying like some instructors can be. I am hooked on the Bar Method. I should call it the Chair Method because I use a dining room chair as my bar & its perfectly fine! However, since I love the program so much I may indulge in a barre just for fun!",1274659200,24,1218,4.2727272727272725
3764902,5,B001QFS1J0,"I have a bulging disc and arthritis in my spine so I'm constantly looking for low impact ways to workout. I'm a fan of a few of the FIRM workout DVDs as well as workouts designed by my physical therapist on a BOSU ball.

Anyway, I heard about the Bar Method in my local newspaper. Another person following a fad diet and a fad workout program was absolutely raving about this DVD. I borrowed it from a friend and have since purchased my own copy. Let me tell you, it is butt kicking, heart beat raising, and somewhat addicting. In 5 workouts, I have noticed a physical change in my arms and waist. I have more stamina and I can feel my body changing. All you need to start is the DVD, two 2-3lb weights, a towel for stretching, and a dining room chair.

What makes this DVD even better is how it is filmed. Quite often you see the instructor they use as the ""easy"" instructor isn't ever filmed. For every move, the easy instructor is highlighted and focused on several times. It's also nice because while the women in the video are in good shape, you can see that the workout is really doing something for them as well (legs shaking, breathing heavily, and working hard) so you know that when you do get more fit, it can still be a challenge.",1268870400,13,1242,4.303418803418803
3764903,5,B001QFS1J0,"If you use this DVD consistently you will get great results. I hate lunges, squats, etc..so I love using the Bar Method. The instructor is in fabulous condidtion and has a beautiful dancers body, which is very motivating and inspiring.",1262995200,8,235,4.9
3764904,5,B001QFS1J0,"I really enjoyed this body weight conditioning video; I don't know much about Lotte Berk or whatnot, I'm an OLD ballet/dance/modern dancer who is now trying to get back in the shape I had as a dancer (good luck, there).  However, this is by far the BEST and most athletic workout of all the barre-inspired videos.  I have tried Pure Barre, for example, and while I like it, I prefer this.  I am blown away by the insinuation that Burr is 61...wow! Anyhow, it's fun and includes strengthening exercises for the upper body, oft overlooked in the dance world.  It also shows you how to do the exercises on the back of a chair; I'm all for modifications!  Very, very well done video.",1251158400,19,679,4.487804878048781
3764905,5,B001QFS1J0,"I have done Callanetics and Fluidity and I do like them both.  However, in my opinion, the Bar Method blows them both away.  I do use the bar with the workout, but you don't need one. You only need a chair, a hand towel, and light hand weights.  I just love this DVD and highly recommend it.",1240963200,51,291,4.0701754385964914
3764906,5,B001QFS1J0,"I bought the brand new (2009) set of DVDs at[...]. One is ""Change Your Body"" and the other is ""Accelerated Workout."" I am 60 years old and have tried many at-home workout videos and a few gym classes over time. I know that most of the people who are Bar Method enthusiasts are much younger and really into sculpted, trimmed, energetic bodies, but given that Burr, the instructor (yes, the beautiful woman pictured on the cover), is 61 years old, I was very encouraged to try it myself. I haven't moved up to the accelerated workout yet, but the pace and intensity of ""Change Your Body"" really works for me. I truly can feel changes in my body, particularly in my legs, buttocks and abs (which have been weak). I feel much stronger every day, and have more energy. I've been dragging around with chronic fatigue for years, and this is helping beyond my expectations. Also, I've been slowly dropping excess weight because of the fat burning benefits. However, I ready on Burr's blog that the beneficial effects of fat burning are generally for people who are only about 30 pounds overweight. There are some people my age and older that I would not suggest try this without going to a studio first to learn about appropriate modifications, but for those in relatively good shape who what to improve their bodies, I find the Bar Method workout DVD to be really excellent. And of course, the younger people are going crazy for it. By the way, the DVD SET costs only $30 and can be purchased separately at $20 each. More than worth the money, even in these ""tighen the belt"" times.",1237161600,107,1575,4.588652482269503
3764907,5,B001QFS1J0,"If you like The Bar Method Designer Sculpting & Fat Free, you'll love this.  It's a slightly more advanced (& longer) version of the first 2 dvds.  For example, DS & FF use either push-ups/tricep dips OR dumbbell work for the upper body.  Accelerated Workout uses both.  The principles behind the workout are the same, but I thought the ab work in particular was a big improvement.  Instead of holding your head and neck up until you just about die, you vary the crunch position by placing elbows on the floor, etc.  It's just as effective while being a bit more accessible.  I use all 4 Bar Method dvds in rotation, and couldn't be happier with the results.",1235865600,47,658,4.52542372881356

3764910,3,B001QFS1J0,"I bought this one because of the good reviews it had and like some else mentioned is good if you are just begining an exercise routine but is you are other than a beginner this is not challenging at all.  I will probably leave it for when I am not up to the challenge of my other barre dvds and do not get me wrong I am not saying that this is not effective its just a little to slow for me.  I know that barre and ballet exercises are really effective because I have been doing it for a while and my body has never been in better shape, I have been able to mantain my weight off thanks to exercise.  I lost 30 pouds 4 years ago after my last pregnancy and I have been able to keep it off.

3764911,5,B001QFS1J0,I love bar workouts based on Lotte Burk's method. I own several and rotate them for variety. This video has the best back dancing for those buns! I also really like Burr Leonard's personality.,1370736000,4,192,4.676470588235294
3764912,5,B001QFS1J0,"If you are old enough to remember high impact aerobics and old enough not to ever want to jump around like a maniac ever again, you will love the bar method. Burr Leonard has a pleasing manner as she leads the viewer through a complete series of moves that targets arms, legs, glutes and abs. All you need is a mat or rug and a chair to follow. I did the tape five days a week for six weeks while following a low carb diet last fall and went from tubby to sleek. Now after a long and sedentary winter, I have to get back in the groove, but at least I know that the Bar Method can do the job!",1370390400,8,591,3.8925619834710745
3764913,1,B001QFS1J0,"Save your money. Not only is this DVD over priced, it is not anything like ballet workout basic or other wise. Yes it does have a bar, but if you look in small print on the front cover of the DVD case, a bar is not necessarily needed. Its part of a franchise. The bar method is a catchy title, especially for someone interested in ballet and there is the catch. There are less expensive DVD's and texts out there that are far more beneficial. Better yet, try a local dance studio or college community Continue education. Don't fall for a multitude of 5 star reviews. If there is a series that comes from the same company that can be purchased separately, more often than not the reviews are lumped together making the items in this case the Bar method DVD's look more appealing and effective. Even if there are only a handful of negative reviews. Take a look at those before deciding to buy. Chances are you will find more of the truth than anything you get from 300 or more 5 star reviews. Very rarely is something that good to warrant that many 5 star reviews without something more suspicious behind it. So Buyer beware!",1370044800,10,1123,4.429951690821256

3764915,2,B001QFS1J0,"I bought this DVD because it received great reviews.  I have to say I am very disappointed with the DVD.  I purchased a one month unlimited membership at the local Bar Method and the classes were much harder. I feel like the reps were much shorter on this dvd and did not push your muscles to exhaustion.  This dvd might be good for beginners, but I think I will just pay for a monthly membership (that I really can't afford) because the classes are much better.",1365897600,5,462,4.348837209302325
3764916,5,B001QFS1J0,"For someone with hip and knee pain, the Bar Method has not just been a fabulous, body-changing workout, but it has given me these results without leaving me with pain in my joints. I wish I could return all of the Firm, Biggest Loser, and Bob Harper DVD's that I have purchased over time. While those are fine workouts, the large number of squats, lunges, and high-impact moves were bringing me more damage than results. The Bar Method has given me incredible results without the pain, and now I feel like my joints are actually healing.

  I have the ""Change Your Body"" and ""Accelerated Workout"" DVD's (purchased from the Bar Method site because as other reviewers have shared, they are MUCH cheaper there. Why so pricey, Amazon??? Plus, the Bar Method site allows you to preview clips of the DVDs so you have an idea of what you'll get.) The instructor, Burr Leonard, is focused on form more than anything, so if you're looking for loud music and a lot of yelling or aggression, you may be bored by her approach. But if you're looking for results, you should be able to get past that. (Personally, I don't like loudness, yelling or aggression as a teaching style anyway.) And the results come quickly. After just a few workouts, I was able to see and feel a difference in my body. I could see my muscles gaining definition, and my clothes were fitting better. As noted by others, I was shaking at times during the workout, but so were the instructor and the other participants on the DVD. The exercises are small pulsing moves which focus on the ""working"" part of the exercise. For example, instead of doing the full range of motion of the classic bicept curl, you only do the hardest part of the curl, and you pulse there over and over. I also noticed that she counts the reps differently so that you hold the ""up"" position longer. (This may also account for how you get such fast results.) And another great aspect of the Bar Method is that you stop and thoroughly stretch your muscles after you exhaust them. (I assume this is the key to getting those long, lean muscles we are looking for.)
For me, these workouts are the best, as I have seen results that I haven't gotten from any other workout. (I balance these workouts with the elliptical machine for added cardio work, but the Bar Method can definitely stand alone, in my opinion.)",1363478400,8,2342,4.558194774346793
3764917,2,B001QFS1J0,"Based on comments here, I purchased both BM Accelerated and BM Dancer's Body dvds. I found the instructor in Dancer's Body to be more motivating and easy to follow.",1361923200,5,164,4.689655172413793
3764918,4,B001QFS1J0,"Although this was a pretty expensive workout DVD purchase ($35) I think it's worth it. I've attended classes at a professional bar method studio for 4 months, and this DVD is definitely less expensive than the classes! Plus, I like the feature enabling the viewer to only focus on certain aspects of the overall workout if desired (for instance, the legs or the abs sections). The initial workout is a little easier than the studio workout that I experienced, but it's thorough and I still felt the burn! (In a good way.) Also, being able to use a chair in place of a bar was convenient for working out in my living room. I recommend this to anyone who wants the bar method workout without the bite to the wallet.",1361750400,10,713,4.492307692307692
3764919,5,B001QFS1J0,"Let me start this review by saying that I've tried my fair share of workouts (Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, Jackie Warner, Insanity, etc), and I've recently started running, which I love. However, I've started to feel a little beat up from all of high impact workouts I've been doing, and I'm only 29! I've been looking for a good, low impact strength workout to supplement my running for some time now. Core and leg strength are particularly important to me, but I can't even begin to describe how tired I am of doing endless versions of squats and lunges. Plus, my knees just don't seem to like doing those types of exercises since I've started running.

I'm so happy that I stumbled upon barre-style workouts, particularly the Bar Method. I purchased both Change Your Body and Accelerated Workout, and I'm extremeley pleased with both. Change Your Body is a great place to start, and Accelerated really takes it up a notch by adding in more arm work (I hope you like pushups and tricep dips) and some killer inner thigh work. Inner thighs tend to be a major ""trouble spot"" for me, but after doing Bar Method 3 times/week for 5 weeks my legs are noticable slimmer. My husband, after coming home from a business trip, even commented that he could tell I'd been running a lot because my legs and butt looked so much smaller. I just smiled and told him I haven't been running as often, but have been incorporating some Bar Method workouts into my routine.

I'm pear-shaped and have always struggled with my lower body. Don't get me wrong, I like my curves, I just wish they were a little smaller. I've always felt like squats and lunges just made my quads and butt bigger;  they never helped reduced their size. I'd actually resigned myself to the fact that I would be stuck with a big butt forever.

I've never, ever had results with another workout as quickly as I have with the Bar Method. My butt is smaller, my thighs are slimmer, my abs are getting more toned, and I have some definite muscle tone in my arms. I love that the Bar Method leaves me feeling energized, and I don't feel beat up afterward. I still have a lot of work left to do, but I can guarantee that I'll continue to do the Bar Method workouts. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a fun, low impact, and effective workout.",1358899200,32,2303,4.502392344497608
3764920,3,B001QFS1J0,"As a personal trainer and group exercise instructor, I like doing all types of exercises.  Number one it gives me new ideas and 2. if someone asks me about it, I'm familiar with the workout.  The only and a big criticism about this DVD is the basic principle of using large muscle groups first was ignored.  If you find that you are not able to do as many push ups as usual when doing this DVD, it's because she worked the biceps and triceps first.  The bi's and Tri's assist the large muscle groups, so if they are burned out first, then your large muscle groups will not get a good workout.

Other than that the exercise are well explained and do a damn good job of making you feel the burn.",1343174400,9,693,4.21969696969697

It is hard to understand her... I am familiar with Yoga, Pilates and Callanetics, but it is still hard to see or understand what she is doing with her abs and waist!

3764926,4,B001QFS1J0,"This is a change to an initial review I posted. I used to focus heavily on cardio and decided to put this into my rotation 2x/week. I can honestly say that I have never been in better shape, and it's only been a month. Straight up, BAR METHOD DELIVERS. Arms, legs, back....all becoming incredibly toned. Muscles I never knew I had suddenly are appearing! It's awesome.

 This workout is both addictive and really hard, although there's stretching interspersed with the difficult arm and leg exercises, so just when you think you can't do it anymore, you get some respite. You can also see that even the instructors struggle with the exercises (their legs/arms tremble) and this is very motivating - it's annoying when a workout video makes a really hard workout like this seem effortless.

Pros:
Fairly low-impact, easy to follow exercises.
Great for toning the legs and arms with long, lean muscles.
Instructor is motivating and funny.
Lots of stretching in between.
Broken up into clean segments working different muscle groups.

Cons:
Ab exercises are very hard on your back and neck.
Takes a few times to know you're doing it right.

I had to take one star off because if I do the ab section, I feel like I'm really hurting my back (even if I put a pillow under, like the instructor suggests). So I do my own ab exercises doing that portion of the video. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing about it.",1295395200,17,1405,4.672064777327935
