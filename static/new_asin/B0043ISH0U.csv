8414989,5,B0043ISH0U,"I enjoyed the other comments on this dvd- for me- a Rachmaninoff AND Rimsky fanatic- a must to have. The out doorsy quality that one reviewer mentions- rather than being offputting to me- was sort of charming to very moving- and I am looking forward to hearing the nature around Ivanovka- (if I get the chance to visit) where Rach composed a lot-I think of both R's as very in tune w nature- think of Rimsky's ""Snow Maiden"" or ""Invisible City""- their works are drenched w nature.
The ""Kashchey"" I had long been longing to hear-and was not disappointed. It galls me that Rimsky is so neglected in the west- we seem to b slaves of Wagner and Puccini- but, of course- my fellow opera lovers know there are many great neglected operas- Think of Korngold or Zemlinsky.
I sensed the influence of ""Tristan"" in ""Kashchey""-as other of Rimsky's works- simply magical! He is a progenitor- not just of Stravinsky- but film music- ""Harry Potter"" move over.
Wagner?- you don't have to move over.
The ""Aleko"" had music that I had not heard before-and I am sure that abridged and screwed up versions are done. Why? Do we leave out a bar from Mozart? I don't think so.
The voices are piercing- without the annoying wobble one gets from decaying opera ""stars"" of the west- these were refeshing voices- I had almost given up on opera- but then- here comes those Rooski voices- o so wonderful- so vibrant- the men and women.",1312502400,2,1404,4.575396825396825
8414990,2,B0043ISH0U,"It wasn't a bad idea for the Russians to decide to create lip-synched films of 2 short ""outdoorsy"" operas, but the bad ideas came from the directors & cinematographers who blew the chance to create something truly worthwhile. First, the color quality is dismal in both films & the camera lingers far too often on extraneous material (campfires in Aleko, greenery in Kashchey). In addition to the gratuitous ""frame"" for Aleko (the opera itself doesn't start until 6 minutes into the film), there are inexplicable & unjustifiable deletions from the scores of both operas - the Young Gypsy's Romance in Aleko & the choral sections of Kashchey. I gave this DVD 2 stars only because I value the opportunity to see (most of) Aleko - an opera I've always enjoyed on disc - as well as (most of) Kashchey (which I also have on CD but find less musically rewarding than Aleko).",1291161600,14,867,4.7105263157894735
8414991,1,B0043ISH0U,"For someone who revels in Slavic Opera to see an announcement for this video evokes major anticipation.  Well, forget it.  All my hopes were dashed to the ground on viewing.  They are examples of the worst of late Soviet culture.  In ""Aleko"" one doesn't know where the opera begins and ends for ""they"" have seen fit to have someone sing a gypsy folk-song to ""envelope"" the opera.  It's as if the Soviets didn't trust it.  They are both photographed in an outdoor setting leading to complete alienation for me. VAI has not seen fit to color-correct either of the magenta-tending prints of these 1986/87 films.  I will now not have any inclination to purchase any of the Soviet opera videos from VAI.",1287619200,20,698,4.672131147540983
