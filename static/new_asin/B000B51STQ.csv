8081374,5,B000B51STQ,Great visuals! I don't use this for exercise (treadmill/bike) but as a screen saver in the man cave. Since it is on an auto loop I seen a different section each time I go in the room. The soundtrack isn't the greatest but turn it down and enjoy the beautiful scenery. It would be nice if there was an alternate soundtrack of the ambient sounds as they were traveling. I've seen most of this collection and from what I have seen this review applies to them all.,1296777600,,460,4.2988505747126435
