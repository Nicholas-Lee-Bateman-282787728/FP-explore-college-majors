7868831,5,6304340192,"Abandoned as an infant, grotesque in appearance and raised by a crazed cleric, Quasimodo as remained as the most endurable character portrayed in literature, film and theatre. Biography has honored this imaginary creation of Victor Hugo by giving us a journey through his life and impact on culture.
  Victor Hugo went against the fashionable literary style of his day by creating a character who repels us to no end but at the same time gains our sympathy. The Hunchback of Notre Dame contains an endless array of political, social, aesthetic and religious issues that penetrate our souls and causes us to reflect. Contained within the story itself are the elements of torture, love, beauty, grotesqueness, and heroism that lend itself to theatrical and film presentation.
  Quasimodo is an ugly and pitiful creature who is misunderstood by all. Transcending his physical deformities lies a soul which is capable of love. The question is whether we are able to see that soul. Biography does an outstanding job in dealing with this question.
  Two actors in particular have defined the character of Quasimodo in film. Lon Chaney introduced him onto the silver screen and gave us a portrait of a brute who had humanity. Charles Laughton further refined the character but made him a spirit to which we can all identify and weep for our inability to see his beauty. These two great actors gave a powerful rendition of a character which no one has yet surpassed.
  You will enjoy this life story of a character who both repels and attracts but in the end shows us the goodness of the human spirit.",976492800,7,1593,4.874074074074074
