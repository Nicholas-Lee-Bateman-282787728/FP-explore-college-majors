It is not a big religious movie or a Catholic movie...even it is about a man's commitment to God and the pope who believed in his ability. It is a fantastic analysis of what it cost financially, physically, politically and spiritually to make the most beautiful tribute to God and the Bible known to man, the Sistine chapel. But I also love old Victor Mature, John Huston and Richard Burton's movies...all of which are classics. Huston's portrayal of Noah...and the whole movie The Bible , puts the recent TV miniseries to shame..",1370390400,5,705,4.648

4075486,4,B0036APHNG,"I remember watching these as a kid growing up. I saw the Bible in Lincoln, NE at a Drive-In Theater. I didn't see The Agony and the Ecstasy that I recall. I do know that I enjoyed them all so much that I had to take the opportunity to own them so I could watch them whenever I want to. My only disappointment is that I seem to remember them showing 2 hours of The Bible then having an intermission before showing another 2 hours. This copy was less than 3 hours and it seemed to me there was a lot left out. Over all, however, if you've never seen these movies, you'll be very happy with them.
