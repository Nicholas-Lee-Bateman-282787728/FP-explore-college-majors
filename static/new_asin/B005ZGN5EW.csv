8489635,2,B005ZGN5EW,"As a lifelong Prog-Rock fan, I'm always looking for new groups. England is well known for their Prog revival scene. This DVD is packaged wonderfully, with Pagan-esque cover art and the palm d'or leaves, it looked pretty classy. So I was totally disappointed to see such a no-budget production. The most annoying thing was a minuscule stage, if you can call it a stage, half of which appeared sectioned off with barely 7-foot ceilings! The low ceiling made for poor sound quality. There did not appear to be any money for a decent sound system or sound guy. The promoters were too poor to afford a real venue for this event, just about any pub hosting bands would have been better and it ruined the DVD for me. Let's get to the music, which was a real mixed bag. The impressive acts tended to be the younger ones, such as Dropshard, Nerve Toy Trio, Godsticks.  The Watch dedicated their musical existence to re-creating Gabriel-era Genesis, and that was captivating. Seyes did note-perfect recreations of Yes ""Close to the Edge"" but it was cheapened by the garage-band sound quality of the room and mix. Not impressed with Credo, who demonstrated that Prog can still be unimaginative.  The bands all deserve credit for devoting their time and chops to a hallowed but obscure genre, and that was the most satisfying part of viewing this, but I cannot recommend it for serious fans. I'm too embarrased to even loan it to other Proggie friends!",1344038400,3,1440,4.733067729083666
