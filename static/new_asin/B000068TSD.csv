1726233,5,B000068TSD,"The movie is a portrait of two women who embrace their masculinity in order to make it in a man's world, business. At least that is how I see the movie. The two women meet, when Stockard Channing's character has the one up position over Julia Stiles's character. As the movie progresses, the two women try to achieve a balance of power between each other but their inability to trust gets in the way. It is a sad movie in that the women can't really seem to bond as you wish they could. Stiles's character keeps pushing the enevelope seeing how far she can go with Channing. Channing bites the hook for awhile and releases some powerful anger on another male character, who in my eyes seems purely an innocent bystander to these two women's agendas. The ending is strange and thought provoking. This masculine world in which these two women occupy, is it worth it? What about Stiles character, we see the picture she took of herself, doesn't it look lost and alone? Didn't Stiles say she didn't have any friends? Didn't Stiles character act oddly when she was making out with that guy from the bar? It makes you wonder if men have played the upper hand with her as of course they had with Channing's character. In business, you have to take alot of s@@@ from men. I know I've been there, no offense to all the men who read this. To me this movie shows lonliness, isolation, remember the scene of Channing talking to her therapist on the phone. No time to actually be face to face. How sad! The movie shows metal,technology and bright glaring light as a symbol for this artificial happiness and aloneness. The women can't really be friends because of their life choices. Stiles leaves Channing with a memento of their night together and it seems touching in a way, at least to Channing, she doesn't seem offended. To those planning to see the movie, it has some intense scenes, the violence is not bloody but it is violence none the less. Those who like a happy upbeat film, this is definately not for you. It is dark and sadly touching. I got alot from the film. I am still thinking about it, I feel sad for the loss of feminism that takes place in the cold hard heart of business in the city. Time to watch some Ally McBeal.

1726234,3,B000068TSD,"While Stockard Channing is almost always great, regardless of the milieu (comedy, drama, stage, screen, TV film, et. al.), the same cannot be said for Julia Stiles.  But here, both actresses are superb, thanks to a mostly literate script and very intelligent casting.  Channing can do no wrong; Stiles is inconsistent in her work, but here is terrific as a temp taken on to assist Channing in a presentation, but subsequently fired by Channing--an executive--for showing up much too late to do what she had to.
There are interesting hints of what the film is really about throughout.  We see Stiles waiting at the airport--did she really miss the plane, as she explained to Channing, or was she intentionally sitting and waiting, just to show up late?  The subtle glances that Stiles gives Channing and the sole male character, played by Frederick Weller, show that she's thinking of much more than she shows on the outside.
Yes, this is a tale of control and manipulation, and the first half hour, sharply sketching the life of a senior sales exec--Channing--is right on target.  Stiles' introduction is also well done and the initial scenes of the two of them together resonate.  But with the introduction of the headhunter--Weller--the film begins to lose some ground.  The sharpness begins to recede and eventually, when Stiles convinces Channing of Weller's crimes, it has become an altogether different film.
Yet the differences are ultimately intriguing, because we begin to see what is really going on.  Stiles is super sharp; you get the feeling that she really doesn't have to work at all.  She can get practically anybody else to do it for her, while she sits back and reaps the rewards.  Though initially fired, Stiles is rehired by Channing and the two begin to form a bond based on Channing's guilt and Stiles' guile.
This is not a great film--hence the three stars--but it is curiously resonant.  One leaves the theater with a sense of mild disgust, yet later, realizes that the manipulation on display was, in fact, very well thought through.  An interesting film as a first effort for writer/director Patrick Stettner.",1011225600,5,2135,4.949579831932773
1726235,4,B000068TSD,"""The Business of Strangers"" explores issues all women either have or will have in their lifetime. There's power/control issues - what to do with it when you have it - and how easily you can lose it. Aging issues resonate throughout. In Channing's character, we see an aging woman fighting it  - she's obsessed with working out and fights her attraction to Stiles' youth. Stiles herself is flush with the power - and powerlessness - of youth. There's latent lesbian issues. Although neither woman is truly gay, they, like most women, experience a curious attraction for each other. The collective frustration with men is played out in the film through the women's drugging of a young headhunter. And although no harm is brought to the young man, Channing's character in particular has an eye-opening experience into her own psyche. And finally, anger and rage.  This is a film about angry women that doesn't patronize or characterize them as freaks. You will see yourself and others you know in this film, which is both gratifying and frightening.",1010102400,4,1046,4.9375
1726236,4,B000068TSD,"THE BUSINESS OF STRANGERS is one of those oddball, little films that will never make it to wide release, but should resonate with meaning for a particular niche of viewers, in this case veteran road warriors, especially those dedicating their whole lives to The Job with the hope of getting the ultimate corner office and the gold-plated executive washroom key that says 'Lead Dog'.
I haven't seen Stockard Channing in ages. Here, she and the young actress Julia Stiles appear respectively as Julie and Paula, road warriors for a major software firm, spending the night away from home, getting drunk and into mischief. The Board has just given Julie the Ultimate Promotion. Paula has just had her firing rescinded. (Earlier in the day, Julie's presentation to the Big Customer was botched because Paula, the A/V specialist required for the heavy lifting, showed up late, a victim of airline perversity. In a fit of pique, Julie sacked her. Now, marooned in a hotel together, they're almost pals.) At this point, a headhunter of Styron's acquaintance, Nick (Frederick Weller) appears, another victim of flight schedules gone awry. Paula claims to recognize him as the man that raped a friend of hers some years previous when all were together in college. Julie is shocked enough to tentatively condone Paula's ominous idea that they do something to punish Nick. What they proceed to do during the night to the unsuspecting fellow is the core of the script.
Julie has sacrificed a 'normal' existence on the altar of Her Career with the hope of getting ahead. Her best friend is her secretary. One supposes that she doesn't even have a Pet Rock. On the other hand, Paula is into living for the moment, and is openly contemptuous of Julie's life choices. (Stiles is especially good at role playing a cheeky bad attitude.) During the ladies' interaction with Nick in the wee hours - ""interaction"" only loosely describing what occurs - the audience gets a glimpse of Julie's repressed emotions, as when she lashes out with an ink marker.
From several years of experience, I can say that one of the things this film does nicely is depict the 'glamorous' existence of the business traveler: the missed plane flights, the sterile hotel rooms, the failed sales presentations, the austere airport waiting areas, and the constant need to stay in touch with the home office. It's no wonder, then, that Julie perhaps questions if her climb up the corporate ladder was worth it.
THE BUSINESS OF STRANGERS is an unusual suspense thriller. It's also a lesson in bartering away your life for something, and then thinking maybe, just maybe, you've been scammed.",1010016000,7,2642,4.939325842696629
1726237,2,B000068TSD,"I was sorely disappointed with this film.  Stockard Channing is supposed to be a newly-promoted CEO, and Julia Stiles is a young assistant with the firm.  While working together in the same city, giving various presentations on behalf of the firm, they end up getting to know each other while staying in the same hotel.  Stockard invites Julia to her room for drinks, where she learns that a headhunter she had been using (and who is also staying at the same hotel), raped a friend of Julia's a few years back.  Julia supposedly gets Stockard to try and kill the headhunter, but he ends up surviving.  It was a completely implausible scenario.... a CEO befriending a young assistant of the firm virtually overnight, drinking in front of her, and then allowing herself to be swayed to kill someone.  Not only that, but how often have we already seen films of women taking things into their own hands, and venging the rape of another woman?  It was total garbage!",1008547200,4,961,4.684523809523809
1726238,4,B000068TSD,"Most other reviews on this site missed a major point of the film: in the end, it didn't matter whether or not Nick, the male character, raped Paula or any friend of hers. It is decided  (by the filmmaker, via Channing's character) that based on the fact that he's a man, and has a smarmy personality to boot, he most likely raped some woman at some time -- and so deserved everything he got, if not more. This is a radical point for a movie to make, and compares only to Mamet's House of Games for a similar theme. I understand the comparison's to In the Company of Men, but in that movie the man who has been lied to by his ""friend"" is enraged at the betrayal, and pathetically yet controllingly begging his girlfriend to take him back. People who don't realize the difference between men attacking and explointing women, and women defending themselves in a way that doesnt get themselves killed, are pathetic losers.",1208476800,,918,4.530120481927711
1726239,5,B000068TSD,"STOP HERE and simply read Jeff Shannon's review for Amazon.com. He says it best, so I cannot improve. I can only add.
THE BUSINESS OF STRANGERS is a rich,rich,rich character study that is so ambiguous,that even at the end of this 84 minute thriller/comedy there can be an abundance of possible interpretations,and I dare say that they would all be viable. This film can be viewed over and over again for it's three wonderful and exacting performances from Stockard Channing, Julia Stiles and Frederick Weller (whom I had the pleasure to meet in NYC after his Tony-nominated performance in TAKE ME OUT in '03).In addition, the screenplay and direction of Patrick Stettner is that of a seasoned stage director,allowing the actors to hit their marks and to stay focused on the performances at hand. This is a very intimate film about the struggles and motivations of corporate people and their outward and secret lives. Only Stockard Channing's Julie has any kind of ""epiphany"".The other two,Paula and Nick....who knows,because that IS the business of strangers. The film builds very slowly and always a little off kilter to keep the viewer guessing where things are heading....very cat and mouse! FASCINATING and at a great price for an evening of fine acting and entertainment.",1198368000,,1276,5.052132701421801
1726240,3,B000068TSD,"Poignant tale of two eager women; one has passed her prime and bears the scares of the still male dominated business world of the early new millennium is aggressively portrayed to a 'T' (as in Tenacious) by Stockard Channing who is chillingly ruthless from frame to frame. The other younger, equally crafty, as well as wickedly sly woman is played by Julia Stiles who no doubt is cast by design to steal the glances of the male audience as well as opposite genders in this story of destructive payback.

Stiles' character is manipulatively calculating as she subtly unfolds a selfish plan to map a path to own success yet who's comeuppance could inevitably be in her near future at the hands of her adversary's lofty rank... or possibly visa-versa given that both become disillusioned by the cardinal sins of greed, envy and last but certainly not least, lust. Gets off the track a bit with the man-humiliation angle which may have went a bit to far but both Channing is stellar and Stiles is something to be reckoned with in this picture in more ways than one as both should be duly commended for their outstanding performances. Comparisons to Neil LaBute's powerful 1997 'In the Company of Men' are inevitable but still stands well on its own.",1197158400,,1245,4.7373271889400925
1726241,2,B000068TSD,"I enjoy films that can stand on their own two feet.  Films that are unique, unparalleled to others within the same genre.  While watching ""Business of Strangers"" a decently acted film boasting the powerhouse of Stockard Channing and Julia Stiles, I began to see that this film was just a continuation of several other films of the same vein placed together with one dramatic change, the choice of women as protagonists.  Now, I am not saying that there is anything wrong with this change; I personally think that Stockard Channing is a force to be reckoned with, while Stiles continues to try to find her true inner talent, but I do have a problem with a blatant ""cut-and-past"" work coming from ideas that could genuinely be creative.  Hear me out on this first, did anyone else - while watching this film, want to revisit a little gem called ""Tape""?  Or, bear with me on this one, I had a huge impulse to re-watch the film ""Company of Men"" after this one because there was that exact same sort of broodiness, anti-gender message lit throughout both.  Maybe I am seeing these three films in an obscure light, but the similarities seemed unquenched.

With that said, how did I feel about this film?  My first thought dealt with the randomness of the character interaction.  The fearfulness of Channing's Julie Styron seemed unprecedented, and when we witnessed her with clients, the decision to take her forward was laughable.  Was she as good as she seemed, or was she just playing the corporate field to better her advantage?  The other question that came to mind was her coincidental neurosis dealing with the sporadic meeting with her boss.  There was nothing, outside of moving the plot forward, which would have indicated these sudden laps of shame in her profession.  The drop-in of Julia Styles suddenly meeting in the same business setting (having never met before), missing a plane together, and coincidentally ending up at the same bar sharing drinks and eventually inner secrets, just flabbergasted me.  Why would these two ever meet up in a typical setting?  While I don't want to think that this was just a film about the imagination of Channing, it did make you question and use the word ""why"".  Typically I like this mind-boggling element in films, but in ""Business of Strangers"", it just didn't work.  There was no ""tell"" in this film, and that tugged at me the wrong way in this film.  The eerie patience that was demanded of the viewer left us with no moment of satisfaction.  There was quite a bit of wait, but no payoff at the end.  On one hand we have a very self-centered woman, career bent, but possibly not happy with her choices, and yet on the other we have a care-free young lady, experimental in nature, ready to change the world one person at a time.  It seemed too forced, too stereotypical - too manipulative.  I needed more similarities; I needed more shock to really bring these two strangers together.  This tried to be a darker rendition of ""The Odd Couple"" with drinking, rape, and random revenge.  Force enough onto a character (or characters), the audience begins to believe that it is a Hollywood feature, and you meaning imperatively finds itself lost in the trenches.

Let's move forward.  Acting.  In ""Business of Strangers"" it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest that I have seen of Stiles or Channing.  Their chemistry was decent, but it didn't compare to that of those characters in ""Tape"" or ""Company of Men"".  This was obviously a stage film, meaning that it was a small play that had the unique opportunity to see the other side of a film camera.  It was a boring premise, which is one reason I feel so fooled by this film, which was followed up by my second pet peeve of this film, it never tackled any real issues.  Who were these two characters that we so dutifully were thrust into their lives?  What makes them tick?  What is their past?  What is their future?  Most importantly, at least with this film, what makes them connect?  Unlike other films brought from the stage, ""Business of Strangers"" answers none of the above.  Perhaps it is my male view on a very personal female film, but this was released to general audiences, so the appeal had to be broad.  It was not emotional, it was not sad, nor was it victorious at the end.  While I do not think rape is a minute problem in America, I do feel that I needed more with Channing and Stiles.  Was she lying about the incident?  Was she just trying to get Channing to release something from within?  I wanted answers, I was pining inside for them, but the never arrived.  Unlike ""Shape of Things"" (another film that I feel fits within the genre), there was just something missing.  It was as if a big chunk of the film was misplaced.  Fred Weller did a decent job, but his motive was missing.  That, my friends, is the biggest element forgotten in this film.  Motive.

Director Patrick Stettner did his job by bringing the characters together in, albeit, random events.  He set the stage with surprisingly the darkest of corners and hidden hotel rooms.  There was even a moment of unneeded tension in a scene (while I felt it wasn't needed) that was done with some bit of grace, but he continued to forget the element mentioned above ... motive.  There was no reason to answer the question ""why"", when our characters were taking unmotivated photographs, when they were about to commit murder, or when they were talking to each other like they had known each other for years.  There was no reason for director Stettner to get us from point A to point B, so in my opinion, he moved the action along through a series for unconnected points.  Sure, the acting was meaty, but the words that they spoke merely were attached to a script which eventually had to have and ending.  For a little over and hour, I watched good actors read through a bad script.  Again, if there was more creativity in the motion of Stettner's work, then maybe I would have felt better by the ending, but I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat, the characters didn't have me questioning the validity of my own life, nor was I ready to gush Niagara Falls over the body of work.  By the end, I felt bland, as if I just watched a feminist remake of ""In the Company of Men"" or ""Tape"".

Overall, I wish I could say that I can suggest this film, but I cannot.  The acting, with enough said above, you should realize that these are two great actors working through an abominable script.  The story was pieced together probably overnight without much thought going into the entire process.  It was dark, but the tones were miscommunicated as we tried to grapple with the idea that these two people had never met before but spoke as if they were best friends.  Coupled with dialog that would make kindergarteners chuckle, ""Business of Strangers"" was a film packed with missed possibilities.  If you are looking for either a redemption film or a film about coping with your tough job, may I suggest anything outside of this film.  Mamet's vision of business is phenomenal, while I repeat more about Linklater's ""Tape"", will show you how a concept, done correctly, makes for a powerful film.

1726242,2,B000068TSD,"SPOILERS AHOY!

Disregard the glowing review blurbs.

Despite some good (if misdirected) acting from Stockard Channing, this unbelievable, mean-spirited and coincident-driven mess about a career barracuda (Channing) who joins forces with a young assistant (Julia Stiles) to kidnap and sexually torment an oily young businessman they both have a grudge against is a third-rate sisterhood-bonding mess that looks like a justly forgotten Off Off Broadway play, sorta a fem-lib Mamet opus.

Begins intriguingly but Stiles' character inexplicably degenerates from a hard-working young woman into a junior-grade Fatal Attraction-type psycho who inexplicably draws Channing into her sick plot. Suffice to say that despite dubious nature of their victim's ""crime"" (turns out he may or may not have been involved in a long ago sexual assault), Channing's character's participation in this near-murder causes her to take this young sociopath under her wing, prompting her to re-examine her whole shallow power-suited lifestyle. Yawn.

Channing was far more believable playing 30-year-old high school senior in Grease. Here, she's just a mid Fifty-something mired in Gunk.",1166400000,3,1161,5.771929824561403

I briefly heard of the film when Julia Stiles was pimping it on Conan a couple of years ago & finally got around to renting it. Yes, it's a slower movie, that involves talking & represents a short time span. If these sort of independant movies aren't your bag then side step it. First of all, I don't particularly like Julia Stiles. In fact, sometimes I find her downright irritating, but in this film I find her more interesting. Stockard Channing will just always be cool in my book. This movie's about one older successful career woman, Channing & a new underling who doesn't make the best first impression, Stiles. After the initial 20 or so minute set up the movie gets down to business with the women spending time together, swimming, joking & of course drinking. At first you're not sure whether they will be friends or foes. Then you realize it's not about that. It's about what happens when you let go & actually get to know (or atleast think you get to know) that stranger who you may not have a great reason to speak to, but you do.

I guess everyone does see the same accident differently.  I really dislike people who call movies ""excellent.""  It's so affected.  But this flick was EXCELLENT.  It's less than 90 minutes long (I like short movies) which is enough, perfectly enough, wonderfully, tautly, excitingly written, and almost as deep as you can get after ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""

1726250,4,B000068TSD,"Near the beginning of this imaginative film when Paula Murphy (20-year-old Julia Stiles) and Julie Styron (Stockard Channing) meet in earnest, Paula tells Julie what she really does in life: ""I'm a writer,"" she says.  I write short stories about things that I experience.  Nonfiction.  ""Fiction is too stupid, too neat.  I like the sloppiness of real life.""  What we don't know at the time is that Paula is about to improvise just such a tale involving Julie, a tale that challenges the middle-aged executive's lifestyle and her assumptions about herself and inspires her to do things she wouldn't normally do.
This is the ""business of strangers.""  And this is the story within the story.  Paula is the diabolical kind of person who is dedicated to introducing people to themselves so that she can watch them twist, a privileged, under-achieving Ivy League girl with machinations.  Julie is a community college workaholic who never had time for a family, or love, or self-discovery, a lonely woman whose life is a parade of sterile hotel rooms, anonymous strangers, alcohol and pills.  Although the story drags in a little in spots, the overall effect is edgy and fascinating, and the contrast between the principals keeps us wondering who is going to come out on top.
The action really begins when Julie, in an expansive mood with some booze and her promotion to CEO, shows some interest in the girl she just fired for being late to a presentation.  It's not clear what sort of interest that is.  Julie responds as a spider coaxing a fly into the web, but it's not clear what she's up to.  They go to the pool and play around, get on the treadmills at the gym and run.  They go back to Julie's suite and drink some more.
At this point I'm afraid that the film will deteriorate into a politically correct clich of some kind, or a lesbian wish-fulfillment debacle, without anything really happening.  Enter (or actually re-enter) Nick Harris (Fred Weller) who, Paula has confided to Julie, raped her best friend when they were undergraduates in Boston.  This excites Julie's loathing and so the two women play out an improvised and drunken revenge scenario that is a bit over the top, but psychologically correct.
After some intense emotional interaction, the film resolves surprisingly and rather neatly, allowing us to see that Paula has indeed spun out a tale whose moral might be, ""watch out for young foxes.""  The scene in the airport emphasizes this, with Julie and Nick sheepishly sorting out last night's bizarre debauchery while trying to maintain their dignity, with Paula poised brazenly in plain sight wearing earphones, a smug silhouette in the distance.
Patrick Stettner wrote the script, which, judging from the series of stationary settings and the limited cast, I suspect was originally a stage play.  He also directed in a business-like manner, getting a saucy and smirk-laden performance from Stiles, whose originality and talent is obvious, and a steady and believable one from veteran Channing.  Incidentally, Channing is a Harvard graduate who is perhaps best known for her performance as Betty Rizzo in Grease (1978) playing a teenager when she was 32-years-old!  Here she braves some close camera work that starkly reveals the 57-year-old actress beneath the makeup.  Yet, as always, Stockard Channing pleases us.
But see this for Julia Stiles, a thoroughly professional player, whose arrogant, sneering, and edgy style add spice to, and partially disguise, her youthful mastery of the fine art of acting.",1064275200,22,3528,4.998290598290598

1726252,4,B000068TSD,"""The Business of Strangers"" is a film that is either going to hook up, in which case you will find it compelling, or it is going to leave you cold and disinterested.  It is essentially a two-character drama, in which Stockard Channing plays Julie Styron, a business executive for a software company who spends most of her time on the road going her job, and Julia Stiles plays Paula Murphy, an audio-visual techie who shows up 45 minutes late for an important presentation.  Julie thinks she is about to be fired when her boss flies in for a dinner meeting and Paula knows she is fired when she hears Julie do exactly that on her cell phone.  But it turns out that Julie is being promoted to the top spot in the corporation and she feels magnanimous at this good fortune to spare Paula, put her up in a hotel room at company expense, and spend the night drinking with this strange young woman.
Your tendency is to think the Julie and Paula are women at the opposite ends of the same road, but that is only partially true at best.  For Julie the job has become everything: she is an ""uberfrau,"" to quote Paula, who is divorced, childless, and drinks scotch just like a man.  In contrast, Paula dismisses her work as ""only a money job,"" declaring she is really a writer, collecting observations of the human condition as she makes a buck.  Despite some rough spots, the two get along together pretty well, playing a quick mind game in the elevator with some businessmen, playing around in the pool during a swim, and chatting in the sauna.  But then Nick Harris (Frederick Weller) shows up.  He is an executive headhunter than Julie called in when she thought she was going to need a job.  He ends up stuck overnight when all the flights get cancelled and he joins the two women.  Julie thinks nothing of it, but Paula is very cold because she knows Nick, and when she tells Julie what Nick did one weekend in Boston, the move veers off towards a much darker direction.
Nick is just a pawn and not a player in this drama, mainly because nobody else can really fit comfortably onto the screen in any of the scenes between Julie and Paula.  Clearly Paula is playing some sort of a game here, but exactly what sort, what the rules are, and what it all means is unclear.  But the result is intriguing, from the time the two women start drinking double shots of the most expensive cognac at the hotel bar to the end of the film.  Even if we question the actions of the characters, most specifically in terms of their motivations, the performances are compelling enough to keep us along for the ride.
Off the top of my head I cannot think of another film in which an older woman and a young woman go at it like this; the conventional Hollywood film is more likely to flip the genders rather than the ages of the two battling characters.  I have to admit I was surprised to find the film was written and directed by Patrick Shettner, because that sort of undermines the idea that we are being offered insights into the psyche of the modern businesswoman.  But that may explain as well as anything while the end of the film strikes such a discordant note with viewers.  But you have to admit that few parts of this story take the conventional route and in the end the performances of Channing and Stiles, going after each other in ways I do not recall seeing before, is enough to justify watching the film.  There are really no extras on this DVD, but that seems to make sense with ""The Business of Strangers""; take this film at face value and make of it what you will.",1056758400,,3559,4.41743119266055

1726254,2,B000068TSD,"I went into this expecting a sort of cerebral/psychological thriller... but my expectations were way too high. This movie has two big ""surprise twists"" toward the end and both of them are so totally obvious and predictable that I was amazed when they were ""revealed"" as surprises.. I'd assumed that the writer and director expected these things to be obvious.
Example: ""Yeah that guy raped a good friend of mine."" [Meaningful look] ""A really, really close friend."" [Followed by a second meaningful look]
See if you can guess the shocking surprise about the identity of that really, really close friend...
More importantly, I simply didn't buy it. I get that Stockard Channing is supposed to be drunk and she's not thinking straight, but I simply couldn't believe that she would allow herself to get dragged into such a stupid/dangerous situation. Even if she were drunk. This is one of those movies where you just want to slap the main character for being so dumb.
If you're interested in seeing an intelligent movie that hits the same basic themes but does so with subtlety and class, I would STRONGLY recommend ""Oleanna"" (a two-person theatre piece by David Mamet; the movie version is superb!) or ""Tape"" (with Uma Thurman). These two movies will provoke thought and will hit you on a gut level. ""The Business of Strangers,"" on the other hand, can't decide if it wants to be a thriller (along the lines of ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle,"" ""Poison Ivy,"" etc.) or if it wants to say something about the role of women in today's society.

1726255,5,B000068TSD,"As a character study, this is one of the best, most unpredictable films I've seen in a long time. Stockard Channing has always been a fine actress, bringing a level of sensitivity and intelligence to every role. And Julia Stiles just gets better and better in each new film. She has character and grit; she's a bold young actress who takes professional risks. The two performers are perfectly matched here in a test of wills, with an insightful and devious script that never goes where the viewer anticipates. It's both a commentary on age and wisdom versus youth and nerve, and a study in values.
I saw this movie when it opened, (on a large screen) and the one scene I found jarring was the opening--a long examination of Channing's face that has, like that of so many of her peers, been surgically airbrushed to remove hints of age. But Channings' hands are very much a part of this sequence, and they are the hands of a woman who is almost sixty. It's a distracting (mercifully short) scene and I wish director Stettner had paid closer attention--focusing only on Channing's face. Unless Stettner is as devious as the film itself and wanted us to be aware of the drastic contrast between face and hands--a statement about the lengths some women will go to to remain viable, whatever their careers. Somehow, I doubt that he was that subtle or that clever. But I did have to wonder about that face and those hands.
That aside, this is a consummate food-for-thought film.

A welcome change to cookie-cutter endings and bland acting, this unique character study follows two women (Stockard Channing and Julia Stiles) and their brief night's stay at a hotel. The film boasts hardly any scenes before or after either character's stay, which explains its brevity. At a trim 84 minutes, the story is not bogged down by the women's history or future - just the immediacy of the women's, shall we say...situation.

1726261,4,B000068TSD,"THE BUSINESS OF STRANGERS appears to be to strip each other naked and spotlight the character defects that Friends would never address.  In this story it is unlikely that either of the main characters would have friends anyway, so caught up in their own driven psyches that they feel unable to view the reality of the world outside their tunneled drives.  Stockard Channing, once again, gives a bravura performance as a woman who has clawed her way  from trailer park trash to be the hardened CEO of an important company.  Her life is in her face, her sature, her under-the-surface-insecurity that makes her hard driven persona seem ready for a fall.  Julia Stiles, a would-be writer from a wealthy family trying to hide her easy ride into life behind tattoos and lies, is the perfect foil for Channing.  They begin as adversaries, come together for reasons of loathing men, and progress into a turbulent relationship that serves to reiterate  their inherent character flaws.  Director Patrick Stettner handles the story well and draws fine perfomances not only from the two stellar main characters, but from every actor utilized.  This is not a pretty story, but a cathartic one, and once again shows that there is nothing Stockard Channing cannot do.

1726263,4,B000068TSD,"Superb performance by Stockard Channing as Julie, as a hard-boiled yet desperately insecure person whose job has become her entire life. What an expressive face she has and who would ever deny that age can become a woman, just as it is said to do with a man? The spirit and atmosphere of an executive life in airport lounges and hotels is deftly portrayed. Julie meets Paula, a much younger woman with probably a different reason to feel distrust of men and although they come from different backgrounds, they interact well together and have much in common. The scene in the elevator full of men, where the two spontaneously enact a loud, sexually outrageous conversation is very funny. You can see Julie loosening up under the influence of alcohol as they drink together, while Paula becomes more aggressive and later they act out some sexual rage on an unwitting male victim (Fredrick Weller).
While we see a much more complete development of Julie's character, Paula is allowed to remain an enigma, through no fault of Julia Stiles. We get hints of former abuse: her multiple tattoos; her dallying with, and then violent rejection of a young man in the bar; her former lesbian relationship and her victimization of the apparently innocent Weller.
This is a fine character sketch, a piece of early 21st century corporate Americana (judging by her performance at a high level presentation, I would not want Julie representing my company!), with its rather decadent lifestyle and obvious lack of concern for human beings.",1024704000,2,1521,4.9453125
1726264,3,B000068TSD,"This film is far less insightful that the professional reviews suggest. The basic scenario - Stockard Channing is a pressured Vice President of a successful high tech company - rather predictably she is portrayed as having sacrificed personal happiness in order to advance her career; Julia Stiles is a lowly technical assissant, with an attitude; Channing sacks Stiles for being late to a meeting, but then reconsiders. Together for an evening's vigorous drinking, the two find opportunity to vent their feelings towards men as individuals and as symbols of the generic patriarchy - this being the pretext for the third character, Nick, a 'slippery' headhunter. And that's about it folks - only three characters and not too much in the way of plot, so one has the right to expect true character studies, an investigation of their internal worlds with hidden depths revealed. Unfortunately, the characters remain largely unexplored and this viewer remains largely unsatisfied.
 *
The look of the film is quite slick. There's suitably atmospheric background music, and a muted palette of browns and greys worthy of a television commercial targetting an affluent demographic. Stockard Channing commands interests through the strength of her facial expressions, while Julia Stiles relies on stragetically positioned body tattoos to do the same. All very nice, but an eighty-three minute  infomercial for Dewar's Scotch whiskey is not my idea of great cinema.
*
Stiles' character is especially unrewarding. Her acting moves within a narrow emotional range, and her delivery of the admittedly rather clumsy dialogue is stilted, everything interpreted in terms of a unmodulated confrontational attitude - the director should shoulder much of the blame for this. Indeed, she seems so artificial that it's tempting to think of her character as merely an alter ego of Stockard: a younger incarnation of the older woman. However, the film denies this possibility after a short while. Stockard differentiates herself unequivocally, seeing Stiles as coming from an entirely different background, with entirely different aspirations - so Stiles is her own woman, but her motives are as opaque at the end as at the beginning of the film - in this regard, several of the very unsurprising ""twists"" in the film are counter-productive, since they make Stiles utterly unknowable.
*
Channing has a wonderful face, and brings enough experience to the role to enlighten otherwise dim ideas - she can act. So we see her as an aging woman in fear of losing her job, a job for which she has sacrificed much; and we see her too as someone who has succeeded, only to find herself all too aware of these sacrifices. This portrayal, for me, was the highlight of the film. She is a very isolated person, and this fact allows existential anxieties ready expression.
*
Yet the intended core of the film appears to be the relationship she explores with Stiles - and this is poorly realised. They drink together, they swim together, they toy with sexual attraction, and they act out their anger against men. However, their interaction, which often strains credibility, fails to illicit any significant change in either of them. If I had seen only the scenes where Channing's character is alone, then her portrait would be complete - the scenes with Stiles add little or nothing. And Stiles, as already mentioned, never gels as a believable fully-realised character at all.
*
For a male writer/director to imaginatively inhabit the psyche of female characters is notoriously difficult - indeed, there haven't been that many noteworthy attempts; hence the justified complaints regarding a lack of great female leading roles; Stettner has made an attempt, and Stockard Channing has made the most of what has been given to her, and all praise for this. Yet the attempt is flawed, the film feeling more like an abstract exercise than a revelation from the heart. Why don't the financiers back female writer/directors? Catherine Breillat's version of this same situation would have been exceptional, and I'm sure there's an American equivalent of Catherine Breillat waiting for a (male) producer to fund her art.",1023494400,3,4173,5.16248153618907
1726265,3,B000068TSD,"The Business of Strangers portrays a bizarre triangle among two women and a man. The primary relationship is between Stockard Channing, a high-powered exectutive and Julia Stiles, her edgy, unpredictable assistant. Much of the film, with its small cast and scarcely populated locations (airports and hotels mainly, sans the normal crowds), has the feel of a play. Although there is some action, when the two women conspire to play a potentially deadly prank on a predatory male associate, this is a dialogue-centered movie. Stockard Channing and Julia Stiles give excellent, nuanced performances, and this helps us forget that their characters are essentially movie cliches. Channing is the successful female executive who is unhappy with her personal life --predictably, she carries a portable pharmacy in her pocketbook, which becomes an essential part of the story. Stiles is another kind of cliche --the ice-cold, predatory type who can be either male or female but who is almost a mandatory presence in independent post film noir. This film will keep your attention and make you ponder the dynamics of power struggles in corporate America and between the sexes, but after its over you may wonder what the point of it all was.",1022457600,2,1230,5.185929648241206
1726266,3,B000068TSD,"'The Business Of Strangers' reverses the gender focus of Neil Labute's 'In The Company Of Men', with two high-powered businessmen luring a male colleague into a trap - both films pivot on sexual humiliation, although in this case, a rape seems rather more justifiable for the revenge enacted.  Like 'Men', and other recent films set in the corporate world (e.g. 'Claire Dolan', 'Time Out'), the spiritual anomie experienced by the characters is projected onto the drama's spaces - airports, waiting rooms, business centres, luxury hotels, glass walls and, oh yes, ceilings - all hyper-clean, spacious, airless, chilly, anonymous; their soul-sapping pressure reflected in the steel blues and greys, their soul-imprisoning weight in the endless geometric grids and bars they impose on human activity. This is an arena in which human individuality is de trop, and the body becomes automated as a corporate machine.  'Relationships' are conducted at removes (by mobile phone especially, but also by unreliable talk).  So it's appropriate that the film's release of suppressed emotional violence should be inscribed on the body.
Appropriately for such a claustrophobic set-up, the film's movement is at once theatrical and scientific.  It is theatrical in that, as I have suggested, the mise-en-scene imposes itself on the drama; also because most ot this drama takes place indoors in long scenes; dialogue is given primary importance.  This is a limitation, but also a virtue, in that it prepares us for the screaming and kicking against confines, and also alerts us to the film's themes, the conflict between the individual and her job, the importance of clothing to dehumanise and to initiate you into the business world (and even as an index of character - Julia Stiles' are ruthlessly armour-like; Stockard Channing's are rumpled and don't quite fit right).  Like a certain type of play, the action moves inexorably towards a scene of extreme violence where previous evasions, lies or secrets are revealed and confronted.  But the director manages to subtly subvert predictability here too.
The film is scientific because the endless ditancing of characters through glass makes the viewer feel like s/he's observing some kind of an experiment.  Stiles and Frederick Weller are catalysing agents who are deliberately dropped into Channing's drama to see what exactly what will happen.  Characters plot with others and look to see what they think of developments or results as they happen.  Most brilliantly, there's always a feeling that there's somebody else beyond the hermetic world of the film watching, spying on its paranoid and conspiratorial inhabitants, like the warder of some giant panopticon.  The film isn't as funny or excoriating as Labute (it unfashionably seems interested in its characters), but that sense of disembodied surveillance, and a Foucauldian drive to discipline and punishment, gives the film its own resonances.",1020816000,,2941,5.357917570498915
1726267,3,B000068TSD,"Set in a world of emptiness and loneliness (have you ever seen an airport so barren?), ""The Business of Strangers"" is one of those instances where a film would probably work better as a stage play.  It's small cast and finite settings would work well in a theatre, but waste the vast potential that cinema has to offer.  The only stage characteristic it's lacking is depth.
That being said, it is a film.  What are its merits as such?
In a story such as this, where a young free spirit encounters a middle-aged corporate lifer, the tendency is for the audience to be made to empathize with the younger character.  What ""The Business of Strangers"" does best is to reverse this cliche.  Witness an early scene in an elevator.  Paula (Julia Stiles) notices the leers of the men around her, and decides to play that she and Julie (Stockard Channing) have just come from a problematic lovemaking session.  Usually, under these circumstances, Julie would become flustered and later scold Paula for her embarrassment.  But not here.  Instead, after a moment of contemplation (you can see Channing weighing the pros and cons of jumping in), she turns on her quick wit and give as good as she gets.  It's the first moment where the audience feels unbalanced, like the movie might actually have something new and provocative to say.  This unbalance, which is a true joy when it comes up, only reappears in spurts; the rest of the movie is an uneven blend of the banal and the sublime.
Julia Stiles, for the most part, is good in her role as an uninhibited young writer, working in a ""money job"" temporarily to pay her bills.  She never softens Paula; she's unwilling to give in to the temptation to make this mostly despicable character sympathetic.  Kudos to Stiles for that.  Unfortunately, she has momentary lapses of craft where a subtle moment is botched, played broadly and artificially.  It's startling, enough to take the audience out of the voyeuristic experience of watching someone's reality, making them realize that it's only a flawed movie.
Stockard Channing, as the yin to Stiles' yang, is dead-on perfect.  She's never filmed from a flattering angle and never well lit.  It's certainly not a glamorous part.  Julie, on the brink of the ultimate success of her career, has little or no success in her personal life.  Her secretary is her best friend.  Her ex-husband is 12 years gone, remarried with children.  Her own maternal longing keeps rearing its ugly head.  And her happiness is regulated through a Zoloft-heavy chemical regimen.  Even with all that, Channing still comes across as luminous, strong, dominant, and in control.  She says that repressing her happiness for the sake of her career was her choice, and she's not bitter about it.  Usually, you don't believe someone when they say this.  But you do here.  The character is complex, and Channing is up to the challenge of making her real.  Julie makes strong choices repeatedly in playing Paula's head games.  And even though she is scared and nearly trumped on several occasions, she has enough resolve to save face time and time again.  Channing gets full credit for making this tired little exercise nearly a pretty good movie.
Blame, I feel, goes to writer/director Patrick Stettner.  His first full-length feature certainly aims for relevance, but it falls short.  He tries to say something about the corporate workplace, women's place in it, relationships between men and women, sexual assault, sexual liberation, chemical dependence, rebellion, wasted youth, and repressed happiness.  But he spreads himself too thin, never gathering up enough steam to make a relevant point on any of these topics.  The dreamy way he plays some scenes was distracting, in that it undercut their reality.  And the musical score he chooses feels like it was ripped off wholesale from ""American Beauty"".
Stettner's only strength is in his casting.  For all her flaws, Stiles is still quite good.  Channing, while being head and shoulders above everything else in this film, still manages to fit in nicely.  These two women, with their fine chemistry together, make the film worthwhile.",1016409600,,4144,4.934971098265896

7964588,5,B000068TSD,"When we deal with strangers, we accept the faade they offer. Only with longer acquaintance do we see through the lies to encounter the truth beneath. For the stranger we see in the mirror, however, sometimes a lie is more revealing.

In this movie, the revelatory lies involve Julie Styron, a brittle single woman of power, so recently promoted to CEO of her company that it hasn't sunk in yet. Brilliantly portrayed by Stockard Channing, Julie at first is convinced that she is going to be fired when the board goes into a secret meeting while she is away on a business trip.

Terrified that she has been betrayed by the company she has made the center and sole purpose of her life, she contacts a weaselly head-hunter, Nick Harris (played by Frederick Weller). Julie begs Harris to assure her that he isn't looking for her replacement; Harris oozes unbelievable insincerity as he promises he isntand we see Channings brilliance in the way Julie accepts what she is certain is a lie without believing it.

Julies assigned tech-assistant, Paula (in another wonderful casting decision, played by Julia Stiles), is fired when she shows up late to the presentation which Julie has, cooly, given anyway. Once Julie learns about her promotion, however, she apologizes to Paula, and offers to pay for her hotel room. And now the business of these strangers really begins.

Stuck in layover-mode together, the two women begin to explore each others lives. Beginning with the superficial (Where did you go to school?), they swap lies, defend mental territory, and easily drop into quasi-best-friend behavior. Julie drinks far more than such a guarded woman would in the presence of a rival. Paula is exposed as a mental-manipulator par excellance. In their bathing suits, in an elevator otherwise full of men, she leads the older woman into a teasingly sexual conversation involving a black strap-on. Introduced to the oily Harris in the hotel bar, Paula tells Julie privately that he had raped her best friend years ago at collegethen calmly invites Harris into Julies suite for drinks.

From there, the film descends into a tensely-drawn exploration of power, control, and the truths that lies let slip. We see the steel under Julie Styrons brittle exterior; we learn the chaos that underlies Paulas outward calm. The story twists and turns, providing glimpses of each womans past. And Harris is, in the end, only the palette on which these two women depict their own desires and regrets. The brief tenure of such art (and the rejection of the self-revelation involved) is made clear in the movies penultimate scene.

Even with the sinuous twists that came before, the final surprise of the story left me saying, Hey! What happened? The haunting image of Julie Styron in her CEOs office, in the last few frames of the film, simply underscored the question mark.
