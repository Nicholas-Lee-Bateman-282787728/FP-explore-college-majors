This is an eye opening glimpse into the bygone era when cowboys were king.",1413244800,,199,4.2368421052631575
7830839,5,6302766680,"That lariat roping gave wandering cowboy Will Rogers a springboard to Broadway shows and then to Hollywood is a well known story.  The use of white-painted ropes and early slow-motion photography in this 1921 silent film, running less than 20 minutes, shows Rogers' talent.  Some of his rope tricks still amaze roping experts.  The film is a good vehicle to introduce Rogers (and roping) to a new generation.

This film can also be found on DVD as a ""featurette"" added to the ""Mr. Skitch"" (1933) disk in the 20th Century Fox Cinema Classics Collection -- bundled in Will Rogers Collection volume 2.

This film may be 90 years old, but it still entertains.

My family is involved in rodeos and roping and gymkanas, both children and adults.  We loved the video, but loaned it to

""someone"" and now want to replace it in our video library.

It is always enjoyable watching, many times over.",1097280000,5,462,4.6419753086419755
