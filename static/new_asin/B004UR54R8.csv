8442070,5,B004UR54R8,"Fascinating German miniseries about Nazi architect Albert Speer and his strange relationship with Adolf Hitler. Speer is played by Sebastian Koch (who starred in The Lives of Others and The Black Book, and has also played Claus von Stauffenberg in a German TV movie) while Hitler is played by Tobias Moretti. Most of the material is taken from Speer's two autobiographies, ""Inside the Third Reich"" and the ""Spandau diaries"". The series includes some documentary parts, including news footage from the era and contemporary interviews with, among others, filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl (just before her death), and Speer's children, Hilde, Arnold and Albert Jr. (the last, also an architect, and who until this film was reluctant to discuss his father publicly, is surprisingly dismissive about his father's abilities as an architect). Among the many supporting characters, one has to name Andre Hennicke (who played SS General Mohnke in Downfall) as Rudolf Hess. This compares very favorably with the American miniseries ""Inside the Third Reich"" made in 1982 and dealing with the same material (in that series, Speer was played by the Dutch actor Ruger Hauer while Hitler was played by Derek Jacobi). The series only flaw (unfortunately not a minor one) is Moretti's very weak performance as Hitler (this aside from the fact that he looks very little like the Fuhrer).",1419897600,,1363,5.228310502283105
8442071,4,B004UR54R8,"I came across this documentary/drama miniseries by accident, looking up the actor Tobias Moretti, who was the lead in the German crime drama Kommissar Rex..  But I have read Speer's ""Inside the Third Reich"" many years ago, and have read and watched my share of WWII histories and dramatizations, so I was more than willing to see a new, well-rated docudrama on Speer and Hitler.  A side benefit for those practicing their German comprehension, it is in clear, slow German, with excellent English subtitles.

This docudrama is both a dramatization and a documentary, combined, in that filmed reenactments, with actors, are interspersed with filmed footage from the time, and also with present day interviews with his associates and family.  It covers Speer from his first introduction to Hitler, when he hears him speak and joins the Party, through his rise as architect and Reich Minister, the trial, his imprisonment and post release life.  Much of the basic facts of his role in Hitler's Germany are well known, but Speer of course, saved his neck by being coy about how much he knew of war crimes during his tenure as Minister of Armaments, where it was acknowledged he was pretty much a success in that his efforts prolonged the war.

Few can honestly believe that Speer knew as little as he claimed about the exterminations when he was Reich Minister, and this miniseries goes into more about what he did know.  There's  information about the filtering campaign by his secretary and former staff, working for the Allies sorting documents for the trial, to present material most favorable to him and minimize the bad.  But more interesting is pretty clear evidence that even as architect, back in 38 or 39, Speer's office was, not a cog in the wheel, but the main flywheel clearing Berlins suburbs for his rebuilding of the city, and doing so by directing the Gestapo as to which undesirables to transport and freeing up their apartments and homes for displaced Germans.  His representation of himself as an artist who didn't hear and didn't ask becomes pretty thin, when you see the documents from his office as Berlin planner, orders to the Gestapo to pick up families for transport to free their homes etc, for his building projects.  That was new to me.

Where this docudrama became painful and somewhat tedious, was the badgering of Speer's now elderly children with these documents.  These innocents, were as young as one year old to perhaps ten when the war was going on.  They almost never saw their father during the Nazi years, and of course for 20 years afterwards, he was in prison. After he was released both he and they admitted that they never could develop a relationship.  So it really is rather ludicrous to show a person who was one, or six years old during this period a document, now very elderly, in some cases showing the pain of that lost relationship and the stigma of having borne the guilt, shame and confusion all these years and badger  them with:  ""Did you know about this?  Do you believe it?  I really felt in some cases it was elder abuse. Being Speer's children, perhaps even having sat on Hitler's lap when they were five, doesn't mean they were privy to or responsible for their father's crimes.

Another thing of interest was Speer's relationship with one of his assistants, an old acquaintance from Speer's college days, who worked tirelessly for him as a sub-architect and helped sustain Speer's family and Speer himself, financially, while the latter was in prison. Who also arranged for some of the smuggling and subsequent typing of the notes that became Speer's books. Allegedly when Speer was released, and no longer needed him, he was summarily dropped.

While this is more documentary than drama, in spite of the dramatized reenactments, and aims more toward information than entertainment, still it is a very good hybrid of the two.  In spite of some uncomfortable moments, when you see Speer's now elderly children struggling to control their emotions after some deliberate badgering to little point (what difference does it make what a child might have known?  it was just done for shock value), it otherwise seemed fact -based, and showed many interesting documents and brought out some new information I didn't know.

Make sure you check the region code -- you may need a region free dvd player for this.  But if you have any interest in the history, or in Speer, this is worth the purchase.  Also good for German language learners.",1407974400,6,4487,4.8479685452162515

8442074,5,B004UR54R8,"I found Gita Serrany's biography difficult to stomach. It read as if Ms Serrany was captured by the charm of Speer. This film/documentary does not make the same mistake. In allowing Speer to ""speak"" or more precisely his actions to be seen, the man is revealed. 270 minutes convinced me that if Goering was sentenced to hang at Nuremberg, then in justice-so should of Speer. But of course he did not. He survived a lengthy prison sentence and as this film shows, he came out to a rich and content life, where he re-invented himself and his war time actions through a prism of what he did not know. This close friend of Hitler who milked his labour force to death through the end years of the war knew enough to morally decide not to have such a ""ministerial"" role in Hitler's dictatorship. Goering was more honest. He knew he was a gangster amongst gangsters. This is a great and remarkable film and I particularly liked the interviews with his children. The gentle probing and teasing out of information. It is all the better for coming out of Germany. Enthralling watching. Highly recommended.",1366848000,,1095,4.678756476683938
