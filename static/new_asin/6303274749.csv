7842772,5,6303274749,"The Great Commanders  Horatio Nelson The Battle of Trafalgar 45 minutes

This is a very well done video on the leadership of Nelson.  Although the title says Nelson, it's not so much about his personal life.  We do get a little about his early and personal life, including a short visit to Burnham Thorpe, where Nelson was born and grew up.  In spite of this, the video really focuses on Nelson the leader at Trafalgar.  There are excellent 3D graphics that show the places of the ships during the battle.  There is also excellent commentary from naval historians. There are neither reenactors nor movie clips, but it is a very interesting and well-done video.  I highly recommend this video.",1130976000,,692,4.756302521008403
