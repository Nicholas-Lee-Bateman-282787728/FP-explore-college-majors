8689281,5,B00PULRPHK,"Thought provoking and incredibly deep. Dan Davies performance is nuanced and sublime yet as powerful as a train engine. The only drawback was, it needed a bit more from the Lakota point of view (also I loved the fluid sounding Lakota language but they needed to have more of it in the film) and it probably won't satisfy the person looking for gunfights and horseplay, but if you are looking for something symbolically deep, historically accurate and well-acted this film is for you.",1454630400,,483,4.831325301204819
8689282,4,B00PULRPHK,A well made independent film. Thought provoking and stylish.  Beautiful scenic photography. More satisfying than many large budget Hollywood films I have seen.,1437609600,,159,5.913043478260869
8689283,5,B00PULRPHK,"This small budget independent movie has won multiple national and international awards including Best Film Peace and Best Film Human Rights in Hollywood (in good company as ""Argo"" won for Expose and ""Lincoln"" for Democracy).  It also won the Audience Award for Best Film in Almeria, Spain (along with ""Django Unchained"").  It has received good reviews in the LA Times and San Francisco Chronicle among many others.  If you are looking for gratuitous gore and violence this isn't the movie for you but if you want to watch a movie that is beautifully shot, has a creative and thought provoking story line and an amazing soundtrack as well -- this is the one!",1424563200,3,657,4.79646017699115
