writing television shows now.",1362268800,,156,5.038461538461538

You can check out my full review of each episode there as well as my other more general comments about the series.

Also, be aware that when you buy the TWO volume set, it comes with an additional cardboard (very nice) packaging case to hold together the two Plastic DVD cases in one unit. This cardboard packaging has all the details of both DVDs on the outside.",1211846400,,637,5.479591836734694
7910294,5,B00000ICUF,"Set 4, Volume 7 contains what I consider the best episodes of the series. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg are both espionage veterans via ""The Avengers"" British TV series as well as appearing latter in the ""James Bond"" series of films. Mrs. Peel and John Steed do make a handsome couple monogynously speaking.
""The 50,000 Breakfast,"" brings to mind Ian Fleming's ""Goldfinger"" and that villain's attempt to smuggle gold from country to country. By the way, that's a nice tie John.
""Dead Man's Treasure"" is an interesting and memorable episode. Years ahead of its time, Mrs. Peel is compelled (that's putting it nicely) to operate a racing car at the controls of a simulator. If she doesn't keep the car on the road she is subject to electrical shock. This was a similar device used years latter in ""Never Say Never Again"" as James Bond and Largo ""suffer the pains of their armies"" on a virtual hologram game for global conquest. I do hope your navigator has a good map. Good hunting!
""You Have Just Been Murdered"" is just so bizarre an episode proving that no one can ever be completely safe from would be assassins and death can come from even the most innocent looking childlike device.",972345600,,1185,4.701923076923077
