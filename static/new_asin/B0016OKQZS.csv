3162099,3,B0016OKQZS,I saw this episode on the internet on the History Channel website.  It wasn't what I thought it would be.  It tells how the ice road got started and why it is in use today.  It also has the drivers telling some of the stories about why they drive on the ice roads and how the amazing engineering feat known as the ice roads are built and maintained all season long.,1250294400,4,365,4.112676056338028

I was surprised to learn watching this show that trucks cannot accelerate indefinitely while in reverse. I was also amazed that they can get stuck, sometimes flip over, and in general are not indestructible momentum machines that defy the laws of physics. Everything I thought I knew about trucks and driving them from playing that game turned out to be wrong!

Ice Road Truckers freed me from my misconceptions and I learned that trucking is actually hard work and the folks that do it are tough, interesting individuals living on the edge. Now I have a new found respect for their skills and the challenges of driving in extreme weather.

Thank you Ice Road Truckers.",1231459200,4,1048,5.8431372549019605

8263703,5,B0016OKQZS,"I really love this show,  It shows reality and what it would be like if I were there.  But there is no mention of the 8th season.  I even called and the History channel had no information, no one to refer to me.  I don't recall the last season saying it was a series finale, only a season finale.  What gives?  Plus, I get to see parts of our country I've never been to and probably never will.  How pwople handle different kinds of situations.  Where is the new 8th season?  Yes, O would recommend it to my friends.",1400112000,2,516,4.1313131313131315
8263704,1,B0016OKQZS,"""Ice Road Truckers"" is a thrilling look into an incredibly tense, white-knuckle job that happens to take place in brutally cold conditions. However, fans should drive right by this DVD edition, which provides a trio of features that should have been included on the DVD season sets. This gets one satr, not because of the series itself, but the fact that there's no reason to buy this for $12 when the full first season set is available for about $8 more on Amazon.",1391904000,2,465,4.614457831325301

8263706,5,B0016OKQZS,"I own the series and I love the challenges they face along with the danger involved and Hugh Rolland,Lisa Kelly,Alex Debagorski,sorry for the spelling,but these men and women have more guts than anybody to take on roads that a nut case would fool with. But i have to hand it to them they do a tough job and do it great!",1362009600,,319,4.245901639344262
