8514905,4,B0011TM24Q,This program was transfered from a VHS at some point.  The quality is fairly good for the majority of the program and only has a few instances where the audio drops out.  I guess for 1991 this is to be expected.  The special is hosted by Jim Nantz and details the 1991 March Madness tournament.  The first 15 minutes highlights the first three rounds with the remainder focusing on the final four and championship games.  Nothing is sweeter than seeing Laettner sink two free throws at the end of the game against UNLV to put Duke into the final.,1247702400,2,546,4.474747474747475
