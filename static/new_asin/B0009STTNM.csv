8307789,4,B0009STTNM,"If you are going to Alaska or Canada to fish salmon with a fly rod, this program will be useful and informative.  Jim fishes to fairly large pods of fish running up river, and chases the really big ones he hooks with a guided boat.

If you fish in the lower 48, this information may not be directly applicable.  Teeny has a steelhead VHS done by 3M several years ago.  The techniques of spot and stalk illustrated in that program are, in my opinion, be more useful if you are trying catch salmon in rivers in the lower 48.

There is not any information about beach, ocean or lake fly fishing for salmon, landlocked or otherwise.",1212537600,,628,4.379310344827586
