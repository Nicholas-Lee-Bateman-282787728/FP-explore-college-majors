Anybody who thinks they know or understand World War II and especially why the US dropped atomic bombs,  you really don't know and less you see this video.  You have to watch this and then, you'll understand. After watching this, as sad as it was to drop it, it probably saved 1 million or two lives among our soldiers and the Japanese as well. So you tell me if it was a good idea to drop the bombs?",1464912000,,572,4.238532110091743
8289463,4,B001CU9BSY,"This is a great video. It is packed with great information. However, I do want to pose a question to the producer (Brighton Films) of the DVD. They go to all the trouble of interviewing veterans from various pacific battles and list their company and battalion but NOT their regiment or division. What's the point of listing anything at all when you only list half of the important information. It seems very odd when you know that Brighton actually knows the ""full"" detail of the veterans unit. If you are going to go to the trouble of listing the veterans full name, rank, company and battalion in the video why not at LEAST name what division they were part of at the time of the battle to give history buffs important detail that you already know about the veteran. I know that other history buffs WANT to know what ""unit"" or division that the veteran was in. Just a suggestion for your next production.",1432512000,,907,4.536585365853658
