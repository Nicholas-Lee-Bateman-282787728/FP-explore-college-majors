8173531,4,B000CCT7ZA,"An even blend of hard rock with little dosis of psychedelia, funk and jazz rock, this incredible live performance from '98 (not '01 as stated by Amazon) is aptly subtitled Electric Lava Saunawhen you press play and the title displays on the menu (not stated on the box). The performance is so good Sony has kept this in press for a long time now.

Shot at a small Buenos Aires downtown auditorium in excellent 4:3, SD with not a plethora of cameras, but superbly directed and edited, it's just bare-bones concert footage and a bonus videoclip, with minimal in-between songs banter and no interaction with the crowd, which BTW is shown only when the gig ends. Spinetta (RIP) was one of the forefathers of the local rock movement, who decided to put together a power trio by the end of the 90s. He had had a similar experience+keyboards in the 70s, by the name of Pescado Rabioso (Rabid Fish) with great success, so he recruited an incredibly gifted rhythm section to relive the experience, playing some of the old songs in warped new, heavier versions, and a lot of new ones.

Spinetta plays with great emotion but he's not the most talented guitarrist and whenever knocks off a solo, most notes come off kind of muted after the solos start. Whether this is some very personal technique or plain sloppiness I cannot tell, but I didn't quite appreciate  that. Now when strumming, he shreds. Worth mentioning is he switches between 3 differently tuned guitar with fixed effects applied to them, providing a great variety of sounds. Other than that and that 3 of the songs needed some bass boosting, the DVD sounds crystal-clear and thunderous, to the point my subwoofer rested for the whole duration of the thing. The rhythm section is borderline virtuoso, esp the bassist, who yields an impressive 6-stringed instrument. The drums are recorded so well -in that every can and cymbal is perfectly mixed-in- and the vocals are OK most of the time, albeit getting a little shouty or buried sometimes, typical of live situations.

Would I recommend this for non-argentinians ? Maybe not, unless you're very curious about spanish-sung rock of eccletic nature.",1526601600,,2151,4.836956521739131
