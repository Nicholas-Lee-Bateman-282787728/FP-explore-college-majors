4234837,1,B003ZK4ZQC,"I'm sorry, I just didn't understand this picture at all. There were no Keystone Kops as I remember them. Silent movie with no subtitles, music that was just added to it, for some reason, that had nothing to do with the movie at all. It was just a lot of shorts spliced together to make a movie. Don't waste your time.",1416528000,6,317,4.213114754098361

4234839,1,B003ZK4ZQC,"The quality is bad, and on this dvd is no complete keystone kop film. The films on this dvd were made in this time- not more. :-(",1374796800,11,129,3.814814814814815
4234840,4,B003ZK4ZQC,Could watch these over and over as they remind me of years ago.  Think the older folks would really enjoy seeing these again and sure would help some of the children.,1366588800,,166,4.354838709677419
4234841,5,B003ZK4ZQC,"This is a must for every slapstick comedy film buff. I remember seeing these films when I was a nipper when we only had two t.v. channels.
Bring on some more Amazon.",1296950400,3,165,4.1875
4234842,1,B003ZK4ZQC,"Not only are the Keystone Kops not on this disc, but the films that are included were taken from bad, milky prints.  I have seen a couple of these shorts before, and the DVDs that I saw them on were made from prints that were in great shape. This disc is a total rip off... even at $9.99!",1286496000,26,288,3.9655172413793105
4234843,1,B003ZK4ZQC,"This dvd description and artwork are completely wrong!  There are 5 shorts and only 1 of them has the Keystone Kops in it for a brief time.  The cover photo is not from this dvd.  Do not buy if you want the ""Best of Keystone Kops""",1283904000,34,230,3.9565217391304346
8410525,3,B003ZK4ZQC,"Mind you, I'm a HUGE fan old the old silent films, so this is probably a higher rating than many others will give. This set of silents doesn't feature any of the ""big three"" of silents-- Keaton, Lloyd, or Chaplin. What it does have is Mabel Normand, perhaps the only female of the silent era who could stand toe to toe with the heavyweights. She isn't put to great use, but it was worth it to me just to see her light up a screen since we have so little left to remember her by. The other shorts range from bad to pleasant. But if you want to see a Hollywood that hasn't existed for nearly 100 years, this is a decent enough diversion",1516147200,,634,4.120967741935484
8410526,4,B003ZK4ZQC,Was expecting the slapstick Kops but they don't make an appearance much. Good silent movies but more humorous than laugh out loud.,1511740800,,130,4.954545454545454
8410527,5,B003ZK4ZQC,Just the classic silent films. Old with the 20's big band music. The real deal classics.,1493769600,,88,4.5625
8410528,3,B003ZK4ZQC,keystone cops it wasn't. Keystone comedies it was. so it gets a pass but no home run.,1476230400,,85,4.0588235294117645

8410531,3,B003ZK4ZQC,"As other reviewers have noted, this is not a compilation of Keystone Kops movies.  The movies were made by the Keystone company and perhaps this contributed to the confusion.  The first short, The Bangville Police, is the film which propelled the Keystone Kops to popularity.  I didn't see the Kops in the second short, Her Painted Hero.  Perhaps some actors from the Kops ensemble were in it.  The third short, Love, Speed and Thrills has three of the Kops in a short supporting role.  I did not see any Kops in the fourth short, The Speed Kings.  The Kops appear in the final three or four minutes of Wife and Auto Trouble, the fifth and final film.

 I enjoy a little slapstick, but this collection is pretty dismal.  Maybe a child would find a little of it funny.
I streamed these movies via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1459296000,,841,4.473684210526316
