4262673,5,B0045EPVO2,"FYI....most blu-rays are region free which means you can play them on any blu-ray player in any country.  I saved more than half the price by buying this from the U.K.  I now order all of my blu-ray movies from the british.  If the price is going to save you money, why not.  Besides receiving a package marked ""Royal Mail"" just added to my excitement. If you live in America then make sure your discs are either Region 1 or Region free and they will play with no problem.  My final price after shipping/no taxes for this collection came out to $20.21 USD or 12.24 pounds.",1353888000,10,572,4.3584905660377355

4262675,4,B0045EPVO2,"This review is going to focus more on the quality of the blu ray transfer rather than evaluating if the movies are quality works of art.  For zombie action movies, I think they're pretty good.  Anyway, the audio quality on all of the movies seemed pretty outstanding to me; got to love the lossless audio you get with most blu rays.  There was a lot depth to the audio track, especially during action scenes (which there are a lot of), that really engrossed me into the film.  The overall video quality I would describe as average for blu ray for the first 3 movies, while I would describe Afterlife as above average.  There were some scenes that really looked good in that last movie.  There was one big issue with the video quality though, black levels.

Black levels were not consistently black during the movies.  I didn't notice it during the first movie, but during Apocalypse it was almost unwatchable without adjusting my television.  Almost that whole movie takes place at night, so when black is showing up as moderately dark gray, there is an issue.  I had to turn the brightness way down on my television to compensate, at which point the movie was watchable.  The problem with doing that is black crush, now everything that is supposed to simply be dark gray is black as well.  But that's better than everything that is supposed to be black or dark gray being shown as dark gray.  The black levels weren't as messed up for Extinction or Afterlife, but they were off a little as well.  Especially since more of the movie takes place in light environments, I didn't bother to adjust my television for those.

Overall, I would recommend these if you are a fan of the series and don't have any of the blu rays.  I gave the package 4 stars with great audio tracks, good video for the first 3 and great video quality for Afterlife, and the entertainment value of the movies helping and only the black level issues bringing it down.  I could have gone down to 3 stars because of the brightness issue, but since you should be able to adjust your television to compensate, it shouldn't be a deal breaker.

EDIT:  I stumbled upon Resident Evil: Apocalypse on tv and noticed that the black level was totally off there as well.  I decided to dust off my old DVD for that film and yet again black was gray.  So it seems that, at least for that movie, the black level issue didn't arise from the Blu Ray transfer, but probably resides in the studio master.  I never acquired DVDs for the other RE films, so I can't check those out.",1351641600,32,2530,4.4901531728665205

4262678,3,B0045EPVO2,"As a fan of the Resident Evil series, I was looking to upgrade to Blu-Ray. There is a collection of the first 3 movies available, and I figured I would just buy the Afterlife seperately.

Then ... I found this collection. All four movies together. BUT THEN I saw the price ?? !!!!! Really, $119.99 and all it is, is the four movies, in their own cases, put togehter in an outer slipcase with some new graphics on it.

Don't waste your time ( and money ) on this, unless it comes down in price significantly",1333497600,26,506,4.260416666666667
4262679,5,B0045EPVO2,Of course I gave it 5 stars. It is Milla Jovovich and the zombie apocalypse. ONLY very small complaint is that is didn't come with Resident Evil: Retribution.,1487548800,2,158,4.678571428571429

4262694,5,B0045EPVO2,These are great entertainment. I think much of the zombie appeal the still exists was generated from this series from the games to the movies.

Yes the 4 pack of movies is in a box set and was sealed in clear plastic. Each individual DVD is also sealed in its own clear plastic.  The top of Extinction has the label tape on it.  It took me using a knife 3 separate times to open completely open the movie, and when I did.  Boom, No Disc!!!!!??? Not sure how that is even possible, some jerk and the manufacture packaging plant is laughing is A** off.

Also, while I am a gamer, I've never cared at all about the video game franchise so the fact that this story is apparently completely different doesn't bother me at all

The set I got is apparently not for North American release based on the rating system, I wasn't expecting that, but they played just fine on both blu-ray players I own.  The packaging and menus were still in English. I haven't looked too deeply into it, I assume they're designed for Australia or UK markets.

Being i liked it i went ahead and bought the collection.  This collection is a fold out instead of being case's.  Fine with me takes less room up on my shelf for other blu rays.

I sat down with a couple of friends, made a drinking game out of the movies, and honestly had a blast.  If you take the movies for what they are, dumb fun (and i mean duuumb) they're enjoyable. If you love the game series and are expecting the quality of the games or even the seriousness of them, you are walking into disapointment.  Best way to think about it, bad movies, but pretty good for a video game movie.
Also note that they are UK discs, but my PS3 had no issues with any of the discs, but if you have a normal blu ray player, you might want to double check and see if it can play UK movies or not, just a heads up.",1377216000,,719,3.9448275862068964

4262757,3,B0045EPVO2,"I think it's unfortunate that Amazon cleverly merges the customer reviews for the 1-4 and the 1-5 collections; this is only for the UK version of the 1-4 collection, the exact photo of which can be seen in the Customer Images section.

My only complaint is that the movies are all in one larger than normal blu-ray case. The case is of fair quality, but replacement is not as simple or cheap as for normal sized cases. I've read reviews indicating separate cases for the 1-4 collection, so it likely exists; however, the UK version prevalent right now is not it. Everything else about the collection is decent.

1 and 4 indicates Region ABC compatibility on-disk. 2 and 3 do not, but the case indicates all-region compatibility. I watched all four from start to finish with no problems on my US PS3.

I don't know what extras are supposed to be included. RE1 has commentaries, featurettes, an alternate ending, and the ""My Plague"" music video. Apocalypse has ""Game Over: Resident Evil Reanimated"" in addition to commentaries, featurettes, and some deleted scenes. Extinction has commentaries, deleted scenes, and ""Beyond Raccoon City: Unearthing Resident Evil Extinction,"" which are like featurettes. There is also a ""Under the Umbrella: Picture in Picture Experience"" that I didn't test. Finally, Afterlife offers commentaries, deleted & extended scenes, featurettes, as well as some outtakes. There also a picture in picture experience called Undead Vision. All four disks contains trailers, though none for the RE movies being watched. All four movies also come with online features that I did not use; Afterlife specifically has BD-Live and MovieIQ. These special features are what I saw in the menu, but I did not watch them to check quality.

The language options for the collection are... diverse. Besides English, there is no other language present in all four movies, either audio or subtitle. Offerings range from Italian/Spanish in 1, 2 and 4 to French audio/subtitle in RE1 only to Hindi and Czech in 3.

In summary, this UK 1-4 collection is a good buy for English speakers who don't care for separate cases. The other features are too inconsistent to summarize adequately. RE 1-4 Blu-ray movies are not particularly pricy right now, so if you are in doubt or are looking for some specific feature for a specific movie, you may as well buy them separately.",1366848000,3,2369,4.987341772151899

4262763,5,B0045EPVO2,"I put off watching this series for the longest time.  The other day I caught Resident Evil on cable and was hooked.  I had to watch the rest.  I mean, as someone who never played the video games, my review is purely based on the film mythos, and i thoroughly enjoyed these four films.  Are there annoying plot devices?  absolutely.  Is it a visually exciting film with great special effects and a phenomenal heroine?  absolutely.

Of the four, Afterlife was my least favorite.  Some plot devices seemed too convenient even when suspending belief.  Will I watch it again?  yes.",1358294400,3,576,4.717171717171717
