7975596,4,B00007ELLE,"In general, if you aren't into the occult scene then this movie probably won't make too much sense to you  - like previous reviewers have stated - as there are too many ""in"" jokes.  But if you like ""B"" grade movies that have `overthrowing the corrupt establishment' as part of the plot (by Magickal means no less), then this could be an interesting movie for you.

The events portrayed take place in Southern California (and not San Francisco as some have stated), around 1971 and the tone and style is very late sixties.  In the movie Simon is living in a storm drain for reasons that are unclear, but it may be that Simon has no interest in material things.  All Simon is interested in is his Magickal art and the end result, becoming a God himself.  As it turns out, the Gods are jealous and keep their power to themselves by means that are craftier than we mere mortals can imagine.

There is a Wikipedia entry for this movie that has this statement:

""The character of Simon Sinestrari was reputedly based on the public persona of the ceremonial magician and occult author Poke Runyon, a well-known figure in the Southern California Neopagan scene at that time.  Runyon himself acknowledges the likeness, and has said that the only major inaccuracy is that he ""never lived in a sewer"""".

In the movie Simon visits a Coven of witches in Pasadena.  At the time, the best-known ""coven"" in Pasadena was the ""First Church of Tiphareth"" operated by Sara Cunningham (aka ""Lady Sara"").  Though the movie pokes good-humored fun at her, she did not take it too well, even though several members of her group went to see the movie and found it all quite humorous.

There are several interesting plot twists where Simon makes a prediction that he doesn't realize involves him as well.  Then there is the vision he has when he is inside of his Magick Mirror that he doesn't understand the full implications of, until too late.

One of the reasons I like this movie is because it portrays the ideas of Western Magickal thinking, as I understand it, better than any that I can think of at the moment.  By contrast, I was somewhat disappointed with the `Harry Potter' movies on this point.

In summary I thought it was a good movie and well acted.  You have to take into account that it was low budget and done in the seventies and therefore you should not compare it to mega buck modern movies.  If you can do that, then you can enjoy this movie.

7975597,5,B00007ELLE,"This is an impressive movie about a Magician using ceremonial magic at this time, 1971,as opposed to, let's say, Alister Crowley at earlier times with the Golden Dawn at the turn of the century. The Wicker Man movie produced around the same time of this one has a more authentic European angle on Pagan religion and culture, but has no magic to speak of in the movie. This movie is convincing in its depiction of a lonely, powerful magician who is coming from nowhere. He lives in a storm drain. The movie is so '70's. The special effects are limited in todays terms, but the magic is real within the plot. It works to show he is not delusional, except you start thinking that he is as the plot progresses. The protaganist has a consistent view of his relation to the Gods (he will become one if he can) and his Magick, and damn the rest of the world. He makes bad ethical choices but it is all a logical plot with a great ironic story. Very entertaining for those who follow such things.",1170979200,,988,4.375
7975598,4,B00007ELLE,"Simon is an exploitation flick cashing in on two things: the California ""occult"" culture and anti-establishment druggies. For people with some familiarity with the occult and NeoPagan communities, this is a funny film. Simon (the character) is a vagrant ""warlock"" (the term he uses to describe himself) who resides in the storm drains at the start of the film. After being arrested, he hangs out with a young male hustler, goes to a party given by ""Hercules"", and sells some ""charms"" at the party. And that's just the first five minutes or so. Simon is a ""powerful"" magician (so why is he living in the storm drains?)who has a goal of charging an ""effluvial condenser"" so he can use it to become ""a god.""

The film is slightly marred by a couple of *very* cheesy special effects. But it seems obvious that the scriptwriter had some understanding and experience with the occult because there are just too many in-jokes for it to be coincidence. This is not a great film and its B-movie origins are unmistakable. And the use of the Latin phrase for ""Carthage must be destroyed!"" (""Carthago delenda est!"") during a ritual incantation is a nice bit of fun. Before comitting a particularly heinous act, Simon says: ""Guess this means I'm not done with the darkness yet. This should help.""

I give this four out of five stars but, for a certain audience (people with experience in occult, Wicca, NeoPaganism, etc.) it's definitely a five.",1104105600,9,1431,4.7894736842105265
