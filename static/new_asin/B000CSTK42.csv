2474070,5,B000CSTK42,This is how America out-does Anime.  Warner Bros.needs to replace the new Batman animated series on kidsWB with some animation that has even a shred of class like Batman Beyond. This series embodies the Dark Knight continuum and holds true to the post-apocalyptic/neoclassic style that the Caped Crusader is meant to have.,1135728000,5,322,5.1923076923076925
2474071,5,B000CSTK42,"I was HOPING they would make the DVD's for Batman Beyond, now that the BAS is all on DVD. This show makes me happy all over. The new Batman might seem a bit odd, but he grows on you quickly. It stays true to the older Batmans: like that all of the villans are not overly crazy, they are creative. And the story-telling is just as great, just as the BAS. Not to mention, this completely kicks the crap out of the Batman thats out now. I mean, the joker.... with Dredlocks? Bane is red? Just bring back the BAS quality batman, or this one. I'd be the happiest boy in the whole wide world.",1135123200,7,586,4.104347826086957
2474072,5,B000CSTK42,"Bruce Timm and his staff have done it again! A show based on the glory days of the original animated series that has become a staple in the hearts of loyal comic book and animation fans. `Batman Beyond' is all the greatness of the original animated heightened ten fold. It's got a heavier dose of speed, grit and action that will throw you right out of your seat. The villains are twice as vicious and armed to the teeth with the coolest powers and weaponry. The stories are well written and the actors chosen for the character voices are great. I still find it hard to beleive that the voice of the new Batman is Eric Matthews from 'Boy Meets World'.

The first season of Batman Beyond is a true masterpiece. Even though it's not the same Batman,  I guarantee you won't even miss the cape.",1135123200,9,790,4.404109589041096
2474073,5,B000CSTK42,"A long time coming, I'm so glad Warner Bros has finally decided to give us box sets of this show. We get all 13 season 1 episodes here, which introduce us to the new Batman Terry McGinnis, and also most of his major foes: Shriek, Spellbinder, Curare, Inque, a new Royal Flush Gang, and also Derek Powers/Blight, the show's Lex Luthor equivalent. Also notable are revelations to past Batman villains, namely Mr. Freeze and Bane.

If you liked the recent animated Batman volume sets, Batman Beyond is worth checking out. True it's a new take on Batman, but it's also one that adds to the continuity of the classic shows and portrays the same mature sensabilities, sharp dialogue, and fun action we got before. Old Bruce Wayne is a cranky extension of his younger self, and his relationship with Terry is a new dynamic not seen with the previous Robins or Batgirl. Considering that this series originated as KidsWB wanting to sell more toys and appeal to ""younger demographics,"" it says something that not only does this show not destroy the Batman legacy, but in fact enriches it and gives the Timm/Dini/Burnett collaboration something they can proudly call their own.

This set will include commentaries, interviews, and even a music-only track. I should note that this set only includes 1 episode that has not been released to dvd in some form so far. If you bought the previous releases, you technically own most of the content already. However, having a box set is such a nice way to own this series that I'd recommend you sell those discs off in preparation for this one and prepare for Batman...Beyond.",1134950400,84,1606,4.773381294964029

2474153,2,B000CSTK42,"Pros:
- The show itself is really fantastic, would absolutely recommend it if you liked the Batman The Animated Series.

Cons:
- Packaging: current Amazon price is $19.99, and you get a cardboard case. (Mine was crumpled badly in the corners.)
- No English subtitles, only French & Spanish. If there's closed captioning, it cannot be accessed if you're using an HDMI cable.
- Inability to skip the ""Previously on"" or the opening theme. Since I'm not going to watch 1 episode per sitting (I'm just going to marathon it), it gets extremely tedious to sit through the recaps and opening themes. These are 21 minute episodes, I can definitely remember what happened in the previous episode!

The show itself is really great, and I specifically bought BB because I watched it as a kid, and now as an adult, I've got the $$ to purchase it. It's just such a pain in the butt that the DVD is missing such basic features as skipping the intros, having subtitles in English, and having a sturdier case. I've also bought seasons 2-3 and haven't watched them, but they both have the same disappointing cardboard case, so I suspect they share the faults of the season 1 format as well.",1472860800,2,1172,4.6298076923076925

2474187,5,B000CSTK42,"When this series first aired I must admit I found it good but not great. The time jump to the future was a bit jarring, and the darker more scifiey tone took a while to get used to.

But then later came the Justice League series with the return to more modern stories with a few tie-in episodes to this series via time travel. For me Batman Beyond got elevated considerably because of this and now is part of a much grander tale.

I like the idea of an older Batman trying to reconcile with his past in a way, deal with the problems of aging, but also encourage the spirit of fighting for what's right in another person. I like the reality and frailty of it. So many other superheros are not ""human"" in that they don't age or get sick or die. But Batman is a detective first which means he is human.

Intro: Batman Beyond: the Future of All of the Batvillains; A Free verse Poem: an Article

by

Mark Walt Meredith

The creators of BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES had reached nearly as far as they could go with the waning popularity of the stories.

The popularity of the Batman characters in an animated series was reaching the end for that time and the creators needed to revamp the series to give it a few more seasons, and that came in loud and clear from the lowering ratings numbers.

Something bad just had to happen to, the Batman, Mr. Wayne, to give him obstacles, to make, Batman, a supporting character, and there needed to be someone to become the revamped Batman.

As in the comic book version of The Dark Knight Returns the writers on the show had agreed that Bruce Wayne having heart problems was a cool idea.

The creators decided that they should have, Wayne, get old and have the spin off series take place in the future.

The voice of Jack Napier/the Joker had left the series, the voice of Robin 2, the Boy Wonder had quit, as well as Harley Quinn's voice had quit the animated series.

The creators of the cartoons had designed a costume that was more like a second skin than a costume.

The costume seemingly had no boots, no gloves, and no gray tights.

The costume was black so that, Batman, couldn't be seen in dark alleys; yet the mask part covered the whole face.

The only opening for the new Batman's mouth was a small one that made his mask look like the mask itself had a mouth.

The mouth made the outfit look even more like the new BATMAN had ebony skin.

Some people in the past have thought that, Batman, was always a giant bat or some kind of demon.

That fact is probably because there are some times when, Batman moves so fast and stealthily with Ninjutsu that all others would see are the shadow-filled cape, cowl and ""those eyes"" with the white contact lenses in them.

Criminals don't get to see, Batman's, shadowy lower face nor do they see the shadowy gray costume.

The cape and cowl are shaped as if the capes bottom were a bat's wings.

Look at, Wayne's, cape and look at a bat's wings and the truth of this comparison is clear.

Since Batman Beyond has come along, Batman, has employed the use of claws on, Batman's, gloved fingers to scare criminals as well as a cape made of faux leather shaped to look biologically as if they were cut off of some giant bat...complete with fake wing bone shapes in the fake leather.

Batman isn't the kind of super hero to actually cut criminals with, Wayne's, clawed fingertips but the claws make the Batman more intimidating to super-criminals.

Meredith-2 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Future of All of the Bat villains; an Ar . .

In the future of the animated series Mr. Napier has disappeared for some reason and no one brings up what happened to Mr. Napier but ""now"" there is a notorious gang that is based in, Wayne's, city of Gotham.

Citizens of Gotham have to contend with a gang that robs people on the streets dressed as clowns and wearing Hallow'een' costumes.

The name of the gang is: ""Jokerz.""_

_ The new BATMAN the animated series was deluged with letters wanting to know where Mr. Napier had gone to and to have Mr. Napier back.

There were so many letters avalanching the creators of Batman Beyond that Joker's return would have to be a direct to-video movie called Batman Beyond: the Return of the Joker!

The makers of Batman Beyond talked to the voice actor that used to play Mr. Napier in BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES who happened to be Mark Hamil.

The creators of the Batman series told Hamil about the flood of letters that came in and the creators of the spin-off called Batman Beyond practically begged Hamil to work with the creators once again one last time as a guest appearance in the makers of Batman Beyonds' movie and Hamil said, ""yes!""

The makers of Batman Beyond asked the voice of Harley Quinn the Harlequin to come back as a guest star also and she agreed as well.

In the beginning of the ""direct to DVD"" ""Jokerz"" are being led ""in the background"" by a ""Mr. Napier/Joker"" that wears all black and short, greased back green hair.

It is a revamped ""Mr. Napier"" of the future that knows everything about, Wayne,...somehow.

It turns out that by the future ... Mr. Napier had been killed by being electrocuted by Timothy Drake Robin 2.

Mr. Napier had brainwashed Tim Drake into the evil ""Joker, Junior.""

During the final conflict at the destroyed Arkham Asylum ... Harley Quinn fell into a pit and supposedly died even though, Batman could never find the body of ""Harley Quinn.""

The Harlequin as a super villain had never been seen again.

In the end of the original Mr. Napier's last battle ""Joker, Junior"" finally turned on Mr. Napier as Tim Drake began laughing and crying, with two electric cables electrocuted Mr. Napier.

After that battle Tim Drake quit being Robin Boy Wonder, there was never a Robin Boy Wonder again.

Tim Drake blamed, Wayne, for the traumatic event and hadn't talked to, Batman, since that.

Batman had never tried to talk to Tim Drake after that..., Batman, blaming himself.

Tim Drake moved to another city and got a job fixing satellite dishes.

Batman never fixed things between, Batman, and Tim Drake.

Mr. Napier had put a tiny, metallic ""dot"" on Tim Drake with circuitry in it holding the ""sum total"" of Joker's personality that would change Tim Drake into ""Joker"" 2 in the future.

The Royal Flush Gang was in the cartoon named THE SUPER FRIENDS as a disguised man named only the King formed and gathered one-by-one a team called only Royal Flush Gang.

When King and after he created Royal Flush Gang...King revealed he was secretly ""Joker!""

Royal Flush Gang happened to be in BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES and, Batman, stopped Royal Flush Gang for a long time though eventually obviously they had reformed.

Royal Flush Gang had members like King, Ten, Ace and Jack.

By the ""future"" of Batman Beyond the leader of Royal Flush Gang was Jack who had by then become the King II.

Ace II was still the un-aging hulking android with all of the weaknesses of the Justice League of America: New Frontier built into Ace II's powers.

Ace II can change Ace II's surface to yellow for the Green Lantern and can use fire against, Batman, the Martian Manhunter.

The King II had hired a new bloodthirsty Jack II, the King III's new wife had become the Queen II and the King II's new daughter ""was become"" the new Ten.

Meredith-3 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Future of All of the Batvil . .

Meredith-4 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Future of All of the Bat . .

_ Mr. ""Freeze"" Victor Freis had gotten a disease in the past and had he frozen solid until humanity could find a cure for this disease.

By the time of the animated spin off Batman Beyond, mankind had found a cure and had unfrozen Freeze to cure Freeze.

Batman MacGuiness had shadowed him to see if he was on the ""straight-and narrow"" or not and the events turned out to be Freeze had turned over a new leaf.

 the future, there was an outbreak of designer drugs that had been outlawed by that point in time.

 The future had the abuse of a steroid that was used by, Batman's, old enemy to make ""Bane"" super-strong and more cunning.

The drug was called Venom and by that time, it had been synthesized into a patch form that could be absorbed into the skin.

Once the jocks in high school had slapped one of those Venom patches on their arms...the veins leading from the area of the patch would stand out immediately and the Venom abuser in general would become human looking hulks twice their size.

Batmanwent to find the source of the illegal patches.

Batmantraveled to the residence of ""Bane..."" ... and sneaked through the security guarding his mansion.

Batmangot through to ""Bane...""..., and then Mr. McGuiness saw that Bane was wearing an oxygen mask; unhealthily scrawny; lanky and sitting in a love seat, unresponsive.

When a Doctor saw young Batman...... ... Batman asked, ""What happened to him""?!

Meredith-5 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Fu . .

The guard said, ""Too many years on Venom"".

_Mr. MacGuiness went out and found the real distributor of the patches who wasn't Bane, stopping the flow of the dangerous drug forever.

One of ""Jokerz'"" gang is a ""more modern"" version of Jonathan Crane the Scarecrow from the movie THE DARK KNIGHT and BATMAN BEGINS.

He wears a scarecrow Halloween' outfit and keeps weapons in a plastic Jack O lantern with a carrying handle that the Jack O lantern hangs from.

_Spellbinder from BATMAN IN DETECTIVE COMICS the comic book series shows up the time of Batman Beyond as well.

Instead of being a corny supercriminal from the 60's with an eye design on his mask forehead, a swirl insignia on Spellbinder's chest and a red costume ... Spellbinder in Batman Beyond has a full face mask with a red and black swirl design that continues down Spellbinder's skin tight bodysuit like an ""insane"" Spider-Man.

On his palm is an eye design that Spellbinder used to hypnotize people. . .

2474328,5,B000CSTK42,"I've looked around for this series and could only find it on bootleg sites around he world - until now...  Having watched the entire series now, I still think the writers did a very good job creating a new storyline for Batman.  All new villains (for some reason I really like Inque), although some old-school bad guys are still around - which makes for some interesting twists and turns.

The animation is very good, in line with the Batman, Superman, Justice League series from the 1990s/2000s.  If you've never seen it , you're in for a treat.

The only things I didn't like about the series are minor.  For one - like all superhero shows - only the hero can hit his target in one shot.  The bad guys (and cops for that matter) cannot hit the side of barn at 20 paces.  Police will open fire at the drop of a hat, firing 20-30 shots apiece - all to stop a bad guy who isn't fazed.

Second, Batman's identity gets revealed a bit too much.  By the end of the series, at least 8 people know who Batman is - kind of takes the mystique of being ""secret"".

Third, the series does have some ongoing story lines - like that between Terry McGinnis and his girlfiend Dana, but the show mostly a collection of adventures some with connections to previous stories, other episodes seem disconnected from the rest of the series.

Overall - this is an entertaining series for kids of all ages.",1370649600,,1381,4.393700787401575

For those who don't know. This series takes place in the same continuity as Batman: the Animated Series albeit several years into the future. Bruce Wayne is now an old man and has retired from being Batman. Then enters Terry McGuiness whose father has just been murdered. Terry goes after a Joker gang who killed him and gets into a fight with them that ends up coincidentally at Wayne Manor. Bruce rescues him and Terry eventually becomes Batman.

I love old Bruce!! I am also beyond happy that Kevin Conroy voiced him! And Terry reminds me of the young, smart mouthed Robins of yore, so I can't imagine he would be unlikeable to longtime batfans.

2474348,4,B000CSTK42,"Over several birthdays and Christmases in the past five years, my wife and dad bought me the Batman: The Animated Series DVDs and I absolutely loved watching them. When I was finished I wanted something more. As a kid, I remembered hating Batman Beyond because it replaced B:TAS. In fact, I refused to watch it. However, to satiate my appetite for more Batman, I decided to give it a try.

Going into it blind having never seen the original airings, my expectations were fairly low. However, I got hooked right with the first few episodes. This stories in this show are very different from B:TAS. There aren't really any supervillians on the level of the Joker and the like. However, I found that Bruce Wayne made the show. Without Bruce mentoring Terry, I think this show would be much less appealing. Terry as Batman is very different from Bruce as Batman. He is much less physically imposing and not half the detective but with Bruce's help he gets the job done.

I find Batman Beyond almost as entertaining as the fourth volume of B:TAS (The New Adventures of Batman and Robin). Being that the series is reasonably priced, I soon bought all three volumes of Batman Beyond and have enjoyed them. As with the Fourth Volume of B:TAS, the Third Volume of Batman Beyond gets a little lazy in the plot department but it is still good Batman fun.

Overall, as a huge fan of B:TAS throughout my life, I was very pleased with Batman Beyond.",1348531200,3,1435,4.59765625
2474349,5,B000CSTK42,"Batman Beyond is probably my favorite TV show. It paints a very dark picture of the future, which actually seems quite plausible in some respects. Among other things, the show examines what could happen as a result of overly powerful corporations, advances in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and the merging of man and machine. For a kid's show, it is surprisingly intellectually stimulating.

Furthermore, unlike other children's shows, Batman Beyond stays away from the stereotypical good vs. evil, hero vs. villain dichotomy. The show often presents the viewer with highly morally ambiguous situations. For example, often times, the ""villain"" in an episode might just really be a product of forces outside of his control; he may even be trying to do what is right. Batman Beyond introduces some original villains, who are pretty interesting and unique (and at times, pretty creepy). It also brings back a few older villains from the original Batman, often giving a fresh perspective on their characters.

Batman Beyond has crisp, engaging animation. It uses darker visuals to match the overall feel of the show. The music is absolutely great, especially the futuristic instrumental metal. It always matches the action of the scenes perfectly.

Overall, I highly recommend Batman Beyond. It is a great continuation of the Batman series and will definitely be an interesting experience to enjoy.",1348012800,,1410,5.342342342342342

But you'll get some entertaining sci-fi/super-hero combo episodes that have a few characters from the old Batman the Animated Series (a non-paralyzed Batgirl's and Batman's alter-identities Barbara and Bruce are the most notable).

The most enjoyable parts of the series are when Bruce Wayne gets into the action. He can't do much, but when he acts, you realize just how much better at Batmanning he was than the new one. And the new Batman knows this and he tries to grow into a better man and better hero with Bruce as his mentor.

It's really quite enjoyable.

With all the electronic high tech devices the new dark knight still needs Bruce Wayne to guide him.

What impressed me was the quality of the writing and the adult themes touched upon in this show.  It can be watched by adults as well as kids.  The music soundtrack also helps the futuristic atmosphere and moves the drama along in the show.

2474371,5,B000CSTK42,"I know it may be sacrilege, but I think Batman beyond is my favorite Batman. I completely love all the other Batman cartoons, with the possible exception of the Batman which I never got to watch much.

The story follows a troubled teen whose father is killed after Bruce Wayne has retired as Batman. I won't spoil anything for you, but the kid falls in with Bruce Wayne and eventually becomes the new Batman. I like it because it's sort of takes the best bits of Spiderman, a kid without a whole lot of money and with his own problems, and flawlessly merges it with the financial backing of Bruce Wayne and thus explains how he has all the gadgets. The new Batman suit is just simply awesome, though purists may not be happy because it has more features like a jet pack and invisibility than your traditional Batman costume. In essence the whole suit is the utility belt.

There are a handful of characters brought over from the old Batman series, but since this one takes place a good distance in the future they could only bring characters they could explain. For example, in one episode Mr. freeze is brought back but that's explained by his slow metabolism making him virtually immortal. The Joker also makes a return, in an unexpected way, but that isn't actually in the series that's the return of the Joker movie which I'd also recommend. The new villains they created for the series were pretty good. My only regret is they got only about three seasons to show them off. I heard that the show was canceled because they needed the animators for the Justice league series, which ran for about four years including the two seasons of Justice league Unlimited.

Whenever reviewing a cartoon series, I was like to add a comment about the females in the show. Anyway, with Batman beyond the animation makes the women look a little scrawny. Legs and bodies are a little too angular and not all that attractive. The same is true for the men I guess, but I don't swing that way so I can't say for sure. That's all, just if expecting the women to look like they do in the other Batman series you'll be disappointed.

Do yourself a favor, if you enjoy Batman at all give the series a try and you'll eventually buy all three seasons. Even if you don't agree with me that it's the best or that it's not ""truly Batman"", it's a great cartoon series in its own right.",1296691200,,2359,4.47906976744186

2474376,5,B000CSTK42,"After the success of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Bros. approached Paul Dini and Bruce Timm to create a new Batman series.  WB wanted the next-generation Dark Knight to be a child with a suped-up motorcycle because they felt it would appeal to new, younger viewers. That idea didn't fly with Dini and Timm, so they reworked the premise and came up with Batman Beyond, a surprisingly dark, unexpected take on Bruce Wayne's successor to the Bat-mantle.

Set a good thirty years in the future, Bruce Wayne has retired from crimefighting after suffering a heart attack during what should have been a routine rescue mission for the seasoned superhero like him. The aging Batman manages to get away, but is forced to use a gun to threaten a thug, something he's never had to do in all his years of battling Gotham City's mobsters and madmen. Ashamed, he hangs up the Batsuit and locks up the Batcave for 15 years.

Enter Terry McGinnis, the troubled son of Warren McGinnis, an employee at Wayne-Powers Industries, a company jointly owned by Bruce Wayne and former business rival Derek Powers. But when Terry's father is mysteriously killed, Terry uncovers Powers' dirty deeds, involving biological weapons and black market deals. Approaching the reclusive, bitter Bruce Wayne to intervene, Terry stumbles upon Bruce's secret history as Gotham's greatest hero, Batman. ""Borrowing"" Bruce's state-of-the-art, high-tech Batsuit, he forges an uneasy alliance with the crotchety Wayne and becomes Gotham City's newest protector.

This series shouldn't be as good as it is. The series takes the Batman mythology into a techno nightmare future, maintaining much of the dark edge of Batman: The Animated Series. Though a series like this runs the risk of relying too much on the history of Batman: TAS, it does a wonderful job of introducing new villains and threats while staying reverent to its predecessor. Even diehard Batman fans were won over, despite the new Batman not being Bruce Wayne's progeny, something that, at first, might seem like heresy to fans.

What makes this series most enjoyable is the relationship between the green, inexperienced Terry and the grizzled crimefighting veteran Bruce. They have an antagonistic, smart-aleck kind of rapport with each other, which is a source of much of the show's emotional conflict as well as its humor. Bruce struggles with his personal experience with previous sidekicks and partners, and Terry struggles with living up to the Batman legend and wondering if the man makes the Batsuit or if the Batsuit makes the man.

Sadly, this series was never renewed after the third season, and WB eventually got its wish for more ""kid-friendly"" Batman shows like The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. But the characters and story of Batman Beyond has made appearances in other Dini/Timm creations like Justice League Unlimited, as well as in a handful of Batman comics. No matter if you're a modest or even a casual Batman fan, I highly recommend all three seasons of Batman Beyond.",1260144000,,3031,5.052
2474377,4,B000CSTK42,"Where do you go after completing an award winning interpretation of history's most beloved comic book hero? Take him into the future of course. And that's exactly what the Batman Animated Series team did after they finished their last regular season of that series. Season One of Batman Beyond delivered many answers to questions Batman fans had alwasy asked themselves: namely, what would Bruce Wayne be doing at age 60, 70, or 80? Obviously he couldn't be Batman forever and the show opens on that very decision Bruce makes to quit donning the cowl. It fast forwards over a decade where the efforts of Batman seem like a thing of the past. Enter Terry Mcguiness: Gotham city high schooler and all around punk. One would never think that someone like this would continue the mantle of the Batman but that is just what he does.
  The show wisely seperates itself from all the preconceived notions of the past and establishes its own identity right away. What I always felt was great about this show was that it was able to infuse two great characters in one show: the first being Batman and the second SPIDER-MAN!! That's right, Spider-man. If you're familiar with Spider-man you'll know that that character is all about the teen angst, and that is exactly what this show had over its predecessor. When watching the show it's almost like watching a really good Spider-man adventure. Terry thinks he's such a badass, he messes up, deals with some high school drama, girl problems, school work, learns a lesson, and gets ready for the next fight. Comic book fans love this formula. That is why Spider-man has resonated for so many decades and that is why this show resonated with so many fans.
  This season really set the tone for the rest of the show. It is light on episodes but each packs a wallop. As the series creators will note, they wisely decided to give Terry new villians rather than retread old ground with interpretations of Bruce's old rogue's gallery. It certainly works because we end up with memorable villians like Blight, Inque, the Royal Flush Gang, Spellbinder, and Shriek. This season proved that the formula could work and really set the stage for what would ultimately lead to the creative team taking on the Justice League a few years later.

We meet a lot of new bad guys, great new story lines and see new technology that will make Batman fans of all ages happy. I would highly recommend this for children over 7-8 and adults under the age of 121 :) Have fun.",1256947200,,553,3.990990990990991
2474379,4,B000CSTK42,"It's funny how times changes things. Some people freaked out when the new Battlestar Galactica had a female Starbuck. Countless groaned at the actors who played the future Vader in the Star Wars prequels. Right now I can't stand the new Star Trek movie. And way back in the day when this show was new, I didn't like it at all.

If you are/were an ultra-fan of Batman the Animated Series like I was, your first reaction to this show might have been what mine was...I thought it was terrible. The blaring techno-rock music, the new infusion of attitude and cyber-punk influences, the fictionalized gimmick word ""Shway!"" Where's the Batman you know and love? Just give it time.

A few years after I saw the pilot episode, I started to watch the full series on Cartoon Network, and it slowly...slowly....grew on me. After a while I got used to the music, the snappy Warner Bros. animation in all it's high quality kept my eyeballs glued to the screen, and despite some pretty major flaws, there is definitely enough substance and style here to make this show a classic, rather than just another attempt to cash-in on the biggest comic-book franchise ever (as far as I know).

Terry McGuiness is not a good kid. He's a punk with a bad attitude and a big mouth. But he's also an underdog. Bruce Wayne is one mean old man, but he's also one crazy-cool, very-scary former superhero. And between the two of them, they make a great team. It's kind of weird at first, but the aged Wayne as a side-kick/mentor gives the show a lot more gravity than it would have otherwise. Because the old guy knows every trick in the book and every bad-guy in the roster, and his experience with every problem imaginable from fighting bad guys to dealing with girls makes for some of the greatest and funniest dialog in any cartoon show.

The new villains are quite a mixed bag. On the one hand there are new ones like Spell-binder and Shriek who are arch-nemesis worthy (man I get chills when I hear spell-binders name), but unfortunately there are also some terribly weird monster-of-the-day battles that range from animal chimeras to people made of dirt. I call this the Big O/Batman Beyond monster problem because both shows have a great story, but sometimes the sheer weirdness and over-the-top ridiculousness of the monsters detract from it.

The best episodes aren't the monster-fests, but rather the story-driven ones that deal with overcoming personal issues (the episode which introduces 10 is one of, if not my favorite episode), and the dedication, sacrifice, and adaptability needed to be a hero even when the suit lets you down gives the show its gravity.

Of course if you're one of those people who watched Spiderman Unlimited and loved the high-tech suit you'll love this new Batsuit which has flight, invisibility, heat, cold, and radiation blocking, batarang guns, sound amplification, strength amplification, ect, ect. The high-tech adds some fun and keeps you guessing as to exactly how Terry is going to deal with a situation, while also letting Wayne monitor the situation and chime in with his advice.

Fans of the Batman comics and TV shows could probably argue what the true ending to Batman's life is till the end of time. But if you've watched Justice League and Justice League Unlimited in their entirety, you know that Batman Beyond incorporates smoothly into that whole universe, and provides a very satisfying end to the Batman Legacy (there are several episodes where the Justice League travels into the future, and a complete Batman Beyond episode that shows an adult Terry still fighting as Batman).

At any rate, this first season is an excellent start to a great series, so long as a couple of gruesome strange monsters and generally weird episodes don't turn you off. Several villains and story arcs are introduced in this season, but just remember the series is just beginning and the best is yet to come.",1251676800,,3917,4.801186943620178

I love the answer this series presents. A younger Batman emerges to fill the shoes and with Bruce Waynes guidance......A 17 YEAR OLD BATMAN is learning on the fly ......and it makes for a great series. Theres quite abit of action and fighting in this series . Maybe a bit much for small kids but no more than any Teen rated video game. Its really interesting series as i got all 3 seasons . Batman is such a traditional character but it was great to see what happens with bruce wayne and his young apprentice. Its a very good series and doesnt damage the batman storyline as it really enhaces the story. The animation is really good . DVD features interesting EXTRAs as well. EXCELLENT series for id say for 10 and above .",1243036800,,863,4.333333333333333

Then I remembered this series from a few years back. I found this on VHS at a used book store a few years ago. He watched them and just went nuts. I mean, he was riveted from beginning to end. It is rather dark with some upsetting scenes. So don't assume it's a kids program. I'd recommend for 10 years and up. Maybe a bit younger if they are not too sensitive. I'm not really into superheroes, but this is something I can actually sit down and watch with him and not get bored to tears.

If your a fan of Batman, you should enjoy this. That is unless you hate change and expect Batman to always be the same. You can buy all three seasons for 13 a piece and thats a heck of a deal.

I happened to stumble onto this show about 30 seconds in with no idea what I was watching. It became apparent very quickly that I was watching Batman (and I assumed the Animated Series). As the story continued I became to realize what I was watching: The most original, unexpected cartoon of the last 20 years.

I say that because with Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, etc. (all of whom I love) you know what you are getting are there is little new territory to be explored. However, with Batman Beyond, Paul Dini and Company created something where each week I became genuinely curious as to what was going to happen next.

I hope all of these millions of Americans that are pouring out to see The Dark Knight (an excellent film) give Batman Beyond a chance. I think it is a cartoon that can be enjoyed just as much (if not more) by adults, than children!",1216598400,,944,4.514619883040936
2474388,5,B000CSTK42,"As a hardcore Batman fanboy since the 80's I was skeptical of how the producers would portray a futuristic Batman. I'm a Frank Miller's Batman kind of guy so I worried it wouldn't be as dark as the comics. I was wrong. Though the technology has improved human nature is still a mixed bag and Gotham is still filled with murderers, theives and psycopaths.

Pros - The 2 part episode Rebirth gives a good reason why Bruce Wayne retires and introduces our new hero Terry McGinnis. Old villians such as Bane and Mr. Freeze appearances. New villians such as Inque, Golem, Shriek, Spellbinder and Currare are introduced. Includes an interesting twist on villians like a new batch of the Royal Flush Gang and the Jokerz a street gang that idolizes the Joker. In the episode Heroes the Terrific Trio, a parody of the Fantastic Four, appear as 2D Man (Mr. Fantastic), Freon (Invisible Girl), and Magma (Combination Thing and Human Torch).

Cons - Batman's new arch-nemesis is Blight a great character with a great story line. The tension builds but the final battle is anti-climactic. You don't know if Blight is killed or gets away. He never reappears in the rest of the series and the question is never really resolved. A dissapointing season finale.",1216339200,,1243,4.776744186046511
2474389,5,B000CSTK42,"Batman Beyond was created by The WB Television Network to continue the Batman Legacy. With a total of 52 episodes during its' run on TV and a direct-to-video film, it was put on hiatus for the new Justice League animated show to debut but has never been picked back up by WB. I, personally, had to warm up to the series a little before getting this collection. It features the first 13 episodes out of the 52 and has the futuristic Batman going up against some of the original Batman's foes as well as new ones of his own. Will Friedle, Kevin Conroy, Stockard Channing, and George Takei all provide vocal talent for the show and do an outstanding job. After getting this collection, I plan on getting the remaining seasons. It's a real good show and is a must-have for all Batman fans...although I know some of you will probably pass.

This how actually got me interested enough to go back and watch Batman: TAS as well as the later Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.

The dark, gritty aspects of Gotham taken out of the gothic into the future cyber-punk dystopia worked wonderfully.  The animation and inter-character relationships were well done.

Too bad WB didn't understand what dynamite they had.  I'd LOVE to see a live-action/CGI version of this concept.  And yes, Kevin Conroy could play the elder Bruce Wayne quite well.",1203033600,,681,4.921052631578948

KidsWB really should've just handed this one over to Cartoon Network and allowed them to use this on their network. I believe they might have made BB a great longer lasting series than just 3 seasons.
The First Collection (Season) was great. They introduced the main storyline which is not like anything I thought would happen. The voices are great, the artwork is stunning, and Ace really does have the best animation out of any of the BB characters (Check the Special features and see the Behind Batman Beyond featurette).
The series moves really smooth, but does not have anything to do with the previous episodes. Would've made a great storyline to have it that way.
Other than that, great series, and I love watching this and remembering the days Saturday Morning cartoons were actually great for the action-oriented person. And I'm not talking the BS series, Teen Titans, THAT IS NOT ACTION!",1183680000,,1013,4.7942857142857145

2474399,5,B000CSTK42,"A total fan of anything that comes from Bruce Timm and company, Batman Beyond is the series that fills in the gap between the Batman/ Superman Animated Series and the later Justice League works.  While some argue that nothing compares to the original Batman the Animated Series in terms of writing, textures, themes, and overall quality; Batman Beyond probably comes about as close as it gets.

Not only to we get an interesting interpretation of the future, we get the continuity of Kevin Conroy again playing the role of (the now 50 year older) Bruce Wayne.  We also get the dynamic of Bruce's legend incarnated into a new, younger form.  With that comes the balancing act of a typical high school student dealing with all of the difficulties associated with being a teen with the additional stresses of being a masked hero by night.

All of this and the quality packaging of the Warner Brothers boxed set which means extras to enjoy and an affordable price.  Very strongly recommended.",1179273600,3,988,4.816568047337278

2474401,5,B000CSTK42,"I admit I was one of the skeptics when I watched Batman Beyond's first episode. After the end of the first episode it became one of my all-time favorite shows. I wound up taping almost every episode of the first season. I've had the DVD box set over a year now and it's one of the most watched videos in my collection.

The first season sets up the series. Taking place 40 years after JLU's ""Destroyer"" (if you're into Timmverse continuity) Bruce Wayne is still in the role of Batman protecting Gotham City wearing a sleek black battlesuit that enhances his declining abilities. However while foiling a kidnapping he's forced to make a terrible compromise that forces him to never again take up the role of Batman.

Fast-forward twenty years. Without Batman, Bruce seems to have given up on life. Derek Powers has taken over his company and life has gone on. Enter Terry McGuiness: A high school kid with a troubled past. He's living with his dad and getting into fights. One day his dad (A Wayne Powers employee that looks eerily like Thomas Wayne) is given a disc containing some incriminating information. Powers is eager to get the disc back. So eager that he sends his assistant Mr. Fixx to kill Terry's dad and frame it on the Jokerz. Out at a club, Terry runs afoul of the Jokerz and meets up with Bruce Wayne. Together they fight off the gang and Terry learns the identity of Batman.

Going through his father's personal effects, Terry finds a disc. He goes to Bruce for help but gets none. Driven to get justice, Terry dons the Batsuit and goes to avenge his father's death. I've given away most of ""Rebirth""; I won't give away anymore. This series is TOO GOOD TO SPOIL.

The first season does a solid job establishing the relationship between Terry and Bruce, and establishing the role of Gotham's new Batman in the futuristic Gotham city. Most of this season is set up and builds up the momentum for the solid second season.

I love this show, Paul Dini and Bruce Timm pull out all the stops here making a series that surpasses their work on the previous Batman series. Inspired design, solid storytelling create a futuristic world that's fascinating and fun to explore. Episodes that stand out in the first season include ""Meltdown"" (Return of Mr. Freeze! And THE Best episode of the first season) ""Black Out"", ""Shriek"" ""Dead Man's Hand"", ""Disappearing Inque"" and ""A touch of Curare.""

Batman Beyond's first season is a Shawn James five star Essential Box set. If you love the Timmverse You have to get it. You just have to get it!",1171238400,4,2543,4.62749445676275
2474402,5,B000CSTK42,"Batman Beyond, and especially the first season episodes, are extremely well-done from the standpoint of voice acting, scripts, lots of action, beautiful visuals. I can attest that these shows have great replay potential. Fans can watch them again and again. I've probably seen the pilot episode six or eight times now. As such buying the DVD season set is a great value.

All the more reason to rail against the dunderheads at Warner Brothers for putting this in cheap cardboard that makes it hard to separate the inner folder from the outer slipcover. Shame, shame, shame on those responsible. Hello? They have these plastic things called keepcases now. They will even  hold two discs in one case. Why not use them?

Again, great content. Disgustingly cheap packaging. It's a joy and a disappointment at the same time. I suggest putting the discs in CD jewelcases for easy access, so you won't have to fight with the *&!$# box every time you want to play the series again.",1166486400,2,973,4.81437125748503

My son freaked out watching it and I can honestly say that he enjoys it more than any of our animated dvds and we have most everything from the comic genre.  I love the storylines, really like the fact that they used Kevin Conroy as the voice of Bruce Wayne, and am pleased with casting over all.

I would have thought if they released the double features with those episodes on them they would have included them as the first season it says the second season will be out soon i hope its not as expensive as its says the second will be 40 bucks is a bit high for the 4 disc set of tv.cartoons.,1154044800,3,698,4.2164179104477615
2474405,4,B000CSTK42,"I won't waste your time recounting the episodes. Instead, let's look at the execution:

Impressive visualization. Thin, precise lines, balancing straight (futuristic) against curved (human); nothing muddy. Carefully chosen colors, nothing garish, but nothing mundane. Lots of flat, one-color surfaces: no attempt to be realistic (face it: reality is dusty, dirty, messy). Style convincingly Americanizes anime.

Setting has some overtones of Akira or William Gibson's cyberpunk Tokyo, but hardly a slavish imitation, and no worship of futurific technology.

Stories are imaginative, well written, with a generous share of telling one-liners. Example: in ""Dead Man's Hand,"" a society blonde protests being robbed of her jewels, and Jack, one of the robbers, comments, ""She probably got them the old-fashioned way."" That cruelty is acted out later when King, top dog of the outfit, slaps 10 across the face, drawing blood: this criminal family is bound together, finally, by greed and violence. The plot makes much of parallel relationships: 10's need for personal freedom brings her into conflict with her father, as does Terry's with Bruce.

Imaginative stories make for imaginative animation. To my mind, the best are the two Inque stories. The protean Inque lets the animators run wild, so to speak (rather like Jack Cole with Plasticman).

Voices (Will Friedle, Kevin Conroy, Stockard Channing) are superb, ditto the music. One of the DVD ""Additional Features"" is ""Music of the Knight"": five segments from four episodes, shown with music alone, no dialogue. A great idea--except that the music selections aren't mine. It would have been nice to have the option to turn off dialogue for the whole of each episode. Oh, well . . .

So what's the problem? The packaging sucks. It's thin cardboard with a single plastic mount inside. The cardboard slipcover is so tight that I have to open one end and push the contents out the other. (Cardboard doesn't suffer abuse nicely.) My plastic mounting piece was damaged some time before it got to me. Now one of the two discs is always sliding around inside the package or falling on the floor. I think I'll buy a used Brittany Spears double-decker, ditch the contents, and use the case as a replacement.",1149033600,11,2246,5.156593406593407
2474406,5,B000CSTK42,"Here's another series I didn't get to see very much back in the day.  But its a great one.  This first season is only 13 episodes, but its worth picking up!  You'll get to see the origin story of the new Batman and why Bruce Wane put aside the mantle of the bat.  In this season, Mr. Freeze is also revisited in one of my favorite episodes, Meltdown.  We're also introduced to some new and interesting villains in this Gothum of the future such as Derrick Powers aka Blight.  I don't want to give too much away, but this is a must have for any avid Batman fan.  Kevin Conroy reprises his role as Bruce Wane from the Batman animated series for one thing.  The voice talent in this series is just as fantastic as the previous one.  So buy it!",1145145600,3,740,4.191489361702128
2474407,5,B000CSTK42,"As a fan of the Batman Beyond series, I was extremely pleased with the product when I bought it. First thing I did was plop it in my DVD player and watch the series straight through with no interruptions, and it just made me crave for season two already.

The episodes are in wonderful quality and the bonus features/special features are great especially hearing Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett etc that worked on the series, but for a Batman Beyond fan, there wasn't enough! The music bonus feature is great and after exploring every possibly inch of the two discs, I was seriously craving for more Batman Beyond.

Overall, the condidtion of the series is excellent, if not better than when it first aired. The DVD casing is unusual though. The packaging consists of a cover slip that you see on Amazon's page for the product and inside the cover slip, the two disc carrying case. Basically, the packaging is very similar to the first two Harry Potter movie DVD packaging. Inside, the carrying case that holds the two discs is designed so that the discs will be slightly overlapped, which might be a little annoying for some, but it's not that big of a mishap. Also, instead of having the binding of the two-disc carrying case face the outside of the cover slip like the first two Harry Potter movie DVD cases, the binding is facing inside, which might prove to be a little difficult to take out, a minor flaw in the design of the packaging. But otherwise, Batman Beyond the First Season is excellent, I really am looking forward to season two, which hopefully, the WB will include more bonus features.",1144713600,6,1596,4.636042402826855
2474408,5,B000CSTK42,"This show just works. Solid character development and interaction, catchy tunes (the opener is fantastic), a new dark tech world of Gotham and it stays true to the history established in Batman: TAS.  But what really works is how different it is from Batman in comics, movies, and the cartoons that began before it. Terry (the new Batman) who is still in high school becomes Batman though to Bruce he is still somewhat a sidekick like Robin or Batgirl. Really that comment doesn't describe the role Terry plays. I can best describe him as a cross between Batman, Robin, and Spider-Man (young high school version) he's dark and seeks revenge like Batman, young, adventurous and very intuitive like Robin and helpful, responsible but also often taking on too much as Spider-Man would. There is also the dynamic of family, nonexistent in previous Batman animated adventures, he has to hide what he is really doing as Batman from his friends, family and girlfriend, reminding me of Peter Parker's relationship with Mary and Aunt May.

Villains are different too, I'm glad the creators didn't just rehash enemies from the other series, though a few carry over, we don't deal with a ""Mad Hatter Beyond"" or ""Penguin Beyond"", not that either are bad characters.

Again this series works, I have been waiting for years for this show to appear on DVD. Nothing and No one can replace Batman, but Terry and this show provides a new hero that takes the name and theme of Batman with a different approach.",1144022400,3,1491,4.81640625

2474410,4,B000CSTK42,"In the past, Batman Beyond has been limited to single disc releases. Finally, WB gets a clue and decides to release Season One of this risky but popular series. While the original intent was to attract younger fans, older fans like the show as well as it stays true to the storyline from the original Batman: The Animated Series.

Disc One

Rebirth, Pts. 1 & 2 - Too old to battle injustice, Bruce Wayne is forced to hang up his cowl as Batman. Twenty years later, a young man named Terry McGinnus steals Bruce's costume to avenge the death of his father ordered by power broker Derek Powers (who also is the boss of Bruce's old company). We not only see the birth of a new Batman but the birth of a future enemy called Blight.

SPECIAL NOTE: Rebirth, Pt. 1 only has commentary by Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, Glen Murakami & Curt Geda.

Black Out - Inque, a corporate sabatoguer, is hired by Derek Powers to take out FOXTECHA. With her unique ability to blend in shadows and assume nearly any shape, Inque doesn't need weapons because her body is a weapon! I should note this eppy takes a somewhat personal tone since FOXTECHA is owned by the same family that worked for Bruce Wayne for years in the original Batman series before Powers took over. It is hinted as such at the beginning of this episode. This eppy also sees the first appearance of an older Barbara Gordon, who has now succeeded her late father James Gordon as police commissioner.

Golem - A kid, tired of being bullied and getting no support from his roughneck father, is merged with a contruction machine called a Golem. He seeks to extract a terrible revenge!

Meltdown - One of Terry's first encounters with one of Bruce's ""Rogue's Gallery"" as Mr. Freeze returns to get revenge on Derek Powers and Dr. Stephanie Lake for betraying him during an experiment to cure his condition! We also get to see Blight in action for the first time!

Heroes - A group of people take part in a dangerous experiment to create a team of crimefighters. But for Batman, things aren't what they seem.

Shriek - A engineer is hired by Derek Powers to kill Bruce Wayne but has to take out Batman as well. This eppy has a unique sequence near the end where very little sound is used to display the power of Shriek.

SPECIAL NOTE: This episode has alternate commentary by Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, Glen Murakami, Curt Geda & Stan Berkowitz.

Dead Man's Hand - The Royal Flush Gang returns to Gotham to seek revenge on Batman though this isn't the same one that put them away (that was Bruce Wayne). We also see the first serious conflict between Bruce and Terry over the Gang which is complicated even further by Terry's romance with Melanie, who turns out to be one of the gang members!

Disc Two

The Winning Edge - Teens at Terry's high school are using drugs similiar to steroids to enhance their physical abilities. Bruce suspects one of his old enemies, Bane, may be behind what's happening since the compound is....VENOM!

Spellbound - A new villian, The Spellbinder, is using hypnosis to get kids to commit crimes. Its up to Batman to break the spell!

Disappearing Inque - Desperate for the compound which originally created her, Inque manipulates a lowly factory worker (who is obsessed with her) into helping her get revenge on Batman and Bruce Wayne. This also features one of the few times that Bruce himself gets in on the action during this series!

A Touch Of Curare - In only her second appearance in the series, Police Commissioner Barbara Gordon is trying to protect her husband, Sam, from assassination by a Curare before a big deposition that could put a big crime boss behind bars for good. She also has to face down her past as she doesn't want help from either the new Batman or Bruce Wayne. We also get new revelations into the past relationship between Bruce and the former Batgirl!

Ascension - Paxton Powers, the son of Derek Powers, is called in to temporarily take over his father's company as his ""Blight"" powers rage out of control! The younger Powers, however, has other ideas!

Features:

*Inside Batman Beyond: Meet Series Creators - A round table discussion about the series with Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and Alan Burnett

*Music Of The Knight: Enjoy Score-Only Versions Of Key Scenes

The lack of extras is the only reason this set gets a 4 from me instead of a 5. Many of these episodes I had at one point or another BUT it was still worth it to get this. Can't wait for Season Two!",1143331200,8,4471,4.558052434456929
2474411,5,B000CSTK42,"After waiting years for a season set we finally are here. For those of you who don't know the story let me give you the short version: Years in the future Bruce Wayne aka Batman is retired. After some tragical events Terry McGinnis becomes the new Batman. But theres more here than what our eyes sees and once you are done with this series you better look for Justice League Unlimited Season 2 finale episode ""Epilogue"" in order to discover who Terry really is!!!Awesome release. Kudos to WHV for giving us such a superior set.

The pros:

-New box design. Saves lot of space, excellent colors, art and very practical.

-13 episodes compressed in 2 disks is a nice touch and good deal.

-Not too expensive, not too cheap for what we get

-Transfers are awesome

-Commentaries are kind of limited but very good

-The episodes themselves are the best here.

The cons:

-No chapter stops

Heres hoping we get season 2 vol. 1 or the complete season 2 sometime soon. Please add chapter stops WHV! You may consider getting BATMAN BEYOND: RETURN OF THE JOKER UNCUT VERSION once you are done with this series as well (What it before Justice League Unlimited episode Epilogue!!)",1143072000,3,1225,4.672897196261682
2474412,5,B000CSTK42,"I never really gave this show the credit it deserved with its initial run. Seemed the like The WB would play one new episode and then wait another 3 months to air a new one. Thank goodness, someone finally came to there senses and started releasing full-season sets. I gleefully watched every episode last nigth and the show holds up remarkabley well. Excellent new villians like Shreik, Inque and Spellbinder! Great update on the Bat mythos and top-notch animation. What I like best is that through all these changes, Dini/Timm never lost sight of the real catch...the story! So unfortunate that we are stuck with that ""The Batman"" tripe on the air now, but luckily we have more sets of Batman Beyond to enjoy!",1142985600,4,711,4.741935483870968
2474413,5,B000CSTK42,I have watched this series over and over.  Great entertainment with a pretty good story line.  Consistant with character development throughout the Batman series.  Very cool villians with interesting powers.  Wish the series would have continued on TV.,1142467200,2,252,5.552631578947368
2474414,5,B000CSTK42,"Gotham, the future. Dark Knight Terry McGinnis and his mentor Bruce Wayne fight to rid the city of the criminal element which infests it. Armed with a high-tech Batsuit, a hover-converted Batmobile and the vast training and guidance of the original Batman, McGinnis transcends the Batman legacy as a new hero for a new era.

It may have been created [by the producers of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" at the request of Warner Bros.] to attract a new generation of viewers by injecting the dark detective with new younger blood, but the futuristic ""Batman Beyond"" (like Batman: TAS) was a show for Batfans of all ages. Ironically, much of Batman Beyond's charm can be attributed to the generation gap between Terry and Bruce as displayed in ""Dead Man's Hand"" where they clash over their pursuit of the Royal Flush Gang. One of whom (Melanie/Ten) Terry has romantic feelings for and later reluctantly places into police custody. ""This sort of thing ever happen to you?"", Terry asks. Bruce warmly smiles with ""Let me tell you about a woman named Selina Kyle"". Great stuff. Batman Beyond was a cool series that featured the phenomenal voice talents of Will Friedle (Boy Meets World), Kevin Conroy (Batman: TAS), Lauren Tom (Superman: TAS), Teri Garr (Mr. Mom), and Sherman Howard (Superboy); first-rate scripts; frenetic action; and one of TV's coolest opening main titles. Not to mention sensational main title and score music by Kristopher Carter.

2474415,4,B000CSTK42,"This was a great idea, I don't understand why more fans of Batman The Animated Series didn't like it.  I like the futuristic touches, even though the characters are still not too far-removed from the present.  The music, the action, and just plain ENERGY of the show are all top-notch.

Warner Bros. has done another great job of providing animation fans with an affordable way to collect our favorite shows.  Can't wait for more!",1139616000,6,430,4.77027027027027
2474416,3,B000CSTK42,"ok  when i first  saw this show i was very skeptical..i come from the  batman the animated series old school...after watching the return of the joker film ..i was impressed .  the show fast forwards 20 yrs later after bruce wayne retires from being the batman(still voiced to perfection by kevin conroy)..and we find that wayne has a new protege..and new high tech weapons .  this is a worty follow up  to BTAS and is worth a look...although the storylines could have been better though

  ps  its cool to see wayne's dog  ace from the early 90s books in the show as well.",1138752000,11,572,4.456310679611651
2474417,5,B000CSTK42,THIS IS A GREAT SHOW AND GREAT FOR THE BATMAN LEGACY. I'VE SEEN EVERY EPISODE AND I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE LAST COUPLE JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED SHOW HOW THEY TIED IN BATMAN BEYOND INTO THE DC UNIVERSE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS COOL AS HECK MAN. THIS IS INDEED A CLASSIC SHOW.,1137801600,5,266,4.34
2474418,5,B000CSTK42,"The concept of a Batman for the next generation has been addressed in the comics with mixed results.  Batman Jr., Batman II, Robin assuming Batman's identity, etc.  Finally, the people who resurrected the animated Batman and Superman series comes Batman Beyond, an imaginative, realistic (in comic terms) passing of the mantle.  Bruce Wayne has conquered many a foe, but Father Time has relegated the ailing Wayne into retirement.  His final years as the caped crusader were spent fighting in a high-tech strength enhanced batsuit which was a radical departure from the original.  When the suit is stolen by young Terry McGinness trying to avenge his own father's death, an uneasy apprenticeship begins.  It is a dynamic that is entertaining and full of possibilities.  Adding to the intrigue, McGinness is a high school student living at home with his mother and nosy brother, Wayne Enterprises is now run by a corrupt executive who moonlights as a supervillain, and Batgirl is still around, albeit in civilian mode as the new Commissioner Barbara Gordon.

Get this DVD and hang on for the ride of your life!!!",1137628800,6,1111,5.032786885245901
2474419,5,B000CSTK42,When I first saw this series I was very sceptical.  I am so glad I watched it as it is a great take on Batman.  I am so excited that WB finally stopped their awful policy of releasing items piecemeal onto to crappy and expensive dvd's.  I sincerely hope that they take a hint from FOX and put the Justice League episode that finished BB so we can have the series completed and nicely finished.,1137456000,2,393,4.213333333333333
2474420,5,B000CSTK42,"Dark, robust, cutting edge, cool, and classic are only a few words that can describe this ""have-to-see"" version of a future batman.  If your a fan or just looking for something new, the batman beyond series is right for you.",1137283200,,224,4.6
2474421,5,B000CSTK42,The batman beyond series is a fantastic series I know because I have seen every episode of the 3 seasons and all 52 episodes. I have a huge batman collection and can't wait to add this one to it. The show is great but I don't think it is as great as the other original batman 90's cartoons but that is my opionion. Buy this if you are a batman fan you will love it.,1136764800,,365,3.88
2474422,5,B000CSTK42,"Despite what others may say about this show, make no mistake that Batman Beyond is pure animated bliss for comic fans.  When an aging Bruce Wayne (once again voiced by Kevin Conroy, now sounding aged and sardonic) hangs up the cape and cowl, he becomes the reluctant mentor to young Terry McGiness (voiced by Will Friedle); a resourceful and revenge driven teen whose father has been murdered.  With a new, high tech Bat-suit and fancy, futuristic gadgets, Batman Beyond was a smashing new foray into the Batman mythos brought to us by Batman: The Animated Series vets Paul Dini and Bruce Timm.  This new Batman also finds a strong rogue gallery in the tradition of the classic Batman, including the shape shifting Inque, Shriek, Spellbinder, the Royal Flush Gang, and a returning Mr. Freeze as well.  Sadly, Batman Beyond didn't go down very well with a majority of Bat-fans, but the show really was something special, and it's lightyears beyond the current Batman animated incarnation, The Batman.",1136678400,24,999,4.9640718562874255
2474423,5,B000CSTK42,"At last Batman Beyond - the first season ...

As context - before catching an episode of BB late one night on the cartoon network, I never ever ever watched animated super-hero shows.  BB changed all that.  Very cool, very hip ... totally engaging.  Still don't understand why the WB canned it.  Now all we need is a BB revival - or movie even?",1136505600,4,344,4.3125
2474424,5,B000CSTK42,"It's a pity that WB cancelled the show after only three seasons.

Batman Beyond is an extension of Batman. It takes place 20 or so years after Bruce Wayne, the original Batman, retires. Terry McGinnis is a teenager in high school who accidentally stumbles upon the Batcave while helping Mr. Wayne. Fast forward and obviously Terry manages to become Batman with Bruce Wayne as his mentor and ally...like another Alfred only not as nice. BB is about Terry managing his social life and his Batman life and the tribulations that come with being a superhero.

At first, I doubted if BB would ever be able to top the old Batman cartoons; especially with a teenager as the Bat. Worked out just fine though. Batman Beyond is impressive. It stayed true to the old Batman but was still able to stay original and fresh. BB is definitely not the old Batman but it is just as entertaining.

With the introduction of many new villains (Inque, Shriek, Kobra, etc.) and the return of some old (Mr. Freeze, the Joker...kind of), the aging of a cranky but still sharp Bruce Wayne, and a well-drawn teenager out to save the world BB has the perfect blend of action, witty humor, and suspenseful story lines.

BB helps with the nostalgia of the original Batman cartoons. But after watching them, can't help feel a little nostalgia for those good ol' Batman Beyond days ;D.

If you're a fan of the original Batman cartoons, I suggest you check out Batman Beyond.",1136073600,15,1441,4.65748031496063
