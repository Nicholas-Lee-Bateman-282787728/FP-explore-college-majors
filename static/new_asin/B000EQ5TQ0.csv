8113048,5,B000EQ5TQ0,"Five star movie on DVD with English subtitles, but director has not yet chosen to accept profit $$$ of releasing with English subtitles on blu ray.  Must not want the cash or credit for this truly fantastic movie, available in 2 different blu ray forms, neither of which with English subtitles.  Would pay $40 for blu ray of this fantastic movie of good vs. evil and courage if blu ray had English.  Please!",1487462400,,407,4.5479452054794525

8113052,5,B000EQ5TQ0,"This film illustrates, through the microcosm of an elite school for future supermen, in which we see two cadets forge an unlikely bond of friendship, the brutalizing effect of Nazi ideology on a whole generation.  The main focus is on Friedrich Weimer (Max Reimelt) the very epitome of Aryan perfection, whose boxing skills are noticed by an instructor at the school and which gain him entry into its hallowed ranks.  To these is added Albrecht, son of the local gauleiter (paramilitary governor) whose father epitomizes, in his own way, the twisted logic of Nazi philosophy, which is totally at odds with his more sensitive sons own world view.

Gradually, Albrechts influence on Friedrich causes the latter to question his continued willing participation in and acceptance of the very philosophy he literally embodies. The film makes for very uncomfortable viewing but succeeds, eminently, in depicting the desensitizing effects of Nazi brainwashing in which kindness, tolerance and sensitivity represent weaknesses to be eradicated at all costs; bringing, vividly to mind, OBriens statement to Winston at the end of 1984, if you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face  forever.

As you will read in other reviews there is some controversy over this particular DVD version concerning aspect ratios and the fact that the packaging doesnt reflect its content!  But, not being aware of any of this prior to viewing it had no effect on me whatsoever.  Therefore, if you want a very well-made, acted to perfection, glimpse of the true evil of the Nazi state, don't let any of that put you off.",1403308800,,1620,5.022388059701493
8113053,5,B000EQ5TQ0,"The most powerful  (and also heartbreaking) movie I've every seen about WWII.  More than that, it details the tragedy of any society that tells their male children to ""be a man"".......because all males are not alike, and if our planet is going to survive, we have to culture a different male persona besides the ""tough guy"" image.",1396137600,2,330,4.771929824561403
8113054,5,B000EQ5TQ0,"I was an Officer in the U.S. Armed Forces, and a student who participated in Air Command & Staff College, and the Air War College.  My subjects of choice were the Nuremberg Code of 1947, and eugenics (massacres of people).  During pre-World War II Germany -and during WW II, I was stunned by involvements of the German Youth, in the Hitler Jugend, and special schools (Hitler Ugent).  Here is a DVD Movie, produced by Max Riemelt that I consider a Masterpiece of peudo-historical accuracy.  The DVD content really illustrates how the young were molded into a militaristic being of unquestioning obedience to the Fuhrer?!  There were those youth who failed to measure up, and were humiliated and degraded as they were ejected with permanent expulsion - some even committed suicide.  Unquestioning Obedience was in the Nazi culture civilian and military.  It has been my privilege to know good German people who decry what happened under the Third Reich; and producers like Max Riemelt, enable us to understand how that kind of indoctrination was allowed to succeed. In any nation with a government as a representative republic, a democracy is only a half-step away from a dictatorship if the tyrant and his cohorts seize power.  One of the methods involved is to conquer the youth with their ideology.  This DVD movie illustrates how that can happen.  The quality of this DVD is superb in visual and audial clarity.  I have viewed this DVD movie several times after I received it, and each time learned more about the
obvious and subdued techniques of Nazi indoctrination.  By factual analogy, this production contains multiple warnings how a similar tragedy can take place in another setting - there are some that have commenced in our era:  At the Nuremberg Trials in 1949, Col.
Ted Lawson, U.S. Army, testified at the trials and stated, "" ... Mankind still has not crossed over Jordan [the River] ..."" in the 20th Century, AND, I contend neither have we in the 21st Century.  ""Hitler Ugent"" speaks prophetically to that perspective.",1393804800,6,2034,4.926686217008798
8113055,1,B000EQ5TQ0,Having recently viewed the movie on television I immediately wished to own a copy. Sadly I failed to realise that the product advertised was a not in the original German versian but a solely dubbed Hungarian version without even English subtitles and thus of no use to me whatsoever. Any offers?,1353542400,4,295,4.803921568627451
8113056,5,B000EQ5TQ0,"Since these times of 1965 with the acclaimed film ""The Young Torless"", we had witnessed such devastating gaze around the rise of the Nazism until this film came to me, ten years ago. ""Napola"" is a bold and courageous film. It deals with the first encounter of a teenager when is recruited to be part of a Nazi elite whose main purpose is to sculpt new volunteers into the rigid scheme. To obey and become beings under the service of the maxim leader.

Friedrich is a future promise of the box who will meet Albrecht, a refined, cult and sensitive human being who simply doesn't agree with the basic principles of the Nazism. This fortuity encounter will sustain this enigmatic plot loaded of drama, and tension, when both worlds collapse.

One of the ten best films of 2006!",1266364800,,774,4.601449275362318
8113057,4,B000EQ5TQ0,"""NAPOLA"" is the abbreviation of a political Nazi school for young people in Nazi Germany, 1942. The students are selected not for a deep intellectual work, but to become the future leaders of a World ruled by the Nazis, this is,  men of action without moral scruples and giving more importance to the fight sports than learning sciences or literature.
  These boys, mostly teenagers, are submitted to a iron discipline, but still so, there are two, the first a promising boxer, and the second a more introspective one which question the purpose of that terrible school.
They get to manage rifles, hand grenades and are made to kill some unfortunate Russian boys in a forest.
Well, and I can say when I was a child in Spain, this is 50- 45 years ago, I did my bachelor in a religious catholic school very similar to NAPOLA. You only need to change the Nazis by Catholic priests, as that college was a religious one. I can say the only difference was I didn't manage a rifle nor kill anyone, but for me, these priests should have passed a trial as Nuremberg.",1264550400,2,1056,4.5473684210526315
