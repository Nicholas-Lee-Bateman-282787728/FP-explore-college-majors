7861619,4,6304100809,"I'm not sure what tape the other reviewer saw, but from his/her description it sounds very little like the Bill Burrud tape that I've seen. Released as part of a series on the Walt Disney Home Video label over 20 years ago, this is an informative if somewhat naive and a perhaps a tad outdated overview of various members of the scaly-skinned clan with whom we share this planet. It's done very much in the spirit of the Disney-produced nature films of the '50s and early '60s, like 'The Living Desert.' No, not as flashy or exciting as, say, the late, great Steve Irwin's programs, but a solid, well-photographed primer for youngsters interested in matters herpetological.",1168560000,,673,4.810344827586207
