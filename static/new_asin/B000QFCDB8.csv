2837383,3,B000QFCDB8,"I must say, I loved the journey she took us on with both her photos and video footage.  The still photos were just lovely.and the nudity didn't bother me at all.  Ridiculous to even be in the same sentence as child pornography!

 What I did find disturbing was that I felt she used her children as human props.  I don't even recall her ever using her youngest child's name.  He was always referred to as, ""the baby.""  Put ""the baby,"" here or move ""the baby,"" there.  Two scenes  in particular bothered me. The first was when she placed the child in the grass directly facing the sun and left him like that until she was satisfied that she had gotten her shot. The second was when she was reviewing photos with her mother as ""the baby"" was behind her without so much as a glance.  I'm seemed as though the only time this child was cuddled or nurtured was in the arms of his grandmother or older sister.

I would be interested to see a follow up.with her now older children.  Curious as to their own personal
 thoughts and perspectives regarding their experience.",1441065600,6,1061,4.435233160621761

2837385,5,B000QFCDB8,"Excellent and insightful documentary that provides an intimate view into the life and photography of Tierney Gearon. I found it captivating and emotionally moving to watch her interactions between her mom, her kids and herself. Some of the work of her kids being kids that caused controversy because of nudity, are another example of our societies warped perspective of nudity always being something inherently wrong to do or see, yet mass killings, violence and bloodshed being acceptable to display daily on TV, Internet and Print media. These images were simply moments of childhood; the kids uninhibited and innocent, just having fun playing on the beach. This is a documentary that demands attention, not something to just have on screen as background material.",1437523200,,766,5.286885245901639
2837386,5,B000QFCDB8,"In response to the woman who wants to jail Tierney, I just watched the documentary and found it beautiful, honest, visceral.  Many artists are provoked by the human body:  Gary Snyder, Walt Whitman, Ginsberg, Marguerite Duras, Anne Sexton...the list is endless...even artists that may not have been aware of the body's impact on their art--I'm thinking of Christina Rossetti--probably didn't feel the need for some modern transubstantiation in order to at least sense the body as sacred.  People who constantly sexualize the body (though I do not see this as a necessary bad thing either) are, it seems to me, often not able to perceive the ugliness, the beauty, the ineffable subtleties that the body has to teach us.  We only live once in the skin around us. Let it be consoled by us and not reprimanded!
Thank you Tierney for your honesty.  I didn't want you to see this woman's comment (if you ever waste the time by reading these) and think that all ""Okies"" are so insane.
My sister is schizophrenic.  I identitfied with a great deal of this work through your documentary!  I'll try to be there to fight for your freedom if the day comes when you are (like poor K) taken to jail for being human.",1204502400,6,1200,4.658767772511848
2837387,5,B000QFCDB8,"Hmm. Was the reviewer who wants to put Tierney Gearon in jail really so shocked and appalled by this film? He seems to have still had the ""nerve"" to watch the whole thing. His puritanical view is really more shocking than anything you'll see in the film. The movie is a sensitive portrayal of a photographer mining the precarious terrain of her own life and her own family--brave and unsentimental art that is captured without judgement by the unobtrusive filmmakers. A brilliant and enlightening documentary on one person's life and creative process.",1192924800,13,551,5.0
2837388,5,B000QFCDB8,"Huh?

How could this last ""reviewer"" be so linear in his or her thinking?  I thought it was a challenging, thought and emotion-provoking but beautiful film!  Families come in all shapes and sizes and have all kinds of problems and this family while appearing unique, yes, is also a family that knows an incredible amount of love and acceptance of each other.  These children are clearly raised by artists...and there is no such thing as a perfect artist (especially in a parent!) nor is there such a thing as a perfect parent, artist or not.  Her children will have good stories to share when they grow up and they will most likely be free thinkers and movers and shakers.  At the very least, I am fairly certain they will not say they weren't loved and I know they won't feel they'd been abused in any way.  I applaud Tierney's ability to show off her body (same goes with her mother) and show her children that there is nothing wrong with the naked human body.  There is nothing sexual going on but on the contrary, it is unusually wholesome -- and by ""unusually"" I simply mean by our culture's standards.  Good for you Tierney.  She shared her personal story with all its colors of beauty and love and dysfunction and she brought tears to my eyes (in the wee hours of the morning the other night when I couldn't sleep and stumbled across this film) because the ""nakedness"" of her story -- the honesty -- was very refreshing.",1188259200,16,1427,4.517509727626459
2837389,1,B000QFCDB8,"DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO SUPPORT CHILD PORN AND ENDANGERMENT. THIS WOMAN SHOULD HAVE LOST HER CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE BORN AND SHAME ON SUNDANCE FOR EVEN SHOWING SUCH A MORTIFIED MOTHER AND HER MOTHER NAKED TOGETHER. IT IS SICK, DIMENTED, TWISTED, AND PAINFUL TO THE EYE. I WANT HER OUT OF THIS COUNTRY AND ALSO SUNDANCE HAS SOME EXPLAINING TO DO. I WAS IN TEARS AND AM STILL IN SHOCK. PLEASE DO WATCH IT ON SUNDANCE IF YOU HAVE THE CHANNEL JUST SO THAT YOU WILL COME WITH ME ON MY PLEA TO PUT HER IN JAIL.

2837390,5,B000QFCDB8,"Celebrated photographer Tierney Gearon's work has been labeled manipulative, disturbing and even perverse. A former model and dancer, Gearon came to notorious fame in 2001 when photos of her own naked and masked children in the ""I Am a Camera"" show at London's Saatchi Gallery had authorities threatening child pornography charges.

Filmmakers Peter Sutherland (Pedal) and Jack Youngelson (Producer, Ghosts of Abu Ghraib) follow this exceptional artist over the course of two years as she assembles her most daring and emotionally complex body of work to date: a series on her manic-depressive schizophrenic mother, who resides in Grey Gardens squalor in the frozen suburbs of upstate New York. The mixture of art and family can almost be too close for comfort, but like much of Gearon's photographs there is a subversive beauty that emerges from the incongruity between ordinary moments and madness. Tierney Gearon: The Mother Project is a moving and intricate portrait of an artist, her inspirations and unconventional family relationships.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
* Over 20 minute of deleted scenes, including footage from The Mother Project's New York gallery opening
* Home movies, including rare Super-8 footage
* Selected Tierney Gearon photos from the Mother Project series
* Statements from Tierney Gearon and the filmmakers
* English subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired
* Trailer",1186531200,6,1392,5.410138248847926
8196011,3,B000QFCDB8,"I don't think this project is revelatory in the way that Tierney Gearon imagined. However, it is very moving in terms of what it reveals about a woman and her mother and her children. The question then becomes, is Tierney Gearon a full blown narcissist? Who upon viewing the film will be unable to truly see and hear herself, and therefore won't change the behaviors that aren't good for her kids? Or will she grapple with the parts of her mothering that replicate what was not nurturing in her own childhood, while holding on to the good stuff she got?  It's really just a version of what every mother has to face about how she raises her kids. Except, this is on film, with audio. Maybe every mother (and father) would benefit from being filmed at length. And then there are the issue of boundaries, and particularly of the children, to have sovereign right over their own bodies. By using their nudity in her work, which ultimately is what she is doing, she violates their rights and ownership, if you will, of their own bodies. Just as perhaps her boundaries were trodden upon, who knows? But you have to decide that you aren't going to let the blech of your own childhood flow downstream, that it stops with you, in every way you know how to. And when that fails, you will apologize from your heart, and do better in the future. I just don't see any of that happening here, even though I get the sense that Tierney feels she is revealing that she is a much better parent than her mother. Now the question is, will she be able and willing to grapple with what is actually revealed by ""The Mother Project""? I hope so.",1499385600,,1620,4.454545454545454

8196015,1,B000QFCDB8,"Terrible. She exploits her children and mother. I felt terrible for her son when he said he was embarrassed by the (naked) photos of him she published.  And the documentary isn't shot very well either. If you want to see the work of a true photographer whose work is in the same vein, Sally Mann's documentary ""What Remains"" is done beautifully.",1456963200,2,345,4.655737704918033

8196017,1,B000QFCDB8,"So strange, but honest, in terms of being mothered by someone with mental illness.  Tierney obviously has dealt with some difficulties related to her mother's illness and decreased ability to parent, but it seems that Tierney also struggles with some mental illness of her own?  Both mothers seem to love their children, but not in that selfless, protective, and mature way that provides children with a boost toward a happy, well-adjusted life. They love their children because the children support the mothers' own emotional/psychological needs. I do not agree with Tierney's name calling and hitting of her children when they disrupt her photo shooting by fighting with each other.  Did anyone else hear the echoes of her mother's berating accusations as Tierney hit her children and called them ""disgusting"" after a childhood spat? (Then, she neglected to give comfort to her crying son, but rather rushed to photograph his tears without so much as a caress?) This is not art, but a voyeuristic look into dysfunctional family relationships and the odd behaviors of mental illness. I have no problem with the naked human body, but the appropriateness of Tierney's naked photography of children and naked adults with children shows lack of judgment in preserving of the rights of these children. They are used as props in her pictures without regard to their feelings about participating. Tierney's work gets recognition, not because it is good art, but because it is controversial and sensational. Disrespect of children is not art.  Just because they are her children, she does not have the right to make them do whatever she directs in order to satisfy her desires for self expression.  I agree with Tierney's father.  This is damaging to the children.",1451347200,6,1757,5.104529616724738

8196019,1,B000QFCDB8,"I feel like there is nothing special about the pictures on this documentary (aside from the adult naked pics, which are sick). You could look at any family album from anyone and see better snap shots. Look on Facebook!  This woman is ""famous"" whether by accident or design by her controversial pictures. She made statements of not growing up with healthy boundaries with her mom. Does she know what that means?  Getting naked with your mother and snuggling would most definitely be considered that. Does she not realize she's passing it down by taking pics of herself naked with her kids like that?  That is not art. She makes money creating controversy. There's no real talent.

I had to stop watching when she began acting bizarre and wanted to take a pic of her baby in the sun. she seemed to just only care about getting the picture no matter how mundane, caring not how upset her mother was getting. I was screaming at the TV. She let her kids just run around wild, they might as well have been alone. When they cried, oh she was there to capture that moment!

Her controversy will cease to be shocking soon.  Wonder what she will do for a living then? Jcp might hire her to do kids portraits.",1446076800,5,1198,4.497695852534562
8196020,2,B000QFCDB8,"This shows a daughter that has a career as a photographer disrespecting her mother.  Her mother she states to everyone has a mental illness, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.  The mother may or may not be medicated. She acts like her mother's mental illness is a joke and her mother's behavior is the butt of her jokes.  She drops over to her moms house in the dead of winter and gives her little notice. The mother is upset because her home is a ""mess"" and it is.  Her home is obviously in a state of neglect probably mostly due to poor finances.  The mother seems somewhat frail and angry at her daughter for popping in and expecting her to go out in the cold in precarious positions.  The daughter is using her mother to make money on a film and thinks it is amusing. The mother does not.  It is candid and dysfunctional.  I did not want to watch the whole thing. The daughter is somewhat psychologically abusive of the mother in her disrespectful manner of taking candid photos and expecting a frail mother to go in the cold causing her emotional stress.",1445212800,3,1060,4.484375
