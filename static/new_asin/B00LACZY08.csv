6478551,5,B00LACZY08,One of the best anime's of all time. Enough said. XD,1409616000,,52,3.8181818181818183
6478552,5,B00LACZY08,"this ships in a standard DVD Package but don't be fooled it does actually have the Blu Rays

For Nis America's first dub it is surprising how well it was done.  the voice actors are very well picked and suit their parts well. what i was really not as impressed about was the art book though i have been spoiled by Lain's Limited Edition artbook and have come to really expect an actual Character design book with actually production art, what is offered her was never promised to be that grand and i knew what i was buying before so. anywho the art book is informative and tells you a little about the characters and relations and a little about their designs. the animation is superb and the story though you know how it will end after the first episode if you read it right and the third for everyone else, is the best part of the show. if you don't mind spoilers or just like shows that tell a journey and not a Story i have a feeling you may like this show.",1409270400,2,961,4.217391304347826
6478553,5,B00LACZY08,Just as described!!!,1408147200,,20,6.0
6478554,5,B00LACZY08,"Toradora Is just great all around the story is excellent, its got great, lovable characters, and it can be hilariously funny, but can, and will bring you to tears. NISamerica also did an amazing job with this English dub. This anime is all around deserving of a 10 out of 10 rating! Highly recomended!

But the problem I have is Amazon currently has it listed at nearly 160 dollars. So thats why I say buy it but not here, unless you are willing to pay over 40 dollars more than you have to. I would recomend getting it from rightstuf as they are selling it at $105.",1407110400,16,566,4.289719626168225
6478555,5,B00LACZY08,"I'll spare you the ins and outs of the show as, if you're looking at a collector's item this pricey, chances are you love the show enough to be willing to spend the extra cash!
The set contains the whole series including the OVA on 8 discs (split into both Blu Ray and DVD format) and a decent art book rich in content, all housed in a colourful chipboard art box with out two main characters and the iconic ToraDora logo running down the spine.
You can watch the entire series in Japanese with English subtitles like the previous sets that were released, with the inclusion of English audio exclusive to this release as a celebration to this series being NIS Americas first set they released. The English dub is solid/ above average which admittedly is something I wasn't expecting due to my recent streak of unsatisfactory English dubs (I'm fluent in Japanese, so I have more knowledge on how well acted shows are in both languages than your average anime fan).

In case you're from overseas like I am (England), yes, the Blu Rays DO work on PS3s, however failed to work on my standard blu ray player in the main room, so take that as you will! The DVDs are strict to Region 1 but Region-free DVD players are cheap to pick up if you really want to watch this show.
Is this set worth $150? Tough question, really, I'm not going to be one to adamantly shout at you until you buy it, but I will say that this set is your only option to get a solid and gorgeous looking set that is leaps ahead of the previous iterations of this series' USA releases.
So you decide, in my opinion, I don't regret tossing $150 at the seller, but if you have an issue with spending such money, you can easily purchase the Bilingual standard editions!",1405036800,23,1729,4.403125
6478556,5,B00LACZY08,"A bit pricey I admit, but well worth the buy. I couldn't say no to this bundle of romantic comedy.",1441152000,2,98,3.95
6478557,5,B00LACZY08,I really love this anime and I was glad I was able to order and purchase it. It will always be one of the anime I enjoy the most.,1439424000,2,129,3.4827586206896552

6478559,5,B00LACZY08,"Exactly what I wanted. I watched the item on Amazon for probably 3 or 4 months and finally there was one up for a drastically lower price than most here and I struck.
Came fast, in great condition, and plays as it should. A definite easy choice for a fan of the anime!",1430870400,3,268,4.0754716981132075
6478560,5,B00LACZY08,Love the series and this set,1424044800,,28,3.8333333333333335
6478561,5,B00LACZY08,"When Ryuji a high school student ostracized because of his intimidating eyes accidently learns his pintsized hard hitting classmate Taiga's secret crush on Kitamura his best friend he tries to make her feel better by confessing that he has a secret crush on Minori her best friend. This leads to the two of them forming a secret pact to help each other win the hearts of the ones they love, but hearts are not so easily won even with help.

While everything that comes with the premium edition is great some people may not feel the price is worth the contents.

Toradora is one of the best animes I've ever seen! The animation is gorgeous, the characters are compelling, the story is intriguing and the English dub is excellent making this series a must own for any anime fan!",1422835200,8,776,4.575539568345324

6478563,5,B00LACZY08,"the real question is "" are you ready to spend $160 on this set?"" cause I'm having a hard time deciding and I'm an collector of anime but that aside this is a great show I recommend it for anyone but I suggest waiting for a lower price in the future if that happens",1418688000,2,264,3.9074074074074074
6478564,5,B00LACZY08,"This is top 10 show easily for me. A very humurous love story, Toradora is right up there with Anohana, Bunny Drop, The Rose of Versailles, K-on, Wolf's Rain, etc as far as amazing character development. An absolutely stupendous expression of the human condition. Packaging is very cool too, what with the nicely colored box design and awesome matching hardcover book and DVD/Blu-ray case. English dub is top tier. Just make sure to keep an eye on that Palmtop Tiger if you value your sight!",1410566400,3,491,4.788235294117647
6478565,5,B00LACZY08,"Makes me happy to have it. Thank you for everything.

Excellent response with the original invoice request.

Went through mexican customs in Guadalajara just fine.",1409616000,2,163,5.48

8664808,5,B00LACZY08,"I am pretty sure anyone who is looking at this already knows This anime from friends, blogs, and reviews. I will lay the record straight, i loved this anime. I particularly loved the buddung love that develops between taiga and ryuji, and the troubles they go through to be together. I truly believe this is a go to anime for anyone who likes a romantic story that mixes both drama and comedy. The art book that came with the discs was amazing.",1485043200,,444,4.426829268292683
8664809,5,B00LACZY08,"Loved the product, in perfect condition on arrival, arrived on time. Love this anime, if you love this anime I suggest buying this IF you don't mind spending the money. I for one think it is worth every penny (Always good to treat yourself to something spendy occasionally I say haha.) and I'm sure you won't regret it either, specially if you really love romantic comedies and, if you already watched it and want it, really love this show. Worth it!",1484179200,,450,4.567901234567901
8664810,5,B00LACZY08,"At first glance, Toradora appears to be a typical romantic comedy. Boy meets girl, hijinks ensue, boy and girl recognize their feelings for one another, and they end up together in the end.

That is certainly the main premise of the show, but it goes far deeper than that. The characters learn to get in touch with their feelings and vocalize what goes on deep within their psyches. Along the way, they learn life lessons about co-operation and what constitutes genuine friendship. The comedy is usually on-point and hilarious, adding a solid amount of rewatchability to the anime. Things do get dark, despite the use of comedy. Child neglect and school fights do raise their ugly heads. To the shows credit, it deals with these issues head-on, without sugarcoating anything.

The characters are well-rounded, and aside from the one-time students that don't have much screen time, the characters were not created and plopped into the show without a second thought. There is very little window dressing here. Toradora does an exemplary job of demonstrating how complicated teenagers can be.

The Japanese voice actors are stellar as always, and I found the English dub to be quite tolerable. Nippon Ichi was very magnanimous with the extras, including the bonus features in the Japanese release and a gorgeous full-colour artbook.",1476144000,,1329,5.087155963302752
8664811,5,B00LACZY08,"I will mostly review the video quality, which should get only 4 stars but I'll put 5 stars because this is a super good show.

This show is upscaled SD, the credits text and everything are in SD resolution. However, it appears that they went back and got a native 852 x 480 source to upscale, therefore the sharpness and line quality are much better than on DVD versions. Furthermore the color resolution which is normally halved at 360 x 240 on DVD, is restored to full here. Native resolution DVD on a good player can surpass a blu-ray SD upscale, but not when the 720 x 480 DVD is also rescaled slightly from the pure source.

Unfortunately it's still not a perfect release. There is a global problem where the color is displaced to the left from where it is supposed to be by about two large pixels. It's like coloring in a drawing but missing to the left. It's not an absolute miss, it is like a smear. I have seen a similar effect when using component cables on some equipment. There is also grain and noise at a much higher level than the DVDs. These problems may or may not be related. Some screenshots of the Japanese blu-ray I found appear to have the same flaw.

The aforementioned flaws do not apply to the extras or the bonus OVA episode. They each have their own unique video quality. The extras are upscaled SD but with different upscaling algorithms. The SOS cooking extras have halo sharpening artifacts which the main feature does not, though it still looks no sharper in the end, possibly because they did not go back to get a pure source. The TV commercials look washed out with even greater haloing. The OVA episode was perhaps created in low resolution HD. The credits appear to be upscaled 720p and the drawings are at best upscaled 576p.

The first creditless OP/ED are taken from the OVA while the second creditless OP/ED are from regular episodes, distinguishable by the video quality.

None of that probably has anything to do with NIS America's encoding, which for the most part I have no issue with. Everything is encoded at 1080p/24 which is fine but perhaps incorrect for a few of the extras, as they have certain texts that animate at 60 fps and that is lost. The included DVDs are encoded at 60i but oddly the text animation is still lost. They must have become 24 fps at some intermediate point. The original NIS America DVDs of Toradora are neither the same encode nor source, and retain the 60i animation.

The source video for the DVDs in this set is not identical to the blu-ray. They don't fill the whole screen, and there is garbage at the bottom. The color shifting and noise problems are absent. There is some haloing from sharpening. The original NIS America DVD release has less haloing, no garbage at the bottom, and fills most of the screen though that varies by the episode. Screenshots of the original Japanese DVDs I found look perfect with no haloing at all.

I would recommend a diehard fan to get the original NIS America DVD sets as well, as arguably the video quality is better than the blu-ray. The artbooks are different and the video extras are not identical. There are more creditless endings, but no TV commercials.

The dub, which is new to this blu-ray release, is quite possibly the best dub I have ever heard which is a shocker.",1474243200,,3291,4.537942664418212

8664813,5,B00LACZY08,"Beautiful box. The art book is great to look through with interviews, quick descriptions of the characters, the relationships before and after and some spectacular art. If you are a huge fan of Toradora like I am then this is well worth it. I would also recommend getting the Great Eastern  8"" palm top tiger plushy if you love Toradora. I got both and they are a must have.",1458000000,,374,4.420289855072464
