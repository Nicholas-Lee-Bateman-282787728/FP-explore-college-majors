1806347,5,B0000796CV,"There's no such thing as a bad Father Ted episode. Fathers Ted, Dougal and Jack, along with the inimitable Mrs Doyle, all play equally important parts in the one-of-a-kind comedy. These episodes are superb, but all of them are. It's unrelentingly funny.",1061078400,,253,5.0476190476190474
1806348,5,B0000796CV,"IMHO, this is the best of the three series DVDs. The writing is sharper, the situations more surreal/insane, and the actors are more comfortable being themselves.
Very very funny, and shocking in parts too (like the first episode with the Nazi priests and Father Jack in an SS uniform).
Highly recommended for intelligent and open-minded people!!",1057536000,2,346,5.196428571428571
1806349,4,B0000796CV,"I was initially a bit hesitant to buy this DVD after reading the reviews complaining about the re-recording issues.  Yes occasionally there are some 'squiggly' bits in a corner, but nothing major at all.  I am a big Father Ted fan, and I believe that the series was REALLY building up some momentum with the third series, and therefore some of the best editions can be found on this DVD.  I just wish there were more!  I highly recommend this to all Father Ted fans!",1054080000,4,466,4.447058823529412
1806350,5,B0000796CV,My only complaint is that there aren't more episodes.  My favorite has to be the Christmas episode when the priests get caught in the lingerie section of the department store.  I recommend this video to everyone. :),1051315200,,215,4.783783783783784
1806351,3,B0000796CV,"This is by far the best fresh sitcom on DVD today. It's therefore sad the DVD compression is visible at times. I agree with another reviewer -- the compression of all episodes onto one single disc is leaving drop-outs and ""slow-motion"" incidents, probably because the full framerate cannot be kept.
And what is up with the horrible non-skippable BBC commercial before the menu appears? Don't you just hate that?
5 stars if the mastering was done properly.",1050969600,,455,4.922077922077922
1806352,5,B0000796CV,"...I bought my copy of Father Ted Vol. 3 from Amazon.com, and I've watched it almost everyday since it arrived in the post.  I've collected all three of the Father Ted DVD sets, and I must say that this is the best.  The discs contain 9 episodes of Father Ted and happily two are my very favorite of the entire series, ""Are You Right There,  Father Ted?"" and ""Speed 3"".  I watch these episodes all the time and I laugh just as hard everytime!  In ""Are You There, Father Ted?"", Father Ted accidently offends the Chinese community on Craggy Island, and everytime he attempts to apologize, something happens to make matters worse!  Of course, that's what's expected in the life of Father Ted.  And in ""Speed 3"", Father Ted discovers that the local milkman, has been having improper relations with the women on Craggy Island and has him fired.  The vengful milkman attaches a bomb to the bottom of the milkcar that Father Dougal has taken upon himself to takeover.  The bomb is activated when the milkcar goes over 4 mph, and it's up to Father Ted to save Father Dougal.  Yes, it is as silly as it sounds which makes it so funny!
The picture of the DVD is crystal clear and the sound is perfect.  Also, there are tons of Special Features offered on the second DVD that will keep you laughing for ages.  The only disappointment is know that there will be no more Father Ted since the sudden passing of Dermot Morgan, who played Father Ted Crilly. However, thankfully we fans have him forever or these wonderful DVD's to keep us laughing for years to come and remember the joy and laughter he brought to us.",1049414400,2,1601,4.482758620689655

1806354,5,B0000796CV,"Great characters & great scripts characterize this DVD set. Father Ted is so well thought out that even a very serious topic, such as racism, is handled in a humorous way but at the same time forces you to think and reflect. Sad to think there will be no more episodes made, but thank goodness these exist to entertain and challenge us.",1047427200,2,336,4.435483870967742
1806355,5,B0000796CV,"Plain and simple - Its great! I finally got to see ""The mainland"" episode! I never saw it on BBC America, unless I missed it sometime, I don't think it was aired. This set has so many extras! The episodes even have sections that BBCA cut out from time to time, to make them fit in 30 minute time slots, I guess. If you love Father Ted as I do, you HAVE to get this!
Dermot, you are VERY MUCH missed! Too bad more of this wonderful show could not have been made! Series 1,2 and 3 plus the Christmas episode was not enough! This cast was perfect!",1047340800,5,544,4.046296296296297
1806356,5,B0000796CV,"Finally the long awaited final season of Father Ted comes to DVD! Season 3 originally aired from March to May 1998 and it is just as strong as Seasons 1 & 2 in writing, laughs, and brilliant performances by Dermot Morgan (Ted), Ardal O'Hanlon (Dougal), Frank Kelly (Jack), and Pauline McLynn (Mrs. Doyle).  Its obvious that Father Ted would not have ended as soon as it did if not for the unfortunate and untimely passing of Dermot Morgan (1952-1998) at age 45.  Its also completely understandable that the show could not continue without him.  Father Ted is one of the most original and hilarious sitcoms ever and like another sitcom on BBC video, Black Adder, it accomplished more in its 24 episodes than countless other sitcoms did in hundred episode runs: Brilliant writing and laughs that only increase with each episode.  God Bless Father Ted and all those involved in creating this masterpiece.  The season 3 DVD set consists of 2 DVDs with all 8 episodes.  I'm also very happy to say that the '96 Christmas special is also included which was recently released in the U.K. as a separate DVD!  Here's the episodes on this set:
1. Are you right there, Father Ted?
2. Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep
3. Speed 3
4. The Mainland
5. Escape from Victory
6. Kicking Bishop Brennan up the Arse
7. Night of the Nearly Dead
8. Going to America

1806469,5,B0000796CV,"And so it comes to an end... if it was possible to give this series a higher rating than five stars I would... Series 3 of ""Father Ted"" is the ultimate Ted experience, outdoing the series before (which was hysterical) by miles of laughter and weirdness.
Ted (Dermot Morgan), Dougal (Ardal O'Hannlon), Jack (Frank Kelly), and Mrs. Doyle have more adventures on Craggy Island and the situations run the gamut this time from racism (played for laughs to hilarious effect) to a man-child crooner for old ladies, to being assaulted by a famous TV actor on the mainland, to a dare by Rugged Island priests that Ted has to kick a certain someone up the behind... I won't spoil anything by revealing who is the recipient of this massive kick!  There's also a hilarious ""high drama"" episode where Dougal fills in for a randy milkman who's been delivering more than milk to the ladies of Craggy Island... only for Ted to find out that the spurned dairy-man put a bomb on Dougal's milk truck!!
At last Mrs. Doyle (actress Pauline McLynn) comes into her own in this series with a good deal more attention paid to her character than in the past two series (though Ted and Dougal with Jack remain at the heart of the show).  However, the laughter of this series is tinged with a drop of melancholy when you realize that the day after filming wrapped for this series in 1998 (confirmed to be the last by the writers) Dermot Morgan died of a massive heart attack.  Morgan's untimely death hangs a bit of a pall on the show, forever scuppering the chance of a return by Ted and co. for a one off special, and the tragedy that Dermot Morgan, a comedian by trade, might have found success after Ted.
Still, we will always have the gut-ripping laughter of this final series to keep us entertained and recall the talent of this little band of actors.  In memory of the laughter we continue to find in Ted and friends, let me conclude with a special Gloria:

""Glory be to Ted, and to Dougal, and to Jack, and to Mrs. Doyle
as they were in the '90s, are now, and ever shall be,
comedy without end  AMEN""",1409443200,,2080,4.4605263157894735

For those new to the comedy,I can only say you will not be disappointed,it is highly amusing,skilfully-performed by the actors involved(it could so easily be overdone)and of a high standard. The viewers already familiar with the show will find this series to be the best of them all with some classic characters such as the enthusiastic Father Noel and Pat Mustard the randy milkman. The writers have created bizarre and surreal situations which include,spectacle-stealing crows and an over seventies five-a-side-soccer competition. I have wondered whether a similar situation with protestant priests would work as well but my Catholic friends assure me it would not.",1239840000,,808,5.3203125

1806499,5,B0000796CV,"It is probably cheaper and better to buy the box set as there are 5 episodes per disc and 4 discs in total. Father Ted ran for three seasons for a total of 25 episodes. The sound is Dolby 2.0 Stereo. The frame is 1.33:1. It is unknown if Season three was supposed to be another Season one with a shorter run of 6 episodes or 10 episodes as Season two did. In the end we get 8 episodes of Season three. ""Are You Right There, Father Ted?"" has Ted accidentally appearing looking like Hitler after he is mistaken by a local Chinese community as a fascist. ""Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep"" is the King of the Sheep 98' competition. If you like sheep you will like this one. ""Speed 3"" may be one of the funniest television episodes ever when Dougal's milk float is rigged to explode if he drops below 4 mph. This episode is widely considered one of the best, if the not the best comedy TV instalments ever aired. ""The Mainland"" sees Ted & co. leaving Craggy Island for a trip when all hell breaks loose. Jack goes to an AA meeting! If you want to see a 5 a side - over 75 - football match then look no further than ""Escape from Victory"". Will Ted's fake rubber arms fool the referee? ""Kicking Bishop Brennan up the A*se"" is exactly what it means. Here Ted in a forfeit to Dick Burn must kick Bishop Brennan while Dougal takes the photograph. It is a gem in the series. ""Night of the Nearly Dead"" is a pull on the Irish singer Daniel O' Donnel who is loved by all women over the age of 50. Here he visits Craggy Island to see Mrs. Doyle only for Ted to find that the house is under siege by the elderly-zombies who are dying to see their favorite singer. ""Going to America"" is the final episode of the series. Her Ted is offered his own parish in California which he thinks he can cash in on. The only catch is that he can't take Dougle, Jack or Mrs. Doyle with him. It ends with a lovely montage of all the episodes. It appears that this episode may have been the last one on the schedule to be shot and that there was talk that Father Ted would end with this season. After shooting Dermot Morgan (Father Ted) announced that ""I don't want to be the next Clive Dunn and end up playing the same character for years."" This was taken to mean that effectively the Father Ted series had finished. He said that he was working on a new comedy television series. It is believed that this would be about two retired football players living together, but just weeks before the first episode of Season three was to air, during a dinner party in his home, Dermot Morgan had a sudden massive heart attack and died. He was only 45. It seems that the ending of last episode of Season three is still cut short as if something has been removed and the montage put in instead. It actually ends on a sort of a sad note, happy, but sad and a tribute to this great character, man and series. There was nothing like Father Ted and there will never be again.",1164585600,,2922,4.210338680926916

1806501,5,B0000796CV,"Sadly, the last series of Father Ted, though it has eight episodes against the general six (though the second series had ten episodes - it gets confusing - as Dougal would say).

My favourites are MAINLAND where Ted and Dougal get stuck in some old caves, and SPEED 3, where Dougal is a temporary milkman on a milkfloat that cannot go under 4 miles an hour. GOING TO AMERICA is a fitting finale, with a montage of previous episodes as tribute to Dermot Morgan who died after filming finished.

The humour is quite layered (like the Simpsons) with subtle satirical references to the Church as well as good old fashioned slapstick (Father Jack throwing his 'pet' brick at Father Ted's head).

This is the most innovative comedy ever on British TV, with good old fashioned sit-com values, but with a touch of surrealism - buy it today!",1133740800,2,832,4.64625850340136

1806503,5,B0000796CV,"The third and final series of Father Ted consists of 8 fantastic episodes. While possibly not quite as great as the second series, the series still bows out on a high note, as Father Ted himself  (Dermot Morgan) died right after the season was shot - a poignant montage of highlights from all three series marks the end of the last episode, a fitting way to make his legacy.
None of this should overshadow 8 brilliant half hours that range from farcical to surreal.  The running ""phone"" jokes from the second series are largely absent, but a bunch of old characters re-appear.  Perhaps the best episode is Speed 3, where Dougal must keep a milk float above 4 mph or be blown to pieces (""The Poseidon Adventure - there was a priest in that!"").
The second DVD includes the 1996 Christmas special, an hour-long episode that is equally hilarious -although at times one does get the feeling that the writers are knowingly stretching some jokes to fill time (a la the Simpsons), for example at the start when Ted opens the door to find a baby that has been left there by mistake and then the mother comes an picks it up ""Oh can you imagine us looking after a baby?  I'm sure there'd be all kinds of hilarious mistakes and funny incidents"".
Classic, Postmodern, Ironic, Surreal and iconoclastic - long may Father Ted live on in our hearts and minds...",1077840000,13,1344,4.564315352697095
1806504,5,B0000796CV,"Although I was only ten or so when the first series of Father Ted was screened on British TV, along with many I was an instant fan. So of course my family and I were extremely upset when we heard that Dermot Morgan had died, and that we would never see another episode.
However, Father Ted's co writer Graham Linehan went on to help create `Black Books' - A british comedy started in 2001, which is just as good - if not better. The main character is again an Irishman, played by Dylan Moran, who runs a bookshop in London, hates his customers and is perpetually drunk (a plus for fans of father Jack). The show won many awards in Britain. Unfortunately it appears that this programme isn't yet available in the US, but I would advise anyone to try to get their hands on it (Amazon.co.uk has both series), it has me in stiches.",1075939200,6,827,4.341935483870968
1806505,5,B0000796CV,"you must buy this, father ted is the funniest show ever( just ahead of simpsons and south park). ok, here's how i would rate the episodes:
1)Are You Right There Father Ted? 5/5 this is sooo funny. ted does a china man impression but little does he know chineese men are staring in the window at him. he is called a racist by the whole town.
2)Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep: 3/5 prob the worst episode on the dvd but still funny. the sheep's picture turned sideways to make it look different is classic. you have to see it.
3)Speed 3: 5/5 ,ok let me get something clear, this is the funniest episode of father ted ever. jack gets a pet brick and ted keeps gettin hit on the head with it - classic.
4)The Mainland: 4/5 mrs doyle gets into a fight with her friend over who will pay for their tea, jack sends a man to hospital and ted get beaten up by a famous actor. a must see.
5)Escape from Victory: 4/5 ted cheats in an over 75's soccer tournament and has to kick bishop brennan up the arse!
6)Kicking Bishop Brennan up the Arse: 4/5 ted finally kicks him up the ass and acts like nothing has happened. the bishop find out and comes back to get ted...
7)Night of the Nearly Dead: 3/5 loads of old women turn to zombies trying to touch a local young male celebrity. this episode has some good quotes
8)Going to America: 4/5 this episode has probably the best story and the lease laughs but that is not a bad thing. i loved this episode and it was the last one ever of an amazing series!

7975224,5,B0000796CV,"I loved this show and had to own all three seasons on dvd. Season three was so funny, I wish they had been able to make more. The show is set on a lonely rural island in Ireland and the characters are hysterical! Speed 3 is one of the funniest episodes I have ever seen, it's worth the price for the dvd just for this episode.
