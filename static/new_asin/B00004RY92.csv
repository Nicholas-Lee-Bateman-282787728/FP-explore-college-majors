7921449,4,B00004RY92,this video is for the really advanced dancers.  the salsa steps are really fantastic but be forewarned that the steps here may give you broken bones.,1355184000,,149,4.730769230769231
7921450,2,B00004RY92,"Honestly, I enjoyed watching this video. The bloopers were great, too. But I really didn't care for the combos so much. None of them would I use on any social dance setting. I am into performances, but I would rather watch Emily Alabi, Salsa y Control (Johnny and Andres Giraldo), Cobo Brothers, Al Espanoza, or Eddie the salsa freak. On the other hand, I really don't like salsa competition (namely Mayan salsa competition).

Is this video entertaining? Yes. But do I find it useful? No!

On top of that the music selection for this video is very bad.",1223424000,,552,4.622448979591836
7921451,5,B00004RY92,"This salsa video that features moves by Rogelio Moreno and Josie Neglia displays some unique salsa steps that have been mastered by both with the utmost technique. Of course Rogelio and Josie make the steps look smooth and effortless however don't be fooled this is some great salsa coreographed by two great dancers.
The video is well organized as it is broken down into 4 sections:
footwork, turns, dips & drops, lifts & flips. In each section the moves are first shown without music and then with music thus giving you and idea of how the moves flow together with music once mastered. The explanations by Josie and Rogelio are clear and their movements are well syncronized as they display each step in the routines.
The only downfall in this video is that the steps need to be broken down a bit more. Although geared toward advanced salsa dancers some of the moves require a secondary breakdown analysis. Instead the viewer will have to rewind several times in order to see the steps over again.
Overall the video is an excellent display of very advanced salsa variations and if you do manage to master some of their art work you will be the envy of many in any salsa nightclub around the world. I highly recommend the purchase of this video for advanced salsa dancers.",1012953600,16,1273,4.662222222222222
7921452,4,B00004RY92,"An excellent instructional video, with some weaknesses. The level is intermediate-advanced to advanced. Rogelio's agility is incredible; his technique is clean-cut and flashy. Josie needs no introductions, she's superb. Their count is 123/567, LA style. If you dance other styles of Salsa you'd have to make some adjustments.
The video shows every step and turn pattern once without music and twice with music. This is how they are able to condense a maximum number of steps and patterns in a total of 45 minutes, which, unfortunately, comes at the expense of explanation. I suppose they gloss over much explanation because the video is geared towards the advanced dancer; personally, however, I would prefer a bit more elaboration on some of the more complicated stuff. Also, the steps are shown only from the front. I would have much preferred that it would all be shown from both front and back angles. Finally, some of the material is not easy to lead to an unsuspecting follower.
Overall, if your technique is solid and you're looking for some flashy stuff, especially for performances, you won't be disappointed. It takes a lot of work to master this video. Make sure you've got an advanced partner, and a lot of floor space to practice.",1011225600,4,1243,4.952153110047847

7921454,5,B00004RY92,"Unable to purchase this Video in Manchester, England, I took a chance and ordered Josie's Salsa Advanced Variations Video.  I was very excited and pleased to see the high class dance sequences that both Josie and Rogelio teach. Step by Step, they go through the moves, first the lady, then the man, then partnered.  The shines for both women and men are so professional and challenging to the advanced salsa enthusiast.  At last I found someone who can teach high quality salsa at it's best! I wouldn't hesitate to buy this Video.",991699200,7,530,4.739130434782608
7921455,5,B00004RY92,"I love Josie's Videos because they actually attempt to teach advanced dance.  Both her her and Rogelio are great dancers!
This video contains some jaw dropping moves.  I definately have found my favorite dance series  in any style of dancing.  I would love to have a class with Josie and  learn more about the techniques she shows.  Video teching is hard to do,  but she does a great job.
THANKS JOSIE FOR PUTTING TOGETHER A GREAT  SERIES OF DANCE VIDEOS.  I OWN ALMOST ALL OF THEM AND THEY ARE WORTH EVERY  PENNY.",958953600,8,514,4.489130434782608
7921456,4,B00004RY92,This is a strong LA Style video. The video  starts out with a warning about possible injury's & the flooring you should have for the advanced flips. The sections are divided into into (1) Footwork. Female then Male  shines then together shines. Shines are solo steps done away from your  partner. You can either do the same techniques or your own separate steps.  (2) Turns. From basic to advanced. (3) Dips & Drops. On the Death Drop.  I would ask that you use a palm to palm grip when you are first learning it  then go to fingertips. (4) Lifts & Flips. The techniques range from  advanced Basic to Advanced. Some are awkward & some are finishing  display techniques. In the short demo section in the front of this video is  the most advanced flip which is not taught in this video. It is the last  technique before Josie introduces herself. It only shows the start &  middle of the technique. There are some good techniques in this video. It  even has a good Cuban enfolding turn. It is fast paced & average  length. The only thing wrong with this video is the quality of the tape.  The pause quality is not good.,957484800,14,1116,4.433497536945813
