Instead, nature itself has left proof of the world's youth and that the great flood of Noah's day made the earth look the way it looks today.

The beginning of the dvd is slow but if you can sit through the first 15-20 minutes it starts to pick up speed and gets really interesting.",1415145600,2,426,4.2592592592592595

My husband is a miner and for anyone who knows someone that still has questions about how coal is produced or how the earth formed, then this is the video for you.  I believe that this dvd can impact how some evolutionist think.  Happy Watching.  It is well worth it.",1323734400,4,317,4.233333333333333
