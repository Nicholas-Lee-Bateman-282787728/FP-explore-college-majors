7932566,3,B000056PND,"Ok video - not too long or indepth - but pretty interesting look at behind the scenes NHL day to day player info.

If you have seen the ""mic'd up"" segment on regular hockey tv where they mic up a player - I think it is like that. You get a bit of the players commentary on things but not too much.",1176595200,,297,3.7903225806451615
7932567,5,B000056PND,"I was very pleased with the condition of the item/ was exactly as described- delivery was excellent and it made my husband very happy when I gave it to him!

Thank you",1174608000,,167,4.21875
7932568,2,B000056PND,"Quick shots of the normal crash-bang you see at most games. Short on player comments and experience. I expected more in depth commentary from the players to balance out the presentation fluff which amounted to a lot of flash shots of guys snapping at other guys who may or may not be playing in the same game (the uniforms didn't match up). Don't try and get a full sense of what the players are doing or saying in the locker room; you'll be disappointed. This movie proves the need for a better, more in-depth, and dare I say, hard-core film on the behind-the-scenes exchanges in hockey on and off the ice.",1136419200,3,607,4.4774774774774775
7932569,5,B000056PND,"Buy this DVD; you'll love it. It takes you everywhere you want to be as a hockey fan: inside the lockerroom, alongside the refs, sitting with the draftpicks and even joining an amateur player in a professional game.",1136160000,,215,4.684210526315789
7932570,4,B000056PND,"NHL All Access, hosted by NHL veteran and ESPN analyst Bill Clement, is an entertaining, albeit short, look behind the scenes of the NHL.  From on-ice chatter, to a look at the unsung virtues of the referees and linesmen (that is, BEFORE all this obstruction nonsense), All Access affords hockey fans to get a better feel for how the NHL works.  It's short length is the only thing recommending against a purchase.",1042675200,4,414,4.736111111111111
7932571,1,B000056PND,"""All Access"" my @ss.
Where's the cursing? Fighting? Backstabbing? Where's the real NHL?  It is falsely represented on this disc.
This disc is simply clips from ""Cool Shots"" re-edited into a special.
Do not spend your money on this.  I repeat, do not.",1021593600,19,250,4.790697674418604
7932572,4,B000056PND,"Living in Australia, we don't get to see any hockey games on the T.V., but mate, I have to tell ya, I was very pleased with this...it pointed all the major things that we didn't get a chance to see down here. e.g. Lemieux coming out of retirement and Gretzky hanging up his skates. It is a fantastic video for behind the scene views of the hockey world, but if you want more action...then this might not be for you. I hope that people do get the chance to see this. Good on ya, and I hope I helped ya.",1016841600,4,501,4.02
7932573,5,B000056PND,"I was plesantly surprised by this DVD primarily because I expected it to be little more than an hour-long version of 'Cool Shots.' NHL Productions actually does live up to the behind-the-scenes idea with this DVD. The entire program isn't all locker room, coaches, and trainers, though. Those bits are mixed in with the program highlights on Gretzky's retirement, Mario Lemieux's comeback, Patrick Roy's 448th win, and Dan Moriarty's brief stay with the Minnesota Wild. There are also chapters on game preparation for officials and coaches, as well as on-ice communications, hits, and discussion on the fast and spontaneous nature of the game. Beyond the actual program, there are also a ton of bonus chapters to check out along with an interactive section to access with your computer. For fans, this DVD is well worth its purchase price because NHL Productions didn't skimp on it. It doesn't have a lot of game highlights, but what it does have is a refreshing change to NHL Productions' usual product.",1008201600,14,1004,5.017964071856287
