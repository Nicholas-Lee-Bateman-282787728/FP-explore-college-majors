7751230,4,B01FPL06WU,Remembered watching this when it first came out so wanted to relive it again.  First two years were great and then it kind of took an odd turn.  I'm not a fan of being in the present and then going back again so that was a turn off for me.  I got thru it and now when I rewatch it I'll just do the first two years.,1469318400,9,314,3.656716417910448
7751231,4,B01FPL06WU,I love China Beach. Video quality not the best but I'll take it. The product arrived promptly.,1521590400,,94,4.588235294117647
7751232,5,B01FPL06WU,"I had forgotten how well made this series had been.  The acting, the music, and the sets were great!  Dana Delaney did wonderful work in this series.  It brought back memories of the time I spent in Vietnam during that period.",1521504000,,226,4.463414634146342
7751233,4,B01FPL06WU,"A good dramatic show though the period flavor it is honestly not that convincing. Dana Delaney makes a beautiful and very gifted lead.
Now as to Ho's mass-murder. He did this atrocity to his own North Vietnamese in a very brutal 1956 land reform. See the hit book ""Vietnam"" by Ken Burns (book also at amazon) for more on this.",1521072000,,326,4.45
7751234,1,B01FPL06WU,Hard of hearing and no closed caption.  Of no use to me.,1520553600,,56,3.6666666666666665
7751235,5,B01FPL06WU,"Probably the best TV series ever aired. Very happy to finally get the set in good condition. It looks like it's mastered from VCR tapes, not the best quality, but the whole thing is there, minus a few songs that have become too expensive to license.",1519862400,,249,4.434782608695652
7751236,5,B01FPL06WU,"Great product, quick shipping.",1517184000,,30,6.75
7751237,1,B01FPL06WU,"I only gave this a one star because I was told it was awesome, but I am Deaf and rely on closed captioning. They should pull these off the market until it is added!",1515110400,,164,3.8529411764705883
7751238,5,B01FPL06WU,Had previously bought China Beach Series and it turned out to be pirated piece of crap.  This is not that!  This is quality video with all scenes complete. I did not get cheated this time. Need to stop watching and continue later but can't seem to stop and turn it off.,1514505600,,269,4.254901960784314
7751239,5,B01FPL06WU,Love it!!,1511654400,,9,4.0
7751240,3,B01FPL06WU,"It's not like my husband and I remember it. I remembered it as a story of nurses and other women in Vietnam who were courageous and intelligent, as well as kind. I am now in season 3, and I am shocked at it's sexism. The women are all ordered to wear bathing suits in a fake beauty pageant  while the men catcall them. It's supposed to be something for the guys, but I think this is going too far. Someone who volunteers in a war shouldn't be ordered to make themselves into a sex object. It's one thing when they put up with the guys teasing them that way, but it's quite another to be ordered to be sex object because Miss America was supposed to come to China Beach, and didn't.",1511568000,,681,4.159090909090909
7751241,5,B01FPL06WU,The product arrived intact. Will review the content after I watch it. It is behind the Vietnam War series.,1508716800,,106,4.631578947368421
7751242,5,B01FPL06WU,I love this series. You fall in love with the people of China Beach.,1508112000,,68,3.9285714285714284
7751243,5,B01FPL06WU,It's exactly what I wanted.,1506038400,,27,4.6
7751244,5,B01FPL06WU,Hated to come to the end. Watched all four seasons in one week. I have purchased the book it was based on,1504569600,,105,3.8181818181818183
7751245,5,B01FPL06WU,Still unopened but happy with 4 pack!,1503014400,,37,4.428571428571429
7751246,4,B01FPL06WU,"Sorry that some of the iconic scenes have been cut, presumably because of music rights.  (Lorette belting out ""They'll be blue birds over.......)",1501718400,,145,5.304347826086956
7751247,5,B01FPL06WU,"Great packaging, great quality printing on DVD's and good quality of image of videos. Don't expect anything better than how it was originally broadcast. On your 4K TV it will not look so great but that is normal. It's recorded in Standard Definition. I am super glad they decided to keep the original 60's music by the original artist! It may have taken them some time to release it on DVD due to this because of royalties, but SO worth it!
Get the set, it's the best!",1501027200,2,468,4.390804597701149
7751248,5,B01FPL06WU,At the time this was out I was way to busy with life to watch every episode.  I did remember it was very good.  I remember correctly!  Get it great price.  With things going on in the world now you better watch all the way thru so we never forget.,1499212800,,247,3.88
7751249,4,B01FPL06WU,"The attention to military detail is wanting and the writer's room wouldn't know continuity if it bit them in the butt but the series is spot on with the feel  of the Vietnam War and the emotions of the people who lived it. The soundtrack has a lot to do with that and it was very wise for the producers of this DVD series to have gone to the trouble and expense of acquiring the rights. Anouther very good series that originally ran about the same time was ""Tour of Duty"" which was superior in it's military detail and continuity but the DVD release is drastically diminished by the failure to acquire the rights to the original music. A couple of China Beaches stand out episodes for me were the ones where Ricky Lake's character plays out a sad and emotional story in a series of scenes that run backwards in time. The second is an episode that takes place when McMurphy is on leave visiting a fellow nurse, Kathy Bates, who upon  returning to her civilian nursing career found it didn't value her combat hospital skills and seemed very unfulfilling so she has moved to San Francisco to work in a veterans hospital.",1499126400,2,1117,4.470588235294118

7751263,4,B01FPL06WU,"They put a lot into getting the music sorted for this, and it sounds good. The video quality is as good as it was broadcast in 1988, which looks a bit rough on modern 4K HDTV sets of today. Still, being my first watch of this series since 1991 (i taped Tour of Duty and watched China Beach back then as they were on at the same time in a network rating war), it was good and as gripping as it was back in the day. It's worth getting if you're a fan of the show.",1492128000,6,461,3.8125

8761171,5,B01FPL06WU,"Great series that is not on any of the services I could find (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon)",1533254400,,84,4.3125
8761172,5,B01FPL06WU,"This show now is a second look back at a series that when new was a look back. Because of that it has aged very well. As a Vietnam era Marine I am still impressed with its accuracy even though I am aware of its errors. This series has a strong feeling of time and place and this,enhanced by the soundtrack of the times transports me back to the days of jungle boots, utilities and od green t shirts. This was powerful tv for its time and that power has easily transcended the last 25 years. Dana Delany  here truly shines in the role of a lifetime. The rest of the regular and guest cast is also outstanding and production values are high. Many of these episodes are both heart and gut wrenching and always with intended messaging. If you haven't flown in a Huey helicopter you will feel like it. I highly recommend this series .",1530489600,,829,4.280254777070064
8761173,5,B01FPL06WU,Can't wait to start watching this show. I must have been living on an iceberg when it first came out but now I have a chance to catch up with the rest of the world.,1530489600,,164,3.7142857142857144

8761175,5,B01FPL06WU,"A series every American senior citizen should watch.  The American people were lied to during the Viet Nam war and tens-of-thousands of Americans died as a result.  This incredibly heartfelt story is based on actual fact & the actors/actresses portray real-life people and the roles they played in this brutal conflict.  Whoever said ""war is hell"" got it right, and China Beach provides a terrifying portal into that horrific reality.",1529193600,,434,5.171428571428572
