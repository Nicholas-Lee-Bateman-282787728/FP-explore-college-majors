8162144,4,B000LMPK48,Muskurahat is a not so well known good movie.  The story plays out well as the movie progrsses with a good mix of comedy and drama.  Good acting by Amrish Puri along with other actors.  I saw this movie many years ago and it made a lasting impression on me mainly for the good jokes nestled properly with a reality base.  It has unique humor not commonly found in other Hindi(Bollywood) films.  When I saw it been sold on Amazon I grabbed it.  It comes with english subtitles.  I believe it is a good addition to my collection.  Would be a pleasure to see this film more than once.,1202860800,2,581,4.26605504587156
