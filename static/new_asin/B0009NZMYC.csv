2306212,5,B0009NZMYC,"These episodes are the early black and white shows not broadcast since original airdates (approx. 26 mins each). Each of the 20 episodes are preceded by a new introduction by actress Linda Kaye Henning. There is a great 45 minute ""Making Of"" documentary that will have you saying ""He's still alive!"" and ""So that's why she left!"".  The surviving cast's memories of working on the show are still sharp, and you will learn a few new things.  There is also about 20 minutes of CAST COMMERCIALS where the stars do the sponsor's commercials in their Hooterville roles.  This set will remind you of an innocent time gone by.

My only complaint is that the picture quality of the shows is grainier that other TV shows from major DVD distributors. The transfers were made from film prints rather than the original negatives.  The audio is a little muffed at times and could have been cleaned up.

If you're ever feeling blue or just tired of the rat race, hopping on the Hooterville Cannonball and spending some time at the Shady Rest is like tonic to the soul.

The bonus features are wonderful also and Linda Kaye Henning's commentary is superb. I'm so thrilled these old friends are once again back in my life. I hope they'll come out with all seven seasons of this classic show.",1207267200,7,498,4.297872340425532

I remember them from my childhood and I grew up in an area wiyh people remarkably similar to those in Hooterville and also enjoyed the Hooterville documentary and the other added interviews. I can watch them over and over again,

I hope they bring the rest of the seasons episodes out on dvd SOON!!!",1169164800,11,480,4.454545454545454
2306268,4,B0009NZMYC,I'm only giving this four stars because of the commentary made before each episode.  Putting that on a bonus track or something so it can be shut off would be helpful to those of us who just want to see the show.  The talk got annoying as I just wanted to watch and enjoy the show.  I also didn't know that there had been other Billie Jo's and Bobbie Jo's so this was a surpise but I look forward to other seasons so that I can see the actresses I grew up watching.  This is a wonderful series and I look forward to more seasons in the future!,1157760000,9,543,4.0
2306269,5,B0009NZMYC,"Kudos to the poster below who ackowledges Linda Kaye Henning!  I also hope she reads these reviews as well.  I grew up with ""Petticoat Junction"", ""Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Green Acres"".  But ""Junction"" was my favorite.....maybe it was the girls.....

Anyhow, the show works brilliantly on all counts.  I had never seen these early episodes.  I didn't start watching until 1965 or 1966 when I was five.  And I only knew Lori Saunders and Meredith MacRae as Bobbie Jo and Billie Jo.  To see Jeaninne Riley and Pat Woodell as the original ""Bradley Girls"" is interesting.  But I would like MPI to release the rest of the seasons in their entirety.  Linda Kaye Henning does do a superb job introducing each episode!  Her charm and beauty are still evident today and it is indeed obvious that she is proud of the show!!  With good reason;  the chemistry between all the characters is unbelievable.  There are also some great bonus features as well (maybe to compensate for the ""missing"" episodes that were not included in the collection).  There are original ""commercials"" that that cast did for their sponsors..""Ivory Soap"" and ""Tide"" detergent.  They are fun to watch.  There is also an interview with Bea Benaderet on the Art Linkletter show.  What a funny lady!!  Most importantly in these features is a documentary called ""Back to Hooterville"" where Paul Henning's legacy to television is chronicled and includes interviews with Henning, Gunilla Hutton (the second Billie Jo), Frank Cady (Sam Drucker), CHarles Lane (Homer Bedloe), Mike Minor (Steve Elliot) and Lori Saunders (the beautiful Bobbie Jo).  Lori Saunders has also lost nothing of her charm and beauty.  It is evident that she too is proud to have been a part of this wonderful program.  They all talk about Bea Benaderet fondly and it is evident she was quite a lady!!  I wish they had mentioned Meredith MacRae more.  She was a class act too, taken from us much too young and she is my favorite of all the Billie Jos.  All in all a wonderful program to cherish and escape from the ""trash"" of today's television!!  So, please, Linda Kaye Henning, if you read this, we thank you and ask you to do whatever is possible to have MPI release the rest of the seasons!",1152144000,56,2224,4.771653543307087
2306270,5,B0009NZMYC,"Linda Kaye Henning - if you read this - Thank you.  Thank you very much!!!

I tear up thinking about what an incredible entertainment program Petticoat Junction is.  It has charm (throughout), drama (Homer Bedlow -boo, hiss), high production values (exterior shots), sentimentality (who can forget Kate and Floyd's touching good-bye to Charley), grief (Bea Benaderet's illness and subsequent passing), touching moments (Kate pulling up the blanket after Bobbie Jo's all-night party), and, of course, humor.

I will also have to add Petticoat Junction boasts a cast who CAN ACT.  Paul Henning was brilliant in developing and writing this show.  I am thankful the comedy is was not as broad as the comedy on the Hillbillies or Green Acres.

I can not say enough about Bea Benaderet.  She is simply one of those actresses who mesmerize me when she is on-screen.  I can not take my eyes off of her.  She is superb is every scene!  I still mourn her passing every October 13.  She deserves recognition for her work.

Naturally, we wonder what would have happened had Kate not passed away.  I wonder if Bobbie Jo's statement to Dr. Craig that she was ""the only one left"" was the tribute to Kate.  I wonder what would have happened if Rosemary DeCamp had stayed on. I wonder what would have happened had the delightful Shirley Mitchell had stayed around longer.  I wonder what eventually became of the girls.

I am overjoyed to see the beautiful and poised Linda Kaye Henning introducing each episode.  It is wonderful to see Linda again.  (She is also in the 1963 version of Bye Bye Birdie). I get the feeling that she understands how special this series is to so many of us.  You are a testament to your dad's vision.

And these intros!!!!!!!!  What a blessing!!!  These intros are extremely informative and well written.  One wonders why other programs do not have the same format.

I want to add one bit of trivia.  I was raised in east Tennessee. I remember in the 1960's the March of Dimes Teleramas were an annual event in our area.  Linda Kaye Henning came to Knoxville.  Lori Saunders and Meredith MacCrae came to Kingsport-Bristol (Tri-Cities) for the Telerama.  They were poised and did a wonderful job.  Even when they did not know the camera was on them and we saw an unexpected shot of them, they all seemed to be genuinely nice, respectful, and well-mannered people.

Please, Please Let's have more of the Petticoat Junction set.  I will be one of the first in line to buy them.

Some like Mayberry, but for me, put me up at the Shady Rest anyday!

Bless you, Linda Kaye Henning and Thank you

Dave",1151712000,24,2606,4.677704194260485
2306271,5,B0009NZMYC,Thanks for bringing back a wonderful childhood memory.  I appreciate your professionalism.,1151280000,6,90,6.5
2306272,5,B0009NZMYC,"This is a pretty nice set of Petticoat Junction episodes. The extras are terrific and the episode intro's Linda Kaye does are excellent. I particularly love the original commercials for Ivory and Tide the cast perform in character. The episodes are direct film transfer, however and it shows but amazingly does not detract from one's enjoyment. The images are clear and bright. It's great to see the CBS and Filmways logos intact on these prints and make these programs more special. One thing I'd advise anyone who purchases this three disc set; watch them immediately upon purchase to be sure they will play properly. I had trouble with disc #3; halfway through, it froze and would not continue. I was also not able to access the extras as the disc apparently had compression errors. I tried it on three different machines and had the same trouble on all of them. I got a replacement set and now all is well. Other than that, I highly recommend any PJ fan to buy these discs. I hope the rest of the series will be released soon. Very enjoyable, indeed.",1150848000,5,1054,4.641711229946524
2306273,5,B0009NZMYC,"I admit, I started watching ""Petticoat Junction"" at the tender age of three or four, shortly after it came out and fell forever head-over-heels in love with it.  My kids received this last Christmas and late one night I decided to start watching.

Little did I realize what a trip down Memory Lane this would be.  From the moment I started, everything was again right in the world.  I laughed, I cried, I chuckled, and just like when I was a kid, I wanted to smack Uncle Joe upside the head for being such a jerk!  (Oh yes--he's a jerk, no doubt about it! LOL)

Okay, so maybe the image quality isn't perfect.  Big deal.  It certainly wasn't great on our 1963 b/w TV, either.  In reality, the lesser quality is a lot like listening to records on a hi-fi--it's so nostalgic that a person can't help but feel like they've been sent back in time to a more carefree era of life.

I am completely savoring and enjoying every episode in this set.",1150416000,4,940,4.350574712643678
2306284,5,B0009NZMYC,"There is no vintage TV classic that better represents the good old days more than ""Petticoat Junction."" Creator Paul Henning, who had been with George Burns & Gracie Allen for a decade on radio and TV and then created the wonderful ""Bob Cummings Show"" (aka ""Love That Bob""), started his rural comedy success with ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and followed with ""Petticoat."" The stars Bea Benaderet and Edgar Buchanan are top-notch character actors and stellar comics. These long-lost 20 episodes from the show's first (of seven) seasons are treasures. Plus the all-new ""History of Hooterville"" 45 minute documentary is worth the price alone to see interviews with original cast members and rare outtakes. Also, the cast doing sponsor commercials is a lot of fun and series star Benaderet on a talk show is endearing. This is a must-have collection for classic TV fans and hopefully the rest of the series will follow on DVD. This is also the only ""Petticoat"" DVD release to date to receive an official endoresement from the creator's estate and to feature the beloved theme song over the opening credits...'Come ride the little train that is rolling down the track to the junction...""",1145145600,14,1180,5.025510204081633
2306285,5,B0009NZMYC,"I really enjoyed seeing the old gang again.  I had never seen the original cast members and have always been curious.  I remember watching reruns of the later episodes as a kid and for some reason, this show has always meant a lot to me.  I would love to see the later episode on DVD and if that should  happen I will definitely purchase that collection as well.",1142812800,5,362,4.279411764705882

2306287,4,B0009NZMYC,"This is mostly black and white episodes of the series, going back to the first season.  Contains interviews with the original cast and provides much background concerning how the show was started.

2306288,5,B0009NZMYC,"This is the entire first season of PJ, and I for one, hope we will see the rest released in a similar format.  Linda Kaye Henning does a sensational job introducing each episode with lots of 'trivia' and information about the show and cast, and for a 'die hard PJ fan' it really added to the enjoyment.

Quality of the dvd is excellent, but is in the original black and white format.  Also the original theme music at the start of each episode is great to hear after so many 'copy' dvd's without the theme on them.",1141084800,4,514,4.278350515463917
2306289,5,B0009NZMYC,"When a show this old can make a 14 year old (my son) laugh harder than a contemporary television show, well, that's got to tell you something.
Yes, the comedy is quaint compared to today's 'in-your-face' style. There is nothing controversial: no alternative lifestyle, no political pontificating, no strong sexual content or ""colorful"" language. Just the traditional homespun pro American Values that seem to be missing in our society (and TV shows) today.
Although I grew up on this show, I was a bit too young when these original black & white episodes came out, so all I remember are the shows that were in color.
The cast is simply perfect. My son cracks up every time Uncle Joe shows his face, and how could he not? Edgar Buchanan was the most under-rated comedian of his time! My favorite Bradley girl in these earlier shows (up until she got married) was Betty Jo. After that time it became Bobbie Jo. But by that time, the show had lost it for me. Once Steve joined  the cast (and especially after the replacing of Kate when Bea Benaderet passed away) the show lost that charm that it always had.
But, I'm getting way ahead of myself here. I am just enjoying every minute that I have with the original Petticoat Junction family. And the intros by Linda Kay Henning are very well done and informative.
Thank you, Powers That Be, for allowing these wonderful gems to be released!
My hope is that the rest of the first season will be out soon, followed by the subsequent seasons. I'll buy them all (at least the first few seasons!)!
(By the way, if you are wondering about the title of this review, watch the first episode.)
Now, can someone please give me directions to the Shady Rest so I can sample some of Kate Bradley's home-cooking? I can't seem to locate it on Mapquest!",1139616000,8,1782,4.56875

This is magnificent for all the enthusiasts of classic, ""olden"", situational TV sitcoms. I appreciate the shows playing in chronological order; that is a plus because the audience can easily follow the plot from one episode to the next. The plot and characters are explained between episodes in detail for those not already familiar with the show. There is not much to really say about this DVD package except for PERFECT!

Turns out I was hooked and in love with the Hooterville ""Cannonball"". So imagine my excitement when this collection of B&W episodes became available with the orignal theme song(what a tune!!). I was like a kid at Christmas! I bought the Columbia House vhs collection some years ago and was only exposed to several of the classic B&W's.  Oh.. how I longed to see the others.  Now,thanks to MPI it has become a reality and a beginning of sorts to bring back the best of Petticoat Junction!! I can truly say..a job well done! I hope the sales of this collection prompts the release of the remaining 1st season and the 2nd..There is a lot of classic still yet to see!

2306293,4,B0009NZMYC,"I must admit that I am a couple of years too young to remember the original Billie and Bobbie Jo's--and I'm not crazy about those original actresses! I loved this quaint, wholesome program as a child (I come from an all-girl family), and watched it religiously. If you liked the program originally, you will love to revisit all the goofy, sweet denizens of Hooterville.  My 10 year-old daughter watched about 8 episodes in a row when she was home sick recently.  I had forgotten how very funny Uncle Joe was--and how much he reminded me of my dad (who was also named Joe).  This world is sometimes a sad and scary place--going ""home"" to Hooterville is infinitely comforting--which is probably why my daughter enjoyed it so much.",1129852800,6,728,4.716535433070866
2306304,4,B0009NZMYC,This DVD is just like I remembered from the old show. I can't wait until the rest of the series is out on DVD so I can get the complete set.,1128643200,5,140,3.5483870967741935
2306305,5,B0009NZMYC,"My in-laws live with us (we get along--really).
I bought this collection so that all 4 of us could enjoy a GOOD TV show at the same time.  My wife and I were a just a bit too young to see these the first time around and my father-in-law doesn't recall seeing them at all.

That being said this is required viewing in our home now.
We've finished watching episodes 1-7 and we all only remembered 1 ep (Lord and Lady cologne) of the seven.  We really like the intros by Ms. Henning too.

MPI video did a great job with these shows. They look great for being over 40 years old.  Sure they are in Black & White but that's what we love! The sound is decent for an older show too.
MPI did a fantastic job with these discs. I hope more appear soon.

One note for fans: Linda Kaye Henning (Paul Henning's daughter) introduces EVERY episode. She played the youngest Bradley girl.
Paul Henning created this show and Green Acres (plus others!).
From her you get warm memories and background on many stars and later on many guest stars. Her dialogues are mixed with still photos too.  She is wonderful and informative.
While there are no commentaries these 2 to 4 minute intros are more than welcome and in many ways more intimate (since you can see her).

My in-laws don't even know about the cool extras on the other discs. I am saving those for later!

Other shows that we purchased are the Beverly Hillbillies and the Green Acres DVDs.  The Beverly Hillbillies DVDs are very nice.
Sadly, the Green Acres DVDs while a good bargain and looking great come from a larger company and don't have the extras that MPI DVDs feature.

Good Family Viewing!",1128556800,8,1637,4.423333333333333
2306306,5,B0009NZMYC,"Thanks to the folks at MPI Home Video (in partnership with the estate of Paul Henning) for bringing this well-loved series to classic TV fans everywhere.

The 20 episodes from the first season (1963-64) have never seen the light of day in syndication because they were in black and white, yet for me, it was a real treat to enjoy these early shows, along with the classic commercials and network promos. Unlike the other collections that have been in the market, the original theme music is included herein. HALLELUJAH!!!

The ""History of Hooterville"" documentary is a real hoot because it gave us a wonderful glimpse inside the making of this show, along with cast insights. Linda Kaye Henning (Betty Jo) provides very helpful information on each episode.

I share the sentiments of the other people who have reviewed this collection, and here's hoping that a full-season set will be on the way in the near future.",1127692800,3,915,4.852564102564102
2306307,5,B0009NZMYC,"You couldn't ask for a better DVD than this collection. Every episode is very enjoyable you're sure to love this dvd. I never had a chance to see these, as they were never shown in syndication. All the actors/actresses are believeable and Bea Benaderet plays the perfect Mom, this comes through on screen. There was excellent chemistry between the cast and it shows in each show. Each episode is introduced by Linda Henning(Betty Jo Bradley), she shares her thoughts about the show and lets the fans in on some trivia.

This whole dvd is packed with super bonus features such as, The Network promo, the history of Hooterville, Original cast commercials, and Cast interviews. After watching the show and the bonus features, you'll see why Bea Benadaret was such a great well loved actress.",1126915200,3,788,4.880597014925373
2306308,5,B0009NZMYC,"This DVD set should make every ""Petticoat Junction "" fan very, very happy. As evident by the quality, packaging, photos and extras, there was a great deal of thought and caring when this 3 disc set was put together. One thing that really stands out are the episode intros by Linda Kaye Henning. Those intros are jam packed with inside info and trivia. While watching this, you almost feel like you are there visiting with Linda in her own home, she exudes a warmness that is very inviting. And that same warmness is right there in all the 20 episodes featured. These black & white episodes are from the first half of season 1. One thing that stands out is that while ""Petticoat Junction"" was always a rural show, during the first season or two they were REALLY country! Much more so than in later years.

The extras for this set are outstanding!! Fans will love seeing the cast doing the network commercials as well as a color network promo for season 3 and a rare appearence of series star Bea Benederet on a talk show of the day. But the best part of this DVD is the documentary ""The History of Hooterville"". This covers ""Petticoat Junction"" from beginning to end. It features brand new interviews with Linda Kaye Henning (Betty Jo), Frank Cady (Sam Drucker), Charles Lane (Homer Bedloe), Gunilla Hutton (Billie Jo #2), Lori Saunders (Bobbie Jo #2), Mike Minor (Steve Elliot), Shirley Mitchel (Cousin Mae) and archive footage of creator and producer, the late Paul Henning. These people really did (and still do) care about their show. And perhaps that is one reason why we fans will always love ""Petticoat Junction"". It's more a state of mind than just a classic sitcom. And in this ever changing world we could use more shows like it. When they say: ""forget about your cares it is time to relax at the junction"", they're not kidding. Run, don't walk and go get your copy of ""Petticoat Junction"" The Ultimate Collection today!!",1126396800,6,1930,4.659824046920821
2306309,5,B0009NZMYC,My favorite show when I was 4 years old (in 1973) in reruns.  I remember the different girls and I believe they showed the B & W's in syndication in early 70s on WTCN in St Paul-Minneapolis but was taken off the air around then.  Thought it was a show I'd outgrown but I love it just as much now.  They put time and effort into these DVDs (wish I could say the same about 21 Jump Street) and hoping to have them all on DVD someday.  One of the all time great shows and worth the $23!,1125878400,3,483,3.8979591836734695
2306310,5,B0009NZMYC,"I always loved this show. Now when I see it as anadult, I love it even more. The simplicity, morals, values. Those adorable characters. All provide a brief respite froom a chaotic world. I've had my DVD set for a few days and have seen about ten episodes. It might just be my set, but on some of the episodes, the dvd ""sticks"" in spots. No big deal. Hope more of this hsow is released soon.",1125619200,,390,4.144736842105263
2306311,5,B0009NZMYC,"This is a great set. It contains 20 episodes from the first season (a 21st is on a companion Xmas DVD) which have never been seen in syndication. The introductions to each episode by cast member Linda Kaye Henning are informative and the 45 minute documentary on the series is very well done. Commericals with the cast in character are also included as well as original network promos.

It would be great to see more released, but the rights to this series are a bit messy and I believe the rest of the episodes are owned by Paramount, so we'll have to campaign to them for release of the rest of the series, not MPI. That's the reason this is not a ""complete season"" set, but don't let that stop you, as what is included here is well worth the price.",1125446400,73,751,4.326241134751773
2306312,5,B0009NZMYC,"Many of these episodes from the early black-and-white broadcasts of Petticoat Junction have not been seen since the 1960's in any form. It does seem a little odd that they would release the first twenty episodes from the first season in order, but skip the Christmas episode - ""Cannonball Christmas"". Columbia House did release a handful of these rare b&w episodes, but then quickly skipped over to the color episodes, which were also being aired at about the same time on Nick-At-Nite's TV Land. It is great to finally get these rare gems on DVD, especially with the original and unforgettable music that was so much a part of the show. I personally can't wait to ""ride that little train to the Junction"" and visit with Kate Bradley and her three lovely daughters again!! I hope there will be many more episodes of Petticoat Junction to come on DVD in the very near future, too!!",1122940800,24,880,4.683870967741935

8063928,5,B0009NZMYC,"This set is more and less than season one episodes.
Linda Henning plays Betty Jo in the series and she also narrates this first season with a lot of background information in between each episode.  (I'm the type of person who likes to learn about casting, characters, and history of this kind of stuff.  But you can believe me, I don't give a **** about KarTrashians, Jersey Shore or a lot of the garbage on television nowadays.) Hennings' narratives are the ""more than"" that you get with this collection.  You can easily skip her comments and move on to the episode she was just talking about if you wish.
The ""less than"" is this.  Henning tells us that things were a little different with Petticoat Junction and television shows of the day.  Shows of that time had (about) 32 shows per season (I hope I got this correct).  This set is less than complete with 20 plus episodes.  So, from Hennings words, I will tell you this is not the entire season.  Not knowing what episodes were omitted, I don't know what I'm missing and this doesn't bother me much.  I do like to learn about PJ and I'm happy with this ""trade-off"".  This set is more than what I expected even though it has less than the entire season of episides.
I'd give this about 4.8 stars, I simply like the show.",1512432000,2,1275,4.4334763948497855
