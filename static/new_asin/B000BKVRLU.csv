2423112,5,B000BKVRLU,"This dvd is great to own. Dic is really trying to release the classics again and that's what we need. I actually like the episode entitled, ""The lost Mushroom."" Indiana Joe has no face but yet he can talk. I found that funny when I was younger and I still do to this day. I also like the episode of ""Robo Koopa."" Have kids? Get them they're favorite bowl of something, sit them down, and put this on for them. They'll be entertained! You won't regret getting this. The hole family can dnjoy this because you don't have to worry about violence in the cartoons. It's lots of comic misschiff and loads of fun to watch and laugh at.",1141603200,3,628,4.285714285714286
2423113,3,B000BKVRLU,"I think the super mario bros. super show is great but I was disappointed to see that 3/5 episodes were already released on mario's greatest movie moments. The 2 episodes on this dvd that have not yet been released are Star Koopa and James Blonde. If you don't have mario's greatest movie moments then I suggest you buy it, but I still think they should have made volume 2.",1135814400,4,372,4.405797101449275

2423118,5,B000BKVRLU,This was a gift for a 5 year olds birthday party..  The family went out of town for Spring Break and the mother told me that the movie was a great idea as it kept her boys entertained on the drive.

2423123,5,B000BKVRLU,The graphics are old.  The jokes are lame.  But that is MY opinion.  The opinion of my 3 & 5 year old boys is that it is hilarious and they want to watch it again and again.,1362441600,,173,3.6216216216216215

2423127,4,B000BKVRLU,"It's a magnificent DVD if you know what to excpect, but a fair warning, this is nothing special.
It's not a show you've never heard of; it's the classic ""Super Mario Bros. Super Show"". I don't exactly know WHY they didn't put the full title on it this time, but don't be fooled; it's the SMB super show once you see it.",1344643200,,319,4.161290322580645
2423128,5,B000BKVRLU,"Bought this for my son and daughter who really got into these older Mario cartoons.  They have enjoyed watching the same cartoons I grew up with, and to me these make more sense than the ones on cartoon network these days.",1341187200,,222,4.414634146341464
2423129,5,B000BKVRLU,Got this for my seven year old son.  He is everything Mario and loves this DVD just as much as the others.,1335052800,,106,3.8181818181818183
2423130,2,B000BKVRLU,"I found this in a bargain bin in some store and I had no idea what it was. When I purchased it, it turned out to be five episodes of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show. Why couldn't they just call it that. What sucks is that the live action part of the show is completely gone with just the cartoon shows left. The episode included are Star Koopa, Toad Warriors, Robo Koopa, On Her Majesty's Sewer Service, and Raiders of the Lost Mushroom. The show is pretty funny if extremely corny, but if you are a fan of the show I suggest searching for a boxed set instead of this.",1312848000,4,569,4.135135135135135
2423131,5,B000BKVRLU,"If your kids love Mario and Star Wars - then this is a must buy.  My kids love it.  They keep running around saying, ""May the PASTA be with you."".",1300233600,,146,3.8333333333333335
2423132,4,B000BKVRLU,"Most kids go through fazes of different things they like.  I bought this dvd and it seems he does not care for mario anymore, but once he gets a DS and plays mario bros, he might want to watch this dvd.",1274572800,,202,3.926829268292683
2423133,5,B000BKVRLU,"my 7 year old loves these dvds.  great buy for us, I personally think they could be made better (have more mario game graphics) but who am i to say anyway?",1271635200,,155,4.0

2423135,5,B000BKVRLU,"This was purchased as a gift for my 5 year old grandson.  I haven't watched the DVD, but I haven't heard of any problems with it.  Shipping was quick.  Everything went great.",1250208000,2,174,4.375

2423140,4,B000BKVRLU,I ordered this cartoon because I thought it was unusual looking and I didn't have it. But people....be warned!  Don't buy this if you already own the SUPER MARIO BROS.SUPER SHOW box sets on DVD! The 5 episodes on this DVD is from the SUPER SHOW cartoon! I didn't know that when I ordered it! I'll probably just give this to my niece now.,1193184000,37,337,4.265625
2423141,4,B000BKVRLU,"I want to see more of the New Super Mario Bros, or Super Mario World. i am not as addicted to the Mario Bros. as I am with The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I love the turtles. I grew up watching the original series. I will collect all the episodes regardless of how much money I do spend. Hey, it's worth spending money on something that really interests you. How do I feel about the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the movie ""TMNT""? Well, it is not as intense, entertaining, and emotional as the original one and the following three movies in which the turtles were real. They were not 3D animated like TMNT. The original is always better than something that duplicates it. Today's music and TV shows are crappy, senseless, and a waste of someone's time.",1190160000,,761,4.482014388489208
2423142,5,B000BKVRLU,"This video is a lot of fun.  It's really long, and it's definitely classic Super Mario Bros.  My kids ask for it over and over.
Also check out the Super Mario Bros King Koopa Katastrophe.  That's good too!  Highly recommend these DVDs!",1189728000,16,235,4.523809523809524
2423143,5,B000BKVRLU,This movie has a good and decent story for kids to watch.  It is entertaining and without inmoralities.  My son likes to watch it often and carries it everywhere.,1143244800,,162,4.551724137931035
