8121873,5,B000FFPKF0,This is the best DVD for children.  The child narrating pulls children right in.  We love watching it with our 6 and 10 year old grandchildren.  We were so impressed that I bought it for a couple of schools in our area.  This is a must in a classroom.,1379721600,,251,4.061224489795919
8121874,5,B000FFPKF0,"We saw this video at the Sea Life Center in Seward, Alaska & enjoyed it tremendously.  It was an excellent glimpse at animal life in that state.  Narrated by a young boy, all the wonder he had about these animals came through loud and clear.  I ended up ordering it for my niece's three children, as I thought they'd not only enjoy watching it, but learn a lot too!",1280361600,,365,4.260869565217392
8121875,5,B000FFPKF0,"I ""discovered"" Alaska's Coolest Animals the first year I lived in Alaska at a B&B I was staying at in Talkeetna.  There were 5 adults in our party and we enjoyed this dvd more than the others that we watched as we relaxed from our days of sightseeing.  My husband and I, as well as numerous guests that have visited us since we moved to the Great Land, have purchased this for our grandsons, Goddaughters, nieces and nephews over the years and all have been thrilled by the dvd and love the fact that the ""story teller"" is a child just as they are.  Younger children may not sit through the dvd in one sitting (what child does sit still for 45 minutes at a time?!) but it is broken up into managable sections and most children will have one section or another that they want to return to again and again-special favorites are the sea otters and bears.  I highly recommend this dvd as an introduction to the animals and beauty of Alaska.",1206144000,3,936,4.362068965517241
8121876,5,B000FFPKF0,"This 40 minutes video is narrated by a little boy from beautiful Homer Alaska.  He does a fantastic job and my children were attentive throughout, enjoying the childlike voice.  They discover 50 animals and the children truly learn about the animals and their environment.  It is written from an ecological perspective, but even skeptics like myself have learned that to a degree the more ecologically minded people have a point.  In this video, it is not overemphasized or rediculous in any way.  In fact, it makes very good wholesome statements that we all need to be aware of no matter how skeptical we are.  The cinematographer, Daniel Zatz has won many awards and two emmys for his work.  His work is so acknowledged and appreciated that it has been seen on National Geographic, CNN & CBS!  I saw this video while at Seward Alaska's Sea Life Center and bought it immediately.  We love it!  Sharon Bouman",1169510400,4,908,4.762820512820513
8121877,1,B000FFPKF0,"The best part of this pair of video programs is the cinematography. However, the fatal flaw soon becomes apparent. Imagine an entire DVD narrated by a 5 year hold with a lisp but speaking words an adult would say. At first it might sound cute to an adult; almost as if it would make a good video for children to watch. However a child listening over and over to mispronounced and slurred words might not be the best exposure to provide to help with language building.

Also note that the beginning of each section is preceeded by an advertizing segment for other products produced by the manufacturer. This advertizing segment cannot be ""chapter skipped"" with the DVD controller, so sit back and enjoy the commercial ""break"" as it has been baked-in to the presentation.

The biggest flaw is that it is pretty much filled with indoctrination. More like what a propoganda video would say -- aka., ""people are evil and are making Alaska too dirty for the cute 'aminals' to live"" and ""native americans are bad for subsistance hunting"". Whether you believe this is true to one degree or another is one thing, but to embed this within a video directed toward children is generally frowned upon as civilized society tries to protect children kind of sugar coated indoctrination whatever one's beliefs are.

Your children deserve better. Look elsewhere.",1156204800,6,1345,4.864628820960698
