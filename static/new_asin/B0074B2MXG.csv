5053917,4,B0074B2MXG,"No problems in the ordering process, DVD arrived within given time period.  Pleasant experience overall, would order again without hesitation.",1343692800,,142,6.1
5053918,3,B0074B2MXG,I love Ralphie but this comedy set was a bit preachy for my liking.  There were definitely some funny parts but half way through I was getting bored and the laughs were getting fewer and farther between.  Not Ralphie's best.,1339545600,3,224,4.575
5053919,5,B0074B2MXG,This DVD is so funny I have watched it with my family several times since receiving it.  We love Ralphie,1338681600,,104,4.2
5053920,1,B0074B2MXG,"First off let me say that I am a big Ralphie May fan. I LOVED Girth of a Nation as well as Austin-Tatious. They are funnier than 99.7% of other stand ups out there. This was the first DVD, movie, ANYTHING that I have ever pre-ordered. I was looking forward to it that much. Unfortunately, I am extremely disappointed. The jokes are decent (not great, but decent) on this DVD, but what gets me is how much time he spends giving essentially a political rights activist speech. Don't get me wrong, I agree with 100% of what he says, racism is childish, hurtful and we DO need to change it. Gay people deserve EVERY right that everyone else has, they are no different than anyone else. These are great messages, but I spent my money on stand up COMEDY show. Just be prepared that this DVD is about 35% comedy, and 65% activist. I did not disagree with anything he said, I just didn't laugh at much he said either. Save your money for Girth of a Nation or Austin-Tatious. It seems he's lost his desire to make people laugh at things they didn't want to laugh at because they weren't PC. I miss that Ralphie.",1336262400,3,1102,4.354368932038835
5053921,3,B0074B2MXG,"While other reviews mention the high points of this DVD (which I completely agree with), halfway through I noticed Ralphie tacking ""OK"" onto the ends of sentences, and then in the middle of sentences.  I've worked with a couple of people who do this and have developed this weird compulsion to focus on it once I notice it.  If this is the kind of thing you notice, be careful watching this disc!

Just to make sure I was hearing as many ""OK""s as I thought, I kept count on a 2nd viewing and ended up with 227 ""OK""s in 1:46.  I know this is picky, but it really is one of those things that distracts me when people are speaking (along with ""You know"" waaaay too many times per minute).

With that said, I still think this is a better stand-up routine than Ralphie's earlier discs.  He covers a broader range of subjects and is still funny as hell!  The last 10 minutes is worth the disc alone.",1335916800,2,893,4.279761904761905
5053922,5,B0074B2MXG,"His degree of pathos, humor and bathos is hard to understand. First the guy is a genius, but he's a man of the people, he's dirty and works ""blue"" but he is never hurtful to minorities or women.
May has a lot of fast trigger stuff, and he is very very ""Hip"" and I mean hat in the old school senses of the word, but what got me the most was when he almost had a nervous breakdown when his dad died. I knew about him long before Last Comic Standing. There are a lot of Fat comics out there but if you will notice May plays down the fat stuff and goes for the real social insights. Hope his health is OK.",1335484800,6,601,3.894308943089431
5053923,5,B0074B2MXG,"Ralphie May is truly one of these funniest comedians in America.  I recently saw this performance on Comedy Central.  Even with all the insessant bleeping that Comedy Central was forced to do,(I HATE you FCC), I still laughed my ass off.

Mr. May is of course over weight, and that is one of the foundations in his sets.  This particular special seemed to focus on sex a lot too.  I wish I could remember a particular joke to quote right now, but my mind is failing me...  Believe me when I say this though, THIS IS FUNNY.

I don't usually make it a habit to buy stand up on DVD, but when the price of this is right for me, I just may buy this.

Oh a joke just came to me.  He tells a hilarious joke about his little toddler son grabbing a woman in a elevator in her ""monkey"", aka her private parts.  My brother and I rolled for at least 5 minutes from this joke.

Also fun fact, he is married to a smokin hot female stand up comedian.  Look it up, I'm not kidding.  Good for you Ralphie.

Buy the DVD or stream it, you will not have a dry eye left after watching this, I promise, you'll laugh that hard.",1333411200,,1104,4.074418604651163
5053924,1,B0074B2MXG,This is not a review of his book didn't read it.  Saw him live recently..omg...not funny.  The same old tired jokes I've heard from multiple filthy comedians who have no real material except jokes about women .. which is fine.  but this guy takes it way too far.  An obvious misogonist and just pathetic.,1456876800,,304,4.574074074074074

5053933,1,B0074B2MXG,"(Feb 14, 2015) Went to see comedian Raphie May last night in Clearwater. Don't waste your money, this idiot was so stoned or on high on drugs & alcohol to the point that he rambled incoherently for the first 20 minutes, the audience was dead silent. He could not keep his eyes open or focused, he looked like he was going to fall over at any time. He sat on a stool with his eyes closed not saying a thing for minutes on end...... just frying on drugs. When he did try & put together sentences he had nothing funny to say. The show was absolute trash. Final joke was on us for paying $200 for 2 tickets.",1423958400,,603,4.11864406779661

Mr. May is as true of an american as the people that fought for America. Watch the show and I believe that you'll agree.",1410825600,,382,4.093333333333334

The problem is that he kept giving speeches into different subjects which killed the fun.",1409356800,,341,4.34375
5053953,3,B0074B2MXG,"Funny guy. 1/2 way he gets a little preachy (you're speaking to the choir sir) which throws his rhythm off course IMHO. Certainly not the funniest guy out there (who's giving this guy 5-stars... really? This is as funny as it gets!? Uh. Yeah, I don't think so.).

Funny if you want to hear another guy rail against the clear idiocy running through America's veins but he doesn't really differentiate himself from the standard comedy pack outside the fact that he's the only one 'making Jews.'",1409011200,,492,4.72093023255814

5053955,5,B0074B2MXG,Ralphie May can sometimes get a bit too vulgar for my preferences but this one had me laughing pretty much all the way through it. He touches on some hot-button issues in such a way that it totally disarms the anger & vitriol most of those topics usually bring up and he does it in a way that actually can help people come to grips with the issue. Everyone can find something funny in this video. I highly recommend it.,1408147200,,419,4.25

5054016,5,B0074B2MXG,"Weeks later, and I am still laughing when I think about his stories. I turn all my friends on to Raphie who have yet had the experience of Ralphie May. L-O-V-E H-I-M!!!!!",1364342400,,170,4.34375
5054017,4,B0074B2MXG,Good stand-up. Kept me laughing for the entire show.  Would recommend if you want to laugh. Minimum words on review is just stupid.,1361836800,,131,4.695652173913044
5054018,5,B0074B2MXG,I thought Ralphie May got  a lot more serious n this dvd but it was still a very funny and enlightening movie,1358294400,,109,3.9545454545454546
5054019,5,B0074B2MXG,"This is the best written and funniest stand up we have seen in a very long time,  we have shown it to all of our family and friends, and had to take 'laugh breaks ' in the middle just so our stomachs didn't hurt!  Highly recommended, he definately has his finger on what should be the pulse of america!",1357430400,,302,4.101694915254237
5054020,4,B0074B2MXG,"2011NR: Rock it Ralphie. ""White, black, and brown against a new kind of brown"". If you're easily offended, watch the big man anyway. We could all use a little offending in our perpetually apologetic, ""everyone is special"", oversensitive culture. One of the best (smartest) comedians I've see in the vein of Carlin & Rock.

You'll be rolling on the floor laughing your head off",1357084800,,106,3.9523809523809526
5054022,2,B0074B2MXG,"Ralphie is a funny man, and an intelligent speaker, but seems to have his priorities confused in this DVD.  People go to a stand-up show, or buy a comedy DVD to laugh, not get self help or a motivational speech.  The middle 50% of this DVD would have gone over GREAT at a college orientation.  It was honest, insightful, and all-round good advice.  It did not belong in a comedy routine though, and seriously killed the tempo of the show.  You could have heard a pin drop in my living room for a solid 30 minutes there.",1356998400,2,519,4.309278350515464
5054023,4,B0074B2MXG,Very funny at the begining and the end. However during the middleof the show I do not need a lesson on racial tolerance. I want to be entertained and laugh.,1355702400,,156,4.233333333333333

5054028,5,B0074B2MXG,"This special is so wrong, which makes it so hilarious! Ralphie May's comedy reminds me of George Carlin and Richard Pryor. I got this DVD for my dad a while back, and now I'm wanting it myself. I am a new fan of Ralphie May, but I feel like I've watched him for years. This big boy talks about everything, from big fat monkeys to freaking out at the coffee shop. Not recommended for children.",1352764800,,392,4.24
5054029,5,B0074B2MXG,"This is a lengthy performance (over an hour and three-quarters) of stand-up by comedian Ralphie May.  Ralphie is quite funny, but balances his humor with some meaningful points.  Overall it was one of the best shows I have seen, but be forewarned, Ralphie can get off-color and will use some questionable language.  Definitely recommended if you're a fan of stand-up.",1347408000,,367,5.083333333333333
