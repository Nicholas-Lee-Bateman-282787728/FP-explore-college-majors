7869982,3,6304411421,"Raquel is a go-go dancer in Vegas who runs for her life when a disgruntled husband of a co-worker blames HER for his bad marriage! Ingenious use of locations from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in a stark, engrossing thriller with nice support from the underrated James Stacy as a nice guy who gets involved. As for Welch: she's over-the-top in a movie that requires it. Sexy, smoky, occasionally hysterical. Get this one while it lasts(word has it that it's already fallen out of print).",978220800,18,482,4.682352941176471
