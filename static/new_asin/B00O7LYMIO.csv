6725303,4,B00O7LYMIO,"The film centers on new recruit Pvt. Gary Hooks (Jack O'Connell). It follows his training and then quickly the green recruit is sent to Belfast...why it's part of the same country. During a confrontation with the Catholic Irish, Hooks gets separated from his group where he is beaten and abandoned. He is reluctantly aided by some collaborators, while others hunt him like an animal. The film moves through questionable tactics and loyalties.

The movie was a decent drama thriller. It doesn't dwell much on the politics of the situation.

6725326,5,B00O7LYMIO,"Standing in a university lecture room in 1972-73, I listened quietly, as we all did while safe in an upscale Cleveland suburb, to Bernadette Devlin.  She as a visiting civil rights activist and member of Westminster Parliament for  Mid Ulster, was and is a ""true believer"" and unlike others did ""walk the talk"".

The film,'71 brought the above memory back to me. '71 is a thriller set in a grim urban world of sectarian violence. A young British soldier after completing his ""basic training"" is sent with his unit to Belfast Ireland. The unit leaves with a commander's assurance ""not to worry as you are not leaving the country"". A subsequent ""shot"" of  a grey Irish sea crossing and then scrawled warnings of ""you are not leaving this city"" ominously  juxtaposes the commanders comment.

 There is no ""gosh and begorrah"" here, from the side walk  bang bang bang of metal garbage can lids to warn of impending military patrols to a ""country western"" back ground tune playing in a dark ""orange"" pub, there is continued atmosphere punctured with sudden violence.

Our young British soldier finds himself alone after a street clash and with effort, and and some luck, seeks reuniting with his unit. Suffice to say this is a  thoughtful and worthy film. A riveting thriller as advertised.",1507420800,,1284,4.848623853211009

6725338,5,B00O7LYMIO,"A newly-minted British soldier (Jack O'Connell) is sent with the rest of his squad to Belfast to offer protection as the government canvasses an all-Catholic neighborhood.  Immediately, things go south as the residents meet the Brits with fierce resistance.  One child steals a gun and two soldiers give chase, placing them behind unfriendly lines.  A gang of hostile locals gun down one soldier and aim to do the same with the second.  And we're just getting started.  And soon, there is no safe place for the soldier - both Protestant fanatics and Catholic fanatics want him dead.  The acting here is second to none.  It comes quite quickly that the audience can only really trust the experiences of the soldier.  And O'Connell's portrayal...!  I had never seen or heard of him before this but I won't forget his performance in this film.  He doesn't say much but his physical reactions and movements are so exact and perfect that you'd have to be a clod not to appreciate O'Connell's precision.  It reminds me of early DeNiro.  The writing and direction are also so finely tuned.  It's a pleasure to see a film that is so lean and efficient.  It doesn't waste time building a moral narrative around this chaos.  It leaves the viewer to make up her own mind if she pleases.  This is definitely a film I'd recommend to anyone, most especially those interested in the ""Troubles"".",1494201600,,1379,4.755274261603375

6725418,4,B00O7LYMIO,"A thrilling, effective movie about a British soldier, Gary Hooks, who becomes separated from his platoon during a riot in Belfast in 1971 (at a tense time in the Troubles"") and has to try to find his way back to his barracks in a town that he hasn't been in long enough to have any understanding about how to get around in it.  So -- will he make it, and at what cost?  On that level, it is gripping, but there's more to it, for all the relative paucity of dialogue.  Just on a visual level, the sense of Gary's disorientation is vividly conveyed as he tries to find his way through narrow, smoky, dark streets -- the effect is a bit reminiscent of Victor McGlaglen as Gyppo, in John Ford's ""The Informer,"" trying to avoid capture by his erstwhile comrades.  Gyppo was driven by guilt; Gary is driven more by self-preservation than anything else, and one gets a clear sense of how the ""war"" in Belfast seems something much less tidy than anything we usually think of having that name.  The ""British"" side employs disguised operatives as well as regular soldiers, and there is tension between both branches.  On the IRA side, there is a split between the older and the more violence-prone younger generations, to a degree where even the ""sides"" in the conflict become murky.  Moments of empathy and care are there too -- but soon even those who care not only come under suspicion but find themselves conflicted by what would, in an ordinary situation, be their own admirable humane impulses.  And what of ""characterization"" in a movie like this?  The tragic thing is that when ideology takes center stage then it almost makes no sense to talk of character or moral agency.  This is the case on both sides of the conflict, and it's more tragic still to see that the regular soldiers are drawn willy-nilly into an ideological conflict, in a situation that they have no understanding of.

Gary is played with great conviction and sensitivity by Jack O'Connell, best known for ""Unbroken.""  The other actors aren't well known to me, but Sam Reid, Barry Keoghan, David Wilmot, Richard Dormer, and Killian Scott are all very good indeed.  Recommended -- but often not easy to watch.",1477180800,,2174,4.659685863874346

The film shows what a dirty and insidious war it was, hence the length of the troubles and the temporary cease-fires until Good Friday, 1998.  One thing of note, and I am very grateful for it, when the bomb explodes in the bar - that IS how a single bombing actually sounds.  That is what it sounds like, exactly.

6725443,3,B00O7LYMIO,"As we question the continuing terrorist acts between Islam and Christianity this film 71 pairs two other religious sectors  the Catholics and the Protestants in Ireland. Enough said. Religious schisms run the gamut and it is wise to take a look at what others are doing or have done along the same lines.

Gregory Burke wrote the screenplay for this noisy film directed by Yann Demange and nearly destroyed by the irrational wacky dark cinematography by Tat Radcliffe. The story is one night in Belfast in 1971. Gary Hook (Jack OConnell) is a Private, a young British soldier accidentally abandoned by his unit following a terrifying riot on the streets of Belfast in 1971. Unable to tell friend from foe, the raw recruit must survive the night alone and find his way to safety through a disorienting, alien and deadly landscape. Many people interact  the British leave when the crowd gets bellicose and the Irish hunt Gary Hook in a chase that results in more deaths than usual  Hook witnesses the deaths of two young lads reminding him of the close relationship he has with an orphan named Darren back home. The story is basically a deadly chase and hunt for Hook and the various characters who want him dead and those who want to tend to his wounds. Good and bad on both sides of the encounter  the usual situation for war.

Jack OConnell is developing into a fine actor  his most recent film was the superb film Money Monster. The rest of the cat is strong but be warned  turn on the subtitles because the accents and noise make the words incomprehensible. Grady Harp, September 16",1474156800,,1585,4.676258992805756

6725465,3,B00O7LYMIO,"Apart from much of it where the buildings and fixtures were from a later period (certainly not early 1970's) the film was quite well done. The UK was at that point at its low with the collapse of its markets and industries, social unrest and worst of all the legacy of the civil war in Ireland that led to the break up of the UK - or rather creation of the Irish Republic. This left divided loyalties in the N.Ireland with the then minority of Catholics who saw it as occupied part of the Republic - with the IRA remaining a presence cross border since the 1920's. The history takes a lot of reading to understand so facts were easily manipulated and polarized by the respective communities. It was a brutal, pointless dirty war, with many murders and assassinations, and cover ups of similar behavior in rogue elements of the security forces. The plot was ok, the film was a sort of reminder of the early 70's and the tragic legacy of the previous partition of Ireland that was on the tv in the UK daily during that period.. There were no winners as the film shows only victims - much of it due to lack of opportunities and poverty sending many down the path of hate and division.",1473724800,,1181,4.397260273972603

We toured the Falls Road and Shankill Road in West Belfast, with a guide, and saw the dividing lines and walls still there.  Most folks are relieved that the worst is over.  This movie had excellent acting, was gritty and tough - and underscored that divisions are not always clear cut.  Neither side came out looking good, yet that was the point - violence is not justified and good can and does emerge.

6725644,5,B00O7LYMIO,"I'm embarrassed to admit this (being part Irish) but I actually didn't know about the Troubles (the conflict between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) until about 10 years ago while reading about a Rory Gallagher album.  Apparently Rory -a wonderful guitarist (on a personal note one of my favorites!) did the unthinkable, and actually performed at the height of the Troubles in the mid 70's.  He supposedly made his way through dangerous areas and actually performed for an audience. Watching '71, if this movie is based on facts and isn't exaggerated in any way- what Rory did was REALLY impressive, even more so given how amazing his live music was.  He didn't let the conflict interfere with his guitar abilities.

I've been aware of Paul McCartney's ""Give Ireland Back to the Irish"", and even considered it a favorite as a kid, but I never understood the meaning behind it (or rather as a kid, never stopped to think there was a deeper meaning since at that age I believed Ireland was a land of happiness.

I guess what's puzzling is that my high school history classes never brought up this particular conflict.  Given that tens of millions of Americans are Irish, this seems like a bizarre omission.  Watching '71, understanding I'm part Irish and love the Irish culture (and as an American was brought up to believe the country was a land of green hills, clover and neverending happiness) you better believe I was sickened, shocked, and deeply disturbed that the Troubles were quite possibly as violent as we see in '71.

Let me just make sure I have this right because all the information I'm finding about the Troubles is quite overwhelming and often times confusing.  This war extended for four decades?  It's mostly referred to as a conflict but given the extreme nature of '71, calling this a war seems more appropriate.  The Troubles was mostly a political matter, but I'm not sure how religion/Catholics are involved.  The information is a little unclear/confusing to understand in that regard.  I'm guessing Northern Ireland were more strict in how they wanted civilians to live, but perhaps calling it communism is going too far.  A peace agreement was signed in 1998?  But occasionally conflicts still occur to this day but on a much lesser scale, and mostly police and religious groups are targeted when incidents do occur.

Let's talk about the movie.  A woman on the streets tries to keep peace between several young men beating on a helpless younger guy, only for one man to pull a gun and shoot the younger guy in the face (and it's graphic the way it's shown too).  It really felt like that poor woman standing between this chaos would be able to stop this particular incident from getting worse.  It really SEEMED for just a moment she was able to prevent the anger from escalating, so this scene in particular suddenly turning extremely tragic out of nowhere was really horrible.  You'll also see rocks being tossed and knocking people out, women being treated horribly and more.  British soldiers getting cussed out by little kids and attacked by urine balloons.  Not the Ireland I read about at all.

I guess before I go any further I should mention what the story's about.  It's about a British soldier (Jack O'Connell) who finds himself separated from the rest of the army, stuck inside the Belfast conflict and having to run away from angry rioters who are packing guns and knives and don't hesitate for even a second to attack violently (mostly young men and kids which makes it even sadder).  I know the Irish supposedly get angry easily, but this takes anger to a whole new level and crosses into barbaric.  The soldier often runs for his life through narrow streets.  The movie accurately shows the feeling of concern this poor soldier is going through as he hides, breathes heavy, and succumbs to totally exhaustion.  Magnificent acting all around.

Eventually the soldier meets up with a little boy who angrily and reluctantly guides him to safer areas.  This bond is short-lived however, because in the most shocking moment of the film (and this is a SPOILER) the little boy inside a tavern actually gets blown up when a bomb drops.  This scene will totally leave you speechless in both the timing and the cruelness of it, and the sadness afterwards.

The story in the second half is that certain Northern Irish men know about this British soldier being in the area, and through violent and threatening means they break into a family's home who were temporarily taking in the British soldier earlier and discussing how they're going to take him to the hospital without getting caught.  These men force the family to reveal where he's hiding or everyone in the house gets shot.  This is all too much to take in by this point.  Charlie Murphy even has a gun pointed at her, and that just feels especially wrong.  She's pretty!  Barry Keoghan's character is even encouraged by his mates to shoot the British soldier when the ripe opportunity to do so occurs.  This particular scene gets crazy but I won't spoil anything else.

It's just shocking to see Irish killing each other in such a way that shows a complete lack of compassion.  A hungry desire to kill without remorse.  I can only imagine how horrible it must have been to actually have experienced this conflict.  The information I'm reading now is that a tourist can visit Northern Ireland without any problems (except on July 12 when a marching celebration occurs and both people of Northern and Republic of Irish have to cross paths) but I'm not sure if regular Republic of Irish folks can be a part of this celebration and expect the same kind of courtesy.  I'm guessing they can pass through, but advised to keep a low profile.  Probably the most important thing to keep in mind if you visit Northern Ireland is NEVER bring up the history of this conflict considering it's still fairly recent.  I imagine that would result in anger and probably worse things (getting attacked or arrested).  Always don't wear clothes that might offend or have Republican license plates as you pass through.

As for '71, I feel uncomfortable giving the movie 5 stars, but the 5-star rating is based on how much it left an impression.  That British soldier sure was a lucky man.  To avoid... all that and live?  That's just crazy!  This is more like a war in my eyes.  At least the way '71 presents the Troubles is more war-like than a mere conflict, but then again if this stuff happened on a small scale and only in certain areas of the country, I guess the Troubles would be more like a conflict.  I don't really know.  All I know is that I want Ireland to be the way I've always envisioned it- happy and peaceful.  To find a negative, well it's not the fault of the Irish, but as an American the accents are really heavy a lot of the time so it's hard to understand most of what's being said.  Otherwise the dark and dreary night setting I imagine accurately captures the tension of this conflict.",1466121600,,6992,4.704769736842105

Hard for non-Irish to understand the accents in the dialogue, but the story is still fairly easy to follow.  It is one of those shows where they are speaking English, but those of us in the US still need subtitles.  Also, the camera work is too modern/chaotic and makes many scenes hard to watch.  5 stars for content, dialogue and story, 4 stars for cinematograpy and 3 stars for inability to understand them.

Everything was destroyed by the wretched, unwatchable photography.  I could think this was some sort of Blair Witch project, except that would have involved images we could identify.  In that case, perhaps I could have looked at the movie.  Here, there was a sincere intention to prevent us from identifying anything that was happening on the screen.

No seriously it's a great movie but it'll rip out your heart. It so brilliantly captures the depth of the madness concerning Northern Ireland during the ""troubles"", and speaks so brilliantly about the human condition (yes, I said it), the loss of innocence, and the nature of tribal hatred.

As the title suggests, the film takes place in 1971, in the UK but mostly in Belfast, Ireland.  During a riot a British soldier is accidentally left behind enemy lines, so to speak.  What follows is a harrowing and haunting cat-and-mouse hunt with the more fanatical ""Provisional"" IRA on his heels.  The themes of lost innocence and the corruption of both sides are powerful, brought to life by brilliant direction and superb acting by a wondrous cast, from the cynical leaders of both sides who will do anything to keep the ""war"" going, to the foul-mouthed children growing up with such bitter hatred for the ""enemy"".

6725880,5,B00O7LYMIO,"I must agree 100 % with those who gave this MUST SEE  Film a full FIVE STARS.

In every way all those who were involved in its Production, definitely hit the Ball right out of the Ball Park.

As just one example of how confused the situation was in Belfast during those bloody times I believe the man who tried to strangle Hook near the end, was some type of spy for the Brits, but simultaneously a double or even a triple ""agent"" working for both sides.

Hook, the Soldier Hero of the story,  early in the film, saw bomb makers working on a bomb through a half open door.  This group apparently was allegedly working with/for the Brits and clearly did not want the Brits to discover that they were also making bombs, just as the IRA opposition was doing.

It seems to me the man who attempted to strangle Hook had orders from his superiors to murder Hook before he could disclose when/if he made it back to his Barracks that one of the groups the Brits were working with, were also killing and maiming innocent civilians with bombs.

In short all sides were involved in a never ending War of Terror, just as we witness is taking place in the Middle East today and actually has been occurring in the Middle East for countless decades day in and day out everywhere one cares to focus his/her gaze.

In the case of this remarkably well Directed and Edited film, we see that the Brits had many Secret Agents in Belfast during the period of this story, disguised as civilians and it was a constant challenge throughout the movie to be totally sure which side a particular civilian was really on.  This confused situation added greatly to the incredible non-stop, always increasing, suspense factor  throughout this truly great Film from beginning to end.

Imagine what life was like for all the many civilian non-combatants who had to live under these Hellish day to day conditions, 24/7 for years and years.

Absolutely a FIVE STAR FILM from every perspective, including Directing, the Actors, Screenplay, choice of locales, and Music that added greatly to all the foregoing.

Every citizen of Belfast deserves the Victoria Cross for having had to live through and survive those terrible and often horrific times in Irish History, understatedly referred to as  ""The Troubles"" with a Capital ""T"".

6725950,2,B00O7LYMIO,"""Hey, let's make a movie of a British soldier who is stuck in a Catholic neighborhood in Belfast.""

The writers of this movie started with a simple, (and mildly interesting) concept, but had no idea where to take it.

Near the beginning of the movie, Gary Hook, a British soldier, is attempting to quell a riot in Belfast.  Confusion ensues and the rest of his unit retreats, leaving Hook behind and with several Catholics looking to kill him.

From there, it seems like the writers tried to think of any situation possible that might have happened to a British solider under similar circumstances.  You have loyalists befriending him, you have bombs going off, you have sympathetic Catholics trying to help him, you have Catholic militants decrying these Catholics as traitors, and, of course, you have him running through the streets trying to keep from getting killed.

In reality, the movie's entertainment value PLUMMETED after the first 15 or 20 minutes.  It was ridiculously difficult for Gary Hook to essentially walk back to an area where he would be safe.  I have a feeling that the writers really racked their brains trying to come up with something interesting to take place in Belfast after Hook got lost.

They weren't able to come up with anything meaningful to justify sitting through the rest of the movie.  Instead, all we got was an hour and a half of anything they could use to fill the time while Hook was lost in Belfast.

Most of the movie is watching different people and groups (Catholics and Protestants, radicals and moderates, and the British Army) argue about what to do about the ""Hook"" situation.",1460419200,2,1627,4.816546762589928

A British solder is left behind in a violent street altercation with a fellow soldier who is killed.  He runs, hides, is injured, and many people are killed throughout the night.  People who tried to help him after he was wounded in an explosion, also gone bad, have their lives threatened for helping the soldier and not knowing where he is.  As the film ends, the soldier is rescued.  When back in his home country totally disillusioned with what war entails,  it looks as he has gone AWOL taking his young son with him.

Typically British in terms of weapons - M911 style pistol fires about 16 rounds and never drops a mag.

6725975,2,B00O7LYMIO,"The discerning consumer will see this film for what it is: anti-war pap for the masses. Little in this film conforms to reality. Jack O'Connell plays Gary Hook a British soldier sent to Belfast to help quell unrest. Almost from the beginning O'Connell as Hook is filmed starring off into space as if he is questioning the wider world around him. As a person, he has more questions than answers. This may be appropriate in philosophers but will get you killed if your a solider or police officer. When he arrives in Belfast someone asks him if he, Hook, is Protestant or Catholic. Hook doesn't respond by saying, ""Neither"" or ""I'm an agnostic"", he responds, ""I don't know"". One suspects if one were to ask him if he is gay or straight, he would respond with a resounding, ""I don't know"". So, in this film, wishy-washy Hook is pitched into a boiling cauldron of seething hate and violence, peopled by warring factions who know exactly who they are, who they hate, and what they hope to achieve. I prefer my fellow man to know who he is and be decisive, even if it means he wants to kill me, rather than that my fellow man be a quivering ball of doubt and uncertainties.

The import of this film is the filmmaker wants the viewer to see how supposedly senseless violence is, and, Why can't we all just get along? World Peace, and all that drivel. Of course, we can be pretty confident, that in his private life, if the filmmaker's neighbor allowed his dog to stray onto the filmmaker's yard to poop,  the filmmaker would be out with a shotgun threatening to kill the dog and the owner.

And guess what? If you definitely hate this review of mine, you're more of a man, or more of a woman, than Jack O'Connell's character in this film - he who would read this review and ""not know"" whether he liked it or not.",1457222400,5,1805,4.430722891566265

6725978,2,B00O7LYMIO,"Set in 1971, a year before the infamous Bloody Sunday tragedy, '71 tells the story of a young British soldier Gary Hook (Jack O'Connell) sent to Northern Ireland on active service, who becomes involved in an exercise designed to protect the Royal Ulster Constabulary as they raid a Catholic house, much to the local residents' anger. Hook gets separated from his fellow-soldiers and eventually gets lost in the back streets of Belfast. He is eventually rescued, but in the process discovers the seamy truth about daily life during the Irish Troubles.

Filmed in and around the streets of Yorkshire, Yanin Demange's film has a newsy feel to it; this is chiefly due to the use of a hand-held camera that photographs the action in jerky style, with fast cutting and an emphasis on incident rather than characterization. This approach works well on one level, as it emphasizes the atmosphere of perpetual danger prevailing in Belfast at that time, where no one - not least the citizens themselves - knew who their friends were. Loyalties perpetually shifted, despite the religious divisions and the prevailing antipathy towards the British soldiers, who were often regarded (especially by the Catholic population) as representatives of the colonizing power.

On the other hand, the film has little real sense of socio- historical context. The action plays out like a gangster thriller, with several sequences of physical violence interspersed with (the mostly male) cast swearing at any and every opportunity. We never really discover why people actually behaved as they did during the early Seventies; why the troops were brought in; and whether the troops' presence at that time differed from other periods in Irish history (for example, in the action leading up to and following the 1916 Rebellion). It seems that Demange has sacrificed analysis in favor of action and incident.

As a result, we are left with a film that despite its title seems curiously ahistorical. Its subject-matter could refer to any internecine conflict past and present; while the characters' reactions tend towards the predictable. '71 represents a missed opportunity; viewers wanting to find out more about Irish history might be better advised to watch ODD MAN OUT (1946) or THE CRYING GAME (1992).",1456358400,,2275,5.159891598915989

The movie is good.  I was in Northern Ireland a few years ago.  It's changed, obviously, but the history is worth remembering.

This reminds me.  I read a book, an historical fiction piece on an IRA member that went Super Grass, because he was treated well by a young English solider.  Different story, of course, but same genre and subject matter....  Thing is I can't remember the book.

This means the young soldier has to survive the night alone, disoriented in the streets of Belfast, while not knowing whom to trust. 71 is a tense action thriller with a focus on realism as well as the political aspects of the Troubles.

The film begins with a fast pace, with some frenzy, semi-documentary action sequence in the first half that may remind us of the style of Paul Greengrass, but it is in the films slower-paced second half that the first-time feature director Yann Demange shows what he is really capable of, with a suspenseful building up to the conclusion.

6726099,5,B00O7LYMIO,"71 revolves around the story of Gary Hook, a British soldier, left behind in a hostile part of Belfast, a city he didn't want to come to, where he is not a member of either catholic or protestant sides, but was just doing his job as one of a squad of soldiers standing guard outside a council flat in the catholic area of Belfast, as it was being raided for suspected weapons.  Unfortunately for the soldier it's his first day in Belfast, so he's unprepared for the hostility and hatred of the local suburb towards him simply for being a soldier.  When he and another soldier chase after a boy who stole an automatic weapon, ridiculously his unit is told to get back on their trucks and leave. Especially when you consider the whole point of their mission was to remove weapons from the conflict zone. After a cowardly brutal beating on the two soldiers by angry men, as the soldiers obviously aren't allowed to protect themselves with their weapons, the other soldier is murdered, shot in the head by a teen.  In shock the British soldier now without his own weapon flees on foot through the unfamiliar streets with the teen in pursuit shooting at him.  The soldier manages to evade instant death, but is now wounded and lost.  Will he be able to make it back to safety, when he doesn't know how to get there and who he can trust not to try and kill him?

Although 71 is set in Northern Ireland during the early 70s, You can easily imagine it happening in any conflict zone in any war where allied soldiers are sent to keep the peace in unfamiliar cultures and streets, where if they get ambushed and are the sole survivor or a pilot who gets shot down, or whatever the case is, you can imagine what they must go through in order to reach somewhere safe and get the medical help they need. So you can easily relate what Gary Hook is going though to our modern day soldiers serving overseas.",1443830400,,1891,4.419540229885057

6726101,5,B00O7LYMIO,"Never have the troubles that plagued Northern Ireland been portrayed as succinctly as shown in ""71"".  The hostilities between the Catholic and Protestant population isn't as cut and dry as would be assumed more akin to the quagmire that was Southeast Asia that ran concurrent with the events portrayed in this film.  There are divisions within the Catholic militants likewise with their Protestant counterparts.  Throw into the mix loyalists, collaborators, and British undercover operatives you would be hard pressed to discern friend from foe.  The film focuses on young Gary Hook(Jack O'Connell), a British conscript sent to Belfast to police the unrest.  Separated from his platoon during a skirmish with Catholic locals Hook has to navigate the hostile landscape of the strife torn city to get back to the safety of his barracks.  His fear and anxiety is palpable and his every step is a potential landmine.  Director Yann Demange helms this tautly intense film with an assured hand allowing the audience to view events through the frightened eyes of Hook.  The success of the film is that it offers a fresh perspective on events in recent history that can't be explained in black-and-white terms.",1443744000,19,1202,5.128205128205129

6726150,4,B00O7LYMIO,"I give this movie 3.5 stars, but amazon only lets you vote in whole stars. I'll err to the side of 4 stars as opposed to 3.

""'71"" is the story of a British soldier who goes on a mission with his unit into Dublin, Northern Ireland to arrest an IRA sympathizer. Pro-Catholic, Irish sympathizers start to protest and then riot and become violent towards the British soldiers and the situation becomes confused. One British soldier is killed and his rifle is stolen by a little kid. Our hero chases after the kid, but then gets beat up, left behind, and stuck behind enemy lines for the night. This is the story of his survival in enemy waters, and the British army's attempt to get him back.

I think this movie is sort of the essence of a solidly done movie. There is really nothing to complain about here, and the plot is very muscular, and moves in a very dynamic, logical way. The action flows very strongly and swiftly. One piece of action flows the way it should into the next, and the whole thing comes off as very sophisticated and intelligent. It also highlights the plight in Northern Ireland very well.

Oddly, the main character doesn't talk very much, and much of the action centers around his compatriots' attempts to get him back and of his enemies attempts to hunt him down. There are two factions of enemies in the IRA: the older, more political and diplomatic ones that just want to capture him, and the younger ones that want to kill him. This movie is also very sophisticated at blending in the spying aspect of the whole conflict, and I thought that was a great turn.

The only thing that knocks this down to 3.5 stars from 5 is the fact that it really is just an action movie, and it doesn't have the biggest human element to it. You don't really get to know the characters and what they are like and why they do what they do. The movie is ever so slightly shallow, but don't let that stop you from watching it: it does its job as an action movie really well. I do recommend this movie, although if you're an American, you might want to watch it with the subtitles, the Irish accents are extremely thick in places.",1441238400,,2134,4.39493670886076

I would have preferred a preamble at the start of the film to give the bigger picture, to give context. Without that, it sort of bordered on just another hunt and run sort of film set in Northern Ireland. Yes, the idea of the tension came through - but as I said, it could have been any action film with a bunch of thugs in it to give the tension. There was a little twist - but not dramatic enough. The MC was great though, and he pretty much carried the film.

There have been several good films about The Troubles in Northern Ireland over the last few years (Shadow Dancer for example) but none have quite captured the ""murkiness"" of the conflict and the potential for brutality among all of those involved quite like '71.

The young protestant boy (Corey McKinley) and the bar scenes are definite standouts, but the movie has many great scenes.

'71 takes on the very, very difficult task of portraying the Troubles in Northern Ireland--and hits a home run, painting an unsparing portrait of the violence in a manner that leaves no doubt of both sides' capacity for brutality. From Jack O'Connell's portrayal of Pvt. Hook to the supporting cast of soldiers, PIRA gunmen, Ulstermen, and Irish families caught in the middle of the strife--the acting was extremely good.

A particular stand-out was young Corey McKinley, playing brilliantly the part of a Loyalist child old far beyond his years.

Another thing I would like to applaud is the directors attention to detail. Hairstyles, clothing, vehicles, uniforms, weapons and many other items were accurate for the time period.

6726422,4,B00O7LYMIO,"I have to think that actor Jack O' Connell is hoping for a romantic comedy for his next outing.  After his harrowing portrayal of Olympian and war hero, Louis Zamperini in ""Unbroken,"" he takes the role of Gary Hook a young British soldier dispatched to maintain peace in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1971.  Yann Demange, gets his first assignment directing a feature and pulls off one of the best films of the year.

Demange and his screenwriter, Gregory Burke, assume the viewer has some basic knowledge of the tension between the Catholics and their violent IRA organization and the equally violent Protestants who were for the most part supported by the British.  In some areas of the city, clear divisions are found but in an area called Falls Road, the two sides are right next to each other.  Looking for IRA terrorists, the local police conduct door to door searches, supported by Hook's unit led by Lt. Armitage (Sam Reid) who is certainly in over his head.  Violence ensues and Hook and a fellow soldier are separated.

In a shocking scene out of nowhere, both soldiers are brutally beaten.  Hook manages to escape, but the other soldier isn't so fortunate.  The rest of the film has Hook attempting to get back to his unit.  It was about this time that I turned on English subtitles.  The various English accents were frankly indecipherable to this American bloke.  What Demange manages to do is not take sides.  We see brutality from both parties as well as traitorous acts between the sides as well.  Captain Sandy (Sean Harris) is a soldier working undercover, but for who.  O'Connell is terrific as the frightened young recruit, who finds solace at times with the other side willing to help as others are trying to kill him.

The film is authentically brutal and technically well done.  I was squirming in my seat seeing Hook's wounds sewn up without anesthesia.  Ouch.  The film hasn't been released in the U. S. on Blu ray, so I watched a DVD version which looked surprisingly good.  The movie also features a stunning soundtrack with music by David Holmes.  Highly recommended.",1436572800,4,2094,4.777158774373259

If you weren't alive during the 70's, you would have no idea what is going on with the IRA and the English troops.  Or even that this is what the movie is about.

It is a gritty, realistic british movie. No exepnsive special effects or stunts, just true to life brutality as seen in 70's northern ireland.

British soldier Gary Hook (Jack OConnell) is separated from his unit during a Belfast riot. Unarmed and injured in hostile territory, hes got to survive the night  but who can he trust?

What did I think?

Director Yann Demanges depiction of Northern Ireland at the height of the ""Troubles"" is bleak, ugly and very, very well done. Theres certainly plenty of action, but its thoughtful and unglamorous. There are no goodies or baddies  just people trying to make sense of a sad and terrible mess. You won't exactly have fun watching this, but youll be glad you saw it.",1432166400,38,585,4.696078431372549
6726458,5,B00O7LYMIO,"71 had my heart racing. It doesnt stop. It doesnt need to stop. The audience is thrown into a story with grit, one told in an uncompromising fashion. We don't need any backstory. We don't need any sort of setup. All we need is now. That now is war. Hellish war to be precise. But, it isn't exactly your typical setting.

What were seeing is the very beginning of what came to be called The Troubles. This is referring to a violent thirty-year conflict in Northern Ireland that mainly concerned the constitutional status of the country. However, if I may be blunt, the specifics don't really matter. This isn't a film that deals with a huge scope. Our story is right in front of us and is all the viewer needs: one soldier (that being Jack OConnell of Unbroken fame). After a terrifying riot on the crowded streets of Belfast, this one soldier is accidentally abandoned by his unit and left to survive the night alone in a bewildering new landscape. He has people after him, doesnt know who he can trust, and is as scared as can be.

Its certainly one of the most intense films Ive seen all year and doesnt let up. But, as I said earlier, it doesnt need to. The audience is already emotionally attached from the first few scenes and continues to root for him as his safety is questioned. Yann Demange, a director thats fairly new to the field, shows a natural knack for filmmaking and brilliantly brings this story to life alongside actor Jack OConnell. Who, if you hadnt already made notice of, should definitely do so now. His sensational performance floored me and ultimately drives the whole film. Theyre a phenomenal team and are both ones to watch. Seek this film out, you won't be sorry.",1431475200,27,1693,4.547540983606558
6726459,5,B00O7LYMIO,"Set in Belfast in 1971 and hence the inspiration for the title we meet some British soldiers on their way to deployment in Ulster. Jack O'Connell plays Gary Hook a young Private who has left his son behind in Council care. They are met by their new Commanding Officer Lt. Armitage who confesses he is new to the area too and really does not have a clue about how the situation on the streets has deteriorated.

They are sent out to back up the RUC in a house raid. Once there the women get out their bin lids in the traditional call to the neighbours and soon an angry crowd appear. Tensions escalate at a fierce rate and a riot ensues. During the ruckus Gary and his friend get separated and tragically the Commander decides to withdraw leaving him behind. He then has to try to survive in an alien town where he can't tell friend from enemy and he is wearing a British uniform that singles him out like a target on his back and he has to try to get back to safety.

This is a tense, gritty and very authentic film. O'Connell does an excellent job running the full range of emotions, but all of the supporting cast are excellent too especially Charlie Murphy playing Brigid. The attention to period detail is spot on and the actual reality on the streets is really well observed, I mention the bin lids above and they outline the differing sides in the conflict at the start which is great for context. The locations were realistic and were actually filmed in Blackburn, Lancashire. This is a visceral and brutal film but it has a heart too and is a highly recommended watch.",1430611200,15,1576,4.412371134020619
6726460,5,B00O7LYMIO,"I think 71' is worth more than 4 stars.  Here we have an English drama based on actual events in the bloody history of Northern Ireland, specifically Belfast.  The film is about a young and inexperienced British soldier Gary, who together with a small military unit is shipped to Belfast during the times known in history as The Troubles (1968-1998), when the Catholic IRA was fighting with the Irish loyalist Protestants.  During his first day in Belfast his unit is ordered to handle a riot, while the police search homes of potential IRA fighters.  Once in the Catholic district of Belfast the British soldiers are attacked by an angry crowd of Irish Catholics...men, women, children, you name it.  The situation gets out of hand quickly, and one of the solders gets shot in the head (point blank) by an IRA fighter disguised in civilian clothing.  The soldiers and police already in panic retreat to their trucks and leave the rioters (together with Gary who is ambushed by a crowd) behind.  Somehow Gary manages to free himself from the attackers and starts running for his life...the chase begins and soon Gary will experience what it really means to be alone behind enemy lines...",1429660800,3,1187,4.846534653465347

A riot erupts and a young boy grabs a soldiers rifle and Gary and a fellow chase the boy to recover the rifle and find themselves in a strange neighborhood, surrounded and beaten by a crowd.  Two IRA members show up and shoot the other soldier in the head and then pursue him, shooting at him and chasing him all over the neighborhoods.  Gary finds himself lost, not knowing who is friend or foe, all sides trying to find him including the British undercover cops and all trying to kill him as he struggles to survive the night.  Wounded by a bomb explosion, all think he needs to be done in for what they think he might have seen or know.  A brutal night for a innocent young soldier trying to just survive.

6726462,4,B00O7LYMIO,"""71"" (2014 release from the UK; 100 min.) brings the story of Gary Hook, a British soldier. As the movie opens, we see Gary training with the rest of his platoon. It isn't long before they are informed that they are being sent to deal with ""a deteriorating situation in Belfast"". Before shipping out, Gary spends some quality time with his son. Upon arriving in Belfast, it isn't long before the platoon is sent out in the streets of Belfast. Due to a blunder by the platoon's lieutenant, soon they find themselves in the midst of a street riot, and they retread. In all of the confusion, Hook is left behind and he runs for his life, being chased by several Catholics bent on killing him. At this point we are 15-20 min. into the movie. Will Hook make it out alive? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this is the feature debut from French director Yann Demange, and what a remarkable debut it is. ""71"" is both a top notch political movie and action thriller. How many movies can make that claim? The tension that builds up in the street riots is incredible, and remain palpable later on. Once Hook escapes the first immediate danger, he catches his breath, and only then realizes the horrible position that he finds himself in, and every choice he makes from here on out can be the wrong one, causing death. As to the political side, things are not clearly black and white, and in fact the comment is made several times in the movie that ""the situation is confused"" and we can't always tell who the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys are. I suspect that this is an accurate reflection of how things were like back then in Northern Ireland. The cast is, for me anyway, a cast of unknowns. Jack O'Connell as Hook brings an incredible performance. Last but not least, there is an outstanding score for this movie, courtesy of David Holmes (himself from Northern Ireland, and best known for his scores from the Ocean's 11-12-13 series).

The movie opened finally opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay. Even though I had high expectations going in, they were met, and then some. In fact, the only negative point I will mention is that at times I had trouble understanding all the lines, due to the (fake or real, I'm not sure) Northern Irish accents. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a top notch quality political and action drama, you cannot go wrong with this. ""71"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1428451200,63,2620,4.5369978858350954
