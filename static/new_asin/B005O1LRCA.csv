4850915,5,B005O1LRCA,"This is a French Canadian film from director Ken Scott who also wrote this avec Martin Petit. It is about David Wozniak, who is one of life's well meaning people who always seem to make things go wrong. He works in the family butchers business where he is the delivery driver, but also forgets to do that sometimes too. He also plays part time `soccer' - badly and then gets told by his long suffering girlfriend, Valerie (Julie LeBreton) that she is pregnant. He decides to clean up his act, pay off his considerable debts (which he is keeping quiet and trying to pay off by growing pot, all of the plants don't seem to want to live though).

Then he gets approached by a lawyer who says he is representing a group action of 142 young adults who are all the result of artificial insemination from a particular clinic, where he made a vast number of `deposits', it turns out he had the best `material' and has fathered 533. He is shocked at first but then curiosity gets the better of him and he decides to see what his `kids' are really like and if he should reveal his identity.

This is a funny, sweet, warm and sometimes moving piece of cinema; I was reaching for the hankies on a couple of occasions. He had made the `deposits' under the fake name of Starbuck, hence the title and is played by Patrick Huard who also made `Funky Town' which is another little gem. All of the cast are excellent and so much is crammed in here that you really are getting great value in a great feel good film. It is nigh on all in French, lots of English in the soundtrack which includes `Tuung' and the brilliant `The National'. The sub titles are all good too, the framing of the shots is adequate nothing award winning but still it has a wonderful feel to the whole thing and I really loved it, Ken Scott's next one is `Delivery Man' if it is half as good as this it will be worth the wait.",1367107200,3,1880,4.292957746478873
4850916,4,B005O1LRCA,"It's ""Starbuck"" not ""Starbucks."" The Canadian comedy's title refers to a real-life Holstein bull (1979-98), under which pseudonym David Wozniak (played by excellent Patrick Huard), a 42-year-old meat delivery man, donated his sperm when he was young. Now after many years David discovers something astonishing; he has fathered more than 500 children, and 142 of them have filed a lawsuit demanding the right to know who their biological father is.

Out of curiosity David takes a look at the names and photos of plaintiffs of the class-action lawsuit. To his surprise, one of them happens to be a famous professional soccer player! David naturally gets interested in other ""children"" he has never seen before, and gets more involved with their lives, while hiding his identity to them.

The film's driving force is Patrick Huard as a slacker who cannot do anything right until he starts to change after meeting his children. His portrayal of David is not only likeable and funny, but credible. Antoine Bertrand is also a standout as his well-meant friend and lawyer trying to help him out.

The film's conclusion is predictable and too sweet to my taste, and I think the subplot about David's girlfriend Valrie (Julie LeBreton) is not really necessary, but ""Starbuck"" is an amusing comedy with strong performances from the cast.

The film will be remade in Hollywood as ""The Delivery Man"" starring Vince Vaughn and directed by Ken Scott himself.",1363132800,,1445,5.0588235294117645
4850917,5,B005O1LRCA,Starbuck is an amazingly fun film with many twists and turns. It also has a very endearing side to this man's personality which shows up again and again. It was one of the favorites at the Port Townsend film festival this past September.,1357689600,,237,4.534883720930233
4850918,5,B005O1LRCA,"This Canadian entry to the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival (this review was first posted May 7th, 2012) is a ""crowd-pleaser,"" which is snide film-critic speak for ""No betrayals, no angst, no slaughters, no misery,"" nothing that warms the cockles of the hearts of the artistes; just a laugh-filled time spent with a witty guy who just happened to make 533 deposits in a sperm bank (for money) 20 years ago. (Wait until you figure out the reason he wanted the money!) Through a clerical error, the clinic used only his deposits for a year. (At the clinic, he went by the name ""Starbuck"" for anonymity.)

Now middle-aged and completely oblivious to the clinic's old error, our hero is an over-grown adolescent, living with a lovely young policewoman who just found out she's pregnant. He drives a delivery truck for his father's butcher shop and mostly ignores all of his parking tickets and any temptation to grow up. Her news is NOT welcome.

Out of the blue, 142 of his offspring file a class-action lawsuit to meet their biological father. They include: a manicurist, a soccer player, a bartender, an actor, a drug addict, a busker, etc., etc., etc. They are male and female, gay and straight. One is institutionalized because he has cerebral palsy. Of course the press has a field day trying to uncover the mysterious ""Starbuck.""

We have:
  * Patrick Huard (""Funkytown"") is Starbuck, our lusty hero, who quietly starts tracking down some of his children and is surprised by what he finds.
  * Antoine Bertrand (""The Necessities of Life"") is his best friend, who is (almost) a lawyer and volunteers to defend him in court to keep his identity a secret.
  * Julie LeBreton (""The Good Life"") is that lovely pregnant policewoman, tired of being the only adult in the relationship.

We meet our hero's father and brothers, then we meet some of his other family, as curiosity gets the better of him and he anonymously gets acquainted with some of these young adults.

There are no betrayals, no gunshots, no car chases, no sweaty bodies and no blowie uppie stuff. What we have here folks, is wit, humanity, warmth, loyalty and love. In other words, Entertainment. (And English subtitles!) I share my DVD from Amazon with friends on a regular basis.",1350172800,20,2254,4.813471502590674

4850920,5,B005O1LRCA,One of my favorite foreign films from 2011 (I think it was released in the US in 2012 or 2013). This movie was so good that it was remade in English with Vince Vaughn BUT THIS VERSION IS BETTER!,1426204800,,194,4.0
4850921,4,B005O1LRCA,"You know those movies where there is no likeable character? Where even the hero is a jerk at best.  Well, this is one of those movies where everyone is likeable.  That includes David Wozniak (Patrick Huard) who survived when he was in his 20's by making regular sperm deposits at a Montreal bank.  Some 16 or 17 years later he's a schlub working as a driver for his father's butcher shop.  He can't get his act together.  His girlfriend, Valerie (Julie LeBreton), has broken up with him, but discovers she's pregnant.  He owes loan sharks $80 thousand and they are after him.

If things couldn't get worse, an attorney working for the sperm bank tells him that he is being sued by 142 of his 533 offspring.  They want to know the identity of their biological father who is only known by his donor name, ""Starbuck."" David's best friend and lawyer (with lapsed credentials), Paul (Antoine Bertrand) talks David into refusing to come forward but to countersue and ask for damages from the sperm bank.

While waiting for trial, David becomes curious as to whom some of these teens are and how they turned out.  So he begins to stalk them one-by-one, often finding himself helping them out of difficult situations (an overdose, a missed appointment, etc.)  Written by Ken Scott, who also directed, and Martin Petit the film is a feel good event that for the most part stays away from becoming too mushy.  Huard in particular has to sell the somewhat absurd premise and he does.  The film goes where you would expect, but it is a warm, cushy journey.  Scott remade the film a year later in a glossy Hollywood version called ""Delivery Man"" staring Vince Vaughn.  This original is a better film.  Recommended.",1420416000,,1701,4.6767676767676765
4850922,5,B005O1LRCA,"My husband and I love this movie so much!  Fortunately we won tickets to see this movie for free (I never would have bought tickets because it was subtitled).  From the very beginning, my husband and I were laughing so much.  So very funny, with some naughty humor, and just a great story.  I was disappointed they re-made this movie with the puke Vince Vaughn, (I just hate his movies other than DodgeBall) called Delivery Man.  I tried to look past the puke and watched it, and it was a terrible remake. he's just not a good actor.  This movie did not need to get re-made because it was so perfect.  It just needed more publicity.  I normally only buy movies when they are less than $5, but this was so great we paid the higher price.

As the bumbling, black sheep of the family, David Wozniak, a hapless Butcher Shop deliveryman discovers that he has inadvertently fathered hundreds of children through a sperm bank when he was younger. Years pass and when these children get older they collectively file a Class Action Lawsuit to find out who their father is which sets off a series of events that are funny, heartwarming and ultimately life changing for all involved.

4850929,4,B005O1LRCA,"A different kind of movie. If you like foreign films, this one is definitely worth a look. This one was filmed in Canada with a French soundtrack, with English subtitles. This is a story about a frequent sperm doner, that finds out that his sperm, without his knowledge, was used to father 142 children over many years. Definitely a situation comedy. My wife and I found this film highly entertaining, though this is definitely for mature audiences because of the subject matter.

There are about a million ways they could have showed Starbuck donating to a sperm bank without being so graphic.  We were watching it with our 20 year old son and all of us were embarrassed.  However, with that said, we all agreed that the movie was terrific in spite of its opening scene.

4850960,5,B005O1LRCA,"What a very sweet surprise this movie was. We knew nothing of Starbuck going in, and it started well and then did what so few films ever do: it just kept getting better right up until the completely satisfying denouement.

The concept is unique (and hilarious), the plot brilliant, the script tight and perfectly paced, the direction pretty much flawless, but what makes this movie a true classic is the splendid and almost unnaturally natural performance of Patrick Huard. You don't ever see him as an actor; he's just this guy going through all this stuff. Huard is so thoroughly invested in the role that he doesn't even exist---there is only his character David. While some great actors always carry their starpower and personal presence with them no matter the role and how well they play it (Pacino, DeNiro, Walken, etc), Huard pulls off the rare and fabulous feat of being only and transparently his character at every single moment of the film.

Which is a good thing, as he's in every single moment of this film! At least 95%, anyhow. And you grow to love him more and more, and everyone else as well: there's not a bad moment or performance in this film. And that spells a great director (Ken Scott). Starbuck is one of the warmest and flat out nicest movies I've ever seen, and I thought at many moments how fine it was that this had zero Hollywood feel to it, no excess cheeze or melodrama, just a playful, tender sense that pervades every scene, with a subtle, very musical soundtrack.

I'm also so glad they didn't dub it. The French dialogue has such a nice melody and rhythm to it that no dub could ever capture, and dubbing tends to kill the subtle vocal touches that make a great performance great. The subtitles are also very accurate in tone and feel. Thanks are due to Scott for NOT dubbing this. It's interesting how he keeps most references to Quebec and Montreal almost invisible until the end, but, despite clearly going for more multinational appeal via the American t-shirts, Spanish soccer flags etc, Scott still didn't dub this in English. Idiosyncratic but also very wise, just like this film.

The dvd has an excellent transfer, and Scott's fine framing and compositions (plus some excellent natural lighting) get the respect they deserve. There are also extras, including interviews with Scott and Huard, nine minutes of deleted scenes (one of which is as good as anything in the film), a music video, and an unusual blooper/homage short. Scott mentions that he's remaking this for Dreamworks with Vince Vaughan, and I had to groan, for all the things that are so good here are in real jeopardy with a big budget and Hollyweird weasels using focus groups to see what ""plays for the mall crowd"". But perhaps Scott can make it work again, though VV has never displayed anything close to the depth and range and subtlety that Huard brings to every scene here. Fingers crossed: let's see what Vince has really got. Odds are he plays it broad for easy laughs, which Huard deftly avoids at every turn. This film rewards repeated viewing; I watched it again the same night and found lots of nice bits I'd missed the first time around.

Starbuck could easily play up the inherent slapstick that its clever central plot mover presents at every turn, but instead it goes for the heart and the less obvious questions and moments, which is why it works so very well. And while Huard's is no bravura over the top Oscar-aimed performance, it's easily as good as any best actor role I've seen in years. Watch out for this guy; he's a master.

Maybe when they remake this the original will get the world-wide acclaim it truly deserves. I sure hope so, as everybody who's ever had a child or been somebody else's child (I guess that's all of us!) will find things to love in Starbuck.

I can't recommend this film highly enough, and to pretty much anyone. It's almost everything you could want in a movie. Except, come to think of it, violence. There's not one gun or act of real violence in the whole film. And that's worth a sixth star, if it was available.

See this movie!!",1374883200,,4092,4.642265193370166
4850961,4,B005O1LRCA,"""Starbuck"" is a comedy about 42-year-old David Wozniak (Patrick Huard), lovable but perpetual screw-up, who finally decides to take control of his life when he learns some incredible news. Having been a habitual sperm donor in his youth, he discovers that he's the biological father of 533 children, 142 of whom are trying to force the fertility clinic to reveal the true identity of the prolific donor, code-named Starbuck.

As he sets out to discover the identity of his offspring, he discovers some surprising aspects of himself. Huard is both goofy and genial as the baffled father and balances comedy, pathos, and sentimentality as adeptly as a tight-rope walker. The film is definitely manipulative but fascinating, and Huard is engaging.

Bonus extras on this DVD release include interviews with Huard and director Ken Scott, deleted scenes, bloopers, and music video.",1374883200,,875,5.242857142857143
4850962,5,B005O1LRCA,I haven't felt this good after watching a movie in a long time. This movie elevates you and makes you want to be a better person. It makes you think through feeling.,1374883200,3,165,4.1875
4850963,4,B005O1LRCA,"One day, David receives the news that more than a hundred people want the bank sperm he used to do business with, when he was in his 20's, to reveal the identity of ""Starbuck"", the man who fathered them. David, known at the sperm bank as ""Starbuck"", is terrified at first, but after receiving a folder with these people's profile, he goes on to meet each one of them, now young adults, without revealing who he really is. This is when the movie starts with an array of funny and moving moments that show David that his time to grow up has come.

Don't expect a hilarious film with unexpected twists and ending, but rather a funny-sweet kind of film that makes you think about the consequences of your acts without pretending to be preachy or educational. ""Starbuck"" is an unpretentious comedy that looks for nothing more than to offer an hour and a half of light comedy.",1371600000,,870,4.506329113924051

4850966,4,B005O1LRCA,"Underneath the fantasy and humour of a man fathering hundreds of children, there's a touching story of a middle-aged Don Juan being transformed into an intelligent, reliable and caring father, eliciting tears of healing and joy from a number of people.  It arouses interest from all around the world making me suspect that if more people were to watch this, an increased rapprochement could take place between many emotionally estranged fathers and their children.

This movie also promotes communication between the two generations.  Twenty-something year olds just want a connection (""presence not presents"") while the dads want to know that if they were to step forward that their far from perfect efforts will still be acceptable.

The protagonist in this movie, David, nicknamed Starbuck, routinely kisses a photo of his mother and wishes her a good morning.  He finds it challenging to move on without her and it seems that he was the mother's favourite son.  Later on, he  tries to find a strong woman to help him grow up.  Once it was with a Russian mail order bride but she left him after three days.  When he attracts a beautiful young policewoman into his life and is on the verge of losing her as well, he decides that it's time to turn his life around.

As a metaphor, this movie seems to be about a man's efforts or shadow work to get to know himself with each ""child"" representing an aspect of himself which has gone underground.  The disabled child for his voicelessness from not being allowed to find his true self.  The star athlete for his confidence.  The addict for his destructive side.  The musican for beginning to put words to his feelings. The rebellious one for his moral conscience.

I think this movie is also a tribute to those who adopt children since by and large, most of Starbuck's children turned out all right.

This movie reminds me of the 1987 National Film Board of Canada production of ""The Last Straw"" about ""the world's most potent man in a comedy beyond conception"" which perhaps may have been an inspiration for the making of this interesting and award-winning film.  In French with English subtitles.  Highly recommended for all men.",1369094400,,2178,4.824797843665769
4850967,5,B005O1LRCA,"I adore this movie. Patrick Huard does a wonderful job portraying the varying emotions of a sperm donor whose kids come looking for him. My son was conceived in the same manner, and we have had contact with our sperm donor, but not with these wonderful results. It is definitely a ""FEEL GOOD"" movie I think everyone should enjoy.",1368748800,5,329,4.593220338983051
4850968,4,B005O1LRCA,"Imagine my surprise when out of the blue this past weekend this movie appeared at the local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, even though this movie is two years old and I think already available on DVD. I had heard about this movie, and the premise of the movie was such that I gave in and went to see it.

""Starbuck"" (2011 release from Quebec; 110 min.) brings the story of David (played by Patrick Huard), who in the late 80s made frequent donations to the local sperm bank (why? because he needed the money! Starbuck? his alias at the sperm bank!) and now 20+ years later learns from the sperm bank's lawyer that his sperm was used on many occasions, resulting in no less than 533 biological kids (!), and that 142 of them now have filed a class action law suit to find out the identity of their biological father. As it is, Davis is a good-for-nothing who slacks on the job (at his father's butcher shop) and not very nice to his girlfriend (whom we learn has just become pregnant). David gets a package with the profiles of the 142 kids in the class action, and he secretly starts out to observe them (without revealing his identity). They are in all walks of life: a pool lifeguard, a bartender, a foot manucurist, a guitarist playing in the subway for money and even a handicapped young man. Then one day one of the 142 has pieced things together and confronts David, threatening to ""out"" him. At this point we are about half-way into the movie. Will David's identity be revealed to these kids? Will he tell his girlfriend about his situation? To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: the first half of the movie is outright funny, as David is put in impossible situations and we see him trying to adjust as best he can. When he is first confronted by the lawyer with the facts, he keeps repeating ""yo no soy David Wosniak, yo no soy David Wosniak"", as if that will make the situation go away! When one of David's friends feels empathy for his situation, his friend claims ""you're experiencing post-partum depression, times 533"", haha! And on and on. But as the movie rolls into the second half, David starts, and hence we start, to comprehend the graveness of his situation. This man has 533 kids! with one more on the way! There are some serious undertones in the movie that make us reflect on what it means to be a parent, whether to one kids or to 533 kids. Kuods to writer-director Ken Scott who brings the script with a certain zaniness and craziness without ever going crossing the line into rudeness. And what can you say about the Quebecois-French accents, I just love it.

The mere subject matter of the movie was bound to create a buzz. That, coupled with the fact that this is actually a good quirky little movie, was bound to garner attention in Hollywood, and so it is that this movie will get the Holywood remake, with Vince Vaughn cast in the title role. I'm not holding my breath, to be honest. Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a funny movie with some serious undertones, I can readily recommend ""Starbuck"".",1367280000,8,3150,4.493891797556719

8480895,5,B005O1LRCA,"A great feel good movie. As a private sperm donor myself, it was something that I reflect on, and this movie addressed a lot of my thoughts, especially as the kids grow up. I think generation cryo from MTV was more accurate though. People are more interested in meeting and getting to know their half siblings than meeting the donor. Also, his life would be much more complicated than just dealing with a few hundred 2-dimensional extras. They would each be individuals seeking something unique to them.

Well, despite my feelings of the imperfectness of the rendering of the subject, I still totally enjoyed it as a movie and a story, and I think others would too. The main character is very likable.",1442793600,,701,4.699186991869919
