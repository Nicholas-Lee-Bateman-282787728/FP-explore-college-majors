2697535,5,B000KRMS44,The DVD is structured as a complete ballet class and it is easy to follow. There is great music that helps movements. Viktor Kabaniaev is excellent teacher.,1205280000,,156,4.814814814814815
2697536,1,B000KRMS44,"I bought this as a gift to my wife. She is a Ballet teacher.
The class follows the typical exercises' order and they are well executed.
The big problem is that there is a very bad synchronization between audio and video. The lipsync (in speeches) problem is tolerable, but the bad synchronization between excercises and music makes it almost impossible to follow.",1202860800,4,363,4.870967741935484
2697537,4,B000KRMS44,"I thought the routine was good, but after the barre there were only a few exercises in the centre and it would have been nice to have had some more e.g. a pirouette exercise.",1194652800,,174,4.147058823529412
2697538,4,B000KRMS44,Great no nonsense class.  He does not talk too much and shows each step wonderfully.,1456444800,,84,4.6
2697539,4,B000KRMS44,I enjoy this simple classic ballet class for home.,1452988800,,50,4.666666666666667
2697540,4,B000KRMS44,Its a good simple class. Not enough center work. But I would recommend it. As an older retired dancer with limited space it is a good class for me.,1436227200,,147,4.103448275862069
2697541,5,B000KRMS44,"great ballet class just what I was looking for loved the music only drawback for me was I couldn't see which foot was in front of the other,would like to find more like this.",1424217600,,174,4.147058823529412
2697542,5,B000KRMS44,"I took ONE ballet class, and it was in college. Ten years ago. Following along has been a little challenging, but I'm remembering more each time I watch.

This video is exactly what I was hoping to find. I'm a runner, and I wanted a low-impact way to stretch, strengthen, and build balance on my cross training days. So, I was looking for a true ballet class routine. Talk about hard to find! Almost every other ballet video out there is a ballet-based form of some other exercise. Not helpful. The last thing I wanted was to have my quads and calves screaming on a non-running day. I get enough of that during my hill workouts and long runs. Plus, those ballet-based workouts (not true ballet classes) focus on the large muscle groups. Again, if I want that, I have a thousand other options. I wanted to tap into those smaller stabilizing muscles, and especially the precision footwork involved with ballet. Both are incredibly important for a runner, especially when it comes to preventing injuries.

My only regret is that I paid $2 to rent the video first when I will absolutely be buying it for $12! Even then, a total of $14 is an incredible bargain for the content of this video. Amazing.",1421193600,3,1195,4.579439252336448
2697543,4,B000KRMS44,"I took a beginner ballet class a few years ago, due to lack of finances and time I had to stop. So, I've been looking for something that could fill in until I can get back to a class. This fits the bill perfectly. Many of the moves I remember from my class. If you are looking of some bouncy aerobics instructor that is going to encourage you with positive words do not use this video. If you want a ballet class that allows the student to focus on their movements then this is a good one. Although some have stated the lip syncing is disruptive I didn't find it bad. Honestly, I'm so focused on how my body feels and trying to do the moves correctly I wasn't watching his mouth. I rented it on advice from others and now I know I could purchase without any qualms.",1415664000,6,765,4.140939597315437
2697544,5,B000KRMS44,"Love this video...I wish there were more of these, with different combos and music. I like how the setting is in a bright, appealing environment and it goes through a typical ballet bar with all the combinations. The music sounds like a live pianist but I am not sure. I have been doing ballet since I was young and in college was part of several smaller ballet companies, so I just need something to keep up my strength and skills, which this is perfect for, not necessarily to teach me how to do ballet. I do this video in my living room, on a morning when I don't have the time to go to a class. Cuts back the travel time.",1415145600,3,625,4.1735537190082646
2697545,5,B000KRMS44,Perfect home barre + center basics. Those with a solid classical foundation can easily build on the combinations to suit their needs and/or skill level.,1411171200,,152,5.12
2697546,5,B000KRMS44,Good barre!,1404518400,,11,5.0
2697547,5,B000KRMS44,"This video really is just like going to ballet class.  I go to a class twice a week and was looking for a class-like video to fill in the other days.  I am a beginner that has been taking one or two classes a week for about a year.  This dvd is consistent with the barre we do in class as well as the adagio and jumping at the end.  The instruction is perfect and avoids needless repetition of how to do a movement.  He explains the movements and then gets right into it.  On others, he will demonstrate on one side and then go into it with the music.  Along the way, he gives you some relevant pointers and reminders and that is it  I could do this everyday and never tire of it!  The music is absolutely gorgeous and the sound quality is great.  I thought that the production value was excellent considering it was obviously not a high budget film.
This was exactly what I was looking for and I recommend it to anyone that wants to have a 50 minute class-like ballet experience in their home.  This is not a ballet workout dvd in the sense of Ballet Beautiful or NYC Ballet Workout, it is actual ballet barre and floor.
The only downside is that I was hoping for an across the floor section, however short it may be, and this dvd does not have that.  Like I said earlier, it is barre, adagio, jumps and that is it.  No steps or movements at the end.  I think I will get the Ballet 101 and 201 Combinations dvd to supplement.",1389744000,4,1426,4.156934306569343
2697548,5,B000KRMS44,"I love this video, it is exactly what I have been looking for as a former ballet dancer in my youth who can't make it to classes anymore. I have tried others and hated them because they are just too much like a workout at a gym rather than going to an actual dance class.  This was as close as I have found in a video to going to the studio for a class.

I wouldn't recommend this video for someone who hasn't had ballet or dance training as it is a real ballet class and as a former ballet teacher you need to know what you are doing to prevent injury (turning out improperly from the knees rather than the hips etc.)  However if you know the basic ballet class and proper technique and are looking for the music and combinations to follow for a barre and basic center then this is for you.

The production value could have been better but it didn't bother me at all.  And having it set in a house didn't bother either.  It was the content that is the winner here.  Thanks Victor Kabaniaev for making something for dancers.",1389744000,8,1024,4.1938775510204085
2697549,5,B000KRMS44,I never learned the ballet but I like the ideal of this it teach you and its fun I want to learn it as I think it wold be good for my back and for poise. I got his at Amazon and they have  a lot of books  and cds if you want to learn .,1389139200,,235,3.1785714285714284
2697550,4,B000KRMS44,"I use a number of class DVDs and this is a good solid one - and as with anything ballet, practice makes perfect.",1366416000,,112,3.9130434782608696
2697551,1,B000KRMS44,The sound of the instructor's voice and the movement of the mouth was way off and very distracting . This gave it a very amateur production feeling .,1361145600,,149,4.357142857142857
2697552,2,B000KRMS44,I found it boring and uninspiring.  I wanted a more encouraging instructor and more direction.  It's been along time since I practiced ballet.  Someone one else may love it.,1360972800,,173,4.896551724137931
2697553,5,B000KRMS44,"This was an enjoyable experience. I'm not advanced, but I have taken many classes over the years. This is the type of workout that it seems anybody could get something out of. It's not boring, or repetitive. I rented, and will purchase the DVD.",1359936000,,244,4.568181818181818
2697554,5,B000KRMS44,"I've been searching for a workout for former ballerinas like myself that's an actual ballet workout, as in a class--not a workout based on ballet technique. This is the best thing I've found--full barre class, along with some basic center work (adagio and jumps). Love it.",1358899200,7,272,4.934782608695652
2697555,5,B000KRMS44,"This is a great class for someone who has previous ballet experience.  He does not go into a lot of detail to describe how to do the movements, but they are very basic so if you have taken class before, you will be able to follow along.",1357948800,,236,4.0212765957446805
2697556,4,B000KRMS44,"This is great for days when you don't have the energy for a ton of cardio.  You do need to know ballet terms or, if you don't, you'll need to be able to face the TV on either side of the barre to follow along.",1355875200,,209,3.6444444444444444
2697557,3,B000KRMS44,"I have beginning to intermediate ballet experience. The combinations in the video are good, however, the audio/video being out of sync causes the instructor to be moving faster than the music. This can be corrected by simply listening  and following the music and not the instructor's movements....the problem with that is that he doesn't give prompts for the combinations. For example, in a physical class I am use to hearing the instructor calling out, tendu front and 1, tendu front and 2, tendu front and 2 and 3 and pile....this guy doesn't do that. He will show once and then you're on your own. If that's your style then great, but if not, this isn't the video for you. Overall, it's good, I do wish I had chosen something else.

P.S. - the fact that the video is shot in a home is not as distracting as the bad lighting. This video is worth about 6.99 not 11.99. I suggest you rent it first and see if you like it.",1351209600,5,922,4.41764705882353
2697558,5,B000KRMS44,"This DVD is exactly what I was looking for - not an exercise video but a beginner/intermediate ballet class that I could do at home. It is true to form and gives equal time to both sides of the body - as opposed to some instructional videos.  It is dubbed but it is in sync in terms of when he speaks (can't expect one language to match the lip movement of another).  Both music and movement are quite beautiful.  Just like a ballet class, he runs through what's next but gives limited explanation while the music is playing.  I appreciate this as it gives me space to get out of my head and feel the rhythm of the movement/music.

I wouldn't recommend this DVD to someone with no prior ballet knowledge.  But it's a great option for any ballet enthusiast looking to keep ballet an active part of their life... without all the challenges of trying to make a regular class.  And as far as where the DVD was filmed, I'd happily dance in that gorgeous space any day.  Thank you Viktor Kabaniaev!",1348790400,,992,4.382513661202186
2697559,3,B000KRMS44,"First of all I want to say this is the last video I buy from amazon since their on demand feature doesn't work on my android, which is one of the reasons I got it but amazon has a weird issue playing videos on other devices except your computer and roku. So if you have an android maybe boycott amazon until they resolve this.
Other than that I was very happy with the video. It feels like you're taking class and I like the russian vaganova style.",1326412800,,448,4.160919540229885
2697560,4,B000KRMS44,"To start off, yes the video quality, production value and dubbing are pretty terrible. That being said, this video is the closest I've found to going to an actual ballet class.  Really, the content is great. The barre exercises are cohesive and the music is really nice. I'm not sure if this video would be good for someone without previous ballet instruction as proper technique is only barely touched on in the last 2 minutes of the video, but for someone like me that's looking to supplement classes or be able to take class on my own schedule without having to leave the house, this video is great!",1315958400,,602,4.574074074074074
2697561,5,B000KRMS44,"This is a great at home ballet video---the closest thing to taking ballet class I have found on the internet. It's inefficient and not practical to schedule one's life around dance classes when you are not in the dance world.  In my pre-mom days, I use to dance 3 -4 days a week and really miss it.  I hope he comes out with other videos.
The music is great and you work every muscle.",1283040000,18,384,4.175675675675675
2697562,3,B000KRMS44,credit my aerobics class background but i like to be talked through the moves and he doesn't do much of that. i haven't really done anything with this yet other than just watching but plan to soon; will update my review when i try it out in practice.,1272326400,,250,4.229166666666667
2697563,5,B000KRMS44,I bought this DVD several years ago and return to it time and time again because the exercises work all the muscles in the body and are beautifully demonstrated by Victor. My only regret is that he does not do more centre exercises. I am looking forward to his next DVD and hope it will be longer.,1250121600,,297,4.228070175438597
2697564,4,B000KRMS44,"The ballet class on this DVD is great... just a classical ballet class as I remember it.  The description says beginning-advanced, but it's actually just beginning-intermediate.  You could always add your own enhancements to make it more challenging, but it's not given to you in the DVD.  The pace is good and the music is nice.  He is Russian, but it's overdubbed in English, so sometimes his speech doesn't quite match up with what he's doing, but the music is synced well, so that's all that really matters to me.  It's a very simple class - I think it's about an hour long - but if you're like me and just trying to get back into the swing of ballet before going back to taking real classes, it's perfect.",1238889600,18,710,4.4728682170542635
2697565,5,B000KRMS44,"Although the set of the ballet class was simple and looked like someone's house, the content in this DVD was amazing. All moves were properly explained while Victor was demonstrating them. The music was soothing. Great class for an adult Ballerina like me!",1229904000,13,256,4.976744186046512
2697566,5,B000KRMS44,great ballet class you can use to practice at your home from the best in Russia,1225929600,,79,4.0

8159065,1,B000KRMS44,Poor quality. I couldn't fast forward. Not what I was hoping for.,1513641600,,65,4.5
8159066,4,B000KRMS44,"I rented this as a first-time ballet warm up (I used to dance long ago, but not ballet). Victor is warm, easy to follow. The production quality is good, the setting is inviting and old school. The music is beautiful. I will end up purchasing this to have in my queue.",1494460800,,267,4.254901960784314
8159067,3,B000KRMS44,"Good, quick ballet class. I rented for 1 week and took the class 4 times. A beginner would appreciate simplicity of barre exercises and being able to follow instructor. A more seasoned ballet dancer will appreciate a solid, well rounded class grounded in the basics. There is a short center portion with adagio and petite allegro. There are no pirouettes or grande allegro.",1494115200,2,373,4.936507936507937
8159068,5,B000KRMS44,I love that Dvd. Beautiful music. Feels like a real ballet class. I wish he would offer more Dvd's.,1493856000,,99,4.2631578947368425
8159069,5,B000KRMS44,"Kicked my butt, in the best possible way. Perfect ""class"" feel at home. Loved it! I'm coming back to ballet as an ""Adult beginner"" (w/ 8 years of youth training, 1 year of pointe).",1491955200,,180,4.323529411764706
8159070,5,B000KRMS44,I love this because he just does the moves and you follow along.  No continuous happy comments that drive a person crazy.  He does the work and doesn't talk.  I like that.,1483920000,2,171,4.28125
8159071,4,B000KRMS44,"When this first came out and when most of the other reviews here were written, it's likely true that very few on-demand ballet class options were around.  Now, you can find true ballet classes online without much effort, but this still stands as a very clear and clean simple *Beginner* barre plus (beginner) center tendus, adagio, and sauts.  I only wish there were more center and more advanced work because Kabaniaev does have such clear, classical form.  If you are new to ballet or don't know what a Beginner-level class might entail, a Basic ballet tutorial might be your best bet in advance of attending class where a teacher can ensure your proper form.  Toi, toi, toi.",1481155200,,677,4.760683760683761
8159072,5,B000KRMS44,I love his ballet class.  Easy to understand and follow along.,1472860800,,62,4.636363636363637
8159073,5,B000KRMS44,"The perfect ballet video!!! Just like class! The instructor takes you through a series of classical ballet combinations, first and mostly on barre, then center. Exactly like the classes that I grew up with. Quite a bit is very quick and it is assumed that you already know the terminology, and have the form, but if you have had previous training, keeping up is no problem. I would give this a six star if I could. I have been searching for exactly this for years, and because I could not get to class (or willing to pay the cost of class) I thought that I couldn't take ballet again. Now it's totally possible to train just like I use to.  I am even ordering a backup, as well!",1458518400,2,678,4.296875
