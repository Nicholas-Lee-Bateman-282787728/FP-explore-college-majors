1883763,3,B00009LHYL,"I wanted to see this movie as an adult because it was one I had enjoyed so much as a child.  John Lund's slapstick performance as Skyler Tatlock stood out for me back then.  Now I appreciate the performances of Barry Fitzgerald and Monty Woolley.  It has the feel and appeal of The Man Who Came to Dinner or Holiday (with Carry Grant).  The sad thing is the poor quality of this 1948 B&W film.  I bought it for my video library and will watch it again, however, it is only available on VHS and is one of the films that really needs to be cleaned up and re-released. Unfortunately, important films are probably in line before it.",1129507200,4,628,4.288135593220339
1883764,4,B00009LHYL,"A lovely screwball comedy, with an excellent cast and a clever script as you would expect from Charles Brackett and Richard Breen. John Lund shows a deft comedy touch as the stuntman hired to impersonate the dead idiot heir but who falls in love with his supposed sister. Lund and Wanda Hendrix have some very good scenes together while Ilka Chase, Barry Fitzgerald and Monty Woolley give great support. Even Robert Stack gives a good performance. Only director Richard Haydn's small part as the lawyer is totally over the top (played under the name Richard Rancyd - enough said).

It is a shame that this is only available as a very poor quality video. Why do so many good films never get released on video or DVD when so much rubbish does?",1103500800,13,741,4.613636363636363
1883765,3,B00009LHYL,"I have loved this film since it first came out and it took me years to find a not very good tape of it.  I still like to look at it, however, for the sheer joy of seeing this marvelous comedy again and again.  (This would be 5 stars if tape quality were better!)
Big suprise is John Lund who is absolutely hilarious as the a man pretending to be the childishly mad Tatlock heir.  I had liked Lund as a handsome leading man with a rich voice, but this performance revealed a far more versatile talent than I had imagined.  Everyone is great in this, from the acid Monty Wooley to Richard Haydyn himself (director) as the aggravatingly slow lawyer.  Barry Fitzgerald, Robert Stack, Wanda Hendrix--all are great at keeping the pace moving and the laughs coming.  This was one of those forgotten films Paramount did with some of their lesser contract players and with little publicity.  It was far better than the offhand way it was presented in theatres.
Lund's career was destroyed when Paramount insisted he make that dreadful disaster, 'Bride of Vengeance'.  He tried to resist, as did several other actors who had read the script but were forced by contract to perform, and for their pains, they were tossed out after the film bombed.  'Tatlock' was one of Lund's last at Paramount but as a Lund fan, I can only say, 'Tatlock's Millions' was his best!",1074297600,8,1352,4.576763485477178
1883766,1,B00009LHYL,"Before purchasing this video, I read a negative review posted by another purchaser. The review referred to the quality of the tape; not the content. I contacted the seller before purchasing and was told (practically verbatum) the reply that is listed in the sellers response to the original review. I was guaranteeed a refund if I was not happy. I bought the tape and the quality is TERRIBLE!! I DO LIVE IN AMERICA and that doesn't help. Twice the screen completely blacked out, multiple times the channel it was taped from flashed across the screen, and there is much ""snow"" in the picture.

Actually, Mad Phat Enterprises, Inc, in my defence i did write to amazon once i received this video and before i wrote the review. I asked them to take it back and give me a new one with better quality. They sent out a brand new video in which i was told was of top quality and yet it was the exact same copy. So now you say only one bad copy may have sliped through, well i seem to have been very unlucky getting two bad copies. Perhaps you should review your reviewing tactics as i don't think there working for you. I did the right thing and contact people before writing the review and i did receive money back however i was out shipping cost, time and a birthday present and as a customer i would have prefered to know just what i was buying and that is why i wrote the review. Obviouly i'm not the only one as i see someone else wrote about the poor quality of your video. So perhaps instead of saying it was my fault that i didn't write to you before writing a review you should check your paperwork or hey here's is an idea perhaps instead of trying to make yourselves look better how about making sure you have good quality items so people get what they paid for and don't have to write warning people against your products.

1883774,1,B00009LHYL,"I am really disappointed in this item. First, packaged in a slim dvd box, like I use to store the dvds I copied from my old VHS. No cover, only a small piece of scotch tape to keep the box closed. When I put the dvd in the player, no menu, started the play, what a shock, the sound was ok, but the picture very fuzzy throughout most of the movie, at least in 3 occasions, at the bottom of the screen, there was a bar showing, I think, a TV chanel number, with the tittle of the movie. Then, almost at the end of the movie, the screen went black, and a notice came on saying to stay put, they were changing the reel.
WHAT IS THIS, I paid 19.95, plus shipping and handling to receive this crap. I really don't know how you dare to send such bad quality dvd. I really wanted to get this movie, I have been looking for it for a long time, and finally, I found it on your site, but I am sorry I bought it. I almost wanted to keep it, even with very bad images, but not at the price of 19.95 plus shipping and handling.

1883776,1,B00009LHYL,"Regarding the copy/transfer:

HORRIBLE COPY!

I'm shocked that anyone gave this copy 5 stars, unless they were reviewing the content and not the picture/sound quality.

It SEEMS to be taped from a television broadcast with a home movie camera no less; unwatchable ... maybe bootlegged ... pirated.  Or maybe the copyright owner legally copied and sold it knowing it was junk.  If so, that should be noted in its description.

Amazon should investigate.

I have talked to several vendors about this particular movie.  Their consensus is that the movie either no longer exists or has been locked away in a vault; I've never found it listed as a circulating movie from any reputable rental-vendor. I haven't seen it broadcast on television in many years.  It will probably rot and we will lose a great classic.

Regarding the content:

WONDERFUL CONTENT!  It seems to be complete.

In its day, this was one of my favorite comedy-romance gems! Totally hilarious and decent for all to watch.

My advice:

If you want this move regardless of picture/sound quality ... GET IT... it's precious.  I personally regret seeing it so badly copied.  It actually depressed me because expectations were so high after searching for so long.

If any of you ever find a good copy or a modern remake of this movie, please contact me!",1308960000,2,1313,4.864253393665158

1883778,1,B00009LHYL,"I've been looking for this movie on DVD for literally YEARS, so was ecstatic at finding it available thru my trusted first-choice vendor, Amazon.com.  But when it arrived, I was appalled to find that it is a 'homemade' DVD, recorded from who-knows-what source.  Clear plastic cover with a computer generated UPC code and the title of the movie on it was the ONLY ""cover art"".  Printing on the disc itself is plain-jane black block letters on a white background -- obviously NOT a studio issue.

All that was bad enough, and THEN we tried to watch it.

The content of the disc was some horrible old British stage play entitled ""A School for Scandal"", and (ignoring the fact that it wasn't even CLOSE to being ""Miss Tatlock's Millions"") the recording quality was absolutely the WORST I've ever seen.  It looked like it had been dubbed from a VHS tape recorded from TV and transferred from tape to tape repeatedly before 'mastering' the DVD.  This is some BAD stuff.

To say I am disappointed is a serious understatement.  I'm OUTRAGED that they can't even get the right movie on the DVD!  I just finished printing up the return authorization, and will send this back ASAP.

I guess my first clue should have been the absence of an image for this offering where one would expect to see cover art.  NO IMAGE AVAILABLE is quite probably CODE for ""steer clear of this piece of crap"".  Hopefully, I'll know better next time.

Amazon, I'm VERY disappointed in you for even pretending to offer this movie.  I'd give it ZERO stars if I could, but that isn't an option.",1276041600,13,1558,4.614545454545454

7991210,5,B00009LHYL,"The original film is a romp about a Hollywood stuntman who is privately commissioned to impersonate a long-lost heir to a sizable fortune.  Thing is, this heir he's impersonating was a brain-damaged and raving lunatic; so, the impersonator must pull out all the stops to convince the family that he really is their barking mad prodigal son who has finally returned.  The premise is original and funny as hell, and the story takes several unexpected twists along the way (such as the impersonator falling in love with his own sister).  It's more than just a comedy.

I remember seeing this film on TV a few times as a child in the 1960s, but it seemed to vanish altogether by the 1970s, and I always wondered whatever happened to it.  It wasn't until the age of the Internet that I was finally able to search up the movie's whereabouts: Apparently, Paramount Pictures chose to pull it out of commercial and broadcast circulation several decades ago, placing ""Miss Tatlock's Millions"" in the proverbial vault, never to return.

Consequently, the only surviving commercial iteration of this film is a copy of a copy of a copy of a homemade videotape copy of the original movie.  As you can imagine (and as other reviewers can attest), the video quality has suffered many magnitudes of deterioration through repeated cloning.  It's filled with video artifacts, snow, stutters, blackouts and more.  When I purchased my first copy some 18 years ago, it was in horrible viewing condition, and I can imagine that it's in worse condition today.  You can be sure it's only going to become even worse as time wears on.

This is a shameful fate for what was once a brilliantly entertaining film, and I only hope that enough viewers will campaign for a restored re-release of the movie from its archived master reels.",1515715200,,1804,4.805825242718447
7991211,3,B00009LHYL,"The great British character comedian Richard Haydn (Lubitsch's CLUNY BROWN) made his directorial debut here, appearing onscreen briefly as fussy barrister Fergel under the pseudonym Richard Rancyd (Haydn also acted alliteratively as Stanley Stayle and Claud Curdle). Billy Wilder's classy associate Charles Brackett produced, heavily doctoring the adapted screenplay with Richard Breen in a failed attempt to mimic the light, airy (and original) screwball comedies of Wilder, Mitchell Leisen or Preston Sturges. The Paramount high visual style is all over the screen in a Santa Barbara setting (moving West from Sturges' brilliant PALM BEACH STORY) and the cast is mostly fine, but the film plays as dated (and inappropriate) staged theatrics, not as original cinematic screwball. Haydn favors static proscenium framing and faithful allegiance to the Brackett-Breen script, so the film is overlong at 100 minutes and redundant without ever provoking genuine titters or bellylaughs.

Brackett and Breen worked from unpromising material, a failed French boulevard ""comedy"" by Jacques Deval called OH, BROTHER! that flopped on Broadway (23 performances in 1945). The ""comedy"" themes are brain damage, pyromania, incestuous marriage and chronic alcoholism. Wilder, Leisen or Sturges would have totally scrapped the play, or passed on ever adapting it, but Brackett and Breen forged on and hapless Haydn slavishly filmed every stagebound word, omitting nuance and breakneck screwball timing (which derived from Hollywood-perfected silent slapstick shorts).

The performances, evidently given under duress, are variable: Wanda Hendrix, playing straight and very much in Sturges mode, is beautiful and delightful (in a Margaret Sullavan perm), but her screentime is minimized even though she plays the underage title heiress. John Lund alternates indecisively between a pomaded impersonation of Alan Ladd and an excruciating imitation of Jerry Lewis. Neither is remotely funny, and both those Paramount superstars are better being themselves than hopeless Lund is in channeling them. (Both Mitch Leisen and Ray Milland play themselves in the film's prologue, both funnier and cuter in their cameos than the film's endless remaining runtime.)

Robert Stack goes shirtless (and punches out Lund in two choreographed fight scenes). Tart-tongued Ilka Chase also has a shirtless moment, and neither Elizabeth Patterson nor old pro Monty Woolley is used to maximum advantage. Hendrix and Stack are funny by not being funny and in spite of the desperate script, and Haydn (Rancyd) and Patterson are always worth watching even as their characterful talents are squandered. Paramount have understandably suppressed this Rorschach blot on their eminent comedy-style rsum, although the film clearly begs for studio-sanctioned restoration and newly struck prints.",1503014400,,2844,5.766666666666667

Headed by John Lund, who displays an unknown flair for slapstick and predates Jerry Lewis' mannerisms, the cast reads like a ""Who's Who"" of Hollywood's finest character comedians, including a hilarious cameo by the film's director, Richard Haydn, all getting their moments to shine.  For a 1948 film, ""Miss Tatlock's Millions"" is also, daringly, sexy in many scenes between John Lund and his leading lady, Wanda Hendrix.  There is also an incestuous subtext and a racial-mixing subplot that is also pretty frank and daring for such a film.  It's all handled breezily and in very good taste.
