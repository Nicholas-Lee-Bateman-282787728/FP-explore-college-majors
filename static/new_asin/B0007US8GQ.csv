I imagined peeling back layers of lattice work, revealing intricate structures.  Want to know what it looks like?  Shine a colored light on a crystal or agate, and look at in thru a magnifying glass.  That's it.  And set it to insipid harp music.

I suppose it would be OK if it were the only video of it's kind, but you can do so much better.  There are high def fractal zoom videos where you really are going into the heart of it with an explosion of color, rather than the 2 or 3 colors shining on these crystals.

A video which succeeds where this one fails is ""Borealis"", which uses lasers shone thru crystals, and set to the music of Steve Roach.

Or Google ""cinemandala"", an AMAZING kaleidoscopic video I also purchased.",1246665600,,845,4.352564102564102
8051978,4,B0007US8GQ,"I happened to catch this movie on TV not too long ago.  Of particular interest to me is that - near the end of the movie (the 1951 version with Stirling Hayden and Thomas Mitchell) - there are some fabulous scenes of the Long Beach Pike.  You can see the Cyclone Racer, the front of the Majestic Ballroom (as it was once called), some of the rides, some shots of the Long Beach Municipal Auditorium, the west side of Rainbow Pier, and a tram or two that used to transport people to and fro.
In my youth, on many occasions, I visited the Pike, Rainbow Pier, the Lagoon, the Municipal Auditorium.  I have many precious memories of these places, and I am always on the lookout for any photos of this area.  The 1951 version of this movie - in addition to its unusually high quality for a low-budget movie - brings back so many precious memories of a place from the past that essentially is no longer there.
I know there are others out there who loved the Pike and surrounding area as much as I, and I know they too will enjoy seeing this movie - if for no other reason - to once again catch glimpses of their past.
Enjoy!",1042761600,,1118,4.234741784037559
