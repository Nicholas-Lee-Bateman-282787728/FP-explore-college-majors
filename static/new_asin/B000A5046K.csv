2360855,4,B000A5046K,"Of the 104 total episodes in ""The Adventures of Superman,"" the first 52 were filmed in black and white with the rest switching over to color (impressive foresight for a 1950s series with a relatively modest budget).  Therefore, the first season (26 episodes)should be in black and white.  Let's hope the ""color"" designation for this DVD set is a mistake or refers to some of the extra items.  Though the series is a jewel of the television science fiction genre, the first couple of seasons of Superman were also characterized by gritty crime elements, replete with the urban landscapes similar to the popular film noir movies of the 1940s and 1950s.  Such films -- depicting the darker elements of society's seedy side -- properly view better in the gray tones of black and white cinematography.  Any attempt at colorization would spoil the presentation. I withhold a star simply on the basis of the product information refering to color.  Otherwise, it is great to see this series coming to DVD.",1122768000,10,997,4.8698224852071
2360856,5,B000A5046K,"The Adventures of Superman was a staple of the 1950's early 1960's for anyone who was a grammer school age in that time. George Reeves is and has always been the ONLY SUPERMAN in the many years since I 1st saw or read Action Comics where Superman first appeared. Living in Gastonia, NC in the '50's, the show came on mon-fri at 5 pm. I rushed home from school humming the show theme. Such a fan I was, I broke an arm jumping off the front porch playing, what else...""Superman. With all the bootleg copies out there I'm glad to see it finally come from the studio. We can only hope the 2nd and 3rd seasons won't take another 50 years to be released. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this TV show for any and all who want to ""recapture"" some portion of their youth. Living in a period and time much different from today or any other since the demise of our ""Happy Days"" of a childlike world in the 1950's!!!!",1122595200,4,890,4.272189349112426
2360857,4,B000A5046K,Is this really in color? Has it been colorized? I remember the show being in black & white.,1122163200,,91,4.111111111111111
2360858,5,B000A5046K,"I thank you all. All of your reviews were very helpful. There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. I can't wait to see SUPERMAN AND THE MOLEMEN in it's original theatrical presentation. Will it have a different theme song?I remember when I was 7 years old and how I resented my father for changing the channel from the cartoons I was watching to put on Superman. When I was 9 years old,BATMAN became the popular show and they would air Batman and Superman back to back on WPIX 11 in New York. I quickly grew to love SUPERMAN.I had butterflies in my belly waiting for school to get out for the day,just to sit through another adventure. And yes to hear that rescue music that made my heart swell with joy. All I know is that Kirk Alyn was supposed to play the MAN OF STEEL for the Molemen movie but wanted too much money. So George Reeves was hired instead. I don't know if he auditioned or they just said ""Put on this costume and stand in front of the camera. Maybe that question along with other people's questions will be answered in the bonus features. Whatever the reason I'm glad Mr. Reeves got the part. He had such a dynamic personality no one else could possibly convincingly play Superman. In fact in a Second Season episode THE CLOWN WHO CRIED;Superman appears on a telethon asking for donations to send city children to summer camp. He was so sincere and his performance was so endearing that my eyes welled up with tears as I was looking for the checkbook. That just goes to show you the idiocy of Hollywood not giving George Reeves other roles to play, or if they did his parts were then cut. HIGH PRAISE TO A GREAT TV SHOW AND TO A GREAT ACTOR WHO NEVER GOT A FAIR SHAKE.",1121904000,10,1699,4.345911949685535
2360859,5,B000A5046K,"Supermen have come and gone but looking back in time at this collection absolutely confirms the fact that there was and is only one man of steel.....George Reeves. In this first season of a more serious superman we see Reeves brilliantly portray the dual role in what is arguably the best acted made for kids TV drama series ever produced. It short its a combination of the Untouchables and The Gene Autry Show rolled into one. What I mean is this show is so well written that they could easily go from intense crime situations (I think even a bit heavy considering the targeted audience) and then swing to the opposite side of the spectrum using the comedic skills of John Hamilton and Jack Larson as well as George himself. But the absolute barn burner is the hotter than a pistol Phyllis Coates. Her in your face no nonsense Lois Lane has never been equalled by anybody.....I SAID ANYBODY! And quite frankly her sexual appeal is incredible given she almost never wore more that a business suit and a lousy looking 50's style hat. Did I say this was made for kids.....well then I've never grown up because I am watching this stuff every night and I'm in my mid fifties! You say you want escapism.....you say you want to leave your cares behind.....you say you want action and adventure.  Look.....up in the sky. It's a bird.....it's a plane.....it's it's.....""GREAT CAESARS GHOST"" what are you waiting for! Run out today and buy it before they take it off the market. This is the best of the best.....it don't get any better!!!",1121731200,11,1529,4.642066420664206
2360860,5,B000A5046K,"All fans of Superman have been waiting a loooong time for this release. I read somewhere that it was #1 most requested TV series that had not yet appeared on DVD.

As the other reviewers have noted, this is far and away the best season of the George Reeves edition of the Man of Steel. There is far more violence, gunplay and crime than was present in later years. The black & white photography adds to the episodes' noir-ish feel.

Phyllis Coates contributes significantly to the mood in these early episodes as her take on Lois is a good deal more ""no-nonsense"" than Noel Neill's (although Noel will always be Lois Lane to me).

A small technical note if you're unfamiliar with the series. The epsiodes ""The Unknown People - Part I"" and ""Part II"" are simply the feature film ""Superman and the Mole Men"" chopped into two pieces and used as an inexpensive way to round out the first season of made-for-TV episodes. The original feature only runs 59 minutes, so they didn't really need to trim much footage to squeeze it into two half-hour episodes (counting credits and commercials).

Here's hoping the boxed set allows you to view ""Mole Men"" as either the uncut theatrical feature or as the twin TV episodes.

Here's also hoping we get a generous selection of the original Kellogg's commercials that included the original cast members. (Back then, the show's stars were allowed to pitch product in the commercials as well). As I recall, the producers would allow George Reeves to appear in the commercials as Clark Kent, but never in uniform as Superman.",1121472000,11,1555,4.723247232472325
2360861,5,B000A5046K,"What a treat, both for Superman fans and people who just enjoy classic t.v. shows of the fifties.  It's pretty much universally acknowledged that season one of THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN is far and away the best of the series.  George Reeves was a no-nonsense hero, and quite believable in the role.  The series had plenty of action and the first-season scripts were usually solid.

And I'm pleasantly surprised to see the rare theatrical feature, SUPERMAN AND THE MOLE MEN included here.  Although it's essentially Superman on a b-movie budget, there's plenty to like about this forgotten piece of Superman history.

A common practice in the early days of television was to get a show's actors to endorse the advertisers' products.  Perhaps the rarest and most unusual treat for fans of classic t.v. are the orignial Kellog's cereal commercials, featuring cast members from the show.  Clark Kent sells Frosted Flakes!

There's an informative documentary, with comments from Superman experts and a VERY old Jack Larson, who played Jimmy Olsen on the show.  With all these extras and a first-rate presentation of the episodes, this is a classic t.v. lover's dream come true.  Highly recommended.",1121299200,211,1194,5.103092783505154
2360862,5,B000A5046K,"First off, I've never been ""the first"" to review a DVD on Amazon, so let me just say I'm thrilled.  And, since today is July 7 and this DVD isn't even going to be released until October 18, I'm going to stick to some general thoughts on the show and share some information on what I have read pertaining to the bonus items to be included.

For those who don't know, this is the first season of the television program the Adventures of Superman which debuted in 1952.  This season features Phyllis Coates as Lois Lane - she would be replaced by Noel Neill in the later seasons.  (Neill played Lois in the Superman movie serials.)  This first season is highly regarded among fans of the show, and was much more gritty or realistic than subsequent seasons.  As for completeness, we'll all just have to keep our fingers crossed and hope the shows are released in their uncut versions - close to 27 minutes each!

2360883,5,B000A5046K,"Season 1 is probably the best of all. I always liked Phyllis Coates as Lois Lane, she was more ballsy than Noel Neill.

As to Lois Lane, I give it a toss-up between Noel & Phyllis.  To me both Ladies played great parts.  For the time period, like the serials, B & W just added more to the realistic action to the movies. JMHO But the colored ones are like watching a Sit-Com.",1459900800,,543,3.909090909090909

2361032,5,B000A5046K,"Original Superman series gets a nice, respectful treatment here. The episodes appear to be complete & uncut. They look grainy & gritty, with scratches, dirt & debris and whatnot, but it is what it is. Short of a total frame-by-frame restoration effort using the original camera elements, this is probably as good as this show will ever look. Season One includes some nice supplements as well. This and Season Two were the BEST the series had to offer. The slide towards a very young kiddie audience, mandated by the show's sponsors, was already well underway by the end of Season Two. Dumbed down, doofus characters like Professor Pepperwinkle and Mister Zero are the bane of the series, but even then it's still enjoyable on a ""silly-fun"" level. Thankfully in Season One there are no such groan-inducing shenanigans. The threats are very real and Superman is tested time and again by some decidedly nasty, ruthless criminal types. Phyllis Coates was THE perfect Lois Lane and of course George Reeves was one of a kind. Too bad he didn't work out to get the kind of physique really needed for the part, but that wasn't the thing back then. (Man, that foam rubber muscle suit he wore beneath the iconic blue & red tights must have been a nightmare to act in! God bless him.) The stunts are a little more inspiring in this first season as well, before George got a touch of superstar-itis and refused to do any more flying bits. Reeves is at his leanest here, and his youthful vigor & earnestness shine through as both Superman & Clark Kent. These shows are full of good old-fashioned memories and they look & sound terrific on this 5-disc Warner Home Video release. 5 STARS.",1423353600,2,1673,4.6938775510204085

2361058,5,B000A5046K,"The Adventures of Superman takes me back to my childhood - and this first season of adventures started them all!
As you'll find from most reviews of this B&W season, the episodes have a grittier tone then the ensuing seasons.  George Reeves is great at bringing the classic American hero to life from the comic pages.  He's more forceful in this season, facing off mostly against crime leaders & hoods, with the occasional sci-fi device (robot, etc) thrown in.  While the Superman character appears to become more light hearted in following seasons, it is interesting to note that Clark Kent remains a tough, risk taking reporter throughout and not a feeble excuse at a secret identity.  Phylls Coates' Lois Lane is an equally hard as nails reporter.  This was Coates sole season as the lovely Lois Lane.  The rest of the cast - Jack Larson as Jimmy Olsen, Neil Hamilton as Perry White, & familiar film face Robert Shayne as Inspector Henderson - would remain throughout the show's run.
The black and white episodes are beautifully presented and the extras are nice treats.  I'm not a huge fan of commentaries, but the ones presented on several of these episodes made me smile as film historians pointed out interesting production facts and recalled first viewing the series when it aired as youngsters.  While I may have watched it as a youngster of a different generation, my experience in front of the TV set was similiar.  Also included in the package is a DVD of a George Reeves western short, the origonal release of Superman and the Mole Men and a 30 minute or so documentary.  The documentary is rather routine.  There's no big surprises for fans of the show but small treats like comic writers revealing their fondness for the show led them to incoporate the Inspector Henderson character into the hero's comic pages for the first time in the 80s.
Of the episodes, my favorites were Superman On Earth, revealing the man of steel origin with what must have been fabulous effects for the era and The Evil Three in which White and Olsen find themselves immeresed in some mad men's hunt for buried treasure!  The latter episode includes commentary.",1416873600,3,2153,4.789189189189189

2361076,5,B000A5046K,"It's difficult to really explain the changes that went through this series from the first to the sixth season, but I'll try to give some background for you so you have a better idea of what you are purchasing here. Season one of the series was produced by a man named Bob Maxwell. He also produced many of the Superman radio episodes that preceded the TV series. Before this series went on the airwaves there was a short movie called 'Superman and the Mole men' which played in theaters. The cast was the new Superman played by George Reeves. The new Lois Lane was played by Phyllis Coates. I say 'new' because there were two Superman serials that played in theaters before this series was even thought of. The serials starred Kirk Alyn as Superman and had Noel Neil as Lois Lane. I mention this partly because Neil went on to play Lois again in the second season of this series.
Well, Maxwell's idea of a Superman series would be a kids show but would also appeal to adults as well. There were 24 half hour dramas this season and included a 2 part episode 'The Unknown People' which was an edited version of the previously mentioned movie that hit theaters first. (By the way, the actual movie 'Superman and the Mole Men' is also included in the special features). These half hour dramas were very much like mini-movies. There were great gangster action scenes throughout the season. There were stabbings, beatings, people shot and killed, some people falling to their deaths, and even a poor old woman in a wheelchair who was pushed down a stairway. Oh, yes, there was also a young girl who had to wear leg braces in order to walk and the villain in this episode removed her brace so she couldn't walk to get any help. These are scenes you would NEVER find on TV today. Superman was a no-nonsense superhero and Reeves also played Clark Kent just the same. There is really no difference between the personalities of Kent and Superman in this series, causing one to really wonder why Lois, Jimmy, and Perry White can't see the obvious. But that's another topic.
This season was created before there was an actual TV sponsor. Some of the actors were even told when they signed on that this show would never be seen by anyone, so go ahead, take the money and run. Of course, that is the farthest thing from the truth in what actually happened. Yes, this was a black-and-white season. Superman's suit was actually not red, yellow and blue. It was gray and brown so that the colors would be much more distinguishable in the no-color filming. But this was also the season that is set apart from any other season. Since it had no sponsor, Maxwell could do much more what he wanted no holds barred. Some great episodes (arguably, of course) were the pilot 'Superman on Earth' (Which, by the way, was the last episode filmed in the season but the first one aired). Other pretty dark episodes were 'The Haunted Lighthouse', 'A Night of Terror', 'Birthday letter', 'The Secret of Superman', 'The Stolen Costume', 'The Evil Three' (probably the darkest episode of them all), and 'Crime Wave'. That's just a small sample of what I would consider are the darkest and coolest episodes of this season. Watching this season may actually cause many kids to see Superman as really COOL-not nerdy or the boy scout that he still seems to be known as today.
Not only is Reeves a serious actor but Phyllis Coates (Lois Lane) was also not someone you want to get on your bad side. Coates was a very independent woman who often took care of herself. She was tough and determined. She also is known for her ear piercing screams in many of the episodes. Jack Larson as Jimmy Olsen was a perfect choice for Jimmy Olsen. At this point he was also a little more serious character as well. He really was able to shine more often as a comedic actor in the later seasons. Also included in the cast were John Hamilton as the gruff and grumpy Perry White (former mayor of Metropolis) and finally rounding out the cast was Inspector Henderson played by Robert Shayne.
Another interesting point about this series is that several of the episodes have some great looking take-offs when Reeves was actually using wires to hoist him into the air. And many of the flying scenes were top-notch for a small budgeted TV show. Some of the actual flying scenes were very good! Superman even made a few mid-air catches. However, in one episode (Ghost Wolf) Reeves was lifted by wires in the air but the wires broke, causing him to crash to the floor. To add insult to injury, Maxwell's reaction didn't seem to be so much for Reeve because he was quoted as saying in terror 'Oh, my God, the STAR!' After this, Reeve decided it was time to quit the wires and he went to a less dangerous way to take off..a springboard. Since he was quite athletic, Reeves was able to have a running start, jump on the springboard right below camera and have some great jumps, tumbling on a soft mat on the other side.
I know a great deal about this series and could talk much more on just this season alone. But the most important thing to remember is that this season was a pre-Kelloggs sponsored season and so it was dark, heavy, and not just for kids. This is what sets it apart from any of the other seasons. It's a way to see Superman in episodes that are actually even darker than some of the 'Dark Knight' Batman movies and TV cartoon episodes. If you can get past that the episodes are not color, you can really find some great entertainment. Hopefully this season will also get you hooked to watch the next seasons as well.",1415491200,3,5566,4.5228174603174605

2361082,5,B000A5046K,"If you watched these as a kid, as I did, in my case as reruns in the 60's, you'll appreciate the effort of a 1952 TV series that offers thrills, mystery, humor, villains and super feats wrapped up tightly in about 25 minutes, now put together in a neat package with extras.

As a youngster, I thought the special effects were B-grade and the tights, stuffed arms and ""red diaper', a bit much; my kids laughed when they first saw the outfit; however, each story is a mini-movie adventure, not so much about Superman's super powers, but rather giving us a mystery, baddies, dire straits and a satisfying, super rescue.

Like me, my children find the stories captivating and a bit creepy at times.  The first year with 26 episodes are darker then subsequent years.  There's murder and mayhem.  The villains brutalize and threaten viciously, e.g., a woman gets her skull cracked in The Monkey Mystery; Lois Lane gets slugged with a gun or belted unconscious in several episodes including A Night of Terror; poor Jimmy Olsen, noble and heroic, is always getting beat up, tied up, left to die, like in The Haunted Lighthouse; however, it all sets up for the comforting rescue by Superman.

I enjoy the actors.  George Reeves, although he wears a padded suit, is 6' 1"", athletic, a good amateur boxer and musician.  His demise has it's own mystery; however, he took his position as a role model for kids very seriously.  Phyllis Coates, Lois Lane only for the 1st year of the TV show, exudes a more serious and classy feel to the role even as she teases and competes with Clark.  She later did a cameo on Lois and Clark, playing Lois' mother, and quipped that the new Lois gets to wear much sexier outfits than the up the neck suits that she had to wear.

Jack Larson, of course, is the epitome of Jimmy Olsen.  Good natured, and helpful to a fault; he's always in need of being rescued, and he's funny and down to earth with a great bowtie to boot. When the series ended, he couldn't get a decent role- he was marked as Jimmy Olsen for life.  So, he retired young from acting and became a writer, successful at plays and operas.

Veteran actor, John Hamilton barks and bullies, and I've yet to see a Perry White to top him.  Robert Shayne, another veteran, is true blue as the police detective.

The special features include several good discussions from historians including Leonard Maltin and from Jack Larson;  The 1951 movie Superman and the Mole Men(Got to love that title!); a short with George Reeves and some classic Kellogg commercials.  The 5 discs fold out in a nice case with credit summary for writer and director, a synopsis and photos.  It's a good package.

Many, in this day and age, will find the whole thing subpar and hoakie.  Myself?  Step out of 21st century reality, step into some kid slippers, grab a chocolate milk and some peanut butter on toast and enjoy these low budget, minimal special effects- they did what they could- fairly well edited, especially, for such a short timeslot, with crime noir edginess, B&W super hero show.

My kids ask me, ""What's that whistling sound?""  Easy.  ""That's Superman flying again!""",1412380800,,3139,4.632911392405063

He was supposedly not happy with the idea of portraying a comic book character on television..after all, he was a movie actor, and in those days working on t.v was a step down the ladder of success, not up. But George, being the pro he was, knew this job was better than no job, and he still gave it his best, just as if he were playing the most important role he would ever get. And what is he best remembered for? This one. George Reeves made a great Superman and a wonderful Clark. He inhabits the role like no one ever has before or since. His Clark and Superman are both intelligent, brave, and caring. The production was done on a slim budget even for the Fifties, but the work in my opinion is still top notch. The transfers are from the original film elements and while not completely restored, the picture is still better than a lot of other classic t.v releases I've seen.

2361190,5,B000A5046K,"I was pleased to see the first season of the ""Adventures of Superman"" come down in price, and I was excited when my order came in a day earlier than expected. I saw only one episode of this landmark television series when it was new, and I used to walk to the other side of town (a small town) with a friend when I was in junior high school to watch random episodes of the series on his family's television in the late afternoon (they had two extra channel on early cable which I couldn't pick up with rabbit ears). Decades later, I learned most of the episodes, but not all, had been filmed in color when the series became fodder for the Cable Revolution of the eighties. I'm not unfamiliar with the series, but this is the first chance I've had to see the episodes of the first season in the order in which they were telecast originally. It doesn't bother me that the first season is in black and white either, I expect that from early television shows.

 I've watched ten of the twenty-six episodes now, enough to know I'm delighted with the material itself; I do have one small quibble with the way the navigation links are laid out in that they are so clever that I had to watch several episodes before I got the hang of them. One the other hand, the packaging is rather nice. The episodes I've seen are all crisp and sharp and probably looked better than they did on the television sets of the early fifties; if the stories weren't remastered then they were made from prints that were kept in pristine condition.

 I had seen the initial episode which essentially takes Siegel and Shuster's original two-page ""Superman: Who He Is and How He Came to Be"" feature from Superman #1 and expands it out nicely to include details from George Lowthar's novel from the forties, ""The Last Son of Superman"", and also shows how Clark Kent landed his job at the Daily Planet; that episode is very well done and features some economic storytelling that covers a lot of ground without seeming rushed or forced. I've yet to see a bad episode in Season One, and I find the way the way the action is balanced with humor makes the primitive state of the special effects seem more acceptable (although I still chuckle at how effortlessly Superman bends steel bars which are obviously made from rubber). The stories work on several levels and I have no doubt that my young granddaughters would find them exciting, while they seem like short French Boulevard comedies to my wife and I. I had seen far fewer of the episodes with Phyllis Coates in the past, simply because Season One is the only season in which she was in the cast and I rather like the way she plays Lois Lane. Overall, the casting is well done and I appreciate how an episode like ""The Haunted Lighthouse"" puts the spotlight on Jack Larsen as Jimmy Olsen, and an episode like ""Drums of Death"" features John Hamilton prominently as Perry White. It is hard to imagine anyone who could play the roles of both Superman and Clark Kent better than George Reeves for the small screen. The scripts are quite good and are as accessible to those who know the Superman mythos of the comic books quite well as they are to those who only know Superman from second hand sources. The storylines may be relatively simplistic but they are still capable of doing unexpected things; in ""Drums of Death"" it is obvious that the main villain is a white man in blackface but I didn't expect that to become a plot point nor did I guess which white man it was under the makeup; there are likely other surprises in the episodes I haven't seen yet.

 All in all, I'm quite satisfied with Season One of ""The Adventures of Superman"" and my only real problem is going to be deciding if I want to watch the Theatrical Version of ""Superman and the Mole Men"" which is included as a bonus feature first, or watch it after I've seen the two episodes (""The Unknown People"" parts one and two) which it was edited into for the series; I could certainly have worse problems.",1370649600,,3986,4.468406593406593

I caught it as a kid in syndicated reruns, and it was just as thrilling as the Christopher Reeve movies in my mind, despite the relatively crude special effects. What you're looking at here is the complete first season, and in my opinion, it's the best season of AOS. It has a real Film Noir feel that the other seasons lack.(Black and White helps, later episodes were Color) Highlights include Superman's origin in ""Superman on Earth"", ""The Human Bomb"", ""The Birthday Letter"",and ""Crime Wave""- an episode mostly cobbled from stock footage, not that I knew that as a kid.

The quality of the film and episodes is also outstanding - the digital remastering has been expert, to say the least. For all those Baby Boomers out there - I would be very surprised if you didn't absolutely love this set - to say nothing about the hunky Georges Reeves! Bring on Series 2.

This episode is better than most except for the time Superman lost his memory temporarily after colliding with that asteroid.
 I think this episode shows that Superman still doesn't believe in killing even though the gangsters got a hold of his costume. He placed them in exile until someone slipped off a rock....
It is Superman that makes him SUPER and not the costume, but don't YOU just wish you could have the real costume in your very possession? After all, it still had the same super qualities as Superman because of the material was made from Krypton.

I would probably worship the thing if I could and make a special closet with a secret access switch to keep my secret Superman costume so others could find it long after I was gone. (I just bought a very nice Superman Pendant off Ebay and it was the best one I've seen yet.)

Anyway, I only wish ALL the episodes were all in living color. It makes it more real....When I get enough money, I will purchase ALL the episodes or buy each season on Amazon.com. It's only about $1.99 each.

Some episodes are better than others, and many seem to end suddenly without a real resolution or explanation what happened. Also, they end up in the same cave in over half of the episodes. Lois is a real bitch and she is extremely stupid, however, she looks pretty hot and looks like she has a hot body under those clothes. Jimmy seems to get knocked out every episode.

The picture quality is outstanding on all episodes except The Stolen Costume, which is an unusual episode and a fan favorite.

A couple episodes come with audio commentary from Gary H. Grossman and a couple with commentary by Chuck Harter. Oddly, both claim that you are seeing City Hall when they show the Daily Planets exterior. If you are from Los Angeles (which both supposedly are) you know that isn't City Hall, it is the E. Clem Wilson Building.

The special features disc is mostly worthless. Not too much interesting on it, other than seeing George Reeves in the short film Pony Express Days. The film is pointless, the only thing that is interesting is seeing George in a non-Superman Role. The Technicolor does look really cool though.

When watching most of the episodes it feels like you're watching a serious 1940's/50's cop action drama rather than ""Superman"". There are 26 episodes, and only two episodes disappointed me. The first episode ""Superman on Earth"" disappointed me because it's just setting up the series. Most of the episode was about Clark Kent growing up and we only see Superman for a few seconds towards the end of the episode and that's it. I also was very bored with ""The Birthday Letter"". But other than those two episodes, all of the others were just great and deserve five stars. The best episodes were possibly the last few. I loved ""Crime Wave"" and ""The Unknown People (aka: Superman and the Mole-Men); the best episodes out of them all. Oh, and ""Mystery in Wax"" was another good one.

At this time, Nick-at-Nite showed so many great programs, such as ""I Love Lucy,"" ""Bewitched,"" ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."" Of course, this is also where I discovered, and fell in love with, ""The Adventures of Superman."" The fun and excitement of seeing the Man of Steel defeat the bad guys and win the day still brings a warm feeling, as the character is supposed to. Now, I've been able to relive my childhood thanks to the release of ""Adventures of Superman"" on DVD! The First Season of the show is an exciting blend of comic-book fantasy and mystery thriller, shot in a film-noir style similar to the popular crime films of the day. The combination of excellent writing, stellar performances and high production values made this a show accessible to child and adult alike.
The highlights of the first season include: ""Superman on Earth,"" a slightly-rushed, but still fun look at Superman's origins; ""The Haunted Lighthouse,"" where Superman uncovers a sinister scheme on an isolated island where Jimmy Olsen was visiting family; ""The Birthday Letter"" (My personal favorite), where a girl's plea for Superman to take her to the fair becomes a race to find her after being captured (With one of the most heartwarming moments of the show, where Superman flies the little girl around); ""The Stolen Costume,"" where a burglar steals Superman's outfit; ""Crime Wave,"" where Superman takes on organized crime in Metropolis with the aid of the police; and the two-part episode ""The Unknown People"" an edit of the feature film ""Superman and the Mole Men,"" where mysterious beings from beneath the surface of the earth cause panic in the streets despite not being hostile.
As with all shows, there are one or two uneven episodes, but it is still a thrilling beginning to the much-loved series.

2361313,5,B000A5046K,"Since the movie of Superman and the Mole Men is packaged with this, I'll be doing a double review.

First the movie: For only being an hour and on a very low budget, this is a very entertaining film. It's more enjoyable than the Pryor Superman III, the overly long Superman Returns and, sad to say for me as I am a proud defender, Superman IV. George Reeves is my favorite Superman/Clark Kent, not that Christopher Reeve didn't do a good job it's just that I hate that he portrays Clark as a bumbling idiot. Reeves' Kent is smart, quick witted and able to hold his own ground against criminals. His, along with Reeve's, interpretation make me feel proud to be an American and be patriotic. It's mystifying that they didn't remove the whole bit of ""Truth, Justice and the American Way"" and make it feel like Superman Returns when Perry White says ""Does he still stand for Truth, Justice...all that stuff?"" But I digress. Anyway, Phyllis Coates' Lois Lane also is probably my favorite out of the live action portrayals. Her interpretation of the character is strong, considering this was done in the fifties, and she hardly needs to be saved at all in this movie compared to later versions of the character. The plot is well written, given the probably short time they had to write this. Special effects are to a bare minimum, more than likely because they hadn't worked out how they were going to show him flying. All in all, a very entertaining piece of nostalgic Superman history.

The show I also have nothing but praise for. Reeves and Coates have an abundance of chemistry. John Hamilton is my favorite Perry White because they actually give the character something to do. Jack Larson's Jimmy White is also a favorite and his portrayal is not as annoying as what future actors to play the part would do. The stories are, like the movie, well written and thought out. Quality storytelling, that unfortunately wouldn't last the entire series run (mainly seasons 3 and 4), with interesting villains that didn't have some piece of Kryptonite lying around (Kryptonite wouldn't even be used until season 2 and only play a minor role, at that, as a plot device throughout the series' run). The flying scenes are probably some of the best special effects for television that I've seen, not as a retrospective for how far we've come, but its just the way Reeves takes off and lands for the flying that seem more believeable than just being lifted off with wires. A very entertaining series that won't fail to entertain.",1247788800,2,2514,4.698412698412699
2361314,5,B000A5046K,"We all now the saying It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman! Thanks to Warner Studios we can repeat that saying over and over with this release of season one on DVD. This is the first and only ""Superman"" in my opinion and George Reeves will always be my favorite man of steel. I have nothing bad to say about the others who portrayed ""Superman"" I just liked George the best. While working as the mild-mannered reporter for the Metropolis Daily Planet News , ""Superman"" disguised as Clark Kent keeps a watchful eye on the citizens of Metropolis. Join the man of steel as he uses his special powers to battle the forces of evil in the pursuit of truth and justice for all. Warner has done a decent job with the first season, providing all 26 season one episodes spread out over 5 single sided discs with nice artwork and packaging. The video and sound quality varies from episode to episode as the episodes do contain dirt, debris and scratches, especially in the stock footage segments. I had read that initially this release contained defective discs; fortunately I haven't encountered any problems with my set.

2361316,4,B000A5046K,"The First Season of The Adventures of Superman, is the best of the Adventures of Superman series.
  For fans of Superman serials, this series was a major breakthrough in technology.  In the earlier serials, the producers neither had the technology nor the budget to make Superman fly, so they used animation (and poor animation at that) for the flight sequences. In contrast, even by today's standards, Superman's flight in the opening sequence looks remarkably real.
  The plots reflect the issues and concerns of the 1950's time period. For example, in ""The Stolen Costume"", Russian spies steal Superman's suit and a troubled Clark Kent struggles to explain to his insurance agent that he was the victim of a theft without actually telling what was stolen.  In another episode, another foreign agent tries to get Superman to reveal his identity through the use of drugs.
  The first season was filmed in black and white and makes excellent use of the ""film noir"" technique (known for adding a downbeat, yet melodramatic feel to the shows).
  Another one of my favorites is ""Mystery in Wax"", where an evil fortune teller predicts death, but actually kidnaps the unfortunate victims instead. ""Crime Wave"" is also a favorite, done in a classic newsreel style which was also popular during the 1950's.
  I also like the extras, which adds an excellent narration to key episodes.  The narrations in the other seasons lack the detail of those in the first season.
  There are only two shortcomings. First, although the quality of the shows are much better than I remember on my old black and white TV, I believe the remastering could have been better. Second, I would have liked to see more extras tying this season, to the mood of this country during the time period in which it was filmed.  Not many people today realize that this season was filmed during the McCarthy era, where many writers and performers were blacklisted, mostly due to perceived ties to communism. This was one of the reasons why ""Truth, Justice, and THE AMERICAN WAY"" were emphasized in each episode.
  this collection would make an excellent addition to any DVD library.",1230076800,,2141,4.9164345403899725

2361322,5,B000A5046K,"`The Adventures of Superman' (TAS) was made under difficult circumstances: almost no time, almost no money, and no CGI.  Yet three things make TAS a timeless classic:

1) The recurring cast members were all superb, especially George Reeves as Superman.  Reeves played the part with just the right combination of intelligence, righteousness, manliness, and, when necessary, gentleness.  A WWII vet and former boxer, Reeves had a physical presence that implied strength and power.  Reeves never played Clark Kent as a sissy or klutz, and within the framework of the show this approach worked well.  Reeves is to Superman as Errol Flynn is to Robin Hood, as Sean Connery is 007.
2) Tight, disciplined stories.  Every episode has some kind of hook early on, and each one has some element of suspense to keep you involved.
3) Good to excellent directing and cinematography.  Every episode is at least competently done, and some work marvelously.

There is a widespread concensus among fans that the 1st two seasons of TAS are the best, due to their being less whimsical than the remaining 4 seasons, and due to their being shot in crisp black and white.  The B/W episodes tend to resemble film noir, which has the effect of making these shows seem somehow more realistic than the color episodes.

There is considerable debate as to whether the 1st season or the 2nd season is actually the best.  In season 1, Lois Lane was played by Phyllis Coates, a good actress who somehow got stuck doing exclusively B movies.  Her Lois is a little edgier and tougher than then Noel Niell, who played Lois in the rest of the 6 seasons, as well as playing Lois in the 2 Columbia pictures movie serials.  Fans who prefer Phyllis Coates' Lois will give an edge to Season 1.

A deeper difference is that Season 1's stories are a little more hard-boiled, with more guns being fired and more people getting shot and/or killed.  The decision to tone-down the violence probably had something to do with the fact that the Kelloggs cereal company had assumed sponsorship of the program, and due to the Senator Estes Kefauver crusade against violence in comic books.

Season 1 was produced by Bob Maxwell, who had produced the Superman radio show, which ended production in 1950. 1950 was also the year that the serial 'Atom Man Vs. Superman' was produced, but it is so different from this series that 'Atom Man' might as well have been made in 1920.

Violence is a major element in the best Season 1 episode, `The Stolen Costume.'  This episode also provides the most nuanced or perhaps even ambivalent portrayal of Superman in the entire series.  An interesting piece of trivia in this story is the appearance of Kent's private detective friend Candy Meyer; Candy Meyer was a recurring character in the radio series, but this is his only appearance on TV. `The Stolen Costume' is one of the two greatest episodes in the whole series, the other being `Panic in the Sky' from Season 2.

Another bit of esoterica: in Episode 1, 'Superman on Earth,' Jor-El and some of the Kryptonians wear the Martian pilot uniforms from the 1938 serial, 'Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars.'  One of those suits could have been the suit Buster Crabbe wore!

Even more esoteric: Also from 'Superman on Earth,' a member of the Kryptonian science counsel is wearing a Captain Marvel shirt from the classic 1941 serial, 'Adventures of Captain Marvel.'  There is an oversized collar added to the shirt, but to anyone who has seen Captain Marvel, the shirt is unmistakable.  Interestingly, the shirt is worn by Jorel's adversary (the guy with the pencil mustache).  Considering DC Comics' attitude toward Capt. Marvel at the time of production, this is possibly an obscure 'In' joke.

One very interesting feature with this set is the inclusion of the original theatrical version of the `Superman & the Mole Men,' which the producers filmed immediately prior to work on weekly series (this film was released into theaters so as to insure that the producers recouped at least some of their investment in the TV show: at the time season 1 was filmed, there wasn't a sponsor yet!).

Besides being enjoyable as an atmospheric and suspenseful B/W cold war scifi/horror pic (a la the original `The Thing'), this little film is interesting since it engages in a little social commentary.  Almost without exception, TAS never touched any of the burning social issues (bigotry, war, pollution, etc.), but `Superman & the Mole Men' is, very obviously, an allegory about prejudice.  This makes it a kind of bridge between the Superman radio show, which, starting after WWII, did a long series of award-winning social message programs, which directly addressed issues such as prejudice, war-mongering, and social welfare, and TAS, which stayed completely clear of social relevancy.

`Superman & the Mole Men,' is the story of about some funny-looking little men who emerge into view after the world's deepest oil well is dug.  The funny-looking men, who are not evil and whose world has been invaded by oil explorers, become victims of prejudice and eventually a mob forms with the intent of killing them.  If you think about it, this might remind you of a contemporary real-life situation.

These DVD collections are an excellent value.  Twenty six episodes per box makes almost 11 hours of pure show, plus the featurettes and audio commentary are not bad either.

We had such a good time watching favorite episodes. I am a child of the 50's and grew up with Superman while it was still fairly new. My son experienced it on Nick at Nite re-runs, a special time for us both.

Now I have purchased the Season Two set, and the episodes here may be in many ways better than those in the first. A particular favorite is ""Panic in the Sky,"" where our hero has to deflect a meteor as it hurtles towards Earth. Special flying sequences were filmed for this episode that were not used in any other.

A special treat is ""Stamp Day for Superman,"" a special episode that I never saw as a child. While it is a quickie ""freebie"" made to support the U.S. Treasury Dept., this episode stands up pretty well with the ""regular"" episodes.

The featurette ""First Lady of Metropolis"" is a wonderful tribute to Noel Neill, who took over the role of Lois when Phyllis Coates was unable to continue. It is so nice to see Ms. Neill still looking lovely. She still has the ""sparkle"" in her eyes that made her Lois so enjoyable to watch.

Another favorite episode is ""Around the World with Superman."" Anyone who is not moved by this story of a blind girl's attempt to re-unite her troubled family just doesn't have a heart.

2361353,5,B000A5046K,"I currently own all four dvd voulmes of ""The Adventures of Superman"". I find that I watch season one more often than the others. There's good reason for this. Alot of tv shows are weakest in their first season due to little character development and weak stories (""The Simpsons"" and ""Seinfeld"" come to mind) TAOS was an exception to this. Season one starts with a bang, and does not let up. It is without a doubt the best season of the show, and makes it a ""must-have"" for any Superman fan. Eveything clicks in these early episodes. The stories are extremely well written crime dramas, shot in a ""film-noir"" style...black and white, urban-based, with great backround music to heighten the drama. These early stories are much more real in feel than the later color episodes that have a more cartoonish feel to them. The characters here react as people in real life would, with anger,(Perry White in ""Czar of the underworld"", and panic...Clark Kent in ""The Stolen Costume"") In addition to the great writing, is a stellar cast. George Reeves is great here. He is in better physical shape in these episodes and is noticibly slimmer and younger looking. Reeves was a great actor who gives it his all in these episodes (by the time the series went to color, Reeves had put on weight and seemed ""bored"".) As mentioned in other reviews, Reeves' Kent is superb. An intelligent, hard-nosed reporter, who is rivaled only by Lois Lane, here played by Phyllis Coates, who, in my opinion , was far superior to her replacement, Noel Neil.

 I could go on, but trust me...these episodes are great, playing like 30-minute mini- movies. They stand on their own (unlike the color episodes, which  have a more ""generic"" feel to them. The best episodes of season one:

1. ""The Stolen Costume""

2. ""The Haunted Lighthouse""

3. ""Mystey in Wax""

4.  ""Czar of the Underworld""

5. ""Night of Terror""

6. ""The Unknown people"" (edited from ""Superman and the Mole-Men"", but better, due to the inclusion of the series background music)

2361381,5,B000A5046K,"FIRST THOUGHTS - I NEVER MISSED THIS SHOW WHEN IT WAS ON T.V. IN THE 1950s!

The first season is really different from the others, as Phyllis Coates as Lois Lane gives these first episodes more of an appeal to adults and older kids. Of course, when this DVD Set came in the mail I had a Superman marathon which meant I played all the episodes round the clock. Yes, this series is that good, and especially this first season, which I recall well, although I had not seen the episodes for decades.

Of course I still get a chill during the introduction as the announcer zips through the usual discourse of: ""faster than a speeding bullet"", ""more powerful than a locomotive"", ""able to leap tall buildings in a single bound"", ""can change the course of mighty rivers"" etc.!

ABOUT THE FIRST SEASON: Phyllis Coates as Lois Lane just can't stay out of trouble! She really had a nack for getting into trouble and she behaved like a very independent woman. Only a super-man could keep this Lois Lane out of trouble!

Without giving too much away about the plots, this first season is filled with mystery adventures and, as others have pointed out, has a film-noir quality that is hard to miss. Phyllis Coates as Lois Lane is rather over-the-top but she has always been my favorite Lois, perhaps because I saw her in that role first. George Reeves *is* Superman, make no mistake about it, as he plays the role without overdoing the hapless Clark Kent role. In fact, he plays a rather strong and emotional Clark Kent which is nice to see and fits the role quite well.

ABOUT THE DVDs: Excellent transfer, Features, Value!

A fantastic transfer of a 55-year-old TV show is too good to be true, but true it is. The episodes appear to be uncut, as the lengths run about 25 minutes and some seconds which is consistent with their original running times. There is commentary for a few of the episodes, but frankly I have been too anxious to see all the episodes a few times first. The package is nice too! Subtitles are available in English, French, and Spanish.

A LITTLE ABOUT THE SPECIAL FEATURES:

RETROSPECTIVE DOCUMENTARY - Made in 2005 and runs about 18 minutes. Includes footage from most of the first year's episodes and interviews with Leonard Maltin and an nicely-aged Jack Larson [Jimmy Olson].

*COMMENTARY ON 4 EPISODES [2 by Gary Grossman - 2 by Chuck Harter]

*ORIGINAL KELLOGG'S CEREAL COMMERCIALS

*PONY EXPRESS DAYS: ""VINTAGE WARNER BROTHERS HISTORICAL SHORT"", Starring George Reeves

*THE 2 PART EPISODE, ""The Unknown People"", which had been theatrically released earlier as ""The Mole Men"", is included as well.

RECOMMENDED: SEASON TWO, PLUS SEASON THREE/FOUR, which has just been released in one DVD set. I will be getting that one this month, as I pre-ordered it from Amazon in March! The 3rd and 4th season set has many of my favorite episodes, [eg. ""The Big Chill""] and both years are within 1 DVD boxed set as they made only half as many episodes during the third and fourth seasons as the previous two. Although color TVs did not exist 50 years ago, the shows from these later seasons were shot in color, unlike the first two seasons, giving them a warmer, and more modern look when seen today on color TVs.",1150329600,6,4055,4.76978417266187
2361382,5,B000A5046K,"What a hoot!! I loved it. I watched this television series as a little kid but the stories in this first season were so old (almost 55 years ago!), I didn't remember more than a few scenes, although they sure brought back memories.

The special effects and the credibility (picking a scene apart) were beyond bad. Apparently, they had an extremely cheap budget so you'd see the same scene over and over in various episodes. I could write volumes on all the ludicrous scenes that made no sense but that's what helps make this so entertaining. It's so bad, it's good! I don't want to sound like I am criticizing this because I thoroughly enjoyed it and  am almost finished with the second season DVD, which also is excellent.

It was especially fun to see the first show, the TV version of the origins of Superman. Then, as the episodes continued, to hear the innocence of a young Jimmy Olsen saying, ""Jeepers, Mr. Kent,"" ""Golly, gee whiz"" and other similar exclamations. I laugh every time I hear those. Wow, compare that to today's TV.

Phyllis Coates was good as Lois Lane. It's too bad she left after one year. I'd rate her a slightly better Lane than Noel Neill, but Noel was good, too. Lois and Jimmy, with their nosiness, naivet? and just plain stupidity would have to be bailed out by Superman show after show.

Even though the first season didn't compare to the following seasons in special effects and lack of color, it had something the other seasons did not. The scripts were good and well directed; they were actually written for mature audiences, even though kids loved it. (TV Guide back then listed the show as ""mystery"", not ""children""!)  Many involved with the season that first year were veterans of 40's movies, particularly film noir.  The plots, acting and direction were so good that you actually felt that you really were seeing great special effects.  I can actually remember that as as kid, when I was watching the first runs episodes of later seasons, I would actually perk up when they showed a rerun from the first season.  We appreciated the difference in production quality even back then.  Everything about the first season production was terrific.  I have always felt that Phyllis Coates was the ""official"" Lois Lane, but then that may only be because Noel Neill never had the benefit of the crew that had been assembled for the first season.  (And also the insistence by the TV brass that the so-called violence ot the first season be toned down.)

The scene of the townspeople subsequentially trying to beat Superman up was definitely not out of any kiddie program guide I know of.

I was disappointed, however, with the running commentary to some of the shows. Too many repetitive comments on ""how I felt as a kid turning on the Adventures of Superman"" or ""Doesn't George Reeves look great in this shot?"", not enough commentary on the relation of the shows to the contempory American society. Is the episode in which Lois Lane testifies before a government committee analogous to the Estes commission of that day? Was the "". . . and the American way"" flag-waving intro an explicit attempt to establish an anti-communist position or just the cultural naivete of the day?

2361417,5,B000A5046K,"Finally... the one and only TRUE Superman that so many of us old folks grew up with has made it to DVD!

The first season was truly the best. Phlylis Coates was the ultimate Lois Lane- Agressive, smart, and clever, wich may have scared the show's producers and sponsors (strong, capible women weren't in vouge in the 50's) into replacing her in future seasons with the more docile, passive Noel Neil.

The first season was also darker and grittier than later seasons, aimed at more of an ""Adult"" audience. This may also explain the changes in later seasons that aimed the show specificlly to kids. Kellog's Sugar Frosted Flakes was the primary sponsor for a while, and maybe that had something to do with the show's latter changes.

However, if you want to see the REAL Superman, as portrayed in the comics of the day, or the Dave Flicher classic Superman cartoons, this is the boxed set to get. Some people may not cotten to the black and white format, and the quality of the prints, wich really show thier age.  However, if you can get past that, this is truly a bit of television history worth owning.  George Reeves litterally shines here, at a time where he was untouched by the tragic events that happened later in his life. A true Superman, indeed!",1137888000,16,1255,4.584821428571429
2361418,5,B000A5046K,"OK...let me preface my remarks with the admission that, at age 53, I am a lifelong Superman fanatic.  Not only do I own all four Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movies, but I also own the two Kirk Alyn serials from the 40's.  So it was with great anticipation that I awaited the inevitable release of the memorable George Reeves TV series of the 50's.  And now Season One is here, and there is something in it for young and old alike, for those fully steeped in Superman lore, and for those youngsters who only know him from current cartoons or perhaps from WB's Smallville.

The first thing that all but the youngest viewers will realize is that this Clark Kent is not the weakling we have come to expect, hiding behind a timid persona to throw off any suspicion that he might be the Man of Steel.  Rather, George Reeves played his Clark as an almost macho, man's man.  He might make lame excuses to cover his frequent absences, but there is no missing the fact that this Clark could take care of himself in almost any situation.  Also surprising is the fact that these early Season One scripts are actually darned good.  In keeping with Reeves' more assertive Clark and Phyllis Coates' almost abrasive Lois Lane, many of the episodes have an almost film noir feel to them, with actual mysteries and a creepiness that was thought, only one season later, to be inappropriate for the show's primary audience of children.

The down side, of course, is the cheesiness of some of the production values, the obvious bloopers and the fact that, in its early day and limited budget, the special effects leave more than just something to be desired.  In these early days Superman's powers seemed to be limited to just flying, superstrength and a sort of ""selective"" invulnerability  whereby Superman stood there and let bullets bounce off his chest, but one second later ducked when the out-of-bullets bad guy threw the gun at his head in fear or frustration.  Similarly, after one or two episodes adult eyes will easily pick up the scenes where a stunt man (who looked NOTHING like Reeves) would be cut into and then out of an action sequence.  Adult ears will also pick up the unmistakable voice of John Hamilton, the show's regular ""Perry White,"" helping to save on production costs by donning a moustache and darker hair and playing a number of inconsequential supporting characters.

But this classic nonetheless has aged extremely well.  From the familiar opening sequences to the invariable scenes where Superman ultimately triumphs, the series has lost none of its luster.  Reeves captured not only the character of Superman perfectly, but he also captured the sense of the time in which the series was filmed.  While Tom Welling and Brandon Roth may each capture the Superman of the early 21st Century, full of doubts, uncertainties and personal considerations that clash with his destiny, George Reeves embodied the can-do attitude of Post-war America, a time when there was a clear line between right and wrong, where justice was easily dispensed, and where a hero knew instinctively what he had to do.  For adults who fondly remember the series, and for parents who would like to introduce their kids to wholesome, entertaining fare, this First Season collection is simply Super.",1137801600,28,3280,4.837209302325581

But while listening to the commentary for the Haunted Lighthouse, I couldn't believe my ears. Gary Grossman, who I thought was an expert on Superman, states that the LA City Hall served as the Daily Planet building during the first season. No way, no how!! The first season Daily Planet is a building at the corner of LaBrea and Wilshire. I know, I was there in October taking pictures.  Two blocks east on Wilshire is the Carnation Building, whose entrance was used by the Planet staff in episodes like Superman on Earth and Crime Wave.

Phyllis Coates is great, spunky, tough, and yes, an Olympic-quality screamer, but the differences between the actresses are also a function of script and direction.  Noel was a different, but equally great Lois.  More flirtatious, bratty, obnoxious, and meddlesome than her predecessor, Noel played to a 1950's boy's ambivalent fascination with young girls.  The first season may have been the greatest for Superman as a series, but as for the Loises (as Fred Astaire once said of his various dance partners), they were all divine.",1135036800,6,1183,4.979695431472082

2361436,5,B000A5046K,"I've always gotten razzed when I say that George Reeves was the greatest 'Superman'. After all, Christopher Reeve was closest to the comic book, Dean Cain introduced a level of sexiness to the character, and Tom Welling is the current teen heartthrob; the general impression of Reeves was as the chubby, aging, 'long johns'-clad Superman, from the silly color TV episodes of the late 50s, who ""killed himself"" when the series ended.

The new DVD ""Adventures of Superman - Complete First Season"" should put that impression to rest!

Filmed in B&W, in 1951, the youthful, 37-year old Reeves offered a 'Man of Steel' of compassion, integrity, and honor, with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile for the TV audiences who shared his 'secret'. Far more charismatic than his movie serial predecessor, Kirk Alyn, he was as quick to use his head and his fists as his ""Powers and Abilities' to defend ""Truth, Justice, and the American Way"" against gangsters, spies, and evildoers. While some may quibble that his 'Clark Kent' was TOO heroic, and similar to his costumed alter ego, he was an unabashed role model for a generation of young viewers, and he never let us down, during the 'Superman' years, either on screen, or off.

The first season episodes are, perhaps, the best of the series, produced by veterans of the B-movie industry who knew how to make action-packed stories quickly, and cinematically. The plots are rich in film noir touches (""The Haunted Lighthouse"" is so atmospheric that it could stand beside many of the noir dramas of the 40s), and offer, for the first time, believable flying effects (achieved, in large part, by double-exposing film of Reeves hanging by wire and harness, attached to a body-contoured 'flying pan', worn under his suit, with moving aerial shots). The episodes were never 'dumbed down' for kids; while some characters were played for laughs, the stories were serious, the violence real. These shows were not produced for children, they were made for the same audiences who loved adventure stories in movie theaters (it would take self-appointed committees to decide children weren't fit for such things, and force the series into complying, in later seasons).

Joining Reeves in the cast were 24-year-old Phyllis Coates as a spirited Lois Lane far ahead of her time; John Hamilton, 65, a veteran character actor for nearly 50 years, as crusty editor Perry White; B-movie vet Robert Shayne, 50, as Kent's friend, Police Inspector Henderson, and, best of all, 18-year old Jack Larson as a tousled-haired, naive Jimmy Olsen.

But, ultimately, the season (and the series) owed it's success to George Reeves, who appeared in every episode, and worked tirelessly to bring the Last Son of Krypton to life. As the syndicated series reached more and more markets (as TV stations began to spread across the nation), his performance, and the series, became national sensations, giving him the success that had eluded him in twelve years of acting, but also forever 'typing' him in a role that would cost him his career, and possibly his life.

""The Adventures of Superman"" would be his legacy, and this fabulous collection might have you joining me in celebrating the BEST Superman of them all!",1131580800,96,3222,4.968460111317254

Watching this classic on DVD brought me instantly back to those times.  George Reeves will always be Superman for me.  Although Christopher Reeve is imprinted for me as well, it will always be George.

I gave this set a solid 4 rating.  4.5 really, but just because the Video quality is a little bit off on a few of the episodes, I feel that an honest 4 is really what this deserves.  That said, the DVD set is great.  I had no problems with the set at all and the quality (while not superb) is certainly as good as can be expected with a T.V. show this old.  We have to remember that some of this material is just not saved the way it is today and that we are lucky to have this at all.. let alone hope for a pristine transfer.

Some day maybe if there is enough demand, the prints might get a makeover like was done for the Wizard of Oz.  That's a huge undertaking though and may not be cost effective.

The only small gripe I have is with the quality of some of the ""bonus features.""  The ""Inkwell to Backlot"" documentary is a disappointment, and the ""expert commentaries"" contained on several episodes are absolutely lame -- they are repetitive, uninformative, contradictory, and sometimes surprisingly unhelpful. (One example: the commentator on ""The Stolen Costume"" wonders why Clark wasn't wearing his Superman costume that day -- despite the fact that early in the show Clark himself mentions that he had to go to the doctor for a company physical. The commentator should realize that this line of dialogue contains the explanation -- Clark would have to undress for the doctor, which is why he left his costume home that day.)

In viewing the release of this first installment of the Adventures of Superman, one notices how the episodes were action packed & nicely written-you didn't get much filler in the 25 minutes allotted. But most importantly, you got George Reeves, who was far and away, the best Superman ever. I remember watching this show as a kid, and I was in awe of this guy. His portrayal of the Man of Steel was right on the money--making the character of Superman an extraordinary, larger than life, iconic figure.

2361456,5,B000A5046K,"""Adventures Of Superman"" premiered in American living rooms on Friday, September 19th, 1952 (when the first episode aired on Chicago's WENR-TV), and continued for a total of six TV seasons. 104 episodes of the series were produced and aired (via syndication), with all 26 black-and-white episodes of the series' first season represented within this classy-looking 5-Disc DVD boxed set that was released by Warner Home Video on October 18, 2005.

The scripts for ""Superman"" offer up a rather fun blend of fantasy, suspense, action-adventure, and noir-like crime-drama. Plus quite a bit of comedy, to boot (both the intentional and unintentional varieties of humor).

Nearly all of the above elements can be detected in the series right from the get-go in the debut episode ""Superman On Earth"" (which is one of my favorites from this batch of first-year episodes). ""Superman On Earth"" is a great pilot episode to launch the series, IMO. Within this single 26-minute program, the whole ""Superman"" backstory plays out -- beginning with planet Krypton's doomed fate, to Superman's arrival on Earth as an infant (via a prototype planet-hopping spaceship constructed by his father, Jor-El), and continuing with the story of mild-mannered Clark Kent's first exciting day on the job as a ""Daily Planet"" newspaper reporter.

When I watch the pilot episode, I'm always impressed by the amount of material and plot points that are covered in just this initial installment of the series. And it never really feels like the writers are ""rushing"" to tell us the story. It seems to evolve in a well-paced manner. I think it's an exemplary beginning to the series, and sets the tone just right for future ""Superman"" episodes.

There's a bit of unintended humor in that first episode as well, to be sure. It's difficult not to burst out laughing during a few portions of the ""Krypton"" scenes ... e.g.: when Jor-El states to Krypton's ruling Government leaders that he intends to build a fleet of spaceships to transport the entire planet's population off of the doomed planet -- and he, evidently, intends to accomplish this massive construction feat in just a matter of ""days, or even perhaps hours"" (which is the amount of time he says remains until the planet is likely to explode into millions of pieces). Holy Smokes! He'd better get a move-on then! LOL!

Plus: I kind of like the humorous angle provided in the pilot as a result of the real age of actor George Reeves (""Superman""). Reeves is supposed to be 25 years old during his ""adult"" scenes in the first episode (perhaps close to 26). Mr. Reeves' real age, however, was 37 at the time. :-)

But those parts of the pilot show, and other episodes in the series, that bring forth a chuckle or two are also part of the reason I like to watch ""Superman"". It's an entertaining TV show, unintended humor and all.

A First-Show ""Did You Know?"" Trivia Break --- Did you know that the actor who portrayed the very first person ever rescued by the amazing high-flying antics of ""Superman""  was Dabbs Greer? .... Yep, it was good ol' Dabbs alright. Dabbs, a veteran of literally hundreds of TV bit parts dating back to the early 1950s, was falling through the sky to a certain death in the final act of the pilot episode, when the caped super hero caught him in mid-air. For some reason, though, Greer doesn't get a screen credit for his part in the pilot show, despite the fact he has several lines to read at the tail-end of that program.

Another oddity re. that premiere episode's closing credits is the fact that Ross Elliott, another soon-to-be-veteran character actor who popped up in a great number of TV series in the '50s and '60s (like Greer), gets an on-screen credit for ""Superman On Earth"", even though his scenes were totally cut out of the show and he doesn't appear in the episode at all. It makes me wonder if Greer was a last-minute replacement for Elliott during the filming of the episode's last scene, but the end credits were never corrected. ~strokes chin and ponders~

It sure looks to me like some degree of restoration effort was put into these DVD transfers. For the most part, I think the video on these discs looks remarkably good, especially for a program that originally was made during the earliest days of television. These first-year Supermans were actually made an entire year before they were ever aired, being filmed between July 23 and October 13 of 1951. The back of the DVD box claims that these episodes were ""digitally mastered from original film elements"". Sounds good to me. :)

I was especially impressed by the clarity of the opening titles, which is a segment of many TV shows that oft-times looks much worse on DVD than the 'body' of the episodes. But in this set, the Main Titles look excellent. Just check out the close-up of the revolver when it turns sideways during the show opening (as we hear the famous voice-over, ""Faster than a speeding bullet!""). The gun is crystal-clear here.

I think, however, that just a single (nicely cleaned-up) opening sequence was used for these DVDs and repeated for all of the episodes in this collection. This becomes quite noticeable in Episode #13, ""The Stolen Costume"", which features rather subpar video quality for the episode itself, with lots of dirt specks dancing around the screen (although it was quite possibly the best print WB had to work with when it came to transferring this ep. to DVD), but the opening titles still look very clean and clear.

I, myself, haven't really noticed any major edits or essential footage missing from these episodes. Run times that I've made a point to check clocked in at a healthy 25 to 26 minutes each. As an example, I checked every episode's precise running time on Disc #1, and here are the results of those ""time checks"":

""Superman On Earth"" -- Run Time: 25:52.
""The Haunted Lighthouse"" -- 25:53.
""The Case Of The Talkative Dummy"" -- 25:49.
""Mystery Of The Broken Statues"" -- 25:23.
""The Monkey Mystery"" -- 25:24.
""Night Of Terror"" -- 25:55.

So, if any originally-aired footage has been cut out here, it's certainly not very much, that's for sure.

I really like the packaging for this first ""Superman"" DVD set, too. It's colorful, bright, and just plain fun to open up and look at. There's an attractive outer slipcase box that slides easily and smoothly over the interior case.

The five DVDs are placed in a Digipak type of folding case, with an overlapping disc-storing system that is growing in favor with this writer and DVD collector. Many people frown at the sight of the ""stacked"" type of DVD trays, but I'm beginning to like them better all the time. Stacking the discs in this overlapping arrangement within multi-disc sets cuts down on the bulkiness of the overall packaging, reducing the number of Digipak panels required to house all the software. And there's a certain ""eye appeal"" to this type of storage method, too (IMO). Plus, with a stacked arrangement, you don't need a table (or other surface) a half-mile wide in order to uncoil all the panels/flaps of the DVD case.

I've also noticed that the DVD sets I have purchased that feature the overlapping discs also seem to have more user-friendly disc hubs (fasteners), i.e.: it seems to me that the stacked trays feature hubs that will release the discs more easily (without the need of a crowbar, or a stick of dynamite, to pry the darn things free from their clutching plastic homes, as with some non-stacked designs). ;)

When all five discs are removed from their trays, a very pleasant visual packaging treat is revealed -- A picture of Superman (in cartoon form) comes into full view; plus the word ""SUPERMAN"" is spelled out grandly in large colorful letters across two of the Digipak panels (in the familiar ""Superman"" font/style). It's a nice artwork/packaging touch that gives this DVD set more of a ""collectible"" feel to it. It's almost a shame to have to cover up the cool underlying artwork on the case with the discs themselves. ;)

Some pretty nice artwork adorns each of the five DVDs too, with a picture of a cast member on each disc -- e.g.: George Reeves (who occupies space on two of the discs, due to his dual role as both ""Superman"" and ""Clark Kent""), plus Phyllis Coates (""Lois Lane"" during Season 1 of the series), Jack Larson (""Jimmy Olsen""), and John Hamilton (""Perry White"").

Another nifty little packaging touch is located on each of the two spines of the DVD case -- The Warner Brothers' ""WB"" logo has been situated in such a way on the case's spines to make it appear as if the logo itself is serving as Superman's ""belt buckle"". (This could have merely been a coincidence, that the ""WB"" logo lined up to double as the buckle on Superman's belt in the spine photos, but I thought it was kind of cute nonetheless.)

>> The complete 1951 theatrical feature film ""Superman And The Mole Men"" (which was later re-worked into the 2-part, first-season Superman TV episode ""The Unknown People""). ... This is a terrific bonus add-on. Very glad to see this included in this set. ""Mole Men"" isn't exactly ""Citizen Kane"", but it did introduce the world to George Reeves as ""The Man Of Steel"". The B&W ""Mole Men"", which made its theatrical debut on November 23, 1951, is fairly short for a ""feature-length"" motion picture, just 58 minutes long (it took a mere 11 days to shoot). It's presented here in its original Full-Frame video format, with audio in 2.0 Dolby Digital Mono. Excellent picture quality too. I'm amazed at how good this film looks here, in fact. I've certainly never seen it looking as good as it does on this DVD. ... No chaptering or subtitle options are provided for the ""Mole Men"" feature.

>> A 17-minute retrospective documentary entitled ""Adventures Of Superman: From Inkwell To Backlot"". ... Some very good stuff here, including on-camera interviews with ""Jimmy Olsen"" himself (Jack Larson) and movie critic Leonard Maltin. This is a short featurette, but it's jam-packed with show clips and fun information about the Superman TV series and its cast members. ... Audio: Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo.

>> A vintage ""WB short"" called ""Pony Express Days"". ... This 20-minute short film, made in 1940 (and shot in Technicolor) stars a very youthful-looking George Reeves (who was 26 years old when he filmed this entertaining short subject). Reeves was a very busy actor in films early in his career, with his role as ""Bill Cody"" in ""Pony Express Days"" representing his 14th film appearance in less than a two-year period (1939-1940). Included among that 14 is George's role as ""Stuart Tarleton"" in the epic ""Gone With The Wind"". Reeves made appearances in 16 different movies in the year 1940 alone! (Gosh, maybe he really IS ""Superman"". LOL.) ... Tragically, George Reeves (who was born George Keefer Brewer in January 1914) died at a very young age (45), when an apparent suicide took the life of America's first TV ""Superman"", on June 16, 1959 (just a little more than one year after Reeves filmed the last ""Superman"" episode). ... A Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono audio track has been utilized for this ""Pony Express"" bonus. Video is 1.33:1 Full-Frame, and it looks outstanding too. Colors are very well-rendered. This is yet another excellent bonus item that makes this Superman set even a better bargain.

>> 3 Kellogg's cereal commercials that aired in the 1950s during the original run of the ""Superman"" series. ... This is actually kind of a mini-featurette, which includes a short history lesson about the Kellogg's ""Superman"" ads, followed by three complete B&W commercial spots, all for ""Sugar Frosted Flakes"". George Reeves stars in all these ads (as ""Clark Kent"", never as ""Superman""). An early TV version of ""Tony The Tiger"" can be seen in these ads as well. ... Audio for this bonus is a mixture of DD 2.0 Stereo and DD 2.0 Mono (the latter for the actual ads). Picture quality for the commercials is a cut below all the other video on these discs, but still not all that bad. This is fun old-time (and hard-to-find) stuff. ... Total run time of this ""commercial"" bonus is 4:35.

-----------------

So .... If you have a desire to re-live some of the earliest days in TV's history, then this 5-Disc DVD set of ""Adventures Of Superman: The Complete First Season"" should fill that requirement quite nicely. This show is just good, fun television -- brought back to vivid life once again thanks to this well-above-average collection of DVDs from Warner Home Video. A round of applause should go to WB for putting out a product that very nicely preserves and showcases the memories of this prized series from TV's Golden Era.",1130457600,67,14094,4.812655086848635

I believe she and Jack Larson (who does have a commentary piece) are the only living persons related to this great show.  In the past several years, Phyllis and Jack both had separate roles in the ""Lois and Clark"" TV series: Phyllis played Lois' mother in a later episode and Jack played old Jimmy Olsen in the ""Brutal Youth"" episode.  Certainly Ms. Coates must have been asked to contribute to this release, unless she is incapable of it (she is 78 according to IMDB.com).

I have met Noel Neill at the annual Metropolis, Illinois Superman festival, and let me tell you, she is a wonderful person.  She also was a wonderful Lois Lane.  Ms. Coates had the right personality for the first 26 episodes, as they were darker, more serious and more dramatic.  Ms. Neill's lighter personality fit perfectly for the later episodes which added a lighter, more comedic and childish slant to the series.  Ms. Coates would not have fit in as well there.

Of all the DVDs I have purchased, I cherish this one the most.  My only disappointment is the packaging: the disks are not set on ""pop-up"" buttons and require bending and touching to remove.  This is exacerbated by one disc placed partly over another, requiring one to remove the top disc to get to the other one.  This all may increase scratch potential.

Also, why does the packaging call this the complete first season?  To my knowledge, these 26 episodes filmed in 1951 were aired over two seasons: 13 in 1952-53 and 13 in 1953-54.  And I too hope that the next set includes the Kellogg's opening, that season's commercials and the next week's preview.",1130284800,9,1679,4.6440677966101696

From what I've read and seen, the sponsor bumper ""Kellogs, the greatest name in cereals, presents...The Adventures of Superman"", would not come until later seasons.  There was no voice over in season one saying the name of the show. It's obvious in later seasons (especially the color ones) that the opening begins abruptly with the comet exploding into the stylized block letter opening titles...it was seconds before that where the sponsor bumper was.  Considering Kelloggs is still in business today, you'd think they would authorize the use of sponsor bumpers in future reissues as ""free publicity"".

I feel sorry for Noel Neill in a way. Her and Phyllis Coates are both alive, and both are undoubtedly following the user comments about this set.  And every review here is unanimous that Phyllis made the better Lois.  That's gotta sting somewhat.

And adding to the color debate, the first run shows were indeed aired in black and white though they were filmed in color starting with season 3, I believe.  The producers (along with producers of ""The Lucy Show"" in seasons 2 and 3) had the foresight to value the future potential of color.",1130198400,6,1292,4.783783783783784

Specifically, I believe it's Robert Shayne who says ""Look, Up In The Sky,"" and George Reeves who says ""It's a Bird.""  Then an unidentifiable female says ""It's a Plane.""  Maybe this is common knowledge, or maybe I'm way off base, but it sure sounds like them to me.

Many thanks to Warner for releasing the first season of Superman.  However, as others have noted, there are flaws with this.  The biggest problem, of course, is with the Stolen Costume episode.  What bothers me the most is not the condition of the episode, though I know I saw relatively clear prints of this when I was growing up in the 1960s, but rather, the lack of an explanation as to WHY the quality is subpar.  That would have been interesting, and easy, especially since they provided a commentary on that episode anyway.

The second flaw is the missing stuff.  This would be the commercial lead in mid-way through the show, and the Previews that appeared at the end.  Very sad these weren't included.  They would have added a lot to these shows.  Warner should realize this stuff means a lot to us self-indulgent baby boomers.  Still, this is an excellent release.

It brings to mind those days of relative innocence where entertainment could be entertaining without all the explicit sex and dirt so common in television today.  About the only thing I did find disturbing was all the smoking done on the show by the various characters, both good and bad, which was socially acceptable in those days. Watching the episodes I was incredulous that nobody told Perry White that it was wrong to light a cigar in a public.

At least that's one thing we got right nowadays--the stench of burning tobbacco is no longer welcome in public places.",1130025600,3,621,4.785046728971962

Christopher Reeve is an awesome Superman but for those of us who were around before he hit the big screen, their can never be another Superman outside of Geore Reeves.

The series is in order but, as mentioned before, these are the TV prints once the show hit the air as reruns. Most of them have specks and lines and cracks from being viewed so many times but the overall quaility is very good. But when you get to the episode, ""The Stolen Costume"", Warner Brothers drops the ball and lets you down. The episode is faded, streaked up, and just lousy to view.

It is sad that we who spend our good hard earned money on a set that, since it was released buy the studio, should have been transfered from the Master Prints, only got worn out hand me downs. I am sad to say that since this was a let down, I will not give Warner Brothers any more of my money for Season 2 unless they use the original Master Prints and rerelease this set from the Master Prints as well.

If you haven't bought this set yet, dont. Write Warner Brothers and demand they use the Master Prints before you buy this set. You can get a better set off of Ebay that has been copied from TV. If you have bought this set already, do like I have done and contact Warner Brothers and tell them how dissapointed you are and demand the set be re-released from the Mastet Prints.",1130025600,7,1491,4.206293706293707

The actor is the one who is so adamantly opposed to Jor-El's plan of escape from Krypton.

Great DVD!!!",1129939200,10,1053,4.943181818181818
2361479,4,B000A5046K,"I am a mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper (no kidding) and I just wrote a story about this DVD set.

First, the positives: This is the first and best season of the ""Adventures of Superman,"" largely because of George Reeves, the greatest Superman (and Clark Kent) of them all, and Phyllis Coates, the best Lois Lane. The rest of the cast (regulars Jack Larson, John Hamilton and Robert Shayne and various supporting players) was terrific. The show was played straight, with dramatic story lines and hard-hitting action, and was filmed in black and white with a true film noir quality. Not to be overlooked is the score -- not just the classic theme song, but the tense background music as well. These early episodes, filmed in 1951 but not aired until late 1952, were aimed primarily at an adult audience (though kids loved them, too, of course) and hold up remarkably well today. They are, in short, classics.

Now, unfortunately, the negatives: This is NOT the ""complete"" first season. First, the episodes have been released without the original Kellogg's opening and announcer voiceover. Second, the bumpers leading into the commercials (""We will return to the 'Adventures of Superman' in just a moment,"" uttered by the announcer as the Superman crest fills the screen) have been dropped. And third, and most disappointingly, the previews have not been included. This was the thrust of the newspaper story I wrote.

These previews, which are like old-time movie trailers, haven't been seen on commercial television in more than half a century. These rarest elements from the ""Superman"" series were originally part of each first-season episode, with 30 seconds devoted to previewing the next show. This means that almost 15 minutes are missing from the DVDs. It also means that all 26 episodes are incomplete.

Many ""Superman"" fans have waited all their lives to see these previews. It would have been a golden opportunity for Warner Home Video to grant their wish -- after all, aren't DVD sets supposed to include stuff such as this? -- but the company blew it. As Jimmy Olsen would say, ""Jeepers!""

Other reviewers, while correctly praising the overall good quality of the shows, have rightly complained about the poor quality of ""The Stolen Costume."" Also, ""The Unknown People, Part II"" contains the version of the closing theme that was used in the second season. And the first part of the closing credits has been cut off.

As for the extras: It's nice to see the Kellogg's commercials, and the commentaries are OK, but the set does not benefit from ""Pony Express Days,"" the 1940 George Reeves short subject, because it wasn't part of the series and therefore doesn't belong in this collection.

Warner Home Video deserves credit for releasing this DVD set and for doing a decent job with the material. But the company could have done so much better. It should have released these episodes the way they were originally shown, not the truncated way fans have seen them in reruns for so many years. Either Warner should rerelease the DVDs with the original Kellogg's opening, the bumpers and, especially, the previews included, or it should reduce the $39.98 price so fans of the series won't feel ripped off.

Excited about having a full set of the (somewhat darker and more ""adult"") shows that were produced by Robert Maxwell and Bernard Luber, and apprehensive about the fact that the quality of the available prints seems to vary widely.  Even Warner Bros. acknowledged early in the process that ""element issues"" existed with respect to the films.  I purchased the set and have watched several episodes and am pleased to report that, by and large, the shows look REALLY good.  ""The Stolen Costume"" is a little rougher than the others, and I suspect that this one may have simply been digitized and tranferred to DVD without much restoration work.  The rest of the episodes I've watched so far are quite clear and apparently uncut, running about 25 to 26 minutes apiece.  This was typical for most shows of that era.  The set includes both the TV and theatrical releases of the ""The Unknown People"" (a/k/a ""Superman and the Mole-Men"").  A few episodes also have commentary from various parties knowledgable about the show and/or its stars.  There's also a George Reeves short from 1940 and a featurette about how the character evolved from the comic books to TV and the movies (though I haven't watch either of these as yet).

Starring George Reeves as Superman and mild mannered reporter Clark Kent, the show debuted on November 23, 1952, followed by the theatrical success of ""Superman and the Mole Men, which was later shown in two parts as ""The Unknown People"".

The program was shown in glorious black and white. While Superman's costume looked black and white on TV, it really was brown and white for contrast and clarity.
It is said that after several actors screened for the role of Superman, George Reeves was chosen because of his Olympian looks and he just looked the part. Reeves made the character of Superman believable and  genuine and through the eyes of the young and old, he became a hero. The show became very popular then, and is just  as popular today. I have nothing but good thoughts about the DVD. All the first season's programs are there and in good quality. Considering the age of the series, all fans of this popular show should be happy to own it
in their library.

The DVD was released on October 18, 2005, and consists of 26 episodes plus the full length feature film, ""Superman and the Mole Men"". Also, the DVD has some special features. The special features are: Retrospective Documentary, Vintage Warner Brothers historical short starring George Reeves, original Kellogg's cereal commercials, and more.

Running for 662 minutes and digitally mastered  on a deluxe 5-Disc set, this DVD is a must have. The fine cast of actors includes George Reeves, Phyllis Coates, Jack Lawson, John Hamilton, and Robert Shayne. Warner Brothers did a superb job on the packaging and content of this DVD.

There is a reason for this, and it must be understood that Warners did their best with what they had.

Many of us now don't think much of it, but ""The Stolen Costume"" actually features an ending in which Superman intentionally (if indirectly) places two criminals in a situation in which they MUST die, in order to preserve his secret identity. Needless to say, this episode fell out of favor when the show became syndicated, and became ""lost"" for quite some time.

Commentaries in the documentary support what I have always said....the first season had a film noir quality to it and was more violent than later seasons. As teenagers, my friends and I thought Phyllis Coates was hot. The WB short ""The Pony Express"" (1940) is a very enjoyable extra; pristine color print. George Reeves did have incredible charisma. Even if he didn't make it as an A picture star, he should have been used better in Hollywood's vast array of ""B"" films. I wonder what that was about? Anyway, ""Superman and the Mole Men"" is as flat as a piece of paper. Otherwise, it's an excellent group. I look forward to season 2 (the first with Noel Neil as Lois Lane). They were still in black and white and carried through the more adult approach. The episode with Hugh Beaumont as well as ""Five Minutes to Doom"" with Dabbs Greer almost rate as teleplays worthy of one of the adult anthology series of that era. I'm getting ahead of myself.

I am aghast - now there's an old word - by how bad this show is. The presentation is wonderful. The restoration has been done by people who really care. George Reeves is a very likable actor, and so is Jack Larson. Phyllis Coates is very sexy.

But the show. . . oh my. Here in Metropolis, the stories don't resolve. They just end. (Usually with some wry comment by Clark Kent about getting some help from Superman, wink wink.) Different evil characters are played by the same actors week in and week out. (Why? There must have been loads of fine, out-of-work character actors available in L.A., circa 1951.) There are 26 episodes in the first season and perhaps 3 different stories. (The one they used most is about some house, hotel, barn or entire city now mysteriously closed-up - because there's gold in them thar' hills!) The comedy is rife throughout - unintentionally.

There is something fascinating about ""The Adventures of Superman"", however.

2361501,4,B000A5046K,"Warner Brothers has finally released it's first DVD set for ""The Adventures Of Superman.""

Like many baby boomers, I was anticipating an awesome set. What we got instead was a pretty good set.

The packaging is attractive with it's prominent George Reeves picture and it's glittering backround effect, but inside, the DVDs are mounted in a cardboard foldout that places the DVD's over one another. To me this presents a GREAT scratch potential.

The DVD menu is unique and easily navigated. All 26 first season episodes are here. The extras include 3 Kelloggs Frosted Flakes commercials starring George Reeves, a 1940 technicolor short, ""Pony Express Days""  featuring Reeves, audio commentary in several episodes, the feature movie ""Superman and the Mole Men"" and the Superman retrospective ""From Inkwell to Backlot.""  These are all nice, entertaining additions to this set.

Unfortunately, the picture quality for the 26 episodes isn't as good as it could have been. Like many, I had hoped for a 35mm master transfer which would have yielded pristine, sharp prints. What we got instead, was what appeared to be cleaned up 16mm prints of good, but not great, quality. There were several episodes that looked worn, most likely due to poor source material. The good thing here regarding the episodes was that they were the unedited versions.

The sound which is Dolby Digital mono, sounds good with no hiss apparent.

2361504,5,B000A5046K,"""Adventures of Superman"" DVD set, released today, October 18, 2005. It is fantastic! Originally shown on TV in 1952, yet the crisp BW episodes, with dynamic scripts, great acting, and the best portrayal of Superman ever on the big or little screen by George Reeves makes today, a red letter day for Superman fans all over the world.  Noteworthy of the series was its special effects. In  those days, the TV special effects were primitive at best, but in the ""Adventures of Superman"" the attempts to make man fly were far superior than those of the current or even future attempts to show a man fly. George Reeves, in the first season, was rigged to a harness and literally pulled through the air. The effects were realistic and even outstrips modern day movie techniques. Among the special features in this DVD set is a retrospective done by Jack Larsen (Jimmy Olsen), himself. Also, there are commentaries done in four of the episodes (Haunted Lighthouse, The Stolen Costume, the Evil Three, & Crime Wave by a George Reeves biographer and a Superman book author................ ........ ................................................. .. .........................Of the entire series 104 episodes, Season One's 26 episodes contained here are arguably the best season of all (Season Two is a close second).  .........................................................<LI> Highlight episodes included in this DVD set, are ""Superman on Earth"" (the origin tale, where Jor-El can be seen wearing a Golden Age Flash Gordon costume, while other Kryptonians are wearing the costumes of Capt. Marvel & Capt. America!) ""The Mind Machine"" highlight here is the flying sequence where Superman flies to capture a runaway bus via special effects using the harness flying device. ""The Stolen Costume"" a seemingly darker side of Superman is seen as he ponders a solution, ""Crime Wave"" is action-packed (with takes from earlier epidsodes) and in a spectacular finale, uses lighting bolts special effects, and the ""Unknown People"" where animation is used in one scene as he flies to rescue a falling man................................... .....................................................  <LI> Most of the episodes were thrilling, suspenseful and dramatic; while the stunts were ""far beyond those of mortal men"", in other words, very realistic. The fim noir lighting of the sets, the superior acting, the seriousness of the dialogue, and the superb scripts themselves, and the excellent Superman costume, with the uniquely depicted stiched ""S"", made the ""Adventures of Superman"" live on for over 50 years and with this DVD set, far beyond that as well!",1129593600,12,2640,5.463235294117647
2361505,5,B000A5046K,"The first, gripping season of ""The Adventures of Superman"" has had possibly the most unusual history of any television film series, once production wrapped in October 1951.  First the episodes were assembled and scored in late 1951.  Then they were re-edited in early 1952 on orders from the sponsor, Kellogg's cereals.  Then, when the negatives for these ""Kellogg's edits"" began to wear out over the years, the original versions began appearing in syndication.

So Captain Bijou is correct: for the most part, these ARE ""syndication versions.""  However, they are also the ORIGINAL edits, and they include scenes that Kellogg's ordered cut.  Among these:

1) The whipping of Jan Moleska in ""The Monkey Mystery""

2) Greer knocking Lily Sung unconscious with two vicious punches in ""Riddle of the Chinese Jade""

3) Elsa, one of ""The Evil Three,"" getting shoved down a ramp into a cellar, to be left for dead.

There's nothing missing from these episodes except the commercial bumper (""We'll return to the 'Adventures of Superman' in just a moment"") and the aforementioned Preview - both of which were added when Kellogg's ordered the re-edits.  In fact, the version of ""Crime Wave"" included here has likely never been seen on television.

As for the Kellogg's commercials - the three included in the set were made to air with the first season.  Later ads, which did include others in the cast, were produced alongside later seasons and hopefully will be included in future sets.

The 17-minute documentary certainly wasn't made for the hard-core fan: it's for the remaining 80% of total purchasers of this set!  Actually, it sums up the history of the series quite nicely.  Also the four episode commentaries are entertaining and informative.

The only flaw in the diamond is ""The Stolen Costume.""  Apparently the original elements of this show have vanished (perhaps stolen by a rope burglar?), leaving a (much) less-than-pristine dupe behind.  Fans of this particular episode (which features the only TV appearance of detective Candy Myers, a recurring character on the ""Superman"" radio show) will be disappointed that it doesn't sparkle like the other 25.

Nevertheless, it's still a 5-star release; long overdue and highly anticipated.  Don't walk, don't run - FLY faster than a speeding bullet to buy this all-time classic!",1129593600,32,2326,5.132978723404255
2361526,5,B000A5046K,"The reviewer who said that these are the ""truncated syndicated versions"" is being a little picky.  The only thing missing from these episodes is the previews of the next weeks show.  I for one can certainly live without them.  The main substance of the shows appear to be complete; each I've watched so far runs a full 25 minutes, and the prints (digitally restored from originals) look just fine.  I also seemed to notice a few frames in the full-length feature Superman and the Mole Men that that weren't even in the VHS version that Warner Brothers released a few years ago.  The George Reeve ""historical"" short on Buffalo Bill and the Pony Express was in full color and nicely preserved; although not terribly entertaining, it was a thoughtful inclusion.  The three Kellogg's commercials featuring George Reeve are more than sufficient in my view; they're rather boring and not very interesting, so three is plenty for me.  I am hoping that future releases of seasons 2-6 will include Stamp Day for Superman and maybe even the pilot for the 1962 (?) Superboy show that was never picked up (both were available on VHS in the past).  I thought the DVD was very well executed, except for a blooper in the packaging (the box contains a complete list of the 26 episodes with a short synopsis for each, unfortunately, the plot summaries for episodes 14, 15 and 16 are mixed up).  It was a pleasure to watch the first three episodes and the Mole Men movie, and I look forward to ingesting the rest of season one shortly.",1129593600,16,1517,4.651685393258427
2361527,3,B000A5046K,"Fans and purists of THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN TV series a major disappointment.

First, the prints are obviously the truncated TV syndication versions. If your're looking for the original Kellogg's openings, they're not here, though there are 16mm prints circulating throughout the film collecting hobby with ecploding planet and ""Kellogg's, the greatest name in cereal presents...The Adventures of Superman"" announcer line.

Secondly, each first season episode had a ""Preview"" at the story's conclusion before the credits consisting of a a montage of sequences from the next epsiode. These have been Deleted as well.

Third, only four of the original Kellogg's cereal commercials cast commercials are included as one of the special features. All feature only George Reeves as Clark Kent.

The mini-documentary, SUPERMAN: FROM INKWELL TO BACKLOT, is definitely not for diehards. Jack Larson, Allan Asherman, Leonard Maltin, Gary Grossman, Paul Levitz, Dan DiDio, Maike Carlon and Alex Ross and several figures currently associated with DC Comics and the SMALLVILLE TV series chime in with opinions and an brief comments about the series and its impact on 1950s television audiences (--interestingsince only a few of them were alive at the time--). But its pretty bland stuff. No behind-the-scenes footage, production stills or nuggets of little known information.

Thankfully, SUPERMAN AND THE MOLE MEN is included in its entirety as well in its' ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN version: THE UNKINOWN PEOPLE - Parts 1 & 2. But sadly, the theatrical trailer was not included.

The Technicolor Warner Brothers short, PONY EXPRESS DAYS (1940) starring George Reeves is also included. No doubt we'll see the Warners' shorts on future volumes for padding as well.

Packing is colorful and first rate, though a bit cumbersome. One can only imagine how long the multi-fold six disc packaging will last...epscially with repeated handling.

Eons ago, my young eyes were amazed by SUPERMAN AND THE MOLE MEN (--seen at the long-gone Lindale Theater in Houston--), but, then they had been equally amazed at the weekly episodes of ATOM MAN VS. SUPERMAN (--seen at the Joy Theatre also in Houston and also long since departed--). When the first episode of THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN was telecast, I was in the front of the set.

To the dedicated ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN fan -- and who saw it on its first run or even into the 1960s when the Kellogg's openings and previews were still intact on most syndication prints, the set is a disappointment. Though the first shows -- and they are both dark and violent for these sensitive times -- still entertain and recall a imagintive time in television's -- and our -- youth.",1129593600,8,2696,5.165137614678899
2361528,5,B000A5046K,"It's not a bird, or a plane, and it seems like a long time coming, as if the locomotive broke down, but finally it is here!  The first installment of the seasons of Superman, starring George Reeves.

Yes, purists will say that Reeves was not the first Superman on screen or on television, but the truth is that for a generation of people, Reeves was the image and embodiment of  Superman.  Whenever others take the screen (the late, great Christopher Reeve - no relation despite the similarity in name) or television (Dean Cain and Tom Welling have done a good job with their modified forms of the Superman legend), it is invariably with George Reeves that the new Supermen are being compared.

Superman comics set the stage, and people filled in the colour as they will from these black-and-white broadcasts.  There is something classic about the way they look, including the old placing scenes around the Daily Planet building and Los Angeles rather than New York City being the 'Metropolis' of old.

There are twenty-six episodes, the entirety of the first season, with uncut episodes and extras that include the opening and closing credits in full and other fun things to have.  Phyllis Coates play Lois Lane in this series - she is much more tough and no nonsense than will be her replacement for the subsequent shows in the series, Noel Neill.  However, the other regulars are already here:  Jack Larson as Jimmy Olsen and John Hamilton as 'Great Caesar's Ghost!' and 'Don't call me chief!' Perry White.

I was born a dozen years after this series started, and half a dozen years after the death of George Reeves, but I still remember watching this series religiously as a child growing up in the sixties and seventies.  It became an international export, and did a good service for the image of what America hoped to be, with Superman fighting for the underdog and unambiguously always for the right thing - this was an era of truth, justice, and an American way that had a simple integrity about it.

This set also includes the feature film, 'Superman and the Mole Men', an underground adventure starring George Reeves released the season before the television series started.  This is an interesting film, intended (as many Superman stories are) to be a film with a message.  The DVD set includes extras such as commercials, vignettes and other commentary.

This is a great series, and I am very pleased to have my own copy on DVD.  Onward to season two!",1129507200,5,2463,4.744131455399061
2361529,5,B000A5046K,"Now, don't get me wrong, Chris Reeve was wonderful, Dean Cain superb, and Smallville is one of my fave shows in recent times, but just as so many think of Sean Connery as James Bond, the crowd old enough to recall these classic Superman programs always think of George Reeves as the Man of Steel (uh, no, I'm not forgetting that Kirk Alyn also played Superman in serials that pre-dated George).

I've waited for this set for a long time; I have grainy/washed out tapes from a marathon broadcast many years ago, and they did not do justice to George's work.

The debate about B&W/color seems to rage on the reviews here. Absolutely the first 2 seasons were shot in B&W. The Superman costume is actually black, brown, and gray because it photographed better that way. You could tell the difference just by turning off the color on your set when you finally see the color episodes, the suit looks different in B&W when it's a color costume than a monochrome one. And, yes, they were (from all I've read) broadcast in B&W all the way through their original run, it was wise forethought to shoot in color for future airings that brought about the change to color.

I grew up watching these as reruns in the 1960s, I did not see the original airings. Nonetheless, I've anxiously awaited this show on DVD just as the original fans are! Yes, the B&W episodes are more violent/darker, and the color ones got silly in many respects (uh, ""Mr. Zero"" comes to mind), but they're all worth seeing again, and in (hopefully) fully restored audio and video quality....and uncut. I imagine that syndication caused edits to be made for commercial purposes, no thank you!

When the color episdoes finally arrive we'll also be able to own the few that George Reeves directed, giving us a clue to what he might have done had he not passed (read some of the interesting books on his life, you may come away understanding that suicide was probably not the cause of his death!).

I hope the next release will skip to later seasons--whichever season included ""The Big Freeze"" was about when the show hit its peak creatively, when the humor and adventure blended to result in a really fun and funny show. We can always add the second season later! The price seems a bit high to me--I can tell potential producers and marketers of old tv show dvds that I would BUY at a lower price--under $19 per season or under $79 for a complete set of all seasons.

I think, working on such a tight budget forced the writers et al to be more creative and more imaginative and to use their resources to their fullest extent. The acting was tight and believable. The only  thing you had to ""believe"" was that Superman really existed. Everything else fell into place. If he really lived, he did everything that you would expect a Super MAN  to do.

Too bad she left the show, because she really provided a dimension and role model that befits Lois Lane.  Reeves was also at his best in the first season.  He looks much younger and fitter, and his acting abilities were well suited to the more serious plots.

The first two seasons of ""Adventures Of Superman"" were filmed in black and white. Subsequent seasons were shot in color, but originally telecast in B&W.

As another reviewer pointed out, the Amazon specs list this Season One DVD set as a color release. And the cover art shows a colorized black and white photo of Superman star George Reeves.

That leaves only four possibilities:

1. This is a B&W set
2. This is a colorized set
3. This set contains both B&W and colorized episodes
4. First-season color footage has been discovered in Kal-El's rocket.

Only four stars pending resolution of the B&W/Colorized question. But jeepers, Mr. Kent, Superman is finally coming to DVD! A scoop for Warners and the fans.

""This 5-DVD set runs 662 minutes in the original full-frame black-and-white video and mono audio soundtrack. Subtitles in English, French, and Spanish are flying your way along with closed captioning for the hearing impaired.""

Some clod at the station cut out part of the climatic scene, probably because he thought it was way too intense for children. They ran it that way for years. Something like that could well end up on this DVD. However, digitally remastered first season episodes would be quite a treat.

It seems strange writing a review BEFORE the set of DVDs are actually released but yet, like most of you, this is one series that we ALL remember fondly. Seems like all of us remember running home from school on weeknights because we didn't want to miss watching ""the next thrill packed episode in the amazing Adventures Of Supermsn!""

With 104 total episodes in the series, isn't it amazing how most of us can remember what happened in just about every episode? Just watch a few minutes of one of them and you can almost guarantee that we'll be saying ""Oh yeah, I remember THIS one. This is the one where Superman..."" and we'd go on with the entire remainder of the half-hour storyline. That just shows how special and well done this series was, and of course what it meant to us Baby Boomers who grew up watching it!

I'm SO glad that the series is being released in sequence. When the VHS releases came out a few years back they would have one episode from the first year and another from a later year on the same tape. Having them in sequence is so much better. Especially when you watch this ""no nonsense"" first season of the series.

This first season was fairly violent, and Kelloggs opposed sponsoring the show because they wanted something aimed more at the kiddies. So, as we all know, starting with the second season  the show took a ""lighter"" approach in it's storylines (Professor Pepperwinkle, anyone?). Still, there WERE great moments from the subsequent years. (How about the one with the huge meteor that's going to crash into Earth? We got to see Superman actually fly into space! Further than he'd ever flown before!) And I for one will continue to purchase them to complete the set for my library.

But I digress. Back to Season One, which is what this set is all about. There WERE some ""nasty"" things in some of the storys. Everything from an old woman having her wheelchair pushed down the stairs (with her in it) in an old hotel, to the bad guys taking the leg braces from a little girl so she couldn't get away. But what the hey, we didn't turn out bad watching them, right?

Sure some of them were corny, but we loved them nonetheless. We didn't care that we could see the zippers on the backs of the little mole men. We didn't care that they were walking around with a vacuum cleaner to use as a weapon. And we didn't care (or maybe didn't notice) that in that same Mole Men episode when Lois asks how deep the hole was and was told something like ""just over 5000 feet"" she replies ""Good heavens! That's almost to the center of the Earth!"" (Yeah, sure, if the Earth was flat as a pancake maybe.)  But we didn't care. It was fun! And it will be all that much more fun to see them all again!

It will be SO great seeing the shows uncut and in their entirety. It was pretty sad when you'd catch them in later years on WGN and they would squeeze so many commercials in that you'd miss huge parts of the story. It always seemed that they'd cut away for a commercial and when they'd come back Lois and Jimmy would be bound and gagged and in big trouble again. Fortunately, WE knew what happened since we'd seen the episodes many many times before.

Someone posted a note about the previews that used to be at the end of the season one episodes. I remember those well and also hope, at the very minimum, that they have them on the DVD SOMEplace (even if only in a bonus features section on one of the discs). Though it would be so much better if they were right where they were when first aired...right there at the end of each episode.

Needless to say, I'm as excited as the rest of you to see these classics once again. I know I'm going to be glued to my TV set for quite some time once I get them. Another thing that's great is that we all used to watch them on small TVs back in the '50s. Just think how great it'll be to watch them on the big screens of today!

And one more thing, for those of you that might not know, but really enjoyed the music from the show. There is a CD available here on Amazon featuring all of the action music from the show, including the intro and ending credits music. If you remember the show like I do you'll remember the music as well and the CD will  bring back many great memories for you. Check it out. It's official title here on Amazon is: The Adventures of Superman: Original Television Soundtrack (1950s TV Series) [SOUNDTRACK]

Get ready everyone. October is right around the corner!

Here's to George Reeves, the BEST Superman EVER!

I'm pretty sure that this box set with have the episodes in glorious B&W (mainly because I've never seen these episodes in ANY form of colorized reruns). The other thing that distinguishes this first season from the rest is the flying sequences; more action shots were used (Superman turning and moving in flight, more close-ups). In later seasons,to save money, more stock footage was used...remember? The one single shot of Supes flying; arms out against a blue sky that they reversed to show him travelling in a different direction (completely ignoring the fact his ""S"" was backwards in those shots!)

 No, the first season has more going for it than all the other seasons. Can't wait!",1123718400,9,744,4.896825396825397
2361555,5,B000A5046K,"It is great to see this series start to come out as I grew up on this series in black & white in the latter 1950s in Australia but later found out that the second half was made in color in anticipation of the introduction of color. The Cisco Kid and one other series I cannot remember also had original color episodes. Let's hope that the authorized Warner Superman color episodes are reasonably restored compared to Cisco Kid episodes available. I hope Warner have the two serials planned. I have the first on Laserdisc and it was a great transfer by Warners who have had the rights for a longtime now(originally a Columbia serial). I missed the second serial as my circumstances altered due to a fire in my business and the loss of much irreplaceable archives at the time(5/1997).

There is an extra that was supposedly not used but available for many years as a 16mm film and maybe Super8/8mm called Stamp Day for Superman. I do not see this title in the listing of notes in other reviews.

Superman is one of two great shows from the 1950s TV that had two women play the female lead over the life of the series. The other is The Adventures of Robin Hood made in England with the late Richard Greene as Robin Hood. All titles of this series are now available on DVD legitimately from UK and I have them all. Another favorite from my youth and one that along with I Love Lucy, Our Miss Brooks and the original Mickey Mouse Club that got repeated and repeated on TV in Australia and I still like these shows, They were some of the first shows on TV here when TV cme in 1956.

Superman as a TV series produced a catch phrase that is still heard here today taken from the opening montage of this great, entertaining series. I recommend this series to anyone who likes early or things from their forming years. I will be buying the series ASAP when it is available.",1123113600,13,1863,4.394202898550724
