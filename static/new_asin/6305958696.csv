7898494,2,6305958696,"Two stars doesn't mean I didn't like it. It had fine actors with a standard you would expect from such a cast. It even had a good screenplay. But the story was weak. Too weak to make up for all the positives. If you don't care about story telling, but only action and drama, then this movie will be entertaining. However, if you are like me, and think that a good tale is the essence of story telling, then well... Still probably worth watching if you are a fan of Sam Rockwell, Joe Mantegna, and Ted Danson, et al. But not great.",1439596800,,530,4.205882352941177

Great cast Joe montagna is always very good. Catch him in ""THINGS CHANGE"" with Don Ameche.",1329436800,,261,4.24
7898497,5,6305958696,"It had been a few years since I'd seen this film on cable, and had never seen or read anything further on it since. When I found it on Amazon recently, I was very curious to see if it held up to my memory of its impact. Long story short, it did and does. One thing however: During the years when I would recollect this film, I always thought of it as having been a David Mamet project since when I initially saw it i didn't see the credits. Upon re-viewing it, I can see why I assumed it was a Mamet film because it had a certain Mametesque dark humor and very un-dramatic depictions of violence, but Saul Rubinek should not be accused of mimicry - he has infused it with a distinct originality and character developement so that it does stand on it's own, even  with repeated viewings. I recommend it without reservation.",1265414400,,822,4.303225806451613
7898498,4,6305958696,"Worth seeing if just for Mantegna, who fairly knocks this one out of the park. He's fully believable in his role and brings much heart and humor to both the character and the movie. Everyone else is good as well, though Danson and Macy hardly deserve credit for two-minute roles.
The directing is quite excellent, sharp and mostly unobtrusive; the pans from one scene to the next are very interesting and add a lot to the film's meaning rather than just calling attention to themselves and the director.
I'd call this PrettyGoodFellas.",1198713600,,535,4.826086956521739
7898499,5,6305958696,"Quel bon film.  Si vous aimez les comdies dans le genre un peu tordu, vous aller en avoir pour votre argent.  Les changements de scnes sont dlicieux et le sujet est un peu farfelu.  Pour les amateurs de Pulp Fiction, Fargo, etc...",1114387200,,230,4.428571428571429
7898500,4,6305958696,"This extra-quirky black comedy works by dint of its unpredictable dialogue and sudden deaths (so to speak--it's the tale of two suburban hit men), as well as some unusual moments--one of the guys, burying a body in the forest, stops to look at a doe, only a few yards away.  In addition, the scene transitions are cleverly done, moving back and forth in time and season--summer changes to winter in a few seconds, taking maximum advantage of the film medium to segue based on a few small random items into a milieu that's completely different from the previous one.
The hit men are played by Joe Mantegna, one of the executive producers, and Sam Rockwell, and their boss is Canadian actor Maury Chaykin.  All are effective in their darkly funny roles, as are Peter Riegert, William H. Macy, Ted Danson, and Charles Durning as an older hit man who taught Mantegna's Tom everything he knows.  Durning's Vic also wants to publish a book about his life, using a ""pseudoname""--which does not go over too well with others.
Hit men are not called that for nothing.  With a used car lot as a front, these guys get down to business wherever they're needed--northern Wisconsin or central Florida.  There's a peculiar, but definitely interesting, mix of the comic and the serious as one of the two guys talks about how his newborn baby won't stop screaming in the middle of the night, making him think about exercising his craft on a family member.  Juxtapose this with the same guy repeatedly cursing a chainsaw that refuses to start and you have one heck of a goofy movie that does stuff no other film has done...or maybe, wants to do.
There are really no women in the film, save for a very brief scene with one of the two guy's wives, and she's sleeping.  It's a guy film all the way and although it probably could have used more substance, it's very good for what it is.
See it if you want to watch something different, unusual, offbeat, occasionally funny, and occasionally very sharp indeed.",1026691200,3,1986,4.641025641025641
7898501,3,6305958696,"One has to have a morbid sense of humor to enjoy this wry black comedy about two used car salesmen who moonlight as contract killers.  The comedy is very tongue in cheek as these two miscreants matter-of-factly whack a dozen or so marked men while bickering over trivialities.
The gag is funny at first, but wears thin as we are treated to minor variations on the same theme for an hour and a half.  Other than some innovative scene transitions, the direction by veteran TV director Saul Rubinek was nothing special, except I suppose he made good use of a very limited budget.  The story was taken from a play by Rick Cleveland, (""The West Wing"" TV series) and Rubinek maintained the theatrical feel using simple sets and concentrating mainly on the actors.
Joe Mantegna is an excellent tough-guy character actor and conjures another terrific mobster.  He is a hard but practical murderer who takes the task as strictly business and longs to get out of the game.  Sam Rockwell is also good as his dim-witted cohort, who begins to like his work a bit too much.  Charles Durning gives a droll performance as an over-the-hill hit man who wants to write a book about his targets.  There are also cameos by William Macy, Ted Danson and Peter Riegert.
This is a better than average B movie with some acting performances that are worth seeing.  I rated it a 6/10.  It is funny in a perverse way, and Mantegna's performance is a treat.",982886400,5,1427,4.608695652173913
7898502,5,6305958696,"This is the movie that brings you into the world of the ordinary hit man -- well not the machine gun tottling Mafioso gunmen we're so used to watching in the big gangster movies. But the ordinary hit man who does his  job as a necessary means to a living. The job is fine but there's no pot of  gold at the end of the rainbow. The art of doing well is to kill with  nonchalance. It is a hazardous occupation -- you go on as long as you can  but don't know if you'll be a target yourself one day.
There are no  fancy trenchcoats or big cigars. The hit men work as used car salesmen,  wipe windows in the lot when free and pay for their own movie tickets. They  supply their income by knocking off their assigned victims. A respectable  year for Tom means usually getting about two to three contracts done. Young  Jerry (Sam Rockwell) learns the ropes from Tom (Joe Mantegna) and witnesses  his first murder in the front seat of a car. Jerry's induction is every bit  as abhorrent as one would typically react to seeing a man killed. But he  learns to like what he does and becomes as cold and merciless as his mentor  is. In fact Jerry gets to be as ruthless as Tom, to the point that he even  takes sadistic pleasure when whacking off his victims. Tom's professional  detachment is his strength and hallmark. But this trait unfortunately is  never learnt by his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and the latter's intractability proves to be  his undoing.
Apart from a very entertaining script, what makes the movie  an excellent watch is the top-notch performances from the cast, especially  Joe Mantegna, Sam Rockwell, Maury Chaykin and Charles Durning. And of  course the wonderful cameos by William Macy and Ted Danson. The brutality  of the killings is shocking but any darkness in the movie is balanced by  the humorous edge throughout. This is about ordinary hit men getting their  contracts done. There are no recriminations and regrets. The movie starts  and ends on a sardonic note, and it's a pity that its low budget nature  probably stymied any commercial success.",962409600,,2064,4.589041095890411
