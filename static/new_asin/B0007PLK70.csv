8211916,1,B0007PLK70,"OMG! What a waste! The cover says Freaknik, with Guest appearances by Outkast, Goodie Mob, Lazy Bone and others. The Freanik part of the dvd does not even appear on this DVD.
What does appear on this dvd is a low budget film of Los Angles lowrider car culture, which has lowriders (cars) jumping up and down. If your into that, and want to see it on
a low budget dvd, then this is for you. No Freaknik fun, on this dvd. AVOID!!!!",1271894400,,429,4.180722891566265
