It would be helpful to put the title ""Next"" by the new title so that buyers know that this is the same movie.

8235249,4,B0001H9N8M,"Here`s another reason I`m beginning to hate Mya releases -  this one`s a retitling of 'The Strange Vice Of Mrs. Wardh' (1974), directed by Sergio Martino (Torso) and starring Edwige Fenech ('5 Dolls For An August Moon','All The Colors Of The Dark','Your Vice Is A Locked Room','Lover Boy', etc.etc.), which has NOTHING to do w/ The Ripper - it`s false marketing on all counts. AND it`s the EXACT same transfer (maybe not even as good) used by the now-sadly defunct NoShame label (sniff). Except there are NO extras, which made the NoShame releases even more enjoyable. The movie itself is a good one, IF you enjoy Gaillos, Sergio Martino OR Edwige Fenech (and quite frankly, for that time period, who doesn`t??). I`d recommend searching out the NoShame release on Amazon or Ebay before I plopped down $24.99 for the bare-bones reissue from Mya (read my many other Mya releases reviews for additional details) - these folks are raiding other vaults to retitle and regurgitate either out-of-print classics or movies that you don`t really need to see, and marketing them deceptively to an unsuspecting core audience who, frankly, deserves better treatment than this. But the flick itself is worth your time and attention regardless of the repackaging or distributor, I`m just tired of Mya selling the sizzle and not the steak...",1267833600,19,1325,5.0227272727272725

8235251,1,B0001H9N8M,"I'm not exactly going out on a limb to say this is going to be the same transfer used almost five years ago by NoShame films. The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh is a pretty good giallo, I'd give the film itself 3 stars. If you didn't buy the out of print NoShame disc this may be a good option.

It will be interesting to see if this is indeed the same transfer from NoShame and if it will include the great extras from that disc. Also, if it isn't a new transfer and doesn't have the extras, it will be funny that the NoShame disc from five years ago was list priced at $19.95 while this is listed as $24.95!

Time will tell but beware of this shady company, who charges more and gives you less.",1259020800,13,692,4.043795620437956
