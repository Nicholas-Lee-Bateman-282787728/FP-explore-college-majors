8123853,5,B000FJTVDI,"This movie is amazing and it shows the Civil War for what it is horrors and all instead of romanticizing it as so many Civil War films do. Plus it shows the equipment for what it is meaning the muskets and uniforms of the more seasoned troops look worn where as the home guard uniforms look new. Most films don't go into that detail. Historically it was pretty accurate, the actors looked just like the people they portrayed though many weren't all that good at acting. The CG effects could have had a little bit of work but still decent.

This gets a 5 star rating for the above statement as well as the fact I am a avid Civil War buff and a Civil War reenactor, and this is something I can appreciate. Plus I didn't pay an arm, leg, and kidney for it with it being priced most places at $100+ depending on condition. I payed $2.50 for it.

If you want a polished film with the most actors and CG effects go watch Gettysburg, Gods and Generals, and Glory. If you want an accurate depiction of the Civil War from many viewpoints (leaders, common soldiers, and civilians) this is your movie. Most people say in the negative reviews here that they didn't like it because it didn't focus on just a few people, but to me the viewpoints of the broad amount of people broadens the view and feelings of the Civil War making it much more better in my opinion.",1360540800,3,1351,4.31496062992126
8123854,2,B000FJTVDI,"As much as I liked Director Hersberger's prior outing Wicked Spring I must admit that No Retreat From Destiny was a disappointment.  The film presented no real common character with which one could identify.  Simply, the character development was poor.  With the exception of Fritz Klein, who played Abraham Lincoln, and the fellow who played Jefferson Davis we are basically presented with a lot of Civil War Generals mumbling their way through the final days of the war.  And that was another problem, the sound direction.  The audio for much of this film is poor.  Characters shouting orders apparently not within any reasonable distance of a microphone.  Generals mumbling through fake beards.  And what was the point of the emphasis on soldiers wounds and obvious fake blood?

To its credit the film does tell the story of the Battle of Monocacy and the ill fated Confederate thrust toward Washington, DC in the final days of the war.  The battle scenes are well filmed, with the exception, of what looks like the integration of video with film???  The soundtrack was OK too.

This film will be interesting to Civil War buffs but has not real general appeal because there is no story here just a lot of documentary.",1201824000,5,1220,4.840579710144928
8123855,5,B000FJTVDI,"No Retreat From Destiny

This Movie was outstanding in the fact that the information provided to the viewer was Excelent.

The viewer was treated to the action packed Drama of real Civil War Combat.

The uniforms were Outstanding.

The Reenactors were Wonderful in their rolls.

The background was fantastic.

Special effects were were some of the best I have ever viewed in any  Civil War Movie.

It looked as if live rounds were being fired during the movie,hits on trees,buildings,ground,and on actors.

Cannons being ran out onto the field of Battle by hand,so real I felt that I was there my self.

I encourage all history buffs to see this movie,you will be thrilled to see a low budget movie turned into a Hollywood Preimier.

I have enjoyed the movies,Gone With The Wind,Red Badge Of Courage,
Gettysburg,Gods And Generals,Cold Mountain,Wicked Spring,  Horses Of Gettysburg,and now No Retreat From Destiny.",1188691200,3,913,5.053691275167785
8123856,1,B000FJTVDI,"I love history and in particular the American Civil War but this poorly/disjointed effort left me using the fast forward button.

On the plus side the actors that portrayed key characters such as Robert E. Lee really looked like them.  The uniforms/flags/equipment could not have been better but this was an end to the good stuff.

The actors may have looked like the people they portrayed but when they opened their mouths you wanted to wretch.  The story was disjointed, you never had a feel for the battle or what was going on.  It essentially was a group of re-enactors (living historians if you prefer) left on their own without any direction or coordination of their efforts.  The use of the map could have added to the flow of the story but apparently the budget had room for blown off legs but not for a few arrows on the map.

The sound was poor and the music overwhelmed the female narrator so you could not hear what she was saying, that was true with some of the other speaking roles which in truth.....was a blessing.",1184025600,3,1030,4.535135135135135
8123857,5,B000FJTVDI,"While General Lee's men are stuck in petersburg in siege with General Grant. One night General Lee gives General Early a independant command to take Washington DC. While it takes a while for Grant and the union army to relised that Lee had moved one of his divisons up north. Instead of attacking washington head on Early is met in combat which he not intended to do untill he reached washington he meets General Wallace, at Monocacy Maryland. Now that Early is in combat whith Wallace and finaly the union fall's back to bailtimore, maryland. Early looses hours of delay b/c he needs to rest his troops but then the next day Washington has prepared it's garisons and troops for battle. When Early moves his troops to Washinton, he is meet with distaster on the battlefield at fort stevens. On the Monocacy battlefield casualties where high General Early, lost 1,000 men dead, wounded, and missing General Wallace, lost 1,200 dead, wounded, and missing. But this is a verry good DVD and movie/doc. I was going to do some of the filming for a weekend on a set but instead I was in gettysburg doing a civil war living history I'm sad that I missed this movied and couldn't make it. But I still think the movie is good and the sound track is great! But there are some bad parts where the post re-recording of the voices are kind of off like in the Lincoln scenes but the blood, muskets, uniforms, actors, reenactors, horses, cannons, civileans, and battles are all good this movie is just as good as Gods and Generals, Gettysburg and Glory. It goes in thoses top movie list for civil war films. But rent it at blockbuster or order it online it's a...A+ movie.",1151539200,4,1656,4.579124579124579
8123858,5,B000FJTVDI,"""No Retreat from Destiny: The Battle that Rescued Washington"" tells the heroic true story of the battle of Monocacy, a little-known event of the American Civil War. While not as famous as Gettysburg, Antietam, or Chancellorsville, the battle's importance is unquestionable. If the 18,000 man Confederate Army of Jubal Early had not been delayed by the 5000 troops commanded by General Lew Wallace (future writer of ""Ben Hur""), then Early would have no doubt succeeded in taking Washington D.C., and altering the course of the war in favor of the Confederacy.
For a film shot on a budget of $400,000, the film is very well-done. While the film does have weaknesses in terms of editing and CG effects, the battle scenes are very effective, and the acting is quite good. The standout actor is Fritz Klein, who gives a powerful performance as Abraham Lincoln.
The DVD features some fine picture quality, but the sound is lacking in some areas. The extras are quite good, including a fantastic 40-minute feature filmed at the 140th Monocacy Reenactment.
Overall, ""No Retreat from Destiny"" is a fine film that will surely be enjoyed mostly by Historians and reenactors. I recommend it to those categories, since most film-viewers might not get much out of it. But it is a great film that shall surely entertain those interested in the history of the American Civil War.
