8304520,4,B001G9CNQI,"Certainly not for the people that want an overly dramatic movie, but if you want a short fun light hearted glimpse of a couple of hot chicks, this is the film for you.",1352419200,,167,4.090909090909091
8304521,3,B001G9CNQI,"Nobody wrote a review telling if this movie is really ""uncensored"" as the box cover claims. Mona Gillen show's her butt in the alternate version of the reenactment of nypd blue. She shows her butt a little in the alternate absynth sketch. The monopoly sketch is slightly longer, but not showing any extra skin. There is some cute stuff, and humor; but it falls short on the nudity it implies is in it.",1339459200,3,401,4.506849315068493
8304522,4,B001G9CNQI,"Okay, this is a funny compilation we bought after viewing their stuff on youtube. It has a bit of fat humor that is a bit offensive if you are uptight about weight. So some relatives won't get to borrow it, but most of it was pretty good.",1338076800,,238,4.085106382978723
8304523,4,B001G9CNQI,"Jed and Mona Gillen are a great new presence in the film industry, they have a wonderful light humor and quirky sense of life. I'll be waiting for what they come out with next.

It's only 60 minutes long....but I've watched it for 3 hours now.",1228694400,3,454,6.810344827586207
