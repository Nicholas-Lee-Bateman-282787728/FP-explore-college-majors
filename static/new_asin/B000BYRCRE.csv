Excellent movie, love John Leguizamo, I highly recommend it.",1189900800,,118,4.666666666666667
2447959,3,B000BYRCRE,"The story is very trite.  It just seemed to move very slowly plot-wise in the first 45 min.  John Leguizamo appears to be lip-synching in about half the songs he is singing.  I noted that Elizabeth Pena also appeared to be lip-synching in one song.  John is about 35, but managed to pull off looking 20 pretty well.  The music was great, and should please Latino audiences and others of us who love Latin music and are not Latino.  Watch this film for the music and you will not be disappointed.",1152835200,,495,4.384615384615385
2447960,4,B000BYRCRE,"I loved this film and think it's definitely worth a viewing or two. The film has a sweetness to it, which I don't think is sacchrine at all. It's a great story, with a slightly surreal feeling to it (think ""Chocolate""), and it ends really well. The cast plays its parts very well, and I think it's an impressive ensemble in a great movie.",1138579200,,338,4.296875
2447961,3,B000BYRCRE,"When film credits don't include the writer/s names, problems can be expected.  This little candy-coated attempt to explore how 'dreams really do come true' is more a music video than a full fledged film, a project where obviously the money was spent on the graphics of the opening credits and the staged musical numbers rather than on the script.  This is not a bad movie: it is just predictably trite and places lines in the mouths of some very fine actors that must have been an embarrassment to speak.

Antonio (John Leguizamo, with lots of hair and none of his expected comedic edge) is a Mexican immigrant who lands in Los Angeles with his grandfather's philosophy to follow that dream (`Sueo')  and believes he will find his major career in his music.  Reality sets in immediately as he is forced to work in his uncle's Taco Stand and play his guitar and sing in sleazy deadbeat nightclubs.  He meets a customer Nina (Ana Claudia Talancn) who dreams of becoming a veterinarian but is committed to caring for her ailing papa (Winston J. Rocha). Despite sweet Antonio's attempts to woo her, she remains adamant that she must devote her life to caring for papa.  Next door to Anthony the apartment is occupied by Mirabella (Elizabeth Pea), a newly divorced, middle-aged pudgy ex-singer who does housekeeping and laundry to support her children while she dreams of once again becoming a star vocalist: again the heart of gold Antonio befriends her, hears her sing and insists she has great talent.

Antonio is encouraged by a good-hearted 'manager' Rafael (Jsu Garcia) and is paired with three other musicians to form a group El Gran Colectivo with the hesitant Mirabella as vocalist.  There is the requisite Music Group Competition where against all odds the group competes out of faith and devotion to each other and the old type of music.  That everyone's dream comes true is no surprise at all: the plot is so thin that the audience knows from the start how everything will resolve 'in a land where troubles melt like lemon drops...'.

The idea is sweet, the message is wholesome, and the strong cast does everything it can with the treacle of a script hampering them.  But unless you have an appetite for candy and can wait for the occasional surrealism of the dream sequences, this venture may just put you in sugar overload.

8094409,4,B000BYRCRE,"Loved this movie but viewer beware, don't watch the previews of other movies unless you like horror and satanic movies. I bought a peaceful, loving film and was blasted with evil previews I did not intend to see, so it left me feeling really disturbed. Back to this movie: John Leguizamo is gorgeous in this film. I love his voice and his spirit. The other actors did an incredible job. Really loved this film.",1418342400,,410,4.554054054054054

I liked the ""follow  your dreams"" theme and the side story of the woman who thinks she is too old to be sexy.  Obviously not!  Viva la musica!",1192752000,,246,4.4772727272727275
