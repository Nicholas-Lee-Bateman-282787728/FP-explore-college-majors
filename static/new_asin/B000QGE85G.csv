The story is interesting and plots move along very fast and gripping.  All main characters are well established.  A totally enjoyable experience.  Worth watching it again and again.  Yes, I have it in my DVD collection.",1235174400,7,341,5.0
2838824,4,B000QGE85G,"Alain Delon plays again his favorite role, that of a rugged ""seen it all, done it all"" police inspector, in this made for TV series of movies. All action is happening in Marseille, with its corrupt political and police systems, with its new French social problem, aka a significant Arab minority. Fabio Montale, the central character is investigating crime in the city, in the background of a beautiful Marseille, haunted by his childhood and his friends gone on their separate ways. One can still get glimps of Delon's boyish charm and his unique style of acting. It is a pretty good show.",1201046400,11,590,4.794117647058823

Films are presented in French, with optional English subtitles. No bonus. This is pretty good thrillers on the Marseille milieu, made by Jos Pinheiro, a director with whom Delon worked a few times in the 80s, but whose assets are not its best successes.",1387324800,,423,4.888888888888889

8196325,1,B000QGE85G,"If you loved the Marseilles Trilogy, you'll hate these movies.  Frankly I could only bring myself to watch the first one, Total Chaos.  Alain Delon is woefully miscast.  I'm sure there are movies where an aging, pompous detective could be cast, but this is not one of them.  In the books, Montale may have passed from youth into the verge of middle age, but you get the sense that he's a still vibrant, lustful man.  Delon looks like he's ready to fall asleep.

One of the treasures of the books is their evocation of Marseilles.  The city is rife with racial tension and the consequences of dehabilitating poverty. The tendrils of bland modernity are creeping in, swiping aside the older, richer city.  There is a definite sense of place and the love of the characters for their home, a city of travelers who came and stayed.  This movie looks like it could have been shot in Santa Barbara.  And Montale's connection with the sea is a huge part of his character, something that the movie tries to achieve by having Delon gaze repeatedly wistfully off into the ocean.

Because of Delon's age, and probably sensitivity to the clearly leftist political bent of the books, the plot had to be reworked drastically.  It's a confused mess.  Whoever wrote the screen play wrote all of the tension and suspense right out of it.  And I can't say much for the cinematography.  I realize the movie was shot for television with limited budgets and shooting schedules and all that, but the direction is uninspired.

One funny note.  I wondered why they had Montale driving around in an old, beat up station wagon.  Then came a scene where the car is all shot up.  I realized that they probably didn't want to spend money on a nicer car that they were going to destroy.

Jean Claude Izzo's books will have to await and deserve a much better treatment.  Don't bother with this DVD.  Trust me.",1279238400,6,1877,4.6072507552870094
8196326,5,B000QGE85G,"I liked this movie a lot, because it's not an artificial action movie. It doesn't have special effects and all the unreal movements. But it keeps your attention.

I would like to find on Amazon more European, not only French, but German, English, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Polish, Bulgarian movies, from all the European coutries, and not only, from Asia too, from Africa.

They are like a breath of fresh air.",1244764800,7,419,4.887323943661972
