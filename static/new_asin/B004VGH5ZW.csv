8443332,5,B004VGH5ZW,"This video is designed specifically for people with no experience in yoga. Postures are demonstrated in two different levels of difficulty and you can crack the rust off your bones by just doing the simpler level for awhile. When you're ready, switch to the deeper level and open up your body even further. It's the perfect exercise to do before taking on more challenging exercise routines.
Buy an extra one for the 'rusty bones' in your circle of family & friends. Have Fun!",1302652800,,476,4.746987951807229
