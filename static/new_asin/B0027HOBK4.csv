8354752,5,B0027HOBK4,"My 3-year-old grandson loves this video, especially Kipper, which is about him playing hide-and-seek with a friend who has trouble counting to 10. It also helps my grandson learn to count. He also loves the other stories on this DVD as well, including the bonus story of Rory the Race Car. I highly recommend for toddlers aged 2+.",1478304000,,330,4.706896551724138

8354759,5,B0027HOBK4,"Learning is more fun when you do it with friends. This disc features Barney, Bob the Builder, Thomas the Engine, Kipper, Fireman Sam, Roary the Racing Car, and Fifi with the Flowertots. There are seven episodes with a total running time of 63 minutes.

Fun and learning are equal in these stories about discovery and adventure. This is an all-star team of animated characters who will more than entertain young children and their parents. A wonderful introduction disc if you do not have other discs for each of the featured characters. If you unfamiliar with these characters then this is an excellent and inexpensive opportunity to meet such.

A great gift for grandchildren, nieces and nephews or grandparents. Score an ""A."" Buy this wonderful DVD.",1261526400,3,751,5.0
