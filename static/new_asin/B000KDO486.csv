8155698,2,B000KDO486,"Watched this DVD back in 2008, and watched again for fun in 2013....not impressed either time.  You can't hide the awkwardness when you get these guys together in a room.  Matesau has the most personality, but when you watch him (or any of them) explain why they make certain moves you end up with arguments both ways and no actual lesson learned other than that you can make an argument for any particular poker move at any time.",1385251200,,430,4.5
8155699,1,B000KDO486,"I picked up two bits of useful info from this video, otherwise this thing is a joke. I kid you not, we are 45 minutes into the video and the hostess asks ""So in Omaha you can only use two of your cards right?"". Shortly thereafter the producer Michael Berk announces someone won a hand and they didn't he only had Jacks up and someone had Aces up...Boy they didn't edit ANYTHING!

Sklansky adds a couple of useful things, Matusow a couple and Brunson confirmed some things but the video itself is TERRIBLE.

Honestly guys, this format would have worked if you did about 8 hours of footage and edited it down to the best 1 hour. But they friggin did 1 hour of footage and used it all. 1 hour of guys playing 466T in Omaha hi-lo and being critiqued is just not that useful.

I would give this thing away but I doubt anyone would take it.",1270080000,,834,4.232704402515723
8155700,1,B000KDO486,"This has the look and feel of a pilot for training videos done in a backroom at some tourney many years ago. Production is horrible, they review hands of amateurs that play almost anything, so there is nothing to learn unless you are a rank beginner. Matusow disappears in the middle of it, they excuse it as he had to play in a tourney, lending credence to my belief this was shot in a back room. The only good thing I can say about it is that it was only $10 and fans of Matusow, Sklansky, or Brunson might get a kick or two out of it.",1269993600,,537,4.02803738317757
8155701,3,B000KDO486,"Not a bad product, not the best either.  The Ed Miller videos do a much better job, however for the price I can't complain.

The play by play explanation of how Mike and Todd analyze each hand is excellent.  This really gets you into the mind of how a professional thinks.  This is opened up my mind and also pointed out some leaks i have in my game.",1230681600,,350,4.102941176470588
8155702,5,B000KDO486,"I have owned this dvd for 1 week, and I can honestly say it has improved my game and has taught me the basics. It's short, but has lots of info for a new player to learn from . THank you guys for a job well done.",1182902400,,212,3.5319148936170213
