4229298,5,B003YGSLAI,We have a 2 year old little boy who is discovering all kinds of things and loves animals so these videos are great for him.  The purchase process was easy and delivery only took two days.  There is a great variety of animals and toys and my son just loves sitting and watching.,1366416000,,277,4.2075471698113205
4229299,5,B003YGSLAI,"My 14 month old son LOVES the Baby Einstein videos and this one is no different.  It shows animals in the forest, the dessert, the Savannah and the jungle.  My son loves the puppets, the animation and the animal footage.  I highly recommend it for babies 9 months +!",1365811200,,266,4.387755102040816

4229302,1,B003YGSLAI,My 1 1/2 year old daughter hates the baby einstein videos. They are so boring. I bought the dvd from buy buy baby. She watch the video for 5 minutes and asked me to change it for her favorite baby genius dvds. She absolutely loves the baby genius dvds. All of them have children's songs and kids dancing which my daughter loves so much and can watch everyday. I don't understand why are baby einstein videos (and books) so boring.,1337040000,,430,4.3875
4229303,1,B003YGSLAI,"My 3 month old baby now 4.5 months did not like this DVD at all. The animals was too wild for her and kind of scared her a litle. She did not watch this DVD nor did she showed any interest. Unlike the Baby Mozart, Beethoven and World of Colors are the best !",1324598400,,258,3.7962962962962963
4229304,2,B003YGSLAI,"The Baby Einstein video's are good & our children have loved the Baby Einstein ""Animals"" DVD but I would not recommend the follow-up ""Wild Animal Safari"". Its very similar to other order series DVD's with the pictures, puppets etc. but it just doesn't have the same attention grabbing effect of the Animals DVD. Our kids laugh, smile & will interact with us as we watch the ""Baby Einstein Animals"" with them but they were basically bored with the whole Safari adventure. Little dissapointing but overall its still a good little series.",1322265600,,535,4.8901098901098905
4229305,5,B003YGSLAI,My 6 month old grand daughter has all 3 Level 2 Explorer Baby Einstein DVDs. She now recognises the music from them and jigs up and down. The vivid colors of the animals and sea creatures keep her attention through the whole DVD. A great early learning experience for her.,1313971200,3,272,4.46
4229306,5,B003YGSLAI,"I know that the Baby Einstein company as taken a lot of heat for making videos that babies love, because parents leave their childern in front of the tv all day. Although this is not the fault of Baby Einstein, but the fault of those parents that abuse the product, this is a fantastic solution! My son loves the books or flash cards that come with the Discovery kit, and I love watching the joy that he gets from this great learning experience. The CD's are absolutly great for in the car. Like many babies, my son will fall alseep during a car ride when all else fails, and these soundtracks are perfect for putting him down to sleep.

Keep up the great work Baby Einstein!",1294272000,6,675,4.357142857142857

8409259,3,B003YGSLAI,"Having previously purchased a B. E. DVD (Baby Beethoven) which messmerized our 1 year-old granddaughter, our expectations were very high. Wild Animal Safari simply is not captivating, with too little in the way of good photography and stories to capture our granddaughter's attention. However the music is very good, and our little one loves to dance to it.",1387152000,,357,5.172413793103448
8409260,5,B003YGSLAI,"My grandson 21-month-old LOVES these, as do the toddlers in the homeless shelter I manage. Very intelligently done, inspiring little ones to ask questions, learn about animals, appreciate classical music, etc. Does a great job of ""grouping"" photos, videos, and stylized drawing/cartoons of each animal, so toddlers realize it's all the same animal, as well as showing them in their native habitat, doing natural things.",1386115200,,419,5.461538461538462

8409262,5,B003YGSLAI,"My Grandson loves this.  Really reaches a one year old.  Love it.  We watch it together and talk about the animals and the sounds they make.  Just like anything a child watches, it should be a tool to learning not a babysitter.",1369267200,,227,4.333333333333333
8409263,3,B003YGSLAI,"My daugher loves the baby einstein world animals video. This one has a few of the same scenes as the world animals video, but overall she's not a huge fan. She likes the music but that's pretty much it. I would recommend a different video for babies.",1367539200,,250,4.340425531914893
