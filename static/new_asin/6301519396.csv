8168347,4,6301519396,"This retrospective covers performances from the 1930's through the 1980's.  A number of selections are very short and start or finish at illogical  points.  However, the performances themselves are very good.
The first 7  excerpts are from various performances of Sleeping Beauty.  The artists  include Liudmila Semenyaka and Alexander Vetrov, Maya Plisetskaya and  Nikolai Fadeyechev, Raisa Struchkova, Ekaterina Maximova and Vladimir  Vasiliev.  This is followed by a group of ""historical clips,""  dating from the '30s to the '60s.  The highlights of this section for me  were (1) Galina Ulanova and Fadeyechev in the first act of Giselle and (2)  a variation from Laurencia performed by Plisetskaya.  This is my favorite  solo of hers, as it is what she did best:  big leaps, broad movements,  Spanish flavor.
Next is a group of excerpts from Romeo and Juliet, again  with various casts:  Maximova, Plisetskaya, Ulanova and Mikhail Gabovich,  Natalia Bessmertnova and Mikhail Lavrovsky.  The final group of excerpts is  from Don Quixote, with Nina Ananiashvili, Plisetskaya, Nadezhda Pavlova and  Vyacheslav Gordeyev, and Maximova and Vasiliev.
What's most unusual about  this tape is the excerpts from the 1983 Asaf Messerer Gala.  Messerer  (Plisetskaya's uncle) was a principal dancer with the Bolshoi, which he  joined in the 1920's.  Upon his retirement from the stage, he spent many  years as a teacher and ballet master at the Bolshoi school.  This section  opens with the members of the company, onstage but in practice clothes,  doing plis at the barre at Messerer's direction.  (The somewhat distorted  positions of some of the dancers brought back memories of a Kirov training  film I saw in the late '60s.  Unlike the method my teachers used--starting  with your body correctly aligned and only then increasing your turnout and  extension--the Bolshoi/Kirov method starts by forcing your feet into a  perfect 180-degree turnout, or getting your leg all the way to the side in   la seconde, and only then working to get your alignment as correct as  possible, a method that can only succeed when you have the best bodies to  work with--which, of course, the major Russian schools do.)  Later the  company members, still in practice clothes, perform solos from various  ballets.  The soloists include Alla Mikhalchenko, Andris Liepa, Semenyaka,  Vetrov, Ananiashvili, Yuri Vasyuchenko, Maximova, and Vasiliev, who even  this late in his career was amazingly energetic and charismatic.  Nina  Timofeyeva, in 1983 much older than most of the soloists, performs  admirably with a very clean technique, giving a good idea of the powerful  dancer she must have been in her youth.  The section closes with a  slow-motion film of Messerer (famous for his elevation) in his youth.
The  editing is irksome, but the excellent performances and especially the  Messerer tribute make this video a great buy.",968889600,16,2907,5.265934065934066
