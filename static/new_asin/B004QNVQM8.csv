8438328,2,B004QNVQM8,"This documentary is mostly about the P-2 Neptune aircraft, developed by Lockheed for the US Navy as Maritime patrol aircraft and later, converted by Lockheed for use by the CIA covert operations in Eastern Europe and China between late 50s and early 60s.
Very little footage about Lockheed U-2 and Blackbird SR-71.",1472342400,2,314,5.0576923076923075
8438329,5,B004QNVQM8,"The practice of aerial spying goes a long way back a little over 100 years before fixed wing aircraft were used in World War 1, but the Russo-American Cold War saw the development of reconnaissance planes reach unprecedented heights. The SR-71 and U-2 may have represented the pinnacle of spy plane development during the Cold War, pushing the limits of the performance of air-breathing fixed wing aircraft in speed and altitude, but they were just two of a handful of Cold war photo-reconnaissance aircraft, some which never left the drawing board.

The Bell X-16 and Convair Kingfish were two such projects. The X-16 was supposed to be the first dedicated spy plane for the USAF, but its development was sabotaged by the emergence of the U-2 and Bell was nearing completion of the first X-16 when the project was axed. The Convair Kingfish too was promising in terms of invincibility, but the Air Force wooed the CIA to reject the Kingfish in favor of the Lockheed Archangel-12 (precursor of the Blackbird) because Convair was grappling with technical snags that plagued the B-58 supersonic bomber and it did not wish to see the Kingfish suffer the same technical difficulties and cost overruns as the Hustler. Nevertheless, the Kingfish is the closest we came to designing an NASP-like spyplane during the Cold War, with its triangular shape and engines buried in the rear fuselage.

With respect to the D-21 supersonic UAV, it is interesting to note that the Tupolev Design Bureau worked on a project to reverse-engineer the D-21, relying on a D-21 that crashed in Siberia after veering off course during a spy mission over the Lop Nur nuclear weapon test site in Xinjiang, China. It was named the Voron after the Russian word for ""Raven"", and it was intended to be launched over US territory by either the Tu-95 or the forthcoming Tu-160, just as the D-21 was to be launched from the B-52 over enemy territory. But the Voron never made it off the drawing board for unknown reasons, and today, Russia has no dedicated photo-reconnaissance aircraft that can fly beyond 70,000 feet (the Myasishchev M-17 that could fly above 70,000 feet failed to emerge as a spy plane and ended up becoming an environmental research platform).

In the age of unmanned air vehicles, the U-2 is the only manned photo-reconnaissance plane still flying today, with around 30 aircraft in active service. But the U-2s flying today differ from the older Dragon Lady's in having newer engines and were built during the 1980s, when the Cold War was on the wane. With the deployment of the Global Hawk and Sentinel UAVs, the USAF has announced plans to starting retiring the U-2s in 2015, 60 years after the U-2's maiden flight. In the meantime, the Global Hawk, Sentinel, and now the RQ-180 have taken over many of the photo-reconnaissance duties left vacant by the retirement of the SR-71 and potentially the U-2 (not to mention that rumors of a hypersonic replacement for the SR-71 that surfaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s have been dismissed as either untrue or based on a research plane to test technologies for hypersonic flying machines in the Mach 3 to 4 range). It may be a matter of years before the USAF fully transitions its spy plane fleet into one of UAVs.",1411344000,,3253,4.815742397137746
8438330,5,B004QNVQM8,I was hoping to see more of the sr71 seeing that I worked on it back in the early 60s,1398124800,3,85,3.3
