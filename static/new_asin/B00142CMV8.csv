3121826,4,B00142CMV8,"I've watched this. It was amusing. Especially Oburi because unlike the Original Urotsukidoji - the camera angle focuses in A LOT more on Oburi than supposedly ""the main character"" and I do like that for a change. It makes it very fun and interesting. The camera focuses so much on Oburi that I thought he was the main character of this film, which he is basically, based on what I've seen.

What I didn't like about this anime, was the sex scenes actually, not that I don't appreciate hentai in general, but this anime's version was just boring. Like it got to the point where I had to skip the sex-scenes just so I could actually watch the main-storyline, except for like one scene...but that was it! I honestly looked a whole lot forward to the main storyline in this anime rather than the sex-scenes ironically...but that's just me.

Compared to the Original series, I enjoyed the original series much better than this because it did a much better job of tying in the sex and violence and giving each other purpose. In this New series, not-so-much, except for a few scenes.

My recommendation: If you do watch this, try and just watch it for the sake of the main storyline and not focus too much on the sex-scenes because they don't have too much to do with the actual story. If you can do that, it just might turn out to be a decent anime for you.",1332374400,4,1351,4.439516129032258
3121827,4,B00142CMV8,Good story but it could have been a bit longer with a better ending in my opinion.  I think it is worth purchasing if you love your anime but wait until you can get at a goog price.,1329868800,5,181,3.763157894736842
3121828,3,B00142CMV8,"I won't lie to you and say that I don't watch these forms of anime for aesthetic reasons beyond the plot or characters or attention to detail. Yet, chances are if you watch a series like Urotsukidoji then no matter what, all of the above will always apply to whatever aesthetic reason you watch a tastily demented series like this one for because Urotsukidoji has always had a blend of good plot, superb attention to detail and... well okay, good characters at best coupled with some astounding sexual themes and violence.

I forever feel though that the biggest problem with the series was the latter two - sex and violence - are always (and I mean ALWAYS) needlessly tied to each other just because Urotsukidoji was the first hentai to do so and the writers feel it wouldn't be the same without it. The problems with that however are numerous. For one: the tying between the two is totally unnecessary, two: they leave a very bad impression on casual viewers and three: they end up evoking more empathy for the young fictional women designed solely for scenes where they're sexually assaulted and horribly murdered rather than the actual named characters we're supposed to care about.

This is the biggest problem with New Saga though: there's virtually no point to any of the demon sex scenes story or event-wise and even worse is that what little demon sex there is - despite the scenes being surprisingly well drawn and scripted and artistically interesting - are all so contrived and unbelievable in their climaxes that there are insurmountable technical flaws in every scene: each incident goes overlooked by the general public and for the most part initiate immense, unresolved plot holes and the scenes themselves are inundated with blatant continuity errors. The second part of this collection in particular was riddled with so many plot holes, factual errors and continuity errors tied to the sex in the episode that I kept asking myself why they even had it. Seriously, what do the Japanese dislike about over-sexed demons impregnating the women they encounter rather than mutilating them; I know it's still morally wrong, but is that really any worse than the monster horribly injuring and murdering them? What did women ever do to them??

There's this notion that it all destroys the viewer's comfort level, but when ever hentai copies hentais like Urotsukidoji by tacking on needless gore, violence and misogyny to otherwise surprisingly well drawn and interesting sex scenes, then you can't help but ask who the animators are REALLY making these series for. If I really wanted to see lots of unconvincing gory deaths I'd pop in an Italian zombie flick; at least then I'll stumble into the occasionally good art direction.

But all right, I might as well talk about the other reasons why you'd watch this. The plot is quite heavy in parts. As far as Urotsukidoji episodes go this is definitely the most dramatic and New Saga earns plenty of points in the drama department because the characters conflict with each other on a minutely basis. Of course like most hentais, the characters are weighed down by their hubris and some of the characters will end up falling so hard into their common archetype it's not even funny. There's the average nihilistic anti-hero who won't do anything to help others unless it benefits himself, there's the nerdy and perverted but good hearted hero with some arbitrary designation to become destroyer of the Earth (yes it's obvious, I'm not spoiling anything for you) and then there's that one sweet, gentle girl who always ends up being horribly wronged by someone and decides to fall in love with the worst possible character. Development does arise from this series though and it's hard not to attach yourself to the characters, despite one of them transforming into a very detestable scaly death-rapist.

The plot on the other hand is basic at best. It's pretty much a rehash of the original Urotsukidoji only with the addition of a secret society that's bent on seeking out and destroying the destroyer of the Earth rather than find and venerate him not knowing the truth about him. Only problem is, their search for said destroyer almost always results in some of the faultiest actions any militant secret organization could do. This is the kind of secret organization where collateral damage is a must for them. Half way through I kept expecting everyone in the organization to just drop dead I hated them that much.

Like most anime, New Saga has its share of quirky dialogue the blue haired woman on the cover actually has a voice that fits the physical appearance of the character in that she sounds like she would be infested with fleas just like how the character looks (seriously, her hair looks like a blue shag carpet), but some of the dubbing is actually pretty good especially with characters like Ozaki; whoever did the English voice for Ozaki in this sounds REALLY good! Of course, sometimes the dubbing can be silly. I clearly remember a moment where an innocent young female character had her mouth full of, um... 'manhood,' yet the instant her face was off screen the voice actress started inserting lines yet no indication was made that the character's mouth wasn't full at the time, nor was this consistent with the Japanese dialogue.

The music is okay at best. It's really geared more toward drama because dramatic moments and themes sound genuinely tragic and heart-wrenching. Sometimes the anime will just recycle songs from the first Urotsukidoji and insert them in moments that hardly even fit.

The animation is the real mixed bag here though because in general the animation is very nice. The character models are fresh and well detailed, shading and lighting is excellent, but the needless addition of CG animation segments and continuity are so broken, so ill-concieved that it eternally marks the animation of this series as one of the worst hentais ever animated; I've seen quite a number of hentai, A LOT (I'll be honest), but I've never seen a hentai as broken as this one.

I'm serious, objects will appear dangerously close in one shot and will reappear as comfortably far away in the next, objects will pass through fences but you won't see them through the fence, characters will be seen wearing different clothes in CG segments and destroyed clothes will just reappear, nipple rings, pubic hair even bodily parts will magically disappear and reappear on characters... It just goes on.

I was actually corrected when I accused this anime for using blood play severely out of context: the first time I saw it I found it so pretentious I thought it was just the animator's last minute attempt at throwing in cheap smut for the sake of turning off the audience. In retrospect, the blood play actually made sense (as irritatingly stupid as it was), but there's still the matter that it wasn't used when it blatantly should've been in the third part of the OAV; the stinger here is that the third scene involved a virgin! None of this could ever be overlooked in any way.

To be honest, this is hard to recommend. I'd say get it cheap, but chances are that won't be the case.",1210550400,16,7160,4.841503267973856
3121829,3,B00142CMV8,"When I first purchased this movie, I was thinking that it would be a new age version of its predecessor. I was correct, but there were a bit changes in the plot that I don't want to spoil for you.

The storyline was interesting, a miniature love story, though it's questionable if you can love someone who has raped you...(just a small hint).

No, Amano Jyaku's red-blooded sister isn't in it ::sigh::.

You will still love Amano Jyaku, but I think he is cooler in the other ""Legend Of The Overfiend"" works.

The ending was good, but it makes you wish there was more to it. Like you ask yourself the age-old, ""What happens next?""

It's still a good trilogy, one that any fan should own. It won't put you to sleep. But you'll find that it could have been better...

8254068,2,B00142CMV8,"The infamous anime tale of a Demon being born to destroy the world returns in the worst form possible. The original was grotesque, deviantly beautiful in its monster designs, and epic in scale. (Seriously, you have to see it to believe it. It's like 10 commandments with tentacles.) This version is animated poorly. On top of there being a very low frame count in this anime, most of the drawings and character designs themselves look simplistic and terrible. The violence itself is toned down and the sex is more standard with only one scene actually channeling the classic Overfiend feel. It's 3 disks long with about an hour on each one. It focuses more on Amano and some friend of Overfiend who is cured of cancer by his blood. Not that it matters much, the story is forgettable and the violence and sex are poorly animated, not shoking, or erotic. There is also really poor CGI animation which makes the demon world look like a Playstation1 game instead of the depictions from the original Overfiend which gave you nightmares for years and influenced all anime and games since then. Buy it if you absolutely must, but it ends in the same clifhanger and I really rather not see anymore.",1431993600,,1190,4.698564593301436

8254072,2,B00142CMV8,"This is more or less a complete rewrite of the saga.  The basic plot, finding the Overfiend, is still there, but almost everything else, including the characters, have been replaced or rewritten, except possibly for Amanojyaku and his henchman.  The story itself is a little more complex, and the characters are a little deeper.  Most importantly, it tends to be less misogynistic than the original, with more women playing stronger and more important roles in the story.

Except for a couple of scenes in part 3, the animation is somewhat better than the original, with computer animation added.  Many of the explicit scenes were at least as violent and unpleasant for the females involved, though there was one that was actually pretty funny (and non-violent), believe it or not.

The biggest problem I had with this is that it's not complete.  It ended essentially right at the climax, so you never know what are the results of the various story lines.  For that reason alone, I rated it below average.  If you don't care about the story lines, then you can give it an extra 1-1 1/2 stars.",1348876800,14,1092,4.76595744680851
