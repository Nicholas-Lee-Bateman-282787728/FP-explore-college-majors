8330329,1,B001OBT3DO,A total insult to WAGNER and those of us who want traditional Opera sets - In the right time zone at least. If I could give one star I would. I wish they woul dbring out the old Met version with Gothic sets on blue ray and give us all a break.,1490140800,,243,3.6923076923076925

8330331,1,B001OBT3DO,"I've only been a fan of Wagnerian opera since the 1950s, when I saw my first production of The Flying Dutchman, at the original Met. That was a place and that was the way to produce an opera.
The quality of the singing, in this revisionist version, is the only thing which keeps me from giving it a MINUS 5!
Where to begin? I guess the beginning of the opera is the best place. Those familiar with the Paris version, will remember the ballet. In this version, that ballet has been converted, into what, at best, may be described as a modern-jazz version of sperm, swirling and fornicating, around a double-spiral staircase, apparently meant to represent DNA's double helix, while only half of it is rotating and, in the center of it, is an almost comatose Venus, who appears to be completely oblivious to what is happening around her.
The remainder of the staging is dull and monotonous. After that, I didn't think it could get any worse. Well, was I in for a surprise!
I almost fell off my chair, laughing, when the Minstrels made their first appearance, all in cardinal-red ""suits,"" no two of which were alike but all of which appear to have been stolen, from the Wizard of Oz's Munchkins. I kept expecting to see the ""horse of a different color"" make an appearance.
Later, in the singing contest, we're treated to a reappearance of the Minstrels, this time in gold lam, completely reminiscent of ""The Jersey Boys."" When the Minstrels pick up a microphone, of the type used in the 1940s~50s, then get on a stage, which is circular, raised and bottom-lit, like something appropriate to a 1960s-era, sleazy, lounge act, they embarrassed not only themselves but anyone who was watching this abortion.
Then, of course, we have the Pilgrim's March. This piece of music is supposed to be enthralling, uplifting and, if properly performed, should run a shiver down your spine. Not only was it substantially shortened, in overall length but it was absolutely the most timid presentation thereof I've ever heard.
Hopefully, this opera version will be sufficient proof that Nikolaus Lehnhoff (Director) should never be allowed near an operatic stage, except bound, gagged and in the company of armed guards and, even then, restricted to the audience side of the house, then transported, immediately after the performance, to the nearest padded room, to expound the rest of his miserable ideas there.
Gee, I'm glad I didn't speak my mind, about this performance. I might have said something which would offend the director, the producers and the Met.",1380672000,3,2541,4.8436781609195405
8330332,1,B001OBT3DO,"I have been informed that there is an import tax costing another 12.84.  It is bring returned to you unopened and I have re-ordered it from Amazon.co.uk, where I can purchase it for the price quoted, thank you.",1380672000,,210,4.526315789473684
8330333,4,B001OBT3DO,"In defense of post-modern productions I try to show here what I believe this one adds to our thinking and feeling.
Other reviewers show more musical background and sophistication than I have, but visual expression now has so much complexity it requires another lifetime of study, and that is my background.
As I think we all know, Wagner can inflate nonsense and is laughed at when he does. Remember Melchior's ""When is the next swan?"" and his description of himself and an equally large soprano coming together like two blimps. In The Mikado a punishment to fit a crime is to ""listen to sermons by mystical Germans"".
When we look at photos of Wagnerian costumes circa 1900 we can't really take them seriously. The first costumes for the Ring had to create a Germanic mythical world with no visual examples. so they clothed the heroes in fur, leather, and Roman bronze hamlets (to steal a malapropism from Dizzy Dean). A recent German Ring makes fun of Sigfried's return to battle by having him strap fur to his legs and put on Brunhilde's armor, brass breasts and all.
The story of Tannhauser is so childish a paperback romance writer might blush to use it. (He deserts the arms of Venus to return to a pure and holy love, is rejected by his community for his great sin, becomes a pilgrem to Rome seeking redemption, feels rejected there, returns to the pure and holy Elizabeth, who dies, goes to heaven and miraculously saves Tannhauser.)

Wagner's music on the other hand is still profoundly serious and moving, and he can create intense and realistic personal expression for his characters.
This production integrates post-modern skepticism about pretentious authority and  appreciation of personal feelings.
The set is beautiful to look at and the changing colored lights and colored costumes create beautiful tableaux. The set functions as a sculptural spiral that is impressive but neutral in allowing a fairytale world to transition to real and personal space.
Other viewers seem to have taken the first scenes totally seriously and have seen absurd costumes as attempts to be willfully different. (This kind of willfulness can  appear in recent Met productions, like their Ring, which seems to me to try to be different in a big but amateurish way, imitating the appearance but not the spirit of European productions.)
First to appear on stage are dancers in skin tight costumes with bodies distorted into toys with Popeye calves and feet. (Something like the Pilabolus troop.) Their toy and insect movements turn more and more to sexual contortions around Venus, brightly lit in a 17th century Spanish court dress and a large wig. Tannhauser appears in an absurd long coat stolen from The Matrix. After some stationary singing, Venus simply walks out of the bottom of her dress, which stands there until later when Venus uses it for a bed.
By this time it is clear that Venusburg is not being taken seriously, but is presented as a cartooned  fairytale concept.
Venus takes off her wig and sings beautifully and seriously with Tannhauser to end the act.
Tannhauser returns home to a male community in absurd red coats, part Nutcracker, part Flash Gorden to Startrek, and part monkey from the Wizard of Oz. From then on most costumes have a mix of reality and absurd fairy-tale. For instance, another reviewer laughed out loud when the essentially comic candidates in the singing contest appear in metallic gold suits, part tin man and part Munchkin. By this time in the third act most
of the now crowded stage is occupied by exaggerated costumes. Elizabeth, however is not caricatured, except as pure and pretty. The groupings are beautiful to look at, and grouped together appear more real and appropriate.
The reality of feeling grows as Tannhausser's sin is revealed. Individual grief and angry crowds morph into real people and real impact of ostracism. The combination of staging and beautiful music is powerfully affecting.
The last act isolates Tannhauser, returned after failure in Rome, mostly alone or with another person in an empty dark space. Personal torment is  presented realistically, and if the miracle is absurd, that's Wagner's problem.
To reiterate, what is absurd fairytale and what is real personal feeling is presented visually in a consistently integrated form that is transformed from first act to last.

 Another reviewer praises another production by this director. I think I'll check it out.

 A note on ""eurotrash"". The word is meant to describe rich and vacuous jet-setters. No reviewer here is using it, but it appears often in criticism of modern and post-modern productions. The great art historian Leo Steinberg has pointed out in ""Other Criteria"" that new art with new criteria causes feelings of loss of what existed before. The loss leads to angry and defensive attacks (again, not in the other reviews here). Remember that Wagner wanted to upset everything.
Myself, I wish there was a great traditional Ring, and I think that the Met DVDs are the best attempt. Modern, I like the Barenboim Beyreuth. Post-modern, Madrid.",1333843200,7,5069,4.989349112426035
8330334,3,B001OBT3DO,"It is an OK production. The set is supposed to be simple. But it really distracts from the real issue, Tannhauser internal contradictions and striving for meaning in his life. His search takes him to three different places that have very specific meaning, hell, earth and paradise, but you can't get that from the staging. Interestingly, the premier of this opera was not well received. The sets had not arrived yet. For the second and third night the sets were completed, and it was much better received and applauded. It says something about the importance of an appropriate production.  The futuristic, kind of star war costumes, don't mean anything, at least to me. It seems that the producer wanted to show that Tannhauser's conflict is not only for the 13th century, as Wagner libretto is written for, but it is the same conflict now and in the future. The production does not succeed in conveying that message. The Blu-ray disc has a 7.1 Audio channel. That is great, but there are so many times when the voice is lost, in particular when singers move to the back of the stage, that it becomes annoying. In addition, the noise created by actors stepping into the stage (on wood) is disturbing. I would expect better sound engineering when HD Audio 7.1 is used.
The singers and orchestra do a very good job so, if you know this opera from before, you will enjoy it. If this is your first encounter with Tannhauser, start somewhere else, another DVD or CD or lecture.",1285977600,3,1472,4.683397683397684
8330335,1,B001OBT3DO,"I agree fully with the first reviewer (from Minneapolis).  Why these pervert producers who arbitrarily and capriciously ignore the composer's libretto is something I never hope to fully understand.

What's worse is that I actually met an operagoer after a Wagner performance who actually LIKED this idiocy.

I believe in my heart of hearts that these trashers actually hate opera and Wagner in particular, and this is how they 'get even'.  I remember reading just that after Seattle joined the party one fateful year and trashed a 'Ring' cycle - they admitted the producer said he 'hated Wagner'.

I hope I have made myself perfectly clear.  This production and most if not all other modern ones are abortions.",1263686400,6,710,4.97457627118644
8330336,2,B001OBT3DO,"There are three major faults with this production: The Robotic ballet, the Elisabeth part sung by Nylund, and the synthetic sound quality.

We agree that the set, staging, costumes, the lighting, the staircase that dominates the set, all are quite interesting and pleasing to the eye.
But this alone does not make an opera 'stand'.
We take issue with the notion that some viewers (on the UK site) expressed the opinion that singing throughout is excellent, in particularly I take the notion expressed there that Camilla Nylund is a well sung Elisabeth.
No, she is NOT.
Camilla Nylund is grossly misplaced here.
Although a young looking face, the singer's voice sounds 'old', wasted, faded, and `bleached-off' - it lacks youth-tone and sparkle the way the roll of Elisabeth asks for.
Nylund voice in this setting is terrible wobbly and the top notes are white flat...Moreover:
most of her registers are wobbly; her technique is to take the notes FROM UNDER THE PITCH (something the Russian old school of singing teaches); This sort of vocal behavior does not add to a Wagnerian voice's being 'voluminous' at all...! One has to listen to other signers that capture this roll to understand how Nylund's obsolete technique hinders her from getting it right. Especially painful is her opening aria ""Dich, teure Halle"". Listening to it one admits that a great singer this Nylund is not.
This mediocre singing is very disturbing through all of the recording.
As for the rest of the singers they earned here top notch, especially Venus as portrayal by Waltraud Meier; now this is a voice to recon with...A rare breed of a voice it is, one that easily crosses over between the Mezzo-soprano range and the soprano range (one should hear - and see her - on the Metropolitan Levine 25 anniversary DVD where she singes the most difficult part of the Isolde narration, to appreciate what this singer's voice is all about (or more precisely what it used to be).
We are, however, aware now that she is nearing the end of her singing career, as very occasionally that voice too begins to show singes of bleach-ness at the middle register and the highest notes are a bit truncated. Still - this is a minor observation (her acting is great, though...
And mind you: we are a group of five persons that spent years as singer's trainers, singers, musician and a previous prima-ballerina...This brings us to the first act, what was supposed to be a ballet:
No one here could understand the logic or the artistic drive behind the choreography of the robot-cocoon-like figures. The ballet was quite boring and it serves no purpose, so why?
The interview with the choreographer does very little to broaden our understanding - it just might well be a case of his self-trip semi-consciousness, some idea he had, and idea that was not fully thought out but which that amounts to nothing with that `ballet' choreography.
Also: The interviews with the other participants of this production (the bonus part on the DVD) does not add  to the understanding of the efforts they put into it. By telling us what their perspective is, they add nothing to the `story'.
Well cleverly was the reaction of Waltraud Meier: She simply ignored the crew - went her way and just commented: I have been singing this roll some twenty years ago. (Compliments Mrs. Meier - when the questions are stupid, do not respond).

The cinematography is good and the stairs decor and costumes are stupendous.
If it was not for Nylund (Elisabet's roll), the cocoon ballet, and for the overall synthetic sound - the voting points given would have been quite higher.
As it is, someday, another Blu-ray production with a higher standard of singing, better sound recording and a more traditional-logically ballet choreography will come along.
As things are right now - this Blu-ray deserves only two points.",1258502400,9,3840,4.868501529051988
8330337,2,B001OBT3DO,"There is a temptation to lay blame for the production's flatness on its visual monotony: with variation only in the lighting scheme, all three acts are staged on one unadorned, architecturally modern set with a winding staircase at its center. Raimund Bauer's design resembles nothing so much as the lobby of a place where one might go to *hear* a performance of TANNHUSER, that is, a music hall erected in the 1980s or later. In fact, even though director Nikolaus Lehnhoff seems to have consciously foresworn ""atmosphere"" in the traditional sense, his production might have succeeded in spite of its austerity. The redemption of the same director's controversial post-apocalyptic PARSIFAL (on Opus Arte DVD, conducted by Kent Nagano) was, for me, its detailed consideration of a group of psychologically complex individuals; the director's and actors' alertness to those people's personal torments and sorrows, the eccentricities of milieu notwithstanding. In this TANNHUSER, recorded in 2008 at Baden-Baden, Lehnhoff's imagination and initiative have largely deserted him. There is little here that even could be called distinctive, beyond the deliberate vagueness as to time (the costumes span from standard medieval garb to shiny gold sci-fi suits for the Minnesingers in Act II) and the symbolic sexlessness of the pink-bodysuited dancers in the Venusberg scene (they resemble mannequins or mummies). Elsewhere, the opera's subject matter seems to have cowed Lehnhoff into hackneyed mythical one-dimensionalisms, and the lameness trickles down to the cast, who do not so much ""act"" as display a series of unconvincing attitudes and postures. Their singing is not well served by that unvarying set, which creates the kind of wide-open, reverberant tin-box acoustic that is vocal kryptonite to singers. It conspires with close and harsh miking to magnify every vocal imperfection, and there are many to magnify.

The male principals fare least well. Roman Trekel's baritone never settles into steady tone; hardly a sustained note from this Wolfram passes without wide, uncomfortable oscillations. Robert Gambill's dark, almost baritonal Tannhuser does not provide ideal contrast with Trekel, but this matters less than his ungainly phrasing and often strained production -- the role is so strenuous qua vocalism that he is hamstrung in his interpretation; there is little more than a generalized passion. There is no finer actress on the world's operatic stages than Waltraud Meier, but Venus is not a role that taps into what she does best (for a recent sample of *that*, see her scarifying Isolde on the  Barenboim/Chreau/Scala DVD issued by Virgin). Though Meier makes a dignified and alluring appearance, and almost anyone else would have looked much more foolish modeling the silly hairpiece forced on her in both Act I and Act III, the role is both too brief and too thin to give her the dimension with which to display her dramatic gifts. This leaves only the singing, and even Meier's admirers (of which I am one) never went to her for creamy, opulent vocalism. The best performance is given by Camilla Nylund as Elisabeth. What she is asked to do is no more or less boring than what the others are asked to do, but her instrument easily encompasses the role's demands, she is appropriately sympathetic and modest in bearing, and she comes closer than anyone else to battling the twin torture chambers of the set and the engineering to a standstill.

The young conductor Philippe Jordan goes in for some eccentric balances in the Overture that are not always agreeable to the ear. In particular, he lets his brass get unruly; someone hearing this piece for the first time would miss a lot of detail. Thereafter, as if his ""moment"" has passed and now the show must be turned over to the singers, Jordan seems to recede into a slick, casual routine. He never seems engaged in a true collaboration of musical phrasing with the singers. The Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin has been heard in better form elsewhere in recent years (such as, again, the Lehnhoff PARSIFAL DVD). Expectations were high, and there was certainly room at the top in the TANNHUSER DVD field, but this will not occupy it. The default choice at the moment remains the Colin Davis/Bayreuth/DG affair with Gwyneth Jones on double duty as Venus and Elisabeth. For consistently great singing, go audio (Solti/Decca; Sinopoli/DG).",1247356800,13,4410,5.182328190743338
8330338,3,B001OBT3DO,"I am trying read hard not to act my age and keep wishing these new modern opera productions would go away.  After all, opera should be great singing AND great theater. This DVD of TANNHAUSER has great singing by people who look their parts.  I'll start with Tannhauser - Robert Gambill.  He's riveting and his singing never weakens in a roll that requires stamina and great vocal resources.  He's especialy exciting in the song contest scene when he's watching and listening in frustration to the other contestants.  You can almost hear him thinking ""No! No! That's not the way it goes!"" Camilla Nylund (no young maiden) as Elisabeth is a great match for Gambill.  And to complete the trio we have a Venus (Ms Meier) with expereince to spare.  Moving these strong vocals along is conductor Philippe Jordan.  As far as the production goes - directed by Nikolaus Lehnfoff - you will see the same set for all three acts.  It consists of a huge winding staircase that spins around the stage at will.  By the middle of Act Two I was tired of the thing.  Without any major scene changes, you don't get the feeling of coming from the decadence of ""Venusberg"" and into the sterile world of the castle and finally into the redemption mode of the last act.  I had one moment of uncontrolled levity when the six song contestants came out dressed like grasshoppers in gold suits! This costume goof should have been caught and eliminated.  I recently saw the very old production of TANNHAUSER at the Metropolitan Opera and it was like viewing a beautiful impressionistic painting.  Took my breath away.  I shall go back to this DVD simply to hear a youthful Tannhauser and a mature Elisabeth singing in top form.",1237420800,21,1699,4.673400673400673
