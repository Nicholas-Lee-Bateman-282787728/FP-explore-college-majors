8539438,5,B009BLMT8K,"Johnterryl Plumeri is an accomplished and masterful musician - a talented composer and conductor and a bass player unequaled in his generation. He is the only American composer to conduct the Moscow Philharmonic performing Tchaikovsky. Note he has memorized the score! It often takes a century for a musician or an artist or a writer to be truly appreciated.  In this digital age, I hope this is not the case.  This man's compositions and contribution to music, need to be heard now by people longing for the sophistication and emotional honesty that music offers.  You will want all his work once you hear what he has to give.",1362182400,,627,4.787037037037037
8539439,5,B009BLMT8K,"One starts out with feeling this should be special - Tchaikovsky played by the Moscow Philharmonic at Tchaikovsky Hall in Moscow - but you should be prepared to be dazzled!

Whether you treat yourself to this DVD or someone treats you with it you receive so much within this one small package: You have a composer with infinite respect for the music as written conducting Tchaikovsky's work with a superb orchestra. You have the pleasure of having a truly gifted composer/musician conduct his own work. You have the Moscow Philharmonic musicians responding to Plumeri's talent as a conductor and a composer. All this is combined into an elegant visual and audio experience.

Another remarkable aspect to Plumeri is that these talents lay across the musical spectrum - he has worked with greats in Jazz (his jazz CDs display his genius on the double bass - catch Blue in Green exhibiting his use of arco bass as the lead voice on a range of jazz standards) to his many film scores, to his chamber music, to his conducting. Plumeri is a man of many musical seasons/talents and we are delighted to have him available to all of us who love and appreciate music in all its many forms.",1355270400,,1179,4.690821256038648
8539440,5,B009BLMT8K,"I bought this video and have watched it several times. I was familiar with both the Tchaikovsky and Plumeri compositions, but was quite unprepared for the beauty and power of this particular performance.

Plumeri's conducting is understated, masterful, and uniquely effective. His musical accomplishments, composing two of these pieces, then conducting this entire concert from memory, is stunning.

The orchestra clearly loves playing with him and performs as if inspired by his partnership. Composer/conductor and orchestra combine completely, producing one of the most powerful concerts I have seen.

This performance of ""Windflower"" seems a sparkling river of inexpressible, unstoppable beauty. ""Pride of Baltimore,"" as played here, has a relentlessness, brilliance, and power that enlivens completely. Plumeri's deeply insightful revitalization of Tschaikovsky No. 5 showed me, for the first time, the full complexity and loveliness of this composition.

All of this music is conducted as only a world-class composer can do. Plumeri is one of this world's great musical minds. This revelatory performance is a gift, to all of us, of rare beauty.",1355184000,,1150,5.6686046511627906
8539441,5,B009BLMT8K,"This is a spectacular live performance by the Moscow Philharmonic beautifully filmed and recorded! This is a must have for anyone who is mesmerized watching the beautiful synchrony of an orchestra responding to the conductor's baton ...in this case conducted by Maestro Johnterryl Plumeri. The compositions ""The Pride of Baltimore"" and ""Windflower,"" both original works of the composer, are powerful and exquisite and the production quality of this DVD is superb! We're talking better than being in the front row at a grand concert hall (well maybe I WOULD like to be in the front row of a grand concert hall - but this is something to keep and enjoy over and over) - you stand beside the conductor and literally sit with the orchestra ...amazing and I wish more incredible performances like this were preserved so beautifully.",1352851200,,827,5.0
8539442,5,B009BLMT8K,"Watching Plumeri conduct shines a mirror on the soul of this remarkable musician.  You knew he was extraordinarily gifted, but could only imagine how open he must have been to---divine inflow.  This DVD unveils a kind of inspiration that looks like that.  There's such a purity here, a noble heart in a sacred place experience, a holiness.  It's like you're watching someone pray, a rare someone whose journey must have been difficult, but who has always remained steadfastly true to that which matters most---the music.

Johnterryl Plumeri and the Moscow Philharmonic Live at Tchaikovsky Hall in Moscow is beautiful, whirling with emotional complexity, a microcosm, life, an ordered dance of which we're all a part.  The bottom line is all Plumeri, real, honest---soul, body and mind in perfect harmony.  What a great opportunity to watch the maestro, whose work has been enriching the lives of his listeners for decades.",1351900800,,922,5.147651006711409
