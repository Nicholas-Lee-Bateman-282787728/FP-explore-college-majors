8020326,4,B000227RF2,"This is an animated special from the Rankin Bass studio, famous for their holiday specials such as Rudolph, Frosty, the Little Drummer Boy, and more. This one uses traditional cell drawn animation rather than their well special 3D ""Animagic"", which is their stop motion animation technique. The studio produced some very nice 2D films and TV shows as well.

The 60 minute plot in this one is a little slower than most of their animated shows, but it is enjoyable for the kids. The World War I story is told with the dogs from Pretzelshtein as the good guy characters, fighting against the evil cats led by Putzi, the evil spy Cata Hari, and the Captain Von Zipper. The cats kidnap Princess Sophi of Pretzelshtein. Famous flying ace the ""Red Baron"" is a good guy that who comes out of retirement and builds his own plane to save their princess. The story is full of Biplane ""dogfight"" battles, humor, and spies. Music by Maury Laws who wrote the songs for many of the Rankin/Bass specials.

This originally aired on December 9, 1972 on ABC television, as ""The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie."" The studio produced 4 movies for the series, including ""That Girl in Wonderland"", ""Willie Mays and Say-Hey Kid"", ""The Red Baron"", and ""Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters"".",1269561600,,1249,4.751152073732719

Prince Heinrich of Weinerburg (a Doberman) has eloped with the Princess Sophie of Pretzelheim. Their monarchial fathers have been enemies, and Sophie's dad demands her return and her  fiance's capture and sentencing. His request for ""all able-bodied men"" prompts the retired Red Baron (a blubbery old Great Dane) to board his old triplane, bringing along his ineffectual assistants,Putzi  (an inarticulate cat) and Schnitzel (a wheezing dachshund). Catahari is a prime suspect in plotting the elopement, but she ends up having the hots for the Baron. The Prince and Princess set things straight with their fathers, the two kings patch up their differences and become in-laws, and Catahari chases after the Baron into the end.
