6305551,5,B00IZ03YO6,Basically it was serious about showing new & unknown facts located in the real world portrayed by young folks!,1414886400,,110,4.842105263157895
6305552,1,B00IZ03YO6,The worse movie I've ever seen.,1407715200,,31,4.333333333333333
6305553,1,B00IZ03YO6,"There's no way to sugar coat it: this movie was terrible.  The acting was hilariously bad ""Hello, Police?"" and there was no historical validity to really any of it.  Also I couldn't figure out the accent on the female lead.  She sounded kind of Australian, but was supposedly from South Africa, but used a lot of British-isms...?  I was lost.  I could see this being the sort of movie that Mystery Science Theatre 3000 would have ripped on.

This doesn't even get into the part about the Freemasons being descendent from the Knights Templar (has never been proven) and also the Templars being ""goddess worshippers"" was really the moment where it jumped the shark.",1406160000,,663,4.771929824561403
6305554,1,B00IZ03YO6,"I think this movie was some kind of high school project or something given the horrible everything about it.  The acting  and dialog was what I would expect from some untrained high school students.  The story made little sense.  It was told terribly slowly, jumped around, had a nonsensical plot and was inaccurate historically on many counts.  I think the positive reviews were written by friends of the director or something.  Uck.  Wish I could get back the past 2 hours of my life.",1404000000,,486,4.714285714285714
6305555,5,B00IZ03YO6,"This thriller uses real events and artifacts to tell a tale of the very roots re: the  discovery in America. Christopher Columbus was  sort of a Johhny-Come-Lately in the discovery of America and this story fills in the portions of history you weren't told about in school regarding earlier explorations .  This book is based on a novel by David Brody-a past master at this type of historical fiction and the legends surrounding the Knights Templar. The original title of the book was ""The Cabal Of the Westford Knight"". He has had other novels since then and before this one.  I would strongly encourage you to follow this author and his Templar series. This screen play was faithful to the original novel and this work brings to life the historical props you can get out of your rocker after seeing the film or putting down the finished novel.",1402617600,,845,4.6891891891891895
6305556,4,B00IZ03YO6,The American Templars tells the story of two young and curious investigators who would stop at nothing in their quest to learn the truth about a historical artifact which seemed to prove that history as we know it is not true. In intriguing tale well told.,1399593600,,256,4.586956521739131
6305557,5,B00IZ03YO6,"After viewing this film I was left wanting to know more.  The landmarks, acting and directing we're first rate.  I hope there will be a sequel to continue the journey.",1396396800,,167,4.533333333333333
6305558,4,B00IZ03YO6,I really enjoyed this movie. It should be watched by anyone who loves East Coast historical mysteries. Fun and exciting.,1394755200,,120,5.05
6305559,5,B00IZ03YO6,"The creative camera work adds perspective to the historical hunt for truth. Any fans of ""National Treasure"" or ""The DaVinci Code"" should give this film a look and will appreciate the quest for knowledge.",1394755200,,203,5.0
8646694,5,B00IZ03YO6,"This movie is based off of the book ""Cabal of the Westford Knight"" by David Brody. It's a low-budget, independent film that I thoroughly enjoyed. David himself even has a cameo appearance in the movie!",1508803200,,201,4.771428571428571
8646695,2,B00IZ03YO6,"Fun fact: I was technically part of the cast. Our house was part of the set and I was about nine when this was in production. You can see my sister in one of the scenes, she is the one on a scooter in one scene. I was behind the tree and nobody could see me. Oh well. That said, this movie was very confusing and my nine year old mind found it hard to follow, and very boring. I'll probably re watch it sometime, but I really didn't like this.

The reason this isn't one star is that I can (1) say that I was in a movie and (2) got to sound the horn on an ambulance.
If you watch this, under the credits the Yao family is listed under special thanks. That's us.",1507852800,,661,3.860294117647059

8646697,2,B00IZ03YO6,How to take a fascinating bit of little-known history and turn it into a yawner? Make a terrible movie out of it. Save your time and read the non-fiction pieces.,1472342400,,161,4.4
8646698,1,B00IZ03YO6,never watched the whole thing forced to turn it off,1462406400,,51,4.2
8646699,5,B00IZ03YO6,"Excellent movie, great plot, covers a lot of history. Looking forward to a sequel.",1456876800,,82,4.928571428571429
8646700,3,B00IZ03YO6,"I watched this specifically to learn where the historical sites that this film uses are located.  So, I did learn about the various places, some of which are right in my back yard.  It is a source for various little-known ruins and petroglyphs in the U.S.  However, the premise of this film is very dubious.",1438992000,,307,4.545454545454546
8646701,1,B00IZ03YO6,We turned it off half way through.  Difficult to follow the plot and low production values.,1424390400,,91,4.6875

8646703,2,B00IZ03YO6,"This is a rather bad movie but occasionally the acting rises to an almost professional level. We enjoyed it because it's a local production - Westford is just a few towns away - and because some of the evidence (for European visitors prior to Columbus, to America) is grounded in good evidence. Of course the screenwriter felt compelled to go all Dan Brown on us and mash it all together into one incoherent plot - as well as writing himself into the role of playing himself (book author).

It was sort of fun and good for a few laughs, plus the local scenery.",1415836800,,560,4.436893203883495
