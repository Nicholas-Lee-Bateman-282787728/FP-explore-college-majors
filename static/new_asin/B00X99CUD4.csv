7166763,4,B00X99CUD4,"I love Wai Lana. These videos are a great workout. I took off one star because I really wish that she would actually demonstrate modified poses for people who are just starting out. She describes ways to modify them, but rarely shows those modifications. Some of these poses are really advanced. There are better videos for beginners.",1441411200,3,334,4.87719298245614
7166764,5,B00X99CUD4,"Beautifully done. Wai Lana is a brilliant teacher, who takes pains to guide the student, letting him or her know the benefit of each asana. She makes yoga accessible to the aficionado.",1440460800,3,184,4.78125

8715465,3,B00X99CUD4,"Although I love Wai Lana, her videos are kind of annoying.  I used to have her videos a long time ago and remember kind of liking them, so I decided to give them a try again.  What I do NOT like about her videos is right in the middle of a session she will bring out some sort of equipment that you need.  Like a chair, or make you go up against a wall or something.  Doing yoga in your living room, the last thing you need is to try to find a free wall...I have none.",1489881600,,468,3.7938144329896906
8715466,5,B00X99CUD4,"I look forward to doing these poses each morning. Even the ones I found difficult at first, I'm getting better at. I only do 2 or 3 a day, and I'm experiencing good results. Some of the poses feel really good & I find myself repeating them during the day. I have tried other yoga programs & classes in the past, but this is the only one that has become part of my life.",1469059200,,369,4.0
8715467,5,B00X99CUD4,Great yoga. Easy,1468627200,,16,4.666666666666667
8715468,5,B00X99CUD4,No one does a better job of making certain that you understand how the poses are to be completed as well as the benefits.  Many instructors of all exercise programs should study Wai Lana in order to learn the best way to teach!,1460419200,2,227,4.27906976744186
8715469,5,B00X99CUD4,"Love it. Best of all, I have a large collections of yoga DVDs but this trip pack is the only one by husband will do.",1458086400,,116,3.68
