6056466,5,B00G3L0NB6,I also had the pleasure of being able to go to the premier at John Hardin High School. I am so proud of all the people involved in making this film for the whole world to see the devastation and life changing effect drinking and driving can do to not only family and friends but a whole community!! This is a job WELL DONE!!! I hope anyone who watches will spread the word so that maybe no other will have to go down the road of our community... god be with all who were closely involved... I love you!!!,1383004800,3,504,4.101010101010101
6056467,5,B00G3L0NB6,My heart goes out to all of the families and friends that were impacted by this tragedy.  My prayers are with them all.,1382745600,7,119,4.173913043478261
6056468,5,B00G3L0NB6,Lucky enough to see this at a premier.  It is well made and focuses on a few of the families and how they reacted after the crash and where they are now.,1382572800,17,153,3.78125
6056469,5,B00G3L0NB6,"Wonderful documentary. Tragic and inspiring at the same time.
God is always on our side even it does not seem so; have faith.",1527638400,,125,4.478260869565218
6056470,5,B00G3L0NB6,"I don't remember this tragic incident. But when I saw this documentary it really made me sad of how these children and adults died and some survived by tragic burns. The drunk guy should've gotten life. Listening these survivors of their experiences of the incident, made me think how life is so precious. Taking life granted. What a great documentary.",1527552000,,352,4.883333333333334
6056471,3,B00G3L0NB6,"I would like to have said this was 4 or 5 stars, but I wouldn't know if it is, because the the idiot who did the closed captioning LITERALLY wrote "" (mumbles) "" every time they couldn't understand the interviewee's accents.  Seriously. I am honestly shocked that this is a frequent and ongoing problem with Amazon video.",1527552000,,320,4.614035087719298
6056472,5,B00G3L0NB6,"I was about these children's ages when this accident happened, and this was my first time hearing about it.
I was saddened and shaken by this accident and the sentencing of the drunk driving. That part pissed me off.",1527379200,,216,4.564102564102564
6056473,5,B00G3L0NB6,"If you want to know the facts of this accident I believe this is a good, balanced, documentary. I have driven by that sign a few times on my way from Michigan to Florida but I knew nothing about the cause of the incident. When watching this documentary I found myself immediately wondering about the fire. I can understand people needing to blame the drunk driver, but that's simply not the reality of why this was a tragedy and I think this documentary does a great job of pointing that out. It went over the facts of the case without allowing emotion to taint the truth, while still allowing victims to speak their personal truth as they see it, and didn't censor those who would blame that drunk driver even though the truth is that no one would have been injured had it just been the crash itself (except maybe the bus driver as there is no way to know).

As an aside, I don't feel sorry for the man who made the decision to drink and drive, but it does make me question our ability to objectively instead of emotionally look at a situation when it comes to ""justice"". The doc shows, the drunk driver's part in this tragedy, if judged on it's own, had very little impact, but he was judged as the man who lit the match and threw it into a tinderbox, while no one cared that the kids shouldn't have been put in a tinderbox in the first place when it came to his punishment. If the bus hadn't been a dry haystack waiting to burn I doubt he would have gotten half the sentence he got, so I just find that to be something this doc made me think about as well.",1527120000,,1559,4.231543624161074
6056474,5,B00G3L0NB6,This story will stay with you .  Well done.  I used to work for OJJDP and they do great work and I am glad to see they funded a video that opens eyes.,1526947200,,150,3.515151515151515

6056476,5,B00G3L0NB6,What a tragedy. If so many people weren't accepting of alcohol culture it would be easier to stiffen the laws. Bravo to all of those who have moved on  with their lives. Mahoney is still answerable to his Creator.,1526515200,,213,4.461538461538462
6056477,5,B00G3L0NB6,So many affected by this tragedy.  Thankful for a documentary that exhibits the consequences of poor decisions.,1526256000,,111,5.529411764705882
6056478,5,B00G3L0NB6,"Thanks is not a large enough word to convey my thoughts for the victims and families who contributed to making this film possible--but I just say it, anyway. Profound in every moment, like a testimony in church.",1525737600,,211,4.72972972972973
6056479,5,B00G3L0NB6,"What a moving documentary.  Such a preventable tragedy.  I was in tears by the end because of such a loss of life, but also by some of the surprising twists and turns the lives of the survivors took.",1525478400,,199,4.2105263157894735
6056480,1,B00G3L0NB6,"I don't understand how this has such good reviews. You can barely hear the people being interviewed because the sound effects and ""background music"" are so loud. It gave me a headache and I couldn't finish watching.",1523577600,2,215,4.837837837837838
6056481,4,B00G3L0NB6,"This deserves 5 stars but the music and sound was pretty sketchy.  However, do not let that stop you from watching this.  Hope it's being shown at every junior and senior high school at least once every few years so all kids can see it.  How appropriate that the women who ultimately became MADD spokesperson had a daughter who realized ""you may only have one chance"".  Share this with your pre-driving kids please.  Drunk driving has improved but is not gone.",1522368000,,460,4.62962962962963
6056482,5,B00G3L0NB6,"Wow, this was such a moving documentary about a horrific bus crash that resulted from someone deciding to drive drunk one night in Kentucky in May of 1988. Every single person on earth should see this movie as a given!!! A great start would be to show this film to every student in every school all over the world with NO exceptions!!! This is way too important of a subject NOT to have it be mandatory!!! I believe it could really save so many precious lives & make people think twice before thinking that they can handle the responsibility of driving a vehicle after having been drinking!!! I am profoundly impacted by this story of 27 beautiful lives that were so tragically taken from them & I just couldn't help but cry throughout as I was listening to all of the survivors & the families of the survivors & those, unfortunately, who lost their loved ones!!! These amazing lives who bore the brunt of such a terrible tragedy are such an inspiration!!! It is a tragedy that could have easily been avoided if the man that caused this horrific accident just would have stopped and thought more about himself & the dear precious lives that his disgraceful decision wound up causing, which subsequently took the lives of so many children that night, while forever changing the lives of those who, by the grace of God, survived it!!! I highly recommend this documentary for everyone to watch, I assure you, it will never leave your heart once you listen to everyone involved in the making of this all too important and heartbreaking film!!!",1520812800,,1539,4.661764705882353
6056483,3,B00G3L0NB6,"I wanted to give it 5 stars but couldn't because of the awful sound mixing.  The makers need to pull this one back into the shop and remix the sound so the people being interviewed can be heard.  I would suggest no music at all other than the credits.  People put this documentary on because they want to hear the stories.

Having said that, I must say that the interviews and stories were excellent and I would love to watch again if only the music wasn't so awful.  I enjoyed hearing from the survivors about what they went through and how their lives changed by this horrific accident.",1517443200,5,588,4.407407407407407
6056484,5,B00G3L0NB6,"A hard story to watch, but well rounded and well done. Lots of hope.",1517184000,,68,3.9285714285714284
6056485,1,B00G3L0NB6,"I love documentaries, but shame on the director. It is totally unnecessary to amp up the music for effect, especially when trying to listen to someone recount what they saw or how they felt & they are drowned out by the background sound. The very nature of the story indicates it is a tragic story. The crescendo of music or increased volume of sirens, helicopter blades whirring or shutter snaps of a fake camera are absolutely unnecessary & actually prevent me from an emotional involvement because of my frustration with the editing. The fake emotional manipulation detracts from a story deserving to be told. I wanted to hear the story be told by those involved. Sadly, I quit the documentary after 45 minutes & will simply go read about it on Wikipedia.",1517097600,4,758,4.75
6056486,5,B00G3L0NB6,this will bring tears to your eyes it did mine please don't drink and drive and if u do decide to drink and drive watch this,1515628800,,124,3.8076923076923075
6056487,5,B00G3L0NB6,"This is a horrific situation that absolutely could have been avoided by many different factors. One is a drunk driver. We all have heard that term. Do not drink & drive. Watching this documentary gives that term a powerful meaning. That unfortunately, is not common sense to many people. This should be shown as a tool in not only alcohol treatment facilities, but in high school health classes. Not just for AA meetings, but, defensive driving courses. These images will stay with most human beings..We all have a loved one, a friend, a cousin, Some have a child, a sister older, younger, a teacher, a coach. This documentary can save many lives from one mans mistake to drive home drunk. Not just drive home drunk,but leave a bar where your friends took your keys away because you were drunk &you  promised you would drive straight home, but instead, he stopped & purchased more alcohol. Then drove in the opposite direction on a four lane highway. He is sorry for his mistake??. Very difficult to reconcile.",1514246400,,1010,4.771428571428571
6056488,3,B00G3L0NB6,I was 10 years old in 1988 so this documentary seemed very interesting to me on that level (I wasn't in their state during this time but still). The only reason I'm having trouble giving this more stars is simply because the audio quality is absolutely horrible. I can barely make out the interviews with all the music and sound affects going on. It almost seems like the audio person swapped the volumes by accident. Meaning the interviews should have been louder than the music and sound affects but it was reversed. It makes it very difficult to hear what the survivors are saying during this documentary because of this audio flub.,1511308800,3,635,4.678571428571429
6056489,5,B00G3L0NB6,"Every time I travel through Kentucky (Interstate Seventy-One) on my way going or coming from Detroit, I pass the same sign. The words ""site of fatal bus crash"" always struck a chord with me. I was only four when this tragic accident occurred however, I have been researching the crash for years. Impact After the Crash is a documentary style film that describes the night the Lord removed twenty seven angels from this earth. This tragedy occurred at the hands of a drunk driver. Every scene ties into the next scene, in a respectful manner. To see the survivors today and to know they are living their lives despite all of the pain they suffered is motivation for me to live my life to the fullest. Finally a documentary that does not glorify a guilty person. While the story did share some information about the drunk driver, it's main focus was the victims. This film contained factual information, straight to-the-point stories, and inspiring people. I appreciate you for taking time out to read my review. I hope it is informative.",1510272000,8,1036,4.761111111111111
6056490,5,B00G3L0NB6,"A wonderful documentary of a very horrific event. However, it was directed in a manner that respected the victims, the perpetrator. It vilified drunk driving and the impact that the decision to drive drunk and the potential impacts. Moreover, it sparks the motivation to overcome even the most adverse situations one can perceive.",1509926400,,330,5.245283018867925

6056492,4,B00G3L0NB6,"Powerful film, but TERRIBLE SOUND MIX. I'm a filmmaker and obviously something is wrong with this mix, hopefully the director will see these posts and replace with a better copy.",1509494400,6,178,4.966666666666667
6056493,3,B00G3L0NB6,"Im about halfway through it and decided to write a review to tell everyone that the audio is horrendous in this movie. You can barely hear what the people they are interviewing are saying because of the background music and effects. Other than that, its a pretty decent documentary.",1509494400,4,282,4.775510204081633

6056499,5,B00G3L0NB6,"This was hard to watch. I can't imagine what the families of the victims of this tragedy went through and still go through, or the survivors. This was a terrible thing that unfortunately happens daily. Drinking and driving can be fatal, always. When this ended and they started showing the pictures of the victims, I said out loud to myself, ""They just don't stop coming"" .",1506729600,,373,4.666666666666667
6056500,3,B00G3L0NB6,Decent documentary. Would be a lot better if you could hear what the people were saying over the annoying background music. The production company shouldn't hire amateur audio people next time.,1506729600,3,193,5.258064516129032
6056501,5,B00G3L0NB6,"This is a must watch! The story is every person's worst nightmare but it was valuable to see how the victims handled what life had given them. Every person had a different way of coping, which is a testament that there is not always a right way of dealing with grief. Be prepared to ball your eyes out in sadness and happiness.",1506556800,2,327,4.290322580645161
6056502,5,B00G3L0NB6,"Definitely had music too loud but brought a tear to my eyes. The man who lost 3 family members was so inspirational. Yes, God hears prayers and He did answer in only the way He could. God is good and He is in control. Praise God!",1506297600,,229,4.0
6056503,5,B00G3L0NB6,I really felt the pain of this tragedy while watching this documentary. At the same time I felt happy that most of the survivors were able to go ahead with their lives and found some happiness. Drinking and driving is never a good decision. Most of the time the innocents are the ones that suffer like in this case where all these beautiful children were taken too soon from this world.,1506211200,,386,4.450704225352113
6056504,5,B00G3L0NB6,"This film is a powerful case against drunk driving and how buses--school buses especially --must be made safer. The story is told mostly through survivors and also families of the deceased. Extremely sad but also a testament to the inner strength most people have.

This is a film that definitely would have an impact on teenagers and adults to never drink and drive.",1506124800,,367,4.825396825396825
6056505,5,B00G3L0NB6,"I am absolutely speechless after watching. That doesn't happen very often. It is simultaneously heartbreaking, gut wrenching, & inspirational. I felt like I might cry, but then I didn't. Documentary discusses the different impact that the 1988 bus crash had on families of those who died, survivors of the crash, 1st responders, & the community as a whole. Then covers the recovery of joy & finding purpose through tragedy.",1506124800,,423,5.144927536231884
6056506,5,B00G3L0NB6,"Excellent telling of a tragic story.  A bad decision to drink and drive, and the ridiculous design of a school bus leads to the deaths of innocents. I'm glad to have the opportunity to see and learn a little about the victims.  They are gone but not forgotten.  And the survivors had to endure the worst kind of injury there is. The human spirit is remarkable, and this film is all about that.",1506124800,,393,4.3561643835616435

6056510,5,B00G3L0NB6,"This is really hard to watch because of how terribly sad this is.

6056511,5,B00G3L0NB6,"The story of the crash and its victims are told in heartbreaking detail.  The pain they all felt and continue to feel is palpable to the viewer.  Toward the end of the film, which took me by surprise,...the hope, the happiness, the forgiveness, and the life they all lead after the crash is quite inspirational and beautifully conveyed.  I admire all of them for their strength and courage.  Thank you, to the filmmaker and its participants.",1505865600,,441,4.7631578947368425

Even though I was not there that day, the aftermath was horrific..... And has been a defining moment of my life..... Almost every person in this documentary has had a direct influence on the person I have become..... This documentary is a must for families to watch to have a real and serious discussion about how one decision whether good or bad, can change so many lives..... This documentary is also about God's grace and about how He can make beauty out of ashes.  Brings back so many memories.",1505779200,5,651,4.491525423728813
6056513,4,B00G3L0NB6,It's amazing what these car companies get away with. Ford turning down one family's offer of $1 and a recall is the smoking gun. Look at what happened with Ford Explorers; tires were blowing out and people were dying. All because Ford cut corners to save money. Yes a drunk driver killed 27 people but the bus was not safe to begin with. No cage protecting the fuel tank. The victims had no chance because of how quickly the fire spread and the lack of emergency exits. I dislike ambulance chasers; to me they are pond scum. However the victims and their families were rightfully owed money to cover funeral expenses and ongoing health issues. Would you trade the way you look for some money? I wouldn't. Would have liked to learned more about what Larry Mahoney is doing now.,1505779200,,776,4.55
6056514,5,B00G3L0NB6,"Wow. Just wow. Please, add this to your list of documentaries for educating our youth about drunk driving. It is not gory or inappropriate in any way, just factual, first person accounts of what happened on May 14 1988 in Carrollton, Kentucky. It is a must see for people of all ages who have any questions regarding the poor choices we make and the ramifications of our actions. Excellent film.",1505779200,,395,4.6571428571428575
6056515,5,B00G3L0NB6,"I met one or two of the leaders of the group that day at Kings Island, when I was just home from college and working in admissions. I remember the leaders were fun, patient and kind, and joking around as we made sure they had enough group sales tickets for their group. When I heard it was their group the next day I couldn't comprehend it as a teenager myself. So I can't imagine what it was like for the survivors and families. The film shows a riveting and comprehensive view of the tragedy.  This film helps you see the good that came along with the horrific pain I've always imagined. As far as sound, I didn't have sound problems as streaming on my tablet.",1505779200,,662,4.296
6056516,5,B00G3L0NB6,Living in the area near the crash I am reminded when I drive that stretch of road of this tragedy.  This documentary was done very well.  Thank you everyone for telling your story.  My heart aches for your loss all these years later.,1505433600,,233,4.372093023255814
6056517,4,B00G3L0NB6,"Wow.  I do not remember this accident but I may have forgotten.  Although, I don't know how I could have forgotten this. This documentary was very moving.  Such a tragedy that didn't need to happen.  Although, I agree that the safety issues may have been the direct cause of death and injury to the people on the bus, the drunk driver was the catalyst.  Without his actions and those of the people who gave him his car keys, those people would not have died or been injured that day.  This was someone who chose to drink and drive.  Someone whose friends gave him his keys after taking them away because he was drunk.  They gave him his keys to ""drive straight home"".  They, too, should carry the guilt of this horrible tragedy.  People should not LET drunk people drive.  Period.  And Friends don't let friends drive drunk.

The poor victims and their families.  I have no meaningful words.  But this story brought me to tears....something I don't often experience.  My rating is because the story was told in a very good and moving way.",1505001600,10,1038,4.559782608695652
6056518,4,B00G3L0NB6,"I remember hearing about this horrific accident back in the 1980s and feeling that if a mob had set out and attacked the pickup truck driver, I would have cheered for their success. This, however, does little to diminish the sorrow and pain as a result of the crash. This documentary should be required viewing for all licensed automobile drivers. The endurance of the human spirit is shown in the words of the survivors and their families, friends, clergy, witnesses and the medical staff. The only reason I docked one star off my rating is because you can barely hear a word of what anyone is saying because of the obnoxious, rumbling, over-modulated ""music"" playing in the background. I turned the volume up all the way and all it did was tatter my speakers, so I finally had to turn on the closed-captioning, just to know what was being said. This is a critically important documentary and is worth ""restoring"" for future audiences. The vocal tracks need to be amplified and the music removed or dulled to a whisper, because it completely obfuscates what everyone is saying. In any case, this is a must-watch for most audiences, especially newly licensed drivers or drivers with alcohol infractions, among others. It only takes a fraction of a second for something tragic like this to happen and the program is equally pertinent to the ""distracted"" drivers of today, with their texting, GPS and cell phone activity.",1505001600,3,1419,4.843621399176954
6056519,5,B00G3L0NB6,"Instead of accident ""re-enactments"" so often put on by police departments before proms, this movie should be shown. There is so much raw emotion in this film. Watching and listening to the victims and the families left behind, one cannot help but think hard about the consequences of one bad choice. Many of the reviews I have read talk about school audiences. Unfortunately, in our culture many children grow up watching their parents drink and drive. Many adults need this message more than teens.",1504828800,,499,4.9523809523809526
6056520,5,B00G3L0NB6,"Powerful movie. Yes when I had just turned twenty one I thought there is nothing wrong with having a few and climbing behind the wheel of my car or riding my motorcycle. Hey I said to others I am adult I can handle myself. Yes I was very stupid, foolish young man. Only God kept me from killing someone or myself because some how I always made it to where I lived at the time. In one peace and no tickets. Yes God dose look after drunks and fools. That is the only reason I sit here this day. My heart goes out to all victims of drunk, or high on drugs drivers. Healing will take time. God will show you the best path to face those that did you harm or took a friend or loved one. Pain is pain, may that be emotional and physical. The man who choice to drink and drive now has to live every day knowing that one  bad decision after another ended up costing not only him and his family, but those effected in this bus crash.",1504828800,,923,4.016304347826087
6056521,5,B00G3L0NB6,"At first I wasn't going to watch it, but I'm so glad I did. I was a baby when this happened so I'd never heard of it. This was so so tragic.

There are moments when the words of the victims are actually drowned out by the intensity of the music.

6056540,5,B00G3L0NB6,"My review is as a filmmaker and not anyone connected with the event that this very carefully constructed documentary examines. Initially, I thought I would be watching an""action:"" film based on the words, :Impact: and "":crash,"" I found myself drawn in to the story of a past event that continues to haunt survivors to this day, the impact of an accident involving a drunk driver, a school bus, the death of many children and its repercussions: not something we ordinarily think about upon hearing of a horrific accident. There is nothing haphazard about  the way this documentary was constructed. We meet all the individuals involved on an equal playing field, filmed seated, against a black background, each story conveying equal weight, the various details building upon each other slowly and methodically, often inter-cut with masterful re-enactments of various details of the event: all too gruesome. The film unfolds to include aspects of the story than one would expect including not only the multiple layers of feelings and attitudes  the survivors carry with them, but matters involving responsibility, legalities and safety.  There is another meaning to the idea presented by the title (of the impact upon survivors of an accident involving a crash and the death of loved ones), and that is the impact of the film itself upon the viewer.  Was I drawn in? Yes, I was. Did I care about the story and those who were impacted? I certainly did. Did I learn something about how people channel their grief into positive outcomes? Indeed, I did. Was I moved by the complexity and the many angles that the film explored? Yes, I was moved. I was moved to tears, not in a sob sister story kind of way, but in a life affirming, expansive and even transformativly spiritual way,",1494460800,2,1774,4.903333333333333

6056547,5,B00G3L0NB6,"This is definitely the most well-made documentary I've ever seen, and probably the most important.

The first half or so of the documentary was excruciating. Witnessing the survivors recall the events of that fateful day, it was easy to imagine myself on the bus, as I would have been 9 at the time, or my own son, who is currently 13. It's a devastating thought, and I feel so greatly for the survivors, the victims, and for each of their families. I cried through the first half, and wondered if I should continue watching... because I do not drink (and would never drink and drive), would it really benefit anyone for me to watch an hour of just straight up pain?  I'm glad I stayed with it, though, because the second half touched on a variety of topics, from aspects of recovery- both physical and mental, to grief, forgiveness, survivor's guilt, and personal and corporate responsibility. It was taut and nicely balanced, though; although it touched on these things as a natural extension of the impact of the crash, there was not one moment of filler like so many documentaries resort to.

I have told my son over and over, ""Your choices make your life... make good choices to have a good life."" But, while it's true that his choices will define his life, it's also true that his choices will affect the lives of others... and his life will be affected by the choices of others. We all need to make the best choices we can, and this documentary is an excellent reminder of that. Not just in the realm of drunk driving, but also distracted driving, texting while driving, and drowsy driving, as well as the choices being made by industrial designers and engineers.

Although I also found the scoring of this documentary to be very well done and an asset most of the time, my one complaint is that in a couple of places the music was so loud it covered up what the person was saying. Still, overall it was very well done, and I think this documentary would be worthwhile to view and discuss for families, student drivers, recovering alcoholics/addicts, as well as automotive and road engineers.",1489190400,2,2099,4.634408602150538

This film manages to highlight the losses and explore the causes of the deaths in ways that both remembers the victims and points out dual issues of the flaws in the bus design and the drunk driving. To say it is ""tastefully done"" sounds foolish, but it is - the victims and their families weren't exploited or sensationalized, nor is Larry Mahoney, the driver that caused the accident.

6056610,5,B00G3L0NB6,"While I understand the link to drunk driving - as the parent of a burn survivor (Nov 2001) - Impact (which I just watched) - is so much more. It is a testimony to survivors of any tragedy - whose lives and those of their families are turned upside down and inside out in a matter of seconds. It is a testimony to turning to God and one's faith in the darkest moments of one's life and coming out of the tragedy and grief - sane and whole again. And these survivors are helping many people understand what it means to be 'normal' in real life. Which isn't anything like tv or the movies make believe it is. We lived in Radcliff & Vine Grove from 1990 to 1999 (retired military). My oldest two children went to school with the survivors. I did not know it, until the 10th Anniversary events, but I knew several of the Mothers through church programs. I think our time in Radcliff, helped our family survive our son's burn - as we knew people who had already been down the road we were going down. This is very well done documentary and I agree - Impact should be a part of every single Driver's Ed and DUI program out there.",1388016000,3,1122,4.223255813953489

Most of all, that speech written by Patty Nunnalee, what powerful words. Irony at its cruelest. Do not drink and drive! This should be shown to every kid in every drivers Ed class. And also, good for the Fairs and the Nunnalees for holding Ford/Sheller Globe accountable!

Sure there was a lot to be devastated about throughout this documentary truly seeing the impact it had on so many, before, during, & after. But beyond the devastation was so much inspiration, and even unexpected moments I learned about, was completely unaware of, and a few stories I absolutely loved hearing. Just when I would think someone had truly lost ""everything"" it was nice to see that was far from the case for so many. It was brilliantly done. As hard as it may be for some to watch, those that were very close to many on a personal level, if nothing else it will always keep their memories alive. And for those that know little, to nothing about this story, not only do you learn about this tragic event, you also learn so much about the victims both deceased and living, as well as many others that were involved on that fateful night and truly impacted for life as well. To see so many doing so well left you with a feeling of great hope for their futures, and our future. Hopefully the message of not drinking and driving will really sink in to anyone who watches this amazing film.

6056626,5,B00G3L0NB6,"I grew up with many of the teens on the bus. I grew up in Radcliff and saw how this one event effected a whole community. This documentary needed to be made to share the victims stories. Sadly there are people out there who drink and drive but maybe with this dvd some will see just how their actions could effect someone else. I loved how the dvd followed the victims lives to the present to show that life does go on, sometimes painfully and sometimes joyfully. What I take from the tragedy is that life does go on and our lives are bound by our actions and reactions to the events in our lives. I have watched it twice and the first time I cried the whole way though. The second time I was able to laugh with my friends, those teens who were on that bus but still find humor and joy in life, Harold taking about girl watching that day at Kings Island. Christy and Wayne talking about how their relationship started and how it has endured, Jon keeping an eagle eye on them both that day. I am so proud of the lives they all have made for themselves and their choice to be involved with this project. Impact has blessed me.

I was 17 and worked at the Washington Warehouse Outlet located by the movie theater in Radcliff when this happened. I was about to graduate from Meade County High School. I worked with several people who attended North Hardin and who new some of the victims. I will never forget it. I can remember the survivors that came into the store all wrapped up from their burns and stories people told when they came in. It was devastating and I will never forget the impact the accident had on me and I didn't personally know anyone involved. 8 years later on May 14, my niece was born. That date for me turned into a happy day. On June 30, 2012, at the age of 16, she was killed in a drunk driving accident. I never thought it would happen to my family, but it did. I hope and pray that this video can be used to teach our young people about the possible consequences of making the decision to drink and drive.",1383177600,10,993,4.2592592592592595

I watched it for the first time with my teenage children and even they feel like they understand their mother more now than they ever would have without this film. It has allowed me to educate them on why I get nervous when they go on field trips, especially those that fall on May 14th. They understand why I am so against drunk driving and why I warn them of ""every little thing that could happen"" every time I find one. Having the film and knowing that those who were survivors have progressed through God's grace gives me continued faith that the friends I lost that day were not lost in vain. They touched all of our lives and their purpose was to continue to ripple through time and touch the lives of many all over the world. This film is helping in their purpose and their loss.

This movie has made me re-evaluate one of the tragedies that has forever changed my life.  I had never heard the whole story of the accident. Overwhelmed with my own heart aches of life I really hadn't wondered about how I would feel watching this documentary.  I am truly greatful to be given the opportunity to see how powerful of a journey this was and how the impact has positively affected some of the families.  Being able to overcome is very hard.  Listening the the stories I felt their pain, anger, and heartbreak.  I also felt mended in the end.  The sadness will all be there in a sense of missing our loved ones.  But Choosing a better destiny is a healthier and happier lifestyle.  For those that have went on before us, they would want to see our smiles and not our tears.  I like what was said by the lady that said ""the hatred was killing me as much as it killed my daughter"".  This is a must own video.  From the suspense at the beginning of not knowing how well I would like a documentary, to the tears of the loss and struggle, right down to the smiles at the end of what you waited for, uncertain of the whole message.
