8712550,4,B007R3A2RY,"Chris Julian's ""Invisible Ink"" explores a compelling question-- ""At what point does the truth become counterproductive or hurtful?""-- through the troubled lives of roughly a dozen small-town characters, all of whom are connected in subtle but meaningful ways. Watch carefully and you'll be surprised how even minor characters from the beginning will reappear toward the end. In this small town in upstate New York, everything is connected, and secrets are hard to keep--for better or worse. Great visual storytelling, tight editing, and a beautifully orchestrated score make this an enjoyable watch. Highly recommended.",1391212800,,619,5.666666666666667
