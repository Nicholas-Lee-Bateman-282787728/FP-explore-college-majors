8667010,3,B00LO1T03C,"The film is a 62 minute documentary looking at five different haunted prisons: Moundsville, WV, Ottowa Youth Hostel, Cornwall, Isle of Demons, and Fort Henry. All the episodes following a basic formula. They first tell you this is the most haunted place in....then they re-enact a tour where somebody felt of saw something. They bring in a psychic who then feels something. And of course they re-enact some horrific events with non-horrific filming of an incident that happened in the past which neatly explains what everyone saw and felt to a T.

If you can't see through what's happening, then enjoy the film.",1440374400,,611,4.932038834951456

8667012,4,B00LO1T03C,"I bought this dvd because I love the paranormal. This video is really scary. this video shouldn,t be for children. It makes you feel bad for the men who were killed in prison and glad that like the first guy deserves to be killed in the electric chair and becomes a ghost. I live alone and this whole scares me!!!!",1428969600,,314,4.25
