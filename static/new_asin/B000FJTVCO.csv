8539548,5,B000FJTVCO,Toby is NOT fake as the other reviewer suggested.  He's a little off center and it's very hilarious and endearing.  He's smart and funny but his delivery is so odd that he was bullied by kids for years.  I love this guy!  I have a brother in law who is left of center as well and he behaves in a similar way. Toby is not faking anything!  What a great documentary if you like off the wall subjects.  Highly recommended.,1416355200,,419,4.175
8539549,1,B000FJTVCO,"This is the type of film that if it was on U-Tube would get dozens of hits...maybe even triple figures. The movie centers around ""nerd"" Toby who fakes the whole ""genuine"" part. He speaks as if he is faking some kind of cleft lip. The nerd aspect is so phoney and overdone it is boring. The movie is slow and is not worth watching even if...especially if you are Toby's mother. If seeing a grown fat man in diapers with a binky being spanked turns you on, this might be 5 star entertainment for you.",1318377600,2,498,4.252631578947368
