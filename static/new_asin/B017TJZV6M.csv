8740648,5,B017TJZV6M,"First- this is a CLASSIC zombie movie, but NOTHING like the cover would suggest.  There is NO facially-gashed, Freddy-Krueger'd, Nazi SS officer zombie.  There ISN'T EVEN COLOR.  This is an old black and white spy tale where the zombies are shambling workmen, not people eaters.  There's not a single person-eating or turning-into-zombie moment.  What it DOES have is Mantan Mooreland.  Love that guy.",1485475200,,401,5.285714285714286
