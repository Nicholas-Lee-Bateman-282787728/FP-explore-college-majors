8456514,5,B0054DPLRK,"I'll start off by saying Derek Jeter is one of the classiest athletes in the game. He certainly deserved this huge honor and applause he got in this game. I say the Rays rule because they all came up and tipped their hats to Jeter. The Rays are a wonderful team always have great sportsman ship. That's why I like them so much, they are a great bunch of players. Whenever they trade somebody away, it never seems to take away the essence of the Rays are. I am also a HUGE  Yankees fan as well. It's a win win situation for me in this game because I get to see some of the Rays players who are no longer with the team play again. Same goes for the Yankees. The Yankees put out a couple of box sets of classic games, I just wish the Rays would do that. If you are a Yankees fan reading this, I recommend the 2003 game vs. the Red Sox where they came back to beat them to make it to the WS.",1371859200,,887,3.9277777777777776
