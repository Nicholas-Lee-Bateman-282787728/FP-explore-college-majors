7997361,3,B0000AINPV,"A fairly mediocre low-budget scifi that's mostly notable for the fact it managed to pull in cameos from various actors such as Bill Paxton.

The film is made up of three mini-movies, which all share the same premise of a hypnotic ""virtual reality device"" that causes various psychology patients to live through their ""deepest fears"". What this actually amounts to are fairly mundane things such as being chased by dogs or being antagonised by an inconsiderate roommate.

Overall, it's a fairly boring, unimpressive movie, but for the price it's currently going for (around three or four dollars) it's worth a quick watch.",1404518400,,621,5.078431372549019
7997362,2,B0000AINPV,"Future Shock (Eric Parkinson et al., 1993)
[originally posted 15Feb2001]

This could have been a fantastic movie. It's an anthology film set around the office of a therapist who's come up with a new method of hypnotherapy. Over the course of the day, he sees three of his truly screwed-up patients, subjects them to the hypnosis, and waits. We get to watch what happens during the waiting.

The writing is just shy of good. The acting is just shy of good (save a few memorable performances, most notably from Bill Paxton, back when his contract still allowed him to play sleazy bad guys; he's as good and rowdy in here as he is in Near Dark). The production is just shy of good. Unfortunately, it all adds up to bad, albeit bad in a kind of endearing way. The potential in each of these stories tends to get in the way of the sheer, mindless enjoyment. The exception is the last story, ""Mr. Petrified Forest,"" a shaggy-dog story about a guy having a near-death experience who can't remember how he got outside the gates of heaven.

Ah, the potential. It's worth a free viewing if it pops up on TV, but don't go out of your way. **",1389052800,,1130,4.423076923076923
7997363,4,B0000AINPV,"This movie is an example of how a superb screenplay, terrific acting and smart dialogue are enough to make a great movie. This is what would tipically be referred to as a ""B movie"", yet you won't care about production costs here. The movie is basically three funny morality tales with serious undertones, and still, they will elicit hilarious laughs. To exemplify its power: James Karen has a non-speaking role, yet he impersonates such an extraordinary character that left me astonished and kept me thinking about just all the faces he made in his scenes for long afterwards. This movie borders on the artistic because of the talent of all the staff put into it, so it's definitely great entertainment. You don't see much like this, for sure.",1199318400,,743,4.8125
7997364,4,B0000AINPV,"Sure, there are no academy awards to be handed out, and the film quality leaves a little to be desired, but this movie has a strong concept, and was delivered pretty well with what they had available.  The behind the scenes making of really made tied this film together, and gave it a special feel.  It looked really like it was just a fun film for Bill Paxton and the rest of the crew to make, irreguardless of box office sales, and you can tell it by the way the actors appear in this film. It is a B level film, and it shows, but with a few tweaks, this could have been a big box office smash.  Worth checking out.  I bought a copy for 3 bucks, well worth it, cheaper than renting!!!!!",1161993600,2,688,4.111940298507463
7997365,5,B0000AINPV,"Okay, so I'm biased.  I worked on the film and we all had a lot of FUN.  Even when our location burnt to a crisp in the Malibu fires, we had fun.  Lots of amazing stuff on the DVD bonus feature that is likely to appeal to most viewers.  Hey, this item has sold over 100,000 DVD's, so somebody other than me must be liking it!!  Check it out!",1132012800,3,341,3.8840579710144927
7997366,1,B0000AINPV,"Are you the type of Bill Paxton fan (like myself) who admires the actor so much that you are driven to see movies like ""Thunderbirds"" and ""Spy Kids 2"" simply because he is in them?  If so, then you will definitely want to check out this amateurish anthology flick, which features Paxton as a nutjob who preys on weak college students to find a place to live.  It's not exactly Paxton at his finest, but then, he's got fairly terrible material to work with, so you can't fault him too much.

The premise is that customers at a Virtual Reality psychology clinic have nightmares while they are undergoing whatever procedure they are undergoing.  Possibly this is based on a comic book, as someone is holding a comic named ""Future Shock"" during a short behind-the-scenes in the special features.  Does it matter?  No.  This is a bad movie no matter where its sources lie.

Paxton fanatics, check it out.  Everyone else, donate the money you were going to spend to charity.",1115683200,7,968,4.647058823529412
