8527318,5,B008FGSOQI,"With so little Gaelic drama available for learners (like me), this is a great addition to the library. It's nice to pop in the VCR on a stormy night -- see it once or twice for the story, then (if you're learning) start paying attention to the language. Both actors give exhuberant performances. Poe in Gaedhlig -- what a great combination.",1371686400,,340,4.590163934426229
8527319,4,B008FGSOQI,"Well worth watching. Wish they had the option ""Gaelic with Gaelic Subtitles"" for learners -- that would be really helpful.",1362096000,,122,5.15
8527320,5,B008FGSOQI,"This Scottish-Gaelic re-telling of Edgar Allan Poe's ""Tell-Tale Heart"" uses the fluidity of Gaelic to capture the anguish of the story. An unnamed man in an insane asylum tells why he murdered his kindly employer - in a Gaelic version that will be enjoyed by those who are fluent as well as those who are learners. In fact, even those with no Gaelic can appreciate it.

The DVD offers the viewer the choice of Gaelic narration only, Gaelic with English subtitles, or English with Gaelic subtitles - making it an excellent tool for Gaelic learners, particularly since the narrator is an enthralling story-teller.

One reviewer called the Gaelic in ""An Cridhe Cabaireach"" mellifluously exotic, and he was right. Angus MacLeod has an enviable command of the language and its melodies.

MacLeod, Cape Breton actor and noted Gaelic language teacher, stars as Gaelic narrator and madman. When he learned that his student, Dr. Jim Lawrence, was translating the story with the thought of putting it on film, he asked to play ""the guy who goes insane.""

""Working with Jim Lawrence was a great pleasure,"" says MacLeod. ""His creativity, skill and knowledge of the film industry are obvious in this product - AND he's a true story-teller.""

In kind, Lawrence says, ""I couldn't have done it without him. He was an absolute joy to work with and I was just blown away by his performance.""

MacLeod's excellent voice skills and command of facial expression make his portrayal of the narrator all too chilling. As we watched, we couldn't help but wonder if MacLeod's success in portraying this character might give his family and friends cause for concern.

Lawrence, the producer, director and editor, is a professor in the Department of Communications Studies at Gardner-Webb University, North Carolina. He studies the Gaelic language with MacLeod through Skype classes offered by the Atlantic Gaelic Academy.

Two years ago, he wanted to translate an English story into Gaelic and chose ""Tell-Tale Heart."" The music and imagery of the Gaelic language make it excellent for telling creepy stories.

This 24 minute DVD is presented in a semi-animated style using hundreds of digital stills and is skillfully complemented by an original musical score.

When we watched this (twice over) with English-speaking friends who have long experience in the theatre, they were keen to see it the second time ... both times in Gaelic. MacLeod's delivery was compelling and Lawrence's creativity in bringing the visuals to life drew them in.

Gaelic learners will find much of value in this DVD, beyond the fine story-telling and the subtitles. Angus MacLeod has the rare ability to deliver his narration with a clarity that will be very helpful to learners. He is sensitive to teaching and learning, and has the ability to distinctly produce all the sounds unique to Gaelic while maintaining a conversational flow.

""From the beginning,"" says Lawrence, ""my goal was to produce something that would be a valuable resource for anyone interested in Gaelic, whether beginner or fluent speaker (hence the three different versions) and to do it in an entertaining way.""

He has most certainly succeeded. Admittedly there are a few minor issues with the subtitles. A couple of typos found their way into the Gaelic - surely a result of rushing to get this done by a deadline.

But this DVD has a significance beyond the opportunity to hone one's Gaelic.

Angus MacLeod says of Jim Lawrence, ""People like him are exactly what the Gaelic world needs today - people of energy and vision who will take what our ancestors have given us and move forward with it into a world that is bristling with opportunities for those who have the eyes to see them and the hands to grasp them. May his tribe increase!""

An Cridhe Cabaireach earned a place in the 2012 Blas Film Festival in Scotland and will undoubtedly find its way into many other film festivals around the world.

8527321,2,B008FGSOQI,"Based on the description, I expected this to be a dramatized reading of the short story.  Unfortunately it is a slide show with a voice over.  The English reading is good and the photographs are very good but the slide show is reminiscent of a teenager gone crazy on PowerPoint.  The volume of the English version is very low, making it hard to hear in anything but a silent room.  It is not a product that I would recommend.  Sorry.",1345852800,,433,4.3625
8527322,5,B008FGSOQI,"When the first scenes of ""An Cridhe Cabaireach"" appeared on my computer screen (I have a very old pre- 2001 DVD player so the DVD-R format of this disk isn't compatible with it) I was struck by just how lush and  rich the visuals are - the colours just pop out at you. I found the animation style of combining hundreds of digital photos with high definition video to be very appealing. I'm not sure that a traditional video approach would have worked as well for this story. I thought that the police who come to investigate the goings on at the house were especially cleverly done.

The other unique aspect of this DVDis that it is bilingual - you can view it in Scottish Gaelic only, Scottish Gaelic with English subtitles or in English with Scottish Gaelic subtitles. This makes it a great learning tool for students of Gaelic. Cape Breton actor and teacher Angus MacLeod's narration of the Scottish Gaelic will be very helpful in this regard, as it is so natural and clearly spoken. He also plays the madman wonderfully -his face is so expressive! Joseph Webb's English narration is equally well done, and is a delight to listen to.

There are few technical issues - one or two typos in the Gaelic slipped through and one line missed being translated from English, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Scottish Gaelic - or Edgar Allan Poe or experimental video for that matter.

I hope that Jim will be making more of these DVDs.",1342569600,3,1466,4.583969465648855
8527323,5,B008FGSOQI,"An Cridhe Cabaireach (The Tell-Tale Heart) is a delightfully chilling and creepy Scottish-Gaelic translation of Edgar Allan Poe's story of a man gone mad. The overall scenic aura combined with a fitting soundtrack, pull the viewer into the mind of a servant, driven to murder by his gentle master's ""peculiar"" eye. Excellent graphics and storyline!",1342396800,,348,5.345454545454546
8527324,5,B008FGSOQI,"This is a very chilling presentation of Poe's short story ""The Tell-Tale Heart"". The setting is wonderfully eerie and the sound effects make your heart
pound.  I bought it as a learning tool as the DVD can be viewed with Scottish Gaelic narrative and English subtitles, in English with Gaelic subtitles, or Gaelic only, but I am really enjoying it, as well as learning from it. Angus MacLeod is quite believable as the villain and his line ""Mad men know nothing!"" is said with such a malevolent gleam in his eyes that it makes me shudder. I highly recommend it for all you Poe lovers and Gaelic learners.",1341100800,3,604,4.592592592592593
