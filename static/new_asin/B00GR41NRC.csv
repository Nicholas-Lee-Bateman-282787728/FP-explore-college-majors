8626315,5,B00GR41NRC,"My husband, and I bought this video because we were so tired of having our standard poodle groomed, and then were disappointed in the results.  They were inconsistent, sloppy, and just didn't seem to care about the quality of their work.  We thought we could do a better job, so we bought the Standard Poodle Dog Grooming Miami Trim dvd.  We were not disappointed!  The instructor was easy to follow, and showed close up video of her grooming techniques.  My husband, and I broke our grooming into two sessions.  We did her feet, belly, and sanitary areas first, then on the second day we finished with her face, ears, and body.  It took us three hours total, between the two days, but we were pretty proud of the results in the end.  We couldn't have done it without this dvd!",1518912000,,777,4.5
