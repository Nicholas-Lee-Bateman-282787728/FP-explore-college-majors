8087247,3,B000BITV4W,"Not much of a mystery, there is a question of how Ralph Nelsons father died.  Ralph (James Bush) is anxious to find out the circumstances surrounding the death.  But Ralph cant make it home to do the inquiries so he sends his friend and partner Don (Onslow Stevens) to learn what he can.  Don poses as Ralph, fooling few.  He quickly learns the butler isn't who he appears to be and Ralphs slimy cousin Martin is not to be trusted.  Its obvious a murder was committed and everyone knows who did it; the problem is how to prove it so long after the fact.  And then the real Ralph shows up, complicating everything.

The transfer is ragged and rough.  The plot is a bit simplistic.  Theres little to no intrigue and one chase sequence.  Its tepid and uninspired but entertaining enough.  I thought it was okay.",1475366400,,808,4.465753424657534
