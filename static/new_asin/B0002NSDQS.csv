8029641,4,B0002NSDQS,This arrived promptly. I was a little disappointed by the price when the movie is only about an hour or so long. But I'm a big fan of t. A.T.u so I enjoyed this anyway.,1417824000,,168,3.8285714285714287
8029642,5,B0002NSDQS,It was how it was described,1408147200,,27,3.6666666666666665
8029643,3,B0002NSDQS,"definately for those who enjoy their music, shows in depth ,the life as the struggle to arrive where these girls are today",1390608000,,122,4.590909090909091
8029644,4,B0002NSDQS,"There's not much I can say here without giving away too much.
Good documentary for those who love Tatu~!

One thing to point out though: the main screen is in Russian, and not only that, but unless you are fluent in Russian, you have to go through each option JUST to watch it with English subtitles. Patience is required. XD",1383004800,,325,4.416666666666667
8029645,5,B0002NSDQS,"I am I HUGE t. A.T.u. fan so this was totally awesome for me.
To see the girls in action is awesome.
Although there are some really boring parts, most of them have Shapovlov in them, I just fast forward and it's all good.
It has some flashes of old concerts and the girls talking about very personal issues.
It is in Russian, with English subtitles but not everything has subtitles.
Which was frustrating, but you can go online and find a transcript.
All and all, it was amazing.",1199059200,2,479,4.393258426966292
8029646,3,B0002NSDQS,"Okay well let's see I bought, I saw, I looked for he truth, and well the truth is not pretty, acording to my fellow t. A.T.u fanatic friends, this video is not true. Yulia and Lena had to act, for the video to please their parents, well Lena's parents, and of course Lena and Yulia's parents are in the video too. If you want to learn something about Tatu then i suggest you buy it, if you want the truth i suggest buyin Screaming for more.",1140393600,,440,4.127906976744186
8029647,5,B0002NSDQS,"This tATu Documenty is so good it really shows alot about the girls, and it gives you an idea of what it's like to be them. I would highly recomend this to any tatu fan",1113350400,3,168,3.8285714285714287
8029648,5,B0002NSDQS,"BUY THIS DVD IT COMES WITH COOL STUFF ALSO BUY ""SCREAMING FOR MORE"" ITS COOL",1105920000,2,76,4.133333333333334
8029649,5,B0002NSDQS,"I didn't entirely know what to expect with this DVD but I absolutely loved it.  Even if you're not a fan of t. A.T.u. I recommend watching it because the girls are so uninhibited speaking their own language.  Their personalities pop right out at you and you get an insight into how they think and what they feel.  A lot of people seem to think that they're robots, merely doing and saying what they're told, but that's definitely not the case and this DVD proves it.

What also intrigued me was how they managed to link t. A.T.u.'s American debut with the war in Iraq.  You kind of feel like an outsider looking in on how things played out in 2003.

It's unclear as to whether or not their producer, Ivan, or Vana in Russian, is still with the group but he appears in much of the DVD.  I don't find him nearly as interesting as the girls but t. A.T.u. (or Taty) is his brand and you get to see first-hand just how much he likes to create controversy.

It is said that t. A.T.u. will make a comeback in 2005 but will trash their lesbian image.  It's uncertain as to whether or not they'll make another English speaking album but fans will most likely be satisfied in ordering and listening to a Russian speaking one.",1096502400,15,1215,4.317180616740088
8029650,5,B0002NSDQS,"Buy this, and you are not gonna get wall-to-wall pop videos. What you will get is a fly-on-the-wall documentary on tATu's venture into USA, the excitement (and pain) of Eurovision, arguments with the families over contracts, and, as Lena would say, so on and so forth.

It's as lovely to hear the girls speak in their native tongue as it is to hear them sing, but don't panic, there are subtitles. The dvd is rather dominated by Ivan Schapalov, who thankfully has now been ditched by the girls.

It would make a good TV programme on its own, a must for true fans.",1094428800,7,563,4.456310679611651
