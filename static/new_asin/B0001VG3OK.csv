8016594,4,B0001VG3OK,"Watched it on UTUBE when it was available on UTUBE but no subtitles to understand what was being said. The dialogue is taken from the actual manuscript of the trial of Marie Antoinette so reading the manuscript will help to piece together the film's dialogue. The acting is very good and watching the trial unfold is interesting especially if a viewer is interested in the French Revolution and has more than a just ""let them eat cake"" awareness of the life of Marie Antoinette. This film should be made available using subtitles  for sale to the public on DVD or even PBS(United States) . The Amazon seller asking for $137dollars and change for a DVD of L'Autrichienne is expecting too much. The asking price is ridiculous.",1467763200,,724,4.746031746031746
