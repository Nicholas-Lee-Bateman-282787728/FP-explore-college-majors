2534347,1,B000EU1QAO,"The DVD did a good job highlighting all the managers'tenures during the WWE, and mostly before they hit the WWE but they almost completely bipassed their career after WWE in WcW or ECW. Example Miss Elizabeth: They focused on her first run with Macho Man Randy and her premature death, but did not even mention or show footage of her 4 year run in WcW where she served as valet for Ric ""freaking"" Flair and The NwO at the height of their popularity! Another woman, Sunny although they showed footage the DVD never acknowledged that after her WWE run and before her personal decline Sunny went on to be Tammy and had a memorable run with her late husband Chris Candido. While we are on the topics of divas, where was Missy Hyatt? Despite only appearing in the WWE briefly as an interviewer still went on to be one of the most recognizable women in wrestling and an affective manager.",1149552000,,882,4.51875

Hopefully it will feature all the greats like; Slick, Mr. Fuji, The Mouth of the South, The Brain, Captain Lou, Cornett, Precious Paul, Sheri, Elizabeth, and The Wizard. Managers ringside is a real lost art of pro wrestling. They were a great addition to the matches and added an extra element to feuds. I hope this dvd really gives these classics their due.

2534357,4,B000EU1QAO,"This is a great DVD for those want to relive the Glory Years of wrestling. The Career retrospectives are great, although I wish they were longer. I also wish that they delved more into managers from other promtions such as the NWA. But over all it is a fun DVD and a tribute to the quality of WWE product that has come out lately. If your an old schoo fan or someone who wanst to begin to understand how far the sport has come get your hand on this DVD as it is relatively cheap 3 hour ride.",1154563200,,491,4.020408163265306
2534358,3,B000EU1QAO,"While it has the potential for greatness, this DVD is merely average.

I was expecting a presentation more along the lines of the fantastic Rise and Fall of ECW, and got something more like a VH1 countdown of ""100 Greatest Videos of the 80s"" which lasts a mere 30 minutes. Each of the managers in this DVD is given about 5 minutes. Video clips of the manager are played while past and present WWE personalities make general comments like ""He put the focus on his superstar"" or ""She broke new ground for female managers"". I was hoping for a history of each performer, from his or her start to finish, along with a few highlights of each career, but this DVD is not presented that way. The main documentary is 90-105 minutes long, with the extras making up the remaining time.

The DVD also suffers from not knowing whether to maintain kayfabe (the illusion that wrestling is ""real"" and not ""fixed""). Some interviewees treat the business as though the managers really did manage the career of their wrestlers in the same sense a boxer's manager guides and promotes his boxer. Others accept the reality that everyone is a performer and that managers primarily are there to be a mouthpiece and to advance particular storylines.

It's entertaining for what it is, but unsatisfying for what it could have been.",1151366400,10,1304,4.7105263157894735
2534359,3,B000EU1QAO,"I was excited when I first learned about this special ""Legends"" DVD tribute to the WWE's greatest managers, as I'd been fans of most of the great talkers of yesteryear.  I bought this DVD the day it went onsale, looking forward to reliving memories of Captain Lou Albano, the late Freddie Blassie and, of course, my personal favorite, the late, great Grand Wizard of Wrestling.  They're all featured on this DVD, but not to the fullest extent.

The WWE usually excels at ""best of"" compilations like this.  The Undertaker, Hulk Hogan and recent Dusty Rhodes collections are some of the best wrestling DVDs out there.  Sadly, this was only so-so, at best.

I think the problem lies in how each manager is only briefly touched upon, with maybe a match apiece thrown in for each man or woman.  This should've been a multi-DVD set, where each manager got the focus he or she deserved.

If you're a wrestling fan, especially the old school stuff, you'll enjoy this, no doubt about it, but the content isn't as enjoyable as it could've been.",1150848000,10,1034,4.6740331491712706
2534360,4,B000EU1QAO,"This is a really good DVD giving a great history of the impact of managers in professional wrestling.  It was great to see footage of people like The Grand Wizard, Captain Lou Albano, Paul E Dangerously (Paul Heyman) and Jim Cornette!

I thought the segment on Miss Elizabeth was very well done also.

I would have given this DVD five stars except for two words: Todd Grisham. This video would have been better without his presence.  He was totally unnecessary.",1150329600,3,461,4.725
2534361,5,B000EU1QAO,"Some of the greatest managers in wrestling are right here. 'The World's Greatest Wrestling Managers' profiles 12 of the most influential wrestling personalities. Freddie Blassie, The Grand Wizard, Sunny, Jimmy Hart, Paul Bearer, Arnold Skaaland, Sensational Sherri, Jim Cornette, Paul Heyman, Captain Lou Albano, Miss Elizabeth, & Bobby Heenan are shown doing what they did best. I love late-80's & early-90's wrestling, & this DVD is a fantastic throw-back to those great days. WW(e) uses their huge video library very nicely here, with ALOT of AWA footage, & some nice NWA stuff as well. The best pieces (my opinion) are on Jimmy Hart, Sensational Sherri, Jim Cornette, Miss Elizabeth, & Bobby Heenan. There's also some miscellaneous chapters, like 'The Art Of Cheating' featuring Bobby Heenan & Teddy Long, 'Women Managers', & 'Managers in Matches' among others that feature some more great managers like Slick, Mr. Fuji, Paul Ellering, & more.

Extras include 3 matches & numerous interviews, vignettes, & videos.

Left click on Sensational Sherri in the Chapters menu for a hidden featurette on Sherri singing Shawn Michaels entrance song.

Overall, this DVD is a very fine look at some of the best managers in wrestling and a nice tribute to some of the greats that wrestling has lost over time.",1150070400,,1301,5.156398104265403
2534362,4,B000EU1QAO,"The World's Greatest Managers DVD is an excellent purchase. If you are a fan of the old school WWE, and the impact that managers from the early days of the WWF had on the wrestlers and fans alike this is a great collection of footage.

I had no problems of who was represented. All the greats are here. and while Slick is not highlighted with his own segment. There is plenty of footage shown of the Dr. of Style.

Bobby Heenan, Jimmy Hart, ""Classie"" Freddy Blassie, Sherie Martel, Elizabeth, The Grand Wizard, Captain Lou, plus many more are all highlighted. This DVD is put together very well. And even though it short with little extras, this the DVD packs a hell of a punch. Much like the Dusty DVD, if you enjoyed wrestling from years ago, you are surly to enjoy These DVD's are produced very well. I can't say enough good things. While the current WWE wants to shove John Cena down our throats, I like to re-live what made me enjoy wrestling to begin with.",1150070400,,962,4.429378531073446
2534363,4,B000EU1QAO,"Another reviewer here complained that Missy Hyatt wasn't covered and that only WWE portions of manager's careers were shown (he listed Miss Elizabeth as an example). Missy is shown when the documentary talks about female managers paving the way for the whole WWE Diva phenom. Is her career profiled? No, but if you remember Missy was never with anyone long enough to develop a career worth talking about. And as for Miss Elizabeth's time in WCW not talked about or shown, again, that was a case where it wasn't long enough or even memorable enough to mention. This DVD discusses MANY managers in wrestling history (not just the few on the cover) and there's only so much time you can spend on everyone during a single disk DVD, so the WWE only included really memorable moments on this DVD, and I'm glad they did.

The documentary flows really well and includes some priceless and very memorable moments that any longtime fan will get a kick out of seeing. One interesting note, they gave Sunny her due (Tammy), but they also seemed to be getting back at her for the controversial comments she made about key players in the WWE on a recent shoot interview she did for RF Video.

The best profiles were Jim Cornette, Paul E. Dangerously and Bobby Heenan. No surprise that Heenan is saved for last, and Vince calls Bobby the greatest manager of all-time, hard to argue with that.

If you're hoping for tons of great extras, you'll be disappointed. There's some good stuff on here, but you'll blow thru it pretty quickly. The most noticable extras are ""Fuji Vice"" from the old TNT show and Mean Genes visit to the Hart Foundation. The 3 matches included are nothing to write home about. There is one really great extra from the AWA where Bobby Heenan is awarded the manager of the year award from PWI. This is a great in ring angle that makes me anxious for the release of the ""Spectacular Legacy of the AWA"" DVD set which comes out 11/21/06, I can't wait.

Overall, this is a good DVD release from WWE with an emphasis on the supporting characters who's job it was to put over the pro-wrestlers. Buy it only if you're interested in the WWE's documentaries.

8114303,3,B000EU1QAO,"This DVD wasn't a bad buy for the price I paid, but it was lacking in content. What would have been great is if they went into more detail behind the managers during the 1970's, 1980's, & 1990's. While they did go into great detail about some of the more well known managers such as ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie, Jim Cornette, & The Wizard, they didn't go too far in depth on some of the other managers like ""The Doctor of Style"" Slick or Sensational Sherri (Martel). I believe they could have gone more in depth on Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan too. One thing they should have added were managers who weren't very successful as well. Some of the ones that come to mind are Frenchie Martin (when he managed Dino Bravo) & The Honkytonk Man (when he managed Rock-A-BillY AKA Billy Gunn). They could have added some additional mataches where managers played an insturmental role in the outcome of the match or that had high entertainment value. One that came to mind was when Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan helped ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude win the Intercontinental Championship at Wrestlemania V.

Again, this is good for nostalgic purposes, but it could be more detailed & have more content. This definitely should have been a 2 or 3 DVD set.",1362441600,,1221,4.626728110599078
