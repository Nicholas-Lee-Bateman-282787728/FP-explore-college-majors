253377,5,6300215660,"I'm a big Judy Garland, and when I found out she lost out to Grace Kelly for ""Country Girl"" I was mad, I thought what a rip off. But when I saw Country Girl, I really loved the movie, and I see why she won, (Sorry Judy, I still love you.) But I see why she won. You really have to be a good actress to go from playing a glamourous roles, to playing a bitter, frumpy housewife. She did real good. Bing Crosby did wonderful showing he can do other things besides sing, even though we do love his voice. He adds a little singing in there. I have to say Grace Kelly deserves to win to do that great of acting. It got to show the situations, the good, the bad, and the ugly in just 2 hours, that's what you call a good movie. Bing Crosby and William Holden did wonderful. As for ""A Star is Born"" Judy did great, but the movie was too long, Country Girl had more trials and tribulations but we understood the movie in just 2 hours. Great stuff, check it out.",1025740800,2,952,4.015789473684211
253378,4,6300215660,"Adaptation of CLIFFORD ODETS'S play gives the chance to BING to tries his hand at a dramatic role for a change. Like most adaptations of stage plays at the time,it is stagebound but nevertheless fun to watch. Oscars should have been given to the make-up man who made our beloved GRACIE look older. Like most stories dealing with alcoolism,the man is weak and his wife takes charges of everything. The wife also tends to mother the husband unintentionaly in these situations. BING surprized his long time fans by playing this part that was so far of his ROAD movies with BOB HOPE.My favorite scene in this movie occurs when GRACIE slaps HOLDEN after a dramatic confrontation over her influence on her husband. This is what i call a typical mlodramatic scene in a fifties movie. I think that most people should agree with that statement.",998956800,,835,4.76551724137931
253379,5,6300215660,"""The Country Girl"" is certainly a superior drama, one that has everything necessary to make a classic film: excellent performances, directing, script, etc. The film tells the story of an alcoholic has-been actor (Bing Crosby) who is given a chance to star in a new show by a no-nonsense director (William Holden). The actor's  dowdy wife (Grace Kelly) is bitter and hard towards her husband, but has suffered and continues to suffer with his drinking after years of marriage. Soon it appears that the wife is dragging the husband down, and the director must force her to leave... when only she can stand her husband up again.
The film makes for a taut, intense drama, with a superb Oscar-winning screenplay. Crosby was nominated for an Oscar (one which I honestly feel he deserved, for his unsettling, sobering portrayal of the has-been actor). Crosby is brilliant in his role, battling the demons of his past, having a drunken fit of violence, or even lying cunningly- Crosby runs the gamut. Kelly won the Oscar for Best Actress. Well... Kelly does have some genuinely great scenes, and she adds wonderful, subtle nuances to her intense performance, and she can do everything that an actress is supposed to do with such a role (and when she yells at Holden in one scene, it is pretty scary)... but sometimes it just seems like watching Grace Kelly without makeup. Kelly was indeed a  very talented actress, and the performance was certainly worthy of a nomination, but that year... I really feel that Judy Garland's performance in ""A Star Is Born"" is the better performance, for Garland's dramatic abilities and human honesty literally stun and tear the viewer's heart to pieces. I hate to sound so cynical, but in that performance, Kelly deglamorized herself and really acted for the first time. She won the Oscar. Forgive me.
Even so, the film is still a dramatic and  sometimes disturbing picture. William Holden's restrained performance adds a nice coda to the film, as do George Seaton's direction. ""The Country Girl"" is indeed a timeless film, and one that should be watched and enjoyed over many years.",977270400,19,2110,4.904761904761905

253409,4,6300215660,"This entertaining black and white musical drama stars Bing Crosby as a weak willed alcoholic actor who refuses to accept responsibility. Grace Kelly is his intellectual but enabling wife, and William Holden is the producer who believes in Bing's abilities despite his glaring defects of character. Bing sings (naturally) a few Ira Gershwin/Harold Arlen songs, but the drama arising when Bing accepts a starring role in a musical is the main thing. The ending is predictable given the morality of the times, but it's a pleasure to see these three fine actors a work in a show about a show.

253468,5,6300215660,"Clifford Odets is one of America's great playwrights, sadly blacklisted during the 1950s. His empathy shines through here, in the complex three main characters and the changes they each undergo in understanding and in their relationships to each other.

Crosby and Kelly were nominated for Academy Awards, and Kelly's win was unexpected and controversial, coming as it did against Judy Garland for ""A Star Is Born"". Both gave great performances, but Kelly's wasn't just a question of ""deglamorizing"" herself. She really acts here, much much more than usual. Her line readings, the inflections, her character's commitment to honesty and bluntness in her effort to help her troubled husband are very different from her usual elegant, sophisticated charm. She's very convincing as a well bred woman who has kind of given up on herself, committing all her energy to an unfulfilling marriage to a man she once adored. It's an unusual role for her and her commitment to it shows a range she might have explored further if she hadn't left movies the following year to become Princess Grace of Monaco.

Crosby also deserved his nomination. It's a very complex role and he did the ""falling apart"" scenes brilliantly, touchingly, but I was also surprisingly moved by the scenes where he's ""putting on"" the charm, the bon hommie, and how much people around this ""star"" really do respond to his warmth and geniality. He carries it off, even though the ending script requirements are a bit dated--all those emotions that must suddenly ""show on his face"". Still, he's a really good dramatic actor, in case anyone ever doubted it.

For me, Holden's performance is the underrated one but it's his acting that brings it all together. HE is the one with the passion, the energy, the drive to make this play go on--and he's got faith and admiration for this man, convincing everyone else to take the risk (including lots of money) because he, as the director, believes Crosby's NOT a has-been, but if given the opportunity can still show that he's a great talent. Holden plays all the emotions so convincingly, just as he always does, never a false note in his interaction with anyone--or his disappointments, or his anger, or his hopes.

If you like films about the theater, with great writing and performances, this is one of the best.

253475,3,6300215660,"Well, Grace Kelly is my all-time favorite actress so I had to own this one. In my opinion, she was excellent in her role and I'm glad she won. The movie itself was rather slow and depressing for me. If she wasn't in the film, I would have easily nodded off more than a few times. But I suppose there is one lesson in it. A guy obviously needs to man-up if he wants to hold on to a good woman like Grace Kelly. Opposite her in the movie is Bing Crosby. He's a talented individual but plays a very pathetic character here. The movie was nominated for several awards, including best picture. So for it's time, I guess it was good, but for my taste I couldn't quite give it 4 stars. Maybe it's better than 3 stars to other viewers.",1393372800,,727,4.126760563380282

253497,4,6300215660,"Nominated for seven Academy Awards with two wins, Grace Kelly for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and George Seaton for Best Writing Screenplay, Country Girl is a tour de force of cinematography.  While not winning, it was also nominated for:  Best Actor, Best Director, Best Picture, Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Kelly and Crosby turn in exceptional performances as exemplified by Kelly's win and Crosby's nomination.  While shot in 1954 the film has a very contemporary feel, much more than say Casablanca, which was shot more than a decade earlier.  I strongly recommend that you consider watching this film, both Kelly and Crosby are well out of their customary roles and William Holden turns in a solid performance.  If I have one criticism of the film, it is that the Title does not seem to really fit the story line; I have pondered esoteric meanings but I still fail to make a connection.

True to the book, Crosby was nervous, Kelly was stiff, and the veteran Holden carried the film, from an acting standpoint. I was surprised Kelly got an Oscar for her performance, especially considering she beat Judy Garland (A Star is Born). Kelly's excellence was in her portrayals of glamorous, sophisticated ""types"".

253541,4,6300215660,"The nominal star of THE COUNTRY GIRL is Bing Crosby as Frank Elgin - an alcoholic, apparently over-the-hill actor tormented by his past - especially the premature of death of his young son.  In the end, however, he learns the importance of being true to himself, not to others.  But the real center of this enthralling piece is Grace Kelly as Crosby's wife Georgie; imprisoned in a loveless marriage, she tries her best to support Frank in every way she can, even though she deprives herself of a future by doing so.  Theatrical director Bernie (William Holden) offers her the promise of a better life as he falls in love with her; but she decides instead to stay with her husband.  One shot at the end of the film sums up her position; as she enters through a door, we see a china statue to her left.  Like a statue, she has to suppress her own feelings in the interests of marital harmony.  THE COUNTRY GIRL is very much a film of the mid-50s, in its advocacy of marriage as a normative state; but Kelly's performance suggests what a constricting life that might be.",1356134400,,1068,4.479381443298969

A young Broadway director (William Holden) wants Frank to star in his new show, but Frank's drinking and his uncooperative wife may spell disaster.

This stark and touching drama has both Bing and Grace playing against type and they're both wonderful.  Bing plays the weak has-been with utter sincerity and Grace drabs it up to play the nagging wife.  She won Best Actress and he was nominated for Best Actor.  The two reunited two years later in ""High Society,"" playing carefree socialites, showing their versatility.  William Holden is excellent as the demanding director who pulls a good performance out of Frank and shakes up the angry Georgie.

The script draws on the themes of guilt, alcoholism, and redemption and the black and white photography emphasizes Frank and Georgie's misery.  It's a very good and thought-provoking film.  4.5 stars.",1299801600,2,1031,5.017647058823529
253547,4,6300215660,"Groucho Marx supposedly called Grace Kelly's victory over Judy Garland (""A Star is Born"") in the 1954 Best Actress race ""the biggest robbery since Brinks."" I've seen ""A Star is Born"" many times and decided to see what the fuss was about.

I think I see why Ms. Kelly won as Georgie Elgin, the wife of struggling actor Frank Elgin (Bing Crosby). The Academy likes to honor ""character"" performances by swan actresses who turn into ugly ducklings for the sake of a role (see also Charlize Theron in ""Monster""). For most of ""The Country Girl,"" Ms. Kelly  wears unflattering hairstyles and frumpy clothes and carries herself with the air of someone who's been beaten down by life. She's an educated, well-bred, once-elegant woman who feels she has thrown away her life on a loser and she's fed up with it all. She really immerses herself in the role, and you can see she was quite ambitious as an actress. Was she better than Judy Garland (or Dorothy Dandridge in ""Carmen Jones,"" or Audrey Hepburn in ""Sabrina,"" or Jane Wyman in ""Magnificent Obsession"")? I wouldn't presume to say. I haven't seen ""Carmen Jones."" The other films are so different from one another and from ""The Country Girl"" that it's like trying to say whether a very good salad is better than a very good chocolate cake.

As to the rest of the movie: This is product of its time, when black and white film adaptions of ""hard-hitting"" Broadway dramas were common. Here our theme is alcoholism. They actually do a pretty good job addressing the lies alcoholics tell themselves and their loved ones, the excuses they make, the ways they manipulate people. Both Frank and Georgie are well-drawn characters. William Holden plays the hard-nosed Broadway director who wants to help Frank by casting him in his musical play. He is initially suspicious of Georgie, but finds his assumptions challenged. I was not crazy about Holden's performance; his range of emotion seemed a little to0 narrow and monotonous, but it was OK.

An odd thing about ""The Country Girl,"" and what makes it different from similar movies of the period, is the way musical numbers are thrown in. I guess they wanted Bing to be able to do is song-and-dance schtick, but it really doesn't work well here. The songs he performs are lifeless and overlong, slowing down the story. Another weakness is the play that Holden's character is directing, a fictitious musical called ""The Land Around Us."" The scenes we see rehearsed, repeatedly, look like like the piece was written by a small-town high-school English teacher and performed by the drama club at the local Methodist church, yet we're supposed to believe this is going to be a big Broadway hit.

I wonder too if, as was the case with many Hollywood adaptions of Tennessee Williams et al. in the 1950s, they had to change some material from the source play to get it past the movie censors. Some of the events in the movie did not seem to make much sense.

Bing sings for his audition, has a flashback of himself recording a song, sings as part of the broadway show he is starring in and he even duets with a cabaret singer at a bar.  None of the music is especially interesting and it sometimes slows the momentum of the story.

As far as the acting goes, everyone comments on Kelly and Crosby, but Holden is the pro here.  He gets taken for granted because he's done this role so many times and he makes it look easy.  Granted, Crosby is a revelation, but it's more because he is playing so much against type.  And Kelly is doing her best Ingrid Bergman impersonation.  I swear she even takes on Bergman's accent.  It just left me thinking how much better Bergman would have been in the role.  The fact that she won the Oscar just shows that politics win Academy Awards.  Any of the other four actesses were more deserving.

The movie itself has a good story with some surprises, though it's a little stagy.  Worth a look to see Holden showing them how it's done.",1156982400,6,1137,4.3364928909952605

There is a virtue to the pacing for any discriminating viewer.  Our assumptions about the characters and their relationships are dropped on their head and our initial reactions are not the correct ones.  Some reviewers called the film drab but I would say it has a gritty realism.  The three principals here are superb.  Bing Crosby gives probably his best performance ever as the dependent alcoholic.  Forget the Oscar.  Forget the drab clothing and lack of makeup.  Grace Kelly here delivers a performance of great complexity as the enabling spouse who has finally gotten to the end of her rope.  The glue to the film is William Holden, the theatre director who acts as a surrogate for the audience in trying to sort out Crosby and Kelly's less than ideal relationship.

253577,4,6300215660,"I watched ""The Country Girl"" last night for the first time and I confess that I have mixed feelings.  Part of me wants to praise this movie and part of me wants to call it over-rated.  The movie has most of the prerequisites for success; great writing, great acting, decent directing and a little song and dance mixed in for extra flavor.  The story is a bit predictable although it is well told.  It opens up with a view of a hard-driven Broadway director whose production is stalled for lack of a suitable leading man.  We see the producer who is keeping a close watch on every penny.  We hear that the director has in mind a big name from the past who has fallen on hard times due to personal problems.  You can proabably figure out 60% of the rest of the movie on that much alone.

The focus of the movie is on the relationship between the old has-been and his still youthful wife.  She married him on the way up and is stuck with him on the way down.  You can now figure out another 20% of the movie.  I'll leave the remaining 20% alone while reiterating that the predictibility does not diminish the impact of the movie.

My problem with the movie lies with the acting.  My biggest problem is with Bing Crosby who plays the former star fallen on hard times: is he good or bad in this role?  When your role is playing a washed up actor and you come across as unimpressive is that because that's how the role was meant to be played?  Crosby seemed to be always standing with his arms dangling at his side and a look of absolute confusion.  I kept wondering how much better the movie would have been with a real actor in the role.  However, Bing brought the pathetic nature of his character to the forefront by allowing himself to look so inept.  I'm still not sure whether to praise of criticize him.  I'm a big fan of William Holden and his preformance was largely impressive.  There were a few times, however, where his lines were too bad for anyone to look good in.  Finally, there's Grace Kelly who got the Oscar for Best Actress in this role.  There were times she was good and times she was mechanical.  I couldn't make up my mind on her as well although I came away feeling that Dorothy Dandridge probably was cheated out of an Oscar in 1954.

The snippets of the play that was being produced reminded me of the amateur production of my town's centennial play.  Come to think of it, ours was probably better.

OK, OK, why the 4 stars after all of this?  Well, William Holden for one.  He still controls every scene with his forceful presence.  There's a truly poignant personal tragedy that touched us all and helped draw us into the story more.  Finally, there's the feeling that some of the ""bad"" acting was really good acting in disguise.  I'm glad I watched ""The Country Girl"" but it still puzzles me somewhat.  Watch it and see what you think.",1130457600,4,2859,4.366223908918406
253578,5,6300215660,"The year 1955 proved a memorable one for Grace Kelly in a number of respects, two of which involved winning an Oscar and meeting a prince who would ask her to marry him and share a kingdom with him.  It sounds like the grist for a romance novel, but it all actually happened in the kingdom of Hollywood cinema.

It was the glamorous Grace Kelly that Prince Rainier of Monaco would meet on the French Riviera when she was playing a rich heiress in Alfred Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief"".  The irony is that in her other film that was released that same year, ""The Country Girl"", she won a Best Actress Academy Award by playing the only role of her short but illustrious career that was decidedly against type.

Whereas Kelly, the Philadelphia girl who became a glamorous fashion model in New York, played her natural image in every respect in two Hitchcock classics, ""Rear Window"" and ""To Catch a Thief"", she was challenged in the film in between by director George Seaton, who adapted the play of hard-boiled Depression playwright Clifford Odets to the screen in ""The Country Girl"".

Kelly's character is the opposite of what she appears to be in the early stages of the film.  She plays the wife of hard luck Broadway actor-singer Bing Crosby, who has never been able to assuage the guilt he felt over not being able to save their son and only child from death in a New York traffic accident.

Crosby takes to alcohol and becomes extremely depressed, using Kelly as a crutch.  He implores her to make decisions, including some unpopular ones that make people angry with her, all the while seeking to portray himself as an all-purpose nice guy who is relaxed and at peace with himself.

When Broadway stage director William Holden seeks to case Crosby as his lead in an upcoming production he is fought tenaciously by the show's producer and prevails only after insisting he will walk out if not given an opportunity to at least see how well the veteran performer plays in a Boston run prior to coming to New York.  If he does not pan out then Crosby will be replaced.

Holden, who is on the rebound from a tragic divorce, is immediately skeptical of Kelly.  He believes her to be the problem behind her husband's lack of confidence and tough times after earlier Broadway successes.  As he learns more and more he not only changes his mind about Kelly and apologizes; he falls in love with her.

This is a film about the trials and tribulations of Broadway theatrical people and their determination to rise above all obstacles.  The trio of Kelly, Crosby and Holden walk on eggshells concerning the show and added complications resulting from the director's increasing admiration for the star's wife.

Kelly plays her role with great sensitivity.  To present her in a more dour light famous costume designer Edith Head was instructed to create an appropriate wardrobe for her to tone down the glamour that made her world famous.  Her hairstyles were also reflective of a sober woman unconcerned about glamour.  Such a role understandably was a challenge for one of the most glamorous women ever to set foot on a Hollywood sound stage or grace the covers of fashion magazines.",1121212800,18,3174,4.696750902527076
253579,4,6300215660,"""The Country Girl"" is one of the finest films in Paramount's illustrious catalogue of library titles; a poignantly tragic love story with a show biz background, it stars Bing Crosby in a decided departure from his usual light-hearted form.

Georgie (Grace Kelly) is Frank's emotionally prostrated wife and the only ray of hope in his life. Bernie Dodd (William Holden, is the parasitic director of a new Broadway play that affords Frank his last chance at the big time. Believing that Georgie is the cause of Frank's loneliness Bernie deliberately keeps her at bay, the net result; a burgeoning and not so unlikely romance brewing between the two.
Though outstanding in the pivotal role of Georgie, Grace Kelly's lacks what Judy Garland gave Esther Bloggett in 1954's A Star is Born or Gloria Swanson's maniacal rampages in Sunset Blvd. - these latter two nominated opposite Kelly for Best Actress at the Oscars. Ultimately Kelly walked off with the little gold bald guy which, in retrospect, was an error in judgment.

The back stage dialog is good and the atmosphere is convincing but unneeded Crosby musical numbers are terrible and overblown. Overall, a very cold and drab film.

But Grace Kelly (who inexplicably won the Oscar for this) is terribly miscast.  She is all right, but hardly Oscar material.  The Oscar that year SHOULD HAVE GONE to JUDY GARLAND in ""A Star Is Born"".  It was the biggest Oscar Robbery in the history of the Oscars.  They only gave it to Kelly because of her box office appeal at the time...she had 3 hit movies that year...Rear Window and Dial M for Murder, the other two.  Also, Kelly won because dowdy, frumpish characters are what the Academy likes.  Totally unfair.

When Frank's career blossoms again, pressure forces many ugly secrets and anger to blossom as well threatening their marriage.

George Seaton's (""The Counterfeit Traitor"") direction and adapation of Clifford Odets' (""None but the Lonely Hearted"") play manages to restrain the soap opera elements of the story that might have overwhelmed the dramatic possibilities of the film.

The transfer is exceptionally good but could have been better. While the black and white images have solid blacks and grays, there's a fair amount of analog blemishes in the form of scratches and dirt that occasionally do distract the viewer. Still, even with these minor blemishes the film looks better than it should given the age of the negative. The film is presented in full screen which is the wrong aspect ratio for the film. It's a pity that Paramount didn't present this widescreen and that will be a deal breaker for some people. I've docked the film a star for that reason.

The mono sound has been cleaned up a bit although there is some minor issues with hiss. ""The Country Girl"" still sounds remarkably rich and vibrant for a picture of its time.

Paramount has chosen to release this with no extras which is a pity. This wonderful classic certainly deserved a retrospective documentary on the production of the film (particularly since William Holden and Bing Crosby supposedly had affairs with Kelly during and after the shooting of the movie).

Plagued by alcoholism and insecurities, Crosby seems like an unwise choice to most, but Holden sticks by him.  Conflict arises between Holden and Crosby's suffering wife, Grace Kelly, mostly because Crosby has set them up for it, rather than admitting his weaknesses.  Crosby is miles away from the kind of roles we expect to see him in, delivering an excellent performance that shows the talent he had.  A dowdy (for most of the film, anyways) Kelly is very strong here, scoring in a big way in a role that is also miles away from what we would expect of her.  Although not the most exciting film I've seen, and I do wish that more had been done to show the rehearsals and other aspects of making a Broadway show, the conflicts that develop between the triangle of main characters are very well written and acted.

253638,4,6300215660,"In the ranking of American playwrights Clifford Odets is usually placed in the second tier behind Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman and Tennessee Williams.  His output was something less than theirs and his two best-known plays, Waiting for Lefty and The Country Girl, never quite reached the artistic pinnacle of say, Miller's Death of a Salesman or Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire.  Nonetheless as a movie The Country Girl is a brilliant piece of work thanks in part to a fine adaptation by director and screenwriter George Seaton (Oscar for best screen adaptation, 1954) and sterling performances by Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby and William Holden.  Seeing this for the first time I was almost as much impressed by Holden, who played a part very much in keeping with his character and with other parts he has played, as I was by Kelly and Crosby who both did 180 degree turns in type-casting.
Grace Kelly won an Oscar as the faithful, strong-willed, bitter, dowdy co-dependent wife of crooner Crosby who played a whimpering, guilt-ridden alcoholic.  You have to see Grace Kelly in the bags-under-her-eyes make-up and spinster get-ups to believe it.  She looks at least ten years older than her 25 years with a sour puss of a face and an attitude to match.  I think she won best actress (over Judy Garland in A Star Is Born) partly because her appearance was so stunningly...different.  (While I'm musing, I wonder if this was the film of hers that was banned in Monaco.)  It would seem to be the height of creative casting to put her into such a role, yet she is excellent, wonderful to watch as always, her timing exquisite, her expression indelible, and her sense of character perfect.  When she says to Holden, ""You kissed me--don't let that give you any ideas,"" and then when we see her face after he leaves, loving it, we believe her both times.
Bing Crosby too is a sight to behold in what must have been his finest 104 minutes as a dramatic actor.  He too played way out of character and yet one had the sense that he knew the character well.  He was absolutely pathetic as the spineless one.  (In real life Der Bingo was reportedly a stern task master at home--ask his kids.)  Clearly director Seaton should be given some of the credit for these fine performances.  When your stars perform so well, it's clear you've done something right.
The production suffers--inevitably, I suppose--from the weakness of the play within the play. Crosby is to be the star of a Broadway musical called ""The Land Around Us.""  (What we see of the musical assures us it's no Oklahoma!)  He's a little too old and stationary for the part, but of course he sings beautifully. (Painful was the excruciatingly slow audition scene opening the movie with Crosby singing and walking through a thoroughly boring number.)  Holden is the director and he is taking a chance on Crosby partly because he believes in him and partly because he has nobody else.  Naturally if Crosby returns to the bottle, everything will fall apart.
What about the nature of alcoholism as depicted by Odets?  Knowing what we now know of the disease, how accurate was his delineation?  I think he got it surprising right except for the implied cause.  Crosby's character goes downhill after the accidental death of his son, which he blames on himself.  Odets reflects the belief, only finally dispelled in recent decades, that alcoholism was indicative of a character flaw, as he has Crosby say he used his son's death as an excuse to drink. Today we know that alcoholism is a disease, a chemical imbalance.  Yet Odets knew this practical  truth (from the words he puts into the mouth of William Holden's character): an alcoholic stops drinking when he dies or when he gives it up himself.  It is interesting to note that as a play The Country Girl appeared in 1950, the same year as William Inge's Come Back, Little Sheba, which also dealt with alcoholism.  The intuitive understanding of alcoholism by these two great playwrights might be compared with the present scientific understanding.  (See for example, Milam, Dr. James R. and Katherine Ketcham.  Under the Influence: A Guide to the Myths and Realities of Alcoholism [1981] or  Ketcham, Katherine, et al.  Beyond the Influence: Understanding and Defeating Alcoholism [2000].)
Here's a curiosity: the duet song (best number in the movie; Crosby sang it with Jacqueline Fontaine) has the lyric ""What you learn is you haven't learned a thing,"" which is what the alcoholic learns everyday.
And here's a familiar line, cribbed from somewhere in the long ago: Fontaine asks Crosby aren't you so-and-so, and he replies, ""I used to be.""",1034985600,3,4660,4.83984867591425
