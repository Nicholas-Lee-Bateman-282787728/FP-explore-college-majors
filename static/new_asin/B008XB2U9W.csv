5188916,1,B008XB2U9W,This is by far the worst dvd set ever. The quality is so poor its was hard to watch. And i live black and white movies. So please get rid of this set to sell.  It is no good. Wish i could give it no stars,1421107200,6,204,3.4347826086956523

5188918,4,B008XB2U9W,I like old movies and I enjoyed seeing them.  Some of them are better than others but keep in mind they are very old.  I wish the sound quality was better and some of the movies should have been restored. All in all I enjoyed seeing them.,1389830400,,238,4.042553191489362

5188920,2,B008XB2U9W,"This review is for the Bela Lugosi Scared to Death Collection.
At first glance, this was an appealing set, containing 8 of the 9 films Bela made for Monogram (all except Voodoo Man). The packaging is far better than one expects from a public domain issue like this. But, unfortunately, the positives end there. The DVD transfers themselves are terrible. Coarse raster scan lines and jaggy edges are evident on nearly every film. Some of the films are plagued by the type of soft blurry images that you remember from the cheapest VHS tapes (especially in Lugosi's single color film, Scared to Death, which is virtually unwatchable). Worst of all, every movie is marred by a strange artifact I haven't seen before: the entire top half of the frame is out of sync with the bottom half, by about a quarter of a second. Any motion across the entire frame is thus distorted. It's very disconcerting and annoying to watch.  Understand, I wasn't expecting Criterion quality from this set; Mill Creek standards of quality would have been good enough to make this a good purchase.  It's a puzzle why Madacy did such a lousy job of mastering these discs when they put out such nice packaging.",1382313600,14,1181,4.728155339805825
5188921,3,B008XB2U9W,"The collection has some really rare items, and that is wonderful.  The bad part is that most of the film are in the public domain.  As a result, the quality is horrible.  White Zombie, a real gem, is from a bad VHS transfer so all of the nuances and production values are lost.  If they were cleaner version, I would recommend it much more highly.  Either way, some really unique films are included.",1381708800,5,399,4.410958904109589
5188922,5,B008XB2U9W,"As a long-time Lugosi fan I was very impressed by this collection, especially the packaging.  The inside is particularly nice with a great photo of a Primetime Bela and a well-written biography.  Looks great on the bookshelf!  The condition of the films are a hit-and-miss affair but it was really well put together.  Kudos on this collection!",1381104000,6,343,4.964912280701754
5188923,1,B008XB2U9W,"While the image is from the usual sources so it is predictably fair to poor, whenever the image panned on this collection it split in half. I've never seen anything like it but I assure you it doesn't enhance the viewing enjoyment of any of the features.",1371686400,6,254,4.425531914893617
5188924,5,B008XB2U9W,"I was trying to add a few new Lugosi titles that I didn't have with this 20 movies set. The price was very reasonable at around a dollar each. About half I already had in other sets. It still is worth it. The movie quality and sound is fair, but so are other movies I have got from other collections. They are old movies and it's nice to be able to see them at all. Overall this is worth the money to find all these Lugosi movies together in a nice boxed set.
 I like the way the dvd's are stored in each of the two volume boxes (half in each). It's safe and won't scratch. Sturdy and well made  Easy to get in and out. Just a cardboard holder to set each disc in individually that opens like a fold out book with each dvd facing you when totally opened. Each dvd has two movies on each. Each dvd has the 2 movie titles and one of the movies pictured on it. The box pictured in the ad is the outside covering that I just put into storage.
 I wish this was out before when I started my collection. It would have been priceless to begin with. Now it's still a great deal to find all together. No extras to talk about. Nothing fancy. Just old Lugosi movies at a nice price. Period.",1362960000,27,1178,4.0256410256410255
5188925,4,B008XB2U9W,"Reviewing the 20 Bela Lugosi film set that came out in February 2013 (in case this review gets later mixed with other product listings).

If you're a Bela Lugosi fan like me, you're always looking for a cheap way to pick up some more of his films that you haven't seen.  I'll keep this review short -- the listed movies are there, intact, and playable.  If you know anything about Bela Lugosi, you know these are his B and C movie roles, but some of them are memorable.  The packaging on this is something like I've never seen -- each disk rests in a slab of what seems like super thick fiberboard, almost like masonite or MDF.  It wastes a good bit of shelfspace, but it is sturdy and easy to keep organized.

The transfer quality is of the lowest quality, but not so bad as to be a ripoff or something that shouldn't be sold.  These movies average about $1 each with the Amazon prices -- you can't ask for much better.

So if you just wanted to get to see some more Bela Lugosi films, go ahead, this set will do the trick.",1362873600,18,1024,4.2153846153846155

8531990,4,B008XB2U9W,"As a lugosi fan, I had to get this collection. The packaging is impressive, containing bis biography and the sets perfectly secured. The movies are of decent quality, but not to the point where it would be overbearing to watch. There in great condition to be watched but the movie ""Invisible Ghost"" does twitch a little bit but its still watchable. Most of these movies like ""White Zombie"" and ""Death Kiss"" I already owned but most of them I have yet to own. Besides, the pricing was great with all of these movies in one collection for under $20. I definitely would recommend this to anyone who loves Lugosi or old horror films in general",1484179200,,639,4.565217391304348

As others have stated, the quality is not the best, but some may find the weathered quality adds to the charm of this collection.
