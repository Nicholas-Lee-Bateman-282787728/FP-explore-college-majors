8727817,5,B004W0NRC2,"A very well documented video, showing that others, beside the Jews, were oppressively persecuted. One such group were Jehovah's Witnesses, of which this video details.
Millions of persons suffered and died by the hand of Hitler and the regime. If any single person regardless of race, culture, religion, health condition etc, did not ""qualify as pure"", they faced bitter persecution, torture and death. They lost all they had ""just the day before"".
You and I, will never be able to comprehend the scope of this horrific trail of greed for power started by one man. Only those who are still with us, that were living at that time, will ever be able to explain the excruciating pain, suffering, desperation, heartache and fear. Even they, cannot ""wrap their minds around"" the twisted reasonings.
One definitive factor that cause such things to transpire, is the fact Satan himself ""is the ruler of this world"". But only at present...he has a short time left, and he knows his own fate. He is bent on getting any human, no matter the cost, to serve him.
Yes, greed started the downward spiral of mankind's imperfection and ultimate doom.
Only if one stays faithful under trials, and clings to the only True God, Jehovah, (whose name has been found in ancient Biblical manuscripts over 7,000 times), and does not give in to Satan's trickery, will they have the promised hope laid out clearly in God's Word. That is the chance to live forever, here on earth, which will be returned to a peaceful paradise...just as God intended it to be.
No more, will  Satan exist...therefore no more wicked ones causing disastrous turmoil. In turn...no greed will be brought into one's mind. As mortal mankind, we change over time, whether for good or bad. But Jehovah never changes. His ways are always just, and true. He cannot tell a lie, He tells us in Hebrews.  He is a Righteous God, with attributes of Love, wisdom, justice and power. He has given mankind the time and chance, to prove Satan a Liar. Yes, a chance as to who we are going to personally serve. We absolutely cannot serve ""two masters"" and ""eat at the same table"". As God says, ""to earthling man, even his steps do not belong"". We were created to live for and serve our Sovereign God and Creator, and to follow His Son's footsteps.

In knowing this, we can clearly see why this one man wanted such great devotion and power. And it did not go well with him. He proved by his actions, that Satan was whom he chose to serve...adding to the atrocities of that time.
He did not want to see mankind as equals, like God lovingly does. We are all made from dust, as Adam was. God has given us...and the angels free will. That meaning we have the right to choose which ""master"" we will serve. It all comes down to our choice. Will we serve the rebellious angel who became Satan...or the One who gave us everything we need to survive...adding to that things we do not really need. He loved us, so he gave us free pleasurable things, such as our 5 senses. He wanted us to enjoy life...the way HE intended. He did not make us as robots, we are as unique as a fingerprint...we are indebted to Him, we can never in all eternity give back to Him what He freely gave us. Yes...He gave His only begotten Son to us, to redeem us from sin. Our hearts should burst with thanks to Him for providing such a provision.
Should we not want to serve and give whole souled devotion to only Jehovah? Having Satan as our leader, will not lead to the real life...only to death will it lead us.
It is difficult and tiring to remain faithful, but Jehovah will bless us more than we will ever be able to imagine...With unending life, in a peaceful world.

Those mentioned in this video, did remain faithful....
......resulting in being able to live forever on earth, under God's government (Dan 2:44)...where health, happiness, and peace will reside, and the ""wicked will be no more"", they will ""look at where they were, and they will not be there"".",1458432000,2,3966,4.5738396624472575
