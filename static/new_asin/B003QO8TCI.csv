4171034,5,B003QO8TCI,"One of the most intense and moody films to come out! A character driven, meaningful and psychological thriller about human behavior and how we behave in an unnatural setting. I love films like this. feels like a foreign film. heartwrenching moments and flawed characters who never seem to know what the right thing to do is. a slow build that leads to a unflinching ending! very few adult films like this. like a twisted French New Wave or Catherine Breillat film! will leave you insecure and full of emotion by the end of it. the momentum is moved forward, not action, or horror, or by some pop psychology or ridiculous backstory but by the characters actions and behavior toward each other. sometimes simple and subtle but always affective. looks great. intense and natural performances. moody music. wonderful first film for many involved and a great addition for James Russo. buy it immediately!",1278547200,5,899,4.921052631578948

4171036,1,B003QO8TCI,"**SPOILERS AHEAD**

I tried watching this via a streaming service, and was extremely disappointed. Too many unrealistic situations -- his wife takes a pre-sex shower, so naturally, he kills time by going out for a good, sweaty run. When his wife is assaulted, the protagonist simply stands there and shouts (despite the fact that he's armed, and the attacker is not). The police doubt his story of an assault, but don't bother to ask the victim, who's nearby.

And the pacing was glacial, hindered as well by a story-telling technique that treats scenes much as free-standing vignettes with little obvious linear connection.",1376438400,2,624,5.107843137254902
4171037,2,B003QO8TCI,"I watched it almost to the end and Amazon Instant Video stalled and would not go two seconds more without stalling. Not worth the effort. Reminds me of AOL in the eighties. I guess watch it at 2 am and it will work fine. This was like throwing three dollars out the window while driving on the expressway. If they can't do better than this, give up!",1364256000,,349,4.223880597014926
4171038,2,B003QO8TCI,"This movie is billed as a pschyological thriller, but they appear to have left out the thriller part.  The psychological part is trite and obvious, although I freely admit I did not watch the end.  I made it through 2 hours of the movie and turned it off - I couldn't stand to watch any more and even though I didn't see the ending, I don't feel as though I missed anything and am relieved that I didn't have to keep watching it.

The movie is s.l.o.w.  And then it gets slower, if that were possible.  There weren't any surprises, thrills or twists in the first two hours and I only found myself on the edge of my seat because I wanted to be doing something else.  I stuck with it hoping for a good ending, but since I didn't actually make it to the ending I can't say whether it does or not.  If an hour were cut from the movie, the pace might be all right and no one would miss the footage.

I gave it 2 stars because the actors were good - in nearly every other aspect it's one star.  The soundtrack is understated and unmemorable.  The swooning reviews must be from people associated with the movie, because I can't imagine anyone else giving it even 3 stars, unfortunately.",1350864000,3,1179,4.246636771300448

It will scare the hell out of you.

4171040,1,B003QO8TCI,"I often don't read the most negative reviews of movies on Amazon because I believe the reviewers either have very unrealistic expectations or are just generally critical of everything, but I have to tell you...this movie is not 5, 4 or even 3 stars.  This is bad movie.  Those giving this high marks have to have ties to those who made or acted in this movie.  This is a well below average movie.  Nice dvd cover, it appears like an intelligent, well made movie but is absolutely isn't even close.  Sorry, but don't waste your time.",1318636800,5,532,4.5
4171041,5,B003QO8TCI,This was exceptional.  Certainly true to its title.  The emotional twists bring a surprise ending. I very much would recommend this film.,1289260800,,137,5.181818181818182
4171042,5,B003QO8TCI,I was surfing for a movie that would fill in a Friday night and boy did I find a movie that filled my expectations. I watched it three times that weekend. The movie Dark Woods is a movie that keeps you on edge with its suspense and plot. Just when you think you have the plot discovered it turns into a different direction. Each scene was full of suspense and character players did a great job of keeping the movie interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it highly.,1288742400,,489,4.384615384615385
4171043,5,B003QO8TCI,"There was a tremendous amount of talent on the cast and crew of this production, and it really comes across on screen!  Bravo to Mark, Michael, John, Tracy and everyone else who worked so hard for so long to turn a great script into a fantastic film that everyone on the team can be proud of.  If you have not seen the trailer, it can be seen in IMDB or Darkwoodsmovie.com

Mission accomplished ... get ready for the next one!

4171044,4,B003QO8TCI,"This movie, a psychological thriller with a ""Lolita""-like feel, was the brainchild of it's writer, producer, and lead actor, John Muscarnero.  One tagline for the film is ""the deeper you go, the darker it gets"", and that fits this plot perfectly. It's another film that flew under the radar due to a small budget--it grossed an estimated $1 million--but delivered a story better than some of the big budget flicks from 2009.

Muscarnero plays Henry Branch, a caring man who brings his wife Susan--aptly played by Tracy Coogan--to a small house in a secluded wooded area where they can enjoy what little time they have left together in peace.  However, when Henry saves a disturbed teen named Alicia (Mary Kate Wiles) and is subsequently asked by the local sheriff (played by James Russo, recognizable as a convenience store robber in 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and about 100 films since--who's gonna refuse his stare?) to take care of her for a while, the situation starts to deteriorate.  As his wife succumbs to slow dementia caused by her illness, Henry Branch slowly succumbs to the ample attention Alicia gives him.  That's the setup; you'll need to check out ""Dark Woods"" for yourself to see how it all ends.

Muscarnero creates a gloomy atmosphere that appropriately gets darker as the movie proceeds.  In the relationships that develop onscreen, you can almost feel the tension and frustration of the main characters.  I definitely liked Muscarnero's writing and producing better than his acting, but overall the movie created enough interest that I wanted to know whether the Branches would make it out of the woods.",1285977600,6,1636,4.988970588235294

8402358,3,B003QO8TCI,"I'm not really sure exactly what the point of this movie was.

Basically it's the story of dysfunctional man who is caring for his wife dying of cancer and IMHO makes a series of very poor decisions which is to the detriment of his wife, who he claims to love but ultimately murders.

Other than that Mrs. Lincoln.......

It was too long and drawn out, you could pick up on the entire story within the first half hour but it was completely unnecessary to drag this out to the bitter end; it simply isn't fair to the audience.

I think this would have been better handled as a documentary instead of being offered as an engaging form of entertainment.
I suppose for some people this is, but it didn't work that way for me.",1423267200,,721,4.358208955223881

8402361,2,B003QO8TCI,"I was unable to watch the entire movie, it was that enjoyable. I never felt invested in the characters, and the acting was weak for the most part. Perhaps it would have gotten better as it moved along, but I had seen enough. Since I did not stick it out to see if it improved, I gave it two stars rather than one.",1403049600,,313,3.984126984126984
