8323702,5,B001NE4BE8,"A must have. Excellent and VERY touching interviews from people who survived this genocide. Learned a lot, a good history review as well. Bought several to give as gifts to educate non-Armenian friends. I got nothing but positive feedback from all of them, and I asked them to do the same. So they're going to buy a few & give it to their friends etc etc etc.....",1323216000,8,363,4.432835820895522
8323703,5,B001NE4BE8,This documentary is truly incredible.  The Turkish government has committed a premeditated crime against the defenseless Armenians.  It was the Armenian Holocaust.  This movie provides a birds eye view of that great crime.  Everybody should own a copy of this movie.,1242864000,22,266,5.414634146341464
