Hackers: 2.35:1 widescreen
War Games: ? 4:3 widescreen [what I call ""fake"" widescreen]
  black bars all around, you have to zoom to fill a widescreen tv.
Solarbabies: 2.35:1 widescreen
War Games 2: 1.85:1 widescreen

Hope this helps",1306972800,2,276,5.066666666666666

 HACKERS: Basically a squad of misfit teens try to stop a super villain from unleashing a dangerous computer virus, this huge ball of cyber-fluff is a ton of fun. You'll laugh at the inaccuracies portrayed in the computer use; the teams of rogue computer experts acts more like a team of Shadow Run street deckers than real life computer experts. But that's part of the fun. There's a big helping of early 90's cheese, a generous dose of humor and a creamy dollop of Angelina Jolie as the cyber vixen. It also stars Matthew Lillard, Fisher Stevens and Lorraine Bracco.

WARGAMES: This venerable old morality play stresses the dangers of mankind turning its responsibilities over to machines. Sort of the reverse of Frankenstein really, instead of playing God in this movie we are creating one. It was ahead if its time in showing the potential and the danger of entering the Computer Age.

SOLAR BABIES: This movie tries to combine The Road Warrior with bubbly roller skating teens, eco-warriorship and 80's music and hair. It's an odd combination and whether or not it works for you depends on your current state of mind and tolerance for the specific flavor of cheese that only the 80's could ferment. Here we have a rag-tag group of kids who like to play roller hockey finding a magical orb and using it to battle a Totalitarian Regime. Nowadays this movie would never be taken seriously but its naivet adds to its charm.

WARGAMES THE DEAD CODE: This is just a flat, terrible re-hash of the original Wargames, substituting terrorists for nuclear brinkmanship.

SPACE CAMP: ""This one time at space camp....""  Participants in NASA's Space Camp can undergo a limited version of real astronaut training. Well for a few of them the training gets a little too real. Lea Thompson, Kelly Preston, and some teen age punks are accidently blasted into space, along with astronaut Kate Capshaw. You'd think being stuck in space with those three ladies would be a fantastic weekend, even with Joaquin Phoenix along as a whiny brat. Well it is, until the oxygen starts to run out. Whu-Oh! Luckily Tom Skerrit is on the ground to help out.

ALIEN FROM L.A. A nerdy teenager goes looking for her missing archaeologist father, and stumbles into a strange underground civilization. Kathy Ireland looks amazing but the rest of the movie is almost physically painful to watch.",1287532800,6,2504,4.845433255269321
