8095971,5,B000C6NPFO,This is an awesome DVD collection of gardening tips.  I would highly recommend purchasing this DVD if you are interested in more natural ways to take care of garden pests and fertilizing tips.,1302307200,4,192,4.818181818181818
8095972,1,B000C6NPFO,The shipper shipped product very quickly. The dvds got lost or stolen in the mail.  I never received them.  I notified the shipper.  My money was refunded immediately.  Yes I would order from the shipper again.,1301011200,,210,4.75
8095973,5,B000C6NPFO,Easy to follow instructions and my plants are growing like crazy! I mainly got it for the veggie dvd but I watched the other and they are all really good. I definately recommend Jerry Baker!,1279584000,5,190,4.457142857142857
8095974,3,B000C6NPFO,I like the information but I was suppose to be able to print Jerry Bakers recipes to my printer but as of yet that has not happened. The program won't open using the information provided with the dvd.,1207785600,,200,4.2894736842105265
8095975,2,B000C6NPFO,I was really excited about this until I sat down with the recipes and started calculating how much beer and soap I would have to buy to fertilize my 6 acres. Even 3 acres would be ridiculous.,1179619200,,191,4.1891891891891895
