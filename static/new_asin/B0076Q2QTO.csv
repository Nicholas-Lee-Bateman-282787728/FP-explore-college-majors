5058278,5,B0076Q2QTO,Anything featuring the great Boris Karloff is worth it!,1444176000,,55,5.222222222222222
5058279,5,B0076Q2QTO,"Being a Boris Karloff fan I had never heard of, much less seen this movie. I just had to check it out. Sure glad I did. I found it to be a creepy, dark, and fun movie to watch. The comic rellief was a bit off, but , well, it was 1933. In parts of the movie, Boris still moves like the Frankenstein creature. This movie is well worth checking out.",1360800000,2,346,3.887323943661972

5058281,2,B0076Q2QTO,"Mr. Boris Karloff was the epitome of good old horror movies. Sadly, this movie was boring and did not do him justice. I guess it was an old film and the special effects were inferior.",1481587200,,183,4.257142857142857
5058282,5,B0076Q2QTO,Excellent old classic scary movie they don't make these kind of movies anymore I wish Amazon would have more movies like this covered under prime,1481500800,,145,4.84
5058283,5,B0076Q2QTO,"This movie is quite scary.  Karloff's performance is exceptional.  Modern viewers will need to overlook the 1930s dialogue perhaps.  This story reminded me of the 1970s television series ""The Night Gallery"" by Rod Serling.",1479168000,,222,5.470588235294118

5058288,3,B0076Q2QTO,They must have written the script as they went along. But that made it funny.,1475625600,,77,4.2
5058289,5,B0076Q2QTO,beautifully photographed.,1475539200,,25,12.0
5058290,4,B0076Q2QTO,"Beautiful cinematography to start with. Excellent acting by Boris and Ralph (of course), but the male lead is a whiny little loser and there is far too much chit-chat. The ending makes no sense, but there are some great scenes of Gothic suspense leading up to it. I enjoyed it and recommend watching ""The Ghoul"" at least once and see what you think of it for yourself.",1475107200,2,368,4.507462686567164
5058291,4,B0076Q2QTO,"I love these old movies and watching the development of cinematography.  Bores Karloff was a magnificent actor - but the choice to give him such bushy, creepy eyebrows really adds to the effect.",1474848000,,194,4.878787878787879
5058292,4,B0076Q2QTO,"This is classic 30's British Cinema.

So many things about it would have absolutely shattered the senses back then.  Also a great reminder about how striking Karloff was, even today, HIS portrayals and interpretations are still a part of popular culture 85 years later.

Really quite remarkable.

A must see for movie Buffs.",1474848000,2,324,5.056603773584905

5058297,4,B0076Q2QTO,good story.  a little dark at times makes it harder to see.  filmed out of US so few recognizeable faces.,1469923200,,105,4.2

5058301,5,B0076Q2QTO,"The late Mr. Karloff in my humble opinion was one of the most overlooked and underrated actors in movie history. He could play any role from monster to murderer, he could be scary or charming, extremely talented man!  I would recommend The Ghoul or any other Karloff movie to viewers..",1463529600,,285,4.7
5058302,4,B0076Q2QTO,"A fun, well-made movie with spectacular set pieces. If you're into vintage horror films, then you should watch this; in fact, I'd pit this against some of the other Universal monster classics; it definitely beats ""The Invisible Man."" Granted, it's a Boris Karloff monster-movie, so it's a little predictable. But the characters were charming, and the main character's monomania was truly unnerving; and there was just enough esoterica and pseudo-pagan mystic mumbo-jumbo to make it credible in a folksy way. All in all, a rewarding and deeply watchable horror film.",1462838400,3,565,5.288888888888889
5058303,2,B0076Q2QTO,"Couldn't finish it.  It was very boring and slow paced.  Not one of Karloff's best films, although his performance was acceptable.",1462406400,,130,5.142857142857143
5058304,5,B0076Q2QTO,A great Karloff film that was considered lost for many years. A copy was found in the Chek republic with german subtitles which had been viewed by the occupying Nazis. The film has been restored to its original pristine format. Rachel.,1462406400,,235,4.7560975609756095

5058306,4,B0076Q2QTO,The Ghoul is a good movie.. It has the same actor who played Dr. Pretorius in Bride Of Frankenstein. Karloff does his thing well enough to keep things lively and somewhat creepy. The film is dated so it's not scary. Though there are scenes that the modern day viewer could see as being scary back in the day. It's a creepy film. Worth checking out.,1459209600,,348,4.369230769230769
5058307,5,B0076Q2QTO,"If you like movies like the mummy with Boris Karloff, you will enjoy this one.  We certainly did.",1458000000,,97,4.388888888888889
5058308,5,B0076Q2QTO,surprisingly good. Great sets and camera lighting. Sophisticated for 1933.,1457568000,,74,6.5

5058317,5,B0076Q2QTO,"A film that was lost for so many years. Only a badly damaged negative was found to strike a paper print of the film---with Hungarian subtitles. And then the DVD was quietly released with little or no fanfare and it is absolutely gorgeous and one of Karloff's best British films. Look at the cast! Ralph Richardson, Cedric Hardwicke, Ernest Thesiger....And an absolutely chilling climax scene for pre-code film.",1447891200,4,410,5.044117647058823
5058318,4,B0076Q2QTO,"Karloff is always a great monster. This movie was basically the mummy but without wrappings, which let you see Karloff's face and iffy makeup.

It is a fun, old school horror movie.",1446422400,,181,4.65625
5058319,5,B0076Q2QTO,"For fans of ""The Old Dark House,"" Boris Karloff goes from mute to an almost-undead and Ernest Thesiger goes from Welsh to Scottish. Classic British horror!",1446076800,,155,5.0

8511107,4,B0076Q2QTO,"Well-preserved print, perhaps the best I have ever seen from this film year (1933). The film image quality is excellent, largely free of the usual noise in films that have survived from this era, and the sound recording quality nearly matches the visual. See a bit of it for the print quality, anyway.
I could not offer it enough attention to keep up with the story on the first run-through, but I often appreciated the splendid lighting of this black and white film, and also frame composition of scenes. See Cedrick Hardwicke as a repugnant Dickensian villain. Poll: do you think that Karloff's character's nephew, who shows up at about 27 minutes in, is a ringer for F. Scott Fitzgerald?",1521244800,,690,4.758333333333334

8511109,3,B0076Q2QTO,"Kind of a British version of ""The Mummy"". But they couldn't do a mummy, because Mr. Karloff had done that movie in the US the year before. Good though.",1501977600,,151,4.241379310344827
