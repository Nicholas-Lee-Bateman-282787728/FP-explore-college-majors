4462275,5,B004SEUJL4,"After a couple lose their only daughter in a horrible accident, desperation leads them to try occult means to bring her back. Unfortunately, things don't go according to plan, leading to horror, despair, and carnage. WAKE WOOD is a tremendously unsettling, atmospheric creeper w/ a gradually tightening sense of suffocating dread. It's also one of the best supernatural thrillers I've ever seen. If you enjoy stories like THE MONKEY'S PAW, PET SEMETARY, HELLBOUND (BOOK OF THE DEAD), or BOBBY from Dan Curtis' DEAD OF NIGHT (TV) anthology, then WW will make you smile w/ grim delight!

The acting from the main characters was quite good (I would expect nothing less from Aidan) and I really felt sympathy for the parents.  Yes, it is predictable to some degree, with similarities to the ""Pet Sematary"" theme, but a little more complicated than that.  And the ending was not completely what I expected.  One non-graphic sex scene, very tastefully handled, no real foul language, but a whole lot of blood.  A whole lot.",1503964800,3,554,4.778947368421052

4462287,3,B004SEUJL4,Very straight forward scary movie. The plot was easy to figure out very early in the movie.

4462288,2,B004SEUJL4,"Never been a fan of Gore flicks, and this is definitely that. Would have preferred they spent more time on the paranormal aspects and less on the horrific (SPOILER ALERT) death of the girl child.

Over the top gore does have a negative impact on people, especially those who claim it doesn't  bother them. If seeing a child ripped to bloody shreds by a dog is NOT disturbing, then you may already be beyond psychological assistance.

This movie is a foreign film, made in Ireland. Some of the scenery is worth seeing as Ireland has always been a beautiful land. The concept is intriguing, but the execution here was far below US film standards and drastically below good taste. I admit I have mellowed over the years as to what I find tasteful. I grew up on kung fu and samurai movies. Plenty of violence and gore....but always with a purpose. What this motion picture depicts was not necessary. My child was attacked by a dog and luckily was not mauled. But he almost had his ear bitten off. So I was most uneasy when watching this low-budget attempt at horror.",1501372800,,1062,4.549738219895288

4462291,3,B004SEUJL4,This film uses gore and an ancient town ritual as cheap way to try and achieve a scary and creepy feel but it never succeeds.

4462306,5,B004SEUJL4,"Wow!  I mean, seriously, WOW!  As an independent filmmaker myself, I was quite taken aback by this clever, well written, cinematically defined and exceptionally directed film.  It is 'different' in so many ways.  The acting was extraordinary!  This is not so much of an 'edge of your seat' type of film as it is thought-provoking.  And I'm not talking one of those 'Oh, yeah, I knew it would turn out like that!' kind of films.  This is a ride that goes through to the very last minute of filming.  There are numerous surprises, but clearly a lot of time was put into making this ingenious horror twist believable.  Obviously it has to do with a foreign urban myth, but the true genius lies in how it was directed.  By the end of the film I was simply dumb-founded by the magic employed to make me a believer of the story-line.  FYI, I have no ties to the making of this film (I wish I did).  Additionally, I haven't heard a lot of hype about it prior to buying and watching the DVD version.  As a matter of fact, I bought this film because it was a good price and I was truly expecting a low budget 'B' movie that might possibly give me a good laugh and I could pick it to pieces over 'post' mistakes.  Boy, was I in for a shocker!  This is a film that has earned its' five stars and credible credentials.  You really should watch it.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed, and if you are then clearly you are out to be the one to argue any point of a movie whether it is good or bad just for the attention!",1441238400,,1509,4.2020905923344944

For die-hard fans of the genre, like me, it's worth adding to the collection if the price is right.",1405900800,,460,4.8354430379746836
4462320,3,B004SEUJL4,"Wake Wood (David Keating, 2011)

David Keating has made just two feature films in his career to date, the 1996 dramedy Last of the High Kings and the 2010 supernatural thriller Wake Wood. You're already spanning a whole lot of genre there (and that's not counting the two documentaries he made between). He seems to handle everything with equal aplomb; while Wake Wood is not a little derivative of a couple of previous movies (more on that later), it's stylish and fun, not to mention put on by as crack a team of players as one is likely to find in one place.

Plot: Patrick (Game of Thrones' Aidan Gillen), a veterinarian, and his wife Louise (The Children's Eva Birthistle) are still mourning the death of their daughter Alice (Eliot and Me's Ella Connolly in her screen debut) at the jaws of a dog under Patrick's care when he shutters his existing practice and relocates to the isolated farm town of Wake Wood. Things are going along well, but the family remain unable to get around their grief. They discover that Wake Wood is hiding a secretgiven the right set of circumstances, it is possible to bring back a dead person to be reunited with his or her loved ones for three days. Alice is ready to go ahead immediately, but Patrick has reservationsif losing the girl was bad the first time, how much worse might it be on Alice's fragile psyche a second time?

There is more to it than that, but you're getting well into spoiler territory at that point (reading the IMDB boards will easily turn up what happens if you're so inclined). The movie plays like a combination of Pet Sematary (the supernatural element) and Don't Look Now (the wife being constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdownand we note in passing that Eva Birthistle has really bad luck with kids, at least on celluloid). Because of that, well, most of the twists and turns in the script are going to seem somewhat familiar. Where Keating and screenwriter Brendan McCarthy shine is in giving these familiar paths some interesting new greenery for the wanderer to peruse. (You'll not soon forget the birth scene.) Sometimes that's enough, and while the plot elements of the film are easily traced to other relatively recent movies (though at this point, well, Pet Sematary is almost thirty years old and Don't Look Now turned forty last year), I don't think you could call the plot elements McCarthy borrowed from either clich yet. For some people that's not enough, and if that's you, well, okay, give this one a miss. But I think you're missing out; this is an amazing cast (I didn't even get to mention one of my favorite actors, Timothy Spall, who plays the town elder, nor Briain Gleeson, Brendan's son, an apple who definitely didn't fall far from the tree, Philomena's Ruth McCabe is the village wise woman, and I could go on all day) with an interesting, and slick, tale to tell. ***",1398384000,,2867,4.650887573964497
4462321,4,B004SEUJL4,"Classic horror film aficionados will welcome the return of Hammer Films, the company that was at the forefront of the horror film resurgence in the 1950s with re-makes of such classic films as Frankenstein, Dracula and just about any other monster you can remember.

The demise of the studio in the 1970s was the result of changing tastes as much as economics. With the tendency to go in the sickening direction of that shameful sub-genre called Torture Porn, it is a welcome relief to see Hammer Films poised to return to the game. At least if the intelligent thriller Wake Wood is any indication.

WAKE WOOD was the first film produced by Hammer in thirty years. While it is not flawless, it is still very good, with a theme not unlike the original version of The Wicker Man, in that it draws upon pagan customs in rural Great Britain.

As in many Hammer films, WAKE WOOD is set in a remote town (called Wake Wood). The isolation of the main characters in this setting is integral to the suspense as it means they are basically on their own against whatever they encounter.

When a young couple, Patrick and Louise, lose their beloved daughter, they become aware of a pagan resurrection ritual. Eager to bring their daughter back to life if only long enough to say a proper goodbye, the grieving parents agree to participate in the ritual. But at what cost? And who really pays the price? Classic thriller stuff.

The film is very atmospheric and character actor Timothy Spall is particularly good. He more than compensates for the one-note performance of Aidan Gillen as Patrick.

A bonus on the DVD is the deleted scenes. Usually such extras serve no real purpose, but it is very interesting to watch the long version of the resurrection scene and see how wisely the filmmakers were to cut it down.

WAKE WOOD is tasteful, well-orchestrated horror. Welcome back, Hammer! We missed you!",1397433600,,1889,4.723404255319149
4462322,5,B004SEUJL4,"Thoroughly enjoyed Wake Wood.  The story kept me intrigued and interested which is a relief after the couple of duds I've seen in the last few days.  The acting (actors) were top notch - I just really enjoyed this slightly creepy deep-seeded witchery, slightly voodoo-ish film.  If you're looking for great entertainment, there is gore and goo, and a bit of cover-your-eyes,ooey scenes that really got to me, but I like that in my horror flicks.  I live for those moments in my horror!

I'll give this one a 5+ stars and I'm so glad I gambled on this one - it didn't disappoint, in fact JACKPOT!",1390867200,,595,4.5233644859813085
4462323,3,B004SEUJL4,"There's some cumbersome predictability here, but overall, this is a nice, self-contained, macabre film.  It's got a strong voice and atmosphere.  Watching it felt like reading a Clive Barker short story.",1377475200,,203,5.516129032258065
4462324,4,B004SEUJL4,"Patrick and Louise move to the small village of Wake Wood after losing their daughter in a horrific accident. It is here that they stumble upon a magic ritual that is being performed by the locals which allows the recently deceased to return home to their families for three days, so long as they abide by a strict set of rules. In their desperation, Patrick and Louise attempt to break the rules in order to get their daughter back, but the consequences are far more horrible than they could ever have imagined. The mood is set for mystery and suspense in WAKE WOOD, a stunning Irish Horror film that calls back to more traditional tales of terror. Patrick and Louise are played by Aidan Gillen and Eva Birthistle, who express their grief in two widely different ways. Patrick becomes lost in his work as a veterinary doctor, while Louise becomes increasingly more despondent. Their looming feelings of guilt and loss are put on display in a pair of expressive performances. It becomes easier to accept their decision to follow through with the dire ritual as a result. Ella Connolly later gives her own bone-chilling debut as well as young Alice. Although neither the source of the magic nor the extent of its power are ever fully explained, we take these things for granted after becoming fully immersed in the story. The dreary setting and overwhelming sense of dread that encompass the film are accentuated even further by Chris Maris' atmospheric cinematography and Michael Convertino's unsettling score. Director David Keating has done a marvelous job in revitalizing the grand Gothic traditions of the newly reformed Hammer Film Productions.

4462325,4,B004SEUJL4,How far would you go for someone you love. This movie has a pretty good plot line which blends suspense and the supernatural to create at times an edge of your seat thriller. It's actually worth your time to give it a chance.,1365033600,,225,4.255813953488372
4462326,2,B004SEUJL4,"I came into this movie expecting something other than what was delivered and I suspect that this may have impacted my overall enjoyment of the movie. From the very beginning Wake Wood has a truncated quality to it which makes it difficult for the viewer to connect with the poorly realized characters and their situation -- almost as if the film makers felt that the initial tragedy would be sufficient to buy the viewers interest and sympathy for the whole of the movie.

Wake Wood inhabits an uneasy space between a mystery, occult thriller, and slasher film and manages to fail on all three counts though if it had simply focused on the occult thriller aspect there were a number of intriguing ideas that were barely explored and seemed to exist as window dressing though they were by far the most interesting aspects of the film.",1355961600,2,833,4.705479452054795
4462327,3,B004SEUJL4,"I love weird movies.  This is definitely one for the books.  I won't give spoilers because everyone that has an interest should satisfy it regardless of what anyone writes.  Let's just say that it has an interesting premise - how far would you go to reunite with the ones that have gone before you?  Could you be satisfied with the amount of time you were granted for just a few more moments?  The ending is totally unexpected!

I usually don't give reviews unless it's a 5 star rating.  I would have loved to have given this one 5 starst,  but the movie could have been just a bit more than what it was.  I wanted more.  Especially of the end of the movie.  What did her sacrifice give birth to?",1353456000,,696,4.276923076923077
4462328,4,B004SEUJL4,"God willing, I'll never know how horrible losing a child is.  Hell, I'd have a hard time dealing with any serious injury coming to one of my kids.  A broken bone, or something that needs stitches; best not to think too much about something like that.  So when Patrick and Louise are offered the chance to spend three more days with their daughter Alice, who was attacked and killed by a dog a year earlier, I can totally understand their desire to say yes.  On the flipside, though, if you know it's only for three days and that, at the end of those three days, you have to say goodbye again...how much harder would that be?

Well, when you lie on your application, maybe not so tough.  See, the rules state the dead can only be brought back if they've been dead less than a year.  Patrick tells his boss Arthur that Alice died 11 months 2 weeks and 2 days ago.  That wasn't the truth.  So when Alice comes back from the dead with a few new habits, like skinning the family dog and nailing its carcass to the door, or mauling bulls and horses, you have to expect stuff like that when you don't read the fine print.

WAKE WOOD is the work of Irish filmmaker David Keating.  Set in Ireland, with Irish actors, it all works out pretty well.  The story focuses on Patrick and Louise and their journey through the levels of grief.  Not long after Alice's death, vet Patrick and pharmacist Louise move from the city to the village of Wake Wood, but after 9 months and no end in sight to their depression, Louise asks Patrick to drive her to the station; she wants to leave.  Along the way, some car trouble leads them to Arthur's house where Louise witnesses something very strange going on in the back yard.  Later, when Arthur learns of their intention to leave Wake Wood, he offers them the chance to spend a last three days with Alice to properly say their goodbyes.  The only catch is, once they go through with it, they're bound to Wake Wood and can never leave.  They agree to the condition, lie about how long ago Alice died, and things pretty much go downhill from there.

WAKE WOOD isn't a movie that's treading any new ground.  The world, and the horror genre, certainly isn't hurting for ""small village with a secret"" stories, nor even for ""dead child returns to his parents and turns out to be evil"" stories.  So what sets WAKE WOOD apart?  What makes this the movie to watch instead of any of the millions of similar movies that came before?

Honestly, nothing.

While WAKE WOOD is a pretty good movie with decent performances, there's nothing new here.  Maybe the details are different, the names and dates have been changed to avoid copyright infringement, but overall we've seen this movie a time or two already.

That's not to diminish WAKE WOOD's impact; it's still an effective movie, especially when Patrick realizes what Alice is and what he has do put an end to it.  The walk through the woods with Alice slung over his shoulder, whispering in her father's ear that she doesn't want to go back, doesn't want to be on her own again, is powerful stuff.  It's just too bad we know where things are going from here.  In fact, there are so many similar aspects to other movies in WAKE WOOD, I'm surprised Anthony Shaffer and Stephen King didn't share writing credits.

I'm not sure the pace of the movie is what it should be.  At 90 minutes, it was about 40 minutes in before Alice was brought back, and those next three days seemed to go by way too fast.  Also, while I'm definitely not one to shy away from gore, I think some of the blood and whatnot used here was approaching gratuitous.  The ripping out the heart scene...necessary?  Not really.  Not even a little bit.

Aiden Gillen and Eva Birthistle give solid performances as the grieving parents while Ella Connolly as the back from the dead Alice is just creepy enough.  Timothy Spall as Arthur is fun to watch as usual, if a bit hammy as this particular character.

I think WAKE WOOD serves its purpose for what it is, but given how little there is here that's actually new, I don't see this movie making much of a splash.  I could see it serving as this generation's PET SEMATARY, set it Ireland, but even that...trust me, there's nothing in WAKE WOOD near as creepy as Miko Hughes saying, ""Now I wanna play with yoooouuuuuuuuu.""

Not a GREAT movie, but it was pretty good.",1346630400,3,4347,4.4613434727503165

4462330,5,B004SEUJL4,"The rebirth of Hammer Films of England has taken a long time coming.  Over the past few years, trickles of releases such as 'THE RESIDENT' and the remake of the excellent Swedish Vampire tale 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN' titled 'LET ME IN' have not made a dent in the Horror field yet got critics titillated with interest. This latest effort, Director David Keating's 'WAKE WOOD' should have put Hammer back on the map but didn't.  Boasting beautiful atmospheric Irish landscape photography by Chris Maris, a melancholic music score by Michael Convertino, and an incredible performance by actress Eva Birthistle, it emerges as a wonderful retro makeover to the old Horror tale 'THE MONKEY'S PAW' mixed with Author Stephen King's hommage 'PET CEMETARY' but with a twist, imagine having a loved one brought back for a limited time only and ,of course, you would try to diviate from that possibility by breaking the rules. That is what the crux of the story incapsulates.  You have read the other reviews explaining the plot so we should concentrate on the look and feel of the film which gives an eerie quality which has been lacking in many Horror releases these past years.  It's possible its lack of distribution was the catylist in the film's obscurity and it is a shame.  If not for the hard to take climax , it is one of the best Horror films of the decade and highly recommended.  Released under the Exclusive Films Label which was the origin of the Hammer name, it deserves a better reputation and has got this viewer anticipating more great Horrors from them in the future.",1334361600,2,1574,4.726277372262774
4462331,4,B004SEUJL4,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...

This 2011 movie was recommended to me, so I had to see it.  It's a very interesting, bizarre, and different Hammer horror movie.  This movie marked Hammer's return to making movies.  Ironically, it really doesn't have the same feel and atmosphere of the Hammer horror movies that were so popular in the 1950's, '60s, and '70s.  Like the old Hammer movies, it's low budget, but this movie is a lot more gruesome and bloody than the goriest and bloodiest Hammer movies from decades ago.  It's more in tune with what contemporary audiences want and expect from horror movies in general.  In contrast, the new version of ""The Woman In Black"" (2012), also a Hammer movie, is more in tune with the old Hammer movies.  However, I did enjoy ""Wake Wood"" and its bizarre plot, unique camera angles, and very different and unique musical score by Michael Convertino.  I think the music is one of this movie's greatest assets.  That and the camera angles and overall cinematography and feel.  This is one of those movies where the viewer needs to suspend all disbelief and just accept the plot for what it is, weirdness and all.

Overall, this movie is definitely worth a look.  I highly recommend it.",1329782400,8,1297,4.68141592920354
4462332,5,B004SEUJL4,"Coming from somebody who's moved to a small town, you definitely get the feeling that something is going on behind the scene that you're just not a part of. Similarly, a couple moves to the small town of ""Wake Wood."" Most of its people have resided in for several generations, but the husband proves useful in that he is able to treat their livestock. For him and his wife, this is the last chance to try and move on from the tragic loss of their daughter. Like most small towns Wake Wood has something that makes it unique, which is a ritual of sorts that many of the towns people choose to go through it. However, when this couple decide to through it something goes terribly wrong. Wake Wood is creepy and suspenseful. I think the scenery really added to it, but the acting was good too.

4462333,1,B004SEUJL4,"""Wake Wood"" is another in a long list of bring 'em back alive movies of which most were far superior such as ""Pet Sematary"", ""The Monkey's Paw"", ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"", ""Practical Magic"".

Nothing memorable in the acting - typical TV quality. Even the supposedly great performance by Connolly as Alice was just a young girl acting like a young girl. Just a few lines and lots of playing and running around.

Script was dependent on cheap effects, such as putting three sticks together and stringing beads between them in abacus fashion as the magical bring 'em-back-tool, was just cheap looking. Especially cheap was the positioning of beads to questions such as the fine/coarseness of hair; moist/dryness of skin; a morning or afternoon person; favorite animal - that's magic? Next they take a dead person and cut their spinal cord and crush the rib cage and cover the person in cow dung then set the moist dung on fire (not sure how that's possible!) which resulted in a concrete cocoon (somehow) then the resurrected person crawls out. Finally, the alive girl, then dead girl, then alive girl, then dead girl is back underground and reaches a hand up through the earth to pull mama down with her so she has company or something like that - wasn't clear.
Could never figure out how, in movies where people (or ex-people) come out of or get pulled into the earth, can take place in compacted soil. Looks good as an effect but makes zero sense.",1327622400,,1452,4.757936507936508
4462334,2,B004SEUJL4,"I can't believe Hammer is trying to be like the shock and gore movies coming out these days. The opening scene of this movie was despicable. Whoever thought it would be OK to present such imagery in a film is truly disturbed. Hammer is supposed to be about gothic horror. That is something there is a big void in nowadays and they are in a good position to make movies exactly like what they used to make. Hollywood started making Hammer style films in the 1970s and that is why they quit in the first place. I thought Hammer recognized this and was resuming from where they left off, but no. If this is what they are going to be involved with maybe they should just go back into retirement so as to not spoil their reputation.",1327449600,3,727,4.313868613138686

The story of resurrection has been done a million times (think Pet Semetary).  But seeing an innocent child brought back to life only to slowly turn into something sinister was a lot of fun to watch!  I thought the fact that the entire town was in on this tradition of magical rebirth was a pretty new twist, and the specific rules given to each chosen family made it actually seem like a rather realistic situation that could occur in any town.  The acting was pretty solid.  The grieving parents make their pain known once they lose their child, and I love when they finally realize that, yes, their resurrected daughter must go back where she belongs since she is no longer the sweet child they knew before her accident.  And for such a frightening tale, there's really not that much blood or acts of violent horror shown, which is something a lot of viewers may enjoy about this movie.  However, I wasn't crazy about the end.  I was left asking way too many questions.  To sum it all up: definitely worth your time to wake up and watch this one!",1323388800,,1174,4.521327014218009

4462337,4,B004SEUJL4,"Wake Wood fit into the community sub genre of horror, a genre which is usually about some remote town that have bizarre rituals going on that everyone in the community is aware of except the newly arrived main characters, notable movies in this sub genre of horror would include The Wicker Man and Wolfhound (the horror movie not the fantasy one.) Wake Wood do not do much to deviate from the standard formula in this type of film, a young couple have moved to the rural town of wake wood to try to get over the dead of their young daughter Alice, soon the young couple discovers that Wake Wood harbors a secret, the townsfolk know a ritual that will resurrect a dead loved one to give them three more days with their family before they are sent back into the ground. Off course our heroes have this ritual performed to bring Alice back, but the question is can they give their daughter back to the grave once their three days are up?

Wake Wood is a suspenseful film that both manages to stay true to the formula of it's genre and at the same time be original. The story of a family that get their dead daughter back but only for a short amount of time is heartbreaking and powerful, at the same time the viewer know that something is wrong and that something horrible is just around the corner. Wake Wood is a low budget film but they have really spent what money they wisely and Wake Wood is a beautiful film with a strong subject matter.

One thing I personally do not like about Wake Wood is all the violence to animals. I know many might laugh at this, but personally if a person is brutally killed in a horror movie then that is to be expected and I am fine with that, but grotesque violence to animals that make me uneasy. I am not docking the movie any stars for this since this is just a personal preference but I really could do without all the animals getting killed and mutilated, yes I know it is just movie effects but it still is not something I like to see.

Wake Wood have a solid story that is well phased, I really enjoyed myself during this movie and there where never a time when I begun to think about what I wanted for dinner or anything else like that, I was completely engrossed in the story and that is a good thing so thumbs up for that. I would however have preferred a bit more of an explanation in the end, like why did the fact that Alice had been dead over a year have the effect that it did for example. That being said while it would be nice with a bit more detailing here and there it is not strictly necessary, the story to wrap up in a decent way and I at least was very satisfied with it.

Wake Wood's actors do a good job, particularly the little girl who play Alice. The music in the movie add to the suspense and like I said the visuals of the film are beautiful, frequently disturbing but still beautiful, especially the resurrection ritual which is so gritty and and the same time so fascinating. All in all Wake Wood is a well crafted entry in the community horror genre and if you can stomach the frequent violence to animals and Alice's rather brutal death scene in the start of the movie then this film is well worth a watch. Wake Wood might have been made on a small budget but it is quality all the way through.",1321142400,5,3261,4.246376811594203

Not Great, not Bad. But If you have a collection like I do, this movie belongs there. Young couple moves to a peacful small rural town, and discover that they can temporarily (3 Days Max) bring back their young daughter who died OVER a year ago. The catch is, the dead person must not be dead MORE than a year, or the results can be disasterous. The couple lies about the timeline, and the daughtar comes back to them. AND, the couple is NOT supposed to take the daughter out of City Limits. Those are the rules. And they break them both.  Somewhat unusual theme. No Brand Name actors here.

Welcome to WAKE WOOD, an Irish village that becomes the new home for a young couple trying to deal with the tragic death of their little girl a year earlier.
While all seems normal, a dark but intriguing secret brings hope to the grieving parents...but at what cost.
WAKE WOOD is one of the new films made under a revised Hammer films banner and is quite well done.  Aidan Gallen and Eva Birthistle are good as the parents; character actor Timothy Spall is fine as the eccentric town leader; and Emma Connolly is charming and chilling as little Alice.

4462347,5,B004SEUJL4,"Slow and deliberate! Those two adjectives describe this movie to a tee. This movie doesn't move along at a snail's pace for lack of imagination and expertise on the part of the production team. On the contrary, Wake Wood moves along slowly as in the significance of the term ""Slow Burn"". Hence, the second word, ""deliberate"". You've seen the reviews claiming that we've been there, done that. But you'll also notice that the majority of those also state that this is a fresh take on an old story, or combination of stories, primarily, ""The Wicker Man"" and ""Pet Sematary"".

Where remakes or rehashes fail is when they try to change an already preconceived idea into an over-the-top, no-holds-barred, Hollywoodesque presentation, when what made the original idea work in the first place, as is the case with Wake Wood, was the simple craziness and human-ness that was built into it. The feeling that even though the idea or plot may be morbid and almost unthinkable, it is not beyond any person in this world to commit such an act given the proper circumstances, especially when it involves a loved one as dear as an only daughter.

Wake Wood is an exceptional film, full of dread, despair, and nail-biting edge-of-your-seatedness. It was a well-filmed, well-acted, and well-told story. It may be a bit unoriginal, but if we are going to be getting remakes of old tales, then this is the way to do it. It's fresh and wonderfully executed. It is claustrophobic in such a way that the viewer actually feels as if they are a resident of this godforsaken town.

4462352,4,B004SEUJL4,"Judge Patrick Rogers, DVD Verdict -- ""After a 30 year absence from film production, Hammer has made a triumphant return to the fold, by taking their old formula and retrofitting it with both a '70s atmospheric horror sensibility and just a smidge of new age horror gore. It should be said that Wake Wood is equal parts Pet Sematary and The Wicker Man (1973) with a fist-sized chunk of Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now thrown in for good measure. These connections with past horror masterpieces that Wake Wood cultivates are its greatest strength. And when I say ""horror masterpiece"" in relation to Pet Sematary, I'm of talking about the novel. The influences that the film wears on its sleeve never turn into a hollow pastiche like so many Tarantino films do. This is because it's not attempting to steal or regurgitate the things that have come before, but instead, the film chooses to embrace its influences while simultaneously attempting to bring something new to the table; something different and chillingly captivating. This is certainly not a film for people looking to have their pants scared off or to splash around in gristle and gore. It's refreshing to see horror films that don't want to take the easy way out by pandering to the audiences' most basic instincts but to instead take the path less travelled. Unfortunately, the Blu-ray presentation is uneven. The video ranges being crisp and sumptuous to looking like your average DV footage. Single scenes can go from looking cinematic and breathtaking to made-for-TV territory in a matter of seconds. Black levels are all over the place, never settling into a perfect pitch. The DTS-HD 5.1 Master track is more than a fair sight better, with dialogue registering too low at times, but that problem is few and far between. The extras are disappointing, with only a collection of deleted scenes taken out to tighten up the narrative. Wake Wood is the rare kind of horror film that truly manages to unsettle you. It may not hit all the right notes but it's worthy of your attention, if you're seeking something a little different.""",1310256000,2,2090,4.873595505617978
4462353,5,B004SEUJL4,"When most people think of horror in the 60's and 70's, we think of the films made at the British Hammer Studios. They had a successful run of Frankenstein, Dracula, and Mummy movies, as well as cult classics Captain Kronos, Vampire Hunter, Vampire Circus, and Vampire Lovers, driven by the likes of Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Caroline Monroe, Ingrid Pitt and even Raquel Welch in the 1966 classic One Million Years B.C., to name a few. Over the years the studio changed hands and suffered financial woes, but has recently re-entered the horror arena with the release of Wake Wood.

Patrick (Aiden Gillen - Game of Thrones) and Louise (Eve Birthistle - The Children) move to the remote community of Wake Wood after the brutal death of their daughter, Alice (Ella Connolly - debut), at the jaws of a savage dog. But they find out there's a way to say good-bye to her. All they have to do is follow a couple of teensy weensy rules.

After the death of their daughter, Patrick and Louise move to the town the movie is named for - Wake Wood, and as they are settling into a routine of veterinary practice and taking care of the new home, they are informed by Arthur (Timothy Spall - Harry Potter series) that there may be a way for them to spend three days with their daughter in order to say good-bye properly. But there are rules; first is that she can't have been gone for more than one year. Second is that she has to be back in the ground in three days, no longer. The third states she cannot go past the township limits. Finally, Patrick and Louise have to stay in Wake Wood, and be there when ever they are called, no questions asked. But, of course, something goes wrong; rules are broken; and penalties must be paid.

The initial description of Wake Wood seemed to be a rip-off of Pet Cemetery, but I was pleasantly surprised at the somewhat unique approach to the subject of reanimation. But this is not a monster movie, nor is it people torturing people. It's man tampering with the natural order of things, and not following the rules. Of course the rules are the main contributor to the plot, but the locale, a quaint town surrounded by an idyllic countryside that is the home of pagan ceremonies, that lends to the atmosphere of tension and fear, shrouded in tranquility. Oh yeah, reanimated, cute kids creep me out.

4462354,5,B004SEUJL4,"The more I see radically superior foreign-made horror movies, the more I'm inclined to abandon America's paltry, banal, sordid output.

""Wake Wood"" involves both the Swedish and Irish film boards, and it is a work of stylish, gothic-tinged terror that reminds me of the short stories of Nathaniel Hawthorne, the best works of Stephen King (apart from ""The Stand,"" mostly his shorter works), and the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wicker-Man-Limited-Edition/dp/B00005KHJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wicker Man (Limited Edition)</a>&nbsp;(the original, not the gawdawful Nicholas Cage version).

Despite the recognizable familiarity of the storyline, the material is elevated by attention to mood and most especially, performance.  This is a fine supernatural thriller that chills the viewer and doesn't insult her intelligence.  Having said that, it's not all cerebral--there are a few scenes of visceral gore as well...but the movie doesn't stand or fall on those moments.

And while the effectiveness of the story is not dependent on twists (things unspool pretty much as one would expect them to), it does end with a satisfying little quirk.",1309996800,5,1204,6.100591715976331
4462355,4,B004SEUJL4,"WAKE WOOD is a Hammer Films production/presentation with Hammer CEO Simon Oakes one of the driving forces behind getting the film made. It's officially listed as an Irish/Swedish co-production and features location shooting in Donegal with some studio work done in Sweden. Together they make up the fictional town of Wake Wood where it is possible to bring the dead back to life...but only for 3 days. There is a surprising amount of subtext under the traditional storyline that gives WAKE WOOD added depth. A young medical couple (he's a vet, she's a pharmacist) lose their 9 year old daughter in a vicious accident. They relocate to Wake Wood without knowing the town's secret. Once they find out, they go through a special ritual involving the whole village in order to get her back. Everything is fine at first but then things go horribly wrong.

What makes WAKE WOOD so intriguing is how it combines elements of DON'T LOOK NOW with those of the original WICKER MAN while remaining an original film in its own right. At 82 minutes (minus credits), it's lean and mean with no wasted footage and has a wonderfully creepy aura thanks to atmospheric cinematography and a haunting, unsettling music score. All the acting is top notch especially Timothy Spall as the village elder and Ella Connoly as the ressurected daughter. The quality control on all the new Hammer films has been top grade but up until recently they have had trouble finding audiences in America.

I get SO TIRED of watching women stand on the sidelines wringing their hands, while they just stand and watch some poor smuck that they've convinced to die for them get the life beat out of him.  It's 2018, and women are ""claimed"" ,at the end of a fight between two men like they are property and are allergic to weapons. But I digress, apart from the weak female role and predictable flash of female only nudity, this was classic horror. Recommended.",1527724800,,891,4.487654320987654

8439667,4,B004SEUJL4,"I've always enjoyed the actor Aiden Gillen. Wake Wood is a story based on a very old Celtic belief regarding death & by the use of magick, allows one's family to say goodbye, especially if their loved one died too quickly. Of course there are a few magickal catches such as another death needs to open the doorway, only 3 days can the departed remain & then the family is 'tied to the land' as it were. There are a few unanswered scenes which could have been easily rectified & explained with a little more effort. Still, all in all an interesting supernatural film.",1525132800,,566,4.451923076923077
8439668,4,B004SEUJL4,"I am the BIGGEST horror fan, and I absolutely LOVED it!! Aside from the obvious, the emotion and intentions are heartbreakingly realistic for I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did, but it kept me hooked without break the whole way through, and the actors did a great job with their characters! One of my one or two star ratings pet peeves are horror films that ignore GIANT plot holes to ""get away with"" some bizarre, or unlikely ending, but even with a few barely noticeable little plot holes (and maybe even a quite larger one at the end), it was still entertaining enough for forgiveness. I highly recommend it!",1516320000,,620,4.495575221238938
8439669,1,B004SEUJL4,"....I don't even... Nope. Great animal deaths, lots of awesome gore... But nope, this is a terrible movie. And I'm a horror fanatic. Just no no no.",1510617600,,147,4.481481481481482
8439670,2,B004SEUJL4,"This was a stupid low-budget movie. It started off good, but then with ""day 3"" it got corny really fast. I would have gave it 1 star but I was happy to see Little Finger from Game of Thrones, but the writing and directing sucked so bad that even Little Finger couldn't save. And what was with the ridiculous dialogue. It was like the characters couldn't form a sentence let alone a paragraph. The dialogue was horrendous.",1508112000,,421,4.48051948051948

It was suspenseful and kept my attention till the end. I liked the twist in the end.",1506643200,,127,3.923076923076923

8439674,4,B004SEUJL4,"Great acting, nice cinematography. The story line was unpredictable - I thought it was more of a sad story, and it kind of was, but the ending was a complete surprise. Yes, there is gore, but it adds to the whole story line of the creepiness of the entire thing, and unlike a lot of bad cheesy horror flicks, this one was actually great!",1505779200,,337,4.28125
