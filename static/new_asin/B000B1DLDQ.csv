2399049,5,B000B1DLDQ,"I spent many years at NBC where The Dean Martin Show was taped, and became accustomed to his variety show format. I don't think I ever missed a taping day during the nine years it was in production.

The mood of the country had been changing since the Vietnam War. Shows like ""M*A*S*H*"" and ""All In The Family"" and movies like ""Silkwood"" and ""War Games"" were edgy, jabbing at the establishment and pushing the boundaries of the perception that ""everything is okay."" It was a time for change, and the genius of bantering without becoming political worked well in having known celebrities ridiculing and poking unkindly comments at each other.

It was in the ninth and final year that ""roasting"" a celebrity was incorporated as a part of Dean's show (much like the Friar's Club Roasts in New York City). Dean would be the host (roastmaster) with a celebrity guest (roastee) seated at the head of the table. In turn, a dozen or more celebrity guests would get up one at a time and chide or insult the roastee of the week.

After the success of that ninth year trial, the producers took the roasts to Las Vegas where they could get the audiences and excitement they wanted. The stars came out in droves! I mean even the biggest stars... serious actors, comedians, astronauts, sports greats, politicians and singers who could poke fun at others as well as take the ribbing themselves.

When the Celebrity Roast specials ended in 1984, everyone moved on. I have to admit... I did too. Over the many years of creating and presiding over the ""Dean Martin Fan Center,"" my focus had been on Dean's early career and of course his TV Variety series. Now, all these years later. I have revisited these Celebrity Roasts because of Time-Life. Do you know what? I cannot believe how enjoyable these shows are to watch! Your kids can put a face to the people they have only heard of - like Neil Armstrong, Ronald Reagan or Jimmy Stewart, etc... the list is huge - and these discs are a good reminder of how important these celebrities were to society.

With all the changes in the world that have occurred over time, these original roasts stand out like a beacon of light --- a goldmine of entertainment! Some of the jokes and ethnic references were acceptable before we became ""politically correct."" It's a shame we can't laugh at each other today like we once could (and without bad words!). Maybe that's why these are more fun to watch today than when they first aired.  I wish I could describe to you my new found appreciation for the roasts after all these years!

A huge compliment has to also be given the folks who came up with the ""extra bonus material"" included on these discs. Besides fascinating interviews with so many of the stars and people in Dean's life, they have also included some well produced featurettes - they are so entertaining.

I try to be very honest in my reviews. Even though I knew  Dean, I don't want to see a badly produced product and will say so when I see something... but this release from Time-Life succeeds - and how! I welcome you to e-mail me and tell me your thoughts, either through Amazon or by going to The Dean Martin Fan Center website.

Oh... FYI: I am not getting any compensation for this - but if you are only thinking about buying the smaller 6-disc set, maybe consider buying the huge (25 disc) box set collection that Time-Life has with a special collector's book. It's more expensive, but you'll have all the roasts and the booklet to boot!",1379635200,30,3479,4.587761674718196

2399051,5,B000B1DLDQ,"I'm a baby-boomer who loves to laugh and who looks back on the comedy of the sixties and seventies - and the years of the Dean Martin Roasts - with longing. Bob Hope and Johnny Carson and Jack Benny's television appearances were anticipated eagerly. My family  sat in front of the set and were happy even before these gentlemen spoke! These comics were like family members we trusted to be in our living rooms to bring humor and the utter relaxation of whole-body laughter. I genuinely miss them. I am very excited to have pre-ordered The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts Collector's Edition. I am already smiling, anticipating the joy of those iconic comedic personalities, at one head table, each one performing during the show - one party cake alight with a multitude of colorful sparklers!",1379462400,4,789,4.844444444444444
2399052,5,B000B1DLDQ,"A friend of mine who's a huge Dean Martin fan sent me a link to purchase this set - glad I did!

As the last reviewer said, this definitely is a comedy time-capsule.  If you're looking for laughs from ""Master Comedians"" at the top of their game, this is the place to see it.  This isn't humor that relies of the ""F"" word or off-color bathroom references; It's great humor driven by incredibly insightful, hilarious comments that you wouldn't have picked up anywhere else.

Whether it's Cassius Clay being given a hard time for his rhymes, whether it's Howard Cosell being harangued for his hair or Rich Little mocking Johnny Carson's mannerisms you're going to come away from this set knowing why so many people, for so long, enjoyed Dean Martin's Celebrity Roasts as much as they did.  One of the greatest things you pick up is that you quickly begin to really enjoy the unique personalities of each comedian or celebrity.  These comedians pull their material from well known (and some unknown) foibles of the celebrity being roasted to give you a real insight into the comedic community that delivered up these great stars.

Great design of the DVD set holder, info booklet, and box - very nice addition to my video library. Easy to navigate and search for content.

Thanks StarVista!",1379376000,2,1286,4.73542600896861
2399053,5,B000B1DLDQ,"Man, I remember these shows when I was a kid and can't wait to watch them again--Don Rickles, Bob Hope, Jackie Gleason. How can you go wrong?!?
They sure don't make comedy like they used to.  The Comedy Central roasts can be fun, but Dean was the real deal.",1379376000,,257,4.244897959183674
2399054,5,B000B1DLDQ,"I had the priviledge of viewing an advance copy of the ""Collector's Edition"" of the Dean Martin Roasts. I'm still laughing days later. This package includes 12 of the best Roasts from the 1970s and early 1980s, plus several bonus ""featurettes"" that delve onto what made these made-for-TV events so special. First of all, the list of performers reads like a Who's Who of 20th Century comedy stars: Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Jackie Gleason, Lucille Ball, Milton Berle, Johnny Carson, Host Dean Martin, and many other big names from the era. It is all fascinating stuff and there is a keen sense of comedic competition among the big stars. Everyone wants to get the biggest laugh, no one wants to tank out there, so the zingers pile up at a great rate. It's like a professional sport All-Star game. My favorite Roast is of Johnny Carson. Carson had tremendous power in the entertainment industry in this era (a booking on the ""Tonight Show"" was the highest honor for a standup comic) and the comedians making fun of Carson are clearly trying to get a good laugh...while at the same time being careful not to truly offend Johnny. It makes for an edgy and legendary show. Some of the comedy bits are a bit dated and the style of some of the performers is a lot more slick than we see today, but you get to see why these men and women were at the top of the highly-competitive world of comedy. I had forgotten Red Buttons, but he is very funny each time he takes the mike. Rich Little was a young man during these years, but his impressions are simply amazing. Bonus interviews with Betty White, Don Rickles, Rich Little, Jackie Mason, and others add great backstage memories and anecdotes about the Roasts. Highly recommended for those who want to revisit this golden age of television comedy, or younger viewers who want to see these legends in their ""natural environment.""",1378425600,74,1865,4.637462235649547
2399055,5,B000B1DLDQ,"The Dean Martin Roasts are a blast!  My husband and watched the roasts back in the 70s and have been waiting for them to come out on DVD.  Amazing how great these masters of stand-up (Dom DeLuise, Don Rickles, Jackie Mason, etc) are as funny today as they were back in the day. TV back then really was pretty special and this proves it. Ever joke is razor sharp (and often pretty off-color...) Also, the bonus features are great --- lots of inside info about the show, the personalities and behind-the-scenes gossip.

Also included are lots of bonus features, including interviews with Don Rickles, Rich Little, Betty White, Ruth Buzzi, and more.
In fact, the interview with Rich Little explains why some of the stars didn't appear when you think they should have. Supposedly they were just plain bad and were edited out. Originally I thought it might be due to time restrictions, but that doesn't appear to be the case.
If you remember these on TV, buy them now. I got more than one good laugh from them. Definitely worth a watch.

The bit he did for Johnny Carson was so spectacular. He not only got his voice down but most of his gestures. These shows were in the 70's when we were about to lose most of these legends in show business. It is good we got to see them all at one time before they left the earth.,1444262400,3,458,4.275862068965517

2399220,5,B000B1DLDQ,"These DVD's are hilarious.  My favorite roaster is grump old Don Rickles and LaWanda Page who played grumpy old Aunt Esther on Sanford and Son. They are both hilarious and so is Nipsy Russell.  Freaky old Phillis Diller makes a few appearances - sometimes she is funny and sometimes not.  Seeing the old movie, tv and comedy stars that were popular in the 70's when I was in elementary school brings back memories of old rerun tv shows my parents used to watch when I was but a wee lad.  They should have had Carol Burnett as a roaster = she would do all kind of crazy things on her show to get people to laugh and would laugh herself on live tv.  Lucille Ball is on a few of the roasts and is funny also.  You get to see a side of the comedians that you never saw before, like most of them are smoking and drinking and sometimes cussing on the stage at the roast - that is probably why they are all dead now - smoking and drinking got to them.  These are funny to my family, but remember they are from the 70's before uptight political correctness and super hypersensitivity ruled the land like today so most if it would not fly today - but it is funny stuff from that era. Dean Martin looked drunk most of the time.",1421798400,3,1217,4.1752136752136755

2399225,5,B000B1DLDQ,"I finally decided to buy a few of these Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts which I used to love watching. Of course, the old roasts used to have the all-time greats on the dais like: Jack Benny, Bob Hope, John Wayne, Rich Little, Ruth Buzzi, Milton Berle, Don Rickles, Red Buttons, and Phylis Diller.  Of course, my favorite who used to be on the Dean Martin Comedy hour was Foster Brooks. I remember laughing like crazy even though I was very young, and watching Dean Martin laughing so hard that he was always crying when Foster Brooks did his little bit. The other thing about this first set that I watched had skits and sketches from the Dean Martin shows. My main memory of Dean Martin was him at the piano singing and then he did skits and have special guests drop in during his show. There are interviews of some of the people who did the roasts or give insight to the one and only Dean Martin. I think that's more entertaining on many of these DVD's when they have people/stars talk about what happened back in the 60's or 70's.  I bought 2 versions of these roasts and hope they are different from one another.",1421020800,5,1113,4.398058252427185

2399227,1,B000B1DLDQ,"These Celebrity Roasts are ABSOLUTELY dreadful because the guest stars invited to roast the celebrity merely perform generic standup comedy routines. The purpose of a roast is to share personal memories/funny incidents of the person being skewered. These ""Roasts"" are not personalized at all, except for the occasional balding/fat or drunk joke if it applies to the celebrity & it is doubtful that the guest stars have ever had any personal interaction with the celebrity other than perhaps a handshake in the hallway before the taping of the show. After watching several episodes, it all becomes monotonous and very boring. I do not recommend this series",1420502400,,655,5.188679245283019

I did notice that there were roasts that were not the full roast but I didn't care.  There were six disks with mostly two on a disk.

I was really hoping that the roasts for Frank Sinatra and George Burns would be on here but they are not. I could have lived without seeing a roast of Joan Collins. It's funny to see Dino's cigarette smoke floating around the presenters since Dean was sitting next to the podium during all of the roasts. The racial jokes are very uncomfortable and would never happen today, but this collectors edition does come with a warning about that very thing. Ruth Buzzi as the old lady Gladys is always hysterical....I can never get enough of that character. Rich Little is always excellent in his imitations and is one of the best entertainers at these roasts. Overall, an enjoyable set for the price.",1394236800,3,773,4.649635036496351

Robert Mitchum and Gary Cooper as well as a italian speaking indian that is one of the funniest bits I have ever seen and Amazon cut it out!  The roasters are different from the original VHS versions. All in all this is TOTAL RIPOFF!

I remember growing up and my parents watching these shows, and I would sneak out of bed and watch from the top of the stairs, trying not to laugh out loud. While I do cringe at some of the ""jokes"" at the expense of Sammy Davis Jr., we all know that these stars actually were friends in real life.

2399389,3,B000B1DLDQ,"Dean Martin had country-music street cred by virtue of some of his country-flavored recordings. (Who can forget Dino's hit, crossover hit, Houston?)

While Martin's eponymous weekly TV variety show was not known for featuring country-music artists, country stars of the day dominated the Martin show's summer replacement series, Dean Martin Presents Music Country.

As fans await those DVDs, Star Vista Entertainment introduces this series of six DVDs (1080 minutes running time) featuring Dean's weekly variety hour's comedy specials spin-offs.

Best-remembered as the (retitled) Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts, these slightly less-raunchy TV editions of the famed Friar's Club roasts featured faces familiar to Martin's weekly series' audiences.

Whether they were roasters or the ones being skewered, an all-star cast was guaranteed.

Dolly Parton may never have been among those gracing the dais, but Parton knew she had secured multi-platform fame, when, during the course of Martin's Jimmy Stewart roast at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas (original air date May 10, 1978), Dino directed a Dolly Parton joke at Jimmy. Not to be outdone, the comedy of Stewart roasters Foster Brooks and Red Buttons included jokes about Dolly, too!

Three years earlier (original air date April 25, 1975) at the same location, roastmaster Dean Martin compared the ""man of the hour"" Sammy Davis, Jr. to ""Jimmy Dean pork sausage.""

And while the sausage king never got the chance to display his quick wit on these celebrity roasts, Lynn Anderson was somewhat incongruously selected as the token female roaster at the MGM Grand Hotel Kirk Douglas roast (original air date October 12, 1973).

Dean would only say of the ""country-western"" singing star that ""She's so pretty, I'd watch her If she was on the radio."" Anderson's joke? Well, the punch line referenced the size of Douglas' penis.

Comedian Jackie Gayle's tamer reference was to Kirk's costar of a couple of years earlier, Johnny Cash. (Cash's movie career included his starring role, alongside Douglas, in A Gunfight.)

The Douglas disc contains not only the aforementioned roast but also an unrelated profile of Dean Martin suggesting, through footage featuring Martin not only in his familiar tux, white shirt and red pocket square but other attire, why Dino was The King of Cool- Always in Fashion.

While American network TV, during the pre-cable era, seldom ventured beyond the suggestive, Martin's roasts always tested the censors' limits. Perhaps the standards and practices team was AWOL when, during the Bob Hope roast at the NBC studios in Burbank, California (original air date October 31, 1974), Flip Wilson flippantly referred to- well, it wasn't ""Jiggers."" (Viewers, so accustomed to reaction shots of guests-of-honor and roasters laughing their heads off in response to zingers that were seldom as funny as to warrant such displays, were not privy to any facial feedback from fellow celebrity roasters, including, of all people, Billy Graham!)

Speaking (writing?) of reaction shots, while these DVDs are billed as ""complete"" roasts, the Bob Hope celebration appears to have been edited. Else why were sports stars Johnny Bench and Mark Spitz, each of whom joined (fellow) roasters in making an entrance and were seated among them at the head table, not among the featured speakers saluting Hope?

Posthumously-published books and other recollections about Johnny Carson describe a man who those around him were afraid to cross. Glimpses of this are, in retrospect, evident in the roast of the Tonight show emcee at NBC's Burbank studios (original air date: November 2, 1973). Once again, edits don't account for the silence of roasters George Gobel and Cliff Robertson.

Johnny's third (then current) wife, Joanna joined roasters ranging from Betty Davis to Truman Capote in paying tribute to Carson in an event highlighted by Rich Little's impression, not only of Johnny's distinctive voice, but Carson's equally unique mannerisms captured in a montage, courtesy of Little's rapid-fire visuals.

The disc containing the Carson and Hope roasts also contains bonus footage of TV special called Dean's Place (featuring not only Martin's comedy but the sketch humor, if not the music, of special guest Jack Cassidy) as well as a tribute to Legends of the Roast, featuring recent footage of Rich Little and the comedian whose age has rendered him almost unrecognizable to those of us who no longer watch much television and whom he last entertained decades ago: Jack Carter.

Yet another disc contains ""The Dean Martin Comedy Hour"" (as the roast telecast was then known), mockfests of Jack Benny (at NBC-TV's Burbank studio, original air date: February 22, 1974) and Lucille Ball (at Las Vegas' MGM Grand, original air date: February 8, 1975) as well as a ""Featurette"" titled ""The Art of the Roast"" (e.g., post-roast era interviews with Jimmie Walker, Carol Burnett, Tim Conway, Florence Henderson and others)

When Jackie Gleason was roasted at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas (original air date: February 27, 1975) The Great One took a ribbing from his reunited Honeymooners' costars, in addition to insults from some of the familiar roast regulars. Similarly, Don Rickles' roast, at NBC's Burbank studio (original air date: February 8, 1974), was heavy on barbs from Martin roast semi-regulars like Foster Brooks, Joey Bishop and Nipsey Russell, even as it introduced the surprise element: the appearance of astronaut Gene Cernan, who was called on to add to the mirth.

The Michael Landon roast, at Las Vegas' MGM Grand (original air date: December 7, 1984), reunited Landon with his TV dad, Lorne Greene, but the best lines came from Bubba Smith (the pro football star and actor) who supposedly mistook Landon, first for Michael Jackson and then Michael Douglas (""They all look alike to me"") and Norm Crosby. (Reflecting on Jackie Kennedy's remarriage, Crosby asked if Nikita Khrushchev had been assassinated, ""Do you think Aristotle Onassis would have married Mrs. Khrushchev?"")

Joan Collins got a roasting from her Dynasty co-star John Forsythe as well as Dynasty producer Aaron Spelling, along with jibes from familiar Dean Martin roast franchise roasters Angie Dickinson, Phyllis Diller, Milton Berle and several others at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas (original air date: February 23, 1984).

The Collins disc also features a 1976 TV show titled ""Dean Martin's Red Hot Scandals of 1926."" 1

Finally (though decidedly revisited out of chronological order), Martin was himself feted early on at the Las Vegas MGM Grand (original air date: February 27, 1976). On that occasion, political opposites Barry Goldwater and Hubert Humphrey came to together to join Joe Namath and the usual roasters (previously named) in ribbing Dean. Where else would viewers see Ruth Buzzi hitting Goldwater with her purse and getting it on with Joey Bishop, let alone Howard Cosell singing one of Martin's signature songs, That's Amore?

Sadly, most of the roast participants, including its namesake, are no longer with us. The roasts' humor is sometimes thin, often racist and sexist and, by today's standards, forbidden. But these DVDs remain time capsules of 20th century American humor of a certain era which makes for must-see video (at least once) even in the less innocent 21st century.",1382832000,6,7322,5.234842015371477

2399397,5,B000B1DLDQ,"""Dean Martin Celebrity Roast-Collectors Edition"" (6-DVD edition)
(Time-Life, 2013)

I remember as a TV-addicted kid in the early '70s coming across the Dean Martin celebrity roasts and being mystified by the whole spectacle -- the Vegas vibe, Dino's flamboyant drunkenness, the good-natured ribbing, the parade of celebrity guests from the hidden recesses of the adult world, people whose claims to fame were not always readily apparent.  It was sort of like ""Hollywood Squares"" on steroids, a potent but baffling mix of strained jokes, truly outrageous humor and grown-up cultural references that required a lot of catch-up on my part, and often flew over my head.

I imagine that this 21st Century collection of Dino roast shows might have a similar impact on modern viewers: sure, they've probably heard of Bob Hope and Sammy Davis Jr., but the A- B- and C-list celebs brought in to deliver the zingers will give them a lot to wonder about. Some of these guys were old pros -- when Bob Hope, Bob Newhart or Rich Little go up to the podium, you know you're in good hands. Politicians such as Ronald Reagan (then the outgoing California governor...and pretty funny) or Barry Goldwater add a strong sense of history, though some non-entertainers -- such as Neil Armstrong or General Omar Bradley -- prove to be duds as guests. Venerable old-timers such as George Burns (who I always liked) and the perpetually fossilized Jack Benny added another layer, as did the semi-nobodies -- random actors pulled from current TV shows, minor talk show guests, and the like.

This box set collects a dozen of the best Dean Martin roast shows, skewering iconic stars such as Lucille Ball, Johnny Carson, Joan Collins, Kirk Douglas, Jimmy Stewart, Don Rickles and -- of course -- Dino himself.  The selection spans from 1973, when they first tried the format out, to 1984 when they finally pulled the plug. For my money, the earliest episodes are the best, and in many ways the most revealing. The feature debuted at the height of the Watergate scandals, as well as the sunset years of the Vietnam War, and as always Martin's clique was a bastion of conservatism and mainstream cultural values. Still, at this point the tides had turned and while the war was largely off the table, there were a number of jokes about Republicans going to jail, and Ronald Reagan was clearly using the show as part of his planned bid to run for President in '76.

Perhaps more revealing were the sexual and racial politics running under the surface -- this was the stuff that flew over my head when I was a kid, but which is shocking looking back forty years later, as an adult. There were plenty of sexist jokes, some funny, like Phyllis Diller's ""killer"" act and some appalling, like actress Louisa Moritz's dumb blonde routine. What will make some jaws drop, though, are the racist jokes aimed at or delivered by the African-American panelists, who were uniformly expected to play a ""black"" role, making jokes about urban crime or delivering watered-down ""angry black man"" one-liners. Perhaps what's most surprising is the acceptance by performers like Redd Foxx, Flip Wilson and Nipsey Russell of the show biz status quo -- the white guys made the big money and controlled all the venues, so they played the role that was expected of them. During the 1973 Johnny Carson roast, singer Dionne Warwick is clearly taken aback when Martin introduces her by saying that she's become so successful that she now owns a big plantation in the South where she pays ""white people"" to pick ""colored cotton,"" but after a quick double-take, she sucks it up and delivers her bit. Later, though, when Carson zaps Redd Foxx (who was sitting next to her) by saying that ""his people"" invented the idea of roasting human beings, Warwick is flabbergasted and can only stare down at the tabletop, stunned by what she's heard. She's not alone, at least not anymore.

But the weirdness and cultural inaccessibility is part of what makes these shows so fascinating. When I was a kid, it was the booze-soaked vibe of the suit-and-tie swingers that was so alien to me (still is) and now it's the pre-diversity retro-sexist stuff that I find most fascinating.  These programs, with all their peculiarities, are real and genuine documents of their times, and they reveal layer after layer of comedy and show biz history. Plus, there's some funny stuff as well: in the same roast where Carson calls Foxx a cannibal, impressionist Rich Little does a devastating imitation of Carson giving his nightly monologues. That stuff's pure gold! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue movie reviews)",1380067200,6,4616,4.878826530612245
8081266,3,B000B1DLDQ,"Dean Martin Roasts were always a big draw when he was on television, rowdy, raunchy, funny, and all those celebrities!  Dean played the drunk,and he gave an excellent performance.  We do not know if he really was drunk or putting us on. But every time the roasts came on we could count on fun.

In this series of roasts, I realized, no one who was on the program was still alive. It was good to see them, and I particularly liked seeing the women , their dresses, jewels, hair, and makeup. The one episode I particularly enjoyed was the roast for Lucille Ball. Totie Yfields, Vivian Vance, Jack Benny, Henry Fonda, Martin Andy Rowan, Ginger Rogers, Gary Morton and Bob Hope. All funny, not too cutting, but there were good laughs. In one particular segment Kipsy Russell was on, and was coined a not too flattering term. This surprised me, but, of course, those were different times, when racism was readily accepted. This kind of roast did make me wonder if some of the more cutting remarks were taken to heart, I believe some must have been. Celebrities are sensitive and take these kind of moments with difficulty.n. Still it wa# amusing.
