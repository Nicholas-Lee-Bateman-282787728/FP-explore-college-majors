8353745,5,B0026UV7D6,"Both movies are WWII reality based plots and are well done.
Bridge too far is based on Operation Market Garden and the invasion of the allies of the Netherlands in order to shorten the war. This was also the worse defeat of the European theater.
Battle of Brittan is the story of the RAF knocking down Hitlers plan to destroy Britain by air thus derailing his plan to invade....
Both movies are well done. Bridge being the best and was done as a ""big"" production with a world renown cast.
If You're a WWII buff this is the 2 pack for you.",1243900800,,538,4.284313725490196
