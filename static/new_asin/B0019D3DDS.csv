8273537,5,B0019D3DDS,"For MMA fans, Pride Fighting Championships showcased some of the greatest martial artists from around the world.  Because the cards were held in Japan, the rules were a little different and more liberal from those in the United States.  For instance, it is legal to kick or stomp a downed opponent in Pride.

Pride fights take place in a standard size boxing or wrestling ring instead of a cage, which changes the dynamics and strategy of the fights.

The Bushido series began as a way to increase the action of the fights and introduced new rules for the fighters to keep the action fast and furious.

This series introduced to the world such MMA legends as Fedor Vladimirovich Emelianenko, who was pound for pound the most dangerous fighter in the world.

MMA fans will not be disappointed with any of the Bushido titles.",1279929600,,823,4.72027972027972
8273538,4,B0019D3DDS,"Pride Bushido 13 is the conclusion to the Survival 2006 Welterweight Tournament. This Bushido event also features the rematch between Marcus Aureliio and Takanori Gomi for the Lightweight Championship. Aside from the main program, this DVD also contains various specials. The first is an Event Preview hosted by Mauro Ranallo and Frank Trigg where they recap the first two rounds of the Survival Tourney. The segment runs about 13 mins.

The next is a Pre-Fight interview done in an unusual black & white fuzzy-picture manner. The camera angle is odd and the interview seems to take place in some type of interrogation room. The segment runs over 5 minutes and fighters interviewed include Dennis Kang, Murilo Bustamante, David Bielkheden, Joe Pearson, and Marcus Aurelio. There's also a Post-Fight interview which runs over 5 minutes. Fighters interviewed include David Bielkheden, Clay French, Joe Pearson, and a banged-up Dennis Kang.

There are also 3 bonus fights which does not have English commentary. These are Murilo Busamante vs Yoon Dong Sik, Hector Lombard vs Gegard Mousasi, and Ikuhisa ""The Punk"" Minowa vs Mike ""Bart Gunn"" Barton. Minowa looks like a child next to the former WWF star who KO'd Dr. Death Steve Williams in a Brawl For All match(who was then KO'd in seconds by Butterbean in a Wrestlemania shoot match). One of the finalist does not appear for his match. The announcers claimed an injury. Final Bushido event ever.",1252540800,,1444,5.0886075949367084
