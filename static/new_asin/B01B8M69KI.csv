8749659,4,B01B8M69KI,"Argento, late 60's Hammer, and even some Jess Franco influences are readily apparent here, the director does a great job with a limited budget, pacing may be too slow for some but the concept and story are solid and an effective atmosphere is created and maintained throughout, cinematography and incidental music are both very well done, recommended if you are looking for some off the beaten path euro-horror with real atmosphere, not a gore-laden incoherent mess typical of this time period",1476316800,,493,5.098765432098766
8749660,4,B01B8M69KI,"The lead of this movie clearly wants to be Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting and he likes to practice knife throwing blind folded. Can't be boring right? It's not thankfully despite being done in such a way that it threatens to be. I mean that in the sense the movie slow paced and more importantly it's not a huge crazy gore fest. I'd compare it more to a Greek version of a Hammer film. It's a compliment. It's sort of a more successful version of Dracula 1972 A.D. but without the awesome special effect of Caroline Munro's plunging neck line. It's a give and take situation.

Mondo did a great job on the DVD and even more importantly it's affordable on it's price point. One of the most dependable brands out there.",1461542400,4,717,4.473282442748092
