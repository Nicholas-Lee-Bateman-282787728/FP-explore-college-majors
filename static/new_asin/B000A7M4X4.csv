2378171,4,B000A7M4X4,"Niche market mfrs. such as AFA ENTERTAINMENT offer no commentary, deleted scenes, subtitles or other bonus features. Dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair.

In the excellent late-era noir PLEASE MURDER ME, the lawyer of a woman on trial for homicide gets his client off then learns she actually did commit the crime. With her legally shielded from double jeopardy, the guilt-ridden attorney creatively entraps this conniving murderess, but at a severe personal cost. Burr in his Perry Mason period is just great, as is Lansbury's villain.

This youthful effort by Lansbury and Burr is nonsensically labeled ""2008"" on the posted information, but why?

2378194,5,B000A7M4X4,"EXCELLENT film which unfortunately suffers from really poor transfer.  I intended to purchase the DVD, but the reviews of the transfer were so poor I changed my mind and decided to watch it for free with my Amazon Prime membership.  I struggled to make it through at first, but what I DID see spurred me to continue trying.  Despite my large screen HD TV and a superior sound system, viewing proved difficult and unfulfilling.  Instead I ultimately opted to watch this movie on youtube via one of several free videos.  The smaller screen and a likewise fine set of speakers with my desk top computer, made viewing ever so much improved from the Amazon streaming.  Thus I was able to completely enjoy a very entertaining movie that deserves being seen.

Raymond Burr, whom we loved as 'Perry Mason', and Angela Lansbury, whom most of us know best from 'Murder She Wrote', were absolutely perfect in their roles in this tension-filled film noir from 1956.  Watch too for an appearance by Denver Pyle, an actor who appeared in countless westerns through the decades, as well as several episodes of 'Perry Mason', and is revered as Uncle Jessie in 'The Dukes of Hazard.

'Please Murder Me' contains trial scenes were Burr looks right at home and a love affair where Ms. Lansbury, aside from her excellent acting skills, appears quite different from her characterization of either Jessica Fletcher or the evil mother in the original 'Manchurian Candidate'.  The well-crafted film has twists, turns, and enough suspense to keep you completely engrossed once you settle in.  Based on the way films are written and directed today, with very few and minor changes it is easy believe Please Murder Me would be very well accepted in theaters today as a modern film now 60 years later.  Worth deciding which viewing method is best for you and treating yourself to this excellent movie.",1464912000,,1873,4.855345911949685

2378200,4,B000A7M4X4,"Genre: Film Noir of 1950's

Pros:
-Great Idea classic 50's film Noir
-Acted well (get Raymond Burr and Angela Landsbury)
-Burr as a defense lawyer...sound familiar?
-Nice and Dark, but not twisted

Cons:
-Final statements with new evidence?

There was a lot of good going for this movie: The idea, the cast, the acting: However, the reason it have four stars is for the Final statement that gave new evidence, plus the evidence would make a clear Mistrial.  The Mistrial aspect may be the reason for the equal distribution of ratings.  Some might see this as a huge failing that ruined the movie.  I liked the rest of the movie so much that I was willing to subtract one star and move on.  If you love Noir, this is worth it.",1461024000,,725,4.488549618320611

the set and one of the best film noir murder mysteries with twist and turns til the end. Raymond Burr mostly know from Perry Mason plays an
attorney here who's double crossed by a client who he falls in love with and refuses to let her get away with it. That is all I will say in case you
decide to get this movie. The quality on the set is pretty good like watching ME TV or a VHS. As a big fan of film noir mysteries and horror
from 30's thru 70's this is one good movie. And Angela Lansbury as the evil woman is amazing since she always plays good characters.",1455235200,,706,3.9097222222222223

I was delighted to find that not only was this little thriller elegantly done, but it featured Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) and the always wonderful Angela Lansbury. Burr did not play the Mason character; but he was an attorney

Another nice aspect you don't see in modern films/TV is that most of the characters have high moral codes. Even the killer was neat and concise in the act. ;) Overall, this is a fun little suspense movie.

2378228,5,B000A7M4X4,"Reading reviews of this movie captured my interest in seeing Raymond Burr playing Craig Carlson, a lawyer who falls in love with Angela Lansbury's character. After she is accused of murdering her husband, Carlson defends her.  Filmed in 1956, some say Burr's fine lawyering style was instrumental in his being chosen for the part of the forthcoming Perry Mason series.

There are countless twists and turns in the story. One early big one is not really a spoiler because the title of the film gives it away. This attorney's client, unlike those of Perry Mason, actually did commit the crime, and when he learns this after her acquittal, he arranges for her to murder him so she will be caught and convicted of his death. Why Burr's character is so willing to die is eloquently explained. The moral fiber of the film is extremely high.

The reason I bought this particular brand of dvd is because it prominently says digitally remastered. Reviews of the quality of the film's audio and video on other dvd reproductions were generally dismal. As the first Amazon reviewer of this dvd produced by Filmrise let me say that the quality does vary, especially in the beginning. It becomes much better as the film progresses. Coincidently, the story itself grows more interesting as it progresses.

2378244,2,B000A7M4X4,"Burr was not right for this role.  Angela Lansbury has never been as great an actress as most critics claim her to be.  She's good, and I was able to suspend disbelief that she was not just using Burr to get her off.

The two of them together though in this pic was oil/water, the plot preposterous and Burr, being gay, could never pull off leading man with status with any female.

Not sure what version others were viewing; however, do not, I repeat, do not overlook viewing this Raymond Burr/Angela Lansbury murder mystery classic. The storyline is unlike any other involving a ""Black Widow"", and her three love struck pursuer's.",1384387200,,353,5.555555555555555
2378247,3,B000A7M4X4,"Please Murder Me!, 1956 film

This movie starred Angela Lansbury as beautiful and talented Myra Leeds who is accused of murdering her rich husband Joe (played by Dick Foran). Raymond Burr is trial lawyer Craig Carlson who defends her in court. But what if justice was derailed? Lamont Johnson plays Carl Holt. This story tells how Craig Carlson and Joe Leeds were friends since Iwo Jima. Joe married Myra, an art student, after a short courtship. But Myra became friendly with Craig. Can a good lawyer get her off from a murder charge due to reasonable doubt? Joe Leeds wrote a letter blaming his death on his faithless wife. Later Craig learns Myra was always in love with fellow student Carl Holt, and is now free to marry him and travel to Europe. Myra is richer as a widow than a divorcee. The flaw in this story is the self-sacrifice of her lawyer. Was it due to being a rejected lover?

Were there differences between defense lawyer Craig Carlson and District Attorney Frank Marlowe in ""A Place in the Sun""? Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" was said to be based on a true crime in 1906 upstate New York. There were other examples from real life where a poor girl becomes unwanted by an ambitious young man. A ""Prince Charming"" can turn into a ""Bluebeard"". Was lawyer Craig Carlson modeled after ""Perry Mason""? [Was it a coincidence that a slimmer Raymond Burr was later selected to play ""Perry Mason"" on the television series?] This story would have made a good episode on ""The Twilight Zone"".",1383782400,,1507,4.683018867924528

2378249,3,B000A7M4X4,"If this film was of a better quality - both visual and audio - I'd want it for my library. It stars Raymond Burr and Angela Lansbury, both very young, yet already accomplished actors. The tinnyness of the sound as well as its tendency to fade out during important (to the story) dialogue is particularly distracting. The story is a good one though which prompted me to watch the whole thing.",1378512000,8,391,4.52112676056338
2378250,3,B000A7M4X4,"Even though it has that ""we studios are suffering, so the best production values we can manage are long TV shows"" mid-1950s look about it, and the script is not too convincing -- a lawyer getting his client off because he tells the jury he loves her??? -- there is dramatic power in any scene where Burr and Lansbury go at it. Take away the romantic naivete and excessive guilt of attorney Craig Carlson and we're not too far from the Perry Mason role Burr would take up about a year later. And Lansbury's cold calculating Myra Leeds looks like a perfect tryout for Ben Shaw's mom in Manchurian Candidate -- even if she'd have to wait 6 years to get that part in a far greater film.",1378425600,,682,4.3359375

Low budget production, and subpar video quality keep this from a higher rating, but for fans of the above stars, and of noir--there's lots to recommend in this tight little movie with a short running time, and an ending that falls firmly amidst the genre's traditions.",1505606400,,361,4.73015873015873

Some issues with the quality but a good noir movie about how easily lives are shattered by a conniving woman playing everyone for what she can get. Its a real stretch to have Lansbury in that role but she carries it off as well as can be expected. Fairly predictable but it moves along quickly and  those who have jumped on the mistrial aspect obviously missed the ending, and the legal definition of mistrial, but watch the movie youll see what I mean..",1505606400,,527,4.5473684210526315

It is not a good digital copy and there are places where it is very fuzzy and I could not hear what was being said. However, most of the movie, if you turn it up higher than usual, can be heard (and seen). It is worth watching even with the bad quality. The story line is good and interesting. Raymond Burr is great in it. The characters are interesting and believable. I will likely watch this again with my husband, who is also a Raymond Burr fan. This is well worth your time to watch. I recommend it to any Raymond Burr fans and/or fans of old movies.",1498521600,2,673,4.145038167938932
