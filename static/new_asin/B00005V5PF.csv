1670810,5,B00005V5PF,This DVD is definitely my favorite of all the Gaither DVD's.  It is filled with emotional (mostly joyful) selections.  It is very inspirational and moving.,1175904000,6,155,5.16
1670811,5,B00005V5PF,"This Christian song DVD is excellent, impressive and great because all the singers are singing and performing enthusiastically and devotionally.

The content of the singing is very good in the context of Jerusalem .

I apreciate the excellent Gospel singers.  I've been deeply touched with it.",1170201600,3,293,5.326086956521739
1670812,5,B00005V5PF,"An amazing and terrific show of music and worship. The scenario, old Jerusalem, is breathtaking, the singers, the songs, the orchestra...wow.",1169078400,3,141,5.761904761904762
1670813,4,B00005V5PF,"I've never been to a concert in my life.  I've never even seen a concert on TV.  That is, until I saw this Jerusalem DVD. It shows an entire Christian concert that took place in the city of Jerusalem itself.  Jerusalem looked like a really neat place, with modern highways and a few old, old buildings.  I'm talking OLD.  The venue for the concert is one of these OLD places.

There's a whole variety of songs featured here.  Some are very powerful and moving, focusing the overwhelming grace of God, and then there are other songs that are just plain fun like, ""Hey Moses, Take Your Shoes Off.""  I think my favorite is, ""Can't Stop Talking About Him,"" which is a song that's more on the fun side.

Most of the songs are original, but there are a few classics like, ""It Is Well With My Soul.""  I really like those.

I am pleased with this Gaither product.  It's really good if you want to see a group of Christians experiencing joy through musical worship.

On a side note, I kept thinking through the whole concert that one of the singers REALLY looked like the stereotypical picture of Jesus, with the beard and long hair and big smile.  His hair was probably much more grey than Jesus's hair was though.",1127001600,14,1206,4.422727272727273
1670814,5,B00005V5PF,"Ok, simply put, this DVD is awesome!

From the opening song, Jerusalem by the Hoppers, all the way to the very end, this DVD is jam-packed with great songs that will keep you singing for hours!

Personal favorites would have to be

Jerusalem - Hoppers

Can't Stop Talking About Him - Brand new song by the Gaither Vocal Band featuring their new singer Marshall Hall (who by the way, is awesome!)

Walking In Jerusalem - Featuring Buddy Greene and the Isaacs (awesome harmony, fun song)

And of course, no Gaither video would be complete if Mark Lowry didn't show up! He sings a hilarious song called Shalom, Ya'll that is both entertaining, and in some ways, very true.

 A must have for any Gaither fan, or a great first-time experience!

Also check out it's sequel, Israel Homecoming",1122681600,15,785,4.671532846715328
1670815,5,B00005V5PF,"Filmed in the magnificent setting of the Tower of David in David's Citadel Museum, this is a wonderful musical journey, and though the concert is at night, with the ancient stones lit up behind the singers, we also get to see this incredible place in the daylight. Bill and Gloria Gaither and their musical friends take us not only to Jerusalem, but also to some much loved vistas around Israel, and sing one song, ""Peace, be Still,"" aboard a boat on the Sea of Galilee.
The song selections are in a variety of styles, and two of my favorites have their roots in Hebraic melodies, ""The Mighty One of Israel,"" and ""He is Jehovah.""
If you appreciate Bill and Gloria Gaither's friendly manner and joyous concerts, you will find much to like in this DVD.
Total running time is 100 minutes.

The DVD Extras include 3 bonus songs: The beautiful Israeli song ""Jerusalem of Gold,"" sung partly in Hebrew by Larry Ford, ""Day Three"" by Lordsong, and ""Lead Me to the Rock"" by Stephen Hill.
There are also interviews with Velma Vester, who tells of the tragic but inspiring history behind the hymn ""It is Well With My Soul,"" Abir Nasee, who owns a gallery of ancient artifacts, and gives us some historical insights, as does Jan Willem Van Der Hooven.

The Gaither Homecoming gang took a trip to the Holy Lands to film two videos.  The group is smaller than the choir on most Gaither videos, which is understandable given the expense and time needed for a trip to Israel.  Still there is plenty of talent to fill two videos.  The highlight of this one is the Hoppers singing their huge hit Jerusalem, and Guy Penrod singing Resurrection.  But, it's all good.  It is filmed at an ancient ruin called David's Citadel, which existed in Jesus time.  It's a dramatic backdrop for the concert.  If you cannot buy all the Gaither videos, IMO this would one is one of the better ones.",1467158400,,1515,4.588888888888889
1670847,5,B00005V5PF,"My favorite Gaither video! The music and songs are so inspiring and several have a very Jewish flavor including some Hebrew!

1670909,3,B00005V5PF,"I am a huge fan of the Gaither Vocal Band and the Homecoming Friends Music. Over the years I have built up a reasonably good DVD collection of the Gaither Homecoming series. The content is always wonderful , firstly because it is Christian Faith based, secondly it is High praise of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and Thirdly because of the great talent that God has blessed each of the vocalists with. This DVD is no different in terms of content. But the quality of the Video is not to par with the rest, particularly when watching on bigger HDTV screens. It would be good if they would come out with an improved DVD version or better still a Blu-Ray Disc. Shalom",1407369600,,668,4.439024390243903

1670934,4,B00005V5PF,"I enjoy getting to view DVDs filmed in other countries -or even in states other than my own.  This being in Jerusalem is especially nice. The music and sound are good. The songs are not all favorites of mine, but it is interesting to have something different. Even so, I would prefer being able to easily read the song list on the back of the DVD, and this one is difficult to decipher.

The Booth Brothers were particularly enjoyable. I feel like getting up and ""rolling"" with them in, The River Keeps a Rollin.' What a fun song!

If you like the Gaither bunch, you will probably want to have this DVD, and the other half as well; that is to say, ""ISRAEL"" is the other half from their visit to the Holy Land. I usually buy at least two anyway, because Amazon prices them reasonably, and they do carry most of the Gaither music.

1670945,1,B00005V5PF,I made a mistake and ordered the DVD instead of the CD. Having ordered several other Gaither CDs over the years I just didn't pay attention.  My fault.  I will probably reorder this as a CD.  All the theatrics was just too distracting.,1319068800,,235,4.4186046511627906

1670947,3,B00005V5PF,"I love this DVD of the Gaither's Gospel series of Jerusalem.  I would have liked to hear more songs by Mark Lowry or Guy Penrod and less of Jesse Dixon, but the overall presentation was wonderful music and scenery of the Holy Land.  Praise Jesus!!!",1315958400,2,248,4.488888888888889
1670948,5,B00005V5PF,"Both the ""Jerusalem"" and ""Israel"" Homecoming Concerts were filmed in the renowned historic David's Citadel in Jerusalem. In addition to the awe inspiring music the background photography captured many of the most significant Biblical cites which impacted the life and ministry of Jesus during God's visit to earth in human form.  The Garden of Gethsemane, the Mount of Olives, the Jordan River, the Mount of Beatitudes, Golgotha, and the Garden Tomb are included as well as many other panoramic views, historic as well as modern, of the city of Jerusalem.

Photo shots include narration and interviews that bring to life the reality of many events in the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, the focal point of the worship in all of the Homecoming Videos.

Musical themes of this concert include songs having a familiar Jewish beat with dancers in the background.  This added another dimension and a sense of cultural authenticity to the concert. Among my favorites musical numbers are: ""I Have Returned"" featuring Sue Dodge, ""Hallelujah"" featuring the Isaacs, ""I've Just Seen Jesus"" featuring a piano arrangement by Anthony Burger, ""The Holy City"" featuring Larry Ford, and ""This Could Be the Dawning of That Day"" featuring Ernie Haase and Signature Sound.

The numbers featuring the entire ""Homecoming Friends"" cast were especially meaningful in this outstanding program. Other individuals and groups featured include: Joy Gardner, Larnelle Harris, Mark Lowry, Jesse Dixon, Allyson Durham Speer, Lillie Knauls and many others.

An unforgettable experience of worship and inspiration.",1314230400,6,1614,5.410358565737051
