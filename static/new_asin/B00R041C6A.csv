8693558,4,B00R041C6A,"I bought this only for the film Nylon Noose.  The film is an early 60's West German-made, English-dubbed Edgar Wallace type mystery.  A bunch of businessmen and businesswomen are gathered at an old mansion and start getting offed one-by-one by a mysterious assailant with the titular nylon noose.  The exterior of the castle is great and the interior set are good and it even has some sort of dungeon with a lurking hulking disfigured Tor Johnson-type character.  Not bad and typical with a good jazzy theme.  The quality of the DVD is extremely good with a fine transfer.  Recommended for fans of the Edgar Wallace-type mysteries.",1439683200,6,631,4.90566037735849
