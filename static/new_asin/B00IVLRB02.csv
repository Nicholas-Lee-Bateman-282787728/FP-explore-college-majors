6300366,5,B00IVLRB02,"My niece has adored Peg + Cat since before she could walk!  Now she's almost 2 and it still hasn't gotten old.  This DVD is really great -- it includes about 3 Peg + Cat episodes, within each episode there are essentially two stories.  The colors are vibrant and looks even better than when we watch it on TV.  The DVD also includes bonus materials that you can access using your computer to print coloring pages and crafts.  Peg + Cat is a great show too, I'm not normally a cartoon lover and kids shows can be annoying, but this one is entertaining, educational, and hilarious!",1417737600,3,579,4.4245283018867925

6300372,5,B00IVLRB02,"I'm not sure if if it is the Peanuts-style art, the catchy songs, or the dinosaur who only says ""horn"" (he can say other things, but ""horn"" usually does the trick) that I love the best.  Maybe it's the amp that goes to eleven.  Or the joke about ""chairs from Sweden"" in the song about diagrams.  It's the Monty Pythonesque galloping of Peg the Bold and Brave Sir Cat.  Yup, that's my favorite, except for the songs, and the grumpy parrot, and Cat's dream of being a dancer...

Anyway, the Amazon description is lacking the DVD details.  Here's what you get: (Copied from the PBS website because I'm too lazy to type.)

DVD CONTENTS:

The Chicken Problem- Peg and Cat have to get 100 chickens back in the coop before the farmer sees.

The Space Creature Problem- Peg, Cat and Richard must get the 100 chickens away from Big Mouth and back to their spaceship.

The Messy Room Problem- Peg and Cat sort through the mess in Peg's room just in time for company to come over and see Cat's masterpiece, ""The Circles.""

The Golden Pyramid Problem- Peg the Bold and Brave Sir Cat, Knights of the Round Table, search far and wide to retrieve the Mermaid's golden pyramids.

The Three Bears Problem- Peg and Cat bring the Three Bears, the Three Little Pigs, and the Three Billy Goats Gruff together to form a super group: ""The Electric Eleven.""

The Giant Problem- Peg and Cat must attempt a great escape when they think the Giants want to eat them and their 8 fairy tale friends for lunch.

The Dinosaur Problem- When Peg and Cat get lost riding dinosaurs through a prehistoric forest, they use a diagram to find their way to safety before the Baby T-Rex catches up to them.

The Beethoven Problem- When Peg and Cat are helping their pal Ludwig Van Beethoven write a symphony, Cat laughs in a certain pattern that gives Beethoven a great idea.

6300373,5,B00IVLRB02,"This is an amazing gem of a show we discovered not long ago. Not only does it teach math and problem-solving concepts, but it makes me laugh. Given that many kids' shows are annoying to adults, this is a big bonus. My two-year old loves it, and she will still learn new concepts for several years to come. There are many cute Easter eggs, such as mathematical formulas and symbols in the backdrop and one-liner jokes for adults. As a musician, the Beethoven episode is my favorite.",1428537600,,481,4.540229885057471
