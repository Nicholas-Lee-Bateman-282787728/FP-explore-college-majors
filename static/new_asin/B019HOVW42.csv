8745242,5,B019HOVW42,"Dennis Morgan and Jack Carson are two of my favorite song-and-dance men, so putting them together in a breezy comedy is sure to be a hit in our house.  It always struck me as funny that Morgan, one of the great all-American types, so often portrayed foreigners, but who cares?",1514851200,,276,4.52
8745243,4,B019HOVW42,"I have written before that I am a great fan of Joan Leslie's.  In this movie she teams up with Jack Carson and Dennis Morgan (two other actors I like very much) and I looked forward to receiving it.  The story is a bit far-fetched and although the characters all play their parts well including Janis Paige, the overall movie I would rate as a bit of fluff.  Hollywood gave us some wonderful productions from the 30's and 40's but this is one of their mediocre ones.  Had the story been better I would have given it 4 1/2 stars.  If you want to see these actors in a better movie look no further than Hollywood Canteen (my all-time favorite movie) which shows them at their best.  Kudos to Janis Paige also, I wished that they could have developed her part more, I thought that she was great in Hollywood Canteen.",1483660800,,813,4.3509933774834435
