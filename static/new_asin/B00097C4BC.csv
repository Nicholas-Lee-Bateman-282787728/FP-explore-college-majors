2270788,5,B00097C4BC,"Carrie Konyha's Tribaret is a delight to learn from, as you find yourself slowly but surely learning and doing steps you thought were beyond you; this is because Carrie's method is measured and methodical, but never boring, and you learn the basics accurately, and shimmy by shimmy, isolation by isolation,  move to a more advanced grade. The mood is enhanced by the fabulous sections interspersed throughout showing how what you are learning is incorporated into a choreographed dance for performance.

Viewing is made even easier by the aesthetic pleasure of watching Carrie, who is stunningly gorgeous, with sensuality and grace down to her little finger. From the warm-up to the cool-down, her personality and beauty make learning easier, and her teaching methods make sure you learn the right way from the start. The DVD is topped off with a fantastic performance in a knock-out red costume.

The music on a teaching DVD is always important, and here you've got excellent music. Naked Rhythm, Mosano, Gizira Band, Louie, Knossos, and Petrol Bomb Samosa all add to the mix of good listening. Good clear photography, so that you don't miss a single move completes this DVD and makes it a great addition to your dance instruction library. Superb for beginners, and anyone more advanced who wants to brush up the rough edges, and refine their technique.",1320537600,11,1354,5.035714285714286
2270789,5,B00097C4BC,"She is such an amazing teacher, she has the best moves to show, and really goes through the moves in detail so it's easier to learn them.",1320364800,5,137,4.111111111111111
2270810,5,B00097C4BC,Good techniques and tips for varying learning levels. Lower levels than advanced will benefit the most from the techniques and combinations practiced in these lessons.,1369267200,,167,5.72
2270811,5,B00097C4BC,"This is a great video!  I have been belly dancing for years, not professionally, but because I love it!  This video has familiar moves  with challenging combinations that I haven't seen before.  It's what I was looking for: advancement and challenge.  I particularly like that tribal is incorporated with the ""cabaret"" style--I have been practicing the tribal for the past few years, but felt like going back to traditional Middle Eastern Dance--with a twist.  This is it!",1359849600,,472,5.064935064935065
2270812,5,B00097C4BC,"A great learning tool for beginners as well as the more experienced.  I have not even watched it in it's entirety yet, but so far I am very impressed by the clear easy to follow instructions.  Starting out with basic isolations, & moving on to more complicated combinations this video would be suitable for almost everyone who wants to improve their belly dancing skills.  A lovely dancer to watch & I'm sure a lovely person as well.",1358726400,,433,4.597402597402597
2270813,5,B00097C4BC,"Im a novice, never belly danced before this dvd. Carrie makes it easy to follow each section. I started by warm ups & then watched each basic instruction section over a few times until I felt comfortable. Im able to go through dance sections now and getting better with each practice! Thank you Carrie you make learning belly dance fun & exciting. I love watching you dance!",1340323200,2,374,4.597014925373134
2270814,5,B00097C4BC,"Tribaret is packed with cute bellydance moves that are a great addition for anyone who likes learning bellydance. This is not a workout DVD, but a DVD geared to teach you bellydance moves and combinations. It's more like a library of versatile moves.

I would not classify this as something for beginners, since Carrie covers the moves quite quickly and does not drill them repeatedly with instruction, but goes directly to demonstration. But if you are a beginner, get this anyway because sooner or later you're going to want to learn these moves.

I'm glad I decided to get this. I was hesitant at first because I prefer traditional bellydance to tribal, but after previewing this I decided it had folkloric influence. Folkloric is my favorite kind of dance, especially with any hops, skipping, and bouncing. I was not disappointed, because Carrie included quite a few folkloric moves that I can't wait to learn.

This is definitely a 5-star product. You can tell that Carrie is a qualified instructor, not just a bellydancer who decided to put out a DVD. Her instruction is professional and straight forward. My only real complaint is the cameraman often would switch to a side view of what Carrie was doing and this was not at all helpful to someone who was trying to learn the combination of moves for the first time. I really wish these videographers would realize that filming instructional dance DVDs is different from filming other genres and the most important thing is to get a clear, consistent, and complete view of what the instructor is doing. Still, other than the side views, the cameraman did a good job of keeping all of Carrie in view, so you could see everything she was doing.",1329782400,12,1698,4.78839590443686
2270815,5,B00097C4BC,"I really enjoyed this DVD. It has a lot of great instruction and combinations for Tribal & Cabaret (Tribaret) bellydance.

The DVD is sectioned into basic Bellydance isolations (the foundation of bellydance.), Oriental Flow and Tribal movements, shimmies & combinations.

The Isolation section covers pretty much all the isolations that are the basis of bellydance. Carrie's explanations are very easy to understand and she breaks everything down, but moves through each one pretty quickly. Those who have never had any dance experience might have to go through this section a couple of times to get comfortable. A beginner with some class time or some experience will find it great for working on your technique.

The Oreintal Flow section Carrie teaches bellydance combinations, using layered moves that are based on what was taught in the isolation section. She breaks down the combination but assumes you know how to do the basic movements (Chest circle, reverse undulation, etc.).

A short practice session follows each combination taught. There are no on-screen cues or voice over, it's just follow-along.

The Tribal section covers some of the basic Tribal movement vocabulary- Basic Arabic, Basic Egyptian, Choo Choos, Turkish Basic, Double Hip Bumps, etc. The break-downs are great and it is explained well.

There is a Shimmy section that teaches the egyptian shimmy, 3/4 Shimmies (both up & down), and the bycicle shimmy.

The next sections cover Intermediate & Advanced combinations that combine the Oriental Flow & basic Tribal sections. This is the main material of the video, where you learn a series of Tribaret combinations (10 in each section). There is a practice session after each combination. Again she breaks down the combination & foot work but you need to know how to do the basic movements (omi, maya, 3/4 shimmy, etc.) & be pretty comfortable with them. Because you will be layering them over other movements & taveling steps.

The final section of the DVD is a practice flow with the shimmy combinations. There is no voice-over, just music and follow-along dancing.

Last there is a costumed performance by Carrie, in the beautiful costume she wears on the the cover of the DVD.

Also inculded on this is DVD is a short warm-up & cool-down section.

Overall alot of great material here to get a good understanding of the Tribaret style, and lots of nice combinations you will enjoy incorporating into your dance.
A beginner with some experience will enjoy it and should be able to accomplish the isolation and first few sections. The combination sections will give you a challange, but they are still fun and a great learning tool. This DVD is perfect for the Intermediate stundent.",1328745600,25,2710,5.067415730337078
2270816,5,B00097C4BC,"This has  a good warm-up and 20 minutes of isolations then break down of choreography - breakdown small section then practise it then at the end it is all put together and I can actually do it and I'm a beginner (there is three beginnner choreographies).  The cool down isn't very good its like the warm-up I would prefer to do yoga stretches at the end.  It has intermediate/advanced choreography which is done in the same way as the beginners which I haven't done yet as it's bit too advanced for me yet which is good, something to work towards.  This dvd is good due to the fact that you actually start dancing.  I found the shimmies hard to do,it was broken down and practised slow enough for me, but the drill doing it slowly wasn't long enough for me to actually be able to do it, I was fumbling along trying to do the shimmy - one - two/three, but I'm a beginner so I suppose one day it will just click.  But this is my favourite dvd - she teaches in a really clear, balanced (both sides of the body)way.  I'd really like to buy more of her dvd's but can't seem to find any.",1327881600,5,1081,4.193236714975845
2270817,5,B00097C4BC,I own tons of bellydance dvds and many tend to get boring after a few minutes. i've gone through this dvd many times and I haven't gotten bored yet. The only drawback is the dvd didn't come with her grey costume in my size.,1323820800,7,223,4.090909090909091
2270818,5,B00097C4BC,"The intriguing combining of earthy tribal improvisations and the feminine and graceful cabaret style into Tribaret Belly Dance is enchanting and fulfills the craving that I share for both styles.

 With so many great features to choose from, one of the most important,(for anyone and those who seriously wish to delve into),is the excellent presentation of the program material. The instructor elaborately demonstrates the isolation preparation section and progresses into the technique variations which are divided into 3 segments; Orientale flow, Tribal basics and Shimmies. These begin with basic steps such as the slinky taqsim, basic arabic, mayas; traveling steps such as arabesques, placed into combos which evolve into very delightful practice flows. Vital to tribal style is the 4/4, 3/4 up and downward shimmies, including more breakdowns.

In this open level instruction, completing the above sections is recommended as the Tribaret technique progresses into intermediate and advanced sections with yet fabulous steps and combination sections, (including cues for transitions). These are then set to generous practice segments with lovely music, delightful to dance along.

 Beautiful upon completion, this program merges the percussive and smooth movement,with its advanced steps and combination reviews into wonderful practice flows.

A spell-binding performance by Carrie Konyha finalizes the program.",1323561600,8,1415,5.878048780487805
2270819,5,B00097C4BC,Carrie starts with teaching beginning steps then going to more advanced movements. Each segment has a practice session performed to music. You can easily turn each practice session into your own belly dance performance. Music credits are provided.,1320710400,7,247,5.526315789473684

8058420,5,B00097C4BC,"WHAT MAKES THIS DVD SPECIAL  This is a true ALL-IN-ONE DVD. a) First and most important is the way this DVD was constructed and produced. It is conceived as a DRILL TO DANCE DVD, so each section is a drilling with music section combined into a dance flow. In each segment you will find the following format: explain-drill-dance, except from the isolations segment, which is not danced afterwards. Each bellydance movement is first explained shortly (in workout outfit and without music), then comes a brief drilling clip of the movement with music (same music and dance costume from the full flow). In fact what the production team did, was to cut the complete flow danced by Carrie into smaller chunks and paste each small clip repeated 2-3 times one after the other so you can drill it a couple of times to music (at full speed) just after the explanation of each move. Then the next move is explained and at the end, all the flow is practiced a couple of times in full. b) Secondly, the transition moves and cues are also explained and drilled together with the main move, so you can get dancing as soon as possible. c) Third, this DVD is one of the few true open-level practice programs, since it contains different sections for each level, except for total beginners.

Jan 2017: For the sake of truth I have to say that I am not using this DVD. Don't ask me why, because I like it in theory, but it is not the DVD I pull out for my exercising...In fact I have rarely used it, I have like my favorites, which I use all the time, the ones that I used a lot and then moved to other ones and the ones that I pull out once in a while. This one I use even less tan that, maybe it is too advanced? I will pull it out and try to figure out why...

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Medium TONING: Low CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner to Advanced INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent, but not for total beginners MUSIC: Excellent  FUN FACTOR: Excellent

CONTENTS:
1) WARM-UP: Extremely short, it consists of 4 or so stretching movements, each repeated twice each side.
2) ISOLATIONS:  Here you will drill an extensive variety of basic bellydance isolations with music. Drilling time for each movement is just long enough (other DVDs let you drill each movement longer to really ingrain it in your muscle memory, but with Carrie you cover a lot of different moves and don't get bored). However, you need to know how to perform the moves, since they are not broken down in full detail (some explanations on good form are given during the drills, but they're not enough for an absolute beginner). I consider this a kind of practice review of your bellydance basics, with good tips and hints for alignment and posture (you cant have enough practice of these basics).
3) ORIENTAL FLOW - BEGINNER TO INTERMEDIATE:  This flow is like a beginner choreography, consisting in 6 combinations, each containing 2-4 different bellydance moves. Each bellydance movement is first explained shortly together with the transition move and/or cue that will connect it to the next movement in the short combination, then it is drilled with music for aprox. eight 8-counts (4 on each side). At the end, all the flow is practiced a couple of times.
4) TRIBAL BASICS - BEGINNER TO INTERMEDIATE:  Eight basic tribal (ATS) steps are covered in this section, like Basic Egyptian, Arabic and Turkish, Ancient Egyptian, etc. Each step is first explained shortly together with the transition move and/or cue that will connect it to the next step, then it is drilled with music. At the end, all the steps are put together in a kind of step flow, which is repeated 2 or 3 times.
5) SHIMMIES- INTERMEDIATE TO ADVANCED: This is basically a shimmy drilling section. Four shimmy types are covered: Egyptian shimmy,  upward shimmy,  downward shimmy and bicycle shimmy. Each shimmy is first explained shortly, then drilled to music followed by the next shimmy type. At the end, all of them are put together in a kind of shimmy flow, which is repeated 2 or 3 times.
6) INTERMEDIATE CHOREOGRAPHY: Each step is explained-drilled-danced in the same way as the Oriental Flow. I have rarely seen this amount of detail drilling in a choreography. Other instructors explain the steps and drill the full 8-count combo several times, but Carrie drills each individual move several times, before combining it.
7) ADVANCED CHOREOGRAPHY: I am not here yet, but from a fast forward I could see that its the same format as the intermediate choreo.
8) COOLDOWN: Extremely short, it consists of 4 or so stretching movements, each repeated twice each side, almost the same as the warm-up.
9) PERFORMANCE  Nice choreography in a beautiful costume.

MUSIC:
Very good music that fits perfectly with the various flows and drills

EMPHASIS:
Good overall emphasis, including travel steps. I would say the emphasis is in getting you Tribaret dancing as quickly as possible. Steps and Combos are explained, drilled and danced for each component of the Tribaret stylistic Combo and for the Combo itself (Oriental Cabaret style, Tribal style and Tribaret). It starts with beginner-intermediate level for Oriental and Tribal, so you get your basics right, but moves right into Tribaret intermediate and advanced steps and combos.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ Dance combinations: beautiful dance combinations that are very well thought out, so you can start dancing almost from the beginning
+ FUN: This is probably as fun as drills can get, because you drill while dancing.
+ Production format: Explain-drill-dance for EACH MOVEMENT
+ Special emphasis put on the transition moves and cueing, which really help you get into the dance flow
+ True open level program full of instructional information, drilling time and dancing time in just one DVD.",1430352000,,5766,4.811111111111111

8058422,3,B00097C4BC,"dont quite like the set up... the pace is a little to quick and its difficult to just focus on a couple moves at a time without hitting 'back' all the time which takes you out of the zone.
some of the moves are little more complex than expected. would probably be great for someone that already has some real class experience and looking to change things up and be inspired.",1423958400,,374,4.28169014084507
8058423,5,B00097C4BC,"With all the instructional dvd's out there it's disappointing when you invest in one and it's just the same old hip drop stuff.  Not so with Tribaret.  As an Egyptian Cabaret style dancer I was looking for some different moves to incorporate into my dance repertoire and this dvd delivered.

As stated by other reviewers, the direction is clear (she wears leggings in the instructional sections so you can SEE the foot/legwork) AND she does each movement combo on BOTH sides.  There's a brief instruction of the move, then a short drilling section before moving on.  You can string a few of the combos together, or the whole thing for a longer dance.  Her performance is beautiful and her instructions clear.  This is one of my new favorites.",1390953600,,742,4.75
8058424,5,B00097C4BC,"This is a great DVD for those of us that have been dancing for awhile. You can work on perfecting your skills and put together routines. I really like this DVD and recommend it for those with some or a lot of training in Belly Dance. I think beginners would have some difficulty, though.",1386547200,2,287,4.333333333333333
8058425,4,B00097C4BC,"I'm an experienced Egytian dancer, and recommend this video for intermediate and above dancers who are interested in cross training. There's a lot on this DVD for the price, breakdowns of cabaret, tribal, and shimmies, practice drills, combinations, and performances. I notice that Carrie performs more technically correct during her drills and breakdowns than her performances (doesn't quite do the movements as full/complete), but that shouldn't deter you from getting this.",1381968000,,476,5.71830985915493
8058426,4,B00097C4BC,Nice format for presenting the two styles of dance (tribal and cabaret). Be prepared to play and rewind if any of the dance movements are new to you...only a brief description is provided. The performance piece is also fun to watch.,1374364800,,232,4.682926829268292
8058427,4,B00097C4BC,"Tribaret Belly Dance was very informative.  I learned movements I have seen over the years and was never taught.  Carrie has some nice combinations.  It is a long video and the combinations were built very quickly.  There is something for everyone whether you do regular belly dancing, fusion, Egyptian, Turkish or tribal.  I learned a variety of things and after dancing for 35 years, it gets harder to find new material. While I enjoyed the video, it took a lot of effort to stay focused.  It might be better to watch it in stages.  It is a must have for your collection.",1371427200,2,573,4.5588235294117645
