8498278,5,B006HBU0ME,"Seeing Elvis sing ""God Give Me Strength"" gave the chills and made me cry. If you like Elvis, or wish you could see him up close, this is a great piece. If you're not familiar with this tour, this is the one where fans come up on stage and spin a wheel to determine the song that Elvis will play next. Very cool.",1333497600,8,311,3.9523809523809526
