726136,4,6303921663,"I recently purchased this movie online when I started thinking about all the movies that I had watched as a younger child.

It starts out with a family deciding that they're gonna head west to get some land and build a new home. Along the way several hardships and tragedies occur, resulting in the children eventually being left to fend for themselves as they continue the journey without their parents.

The oldest boy, who was constantly getting whipped and scolded while under his parents care, steps up to the plate and advocates for his right as the new head of the household and guardian to his younger siblings.

It's an older movie, as I've stated, probably not the best picture quality, and is a bit shorter than I remember it being as a kid, but it's entertaining and inspiring. Also amazing to discover that this is based on a true story. Something for the children of today to see and learn to appreciate.",1169078400,25,918,4.619631901840491
726137,4,6303921663,"Although dated (the version we have is the cheap $1 disc and is a horrible video transfer job), and filled with flaws, this film is a family treasure. The acting is not great but the overall story and photography are beautiful. It's about a poor farming family of nine that set out from Missouri, in 1843, to go to Oregon Territory and start a new life.

The perils they have along the way are well portrayed. This is based on a true story. What those children accomplished is nothing short of amazing.

**** 4 Stars...Highly recommended family viewing!",1136764800,39,553,4.63265306122449

726139,1,6303921663,"I absolutely loved this movie when I was my daughter's age and couldn't wait to watch it with her.  You can only imagine our disappointment when we only had 15 minutes of the movie left and the DVD went bad on us.  We totally missed the last few scenes.  It wasn't quite the same for her when I had to tell her what happened.  Overall I give my rememberence of the movie 5 stars, but here in this case can only give 1 star based on the quality of the DVD.",1123200000,3,455,3.967032967032967
726140,1,6303921663,"I'm afraid I can't find anything that's right with this movie.

What's wrong?  Way too much.  Acting that's so bad a grade five class can do better.  People supposedly sick and in pain and yet their faces look like they are having a pleasant conversation at a tea party (get a look at the woman supposedly on her death bed and then the kid opens the tent door). A script that does not hang together.  Gee whiz!  Where did that baby come from?  The mom was skinny as can be only a minute before!  White hats and clothing that stay white and looks straight from the ironing board fresh even though the owners are roughing it traveling by wagon across country. Makeup supposed to look like the child is sick but it's obvious it is makeup painted under their eye.  And they aren't even consistent about how these ""black eyes"" are painted on.  They vary from cut to cut.  The kids are all terribly ill but then the next morning - a miracle!  All the kids have recovered totally from their trial and look as fit and healthy as can be.  Dialogue that sounds like it was written by a person whose mind was on another task.

I could go on and on but this movie insults my intelligence.  It's a shame because it could have been much better.",1121472000,5,1230,4.310043668122271
726141,4,6303921663,"This film is much better than I expected it to be. The story line offers something a little different from the usual fare of ""going west"" films. It has its share of drama and jeopardy, but it's a safe family story, the cinematography is good, and the theme music is well above average. (Pat Boone sings the opening and closing song.) Well worth watching.",1119744000,,354,4.546875

It's great for the whole family.  I like the fact that it taught a bit about the history of our country, yet entertained as well. The children were adorable and did a pretty good job acting in what was most likely their first film.",1109030400,28,387,4.065789473684211

The film does an excellent job of portraying the journey on the trail.  It is very entertaining and kept my students interested.
Unfortunately, the film sugarcoats the reality of the result of the Sager's journey.  Two of the Sager boys were massacred with the Whitmans instead of going on to a homestead in Oregon, as the film implies.  The girls were adopted out.",1051660800,3,544,4.74468085106383

726497,3,6303921663,"Seven Alone is the story of the Sager children, who were orphaned on the Oregon Trail.  And Catherine Sager did indeed break her leg under the wheel of their wagon.  The movie got those parts right, at least.  Aside from that, it's practically pure fiction.  Which is sad, because the true story of the Sager children's journey to Oregon was far more gripping (and tragic) than the story presented here.  I suspect the film was intended as a vehicle for Stuart Peterson, who was a promising young star at the time.

Don't get me wrong... the movie is entertaining, in a saccharine feel-good kind of way.  The children are endearing, the scenery breathtaking at times, and the ending is happy (something the true story never had).  The DVD that I watched was poorly transferred, but I don't know if that's due to the quality of the transfer itself or if the original celluloid has become that degraded.

Three stars is probably generous for this movie, but I'm hoping that people who watch it will be inspired to read and research the Oregon Trail, and the true story of the Sager family.",1479859200,,1087,4.649214659685864

 My mom got this for my siblings and I for Christmas one year. At the time, there were seven children in the family, so my mom thought it would be a movie we could relate to or something...
We watched it on Christmas, and it left us all feeling scared out of our minds. We went to bed that night with nightmares of our parents dying and leaving us to fend for ourselves. Now looking back, its kind of a funny story... I'm tempted to buy this for my family just for laughs.. We destroyed the VHS we hated it so much.",1355443200,,593,4.247787610619469

Anyway, back to the movie...Despite the cover, it isn't an animated cartoon, but rather, Seven Alone is a great family movie and a history lesson all in one. It's an older movie, so the quality isn't what we have grown accustomed to with today's movies, but it's a must-see classic nonetheless. It is based on the true story of the Sager children, who became orphaned and traveled on the Oregon trail to fulfill their father's promise of homesteading there. Katherine, the oldest daughter, kept a diary of their adventure and how they later came to live with the Marcus and Narcissa Whitman missionary family.

There is much to discuss in this movie, including selfishness and disobedience on the part of the oldest child, John Sager. There are some scary parts, so caution is recommended if viewing with small children.

All in all, this movie was just as good as I remembered it years ago. I highly recommend it!

727311,4,6303921663,"The story line is far-fetched, and the acting is by no means great, and neither is the cinematography. It has all the typical faults that old movies have.

That being said, it is a very plain and moving story. I sobbed at the end, as did my mother and sisters (and brother....I think. But he won't admit it...). Maybe it is only moving to large families who do bicker... But basically, it is a tale about a family. And the oldest kid has issues with his dad and mom. And then family members begin to die. And....
  I cried. Alot. BTW the picture on the jacket--of all the kids running joyfully across the field, is an imaginary dream sequence that the boy has when wishing for a reunion of his now-divided-by-death family. But it is really more than a tearjerker. It is, however unartfully, a tale, simply told, that resonates deeply because it is touches a chord that is within all of us. Archetypes. The longing for ""home"" and the hardness---and bitter&sweetness---of life.

Go watch it. At the least, you will not understand. At the most, it will resonate in you themes that have lain dormant and should be awoken (Love Home Longing etc.).

And besides, its an antidote to all the shallow artsy garbage streaming out of hollywood that is all about NUMBING your consciousness rather than STIRRING it, as this movie does.",1208649600,7,1322,4.632478632478633

727313,1,6303921663,"By mistake I bought this movie twice. I first bought it last fall but what with the holidays coming filed it away until lately. There was much artifacting of black spots, and one section a while after the mother's death that has large splotches of green a white. While the latter problem does not continue long, it does seriously disrupt the picture. Since I love the movie, I decided to see if I could try to get a different one. I did not remember the picture from last fall. I noticed the picture of the one from Amazon this time showed Digital Gold Collection and that it showed it had been digitally remastered, etc. This was not the case when it came. It was in the same box as before and the same picture. I also made the mistake of ordering a different one from a third party and received what is called the Digital Gold Collection by Leisure Entertainment. The picture seemed to be no better than the first one. This one was a surprise as it was suppose to be from Brentwood Home Video and 100 min. long. So to make a long story short, if you want the movie save your money and just get the one from Amazon. The third party had a high rating too. The story is good. The acting not the best but you are dealing with a lower budget family film. Even high budget ones can have somewhat wooden acting. It is a heartwarming story about the family coming west in a wagon train with struggles along the way including the death of both parents. I believe I read that someone wrote it is not an accurate depiction but what Hollywood movie is. Enjoy it as an emotional experience of the type of things that could happen. It definitely is one the whole family can watch. Kids are usually not as picky or as jaded as adults in what they accept. I loved watching this type of movie with my kids, and also love watching it with my grandchildren. The VHS tape was a much better quality but I didn't know it at the time and should not have given it away. I was trying to get everything on DVD.",1188172800,2,1986,4.256613756613756

This is a good movie, but it leaves out a lot of details, especially about what happened to the children when the movie ended.

John Sager was the oldest child, and he was only 13 - - but, in those days, you could be thought of as a man at that age - - when both of their parents died, he took on the responsibility of raising his 6 siblings.  The youngest was only 3 months old.

The movie implied a happy ending - - that the children ended up living on land that Kit Carson held for them by the government and that they built a house there - - that was their dream, but that is not what happened.
What really happened was that the children stayed with the Whitmans for about two years - - and then the Whitmans and John and Francis and Luisa were killed by Indians.
The remaining girls - - Catherine, Elizabeth, Matilda, and Henrietta - - lived into old age.",1492300800,2,1010,4.106598984771574
