2354856,4,B000A345CG,"This movie is a great update of the classic, with the added insight of today's world.  It's got humor that appeals to today's kids and voices they're familiar with: the guys who do Spongebob and Patrick!! (Burt Reynolds is great to hear narrating and singing--he's from my era!) This version, finally, holds my kids' attention.  I am relieved to have a good Christmas (Holiday) movie for my kids to watch, without having to overcome some of the dated references. Wholesome, funny, fast-paced.  Well done!

My kids are running around my house quoting the movie--which is the true barometer of a good movie these days.  They've probably burned a laser-hole in the DVD by now!

Highly recommended DVD.",1133049600,2,698,4.923076923076923
2354857,5,B000A345CG,"Legend of Frosty is a warm, endearing movie that is true to the original while being original in its own right.  The story, characters, and animation were on par with my favorite holiday specials, and Burt Reynolds was perfect as the narrator.  More importantly, the toughest critics of all, my kids, loved it more than I did.  It's a great movie to watch with the whole family.",1131321600,6,378,4.611940298507463
2354858,4,B000A345CG,"My family and I enjoyed this movie, especially our 8 year old son.  It portrays Frosty and his magic in the background of a surburban fiefdom.  The voice of Burt Reynolds navigates us into the lives of several children yearning for some magic and fun amoungst the rigidness of societal norms.  By the end we remember the fun of snowball fights, sledding, ice skating and appropriately breaking the rules.  I recommend this movie to young families.",1131235200,7,447,4.842105263157895
2354859,4,B000A345CG,"When I was little my favorite thing about the holidays was the TV specials -- Rudolph, Charlie Brown and Frosty the Snowman.

This new movie is a sweet and funny follow-up to the original Frosty.

""Legend of Frosty"" is great because it's a tribute to the classic holiday stories, but it also has fun with the genre.

Just like the old specials, it's hosted by a celebrity narrator. But instead of Jimmy Durante or Burle Ives, we get Burt Reynolds -- ha!  Perfect choice.

The town of Evergreen is a picture-perfect place. Fans of ""The Iron Giant"" will love the story of a 1950s town that needs to be shaken up by a larger-than-life character.  (Adding to that retro-look, the villain is a dead-ringer for Adelai Stevenson and Sgt. Bilko!)  Frosty challenges the rules and conformity of the adults simply by teaching kids to play.  That might sound corny or over-simple, but it's true.

The plot/characters relate back to the original Frosty.  I don't want to give anything away here, because one of my favorite things about the movie is the way they reveal the story.  It's rare that a family film explores how cycles play out over generations.

One of the nice surprises of ""Legend"" is the relationship between a father and a son.  It's surprisingly touching for a cartoon.  (again, it reminds me of ""The Iron Giant"")

This is definitely a great movie for parents and kids to watch together.  And the voices include actors from Spongebob!

I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because the DVD extras weren't all that exciting.  But don't buy it for the extras - get it for the movie.  Makes an excellent double-feature with the original Frosty.",1130976000,11,1639,4.6678321678321675
2354860,1,B000A345CG,"Yawn! Yet another failed attempt to capitalize on something that was heartfelt, warm, and magical with an unoriginal, hollow, and empty piece of holiday trash.

In this latest escapade Frosty the Snowman has been transformed from the best friend of children to an almost omnipotent being who is the caretaker of winter fun. Since when was Frosty a character of Santa-like abilities?

The plot centers around a town where everything must be perfect and is run by Professor Hinkle's son. Because Hinkle was a lousy magician the son lost all belief in magic and banned it from his perfect world. Then Frosty shows up and brings belief back to the town. Although this is not a bad concept the execution is poorly done. The music is poor, the script is forgettable, and even though the animation is smoother to the original Frosty it lacks the charm of its predecessor.

For those of you who would like to see new material in the vein of real classic holiday entertainment, I suggest you seek out the Jill Chill books or the Koko the Klown Christmas comic book adventure and leave miserable pieces of trash on the store shelves where they belong. After seeing the dreadful preview of the new Peter Cottontail movie that Classic Media has in the works we can only shudder at the results of that misguided effort.

Seek out the originals and avoid this DVD at all cost.",1130630400,5,1362,4.686192468619247

2354888,3,B000A345CG,I was deeply disappointed in this movie.  It seems blurred while watching it & the sound track was fuzzy.  The movie itself wasn't was I had expected so I will donate it to a school nearby for the young children to watch during lunch recess when its too cold to go outside.  This movie didn't seem to coincide with the other Frost movies I have in my movie library.,1420848000,,365,4.260869565217392

The message in this so undermines parents and teachers by painting them in such an awful, restrictive light...over-exaggerating rules so that rules themselves seem bad....that I felt uncomfortable continuing to watch it. It is nothing like the light-hearted original Frosty story. If you're wondering whether to watch it, I'd recommend skipping it.

2354902,2,B000A345CG,"The moral of this story seems to be ""adults are idiots, and the only way to have any fun is to rebel and do what Frosty says."" I think it could have been good if the writing were better, because the idea of Frosty's hat getting locked away by someone jealous was good.  Even the snowball fight at the climax, which should have been fun, lacked any joy or laughter. Not really a contender in the Classic holiday movies category.",1415923200,5,427,4.3375
2354903,2,B000A345CG,"I had high hopes for this movie; the animation was mild, not hyper-overloaded and Burt Reynolds a likable enough narrator, but there is no re-making a classic. Like the other reviews already mentioned this is not a message I want to give my children. The parents in this movie are clueless tyrants, the evil principle breaks out dunce caps and shames the children and I fail to understand why children's movies need love interests. There was no music, no happy message and after 20 minutes we were looking for excuses to turn it off. We ended up buying the original on Netflix and the kids love it; plenty of music and playful animation to entertain them and a positive message about helping others out. The story isn't perfect, don't forget Frosty melts and goes away - so be aware if your children are sensitive but this movie is a classic for a reason.",1415404800,,855,4.594771241830065

2354921,1,B000A345CG,"I had just given our children the Hallmark recordable storybook of Frosty the Snowman when this came in the mail from a relative. We were all overjoyed and popped it in after dinner only to want it to stop. In fact, after 20 minutes we were so frustrated with the cruel and horrible parents and principal as well as the rebellious children that we stopped the movie. I have no intention of letting the children watch this movie again. It is a COMPLETE waste of money! It does not resemble the lovable classic except Frosty LOOKS similar.",1324598400,8,537,4.546391752577319
2354922,1,B000A345CG,"One thing I found amazing is that this was a Christmas Special that never once mentioned Christmas. I mean, how could that possibly get over looked? How could you make a story about Frosty the Snowman, and completely in every way, fail to mention anything about Christmas? There aren't even any Christmas decorations in the town. It's as though everyone in this town has never heard of it. If the cartoon has nothing to do with Christmas, why bother making a Christmas special? Why even put Frosty in there? If they took out Frosty and added a magic clown, the story would have been just the same.

And was the moral of the story, not to listen to your parents, a good one? How about that they're always wrong? The parents in the town are ridiculously strict for no other reason then because . . . they just are. It's like some kind of Jonestown cult where everyone blindly follows a leader, who for reasons never really given, shuns all forms of fun and happiness. Even the flowers are told to stand up straight. When even my five year old is lost and wonders what's with all the rules, it's safe to say the story has lost all point and meaning.

You know, it's the holidays. The Christmas holidays, actually. The kids are home and people are visiting, and everyones homes are decorated and decked out with lights . . . is it really too much to ask to have a cartoon that joins the celebration? Help put you in the mood for Christmas? And if you're not interested in joining the holiday celebration or adding to the mood, then take it off the air and air it in November or late January, and change it from Frosty to a magic clown and be done with it. But for the love of God, leave cherished Christmas icons alone.",1292803200,8,1715,4.389937106918239
2354923,2,B000A345CG,"Frosty the Snowman returns again, this time actually looking somewhat like his classic Rankin/Bass self (unlike in '95's Frosty Returns), to reform a town that has lost its spirit of fun and is run by adults obsessed with following rules of sensible behavior. Particular interest is taken in one little boy who seems to need Frosty the most, this having something to do with Frosty's own origin story, which is completely reinvented here, even though it includes one character modeled to look just like the magician Professor Hinkle of the original classic Christmas special.

Sweetly narrated by one Mister Burt Reynolds and drawing the attention of Frosty fans with its loose return to Frosty's classic character design, 2004's ""The Legend of Frosty the Snowman"" nevertheless manages to disappoint just as much as its more recent predecessor. While the visuals are more appealing than ""Frosty Returns"" (that style works for Schoolhouse Rock and Peanuts, but that's about it), the story itself is even worse. For one thing, parents are just going to love the way it encourages kids to disobey their elders in an even more obnoxious way than Pippi Longstocking ever dreamed. Now, I know the adults in this special are awful (everyone's pretty annoying, really), but sometimes the rebelling is just too poorly played out, like here. The story is too complicated and drawn out as well. It's length is for an hour of television time, around 44 minutes here since there are no commercials, but this story (for lack of a better one) could have been told much better with less complication in half the time. Would people rather have a 44 minute holiday special than a 22 minute one? Sure, if it's good! This is NOT good. It's tolerable only for the holiday special obsessed. It doesn't really have anything to do with Christmas, and it is in no way a canonical sequel to the original. If you want true sequels to the 1969 classic ""Frosty the Snowman"" from Rankin/Bass, stick with the only two true sequels thus far, ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" from 1976 and ""Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July"" from 1979. As for ""The Legend of Frosty"", practically the only positive things I can say about it are that it has a couple of character design tributes (as best I can put it) to the original, and it is hand-drawn animation. Not that CGI holiday specials are a bad thing, but CGI is overused these days. Still, if only filmmakers would realize the things that made the classic holiday specials so great. They weren't loud and obnoxious, they were charming and simple, and full of real magic and holiday warmth and song. Why, the original Frosty was about little more than building a snowman that came to life, and then getting him to the North Pole before he melted! Even the villain didn't do much. Yet, it's a story many of us love to revisit year after year!

Anyway, if you want to give it a shot, the DVD comes with fully finished deleted scenes, plus three Frosty-related games. One is a spin on Simon Says, another is a Build Your Own Snowman game, and the third is a snowball throwing game. I'm not one for DVD games myself, for the most part, as they are usually only good for one or two plays if anything. I am more appreciative of behind the scenes material and bonus programs/cartoons when it comes to DVD extras.",1261008000,11,3318,4.728842832469775
2354924,4,B000A345CG,"My granddaughter and I are on our third viewing of this movie. It's not a half-hour show, like the original 'Frosty'; it is 75 minutes long. This is the first kids cartoon I have laughed with in quite a while. It has a look, similar to the 'Fairly Odd Parents', with the cartoon characters. It has recurring scenes that are related to vegetables. Why? I don't know. But they are the funniest parts. One of the boys, Walter,  and his mother get into a little discussion about ""VECHTABLES"". Yes, that's how they were pronouncing it. That, alone was worth the price of the whole movie. It's a movie that I recommend with a good four stars.",1260403200,,636,4.482758620689655

On top of the terrible messages, the animation is awful as well.  It uses completely flat colors with almost no shading of any kind.
