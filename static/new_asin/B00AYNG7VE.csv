8559295,4,B00AYNG7VE,"My thoughts on this are from the perspective of someone who has watched the first season of ""Transitions"" which sets up this film. I thought it was well put together and that the introduction of a new character and the build to the expected second season well executed. The production values are impressive given its low-budget status and the shots were clearly well planned. I wish the creators well and hope they create more content.",1375920000,,435,4.8133333333333335
8559296,1,B00AYNG7VE,"Be careful, this isn't a full movie. It runs only 30mins

Try the trailer on youtube to see how boring it is. Nothing interesting happens.",1375056000,,138,4.52
