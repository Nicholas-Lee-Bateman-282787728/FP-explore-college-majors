997891,4,6305261423,This movie was one of the first movies brandon lee had made before his death. This movie goes to show his acting talent and I would say it is very well for brandon lee. I especially like the movie for it's cheezy action and how well brandon acts in front of the camera.. I recommend this for every brandon lee fan..,1216252800,,315,4.180327868852459
997892,3,6305261423,"In a way, this is really a very good HK movie, but in many other ways it is just as lacking.  I was actually blown away by how well the story is told.  What I was dissapointed with were the little things like horrible dubbing and lame dialouge at times that got rather annoying.  To top it all off, an almost embarassing cameo from Bolo and really no martial arts action to speak of.  Overall, this is a fine film, it just all depends on what you are expecting to get out of it.

Three main reasons I purchased Legacy was for Brandon Lee, Bolo Yeung, and hopefully to see some amazing martial arts action.  I guess I expected some bad dubbing and cheesiness, and oh yes, there's plenty of that here.  But what really blew me away was the story.  Things start out a little boring, but once the plot gets kicking it is actually quite engaging.  You've got Brandon, who is your every day working guy with a girlfriend, and his best buddy Michael, who unknown to Brandon, is just a dirty drug-dealing guy.  Michael sets up Brandon for the murder of a rival dealer, and Brandon gets 8 years of time.  While in prison, Michael harasses Brandon's girlfriend, who has become pregnant with Brandon's son and is asked to leave the country with an older, yet kind, man who has been infatuated with her.  Eight years later, Brandon is set free, and with help of a friend from prison, gets his revenge on Michael, in what is a bloody gun showdown without any martial arts combat whatsoever.

Despite the dubbing, which the excellent story actually covers up after awhile, Brandon seems to deliver a solid performance.  It kind of reminded me of his capabilities in The Crow.  However, I was hoping for some good kung fu action like in Rapid Fire, but there were only a couple of scenes of quick one two punches and out.  Speaking of which, Bolo appears near the beginning of the film and challenges Brandon to a fight in the street.  Well, its over as fast as they begin and Bolo doesn't land one punch.  Seemed like such a waste for someone as good as Bolo.

To sum it up, you have to go into this film expecting a great story without so much action.  I, on the other hand was hoping for some, and all I got was gun fight action.  If that's your thing, you will love the last 10 minutes, but for kung fun lovers, this is not the film.",1193961600,5,2322,4.341067285382831
997893,3,6305261423,"too depressing. It got me depressed watching Brandon in prison for most of the movie. You have to watch him scrub tiolets and it made me feel sad for Brandon. The gunplay in the movie is so ridiculous that it becomes unbelievable. In some scenes there's five or more guys with machine guns shooting at Brandon and his friend and they can't hit him or his friend from twenty feet away. This is in contrast to his later movies such as 'Rapid Fire' which isn't so insanely done. Only a gun fanatical teenager might enjoy this. For Brandon Lee fans this is well worth having in your action collection, though. Because the movie was made in Asia, the action is way more violent than what I've seen in US films. Although it's very nice to see Brandon bust loose physically when he does. It's just does he have to be in prison for so long? It was a little too sad.

*spoiler alert* don't read below if you haven't seen the movie

another thing that was sad was how he is separated from his girlfrined for 8 long years, she gets beaten when he's in prison, he gets out and then gets a job as a garbage man, and then his girlfriend is dead and his reaction is not even to go over to the body but just jump in an expensive speedboat and take off. The movie was very cold and mean.",1136073600,,1270,4.222222222222222
997894,4,6305261423,"Legacy Of Rage is a wonderful action thriller with great storytelling and character development, emotionally captivating actors and actresses, a cool sountrack, and explosive gun battles and few but very brutal non-stylistic, white-knuckle fight sequences choregraphed and starring Mang Hoi, and featuring the late-great Brandon Lee who showed such wonderful potential for HK (and perhaps US) action hero stardom.

So buy it already!",1131321600,,433,5.873015873015873
997895,5,6305261423,"Legacy of Rage is a good HK action movie with some noteable action scenes and a good score. The movie is clearly dominated by two men.  The well-known director Ronny Yu (Yu Yan Tai) who did a great job with Legacy of Rage, some of the scenes are really visually impressive, and the starring actor Brandon Lee (Li Guo Hao) with his great onscreen presence (at the age of 21). Also, Lee managed to not just be an ""action robot"" in this movie but to also to convey the emotions and the love story of his character (involving gorgeus Regina Kent) in a credible, gripping way.

Just a few words about the action scenes in this movie. Don't expect a martial arts movie because of the main actor's last name. The action scenes consist mainly of shooting, although there are some hand to hand combat scenes. Brandon Lee did all the fighting in the movie himself but of course his fighting skills are nowhere near his father's. Yet, the fighting in Legacy of Rage is decent. Brandon gets to beat up superstar Bolo Yeung (Enter the Dragon, Bloodsport).

Yu and Lee make Legacy of Rage one of HK's best low budget movies of the 80's. If you like such films or one of those two men, you should buy Legacy of Rage. It shouldn't be too expensive.

PS: I suggest a Cantonese version with English subtitles",1121904000,2,1290,4.453389830508475
997896,5,6305261423,"I just happened to stumble across this flick the other day at the local Media Play and speaking as a hardcore Bruce Lee fan and of Brandon's performance in The Crow...I was blown away by Brandon's only Hong Kong movie. The action was there(Brandon stayed true to the Jeet Kune Do method that his dad polished) and while I didn't feel that he was attempting to imitate or emulate his dad...his intensity, mannerisms and even his expressions tend to resemble and honor his dad at times. I strongly recommend LOR for fans of Bruce and Brandon Lee, not just because it's a rare treat(or for the Cantonese soundtrack w/t English subtitles...cool), but because it represents the continuity of the Bruce Lee legacy and gives us more of a glimpse at what may've been(carrying Bruce Lee's torch and coming from under his shadow) had he lived to carry on his father's martial arts/film legacy. A truw, underground martial arts classic by the son of the greatest of all time. Brandon Lee...Rest In Peace,man.",1116892800,9,997,4.8023255813953485

Movie has no plot. It is just another movie that tries to catch attention from small kids. One can even see that all punches and kicks DO NOT EVEN TOUCH AN OPPONENT. The movie is [bad]; there is nothing else to add. If you really want to watch it, because Brandon is playing, RENT IT DON'T BUY IT.",1020902400,6,459,4.2272727272727275

997899,5,6305261423,"I watched Legacy of Rage after I saw Brandon's final film, The Crow, and I was literally blown away. Unlike most dubbed films, Brandon's sheer presence and force of character made the film very watchable--I never had a sense that I was missing a part of his performance (although of course I was) because of the intense physical acting of his character.
For The Crow fans who are already familiar with the intensity of Brandon's performance, this is a rare treat--we have proof now that he didn't just miraculously portray The Crow's Eric Draven, but was capable of portraying the angst, confusion and rage of extreme situations in a believable and caring way very early in his too short career.
It is hard to believe that Brandon was so young when he filmed Legacy of Rage--he carries himself with a poise and confidence that belies his tender years...he is believable as a man who has suffered the unbelievable.
In Legacy of Rage, Lee portrays Brandon Ma, a hardworking Chinese youth, holding down two jobs, and saving his money to wed his beloved. Ma's best friend is Michael, whose father is part of the organized crime syndicate, who is being groomed to take his over the family business. When a Michael sets Brandon up to take the fall for a mob hit, sending him to prison for eight years. Brandon loses his love while in prison, and only later learns of Michael's betrayal. After he is released from prison, Brandon is provoked to revenge to save his beloved and the son he didn't know he had from the power maddened Michael.
The fight and shooting scenes are well balance with thoughtful character development. The final confrontation between  Brandon and Michael is often compared to John Woo style Hollywood action epics, and rightly so...you will rewind it again and again to catch all the action! The initial fight scene between Brandon and the bully is a treat for Bruce Lee fans. Brandon does several ""Brucisms,"" like cracking his knuckles by clenching his fists, and such. This is the only time you will see Brandon emulate his father on film.
If you are a Brandon fan, this is a must see...forget about Laser Mission and Showdown in Little Tokyo...this is Brandon as good as Rapid Fire, with distinct foreshadowings of The Crow. Get it.",974505600,33,2252,4.759590792838875

Brandon wanted this to be about raw violence and action but hong kong couldn't quite make the movie he invisioned he wanted to be known as dramatic actor they gave him violence and drama but in a very basic.

This is, by far, his best film... perhaps I'm a bit biased as I'm a huge fan of Hong Kong action films...
Lee gives an excellent performance... Michael Wong is good as the best-friend turned villian... the action scenes are well done... the scene with Lee & Bolo Yeung of ""Enter The Dragon"" was disappointing & could've been better...

998182,2,6305261423,"I bought this after reading some of the other reviews and I must say I'm a little disappointed. I like Brandon Lee, and I like martial arts movies. But this movie really was more of an 80s action flick than a martial arts movie. The plot line and acting weren't bad for a movie in this genre. Fairly formulaic. And the dubbing is something that you are probably used to if you watch many hong kong movies. But the actual fight scenes tended to be very short, and involved a little too much gun play for what I was hoping was more martial art oriented. Over all I was kinda underwhelmed. If you are just a huge Brandon Lee fan and must own everything he acted in then by all means enjoy.

Both were into one girl, but she fell in love with the working class kid (Brandon Lee).  They were planning to get married, but the rich kid was jealous and decides to frame Brandon for killing an opponent of his father.
