8685129,2,B00OW79CW4,"Michael Coren touches on a lot of the big and ""controversial"" topics about the Catholic Church.  He usually gives great explanations, and in a more relatable and simplistic way for people to understand.  However, after watching, my wife stated that he almost came across as not believing what he spoke, especially when it came time for the Q&A discussion at the end of each presentation.  He would not answer every question directly, and instead seemed to spout off something that he had memorized beforehand... a bit like a politician trying to say what the people want.  We looked him up after watching this, and sure enough, he had left the Catholic Church... again!  I don't know if this guy is following his heart or only his pocketbook, but there are better people to listen to when wanting to learn more about the Church.",1479427200,,828,4.7622377622377625
