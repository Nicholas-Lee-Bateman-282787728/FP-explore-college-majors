8077208,3,B000AAL4OQ,The information was great but it was a bore to watch. He did a much better job on another dvd I have of him but that's ok. I will still purchase his dvd. I try to get better defense but it was hard to locate?,1380153600,,208,3.6444444444444444
8077209,5,B000AAL4OQ,"After three days of training my 10 year old son with the JJ Redick shooting style he asked me why I didn't start training him with this method months ago.  I told him that I spent the time researching the available programs and had just recently decided on this one. I also wanted to wait until he finished the season since there were a lot other areas of his game we were working on.

This dvd breaks shooting down into 10 specific parts. It explains exactly what to do and explains exactly why each step is important.  I wanted to teach my son the absolutely best shooting method and I am convinced that there is no better program out there.  If you are still not convinced then check out some JJ Redick game clips on youtube and his stats.

This is not an easy program. It is for the serious player who desires to become excellent. It takes a huge investment of time to perfect a high percentage three point shot. For the player who has been playing for a while it will be even harder to retrain.  This program makes no claims for easy short term success but does, however, promise excellent long term results with a lot of hard work.",1299715200,,1137,4.339622641509434
8077210,5,B000AAL4OQ,"To learn how to shoot, the student needs to understand 2 things:  #1 Having a good accurate shot with the same mechanics every time.  #2 A compact shot with a quick release and no wasted motion so you can get the shot off in a game situation.  While the video doesn't specifically state this, it covers both areas in great detail, and gives some nice tips and tricks to make it easier to understand and put into muscle memory. There is no way you could watch this video and not have some better ideas on how to shoot, or how to teach shooting.",1225843200,,543,4.252427184466019
