8278844,5,B001AQZ2VU,Sifu Dunn delivers some rare material in this DVD - These flash meditations have been a great boon to me and are of immense help when I don't have a lot of time for practice - His teaching is very straight forward and easy to follow - The exercises themselves involve a breath sequence followed by the movements - I've noticed over the past year I don't get sick as often when I practice regularly and my coordination is oddly sharpened - The Flying Phoenix chi kung system is specialized for cultivating healing energy (as opposed to martial types of energy) - This is an ideal practice for anyone interested in preventing disease in general as well as strengthening the body as a whole.,1315353600,8,688,4.556451612903226
