8532086,4,B008XCT256,"Being a fan of Jean Dujardin I want to see everything he's in.  While French sensibilities appear to allow for much more freedom of expression, I have to say I was enlightened by the stories!  I must admit I enjoyed the middle stories the best - the older man with his teenage lover, and the really REALLY intense posing of the ""question"" - have you ever cheated on me?  I think Jean and his (now-ex) wife Alexandra Lamy act beautifully together and their passion was evident.  Makes it even sadder now that they are divorced in real life.
The bookended stories with ""Greg"" and ""Fred"" were hilarious.  Jean does not disappoint - silly, funny, understated, sexy, heart-pounding at times.  Oh and nice tushy, too, Jean!

Only lacked a star due to not being captioned for the English speaking viewers where the outtakes are concerned.  I know, I need to learn.  I'm trying!",1390435200,,870,4.671052631578948

8532088,5,B008XCT256,"This is actually seven different mini movies in one. The cast assembled is one of France's best between both drama and comedy... the entire cast runs through the movie albeit in different characters. Be warned: keep the kiddies away from this one. The French do NOT have the same attitude towards profanity, nudity and sex as in the U.S. and there's quite a bit of it here.

One of two acts that I found extremely interesting was between real-life partners Jean Dujardin and Alexandra Lamy.. this is, after all, how they met (during un gars, une fille: they were married to other partners at the time). It was a little intense to watch as I think the emotions displayed hit extremely close to home... especially the following morning after their confessions to each other: if you look closely, you can see their eyes actually tearing up repeatedly (the camera lights blur until she blinks in Alexandra's case and Jean starts blinking rapidly as his eyes begin to turn red).

The second (and final act) has me laughing uproariously. Let's just say things take a very interesting turn:-) and also pokes a bit of fun at two of Las Vegas' most famous and beloved entertainers, Siegfried and Roy, and how they (perhaps?) came to end up there. It's a riot to watch.

You'll need a multi-region dvd player to watch it (however it has subtitles in English) unless you can find a region 1 dvd with English subtitles.",1372723200,4,1407,4.6882591093117405
