7882263,4,6305039364,"GREAT CRIMES AND TRIALS OF THE 20TH CENTURY is simply one of the best Documentary Series ever made. Produced between 1992 and 1996, and originally broadcast on BBC2, this fascinating series examines some of the greatest criminal cases in history. Bizarre Deaths, Unsolved Murders, Serial Killers, Legendary Trials, War Criminals, Gangsters, Kidnapping Cases, and more are profiled in these fascinating episodes. Solely making use of archive footage, stills and interviews, GREAT CRIMES AND TRIALS OF THE 20TH CENTURY was produced in an era when ""true crime"" television was dominated by dramatised reconstructions, a genre that became popular in the 1980s. Everything about this series is great: the many different cases covered, the narration, the information given to us, the special ""atmosphere"" created by the music and the voice of the narrator... This is a wonderful series and I highly recommend it to anybody having an interest for True Crime, murder cases and Real life mysteries. Enjoy !

On this VHS you'll find two episodes: Gaston Dominici and the Drummond Murders, & the case of Henry Lee Lucas. Each episode is 26 minutes long.

Episode 1: Gaston Dominici and the Drummond Murders
In 1952, Boots' top chemist, Sir Jack Drummond, his wife, Lady Ann, and daughter, Elizabeth, were murdered in the south of France. Sir Jack and his wife had been shot. Their daughter Elizabeth had been beaten to death with a rifle butt. A 75-year-old farmer named Gaston Dominici was arrested and tried for the murders. To this day the question remains: Was he guilty, and if so what could have been his motivation for murder?

Episode 2: Henry Lee Lucas
Considered to be one of America's most notorious serial killers, Henry Lee Lucas admitted to committing over 350 murders with partner and fellow serial killer Ottis Toole while drifting through multiple states in the American South from 1975 until his arrest in 1983.",1351036800,,1917,5.098726114649682
