1910491,1,B0000C2IVM,"I got so tired of hearing Lilia talk and bored waiting for the yoga to begin I have quit using the DVD.  If she had simply shown how to do the movement, and then quit talking so I could concentrate I would have enjoyed it more.",1186012800,33,227,3.9347826086956523
1910492,5,B0000C2IVM,"I watched Lilias when she first was on TV in the early 70's. It was my first experience of yoga. She was great then, even pretty sexy. This was motivating as I thought then if I did these poses, I'd be more ""hot"" like Lilias. Once I did the yoga though, it wasn't just about being sexy, it was about feeling wonderful.

Now she's created a DVD for people with limited capacity re balance and strength. I would say the average person in their 60's or 70's, who had no yoga experience, would be happy with this. I must add I have only watched the first part-morning yoga. As it was not challenging for me, I haven't watched the rest yet. However, my husband who is 61 and has some coordination and balance problems, and no yoga experience, did the first part with me and really enjoyed it, as did I. Lilias just radiates happiness and you can hardly not enjoy it even if the poses are modified. She makes it really slow and easy and gives hints and clues of how to enjoy it no matter where you're starting from. Just by being there and doing the asanas with you, she shows you how it feels when life is wonderful and how the yoga experience, done often and with concentration, helps you to find that.

She's still the cute looking girl, now aged like all of us, but genuinely in love with life and yoga. If you're feeling down, this experience will lift you up and keep you there for days. Lilias's tenderness, joy, and love cannot be ignored. Thanks, Lilias, from the bottom of my heart. You are the angel of our boomer generation.",1155513600,166,1530,4.346153846153846

1910552,1,B0000C2IVM,"As a senior of 76 years, I found the whole presentation patronizing and infantile. Ms. Lilias addresses her viewers as if they were indeed in their second childhood. Her cute asides during the ""exercises"" are annoying and distracting. It's hard to tell where the exercise begins or finishes.
If you like a to-the-point, well-structured and common-sense routine for an older person, don't bother buying this DVD.

We've all changed a lot in the years since then, including Lilias, but she is still the best Yoga ambassador and teacher I've ever come across. In this DVD, the postures are presented in such a way as to be totally accessible for seniors and those afflicted with Arthritis. Many of the postures are done seated. I've always thought the benefits of Yoga are beyond words, and that continues to be my belief because many of the benefits are mental. It just makes you feel so good that you're doing something that is good for your body AND your spirit. I always feel happy when I've done my Yoga with Lilias. I can't recommend this DVD too highly for those of us who have a few birthdays under our belts from way back when we were doing Yoga with ease in our youth. You can still get the benefits of doing the postures now.",1439942400,8,888,4.260355029585799

1910731,5,B0000C2IVM,"I have too many yoga programs that say they are easy, but I end up not thinking so. This one really is. It helps me get moving, but doesn't stress me. Lilias talks a lot and makes it seem like each move takes forever, but once I begin to learn the program a a little, I can move ahead and keep the CD playing in case I forget something. It's the best yoga program I've come across for my ""senior"" age group.",1354320000,,407,3.975609756097561
1910732,5,B0000C2IVM,"Love, love, this video. I had a significant surgery, was slow to recuperate and had avoided my yoga class. This gentle yoga workout has been perfect for me and I have recommended it to my physical therapist and senior friends. With this product, you can do your yoga at home, in your pajamas, at any time of day or night, and stop to rest if you need to. My pain is considerably less and I am beginning to feel ""normal"" again. Lilias has always been a marvelous teacher!",1353974400,,470,4.3522727272727275
1910733,5,B0000C2IVM,"I bought this dvd as a gift for my mom who is now 65 years old.
The yoga exercises are enough to keep her challenged and fit without being too strenuous on her muscles and joints.
There are 2 regiments, one for the morning and one for the evening.
My mom is retired now so she has the time to workout twice a day. She looks forward to her yoga exercises and has told me that she feels more energetic, relaxed and fit since she started!
The instructor in the dvd speaks clearly and  slow enough for anyone to understand and follow along. She is apparently a pioneer in yoga instruction in the west and seems very confident and knowledgeable!
I recommend this dvd for all seniors who are looking for a way to stay fit! A great buy!

How grateful I am to have this new edition, because of having to soften down my older younger DVDs.  I hope that she softened down this one for seniors because she knew we needed it not because she too needed it.  As one who was so limber, with such loose joints and who was able to amaze with my flexibility to is humbling to discover that I am paying the great price for that youthful indiscretion.  How joyful it is to be able to follow Lillias along on this, my final journey in yoga, and I hope I can keep doing this yoga until I no longer do anything in this world and have moved on to something with less pain and rejuvenated joy.

1910763,4,B0000C2IVM,I got this Yoga Workouts for Seniors because I had knee replacement a few months ago and am still limping around at times.  I thought a senior yoga workout would be good for me and something I could do comfortably.  Turns out I was right.  I can do everything except the floor work but the rest of the workout is just right.  It gives me the stretching and moving that I need but is not too strenuous.  The pace is relaxing and I feel accomplished after doing it.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone that needs an easy sitting and standing yoga workout.  Perfect for anyone having a problem with knees or hips.,1302220800,7,612,4.315789473684211

1910776,4,B0000C2IVM,Lilia is a good teacher and the workout is a little different from other teachers.  She does a fine job explaining and demonstrating the positions. The workout is a little too advanced for myself at this point in time but I can do a lot of the positions just the same. I should think for most seniors this would be easy from the start.  The quality of the tape is lacking in sound at times but overall I would recommend this tape.  The tape arrived as promised in excellent condition.,1296691200,2,484,4.355555555555555

I have only been using the dvd for four days, but feel like I have already increased my flexibility a bit.

Those take up about 40 minutes in each workout. The last 10 minutes are floor exercises, which I cannot do because of my excess weight and my arthritis. But the sitting and standing exercises are easy and fun. They are well worth the purchase of the dvd. And I plan to lose some weight, so maybe I can do the floor exercises in the future.

1910780,1,B0000C2IVM,I have a couple other videos of Lilias and really enjoy them. I was looking for something gentle as I am having some problems with my knees. This video was way way too easy and seems to be for someone who has not exercised much at all. Many of the exercises are to do in a chair with minimal movements. Seems it would be good for someone with very limited mobility but not for someone looking for gentle poses and developing more flexibility.,1282435200,28,442,4.337349397590361

This is a good one for seniors, people with limited movement, or boomers like me who may be feeling a little lazy at times but still in need of a nice stretch session.  My only complaint--I usually plan my yoga DVD sessions by the amount of time I have--and this DVD doesn't show a running time for either AM or PM workout anywhere--not on the case, not on the DVD.

He has been practicing this Lilias Yoga program every day and he says he can do it all with relative ease(and he is certainly not in good physical condition). He tells me that his back pain has diminished substantially since beginning this yoga program. I have always loved Lilias and yoga and I'm amazed that my 78 year old ultra conservative father from Louisiana will actually do this ""crazy thing called yoga"" but he's doing it, he likes it and it is helping him!

I edited this and changed it from 3 stars to 5 stars.  The reason is this is an excellent DVD for those who have limited mobility.  She is personable and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.",1266883200,18,469,3.9468085106382977

1910808,5,B0000C2IVM,"I am not a senior but very inflexible and a yoga novice so I decided to start with this DVD.  Lilias is a joy to watch.  There is a morning session (more energizing) and an evening session (aimed more toward destressing and relaxing).  I think almost anyone would be able to do these stretches and easy yoga moves.
Lilias does tend to talk a lot when explaining the moves, which is very helpful when you are just learning them but not once you are familiar with the DVD and waiting for her to move on.  What would be great is if this DVD had two versions of the session on it - one which went slow with a lot of explanation and another version which just flowed from move to move.
Despite that, I would still highly recommend this DVD.  It will familiarize you with yoga and, when you are ready, you can always move on to a more challenging one.  As for me, I enjoy Lilias' calming and happy personality so much that I have stayed with this one for now.",1223596800,51,953,4.208791208791209
