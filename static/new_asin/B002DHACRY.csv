8365180,5,B002DHACRY,Everything is good. I love this short lived series when I was younger.,1440374400,,70,4.461538461538462
8365181,4,B002DHACRY,"I have loved this cartoon ever since I first saw it back in 1982.  The theme song written and conducted by Johnny Douglas is one of the most beautiful cartoon theme songs ever written, in my opinion.  This particular disc is only the first nine episodes but it is worth the price if you cannot find the complete set on DVD.",1394323200,3,323,4.278688524590164
8365182,5,B002DHACRY,I use to love watching this on tv when I was lil and now I can enjoy it for a while longer.,1352764800,,91,3.1818181818181817
8365183,1,B002DHACRY,"Why are they releasing this when there's already the Complete Series out?

Honestly.",1270425600,14,84,5.461538461538462
8365184,4,B002DHACRY,"Although it is a great animated cartoon that enjoyed when I was a boy, it is also a copy of all the same episodes in the orginal series that are enjoyed as well.",1269129600,,161,3.909090909090909
8365185,1,B002DHACRY,"9 episodes of D&D for $9?  Do yourself a favor and fork over $5 more for the complete 27 episode version... unless your a completist, the picture disc IS different for this release (it contains the title ""The Animated Series, Beginnings"" and has a cool world map, a layout of the land -- Tolkien style).  It does not even remotely compare to the $40 BCI edition with all of the extras; and remastered, espcially in comparison that it's missing the other 18 episodes.  This introduction DVD version, played on my Blu-ray player couldn't even help color-correct this edition; parts would be 'bright' and then all of a sudden wash-out and get dull; at approximately 3 hours and 18 minutes, it felt awfully compressed.  The sound is great; the packaging is ultra strange, a huge clam case that holds... one envelope.",1252540800,32,812,4.7785714285714285
