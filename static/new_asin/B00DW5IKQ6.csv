8598500,5,B00DW5IKQ6,Super interesting. Excellent presentation graphics locations inc. Westminster Abbey & Hampton Court & Windsor Castle. Not just about royal music but the patriotic  music of the eighteenth & 20th Centuries. I wish it had more exerts of my favourite patriotic tunes. The dvd starts with Henry V & ends with the Edwardian era of Elgar & Jerusalem. The photography is outstanding & so is Starkey's storytelling. I play this dvd on multiple watchings.,1530835200,,446,5.109589041095891
8598501,5,B00DW5IKQ6,"This hidden gem is a short but wonderful series. Truly interesting storytelling serves as a setup to showcase some of the most glorious music of England's royal courts and church. Starkey's walk through the subject is informative and entertaining, with beautiful photography of grand architecture and historical paintings and pictures. Highest recommendation for anyone interested in the subject and classical music in general.",1504915200,,427,5.7936507936507935

8598503,5,B00DW5IKQ6,"This was a good as expected, if not more so. The music was marvelous and the history ""lessons"" were quite interesting. The only quibble, if there were to be one, is wishing this were longer, with even more information. I've already encouraged many friends and colleagues to get this.",1421539200,,283,4.795918367346939
8598504,3,B00DW5IKQ6,"Delightful music and often revealing commentary.  But Prof. Starkey repeatedly interrupts the music historians and musicians. From the positions he takes in palaces and cathedrals, he appears to imagine himself as a composer or monarchy.",1396310400,,237,5.771428571428571
8598505,5,B00DW5IKQ6,"I was afraid that it would be over my head as I am far from a music expert but thought I would give it a go as David Starkey explained things so well in his Monarchy series. He did it again! Amazing the whole family was fixated by the series of episodes linking royalty to music with fascinating looks at wonderful churches, chapels and historical artefacts. A DVD to treasure, especially if you like church music.",1395187200,,414,4.4605263157894735
8598506,5,B00DW5IKQ6,"This is one of those rare documentaries that keeps on giving. This is only way to make a documentary: amazing quality of material
(visuals, sounds) a passionate, knowledgeable presenter and thorough research.
If you are interested in British culture-this program covers much more than ""just"" royalty-and happened to like music, you will cherish this DVD.
Whenever I pop in this DVD my house transforms into a palatial concert hall filled  with top notch performers, glorious music, and breathtaking images.
This DVD is truly an ""EVENT""!",1393113600,3,536,5.305882352941176

8598508,5,B00DW5IKQ6,"6 centuries of music shaped by the monarchy are BBC decoded. Discover composers, music, & performance locations of Britain and how they correlate with Kings & Queens. It is a fascinating look at music influence on early politics, war, and architecture. Beautiful views of associated British locations: landscapes, artifacts, interior & exterior architecture.
David Starkey plays an important role in the understandability of this documentary for those of us who are not experts. He makes it enjoyable educational viewing for the commoner who is not completely versed in the monarchy. I experienced his expert narrative qualities in two other documentaries: The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wives-of-Henry-VIII/dp/B00006L91Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wives of Henry VIII</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monarchy-Complete-Collection/dp/B003AND1SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monarchy Complete Collection</a>. Both are recommended.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 4 episodes, each nearly an hour.
1 CROWN AND CHOIR
Henry V, himself a composer, with his choir, traveled for God's favors. Henry VIII's (another King composer) own Protestant reformations threaten beloved music. Son, Edward VI, hacks at music while his Elizabeth comes to the rescue.

2 REVOLUTIONS
17th century changes resulting from conflicts in religion, a driving force for much of Britain's arts. Organ wars, chamber concerts, & Baroque orchestra all find monarchy beginnings. Britain's greatest native composer, Henry Purcell, is biographed.

3 GREAT BRITISH MUSIC
18th century and ""God Save the King"" is triumphant for Britain Music and would become the world's first national anthem. German imports, like Handel, makes Britain's music as dominant as its political power.

4 RE-INVENTIONS
Monarchy respect reigns through Victoria & Albert. The Prince is a composer and both royal heads are singers often doing duets. Renaissance in British music is complete with pomp & pageantry...and coronations.

Constant musical excerpts and background period music enhances the audio. A bonus booklet lists all the musical segments by name, composer, and presenter.
Bonus also offers 9 performance pieces, a half hour concert for the viewer's own ""home throne and court"" listening.
This DVD deserves a timpani roll.",1378944000,15,2373,6.357142857142857
