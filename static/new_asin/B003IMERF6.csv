4127389,4,B003IMERF6,"""Being Human"" is another of the UK's gifts to mankind and has thankfully been imported to our shores unlike the even more awesome Dead Set, which is still only enjoyable to Americans with region free DVD players. The sitcom premise (a werewolf, ghost, and vampire sharing a flat) of this one belies it's flair for the dramatic. Not that Being Human isn't funny; it's very funny, but I wouldn't qualify it as a pure comedy by any stretch. The heart and soul of this show is the relationships between the characters and the strength they are able to muster together outweighing their many individual weaknesses and failings. The British have certainly been gathering a lot of steam on the supernatural/sci-fi television front and soon they may overtake America's offerings altogether. Let's just hope this one lasts.

The cast, then. Mitchell is the classic brooding vampire cut from the Angel mold. That is to say he's a former hell-raiser who has turned over a new leaf and is attempting to live a ""normal"" murder-free life. But old habits die hard. Whereas many vamp stories of this nature equate the vampire's hunger with drug addiction, in Mitchell's case his seems to be something even more applicable in the males of our species: sexual desire. His victims are typically one-night stands, and his denial of responsibility is about to bite him in the rear even as his former comrades put designs in motion to bring him back into the fold. Annie is the best character in my opinion. She's an outwardly cheerful spirit who is trying to figure out why she has been unable to pass on and she desperately wants to make contact with her fiance, who has moved on in life. In my opinion, her journey is the most interesting and dramatic as she eventually learns that the very emotions that make her feel vulnerable and weak can also give her great power. Just a great lovable, and relatable character. George is a bit of a mixed bag. He's whiny, shrill, and annoying in a way I've never really seen in a lead character but that wussiness is juxtaposed with the beast he harbors within him, which makes it interesting. Every full moon he undergoes a grotesque and agonizing transformation into a monstrous wolf and then awakens the next day not knowing where he is or what he's done. It's very American Werewolf in London, but who can argue with the classics? The supporting cast may actually be stronger then the primaries. Mitchell's sire, Herrick, is the series' main villain whose desire is to lead the vampires in an all-out war with humanity and he is extremely well-played. Lauren is Mitchells' last ""conquest"" who comes back to haunt him and raises a bit og hell in his life and there's also a freeloading werewolf who takes to teaching George the finer points of living with lychanthropy as well as an apathetic gothpop-loving ghost who takes a shine to Annie.  Even as these fellows of the characters teach them more about themselves, it becomes apparent that our heroes are not destined to succumb to the ways of their fellows and are in fact stronger and better for having each other to lean on even if it means being outcasts among their own kind as well as humanity.

The show is obviously very low-budget, but George's transformation scenes still look great. The wolf itself....well, it gets the job done and has very little screen time. The primary focus of the first season is on the vampires making their move and attempting to entice Mitchell into returning to the fold. George's attempted relationship with a co-worker who has some secrets of her own and Annie's struggle with coming to terms with the truth about her death are great secondary stories and flashbacks that tell the tales of Mitchell's exploits fill out the rest of the show, leaving just enough room for a little levity. The humor in Being Human is not as central as one would think, but it's very effective. George and Annie's confrontation with an office vampire who assures them that the only reason he hasn't ripped George's face off is because he just did ""the hooverin"" in there is particularly laugh-out-loud. Then there's Lauren attempting to menace George by telling him about the things that go bump in the night without realizing that he is a werewolf who rooms with a vamp and a ghost.  Hard to intimidate that guy with scary stories.  On the other hand there is some pretty devastating stuff in the show as well, such as an episode where Mitchell befriends a boy he saved from some bullies only to wind up being accused of pedophilia and be assaulted and harassed by the entire neighborhood.  Not the kind of attention a group of supernaturals in hiding need. The balance between the character-based comedy and drama is nearly perfect at times. Plus, the title premise is a very strong one in that it leads us to question what it is that truly makes us human.  It's a theme that is very common, but always compelling. Turns out that being a monster is just a part of being human. But you knew that already didn't you?

Being Human is not yet on the level of American shows like Buffy and Supernatural, but it isn't far off.  The first season was a mere 6 episodes, but the amount that is accomplished storywise in that time is extraordinary. If they extended the seasons to at least twice that to make more room for character development and humor, I feel this could be one of the best shows out there, period. Good news is, season two is underway. Being Human is must-see tv for fans of supernatural/fantasy/sci-fi dramas. There is an American remake planned, but don't wait for the pale, watered-down imitation.  Get with the real deal.",1277251200,32,5632,4.708629441624366
4127390,2,B003IMERF6,"SPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING!

""Being Human"" is a British series with an interesting concept. What happens if a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost live in the same house in a boring British town? Quite a lot, it turns out.

Annie is a friendly female ghost who realizes that her boyfriend murdered her. Mitchell is a vampire who is trying to quit. George is a human who occasionally turns into a werewolf. His girlfriend has no idea. Together, Annie, Mitchell and George are trying to live normal lives in the British town of Bristol. This turns out to be easier said than done. The sociopath who killed Annie happens to be their landlord. The local police are heavily infiltrated by evil vampires, who plan to take over the world (or at least Bristol). To make matters worse, Mitchell is stalked by a former girlfriend who also happens to be a vampire!

I must admit that I didn't really like ""Being Human"". The series is too slow paced, George and Annie are real nerds, and there's no real balance between the serious parts and the uncanny humour of some episodes. The whole thing feels very uneven.

Still, the series could be of some interest to undead lovers of the vampire genre. At least if you don't take vampires too seriously, since ""Being Human"" often makes fun of the usual vampire stereotypes. In the series, vampires turn out to be afraid not only of crucifixes, but also of the Jewish Star of David. The werewolf George turns out to be Jewish, something he puts to good use when fighting the bad guys. And yes, the evil vampire brotherhood uses an undertaker as cover!

Personally, I only give this series two stars, but yes, I'm subjective...",1276992000,10,1659,4.648464163822526
4127391,4,B003IMERF6,"I just finished watching this show with my fiance. I think that it starts a bit slow. The first few episodes is just the main character's going about their everyday lives as British underclass folks. That they are supernatural creatures do make it a bit more interesting. But all in all I found the first episodes boring, nothing was really happening and the locations it was filmed in was just dreary. The humor is fun at times but often it is just flat. But the series really take a turn for the better towards the end of the season. The personalities of the characters get more developed and things start happening. I also notice that what I originally found a bit boring, the extreme everyday life feel of the series, sort of grew on me and became something I like about it because it is different.

Being Human is about a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost sharing a house together in Bristol. They are everyday folks despite their supernatural natures. The vampire and the werewolf work as helpers at the local hospital and the ghost try to deal with her death. After a while the trio get involved with problems in supernatural society at large.

You need a bit of patience to enjoy this show as it do move slowly. Most of all this is drama with a bit of humor thrown in. Most of the episodes is the characters trying to deal with things in their lives which their supernatural natures complicate. This show is like a typical British small town drama, just with the main characters being classical movie monsters. However if you have the patience for it then it is a very good show.",1276992000,3,1585,4.5
4127392,5,B003IMERF6,"I have to admit, I've been planning the title for this review since I watched the very first episode of BEING HUMAN.  The premise does seem like the set up for a bad joke.  But, truth be told, BEING HUMAN is anything but a joke; rather, it is an interesting and unique look at what BEING HUMAN really means.

My husband and I found this tv series quite by accident.  The six episodes from the first season of BEING HUMAN aired on BBC (2008) and later on BBC America.  It is a quirky, odd little comedy-drama, but one that certainly grows on you, especially if you are a fan of the urban paranormal genre.

In BEING HUMAN, we meet a vampire (Mitchell), a werewolf (George), and a ghost (Annie) who end up sharing a house together in Bristol, England.  Mitchell and George are hospital orderlies who are trying to lead ""normal"" lives.  Mitchell has been killing and feeding for over a hundred years and wants no more of it.  George is a recent werewolf convert and is a mild mannered young man who really has no clue how deal with his inner beast.  Mitchell and George recognize each other for what they are and decide that they can help each other - George is to help Mitchell overcome those nasty cravings, and Mitchell is to keep George locked up during his time of the month.  So they move in to a flat near the hospital and set up housekeeping.  Things start happening in the new flat that are strange even to a vamp and a lycan.  But soon, they discover Annie, the recently dead former occupant of apartment, who not only won't move on, but can't for some reason.  The three settle down into their own odd little family, and try their very best to be what each one of them wants so desperately to be:  normal...human...  Or, at least, as human as possible.  Of course, given their unique circumstances, normalcy and humanity don't come easy, and that is what makes BEING HUMAN so entertaining.

The acting in BEING HUMAN is quite good and very believable.  Aidan Turner as the vamp who just wants to be loved is wonderfully dark and brooding, but he has a lighter side, too.  Russell Tovey is just about perfect as dorky and innocent wolf who is in total denial about his condition.  And Lenora Crichlow is convincing as the newly dead ghost who can't quite figure out what is going on (although she is just a bit whiny).  The three have good rapport and chemistry, and that is what makes BEING HUMAN click.

As with all the best shows, the key is in the writing, and the writing for BEING HUMAN is quite good.  The timing, the interactions, and the ""throw away"" lines all gel quite well, making BEING HUMAN something more than you might expect it to be.  If you like urban fantasy, paranormal stories, or British television, then you will enjoy BEING HUMAN.  And at the end of one of the early episodes, a vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost do, in fact, walk into a bar.",1276041600,7,2873,4.424761904761905
4127393,4,B003IMERF6,"What do you get when you put a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf in the same apartment?

No, there isn't a punchline, because it's not actually a joke (unless you really, really hate urban fantasy). It's the description of ""Being Human,"" a bittersweet little dramedy about a little supernatural gang trying to live their lives in an mundane world -- pretty good acting, a cool concept, and a slow-building plot about some rather ambitious vampires.

A youngish vampire named John Mitchell (Aidan Turner) and his werewolf buddy George (Russell Tovey) move into a nice rented house, and find themselves with a third roommate -- a ghost named Annie (Lenora Crichlow) who becomes almost solid as she hangs around the guys. George and Mitchell work a pair of low-level hospital jobs, and attempt to do normal things like date, go out to pubs, and keep house.

However, the trio still have supernatural problems to deal with: Mitchell is struggling to stay ""on the wagon,"" George is in denial about his beastly transformations, and Annie longs to see her ex-fiance (as well as trying to find out what her earthly tie is). And they have to deal with enraged mobs, more ghosts, homeless werewolves, and the local vampire community (why are they in communities and the wolves are ""alone""?), who are planning something major.

""Being Human Season 1"" is one of those shows that isn't brilliant, but it IS clever and fun -- especially the whole idea of watching a werewolf, vampire and ghost trying to live ""normal"" lives (""What is it about us that says 'we need jam'?""). And the writers have some fun mocking the cliches of the urban fantasy genre (where else will you see a ""little old lady"" vampire?) while also delving into the painful issues of temptation, loss, and what it means to be human.

The first four episodes are a smooth mix of comedy and drama, with some hilarious dialogue (""Who looks in their salad cooler, sees their tomatoes are on the turn and thinks 'Oh no, I'll hang on to those in case some paedos move in opposite'?""). But there's a darker subplot about Vampires Seeking World Domination twined with the one-off plots. And in the fifth episode the storyline suddenly blossoms into a dark, harrowing little plot. Good stuff.

And the main actors do pretty good jobs -- Tovey is quite good as a geeky, mild-mannered werewolf who tormented by his inner beast, and Crichlow is very endearing as a fluttery, brave ghost. Turner is also good as a laddish vampire with a playful side (""The SHIN, George!""), but he doesn't quite have the punky anorexic glamour of Guy Flanigan (the original Mitchell... boy was he sexy!).

There really isn't enough vampire/werewolf stuff on television, and ""Being Human Season 1"" is a clever little addition to the genre. Not brilliant, but definitely fun.",1272499200,22,2794,4.808333333333334
4127394,1,B003IMERF6,"While this is technically a region-free release, it is at 50 Hz and therefore not playable on U.S. Blu-ray players.  Best to wait for the U.S. release this summer.",1271980800,10,163,4.620689655172414
4127395,5,B003IMERF6,". . . and best werewolf and best ghost show on TV.  Mind you, I like TRUE BLOOD and have even come to see the upside to THE VAMPIRE DIARIES, but both of those are enjoyable diversions with no real subtext (TRUE BLOOD gestures at subtext with its parallels with prejudice against all kinds of difference, but in 2010 that is a pretty worked over subtext and lacks power at this point).  But if you want more depth of subtext and a more subtle narrative and richer character development and, well, less garishness, than this is a show you should check out.  Not yet available in the U.S. on DVD and Blu-ray (every time I have checked on Amazon I've only seen an outrageously overpriced $70 Blu-ray that never seems to be available -- though if you have an all regions DVD player, you can order an infinitely more affordable edition from Great Britain, which I strongly recommend, I repeat, only if you have an All-Regions player).  There are only six episodes in Season One and eight in Seasons Two, so the idea of paying over $10 per episode is rather offensive.  But you can either catch the show on BBC America or on Region 2 DVDs.

The series starts when two orderlies at a hospital at Bristol decide to room together.  What makes this desirable for them is that they are supernatural creatures.  Mitchell is a vampire.  Not a terribly old one by vampire narrative standards (less than a century old).  George is a werewolf and on three nights a week has a rather violent transformation into a truly nasty beastie (and thanks to CGI his transformations are truly horrendous).  Both of them are trying to pass as normal humans, and for economic reasons and simply because they don't want to live alone, they decide to find an apartment together.  By happy circumstance, the apartment they find and move into is inhabited by an outrageously sunny and upbeat ghost named Annie.  Together, the three of them try to lives that are as normal as possible.

The trouble is, the rest of the world doesn't want them to live normal lives.  The vampire community (why does there always seem to be a vampire community?) wants Mitchell to return to the fold.  They especially don't want him living with a werewolf.  And meanwhile, the afterlife wants Annie to move on, into the light, and away from her human life.  So their struggles are unusually rich and complex.

What made BUFFY and ANGEL so vastly superior to TRUE BLOOD and MOONLIGHT and THE VAMPIRE DIARIES and the TWILIGHT series (both novels and movies) was what they were able to do with the premises, with the metaphorical richness of the stories.  TRUE BLOOD ends up being a glorious one-dimensional guilty pleasure show, all glorious surface with nothing beneath.  BEING HUMAN is much more like BUFFY, with richly developed, deliciously articulated stories with timely cultural references.  Mitchell's vampirism, for instance, is used less as a metaphor for homosexuality, as it is in TRUE BLOOD, but addiction and the difficulty of human self-control.

The show is driven by its appealing leads.  Russell Tovey (George) will be perhaps best known from his appearance on DR. WHO and the movie THE HISTORY BOYS, but Lenora Crichlow (Annie) and Aidan Turner (Mitchell) are appealing newcomers.  There are endless polls about who the hottest vampires are and if Mitchell were better known in the U.S. he'd almost certainly win them all.  He is a spectacular incarnation of the really bad boy who wants to be good but for whom it is a constant struggle.  George, meanwhile, is like the big silly family dog.  There is meanwhile absolutely noting ghostly about Annie except that she can't be seen.  She is dark complexioned, but if you had to assign a color to her personality, it would be yellow.  Bright yellow.  She is sunny and irrepressibly happy and upbeat.  Any room she is in has no dark corners.  In other words, the polar opposite of all of the stereotypes of ghosts.

SyFy has announced that they are developing an American version of BEING HUMAN.  Hopefully they won't blow it.  The BBC series is a great one.  I am not opposed to an American version, as long as it is more like the American adaptations of THE OFFICE than other efforts.  But even if it fails, it should be seen as a gesture towards the excellence of the original.  But even if the American version turns out well, if you love extremely high quality shows dealing with the supernatural, you should definitely know the original.  The only thing I hate about this show is that there have been only fourteen episodes to date.",1270944000,88,4548,4.707594936708861
4127396,5,B003IMERF6,"I loathe zombie/vampire stuff. Two exceptions: Game of Thrones and THIS. This show is fun, even when it's over the top.

As Shakespeare understood, every drama needs some comic relief and there are classic moments of lightness that balance out the intensity.  Aiden Turner as Mitchell the vampire has recreated an entirely different dimension to the characterization of the vampire.  He is a man with a conscious struggling like an addict to conquer that side of him. He is alternately a compassionate and frightening figure. Russell Tovey as the werewolf is like a lost soul, his life and career shattered by being attacked by a werewolf.  Lenora Crichlow, the ghost who haunts the house they all share, suffers from her untimely death. In their own way, each seeks to make the best of the existence forced upon them.

All the twists and turns, comic relief, brilliant writing and acting and sometimes the photography was fabulous. The background music is usually really good too.

4127444,5,B003IMERF6,"Even a sunny weekend is worth sacrificing for this British gem.  This show is sweet, witty, deep, and poignant study of a trio of people who have become...different...and are trying their hardest to just be human.
The result is a series as highly addicting  as Mitchell ' s bloodlust.
Saw the pilot and I am glad they made the replacements they did, with Aidan and Lenora masterfully cast as Mitchell and Annie.
George is delicious as an awkward, jittery, young man desparately trying to ignore the fact he turns into a wolf once a month, struggling to keep the raging beast within him that amnestically possesses his body from destroying the facade he is trying to build of a quiet normal life.
Mitchell is a mutable, sensitive, sunlight tolerant 150 year old vampire with soft spot for humanity, fighting internally with an insatiable thirst for blood who has sworn off his nightime maulings, but occasionally falls prey to its lure with disastrous consequences.  He is constantly harassed by a group of vampire leaders consistently trying to drag him back to the dark side and a vicious young woman he brought into the world of the half dead in who threatens his resolve, his sanity, and his existence.
Annie is the tortured spirit of a kind, loving young woman who died mysteriously in a tragic accident.  She is stuck in the world of the living as a shadow of what she once was, for reasons that, at first, escape her.
When the boys move into her house, and she discovers they can see, hear and touch her, what develops is a deep bond of friendship between the three supernatural  beings that  is constantly being attacked by the sometimes cruel world they dwell in and circumstances that surround them.
Brilliant, believe able acting, and characters you lose your heart for.  A real treasure of a series.",1431993600,6,1810,4.745222929936306

In my most humble opinion, as a screenwriter and novelist, I honestly must say the U.K. version is the pits... with a capital ""P"". The back stories are weak...at best, take forever to develop, at least, and are couched in so much extemporaneous activity it's almost impossible to pick out the when, where and how, much less the why.

4127468,5,B003IMERF6,"This show was such an unexpected surprise!! A bit cheesy at times, but the characters are so well written, and the actors breathe such life into them, that it's hard not to get swept up in the show! The three main characters are my favorite. The pairing, the friendship and the love between all three of them, while unlikely, is so believable. Some of the supernatural aspects don't always make sense. They kind of gloss over some tiny details/issues that may pop up, but the plot is so character driven it's not that hard to overlook. Will forewarn you, they do change up the leads in the middle of the series, which if you become a fan of the main trio, can be hard to bear. However, the new trio they bring in are all completely different, in a good way, and bring new life to the story. Props to ALL main actors (old and new) of the show. They are all so talented you can't help but be ensnared. Well worth checking out. One of my new favorite series!!",1424390400,4,956,4.316666666666666

The idea of a ghost, vampire and werewolf under the same roof is pretty entertaining to say the least. I was still hooked by this story and watched every season. And then I watched the American version after the British version. So I can say it's worth its salt. The acting was well done. After all, it is horror and there's not always a happy ending, now is there? Maybe that's what makes this story real. A must see for horror buffs.",1423958400,3,734,4.404411764705882

4127473,4,B003IMERF6,"With one drawback -- it's an excellent DVD set.  The series is very well written performed by incredibly skilled & talented actors with effective & believable special effects.  The ""special feature"" extras were fairly weak; but, they are not why anyone would buy the DVDs.  The drawback is that while this does include all six episodes of the first season, it does NOT include the pilot episode.  Possibly because while the actor portraying the character ""George"" (Russell Tovey) is in the pilot and the the season 1 episodes, the actors playing ""Mitchell"" and actresses playing ""Annie"" are not the same in the pilot and the on-going series.  Aidan Turner and Lenora Crichlow who play those roles in the main series are both wonderful ... so perhaps the BBC wanted to avoid confusion and not include the pilot.  But the first episode (despite the cast changes) would be have been improved if they at least coverage a summary of the pilot in dialogue.",1421884800,,950,4.833333333333333
4127474,5,B003IMERF6,"I watched the American version of this series first, which was kind of cheesy. The acting wasn't great and the characters were a little annoying (The ghost-girl and the werewolf chick drove me up the wall!). Still, I watched it through it's entirety because I wanted to finish what I started, and most of it wasn't all that bad except for some of the story line in the last 2 seasons, which I found so tedious I began fast-forwarding through quite a bit.

This British version is excellent however, and SO far superior to the US version that it almost seems like a different show, even with all it's similarities. The acting is excellent, and the characters are likeable and believable. I'm only into the 3rd season though, so we'll see how it goes.

UPDATE: Continued watching to the end of the series. The last few shows of season 3 and the whole of season 4 was just AWFUL. Season 4 had nothing to do with the first 3 seasons, and season 5, which actually wasn't too bad (until the end), was a completely different show with a different (but also likeable) cast, and literally nothing in common with the first 3 seasons either except that a vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost were roomates.

Being Human the (UK) Season 1 is mediocre at best.  The first episode jumps to far into the story and the trio is just a weaker line-up than what I grew used to in the US version.  There are five seasons, each with their shortcomings, but the biggest weakness in this show is that it is really 3 shows, season 1, 2, and 3.

4127529,4,B003IMERF6,"I discovered the American version of Being Human years ago, and watched several episodes before giving up on it. I liked the premise but found the show disappointing.

Eventually I learned that the American version was a spin-off of a British series of the same title.  I found the UK version online, and have been watching it on Amazon Prime.  (If you're a Prime member, some TV series, including this one, are free, making it easy to try them out and see if you like them.) (Plus, you feel like you're getting your money's worth with your prime membership.)

I found the British version (particularly the first three seasons) to be much better than the American version. It's well written, well acted, beautifully directed and edited.  The characterization is  much stronger, and the stories more involving.  It's a work of art, darker and more disturbing because the characters are so disturbingly and effectively real.

The first three seasons are wonderful.  I don't care as much for the remaining two.  After the original actors left, the writers didn't seem to know what to do with the remaining ones.  They turned more to dry comedy, less to horror based in the struggle for humanity that was portrayed in the early episodes.

I recommend watching the British version of Being Human on Amazon Prime, if you live in the U.S., rather than buying the DVDs, because of reports that some of the DVDs are incompatible with American DVD players.",1399075200,2,1446,4.833333333333333

I was drawn in to the characters and their relationship with each other from the beginning and the storyline became more enticing as the episodes progressed. This is one of those rare instances where the acting, the script, and the production quality equally produced an excellent series.",1398988800,,364,5.186440677966102

I've only completed season 1 of the UK season and love it.  I can't wait to watch the rest of the seasons.,1398038400,,262,4.098039215686274
4127533,4,B003IMERF6,"I like this very much.  It is flawed, primarily in its failure to maintain any type of internal logic (the rules for the vampires, werewolves and, most egregiously ghosts, tend to change, sometimes from one episode to the next), but the acting ranges from good to very good, and the world created here feels very real even with the inconsistencies.  Very emotionally intense with some humor to balance things out.  Recommend.",1397779200,,425,4.957746478873239

4127535,5,B003IMERF6,"I worked my way backwards from the US version of this series to the original BBC version here, and wasn't disappointed - in fact I laughed even harder and cringed in greater horror at the horrible antics of vampire Mitchell (smoldering-hot and yet lovably goofy Aidan Turner), the tea-making, conflicted ghost Annie and gentle werewolf George. Aidan Turner as Mitchell is by turns smokier and much funnier than the American actor who plays this character; he's a bit goofy but can glower and go fanged with the very Oldest and Worst. If you've seen Tovey in The History Boys, then you already know the man is freaking hilarious. It was delightful to see him do 'George' and render the character even more unforgettable, frequent-nakedness, screaming and all. Warning: the BBC version is grittier and gorier in my opinion, with the more graphic sex, some nudity, and profanity that BBC television doesn't even blink an eye at; not appropriate for children. Yet, I loved it.",1396656000,2,972,4.932926829268292

4127538,5,B003IMERF6,"Loved the Characters with the humor and serious nature of the program..For fiction and over all I rate it high. Have to say that I was disappointed however that Season 2,3, are not offered or available at this time on Prime... Wondering why that is???",1395705600,,251,4.6
4127539,4,B003IMERF6,"This series I found to be much better than the US version.  It is darker, grittier and has just the right amount of comic relief at just the right times.  I became attached to a few of the characters that left, however they were replaced by others that I became attached to as well.  The concept for the series I found to be an interesting one and the story line kept me guessing although some were predictable.  If you enjoy stories about vampires, werewolves and ghosts this is a great viewing for you.  If you're looking for another Twilight, then pass on this for it is definitely made for a more mature audience as some of the story lines are quite gory, but I loved them.  If you've seen the US version, then check this one out, it's better.",1395360000,,747,4.338129496402877

4127553,5,B003IMERF6,"The idea of putting three non-humans in a flat where they work though the problems of daily life as well as the problems that come with being a vampire, werewolf and a ghost. No one ever thinks that these beings might just want to get on with their lives and not be singled out as being terrifying or weird. This show explores that as well as the problems that come with the fact that two of them can be very dangerous to others at times and hate themselves for being that way. None of them chose their condition and they are all just doing the best they can.

It's brilliantly cast with Aidan Turner (pre-Hobbit Kili), Russell Tovey a brilliant actor and Lenora Crichlow, who brings an amazing sweetness to her role as the ghost, Annie.",1391904000,2,737,4.419117647058823

Aidan Turner is, as a ghost said, smoking hot and a good actor. Russell Tovey has great charisma and is a good actor too. I was a bit shocked at his screaming during transformations but pretty sure anyone would scream that went through something like that. It added a new level of reality to it. Lenora Crichlow was a bit too chatty and upbeat for me. I think I preferred the American Annie, aka Sally (Meaghan Rath), who had more of a sense of tragedy about her. But still I enjoyed the show. I was surprised at all the nudity, mostly...backal, but occasionally frontal. And the cursing which is not allowed even on most American cable. But the show seemed to fit better in the UK than the US, where it was less believable.

Watched all programs in first three seasons totally engrossed. Tried watching beyond the third season but it just wasn't the same without Aidan Turner's Mitchell. Once I learned Aidan was cast in The Hobbit trilogy, I purchased the first three seasons of BH and have recently enjoyed watching all three once again.  The writing, the backdrops -- especially the two ""homes"", the supporting actors were all superb.  The very best part of this series for me was the chemistry between the four main characters.

I liked the differences, although I am also biased towards the American produced version. The actors in this version don't seem so sympathetic. The werewolf, for example, doesn't seem to have the same pathos as ""Josh"" does... he is simply not the Bambi-eyed character I had grown used to.

4127591,5,B003IMERF6,"I chose a five star rating because this series is great.  I have seen the American version and didn't really know it started in England.  I think the actors are fabulous and the story line is so interesting!!
Love it:)",1375488000,,218,4.425
4127592,2,B003IMERF6,"Interesting concept for a show, and I like the actors and the humor.  But there is absolutely no consistent logic to be found.  Sometimes the ghost is invisible, sometimes she isn't and no one realizes she is dead.  She travels by bus with a boiled ham with parsley sauce, as though it is no big deal. The vampire almost never drinks blood and doesn't seem to care all that much.  Apparently he can subsist on normal human food, coffee, and cigarettes.  Oh, and he can walk around in daylight freely.  The vampires display very little in the way of ""super powers"", other than fangs and black eyes.  And death by stake-through-the-heart is optional.  The werewolf guy is a whiny wimp, with no sign of wolfy-ness except when he transforms, which is done pretty well on a low-budget.",1375315200,3,780,4.642335766423358

4127595,5,B003IMERF6,"A vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost share a flat in Bristol....

Sounds dreadful, right? But it's not; it's brilliant. This first season of ""Being Human"" begins each episode with a voiceover by one of the main characters, reflecting on life as a ""supernatural."" They drop this by second season, but I rather liked the contemplative tone, along with the montage of scenes that begin each episode. The writing by Toby Whithouse is witty, trenchant, and topical without being overly moralizing. The actors fit their roles perfectly: Lenora Crichlow as sweet, relentlessly cheerful Annie, the ghost with the tender heart (her generosity of spirit manifesting itself in the making of countless mugs of tea, none of which she can drink, as she is a ghost) who wonders why she's been left behind as a spirit in the world of the living, and whose goal is to find out what her ""unfinished business"" might be; Russell Tovey as screechy, fastidious, twitchy, nerdy George, the reluctant werewolf who just wants a normal life and who is in denial about his ""condition,"" as he elliptically refers to it; Aidan Turner as sexy vampire Mitchell, who has a dark and violent past, but its attempting to put it all behind him, as he's gone ""on the wagon"" and is trying to become more human. They are joined by cast members Jason Watkins as Herrick, the head of the vampires in Bristol, and possibly the most creepily frightening character on television: he looks like someone's kindly old uncle, but his smile could make paint blister; and Sinead Keenan as nurse Nina, who is first exasperated by, then enraged by, then intrigued by, and finally captivated by nervous George and his many gaffes (sorry, only a minor spoiler there); and Annabel Scholey as Lauren, a vampire against her will, who stuggles with her newfound bloodlust much as a heroin addict does, and who also longs for her lost days of innocence. In amongst all the drama and the musings on what makes us human, what makes us monsters, and the intertwining storylines, there is also a refreshing thread of the mundane: they order in pizza, they watch television together, they have arguments over housework, they object to each other's friends, they have the neighbors over for tea. It's a perfect blend of humor, drama, and philosophy.

By the way, avoid the American remake of this. Although Toby Whithouse is listed as a co-producer of that series and the set-up and storylines are similar, the writing is painfully bad and the three characters not remotely as engaging.",1374192000,4,2519,4.855813953488372

4127609,5,B003IMERF6,I would give this show 5 stars because of how I feel I could watch this show thru again and again. The video plays like a 10 on Xbox and about a 6 on my crappy laptop. The audio was the same.,1368835200,,191,3.5714285714285716

8397483,5,B003IMERF6,"I absolutely love this show! Getting into it was a little bit slow, but after the first couple of episodes, I was hooked. Each character brings something different to the screen and the difference between this show and others about werewolves and vampires is very unique. As someone with a big imagination and a published author looking to write future stories about supernatural beings, I'm always interested in the different interpretations of vampires and werewolves, and this one stood out. I felt like I was watching a combination of all these shows that focus on one or the other. It was a great mix of comedy and suspense with splashes of romance thrown in that get your heart racing. And who can resist mentioning Aidan Turner? Everything I've ever seen him in, he doesn't disappoint me. His ability to become his character is mesmerizing and it's no different on this show. Very excited to see how Season 3 ends, but also nervous since (spoiler!) I know Aidan Turner isn't in seasons 4 and 5.",1497916800,,1001,4.758620689655173
8397484,5,B003IMERF6,"I started watching this a couple of years before I had heard of the U.S. spin, and I just fell in love with Lenora Critchlow; she brought beauty, sensitivity and a desire for self-improvement to the role of Annie. I found her so compelling that even though they went through a nearly complete cast change in season 4, leaving only her out of the original three main characters, I still loved it. The first three seasons had a couple of truly standout character actors such as Jason Watkins as Herrick, a WONDERFUL bad guy, soooo creepy!  Then there was Sinead Keenan as Nina, who can't be more than five feet tall in heels but gives the impression of being nine feet tall and bullet-proof. Absolutely wonderful! And then there is Russell Tovey in the role of George, the werewolf, whose range as an actor is just amazing. His chemistry with Keenan is so convincing that I didn't pick up on his being gay. After I read that about hi, it was so obvious that I couldn't believe I hadn't seen it earlier! SUCH a cutie!! Then of course there's Aidan Turner as John Mitchell; simply WOW. So intense one minute, then gentle and playful the next. These very talented young actors, guided by a wonderful set of directors and writers made the show a total must for me. Most of the cast got killed off in the fourth season but excellent writing, production and direction saved it, at least mostly.

In the U.S. version, I just couldn't get past Meaghan Rath. She abrasive, selfish and self-centered and I just couldn't find any saving grace in her character. It could be that I needed to give it a while and I intend to watch it again because I just love Sam Huntington. I'm not a big fan of Sam Witwer, although I think he's got some talent. Anyway, if you love the U.S. Being Human, you may or may not like the original, but give it a shot. It's worth every second!",1489881600,2,1856,4.439882697947214
