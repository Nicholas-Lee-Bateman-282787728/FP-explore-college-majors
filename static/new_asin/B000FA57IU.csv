2556600,5,B000FA57IU,"I went to see this play in Portland, Oregon.  It was totally outstanding. For the person that said he takes us back in years, sometimes you have to go back down memory lane to remember where you came from so some the things you encountered you know not to encounter them again.  Tyler Perry is a vessel used by God, the messages in his plays have changed and inspired many lives.  Keep doing what you do, their are always going to be critics but it is more critical that you continue to let God use you.  This is one of the best plays he's done.",1149033600,54,545,4.161904761904762

This young man boldly addresses real issues raw & ""un-sugarcoated"" with a message of hope that with God's help we can overcome ANYTHING. In Madea Goes To Jail the Play (as he often does in the plays) he becomes so overcome with emotion on the subject of letting go of people that harm your life that he lost himself and came out of charactor. The words coming out were from deep within his soul and so perfectly addressed a situation in my own life that I couldn't hold back the flood of tears that had been damed up inside my heart. It left me breathless and forced me to truthfully look at, and deal with, a very serious situation in my life.

2557030,4,B000FA57IU,"""Madea Goes to Jail"" is yet another bawdy, simplistic and politically incorrect live musical play in Tyler Perry's long-runnning comedy franchise. As Mr. Perry plays her, Madea is a big, busty, pistol-packing and hot-tempered southern grandmother/matriarch who stands six-foot five and packs a solid wallop.  Like so much soap opera, Madea's stories center around the travails of work-a-day folks:  sex, incarceration, adultery, drugs, violence and the meaning of family, church and God in the Black community (this DVD has at least one surprise:  Brian Hurst's portrayal of the lone[and rare] White character blends right in and appears by far to be the most talented of the cast's male singers). All of this may be a bit over the top, but Madea is undeniably funny and she's always entertaining. Yes, sometimes the overamplified singing (replete with excessive vocal gymnastics) is just too much--no one seems to have heard of the less-is-more concept. But judging from the size of the arenas Mr. Perry plays, that may be what his vast--and surprisingly diverse--audience demands.  And who are we to insult anyone else's taste?  Anyone looking for heavy realism and accurate, true-to-life downers need look elsewhere.  That is obviously not Mr. Perry's calling.  If his message of preachy uplift turns someone's life around for the better, then who are we to complain?  Those who pontificate about Perry's tendency to traffic in stereotypes would do well to remember that these were not created out of thin air:  stereotypes spring from REALITY!
No one would ever mistake the ""Madea"" musical-comedies for ""Phantom of the Opera"" and the audience knows (or at least should have some clue as to) what its in for. Aside from the works of the late great August Wilson (to whom Mr. Perry certainly CANNOT be compared), there has been precious little in mainstream theater that has reflected Mr. Perry's demographic.
I tend to like Mr. Perry precisely because he has no pretensions about creating ""high art.""  His Madea is never afraid or hesitant to let it all hang out, warts and all. She knows how to have a good time.  Likewise, the playwright knows his audience, he's exceedingly generous and he never falters on delivering what he does best.",1241222400,,2242,5.081743869209809

2557036,2,B000FA57IU,"I've watched all of Tyler Perry's ""Madea"" plays/films, and I have enjoyed all of them thoroughly except this one.

First off, if you're sensitive at all to depictions of child abuse and neglect, corporal punishment, or some of the more ""old-fashioned"" ways some people treat minors, you may want to skip this one.  There's a girl of sixteen in the play who is the child of a pimp and a prostitute and who thus becomes Madea's foster child until her mother gets out of jail.  Also, though I realize some people may think hitting a child with a belt until they scream is appropriate discipline, or believe that a teenage girl has no right to any privacy, or expect a child to act as though she has no right to enter a room without greeting the adults there verbally...well, I don't, and if I'd realized so much of the film was going to depict that sort of thing, I never would have watched it.

Also, the film meanders and takes far too many long digressions.  I love Madea's outbursts, speeches, and tirades, but they go on far too long and far too often in this film.  Add to that the fact that the entire play comes to a screeching halt so that all the characters can take turns singing one by one, and it goes too far.  (Moreover, this is just my personal impression, but while I can enjoy almost anyone's singing, there is one character whose voice truly grates on my nerves.)

In short, it's just not that great.",1231891200,,1416,4.4192307692307695

2557048,2,B000FA57IU,"It's a stage play! If I wanted to see a stage play, I'd go to a theatre. I thought the idea to make this a stage play took away from the realism of the movie/play. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't buy this DVD. I like Tyler Perry, but he could've re-thought this one. Needless to say, I was dissapointed, and hit the off button before it was over.",1217376000,,359,3.864864864864865
2557049,3,B000FA57IU,"After watching ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" I wanted to purchase more of Tyler Perry's movies.  This particular movie was a live play rather then a movie.  This doesn't mean it was not good, it was just different.  The good news is that Tyler Perry is planning to do more movies.  I highly recommend them for Teens on up for good values that are presented in all his movies.  These are all Christian based and we sure could use more of this kind of comedy.  Another good Tyler Perry movies is ""Madea's Family Reunion"".  I give it 5 stars.!  You can own them a resonable prices from Amizon.com.

2557050,5,B000FA57IU,I loved this play and can not wait to see the movie!! This was def the funniest of the Madea collection.,1216252800,,104,4.0
2557051,5,B000FA57IU,I love this stage play and can't wait until a bigscreen version is complete. You will see a lot of Madea in this video and hipper cooler music. This video is all about the jokes and a few messages. You must buy this video.,1212624000,,222,4.068181818181818
2557052,4,B000FA57IU,"Madea is one of my favorite characters of all time, so if I see her name, I'll automatically buy anything to do with her.  She has a no nonsense look on life that is amusing and refreshing.  The characters around her balance her out since they are the serious current of the storyline.  Tyler Perry does an excellent job in bringing humor to sensitive situations, and this play didn't disappoint me.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it dragged on during the songs.

I applaud Perry for having the courage to confront issues like adultery, unintentional murder of an infant, and loving again after a divorce.  Blending humor just makes the play that much more memorable.  Life is serious but humor does a body good.  I do agree that Madea was the highlight of this play.  She is the shining star.",1211414400,,818,4.5479452054794525

Sure, he returns to the themes that were present in his previous plays (infidelity,  child abuse) but I have to say that the writing is simply superb. As soon as Madea hits the stage, the jokes come at you like a fast spitball.  Since I'm not really a fan of musicals, I only tolerated the singing in Mr. Perry's previous DVDs because of the good script. But in ""Madea Goes to Jail"", the singing is a perfect compliment to the play.  The gospel favorite, ""Jesus loves me"" is an absolute tear-jerker. Trust me, you definitely won't be disappointed with this DVD.",1202515200,,599,4.467889908256881

I just love Tyler Perry and "" Madea Goes To Jail"" will have you laughing so hard, you'll be crying because you are laughing so hard! Tyler Perry speaks about many life situations in this movie.  The cast was absolutely wonderful.  I bought (not bootlegged) every play Tyler Perry released on DVD and I can watch them and never get tired.  If you want to have a good laugh and get your praise on too, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND ""Madea Goes To Jail"" to anyone.  And to the person who called hisself ""jimbo the rebel""-(Look at all the reviews: You'll know whom I'm talking about)
You need not to put down the brother- maybe you're jealous of Tyler Perry and if he's such a disgrace, then let me ask you this question. Why has he been so successful? I tell you why- because the Lord has smiled on him and has put his stamp of approval on Tyler Perry because he is a born-again Christian. Anyone who put the Lord first will always be a success!
So stop your criticism about the man and give him the respect that he so richly deserve and I'm sure there are others who will agree with me about Tyler Perry. I'm a big fan of Tyler Perry and I don't appreciate you putting him down like you did in your review in spite of the fact that you can express your opinion so I also have the right to express mine. LEAVE THE MAN ALONE! Tyler Perry will always have my support and if anyone don't have his movies, I only have two words for you: BUY THEM!",1172016000,,1502,4.201388888888889

I don't want to see that mess.""  After seeing ""I Can Do Bad By Myself,"" she went out and bought the entire Madea collection for her husband!

This one, ""Madea Goes to Jail,"" is what kept me from sleeping, and nearly shattered my hearing, on the way home.  Black man in drag plays loud, intimidating, violent virago--it wasn't funny in 1906, and it isn't funny in 2006.  I am baffled and angry that Tyler Perry has resurrected this ugly staple of an unmourned past.  There was no plot.  The writing was worthy of a seventh-grader.  The platitudes were non-stop.  And the cues for the sad attempts at ""songs"" were so obvious that I almost wept, because I knew that another assault on my ears was coming.  It would seem that the prostituting of young black girls by their own mothers or fathers or both is a favorite plot device of Perry's, as it showed up in both these regrettable videos.  He uses it, and the other obvious emotional levers he pulls, as a device to win the approval of his uncritical audience, which will whoop with recognition and pleasure when these triggers are pulled, regardless of the lack of literary, dramatic, or other merit of the material. When are black people going to stop celebrating violence, particularly the violent punishment of children?  When are black people going to stop gyrating in orgiastic delirium at the mere mention of ""de Lawd""?  And where did black writers/""composers"" like Perry get the idea that if you scream it loud enough, you need neither poetry, beauty, harmony, nor symmetry?  We don't need violent Aunt Jemimas in 2006, and, if you value your history, your intellect, and your hearing, you don't need ""Madea.""",1165017600,5,1621,4.75

It also reminded me of my childhood when belts were popular. Using discipline let's your child know that you love them and that what they did was wrong and to encourage them not to do it again. It also proved that with love and guidance, the child could feel love and be inspired to do better in life. I highly recommend this movie.",1154390400,,477,4.252747252747253
2557209,5,B000FA57IU,"This is another great play from Tyler Perry.  Madea is off the hook in this one as well, and this one is just as funny as the rest, if not funnier.  Great lessons to be heeded, excellent for the whole family to watch.  And, of course, very hilarious!",1154390400,,250,4.166666666666667

Good work Tyler!",1154217600,,200,4.0
2557253,3,B000FA57IU,THE PLAY WAS OK. TO ME IT WAS'NT ALL THAT FUNNY. BUT THE PHILOSPHY AND WHAT MADEA WAS SAYING WAS REALLY WORTH LISTENING TOO AND UNDERSTANDING.,1154131200,,142,4.5

TYLER PERRY IS GREAT, I WISH HE WAS MY SON. --RUTH L. WILSON --DESERT HOT SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA",1154044800,,336,4.333333333333333
2557257,5,B000FA57IU,"This film is funny but it makes you look at your relationships as well. Could your best friend really do something like this to you? Keep a watchful eye out. This was also a role reversal, it is usually the women who put their men through school and the men who are usually so heartless that they eventually leave.",1154044800,,314,4.338983050847458
2557258,1,B000FA57IU,"I'll start off by saying that it's expected of a movie titled ""Madea Goes To Jail"" to actually be about Madea going to jail! about 15 minutes of the movie at most are spent of her being in jail, which would have made a hilarious movie had it actually stuck to a jail-related plot. Total disappointment. The movie contains scattered plotlines that could have and should have been more developed. Some characters only existed for the purpose of giving monologues, Perry continues to make this same mistake over and over throughout his movies.

At times, the movie is funny, but it is less hilarious than his beginning movies. The lack of him continuing his humor draws attention to the fact that his movie is poorly written.

The movie encourages child abuse. It supports corporal punishment, and clearly displays that it is okay for two grown adults to take turns beating a newly-adopted child with a belt is okay. Not only is child abuse wrong, but it isn't even Madea's child! There is no reaction to this from the child's mother, which is due for her, because if someone took turns with their friend beating my child they would be in jail, to say the least.

The movie is preachy and gives simple solutions to complicated problems that demand more than such answers. This entire movie is not well thought out, and it strikes me that Tyler Perry, someone who claims to be a troubled victim of child abuse, would then advocate it. It strikes me that he is now more concerned with giving his small politically-incorrect audience advice that they want to hear, whether or not it is intelligent, well thought out, or morally upright.

Don't even bother buying it.",1154044800,6,1660,4.713793103448276
2557259,5,B000FA57IU,"I am a big fan of Tyler Perry.  He makes you think, laugh and just appreciate his great talent. I really enjoyed the interviews with the cast, and  seeing all the folks responsible for making the production GO. I like Tyler Perry, because he creates plays and movies that the entire  family can watch,PLUS THEY HAVE A  MESSAGE.  Thanks TP.  May God continue to use you.",1154044800,,369,4.515151515151516
2557280,4,B000FA57IU,very funny. the singing is off the top.  Madea finally goes to jail but was not long enough to me to be this titled.  I would recommend this movie.  familar actors from tyler previous shows.,1154044800,,190,4.371428571428571

2557282,5,B000FA57IU,"I have all the Madea Plays and Movies, and this is the best of them all.  This was hilarious from start to finish.  Tyler Perry definately kicked it up a notch.  I watched the DVD three times in the first week I owned it.  Also loved the section where the ""Old School"" signing was.  I didn't realize Tyler could sign like that.  This was by far some of Tyler's best work.",1153440000,,371,4.154929577464789
2557283,5,B000FA57IU,"I had heard of Madea and Tyler Perry before. I knew exactly who they were but for some reason had put off watching any of the movies or plays on DVD.

Well this past July 4th holiday my family and I were visiting in Philly and my uncle put this DVD on. I haven't laughed that hard for a long time. My husband was on a couch in another room trying to take a nap and had to get up and come watch the movie because we were all laughing so hard.

All I can say now is ""Why was I sleeping on Madea for so long, what the hell was I waiting for?""

After returning home I bought his 4 DVD collection from this site and rented Family Reunion and Diary and loved them all!

You go Tyler!!!",1152576000,6,679,3.8633093525179856

2557285,5,B000FA57IU,Another OUTSTANDING performance with solid laughs throughout.  The underlying message is never lost despite the hilarious antics. Awesome singing from the entire cast... Including Madea! I have owned this for two days and have already watched it twice.,1152144000,8,252,5.631578947368421
2557286,4,B000FA57IU,"tyler perry did good work on putting this wonderful cast together.

unlike some stage plays i've seen on dvd, this one had a great chemistry onstage and tp did a good job on getting it all together.

I met Christain - the husband in this, a couple of years ago, but durnit, he had his clothes on and i'm really pissed about that one. Next time i meet him I'm definitely going to ask him to open his shirt for me cause i can't stop thinking bout that cross. LMAO.

although i'm still wondering what a man could buy to know he loves me? i'll treat you for dinner and a movie if you let me know that answer to that one, TP, LOL.",1151884800,2,625,4.024193548387097
2557287,5,B000FA57IU,"He is so talented. I have seen everyone of his plays and movies. I was told by a friend that ""Madea goes to jail"" was not as great as the ones before. I bought the play and was amazed at how wrong she was. It is as funny, if not funnier, than the previous ones.",1151712000,4,261,3.7636363636363637
2557288,5,B000FA57IU,"I saw the show in January 2005 in Chicago.  It was excellent!  I noticed Tyler made changes to the actors.  In Chicago Trina(?) Braxton was in the play as one of the guards, in the play she was not there.  The girl who played Vianne (I Can Do Bad All By Myself) was in the play but in the DVD Cheryl Pepsi Riley was in the play.

The play proved no one is above the law including Madea.  It showed how when a man found out that the child he was raising was not his, he loved the child that he wanted to adopt the child.  It showed how a mother will do anything to protect her children, including kill or be killed.  It also showed no matter how low you go God can bring you out.

Tyler outdid himself in the subject matter, actors and storyline.  There was never a dull moment in this play.  It is a must see for everyone.",1151712000,3,822,3.98159509202454

2557312,5,B000FA57IU,"We watched it last night.  We ended up watching it twice.  It is the best TP DVD we own in my opinion.  All the others are great and quite funny, but they seem to die out at the end.  This one kept up laughing all the way through.  The singing was great, the songs took us back to the 70's and 80's.

I believe there is a difference between not personally liking something and something being poorly done.  Whether or not people enjoy TP's work, I think we can agree that he is doing a great job.  I applaud him, he has accomplished something that many of us wish we could accomplish.",1151452800,3,584,4.151785714285714

2557314,5,B000FA57IU,"I have all of Mr. Perry's other plays.  They are somewhat repetitive.  But this one was refreshing.  Not the same recycled jokes.  You can only hear ""All my life I've had to fight..."" a couple of times before you get tired of the joke.

I like watching the movies with my 10 year old, because Madea says some of the things that I tell my son.  I'm sure he pays more attention to Madea than he does to me. :-)

I also usually fast forward through the singing (as a rule, I don't like musicals...).  Spiritual music is not my cup of tea, but I actually listened to a few of the songs this time, I especially enjoyed the medley with all of the cast.  This is the first time Mr. Perry actually sang an entire song.

I love love love this play!  Buy it today.  If you like his other plays, you will LOVE this one.  If you've never seen one of his plays, this is the one to get.",1151366400,2,872,4.029239766081871
2557315,5,B000FA57IU,"This play was really good! It was the first time I had seen a Tyler Perry production live at Newark Symphony Hall. Its so funny when he got out of character and Tyra Banks was the guest person at the end of the show. Tyler Perry is a great man of God putting real good quality back on television, so all you critics and haters need to leave him alone. I have his collection and its great to watch when your feeling down or when you need to be lifted up.",1151280000,3,453,3.989010989010989

2557318,5,B000FA57IU,"They won't let me out...Tyler delivers another phenomenal Madea hit. I absolutely love the spiritual messages that TP brings across in all of his plays. The leaves, branches and roots monologue that Madea gave was so touching, as well as her lifetime and seasons message. And how he brings comedy into such touching subjects by doing nothing more than telling it like it is, is amazing. I'm a fan for life and will continue to support all of his projects.",1150416000,6,455,4.7
