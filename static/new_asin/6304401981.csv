7871087,4,6304401981,"I was so happy to find this...even, granted, that it is a highly condensed version of the original TV serial (6 episodes of 50 min each compressed into 128 minutes). I, too, remember watching it on TV many years ago. The entire cast is wonderful, but Nino Manfredi's Geppetto is an especially memorable and touching performance by a great Italian actor.

However, be aware that while there are both Italian and  English-language soundtracks, if you want to hear the actors in their original Italian you'll have to do without subtitles--there are none on this DVD. Hence, the 4 stars instead of 5.",1228262400,5,596,4.833333333333333
7871088,3,6304401981,"I watched this as a kid and remember being so enthralled by it. This was a miniseries of 6 episodes around 50 minutes each so the total time should be around 300 minutes and not 135 minutes. This is why I gave it only 3...because of the truncated version, not on the miniserie per se.
This is far from the Disney version. This italian version is complex, full of amazing characters and all sorts of emotions emanating from it. Nino Manfredi is wonderful and Gina Lollobrigida playing the fairy godmother is gorgeous and full of mystery. The musical track is also great, and watching it again, really gave me chills and nostalgia. I'm really hoping that they will release the whole serie as it was intended because a bit of the masterpiece feel gets lost, and I believe that it is a masterpiece.",1215043200,8,794,4.559440559440559

I have been looking for this for many years now and remember part of it being in nearly black and white. It is very true to the book verison of the story, with Pinocchio nearly 'dieing' many times thanks to his bad habits, and his treatment as a donkey (along with his friend) being detailed as many years of hard labor. The little things, like the fact that he never ages, while his father and others do, and the Blue Fairy being like his mother but at the same time very human, add a tragic touch to the story. I always loved things such as his hat being made of bread and his clothing of paper in this verison.

It is for sure not the Disney verison, but that is a good thing,as the real story is made to be dark to teach children lessions. Although I well admit back in the day they were alot more hard on having kids obey their parents, but other lessions, like a couple of coins in the hand is worth 200 + in a tree, and think of your mother's feeling before you do something, is still true and good to know today.",1142812800,,1288,4.271604938271605
7871090,5,6304401981,"I think this movie is great. I know it is the original and Disney took it and watered it down. I have watched this movie since I was a child. I never knew of a disney Pinocchio until after the fact that I have watched the original. And once you have seen the original you would not bother with disney. It's more to the story,its more interesting. I have been looking for this movie for years now,and I actually found it,and can honestly say I would never be bothered with disney. The movie can be watched over and over again.",1060128000,,525,4.26
7871091,4,6304401981,"This is the same version of the most accurate animated version of the original tale of Collodi's  ""Adventures of Pinocchio"" that I saw in 1980. A little harsh compared to the 1940 Disney version, which was obviously sugared, but suitable for toddlers and true to the original tale, with the exception of omitted scenes replaced by ""frames"". Definitely recommended for collectors of the original story.",995500800,2,401,5.1692307692307695
7871092,5,6304401981,"When people watch movies like Jurassic Park, Congo, The Firm, etc., many claim, ""It's a good movie, but the book is better.""  Isn't that the case with most movies?  ""Always watch the movie before you read the book...you will be disappointed if you read it before watching it.""  Well, we all should attach this way of thinking to Pinocchio.  Originally written in the latter half of the 19th century, the book contained violence, deception, and trickery absent from our contemporary understanding of the sweet Pinocchio.  Yes, in this movie, he burns off his feet, he squishes the Talking Cricket, and he lets Geppetto go to jail.  But the same is true within the original book.  But why would Collodi, the author, write with such shocking imagery?  Maybe it's to show that little children can be mischievous, disrespectful, and unkind.  But the movie does not end with such a horrid picture of children, nor does the original story.  It ends in the exact same way as the Disney version.  He becomes a real boy, learning from his experiences and realizing his earlier mistakes...making a clearer distinction between the trickster and the good son than the Disney movie, .  Truly, this movie, accurately based on the original story, deserves much acclaim, at least for following the guidelines set by the creator of the story.  Squishing the Cricket (that conscience that always plagues us), disobeying our elders, and acting for only selfish reasons are all qualities that children go through during their development.  If we acknowledged this, we adults could perhaps shed our own wooden, stubborn shell, let our true self shine, and through example teach our children to do the same. Indeed, a great movie and lesson for all ages!",986774400,5,1731,4.965277777777778
