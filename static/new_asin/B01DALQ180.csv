8755353,3,B01DALQ180,"Rams is set in a secluded Icelandic valley where brothers Gummi (Sigurour Sigurjonsson) and Kiddi (Theodor Juliusson) live side by side and tend their sheep. Their sheep stock, of an ancient lineage, is regarded as one of the countrys best and the brothers repeatedly win awards for their prized rams. The brothers, however, have not spoken to each other in 40 years.

When a lethal disease suddenly infects Kiddis flock, all the herds in the valley come under threat of infection. The authorities decide to slaughter all the animals in the area to contain the outbreak, but this could result in financial ruin for the farmers, whose sheep are their main source of income. Many abandon the land. But Gummi and Kiddi persevere and each tries to prevent disaster in his own way  Kiddi by using his gun, Gummi by using his wits. As the authorities close in, the brothers must work together to save the special breed passed down for generations.

The movie shows how difficult shepherding is, especially as summer turns into winter. It doesnt address the cause of the brothers alienation from each other, but humorously illustrates the alternate, sometimes ingenious, means of communication they have devised. Director Grimur Hakonarson incorporates some slapstick sequences, but relies mostly on the performances of the two leads for laughs. Rams is an entertaining character study of two curmudgeons, too stubborn to work together until their livelihood is on the line.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include an interview with director Grimur Hakonarson; Wrestling, a short film by the director; and a theatrical trailer. The film is in Icelandic, with English subtitles.",1468022400,8,1677,5.154411764705882
8755354,3,B01DALQ180,"The front of the Bluray package for this Icelandic first-feature film quotes Joe Morgenstern, the film critic for the Wall Street Journal, as saying it is A Marvel of Deadpan Comedy. After watching the 93-minute film (in Icelandic with fairly easy to read English subtitles), I cant, in any way call this a comedy. There really is not one laugh here. But, thats not to say that the film is not good, or worth watching. Its just an alert for anyone looking for some laughs or a film that moves quickly. Im afraid they would be disappointed.

The plot is simple  and this really is not a spoiler (I hate those). Two brothers (Im guessing in their early 60s) share a sheep farm together, but for reasons (surprisingly) never revealed, they had a fight and have not talked to each other for 40 years! (They only communicate by sending paper messages via a dog!). One day an animal disease appears and affects all the shepherds. The health department orders ALL sheep in the area to be slaughtered. The two brothers have lost both their livelihoods. And that is where the story starts. How they relate to each other and deal with the situation forms the rest of the film. The Icelandic scenery is gorgeous and  for me  the highlight of the film. There is graphic nudity but its just of old naked men (I think there is only one female in the cast  in a small role). Yes, there is graphic sex but its between the sheep (no beastiality here).

If you are an animal lover, some of the scenes may be uncomfortable but otherwise there is nothing offensive here (Oh yes, a few expletives).
The bonuses include an earlier short (20 minute) film by the same director (also featuring two brothers) but it really bored me. And there is a 4 minute interview with the Director (in English), which honestly didn't tell me much about the film, except how it was to film the sheep scenes.

The package includes an 8 page booklet with the cast list, production credits and color photos. No essay.

Im glad that Cohen Film Group is releasing such recent foreign films (this from 2015) but, honestly, this one was too ambiguous  and slow-moving  for me.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
