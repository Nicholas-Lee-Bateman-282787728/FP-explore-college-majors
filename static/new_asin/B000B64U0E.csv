Mondo Cane (the one that started it all) and the 2 following films by Franco Prosperi and Gualtiero Jacopetti.  If you are looking for pure shock value. I would recommend Shockumentary Vol. 2.  However, if you appreciate some great exploitation and beautiful cinematography of events that happened around the world with a an offbeat sense of humor you will enjoy this. I personally enjoy Vol. 2 more, but this is classic cinema regardless.",1297209600,5,573,4.747474747474747
8082312,1,B000B64U0E,"Do not buy this item! It sucks! I bought Mondo Magic, and it was crazy wild real interesting and really shocking. But this package is terrible I could barely watch it, not because it was sickening but because it was so stupid and boring.

I give this negative a million stars.",1193097600,6,276,4.411764705882353
