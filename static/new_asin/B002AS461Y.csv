3891194,5,B002AS461Y,"The National Geographic Society research on the Genographic Project is a genetic analysis of the human species origin in Africa and its spread throughout the world. Using samples, the lab results tell a story of the many branchings of the human tree. From the mitochondrial DNA, the researchers found that everyone in the world descends from one women in Africa some 150,000 to 200,000 years ago, while using the Y-chromosome they found we all descend from one man some 70,000 years ago. Mutations created branches through time in both areas and these are used to show the basic migration routes for the people, through their genes.

That these branches happened appears to be well researched. However, the researchers give approximate dates for these events and that is an area open to question. Is it really 150,000 or is it 1.5 million years ago for the scientific ""Eve""? One issue glossed over is that the genetic evidence is not matching well with the archaeological and human paleontological data. For example, the genetic data showed a date of 15-20,000 years ago for the peopling of the New World and assumes that Clovis people were the first. How then are the dozens of well-dated sites in South America from 30,000+ years going to fit the genetic model. One statement was potentially wrong, when they said that Native Americans were isolated until Columbus. This negates the Viking settlement in Labrador, Canada, as well as possible contact with Chinese. The Eskimo and Aleut who came later to America are also not included.

Another issue that needs to be discussed better in this film is that Europe and Asia were well occupied about a million years ago, and that genetic links between Homo erectus fossils in China and modern Asians exist in their shovel-shaped incisors. Similarly, some of the Java Homo erectus specimens show traits still found there. Clearly, those populations today have some ancestors who did not migrate out of Africa some 70,000 years ago. Researchers also are still debating if Neanderthals left their genes in us.

Going back to 150,000 years ago and assuming 25 years per generation, each of us had 2 to the 6000th power ancestral lines in our massive genealogy. (Two to the 30th power is a billion!) This film portrays only two of those lines.

The film is well worth seeing. However, in many ways it contains the fallacy of extrapolation because it looks only at those two lines. Nevertheless, an important point made repeatedly in the film is that we are all cousins in the human family and that research on the great chain of being is worthwhile. I ordered my kit today from National Geographic.",1251849600,160,2640,4.899328859060403

3891223,5,B002AS461Y,"Before you watch this video, you need to first watch the Journey of Man.  Spencer Wells, the Anthropologist and Biologist, did the seminal study and traveled the world taking DNA samples and discovered something that was mind blowing.  Every one of us has one common grandfather.  He was a member of a relatively small band of the last Homo Sapiens (us) as we faced our extinction as a species.  It was a close thing with our numbers in the low thousands, but we share the genetic marker of only one man from that group of the last people.  For all intents and purposes, he was Adam.  No other male in that group of four to five thousand people in the Kalahari Desert Basin (one of only five deep basins on the entire planet) that warm sanctuary gave birth of any surviving males.

I don't know if you believe in hand of God power, but at least over a thousand other males had no surviving male children. Adam and his people lived 58,000 years ago.  The Great Die Off occurred in 50,000 BC some six thousand years after Adam people's survived the killing cold of the last great ice age and it was a fifty percent extinction event.  Half of all the flora and fauna died off, but we made it!  Well's video showed how he got the idea for his genetic study from his mentor at Stanford, and then he takes you from Africa to India, briefly to Australia, then to Kamchatka, and finally to Canyon de Chelly (pronounced Shay) in Arizona.  The book is very dry, but the DVD is fascinating.  It will help you make more sense of the Human Family with the necessary background of what Wells discovered in 1999.",1436227200,,1597,4.412969283276451
3891224,5,B002AS461Y,"Great follow-up to ""The Journey of Man"". This intensified my desire to test my family and friends to find out where the DNA would say they are from.

3891276,5,B002AS461Y,"This video will change the way you see ""Race"" on our planet! My World History students are shocked to discover that race is a socially constructed idea that has no scientific basis.  Even more shocking is that all humans on the planet are distantly related to each other. I use this as the main thesis statement for world history class.  The misunderstanding of the work race is the single largest cause of wars genocide and human rights violations in world history. It has been used to justify everthing from slavery to colonization and world wars. I can recommend this video enough.  If you are a teacher and would like a lesson to go with the video please email me at chandler_archibald@rdale.org and I will help you out.

I am just now taking required Freshman Biology in my last semester to graduate.  Couldn't put it off any longer - that's how much I hate biology.  This documentary was absolutley AMAZING and oh, so very interesting.  I highly HIGHLY recommend it for any and everyone; in fact, I had my sons and their wives come over for a mini-dinner the next day to watch it, that's how fascinated I was by this movie.  They thoroughly enjoyed it also. Not your typical boring documentary. This one will definitely hold your attention and peak your curiosity. A MUST SEE.",1345766400,,653,4.734513274336283
3891338,2,B002AS461Y,"It was interesting, I mean its no surprise that its started in Africa. The Bible gives so many clues on this and it was written so long ago. Its too bad the guy in the documentary believes evolutional theories which are man made guesses. There were different races in Africa before they left to go east.  Its all in the Bible!! Yes, I definetly believe it started in Northern Africa and later some moved to out to go Europe and the middle East. I'm sure they were curious. Maybe there was drought and famine or war that made some move. Anyways blacks, whites arabs, etc were screwing each other before and after they left Africa Why do you think Italians and Greeks  are dark skin and have curly hair, because they are mixed with arab and black blood. Why do some dark Northern Africans have pointy noses and thin lips because blacks and arabs have been screwing each other for years and years. Autralian aboriginees have a mix of black and arab blood. Curly hair is a black trait. blacks are the only race without straight hair. When they mix with non blacks, the mixed child has curly hair, but most of the time , it is very loose or wavy and the mixed person's descendents or any race end up with curly hair. But it is no surprise. We are all distant relatives. the more you go back in time the less people there were until there was adam and eve. No people noses and eyes shapes and hair tecture and eye color didn't miraculously change because of the climate.(skin color differences is from the sun)God created different races. The answers are found in the Bible.",1334102400,2,1568,4.45993031358885
3891339,4,B002AS461Y,"Fantastic Film. Appears to be well researched. While I did find the theories expounded and broad sweeping generalizations open to debate.  The Human Family Tree is well worth the view. The National Geographic appears to be making some dramatic headway in its research on DNA; isolating specific DNA strands, microsatellites.  I think it is encouraging.
The Academy of Sciences, Biology as well as most funded educational universities have been funded by organizations linked directly to ""Scientific Racism (Rockefeller, etc) for much too long.  Much of this funding was aimed at dispelling any truthful investigation into Africa and humanity.  The National Geographic did a wonderful job covering this issue.

This said, I find most documentaries provide only a superficial ""Out of Africa"" theory, while intelligently insinuating the underdevelopment of ""Subsahara Africa"" with a proclivity of endorsing the racialized view of modern evolution as being represented in all of it's glory, as the paradigm of excellence of Anglo Western modernity.  We instead get a ""fairer"" picture of humans not too different from ourselves, in exploration of the land, challenging themselves and their environment, and trying to meet the basic demands of life and security.
However politiocal and the social order of the day would like to reframe this issue.  The truth is undeniable.
Africa is home to the World.  Social constructs like France, Spain, America are terms that did not exist ages ago.

The truth is that Europe is just 15 miles from Africa. Somehow scientist missed this.  It is walking distance, and if you think that Africans never ""migrated"" into these regions, please rremmebr that africa is a continent, not a country.
Europe itself is an African word, much like the haplotypes which are merely types of African DNA.  Hemoglobin is simply Hamoglobin... From which all humans derive their genetic Homogenus origin.  We are all apart of the Human race or shall I say the Hamon race...

Great documentary but with faults....  Scientific Racism is still cleverly hidden in the subtext and again the, heavy faulty assumption that demarcation lines that exist today, existed yesterday, with no visible impacts of minor & major migrations, or wars, or small intercinary conflicts which inevitably infuse the populace with new so called foreign DNA, is again...faulty reasoning imbued with agenda. All these ideas and the continued but implicit references to people as being black and white (which are colors not races) does lend this film to the archive of ""old age"" thinking, political innuendo and agenda based television ""programming"" most of us have outgrown. When the smoke clears it seems its always about protectign that sacred part of Scientific Racism proposed and that is the uniquness and difference of a supposed ""white gene"". Whther black, brown  or white or yellow skin ...We are one people.  This documentary echoes that sentiment but all while confering superiority  to ""modern"" humans. As if a black cat or white cat is superior because of it's color or modernity.
That said.. I would recommend this documentary and encourage others to take a more proactive stance of critical thinking, remembering that for each parent there are 4 grandparents, brothers & sisters that will marry and as the family tree grows in branches like the sands on the beach of a seashore, the numbers are incalculable.  And therefore impossible to define within language or any contruct the concept of race...

They are us and we are them...
