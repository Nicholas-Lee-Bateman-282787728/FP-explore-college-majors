2213339,5,B0007IO7BI,"The Cardiff Singer of the Year (1989) has become The Singer of his generation.  I had to have this video after seeing the great Dmitri in ""the role he was born to play"" (NYTimes), Eugene Onegin, as transmitted live into theaters.

His voice is astounding in this program of relatively simple songs....resonate, expressive, effortless, deep and moving, equal to his Onegin.  Similarly, watching this famously handsome, charming artist as he brings these songs to life doubles or triples the impact.",1183680000,9,497,5.1875
2213340,5,B0007IO7BI,"I have been a fan of Dmitri for some time and was fortunate to see him live in Sydney, Australia twice in one year and hope that one day he will return again. This DVD is a marvellous concert performed in the Kremlin with a great orchestra and combined choir. As always Dmitri charms the audience with his truely sparkling voice and flashing smile. He is amongst his countrymen here and the camera focusses on the many people young and old in the audience who are smiling, clapping, cheering and often reduced to tears by his singing.

The DVD is based on his popular CD of war songs, many are based a waltz them and all Russians know them. a personal favorite of mine is the Cranes, which was written in the 1970's 30 years after WWII. Few today in the west can appreciate the tremendous losses experienced by the then USSR and that without the Russian front we would all now be speaking either German or Japanese. The people of all the Russias remember their losses and are justifiably proud of their country and fallen comrades. Once again through his singing Dimtri is educating the west on the variety, beauty and charm that is Russian vocal music.

Perhaps one day we will see a perfomance of the three Russians with Dimitri, the tenor Nicolai Baskov (the golden voice of Russia) and perhaps the St Petersburg or Alexandrov (Red Army) Choirs. That would be the concert of the century.

As we say in Australia, do yourself a favour and buy this DVD you won't be disappointed.",1180310400,11,1480,4.556390977443609
2213341,5,B0007IO7BI,"I have three Dmitri Hvorostovsky's recordings: portrait, verdi arias, and this one, and this one stands out the most to me. He has a very rich, beautiful voice, and you can feel his emotion when his voice comes out. He really feels the music VERY deeply, much more than the verdi works and other arias I think. The music itself is not about beautiful romance or love, fairy tales stories like most opera storylines, it really has a very strong picture of world war II time and Dmitri's singing 100% successfully make these scenes even stronger. It consists of tears, blood, flesh, loves and relationships between family, lovers, friends, etc. For example, the first piece ""Soldiers are coming"" really have a picture of an army walking through fields to the war, all soldiers are thinking of their families or lovers, and they have a very strong will to defeat the enemies in order to go back home. So do other pieces. Plus Dmitri's stage performance also very good, especially his singing posture, young vocalists I think should learn more from him. The choir is also excellent, they do not let Dmitri ""steal all the fun"" too. It definitely worth ur money to buy this DVD, and it is a very good way get to know more about Russian music.",1164758400,8,1236,4.648401826484018
2213342,5,B0007IO7BI,"I attended a performance by Dmitri Hvorostovsky at Davis

Symphony Hall on Sunday, January 22, 2006.  His program

was in two parts - Part One: Arias from Russian operas and

Part Two: Songs from Where Are You, My Brothers?

I was so impressed with the songs from ""Where Are you, My

Brothers?,"" that I knew that I had to buy the DVD.  I also

brought his CD ""Passione di Napoli.""

I have been very fortunate to see Mr. Hvorostovsky in all

his operatic performances with the San Francisco Opera

Compnay.  In my opinion he is one of the major singers

that is currently singing before the public. He has been

blessed with a truly beautiful voice. To me the human voice

is the most beautiful instrument in the world.  His also

has stage presence-along with his good looks.  A great singer!",1142726400,10,792,4.49645390070922
2213343,5,B0007IO7BI,"This dvd is very different from most recitals. Hvorostovsky's grandfather was killed during the war, known as the Great Patriotic War in Russia, known to us as WWII.  It is apparent that he feels these songs deeply, as does the audience.  These songs are well-known in Russia, and virtually unknown to those of us in the West.  They are heartbreakingly beautiful, especially ""The Cranes"".  Dmitri sings them with great feeling,

and does not sing them in an operatic voice, he croons them.  The dvd is well worth hearing, both for the novelty of new repetoire for us, and the gorgeous tone Hvorostovsky produces.",1140652800,9,612,4.893203883495145
2213344,5,B0007IO7BI,"The reviewers here are right on about the quality of this concert.  Having just seen it in Los Angeles 1/15/06, I can tell you that 3,000 people teared up and crushed the Opera Shop to buy the DVD and CD's for Dmitri to autograph.  I've just ordered this so haven't viewed it yet but in person, these songs were most effectively performed and Dmitri astonishes with his communicative ability.  Just when you think he can't sing any better, he does!  He certainly has it all!  These songs are beautiful and he does them to perfection.  No one should be without this DVD and a CD of them if possible.  FIRST RATE!!  GREAT MUSIC!!  GREAT VOICE!! GREAT PERFORMANCE!!",1137542400,10,662,4.589743589743589
2213345,5,B0007IO7BI,"I completely agree with the other reviewers regarding this DVD of a concert of Russian War Songs sung by Dmitri Hvorostovsky.  What a moving concert!  Dmitri sings these songs wonderfully grabbing emotionally this listener and the audience ""by the throat""! I own the CD ""Songs of War Years"" with Hvorostovsky singing these same songs; his singing on the CD also moves me very much. However, seeing and hearing him before an audience (most in tears) comprising of, I'm sure, individuals that these songs have a very special and profound meaning to (WWII, after all, was fought in Russia's front and backyards) is an experience not to be soon forgotten.  This DVD puts me right in the audience.  Thus, I too was moved to tears often.

 This is NOT an operatic concert.  Dmitri sings most of the songs in a movingly beautiful mezza-voce only allowing his voice ""full out"" a couple of times on the more militaristic songs-that was, of course, very thrilling!  What control!  He truly posses one of the most beautiful baritone voices I've ever heard!

 The audience gave him many standing ovations and many bouquets of flowers during the entire concert eliciting, from him, that gorgeous smile of his.

 For an emotional and moving concert of beautiful songs, buy this DVD.",1120521600,32,1268,4.896713615023474
2213346,5,B0007IO7BI,"They are not Tchaikovsky; they are not Verdi; they are not Rachmaninoff; but these Songs of War Years have no short of dramatic power, nor less sentimentality! In his home country, backed by Moscow Chamber Orchestra and Spiritual Revival Choir of Russia, along with Russian folk instrument ensemble ""Style of Five"", baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky created great sensation in his 2003 Concert from Moscow, in retrospect the years of WWII in Russia. Retrospective the songs are, they reflect part of the culture during the Soviets era. The popularity of the songs even to this day in Russia and the immense effectiveness when sung by Hvorostovsky's deep, intoxicating voice is sensational. There is no caption of the lyrics showing on the screen - you can find the lyrics and their English translations in the booklet that comes with the DVD. But in the end you'd find the caption unnecessary. The sentiments directly come from the heart - through Hvorostovsky's expressive singing, and through the emotions from the audience, many with tears in their eyes. Although sitting in front of TV screen, I was also in tears, as well as in awe!

The content of this DVD is only the second half of the concert - in the first half Hvorostovsky sang Tchaikovsky, Rubinstein, and Leoncavallo. Cutting anything from Hvorostovsky's concert would be regretful, however, what we've seen here is a complete show, with the distinctive colors of its own. The songs from the DVD can be found in Hvorostovsky's CD ""Where Are You, My Brothers"", which is a studio recording released in 2002.",1118275200,16,1564,4.992337164750958
2213347,5,B0007IO7BI,"Dmitri Hvorostovsky is overwhelming in this concert of war era songs, taken mostly from WWII, that Hvorostovsky interprets with such subtle intensity that one doesn't have to know the meaning of the words. The sound alone tells the story, and one finds the tears rolling down one's cheeks from the sheer beauty of it.
Hvorostovsky is one of the greatest baritones in operatic history, and has been Russia's gift to the world, as well as being one of its best ambassadors, bringing Russian music to a wide audience. From the song cycles of Georgi Sviridov, to the rousing folk songs, to the melodic, moving pieces in this concert, finer renditions cannot be found.

Set in the 6,500 seat concert hall of the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow, on April 8, 2003, Hvorostovsky stands in front of the orchestra and chorus in a black suit and open white shirt. The camera often focuses on his expressive face, which occasionally breaks into a smile that would melt the winter snow in Krasnoyarsk, the Siberian city that was his birthplace in 1962. There are occasional views of the tearful audience, and moments when they bring him flowers, which he accepts and places center stage.
Whether one sits and watches this astonishing singer, or just listens to his dark, rich voice, this DVD is a treasure for anyone who likes Russian music, or appreciates the best of all possible voices.

Constantine Orbelian is an award winning pianist and conductor, and has worked extensively with Hvorostovsy.  Born in San Francisco, he is the only foreign artist to be awarded the title ""Honored Artist of Russia"", and here leads the Moscow Chamber Orchestra; also included in this program are the Style of Five Ensemble, the Yale Alumni Chorus, and the Spiritual Revival Choir.
Total running time is 59 minutes. There are no subtitles but the name of the song and composer are briefly put on the screen.
There is a booklet enclosure with short bios and text of the songs in English and transliterated Russian.
The song list: 1: ""Soldiers are Coming"", 2: ""Dark is the Night"", 3: ""Unexpected Waltz"", 4: ""The Roads"", 5: ""On a Nameless Hill"", 6: ""Somewhere far Away"", 7: ""Katyusha"", 8: ""The Hills of Manchuria"", 9: ""The Sacred Stone"", 10: ""The Lonely Accordion"", 11: ""Cranes"", 12: ""The Last Battle"", 13: ""My Moscow"".",1117238400,40,2290,4.866666666666666
2213348,5,B0007IO7BI,"I'm not given to hyperbole, but this DVD truly is incredible.  It's taken from a live concert given by Dmitri Hvorosovsky in Russia, and he is in superb voice.  Not only that, he's also on top form when it comes to communicating with his audience, and clearly feels deeply and passionately about every one of these songs.  As the concert progresses, the audience become almost as much a part of the performance as Hvorostovsky, and the atmosphere is so good that it makes you wish you could have been there. Watching some of the older members of the audience weep brought a lump to my throat. It must have been a night to remember for the rest of your life.  If you can only buy one of this brilliant baritone's DVDs, then I'd recommend this one.  There aren't any subtitles, but there is a booklet which gives you the words, and to be honest Hvorostovsky is so expressive that you get the feel of them anyway.  This is an artist who appears to be going from strength to strength, and this is a DVD which demonstrates that fact brilliantly.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed!",1111190400,18,1076,4.487179487179487

8047601,5,B0007IO7BI,"Dmitri Hvorostovky has a beautiful baritone instrument and, coupled with Russian music, is simply unbeatable. To me, Russian and Italian music go hand in hand.  Glorious melodies...and when sung by a glorious voice makes for an enjoyable experience.
""The Hills of Manchuria"" drew me to this DVD and I would have bought it even if it were the only song in the allbum, but the rest of the music is an added bonus for me.  Exceptional.
