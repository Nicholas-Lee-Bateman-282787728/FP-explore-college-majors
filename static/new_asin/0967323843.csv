7793968,5,0967323843,"This DVD shows what is described on the book Contact: Countdown to transformation, and is not supposed to be a stand-alone DVD.
The DVD comes for free when you buy the book from Disclosure Project's official website.

If you buy this DVD alone you won't like it because it's just a bunch of videos and sounds of ET contact, and since the it's supposed to be seen after the book is read or as you read it.",1284508800,18,404,4.246753246753247
7793969,1,0967323843,"I experience being misled by what was written and what was offered in this DVD. It was extremely short and it had no real information, just some video of lights that were identified as et's. The disappointment comes also from admiring Steven Greer and his writings.",1273795200,6,265,4.782608695652174
