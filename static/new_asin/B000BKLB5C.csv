8087939,4,B000BKLB5C,"I'm usually not too keen on spaghetti western comedies. The two Trinity films give me slight chuckles but that's about it (The Three Muskeeters of the West comes to mind as one of the worst spaghetti western comedies). I usually like my spaghetti's dark, dirty, and atmospheric. Despite my usual loathing of spaghetti western comedy's I decided to give Ben and Charlie a shot because I have been impressed with most of Wild East's other efforts.

To my surprise I actually liked it quit a bit. First of all the production value is very good. Most of other spaghetti western comedies I've seen have very cheap production values (even the Trinity films to an extent) so I was pleasantly surprised. I was also surprised at the chemistry between Giuliano Gemma and George Eastman. They really play off each other well. Maybe not as classic as Terence Hill or Bud Spencer but close.

Wild East's transfer is as usual tops for these obscure spaghetti's. Sadly it's not anamorphic but it's an old disc and that's forgivable. Extra's include the alternate opening credits with a different song and theatrical trailers.

All-in-all if you like the Trinity films then this film is for you. Also if you're a spaghetti western fan in general than this is worth checking out.",1241568000,5,1262,4.833333333333333
