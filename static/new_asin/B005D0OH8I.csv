4655437,1,B005D0OH8I,"If you are expecting to see comedy by Ron White, think again!  There is only about 10 minutes of Ron at the beginning of the DVD.  The rest of the DVD is other comedians that are not funny at all! Plus, there is a few singers doing a couple of songs along with Ron White's singing song-writer wife? It was all very disappointing.",1318636800,6,329,4.2063492063492065

If you want a mix of comedians such as Alex Ramundo, Kathlien Madegan, Lewis Black along with a number of others hosted by Ron White, than by all means get this DVD",1372809600,,369,4.068493150684931

4655491,5,B005D0OH8I,Ron White is a screem. He is so casual when he is doing his act. I just saw he in person last year and just love him.,1358899200,,117,3.3703703703703702

Sent his back, kept my copy. Do be advised - if you want the clean version, record it off CMT.",1340496000,,281,4.035714285714286

4655495,5,B005D0OH8I,"I have been a Ron White fan for years now and when I heard he had a special where all the proceeds go to benefit the Armed Forces-- I promptly ordered 5 copies and have given to family and friends as gifts!!  Not only is Ron one of the funniest comedians out there, he's now one of the most generous!  If you enjoy a great laugh and want to be patriotic, BUY Ron's Salute to the Troops!!",1318896000,,387,4.012987012987013
4655496,5,B005D0OH8I,"I originally bought this DVD because I heard Ron White interviewed on the radio and he mentioned that all proceeds benefit the armed forces foundation.  I thought, what the heck, I'll do my part and have a few laughs.  Now that I actually bought the DVD I'm thrilled to say that I would have bought this without the knowledge of knowing that I'm helping out the Armed Forces Foundation.  Ron is hilarious as always and the other comedians had me howling as well.  Love the special music guests too!  Keep it coming tater salad!",1318896000,6,527,4.5638297872340425

8466158,5,B005D0OH8I,"I've watched all five of these annual events and love every one of them. This DVD is from the first show; I wish the others were available on DVD, too -- I'd buy them all. If you've seen this one on TV, the DVD includes additional footage of each comedian, plus several musical performances, including by John Oates (of Hall & Oates) and Margo Rey, Ron White's wife (great performance).",1434672000,2,386,4.5285714285714285
