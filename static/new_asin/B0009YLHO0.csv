2343294,3,B0009YLHO0,"This is a rare filming from the blond ambition tour. Not as good as the other ones on laser disc. But this is a must have. If you like rare items, so this one is for you. Enjoy it!",1397088000,,180,3.641025641025641
2343295,1,B0009YLHO0,"Really bad quality not what I wanted or expected, very dark and sounds like commentary ....... So Overall not good.",1392681600,,115,4.8
2343296,1,B0009YLHO0,"It was not the best quality. The music was muffled, and it wasn't a great quality filming. I saw it on HBO, years ago. I was hoping for that kind of quality. However, I was thrilled to get it though. I wanted to share it with people, because it was a good concert, but this wasn't the same quality. The one person I showed it to, wasn't impressed either. They commented on the muffled sound, and the poor filming as well... At least I can say I have it though. I may try to find another copy from HBO somehow.",1391212800,,509,4.1
2343297,1,B0009YLHO0,"What a waste of money, this is beyond the worst quality product ever. This looks like some crap low-resolution  upload you'd find on youtube. The sound quality is atrocious. The overall product looks like they used a camcorder and recorded this from the T.V. This product would get ZERO starts if Amazon gave me the option.",1390262400,3,323,4.767857142857143
2343298,5,B0009YLHO0,If your are a die hard fan of madonna or the blond ambition tour then you have to own this. The sound isn't the best but non the less this is the closest thing that were gonna get to an official release of the blond ambition tour on DVD for a while.,1385942400,,249,3.8076923076923075
2343299,1,B0009YLHO0,"I like other reviewers was excited to see this item. After receiving it, it's just painful to look at. The sound quality is positively awful. The video quality is muted and even suspicious. The seller claims this is not a bootleg but a legal copy. I don't believe Madonna's business team would ever sanction such an 'official' product. Further, I imagine they would be as angry as I was to find such a low quality item is even available.
To would be buyers, I assure you your memories of this concert video will far surpass the reality of this poor substitute.",1382832000,5,560,4.554455445544554
2343300,1,B0009YLHO0,"I have received my DVD today, when i tried to load it, it didn't work / play at all. It was totally different from the website i saw, it was a copy of the disc, it was not the original dvd. I paid for $23 for a defective copy. It's not right. I felt like i have been deceived.",1376265600,,276,3.694915254237288
2343301,5,B0009YLHO0,After reading the sound issue with the dvd I ordered this on laserdisc. The sound was just fine & the picture looked great. The laserdisc was made by Pioneer artists I have no idea what master was used for the dvd.,1374192000,,214,4.2439024390243905
2343302,2,B0009YLHO0,"I Always wanted this DVD. As soon as I got it, start watching...but very dissapointed. Very bad quality in sound and image! Do not recomend at all!
Can't return it because I'm in Colombia :(",1369440000,3,190,4.457142857142857
2343303,1,B0009YLHO0,"It was a VERY BAD, copy to say the least.  I was very dis appointed, after waiting so long to get it. :((",1367798400,2,105,3.5652173913043477
2343304,3,B0009YLHO0,"The video quality on this DVD is very good, however I must say that the sound quality is not, but at least I was able to acquire a great concert.",1362614400,,145,3.8666666666666667
2343305,2,B0009YLHO0,The video was OK.  But the sound was horrible.  Sound it like it was recorded using a smartphone during concert.,1360022400,11,112,4.55
2343306,1,B0009YLHO0,I was excited to see this being offered on Amazon. This is definitely not an original recording and the sound is almost non existent. The video quality is bad as well. It looks as if someone took a cellphone and recorded it while watching it on HBO. Save your time and money! I threw mine away!,1354320000,14,294,4.267857142857143
2343307,2,B0009YLHO0,Video quality a great.. But sound is too low . It's sounds like it was recorded from another tv and not from an original recording,1334620800,12,130,4.24
2343308,5,B0009YLHO0,finally on DVD!!!  loved the 2 disc set (live in japan and france) -- such amazing picture and sound!! full packaging and cool disc. worth every penny ( i would have paid more) --,1290556800,,179,4.264705882352941
2343309,5,B0009YLHO0,"It really is a crime that 20 since the launch of the legendary Blond Ambition tour (arguably the greatest pop concert in music history), it has yet to be released on DVD anywhere in the world. In fact, it was never given a proper VHS release anywhere outside Japan. In the USA, it was only released as a laserdisc, a now defunct format in every corner of the world. The reason for this was because Pioneer electronics was trying to push sales of laserdisc players by offering exclusive titles, and since they were sponsoring Madonna's tour, Blond Ambition became one of those titles in an exclusive deal. I remember reading in ICON (Madonna's official fan club magazine) that Warner Bros records actually had the option of releasing the tour on VHS only after 1991 when Pioneer's exclusive deal expired. Unfortunately, that never happened. (another fun fact from ICON: Originally, the USA laserdisc was to include a compilation of ""world footage"" of the tour, maybe that's why so many pro shots for Blond Ambition exist (Japan, France, Spain, Houston TX..). But Madonna's manager at the time, Freddy Demann ultimately decided that the Nice, France show was the better of all of them and decided to release that one.)

So, there is absolutely no way to get this tour on DVD except for bootlegs. I have had VHS transfers of the Japan and France show for years, with horrible sound. Last week, I saw the amazon listing from Babylon Mall (an outside vendor), and I was a little cautious but the reviews didn't seem too bad. Well, I have viewed the DVD and the quality is VERY good!  The Japanese DVD looks like it was taken from the original Japanese laserdisc. Definitely the next best thing to an official release. I recommend it, now I will buy the France concert DVD from them, and if that one is as good, I think I'll also buy the Spain concert to have all 3 pro shots. I definitely recommend buying from them if you're a Madonna fan and want to have this concert, or to any music fan in general. I will say, though, that the cover art was very generic, but that really means squat to me as long as I have the DVD. I could make my own cover art if I wanted to.

Update: I just received the France DVD, and the quality on this one is pretty decent too. Now, keep in mind that we are not going to get DVD/Super Hi Def quality anytime soon so these bootlegs are more than adequate and totally viewable. very satisfied with my purchases!",1264809600,9,2434,4.5147392290249435
2343310,5,B0009YLHO0,I love this concert it is one of the Best of Madonna's career and I'm so happy to own it now!! This concert is totally worth it cause I doubt it will ever see the light of day!!,1263427200,,177,3.6842105263157894
2343311,5,B0009YLHO0,Until a professional version is released it's cool to be able to have this at all! Madonna Rocks!,1256860800,,97,4.444444444444445
2343312,3,B0009YLHO0,"ordered this tour thinking it was the original not knowing it was copied from the original...paided alot of money for a copy. very unsatisfied! If people place items on this site to sell they should be correct in the information and not FIB/LIE. You can tell right away by viewing it it is a copy, and they claim it is the original on site...very dissappointing!",1256515200,2,362,4.584615384615384
2343313,1,B0009YLHO0,"I am quite surprised to see this item as Madonna's Blond Ambition Tour was never released on DVD, only on LD (The obsolete format now). The copy you had bought was probably copied from the LD, it is not a DVD-R copy from the original. So other buyers please don't purchase any DVD of the Blond Ambition Tour. This item is in the wish list for millions of Madonna fans around the world. It is frustrating that the Blue-Ray format will soon put DVD in the obsolete bin and we are still waiting for the DVD for one of the best concert of all time from any performer, if not from Madonna herself. Madonna should skip the DVD and go straight to the Blue Ray disc format; I sample movies re-mastered for the new format and the quality is incredible! Richard",1250553600,10,751,4.333333333333333

8070589,2,B0009YLHO0,"This was a waste of money as the picture and sound quality was just awful. This copy appears to have been video taped using a camcorder aimed at a TV screen. Just awful. I was disappointed. I got this item from a ""Good Will"" seller. I did not return it because I did not want another person to get this awful item, so as a good deed, I trashed it. I just consider that the wasted money spent was just a donation to ""Good Will"" Industries, an organization that I support for all the good work that they do.",1461024000,,505,4.111111111111111
