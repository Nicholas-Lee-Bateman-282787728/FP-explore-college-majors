2963388,5,B000W8OMA4,"Most of what you see in movies or the news regarding airliners is bogus. As an airline captain with a couple of thousand hours in the 737, I was very impressed with the technical accuracy of this movie. There is some very nice film from the cockpit in flight. If you are an airplane watcher, you might enjoy this movie strictly for some of the photography.

The real point of the whole film is how a corporate culture and government oversight or lack thereof can affect safety. Specifically, the lesson is about aviation. However, the lesson is more generally applicable to any technical field such as drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico. As a bit of encouragement for you fearful flyers, there are many airlines that take safety seriously and realize the importance of a safety culture.

There was a little drama and romance thrown in. This isn't a strict documentary and I enjoyed the dramatic part. Even though the movie is in Spanish with English subtitles and I speak no Spanish, I found myself engrossed.",1277596800,,1013,4.685393258426966
2963389,5,B000W8OMA4,"""Whisky Romeo Zulu"" is the partial designation of a Boeing 737 that entered history as the vehicle for the worst aviation disaster in Argentine history.  Sixty-five souls were lost on August 31, 1999 when LAPA flight 3142 ended in a fiery crash during an aborted take off.  This semi-documentary is the riveting and frightening story of events that led up to the accident.

The writer, director, producer and star of the film is Enrique Pieyro, who worked for eleven years as a pilot for LAPA and had resigned just two months prior to the accident.  Actually, he was forced out because he was a troublemaker; he insisted that planes he flew be in good working order with safety and maintenance inspections completed.  That kind of bad attitude cost the company money.  As a start up, low cost domestic carrier, LAPA felt they couldn't afford such niceties and frills.

Recently promoted to Captain, Pieyro reports and logs a variety of incidents and infractions with his flights.  He is told by his superiors that he is damaging the company.  He is told the regulations are overly strict and everything will be fine.  They say that instead of logging problems with the aircraft, he should just write them on a napkin and hand them to someone in maintenance.

There are plenty of shocking moments in the film.  For example, during one preflight inspection, Pieyro discovers an empty fire extinguisher and demands a replacement.  The maintenance crew member tells him it has been empty for a week already and there are no replacements...big deal.  Pieyro insists that he will not fly without a working fire extinguisher.  Another maintenance crew member takes the empty extinguisher and says he will take care of it.  He steps outside the plane and, unobserved by the flight crew, makes an adjustment to the valve so that the extinguisher now appears full.  He then takes the doctored canister back on the plane and returns it to the captain, who believes he now has a working fire extinguisher.  In another chilling moment, Pieyro and his co-pilot are doing a cross check and discover at least three things wrong with the plane which, according to the company's own manual, make the aircraft unsafe for a night flight.  Pieyro makes the decision to ground the craft until the issues are resolved. As he and the co-pilot are walking away from the plane, they cross paths with another pilot and co-pilot who will be making that flight in their place.  Instead of replacing the defective equipment, the company merely replaced the troublesome pilot.  It's much more efficient for the bottom line.

Pieyro is low-key but powerful.  He's in constant need of a hair cut and a shave, but he knows his way around a plane, and he knows how to tell a story.  Alejandro Polledo is quite strong as the District Attorney assigned to investigate the crash to determine whether criminal charges should be brought against the airline.

The movie is in Spanish with some cockpit and tower talk in English.  The DVD includes English subtitles, scene selection, and a theatrical trailer.

Highly recommended.",1235433600,7,3088,4.888461538461539
2963390,4,B000W8OMA4,"""Whisky Romeo Zulu"" is an excellent drama, based  on the events that led to a terrible airline accident in Argentina, on August 31, 1999. In that day,  LAPA (Lneas Areas Privadas Argentinas) flight 3142 crashed and caught fire, killing instantly 65 people and injuring 17.

The title of this movie has to do with NATO's phonetic alphabet version of the identifier of the airplane, LV-WRZ, that is, Lima Victor - Whisky Romeo Zulu. ""Whisky Romeo Zulu"" was directed by Enrique Pieyro, who drew on his own experience as a LAPA pilot in order to make it. Pieyro plays a man that does pretty much what he did, a Cassandra-like character that says true things nobody wants to hear. Pieyro was employed by LAPA from 1988 to 1999, when he resigned two months prior to the accident, due to the fact that nobody paid attention to him when he complained about LAPA's nonexistent safety policy.

Pieyro said that ""I was personally interested in recounting how the accident came to occur, not the fact that the pilots forgot about the flaps and the plane blew up, but why they forgot the flaps. And what was the process, because forgetting the flaps was the straw that broke the camel's back in a series of tremendous violations of regulations. I was interested in portraying what isn't apparent about the accident, not just the final link (the pilot). Because all the links that came before were conveniently hidden because they compromised the establishment, the business."" I think that, in making this film, he succeeded in that purpose.

8221632,5,B000W8OMA4,If you are at all interested in aviation and the safety that should interest anyone who flies this is a excellent accounting of what can happen when a company is lax in its maintenance and pushing its pilots into unsafe situations all for the bottom line of profits.,1359331200,,266,4.5625

8221634,5,B000W8OMA4,"The film gives the spectator a very clear insight on how cost-cutting policies overtaking safety policies leads to disaster. The film writer/director/producer/main character was a former LAPA pilot, and narrates his experiences in the airline during a difficult under-regulated period in which the airline safety became a huge concern. Those familiar with aviation will find the shots and the plot to be very realisticly done, starting from a real B737-200 being used for the film, to the airline-specific world of aircraft operations including pilot decision-making and pilot hierarchy issues in the now inexistent LAPA airline.

I highly recommend this film.",1289606400,,660,5.6
