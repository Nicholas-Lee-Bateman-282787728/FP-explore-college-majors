2729303,5,B000MEYKDC,"I saw all the 'Films to die for ' over three days. This was the second best. 'Abandoned' was the best. Most of the rest were just decent scary movies, that were all predictable, and had been done before.

The worst was 'GraveDancers' there was not one likable character in that one I didn't care about any of them, I wanted all of them to die, and it contained overblown special effects that were stupid at the end. Big ghost head chasing in graveyard, wow that is scary, not.",1176422400,,476,4.348314606741573
2729304,3,B000MEYKDC,"This is certainly not the best of the Horrorfest movies. It is certainly better than ""Gravedancers and Penny Dreadful"". I like the premis. There is a lesson that many makers of many horror and some other types of movies need to learn:We, the viewers, need to see what is going on at night. It may be nighttime, but let the moonlight be shining when people, like the kids in the car, are being killed. Action must be seen, even at night. I love horror movies  that are set in forests, on islands, on  abandoned ships and other isolated  areas.

Had I rented this movie, I would not have bought it, but it is worth renting. Good acting,good writing, Good plot. Ben Cross is great for that one star to add star quality and yet something is missing.",1175644800,,745,4.416058394160584
2729305,3,B000MEYKDC,"""Wicked Little Things"" was number 7 of the ""8 Films 2 Die 4"" that made up Horrorfest 2006 (darn, I did not get to use 1, 3, 5, or 9 in that sentence).  Without the virtue of actually looking up any information about the films at the official website or any place else I had assumed that there would be a variety of horror films to see over the three days.  Indeed, there were your traditional splatter flicks with homicidal killers, ghost stories both foreign and domestic, one with vampires, and one with a restless corpse (cadaver to be more specific).  One of the things I was expecting what with the recent success of ""28 Days Later,"" ""Shawn of the Dead,"" and the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake was a zombie movie.  But when this film began and we saw this mother and her two daughters driving through the forest to a mining town in Pennsylvania I turned to the guys sitting near me and said, ""Well, this must not be the zombie movie.""  Boy, was I wrong.

This is one of those films with a prologue set in the past that sets up the horrible things that are going to happen in the present.  In 1913 when the local mine was using children to plant dynamite in small holes to open up new mine shafts there was an accident and children were killed.  You do not need to be a fan of horror movies to know that this was a bad thing and that somebody is going to have to pay.  Jump to today and Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring), who has recently lost her husband and apparently has no choice but to move with her daughters, teenager Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and younger Emma (Chloe Moretz), to an abandoned house they have inherited in this dying mine town.  The house looks rather strange, but that is because the movie was filmed in Bulgaria and not because the house is evil or anything.  However, the inside looks pretty wretched and when Karen finds fresh blood smeared on the door you have take everything with a grain of salt that their plight is so wretched they do not choose to just in the car and get out of town as fast as possible.

Good thing that Hank, the crazy old coot played by Ben Cross, continuing his descent from ""Chariots of Fire"" to roles like this, is around to explain to Karen how what happened over a century earlier is now putting her family at risk.  Meanwhile, Sarah has hooked up with a group of local kids her own age, who not only tell her the story of the coal mining kids but also provide the requisite future dead teenagers to become early victims once the killing starts.  Then there is little Emma, who says that she has made friends with somebody who used to live in the house and keeps wandering off into the deep woods to play.  Finally, we have the guy whose family has owned the mine all these years and who actually is covered by the whole guilt laid out until the seventh son of the seventh son deal.

Ultimately, the cinematic points of reference for ""Wicked Little Things"" is not the current crop of zombie films but rather movies like ""Village of the Damned,"" because the main selling point here is creepy kids.  A whole pack of creepy kids, still dressed out in their mining duds from a century earlier, and when they start moving through the forest after their prey there are some decent moments, but then they catch the prey and things start going downhill.  By biggest grip is that this is one of those films where the rules of the game kept bothering me, because over the course of a century these little things should have turned this mining town into a complete dead zone let alone a ghost town.  Just do the math based on the body count they rack up in this film and whether you multiply that by a month or a year it would be enough to get everyone's attention.  I do not know if Anne Rice was the first to come up with the idea that vampires had to return the blood they took from their victims to create another vampire, but it sure made better geometric sense than having each victim each night become a new vamp.  I suppose it is possible these zombie minor miners do not need to eat at all and we are just catching them during a rare feeding frenzy, but I should not be the one having to come up with a logic that makes this film work, which is why I end up rounding down on everything.

However, on the plus ledger, in addition to the pretty Bulgarian scenery doubling for western Pennsylvania there is a valuable lesson to be learned here, namely: do not try to scream and rev a car engine at the same time if you want to be heard.  Also, this Horrorfest 2006 movie at least has a character who was willing to drive on their rims rather than get out of the car and try to get away as was the case in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Penny-Dreadful/dp/B000MEYKE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Penny Dreadful""</a>&nbsp;As for the DVD, the only special feature is a commentary track by director J.S.

except when you see them all the time in the film, they become less and less menacing and more pathetic. couldn't they spend just s little more money making these kids truly horrifying with makeup such as a fallen face or exposed choppers, maybe a RingLike walk for posterity rather than just pale children that like raw meat?

the answer sadly is no.

2729320,2,B000MEYKDC,"CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS.

This story started out interesting, but it just kept going downhill.
It was full of plot holes.
The story did not make sense.
The ending was ridiculous.
There was a lot of blood and gore, but I did not find it scary, the scariest thing for me was the rats crawling on the table.
There was a lot of unnecessary cursing.
It did hold my attention all the way through, although I found the ending disappointing.

It was nice to see Chloe Grace Moretz as a little girl.
Her character was afraid of ridiculous things, such as her older sister jokingly mentioning monsters, but she was not at all afraid of being lost in the woods in the dark, or to talk to a zombie child with a burned-up doll, or to see her mother's and sister's faces soaked in blood.

The older sister, Sarah, just goes out all night with three teenagers whom she just met, and for a few nights in a row, just sits in a car with them, in the dark in the middle of nowhere, smoking pot and making out.  The mother does not care where she has been or who she has been with.  The mother only seemed to care about Chloe Grace Moretz, whom she kept calling her ""baby.""

The title did not fit the movie at all.
The movie was about children who were some kinds of zombies, and there were no ""wicked little things"" anywhere in the movie.
I expected the movie to possibly be about demons or some kind of devil theme, or a haunted house, but it had nothing to do with that.

The zombie children were kept satisfied (in other words, did not go on killing sprees) because the Hanks guy was leaving pigs for them to eat.  But they were ""dead"" since 1913, and there would not be enough pigs for Hanks to possibly leave them every night for all those years.  They all carried huge weapons, so they certainly did not need Hanks to leave pigs for them, they could have killed anyone or any thing that they wanted.  Suddenly, pigs were not enough, and they needed to kill several people in one night.  The police are never called in, and no one seems to care about the dead bodies, and none of those murdered people seem to be missed by anyone.

At the end, they just drive away from the house, looking calm, not traumatized, like everything will suddenly be okay and they suddenly have another place to live.",1456012800,,2280,4.313817330210773

2729322,3,B000MEYKDC,"Regarding Wicked Little Things, what purpose does the story serve? Entertain the viewer, explore an idea or does it do both? In this case, the story does demonstrate entertaining elements.

What is the central idea from which the action derives and unfolds? Is the central idea that of retribution? If so, then this film main purpose serves the sense of entertainment for which a viewer seeks fulfillment.

It seems, for the result to be cinematically good there must be a detailed mental vision in the screenwriter for a sense of direction needed by both director and actors. Was the vision at the screenplay's inception conceived with detail? What is the point of this story? Is the point that retribution is cross-generational?

Making a good film is a difficulty of realization, a rare accomplishment of achievement, let alone an expensive one. Many things about this film invite the wishful thought they had been done better. Criticizing prompts the sudden sense of self-importance. There is no sense of self-importance here in this writer.

Yet the film seems more of a distraction than anything else. Many questions suggested by its story remain unresolved. Yet, if the zombie children are seeking reprisal, does that make them ""wicked?"" If they are wicked as the title says they are, then, are they punishing someone deserving of their lethal, cannibalistic justice?

Maybe what is so memorable about this movie is how ordinary it is. But, who am I to criticize?",1455840000,,1470,5.032921810699588

2729340,5,B000MEYKDC,"I bought this mainly because Scout Taylor-Compton, who plays Laurie Strode in Rob Zombie's Halloween and Halloween II is in it.  I was surprised at how good it was.  It's kind of creepy the first couple of times you see it, but then it's alright.

The movie starts in the early 1900s in a coal mine in Pennsylvania where a group of kids are accidentally buried and killed in an explosion.  About 100 years later, a family, Karen Tunny and her two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Grace Moretz) move to an inherited house from Karen's recently deceased husband near the old mine.  The house is full of issues and a mysterious guy comes at night and smears blood on their door.  The blood protects them from the children, who are zombie ghosts.  The zombies are believed to be a legend.  Emma goes out into the woods unsupervised and claims to have met a girl named Mary, but no one believes her.  Sarah meets new friends there and one night, they are attacked and only Sarah survives.  The other three are torn apart and eaten.  Sarah and Karen are chased and end up at the mysterious guy, Hanks' house.  They are attacked but the zombies' target is the landowner, Carlton, who is a descendant of the people responsible for the accident.  The zombies kill Carlton and Emma shows up with Mary, one of the zombies.  The zombies say they won't kill anymore.  Later, Karen, Sarah, and Emma move away and Mary and some of the children now live in the house.

The bonus feature, the commentary, is very insightful and the director describes the film as a kind of dark fairy tale, which I can agree with.  The zombie children are kind of creepy, moving in groups and attacking with their pickaxes and shovels.  The makeup used is creepy in a lot of scenes.  The cast does a great job with their roles.  Scout Taylor-Compton does really good in her role, but I still prefer her portrayal of Laurie Strode in Halloween.  Chloe Grace Moretz does a good job for her young age at the time.  Lori Heuring is good as Karen.  Ben Cross plays Hanks well.

If you haven't seen this movie, I would recommend seeing it.  I haven't seen any of the other ""8 Films to Die For"" yet, but I'll get to them sometime.  I started with this movie because Scout Taylor-Compton is in it.  The movie is dark, creepy, and has an ominous tone to it.

But the acting & story are still highly respectable which is why I was torn between giving it 5 stars or 4. I enjoyed it. It kept me entertained & I recommend to others including people I know personally.

On a side note, another reason this movie kept my attention so much is because I knew the girl who plays 'Emma' in this movie looked SO familiar. I finally narrowed recognizing her from another movie I watched not too long ago. Mid-movie I was 99.9% sure what movie she was on.

Along for the ride are her two daughters: one surly teenager who spends most of her time whining, and one pre-teen that tends to have imaginary friends and likes to run off and get lost. Rounding out the cast: a wacko who lives in a shack in the woods, a dim-witted country-store clerk who stays just this side of creepy, a wealthy a-hole that everyone hates and who hates everyone, plus your standard high-school friend starter-kit consisting of: Jock with letterman jacket, cheerleader girlfriend, suave non-jock friend, and generic American muscle car.

Filling the requisite role of the creepy, malevolent presence are a clutch of zombie kids in turn of the century miner's outfits.

As Tim Janson said,

""The plot is fairly straightforward and predictable but then again, most horror films are predictable and part of the fun is the ride towards the end. The main weakness for me were the performances which were all stock horror film specials...vulnerable widow, rebellious teenage daughter, over curious young daughter, etc...Lori Heuring as the Mom just wasn't believable enough nor a strong enough lead to carry the film. She simply looks too young to have a teenaged daughter and just to pretty to play a beaten down widow. Ben Cross plays Hanks and again, he's playing the ""Dr. Loomis"" role and offers little in any way of an original performance. Interestingly, Scout Taylor-Compton who plays teenaged Sarah has been selected to play the role of Laurie Strode in Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween."" ""

Suggestion to person A: stop revving the freaking engine and maybe person B will hear you, you idjit. Another: girl opens kitchen cabinet and there sit a couple of squirmy rats. Soooo....I guess the rats, what, opened the up-high cabinet, climbed in, and politely closed the door behind them? Another: Woman sees rat on her kitchen table and just kinda shews it away. Sooo...I guess on the table is a no-no but off in the kitchen corner or in the living room is just fine by her? (And by the way, when was the last time a rat in a movie was creepy or scary - ""Willard,"" maybe? Horror movie makers should from this point on be forbidden from ever using rats.

2729389,2,B000MEYKDC,"This movie should not be classified under the 'Horror' category. But it sure has drama in it so this film being classified as 'Drama' is correct.

I watched this movie on a dark room with only the television powered on and giving lighting. This movie did not even scare me. The suspense was not enough to make one jump out of his/her seat.

There are some fillers that made the movie longer than it should and has no relevance to the main plot or mystery. Sarah's, the eldest daughter, and her friends' scenes did not contribute to the development of the story. The whole plot could run in around 45-minutes with details shown to the viewers instead of an hour and 35-minutes with fillers.

A major letdown was showing the ""what happened in the past"" on the beginning of the movie. The beginning, kind of like a flashback in time, pretty much explained the whole movie. Hence, I would not put this under 'Mystery' because of the reason mentioned.

This film pretty much includes the standard elements like a character who does not believe in the paranormal, an intimidating character turned to a crazy person, and a character who believes in the paranormal but the main characters does not believe.

The Good:
-The character designs for the children are nice.
-You get the standard characters personality.
-Yay! It is not a found footage film.
-There is drama.
-The camera viewing angles are good.

The Bad:
-Fillers that made the movie longer than it should.
-Background music and scenes lacks synchronization or are mismatched.
-The drama scenes are not just ""striking"" enough to trigger sad emotions.
-The script describes ""ghost"" but those were not even close to what ghosts/spirits/demons are.
-Not a horror movie but a suspense/drama.

The production values are spine chilling and heavily atmospheric; you can almost smell the country air, old wood and pine needles.
The plot is rock solid and the opening scenes; accurately conceived and disturbingly realistic, instantly convey the premise and set the mood for the tragic aftermath that inevitably follows.

There are the usual ingredients for this type of horror story; a small town in the middle of nowhere, long dark backwood roads through a dense and ominous forest, a dilapidated log home with a bad past and scary reputation and spooked locals who like to quote scripture.

Ingenious use of the Biblical Passover theme.

I was totally with the kids right from the beginning, I could completely relate. You couldn't pay me enough to live in a place like that, I am so serious.
This movie is scary and never loses momentum; yet it never cheats the viewer by brelying on predictable and mind crippling cliches.

There is no in-between with this series, and unfortunately Wicked Little Things falls on the awful side. I had high hopes for this film, as it has a great back story and features Kick-Ass's Chole Moretz in her debut role, but the film moves far too slowly and plays too much like an R.L. Stein book. Following the death of her husband, a woman moves her two daughters to an old house in the middle of nowheresberg, Pennsylvania. The house they move into used to belong to an evil millionaire, who owned the local mine, and used child laborers, many of whom died in accidents. The souls of those kids aren't at rest and they don't like having a new family in their house, so they lure anyone within range, into dangerous situations. I was surprised that the acting in this film was actually pretty good and that some of the scenes in the woods are pretty edge of your seat, but the problem here is that nothing really happens.

2729430,1,B000MEYKDC,"J love to watch a good horror flick. but this sure isn't one of the good ones.

I don't remember reading anything about our countries mining history that mentions young girls working the mines? Yes, they did use young boys and all the miners were abused. My question is why would the writer use a young girl when it would have been much more believable to use a young boy in the same situation?

 What were these entities?
 The kids kept calling them zombies, but they do not follow in the zombie genre (infected dead that eat brain matter and or flesh) of humans. I thought that they were ghosts that for some unknown reason (we know that they are after the mines owner and his decendents) would kill and eat the flesh of animals and humans not related. The ghost kids would not go after descendants of fellow miners and yet they chased after the mom (family by marrage) and the eldest daughter and Hank's? The girls nor Hank's did any harm to the ghosts, so why were they so mad? The ghost kids were killing everyone in site, so why did all the locals act like this was an urban legend with a few exceptions?

It seems like the writer could not make up his mind as to what the dead miner kids were and left it up to us to decide.

 Almost every scene was shot in VERY low light for an eerie mood effect that just got in the way of telling the story and was used way beyond it usefulness to the point of being annoying. The acting was decent as was the direction for the most part, but the story was a little on the boring side and incredibly predictable. The set designs were good as far as I could see in the darkness. The kill scenes were ok, but nothing special and they were on the mild side for gore.

To recap. The movie is predictable with decent acting and a story thats falls short in the thrills and chills departments. There is no nudity with a few scenes of teenagers making out while drinking beer and smoking a joint. The story does have a fair amount of light violent scenes that don't show strikes landing, but show the aftermath in VERY low light. Its not the worst horror flick made by a long shot, but its so clich'ed and predictable that its not on my must see list of movies.

2729435,3,B000MEYKDC,"Always on the hunt for a horror bargain, I picked up Zombies: Wicked Little Things. The plot outline is revealed in the opening minutes of the movie with a nice scene set in the mines of 1913 and the fate of the children at the hands of the greedy mine owner is established, providing a nice backstory for the film to work from.

Zombies: Wicked Little Things boasts quite the cast with young horror stars Scout Taylor Compton (Rob Zombie's Halloween) and Chloe Moretz (Kick-Ass, Let Me In) alongside the legendary Geoffrey Lewis (The Devil's Rejects) who helps explain the legend behind the malevolent children; and the always impressive and underused Ben Cross (Dark Shadows: The Revival, Exorcist: The Beginning). My problem with the casting cropped up when Tim showed his face... it was Ethan from Hollyoaks (Craig Vye) sporting a ridiculous floppy hairdo and a ridiculous attempt at an American accent!

After viewing for a while, I was concerned with the title of the film since to my mind, these are not classic cinematic zombies and I am of the opinion that the makers have chosen this title simply to cash in on the popularity of the genre. The ""zombies"" here are not mindless shambling ghouls but vengeful undead children intent on killing those who enter the woods and searching for the bloodline of the man who sealed their fate. Don't worry fiends, there's plenty of flesh-eating to keep you going.

There's nothing overly complex about the plot or set up of ZWLT and ultimately, for me, the film plays out like a dark fairytale with appropriate moral messages strewn throughout the film. However, despite the fact that kids in horror movies are generally creepy and this flick has enough gore and death to keep it ticking along, it's just not scary on any level. The ending is a bit twee for my liking but then again, this is probably in keeping with the film's dark fairytale feel.

Then, they arrive at the house and oh surprise it's a sty, so they all go to bed and the mom has a dream where she's stabbed and wakes up panicked only to find blood on the door of the house...

2729469,3,B000MEYKDC,"Wicked Little Things was one of the original ""8 Films to Die For"" back at HorrorFest 2006.  It was supposed to be directed by Tobe Hooper, but he dropped it for another project, leaving J. S. Cordone to try and make something good and creepy out of the venture. Unfortunately, the end result is rather pedestrian and uninspired - an easy enough film to sit through, but a far cry from anything ""to die for.""  You have to walk a fine line when you're entrusting your film's creepiness to a bunch of ghost children.  Strangely enough, the kids of Wicked Little Things do just fine - it's the special effects guys charged with giving them their creepy appearance who fail to deliver, in my opinion.

After the death of her husband, Karen Tunney has little choice but to pack up her two daughters and head for her late husband's ancestral home in the Pennsylvania wilderness, a home she knew nothing about until turning up a deed in her late husband's possessions - for some reason, her husband had always refused to talk about his youth or where he came from.  Her husband's childhood stomping grounds doesn't turn out to be quite the respite from the storm Karen had hoped for, and her teenaged daughter hates the place.  Any why not?  The town has more missing persons posters than actual people, the large old house is in a state of gross disrepair, and someone has smeared fresh blood all over the front door.  I wouldn't have set foot in the place, personally.  As if the place isn't creepy enough already, Karen soon hears about the local legend of deadly ghost children (or zombies, according to some) roaming the woods at night.  Way back in 1913,  when the evil owner of the local mine used immigrant children to perform such mundane tasks as crawling through small holes in the mountain to place explosives, a whole pack of kids got buried alive.  They're said to roam the woods at night looking for revenge.

Silent and stoic, still dressed in their grimy miners' clothes, the children can appear quite menacing from afar.  Unfortunately, the spell is broken when you see them up close.  I don't care how good they are with a pickaxe or how greedily they tear into ripped-off hunks of human flesh - much of the effect is lost by the fact that they just look unnatural and fake.  To me, at least, they all appear to be wearing some kind of latex mask, and the black blood smears all over their mouths strike me as pure makeup overkill.  The kids are great, but the makeup just makes them look rather silly, and it's hard to be scared of anything that looks silly.  Honestly, it ruined the whole effect of the movie for me.

Wicked Little Things is not a bad film, and I don't consider it an undeserving entry in the inaugural 8 Films to Die For collection.  I imagine that some viewers will enjoy and appreciate the film much more than I did.  In fact, I almost feel bad for giving the film three stars because the filmmakers obviously cared about the story and committed themselves to making a good, creepy horror film.  The end result didn't really work for me, yet I wholeheartedly believe Wicked Little Things merits the attention of the wider community of horror fans.",1283731200,,3180,4.561619718309859
2729470,5,B000MEYKDC,"I am not usually into zombie movies but I liked this one!  It had a plot and although the zombies were children who died in a mining accident, the plot was actually an intelligent one. You are kept guessing until the end.  There isn't a whole lot of gore and such, but if you don't like the four letter words, then make sure that you don't have the kiddos around.  If they have nightmares--you definitely don't want them watching it if they are at the Hannah Montana stage.  Get my drift?

The acting was right on the money. Ben Cross plays a wonderful supporting character in here--and it's ""not the old guy who knew too much"" thing like the other reviewer said.  This character (Aaron Hanks) knew his s*** and probably kept more than a few townspeople alive over the years!  You just don't know WHAT to think of this character until he explains later on what the story REALLY is.  At first you don't know if he's nuts or what, but later on, you find out otherwise.

Huering was perfect for her role too.  None of the cast overacted and the director did an excellent job.  The effects only enhance the storyline.  I prefer this to the standard R rated blood, guts and gore flicks we get subjected to any day of the week.",1266192000,,1221,4.377777777777778

I think it is pretty awesome that they had real kids not only eating their vicitms, but totally hacking them up with some sort of pick axe.  I thought it was gonna be one of those movies where the monsters/creatures would be lurking right behind someone, but then the person would walk away at the last second.  i really liked that they showed no mercy and killed whoever passed through their woods.

2729484,2,B000MEYKDC,"WICKED LITTLE THINGS

In honor of the new 8 films to supposedly die for I went back to the first set and sat down to this little flick. I remember when this series was first announced I was excited beyond belief, oh how that changed with these flicks. I was not really all into most of them from the first two series although some were good, so before I go into the new set I decided I would go back and revisit all the older ones. Having already reviewed ""Dark Ride"" this seemed like a good next choice in the first series.

A long time ago a mining community had put the local children to work down in the mines , this proves to be tragic sense the mine collapses and kills all of the kids. So for everyday after that apparently the kids walk the woods at night looking for those responsible. Oh and by the way they also feed on the flesh and blood of the living, neat. Fast forward to the present we have a single mother and her two daughters both of which need some spankings. One is a teenager with an attitude {go figure} and the other is a little brat that will not listen. I would have been so mad at that kid for disobeying me and going out into those woods multiple times putting not only herself but me in danger as well. Any way add in some town folk one in particular who knows about the curse and a real estate guy who is buying up all the property, and you have this little wicked thing [whatever].

This is not a bad movie is the sense that production wise and technically it is fine, and for a ghost story it works well. The problem comes in with the whole zombie thing and the lack of a clear reason why they do this. How did they become zombie like flesh eaters and if they have been doing this sense their deaths how is it that only one or two people knows of them. I know that the live stock they feed on from that one dude is not enough to keep them satisfied. Also why continue to kill people that had nothing to do with the accident, if it was really that one guy they wanted and then they would stop why not just wait for him. Producer/screenwriter Boaz Davidson {Righteous Kill, Day of the Dead, Rambo, as well as other well known projects} and writer Ben Nedivi {Entourage} can be blamed for this, but on the plus it does seem like they did try [some films lack even that]. Also director/producer J.S. Cardone {Prom Night, The Covenant} and executive producer Avi Lerner {Kill Switch, Righteous Kill, Day of the Dead, Rambo as well as others} should take some of that heat as well, even though Cardone it seems knows how to keep a movie going. The film does look good for this type of film and has the right kind of atmosphere but I just don't think it worked out right. As far as the acting goes Lori Heuring is fine as the widow mother of two Karen Tunny and pulls off the role in a believable manner. As for her daughters Scout Taylor-Compton is some what annoying to me in this movie at times as the oldest daughter Sarah, more so than not. And as for the youngest Chloe Moretz plays Emma well enough for a child actor. The three are the stars of this film and try to carry it but none are really capable at least in my opinion, I just wasn't feeling it in this movie. All of the other actors do good jobs as it turns out that all of the supporting players seem more interesting, except the teen s Sarah hangs out with.

I think the thing I dislike most about this flick is the fact that with the producers/writers/director this film had it could have easily found distribution with out the ""After Dark"" name. That means they took the spot of what could have been a truly deserving independent low budget fright flick that will never see the light of day now. With that said this film is far from the worst movie ever and may not even be the worst from all of these films, but still I expected more. Also I have a question is it true that Tobe Hooper was involved in this, I watched the film with the commentary and all and still the question remains. With that said after listening to the commentary it seems that they truly set out to make this film work, I have liked other films these guys have made.",1239235200,,4135,4.204030226700252

Even when they're shown in close-up, their well-fed faces and healthy looking bodies do not suggest long-dead zombies. Lucio Fuco gave us some great zombies 20 years ago in his Italian masterpiece, ZOMBIE. That should have been a turning point in zombie movies where future filmmakers could try to outdo the master.  Instead, the filmmakers probably hired these kiddie undead creatures during a visit to a school and hired them and instructed them: ""Now, I want you to look real scary and don't anybody smile."" The result is that all of them look properly solemn and respectful but most suggest they were thinking: ""how much longer do I have to wear this gray and white make-up and dark lipstick and mascara.""

The idea has been done in other movies and even on t.v shows. A group of children die in a mining accident in the early 1900's and wander the now deserted forest up in the hills at night as little zombies with axes. A mother and her two daughters move in after inheriting their dead father's family house. I could have done without the beginning back story on the miner kids and how it all began - that's what finding newspaper articles is for... Of the two daughters, one is about 7, and very devoid of personality. Scout Taylor-Compton is the teenage sister, the best thing in this long movie. The family never stops to wonder why they are the only people on the hill besides a crazy woodsman, why everyone else lives in the town below them. In a Hide & Seek ripoff idea, the young daughter goes out to play with invisible friends and disappears. People start to die, farm animals disappear...
This movie has to have the lamest killers EVER seen. They attack robotically with their little pick-axes and the first image in my head is of the 7 dwarves gone mad.

2729518,5,B000MEYKDC,"I don't think this movie was nearly as bad as most people do.  Just a quick note- I looked up the name of the small town from this movie that was supposedly in Pennsylvania, and couldn't find anything.  So it must be a made-up town name.

Anyway, about Wicked Little Things.  It's a really good horror thriller when it comes to atmosphere, and very successfully patient in building up graphic scenes (and I mean that in a good way).

It's about a woman and her two daughters who move into an old rundown house in the middle of nowhere in a forest, and once they arrive, they immediately wonder why there's blood on the front door.  I liked this part because no time was wasted in building suspense.

I also liked the part right before this when the mother and her daughters were driving down the road and they see a figure of a ghost child walking into the woods.  When the mother gets out of her car and checks to see where it went, she couldn't find it and went back to the car to say it had disappeared.  Really good scene.

The only problem I had was that most of the movie took place in the dark which meant we could barely SEE anything going on.  The only things we could see was the mysterious fog in the background lingering in between the trees in the forest, and the flashlight the mother was carrying around.  It was somewhat of a struggle.

Another small problem I had was how all the ghost children chose to kill people in very basic ways with just the axe they were carrying around.  That was basically their only attack.

I also liked how the people in the town were very unusually quiet and spooky themselves, despite the fact they weren't really evil or demented themselves (they certainly came off like they were!)

Oh sure, storylines like this have been done a thousand times, but that's okay when the results are really good, and this movie is a good example of exercising patience to build a disturbingly effective ghost story.  It's not really a low budget film either.  Unless you think the Grudge is low budget, it looked very nice to me.",1201478400,,2063,4.412698412698413

2729534,3,B000MEYKDC,"Wicked Little Things (J. S. Cardone, 2006)

There are three kinds of brutally low-budget horror films these days, in the wonderful low-budget horror revival we've been seeing in the past few years: there are films that are simply awful, that no budget increase could possibly help; there are films that are so good that the lack of budget makes them charming testaments to creativity, films that a bigger budget might harm, rather than help; and there are films that would be obviously better if they'd had a bigger budget. The last kind tends to be the hardest to review, since a film of that sort could either have its best points brought out by a budget used to hire a better stable of actors and someone to give the script a little polish, or it could wind up a useless special effects extravaganza. Wicked Little Things is this type of film, and I have to admit, I'm stumped. I certainly want to like it; it's quite impossible for me not to be charmed by a storyline containing kid zombies who were killed in a mine disaster.

Cardone (The Forsaken) once again managed to pick up a pretty decent cast for this one. Scout Taylor-Compton (An American Crime) plays Sarah, who, along with her mother Karen (Seduced: Pretty When You Cry's Lori Heuring) and younger sister Emma (The Amityville Horror's Chloe Moretz), is forced to move to the house they inherited in the backwoods of Pennsylvania after the illness and death Karen's husband. Left penniless, the family needs to live in the house until they can sell it. Problem is, the house is near an old mine, where a cave-in in 1913 trapped a number of miners, all of them children, all of whom rose from the dead as zombies, and all of whom are quite hungry. Some people, however, they will not eat. Some they find especially tasty.

The whole thing quickly becomes a pretty standard revenge melodrama (this is not a spoiler; it's pretty obvious right from the opening scene, and if you don't get it from that, you should know five minutes after the family moves into the house), except for, well, kid miner zombies. The problem is, and I know I never thought I'd say this in my lifetime, the kid miner zombies just aren't enough coolness to carry the entire film. Some of the acting is downright atrocious, though some (Taylor-Compton, usually, and the always dependable Geoffrey Lewis in a minor role) helps carry the movie along. Cardone took the Val Lewton angle of ""if you can't afford the budget for it, just make it dark,"" and usually it works, but there are some scenes where things are just too dark to be seen. (I am willing to admit this may just be a bad DVD transfer rather than bad cinematography, but in the absence of any proof of an alternate hypothesis...) Overall, the movie's a mess, but it's a glorious mess that might have been a really, really good movie with a slightly bigger budget. ** ",1193875200,,2866,4.602739726027397
2729535,2,B000MEYKDC,"Part of the After Dark Horrorfest, ""Wicked Little Things"" is a haunting tale of the rural Pennsylvania hill country that has always been rife with legends and tales of ghosts and hauntings. A brief prologue set in 1913 finds a group of very young children forced to work deep in a coal mine. When the owner of the mind demands that a new shaft be blown up, the children are left inside to be buried alive.

Now in the present day, recently widowed Karen Tunny moves to this rural area of Carrolton with her daughters, teenager Sarah, and young Emma. She inherited the house when she found the deed in her husband's personal belongings after his death. The house was owned by his family and has been empty for many years. The Tunnys move there sight unseen, perhaps a bit of a stretch, but there are strong hints that there were serious financial issues and that they had nowhere else to go.

Wicked Little Things is filled with a load of horror film trappings and clichs. There's the weird storeowner who warns them to stay inside after dark, and the crazy neighbor who warns them of the same thing. The plumber assuredly states he wants to be done fixing her pipes before the sun sets...and then does just the opposite and I suppose you can guess his fate. And of course the young daughter seems to have a bit of a rapport with the spirits who haunt the area. It turns out the ghosts of those children buried in the mines prey on whatever they find after dark. Actually ghosts might not be the best word as they feed on their victims, making them more zombies I suppose but not the George Romero type...

The Crazy neighbor, Hanks, is actually protecting the Tunnys by smearing his blood on their front door at night as it seems they won't attack their own blood and Hanks is one of the children's ancestors. The area is suitably creepy, an old, almost primeval forest, protecting its deep, dark secrets. The ghosts/zombies are also fairly creepy with their pale complexions and dark eyes and lips, often smeared with blood.

The plot is fairly straightforward and predictable but then again, most horror films are predictable and part of the fun is the ride towards the end. The main weakness for me were the performances which were all stock horror film specials...vulnerable widow, rebellious teenage daughter, over curious young daughter, etc...Lori Heuring as the Mom just wasn't believable enough nor a strong enough lead to carry the film. She simply looks too young to have a teenaged daughter and just to pretty to play a beaten down widow. Ben Cross plays Hanks and again, he's playing the ""Dr. Loomis"" role and offers little in any way of an original performance. Interestingly, Scout Taylor-Compton who plays teenaged Sarah has been selected to play the role of Laurie Strode in Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween.""

The DVD extras are very slight. You get only a commentary with the Director J.S. Cardone and Lori Heuring. While the acting is mundane the overall atmosphere of the haunted woods and the creepiness of the ghostly kids lifts ""Wicked Little Things"" above the ordinary. Not a great film but definitely worth a view on a dark night.

2729536,4,B000MEYKDC,"I expected this to be a typical b-horror flick. You know, bad acting, cardboard characters and replete with gore, insects and things jumping out and startling you in place of any real scariness/spookiness. I was surprised to find that not only were the principal actors good but the overall film was as well. The filmmakers focused more on creating a spooky atmosphere and working from there instead of taking the cheap way out and creating another trite splatter flick(think John Carpenter's ""Halloween"", which also had minimal gore, maximum atmosphere).

5 stars are reserved only for the classics. This isn't a classic, but it was a refreshing, enjoyable and welcome effort that hopefully encourages other filmmakers to go for spooky substance over splatter-and-startle cliche'. A very strong 4 star job. I recommend this film and look forward to further work from these filmmakers.",1189382400,,885,5.232394366197183
2729537,5,B000MEYKDC,"Pull up a chair, horror fans, and lend an ear (you won't get it back).  This film is actually quite good, much better than I expected. It's a movie that hearkens back to those classic horror films of the 70's when movies were about ghosts and mood and awesome scenery, not today's torture/butcher fests by heavy metal wackos posing as directors. Don't listen to the naysayers who are jaded by today's over the top garbage. This film is low-key at just the right times, but also goes for the gross-out when needed. And there's a Classic old-guy-who-knows-too-much performance by Ben (don't call me Barnabas) Cross.  It's not a perfect film, but for a dark lonely night on the couch, it's a great little story with creepy little kid/zombie ghosts that now, I swear, I look for in the woods at night, just in case...",1188604800,3,813,4.638888888888889
2729538,3,B000MEYKDC,"I have definately been very let down by all the horrorfest films up until I checked out this one. It really didn't provide much in the scare department but did have an interesting storyline coupled with some decent acting. Something I couldn't say that about any of the other horrfest films I've seen.

Now I am not saying that this is a great film by any stretch, but I would say it may be worth checking out if you are seeking anything decent from this horrorfest mess.",1188518400,,471,4.413793103448276

2729540,1,B000MEYKDC,"**ALERT**--The following is one person's opinion!

Bad; wickedly bad, horrendously awful, putrid, blew chuncks--get the idea?  This is another of the ""8 Movies to Die For"" released last year.  This one completes the set for me and I will have to say that of the eight, this one was by far the worst.

Director J. S. Cardone takes the viewer on a boring journey beginning in the early 1900's.  Seems mean, old Mr. Carlton, the owner of the mine, has little children going where no man has gone before, and apparently one gets sleepy on her five feet trek back to the front of the mine, decides to lay down, and causes everyone to get ""blowed up REAL good.""  BUT...all the children seem to come back as (gasp) ZOMBIES.

Enter three whiny-butts, a/k/a the Tunny family; Karen (the mom); Scout Taylor-Compton (the oldest whiny daughter); and Sarah (the youngest and apparently the dumbest of the lot; however, that point is arguable).  The three of them do a lot of crying, and whining, and moaning, and staggering around in the dark like they've just been hit in the head with a large object.  The oldest daughter has three of her friends eaten by this hungry horde, the youngest one just INSISTS on playing with the blown-up (not to mention DEAD) Mary, and the mom, well, she should have put down for her acting alone.  It seems the children are after Old Man Carlton's great (and you can put in as many ""greats"" as you want here) grandson, and, once they eat him...all is well.

I can forgive movies of this genre for lots of things.  I CANNOT forgive any movie for having so many holes in its plot that it starts to resemble swiss cheese.  This is so hackneyed, trite, and boilerplate that even a 5-year old could figure out where movie is headed.  There are NO scares, the gore is average (for these types of movies), and I must have checked the clock about a dozen times to see what time it was.  Boaz Davidson received credit for the story; Ben Nedivi wrote the screenplay.  It is rated R and the run time is 94 minutes.

Avoid this one; it is terrible.",1184716800,6,2056,4.483870967741935
2729541,3,B000MEYKDC,"I'm giving this one 3 stars as opposed to 2 stars (my standard rating for most of the SnoozeFest releases) because this one I found more tedious and boring than offensively unoriginal, as I found most of the others.

I am tired of writing about the horror movie cliches that abound in most of the HorrorFest releases, so I won't bother to repeat myself here.  (I would doubt that much of anyone would care to see what else I've written about these, but should you be at all interested, just check my other reviews.)  This one does much of the usual--small town with a secret, and in come a family of young women with a teenager who is about as stereotypical as they come.

But this movie made it clear another aspect of the formula--get a couple of recognizable actors who, unfortunately, come pretty cheap to try to generate a little interest early on, but of course kill off at least one.  This definitely presented itself in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Penny-Dreadful/dp/B000MEYKE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Penny Dreadful</a>, but here manifests in the appearances of Geoffrey Lewis as a doomed heater repairman, and Ben Cross (Ben Cross!

From here, I would expect that you already have an idea of whether this movie will interest you or not.  This one is not as bad as other HorrorFest title, but it's not one to maintain interest by trying to do anything that's all that original.

Hopefully, next year's festival has had enough preparation time to find some real gems.",1184544000,2,1761,5.5655430711610485
2729542,5,B000MEYKDC,Out of the 8 flims that are available in this series of movies this is one of the best. Make sure to add this one to  your collection,1183766400,2,133,3.75
2729543,2,B000MEYKDC,"Wicked Little Things held promise, simply because it was selected for the After Dark filmfest. Other movies in the series are good, if not great, like Dark Ride and Gravedancers. I expected similar quality from Wicked Little Things. I was vastly disappointed.

The basic plot without giving away many spoilers is that children worked the mines years ago, and due to shotty and corrupt practices by the owner, the kids were killed. Now they roam the mountains by their mine looking for revenge and blood. Into this comes a recently widowed mother and her two daughters. They inherited a house just by the mine and are determined to make a new life for themselves, but they cross paths with the zombie miner children.

Now I like a good, cheap horror movies. This movie isn't good, just cheap. The little zombie minors are just kids with black contacts and dirty faces. That might have been scary in maybe 1960, but now it looks pretty lame. The kids sometimes eat bits of people. Most of us have seen that done to death if we've watched 28 Days Later, or Night of the Living Dead. This movie offers nothing new, just bad directing, bad acting, a weak script, and a feeble ending.

If you haven't seen them yet, watch Dark Ride or Gravedancers instead. If you must see a zombie movie try Army of Darkness for comedy, or 28 Days Later for great zombie action. But do yourself a favor. Save your time and money and avoid Wicked Little Things.

Not recommended.",1179878400,,1456,4.61003861003861
2729544,4,B000MEYKDC,"This may be one of the better recent horror movies I have seen. There were so many things I liked about it also!

First off... I've read the other reviews and do not agree with some of the comments. I will agree that the plot is a bit cookie cutter... the plot has been reiterated a number of times so I won't go into that.

But... the good things I liked are: The acting is not overdone... it's right on par. The special effects AREN'T the movie.. they enhance the movie. The plot is easy to follow, direct. All the characters fit into the story... no suprise characters. No special camera effects that took away from the movie.

Simply stated... this is a more traditional scare fest. But I happen to like those.",1179705600,27,714,4.353383458646617

2729546,2,B000MEYKDC,"Despite the bad reviews I gave this one a chance and was really disappointed. The plot is contrived...a recently widowed mother of 2 girls moves into a old family home [inherited by her late husband] deep in the mountains and finds her and her kids at the mercy of malevolent forces in the form of vengeful kids [who dies in a mining accident back in 1913]...yes that's basically the plot. A lot of things don't make sense like at the beginning the mom says she was forced to move into the old house as they have no money but contradicts that statement later, she allows her young daughter to go out with strangers on the second night in a strange place...etc etc. The 'wicked little things' themselves don't elicit much horror...the make-up is pretty bad, and there's no explanation as to why these kids have turned into flesh-eating zombies. The acting by the leads was actually ok, but with such a poorly plotted storyline with cheesy effects, there's not much that could help lift this horror flick out of the doldrums.",1177804800,11,1023,4.657458563535911
2729547,1,B000MEYKDC,"A recently widowed mother of two moves with her daughters to a remote mountain home she finds a deed for among her late husband's belongings. The home is located near an old mine, where nearly a century ago an accident occured that cost the lives of many children who were working in the mine. This is the extent of the story you will get when you watch this lackluster film. I approach every film I see and every book I read wanting to enjoy the story. I love to be entertained. This is why it is so disappointing when a bad one gets through.

Basically, Wicked Little Things is like a made for Sci-fi Channel movie with slightly better effects but huge story gaps. At night, the ghosts of the children killed in the mine haunt the woods, killing anything straying into their path. But when they kill their victim, they proceed to eat the remains. I guess this means they are zombie ghosts. Another flaw is people die and no one comes around looking for them. There is supposed to be a town nearby but you never see it. Most of these films at least have a sheriff but I guess there wasn't enough in the budget. The locals seem to consist of a crazy old hermit (played by Ben Cross) who knows the local yore, a local handyman (Geoffrey Lewis), a trans-am filled with teenagers, and the clerk at the local store (who I couldn't figure out if he was supposed to be semi-retarded or a closet child molester due to the creepy way he seemed to dwell on the youngest daughter).

The make-up effects for the zombie kids was pretty good but special effects do not make a movie (unless its directed by Michael Bay). The most frightening thing about the film is the fact the DVD is an Unrated Director's Cut. This usually means things were added to the film since the theatrical release. I can't believe the movie I watched actually had added footage. All I can say is I feel worse for the people who saw this film in the theaters. Then again, maybe not. At least their version was shorter.",1177545600,14,1980,4.392370572207084

There, they encounter zombie kids killed off in a mining accident at the turn of the century. While the acting is somewhat decent (and the only feature of merit in this flick) everything else screams - GENERIC.  Poorly paced, poorly written and completely derivative of several dozen movies you've seen before.  Sadly, i've seen made -for-cable-tv cheeseball flicks on the Sci-fi channel with more appeal then this.  Definitely feel free to skip this film in the After Dark collection.",1177545600,2,597,5.061224489795919
2729549,5,B000MEYKDC,"I can do without gore in horror movies. I prefer a good ghost story with no gore and lots of atmosphere. This film had that creepy atmosphere to help it out. The story isn't very strong, and maybe too much blood (you'll know what I mean when you see it), but very strong on location.

The family moves into an old house on top of a mountain. They want to fix up the old house and sell it. Locals in town warn them, the mountain they live on is ridden with ghosts and zombies. The locals don't dare go to the mountain after dark, plumbers hired to redo the old pipes rush to get the work done before sundown and get off the mountain.

When the sun goes down, all hell breaks loose. Good scenes of people running through the forest and fog which set up a creepy atmosphere. 3 1/2 stars out of 5.",1177286400,2,793,4.109677419354838

Other than the teens, the cast gave it their all and wrung all they could from a story that has little rhyme or reason. Wicked Little Things is told through a series of horror movie cliches so old you may not remember the first time they were used in a movie. There's never any sense of dread or any real scares because every part of the movie is so well telegraphed by the use of these cliches.
