7562734,5,B0194C3E20,"Pretty standard Lego fare for DC comics. A reasonable story with elements from the DC past. Braniac collecting worlds and this time, the Justice League needs to stop him. Braniac is a bit less than level 5 genius but who cares. Batman doesn't brood quite as much but is still in character. We get three members of the Legion of Super Heroes as a bonus, and the heroes in some time-travele altered costumes. That's fun also. And why in the world would you buy this without getting the Cosmic Boy character inside? That's part of the fun.",1458864000,2,536,4.536082474226804

7562738,3,B0194C3E20,"The Brainiac has a hole in his collection when one of the planets he's shrunk and stored on the shelf becomes damaged and the only planet that can replace it is Earth.  The Justice League bands together once again to take on this threat and is successful, until Brainiac scatters the 3 most powerful members, Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern through time.  Now it's up to Batman to travel through time (with Flash's help) and rescue his friends. Batman is forced not only to confront his enemies, but also his fellow Justice League members to convince them he is really their friend.

The voice actors return again and all give great performances.

Unfortunately this entry into the Lego DC universe feels a bit lacking, with the plot dragging at times.  The new characters are a nice touch, but can't overcome some of the staleness here.

The Blu-ray comes with the standard language and subtitle features but contains only one bonus, a gag reel with the characters.  A few behind the scenes, or even a single unique feature about the characters or making would have gotten this another star.  The Cosmic Boy minifigure pack in is a nice touch for the Lego collector.

Overall, it's a fun movie for the kids but will probably fall flat with the adults.",1457740800,5,2092,6.465949820788531

7562742,3,B0194C3E20,"Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Cosmic Clash is a new, animated feature in which the brilliant, obsessive-compulsive super-computer Brainiac is combing the universe for new additions to his collection of worlds when he stumbles upon a planet ripe for his taking  Earth. But Brainiac quickly discovers that Earth has a strong team of protectors  the Justice League. So he cleverly displaces several members of the Justice League to other time periods in Earths history. To retrieve their comrades while members of the Legion of Super Heroes attempt to hold off Brainiacs assault, Batman, Flash, and Cyborg must build and use the Cosmic Treadmill to race across time.

Voice talent includes Troy Baker (Batman), Nolan North (Superman), Grey Griffin (Wonder Woman), Josh Keaton (Green Lantern), Chary Payton (Cyborg), and James Arnold Taylor (The Flash). Phil LaMarr provides the voice of Brainiac.

The Justice League, also known as the Justice League of America, reintroduced Golden Age superhero characters during the late 1950s. The original Justice League included Superman, Batman, Aquaman, Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, and Wonder Woman. Superman and Batman were seldom featured in the stories. Over the next few years, Green Arrow, The Atom, and Hawkman were added to the roster.

The sole special feature on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack is the featurette The Justice League: Caught on Camera, a gag reel of flubbed lines and missed cues. There is also a deluxe Blu-ray/DVD edition that comes with a Cosmic Boy mini-figure.",1457136000,3,1557,5.338775510204082

7562753,3,B0194C3E20,"As part of the ongoing series of made-for-video animated movies, this Lego flick probably has the longest title out of any comic book adaptation! Taking place after Attack Of The Legion Of Doom, this has the Justice League crossing over slightly with Legion Of Super-Heroes.

Brainiac comes to Earth to shrink it down to make it part of his set of shrunken planets. The Justice League stops his initial assault, but Brainiac returns from his Brainiac Borg-collective with a device to send Superman, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman each to different points in time. Batman jury rigs the Batmobile into a cosmic treadmill powered by the Flash to go through time to rescue the other heroes. Meanwhile, Cyborg stays behind to gather other heroes to stop Brainiac's drones, but everyone else is currently on other worlds, so he contacts Supergirl for help. Batman first goes back to the stone age to restore Wonder Woman's memory with her magic lasso, which ends up setting up the Amazon society(meaning that this whole time travel trip was predestined!). Next, Batman rescues Green Lantern from pirates, and finally ends up in an Earth's End future trying to find Superman. Flash gets taken back to present day along with Wonder Woman and GL to help the rest of the League battle Brainiac. In the future, Batman discovers Superman has been assimilated by Brainiac into being evil, but is rescued by Saturn Girl, Lightning Lad, and Cosmic Boy from the Legion of Super-Heroes, the rest of which were allegedly ""killed"" by Superman. Batman jet-skates to the remains of the Batcave, supposedly to get his Kryptonite to take down Superman, but instead uses a solor-powered ray to free Superman from Brainiac's control. Supes is transported back to the present, just in time to see it get shrunk into Brainiac's collectors set. Batman shows up in a Legion time bubble, and unleashes some spaceships for each of the Leaguers to use to combine into a giant robot, which in comparison to the now shrunken Earth is on the same scale of Unicron! The giant JL mecha fights Brainiac, while Batman gets inside him to reverse to shrinking device in his head, and restoring the planet to its normal size.

This was a decent tribute to the old time travel stories done in the history of DC Comics, almost like a Lego version of The Hunt From Bruce Wayne story arc with the Elseworlds-styled different Batman costumes. It still plays out as an average all-ages feature, while still entertaining for comic geeks.",1476057600,,2489,4.881796690307328

At present time, Cyborg get help fighting Brainiac, from Supergirl.  She is  cheerleader and keeps up the cheers during the battle.  Lot of campy action and lines.

7562783,5,B0194C3E20,"Just finished watching; along with Jeff H.., ""Justice League - Cosmic Clash"" released by Warner Brothers.
""Batman really shows his emotional side in the movie,"" Jeff H. proclaimed with just the right hint of a smile as the end credits began rolling up the television screen.
And that's what makes the LEGO Justice League Movies so much fun to watch. The tongue-in-cheek humor is terrific.
Brainiac is perhaps the ultimate collector in the universe. He collects whole habitable planets by shrinking them down and putting them inside glass jars to put on his display cases to admire - and they must, must be in MINT CONDITION.
After accidentally destroying a world in his collection by dropping it on the floor of his space craft, Brainiac seeks a replacement world for his collection and settles on - yep, you guessed it Earth.
Fortunately, the Justice League is on hand to stop him; but Brainiac, being the super smart computer that he is, hatches a plan to defeat the Justice League by sending Superman, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman to the past and future.
In order to save Earth, Batman must travel through time, with the help of the Flash to rescue the three missing superheroes.
SPOILER ALERT - Batman has Bat Tattoos on his arms. Flash has perhaps the best line in the entire movie when he asks Batman: ""Seriously, you have a Batman Caveman Outfit stashed away in the Batmobile. What else do you have hidden away?""
Great Fun!
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
