2270703,4,B00099BJ66,"Mona (Nathalie Press) is bored. And disgusted with her brother, Phil (Paddy Considine, ""In America"", ""Cinderella Man""). Phil, just released from prison, returns home having `found God' and transforms the family pub into a revival hall. He starts to have meetings, trying to transform the lives of people in the small Yorkshire town. Mona meets Tamsin (Emily Blunt), the daughter of a wealthy family. They form a friendship, teaching each other about their lives, sharing secrets, exploring together.

""My Summer of Love"" is a very good film. Many things about it are fairly ambiguous, peaking your attention. For instance, it isn't immediately clear when the film is taking place. Everything in the little town in Yorkshire, England is slightly old-fashioned. Very few cars are seen. The two girls dress in slightly hippy-ish clothes. No cell-phones, plasma televisions or computers are in evidence. But I don't think it is actually set in the late 60s. I don't think the film is trying to be a period piece. But because it is ambiguous about this, the film gives itself a certain amount of dramatic license, allowing us to believe in the relationship between the two girls.

As the two girls grow closer, they begin to affect each other's lives in ways that are very natural. Each is clearly bored. Tamsin mentions early on that she was expelled from boarding school. She is ""a bad influence"". Because she is bored, is a bad influence, and has more resources than Mona, she begins to change the life of her friend. First they are friends, sharing laughs and time, and adventures. But as their relationship unfolds, they become closer and share love, declaring that they will never separate.

Mona is a less complex character on the surface. She follows Tamsin's lead, presumably to the ends of the Earth. A captive audience for Tamsin, the stronger personality, Mona follows because she wants to escape her brother's newfound religion. As her character develops, we sense that she is perhaps stronger than she let on, maybe even steering the relationship to meet her needs.

The two girls become lovers, but the film is not about them being Lesbians. It is about the bond they build and share, and how that bond is threatened. Both girls are probably seventeen and they share experiences like any normal teenage girl or boy would share them. With intensity. As if they were the last experiences they were ever to have. With all of their heart.

There is a lot of emotional power in the film. Mona doesn't really believe that her brother has ""found God"". It is merely another scheme he has come up with. This makes him all the more unbearable to her. Later, when he comes to Tamsin's house to find her, Tamsin tries to seduce him. This is a great scene, providing a lot of depth to all three characters.

""My Summer of Love"" is a very good film about two teenagers who share love, heartbreak and more over the course of a single summer.",1120521600,45,2936,4.792490118577075
2270704,5,B00099BJ66,"Propelled by splendid performances by Nathalie Press and Emily Blunt, My Summer of Love is a film that you won't forget.  My Summer of Love explores class barriers, lesbian awakening, truthfullness, and alienation as two young women discover each other in an idle summer.  The well-heeled Tamsin (Emily Blunt) is home from school after being suspened for disciplinary problems.  Mona (Nathalie Press) the recently orphaned dauthter of a pub owner struggles with life at home with her ex-con, born again religious zealot brother.  The two girls find eachother and the sexual tension between them bridges the wide social gap.

The script is excellent and the movie allows us to witness the deepening affection between Mona and Tam with the creative hand of the director hidden behind the evolution of the principal characters.  The sexual tension between the girls grows as the conflict between the girls and Mona's brother intensifies.

My Summer of Love is superbly cast, admirably directed and ultimately believable.  The story is captivating, spellbinding, and in the end unforgettable.  The DVD is a must buy.",1119830400,15,1112,5.237288135593221

2270710,5,B00099BJ66,"This straightly  became my top 20 movie list right after watching it last night.
It was so beautiful and I was like really stuck on to the monitor for 90 minutes.
I never liked Emily Blunt before. I first noticed her from DEVIL WEARS PRADA. From that movie she was this thin, really thin woman with thick makeup and she was kind of wacky woman. She was a really good actress but not to be loved.
Then I saw her from other several movies but because of her previous images, I never thought that she is beautiful.
In this movie, she was so so beautiful for the first time I felt it clearly. Her eyebrows are so pretty.
She was so brave enough to expose her full nude body to show how beautiful her look is. But still the most beautiful part was her face. Her jaw line, and ther eyebraws in the dark. The main actress was Natalie Press, but she was negligible. Anyone could have done that roll.
There is two other things really made this movie shine.
One was the country side view. It was so marvelously shot. It was breathtakingly beautiful.
And then the music. It was like as if I am dreaming. A dreamy music I would say.
This movie is not just another low budget film.
It was a movie to be remembered for years and an instant classic.
You should try to find it in from some kind of a download site or from amazon or something.
It will open your eyes and ears.

She is currently in my top 2 list of actresses, for very good reasons.  There are lots of beautiful actresses, some that can't really act but get cast because of looks.  Unless i am watching porn, i will take quality acting over looks any time.  Don't have to make that choice with Em.  You get both.

The fact that she likes to play with people's feelings. For her It makes no difference if it is someone hurt by her actions. It is so fun. It's nice spending time playing with the feelings of a girl who's in love with her. This is a naive girl who believed her and loved her unconditionally.

2270727,4,B00099BJ66,"Before most of us knew of her, Emily Blunt (""Looper"") starred in this indi-film from the U. K. about 2 girls in their late teens finding a special friendship.  Blunt is Tamsin, a spoiled young woman of means living with a mother who travels all the time and a father who is having an affair with a local woman.

Home for the summer away from boarding school under suspension, she meets Mona (Natalie Press), a local who lives with her older brother above their pub in town.  The two couldn't be more different but form a bond that leads to more than just casual friendship.  Mona has been having an affair with a married man, but he is just using her for sex.  Her brother (Paddy Considine) is a reformed criminal who has found Jesus and holds prayer meetings in his pub, which he is in the process of closing.

Based on a novel by Helen Cross, director and co-writer Pawel Pawlikowski slowly lays out a seemingly sweet story of friendship and sexual exploration.  Aided by a wonderful soundtrack by Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory, the film will keep your interest, if only to see where Tamsin and Mona end up.  There are wrinkles of course, involving a flirtation between Tamsin and Phil (Considine) and a dead older sister of Tamsin.

On top of that, the bonus-feature Director's Commentary (which on movie dvd's are sometimes a dreadful waste of time) is fascinating.  Informal, intimate, often seemingly improvised, it carries you along.  I imagine women will recognize a lot in this tentative friendship and maybe-love between Mona and Tamsin. The theme of pretence and/or self-delusion and/or deception holds the viewer throughout the story. The wonderful Paddy Considine is terrifyingly real and un-actor like.  Natalie Press should have a rich career in film and TV, if there is any justice in the world.  This is good stuff. Well done.",1310601600,2,666,5.12962962962963
2270730,4,B00099BJ66,"I started watching it on Netflix because I like Emily Blunt (I thought she stole every scene in ""the Devil Wears Prada"" she was in).  I figured I'd bail on it in a few minutes since it is a story of two young women who form a very close ""friendship"" one summer in a rural part of England and that's not really my cup of tea.

But the movie kept me watching and managed to surprise me a few times with what happened and I found the character of Mona, the local small town girl played by Nathalie Press a sympathetic one and Tamsin, played by Blunt, intriguing to say the least.  And it's not really explicit or strident about the nature of the romance.  It could just as easily have been about a young guy and a girl.

I won't give away the plot and conclusion but suffice to say I think it is a bit of a warning that people should not play games with each other in matters of the heart and that it's always best to let someone who loves you down easily because if you don't, love can readily turn to hate and sometimes that hate can be acted on.",1296777600,3,1045,4.078048780487805

Movie is better than the book: My Summer of Love

Has anyone seen this movie?? I stumbled on it at 3am on IFC and was completely mesmerized by it. I was packing for a trip home (Yeah, I pack late) and just stopped what I was doing and watched the whole thing.

Emily Blunt is an amazing actress. Stunning and terrifying at the same time. You can't take your eyes off of these girls. The scene with the two girls running down the street with Edith Piaf in the background and even the camera can't keep up with them. It is still one of my favorite shots of all time.

With the back drop of a green Victorian lush mansion and soundtrack of the dulling sounds of insects and dry heat, you are right back to being young and bored during your summer vacation. With that lazy idleness of nothing to do, I am convinced anyone could be seduced into Tamsin's world.

Here is a little blurb:

""A tale of obsession and deception, and the struggle for love and faith in a world where both seem impossible. The film charts the emotional and physical hothouse effects that bloom one summer for two young women: Mona, behind a spiky exterior, hides an untapped intelligence and a yearning for something beyond the emptiness of her daily life; Tamsin is well-educated, spoiled and cynical. Complete opposites, each is wary of the other's differences when they first meet, but this coolness soon melts into mutual fascination, amusement and attraction. Adding volatility is Mona's older brother Phil, who has renounced his criminal past for religious fervor - which he tries to impose upon his sister. Mona, however, is experiencing her own rapture. ""We must never be parted,"" Tamsin intones to Mona but can Mona completely trust her?"" (Focus Features)

I was left with such a strange feeling when I went to bed (at 5am). I forgot what it was like to have those magically intense and boring summers where everything can go so right and so wrong all at once.

After falling in love with the film, I picked up the book was so disappointed that I couldn't back to that place. Helen Cross' novel has much more drawn out plot with many characters and a sub-plot involving a missing girl.

Ha...Well Pawel Pawlikowski (the film's director) didn't care much for all of that. He had only used Cross' novel as a blue print for the film and only had a script that contained 35 pages and he fleshed out the story as he filmed. Completely leaving out most of the characters and a sub-plot about the missing girl.

I'm glad I read the book. Was a little disappointed in it but I also felt very optimistic that while the reputation for adaptations can be unfavorable, I am excited to see directors (and actors for that matter) are able (in some instances) to modify the material they are given and work it to their advantage.

Anyway...Go see the movie! Let me know what you think!",1279065600,3,2862,4.5703125
2270734,4,B00099BJ66,"My Summer of Love (2004) is an independent British film directed by Pawel Pawlikovski which tells about two 16-year-old girls from different worlds, social groups and interests, who met one warm and sunny summer (and this happens in England) in idyllic rural Yorkshire.  Mona (Natalie Press),  a redhead with freckles lives in a small provincial town, comes from a working family,  rides a scooter with no motor and lives with her older brother Phil (Paddy Considine - as always convincing and pleasure to watch, although his role is rather thankless and the least interesting). Phil recently returned from prison, where he became a Born Again Christian. Upon his return, Phil rebuilt the pub, which he and Mona inherited from their mother into a house of worship. Natalie Press is simply delightful as Mona. She is  impulsive, trusting, cynical and lonely, tired and bored with poverty and dead end existence.  She is not well educated but is observant and has no illusions regarding what future has in store for her.  After this role, Press continues to appear in British independent films. The most notable and interesting - ""Night Watch"" (2008) by Peter Greenaway. The second girl, Tamsin - thin, slim, dark-haired student of the prestigious private school, where she had a negative impact on classmates, is  the daughter of wealthy parents who are never home. She is well-read, speaks the proper literary language, adores Edith Piaf and cites the well-known philosophers. She is ironic and terribly bored in her parents' suburban castle, where she spends the summer. One day while riding the horse, she meets a funny freckled girl with unruly mane of red hair. Emily Blunt was 21 when she played 16 years old charming manipulator Tamsin.  In two years after My Summer of Love, Blunt practically stole all her scenes in the blockbuster ""The Devil Wears Prada"" from Hollywood more famous actress Anne Hathaway. The role of Tamsin did not make Emily Blunt an overnight star but it without doubt signaled of  her promising future in acting.

As different as they are, Tamsin and Mona shared one thing - loneliness, and they become fast friends with Mona staying overnight at Tamsin's house and spending all days together. The relationship progressed from  the mutual interest to friendship to to the intimacy when the girls become un-separated and sexually attracted to each other.  Soon they promised never ever separate and be always together. It seemed that summer and their love would never end but as it is often the case,  one loves without reservation truly and deeply, and the other takes the love and devotion for granted. I read some comments from the viewers rather disappointed with the ending. I personally found it quite logical and the only possible resolution or the Summer of Love. The film is short and lasts less than one and a half hours but during this time we have an opportunity to learn about heroines, to understand their motivations, longings and the reasons behind their actions. My Summer of Love is an interesting psychological drama, which explores the yearning of young souls and bodies, their desires and interests, and sadly concludes that after summer always comes autumn, time to return to the decadent temptations of a big city and to the boredom of provincial stalemate existence. Love, or however you would call the strong and mutual attraction that brought the girls together, would be replaced by bitter disappointment and shattered dreams. According to many interviews with the film writer/director, Pawel Pawlikowski, he did not try to make a film about typical teenage life in England, he wanted to give it a certain ""timeless feeling"". I think he succeeded in his intentions. The film takes place in Yorkshire, England in the 80s or was it the 70s? There are no computers, cell phones or iPods in sight, so, this story could happen any time at any place. It is honest, convincing, and engrossing. Both young actresses deserved and shared an Evening Standard British Film award for Most Promising Newcomer.

Tamsin and Mona have a chance encounter on a country lane and wind up spending the summer together and falling madly in love - teenage crush style. Things unravel at the end with all three showing their true colors.

The film is beautifully shot by Ryszard Lenczewski in West Yorkshire and Lancashire, England. And the director, Pawel Pawlikowski, has a deft touch and moves the characters and story gently forward.",1266710400,2,837,4.846153846153846

2270738,4,B00099BJ66,"The Bottom Line:

Perhaps now best known as the film in which Emily Blunt removed her top, My Summer of Love is a fairly slight but interesting motion picture about an uneven friendship between two girls; it could easily be argued that much more was made of a similar theme in Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures, but that doesn't change the fact that this film bears viewing on its own terms.

3/4",1245110400,2,397,4.577464788732394
2270739,5,B00099BJ66,"In recent years there has been a crop of small films that recall those great small films of the early to mid-70's. Into the Wild (2007) and Wendy and Lucy (2008) are prime examples of this phenomenon, but My Summer of Love (2004) might be the most interesting. It certainly leaves a lasting impression. Really two things leave a lasting impression: the bleak but beautiful Yorkshire valley (which serves as a kind of refuge for two wild creatures that refuse to be contained by social mores/norms) and Emily Blunt's performance (which to this day remains her signature role).

My favorite films from the 70's were the small films that shunned conventional narrative techniques and celebrated the psychological states of individuals who also shunned convention. I am thinking of Barbet Schroeder's More and La Vallee, Antonioni's Zabriskie Point, Altman's Images and Three Women, Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock, and the recently re-released Frank Perry film The Last Summer (1969). These films celebrated little moments of liberation, but they also acknowledged the fleeting nature of liberation, and the cynicism that often rested at the heart of the liberatory impulse. The reason so many of these films were made in the early to mid-seventies was because that was the moment when post WWII, 1950's, and 1960's optimism faded and turned into 1970's skepticism and selfism. In so many of the seventies films dreams of liberation are equated with self-delusion and/or self-destruction. In the 1960's to dream was to awaken to possibility; in the 1970's to dream was to refuse to see the world as it was. My Summer of Love is about two characters: one dreamer, and one cynic. But its also about how these contradictory impulses co-exist within each of us and how we negotiate between the two.

Without giving away too much of the movie's mystery, I'll just say the way Tasmin (played by Emily Blunt) negotiates her own contradictory impulses is fascinating to watch. This is not only a wise and open-eyed study of the divided nature of post-adolescent psychology, but a wise and open-eyed study of the divided nature (and warring impulses) of western psychology.

2270742,2,B00099BJ66,"""My Sumner of Love"" was utterly predictable, and at times banal.  Set in Northern England in a remote working class village, two teenage girls meet and their lives become intertwined.

Mona, the girl from the village, is angry that her brother has become a born-again Christian and turned their pub into a religious meeting place.  There is nothing fulfilling in her life except her ability to draw. She spends her days roaming the countryside on a motorless bike. She meets Tamsin on such an excursion and the two become instantly inseparable.  Tamsin, is not from the village per se, but lives in the feudal mansion nearby and is from a wealthy family.  She tells Mona that she is home because she has been suspended from school.

The two spend all their time together often getting drunk, high or generally causing trouble.  Eventually their liaison becomes sexual, confusing lust with love. Mona is dazzled by the worldly Tamsin, who showers gifts and clothes on her.  Mona's horizon is the village and is very limited. Tamsin has a broad understanding of life in the real world, outside the village and uses this to entice, entrance and toy with her.

How the relationship evolves and ultimately ends can be guessed from the first scenes.  While it is not boring exactly, it leaves the viewer feeling empty.  There is nothing memorable about this movie.  By contrast, the film, ""Beautiful Creatures"", emerges along the same themes, but is one of the most moving and unforgettable stories of this genre.",1232755200,6,1507,4.889763779527559

I felt frustrated throughout the film and wondered why I had paid so much for a movie like it.

Reasons why you WOULD want to buy this movie:
*If you have watched EVERY OTHER lesbian movie ever created and just want to be able to say that you own them all. Even if you know that you will watch it once, and want to throw it away.

Reasons why you WOULDNT want to buy this movie:
*Bad acting
*Poor filming
*Lack of excitment
*Boring and unoriginal plot
*Annoying characters
*Terrible ending

The only way to truly understand the story is to have had exceptional loss yourself in your own life, then as the lead character realizes what the truth really is this story whollops a punch like no other.

All filmakers and students script should watch this film to study the way they tell the story. The characters are in absolute trauma from the loss of their parents, and at the end of the day no matter what they each seek to heal it... nothing works but coming home and spending time with one another, which is all they have left anyway.

It shows how the hurt feelings brought on by loss or abandonment resonate into actions that are outside of the norm in the human heart. Those reverberations are powerful motivators.

2270759,4,B00099BJ66,"Based on the novel by Helen Cross, the British drama ""My Summer of Love"" tells the story of two troubled teens from opposite sides of the tracks who - as the title pretty much spells out for us - meet one summer and fall in love.  Her mother dead and her father long gone from the scene, Mona (Natalie Press) is a simple country girl who lives with her ex-convict, born-again Christian brother who, much to Mona's disgust, has decided to convert the family-owned pub into a meeting place for Pentecostal revivalists.  Tamsin (Emily Blunt), on the other hand, hails from a wealthy family, attends a posh boarding school, and studies Nietzsche in her spare time.  However, despite all these seeming advantages, Tamsin has also endured her share of tragedy.  Her beautiful older sister died of anorexia, her father is a serial adulterer and her mother is a second-rate actress who spends much of her time away from home touring with third-rate acting companies.  Lonely, bored and feeling abandoned by those closest to them, Mona and Tamsin turn to each other for companionship and support, finding hope and meaning in a relationship that neither of them can ever truly understand.

Written and directed by Pawel Pawlikowski, ""My Summer of Love"" is a fascinating study not only of two complex and interesting characters but of the milieu in which they live.  The girls are clearly intended as sympathetic figures - and for the most part that's how they come across - but Pawlikowski is not afraid to show them in a less-than-flattering light when necessary.  Tamsin, for instance, has serious issues with honesty, and even though the girls have suffered quite a bit at the hands of unfeeling adults, that still may not justify some of the petty retaliations they take against those to whom they feel superior (Mona's religious zealot brother and his fundamentalist minions) or whom they believe have hurt them in some way (Mona`s married ex-boyfriend, Tamsin`s father`s current girlfriend).  This, however, only makes the characters more three-dimensional and believable and helps us to identify with them more strongly.  Pawlikowski matches this in the tone of the film, for despite the lyricism of many of the scenes, there is always a hint of darkness and danger lurking just beneath the surface.  We never quite know where the story is going because it refuses to follow any type of narrative formula.  The portrayal of the born-again Christians does border dangerously on the stereotypical, but their presence in the story provides an intriguing counterpoint to the lesbian love affair at the forefront of the film.  It also leads to a visually stunning sequence in which a group of worshippers carry a massive wooden cross to the top of a hill as a way of reclaiming the valley for Jesus.

Press and Blunt are excellent as the two young women at the core of the story, and Paddy Considine (""In America"") is equally effective as the brother who loves Mona in his own way but whose new-found religious extremism ironically functions as a wall preventing him from showing that love.",1155513600,12,3082,4.913294797687861

This movie was actually about two girls' boredom during their summer. It goes without saying that the plot wouldn't be filled with the non-stop action that many attention deficit movie-goers crave.

The movie is based around a local small town girl named Mona who is drawn in a preppy girl's world. Both girls are bored during their summer. At times it's boredom that brings out the best in our imaginations. Unforunately, boredom didn't bring out the best in the screenwriters for this movie.

There is very little violence and nudity in the film. The characters (the two girls) have brief clashes with the overly religious brother of Mona, creating a half charged movie of fearing sexual intrigue and God.

Two sixteen year old girls in the summer of their lives. They both live in Yorkshire, however, they might as well have lived on opposite sides of the moon.  Mona, lives with her brother, Phil, who has found God and is born again from a life of crime. Tamsin is lonely and bored young woman, born to a wealthy family.  They run into each other and become kindred souls.

Mona lives with her brother above a pub, and his friends come daily to appraise The Lord. Mona has lost the brother she knew, and she does not like this new one. Her boyfriend has dropped her and she has no one. Tamsin tells Mona she has lost her sister from anorexia, her father has an ugly, buxom girlfriend, and no one pays any attention to her.

Mona and Tamsin find adventure and freedom in the countryside. Mona moves in with Tamsin and they travel on a used motorbike. They visit each other's favorite haunts and eventually they  find each other.  Romance and love abound, but will it last? Phil w ants Mona to come home, or at least to  come to his ""Raising of the Cross"". She and Tamsin do attend, but they also decide to upset Phil and his whole crowd and they do it in an unimaginable way that will upset everyone.

This is a film that shows the acting abilities of both of these  women. Nathalie Press as Mona and Emily Blunt as Tamsin; were it not for their marvelous acting and playing their young selves, this movie would not jell. The carefree teens and their life of innocence and wanting is a realm of  theatre  that must be seen. The filmography is beautiful and the surrounding countryside is full of life.

"" --Nietzsche

As Tamsin, a prep-school Nietzche quoting outcast tries to impress the unsophisticated Mona, a horse whinnies off-screen. ""My Summer of Love"" is filled with small touches like this that reveal character and carry the story along in an indirect, almost enchanting manner.  Director Pawel Pawlikowski possesses an essential quality of a good filmmaker, the gift for showing more than telling.  I'm going to give some details away in this review, so you might want to stop reading if you haven't seen the film.

I haven't read Helen Cross' novel, so going in I had no preconceptions.  Another reviewer here compared the film to ""Heavenly Creatures.""  Both stories do unfold in a similar manner, but in the end are dramatically different.  In ""Heavenly Creatures,"" the girls have parents but don't want them -- they prefer their fantasies; in ""My Summer of Love,"" the parents are absent (emotionally or physically), while the kids long for their attention.

Keep an eye on the leads' attire during Phil's (Mona's brother) sermon on the mount and in the following bathtub scene.  During the majority of the film, Phil is wearing white, while Tamsin wears red.  The colors red and white play an important part in the film. In the sermon and bathtub scene, the colors shift, and Tamsin shows small signs that reveal she may have some sincere interest in Phil's newfound religiosity under her smirking cynicism.  Here I began seeing the filmmakers weren't taking sides, that maybe Tamsin's fantasy world inhabited by spirits might wind up appearing as unhealthy as Phil's fanaticism, that this film was going to be different than ""Heavenly Creatures.""  I wonder what Tamsin might have done if Mona hadn't popped out of the tub imitating Satan.

""The French forgive crimes of passion.""

Judging from the shot of Phil's giant Cross being dwarfed by a smokestack in the foreground, the filmmakers could be siding with Christ's seven woes.  In spite of what he preaches throughout the film, Phil looks externally, instead of internally for guidance from his almighty Father.  (Near the end of the film, he's definitely not calling out to God for help when he's hunched outside of Mona's room.)

It would've been easy for me to join Mona and Tamsin's ridicule of Phil, and later write him off as a monster, but the filmmakers made it difficult for me to do this, especially when I saw his conflicted grimace as one of his congregation patted him on the back after he'd kicked his sister in the gut.

Paddy Considine gives a respectfully nuanced performance to someone who could have easily been presented as hopelessly corrupt. He gives us someone who sincerely wants to be a better person, someone who grabs hold to the only thing around him that is promising to save him from his violent past.  Phil has just been released from prison; he's a man who used to have no problem ""puttin' a glass in someone's face.""  Their father abandoned them.  Their mother died of cancer. So, he turns the family pub into a church. He replaces the booze with religion. Meanwhile, Mona finds answers from a mother in Tamsin.  (She's lying in a field with sheep when she first meets Tamsin on a white horse.)  Instead of building a cross, Mona draws a picture of Tamsin on her wall. In their valley, the masculine and feminine are divided (in the end, Paddy's pub congregation is made up of all men); men and women have lost respect and awareness for each others' innate gifts (note how Mona is discarded by her boyfriend at the beginning of the film), and until those special qualities are brought into the light, appreciated, and integrated, these characters are destined for depression and chaos.

All of the cast and crew seem to have communicated well with each other, as all elements in the film unite into a clear, fine tuned vsion.  It is beautifully photographed.  At times, the uneasy camerawork and close-ups on the girls' faces reminded me of Polanski's ""Repulsion"" (if it had been shot in color), which is interesting, because I often found myself being seduced by the depiction of Mona and Tamsin's relationship.  Small jolts and zooms are used to show shifts in the characters' thoughts.  I've seen this done on television a lot (mainly crime shows), but in this film, it seems to genuinely accentuate the characters' thoughts instead of forcing or inventing them. Sometimes the technique does call too much attention to itself, but aside from a few distracting moments, it added to the film's emotional charge, really drawing me into these characters' heads.

Pawlikowski's past documentary work seems to have enhanced his ability to direct actors.  There are some scenes, particularly the ones focused on Tamsin, where more exposition is conveyed through a natural gesture or facial expression than could've been with ten pages of dialog.  As with the other players, Emily Blunt takes what could've been a callous rich-girl stereotype and brings a humanity and understanding to her character that makes it hard to hate her. I'm not going into too much detail about Tamsin, because I don't want to completely spoil the film.

The sound and picture quality on the DVD are excellent.  The only real special feature is director commentary, which I unfortunately didn't get a chance to listen to.  The other features are a few trailers, and an ad for the soundtrack CD, which looks pretty good -- Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory's score is both wondrous and strange, their beguiling, distracting 21st-century noir visions remind me a lot of the song ""Not Yet Remembered"" from Harold Budd and Brian Eno's album ""Plataeux of Mirrors.""

If you want to see another well-made film dealing with similar subject matter but with a more upbeat ending, check out Swedish director Lukas Moodysson's ""Show Me Love.""  It's as deserving of your attention as ""My Summer of Love"" or ""Heavenly Creatures.""",1134000000,3,6225,4.9008579599618685

2270769,3,B00099BJ66,"When it comes to stories of love, it doesn't get any more intense than teenagers involved a summer romance. Mona (Nathalie Press) a young Yorkshire local is a sprightly, but naive, small town girl who lives in a run down pub with her troubled brother Phil (Paddy Considine) a recent Born Again Christian. While on her summer break Mona coasts the towns outskirts on her ten quid, motor-less step-through. When Mona crosses paths with a young upper-class girl, Tamsin (Emily Blunt) on one of her 'rides'  they instantly form a fascination with each other. Tamsin is sexy and brash with a confidence that seems to bely her years. Full of culture and mystery she proceeds to spend most of her time with Mona opening up a world that previously had not existed for the young local girl. As they chat about Nietzsche, listen to Edith Piaf, take magic mushrooms and generally run a mock in the village, the girls form an intense bond that soon turns turns into a classic summer romance. However trouble is brewing as Mona's brother Phil learns of their relationship. Phil sees Mona's love for Tamsin as a illness that needs to be cured by the hand of god. In an interesting twist his attempts to warn Tamsin away from Mona sees his true nature exposed. My Summer of Love builds slowly and surely to it's climax through the relationship of Tamsin and Mona. And although it can be described as a coming of age film the story culminates in a clash of culture, family and deception that sees any sort of ""sweet summer love"" clich&eacute; blown out of the water. Press and Blunt at times seem a little out of depth with their characters, although this doesn't take away from what is an interesting skew on the usual young love tale. Considine is perfectly unbalanced as the ex-con who preaches the word of god with the same vengeance that he once drank and fought. Summer of Love may lack the depth and chemistry of films such as Heavenly Creatures however it also lacks much of the darkness, making it entertaining albeit unchallenging cinema.",1131580800,9,2032,4.675977653631285
2270770,5,B00099BJ66,"The maze of emotional turmoil and identity often overwhelms teens, as they seek personal ways of finding themselves through trial and error.  Some of these attempts are sometimes harmful and tormenting, yet the quest of finding oneself continues.  This troublesome quest to come of age intensifies when guidance is of short supply, which on occasion could make the situation far worse than necessary.  However, through this difficult time many youthful minds discover themselves through stressful and painful situations.  My Summer of Love offers an intriguing piece of cinema in regards to this phenomenon where adolescence faces the highly stressful time of self-discovery.

The film opens with a scene where the story's protagonist Mona (Nathalie Press) sketches a portrait of someone directly on the wall.  Decisively, she pushes the pencil against the uneven surface, as shoulders, neck, and a face emerge through her unyielding determination to finish the drawing.  With red marker, she creates a frame around the portrait, which obviously seems to have some deeper meaning for Mona.  When she is done, she sits down on the floor and lights a cigarette while the finished product stares down at her.  This, seemingly out of place opening, suggests that the portrait has some significant meaning, but it remains a mystery to the audience until a later point of the film.

When the storyline picks up the thread, a straightforward tale of how two polar opposite teen girls from two different social classes unites in a sensible tale of affection, belonging, and friendship.  The working class daughter Mona lives with her older brother and ex-convict, Phil (Paddy Considine), in an apartment above a pub.  Mona seems to have wandered into a personal void without any kind of guidance, as her mother has past away and Phil preoccupies himself with God and a search for a more moral cause.  Instead, she seeks her attention from older men who take advantage of her vulnerable state.  When Mona meets Tamsin (Emily Blunt), an intelligent and neglected upper-class daughter who has returned from boarding school to spend the summer with absent parents, her life seems to change.  Like the warm sunlight on a cold winter day, Mona embraces Tamsin's presence and wisdom, as she offers her a listening ear and friendship.  In return, Mona gives Tamsin what she lacks in her existence - friendship and affection, which turns into a warm loving friendship where each teen gives each other room for growth and understanding.

Mona and Tamsin get closer as the summer progresses.  They even become lovers that find comfort and affectionate care within their physical embrace.  Within the presence of each other their trusts grows, as they share their secrets and fully expose themselves with complete disregard for their own safety.  However, in their emotional bliss, they forget about the nearing fall, and Tamsin's return to boarding school.  As the inevitable gradually approaches and the foreseeable pain of breaking up comes closer, their bond becomes stronger.

Pawel Pawlikowski's cinematic adaptation of Helen Cross' novel tailors a clever and symbolic tale of coming of age and all of its angst.  In addition, Pawlikowski truthfully captures the self-deceit and emotional distress that immeasurable numbers of adolescents have suffered under the sign of amour.  Skillfully the director uses visual symbolism through remarkable photography and scene framing, which brings forth through the, at times, brilliant storytelling.  The opening with the moped without an engine analogously suggests Mona's own existence, which lack a drive and aim in life.  Tamsin's initial appearance is completely opposite of Mona, as she enters the scene on a horse, which hints toward her untamed and spirited persona, which is something that attracts Mona.  In the end, the story of the two girls presents touching tale of the pain and agony many nave teens experience on their journey into adulthood.

My Summer of Love offers a worthwhile experience that brings the audience back to the nostalgia of adolescence through a captivating story of love, deceit, and other teenage predicaments.  Several aspects of the film motivate the viewer to contemplate Mona's situation, as she draws the portrait in the opening of the film.  However, the true cinematic gem does not appear until the end of the film, which ultimately offers an exhaustive perspective of coming of age and self-discovery, as youthful arrogance often prohibits outside guidance.",1129075200,11,4529,5.258692628650904

2270772,5,B00099BJ66,"Mona is crazy with boredom in her tiny village and overcome by the new distance between Phil, her born-again brother, and herself.  The mumblings of Phil's prayer meetings saturate the walls of The Swan, the old family pub where she and her brother live alone.  Mona pushes herself on an old motorless bike down the neighboring hills.  Lying by the side of the road, in the grass, seemingly injured, with her bike cast of to one side, she is found by a dark haired girl on a beautifully groomed horse.  From her saddle, the girl asks if Mona's injured.  ""Nah, just resting,"" Mona explains, barely raising her head.  The simplicity of the answer piques the girl's curiosity, and after introducing herself, Tamsin invites Mona to visit her at the manor where she lives.  After a breakup with a married boyfriend, and some very  depressing car sex, Mona decides to take Tamsin up on her offer.

""I'm home for the summer. I was kicked out. They told my mother I'm a bad influence on people,"" says Tamsin, eyeing Mona, with the hint of a game in her eye.  Playing lady of the manor, she gives Mona a whirling and off-handed tour of her mansion, accompanied by  melodramatic schoolgirl explanations of Nietzche and other philosophers. In response to Mona's sad life story--no father, a mother killed by cancer, and her born-again brother--Tamsin offers up her sister, Sadie, who has recently died from annorexia.  The girls' reactions are marked.  Tamsin offers no solace for Mona's loss, a seeming shrug that indicates Mona's dreary life is to be expected of a villager, while upon hearing of Sadie, Mona's eyes widen and she gasps a genuine ""I'm sorry.""  Tamsin just measures the response, contemplating how she will play it.  The contrast between the girls is superb.  Tamsin's pale skin and hollow eyes, and languid motions, contrasted with Mona's messy auburn hair, strong features, freckled skin, and abrupt energy.  Tamsin often comments on music and worldviews she's sure her village friend has never encountered.  It's overtly patronizing.  Yet Mona is no simpleton, and flings her own equally potent and emotionally honest answers at Tamsin's sly questions.  When asked what she's intends to do with herself, she glibly answers something to the effect of: ""Work in an abattoir, marry a loser, get pregnant, and pump out a thousand children.""  Tamsin can only raise an eyebrow, while Mona grins at her grim possibilities.  The disparity between their classes is a draw and they both appear appreciate what they see as innate cruelty or strength in the other (Mona's hatred of her brother's Christianity, and Tamsin's cool world view).  It's a strange love story of sorts.  Or maybe a passion story, since love is a complicated subject within this movie.

Mona is the focal point.  As the girls become closer she gives more of herself to the friendship.  Her tight fists relax, and she laughs more.  Meanwhile the already self-assured Tamsin sees  Mona's raw moments of beauty, with a caustic mix of jealousy and admiration in her eyes, coupled with a sense of accomplishment.  This is never better revealed then when the girls are alone at the manor and Tamsin flings her gorgeous castoff clothes for Mona to try on.  Mona dances clumsily, but uninhibited, in front of the mirror, awed by how pretty the dresses are, and suddenly aware of how pretty she might be.  Nathalie Press as Mona and Emily Blunt as Tamsin are wonderful young actors. Their eyes and motions speaking volumes.

Pawel Pawlikowsky has an eye for the dull, and often, depressing beauty of Yorkshire--monochromatic hills of sun bleached wheat, occasionally marred by flowering heather, the dreary majesty of Tamsin's ivy cloaked manor, and the shade drenched woods that provide refuge for Mona.  It gives the film a sense of weight.  And his treatment of the love between the girls is realistic: curiosity, possession, lust, and cruelty.  The dialogue is simple and candid.  And the ending has a beautiful brutality.  There's nothing sweet about it.",1127779200,94,4021,4.946268656716418

I have not read the book, just saw the movie. I was dissappointed after watching it, then thinking about it, I realized that in any kind of relationship you can not blame one side completely. I think, Tamsin had feelings for Mona but she was just as lost as Mona was, in a different way maybe. She wanted to rebel against her family but she was too coward to do so...In the end, she learnt a lesson, if you make a promise, you have to be strong enough to stand behind your word..Also, by letting her go in the last scene, Mona showed that coward people like Tomsin did not deserve your hate, you just feel sorry for them and let them live with it.

2270774,5,B00099BJ66,"My Summer of Love blew me away. I wasn't expecting such an intense movie. The movie is mostly starring Mona.(Natalie Press) Set in an isolated village in northern Yorkshire, Mona is hurt, angry, lost and bored out of her mind. She has no father, her mother has died. She is mourning the ""loss"" of her brother, Phil, who has done away with his voilent ways and is ""born again"" Christian.

The first thing I love about this movie is that it is set in a small village.  While the scenery is beautiful and charming, as the movie goes along it shows you there really is nothing in a small village.

Mona then meets Tamsin (Emily Blunt), Tamsin is in yorkshire for the summer. Rich, lonely, elegant and dramatic. Mona and Tamsin hang around with eachother, over cigarettes and red wine and french music in Tamsin's stately mansion. Both girls learn they are very much alone, and over the summer form an intense bond that borders on obsession. They say they must never be parted.

The movie is gentle yet intense, very stunning and shocking. I do not percieve it as an ""lesbian flick."" They were both emotionally needy and turned to eachother because they  were hurting inside. I think my summer of love is all about love and whatever way you yourself percieve it. Also with pain and obsession thrown in, too.

Paddy Considine, who plays mona's brother, Phil is also excellent in this movie. He ""found"" god and gave up his voilent ways only to return to voilence at the end of the movie. This movie truly shows what being in turmoil is.

The music is also excellent and fits the movie perfectly. Soft, whimsicle sounds and an haunting voice that chills me. It is absoulutely beautiful.

This is an open minded movie. I give it five stars. It truly shows the nasty circle of emotional pain.  Go see it, it'll make you think.",1124236800,15,1816,4.563076923076923

The story concerns 2 young women,  Tamsin &  Mona.

Tamsin is from a wealthy upper-class background, and Mona is the orphan daughter of a pub-keeper.  At first, Tamsin seems to be reaching out to Mona in her grief over the death of her sister.
Mona  too is feeling  an intense sense of loss after her brother becomes  born again.
 The 2 girls share their pain over these experiences, but  the relationship just doesn't work.

For example, Tamsin has supposedly been expelled from prep school for bad behavior; yet she  constantly pontificates over  high-brow topics, as if she is trying to educate Mona.  Why is the bad girl virtue-signaling like a schoolmarm?  Her interest in Mona seems too much  like social work.

Mona is  not at all the academically-talented type. At one point, Tamsin suggests that  Mona  read Neitsche, and tells her that she would enjoy his books so much.  Mona shows no reaction at all.

But her lack of reaction shows what is missing in this drama.  Normally a girl like Mona might laugh, and say  What, are you kidding me?  Or she might dismiss the suggestion, Don't read much.  Hate school.  Mona doesn't even offer her opinion of Shakespeare, Tamrin's eclectic taste in  music or the beauty of the magnificent house in which she lives.  To be actual friends, Mona would have to feel comfortable admitting that she wasn't exactly Oxford-bound.

Perhaps the  author set the story in the summer to avoid this  obvious conflict  between  these 2 young women.

Were Mona an intellectual, she could  appreciate Tamsin's sophistication  much more; but then she would also have an awareness of her own position in Tamsin's world.

However, Mona is nave, and simply accepts Tamsin's attentions at face value, trusting her and even falling in love with her.  In the end,  Mona marches away from Tamsin to a Piaf ballad; perhaps stronger, and wiser than in the beginning, but also terribly hurt.",1517011200,,1984,4.8408408408408405
