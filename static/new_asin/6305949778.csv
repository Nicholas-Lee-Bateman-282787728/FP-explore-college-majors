1096728,2,6305949778,"I am a HUGE Let Li fan and I watch ever movie he releases.  I usually rent it, watch it, then buy the DVD.  This movie is an exception, it is not  worth $1.  I like Jet Li for his spectacular martial arts and unique style,  especially with the great camera angles, etc.
If you'd like to see Jet Li  starring in a soap opera, get this movie.  If you want to see an hour of  boring dialog and laughable (supposed to be serious) acting, get this  movie.  If you like Jet Li for the same reason I do, leave this DVD out of  your collection, buy Fist of Legend or Black Mask, or ANYTHING but  this!
The final fight sequences are great, but they are only 10 minutes  or so of the entire movie that's worth anything.  So if you don't mind  spending the cash for 10 minutes of entertainment, then go for it.
The 2  stars is for the final fight sequence, otherwise I'd give it 1 star.",967420800,2,875,4.0588235294117645
1096729,5,6305949778,"This movie was quite good!  Why?
1.  It had a good story.  It wasn't all that Jet Li stunts and  etc.  This movie was whole lot better  then ""The Romeo Must  Die"", which had a sorry plot. 2.  It  had good action.  No,.. this movie is not ""The Legend"" or  ""Twin Warriors"", or ""The Fist Legend"", but  it can hold its  own. 3.  Being a moral guy that I am - I  liked this movie for the  absence of cursing and sex.  If I  would've had children I  could watch it with them and not feel  that they are seeing  something that they shouldn't! 4.  It had  good portrayals of a positive attitude.

Originally called ""Body Guard from Beijing,"" there  is a lot of gun play involved which Li brings with new style.  It does lack  Jet Li's true talents of martial arts fight scenes but still a very good  movie indeed.  One of Li's best...behind ""Fist of Legend"" of  course.",961718400,,357,4.303030303030303

1096918,3,6305949778,"This is a remake of THE BODYGUARD with Kevin Costner, only there are no wooden and slow fight scenes, and a better story.

Unlike more remakes, this film is so far superior to the original, they could almost be considered different films!

Jet Li's character is unwillingly assigned to protect the girlfriend of a rich man... She is the only remaining witness to a mob hit.

At first the girl is a pampered, spoiled, gold digging jerk, who doesn't listen to her new bodyguard's security restrictions, 'cause they put a kink in her shopping time!

When she is nearly killed in a attempt on her life at the mall (after not listening to the bodyguard's security concerns about a large open area like a mall)... she begins to realize perhaps she should listen to the bodyguard!

THE BODYGUARD FROM BEJING is the original name for this film. Like most HK films, it is very well made, but when Americans get their hands on them, they edit them, often taking out whole scenes, and don't make any attempt at good dubbing, as that costs more money. This makes the films look funny when it shouldn't be, and poorly made, when they aren't.

This is the only version available right now. Since the original isn't available... get this, and try not to laugh at the voices that don't fit the people.

It is a great story all around... far better than the original... and Jet Li's gravity defying fighting skills (without wires) are on full display here!",1386374400,3,1439,4.6196078431372545
1096919,5,6305949778,You gotta love a good Jet Li movie. This one really doesn't want you to look away from the fighting & shoot out scenes. Jet Li's movies are awesome.,1378166400,,148,4.137931034482759
1096920,3,6305949778,"I love me some Li and I had fond memories of this movie that I had seen many years ago.  That was probably before I saw a lot of his other movies because as I have watched it again recently I have found it wanting, sorely wanting, for a Li vehicle.  Following the conceit of the Whitney Houston/ Kevin Costner ""The Bodyguard"" movie (which I haven't seen) ""The Defender"" finds Li's character, John Chang, an uber-ex-military special forces type of person hired on to be the bodyguard of a beautiful kept woman (Kristy Chung--an admitted pretty sight but not much more is given for her to bring to the screen) who has witnessed a murder.  Li must contend with local police who are, to put it nicely, inept.  His presence raises the bar of this whole affair but it is middling at best for a Li movie.

Much better are most of Li's other movies.  This can be entertaining at times but it is near the bottom of his creative output.",1366502400,3,926,4.385964912280702
1096921,3,6305949778,"A Jet Li movie, but not one of his best. There is some, but not a whole lot of martial arts fighting in this one.  He plays a bodyguard for a rich man's girlfried who has to testify against a bad guy who killed someone.  She is spoiled and wants her own way but Jet Li won't let her. Eventually she learns to trust Jet Li and even thinks she loves him over her boyfriend. Everything works out in the end and Jet Li returns to mainland China and she is still with her boyfriend.",1361664000,,477,4.010526315789473
1096922,5,6305949778,"I rarely believe what other reviewers say and I am glad I didn't do it this time either. The DVD I got was issued by Dimension on August 15, 2000 and the quality of the film is excellent. The synchronization (into English) is also excellent, as are the (English) subtitles.
There are two problems however:

The first one concerns the translation from Cantonese into English. By pure chance I had also bought ""Jet Li: Film Collection"" and one of the 8 films in this collection turned out to be ""The Bodyguard from Beijing"", in other words ""The Defender"". It is in Cantonese and its English subtitles are often VERY different from those in ""The Defender"". As I unfortunately do not understand Cantonese I can not say which translation is the correct one. I must admit that I do not know if this version of ""The Bodyguard from Beijing"" is the same that is being offered as a standalone version which may be different. Nevertheless this remarkable difference in translation is worrisome.

The second problem is a medical one and also occurs in other HK movies repeatedly. When in the ""The Defender"" towards the end the room fills with gas Jet Li and Collin Chou/Ngai Sing try to save themselves by slashing water in their mouths....!
This is such absolute nonsense it equals Jackie Chan's car battery resuscitation in RobinBHood! Every movie producer should have a medical consultant for each movie so that such absolute stupidities will not occur.

Final comment: Although my version of ""The Bodyguard from Beijing"" is two minutes longer than ""The Defender"", there are still cuts noticeable.",1358553600,2,1588,4.874074074074074
1096923,5,6305949778,ANOTHER JET LI MOVIE THAT I HAD TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION. THE CONDITION OF THE DVD IS GOOD AND IM GLAD TO HAVE THIS DVD.,1356912000,,119,3.6153846153846154
1096924,4,6305949778,"The Defender is perhaps one of Jet Li's more different and original of all his HK made films.  The movie relies on a pretty good story filled with multiple aspects of conflict and suspense, rather than a lot of action.  The lesser amount of action never phased me because I thought the movie does well without it.  Thats not to say there isn't any, just not as much as most of Jet Li's movies.  Fortunately, if you can't help but desire a good fight, the finale of the movie presents one of Jet Li's better fights scenes I have ever scene, a fight of originailty etched with emotion.

There are a few set backs from getting a 5 star rating.  The English dubbing, as always, gives the movie a cheesy feel sometimes and makes the acting seem a little week.  Aside from the dubbing, there are some moments in the movie that are a bit cheesy.  Jet Li's character and the woman he is ordered to protect endure continuous scenes of tension that are great to watch, since he takes his work seriously and she has a rich boyfriend who has hired the bodyguard.  Though entertaining and suspenseful moments arise from these two, they also present the cheesy moments, especially the ending of the film.

The Defender is a great addition to anyone who loves Jet Li movies.  I'd have to say this is one of his better ones overall.  Great story filled with suspense, and a wonderful final fight scene that is amongst the best.  If you are looking for movie filled with action throughout, it may not please, but this is a good all-around film, giving more than most martial art films would.",1163721600,2,1574,4.480701754385965

1097184,5,6305949778,"I'm a martial art fan and was expecting a pure martial arts type of movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the versatile talents of Jet Li in this great entertaining movie. A movie with multifaceted action scenes and a touch of soft romance controlled by Li's typical strong sense of responsibilities. Both Jet Li and Christy Chung played their role superbly. It required great acting skills to exhibit both the stoical and annoying characters, and particularly to let the audience feel their strong chemistry for each other without even a physical touch. Jet looks great with his hair and his suit and played the role of a tough, impeccable and honorable bodyguard with a human heart. Christy is beautiful and played a progressing role from an upset woman for being overly protected to a woman in love who turned her back to catch the assasin's bullet to save her bodyguard. The movie is full of nuances that show the dramatic talent of Li as a director. In this movie, Jet Li has proved to the audience that an actor who is being stereotyped as a martial arts master can also excel in other types of movies such as romance and adventure. A great actor shoud be able to perform contrasting characters and out-of-the-ordinary roles. That's what art is all about. Jet Li successfully made the transition from martial arts to drama. He was a five-time Chinese national champion in wushu, a dramatic performance art that mixes martial arts forms with Peking Opera, gymnastics, and acrobatics. If you want to see Jet Li perform different roles other than those in the traditional martial arts movies, you ought to see this one.",1018915200,4,1630,4.804270462633452
1097185,4,6305949778,"Okay, first of all - ""The Defender"" is a very bad attempt to rename Jet's ""Bodyguard From Beijing"", directed and choreographed by Corey Yuen - only Hong Kong cinema's best kung-fu choreographer. He is most notable for the scenes he choregraphed in Jet Li's best kung-fu sequences in ""New Legend of Shaolin"". Corey Yuen (also known as Yuen Kwai) has also directed/choreographed ""Warriors of Zu Mountain"", ""Fong Sai Yuk1&2"", ""Lethal Weapon 4"", ""Romeo Must Die"", and ""My Father Is A Hero.""
Jet Li plays a bodyguard from China's top bodyguard-training city, who protects Christy Chung's character - the only remaining witness to a homicide case. This is one of Jet's few Hong Kong films with a modern setting. This is a very awesome kung-fu movie with some suspence, but more kung-fu scenes. Plot and characters are well-developed with mostly unexpected twists.
Directing, camera angles, intricate kung-fu choreography, and wonderful cast only manage to heighten the performance by Jet. Though the kung-fu choreography is not as intricate as in ""New Legend of Shaolin"", this is definitely a must-see.",1009411200,,1096,5.19774011299435

1097187,4,6305949778,"This Jet Li movie directed by Corey Yuen (or Yuen Kwei) is the Hong Kong version of Hollywood's The Bodyguard.  Jet Li plays a bodyguard from Beijing, who is hired to protect a celebrity & key witness in a murder case.  However, he eventually becomes romantically involved with his client.  The acting and direction is better than most of Jet Li's other films.  However, there is not much action in this movie.  Most of the action (especially the good action) comes at the end of the film, in two scenes.  There is a shootout in a shopping mall, and then a long finale inside a house.  If you don't mind blood & guns, and if you like sped up action, as well as wirework action in realistic movies (like Romeo Must Die) then I guarantee that you will like the action in this movie.",996969600,,780,4.375
1097188,1,6305949778,"wow this movie really sucked!  dont' listen to the others if you are expecting a breathtaking movie with romance and action, believe me you will be very very angered by the purchase of this film! AT MOST rent it and mute the television whenever the little kid is talking. Wow the bad guy was damn lame, the plot was damn lame, and there are at most 2 FIGHT scenes.  The rest is gun shooting crap.....i'm sorry but isn't Jet Li a MARTIAL ARTIST so i would think the director would at least put him in more Martial Arts scenes....all in all what a complete waste of my time..what a piece of garbage",984268800,2,596,4.3125
1097189,3,6305949778,"I like Jet Li, but I didn't particularly care for this movie.  First off, this is the most wooden I've ever seen Jet Li acting.  Granted, his character was supposed to be one of those stone faced types who doesn't let his emotions show until he starts falling in love with the woman he's protecting.  Unfortunately, even after he's supposed to be falling in love with her, he looks no less wooden.  It's as if he were doing this movie against his better judgement, and just couldn't get into the role he was supposed to play.  At least that's the way it seemed to me.
 The plot line is fairly standard, a woman, along with two other witnesses, sees one man kill another, and then weeks before his trial, the other two witnesses are killed, and she narrowly avoids being killed herself, so her boyfriend hires a bodyguard to protect her.  Enter Jet Li's character, who annoys the woman he's supposed to be protecting by violating her privacy, installing security cameras all over her house, including her bedroom.  He annoys her, that is, until she stupidly goes out shopping against his recommendation, and he has to save her life from what looked like about twenty assassins who try to kill her at the mall.  The action sequence here, and the big fight at the end, are the main reasons I gave this movie even as good a recommendation as I did.  The rest of it is very subpar, but the action sequences are exciting, intense, and fast paced.
 Some of the side characters in this movie went beyond my annoyance tolerance level.  One of the cops only purpose was to serve as some sort of comedy relief, but unfortunately, he wasn't very funny, and didn't demonstrate any great effort on the side of the police to protect their only remaining witness to thii crime.  Also, the girls little brother is given a fair amount of air time in the movie, and he was annoying beyond belief, and I saw absolutely no reason for him ever to have been included as a character in this movie except to cause trouble, and draw the movie out a little longer.
 In closing, if you want to see some great action sequences, and don't mind a lot of ho hum filler scenes in between, go ahead and rent this movie, but don't buy it, it's definitely not worth that.  If you do rent it, I recommend just skipping to about half way into the movie when the crew goes shopping, and then to the end for the final fight.  They're really the only scenes worth viewing.",977961600,3,2431,4.46606334841629
1097190,1,6305949778,"This is simply not worth viewing.  Okay, maybe the last fight scene just for its fast action.  The movie itself is exceedingly boring and silly.
