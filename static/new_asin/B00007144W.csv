C. Rampling is as great as ever and so is everyone else --- although perhaps 'Mr. Hire' who acts and directs may be a bit over done --- still --- give everyone credit --- and the women are much better at dealing with all the vicissitudes that develop.  Good movie, lots of fun.",1454371200,,415,4.421052631578948
7973854,4,B00007144W,"This outwardly sunny comedy involves various middle-class Parisians on holidays, all in search of erotic excitement. (It's also been called `See How They Run' and 'Kiss Who You Want'; my guess is that its obvious English title, 'Love the One You're With' - as translators have rendered it in Spanish, Italian and Portuguese - was already taken.)

Charlotte Rampling stars as a well-off woman with unflappable flair that puzzles everyone; her friend (Clotilde Courau) is poor, distressed by it, and just manages with a meager wardrobe and little else. Rampling's droll, detached and urbane husband is having a fling with his transsexual secretary, while their daughter  has snuck off on her own holiday with a boyfriend. Others weave in and out in a weird parade of amorous encounters. One compulsive seducer somehow leaves a woman, an s&m novice, shackled to his bed for several hours (""Oh, sorry: I forgot!""); a boy's anxiety about his new girlfriend vanishes when a mature woman beds him; and so forth. There are trysts in a broom closet, a bath, on an elevator (well, apparently), another one that goes awry in an aeroplane privy, etc., again. Every permutation is explored, just about.

This is all laid out with genial effervescence. While amorous mishaps happen to this very mixed-up bunch, everything falls more or less together in the end. No-one ever quite gives up, although all are victims of their needs, and those of others - the confused, resigned, miserable, would-be opportunists, chronic victims; japes even emerge from an attempted suicide.

Charlotte Rampling wafts through her starring part in idiomatic French. Despite advancing age, she has never looked more inviting, while still sporting an anorexic frame that ideally suits her wardrobe. The director/script-writer, Michael Blanc, appears briefly in an amusing though rather overripe part as a jealous husband stressed out by neuroses about his wife's imagined affairs.

Although erotic stories have probably been around since Cro-Magnons first gossiped around a fire, Blanc's strength is in infusing his players with life. His women fare especially well, showing a richness and clarity of character missing from the males, who are rendered either sketchily or verging on caricature. His fascination clearly fixes on women: even the promiscuous Emilie (Lou Doillon), despite her single-track hunger, has a spark that is missing from her cruelly disdained, so far more sympathetic, boyfriend.

Perhaps most striking is a supporting performance by Karin Viard, who bleeds her struggling husband dry in order to keep up appearances. Although sympathetic throughout, her neurotic fear of being found out and regarded as below standard drives the action adroitly while most others busily pursue someone, anyone, to bed.

In Blanc's comedy of errors the gags are no broader than the standard - revolving doors, mixed identities, the overemphatic, etc. - but his touch always seems fresh. Apart from solid acting and a lively script, some fine editing contributes as well: never showy, it is always at the service of prodding the storyline onward, and keeping the viewer wondering what'll happen next.

Only the Rampling character knows to make the best of her lot - as far as to 'lend out' her husband to her best friend, who is forever choosing the wrong men. Rampling surpasses her work in 'Stardust Memories,' replacing her `60s icy attractiveness with a deeper empathy. But she may go a bit far in underplaying the role's bitchy snobbery, her character's central flaw. This blind spot in Blanc's direction - one suspects he fawned on his star on the set - tilts her out of the fray in a setting with otherwise frantic and flawed, but basically engaging, all-too-human characters who in various ways are their own worst enemies.

The binding notion in all of the apparent summer jollity is love in loopy states of disrepair. This well-crafted romp displays Blanc's talent for sparkling characters, a sympathetic approach with the dangers of the devil-may-care, and an ever-firm grip on things despite giving a feeling of effervescence.

Anyone game for belly laughs and a little more should not hesitate.",1339027200,5,4176,5.1916790490341755
7973855,4,B00007144W,"Summer Things/Embrassez Quiz Vous Voudrez is one of those films that probably shouldn't really work but does. Based on a British novel by Joseph Connolly following various middle class characters (upwardly and downwardly mobile) on a holiday that takes in various affairs, jealousies and suicide attempts, it's a light confection that works surprisingly well, not least because people DON'T do the right thing (when estate agent Jacques Dutronc finds out an employee has reduced the price on a desperately short of cash friend's house for a backhander, he does nothing to rectify the situation). Much of what happens is fairly predictable, with the exception of Charlotte Rampling keeping her clothes on for once, but the performances are strong and Michel Blanc's direction keeps it all on track. Nothing profound, but surprisingly likeable.

Extras are fairly light - just a trailer and a photo montage with an audio essay by the director.",1145750400,5,941,5.231788079470198
