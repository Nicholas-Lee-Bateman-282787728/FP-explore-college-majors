2453472,5,B000C6NP5Y,"Loveless IS shonen-ai, without a doubt. Anyone who says otherwise just doesn't know the series well enough, or just hasn't been paying close attention. True, it could also fall under other genres, but it is also considered shonen-ai (there is a boy x boy relationship, not to mention kissing, plus the fact that much of the series centers around Ritsuka and Soubi's relationship and how it effects and changes both of them). I've seen this entire series in Japanese with fansubs, and have to say that it is really exciting to see it brought to the US. If they continue with the four episodes a DVD habit, then there will only have to be three DVD's, which is also a great incentive to buy; not only will it be to support the industry, but it won't take too much out of fan's wallets. I'm also excited to hear about the DVD extras being on the DVD's. Many fans have seen them, though not with subtitles, which made them confusing.

In any case, onto the show. There are both shonen-ai and shoujo-ai (girl x girl)present in the show, though the latter of the two isn't present in the first DVD. The characters can be both amusing and complex, and the fight scenes aren't there just for entertainment, but plot and character development; not to mention the unique atmosphere that the battles themselves take place in. I love the series and just about everything about it, including the soundtrack, which I hope will be released over here as well. The only qualm I have about the series as a whole is the abrupt ending. The anime is only a portion of the storyline of the manga, so if you want even more Loveless if the series leaves you hanging, then that's the way to go.

Both the anime and manga though are worth purchasing, in this consumer's opinion, and I personally plan on buying both now that I can.",1140566400,14,1805,4.516819571865444
2453473,4,B000C6NP5Y,"As per the reviews below, people not used to shonen-ai do seemed turned off by this show, and I thought I would too. I only started watching as one of my favorite voice actors is part of the cast. BUT...

My my.. what a surprise. Loveless has a plot that really evolves and takes flight. Also the characters are really interesting and mysterious. My first-hand reaction to watching the show would have had be be a mix of emotions: sometimes thinking ""hey, this is kinky, yet artistic"", othertimes thinking ""isn't this totally wrong?... yet, it seems ok"" - by that I mean that this anime definetely breaks the barriers of what is love and what may or not be accepted by society today. I thought I would be totally put off by male-male kisses, but they were so well orchestrated, along with the age-gap issue, and yet there's the bondage themes... but they are all packaged in this beautifully animated, very high-quality artistic level that you are just hooked.

This is probably my wordiest review, but hopefully it will get you curious enough to watch this very unique series, and you will understand how all of the above was so interestingly melded into one story. I do hope they are able to make a second part to this series. NOT a show for kids - do not let the cat ears and tail fool you.",1140307200,19,1293,4.497872340425532
2453474,4,B000C6NP5Y,"I live in Japan, I KNOW yaoi and shounen-ai very well and have even been able to talk to actual yaoi/shounen-ai manga-ka (the comic artists) about what makes something shounen-ai or yaoi. If there are relationships of love not of the familial or friendship variety between two males then it can be either shounen-ai or yaoi. Shounen-ai never shows explicit sexual content while yaoi does. Those are the only real criteria for shounen-ai and yaoi. Romance is USUALLY used in shounen-ai and yaoi because of the fact that both are written for females by majority but it is NOT needed and it doesn't make something shounen-ai or yaoi.

The fact is though that LOVELESS is a romantic piece because, and I have seen the entire series in Japanese, there is love and the way that Soubi does everything he can to protect Ritsuka is romantic. Romance isn't about cute and fluffy happy times! Romance is about doing ANYTHING in the name of love and if you've seen the whole of the series then you can't possibly say that there isn't romance between Soubi and Ritsuka. It isn't light hearted but love isn't usually light hearted in real life anyway so I think that LOVELESS gives a beautifully down-to-earth (regardless of the fact that it's a futuristic world where people have cat ears and tails if they're virgins...) look at relationships between people in love.",1139788800,10,1354,4.786324786324786
2453475,5,B000C6NP5Y,"Although it is a great series, Loveless does NOT qualify as shounen-ai. Less informed anime/manga fans throw Japanese terms around because it makes them feel smarter/cooler/what have you, but the only purpose that serves is to misinform others as well as themselves. Anime and manga which fall into the category of shounen-ai can also be classified as romance stories. Although there is a relationship between two males, Loveless is NOT a romance and therefore is NOT shounen-ai. If you are looking for something along the lines of Gravitation, this is not the series for you. Loveless is much darker, with spell battles taking a 50:1 screen time lead over romantic development, and it falls more into the realm of science fiction than romance. The focus of this series is not on the relationship between Ritsuka and Soubi; rather, it is on Ritsuka's discovery of external and internal truth.",1138233600,18,892,5.033783783783784
2453476,5,B000C6NP5Y,"I must say this is an awesome anime. It does indeed contain shounen-ai (boy x boy romance) it is not yaoi. Everything to this series seems well planned out and it has a wonderful story line. The characters are really well created you really come to love them throughout this series. Due to that this anime really stands out. I'm hoping that they make more episodes, I'm dying for more. ^_^",1137715200,6,389,4.492957746478873
2453477,5,B000C6NP5Y,"Having seen ""Loveless"", I have found it to be a wonderful shounen-ai series. Based off the manga, it has a wonderful storyline, many-facteted characters, strife, love, and war.

The animation itself is nothing to sneeze at, either. It's very clear, with beautiful contrasts, and vivid battle scenes.

I highly recommend this series for anyone liking shounen-ai or having a clear and open mind to ""unusual"" relationships, yet enjoys intrigue, fantasy, and interactions between people. :)",1135900800,13,486,5.466666666666667
2453478,5,B000C6NP5Y,"An outstanding yaoi series based on manga by Yun Kouga (Earthian, Gestalt). Beautiful artwork and animation from top-notch production crew.

[Members of American ""moral majority"" might find it offensive for variety of reasons. Please don't watch or don't complain later.]

True to yaoi genre (which is usually drawn by women and for women), the series focuses more on relationships and character development rather than battle scenes (although spell battle sequences, stylized and symbolic, are visually striking). The general atmosphere is high-tension and definitely erotic, but there is no fan service. In the end, this series is about many forms of love.

Something to look forward to. Oh, and did I mention cat ears :)?",1132876800,24,724,5.333333333333333

8095930,5,B000C6NP5Y,"Its a very great series, I love all anime and manga and this is definately one of my favorites. Its a must get Anime!",1340755200,,117,3.9166666666666665
8095931,5,B000C6NP5Y,"Loveless is, as a work of visual literature, superb:  acting, script, graphic work, music, all were obviously thought out carefully and are beautifully realized. While the relationship between Ritsuka and Soubi may trouble some, I think it deserves to be looked at carefully:  it becomes harder and harder to support describing it as anything other than a real love story.  From that standpoint, it's a poetic story with a lot of resonance that explores many aspects of the nature of love.

As for the ""Is it or isn't it?"" question, let me point out something that might lower the temperature on both sides:  In Japan, for reasons that I understand now that they've been explained to me, it is not considered BL at all -- that, I'm told, is fairly cut-and-dried and depends much more on publisher than content.  In the U.S., we are necessarily working from a different frame of reference, and we see it, if we're looking at all, as a romance, although a highly ambiguous and edgy one, which certainly qualifies it as shounen-ai in my book. Because it is highly erotic, although not sexual, I have to call it shounen-ai because that's the only term I know that comes even close to being accurate -- the connotations of ""yaoi"" and ""BL"" as description simply don't fit.

Oh, yeah -- I like the subtitles.  Hearing the original Japanese somehow adds a dimension to the story for me.",1234224000,,1378,4.7125
8095932,5,B000C6NP5Y,"This is one of the best animes I have ever watched but it is NOT in English or even have English dialogue as an option. You can only only use English subtitles, which is fine with me, but I know that it bothers some people so I thought I should warn you.  If you don't mind subtitles though this is an excellent DVD to buy; it's worth your money.",1209168000,2,346,4.0144927536231885
8095933,5,B000C6NP5Y,"My favorite anime/yaoi of all time. The artwork, characters, storyline, music and cast is all PERFECT and of the HIGHEST QUALITY I've ever seen. YOU WILL LOVE IT. I could go on for ages about how great Loveless is, but I won't. Just WATCH IT ASAP and learn for yourself!",1208131200,,270,4.42
8095934,3,B000C6NP5Y,"The anime has a lovely style. It's beautiful in the terms of 3D animation and design.

But, unfortunately, for those who do not know the *****, it may not be very fulfilling, since it serves more as an introduction. Also, some might be a little bored, since the anime goes exactly like the *****, even having so of the same shots in it. Personally, it does not bother me, but i know it might be annoying to some people.

Yet, i think if You liked the *****, the anime is also worth it, even if there is no booklet, no additional stuff, only the DVD and the box. The design is well worth it.",1174435200,,590,4.166666666666667
8095935,5,B000C6NP5Y,"Loveless is a great buy for its awesome battle sequences, its original and unique battle style, and its pretty animation. It also touts a great buy for psychology-anime fans (i.e. Neon Genesis Evangelion). On the other hand, there are very strong inferences of a non-platonic relationship between the main characters that would be considered statutory rape in the US. Also, there is a lot of angst on the part of Aoyagi Ritsuka, and it is implied that he was previoulsy abused by his parents, and possibly his older brother, Seimei. Great series, but definitely not for everyone.",1174089600,4,579,4.979381443298969
8095936,5,B000C6NP5Y,"One of the best animes out there! I love that it's in Japanese, voice overs tend to spoil brilliant movies :) I HIGHLY recommend this!!",1162771200,3,135,4.44
8095937,4,B000C6NP5Y,"Based on the Manga ""Loveless"" by Yun Kouga, Loveless defies comparison. This is truly a unique, mysterious, and beautiful anime.

12 year old Ritsuka is a traumatised boy who has been mentally and physically abused by his mother and ignored by his father since he lost his memory 2 years ago. At his mother's insistence that he is no longer her real son he is now in therapy. After finding his closet relation - the older brother that he loved - burnt to death in his own school, he transferred schools. The series begins with his first day at his new school.

It is then that he meets an very attractive young man called Soubi who claims to be his brother's friend.  With this meeting Ritsuka learns that his real name, that was chosen for him before birth by an unknown source, was ""Loveless."" Soubi was the former partner of Ritsuka's older brother Seimei in a strange fighting style that uses words as their power.  This may sound strange, but the fighting in the anime is beautifully styled and sometimes brutal in the second volume. Soubi explains to Ritsuka that, at his brother's wish, Ritsuka has inherited Soubi and that Soubi will protect him from the mysterious Septimal Moon who killed Semei.

This is not yaoi (the main character is 12 after all), but more an intense shonen-ai. The fighting partnership is based upon the Sentouki, the partner who fights, taking orders and strength from his partner who is considered to be the ""master."" Only through love can the partner's become strong.  So when Soubi tells Ritsuka that he loves him from their first meeting, Ritsuka is confused, troubled, and also desperate to be loved. Ritsuka agrees to join Soubi in the hope that he will find out want happened to his brother and to get revenge on those that killed him.

Their are many types of love represented in the anime, from the love of friendship to the love of family.  The animation is above average and the music is very moving, especially the gorgeous song ""Michiyiki"" by Kaon Hikita that plays during the ending credits. The anime is in the original Japanese with English subtitles. A must for any shonen-ai fan or anyone wanting to see an anime that explores the different meanings of love.",1146355200,16,2209,4.689922480620155
8095938,4,B000C6NP5Y,"Loveless - Lost and Found, contains the first Four episodes of this 12 episode series.

I, personally, love this series.  It's beautifully done with excellent scenery, amusing characters and some awesome Spell Battle Scenes.  The anime was NOT dubbed, which is an interesting choice, but my only real qualm with the American release is with the Subbing.

Media Blasters decided to leave some japanese words intact, a choice that is both intriguing and understandable.  The Spell Battles that take place in Loveless are based around japanese characters, afterall.  The problem is that, for some reason, Media Blasters neglected to give these japanese words ANY form of translation.

Sentouki/Sentou [loosely translated to Fighter/Fight], among ALL of the spells.

What's worse, is Media Blasters put NO translation ANYWHERE, leaving the question of ""What the hell did they just use?!""

.. Only reason I gave this DVD 4/5 stars.",1142812800,14,926,5.287671232876712
