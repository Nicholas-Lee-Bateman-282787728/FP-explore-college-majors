8268123,1,B000BBOUX6,I love dance yet  did not enjoy this film. I  call it  boring and the music to my ears was annoying and unpleasant discordant often  and nothing to remember.  Many of the dancers were marginal I think..no competition to the Russian Ballet. Females  better dancers than males.  The quality of film not so good anymore . I would not have enjoyed it in 1960. It got raves as a classic and I have to wonder why.,1372377600,,407,4.276315789473684
