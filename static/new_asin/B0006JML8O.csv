8434576,1,B0006JML8O,"I bought this Techno Workout video by M2Kmusic. It's horrible.  It looks like an amateur video contest.  The camera is moving around and the instructor is lacking.  The Instructor uses rudimentary moves.  She obviously has a clue, but needed a choreographer or an advanced seasoned aerobic instructor to assist.  Someone other than a high school or college student should have been in charge of this project.  Its obviously a project, because it a piece of garbage.  Was this originally a contest? And whoever sent in the best video won the prize?  I can't believe I wasted my money.  This DVD is the absolute worst.  I have used workout videos for the last ten years.

The only good thing about the video was the nice pine trees and grass in the background.  But, did it have to be on someone's porch?

HORRIBLE VIDEO,  MUSIC OK,  instructor needed help.  Video camera person SUCKS!!!
