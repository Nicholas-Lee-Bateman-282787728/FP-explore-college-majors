378480,1,6301903285,It was so bad I just couldn't keep watching it. Maybe it will be better if I am really drunk.,1444176000,,93,3.7
378481,3,6301903285,"This movie is exactly the kind of movie that would have played on USA Up All Night back in the early 90's.  It's cheesy but light-hearted and there's some t+a to keep things interesting when all else fails.  There are some inspired gags that are balanced out by some jokes that fall flat or go on too long.  The performances from all of the major characters are well done though the plot is entirely predictable.  Unless you're someone who enjoys craptacular movies (as I am) you can skip it.  Personally, I enjoyed it in spite of its flaws.",1443657600,6,541,4.479591836734694
378482,1,6301903285,Very dumb plot.,1443225600,,15,4.333333333333333
378483,2,6301903285,Waste of time and money. Need to drink before you watch this eyesore I have o idea what I was thinking,1443139200,,102,3.9047619047619047
378484,4,6301903285,"It was not bad.  Low budget,,, yes, but a remotely good rip on 9 1/2 weeks.

378487,1,6301903285,"This has got to be the oddest movie i've ever seen... and i'm an old fan of Rhonda Shear, so that's saying something...",1370044800,2,119,4.217391304347826
378488,5,6301903285,this is a wonderful and funny movie. anyone with a sense of humor will add this to their favorite comedy movies of all time. i only wish it was on DVD. until then i have 2 copies of the VHS in case one gets ruined.,1122076800,,214,3.7777777777777777
378489,1,6301903285,"Now I pride myself on having sat through many a crap movie and enjoyed it (Gor: Hunter from the Future, Outlaws of Gor, Hawk the Slayer, Watch the Shadows Dance and Ninja Wars just to name a few), but this is an absolute steaming heap of sha-it!
At best you will get a few laughs from this hack assemblage of bad slapstick comedy, poor dialouge and parody that even Lesley Neilsen would stay away from.
To summarise the plot for you.  Evil real estate tycoon starts buying up properties all over town so he build a huge high rise.  Sweet innocent heroine losers her apartment, but a charming hero comes to her rescure.  Charming hero turns out to be a ninja master who trains sweet and innocent girl in the art of ninja war fare, while also seducing her with his wit and personality (well not really but if this story was anyway half decent).  And that's really as far as I have got.
I have tried to watch this movie three times, but I can't make it past the first 25 minutes it's terrible.  The only scene that vaguely redeems the film, is the scene where the villian and the hero are playing marbles.  That makes you laugh for about half a second.
Less funny than a Pauly Shore movie. Worse acting than a Hulk Hogan movie, this is not even bad in a good way.  Man I should have saved the ten bucks I spent on this DVD, bought a sick pack of beer and got drunk instead, it would have been more fun.",1064966400,,1399,4.2368421052631575

378613,3,6301903285,"its in the same vein of naked gun and hot shots.... that being said, if you found those movies funny then you have to watch this. yes there is a little boob action, but nothing to get excited about.  some original gag humor mixed with the wit of naked gun and hot shots.... just needed better actors to be a better movie.",1468972800,,321,4.17741935483871

378798,5,6301903285,"This movie was just absolutely strange but hilarious. The entire thing is filled with weird fetish references, absurd characters, and flat out insanity. But every scene has something hilarious. Seriously, if you have any good sense of humor, watch it. And watch it all the way through. Seen a lot of bad reviews but those people are stupid. This is up there with Kung- Pow in lunacy and comedy. I imagine a lot of drugs went into writing and making this film.",1463011200,,459,4.609756097560975

378945,5,6301903285,"There was litterally at least 1 bit per cut. Seriously, every time (and I mean EVERY time) the camera reframed a scene or cut to another actor, there was either a joke or sight gag. To the point that the gags were completly removed from the plot of the film, it kind of reminded me of an over the top Three Stooges - just somehow more casually racist and misognistic. The way the film was written up (""The first erotic arts action comedy.""), I half expected it to be a goofy soft core ""Skinamax"" style movie - but there was virtually no nudity to speak of (particulry considering the time it came out), which somehow was endearing in a way.",1457568000,,640,4.341666666666667
