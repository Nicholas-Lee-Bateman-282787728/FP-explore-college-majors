8310836,5,B000EMG9Z4,"Going into this film it's slow, and you may be tempted to stop watching it, but about halfway through it really connects with you in a way that surpasses words.

It's one of those films that not everyone will like. It's not a film to please the masses, or gain success at the box office, but it is a classic in it's own right. The creator's are brilliant and the characterization is genuine. The cinematography is stunning, and with so many movies being shot digitally it is refreshing to have an indie project to be shot with film, it gives it the real 'film noir' feeling, which is definitely helped by the beautiful, classic golden age look of the Oregon coast.

So if you're someone who likes to really connect with the characters and enjoys a story that will open you up and make you ask questions of yourself, about what's important in your life, then this is for you. However if you're the film viewer who doesn't like being opened up and made vulnerable by a film, and just want to watch it for 'entertainment' then don't waste your time. If you do choose to watch it though, by the end of the film you will be able to connect with at least one of the character's stories and see yourself. I know I did.",1398729600,,1211,4.353982300884955
8310837,4,B000EMG9Z4,I don't give out five stars very often but I wish there was a four and a half star rating because that's what this film is to me. Chad Linberg plays Harper our main character who is a very intelligent underachiever! His performance in the film is top of the line for sure! Also Linberg is supported by a very good cast around him. This story will make you laugh for sure but it will also grasp your focus as well! Really worth watching!,1398643200,,436,4.2023809523809526
8310838,4,B000EMG9Z4,"If you're looking for car chases and gun fights, look elsewhere. There's a brief bit of burning rubber, but otherwise this film is all about the characters.

Harper (Chad Lindberg) arrives back in a small coastal town, to stay with his college-age friends at a farmhouse owned by absentee parents. He's due in court to face charges related to a prank he and his friend Luke (Sean Christiansen) attempted. His reckless and irreverent manner earns him six months in a minimum security work camp. As the eight days before he's due to check in pass, we watch him and his friends deal with their issues, including the question of Harper, Luke, and Luke's girlfriend Paige (Jade Herrera).

In the end, I have to give this one a thumbs up, with one caveat.

It was hard to tell that Harper was supposed to be a drunk, because we don't actually witness him taking a single drink until very late in the movie (after he's already been called out as a drunk by the dialogue) and most of the male actors in the movie delivered their lines with the same slurred speech that Lindberg used.

Frankly, I did find that really annoying. It made it hard to understand what the actors were saying, and it was never really clear until late in the film whether Harper was just a big fat jerk or an insecure alcoholic.

That said, there's a lot of complexity to the characters here, as well as their relationships with each other. And the movie does a great job of walking us along their individual coming-to-terms with their problems and personal maturation. Drunk or not, it's clear Harper is wrestling with some kind of painful past, which the filmmaker does eventually share with us.

In spite of the weird dialogue delivery (I can't help but wonder whether all the slurring was an intentional directorial choice), at the end of the movie I was more than happy to have followed it to the end.

Shot in Skagit County, WA, the outdoor scenery is beautiful (and not far from the recent disastrous mudslide in Oso, WA) and alone makes the film a feast for the eyes.",1396224000,,2042,4.578082191780822
8310839,1,B000EMG9Z4,"This was the most boring film I had ever laid eyes on. Don't waste your time. The film is extremely slow, the characters are lame, and it drags on and on. In fact, I don't even think that after watching this film for the first 30 minutes that they ever got to the plot. Usually a person can get the gist of a movie after 5 minutes and I understand that sometimes it takes a while to introduce the characters and their roles. This movie was meaningless from start to finish.",1363219200,2,473,4.208791208791209
8310840,4,B000EMG9Z4,I enjoyed watching this movie. The actors were good and the story was realistic. I loved the cinematography. A good look the way life can through you a curve.,1361577600,,158,4.482758620689655
8310841,2,B000EMG9Z4,This was a grim tale which never really went anywhere.  Even such potentially beautiful country as the Pacific Northwest was underutilized!,1360454400,,139,5.619047619047619
8310842,5,B000EMG9Z4,This film was actually shot in Skagit County in Washington State. The scenery is beautiful and it will give you a good feel for the area around here. The story is pretty good too.,1170547200,,179,4.294117647058823
