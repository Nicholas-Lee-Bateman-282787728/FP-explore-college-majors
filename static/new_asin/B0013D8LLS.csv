Let me reiderate,
This movie is magnificent!!
One of the best slasher/comedies in existence!!!

1 brother enlists the help of his bumbling sibling
to help him kidnap the tough-as-nails daughter of a local mob-boss.
They bring her back to an abandoned farm,
where everything goes dreadfully arye.

The settings are spooky,
Nothing says horror like a seemingly abandoned farm.
The characters are all lovable, and quite unforgetable,
every last one of them.
The 2 brothers are great together;
as the headstrong, calculative sibling,
and his brother the whipped, nervous-wreck.
Their abductee is a wise-cracking pistol,
who doesn't take guff from no one.
She really gets the laughs bursting from your chest,
as she single-handedly takes on both her abductors.
Their inside-man is complete dolt, a moron of hilarious proportions.
And the the local villagers are unexplainably bizarre.
The laughs are subtle, but consitent,
the gore is plentifully terrific,
and the scares are of the jump-out-of-your-seat variety.
I gotta warn you,
halfway through, this bothched kidnapping tale does a complete 180,
slaps you in the face with a cold shovel,
and becomes an old-school slasher movie,
when the inhabitant of the farm returns unannounced
to find a host of intruders on his farm.
And ""Old McDonald"" he ain't
If you loved flix like,
Shaun of the Dead, Bothced, Hatchet, Behind the Mask, or Severance,
get this flick immediately.
You will not be disappointed.
Watch the trailer and see if I'm lying to you.

MORAL OF THE STORY:
Old McDonald had a farm........but he traded it for an abattoir.",1215648000,11,1606,5.193050193050193
3103401,5,B0013D8LLS,"Let me say up front that for me this could be one of my favorite films of the year. It offers something unseen before, twists a genre on its ear and has more laughs than most highly touted big studio comedies have offered in years. That being said lets get to the plot.

David (Andy Serkis) and Peter (Reece Shearsmith) are brothers who are attempting to pull of a kidnapping. David works for a high level thug and sees an opportunity. Peter is a milk toast who bows to the pressures of his wife and sees a chance to get ahead. Neither of them gets what they want.

The kidnapped in question is Tracey (Jennifer Ellison), a foul mouthed spitfire who takes no guff from anyone least of all two inept kidnappers. Each opportunity that presents itself to do damage to either one she takes. Unfortunately for Peter, the more inept of the two, that means he suffers considerably from beginning to end.

They hapless pair have Tracey holed up in a cottage in the country. This setting is far from anything, including people, making it the perfect place to stow the victim. Well, victim isn't a great term to use for Tracey because she pretty much controls any and everything as we progress.  After a mishap with David's cell phone, he goes to town to use the pay phone. While there, he is warned by the strangest looking group of townsfolk you have ever seen to stay in his house.

The gags in this film move from sight gags to situational comedy that hits the mark every time. Toss in another member of the kidnappers who screws things up past the point of no return (and who offers a laugh that forced me to pause the DVD) and you have a great comedy.

BUT...it's not just a comedy. No, if you paid attention to the cover work on the shelf you caught a glimpse of some spooky looking character. Yes, this is a horror film as well! You get two movies for the price of one!

Eventually, do to Peter's bumbling, Tracey escapes with Peter in tow. Searching for the nearby town, Tracey leads them to a farm that at first seems abandoned. But the more they walk through, the more aware they become of an evil presence that lives there. And when they confront the grotesque figure of the home's owner, it offers a scare and a laugh at the same time.

The movie shifts into a different gear as we've changed from simple kidnap story to horror icon land. The home is owned by a farmer who went mad years ago and who now stalks the countryside. With Tracey and Peter captured, we now get to see David and his fellow cohort try to find and then rescue them. Instead, more mayhem ensues. And when the thug's henchmen get into the picture it's even more hilarious.

I know, I know, the movie doesn't sound funny at all. But that's because to reveal some of the funniest parts would be to ruin it for the viewer. Suffice to say that so much damage to one person has never been nearly as funny. It's like an entire season of FUNNIEST HOME VIDEO damage clips rolled into one person.

At the same time, the movie offers some of the goriest horror scenes put on film in some time. Enough so this movie would not be one I'd recommend for children. For adults though you shouldn't deny yourself the chance to see this funny film. Laughs and scares in equal measure make this one of the most original and best films of the year.",1214524800,2,3303,4.373572593800978

3103404,4,B0013D8LLS,"With titles like Shaun Of The Dead, Severence, Evil Aliens, and Botched being sparkling examples of the horror/comedy genre AND all coming to us from Great Britain, it should come as no real surprise that The Cottage fits in so well with the rest of those films.  Enter polar-opposites(and brothers) David and Peter; stuck in the middle of nowhere and involved in a kidnapping gone awry that includes a captive that refuses to go quietly, a pair of Asian assasins, an obese partner in crime that can do little right(my favorite character too), bizarre townsfolk(with a guest spot by Pinhead himself, Doug Bradley!), and of course, when things seem like they can't get any worse, a demented and deformed maniac!  Now for the kind of dry humor and wit used here, you need a great cast, and Andy Serkis(The Prestige, King Kong) and Reece Shearsmith(Shaun Of The Dead, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy) as the lead protagonists are fantastic... whether it's bouncing quips off of eachother, or interacting with the rest of the ecclectic characters that they run into throughout the night.  As far as deformed killers go, ""the farmer"" is a definite keeper!  He's the same basic mold as a hundred gruesome, semi-retarded, cruel and twisted(with canibalistic urges) madmen that horror fans have come to expect... but he looks and acts the part perfectly, and actually features the best looking(and by that I mean ugliest) clump of flesh for a head that I've seen in quite awhile!  The direction is excellent and I really enjoyed the musical score(which sounds like it was cut for a Tim Burton film rather than this); in the end, I'd even go as far as to say this is my favorite of all the aforementioned films listed at the top of the review... bold statement I know, but give it a chance and see what you think(at the worst you'll get a few laughs and a decent helping of grue).  As a bonus, if you do dig the film as much as I do, the DVD features a ton of quality deleted scenes and outtakes(some so good that it makes you wonder why they were removed?) that are more than worth seeing.  *VIEWERS ATTENTION*  Make sure and wait until the credits finish rolling before turning the movie off... there's a nice added surprise at the very end.",1211760000,27,2239,4.66497461928934
3103405,4,B0013D8LLS,"The Cottage is a movie you will either love or hate.. I Loved it..
 I'm a die hard slasher fan and of course I love blood and gore,but this movie was so funny and entertaining it didn't bother me that the killing didn't start untill the last half of the movie  I still loved it.

It builds great character development and the main characters two bumbling brothers""Steven and David"" are hilarious in the fact that everything they do goes wrong because they are just born losers.

Their kidnap plot goes wrong in every possible way
except they do get the kipnapee ""Tracey"" to the holding spot..a cottage that is ""let's say in the wrong neighborhood""..

When Tracey escapes after delivering much physical abuse to the weaker and more meek of the brothers she runs to a nearby farm, that's when that slasher element kicks in..
A terribly disfigured farmer is on the loose and he not in a good mood..although the comedy elements go on through the entire film, the gore is very well done and plentiful.

It's hilarious to watch Tracey go up against the killer farmer with her tough as nails attitude.

I think this will become a classic.
I highly reccomend it.",1211673600,15,1154,4.6
3103406,4,B0013D8LLS,"This movie surprised me. I have read alot of reveiws on it and they were for the most part good reveiws. I finally gave in an watched it. I was glad I did because it was very good. The story is about a botched kidnapping of a rich guys daughter by two brothers. The kidnapped girl is annoying and the two brothers are funny (one being a tough guy, the other a pure wimp). The girl eventually gets away and makes her way to the farm house next door. Unfortunatley, the man living next door is a disfigured psycho who kills people in a variety of grusome ways.

What I didn't like about the movie was that it took like an hour for the gore to start. I think that may have been the point though. The first half of the movie is a comedy and the second half is gory blood-spattered horror movie. The movie suprised me by hoe bloody it actually was. I guess thats why i liked it so much. Overall a good film and definitley worth the watch.",1210982400,4,933,4.126373626373627
3103407,5,B0013D8LLS,"From the shores of the UK comes yet another hilariously gruesome horror comedy that more than takes the piss out of anything Hollywood could ever come up with.  That being said, though, the old clich&eacute; does apply: you'll either love it or hate it.  Personally, I thought it was bloody brilliant, especially in the way it kept the dark comedy coming even after it shifts from ""bumbling criminal comedy"" to ""disfigured madman slasher"" mode.  Andy Serkis is just fantastic as the heavy whose simple kidnapping plan goes horribly, horribly wrong thanks to his incompetent partners.  Reece Shearsmith plays the whiny wanker to the hilt, Steven O'Donnell chips in mightily as a complete idiot, and Jennifer Ellison makes each of her scenes memorable, largely by way of her liberal use of adult language (some complain about her over-use of the ""c-word,"" but it's not like this movie is being marketed to children, for Pete's sake).  The legendary Doug Bradley also appears (all too briefly), and that's a pretty big deal to horror aficionados like myself.  As for Paul Andrew Williams, let me just say that he is a great writer/director; this may only be his second feature-length film, but I would say he's already graduated from ""up and coming"" to the big time.

You would think the hardest part of any kidnapping would be the actual kidnapping itself, but that's already been done as The Cottage opens its doors to the audience.  In this case, though, the actual kidnapping is the only thing the kidnappers manage to get done properly (or at all).  Poor David (Andy Serkis) finds his plans ruined time and time again by his partner - and brother - Peter (Reece Shearsmith).  Peter, unlike his brother, just isn't cut out for a life of crime, as he proves time and again.  The man is deathly afraid of moths, for heaven's sake, so he's no match at all for Tracey (Jennifer Ellison) once she wakes up.  The daughter of some kind of local goon, she's spit-in-your-eye and cuss-you-out tough.  Once she starts holding forth in that grating Cockney accent of hers, it soon becomes clear why the kidnappers are only asking one hundred thousand pounds for her return.  She strikes me as a sort of Cockney Britney Spears.

I won't go in to the laundry list of stupid mistakes that doom the kidnapping plot, but each one of them makes for great comedy.  The actors work really well together, showing great comedic timing throughout, thanks in no small part to Serkis' ability to play the heavy in such a convincing manner.  Much of it may be predictable, but it's still funny.  Then, about midway through the film, some viewers might be won't to say that they went to a dark comedy and a horror movie broke out.  The Cottage may well lose some of its audience here, as it does take its mutilation and murder seriously (in other words, there will be blood and gore), but this horror fan really ate it up.  Even underneath all of the blood and body parts, the comedic elements are still there; heck, there's even a poignant little moment of brotherly bonding at one point.  Of course, you've also got the proverbial dash of bitter irony thrown in for good measure, and a fairly successful attempt by writer/director Paul Andrew Williams to ""leave `em laughin.'""

Some might say that The Cottage doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy or a slasher.  Why can't it be both?  I would say this film knows very well what it wants to be and is very comfortable bridging the two very different genres, and that - plus the witty dialogue, great acting, and satisfying amounts of blood and gore - is what allows it to pull the whole thing off with such great &eacute;lan.  I had a ball watching this movie.",1210464000,11,3694,4.681114551083591

The Cottage blends the best of both worlds, everytime I thought I knew for sure who the killer was, they were the next one to expire. Everytime.
  The humor is very quick and dark, it's not a slapstick chuckle fest by any means but it's there and I find the humor all the more fun when a movie makes you work for it.
  The special effects are nothing off the charts but clever and interesting, it my mind it's the 'who done it' suspense that appeals to me initially about this film but it's the sly humor that makes we watch it again and again.

Then in the second half, with the introduction of the psycho, it still had many comic elements, but was much bloodier.

And it worked.  Even in the bloodiest scenes, there was a laugh.  The acting was great and the story, although done a million times (not the comic caper part) at least provided enough interest until the end.

In the first hour, the comedy of stupid guys doing stupid things gets very repetitive:  and it almost feels like, to stretch the movie out to feature length, the film-makers just grafted on a generic gore-fest to finish things up.

3103516,4,B0013D8LLS,"This Brittish horror comedy starts out as a botched kidnapping for the first half of the film. It starts with two brothers(David and Peter) kidnapping the daughter of a gangster and taking her to a cabin out in the woods. They ask for a ransom of 100 thousand which is brought to them by the girl's stepbrother(Andrew) who is also in on the kidnapping. However he failed to check the case the money was supposed to be in and realizes it was empty after reaching the cabin. Meanwhile the gangster was aware of the stepbrothers involvement and sends two asian hitmen after them. The first half of the film plays out more like a black comedy and a thriller. Peter is shown to be incompetent in his task and ends up getting his nose broken by the girl using a headbutt on him while being tied up. Peter also has a severe case of moth phobia shown through several humorous scenes of him freaking out in the presence of a moth. The stepbrother Andrew is shown to be a complete moron by not checking the suitcase for money and also buying himself a facemask that doesn't even cover his face.
David drives over to a nearby town to call the gangster and demand his money. While he is in town the first signs of a horror film start to show. The townsfolk act strangely around him and warn him about what happens to strangers in the area. David returns to the cabin to find only Andrew fainted with Peter and the girl gone. At this point it would look like the two hitmen were responsible but are later shown to be only a red-herring as a body with a slit-throat of one of them is found. David and Andrew and Peter and the girl each encounter the real killer of the film, a deformed backwoods farmer that stalks them for the rest of the film. The plot twist in the middle of this film can be compared to ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" with a hostage thriller quickly turning to a vampire film except in this it quickly turns into a hillibilly slasher type film.
While this no ""Dead Alive"" as far as blood and gore there are some good bloody kills in the movie and the gore level rises a lot in the second half. A difference this film has from other backwoods slasher films like ""Wrong Turn"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is that the killer didn't become the way he is from inbreeding or radiation like in the other films. The Farmer was deformed in a machine accident that ended up disfiguring his face. The idea of a a backwoodsman going on a killing spree isn't exactly otiginal but this movie is different enough from the usual to not make it tired or cliche.

Bloody, violent, and with kids doing things they're not supposed to. 30 minutes into this I didn't get it. Where's the horror? It was more of an action movie. Then, suddenly, the humor began. Subtle at first. It was when the horror began that I fell in love with this movie. It turned even more humorous to the point I was almost crying laughing. Literally. This is part action/part horror/mostly Brit humor. The laughs are remiscent of Dead Alive, in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this. I may watch it again with my friend in the near future.

3103523,4,B0013D8LLS,"The Cottage (2008) This comedic horror flick has a couple of Brit brothers named David (Andy Serkis-Gollum himself!) and Peter (Reece Shearsmith-Shaun of the Dead) who have the bright idea of kidnapping a local London gangster's daughter named Tracey (Jennifer Ellison-Phantom of the Opera '04). Things quickly go awry when they take her to a tiny cottage out in the boonies, mostly due to Peter, a spectacularly inept kidnapper. Eventually Tracey escapes with Peter as her prisoner, leaving David and another accomplice to pursue them into the countryside. Unfortunately they end up on a farm owned by a psychotic disfigured local serial killer and they all really start having a lousy evening. Throw in some slapstick, a couple of Asian hitmen, a few off kilter villagers, some sharp implements and some very graphic violence and you end up with this movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Mixing humor and horror can be tricky, but this movie manages it deftly, keeping the situations serious but letting the characters be funny. The whole cast is solid, but Serkis is really good, keeping his exasperation on a solid boil at all the really dim people around him. The makeup effects are top notch and the whole shebang is well orchestrated by director Paul Andrew Williams (London to Brighton).

This film is a perfect example of how to make a horror film: take 1 part droll British humor, add 2 bumbling criminals, blend in 1 foul mouthed kidnap victim, pour in several gallons of bodily fluids (preferably red), and then hack, slash, rip, rend, slice and dice with everything from knives to rakes, shovels,and pick-axes until you think you've seen all the viscera there is to see--and then add that nice little surprise twist at the end. That's what I call entertainment!

In a mere 91 minutes of unrated glee and gore writer/director Paul Andrew Williams has fashioned an entertaining and rather original film that embraces several different genres as it rushes giddily towards its climax. This is not what I would normally think of as my kind of film were I reading a synopsis of it somewhere, but when all is said and done THE COTTAGE turned out to be just what I was looking for.",1248480000,6,1040,4.621621621621622

This is absolutely one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while mainly because of the humor mixed with the gore. That is one of the best combos of all time and I wish more films like this were being made. This is a really fun flick that I am sure any one who watches it would enjoy; so far every one I know liked it. Looking at the case you would think this is a straight horror movie but this is more so a comedy more than any thing with some great performances.

David and Peter are brothers on a mission and that mission is getting money from a powerful gangster by kidnapping his daughter. Also involved in this scheme is her brother Andrew who botches the money exchange by not checking the bag. From here David storms off not noticing the hit men that are outside who followed Andrew. When he returns Andrew is knocked out and his brother is missing, as is their hostage. Little do any of them know that a disgustingly burned crazed farmer killer is on the loose and they are headed towards his place. I am sure you can see were this movie is going, every one heading to a bloody doom. What you may not expect is how funny this film is, intentionally.

These films are rare indeed with the ""Evil Dead"" series being the best as far as these kinds of films go but this film is actually really good. Writer/director Paul Andrew Williams did a great job with this film crafting a very entertaining film. His humor I guess matches mine because I thought this film was hilarious, and his direction is on point. Also did I mention that the deaths and gore in this film are also very good. Got to love when some one pulls your head off and drags it on the ground still connect to you spinal cord, Mortal Combat style ""oops e"".

All the performances are great starting with Andy Serkis as David, this dude is insanely good in this film. And with Reece Shearsmith as Peter they are perfect together as brothers; this dude is very funny in this one. Jennifer Ellison is hilarious as Tracey and is very very mean in this, poor Peter. Steven O'Donnell plays her brother Andrew and is wonderful in this film; all of these people interact very well with each other. The entire cast is very well cast and in my opinion is perfect in this film. Ever one in this is good though including the guy who plays the killer, he is not a pretty guy at all, of course he is burned all over.

This is a very fun film at least to me with all of the blood and guts and violence that takes place but it is the humor that really makes this film shine. With a very likable cast and a cool killer this is a winner for sure, to be honest I am surprised that is didn't do better. If you like surprise endings you will definitely like this one here, although I am sure some will see it coming but it is still a nice way to end things. I recommend this to any and every body as a purchase skip the rental.",1245801600,2,2891,4.192446043165468

It starts out quite funny as a pair of quarreling brothers scheme to collect a ransom from a thug by kidnapping his stripper stepdaughter.  It is a classic bumbling caper in an unexpected horror setting.  Every character made me laugh: the wuss momma's boy, the hard*ss brother, the hapless accomplice, the kick*ss & foul mouthed kidnapee, the towns folk and even the thugs sent by the kingpin.  Nothing goes as expected and I loved that!  British horror is becoming my favorite in this genre.

Once the town secret is discovered, all heck breaks loose and the movie turns into a serious horrorfest fast.  I especially liked that they made all the bits and pieces fit together.  The stellar conclusion made this movie a treat from beginning to end.

The movie takes a good hour to build the characters into well rounded people.  When killer appeared, we empathize with their plights however ridiculous they might be.

Or very, very funny, depending on which side of the screen you happen to be on. The brothers, David (Andy Serkis) and the reluctant Peter have kidnapped the step-daughter of a rich mafia type. Under normal circumstances you'd think she would be more than a tad upset. Instead she's totally ticked off and not afraid of anything, including her captors. Jennifer Ellison plays the -- I was going to say 'victim', but quite honestly, anyone in her sphere of influence is the victim, not her. While I do recommend this movie, obviously from the 4 stars I gave it, be aware the girl does have a mouth on her, meaning a LOT of foul language. She uses at least one word constantly that I am personally uncomfortable with, but at the same time she's cracking me up.

To start with, the kidnapping is about the only thing they do half-way right. From then on it's a disaster. The brothers, both, are fine actors and get into their characters in such a way they are totally believable. The kidnapee, Tracy, also is a winner. Without giving away the plot, we manage to go from a crime comedy to a...really strange twist in that it turns into a horror movie.

SPOILER ALERT: The only fault I found in the movie was the ending. I really hated it. There were so many directions in which it could have gone, that would have been so much better. Other than that, what a great freakin' movie!",1222041600,2,1498,4.483516483516484

3103536,4,B0013D8LLS,"Andy Serkis, best know for providing the voice and motion capture for Gollum in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, gets some face time in the lead role in The Cottage, a twisted black comedy/slasher film coming to DVD on May 13.  Serkis and Reece Shearsmith play feuding brothers David and Peter who have kidnapped the daughter of a strip club owner.  They've taken their hostage Tracey (Jennifer Ellison) out to a remote cottage and from there, everything that can go wrong does.  Tracey doesn't make things easy on her witless captors...she's loud, foulmouthed, and frankly scares the hell out of timid Peter.

Complicating matters is their befuddled accomplice and Tracey's half brother Andrew, who has led the boss's hitmen straight to the trio.  The three and their hostage soon find themselves on the run through the wilderness, taking refuge at nearby farmhouse.  Things go from bad to worse as they soon find out the farm is home to an ax-wielding cannibal who has just sharpened all his farm tools for his next meal.

The Cottage is a surprisingly fun little film.  While it is thrilling and filled with generous amounts of blood and gore, a requisite for any good slasher film, it never lets it's comedy elements stray too far away.  Horror comedies often turn out as campy spoofs but this is anything but campy.  The shock elements and the kills made by the enormous, disfigured killer are just as terrifying as in any horror film but director Paul Andrew Williams cleverly manages to sneak in droll bits of humor when you least expect it.  Ellison is a riot as the buxom, mouthy hostage, who is more than a match for her captors.  Her four-letter tirades allow her to steal just about any scene where she is not gagged.

Serkis, who has lent his name to various film and video game projects, finally gets to shine in a starring role in front of the camera.  As David he projects a pretense of the tough guy mastermind but with a genuine love for his hen-pecked brother.  He shows a range far beyond just doing voice-over roles.  Shearsmith is equally enjoyable as nervous and whiny Peter, always giving into his brother but eventually proving that he is strong and resourceful.  Their scenes together early in the film as they argue over things from their childhood are some of the best in the film.  It's almost a shame when the caper film turns into the horror film.  If there is a weakness it is that the film does take a bit of time to develop and move itself along to the horror portion of the film.

The Cottage is clever and doesn't take itself too seriously although horror fans won't be disappointed.  The slasher elements are better than you see in a lot of low budget films and frankly better than those in some big budget horrors.  This is one of those unknown gems that will surprise you!",1219363200,2,2809,4.620967741935484

Let me reiderate,
This movie is magnificent!!
One of the best slasher/comedies in existence!!!

1 brother enlists the help of his bumbling sibling
to help him kidnap the tough-as-nails daughter of a local mob-boss.
They bring her back to an abandoned farm,
where everything goes dreadfully arye.

The settings are spooky,
Nothing says horror like a seemingly abandoned farm.
The characters are all lovable, and quite unforgetable,
every last one of them.
The 2 brothers are great together;
as the headstrong, calculative sibling,
and his brother the whipped, nervous-wreck.
Their abductee is a wise-cracking pistol,
who doesn't take guff from no one.
She really gets the laughs bursting from your chest,
as she single-handedly takes on both her abductors.
Their inside-man is complete dolt, a moron of hilarious proportions.
And the the local villagers are unexplainably bizarre.
The laughs are subtle, but consitent,
the gore is plentifully terrific,
and the scares are of the jump-out-of-your-seat variety.
I gotta warn you,
halfway through, this bothched kidnapping tale does a complete 180,
slaps you in the face with a cold shovel,
and becomes an old-school slasher movie,
when the inhabitant of the farm returns unannounced
to find a host of intruders on his farm.
And ""Old McDonald"" he ain't
If you loved flix like,
Shaun of the Dead, Bothced, Hatchet, Behind the Mask, or Severance,
get this flick immediately.
You will not be disappointed.
Watch the trailer and see if I'm lying to you.

Old McDonald had a farm........but he traded it for an abattoir.",1215648000,11,1606,5.193050193050193
3337898,5,B0013D8LLS,"Let me say up front that for me this could be one of my favorite films of the year. It offers something unseen before, twists a genre on its ear and has more laughs than most highly touted big studio comedies have offered in years. That being said lets get to the plot.

David (Andy Serkis) and Peter (Reece Shearsmith) are brothers who are attempting to pull of a kidnapping. David works for a high level thug and sees an opportunity. Peter is a milk toast who bows to the pressures of his wife and sees a chance to get ahead. Neither of them gets what they want.

The kidnapped in question is Tracey (Jennifer Ellison), a foul mouthed spitfire who takes no guff from anyone least of all two inept kidnappers. Each opportunity that presents itself to do damage to either one she takes. Unfortunately for Peter, the more inept of the two, that means he suffers considerably from beginning to end.

They hapless pair have Tracey holed up in a cottage in the country. This setting is far from anything, including people, making it the perfect place to stow the victim. Well, victim isn't a great term to use for Tracey because she pretty much controls any and everything as we progress.  After a mishap with David's cell phone, he goes to town to use the pay phone. While there, he is warned by the strangest looking group of townsfolk you have ever seen to stay in his house.

The gags in this film move from sight gags to situational comedy that hits the mark every time. Toss in another member of the kidnappers who screws things up past the point of no return (and who offers a laugh that forced me to pause the DVD) and you have a great comedy.

BUT...it's not just a comedy. No, if you paid attention to the cover work on the shelf you caught a glimpse of some spooky looking character. Yes, this is a horror film as well! You get two movies for the price of one!

Eventually, do to Peter's bumbling, Tracey escapes with Peter in tow. Searching for the nearby town, Tracey leads them to a farm that at first seems abandoned. But the more they walk through, the more aware they become of an evil presence that lives there. And when they confront the grotesque figure of the home's owner, it offers a scare and a laugh at the same time.

The movie shifts into a different gear as we've changed from simple kidnap story to horror icon land. The home is owned by a farmer who went mad years ago and who now stalks the countryside. With Tracey and Peter captured, we now get to see David and his fellow cohort try to find and then rescue them. Instead, more mayhem ensues. And when the thug's henchmen get into the picture it's even more hilarious.

I know, I know, the movie doesn't sound funny at all. But that's because to reveal some of the funniest parts would be to ruin it for the viewer. Suffice to say that so much damage to one person has never been nearly as funny. It's like an entire season of FUNNIEST HOME VIDEO damage clips rolled into one person.

At the same time, the movie offers some of the goriest horror scenes put on film in some time. Enough so this movie would not be one I'd recommend for children. For adults though you shouldn't deny yourself the chance to see this funny film. Laughs and scares in equal measure make this one of the most original and best films of the year.",1214524800,2,3303,4.373572593800978

Enter polar-opposites(and brothers) David and Peter; stuck in the middle of nowhere and involved in a kidnapping gone awry that includes a captive that refuses to go quietly, a pair of Asian assasins, an obese partner in crime that can do little right(my favorite character too), bizarre townsfolk(with a guest spot by Pinhead himself, Doug Bradley!), and of course, when things seem like they can't get any worse, a demented and deformed maniac!  Now for the kind of dry humor and wit used here, you need a great cast, and Andy Serkis(The Prestige, King Kong) and Reece Shearsmith(Shaun Of The Dead, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy) as the lead protagonists are fantastic... whether it's bouncing quips off of eachother, or interacting with the rest of the ecclectic characters that they run into throughout the night.  As far as deformed killers go, ""the farmer"" is a definite keeper!  He's the same basic mold as a hundred gruesome, semi-retarded, cruel and twisted(with canibalistic urges) madmen that horror fans have come to expect... but he looks and acts the part perfectly, and actually features the best looking(and by that I mean ugliest) clump of flesh for a head that I've seen in quite awhile!  The direction is excellent and I really enjoyed the musical score(which sounds like it was cut for a Tim Burton film rather than this); in the end, I'd even go as far as to say this is my favorite of all the aforementioned films listed at the top of the review... bold statement I know, but give it a chance and see what you think(at the worst you'll get a few laughs and a decent helping of grue).  As a bonus, if you do dig the film as much as I do, the DVD features a ton of quality deleted scenes and outtakes(some so good that it makes you wonder why they were removed?) that are more than worth seeing.  *VIEWERS ATTENTION*  Make sure and wait until the credits finish rolling before turning the movie off... there's a nice added surprise at the very end.",1211760000,27,2239,4.66497461928934

 I'm a die hard slasher fan and of course I love blood and gore,but this movie was so funny and entertaining it didn't bother me that the killing didn't start untill the last half of the movie  I still loved it.

It builds great character development and the main characters two bumbling brothers""Steven and David"" are hilarious in the fact that everything they do goes wrong because they are just born losers.

Their kidnap plot goes wrong in every possible way
except they do get the kipnapee ""Tracey"" to the holding spot..a cottage that is ""let's say in the wrong neighborhood""..

When Tracey escapes after delivering much physical abuse to the weaker and more meek of the brothers she runs to a nearby farm, that's when that slasher element kicks in..
A terribly disfigured farmer is on the loose and he not in a good mood..although the comedy elements go on through the entire film, the gore is very well done and plentiful.

Unfortunatley, the man living next door is a disfigured psycho who kills people in a variety of grusome ways.

What I didn't like about the movie was that it took like an hour for the gore to start. I think that may have been the point though.

3337904,5,B0013D8LLS,"From the shores of the UK comes yet another hilariously gruesome horror comedy that more than takes the piss out of anything Hollywood could ever come up with.  That being said, though, the old clich&eacute; does apply: you'll either love it or hate it.  Personally, I thought it was bloody brilliant, especially in the way it kept the dark comedy coming even after it shifts from ""bumbling criminal comedy"" to ""disfigured madman slasher"" mode.  Andy Serkis is just fantastic as the heavy whose simple kidnapping plan goes horribly, horribly wrong thanks to his incompetent partners.  Reece Shearsmith plays the whiny wanker to the hilt, Steven O'Donnell chips in mightily as a complete idiot, and Jennifer Ellison makes each of her scenes memorable, largely by way of her liberal use of adult language (some complain about her over-use of the ""c-word,"" but it's not like this movie is being marketed to children, for Pete's sake).  The legendary Doug Bradley also appears (all too briefly), and that's a pretty big deal to horror aficionados like myself.  As for Paul Andrew Williams, let me just say that he is a great writer/director; this may only be his second feature-length film, but I would say he's already graduated from ""up and coming"" to the big time.

You would think the hardest part of any kidnapping would be the actual kidnapping itself, but that's already been done as The Cottage opens its doors to the audience.  In this case, though, the actual kidnapping is the only thing the kidnappers manage to get done properly (or at all).  Poor David (Andy Serkis) finds his plans ruined time and time again by his partner - and brother - Peter (Reece Shearsmith).  Peter, unlike his brother, just isn't cut out for a life of crime, as he proves time and again.  The man is deathly afraid of moths, for heaven's sake, so he's no match at all for Tracey (Jennifer Ellison) once she wakes up.  The daughter of some kind of local goon, she's spit-in-your-eye and cuss-you-out tough.  Once she starts holding forth in that grating Cockney accent of hers, it soon becomes clear why the kidnappers are only asking one hundred thousand pounds for her return.  She strikes me as a sort of Cockney Britney Spears.

I won't go in to the laundry list of stupid mistakes that doom the kidnapping plot, but each one of them makes for great comedy.  The actors work really well together, showing great comedic timing throughout, thanks in no small part to Serkis' ability to play the heavy in such a convincing manner.  Much of it may be predictable, but it's still funny.  Then, about midway through the film, some viewers might be won't to say that they went to a dark comedy and a horror movie broke out.  The Cottage may well lose some of its audience here, as it does take its mutilation and murder seriously (in other words, there will be blood and gore), but this horror fan really ate it up.  Even underneath all of the blood and body parts, the comedic elements are still there; heck, there's even a poignant little moment of brotherly bonding at one point.  Of course, you've also got the proverbial dash of bitter irony thrown in for good measure, and a fairly successful attempt by writer/director Paul Andrew Williams to ""leave `em laughin.'""

Some might say that The Cottage doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy or a slasher.  Why can't it be both?  I would say this film knows very well what it wants to be and is very comfortable bridging the two very different genres, and that - plus the witty dialogue, great acting, and satisfying amounts of blood and gore - is what allows it to pull the whole thing off with such great &eacute;lan.  I had a ball watching this movie.",1210464000,11,3694,4.681114551083591

  The humor is very quick and dark, it's not a slapstick chuckle fest by any means but it's there and I find the humor all the more fun when a movie makes you work for it.
  The special effects are nothing off the charts but clever and interesting, it my mind it's the 'who done it' suspense that appeals to me initially about this film but it's the sly humor that makes we watch it again and again.

In the first hour, the comedy of stupid guys doing stupid things gets very repetitive:  and it almost feels like, to stretch the movie out to feature length, the film-makers just grafted on a generic gore-fest to finish things up.

3338013,4,B0013D8LLS,"This Brittish horror comedy starts out as a botched kidnapping for the first half of the film. It starts with two brothers(David and Peter) kidnapping the daughter of a gangster and taking her to a cabin out in the woods. They ask for a ransom of 100 thousand which is brought to them by the girl's stepbrother(Andrew) who is also in on the kidnapping. However he failed to check the case the money was supposed to be in and realizes it was empty after reaching the cabin. Meanwhile the gangster was aware of the stepbrothers involvement and sends two asian hitmen after them. The first half of the film plays out more like a black comedy and a thriller. Peter is shown to be incompetent in his task and ends up getting his nose broken by the girl using a headbutt on him while being tied up. Peter also has a severe case of moth phobia shown through several humorous scenes of him freaking out in the presence of a moth. The stepbrother Andrew is shown to be a complete moron by not checking the suitcase for money and also buying himself a facemask that doesn't even cover his face.
David drives over to a nearby town to call the gangster and demand his money. While he is in town the first signs of a horror film start to show. The townsfolk act strangely around him and warn him about what happens to strangers in the area. David returns to the cabin to find only Andrew fainted with Peter and the girl gone. At this point it would look like the two hitmen were responsible but are later shown to be only a red-herring as a body with a slit-throat of one of them is found. David and Andrew and Peter and the girl each encounter the real killer of the film, a deformed backwoods farmer that stalks them for the rest of the film. The plot twist in the middle of this film can be compared to ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" with a hostage thriller quickly turning to a vampire film except in this it quickly turns into a hillibilly slasher type film.
While this no ""Dead Alive"" as far as blood and gore there are some good bloody kills in the movie and the gore level rises a lot in the second half. A difference this film has from other backwoods slasher films like ""Wrong Turn"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is that the killer didn't become the way he is from inbreeding or radiation like in the other films. The Farmer was deformed in a machine accident that ended up disfiguring his face. The idea of a a backwoodsman going on a killing spree isn't exactly otiginal but this movie is different enough from the usual to not make it tired or cliche.

3338020,4,B0013D8LLS,"The Cottage (2008) This comedic horror flick has a couple of Brit brothers named David (Andy Serkis-Gollum himself!) and Peter (Reece Shearsmith-Shaun of the Dead) who have the bright idea of kidnapping a local London gangster's daughter named Tracey (Jennifer Ellison-Phantom of the Opera '04). Things quickly go awry when they take her to a tiny cottage out in the boonies, mostly due to Peter, a spectacularly inept kidnapper. Eventually Tracey escapes with Peter as her prisoner, leaving David and another accomplice to pursue them into the countryside. Unfortunately they end up on a farm owned by a psychotic disfigured local serial killer and they all really start having a lousy evening. Throw in some slapstick, a couple of Asian hitmen, a few off kilter villagers, some sharp implements and some very graphic violence and you end up with this movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Mixing humor and horror can be tricky, but this movie manages it deftly, keeping the situations serious but letting the characters be funny. The whole cast is solid, but Serkis is really good, keeping his exasperation on a solid boil at all the really dim people around him.

This is absolutely one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while mainly because of the humor mixed with the gore. That is one of the best combos of all time and I wish more films like this were being made. This is a really fun flick that I am sure any one who watches it would enjoy; so far every one I know liked it. Looking at the case you would think this is a straight horror movie but this is more so a comedy more than any thing with some great performances.

David and Peter are brothers on a mission and that mission is getting money from a powerful gangster by kidnapping his daughter. Also involved in this scheme is her brother Andrew who botches the money exchange by not checking the bag. From here David storms off not noticing the hit men that are outside who followed Andrew. When he returns Andrew is knocked out and his brother is missing, as is their hostage. Little do any of them know that a disgustingly burned crazed farmer killer is on the loose and they are headed towards his place. I am sure you can see were this movie is going, every one heading to a bloody doom. What you may not expect is how funny this film is, intentionally.

These films are rare indeed with the ""Evil Dead"" series being the best as far as these kinds of films go but this film is actually really good. Writer/director Paul Andrew Williams did a great job with this film crafting a very entertaining film. His humor I guess matches mine because I thought this film was hilarious, and his direction is on point. Also did I mention that the deaths and gore in this film are also very good. Got to love when some one pulls your head off and drags it on the ground still connect to you spinal cord, Mortal Combat style ""oops e"".

All the performances are great starting with Andy Serkis as David, this dude is insanely good in this film. And with Reece Shearsmith as Peter they are perfect together as brothers; this dude is very funny in this one. Jennifer Ellison is hilarious as Tracey and is very very mean in this, poor Peter. Steven O'Donnell plays her brother Andrew and is wonderful in this film; all of these people interact very well with each other. The entire cast is very well cast and in my opinion is perfect in this film. Ever one in this is good though including the guy who plays the killer, he is not a pretty guy at all, of course he is burned all over.

This is a very fun film at least to me with all of the blood and guts and violence that takes place but it is the humor that really makes this film shine. With a very likable cast and a cool killer this is a winner for sure, to be honest I am surprised that is didn't do better. If you like surprise endings you will definitely like this one here, although I am sure some will see it coming but it is still a nice way to end things. I recommend this to any and every body as a purchase skip the rental.",1245801600,2,2891,4.192446043165468

It starts out quite funny as a pair of quarreling brothers scheme to collect a ransom from a thug by kidnapping his stripper stepdaughter.

I am pretty sure this one was just lost on me. I am not a big UK-released-movie/tv fan, so that might be the most of it. I was bored. This goes into the category of ""fell asleep watching it and woke up and it was STILL on"". Prior reviews on here that say you'll either love it or hate it were dead on.",1224288000,3,432,3.811111111111111
3338031,4,B0013D8LLS,"and poor ol' Peter (Reece Shearsmith) is one of them. The guts of the story is a kidnapping gone terribly, terribly wrong. Or very, very funny, depending on which side of the screen you happen to be on. The brothers, David (Andy Serkis) and the reluctant Peter have kidnapped the step-daughter of a rich mafia type. Under normal circumstances you'd think she would be more than a tad upset. Instead she's totally ticked off and not afraid of anything, including her captors. Jennifer Ellison plays the -- I was going to say 'victim', but quite honestly, anyone in her sphere of influence is the victim, not her. While I do recommend this movie, obviously from the 4 stars I gave it, be aware the girl does have a mouth on her, meaning a LOT of foul language. She uses at least one word constantly that I am personally uncomfortable with, but at the same time she's cracking me up.

To start with, the kidnapping is about the only thing they do half-way right. From then on it's a disaster. The brothers, both, are fine actors and get into their characters in such a way they are totally believable. The kidnapee, Tracy, also is a winner. Without giving away the plot, we manage to go from a crime comedy to a...really strange twist in that it turns into a horror movie.

SPOILER ALERT: The only fault I found in the movie was the ending. I really hated it. There were so many directions in which it could have gone, that would have been so much better. Other than that, what a great freakin' movie!",1222041600,2,1498,4.483516483516484
3338032,2,B0013D8LLS,"I read the reviews of this movie, and as a big fan of British comedy, I thought I was going to really like it. I added it to my Netflicks list and just gott it last week. All I can say is that I'm really glad I only rented it.
It started out great! David and Peter kind-a reminded me of Del Boy and Rodney from Only Fools and Horses. Then, their kidnap victom came on came on the scene. Long story short, the profanity just got too much, and I simply couldn't finish watching this. I made it to the point where Tracy and Peter found the trapdoor, and that was all I could handle. I really wanted to like this, but its going back to Netflicks tomorrow. If the language doesn't bother you, though, I'm sure you'll enjoy this.",1221436800,2,723,4.134751773049645
3338033,4,B0013D8LLS,"Andy Serkis, best know for providing the voice and motion capture for Gollum in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, gets some face time in the lead role in The Cottage, a twisted black comedy/slasher film coming to DVD on May 13.  Serkis and Reece Shearsmith play feuding brothers David and Peter who have kidnapped the daughter of a strip club owner.  They've taken their hostage Tracey (Jennifer Ellison) out to a remote cottage and from there, everything that can go wrong does.  Tracey doesn't make things easy on her witless captors...she's loud, foulmouthed, and frankly scares the hell out of timid Peter.

Complicating matters is their befuddled accomplice and Tracey's half brother Andrew, who has led the boss's hitmen straight to the trio.  The three and their hostage soon find themselves on the run through the wilderness, taking refuge at nearby farmhouse.  Things go from bad to worse as they soon find out the farm is home to an ax-wielding cannibal who has just sharpened all his farm tools for his next meal.

The Cottage is a surprisingly fun little film.  While it is thrilling and filled with generous amounts of blood and gore, a requisite for any good slasher film, it never lets it's comedy elements stray too far away.  Horror comedies often turn out as campy spoofs but this is anything but campy.  The shock elements and the kills made by the enormous, disfigured killer are just as terrifying as in any horror film but director Paul Andrew Williams cleverly manages to sneak in droll bits of humor when you least expect it.  Ellison is a riot as the buxom, mouthy hostage, who is more than a match for her captors.  Her four-letter tirades allow her to steal just about any scene where she is not gagged.

Serkis, who has lent his name to various film and video game projects, finally gets to shine in a starring role in front of the camera.  As David he projects a pretense of the tough guy mastermind but with a genuine love for his hen-pecked brother.  He shows a range far beyond just doing voice-over roles.  Shearsmith is equally enjoyable as nervous and whiny Peter, always giving into his brother but eventually proving that he is strong and resourceful.  Their scenes together early in the film as they argue over things from their childhood are some of the best in the film.  It's almost a shame when the caper film turns into the horror film.  If there is a weakness it is that the film does take a bit of time to develop and move itself along to the horror portion of the film.

The Cottage is clever and doesn't take itself too seriously although horror fans won't be disappointed.  The slasher elements are better than you see in a lot of low budget films and frankly better than those in some big budget horrors.  This is one of those unknown gems that will surprise you!",1219363200,2,2809,4.620967741935484
3338034,5,B0013D8LLS,"Honestly... this is the most offbeat experience one can hope for. It is hilarious!

The setting is England.
Three idiotic morons kidnap a girl and hide her in their cottage somewhere in the country. While the girl reveals herself as a foul-mouthed, nose breaking brat the three idiots manage to mess up the kidnapping in any way they can. BUT what nobody knows is that their neighbor is a deformed super murderer who will welcome new victims.

The film actually starts as a full comedy as very early on we clearly see that the kidnapped girl is much more dangerous than her captors. One of them, Reece Shearsmith from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-League-of-Gentlemen-The-Collection/dp/B0007Y0982/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The League of Gentlemen - The Collection</a>&nbsp;can't get one right and is simply hilarious as a man with phobia of moths (whenever moths appear, it's a non-stop laughter).

Then they all get involved with the monstrous killer... and things get bloody and violent. But still very funny.

This film is truly a unique experience and deserves to be seen. Almost everything here is right. Don't miss it!",1217808000,2,1174,5.578651685393258

8250039,5,B0013D8LLS,"This is pretty typical British humor which I enjoy. While the plot sounds formula they threw in twists and unexpected turns here and there that elevated it above the formula. The crook who knows what he is doing is hooked with two incompetent fellows who don't have a clue as to what they are doing. One is the real crook's brother and the other is the half-brother of the young lady they have kidnapped. It is hard to describe this movie as the humor is situational. The serial killer is rather stereo-typical sad to say but with some minor twists that help off-set the obvious. The acting is well done. Despite the gore, throughout the movie I was either laughing or smiling. Hint to kidnappers: Make sure you are tougher than the young lady you are kidnapping...And don't hide out near a maniacal killer's home.",1526169600,,814,4.620689655172414

It starts off as more of a comedy thriller, think a Guy Ritchie movie but maybe a little less violence, but morphs into a brutal (although still hilarious) horror movie in its last half. Andy Serkis gives a stand out performance as career criminal, David, and there's even a brief but fun cameo by Doug Bradley (Pinhead). I recommend this to everyone.
