8176241,4,B000NA1WF4,"Neither of these films are my favorite horror films, but both have an interesting story line and talented cast.
Gothika is a fantastic ghost story, with a dark, sinister twist.  Queen of the Damned is an all-out vampire film, based on Anne Rice's Vampire novels about her dark, yet lovable anti-hero, Lestat.  Both films will satisfy a fan of gore-fest films, as the both deal with death at the hands of supernatural forces.
Queen of the Damned is not as good as Gothika with regard to plot, but the story line's path as the film plays out makes up for some of that lack-luster and the late singer/actress Aaliyah's role as Akasha, the vampire queen, gives the film some definite spice.  Gothika tale of a vengeful spirit, seeking justice through the possession of an innocent 3rd party is a story with many twists and turns.
Overall, this double feature is perfect for fans of the multiple horror sub-genres which their plots revolve around",1503792000,,941,4.7607361963190185
8176242,5,B000NA1WF4,"At first I was looking for ""Gothika"". Then I realized it was the same price to buy both. Good decision",1281744000,,102,4.15
8176243,4,B000NA1WF4,I liked both movies but I was looking for the widescreen version of this dvd.,1275696000,,77,4.2
8176244,4,B000NA1WF4,"I have always liked Halle Berry and she doesn't disappoint in Gothica. Working in the Psychiatic Ward in a prison, she deals with all kinds of disorders. On her way home one night, she sees a girl in the middle of the road and stops to help. When she wakes up, it's days later and she's now in one of the cells at the prison she worked at. Worse than that, she finds out that she's responsible for the murder of her husband (Charles S. Dutton) and can't believe, or remember killing him.

There are a lot of twists and turns, and if you like paranornal thrillers, you will love this film too.

Queen of the Damned is pretty good if you mostly pay attention to the costumes and special effects. I'm not a huge fan of Anne Rice novels, although I have read a few. Stuart Townsend plays Lastat, while nice to look at, is not up to Tom Cruses' performance in ""Interview with a Vampire"". However, the apperance of Aaliyah as Akasha is great. She's strong, evil and totally steals the show. Worth the watch and the purchase.",1262995200,,1018,4.352631578947369

8176247,5,B000NA1WF4,"I bought this DVD for Queen of the Damned (awesome vampire movie!), but Gothika was an added bonus. What could go wrong when you settle in with some popcorn watching the great Robert Downey Jr.? He makes any average movie so much better. Did I mention the price of this set? Who needs BlueRay anyway? Thanks Amazon!",1214956800,,315,4.543859649122807
