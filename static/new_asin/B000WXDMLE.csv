2992789,4,B000WXDMLE,"First, a warning to fans of Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, the more popular of the Simon Pegg starred films: this isn't a film that would seemed to have come from the same team of film makers, that is despite the fact that Simon Pegg did help develop the story for this film.  There are lines of humor and jokes in this film that hint at the playful spirit shown in those earlier films, but as a whole this movie is much more in the ""charming"" category where those films were done in a different manner entirely.  Perhaps the difference is David Schwimmer's direction, perhaps it's the screen play, or perhaps Pegg was intentionally aiming for charming in an effort to widen his range and appeal, either way the result here is a film that fans of the earlier movies may be disappointed in.

If you can get past the idea that this film is going to be charming, rather than more satirical and crude, well, you find that the result isn't that bad.  5 star material, not so much for me, and really probably more in the 3.5 range overall, but I'm rounding up a bit as I happen to think charming isn't such a bad thing to be.

Simon Pegg plays Dennis, a man that ditched his pregnant girlfriend (Libby, played by Thande Newton) at the altar.  Years later he finds himself working as a security guard that can't run more than a few blocks to try to catch the shoplifter that ripped off the shop we works at.  Ah, the difference a few years, many cigarettes and not so healthy eating makes for.

Dennis is a not so dependable father to the son that Libby has been raising by herself, and meanwhile Libby has found another potential love interest (played by Hank Azaria) who seems to make Dennis all the more sad over the love he lost.

Eventually (not so far along really), Dennis decides that he'll run in the big marathon to impress Libby, not just because he wants to impress her, but because his competitor for Libby's interest is going to run in the event.  Can a guy whose life is such a mess, not to mention the lack of being physically fit, actually run a marathon?  That's what you'll be watching to find out. :-)

There are several crude jokes mixed into the film along the way, and several minutes of the same mixed into the outtakes that are included on the Blu-ray disc.  Nothing that is that harsh, but those that are easily offended should consider themselves warned.  A few instances of rough language also help get the film that rating it sports, so again if you are easily offended perhaps you're better off looking elsewhere.

Picture quality on the Blu-ray is nice.  The soundtrack is enjoyable and the musical selections that are included fit nicely where they are placed.  Give this romantic comedy a chance to charm you and you may find it more of a winner than you expected.  Certainly worth a rental, not far from the buy it rating.",1222300800,17,2849,4.435700575815739
2992790,5,B000WXDMLE,Simon Pegg in another hilarious movie. Easily as funny as hot fuzz or shaun of the dead.,1222300800,,88,4.235294117647059
2992791,5,B000WXDMLE,"Simon Pegg is usually best in his more crude comedies like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  This one was skeptical because it's more romantic.  But man, was it awesome.  Not full of those hard laughs that leave you laughing after the movie, but more feel good laughs.  I highly recommend this movie and you should go out and buy it now!",1222128000,,336,4.285714285714286
2992792,5,B000WXDMLE,"This movie was released over a year ago and I've seen it four times since.  I absolutely love this movie.  Great casting for this movie, and a great story, if you ask me.  I don't want to give to much of the movie away but it pretty much starts with Dennis (Simon Pegg), and Libby (Thandie Newton) about to get married, but Dennis gets cold feet, and on the day of his wedding while he's up in his bedroom he decides to go out the window and run away.  Then, fastforward to his future where he is a fat security guard for a clothing store.  He's still in his son's life, which is a good thing, but not really in Libby's life.  So anyway, Libby finds a new boyfriend, Whit (Hank Azaria), and obviously Dennis doesn't like this.  Dennis now feels that he must prove himself so his one true love will take him back, and in his eyes, that means completing the marathon, showing Libby that he can commit and complete something in his life.  He teams up with his best friend, and his landlord, which help him by keeping him motivated and by being there to support him at the marathon.

I honestly found this to be quite a good movie and can't wait for the DVD so I can watch it 10 more times before the year is up.  This is one of those movies I'm going to have everyone I know watch.  Definitely a good story, and great acting.  I'm quite suprised this movie only has a small amount of reviews.  I knew it flew under the radar, but I didn't know it flew under the radar that much.  But then again, it hasn't even been released on DVD so I guess we'll have to wait and see.",1221523200,,1567,4.145695364238411
2992793,5,B000WXDMLE,"Just watched ""Run Fat Boy Run""! One word ""hilarious""!

Great comedy by ""David Schwimmer"" (you know, ROSS from Friends). The lead role is Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), he was great, as usual, in his role as the underachieving dad and ex-fiance of Thandie Newton (The Truth About Charlie), also starring Hank Azaria (Along Came Polly, Mystery Men)as Thandie Newtons ""perfect"" new boyfriend!

I didn't have high hopes for this movie going in, but it was excellent.

Very, very funny. This movie will definitely brighten your day / night!

Highly recommended!",1216425600,2,567,5.0
2992794,5,B000WXDMLE,"i love this movie, as a faithful devoted husband and loving father currently going thru a divorce from an alcoholic, abusive wife i get this movie! the fears simon peggs character suffers thru is easily identifyable to decent men everywhere. the fear that once the child is born the wife will change and the beautiful relationship theyhave as a couple will not carry on as a family and she'll change. simon pegg is hilarious in his uncomfortable situations and the side characters are well cast.some of the situations will make you laugh out loud. however what makes the movie work is Thandie Newton as the jilted fiance. she brings the character to life and she is the dream woman and wife that makes his pursuit well worthwile. she is the wife that will not change  and is unselfish and treasures the relationship with her husband as well as they as a family. its her character that makes his endeavor all the more rewarding. see this movie,yes its  predictable, but its the characters that make it come alive.",1215734400,2,1012,4.711864406779661
2992795,4,B000WXDMLE,"I too think, that the title ""Run Fat Boy Run"" is quite amusing and very apropriate for the film. Let me, in response to another reviewers question ""who would pay money to see a fat boy run?"" ask: who wouldn't?

The story is neither original nor complicated. At their wedding, Simon Pegg's character gets cold feet and takes off without explanation, leaving his pregnant girlfriend behind. 5 years down the line he, now a fat, pathtic looser without the mone to pay the rent, realises that he actually left the love of his life behind that day. She has found a rich, handsome, athletic American played very well by Hank Azaria, and has no need for her former fiance. So to win her back, Pegg must compete against his American competitor in a marathon race. Chaos and hilarity ensues.

Simon Pegg, who is nothing short of a comic genius, plays the gormless loser so joyously well, and adds to it his incredible sense of physical comedy. His American rival is in turn played expertly by Mr. Azaria, who somehow manages to portray a character that at the same time is absolutely charming, wonderful, and thoroughly unlikeable. The always funny Dylan Moran adds his own interesting personae to the character Gordon, the best friend of Peggs character. Also a guest visit from Little Britains David Walliams, makes for a nice little surprise.

I'm not the biggest fan of director David Schwimmer, but I must admit that he's done a decent job with this one. The score, scenery, production, and all the rest of it is also done quite well.

So in conclusion I'll say, that while ""Run Fat Boy Run"" is not in any way original or spellbinding, it does provide some solid laughs and is never boring. Definitely recommendable.",1208217600,33,1712,4.7157190635451505
2992796,5,B000WXDMLE,"I actually think that the title of this film sums up its humour, and hopefully its not too British for US sensitivities.

Simon Pegg finally get to be funny in his own right (as opposed to playing against Nick Frosts silly boy routine) - and he does it very well.

No need to outline the story - just to say if you want to go see a film that will make you smile, whilst willing the 'hero' on then, this is just the film for you.",1205798400,5,428,3.9651162790697674

2992799,5,B000WXDMLE,"Honestly, yes, the plot is a worn one. It's ""been done"" tons of times before but sometimes, you find a version that's a bit more delightful than you'd expect. Pegg really brings a bit of humanity to the dramatic moments, but doesn't shirk the campy parts, of course. Worth a watch.",1494720000,,281,4.529411764705882

2992819,3,B000WXDMLE,"Decent movie that I watched for the second time (after watching a under-rated/watched Man Up, also staring Simon Pegg).

One thing I noticed on the second viewing was that it was much harder to like Simon Pegg's character the second time around, and much harder to hate his ""nemesis"" Hank Azaria. Simon's characters lack of maturity (he's basically a man-child) and the fact that he seems incapable of accepting responsibility for his actions (he even comments on why his ex-finance was still mad at him for leaving her at the alter, after all it was ages ago). Hank on the other hand genuinely wants to be there for his future step-child, and while he's clearly one of those super annoying type-A-has-to-be-the-best-at-everything types i feel they really just ratchet up his douchey factor to make Simon seem more likable than anything else. Feels forced.

Comedy-wise the writing is good, but I feel the character development was lacking.

In the end it's a good movie with some solid laughs (can't go wrong with nut-shots).",1471305600,,1026,4.953488372093023

No you won't learn too much information about running a marathon. For that purpose, you need to watch some other documentary.

2992922,5,B000WXDMLE,"I had no clue who Simon Pegg was until I found this movie and have been a fan of his ever since. I actually got the movie because I am a Thandie Newton fan and had never seen her in a comedy. Mind you, her role is not comedic at all, but this story is so cute and all of the characters do a great job. I also discovered Dylan Moran (I hope I got the name right - he's Thandie's cousin in the movie). SO FUNNY!

The movie is about Pegg who stood up his girlfriend (Newton) at their wedding while she was pregnant with his baby. The story then fast forwards to 5 or 6 years later when they've moved on and made their arrangements to co-parent, etc... Newton has a ""perfect in every way"" boyfriend (played by Hank Azaria) who is getting serious with her, and Pegg wants to win her back by running in the London Marathon (because the boyfriend runs marathons). The story is funny, clean and has a great ending. It lags just a tad in the middle for me (because I am not a fan of sports at ALL (except basketball) and the whole running thing was a bit taxing), but not so much that I would turn it off. I thoroughly enjoyed the film.",1388880000,2,1127,4.076576576576577

Simon is good without Nick Frost, but a part of the Cornetto trilogy this is not.  There are some funny bits and some heart to the film, but there was just nothing to qualify it as overly memorable.  I chuckled, but didn't laugh out loud.

2992949,3,B000WXDMLE,"Run Fat Boy Run(released Sept/07) is a tepid comedy starring,among others,Simon Pegg as Dennis Doyle,Thandie Newton as Libby Odell,Hank Azaria as Whit,Dylan Moran as Gordon,Harish Patel as Mr. Goshdashtidar and India de Beaufort as Maya Goshdashtidar. The film is full of typical Simon Pegg type humour like the quote from the title. This is when Simon is looking at his rival's private parts. Other moments he is jumping into bushes,is in a tree with his son making rude noises to annoy passers by or scratching his privates with a mannequin hand. And,it is yet another story about a recalcitrant father going from a bad place and coming back to win the admiration of his son and his ex. I cannot say there is anything in this film to lift it above the ordinary.
The story finds Pegg as an out of shape security guard. It is his wedding day and he's scared stiff about marrying his already pregnant bride. At the last minute he makes a run for it and becomes an instant bachelor with a son who lives and grows up with his mother,and who he sees off and on. Fast forward and Pegg now lives in a basement flat and is behind in his rent. His best friend is his ex's cousin and he is a heavy gambler. Five years have gone by and his wife is now seeing an American(Azaria).Pegg isn't too pleased but there is nothing he can really do. When Pegg finds out that Azaria is running in the London marathon,Pegg decides to also go for it,to impress his ex and son.
His ex's cousin bets heavily on him and his Indian landlord also pitches in to help. Now all they need is a sponsor,the only way Pegg can enter the marathon in the less than three week time frame he has. The three try and con a big corporation into supporting them,but when they ask for their charity number it is all over. On the way downstairs the wheel chair they were using gets away from them and it hits a man. It turns out the man was going to be running the marathon but can't now. Pegg gets his sponsor,the erectile dysfunction association. Pegg's training continues but at a party his ex is proposed to by Azaria and she accepts. Disgusted Pegg calls it all off. However a talk with his son later,and persuasion by his friend who is in debt up to his eyeballs,and the marathon is back on.
The day of the race comes and Pegg barely makes it on time. Pegg starts trying to pull away from the pack but Azaria keeps up with him. Azaria trips Pegg and they both go down. Azaria ends up in the hospital while Pegg decides to carry on,with a sprained ankle. It takes him many hours but he manages to make it to the end,with a bevy of reporters and supporters with him all the way. The film ends as Pegg is enjoying his new healthy life style(he runs everyday now) and seems on the verge of getting back together with his ex.
There are very few laughs in this film,and goodness knows Pegg tries his best with what he has. But most of humour elicits mostly slight smiles and nothing much more. And of course there has to be a bad guy and a""serious"" side to the story,but it is all contrived and been there,done that stuff. I had to shake my head at the scene where the three are leaving the corporation and the wheel chair goes down the steps. We knew it was going to hit someone or something,but when the fellow they hit says he was a runner,had a sponsor and couldn't run,well...that was about as contrived and unimaginative as it comes. The film is chock full of stuff like this.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette,commentary,deleted scenes,a gag reel and the trailer. Both w/s and full screen versions are on this disc.
All in all a disappointing Pegg effort. The script is mundane and the jokes,on the whole,fall flat throughout.",1361836800,,3765,4.410919540229885

The advice he tries to give Simon's character to try and lift his morale comes out in a really messed up way... especially when he was talking about his own dead wife!! What a muppet!

It's definitely  worth seeing. It's alot better than Hot Fuzz, which I felt had too outlandish a story to be enduring. On the other hand I loved Shaun of the Dead and what is more outlandish than zombies? One interesting thing about this movie is the title illustrates the different world views of what ""fat"" is. Simon Pegg IS fat. Some Americans would think he's not fat at all, but that's cause we're used to thinking ""fat"" when we see obese, hyper obese or even morbidly hyper obese people. In other words, we're the fattest nation on Earth cause of our polluted food system. Go Organic!!!!",1281744000,,747,4.452554744525547

2992970,4,B000WXDMLE,"The unfortunately titled Run Fatboy Run comes from that risky, murky water where comedians decide they want to be sweeties. Sometimes, this can be golden: Simon Pegg, who stars as the slobbering, unreconstructed-on-the-way-to-construction hero, Dennis, is particularly talented at juggling the flatulent with the heartwarming. However, it's a dangerous idea, as comedians can sometimes get derailed on their way to sensitive, saccharine warmth, and end up in the horribly, gouge-your-eyes-out maudlin. For example, Robin Williams in a number of films (though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Dreams-May-Come/dp/B00007GZR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Dreams May Come</a>&nbsp;may be the most notorious), or Adam Sandler's nauseating self-pity in the gratingly unfunny&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-People/dp/B002PLPQLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny People</a>.

Adam Sandler's actually a good match for Simon Pegg, as they both specialize in frat boy (or, well, the British equivalent) humo(u)r that is underscored by a genuine authenticity - they are both adept at playing man-children. Run Fatboy Run introduces us to Dennis (Simon Pegg) on the day of his wedding: his gorgeous, pregnant bride-to-be, Libby (Thandie Newton), chats with her amiable cousin, Gordon (Dylan Moran), and Dennis? He's the one sprinting down the street, away from the garden party. Fast forward five years and fifteen kilos, and Dennis, now a dumpy security guard, is sprinting after a (incidentally hilarious!) transvestite shoplifter. He lives in a basement flat, where he is periodically heckled by his (incidentally hilarious) landlord, Mr. Goshdashtidar (Harish Patel, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Son-the-Fanatic/dp/6305692629/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Son the Fanatic</a>), for perpetually forgetting his keys.

When Dennis visits Libby to pick up their son, Jake (Matthew Fenton), he is introduced to Libby's new boyfriend: Whit (Hank Azaria). Whit is everything Dennis is not: a successful hedge fund manager, he showers Libby and Jake with expensive gadgets and affection, is breezily self-confident in a very American way, and runs charity marathons for fun. Dennis, privately, seethes. He decides to remedy his broken heart and dead-end life by challenging Whit to his own marathon. Everyone does a lot of scoffing and snorting with laughter - what, Dennis? the fat guy? a marathon? - and Dennis, meanwhile, with his gambling buddy, Gordon, and Mr. Goshdashtidar, gets down to training. The rest of the film follows the usual course.

Run Fatboy Run generally avoids some of the disasterous pitfalls which threaten a movie like this, mostly because, as we said above, Simon Pegg has a good handle on balancing sympathy with humor, and we have a very high tolerance for seeing him be sad before we consider it over-the-top and indulgent. We think this is generally because Pegg sparingly uses that most deadliest of comic weapons - irony - and hence never distances himself from the character. Yes, Dennis is a clumsy, Homer Simpson-esque buffoon, but he's also, always, human. Everything is played straight. Example: when Dennis, in usual Disney-style manipulation, momentarily loses his son, there is real horror and panic. It's a credit to Pegg, who specializes in airy comedy that's been deep fried in pop culture, that he is actually a very authentic actor indeed.

Other cast members, such as Dylan Moran and Harish Patel, have a good ol' time and offer charming support to the central conceit. For the most part, the film succeeds because it feels more like a Nick Hornby movie (we were specifically reminded of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/About-a-Boy-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JL7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">About a Boy (Widescreen Edition)</a>), though things spiral slightly out of control with the climax, which becomes so sticky with sugar that we had to go wash our eyeballs. All in all, it's not a memorable film and Pegg's characteristic surrealism is missing, but it's a modest and inoffensive heart-shaped fluff piece. We can handle that.

2992977,4,B000WXDMLE,"We liked this movie for a light Saturday date night w/popcorn in front of the TV. The best laughs, in my opinion, come from the moments that catch you off guard---the little subtle gestures like when the cousin shows up with his hair in a towel after sneaking into the coveted bath at a swanky birthday party. The least funny were the really juvenile jokes showing body fluids. It was almost as if two people wrote the movie---one going for subtle and one going for over-the-top-in-your-face.

At the same time, there are some quite serious moments. The music slows and swells (the soundtrack is really schizophrenic), and the main character (fat boy) seems to be going through some real heartbreak. Parts of the movie are quite touching, but then it goes back to over-the-top silliness again. They also could have made the story more plausible---why did he have only 3 weeks to train? Why not make it 8 weeks or something that would have made a bit more sense?

My advice would be to rent it and just go with the dumb jokes and take what you can from the rest.  Hugh Grant and his crew would have done a better job (think how smoothly 4 Weddings flows), but this is still worth the cost of admission.",1265068800,,1201,4.525345622119816
2992978,4,B000WXDMLE,"As others have said, this movie is no Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. It is, however, a decent movie.

Simon Pegg plays a guy who left his preggers girlfriend at the altar. Skip forward a few years and he's an out of shape security guard at a mall. His ex-girlfriend is seeing another man who is in decently good shape--but he's a tool. This kind of sets off some competition in Simon Pegg's character and he decides to get in shape too. Dylan Moran (of Black Books fame) plays a friend that has a gambling problem, and has bet that Simon's character can finish a marathon. ...and Simon's trying ever-so-hard to get his woman back, which he realizes he should have never left, while training like mad to be able to do this marathon run.

I thought the best scenes were the ones with Dylan Moran in them. He basically plays the same character he did in Black Books (which is a great 3 season BBC show... Check it out!). Simon Pegg is pretty good in this, but it's not the same as you're probably used to from this actor.

It's worth a watch, but you may never watch it again. Once will probably be enough for you. Maybe rent/Netflix it instead.",1262649600,,1142,4.327102803738318
2992979,4,B000WXDMLE,"The sheer awesomeness of SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ - and let's not forget SPACED - has garnered Simon Pegg a lot of well-deserved fan love. RUN FAT BOY RUN rolls around and it's a romantic comedy and it's a lesser effort, compared to what Pegg's wrought before. Doesn't mean it's not good. It, in fact, is very funny and has a sentimental core and an earnest undercurrent.

Simon Pegg is really great at embodying that likable career slacker with whom most of us can identify. It doesn't hurt that Pegg also demonstrates a sharp sense of humor and delivery. The start of RUN FAT BOY RUN showcases Simon Pegg at perhaps his most despicable, his character Dennis Doyle having cold feet on his wedding day and literally running away from his pregnant fiancee Libby (Thandie Newton, perfectly winning). Five years later finds Dennis a bit worse for wear, his life spiraling nowhere. He's put on a bit of weight and, in his security guard gig at a women's clothing store, he has extraordinary amounts of trouble chasing down shoplifters who taunt him as they sprint away. Dennis defensively retorts: ""I'm not fat! I'm unfit!""

Worse news. For the past five years Dennis has been trying to get back into his ex-fiancee's good graces, but apparently being abandoned at the altar takes a lot of making up for. Dennis gets along really well with his five-year-old son who easily forgives his dad's bump of irresponsibility, and hanging out with his kid may be the only consistently good thing in Dennis's life. And now there's a new romantic gent in Libby's life and, as played by Hank Azaria, this cat is successful and insufferably smug and obsessed with keeping fit, except that once you hear his name is ""Whit,"" you right away suspect that he may be a bit of a git. Whit has this tradition of running the marathon (which, by the way, Brits pronounce weirdly) and he runs this for charity. Dennis somehow takes it into his brain that if he also can not only run but finish in the same marathon, then this in some way will validate him in Libby's eyes, maybe even win her back. But there is a huge, gaping chasm between intent and action. Dennis is woefully, pathetically out of shape, his motivation very much slacker-sized. The only question seems to be how long before the guy gives up and falls back into his ambition-free habits.

RUN FAT BOY RUN is powered by Simon Pegg's presence, but it also really benefits from the other offbeat characters. Dennis Doyle can thank his lucky stars that he has friends as staunch as Gordon (Dylan Moran) and Mr. Goshdashtidar (Harish Patel), no matter that they are pretty unconventional dudes, especially Gordon who seems to disdain wearing bottoms.

The film expands beyond its jokey fratboy trappings, somewhere along the way becoming a heartfelt examination of a man who finally gets a good look at himself in the mirror, glimpses the ruins of his life, and realizes that he's run out of excuses. Dennis sets out to better himself, at first often stumbling and faltering but later breaking thru that wall. The film manipulates you, sure, but Simon Pegg is so good at this thing he does that you go along with the cheering and clapping at the proper moments, even if you do see these moments coming early on. And, just for a mo, let's not dwell too much on that, in this picture, competing in a marathon becomes a metaphor for a man's finally fully entering adulthood. Because the goofy kid in me just rose up and he refuses to pooh-pooh the film's obligatory fratboy sensibilities. I laughed my ess off during that sequence with the nasty, pus-full blister. ""That was the second most disgusting fluid I've ever had in my eye!"" is the punchline to this gag, and I almost put a SPOILER banner a sentence back, except that, c'mon, how did you not see this coming?",1261267200,,3804,4.647845468053492

2992983,4,B000WXDMLE,"David Schwimmer (yes, ""Ross"" from friends"") makes his directorial debut with this film and doesn't do a bad job (note to Mr. Schwimmer - stay on that side of the camera). Simple story : Boy leaves pregnant girlfriend at the altar. Several years later, boy realizes what he was missing, but girlfriend has new boyfriend who is about to run a marathon. Boy decides the only way to get her back is to run against the new boyfriend...etc etc.

It's more detailed than that, but you get the gist. Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) plays the deadbeat Dennis Doyle to perfection. He's just go that ""every man"" look about him which suits the part. Hank Azaria (Godzilla, Mystery Men) plays his nemesis very well too.

For someone who has not been back to London in many years, this film felt a little like a trip down memory lane. The films is set all over the city and is diverse in locations and cast members. Doyle is a loser. He's a security guard in a women's underwear store who can't even catch a shoplifter. His decision to run in a Nike challenge (product placement galore) is motivated purely by a desire to get his girlfriend back from her all-American stud boyfriend. The Anglo-American rivalry is set, though it's not transparently obvious in the conflict (ie no one resorts to calling anyone ""brit"" or ""yank""), but it's a clash of lifestyle, culture and egos. The film pokes gentle fun at everyone, from the stereotypical characters to the over-the-top media coverage of the marathon's dramatic climax.

The ending is perfect, and I was surprised that the tension towards the end really worked well. I think Schwimmer has a promising directorial career ahead. The film doesn't have the ""silly"" humor or the laugh-upon-laugh of ""Shaun of the Dead"". It's a little more subtle, but just as, if not more satisfying.

Well worth watching.",1248566400,,1836,4.728125

Dennis gets a case of the jitters on his wedding day and takes off at a sprint, leaving his heavily-pregnant bride on the altar. Fast forward several years and we find Dennis working as a security agent in a lingerie store and living in a squalid bedsit, smoking heavily, almost broke, getting fat and barely involved with his son. By now, he's realized he's still in love with the woman he abandoned, but she's become involved with Whit, a rich, way-too-smooth, slimy, hedge fund manager from Chicago who also happens to be a marathon runner played with appropriate creepiness by Hank Azaria. Dennis has the dum idea that if he can run the marathon and beat Whit, he could win back his beloved.
As a real runner, I found it laughable that an unfit smoker could get in shape for the marathon in three weeks. But of course, one shouldn't take this kind of fluff seriously.
Various complications ensue -- I won't give them away -- and of course the movie winds its way to its expected finish.

2992986,4,B000WXDMLE,"Run Fatoby Run tells the story of Dennis (Simon Pegg), a man who left his gorgeous pregnant girlfriend, Libby (Thandie Newton), at the ALTAR. Years later, Dennis is going nowhere as a mall security guard who has never seemed to finish anything he ever started. He has a great relationship with his son, Jake (adorable Matthew Fenton), but Libby clearly sees him as someone she can't/doesn't want to trust.

Anyhoo, things are moving along with aching inertia until Dennis finds out Libby is dating Whit (a gleefully Type-A Hank Azaria). Whit is a bigshot in the financial industry and runs marathons for charity in his spare time. To somehow prove to Libby (and himself) that he's no loser, Dennis decides to run the same marathon that Whit's running in. The marathon is less than a month away. Did I mention that Dennis is not very athletic?

Everything would have probably fallen to pieces if Dennis' friend, Gordon (a hilarious Dylan Moran), didn't bet everything he owned that Dennis would finish the race. Suddenly, Dennis finds himself with a very motivated personal trainer. And the journey he takes, which happens to be quite a bit longer than the standard 26.2 miles, ends up changing his life.

What can I say? I love me some Simon Pegg. There is something so everyman and yet so absolutely endearing about him. And that would be enough, I suppose, except that he has wonderful comic timing and a knack for physical gags. Newton is lumniscent, as always, and Moran nearly steals the show in most of his scenes.

2992991,5,B000WXDMLE,"Britishly funny with a good message. Perhaps a bit predictable, but the storyline develops in such a way that it draws you in and causes you to laugh and cheer as the ""loser"" runs a race for his life. Played by British actor Simon Pegg, his character epitomizes the adage that ""we only rise to the level of our own self-expectations."" Fortunately for Pegg's character, there are those who rally around him to get him un-stuck. The take away is that if and when we get stuck, it's a good thing to have those who truly care for us to push us out of our comfort zones -- even when we don't believe in ourselves.

Pegg's character initially begins training to win back the beautiful but pregnant woman he left at the altar five years before. However, as he begins running the race, he is tripped and severely sprains his ankle. To his credit, he continues running, but this time he runs for self-vindication. As he nears the latter part of the 26 mile race, he hits what distance runners call the ""wall"" and stops. At this wall, painful memories of past failures flood back, and he faces his ""demons"". Once again he begins to slowly and painfully move forward, placing one foot in front of the other, until he finishes the race. Thus he proves to himself and others that he is indeed a winner.

Does Pegg's character learn confidence? Yes. Does he get off his pity-pot? Yes. But it doesn't come easy, and not until he gets a good dose of tough love and encouragement from his friends. See it more than once, do some of your own self-reflection and get moving. Highly recommended.",1240876800,,1575,4.503496503496503

It's up there in the ranks of Pineapple Express, which is why I'm surprised it got such bad reviews. It's a subtle humor, one that Simon Pegg is well known for and which is seen in his more renown films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. This movie isn't as fast-paced as those, but definately delivers a blow humor-wise. A punch I loved taking! It's basically a love story gone wrong, not the most original but the humor was absolutely top-notch, the story is very real life oriented, but with the typical feel-good ending that is only seen in movies.

When he meets her new boyfriend, five years later, Dennis decides that he had better make it up to her now or he might lose her forever. The difficulty lies in the fact that this new boyfriend is many things that Dennis is not. The new guy is successful, confident, responsible and he runs marathons for charity -- and that is held over Dennis's head as if that one thing sums up how Dennis will never be good enough. Dennis responds that he will run the marathon, too. So now he trains for 26 grueling miles as if Libby will be waiting for him at the finish line.

I will admit that my expectations for this film were low. I have enjoyed Simon Pegg in some of his other movies, but not enough to rush out and see this. (Not based on Simon Pegg's involvement, but) I was afraid that it would be one of the romantic comedies that tried to focus on the romantic rather than the comedy.

The movie was funny and charming. The supporting cast was made up with some great characters, including but not limited to Dennis's landlord/upstairs neighbor Mr. Goshdashtidar (Harish Patel) and Dennis's best friend Gordon (Dylan Moran). The involvement of these supporting cast members and the interaction between Dennis and his son were probably the high points of the movie.

It's a little more in-depth and emotional than the other two movies, though, so don't expect plain old college dorm antics, like finding shelter in a pub or making a move straight out of ""Desperado"" to beat the bad guys - this one also has a heart and is aware of the family situation and romance, and could almost be considered a romantic comedy.

Years have passed and they never married, but they do have a great kid together.  Jake (Matthew Fenton) is into LOTR, newly discovered girls, and he's trying to find his way in life.

So's his Mom.  She's found a new love, Whit (Hank Azaria).  Whit sounds like everything she wants, stable, good job, loves Jacob, and follow through.

Whit's proposal on Libby's birthday galvanizes Dennis into action.  To prove he can finish something, he's going to run a marathon with Whit.

I love Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) unfortunately he was not enough to make this more than a mediocre effort. What we lacked here was depth--precisely what made Dennis the kind of person who couldn't finish?  We don't even have a hint.

Simon's character's interaction with his son was heartwarming and you just can't help but enjoy Simon's personality in his films.  In the end, I found the movie shallow and I don't know how hard I would recommend the film to the average viewer.

Spoilers may follow

Early on the movie points out how absurd it is that Simon's character would feel that he could win over his ex by running a marathon but ultimately that is exactly what happens.  Sure, there is more to it than that, he doesn't fully win her over and her current boyfriend makes himself out to be a jerk, but if you boil it down that is what you get.  For a movie that had a surprising amount of weight about it and more maturity that either Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead (both excellent movies in their own right) I felt that the ending was too childish, even outlandish.  What I expected was that his ex would marry her boyfriend and that Simon's character would be forced to finally grow up, mature, and face the reality that life doesn't always give you what you want but you can still find a way to make things the best that you can.  He was already partially there with his relationship with his son.  Instead, the perfect boyfriend conveniently turns into a creep and the main character gets his moment to shine through in one moment of triumph that is more redeeming than it should have been.",1228867200,,1446,4.365671641791045
2993007,4,B000WXDMLE,"Perhaps Runaway Bride starring Julia Roberts gave a launch to the premonition that many people just before a wedding is set to kick off head for the door and run down the street leaving the wedding and the relationship associated with it all behind.

In the movie Run Fatboy Run, this time it is not an anxious bride that leaves her beau waiting at the altar, rather it is the groom who decides that all he can possibly do just before he is set to be married is make a bolt for the door and run. Though not athletic by any stretch of the imagination, Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) comes to the realization that perhaps marriage simply is not for him and his only solution is to make like Forrest Gump and keep on running.

Directed by David Schwimmer, the majority of the movie does not focus on Dennis' decision to leave his lovely bride-to-be Libbie Odell (Thandie Newton) at the altar and instead is more about Dennis' life after he loses the chance to marry Libbie.

Libbie and Dennis have a son Jake (Matthew Fenton) together and Jake's time spent with each of them is split like so many children with separated parents. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Dennis might think that one day he and Libbie will reconnect but it seems as though Libbie might have different thoughts.

With neither Libbie nor Dennis have dated after their split, Libbie decides that perhaps five years was long enough for her to move on with her life. She begins to date Whit (Hank Azaria) who is perhaps as different from Dennis as one could get. Unlike Dennis, Whit has a high-paying white collar job, loves the attention that comes with prestige and also likes to run, not from the altar but for fun.

The tenuous relationship between Whit and Dennis needless to say is a rocky one as they each are competing for Libbie in one way or another. Awkwardly, Dennis is competing to show Libbie the past and Whit is Libbie's present and hopeful future. So when Whit tells Dennis that he is running the London Marathon, Dennis basically shrugs it off as no big deal and brags that he could run the marathon, as well.

Run Fatboy Run is a very good comedy film that shows how sometimes one's intended machismo might run directly contrary to reality. See, Whit is in shape, has run marathons before and has the drive to actually complete a marathon. Dennis wears outdated track shorts and gets winded running to the end of the block initially.

Though there are certain failures and shortcomings along Dennis' training regimen, his passion to run the London Marathon for perhaps no other reason than to throw it in Whit's face burns strong. It also seems as though Dennis is out to prove something to both Jake and Libbie that he is a good and dedicated father and maybe should be given another chance.

The ending of the movie is nothing completely unexpected so please don't be hoping for a major surprise awaiting you at the end of the film. In reality, had the ending of the film not been what it in fact was, that probably would have been quite shocking.

There is the right amount of comedy in the film to not make this film too overly sentimental and sappy. Though it certainly at times seems as though it might be more of a non-traditional love story than anything else, thanks largely in part to the acting of Simon Pegg and the direction of Schwimmer the film does not fall prey to the dreaded chick flick category.

Run Fatboy Run is a well done comedy film that certainly is worth watching. There are a lot of really good little subplots taking place throughout the film and the British humor at times can make way for an additional chuckle here and there. So just like Dennis, get off your duff and run, fatboy, run and go pick up this film.",1228694400,,3726,4.506666666666667
2993008,4,B000WXDMLE,"I picked this film up at least ten times before finally renting it. The details of the ratings always get me. Define nudity. Define gross or sexual humor. Do I want to watch it? Will I actually laugh? Keep in mind that I am drawn to quirk. I also don't laugh at crude, embarrassing sexual jokes that seem to be so prevalent in films.

Other than a few moments of PG-13 Mr. Bean-type behavior -- an itch in a particularly sensitive place, a few s-bombs (there may be a quiet use of the F-word, I'm not sure if he said it or a sound alike), a couple of off-color comments, and an odd mirror kissing scene, the conversation/physical humor was pretty clean. However, there are three naked guy rear-end shots, one pretty prolonged during an intimidating conversation.

If none of these throw you off, then you may very much like this film. Fat-Boy is full of quirk. A loser who regrets a decision to run from the altar, leaving behind a pregnant girlfriend is at a loss on how to get her back. In an attempt to compete with her Super boyfriend (the guy has it all, including her heart) loser signs up for a marathon. Spurred on by oddball friends he is encouraged to finish the race. But will he? And what will he really lose if he doesn't.

Themes like forgiveness, change, personal integrity, challenge and growing up are covered in almost poignant scenes. Great multi-dimensional characters.

If you are still iffy, rent it first. If I see a decent price tag on it, I'll buy it for my movie stash. It was sweet enough to revisit.",1228262400,,1527,4.462365591397849
2993009,5,B000WXDMLE,"I rented this movie from my local grocery store RedBox and I was very pleased with the plot of the movie and the humor.

The movie is about someone (Simon Pegg's character) who leaves his fiance at the alter when he gets cold feet and this makes her very upset. 5 years later we find out that Pegg's character is much fatter and Thandie Newton's character has found someone else who she is now dating. Newton's character and her new boyfriend are engaged and Simon Pegg's character must fight to win her back. To win her back he competes in a marathon race along with his rival who is Newton's new fiance. In the race chaos breaks out when we find out her fiance is deliberately trying to sabatoge the race and hurt him. I won't elaborate any further so I don't spoil the key elements of the film.

But in closing this is a very funny movie and I highly recommend that you see it with friends. David Schwimmer, the director, does a great job in producing good movies.

Now he wants desperately to get back into her and their 5 year old son's life, but a new successful American businessman (Simpsons' Hank Azaria, who does better than expected) is in the way. Soon, Pegg's Dennis sees that an English marathon that Azaria's running in as well is his only chance to prove that he can finally finish something, even though he's slightly out-of-shape and is going to need help to prepare...

I found this movie to be very warm and humorous, great for 30ish Dad's like myself. Pegg does a great job in his typical way, but the title stinks. He's NOT fat, he's got a spare tire, and even it looks a little unnoticable, while others still call him ""fatboy"". Like other Pegg films, instead of partner Nick ""Hot Fuzz"" Frost at his side, we now get another Shawn alumni Dylan Moran, who does a great turn as Thandie Newton's cousin and Dennis' best friend. It's been touted as a modern-day English Rocky, and while there's some things that earn it, it's also very funny in some parts too. Comes with trailers, making-of, bloopers and a commentary track with Pegg, Moran, Schwimmer (who still sounds like Ross after breaking up with Rachel), and strangely Pegg's real-life mother (why?), this release is worth a purchase and/or viewing. In fact, I enjoyed it more than Pegg's Hot Fuzz, which was a pretty good film in itself too. A nice surprise of a movie by two men you didn't think had it in them. Just ignore the title, okay?

There is no question that Simon Pegg, in the starring role of Denise (the fat boy) has a very exciting film future ahead of him.

From the first four minutes, the viewer can plot the entire film: disappointing from a writer as clever as Michael Ian Black (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stella/dp/B000FZETJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stella</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-State/dp/B00104A0W8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The State</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Custom-Van-And-50-Other-Mind-Blowing-Essays-that-Will-Blow-Your-Mind-All-Over-Your-Face/dp/1416964053/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Custom Van: And 50 Other Mind-Blowing Essays that Will Blow Your Mind All Over Your Face</a>). The same can be noted of Simon Pegg (who contributed to the playful, witty&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hot-Fuzz/dp/B000RJO578/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hot Fuzz</a>). The collaboration of Black and Pegg should have been synergistic ... but Run, Fatboy, Run is decidedly trite. (And, as a warning, it's steeped in both low-brow and physical humor).

Though nothing can redeem this half-hearted film, David Schwimmer's direction was excellent. The former ""Friends"" star has proven that his talents extend beyond on-screen work. Likewise, Dylan Moran commits to his role as the ""fair-weather friend"" ... and while his part is entirely one-dimensional, the viewer can note his effort. (He is a phenomenal actor ... be sure to check out his other work!)

This is your typical rom-com with all the rom-com trappings. For Pegg fans, this film will prove a tremendous disappointment -- there is nothing nuanced about this work. For Black fans, this work will seem all too obvious -- there is not even a hint of his trademark ""kookiness"" here. If you are hoping for a reprisal of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, or even The State, just walk-away NOW!! You will only be frustrated. However, if you dig mainstream works like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Lose-a-Guy-in-10-Days/dp/B000094J7Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Failure-to-Launch/dp/B000FILV1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Failure to Launch</a>&nbsp;(and there is NOTHING wrong with that), than this film will appeal to you.",1223769600,4,2981,7.7105263157894735
2993022,5,B000WXDMLE,"At face value, this romantic comedy seemed unlikely to capture my attention. Partially because of the almost cliche ""Underdog wins despite all odds"" theme,partially because its the directorial debut of David Schwimmer - my expectation were not set too high. I was pleasantly surprised, perhaps even overwhelmed by the excellent realistic acting exhibited by all characters involved, from major to minor, but above all by Simon Pegg. I believe this movie will prove truly inspirational to many, who are stuck in a seemingly hopeless situation, no matter what their circumstances may be, who are determined to better themselves and change their fate.",1223683200,,648,5.362745098039215

2993024,5,B000WXDMLE,"I thought this was a very funny movie! Everybody did an awesome job! Simon Pegg gets better every time I see him. He plays Dennis Doyle who left his pregnant fiance named Libby at the alter. 5 years later, they still see each other, so Dennis can see his son, but Libby is still upset. Dennis is a security guard at a women's store. Libby has been going out with a guy named Whit who is going to run in the Nike River Marathon in London, and to win Libby's respect, he decides to run too. His friend, Gordon, and his landlord, Mr. Ghoshdashtidar, decide to help him train. Whit proposes to Libby, but makes Dennis upset because he's still in love with her. Throughout the 26-mile race, Dennis pushes himself to finish, even when Whit injures him. If you love comedy, you'll love RUN FATBOY RUN!!!",1223078400,,796,4.421768707482993
2993025,1,B000WXDMLE,This is the worst movie I have seen in years.  The only way I would watch this movie again is if someone paid me $50 AND provided snacks.  My sense of humor spans the entire spectrum of funny and I didn't laugh once.  Calling this movie a comedy is like calling David Caruso an actor.  I can't stress enough how bad this movie is.  Even sadomasochists would have a hard time watching this movie.,1222905600,2,395,4.283783783783784
2993026,5,B000WXDMLE,"Dennis Doyle(Simon Pegg) is living in the past, with the heavy weight of regret on his mind. He left the woman he loves, Elizabeth(Thandie Newton) at the altar when she was pregnant with his baby, and he's had five years to sit around and think about it; and he's finally decided to do change his situation and do something about it....
by running a marathon.

This however turns out to be quite the problem since this mundane mall security guard Dennis is one out-of-shape British man. But with the help of Whit(Hank Azaria) Elizabeth's overachieving new boyfriend to spite him, his adorable son
Jake(Matthew Fenton) and his team managers Gordon(Dylan Moran) and Mr. Goshdashtidar(Harish Patel) the finish line is beginning to come into focus.

With a director like David Schwimmer(in his film debut) and a screenplay by Simon Pegg himself and the hilarious Michael Ian Black, it's simple yet accurate to say, it's a little magical.

It may be a predictable, but it's full of heart, humor and that feel-good-feeling that reminds one of 'It's A Wonderful Life.'

In my eyes, it's a new classic; However something that doesn't give you a bad taste in the mouth when it's over is a highly underrated quality these days.",1222732800,,1217,4.8647342995169085
3227286,4,B000WXDMLE,"First, a warning to fans of Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, the more popular of the Simon Pegg starred films: this isn't a film that would seemed to have come from the same team of film makers, that is despite the fact that Simon Pegg did help develop the story for this film.  There are lines of humor and jokes in this film that hint at the playful spirit shown in those earlier films, but as a whole this movie is much more in the ""charming"" category where those films were done in a different manner entirely.  Perhaps the difference is David Schwimmer's direction, perhaps it's the screen play, or perhaps Pegg was intentionally aiming for charming in an effort to widen his range and appeal, either way the result here is a film that fans of the earlier movies may be disappointed in.

If you can get past the idea that this film is going to be charming, rather than more satirical and crude, well, you find that the result isn't that bad.  5 star material, not so much for me, and really probably more in the 3.5 range overall, but I'm rounding up a bit as I happen to think charming isn't such a bad thing to be.

Simon Pegg plays Dennis, a man that ditched his pregnant girlfriend (Libby, played by Thande Newton) at the altar.  Years later he finds himself working as a security guard that can't run more than a few blocks to try to catch the shoplifter that ripped off the shop we works at.  Ah, the difference a few years, many cigarettes and not so healthy eating makes for.

Dennis is a not so dependable father to the son that Libby has been raising by herself, and meanwhile Libby has found another potential love interest (played by Hank Azaria) who seems to make Dennis all the more sad over the love he lost.

Eventually (not so far along really), Dennis decides that he'll run in the big marathon to impress Libby, not just because he wants to impress her, but because his competitor for Libby's interest is going to run in the event.  Can a guy whose life is such a mess, not to mention the lack of being physically fit, actually run a marathon?  That's what you'll be watching to find out. :-)

There are several crude jokes mixed into the film along the way, and several minutes of the same mixed into the outtakes that are included on the Blu-ray disc.  Nothing that is that harsh, but those that are easily offended should consider themselves warned.  A few instances of rough language also help get the film that rating it sports, so again if you are easily offended perhaps you're better off looking elsewhere.

Picture quality on the Blu-ray is nice.  The soundtrack is enjoyable and the musical selections that are included fit nicely where they are placed.  Give this romantic comedy a chance to charm you and you may find it more of a winner than you expected.  Certainly worth a rental, not far from the buy it rating.",1222300800,17,2849,4.435700575815739

3227288,5,B000WXDMLE,"Simon Pegg is usually best in his more crude comedies like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  This one was skeptical because it's more romantic.  But man, was it awesome.  Not full of those hard laughs that leave you laughing after the movie, but more feel good laughs.  I highly recommend this movie and you should go out and buy it now!",1222128000,,336,4.285714285714286
3227289,5,B000WXDMLE,"This movie was released over a year ago and I've seen it four times since.  I absolutely love this movie.  Great casting for this movie, and a great story, if you ask me.  I don't want to give to much of the movie away but it pretty much starts with Dennis (Simon Pegg), and Libby (Thandie Newton) about to get married, but Dennis gets cold feet, and on the day of his wedding while he's up in his bedroom he decides to go out the window and run away.  Then, fastforward to his future where he is a fat security guard for a clothing store.  He's still in his son's life, which is a good thing, but not really in Libby's life.  So anyway, Libby finds a new boyfriend, Whit (Hank Azaria), and obviously Dennis doesn't like this.  Dennis now feels that he must prove himself so his one true love will take him back, and in his eyes, that means completing the marathon, showing Libby that he can commit and complete something in his life.  He teams up with his best friend, and his landlord, which help him by keeping him motivated and by being there to support him at the marathon.

I honestly found this to be quite a good movie and can't wait for the DVD so I can watch it 10 more times before the year is up.  This is one of those movies I'm going to have everyone I know watch.  Definitely a good story, and great acting.  I'm quite suprised this movie only has a small amount of reviews.  I knew it flew under the radar, but I didn't know it flew under the radar that much.  But then again, it hasn't even been released on DVD so I guess we'll have to wait and see.",1221523200,,1567,4.145695364238411

Great comedy by ""David Schwimmer"" (you know, ROSS from Friends). The lead role is Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), he was great, as usual, in his role as the underachieving dad and ex-fiance of Thandie Newton (The Truth About Charlie), also starring Hank Azaria (Along Came Polly, Mystery Men)as Thandie Newtons ""perfect"" new boyfriend!

I didn't have high hopes for this movie going in, but it was excellent.

3227292,4,B000WXDMLE,"I too think, that the title ""Run Fat Boy Run"" is quite amusing and very apropriate for the film. Let me, in response to another reviewers question ""who would pay money to see a fat boy run?"" ask: who wouldn't?

The story is neither original nor complicated. At their wedding, Simon Pegg's character gets cold feet and takes off without explanation, leaving his pregnant girlfriend behind. 5 years down the line he, now a fat, pathtic looser without the mone to pay the rent, realises that he actually left the love of his life behind that day. She has found a rich, handsome, athletic American played very well by Hank Azaria, and has no need for her former fiance. So to win her back, Pegg must compete against his American competitor in a marathon race. Chaos and hilarity ensues.

Simon Pegg, who is nothing short of a comic genius, plays the gormless loser so joyously well, and adds to it his incredible sense of physical comedy. His American rival is in turn played expertly by Mr. Azaria, who somehow manages to portray a character that at the same time is absolutely charming, wonderful, and thoroughly unlikeable. The always funny Dylan Moran adds his own interesting personae to the character Gordon, the best friend of Peggs character. Also a guest visit from Little Britains David Walliams, makes for a nice little surprise.

I'm not the biggest fan of director David Schwimmer, but I must admit that he's done a decent job with this one. The score, scenery, production, and all the rest of it is also done quite well.

So in conclusion I'll say, that while ""Run Fat Boy Run"" is not in any way original or spellbinding, it does provide some solid laughs and is never boring. Definitely recommendable.",1208217600,33,1712,4.7157190635451505
3227293,5,B000WXDMLE,"I actually think that the title of this film sums up its humour, and hopefully its not too British for US sensitivities.

One thing I noticed on the second viewing was that it was much harder to like Simon Pegg's character the second time around, and much harder to hate his ""nemesis"" Hank Azaria. Simon's characters lack of maturity (he's basically a man-child) and the fact that he seems incapable of accepting responsibility for his actions (he even comments on why his ex-finance was still mad at him for leaving her at the alter, after all it was ages ago). Hank on the other hand genuinely wants to be there for his future step-child, and while he's clearly one of those super annoying type-A-has-to-be-the-best-at-everything types i feel they really just ratchet up his douchey factor to make Simon seem more likable than anything else. Feels forced.

Comedy-wise the writing is good, but I feel the character development was lacking.

No you won't learn too much information about running a marathon. For that purpose, you need to watch some other documentary.

I think some scenes may not be necessary. For example, the US guy was very upset seeing the coupon on the tv. I wonder who produce the film cause there is a bit mocking American here and there. Not the too inappropriate ones, but I can still sense them.",1398038400,,543,4.474747474747475

3227419,5,B000WXDMLE,"I had no clue who Simon Pegg was until I found this movie and have been a fan of his ever since. I actually got the movie because I am a Thandie Newton fan and had never seen her in a comedy. Mind you, her role is not comedic at all, but this story is so cute and all of the characters do a great job. I also discovered Dylan Moran (I hope I got the name right - he's Thandie's cousin in the movie). SO FUNNY!

The movie is about Pegg who stood up his girlfriend (Newton) at their wedding while she was pregnant with his baby. The story then fast forwards to 5 or 6 years later when they've moved on and made their arrangements to co-parent, etc... Newton has a ""perfect in every way"" boyfriend (played by Hank Azaria) who is getting serious with her, and Pegg wants to win her back by running in the London Marathon (because the boyfriend runs marathons). The story is funny, clean and has a great ending. It lags just a tad in the middle for me (because I am not a fan of sports at ALL (except basketball) and the whole running thing was a bit taxing), but not so much that I would turn it off. I thoroughly enjoyed the film.",1388880000,2,1127,4.076576576576577

Simon is good without Nick Frost, but a part of the Cornetto trilogy this is not.  There are some funny bits and some heart to the film, but there was just nothing to qualify it as overly memorable.  I chuckled, but didn't laugh out loud.

Simon Pegg does an excellent job acting in this, and reminds me of his performacne in Shaun of the Dead. This move is full of callbacks and humor.

3227446,3,B000WXDMLE,"Run Fat Boy Run(released Sept/07) is a tepid comedy starring,among others,Simon Pegg as Dennis Doyle,Thandie Newton as Libby Odell,Hank Azaria as Whit,Dylan Moran as Gordon,Harish Patel as Mr. Goshdashtidar and India de Beaufort as Maya Goshdashtidar. The film is full of typical Simon Pegg type humour like the quote from the title. This is when Simon is looking at his rival's private parts. Other moments he is jumping into bushes,is in a tree with his son making rude noises to annoy passers by or scratching his privates with a mannequin hand. And,it is yet another story about a recalcitrant father going from a bad place and coming back to win the admiration of his son and his ex. I cannot say there is anything in this film to lift it above the ordinary.
The story finds Pegg as an out of shape security guard. It is his wedding day and he's scared stiff about marrying his already pregnant bride. At the last minute he makes a run for it and becomes an instant bachelor with a son who lives and grows up with his mother,and who he sees off and on. Fast forward and Pegg now lives in a basement flat and is behind in his rent. His best friend is his ex's cousin and he is a heavy gambler. Five years have gone by and his wife is now seeing an American(Azaria).Pegg isn't too pleased but there is nothing he can really do. When Pegg finds out that Azaria is running in the London marathon,Pegg decides to also go for it,to impress his ex and son.
His ex's cousin bets heavily on him and his Indian landlord also pitches in to help. Now all they need is a sponsor,the only way Pegg can enter the marathon in the less than three week time frame he has. The three try and con a big corporation into supporting them,but when they ask for their charity number it is all over. On the way downstairs the wheel chair they were using gets away from them and it hits a man. It turns out the man was going to be running the marathon but can't now. Pegg gets his sponsor,the erectile dysfunction association. Pegg's training continues but at a party his ex is proposed to by Azaria and she accepts. Disgusted Pegg calls it all off. However a talk with his son later,and persuasion by his friend who is in debt up to his eyeballs,and the marathon is back on.
The day of the race comes and Pegg barely makes it on time. Pegg starts trying to pull away from the pack but Azaria keeps up with him. Azaria trips Pegg and they both go down. Azaria ends up in the hospital while Pegg decides to carry on,with a sprained ankle. It takes him many hours but he manages to make it to the end,with a bevy of reporters and supporters with him all the way. The film ends as Pegg is enjoying his new healthy life style(he runs everyday now) and seems on the verge of getting back together with his ex.
There are very few laughs in this film,and goodness knows Pegg tries his best with what he has. But most of humour elicits mostly slight smiles and nothing much more. And of course there has to be a bad guy and a""serious"" side to the story,but it is all contrived and been there,done that stuff. I had to shake my head at the scene where the three are leaving the corporation and the wheel chair goes down the steps. We knew it was going to hit someone or something,but when the fellow they hit says he was a runner,had a sponsor and couldn't run,well...that was about as contrived and unimaginative as it comes. The film is chock full of stuff like this.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette,commentary,deleted scenes,a gag reel and the trailer. Both w/s and full screen versions are on this disc.

It's definitely  worth seeing. It's alot better than Hot Fuzz, which I felt had too outlandish a story to be enduring. On the other hand I loved Shaun of the Dead and what is more outlandish than zombies? One interesting thing about this movie is the title illustrates the different world views of what ""fat"" is. Simon Pegg IS fat. Some Americans would think he's not fat at all, but that's cause we're used to thinking ""fat"" when we see obese, hyper obese or even morbidly hyper obese people.

3227467,4,B000WXDMLE,"The unfortunately titled Run Fatboy Run comes from that risky, murky water where comedians decide they want to be sweeties. Sometimes, this can be golden: Simon Pegg, who stars as the slobbering, unreconstructed-on-the-way-to-construction hero, Dennis, is particularly talented at juggling the flatulent with the heartwarming. However, it's a dangerous idea, as comedians can sometimes get derailed on their way to sensitive, saccharine warmth, and end up in the horribly, gouge-your-eyes-out maudlin. For example, Robin Williams in a number of films (though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Dreams-May-Come/dp/B00007GZR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Dreams May Come</a>&nbsp;may be the most notorious), or Adam Sandler's nauseating self-pity in the gratingly unfunny&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-People/dp/B002PLPQLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny People</a>.

Adam Sandler's actually a good match for Simon Pegg, as they both specialize in frat boy (or, well, the British equivalent) humo(u)r that is underscored by a genuine authenticity - they are both adept at playing man-children. Run Fatboy Run introduces us to Dennis (Simon Pegg) on the day of his wedding: his gorgeous, pregnant bride-to-be, Libby (Thandie Newton), chats with her amiable cousin, Gordon (Dylan Moran), and Dennis? He's the one sprinting down the street, away from the garden party. Fast forward five years and fifteen kilos, and Dennis, now a dumpy security guard, is sprinting after a (incidentally hilarious!) transvestite shoplifter. He lives in a basement flat, where he is periodically heckled by his (incidentally hilarious) landlord, Mr. Goshdashtidar (Harish Patel, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Son-the-Fanatic/dp/6305692629/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Son the Fanatic</a>), for perpetually forgetting his keys.

When Dennis visits Libby to pick up their son, Jake (Matthew Fenton), he is introduced to Libby's new boyfriend: Whit (Hank Azaria). Whit is everything Dennis is not: a successful hedge fund manager, he showers Libby and Jake with expensive gadgets and affection, is breezily self-confident in a very American way, and runs charity marathons for fun. Dennis, privately, seethes. He decides to remedy his broken heart and dead-end life by challenging Whit to his own marathon. Everyone does a lot of scoffing and snorting with laughter - what, Dennis? the fat guy? a marathon? - and Dennis, meanwhile, with his gambling buddy, Gordon, and Mr. Goshdashtidar, gets down to training. The rest of the film follows the usual course.

Run Fatboy Run generally avoids some of the disasterous pitfalls which threaten a movie like this, mostly because, as we said above, Simon Pegg has a good handle on balancing sympathy with humor, and we have a very high tolerance for seeing him be sad before we consider it over-the-top and indulgent. We think this is generally because Pegg sparingly uses that most deadliest of comic weapons - irony - and hence never distances himself from the character. Yes, Dennis is a clumsy, Homer Simpson-esque buffoon, but he's also, always, human. Everything is played straight. Example: when Dennis, in usual Disney-style manipulation, momentarily loses his son, there is real horror and panic. It's a credit to Pegg, who specializes in airy comedy that's been deep fried in pop culture, that he is actually a very authentic actor indeed.

Other cast members, such as Dylan Moran and Harish Patel, have a good ol' time and offer charming support to the central conceit. For the most part, the film succeeds because it feels more like a Nick Hornby movie (we were specifically reminded of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/About-a-Boy-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JL7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">About a Boy (Widescreen Edition)</a>), though things spiral slightly out of control with the climax, which becomes so sticky with sugar that we had to go wash our eyeballs. All in all, it's not a memorable film and Pegg's characteristic surrealism is missing, but it's a modest and inoffensive heart-shaped fluff piece. We can handle that.

3227474,4,B000WXDMLE,"We liked this movie for a light Saturday date night w/popcorn in front of the TV. The best laughs, in my opinion, come from the moments that catch you off guard---the little subtle gestures like when the cousin shows up with his hair in a towel after sneaking into the coveted bath at a swanky birthday party. The least funny were the really juvenile jokes showing body fluids. It was almost as if two people wrote the movie---one going for subtle and one going for over-the-top-in-your-face.

At the same time, there are some quite serious moments. The music slows and swells (the soundtrack is really schizophrenic), and the main character (fat boy) seems to be going through some real heartbreak. Parts of the movie are quite touching, but then it goes back to over-the-top silliness again. They also could have made the story more plausible---why did he have only 3 weeks to train? Why not make it 8 weeks or something that would have made a bit more sense?

My advice would be to rent it and just go with the dumb jokes and take what you can from the rest.  Hugh Grant and his crew would have done a better job (think how smoothly 4 Weddings flows), but this is still worth the cost of admission.",1265068800,,1201,4.525345622119816
3227475,4,B000WXDMLE,"As others have said, this movie is no Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. It is, however, a decent movie.

Simon Pegg plays a guy who left his preggers girlfriend at the altar. Skip forward a few years and he's an out of shape security guard at a mall. His ex-girlfriend is seeing another man who is in decently good shape--but he's a tool. This kind of sets off some competition in Simon Pegg's character and he decides to get in shape too. Dylan Moran (of Black Books fame) plays a friend that has a gambling problem, and has bet that Simon's character can finish a marathon. ...and Simon's trying ever-so-hard to get his woman back, which he realizes he should have never left, while training like mad to be able to do this marathon run.

I thought the best scenes were the ones with Dylan Moran in them. He basically plays the same character he did in Black Books (which is a great 3 season BBC show... Check it out!). Simon Pegg is pretty good in this, but it's not the same as you're probably used to from this actor.

It's worth a watch, but you may never watch it again. Once will probably be enough for you. Maybe rent/Netflix it instead.",1262649600,,1142,4.327102803738318
3227476,4,B000WXDMLE,"The sheer awesomeness of SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ - and let's not forget SPACED - has garnered Simon Pegg a lot of well-deserved fan love. RUN FAT BOY RUN rolls around and it's a romantic comedy and it's a lesser effort, compared to what Pegg's wrought before. Doesn't mean it's not good. It, in fact, is very funny and has a sentimental core and an earnest undercurrent.

Simon Pegg is really great at embodying that likable career slacker with whom most of us can identify. It doesn't hurt that Pegg also demonstrates a sharp sense of humor and delivery. The start of RUN FAT BOY RUN showcases Simon Pegg at perhaps his most despicable, his character Dennis Doyle having cold feet on his wedding day and literally running away from his pregnant fiancee Libby (Thandie Newton, perfectly winning). Five years later finds Dennis a bit worse for wear, his life spiraling nowhere. He's put on a bit of weight and, in his security guard gig at a women's clothing store, he has extraordinary amounts of trouble chasing down shoplifters who taunt him as they sprint away. Dennis defensively retorts: ""I'm not fat! I'm unfit!""

Worse news. For the past five years Dennis has been trying to get back into his ex-fiancee's good graces, but apparently being abandoned at the altar takes a lot of making up for. Dennis gets along really well with his five-year-old son who easily forgives his dad's bump of irresponsibility, and hanging out with his kid may be the only consistently good thing in Dennis's life. And now there's a new romantic gent in Libby's life and, as played by Hank Azaria, this cat is successful and insufferably smug and obsessed with keeping fit, except that once you hear his name is ""Whit,"" you right away suspect that he may be a bit of a git. Whit has this tradition of running the marathon (which, by the way, Brits pronounce weirdly) and he runs this for charity. Dennis somehow takes it into his brain that if he also can not only run but finish in the same marathon, then this in some way will validate him in Libby's eyes, maybe even win her back. But there is a huge, gaping chasm between intent and action. Dennis is woefully, pathetically out of shape, his motivation very much slacker-sized. The only question seems to be how long before the guy gives up and falls back into his ambition-free habits.

RUN FAT BOY RUN is powered by Simon Pegg's presence, but it also really benefits from the other offbeat characters. Dennis Doyle can thank his lucky stars that he has friends as staunch as Gordon (Dylan Moran) and Mr. Goshdashtidar (Harish Patel), no matter that they are pretty unconventional dudes, especially Gordon who seems to disdain wearing bottoms.

The film expands beyond its jokey fratboy trappings, somewhere along the way becoming a heartfelt examination of a man who finally gets a good look at himself in the mirror, glimpses the ruins of his life, and realizes that he's run out of excuses. Dennis sets out to better himself, at first often stumbling and faltering but later breaking thru that wall. The film manipulates you, sure, but Simon Pegg is so good at this thing he does that you go along with the cheering and clapping at the proper moments, even if you do see these moments coming early on. And, just for a mo, let's not dwell too much on that, in this picture, competing in a marathon becomes a metaphor for a man's finally fully entering adulthood. Because the goofy kid in me just rose up and he refuses to pooh-pooh the film's obligatory fratboy sensibilities. I laughed my ess off during that sequence with the nasty, pus-full blister. ""That was the second most disgusting fluid I've ever had in my eye!"" is the punchline to this gag, and I almost put a SPOILER banner a sentence back, except that, c'mon, how did you not see this coming?",1261267200,,3804,4.647845468053492

3227480,4,B000WXDMLE,"David Schwimmer (yes, ""Ross"" from friends"") makes his directorial debut with this film and doesn't do a bad job (note to Mr. Schwimmer - stay on that side of the camera). Simple story : Boy leaves pregnant girlfriend at the altar. Several years later, boy realizes what he was missing, but girlfriend has new boyfriend who is about to run a marathon. Boy decides the only way to get her back is to run against the new boyfriend...etc etc.

It's more detailed than that, but you get the gist. Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) plays the deadbeat Dennis Doyle to perfection. He's just go that ""every man"" look about him which suits the part. Hank Azaria (Godzilla, Mystery Men) plays his nemesis very well too.

For someone who has not been back to London in many years, this film felt a little like a trip down memory lane. The films is set all over the city and is diverse in locations and cast members. Doyle is a loser. He's a security guard in a women's underwear store who can't even catch a shoplifter. His decision to run in a Nike challenge (product placement galore) is motivated purely by a desire to get his girlfriend back from her all-American stud boyfriend. The Anglo-American rivalry is set, though it's not transparently obvious in the conflict (ie no one resorts to calling anyone ""brit"" or ""yank""), but it's a clash of lifestyle, culture and egos. The film pokes gentle fun at everyone, from the stereotypical characters to the over-the-top media coverage of the marathon's dramatic climax.

The ending is perfect, and I was surprised that the tension towards the end really worked well. I think Schwimmer has a promising directorial career ahead. The film doesn't have the ""silly"" humor or the laugh-upon-laugh of ""Shaun of the Dead"". It's a little more subtle, but just as, if not more satisfying.

Well worth watching.",1248566400,,1836,4.728125
3227481,2,B000WXDMLE,"The protagonist of this intermittently amusing comedy is Dennis, the latest in an endless series of male ""heroes"" unwilling or unable to grow up. Dennis gets a case of the jitters on his wedding day and takes off at a sprint, leaving his heavily-pregnant bride on the altar. Fast forward several years and we find Dennis working as a security agent in a lingerie store and living in a squalid bedsit, smoking heavily, almost broke, getting fat and barely involved with his son. By now, he's realized he's still in love with the woman he abandoned, but she's become involved with Whit, a rich, way-too-smooth, slimy, hedge fund manager from Chicago who also happens to be a marathon runner played with appropriate creepiness by Hank Azaria. Dennis has the dum idea that if he can run the marathon and beat Whit, he could win back his beloved.
As a real runner, I found it laughable that an unfit smoker could get in shape for the marathon in three weeks. But of course, one shouldn't take this kind of fluff seriously.
Various complications ensue -- I won't give them away -- and of course the movie winds its way to its expected finish.
Pluses -- occasionally funny moments, great shots of London and Azaria's creepy performance.
Minuses - it's silly, the hero is another immature boy-man who refuses to grow up and I'm getting really sick of them.",1245628800,2,1348,4.69198312236287

3227483,4,B000WXDMLE,"Run Fatoby Run tells the story of Dennis (Simon Pegg), a man who left his gorgeous pregnant girlfriend, Libby (Thandie Newton), at the ALTAR. Years later, Dennis is going nowhere as a mall security guard who has never seemed to finish anything he ever started. He has a great relationship with his son, Jake (adorable Matthew Fenton), but Libby clearly sees him as someone she can't/doesn't want to trust.

Anyhoo, things are moving along with aching inertia until Dennis finds out Libby is dating Whit (a gleefully Type-A Hank Azaria). Whit is a bigshot in the financial industry and runs marathons for charity in his spare time. To somehow prove to Libby (and himself) that he's no loser, Dennis decides to run the same marathon that Whit's running in. The marathon is less than a month away. Did I mention that Dennis is not very athletic?

Everything would have probably fallen to pieces if Dennis' friend, Gordon (a hilarious Dylan Moran), didn't bet everything he owned that Dennis would finish the race. Suddenly, Dennis finds himself with a very motivated personal trainer. And the journey he takes, which happens to be quite a bit longer than the standard 26.2 miles, ends up changing his life.

What can I say? I love me some Simon Pegg. There is something so everyman and yet so absolutely endearing about him. And that would be enough, I suppose, except that he has wonderful comic timing and a knack for physical gags. Newton is lumniscent, as always, and Moran nearly steals the show in most of his scenes. A surprise? This little gem was directed by none other than David Schwimmer.

That is not what this film is about.  First the character Dennis does not even appear to be obese so lets change the title to Run Loser Run.

The film starts out with the back story of how the main character Dennis panics on his wedding day and leaves his beautiful wife to be (Libby)behind (who is also pregnant).  You see the main character runnning which leads you to believe that he will continue to be a runner?  Turns out the rest of his life he is a loser who still is in love with his ex.  It takes her falling for a very succesful man who appears to be a real winner to get Dennis to confront his feelings.  Dennis gets the idea that if he can beat his foe in a race than Libby will see that he (Dennis is also a winner who is worthy of her love).  Along the way the new boyfriend shows his true colors and thus you really start to hope Dennis can win Libby back.

3227487,4,B000WXDMLE,"""Run, Fatboy, Run"" is a hilarious and uplifting film about a guy named Dennis (Simon Pegg) who is a loser in every sense of the word. He leaves his pregnant fiancee, Libby (Thandie Newton), at the altar because of pathetic insecurity issues and doesn't realize the gravity of his mistake until five years later, when Libby is involved with the pretentious and wealthy Whit (Hank Azaria). Determined to prove to Libby that he's actually capable of following through with something, Dennis decides to run in a 26-mile charity marathon, which proves to be a bit of a challenge considering the fact that he's completely out of shape and only has three weeks to train.

I was pleasantly surprised by this film, which is an incredibly funny, feel-good movie. I lost a bit of respect for it because there's a bit of unnecessary crude humor (close your eyes during the blister scene), but even in spite of that, this is a great movie that I highly recommend.",1240876800,,950,4.72289156626506
3227488,5,B000WXDMLE,"Britishly funny with a good message. Perhaps a bit predictable, but the storyline develops in such a way that it draws you in and causes you to laugh and cheer as the ""loser"" runs a race for his life. Played by British actor Simon Pegg, his character epitomizes the adage that ""we only rise to the level of our own self-expectations."" Fortunately for Pegg's character, there are those who rally around him to get him un-stuck. The take away is that if and when we get stuck, it's a good thing to have those who truly care for us to push us out of our comfort zones -- even when we don't believe in ourselves.

Pegg's character initially begins training to win back the beautiful but pregnant woman he left at the altar five years before. However, as he begins running the race, he is tripped and severely sprains his ankle. To his credit, he continues running, but this time he runs for self-vindication. As he nears the latter part of the 26 mile race, he hits what distance runners call the ""wall"" and stops. At this wall, painful memories of past failures flood back, and he faces his ""demons"". Once again he begins to slowly and painfully move forward, placing one foot in front of the other, until he finishes the race. Thus he proves to himself and others that he is indeed a winner.

Does Pegg's character learn confidence? Yes. Does he get off his pity-pot? Yes. But it doesn't come easy, and not until he gets a good dose of tough love and encouragement from his friends. See it more than once, do some of your own self-reflection and get moving. Highly recommended.",1240876800,,1575,4.503496503496503

It's a subtle humor, one that Simon Pegg is well known for and which is seen in his more renown films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. This movie isn't as fast-paced as those, but definately delivers a blow humor-wise. A punch I loved taking! It's basically a love story gone wrong, not the most original but the humor was absolutely top-notch, the story is very real life oriented, but with the typical feel-good ending that is only seen in movies.

Dennis responds that he will run the marathon, too. So now he trains for 26 grueling miles as if Libby will be waiting for him at the finish line.

I will admit that my expectations for this film were low. I have enjoyed Simon Pegg in some of his other movies, but not enough to rush out and see this. (Not based on Simon Pegg's involvement, but) I was afraid that it would be one of the romantic comedies that tried to focus on the romantic rather than the comedy.

The movie was funny and charming. The supporting cast was made up with some great characters, including but not limited to Dennis's landlord/upstairs neighbor Mr. Goshdashtidar (Harish Patel) and Dennis's best friend Gordon (Dylan Moran). The involvement of these supporting cast members and the interaction between Dennis and his son were probably the high points of the movie.

It's a little more in-depth and emotional than the other two movies, though, so don't expect plain old college dorm antics, like finding shelter in a pub or making a move straight out of ""Desperado"" to beat the bad guys - this one also has a heart and is aware of the family situation and romance, and could almost be considered a romantic comedy.

Spoilers may follow

Early on the movie points out how absurd it is that Simon's character would feel that he could win over his ex by running a marathon but ultimately that is exactly what happens.  Sure, there is more to it than that, he doesn't fully win her over and her current boyfriend makes himself out to be a jerk, but if you boil it down that is what you get.  For a movie that had a surprising amount of weight about it and more maturity that either Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead (both excellent movies in their own right) I felt that the ending was too childish, even outlandish.  What I expected was that his ex would marry her boyfriend and that Simon's character would be forced to finally grow up, mature, and face the reality that life doesn't always give you what you want but you can still find a way to make things the best that you can.  He was already partially there with his relationship with his son.  Instead, the perfect boyfriend conveniently turns into a creep and the main character gets his moment to shine through in one moment of triumph that is more redeeming than it should have been.",1228867200,,1446,4.365671641791045
3227504,4,B000WXDMLE,"Perhaps Runaway Bride starring Julia Roberts gave a launch to the premonition that many people just before a wedding is set to kick off head for the door and run down the street leaving the wedding and the relationship associated with it all behind.

In the movie Run Fatboy Run, this time it is not an anxious bride that leaves her beau waiting at the altar, rather it is the groom who decides that all he can possibly do just before he is set to be married is make a bolt for the door and run. Though not athletic by any stretch of the imagination, Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) comes to the realization that perhaps marriage simply is not for him and his only solution is to make like Forrest Gump and keep on running.

Directed by David Schwimmer, the majority of the movie does not focus on Dennis' decision to leave his lovely bride-to-be Libbie Odell (Thandie Newton) at the altar and instead is more about Dennis' life after he loses the chance to marry Libbie.

Libbie and Dennis have a son Jake (Matthew Fenton) together and Jake's time spent with each of them is split like so many children with separated parents. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Dennis might think that one day he and Libbie will reconnect but it seems as though Libbie might have different thoughts.

With neither Libbie nor Dennis have dated after their split, Libbie decides that perhaps five years was long enough for her to move on with her life. She begins to date Whit (Hank Azaria) who is perhaps as different from Dennis as one could get. Unlike Dennis, Whit has a high-paying white collar job, loves the attention that comes with prestige and also likes to run, not from the altar but for fun.

The tenuous relationship between Whit and Dennis needless to say is a rocky one as they each are competing for Libbie in one way or another. Awkwardly, Dennis is competing to show Libbie the past and Whit is Libbie's present and hopeful future. So when Whit tells Dennis that he is running the London Marathon, Dennis basically shrugs it off as no big deal and brags that he could run the marathon, as well.

Run Fatboy Run is a very good comedy film that shows how sometimes one's intended machismo might run directly contrary to reality. See, Whit is in shape, has run marathons before and has the drive to actually complete a marathon. Dennis wears outdated track shorts and gets winded running to the end of the block initially.

Though there are certain failures and shortcomings along Dennis' training regimen, his passion to run the London Marathon for perhaps no other reason than to throw it in Whit's face burns strong. It also seems as though Dennis is out to prove something to both Jake and Libbie that he is a good and dedicated father and maybe should be given another chance.

The ending of the movie is nothing completely unexpected so please don't be hoping for a major surprise awaiting you at the end of the film. In reality, had the ending of the film not been what it in fact was, that probably would have been quite shocking.

There is the right amount of comedy in the film to not make this film too overly sentimental and sappy. Though it certainly at times seems as though it might be more of a non-traditional love story than anything else, thanks largely in part to the acting of Simon Pegg and the direction of Schwimmer the film does not fall prey to the dreaded chick flick category.

Run Fatboy Run is a well done comedy film that certainly is worth watching. There are a lot of really good little subplots taking place throughout the film and the British humor at times can make way for an additional chuckle here and there. So just like Dennis, get off your duff and run, fatboy, run and go pick up this film.",1228694400,,3726,4.506666666666667
3227505,4,B000WXDMLE,"I picked this film up at least ten times before finally renting it. The details of the ratings always get me. Define nudity. Define gross or sexual humor. Do I want to watch it? Will I actually laugh? Keep in mind that I am drawn to quirk. I also don't laugh at crude, embarrassing sexual jokes that seem to be so prevalent in films.

Other than a few moments of PG-13 Mr. Bean-type behavior -- an itch in a particularly sensitive place, a few s-bombs (there may be a quiet use of the F-word, I'm not sure if he said it or a sound alike), a couple of off-color comments, and an odd mirror kissing scene, the conversation/physical humor was pretty clean. However, there are three naked guy rear-end shots, one pretty prolonged during an intimidating conversation.

If none of these throw you off, then you may very much like this film. Fat-Boy is full of quirk. A loser who regrets a decision to run from the altar, leaving behind a pregnant girlfriend is at a loss on how to get her back. In an attempt to compete with her Super boyfriend (the guy has it all, including her heart) loser signs up for a marathon. Spurred on by oddball friends he is encouraged to finish the race. But will he? And what will he really lose if he doesn't.

Themes like forgiveness, change, personal integrity, challenge and growing up are covered in almost poignant scenes. Great multi-dimensional characters.

The movie is about someone (Simon Pegg's character) who leaves his fiance at the alter when he gets cold feet and this makes her very upset. 5 years later we find out that Pegg's character is much fatter and Thandie Newton's character has found someone else who she is now dating. Newton's character and her new boyfriend are engaged and Simon Pegg's character must fight to win her back. To win her back he competes in a marathon race along with his rival who is Newton's new fiance.

I found this movie to be very warm and humorous, great for 30ish Dad's like myself. Pegg does a great job in his typical way, but the title stinks. He's NOT fat, he's got a spare tire, and even it looks a little unnoticable, while others still call him ""fatboy"". Like other Pegg films, instead of partner Nick ""Hot Fuzz"" Frost at his side, we now get another Shawn alumni Dylan Moran, who does a great turn as Thandie Newton's cousin and Dennis' best friend. It's been touted as a modern-day English Rocky, and while there's some things that earn it, it's also very funny in some parts too. Comes with trailers, making-of, bloopers and a commentary track with Pegg, Moran, Schwimmer (who still sounds like Ross after breaking up with Rachel), and strangely Pegg's real-life mother (why?), this release is worth a purchase and/or viewing. In fact, I enjoyed it more than Pegg's Hot Fuzz, which was a pretty good film in itself too. A nice surprise of a movie by two men you didn't think had it in them. Just ignore the title, okay?

3227509,4,B000WXDMLE,"Run, Fat Boy, Run may very well be the sleeper of 2008. Directed by TV personality David Schwimmer, and starring an array of exceptionally talented comedic actors, the movie is an unexpected delight. Those prepared for little more than fat jokes, gratuitous bad language, and a predictable plot will find a film augmented with really funny physical humor,  quick paced hilarious soliloquy, and a mild story line punctuated with gentleness,connectedness and redemption.

There is no question that Simon Pegg, in the starring role of Denise (the fat boy) has a very exciting film future ahead of him. His acting is nuanced-- his capacity for telling an entire story with just facial expressions can not be understated. He is a joy to watch. Schwimmer rounded out all the characters with a fine ensemble.

If you need a non-challenging, light and lively pick me up, this is your film.",1226361600,,881,4.979591836734694
3227510,3,B000WXDMLE,"Not bad for a film directed by David Schwimmer but this is definitely not Simon Peggs best as it fails to deliver the clever British humor that we saw in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. This film felt like David Schwimmer is an Anglophile gone Director that slapped together a cute film with many funny scenes however the film dragged on with cliche twists and a predictable but satisfying ending. The use of Hank Azaria as the antagonist felt like a waste of talent, how can he take one of the funniest people and make them a villain? I found it hard to believe and I felt Hank Azaria and Simon Pegg could've had much better chemistry together. Definitely a good rental but worth buying only if you are a die hard Simon Pegg fan.",1225324800,,730,4.335766423357664
3227511,4,B000WXDMLE,"What a great story.  Similar to the movie ""Saint Ralph"", this is a Running movie that is fun to watch and a great teaching tool.  The movie teaches that cheating is never right and trying again and again, getting up after a fall is always the right answer, quiting never is!  We can all try and we can laugh as we do it.  We never have to do it alone but together everything is possible!  This movie will make several lists of top 100 sports movies, and it should make several more top 50 lists.  ""Never give up!""  Running is fun and this movie shows how much fun it is!

It's one of those girl found, girl lost, girl regained story lines that have you initially rooting against the poor smuck (Simon Pegg) who eventually wins you over and has you rooting for him at the end.  Lots of good entertainment value provided by Pegg, Hank Azaria and the lovely Thandie Newton.

I cried, I laughed, I was touched, enough said. This movie also has a very good ending, it's not a sappy, slobbery love fest like almost all the other chick flicks in the world have at the end. Another thing I liked about it was it captured something real, something most movies can't ever come close to grasping because it portrays a young man struggling through something a lot of people are dealing with, most movies aren't believable now, at least not to me anyways.",1223856000,,671,4.283464566929134
3227518,2,B000WXDMLE,"Many popular-culture enthusiasts will purchase this work simply because of Michael Ian Black and Simon Pegg's involvement. And, this is where the trouble begins. The enormous creative-talent invested in this film should have yielded an amusing, innovative work. Instead, Run, Fatboy, Run is just another rom-com in a long list of predictable rom-coms.

Perhaps most problematic, the screenplay heavily relies on film cliches. From the first four minutes, the viewer can plot the entire film: disappointing from a writer as clever as Michael Ian Black (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stella/dp/B000FZETJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stella</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-State/dp/B00104A0W8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The State</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Custom-Van-And-50-Other-Mind-Blowing-Essays-that-Will-Blow-Your-Mind-All-Over-Your-Face/dp/1416964053/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Custom Van: And 50 Other Mind-Blowing Essays that Will Blow Your Mind All Over Your Face</a>). The same can be noted of Simon Pegg (who contributed to the playful, witty&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hot-Fuzz/dp/B000RJO578/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hot Fuzz</a>). The collaboration of Black and Pegg should have been synergistic ... but Run, Fatboy, Run is decidedly trite. (And, as a warning, it's steeped in both low-brow and physical humor).

Though nothing can redeem this half-hearted film, David Schwimmer's direction was excellent. The former ""Friends"" star has proven that his talents extend beyond on-screen work. Likewise, Dylan Moran commits to his role as the ""fair-weather friend"" ... and while his part is entirely one-dimensional, the viewer can note his effort. (He is a phenomenal actor ... be sure to check out his other work!)

This is your typical rom-com with all the rom-com trappings. For Pegg fans, this film will prove a tremendous disappointment -- there is nothing nuanced about this work. For Black fans, this work will seem all too obvious -- there is not even a hint of his trademark ""kookiness"" here. If you are hoping for a reprisal of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, or even The State, just walk-away NOW!! You will only be frustrated. However, if you dig mainstream works like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Lose-a-Guy-in-10-Days/dp/B000094J7Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Failure-to-Launch/dp/B000FILV1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Failure to Launch</a>&nbsp;(and there is NOTHING wrong with that), than this film will appeal to you.",1223769600,4,2981,7.7105263157894735

Partially because of the almost cliche ""Underdog wins despite all odds"" theme,partially because its the directorial debut of David Schwimmer - my expectation were not set too high. I was pleasantly surprised, perhaps even overwhelmed by the excellent realistic acting exhibited by all characters involved, from major to minor, but above all by Simon Pegg. I believe this movie will prove truly inspirational to many, who are stuck in a seemingly hopeless situation, no matter what their circumstances may be, who are determined to better themselves and change their fate.",1223683200,,648,5.362745098039215

3227521,5,B000WXDMLE,"I thought this was a very funny movie! Everybody did an awesome job! Simon Pegg gets better every time I see him. He plays Dennis Doyle who left his pregnant fiance named Libby at the alter. 5 years later, they still see each other, so Dennis can see his son, but Libby is still upset. Dennis is a security guard at a women's store. Libby has been going out with a guy named Whit who is going to run in the Nike River Marathon in London, and to win Libby's respect, he decides to run too. His friend, Gordon, and his landlord, Mr. Ghoshdashtidar, decide to help him train. Whit proposes to Libby, but makes Dennis upset because he's still in love with her. Throughout the 26-mile race, Dennis pushes himself to finish, even when Whit injures him. If you love comedy, you'll love RUN FATBOY RUN!!!",1223078400,,796,4.421768707482993

He left the woman he loves, Elizabeth(Thandie Newton) at the altar when she was pregnant with his baby, and he's had five years to sit around and think about it; and he's finally decided to do change his situation and do something about it....
by running a marathon.

This however turns out to be quite the problem since this mundane mall security guard Dennis is one out-of-shape British man. But with the help of Whit(Hank Azaria) Elizabeth's overachieving new boyfriend to spite him, his adorable son
Jake(Matthew Fenton) and his team managers Gordon(Dylan Moran) and Mr. Goshdashtidar(Harish Patel) the finish line is beginning to come into focus.

With a director like David Schwimmer(in his film debut) and a screenplay by Simon Pegg himself and the hilarious Michael Ian Black, it's simple yet accurate to say, it's a little magical.

It may be a predictable, but it's full of heart, humor and that feel-good-feeling that reminds one of 'It's A Wonderful Life.'

In my eyes, it's a new classic; However something that doesn't give you a bad taste in the mouth when it's over is a highly underrated quality these days.",1222732800,,1217,4.8647342995169085
