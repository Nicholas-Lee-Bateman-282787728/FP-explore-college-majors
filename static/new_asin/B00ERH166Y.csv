8608666,2,B00ERH166Y,"It's been said the Uriah Heep were the real Spinal Tap of rock and roll, and although you can hear it in a few of the lyrics and over the top theatrics, this disc is made in such horrible quality that most of the time it's hard to tell. Once again we have another DVD from the fine rip-off artists at Laser Media. 41 Minutes of torture at the hands of poor DVD authoring, horrible sound quality, bad picture quality and a straight up lie on the front cover of the music that is contained inside. The worst thing about the disc is that there are moments, even though this is obviously recorded from an old VHS tape, that the audio and video of what could have been shine through for several moments during the running time. If someone reputable had got their hands on this material and cleaned it up, we could have had a nice hodge-podge of a collection to enjoy once in a while. However, thanks to Laser Media all we get is a coaster to throw in the trash.

Uriah Heep were giants of heavy stoner prog rock back in their early to late 70's heyday. They put out big, bombastic albums that somehow sold like the cheapest new drug in town. They were a mess of hair, falsetto vocals, loud Keyboards and songs about witches, wizards and stealin'. Some form of the band still tours to this day, and I'm not sure if there are any original members left in it. Well, this video tries to show them doing their greatest hits. The front cover makes it sound like it's a T.V. broadcast from the 70's. While most of the material is from that time, there is some 80's garbage thrown in, and the live clips only make up about 3/4 of the DVD. The rest of the clips are promo videos, and the best of all of this is only in barely passable VHS quality. The sound is surprisingly decent throughout, and quite good in a few clips. Here is the track listing;

1. Stealin'(Live)
2. Tears in My Eyes (Live in Japan)
3. Easy Livin' (Promo Video)
4. Gypsy
5. I Won't Mind
6. Sweet Lorraine (Live-Horribly distorted sound)
7. Wizard (Nice Sounding promo video-""highlight"" of the DVD)
8. Traveler In Time (Live in Japan)
9. Blind Eye (Footage doesn't even match the song)
10. One More Night (dubbed ""live"")

Uriah Heep may be hard to come by on DVD. but don't get tricked into buying this mess. This DVD is in full frame with barely passable sound. There are no opening or end credits, and no information about the band or where these clip come from. The back of the case says that this release is in Dolby Digital, and I highly doubt that. I tend not to believe much from a company that can't even spell the titles of the tracks correctly on the back of the package, and trick the buyer into thinking their getting a 70's concert. Stay very far away from this release. No price is low enough to bother to have it in your collection.",1411344000,4,2805,4.308712121212121

8608669,3,B00ERH166Y,"Knowing that video of the original Heep is hard to come by I was willing to be Happy with just some kind of visual compilation
of them. Well it has a little of that but in a very minimum quality. Two songs feature a different singer, a major bummer to my
low requirement of original line-up. Also No Ken Hensley on those either, that's just unacceptable. They keep the camera
on the singer mostly so you won't notice but you do by the omission.
 The songs with dubbing of studio versions of the music actual works for me because of course it sounds great and you
get to see the band in some live studio lip-sync action. That's worth something. It's not a live concert video and the few
songs that are, sound pretty crappy and the boys weren't thinking of how they would ""come off"" 40 years on. Nor were the
film crew. They more likely were thinking of how they were ""getting off"" that moment and the performance suffered for it.
 I'm glad to have a little footage of original Uriah Heep but it definitely is poor overall. I'm generous with 3 stars.
  Ken Hensley is the supercool Original ""Freak"". God bless him , He's still alive. Mick Box forges on with a band called
Uriah Heep and they're ""Great"" in concert, just not like the original. Go see them. It's all we've got for the nostalgia. They appear to know the value of a
sober performance.",1387929600,5,1345,4.389558232931727
8608670,1,B00ERH166Y,"I've been a fan of Uriah Heep since I first listened to Look at Yourself back in 1974. I thought this would be a great dvd. Turns out I was wrong. The sound quality is atrocious, studio versions dubbed in to ""live"" footage, ""live"" performances that don't even match the song that is playing and numerous other things that just make this dvd a waste of time and money. I know there isn't much out there, but stay away from this one. It isn't worth it.",1387584000,7,450,4.244186046511628
