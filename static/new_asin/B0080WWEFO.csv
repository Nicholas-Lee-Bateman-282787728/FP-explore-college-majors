Shawn Michaels: My Journey
This is the final (to date) Shawn Michaels DVD set that is in the same as Triple H's where the only person you'll hear from is the profiled wrestler himself, which is Shawn in this case (with Michael Cole interviewing him), while also watching a series of his high profile bouts along with some rare & forgotten ones. Some of subjects you'll hear Shawn talk about in between matches include his early career in World Class & AWA, who intimidated him when he first game to WWE, analyzing the tag team division during his time as part of the Rockers, how he felt he was able to have good matches with anyone, how he didn't like the ""Boyhood Dream"" story behind his first title reign, what memories made him say ""I'm sorry"" to Michael Cole, the blowup he had at the WrestleMania XIV press conference, his relationships with certain wrestlers, the one person that made him go ""I'm going to have to train harder than I usually do"", his relationship with the fans in Canada, and his personal life such as his children.
Various matches include a match from World Class Championship Wrestling vs. One Man Gang, his AWA matches with Marty Jannetty as the Midnight Rockers against Nasty Boys along with Buddy Rose & Doug Summers, tag matches as part of the Rockers against Brain Busters & Hart Foundation, an Intercontinental Title match vs. Bret Hart, European Championship Match vs. British Bulldog (One Night Only '97), two matches vs. Undertaker (WrestleMania 25) including the casket match that injured his back so bad that he had to retire (Royal Rumble '98), two matches vs. Chris Jericho (WrestleMania XIX & Unforgiven '08), Ric Flair (Bad Blood '03), Kurt Angle (WrestleMania 21), and two matches against Randy Orton (Survivor Series '07) including a fatal four way that also featured John Cena & Edge (Backlash '07). Also included are various matches matches from ""RAW"" against British Bulldog (Mar. '95), Sid (Sept. '95), 1-2-3 Kid (Mar. '96), Mankind (Sept. '97), his Boot Camp Match vs. Triple H from the Tribute To The Troops show (Dec. '05), and a heel promo he did in Montreal during his feud against Hulk Hogan in August of 2005.

Both DVD's aren't full of 5 star classic wrestling matches but a mixed of lost classics in either quality, emotional/memorable moments, and just classic entertainment. If you were a heavy fan of WWE during the mid-80's to early 90's then you don't want to miss this walk down memory lane but for newer fans, I would still recommend because this was just great entertainment in & out of the ring overall.  Two match anthologies I would go out of my way to see.",1343520000,,6367,4.815356489945155
