8514188,5,B007C3LWAA,"I had this on BETA when it was first released in the mid - 80's so I'm glad to once again be able to view this great performance. Though many UFO fans malign this era of the band (with Atomic Tommy) I find the writing and performances both on this live recording and on the Misdemeanor album to be excellent. Sure, it sounds a bit dated with the typical 80's keyboard sounds but make no mistake, Atomic Tommy's guitar soars above the keyboards.

I don't understand some of the reviewers who say Atomic Tommy ""overplays"" everything. That reminds me of the part in the Amadeus film (about Mozart) when people at the time (even the emperor of Austria) were ridiculing Mozart for his music having ""too many notes."" Atomic Tommy is a truly unique player and a virtuoso at that. Of note is the fact that he is certainly unlike any player UFO had previously or has since played with them. His style incorporates heavy use of the tremolo bar; something not really UFO - like. His style is refreshing and he shows a flair for melody like virtually all of the other great guitarists that have played with UFO. I would argue that he doesn't ""overplay"" anything but, rather, plays an aggressive yet melodic style that's simply different to what most UFO fans are accustomed.

The only thing that most viewers will find hard to take are the fashions! I felt like I stepped back into the 80's with the poofy hair styles and Chess King - style outfits. For those from who lived through this era you'll get a nice shot of nostalgia. When the camera pans the audience I felt like I was looking through my high school yearbook! Viewers not from the 80's will certainly get a chuckle. Despite the fashion, the music is phenomenal; don't let the time period scare you away...rock and roll is rock and rock after all.

One note of caution: If you have kids you might want to view this on your own before letting them see this. There's a bit of nudity toward the end of the performance when the band has a topless female model dressed in a cowboy hat prance around by the drum risers. This was no doubt meant to emulate a feature of the artwork from the Misdemeanor album that the tour was supporting. As a parent, I wouldn't want you to have one of those awkward moments if one of your little ones is in the room when this shows up on the screen.",1466553600,2,2325,4.414918414918415
8514189,4,B007C3LWAA,"UFO fan from 70's and only saw them once with Schenker and many times with Paul Chapman who was just as good. This was after Moog had
replaced entire band and brought back Raymond for Misdemeanor album and tour. The band all look 'glam' which was popular but Moog has
his usual 70's long hair mop top and a T-shirt sweater with no sleeves and still had his golden voice. The music was pretty good for the time
and should have been a much bigger album for them but today sounds a little dated and doesn't fit with UFO's best work in 70's and early 80's!
Atomic Tommy on guitar was typical over playing fret guitar wizard you heard over and over and just not my kind of guitar playing but he was
a great find for Moog at the time. The band is tight and put on a good show but it's mostly songs from their latest album which is okay if you
collect UFO live shows like I have done over the years so this is a treat to have on dvd. The sound hasn't been improved since the VHS I
had bought years ago and the quality of picture is about the same. But if you don't have this era of UFO you have to check out this concert.",1455580800,,1114,4.0225225225225225

8514193,5,B007C3LWAA,"I have gotten on this group's bandwagon only recently. They give solid live performances, and also have a deep catalog of good to great hard rock. In my opinion, if they had not suffered so many personnel changes over the years, I feel they would have received much more recognition !  They are well respected by their peers and artists in all genres of music. Phil Mogg is an underated vocalist / frontman ... as is the guitarist who replaced Mike Schenker, that being Paul Chapman. This DVD provides an excellent look at this band ....",1395014400,2,537,4.59375
8514194,3,B007C3LWAA,"ok i'm going to listen to you on this one. it's just too bad dream the dream or one heart isn't on this, i wasn't lucky to see ufo with michael schenker but i too like the other fill in guys, i seen them fri june 8, 1979 i think paul chapman was the guitarist? but ac/dc was with them with bon scott $4.80 concert ticket and no place to run 1980 still have the shirt and third time may 27, 1982 ufo and aldo nova but you know something i really like new ufo too sharks, walk on water-schenker, you are here, seven deadly-vinnie moore, the visitor, monkey puzzle-jeff kohlman, and where you familiar with mogg and the signs of four mellow stuff but still good, guess i'll have to purchase rockpalast schenkers first album in 1981 michael schenker group then i even like MSG- robin mcauley, but phil mogg has always been the favorite, i see its 12 bucks and people say thats good also anyway thx for the info good day!! misdemeanor and making contact were available together on cd at on time, yes i like the music after chapman left but i think this concert is put together with band aids and the glue is phil mogg and paul raymond, i like  i turned out to like the new ufo vinnie moore  stuff, and sharks and walk on water  even like watching showtime but if you want nostalgic ufo then go for it but those albums and times back then were better to listen on record or at least include mechanix, i think hardrock legends vol 1 is at least better all original band members except schenker so i wasted another 12 bucks i'm hoping my michael schenker rock palast 1981 orinal cocert first album will at least be better i'm thinking it will.",1391990400,3,1635,4.3019480519480515
