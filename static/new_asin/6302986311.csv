7833595,3,6302986311,"Given that this movie was made in the late 1950's, I was surprised at the subject matter of human euthanasia. The subjects of adultery and promiscuity were also thrown into the mix. Nonetheless, the movie came across as soap opera. Burton's acting improved in later years.",1307664000,,272,4.934782608695652
7833596,1,6302986311,"The absolutely dreadful telling of a mercy killing, which amounted to an ode to Peyton Place even down to cinematography sweeping over a New England fishing village.  The set was so typically back-lot Warner Brothers that it was about as believable of small-town life as The Andy Griffith Show.

The storyline made no sense whatsoever.  Why would a financially well-off person stricken with Hodgkins Lymphoma lie in what amounts to nothing more than an infirmary, when the best hospital and doctors can be found a short drive away in Boston.  Naturally the hospital corridors are empty of any patients or doctors, aside from the principal players, as are the town streets.  One wonders if Warner Brothers couldn't afford enough extras even to fill out the pews of the town church.  Richard Burton never dons a hospital coat let alone scrubs despite the fact that he is playing the doctor.

Business at the town jail and courtroom are equally preposterous, as the prisoner, again Burton, wanders in and out of an open cell.  Also since when does an American judge refer to the defendant as the ""prisoner"".  Obviously no one writing this script consulted with anyone in the legal profession.

Once again, could Warner Brothers not afford wardrobe.  Burton wears the same suit & tie thoughout the picture and Poor Angie Dickinson is either in a nurses uniform or scantily clad.  Barbara Rush fairs better with a lovely wardrobe straight from Bergdorf Goodman.  But would a woman spending countless hours at the bedside of her dying husband, dress like she was off to a luncheon at the Plaza Hotel?  Not even a hair out of place or a worry-line on her lovely face.  Aah the unreality of Hollywood in the 1950's.",1183334400,,1707,4.837931034482758
