8237151,4,B00104XYJE,"I agree with some of the earlier reviewers that the DVD is edited and half of the seminar was missing. But for the price of the DVD I still believe the value to be good. The only other option is to pay thousands of dollars and attend one of Tony's in person events for a couple of days.

I found the DVD to be very helpful because I'm already in my dream career, at least one phase of it. But I needed a little extra help on deciding what the next step was. But if I was completely clueless as to what to do with my life, then I wouldn't have found the information so crystal clear.

To expect that a 45 minute DVD to tell you exactly what to do with your life is unrealistic. In fact, most people already know what they want to do but they're afraid it's impossible for them to achieve it. I'd advise anyone viewing this DVD to be aware that it will not tell you WHAT to do or even HOW. But it will help you get clear about who you are so that you can later go out in the world and fill in the missing pieces.",1337558400,,1010,3.921951219512195

8237153,2,B00104XYJE,"I was extremely disppointed by both the CD and the DVD.  The CD is Tony Robbins interviewing Dr. Steven Covey.  If I had wanted to hear what Dr. Covey had to say I would have purchased one of his CDs.  The description of the DVD states that it will ""help you uncover what truly brings joy and fulfillment in your work.""  The only information that this DVD gives is that there are three kinds of people, the talent, the investors and the sales people - figure out which one you are and then find the other two.  Not a word about finding your gift.  Since that was the subtitle I expected SOME information on that.",1253404800,5,612,4.278260869565218
8237154,3,B00104XYJE,I wish they would not have edited as much of the information shared during his seminar and felt the DVD was too short.  His voice sounded like he needed some rest as well.  I felt that I recieved half of what I was expecting.,1222128000,4,225,4.090909090909091
