8363760,4,B002C9KP4S,Definitely better than Mega Movie Myths.  Mostly Adam and Jamie before they got the interns.  We hear a lot from an expert on Urban Legends.  It seems like they did a better job early on in testing what viewers really consider to be the main myth.,1386288000,,247,4.326086956521739

Today is Jan 9th 2010.
Lets be perfectly hosest with people. The reviews you see from August and before are bull....! How on earth can you reveiw something that is still OVER 30 days from actual release? You cant get it on the discovery channel, Amazon, any marketplace seller or any other merchant legally on earth! You can buy a copy today but even the Amazon email says it won't be shipped until the 24th of Feb, 2010.
Maybe by reading the reviews and information above and on discovery channel. The myths they bust in this collection have been done on regular season ep, but they have never been complied in one set!
People who reveiw items should actually watch them or at least of had a ""ACTUAL"" chance to have watched them. As for the July review thats here. Thats actually a normal practice for any show. I must add I have never seen a behind the sences or bloop reel or anythin where either man used foul lang,
.
SO WHAT DID THE OTHERS VIEW IN ORDER TO WRITE THE REVIEWS? Just report them and be done with it!",1262995200,3,1078,4.341584158415841

8363765,3,B002C9KP4S,"UPDATE: This DVD is now even less of a value, even for casual fans, since the price of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Collection-1/dp/B000NO23W6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Collection 1</a>&nbsp;is now $9.99 and Amazon is currently listing this one for $10.49.  Collection 1 contains 12 episodes, plus a bonus ""behind-the-scenes"" episode on 4 discs.  What's more, three out of the four episodes on Urban Legends are on the first disc of Collection 1.  If you really must have all four, the fourth is on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BIG-BLASTS-Collection/dp/B001FRNBBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BIG BLASTS Collection</a>, which contains a total of 10 episodes.  It's a bit pricey here for some reason, but could potentially be found for less elsewhere, possibly used.

Now, for the sake of completeness, here is my original review:

I have to start by saying that the offers shown on this page (as I'm typing this) are all overpriced.  I bought my copy at Walmart for $9.96, and it's also available on their website for $12.73.  Unfortunately, the site doesn't show the correct cover art -- I have uploaded a ""Customer Image"" which is the image they use.  Even though the title is completely different, this is apparently ""temp art"", and the UPC matches ""Urban Legends"", which is what I received when I placed an order.

I have no problems with the episodes, they are all among the best episodes of the show, but for anyone who already owns the previous collections from Image, there is nothing new.  I really liked the packaging, so I bought it anyway, but the first three episodes are on Disc 1 of Collection 1, and the fourth is on the BIG BLASTS Collection, both of which can be had for about the same price as the sellers are asking here and contain MANY more episodes.

All in all a decent product, but as they say, ""buyer beware"".",1247443200,6,1930,5.354304635761589
