939426,5,6304828969,"I just tried this tape for the first time.  Since it's a Firm Parts tape, it's cut from parts of original Firm workouts, in this case, The Tortoise and The Hare.  It's an extremely well cut tape, and with added sections of  Tracie Long explaining where you need to be, so it doesn't seem disjointed  at all.  This tape is great for weight-bearing exercises.  It does have  many (6 or 7 I think) sets of leg presses, which require a 12-14""  stool and weights.  Since Tracie Long is such a great instructor, you  really feel like you can do all the work on the tape even though it does  seem like a lot to me (a beginning to intermediate exerciser).  I would  totally recommend it to anyone who wants to work on definition in the  thighs and glutes.  There is also a lot of good arm work as well.  And it's  just over 40 minutes, making it ideal when you want a quicker workout.",958003200,20,876,4.2439024390243905
939427,5,6304828969,"This is the first weight training tape where I had all of the necessary equipment!  You'll need weights (obviously) but only 3 pairs at the weight you feel comfortable using - you can use an optional barbell for some of  the exercises, but I don't, I just use my dumbbells.  You'll need a tall  step (12-14"") but I use a trunk that I have, and you'll need a chair  (or the tall step) for bicep curls.  YOU DON'T NEED A WORKOUT BENCH!  The  tape concentrates on the thighs, arms, bust, back, and buns. There is no  abdominal section or any work on the calves, but to really concentrate on  time the time crunch (it only takes about 42 minutes), abs can be done on  other days.  The instruction is step by step, but without all of the  constant talking, and you can tell the instructor Tracie Long is working  hard too.  Since she goes step by step, she also gives you enough time to  get prepared for the next exercise, which other tapes don't do (Denise  Austin's Totally Firm), and then you're rushing to get the next equipment.  I would highly recommend this video! It is great for all fitness levels -  just use higher weights for the more advanced.",956793600,24,1152,4.4
939428,4,6304828969,"I did this tape expecting it to be the biggest challenge of all the Firm tapes and I have to say I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, you will get a pretty strenuous workout, but frankly I have found other Firm tapes  more demanding and challenging than this one. The first five volumes come  immediately to mind. And certainly the first tape and the tape with Jane  Gretsky are as tough if not tougher than this.",955497600,9,416,4.376623376623376
939429,4,6304828969,"This tape is worth the sweat.  You don't have to have all the equipment to use it.  I use a milkcrate for my step, and I use 3 and 5 lb hand weights throughout (I just pretend they are barbells).  :)  I have BICEPS for the  first time in my life, and I have only used 5 lb weights so far!  The only  reason I give it 4 stars is because there are no abs and the stretching  segments aren't that great.",945907200,16,400,3.792682926829268
939430,5,6304828969,"Tracie Long is one of the best Firm instructors I have ""worked with"".  Her form is great and I love the fact that she gives pointers as she works out.  I like to use this on the days when I am not using any  of my Firm Total Body tapes.  It's also a good alternative when you want a  tape that leaves you feeling like you have worked out at the max when you  don't have a whole hour to work out.  I definitely give this five stars.  Check out any of the other Firm tapes.  You won't be disappointed!",930700800,4,499,3.91

7879390,5,6304828969,"I've been a fan of the Firm workouts for over 10 years. They are the most effective workout I've ever done and as a fitness trainer I recommend them to everyone. The Classic workout series is the cream of the crop. I've tried almost all of their tapes and cds but none compare to the classics, especially Tough Tape, Total Body, and 5 Day Abs. These 3 encompass ALL anyone needs to get into great physical condition without going to a gym or even leaving the house.",1315008000,,465,4.35632183908046
7879391,3,6304828969,"I own a collection of about 40 of The Firm's workout DVDs. I find this one to be functional, yet lackluster; compared to other Firm videos, it's not that tough. It's a compilation of scenes from The Tortoise and The Hare (classic The Firm videos) both lead by Tracie Long. The video focuses on sculpting, so there aren't any true aerobic portions, with the exception of the warm up.

Pros
-Focus on sculpting
-Moderately challenging
-Tracie Long is very pleasant, has an awesome body (motivation!), and is great at cuing
-Doesn't skimp on stretching, as newer Firm workouts tend to do
-No Ab section

Cons
-Doesn't provide any guidance on weight of barbell. (It looks the barbell they use in the video is about 18-22 lbs.)
-Uses quite a bit of equipment. You'll need tall (14"") step, short step, towel, and barbell in addition to a slew of dumbbells.
-Outer thigh and calves aren't worked at all
-No Ab section
-Hard on the knees (make sure you keep proper form, pressing your body weight into the heels)",1268784000,,1004,4.666666666666667
7879392,5,6304828969,"This is the best workout tape!  I have 3 kids, 3 and under and this is the only thing I used to help me lose the weight all three times.  I lost all my pregnancy weight in less than 5 months, each time, and I didn't even start working out until sometimes as late as 3 months after their births.  Anyway, more importantly, it works!  I look better than I did in high school!",1168819200,4,373,4.0
7879393,4,6304828969,"This is one of the most sought after Firm videos that are out of print.  It is a compilation of the strength segments of the Tortoise and the Hare which are also out of print, but without the ballroom aerobics.  Tracie Long leads this workout (as she led both Tortoise and Hare) plus there snippets of her in between segments letting you know what is coming up.

There are several sets of leg presses in this workout, one of the sets has 18 reps per leg, while another one has alternating sets on each leg 7 reps each side twice, then 3 reps each side twice, very tough.  All the muscle groups are covered well, in addition to the many sets of leg presses you will see squats, lunges, dips and plie squats for lower body.  The upper body exercises include upright rows, overhead presses, tricep kickbacks, french presses, pushups, pec flies and bicep curls. A barbell is used for a lot of the exercises, but dumbells are easily substituted if you do not have a barbell.

A good short challenging workout for those with limited time.  Unfortunately it is hard to find though, but worth the money if you can find a copy.  Tracie Long is an excellent instructor, and you can tell that she is working hard along with you.  Susan

Harris (of Volume 1) appears as a background exerciser which is an interesting tidbit.  Worth looking for for die hard Firmies.",1126396800,3,1353,4.504098360655738
7879394,5,6304828969,"After reading all of the rave reviews of this tape, I just HAD to have a copy of my own, so I got 1. First of all, let me say that Tracie is THE BEST Firm instructor. Her cueing & pointers are top-notch. The workout is challanging & thorough. Like others have said, it's a mixture of Tortoise & Hare minus any cardio or ab work. After doing this workout 3x a week for 3 weeks, I'm seeing serious muscle in my upper body. I follow this workout with Sculpted Buns, Hips & Thighs for ab & floor work. If you're lucky enough to find a copy, GET IT!",1081555200,5,544,4.0
7879395,5,6304828969,"This video is fantastic, you get results in no time at all. It is also excellent when you don't have time to train at a gym. Its the next best thing to being in a gym.",984009600,4,167,3.6666666666666665
7879396,4,6304828969,"I have 9 FIRM tapes, and when I got this, I had to psych myself up for it, thinking it would be very difficult.  The weights are heavier than in any other tape I've done, but I still got through the whole thing without a hitch.  The toughest so far is the Basic Body Sculpting (an old one, and a lot of sexy-voiced ""oohs"" from the instructor, but I've been working out daily for the last six months, and still cannot make it all the way through that tape - the legwork's a KILLER !  This is good, I did work up a sweat, but I didn't get sore and I didn't feel too challenged.",975024000,5,575,3.982608695652174
7879397,5,6304828969,"I've been working my way to more challenging tapes, and this one is amazing!  What I like the best is the fact that you don't need to invest in  a whole bunch of stuff to get started, I had some weights and something to  step on and it works great!
I also like the fact that Tracie is not one  of those chirpy, rah-rah instructors who can't shut up - she knows her  stuff and leads you through the tough moves without annoying you.
The  moves are varied and intense, you are really working your muscles with this  tape and you feel the results from the first time you use Tough Tape.  I  recommend it and I will be buying other Firm tapes to mix my workouts  around.",969235200,8,666,4.1328125
7879398,5,6304828969,"I found ""Tough Tape"" here on Amazon, as I searched for a tape to take the place of the gym I just stopped working near. This is the BEST exercise video I have ever seen.  If you are looking for dancing &/or  aerobics, go somewhere else.  If you want a workout that equals what you  get with a personal trainer, this is IT.  Tracey will warm you up, then  work your quads, glutes, and arms till you're ready to drop, then she  stretches you out.  Like everyone mentions, the only weakness is the lack  of AB work.  Beginners are best advised not to complete the entire workout  section of tape the first time (fast forward to stretching when you've had  enough).",964483200,8,661,4.371900826446281
