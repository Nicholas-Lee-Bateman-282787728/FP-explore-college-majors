8076947,3,B000AABL3K,"I bought this DVD last year. This documentary is good, interesting and very well done. However most people interested in Area 51 won't learn anything new. This is the ""basic stuff"", and 50 minutes is short for this kind of documentary. They should have done a 2 hour episode. But it's a good addition to a collection.",1309392000,,317,4.578947368421052
8076948,5,B000AABL3K,Will purchase from this seller again.  Shipping was on time and product was in the condition stated in the description.,1284249600,,119,4.95
8076949,5,B000AABL3K,"This History Channel documentary is one of the best on the subject of Area 51. It ranks up there with the hard to find documentary ""Dreamland"". It has some very good footage of the early days of the U2 and A12 days, as well as a fairly good accounting of the EG&G ""Janet"" flights from Vegas to Area 51. This is a high quality video as are all History Channel DVDs.",1278374400,,364,4.140845070422535
8076950,4,B000AABL3K,"True, this DVD has information that is already known to most Area 51 buffs.  For those that are new to the subject, this DVD is very informative.  I own 4 other documentaries on Area 51 and they all include facts that other DVDs may not have.  This one probably being the latest of the Area 51 releases mentions why the installation was built, the different nicknames the base has, how federal law doesn't apply there, what may happen to anyone who challenges the security measures, etc.  The fact that our government denies the base's existance is totally absurd!  They say that ""the base doesn't exist and neither do it's employees"".  Later on, lawyer Jonathan Turley reveals that 2 workers at the base got sick and died from radiation poisoning.  This is a guy that fought tooth-and-nail to get the government to admit that there is a researching facility at Groom Lake (another name for the base).  Very interesting information.  Check it out.",1249430400,4,947,4.796296296296297
8076951,2,B000AABL3K,"this is a 50 to 60 minute dvd, it has almost nothing new for a area 51 or ufo buff, in mostly has pics of the entry sighs to the area 51, and all interviewers say basicly the same thing that the area contains secrets, for these reasons itself i would`nt have bought it.",1177804800,15,269,4.0
