8182553,4,B000O1715W,"I'll happily go along with the other reviewers, this short opera is pure enjoyment with no profundity or conflict to disturb  the moment. The production, that is, orchestra with three people shifting before it with a few makeshift props, seems admirably suited to the simplicity of the plot and ""songs"".Ghyslaine Raphanel and Matthieu Lcroart are near perfect as wife and husband, Franck Cassard,,is satisfactory as the wife's suitor and the husbands apparent friend. The trios are just fine, Cassard a bit weak on his solos. To add to the fun, as has been pointed out by others, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star plays a prominent role as solo and trio, with admirable effects.
All-in-all, the opera is a delightful 84 minutes of well-done thoughtless entertainment. Just the thing for a period when one simply wants to relax for a bit and forget the troubles of the world and of the household.",1278288000,11,891,4.94
8182554,5,B000O1715W,"With the orchestra the stage, the conductor and instruments almost become a character.  Three characters, no chorus, but cute.  Ghyslaine Raphanel has the most amazing opening.  Almost 10 minutes alone on stage -- part of it not saying anything, part a long solioquy until her first aria.  I have never seen anyone hold a stage for that long, so well.  The sound is uneven -- the performers do not appear to be miked, but use overhead and floor mikes.  The lighting is also a bit uneven, at times a bit to reflective off skin, but all in all this is a very satisfying production",1217030400,11,578,4.509615384615385
8182555,4,B000O1715W,"Adam's delightful short opera (two acts, but played here in one 84-minute block) receives a fine semi-staged mounting at the Theatre Imperial de la Musique Compiegne.  A few doors, a table and chairs interspersed with the orchestra -- this production's focus is squarely on the performers, and they don't disappoint.  Ghyslaine Raphanel and Franck Cassard are perhaps a trifle mature to represent love's young dream, while Matthieu Lecroart isn't the doddering cuckold the libretto describes.  That said, the trio throw themselves into the fun with gusto and fine musicianship -- the variations on ""Ah! vous dirai-je, maman,"" that French version of our old friend, ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,"" are the score's highlight, used to ironic effect here, and show the cast decorating away at their formidable best.  Special mention, too, is due the hilarious subtitles -- perhaps the worst I've even seen.  More errors than would seem humanly possible; the question is if the translator lacked fluency in French or English (or both)???  Adam's ceaseless flow of melody still delights; perhaps it's time to dust off more of his vast output for 21st century audiences.  If you're fond of comic opera, this DVD's high-spirited, refreshing, and most worthwhile.",1211932800,14,1255,5.308080808080808
