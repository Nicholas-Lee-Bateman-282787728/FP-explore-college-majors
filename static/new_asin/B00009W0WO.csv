7993542,2,B00009W0WO,"Although the Wompkee creatures themselves are cute and the overall story is fine, the Ice Queen continually uses the word ""hate"" throughout her scenes in the movie. Perhaps I'm in the minority here, but I don't like hearing that word, particularly with the inflection used in a young children's movie. I don't quite understand why it was necessary.",1142553600,,348,5.017241379310345
7993543,5,B00009W0WO,My family loves this movie!  We first saw it on PBS and fell in love with the sweet green Wompkee creatures.  My mom got the DVD for my little brother (who's 6)and he watches is a million times a day.  He even makes up new stories for the Wompkees and tells us all about them.  Also the songs are really sweet and get stuck in your head.  P.S. Don't tell anyone that I watch the mnovie over his shoulder sometimes (I'm 14).,1071014400,2,423,4.109756097560975
