I think Daniel Eric Gold was the best actor in it. Jamie Kennedy really got fat and ugly in it. don't waste your time, people!",1338249600,4,273,4.372549019607843
4481614,1,B004V2S4V0,"The story starts out slowly and drags most of the way.  I must say that it starts to develop interesting relationships between characters and has a new twist on the 'Matrix' theme.  However, the writers couldn't come up with logical conclusions with the character relationships and ends them abruptly. The movie reaches a point were it is quite depressing but in order to come up with a happy ending, the writers come up with an absolutely ridiculous end.",1333756800,4,455,4.82051282051282
4481615,3,B004V2S4V0,"On a warm, rainless week in May the 'West Philly Grounds' coffee shop had its usual hodgepodge of customers.  Among the regulars there is a man who spends his days in the window's light scribbling in his paper notebook, there is a woman who finds the shop's causal atmosphere perfect to interview job applicants, and then there is a man sitting in the windowless corner - it is well-lighted: it's just his heart that is dark ... he is the dealer.

If you are Tommy, you are drowning in your cravings, desperate to dampen your pain in a fog of numbness ... you would do anything for drugs;  the dealer is about to throw you an anchor of dangerous demands.  There are those who care about you; they are trying to pull you out, but the currents are strong;  they are Officer Duncan, Miss J. and Claire . . . .

If you are Claire, you and Todd split the day serving up the Cafe's percolating javas, pastries and whatnots.  Todd has a crush on you;  if only you had met Todd before you met Dave.  He had been a dream, but now you realize he is a nightmare.  You feel trapped, his daily drip-drip of cruelty is draining your self respect, grinding you down.  And then, on one particularly bruising day, you unexpectedly get perked up by one of your regulars; his name is Craig . . . .

If you are Craig, your life is pretty humdrum.  You idle away the hours browsing the internet on your notebook computer and sipping coffee.  But then one day your session is hijacked by a programmer who makes the extraordinary claim that you are a virtual character living in a virtual cafe!  The programmer's avatar appears as a 11 year old girl named Elly . . . .

If you are Elly, you are supremely self-confident that you have created these characters, their scripts, and their location, but you are blissfully unaware of your own self-inconsistencies.  It never occurs to you, that you may be no more real than the other characters at the Cafe . . . .

Comment:  Unfortunately, there are two things that drag this movie down.  First, the character of Elly does not seem credible.  Second, it has an unsatisfying 'never mind' ending. ( Presto!  Everything is all right, after all!)

Picture (DVD): 4, may be slightly cropped.",1333152000,9,2209,4.453865336658354
4481616,3,B004V2S4V0,"It was slow going and weird. The only thing that saved it for me was ofcourse Jennifer Love Hewitt. This story line about us not really being on this planet??? I don't know It just isn't what I was expecting from Jennifer Love Hewitt.
I guess a more sweeter, softer storyline.",1327795200,,276,4.431372549019608
4481617,1,B004V2S4V0,"This was not an especially bad movie to watch, especially the first half or so.  The characters were a bit stiff and formulaic, but not painfully so.  The fatal problem with this movie lies in the premise itself, which you don't actually begin to see until halfway through the film, and don't fully discover until the very end.  There are by necessity some major spoilers in this review.

My primary objection to this movie is that the metaphor of software programmer/God is so thinly veiled that it may as well not exist at all.  A nerdy but kind-hearted computer guy at the cafe receives a message from a 13-year-old girl telling him that he is nothing more than an avatar in a program that she wrote, and that she exists outside of time and space and that she programmed him with free will, etc.  In other words, she is God.  Either the writer assumes we will see the metaphor right off but that somehow we will think it is clever, or he assumes that we are too thick to immediately see through the metaphor and thus he will be at liberty to preach theistic concepts to an unsuspecting audience.  In either scenario the writer fails, because in the first case it is not clever nor original, and in the second case it is so transparent that even a kindergartener would immediately see through it.

The metaphor further fails by dancing around the ""hard questions,"" which ironically would have been the only thing that might have saved the film had they actually been addressed well.  For instance, when the computer nerd asks the programmer/God why there is suffering programmed into the software, the answer is a stop-motion animation supplemented double-speak diatribe that makes no more sense to the computer nerd she is giving it to than it does to the audience.  It is clearly meant to sound ""too deep for you to understand"" but is in reality just nonsense.  This is further demonstrated later when the same person repeats the question and God/programmer tells him that she already answered his question but that he didn't understand her.  This opens the door to more inconsistencies; if she knew that he wouldn't understand (and we are told earlier that she knows everything he will think or do beforehand) then why did she bother giving him such a confusing answer anyway?  In fact, nothing that the programmer/God does in this movie makes any sense.  There is a scene where she turns the world into a music video when the radio plays her favorite music- a concept which would be meaningless to someone who exists outside of time/tempo as she claims.  These unexplained inconsistencies, I believe, are intended to make us think that we are not meant to understand her because she is so much more advanced, but in practical application it just makes for lazy writing which needs not be explained and allows for lots of loose ends and plot holes.

In the end the nerdy guy is carefully groomed into a position wherein he ""chooses"" to sacrifice himself in order to save someone else, but as he himself points out he wasn't really sacrificing anything since he didn't really exist anyway, so the ""sacrifice"" is hollow on its face, but this is made even more trite by the fact that when he chooses to sacrifice himself he finds to his surprise that he does not cease to exist but that the software is magically changed so that everyone around him is now happy; even the creepy drug-dealing murderer is all smiles and rainbows.  The folks who were tragically killed are now alive and joyous, and even the hot blonde in the red dress from his previous little fantasy (another programmed avatar borrowed from The Matrix, no doubt) is there and everything is happy in God's little computer simulation.  The ending is about as satisfying as it would be if one of the characters woke up and found that, ""it was all just a dream.""

There are a few side vignettes going along through the film, but they don't have much to do with the main plot and some don't even end up getting resolved, but in the end they are all reset along with everything else when the software is altered so none of it really mattered anyway.  It may as well never have happened, because none of the choices the characters enacted made any difference in the end.

I can safely predict that this movie is not destined to go down as one of the great films of cinema.  Unquestionably it will appeal to a certain mass of people, and no doubt there are many who will defend it as a ""feel-good"" film, but if you are bothered by intellectually shallow plots and emotionally manipulative tripe, then this film is not for you.",1327276800,14,4587,4.6288532675709

4481619,3,B004V2S4V0,"This is a dialogue dependent movie yet it was difficult to follow the plot-clarifying discussions about alternate realities because of at times fair audio quality, and at times not so clear enunciation. In particular, the pivotal explanations between two of our principal characters - the virtual world programmer with her minion. All this was made even more difficult by no subtitles. That aside, the movie starts out slowly indulgent like someone who's taken too many English writing courses, but in time enough thought provoking sub-stories emerge to make it in an engaging 90 minutes. It wasn't clear to me if the movie was written from the first person omniscient view because one of the characters is in the background observing and writing a narrative on everything that takes place in the cafe and yet another character claims to have created/programmed everyone in the cafe. Still another character has the free will to alter outcomes in the cafe irrespective of what the previous two have written. Conclusion: A creative storyline that ended up a bit more confusing than it needed to be.",1326758400,5,1097,5.066298342541437

4481634,3,B004V2S4V0,"In one lonely coffee shop, several characters, representing the worst and best in humanity, present their stories.  At best, humans remember that we are all made out of the same stuff and therefore are all fundamentally connected to each other.  The metaphor offered is that all sand creations are made from sand.  We struggle to remember this but as we do, we get to find love and peace.

Craig, a gentle and easy-going man meets Elly, a very bright 12 year old girl who is ""the programmer.""  He asks her why she built free will into the program to which she replies, ""When you can go either way, but you choose to do the right thing, there's nothing more gratifying to me than that.""

When Craig learns that his false self is a fabricated illusion, he decides that he is willing to sacrifice it so that he can live in connection to his real self.  His willingness alone creates love around him.

Another man in the cafe, a writer with a tattoo that reads, ""What a piece of work is man ...,"" observes the going ons in the cafe and seeks to find meaning in it all and to put it into narrative form.

There's some nice banter between a dating couple, making this film a light philosophical/spiritual romantic comedy.  The pace of the film is a little slower than most.",1439769600,,1267,4.445887445887446

4481656,3,B004V2S4V0,"Cafe capitalizes on the success of the coffee house as a social meeting place within the community. Coffee house regulars patron the cafe and do their regular things, but the twist is that their daily courses are already determined, or are they, and to what extent?

This movie dapples with the concept of God in a sci- fi sort of construct and examines themes such as goodwill vs. selfishness, and destiny vs. free will. Another component I found interesting was that answers were closer than you might expect. This movie is mellow drama and probably will not appeal to a large audience. I caught it on a premium channel.

There are two elements from Cafe that I keep thinking about. One is the visual of the dolls in birdcages that is part of the decor at the cafe. The other is the Firefly song that plays over and over consecutively during the credits. The lyrics describe the firefly as being in the hand, lights up, and takes flight. The music is akin to that of a music box which is opened and closed, controlled, at the will of its owner. People will read into this movie what they want and it does contend with the idea of a sovereign, which may not appeal to some, but I think there are other compelling concepts to consider as well and the alternate dimension gives a sci-fi flair.",1372550400,4,1292,4.493617021276596

4481676,4,B004V2S4V0,"Cafe is an independent film starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, with a lot of different things going on at the same time. There is a romance between Hewitt's character and the other employee at the coffee shop where she works, but she doesn't know about it yet. There is a seedy drug dealer who uses the coffee shop as his base of operations. A social worker is conducting interviews for a job helping kids in the bad part of town. A beautiful woman comes to the shop on a coffee date with a man she just met at the movies. A lonely man gets a message on his laptop from a 12 year old girl who tells him that he doesn't really exist, but that he is just an avatar. And a mysterious writer sits in the corner and makes notes concerning all that he observes. And all of these people's lives are intertwined in ways they haven't yet come to appreciate.

Cafe spends a bit of time asking some really big questions: Where did we come from? Why are we here? Why is there evil in the world? These questions have been asked for millenia, and many answers have been suggested by religion, philosophers, scientists, etc. Cafe also answers these questions, in modern terms which should appeal to viewers of the 21st century. I don't agree with all of the answers as given, but I still enjoyed the movie, and felt good after having watched it.

Christians especially will find something to like, as some of the answers can be interpreted to fit the Christian worldview. The film does have instances of implied violence (one character has a black eye from a beating, and a character is killed at one point), and implied drug use (customers of the dealer) but these are presented as negative things to be avoided, not as positive role models.

I thought the acting and production values were quite good in Cafe, everyone involved seemed to truly be the character they were trying to represent and good use was made of color, costume, and set design. This is actually the first time I've ever watched Jennifer Love Hewitt on screen, and she does a fine job, but no more so than the rest of the cast. I did like her character and could see why her co-worker would have been smitten. The overall atmosphere of the film was that of a light drama, which became uplifting at times. I actually watched it first on Netflix, and liked it well enough that I ordered it on DVD from Amazon the next day.",1358985600,9,2372,4.448275862068965

It's not completely congruent with my own personal religious beliefs but still a really good movie.  The film deals with life, love, death, & affairs in an intelligent way.  Really good acting & one of Hewitt's best movies.  I wish this film would have received more attention when it came out in 2010.  These kinds of films never receive enough attention.
