I was looking for some information for training the Welcome team that I am liaison, Because it had a DVD as well as coaching activities that could be done,  I was able to use the information as a part of our Welcome Team Handbook, for extra reading.

Thank you so much

8480342,5,B005NCM6W0,"HOSPITALITY: 9 Aspects of Over-the-Top Hospitality highlights the most noticeable aspect of a healthy or unhealthy church.  Pastors and staff can perform in the pulpit and live messy private lives for a season.  Music can be bad, but over-looked.  Bathrooms may be unkept, but it is the hospitality of a church that is felt before anything else.  If the hospitality is lacking or non-existent, this is a major problem which directly leads to lack of growth.  The Bible says to make friends you must first show yourself friendly.  Or in this case, in order to make people want to come back and invite others to your church, you must be genuinely friendly.  People--especially worldy people--can sniff inauthenticity from a mile away and you don't want your church to have that kind of a reputation.  Dick's series will help you to improve [or create] a successful hospitality ministry as well as a hospitable spirit in your church.",1322524800,,930,4.916666666666667
