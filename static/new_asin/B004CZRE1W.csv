8424288,5,B004CZRE1W,"""A Memory in My Heart"" is a well-made Lifetime drama that stars Jane Seymour as an amnesiac, Rebecca Vega who is currently happily married to  a kindhearted construction worker named Joe Vega (A Martinez). However, her inability to have children places stress on the marriage and then a chance encounter with a woman from her past convinces her that she actually has a family someplace else, and that her real name is Abbie Swenson Stewart. Rebecca/Abbie travels to her former city where she encounters hostility among the townsfolk and discovers that not only does she have 3 children, but that her estranged husband, Chase (Bruce Davison) is ruthless, influential, and determined to keep her away from her children.

The story moves along at an even pace and there's an element of suspense as Abbie tries to reach out to her children, while trying to reason things out with Chase. Bruce Davison plays a credible villain, a master manipulator and control freak who just can't bear to be crossed. Seymour is as usual beautiful and flawless in her performance as the anguished mom. This made for a diverting evening's entertainment and will appeal to those who enjoy a good drama.",1373673600,2,1179,4.919597989949748
8424289,5,B004CZRE1W,"I watched this movie a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. While watching it I was amazed that the house Jane Seymours character Rebecca Vega and her husband Joe lived in in San Pedro is the house my sister in law and her husband lived in long before the movie was made. I could not believe what I was looking at. LOL  It sits down at the end of a very narrow road (can't remember the name of the street) over looking what used to be Todd Shipyards. The first part of the movie and the ending show a lot of the house inside and out. I am going to purchase the dvd and let my sons watch it and see if they remember it. I'm sure they will.  The movie is well worth purchasing if you are a Jane Seymour fan.  She does a fine acting job in this, and it's a nice sweet story.",1366588800,5,775,3.9235668789808917

A lovely story that shows a woman's determination to re-connect with a family that she lost because of unfortunate circumstances.",1356998400,2,269,5.255813953488372
8424292,1,B004CZRE1W,"The story line here I'm sure was very good, however the DVD appeared to be a very bad bootleg copy.
I purchased it from Importcds.
I have never been as unhappy with a purchase from Amazon as I have been with this one.  I KNOW  Amazon will stand behind this purchase and make it good.
