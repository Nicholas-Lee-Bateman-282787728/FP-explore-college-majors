2787214,5,B000NVT0UC,"""Ali's Dozen"" highlights 12 significant rounds in the career of Muhammad Ali, from his Olympic Gold medal winning effort at the 1960 Olympics to his gutsy 15th round rally to win a close decision over Earnie Shavers in their 1977 battle at Madison Square Garden in New York.

But this 45 minute documentary also includes hours and hours of bonus features. It has the 1966 battle between Ali and Ernie Terrell in its entirety. It has all 15 rounds, the conversations between rounds, and post fight interviews. It is the closed circuit telecast, not one of those dark grainy highlight reel clips.

Moreover, you get Ali-Quarry I and Ali Williams in their entirety (courtesy of the aforementioned Jacobs and Cayton), plus highlights of Ali vs Zora Folley, his last fight before being exiled from boxing for 3 1/2 years.

You also get interviews with Angelo Dundee, Mort Sharnik, and Jerry Izenberg. A must have dvd for Ali fans!",1181088000,11,925,4.841772151898734

8182132,5,B000NVT0UC,"Good footage of Ali's fights. The Williams,Quarry Terrell fights are complete. The Folley fight has highlites. The main feature the 12 rounds are ok.",1395878400,,149,5.25
8182133,1,B000NVT0UC,"This DVD absolutely falls flat. A lot of lip service about Ali's greatness, and a few partial rounds that everyone has seen before. Then, okay, there is the bonus material, if you can find it on the disc. But the whole package just cannot be compared with ""Ali: The Whole Story,"" which is actually a great film, one of the best biographical films ever done for television. That one does the man justice. This one doesn't.",1348358400,2,421,4.552631578947368
8182134,5,B000NVT0UC,"For Ali fans, this is a must. Great fight summaries and tbe bonus fights with Cleveland Williams, Zora Foley, Terrell, and Quarry are worth the price of the CD.

One of the reviewers commented that some of the bonus material is missing. Its actually on but is easy to miss:  On selecting ""Bonus"" from the DVD Main Menu, you are brought to a window with ONLY two of the bonus fights and the option to click <MAIN>.  Turns out that the "">"" to the right of <MAIN> is equivalent to ""next"" and selecting it moves you to a new window where the other bonus fights are displayed (Terrell, Quarry). ""<"" on the left of <MAIN>, is equivalent to ""previous"" and moves you back.  Its certainly not evident that angle brackes around <MAIN> are not part of MAIN but are for navigation.

Beyond that the DVD is excellent.",1280188800,5,804,4.442176870748299
8182135,2,B000NVT0UC,"I bought this product new, sealed with both tape and shrink wrap.  However, two of the bonus features listed on the jacket simply do not exist on the DVD.  Specifically, the Ernie Terrell and Jerry Quarry fights are missing.  The Cleveland Williams and Henry Cooper matches are included as advertised.  Perhaps just my copy is defective?  But you're playing Russian roulette if you're counting on the extras.  The two bonus interviews are familiar stuff and not much longer than soundbites.  The footage of Earnie Shavers vs. Ali is good, but slight, perhaps thirty seconds of the final round.  Most of the other footage is very familiar to collectors of Muhammad Ali DVDs and VHS.  I recommend ""Muhammad Ali, The Whole Story"" for real fans and boxing buffs.",1185840000,10,758,4.905511811023622
