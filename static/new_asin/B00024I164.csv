2062518,5,B00024I164,"So that's what an Indian ACTRESS looks like...engaged in the moment and drawing you in with every breath. Impeccably acted  saga of a beautiful young girl who falls in love with her fathers student only to have him torn from her by....her caring loving father....huh...well he meant well. The husband he found for her is handsome, sweet , caring..damn near saintly ....the bastard....it's never easy in love. Parent, child, or lover ,someone is going to get hurt.

Welcome to  Bollywood. I couldn't even begin to describe in words the cinema scope and colors . The dances are fantastic. These are the best Bollywood dancing scenes  I've ever seen. If Farah Khan saw this she probably had a moment where she thought about going back to school. This is done in the MGM style . Beautiful sets and great use of local vistas . Ash must have some serious arthritis in her feet now adays because there is no way she got out of years of dancing so beautifully unscathed. I've been in Medical too long. This is done in letterbox format so hopefully you have a good size t.v.....Gotta go now I have a train to catch ...lol you'll see what I mean. Oh wow fireworks at the end ..awesome. Don't you dare skip this one . :)",1336003200,,1209,4.532110091743119
2062519,5,B00024I164,"In short, the best film I ever watched!

I agree with an excellent review of this wonderful film by Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""",1331078400,,126,4.7272727272727275
2062520,2,B00024I164,"Ok, first off... I have seen bits of this movie before and was finally sold when I saw the song ""Dholi Taro Dhol Baaje"" video on Youtube. So I ordered the DVD and when I sat down to watch the DVD... THE SUBTITLES WERE WAAAAAAY OFF. Lyrics from songs overlapped with the characters lines, the subtitles gave away the punch line before the characters said them or the dramatic music marked them... Its so sad, I've read others reviews about the DVD and everyone seems fine with their copy, did I get a defect? Well, maybe amazon can help me out with it...",1330128000,,553,4.378640776699029

2062523,5,B00024I164,"This movie is a wonderful film for anyone looking for a great way to spend an evening. I though about writing a story recap, but there are already so many on here. So, instead I will offer my opinion of the movie. The music was wonderful, as were the costumes, and the acting was amazing! Not to sounds too clich, but I laughed and cried through this movie, and truly enjoyed myself. What this movie has to say about love is not the typical com rom message. Instead it offers a magical story full of twists, heartbreaking moments, laughs, and an ending that will leave you wanting to watch it again and again. I started to watch this movie to pass the time one saturday afternoon and by the end of it all of my roommates had crammed onto the couch completely engrossed in the story, and wanted to watch it again at the end. The movie is clean and appropriate for teenagers and up, and has an important message for everyone about true love. I highly recommend it.",1288569600,,962,4.379888268156424

2062526,5,B00024I164,"I've had this movie on my shelf for a long time, and thought about giving it away because it seemed really... well... stupid. So, last night I was alone at home with nothing to do but give the movie another chance. It took me until maybe fifteen minutes to get into the movie with the first musical number, but after that I was hypnotized. It is a really strange movie and there are scenes I merely lift my eyebrow to. Something unique I have observed with Bollywood films is that they go either way in quality, but they never try too hard to impress an audience with facts and other trivial aspects. Their purpose is to serve the audience by entertaining with a classic storyline warmed by great performances, lavish colors and scenery, and catchy music/dances.

It wasn't until I finished this rather long movie sometime around two in the morning did I fully understand the worth of the story. It can easily be divided into two halves. The first accounts for the fun, flirtatious love between Sameer and Nandini. Not only do they have great chemistry, but I laughed a lot at their playful interactions. It is really sad when they are separated; however, this marks the next chapter of Nandini's complicated life. She is arranged to marry a man who is quiet, reserved, a relatively unsuccessful lawyer, but has a heart of gold and is dedicated to taking care of his beloved wife.

The first period of her marriage is marked by depression and longing for Sameer. She receives letters from her love that her husband, Ajray (sp?) reads accidentally. Hurt by her dishonesty, he does not wish to pursue a relationship with someone who doesn't return his love, and so he decides to travel to Italy with Nandini to help her find Sameer. A lot of things happen while they are there, and Nandini decides to give Ajray a chance by getting to know his true person. She comes to respect him, and comes to understand the meaning of love through his selfless actions. The concept of her deciding to stay with her husband is somewhat ridiculous in retrospect to the entire film, but it makes a lot of sense when it finally happens because Sameer and Nandini grow apart with the distance and difference in cultural background. To me, their relationship was genuine and sweet but they fought over petty things and handled their emotions like any inexperienced person would: obsessively.

However, Nandini's relationship with Ajray is mature, deep, and abiding. So, the story to me wasn't about two lovers trying to reconnect. It's a story about a person who comes to understand the meaning of love through her experiences.",1242518400,6,2606,4.73568281938326
2062527,5,B00024I164,I absolutely love this movie and would recommend it to everyone. Yes some parts are a little cheesy but the story as a whole is beautiful and compelling. I really like how the first half of the movie shows this bright sunny girl and the second half she is the complete opposite thus proving her versatility as an actress. I also love the music and dance sequences performed by Aishwarya Rai that leave you mesmerized.,1241395200,2,417,4.573333333333333
2062528,5,B00024I164,"This sparkling romance was my first introduction to the magic and
art of the Bollywood movie!  Since seeing it just a week ago, I have
watched 3 more -- leading to another introduction to the charismatic
actor Shah Rukh Khan, (whom I loved in ""Devdas"").  ""Straight from the
Heart"" aka ""Hum Dil de Chuke Sanam"" is a wonderful, romantic story
of young love (infatuation) vs. mature, lasting, true love.
THe song and dance numbers, particularly ""Nimbooda"", are all brilliant
displays of beauty, dance and sometimes, seduction.
All I can say is that once you have been thoughtfully introduced to the
art of the Bollywood movie, you will find yourself falling in love!",1235088000,,663,4.910714285714286
2062529,5,B00024I164,I'm new to BollyWood movies I first say a video from the movie then I finnaly got to watch the whole movie. It was great. I love this movie. It is on the long side at just over 3 hours. But it is worth it. I actually sheded a tear at the ending. No wonder it won 7 awards.,1216425600,,272,3.6271186440677967
2062530,4,B00024I164,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out in 1999.  This is a typical ""bigger than life"" movie that places more emphasis on color and music than plot and acting.  (I don't like Salman Khan - the jilted lover.)  I enjoyed watching it because of the dances and scenery.  I'm not going to bore you with plot details... there are several (hundred) places to find that!

People who are angry or annoyed with ""Italian"" scenes taking place in Budapest should remember one thing.  Movie goers in rural India don't really know where the foreign places being shown are. They are there to watch a fun movie, and possibly, ogle Ash.  They don't care where the places are!  Remember how most of you thought that henna markings on our bodies were permanent tattoos, and wearing bindis on your foreheads was only decoration...  If you didn't know the stories behind simple things like this then don't expect villagers to know, or even care, that the scenes taking place in a movie are misleading.  (Make no mistake, I'm not trying to put down the people of India.  If I could remember right now, I'd mention American movies that mislead, too...)

Also, what's wrong with a song about flying kites or lemons?  There are kite flying festivals around the world - I've even seen ones taking place in America.  We also have many food-related songs - Mashed Potatoes; Tootsie roll; Crawfish....

I enjoyed the movie immensely when it initially came out.  For someone looking for a Titanic proportioned movie, this has some real colorful scenes in it.  Don't take it too seriously, though.  It's not meant to be an art film but a mainstream entertainer.

One more thing I don't believe has been mentioned in the other reviews.  The name of the movie in Hindi is ""Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.""  ""Hum"" means I or Me; ""Dil"" means Heart; ""De Chuke"" means Have Given; ""Sanam"" means Love... Putting it all together does not mean ""Straight from the Heart"".  The title is ""I Have Given My Heart, [My} Love.""  It bothers me when things are mis-translated because so much of the original meaning is lost.

Hope this helps anyone wanting to watch this movie!",1209945600,3,2134,4.659517426273458
2062531,5,B00024I164,Great movie with really nice music and dance.  Scenes are beauitful and costumes are stunning.  Who ever thought passing wind was universally Funny.,1205884800,3,148,5.391304347826087
2062532,4,B00024I164,"If you like Aishwarya Rai because you already saw ""Bride and Prejudice"" and ""The Mistress of Spices"", then check out some of her famous Bollywood films directly from India.

""Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam"" (Straight From the Heart) is a very beautiful Hindi film which touches on a very common theme about the warped ""arranged marriage concept"" and the misery it causes when two people fall in love.  Perhaps from different castes (different classes, i.e. rich or poor),  or already arranged marriages between two people set by wealthy parents who have it set as planned for their children to wed when they become of age. India is one country that still practices this procedure of having people marry for the sake of continued family esteem instead of the possibility that two people could actually love each other.  Love is actually a secondary concern in marriage.  The poor girl has no say in her fate as to who will be her husband.

So, Bollywood films have many stories based on that scenario where two people fall in love with each other, however, that are already schedule to marry someone they may not have even met.  The poor girl may not even like the jerk that she has to marry, but her parents are only concerned about their newly refined family esteem brought on by the marriage.  As long as Indian girls choose to maintain their faith in their warped religion, then I guess they deserve to be the down-troddened victim of it.

Anyway, ""Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam"" stars the world famous Aishwarya Rai, and Salmon Khan, and Ajay Devgan.  All three are very famous established actors in Bollywood.  This movie is the 1999 Winner of 7 Filmfare Awards and 10 Screen Awards including Best Film, Best Director, Best Music, Best Actress, and Best Cinematography.

If you'd like to see more films with Aishwarya Rai, from Bollywood's best, also check out ""Mohabbatein"" with Sharukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan (Aishwarya Rai's new father -in-law) and many various beautiful actresses,  ""Devdas"" with Shahrukh Khan and Madhuri Dixit, and ""Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke"" with Abhishek Bachchan (Aishwarya Rai's new husband), and Sonali Bendre.

2062533,1,B00024I164,"I have a shelf full of Hindi romances, and this is the only one I could not sit through to the end. The acting is wooden, the music is mediocre and the plot is the worst masala of melodramatic plot twists I have ever seen. Everything is just stiff and unimaginative, in every aspect.

I've seen Ash act well in other films, so let's blame the director for this mess. (I've never seen Salman in anything I liked, so we'll blame him for that.)

There are so many other great Hindi romance films to choose from, I wouldn't avise wasting your time or money on this one.",1191888000,2,565,4.271028037383178
2062534,5,B00024I164,"I loved watching this film. It is a little long, but the beautiful scenery and wonerful music make the time fly by. The acting and performances are superior and Ajay Devgan is awesome in this role. Aishwarya is picture perfect in this film and the reference to ""Miss World"" was very funny. The costuming and music video cut-aways were great as well.",1190073600,,349,4.645161290322581
2062535,1,B00024I164,"This movie is too long, makes little sense (songs are about flying a kite and a lemon) and must be intended for young children. The music is OK, very Indian, and I see lip sync problems.
The plot is typical, and the sets elaborate. I hope nobody believes this is really India. It is overdone with choreography too obvious. This movie is boring.",1186012800,,344,4.476190476190476
2062536,5,B00024I164,"First off I love bollywood films and Aish is one of my favorite actresses in bollywood. Some might think she is a bit over the top in her acting but I think she captures the viewer with her beauty and her amazing talent to draw the viewer into her characters. Hume Dil de Chuke Sanam is one of my favorite films by her and when I first seen it I thought I was going to be so disappointed in the movie because of how silly it was with it basic comedy trying to hard to get a laugh. I was glad I wanted the whole thing and seen the point that the film was making but having a beginning that was so childish filled with puppy love but towards the end when Nandani understood what love was as an adult was wonderful. I feel in love with the soundtrack and Tdap Tdap still grabs my heart when I hear it. Wonderful film and it doesn't make alot of people think but as an adult I understand the logic when we say ""thats just puppy love"" and when you young you do not understand it until you experience it yourself.",1180656000,,1007,4.065326633165829
2062537,5,B00024I164,"Wonderful movie. The cinematography is fantastic. Great acting by Aishwarya and Ajay Devgan, the epic music soundtrack adds to the film quality and heightens the emotional effect of the movie, and the directing is superb. You get to see two different sides of Aishwarya. She's fun, joyful and such a kid in the first half. In the second half, she's very reserved and sophisticated. Ajay is a wonderful actor in this film as well. And Salman Khan just plays an all around goofy character.  There are many, many memorable scenes. The second half after intermissions is the most memorable part of the movie for me. It's powerful and gripping and I loved every scene thereafter.  The title song, ""Dil De Chuke Sanaam"" is the best and has a lot of soul behind it. I truly recommend this movie.  Another movie I recommend by Aishwarya is Kuch Naa Kaho. And for Ajay Devgan, I recommend Yuva and Company. He does a fabulous job in both movies.",1179532800,,936,4.66060606060606

2062540,3,B00024I164,"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam has some charming moments and occasionally stirring performances by Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgan, but I found it disappointing overall.  Maybe my expectations were too high, given all the critical fanfare.  Maybe my perspective was tainted by having watched Devdas (by the same director) the night before.  Now THERE is a sublimely gripping tear-jerker!  Anyhow, I never quite bought into the Sameer-Nandini love story in this film.  Not nearly as fake as its ersatz Italy, but unconvincing nonetheless.",1167523200,,527,5.301204819277109

I wasn't particularly fond of the male romantic lead -- he was lacking something.  The husband had more appeal.",1154995200,,364,4.73015873015873
2062545,1,B00024I164,"Bollywood is known for it's cheesy plots and long films that with story lines that can be summarized in about 2.5 minutes.  But usually they offer a lot of fun, some good music, and some amusing moments.  Often they even take cheap shots at the heart strings.  That is why I keep coming back to Bollywood.  But this movie was pure drivel that I wouldn't wish on anyone with half of a brain.

The movie's largest fault is it's star, Samir Khan.  Once again, he rolls through a role flexing his abs, being fawned over by giggling females (why?), and being doe-eyed and lovey,caring, sensitive guy, none of which is convincing at all.  Especially in light of his arrest and imprisonment for being a Bollywood bad boy (if you don't know about his conviction, do an on-line search).  I hope that doing time humbles this arrogant sot to be a little more gracious.

Then the movie is just offensive by insulting the intelligence of the viewer.  For instance, Khan's character, when all seems lost in his relationship with Rai's character, returns to ""Italy"" where he was raised.  There are several shots of the lovely Italian city (unnamed) where he lives with his mum, but many people would recognize BUDAPEST, HUNGARY! (Why wasn't the movie set in Hungary if they wanted to film there?)  Hungarian language is spoken and written all over the film and Khan fakes the is speaking the local language by making annoying buzzing and chirping sounds that sound more like a coffee pot on the fritz than either Italian or Magyar.

Oh, the movie also features childish, scatological humor with Rai and a bevy of females giggling when they hear Khan's character pass gas when he thinks he's alone.  Is this third grade?

Rai is elegant as always in her part and has one good dance sequence, but I'm not convinced that she was into this film.  She seems a bit bored throughout. And her gorgeous glances can't save this film from all it's faults.

This movie was terrible!  Truly terrible!",1152576000,5,1972,4.683139534883721
2062546,5,B00024I164,"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (Straight From the Heart) is a beautiful movie that draws you into a world of lush romance and bittersweet endings. I guess I'm a sucker for romance after all.  There are several scenes in this film that will flat out make women cry and the menfolk surreptitiously reach for a hanky or a dirty sleeve. Watching this film was truly a heady, eye-opening experience.

Skip this paragraph unless you're into being SPOILED. The plot revolves around the daughter of a classical singer named Nandini (the gorgeous Aishwarya Rai).  She falls for her father's carefree half-Italian student, Sameer (Salman Khan).  Vanraj (Ajay Devgan), son of a famous lawyer and a lawyer himself, sees and falls in love with Nandini and sends his proposal to Nandini's father, which is accepted. Nandini's father learns of her and Sameer's romance and demands that Sameer forget Nandini.  Vanraj marries Nandini and it's not until later in the marriage that he finds out that she still loves Sameer.  Vanraj, out of love for his wife, takes Nandini to Italy to reunite her with her Sameer.

Just now, having read what I'd written in the previous paragraph, I tell you my words fail to do justice to the actual movie. The plot description above is flat and cold and abrupt compared to the rich tapestry that make up the narrative.  It has so much heart and genuine emotions that, watching it, you feel you're breathing or soaking in every moment directly into your soul.  Very dramatic, I know, but, hey, it's how I feel.

That the movie is 3 hours long shouldn't detract anyone from watching it. Go ahead, it won't seem that long.  The song numbers are across-the-board great. My two personal favorites are ""Nimbooda"" (the sour lime) wherein Vanraj falls in love with Nandini and the title song, ""Hum Dil De Chuke"", a lovely, forlorn love ballad.  By the way, yes, the scenes in Italy were actually shot in Hungary and no one's really fooling anyone here but I beg you, don't let that be a deterrent.

The acting performances are superb, as they would have to be to elicit this kind of response from them viewers.  The three leads are very good. This is where Aishwarya Rai first flexed her acting muscles, as she goes thru a whole gamut of emotions, from the innocence and blithe happiness of a child to the mature, more subtle nuances that come with her acceptance of adulthood. She is, as ever, as luminous as the stars in the sky. This is my first sighting of Ajay Devgan and I'm sold on him as an actor. He may just make you cry.  Salman Khan is convincing as the free-spirited Sameer and you could see how a young girl could easily fall for this charming fella. He does a good job at the end of the movie when...well, I won't say.

Here in the states, where the emphasis is on box office instead of artistry, 90% of the films are shallow, crass and formulaic. I am rarely exposed to movies such as this, that resonates and transports you to an exotic, seemingly more meaningful place and draws out deeper, richer emotions than those elicited from viewing a buddy cop movie.  This movie achingly throbs with images and concepts of duty, self-sacrifice, quiet faithfulness, and the meaning of true love. Dear viewer, watch this movie, you may get swept away. You can thank me later.  Now, I'm back to watching Sportscenter because, while I am a sensitive guy, I do have an image to uphold.",1142640000,19,3391,4.632721202003339

The plot is good, although the beginning is highly unbelievable, you have got to suspend reality for a Bollywood film to be enjoyable.",1140739200,4,444,4.815789473684211
2062548,5,B00024I164,"This is yet another great example of when Bollywood films have the power to penetrate our hearts, open our minds and linger in our souls. Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (Straight From the Heart--English translation) features beautiful, colorful and luscious cinematography, attractive and well-cast leading actors, melodious and soulful music, energetic dance numbers and a great combination of humor, high drama and romance.

Nandini (Aishwarya Rai) is the beautiful daughter of the singer, Pandit Darbar (Vikram Gokhale), who takes on a music pupil in Sameer (Salman Khan), a half-Italian/half-Indian young man who travels all the way from Italy to learn singing. Nandini falls in love with him, straight away. The conflict is that Vanraj (Ajay Devgan), a young lawyer, has sent a proposal to Pandit, requesting his daughter's hand in marriage. Once the two lovers are caught together, Pandit demands that Sameer leave and forget his daughter. The selfless and faithful Vanraj comes to know his wife, Nandini's love for Sameer, and promptly decides to reunite the two in Italy, even though he is very much in love with her.

This is a beautiful story about coming to learn the importance of respect and faith in a relationship, and how even the biggest tests can actually bring people together, overtime. Nandini must decide whether to follow her heart or her soul, when she is torn between the undying love of her husband or her love for Sam.

Great movie! Don't miss it. The three plus hours will fly by as you grow increasingly more engrossed in this romantic, intriguing and beautifully made film. I also reccomend I Have Found It, also starring Aishwarya Rai.",1135036800,13,1658,5.043795620437956
2062549,5,B00024I164,"My discovery of Indian cinema has been almost a spiritual experience.  It's like going from black and white to color for the first time.  Compared to a movie like this, American and European films have no heart, no vitality, no color, and no passion.  And I've never seen any love story that could compare to the one in this film.  I've never seen the true definition of love expressed as deeply as it is here - and it is love in its purest form.  I know I'm old-fashioned, but, for me, Hollywood ruins every good love story it manages to produce by making everything about sex.  You don't have that in India cinema - you don't even have kissing; what you do have, though, are the depths and power of love expressed in ways Hollywood can't even comprehend.

Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (Straight From the Heart) has everything you could want in a movie - romance; comedy; fantastic music, singing, and dancing; elaborate set designs and magnificent locations; stellar performances; and, of course, the most beautiful woman in the world, Aishwarya Rai.  I'm trying to get my hands on all of her movies as quickly as I can.  She's incredible in this 1999 classic, as are the two leading men who form the other two sides of the most poignant of love triangles.  Salman Khan plays Sameer, a free spirit who comes to India from Italy to study music under Nandini's father.  Nandini (Rai) isn't happy about this at all, but she and Sameer are soon engaged in some serious flirting.  A strong love grows up between the two, only to be torn asunder by Nandini's father, who sends Sameer away with a promise to never meet his daughter again.  A heartbroken Nandini is compelled to marry a young lawyer named Vanraj (Ajay Devgan).  She doesn't love Vanraj, but he is an exceedingly good man who loves her dearly.  For all her continued grieving over Sameer, it is Vanraj who eventually shows her what true love really is.  The ending is just exquisite, a true emotional climax that brings both pain and joy to your heart at the same time.

The movie runs a little over three hours (which is pretty much the norm in India), but it is in no way too long.  If you have a heart, it will be swept away during the second half of the film.  The story and the passionate performances by Rai, Khan, and Devgan would be more than enough on their own to make this a stellar film - but Indian cinema gives you so much more than that.  Music plays an integral part in the film, and every single musical scene is amazing (and, besides chapters, you can also jump directly to any musical number on the DVD).  The one performance that really stands out, for me, is Nimbooda, which features Rai in a beguiling song and dance routine.  Subtitles are always an issue with a foreign language film, but the English subtitles here are really rather good and certainly allow you to follow the film closely.

I'm having a hard time trying to convey the sheer magic of this incredible film.  The love story puts Hollywood romances to shame, the performances are heart-felt and virtually guaranteed to make you laugh and cry, the cinematography is extraordinarily vivid, and I just can't get over how powerfully the film conveys the essence of true love.  And even if you took all of that away, the mere opportunity to watch Aishwarya Rai for over three hours makes the DVD well worth the price.  She is as talented as she is gorgeous.",1129852800,107,3394,4.532019704433497
2062550,5,B00024I164,"Yes. Simply Outstanding. This is truly one of the best Bollywood movies to come out in a long, long time. A great commercial hit back in our India, it also swept all the major awards. Though I'm from India where Bollywood movies are compulsory watching, I dislike them for their absurdity but this film has me raving about it. Its simply fabulous.

  Set in western India in a prosperous Gujarti household overflowing with people, lives Nandini, our heroine (the beautiful Ashwariya Rai), daughter of a renowned singer Pandit Durbar. Sameer (Salman Khan), a handsome young Italian who comes to learn classical music from the Pandit falls in love with his daughter. As the movie enfolds, we watch the beautifully enacted comedy of the star crossed lovers. But once the father comes to know, all hell breaks loose. Sameer is thrown out of the house, Nandini's heart is broken and she is married of to a young, respectable and well mannered suitor Vanraj (Ajay Devgan) who truly loves her but is detested by Nandini. But the husband also discovers about the affair, is heartbroken too, but decides to take Nandini to Italy to meet her lover.

  As the plot moves to Italy (Hungary actually, which the director would have us believe as Italy), we are engaged in Nandini's and Vanraj's troubles of living in a foreign country, finding Sameer and living with each other. As she searches for her love, Nandini comes to know her husband and how much he truly loves her and realizes his grief and sense of loss in losing her. When she finally does find Sameer, she's torn between the two and must choose one of the them and break the heart of the other.

  This is Bollywood at its best. Here the wonderful music that goes with this film, it underlines each scene with its sparkling melody. Also the set pieces are lavishly mounted and the music numbers burst upon the sceen. The movie is also very beautifully shot.

  This movie also captures Ashwariya rai at her best. She is miraculously beautiful and lights up the screen whenever she's on it. All in all a must watch Bollywood affair. Iwould also recommend the same directorr's (Sanjay Leela Bhansali) Black, which is the story of a dumb, deaf and blind girl.",1128902400,9,2206,4.716145833333333
2062551,2,B00024I164,"The movie is typical Bollywood fare.  It is enjoyable, but nothing special.

My only complaint is that you cannot play the movie in the English version--even though it is a choice offered in the setup.  However, the English subtitles do work so English speakers can understand the movie.

(Of course, the songs are not in English or with English subtitles--as I expected.  No disappointment there.  Songs don't translate very well).",1127260800,3,432,5.1
2062552,4,B00024I164,"First off, don't expect a whole lot of logic in parts of this film. There is a phrase an ""anglo"" pal of mine and I--I'm Latina--have for this: Bollyworld. When you watch a Bollywood musical, you often have to suspend disbelief and accept that it might have much whimsy and disjointed editing and a certain odd logic. Just accept it and enjoy. It's something like suspending disbelief for a fantasy flick.

Anyway, this is a schizophrenic movie. It starts off and you think it's gonna be quite comedic and light. But then it moves into heavy drama. It's a romantic triangle (as you'll know from the other reviews). Girl loves young, cute, hip, energetic fella who shares her gift for music. Boy loves beautiful, graceful, talented girl who sings like an angel. Ah, but this is not America. This is India, and the girl must marry the man her family chooses. And the guy her family chooses--who is captivated by the lovely, lively, singing, dancing vision he first views--is an honorable but staid guy who couldn't sing to save his life.

So, now we're done with the light bits (and the sprightlier musical numbers), and we move into the quest. Here, you have the heroine's journey from girl to woman. And when she makes the decision at the end, it's a woman's decison--thought out, sober, deep, strong. It's not the fancy of a light heart, but the choice of a heart that's grown. It's a beautiful finale, really, trust me. Beautiful.

I live in a neighborhood with several Indian ""bazaars"" and folks from that country. This was my second Bollywood flick. I discussed it with the proprietress of a local Indian goods shop, and told her how delighted I was that I could expect certain things in a Bollywood movie: respect for parents, sacrifice for family, the value of marital fidelity and that I didn't have to worry about a bunch of sweaty nekkid folks ""hooking up"". Here, a kiss MEANS a lot because that may be all you get (if that much). It's refreshing, that kind of modesty these days. Then I mentioned how I loved the ending. She said, ""This is an Indian film. It HAD to end that way.""

I had to smile at that certainty.

I recommend this movie if you're patient and enjoy 1. Beautiful clothes (does anyone make outfits as gorgeous as the people of India?) 2. Gorgeous Aishwarya Rai, probably the loveliest woman in current global cinema 3. Some really fun and ""up"" musical numbers 4. the depiction of true self-sacrificial love and 5. a  romantically satisfying ending.

Just be aware that Bollywood flicks do tend to suffer from lack of judicious editing. It's LONG.  Hungary is a strange, strange place to pass off as Italy.

Still, I recommend this. Lovely film. Enjoy!

There was a lot of emotion in it - and something I'm really enjoying about the Indian movies is that they don't seem to feel the need to sell sex to sell a good story. Not so much as an on screen kiss, but you feel more emotion and heartbreak from these characters than you do from most any Hollywood movie. Definitely a great movie!!

8022136,5,B00024I164,"Nandini is the daughter of a renown singer, Pandit, who takes Sameer to be a pupil.  Nandini and Sameer secretly fall in love.  As her family doesn't know, they betroth her to another man, Vanraj.  When Pandit learns of the love between his daughter and student, he sends Sameer away and Nandini is married to Vanraj.  Vanraj learns of her love for Sameer, and, as is inevitable with a love triangle, heartbreak happens.

Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam begins as a romantic-comedy, light-hearted and fun, with a sweetly developing romance.  About half way through, it turns into a drama that, quite frankly, had me ugly-crying by the end.  While a love triangle is not a new plot, this one was well written and deep.

Aishwayra Rai is a terrific actress and acted her part magnificently.  Both Salman Kahn and Ajay Devgan were excellent as well, each one giving depth to his character.  The music and choreography was memorable, and the cinematography breath-taking.

This is a superb, emotional romance that is all around spectacular.  I highly recommend it.

8022145,5,B00024I164,"I'm reviewing the DVD.

This film has been my best friend even since I was 10. I came across crap DVDs and thought its over and I let it go...

Then I read about this world class DVD, I ordered it.

Its definitely the best DVD I've seen in my life.

I'm more of a technical guy rather than a film buff so I find it really important to be aware of the technical specs beforehand.

You have a wonderfully animated menu here to access your favorite songs and scenes.

The video is meant to be widescreen but has been encoded to fit 4:3 screens. But it looks too squished (horizontally) in a 4:3 screen. The best it looks in a 16:9 screen with vertical squishing .

The image is extremely sharp with excellent colors and details. The film has crystal clear images with no artifacts and combing.

A colorful film like this needed excellent treatment unlike the other releases by Eros & Shemaroo which was s***e.

The audio too is marvelous and exciting. Strong 5.1 with a great amount of bass effects and surround effects. The traditional numbers like 'Nimbooda' & 'Doli Taro' sound heightened with the dynamics. Other western soundtracks sound the best and wouldn't even remind you of a 1999 Bollywood film. Just as good as new!

The upsetting part is that there are no extras which would tell us the making of the film with a garnish of its promotional trailers which you never saw abroad. And the theatrical trailer too could've been added. But it's fine every feature adds value and all is worth it.

Another upsetting news is that the subtitles are not in proper synch. They normally tend to lag behind the dialogs.

I simply recommend it as it is one of the best treatments of the film and each and every dollar you spend is all worth it.",1389225600,2,1739,4.468354430379747
