8195689,1,B000QCUZKW,It was like a bad self indulgent movie of a person riding on the coat tails of Quentin crisp. A total waste of money and for Quentin fans avoid this like the plague.,1473638400,,165,4.03030303030303
8195690,1,B000QCUZKW,"I agree with another reviewer that this is one of the most amateurish productions I have ever seen. If I could give this movie half a star I would. If I was a teacher my grade would be D, and I would write non satis on the paper for a 20 percent score. There was not enough video of Quentin Crisp. The movie was so bad that I had to fast forward through several scenes to get to the end. If Amazon.com comes up with it I would suggest the movie documentary by the BBC from Great Britain called The Naked Civil Servant.",1373932800,,518,4.038834951456311
8195691,1,B000QCUZKW,"I reviewed this once already. It was awful. 'Nuff said. I don't know where my original review went, but seriously, do not waste your money. I thought it was a terribly deceptive bit of marketing, using Quentin Crisp's life story as a front for a rather tedious documentary about a play few if any will ever see.

This is NOT about Quentin Crisp.",1247702400,3,345,4.476190476190476
8195692,1,B000QCUZKW,"Terrible. This create-a-quentin-crisp-musical business bored me half to death. I was under the impression this was going to be a documentary about Quentin Crisp. Not the case at all. It is about David Leddick. Leddick might be interesting in his own right, but he's no Quentin Crisp. He does Crisp no great honor, either, in this ... documentary.

On camera, Leddick talks about what it means to act in a show, meditation, and other seriously irrelevant things.  He practices singing, runs through exercises, and rehearse his dance moves. The meditation sequence was almost...disturbing.

And yes, I think Leddick is shamelessly capitalizing on what might have been Crisp's occasional indulgence. He says as much at one point. I don't think he was a ""friend"" of Crisp's, regardless of how many times he says in the video that he knew Crisp for 20 years.

Seriously, good for Leddick for taking on such an ambitious project. Shame on Leddick, however, for exploiting what he says was a friendship, and for using Crisp's name to promote this positively awful video.",1236384000,,1063,5.0227272727272725
8195693,1,B000QCUZKW,"""Becoming Quentin"" is not at all what I thought it was going to be. It's a documentary style falterah all about David Leddick's labor pains of staging a musical play about Quentin Crisp. Much of the filming is borderline home-movie style with very poor editing choices as to what was included and what was excluded. There are all kinds of scenes that rarely or barely relate to birthing a stage production. We see him getting made-up, excercising, lifting weights, meditating, eating, flirting, and many non-related activities.
There are some very short clips of Quentin Crisp at his best, and some limited conversation by Leddick about Crisp. A few seconds here and there of songs from the actual show. But most of this DVD is devoted to the ramblings of Leddick and his preparing himself for the production. Not a lot of the production is actually seen. This is a drastic disappointment.
I give it three thumbs down. I had to give it one star for this review to be published. Otherwise it would have none.",1221609600,10,1007,4.76
8195694,1,B000QCUZKW,"What an idiot I was buying this film. I guess if you're a fan of this ""Celeb"" and not Quentin Crisp, you may enjoy it. I was looking for more on Crisp, not this no talent actor.",1211587200,6,177,3.810810810810811
