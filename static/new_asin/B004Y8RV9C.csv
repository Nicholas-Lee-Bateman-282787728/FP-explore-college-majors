4498641,4,B004Y8RV9C,"I've been waiting for a video like this for a long time.  I have about a dozen Yellowstone videos of varying quality, but even the best are for the most part limited to scenery along the Grand Loop, with perhaps a few aerial shots of the canyon.  ""Above Yellowstone"" definitely goes beyond the roadside attractions, with beautiful video of both main sights and the backcountry.

Unfortunately, the segments are not well-organized, jumping from one area of the park to another.  I've been to Yellowstone a number of times and yet it was not always easy to follow the progression.  My disappointment was not with the quality of the video, or even the amount of coverage (although I'd  have loved for it to be twice as long!), just with the fact that the segments were not arranged geographically, which would have seemed to be a logical and straightforward thing to do.

There was also a montage (perhaps five minutes?) at the beginning which seemed to be compiled from random clips of footage - again, beautiful but difficult to follow.  Unlike most of the video, this montage was not captioned or narrated, and therefore difficult to identify.

Definitely worth having, but doesn't quite live up to its potential.",1326758400,5,1213,4.849514563106796
4498642,5,B004Y8RV9C,"The photography is glorious, and occasionally I feel as though I'm in the helicopter riding along the river or down the mountain.  I enjoy the narration, as well as the history.  My only wish is that it were longer.  Surely there's more of Yellowstone to see, especially from helicopter.",1320796800,,287,4.816326530612245
4498643,5,B004Y8RV9C,Wonderful DVD with shots from the air that one cannot see driving through the park. We thoroughly enjoyed watching this after we had spent 4 days in the park.,1320364800,,158,4.482758620689655
4498644,5,B004Y8RV9C,This video was taken from the air space above Yellowstone National Park and provides some great views.  This video shows areas of the park from a different perspective that one would not see from the ground level.  The video was very interesting and informative.,1319932800,,262,4.931818181818182
4498645,5,B004Y8RV9C,"Above Yellowstone

This video gives not only an arial view of the Yellowstone we know- it also visits less celebrated parts of the region of the park, especially areas with limited access.  It's a good companion to the standard Yellowstone tourism video.  Worth the purchase, especially for the enthusiast.",1313712000,2,306,5.204081632653061

8447993,4,B004Y8RV9C,"I got this for my wife's birthday, because she is a Yellowstone FANATIC.  And it is awesome to see the park from the air, but something is missing.  While it has quite a few geyser basins that they show eruptions from the air, which is a very unique perspective to see the park from, there isn't any footage of the Norris Geyser Basin:  My wife's absolute favorite of all the geyser basins.  So that was sad to see the end of the video and no Steamboat Geyser or Porkchop or any of the other geysers, but I'm not going to knock it too hard, because if it DID have a segment on the Norris Geyser Basin, this movie, of all the videos on Yellowstone would be a very strong 5 star movie.  So if you don't need that portion of Yellowstone to be represented in order to garner your approval, then this is most certainly a 5 star movie for youSo long as you like Yellowstone, that is.",1394150400,,877,4.196428571428571
8447994,4,B004Y8RV9C,I wished we could have seen more of the back courntry; this format lends itself so well to that application,1393200000,,107,4.4
8447995,5,B004Y8RV9C,"I saw this film on Oregon Public Broadcasting on June 18, 2013.  WOW!!!  What fantastic footage!  The narrative is well done and VERY interesting.  I think that it would be good for the whole family to see and definitely a DVD to keep in your library.  There are so many beautiful places on this planet and this is one of them.

Wish I could go visit this park.  Hope to before it is buried under molten lava (wouldn't want to live near there).  Anyway, great film to see and well worth your time.",1371513600,,497,4.268817204301075
8447996,4,B004Y8RV9C,"I went to Yellowstone this year but only had a day and a half to drive in it. So to see this video of more of the park was a joy.
It added so much to what I had already seen and makes me want to go back. You also see things you would never see from the ground and they tell you what they are as you watch it. So enjoy and relax and plan your next trip.",1355616000,,352,3.4683544303797467
8447997,4,B004Y8RV9C,"Nice little documentary of the Park. I was there when this was shot , so it has special meaning for me. It does leave you wanting more though. Beautiful aerial views!",1353542400,,166,4.387096774193548
8447998,2,B004Y8RV9C,"I was really hoping I might catch a glimpse of a certain top-secret geyser basin in this video. If you are hoping for a peek at FGB, look somewhere else. If you are hoping to scout some awesome backcountry adventure terrain for your next big expedition, look somewhere else. This DVD features the front country, mostly stuff you can see from your car, just from above. On the other hand, if you just want a relaxing visual feast of Yellowstone, it is nice for that.",1353196800,3,465,4.482352941176471
8447999,5,B004Y8RV9C,"Wonderful DVD. We are going to Yellowstone this fall and this gives us a different view of what to look for. We also have the DVD on survival,quest for life in yellowstone. We can not wait to see this marvelous park in person.",1328054400,,226,4.27906976744186
8448000,5,B004Y8RV9C,"The video is wonderful, anyone that is interested in Yellowstone should see this. Even if you have been its a great video to see the site from a new angel!",1327363200,,155,4.2
