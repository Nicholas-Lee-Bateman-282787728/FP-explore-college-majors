2751131,4,B000MX7V6G,Star of this movie is edward norton. Brilliant acting. Surprise ending. enjoyed this movie. I would recommend especially if your interested in good courtroom dramas. I liked Richard Gere in both Primal Fear and Officer and a gentleman. Ironically Lou Gossett jr won for best supporting actor for Officer and a Gentleman. The award should have gone to Norton who at least was nominated.for Primal Fear. This collection was a good deal. 3 movies for a very reasonable price. Richard Gere along with the reliable Julia Roberts in The Runaway Bride. Although my favorite with these actors together is Pretty Woman. But thats for another review. Buy this collection. You won't be disappointed. Especially for the price.,1407024000,,714,5.111111111111111
2751132,5,B000MX7V6G,"I have shopped online enough to become, sometimes, overcome by the frustration involved with someone selling me bad product.

2751133,1,B000MX7V6G,I was looking forward to watching officer and a gentleman and not only was my package late but its the wrong movie. they gave me a triple feature with different movie titles and i don't even know how i would even get this fixed because the company had no number on the invoice. i would of given this a five star if i at least got the right movie!,1308009600,,346,4.028985507246377

2751135,5,B000MX7V6G,"I enjoy Richard Gere in just about everything I've seen him in, and appreciate getting a 3-in-1 for about the cost of one.  You have a little of everything in this package - serious love and passion in An Officer & a  Gentleman; fun love and whimsy in The Runaway Bride; and go-get-'em activity in Primal Fear.  Good job!",1247270400,2,321,4.406779661016949
