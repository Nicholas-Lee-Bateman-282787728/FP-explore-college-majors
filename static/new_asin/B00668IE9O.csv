8493752,5,B00668IE9O,"It is true that this documentary is glitzy and fun, but it is also an incredible testament to what so many gays had to suffer (and are still suffering) just to congregate together.  It truly moved me.  Kudos for sharing this.  I was born straight, but refuse to hate.  And, after having been bored stiff at some of the straight Mardi Gras balls,  I sure would love to be invited to one of these fantastic Mardi Gras balls.  They look like enormous fun.",1393545600,,452,4.385542168674699
8493753,5,B00668IE9O,"The Sons of Tennessee Williams journeys down memory lane and travels through some of the most colorful quarters of New Orleans. One part Project Runway on LSD, one part New Orleans tradition, and two parts gay heritage lesson, The Sons of Tennessee Williams is a playful and proud documentary work with humor and heart with ut taking itself too seriously. It is a reminder that heritage is a tapestry of tales and experiences. The film itself is told in a collage of images and voices, ghosts of the past, spirits of the elders- a devise that serves this film well. It is a wonderful illustration of how gays and straights have always been able to get along, once we agree to celebrate our difference instead of fear them.",1330732800,2,722,4.6484375
