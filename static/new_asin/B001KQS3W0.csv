8326538,1,B001KQS3W0,"This DVD titled ""Naughty School Girls"" is not the 1976/77 movie with Rebecca Brooke.  I really don't know what it is other than it has a 2008 copyright on the DVD box cover.  I can find no listing for it in the IMDb (I searched on the title as well as the actress names) and I can't tell anything about the movie because the copy I received was damaged beyond playability due to inadequate packaging.",1232409600,3,400,4.32
