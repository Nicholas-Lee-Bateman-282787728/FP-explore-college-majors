8726975,5,B01348HYOO,"Fun workout that challenges you. After the great warm up, be prepare to sweat, because what follows is a tough 5 minute tabata cardio that will left you breathing hard! Then, there are the thighs, calves and butt toning portions, the thighs and calves portions have some body-weight and plyo exercises that really burn the targeted area. I then used my Step 360 (or you could use a bosu if you want) for the butt portion to increase the balance challenge for: squats, single leg squat, single leg dead-lift, leg lifts and bridges, I even added tubing for the exercises in all 4s position. The ballet grooves bonus is great and the stretch at the end is ""flowy"" and just wonderful (I wish she would come out with a full hour of dancer's floor stretch, it is that good!). All in all, it is a fun and sweaty workout, music is very good and upbeat, and Ilyse the instructor is just great! Totally recommend!",1470960000,,903,4.512195121951219
