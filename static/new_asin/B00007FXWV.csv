7975734,1,B00007FXWV,"If you just require a quick nostalgia check then this release might suffice, however I really can't recommend it.
Although the Cisco Kid was filmed in colour (but processed poorly)the episodes presented here are in black & white. They appear to be old TV prints as they still contain the original ZIV logo.
Whoever wrote the sleeve notes had no idea what he was talking about,Pancho is refered to as Poncho and the actor portrayng him  as 'Poncho Carrilo'.(It was Leo Carrilo)this is just sloppy research.
Claims that the contents have been remastered I seriously doubt as the Robin Hood episodes are way too dark and fuzzy.
If you would like to see Robin Hood then check out the UK releases by Network on [...] where the entire 4 seasons are available as box sets in much better quality than presented here and I believe are region free.",1108080000,3,838,4.662162162162162
7975735,4,B00007FXWV,"This two-disc set includes 3 episodes from The Cisco Kid AND 3 episodes from The Adventures of Robin Hood, both enjoyable television adventure series from the 1950s.  While the visual quality is fair to good (a little dark at times on The Robin Hood episodes), the rarity of both of these shows on DVD makes this disc a good, inexpensive addition for those who enjoy classic television from the 1950s, especially as it's unlikely that we'll see any ""full season"" releases that are becoming the norm for more recent television shows.
The Adventures of Robin Hood was broadcast on CBS in the United States from 1955 to 1958.  It was produced by Sapphire Films in England by American ex-pat Hannah Weinstein, who also produced The Adventures of Sir Lancelot and other ""Adventures of"" series in the 1950s, based on historical figures.  For an early television adventure series, the production was superb with good scripts (some written by blacklisted Hollywood writers), good acting, and innovative set design.  And, for many Baby Boomers, Richard Greene was the ONLY Robin Hood.  The episodes selected include both of the actresses who played the role of Lady Marian Fitzwalter:  Bernadette O'Farrell and Patricia Driscoll.  All in all, this was an entertaining series that still holds up well.
Also entertaining is The Cisco Kid, with Duncan Reynaldo as Cisco and Leo Carillo as Poncho.  The show is very much in the vein of The Lone Ranger, but a bit lighter thanks to the comedic talents of Carillo.
The releasing company of this DVD, Nostalgia Ventures, has a small, but interesting catalog of television shows from the 1950s under the banner ""Prime Time TV from the Early Days.""  Fans of the ""Golden Age of Television"" would do well to check them out.",1065052800,,1753,4.915254237288136
