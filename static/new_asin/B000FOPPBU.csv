2578298,5,B000FOPPBU,"House on Haunted Hill, Both the 1959 Original and the 1999 Movie are awesome, I really like Vincent Price in the movie and I acutally liked Chris Katan in the Remake!",1275264000,,166,4.387096774193548
2578299,3,B000FOPPBU,"This DVD contains two versions of The House on Haunted Hill,the original Feb/59 release version and the remake Oct/99 release version. It has been years since I have seen the original version and I do recall viewing the remake when it first came out,but this is the first time I was able to view them one after the other and make a comparison between the two. And the winner is......HHH the /59 version,no doubt!
The original stars Vincent Price as an eccentric millionaire Frederick Loran who throws a ""party"" for his wife Annabelle(Carol Ohmart).It seems there's tension between the two hosts of the shindig,in fact you might say a murderous one. Five guests are invited to attend along with the current owner of the home Mr. Pritchard(Elisha Cook Jr.).They arrive in five separate cars led by a hearse and when they get settled in each are given their own party favours of a loaded revolver. Each revolver comes in its' own cute little coffin. Mr Loren explains that each person will receive a $1,000,000 if they can stay the entire night and still be alive in the morning. Also they may leave before midnight but after that the house will be sealed until morning. Mr. Pritchard is the party downer here as he predicts dire consequences ahead for all.
As the night wears on some of the guests are experiencing some unusual occurrences such as ghostly sightings and strange disappearances. At one point Annabelle is found hung and ""dead"" at the top of the stairs but this doesn't seem to stop sightings of her from occurring around the mansion,long after her death. Much of this activity seems to be centered around a secretary from one of Loren's companies,one Nora Manning(Carolyn Craig).She comes to believe Loren himself is behind everything and intends to kills her. When Loren and her meet in the cellar she shoots him. While she is gone to alert the guests upstairs,a doctor in the group comes down to investigate the doings. It seems the doctor and Loren's wife are the ones actually behind everything. Loren was ""shot"" by blanks in Nora's gun and as the doctor pushes Loren into a large pool of acid the lights go out. Meanwhile Annabelle,who is still alive and kicking,also comes to the basement and is confronted by a walking skeleton and her husband's voice. The skeleton forces Annabelle towards the acid into which she falls. Loren emerges out of the shadows with a portable mechanical device which was manipulating the skeleton. Just then the others arrive to hear Loren's explanation of just what the late doctor and his wife were planning to do to Loren,what he did and now he is quite pleased to surrender himself to the authorities if need be. The movie ends with Pritchard looking into the camera and warning us about the house spirits that may be coming for us.
Vincent Price is the literal center of this film. He chews up the scenery and dominates every moment he is on. Watching him reminded me(as if I needed it)what a good actor he was. The other actor with the most impact is Elisha Cook Jr. as Pritchard. An over 50 year veteran of the movies who worked with many of the biggest names in Hollywood in films like The Maltese Falcon,The Big Sleep,Born to Kill,Ball of Fire,Dillinger,Shane and so many more. His character adds tremendously to the eeriness and feel of the movie. The other actors in this flick are quite pedestrian in their roles. In fact Craig who plays the secretary and has a big part is one of the most wooden actresses you will ever see and almost ties with the doctor in that department.
The /99 version of House is the least appealing of the two flicks. The names and plot are changed from the original version...to protect the innocent?....who knows. It is now one Steven Price(Geoffrey Rush) who rents the house from its' owner Mr Pritchett(Chris Kattan) for a party. Like the original the guests all arrive in separate limo's ,given their guns and told to leave by mignight or else. But this is basically where the two part company. The plot here focuses more on the houses' origins;that is it used to be an insane asylum whose macabre head,one Dr Vannacutt(Jeffrey Combs),is apparently still haunting the place. The building contains some nasty leftovers from its dysfunctional past like shock therapy rooms,operating rooms and psycho-traumatic treatment machines. Though they are very dusty,they will work when the power is turned on;and work they most definitely do. While the spirits of the house in the original film are more implied than actually seen,in this film they are mostly definitely seen and are quite malevolent. It is like the souls of a 1,001 maniacs have all grouped together into one spirit. And here is what finally killed,so to speak,a promising movie...the entity itself. The grouping of tortured souls in the creature who finally confronts the remaining group look like an animated ink blot;not scary just cheap looking,even for 1999 standards! In the end only two people live to see the dawn outside the house,perched on a tall ledge,but with $5,000,000 of money in cashier cheques to soften the blow.
It is a disappointment for sure as stars Rush,Jansen,Diggs,and even Kattan as the geeky house owner,do a credible job where their acting is concerned. The sub par plot gets the best of them and,like a good soldier,just fades away;to be mercifully dragged away by the houses' giant spirit/entity at just the right moment.
Techincally the /59 original B&W will look alot less appealing compared to the /99 colour version,to some. But while it has its' flaws the print is generally quite clear and crisp and justs adds to the flicks flavour. The /99 version is a good transfer with no visible flaws to speak of. This DVD is a dreaded DSD(double sided disc) so beware of scratches and scuffs when or if you get your copy. On the DVD there is only a trailer for the /59 version. The /99 version has the glut of special features with a featurette,trailer,director commentary and deleted scenes.
All in all it is nice to have with both films in your hands for comparison purposes. You can easily see that time and better S/FX don't necessarily mean a better film. Castles' film while a little hokey and with some of its' participants with less than stellar acting skills,STILL manages to beat out its' newer competitor by a mile./99 just cannot beat /59's ambiance./59 House comes in at 3 1/2 stars while /99 House straggles in at around 2 1/2 stars.",1269734400,,6423,4.792605951307484
2578300,5,B000FOPPBU,"It's cool that they put the old verison with the new verison together. it helps to keep things in prespective, though I really love the newest verison great special effects, with plenty of things to make you jump. very well done, and well written.

2578301,1,B000FOPPBU,I never received this product in the mail (House on Haunted Hill with Vincent Price) and would very much like a refund!,1226880000,,119,4.454545454545454
2578302,3,B000FOPPBU,"They say remakes are horrible, and ""they"" are usually right. The poster child for unnecessary Hollywood remaking is ""House on Haunted Hill,"" remade from a Vincent Price cult hit of the same name.

In the case of the ""House on Haunted Hill"" two-pack, viewers can see a prime example. One of the movies is a dark, witty, well-acted horror-mystery with a nice twist at the finale, and the second is trashy, plotless, and hasn't got a single surprise in the mix. Only half of it is worth having.

In the original, Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) decides to host a macabre birthday party for his devious wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), in the ""House on Haunted Hill."" He invites a test pilot, a columnist, a secretary and the house's unbalanced owner, and offers each one ten thousand dollars if they stay all night. Chandeliers fall, eerie people appear, doors slam shut, and they get little guns in coffins.

But as the night goes on, poor Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig) begins to see specters and rotted heads. The others think she's hysterical -- until Annabelle is found hanging in the hallway, dead. The unfortunate guests start to suspect that Loren brought them there to murder them (except for the owner, who blames ghosts). But the truth is far more complex and sinister.

William Castle made some middling movies in his time, but he was truly inspired with ""House on Haunted Hill"" -- good casting, good sets, low budget and kitchy scares. Unfortunately, whoever made the remake ignored every single thing that made the original good.

An oddball millionaire (Geoffrey Rush) invites several people to an old lunatic asylum, which is said to be haunted -- if they make it through the night, they will each receive a million dollars. They think it's an easy way to make fast cash, and that the gruesome stories of torture and death are just to mess with their heads.

But, of course, ghoulies and ghosties and things that go bump in the night begin to surface, and the guests start to suspect that they may not survive until morning. Especially since the millionaire and his cunning wife (Famke Janssen) may have murder on their minds. Will anyone escape the house alive?

An eccentric millionaire, murderous wife and supposedly cursed house are about all these movies have in common; it's as though the people doing the remake simply read a spoiler-free summary of the original, and based the entire film around it.

Castle's has understated scares, a giant Victorian-furnished house, eerie artificial visions and no ghosts whatsoever -- the real spooks in the house are the human ones. The plot is a remarkably clever one; by the finale, it has tricked you at least twice with plot twists that are not what they seem. Plenty of witty one-liners that will stick in your mind, too -- ""Don't stay up thinking of ways to get rid of me. It makes wrinkles.""

Don't expect that high quality in the remake -- appallingly cliched, plotless, and full of buckets of blood and deformed ghosts. It's also got some of the worst scripting in recent memory, such such pearls of wisdom as, ""The house doesn't care what's fair, who lives or dies. Know why? Cause it's a f**king HOUSE!""

The original movie has amazing acting from the immortal Price, the sleek Carol Ohmart, and the screamy Carolyn Craig; even the unimportant characters are handled well. In comparison, the remake's cast is forgettable and show no signs of talent, with two exceptions: Geoffrey Rush doing his best to fill Price's enormous shoes, and Famke Jansson as his poisonous wife, who has ""always loved... your money!""

This two-pack basically contains the perfect example of a remake gone wrong, and a magnificent movie that inspired it. The sublime and the ridiculous.",1157068800,8,3728,4.845911949685535

8124970,1,B000FOPPBU,"Unless you only want the 1959 version, do not purchase this. I bought this because I wanted the remake and I am a Prime member so paying the $13 for what I THOUGHT would be both the original and remake with 2-day shipping would be one heck of a bargain.

The description for this product is misleading - saying ""Number of discs: 2"" when it, in fact, is only one double sided disc. So my 2 DVD players and PS3 would not read the 2nd side (remake), only the top side (original). I'd return it but it's not worth the postage or hassle. ",1491091200,,533,4.165048543689321

8124975,5,B000FOPPBU,"One Of My favorite movies with Vincent Prince; and it comes with the 1999 remake. I love both movies but nothing can beat the original one. The only thing that disappointed me was I bought it before it came out in color, but it is still a great movie. The remake is just as chilling, but the original that came out in the late 50's is scary. I am glad I bought the 2 for one, because I like both movies, and Geoffrey Rush is wicked in this thriller. If you like classic horror this is a must have for you, the 99 version is great also. This has none of the cheese you see in a majority of todays horror, these are great movies to add to your collection.

8124976,5,B000FOPPBU,"A classic horror movie. Vincent Price is simple in his acting but he doesn't have to be anything more than that. He gets the point across making you think is he in on this or is somebody else.

I also like the film because it isn't showing blood and mutilation which a lot of horror films show today. Scaring somebody doesn't mean sticking them on a meat hook.

This movie is meant to be watched on Halloween with a bowl full of candy with the lights out.

Order it sit back and enjoy. Remember it is 1959 so you have to go with some of the things that it shows.",1412985600,,562,4.090909090909091
8124977,5,B000FOPPBU,"One of the few remakes that I like better than the original. The original is classic Vincent Price, creepy but a little hokey. The new one is much more modern horror. Still creepy as hell  but way more gore. I like to watch these 2 back to back to see all the similarities and differences.",1410048000,,289,4.254545454545455
8124978,5,B000FOPPBU,"Remakes are rarely (if ever) close to the original, this is no exception. But the remake isn't terrible by any stretch. Nice to have both on the same set to compare.
