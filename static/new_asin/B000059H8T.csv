1407005,5,B000059H8T,"First of all, Earl Klugh's style is original, his technique is awesome, and his melodies melt in your heart, not in your ears. Secondly, the quality of the DVD is great. I watched it on my PC monitor and found smooth video graphics. Whether you like jazz or not, you'll enjoy this selection. The only thing missing is the credits for the band members. They're awesome performers and a pleasure to watch, be it in improvising or backing. I hope the producers won't forget to include them next time.",998524800,7,497,4.595505617977528
1407006,5,B000059H8T,"Excellence is the word that describes this DVD the best. The picture quality, the sound quality, the band members and Mr. Klugh are all top notch on this one. I've been a fan of his for awhile but I really never had a desire to go see him in concert until now!! Any smooth jazz fan should get this DVD!!!",995068800,4,304,4.083333333333333
1407007,5,B000059H8T,"My name is Lenny Price.  I have been touring and recording as the saxophonist with jazz legend Earl Klugh for more than three years.
I purchased ""The Jazz Channel Presents Earl Klugh (BET on Jazz)"" DVD and discovered that the members of Earl's band are not credited for our performance.  It seems this detail was omitted during the complicated process of preparing the packaging and end credits for this product.  ...
David Spradley - Keyboards;  Lorenzo ""Spoons"" Brown - Percussion;  Ron Otis - Drums;  Al Turner - Bass;  Al Duncan - Synthesizers;  Lenny Price - Saxophones, Yamaha WX5 wind synthesizer
And of course ... Earl Klugh - Acoustic guitar
Performing with musicians of this caliber has been both my pleasure and privilege.  It was great to finally be able see our show from the audience's point-of-view.  And, the outstanding image and audio quality made the experience even more rewarding!
Hopefully, this information will help you all connect a little more intimately with Earl's music.... Enjoy!

1407055,5,B000059H8T,always have dug Eaarl Klugh's distinctive guitar picking and tone and this live set truly was no exception and the band was tight and very detail.  the crowd was feeling it and that whole vibe set it off real nicely. the musicianship especially if your speakers are tight is going to make you feel you are right there front and center.  Earl Klugh is One of my favorite guitar players and his band is the truth as well. very enjoyable and a  soulful atmosphere.,1331510400,,461,4.464285714285714
1407056,5,B000059H8T,"It seems that most everyone agrees that this is a special DVD concert by Earl Klugh. I only wish this was done in a more relaxed or should I say less 'recording studio' like setting. Having said that, I really enjoyed the quality of the recording on this DVD. If you love smooth jazz and/or Earl Klugh, get this DVD.",1305849600,,316,4.283333333333333
1407057,5,B000059H8T,"I was given a recorded cassette tape of Earl Klugh's music 10 years ago. I love his music, and play it in my car all the time, but I've never explored further until now. I bought this DVD along with two other of his CD. This is a great DVD of his live performace on BET Jazz Channel. It had wonderful sound and the rest of band members were great too. Unfortunately, like the Saxophonist Lenny Price pointed out that the band members were not properly credited on the DVD due to the editing error?  I think that Lenny Price himself put out a great performace as well.

Over all, this is one of my favorite DVD, and it'll be on the top of my playing list. If you like Earl Klugh's music, this is a must collection for his fans. It's highly recommended.",1264464000,,751,4.208333333333333
1407058,5,B000059H8T,"This is a real nice DVD. I've watched it at least 3 times now and I'm going to go watch it again tonight. I love sitting in my A/V room in the basement, drinking a scotch and water and smoking a nice cigar while watching this DVD. You'll really learn to love Earl Klugh after this video. I definitely recommend buying this DVD.",1252454400,,327,4.2063492063492065
1407059,5,B000059H8T,"This DVD by Earl Klugh is at the top of my play list. It is that GOOD. Jazz is a fairly wide genre with many moods. This is the kind of jazz that I like best. Excellence in musicianship, flawless selection, and an uninterrupted flow of music brings unabated delight. Beyond 5 stars definitely.",1225929600,,293,4.444444444444445
1407060,5,B000059H8T,I'm a fan of Earl Klugh for over two decades. I first saw him in concert in San Francisco in the early 80's and was blown away with his melodic sounds. I have seen him live many times since. I purchased this DVD about three years ago and loved it. I recently bought a Home theater system and decided to listen to this DVD for the first time on the system. I couldn't believe the sound! If you think this concert is good on a regular system you need to hear it on a Home Theater! I hope Klugh goes on tour again soon. I am ready for another fix!,1204848000,,544,3.9545454545454546
1407061,5,B000059H8T,"This is an impressive DVD/audio.  I have never seen him perform, just have several of his CDs.

The picture-video is satisfactory, the sound is excellent, anyone know of any other recorded concert by Klugh?, now mywife wants to go see him live when he swings nearby...

1407062,5,B000059H8T,"This is my first review ever of a product I have purchased. This tells how much I liked this DVD: the music, the sound, the members of the band, the MUSIC. This DVD is all about the music generated by each member of the band, how they blend, it's a fantastic band. I will certainly purchase the next ones. If you like contemporary jazz, this is an excellent DVD. Kudos to Earl Klugh for his music. Highly recommended.",1192147200,,417,4.358974358974359
1407063,5,B000059H8T,"I heard Earl Klugh for the first time in college of Architecture in 1980. I was so thrilled about the quality of his renditions, and the incredible musical arrangements. I never thought I would get to see him play live someday. But this recording is as good as it gets close to a live participation.

This performer/composer happens to be one of the few I call the best in their genre. Wow. To not own an Earl Klugh recording, for a contemporary jazz music lover, is like living in America without a car!

His compositions give you every penny's worth of your investment. He executes his works of art in a manner revealing an artifice of representation. I am a collector of music over the last 29 years. My tastes are wide, just make the composition and execution good, and you got me.

Earl Klugh is my idea of a perfect work of art. Add nothing, lest you spoil its beauty; remove nothing, lest you dilute the goodness in the taste. Just take it raw, the way it is, for maximum enjoyment.

Isnt that why we listen to music; for maximum enjoyment? You will be glad you experienced this music in your lifetime.",1189900800,,1109,4.448275862068965
1407083,5,B000059H8T,"This is a great buy. If you've ever been enthralled by Earl Klugh's melodic wizardry and you haven't seen this dvd, ask yourself, ""Why haven't I?""
There's great music on this disc; music that speaks to the heart and presented in a wholesome manner. The first thing you may notice about Earl and his band is the depth of passion about each one of them, and the ease with which they seem to flow and lull the audience. Couple that with great craftsmanship and what you get is top value entertainment.",1187481600,,498,4.483516483516484
1407084,5,B000059H8T,"I usually don't write reviews. I read them all the time but I never write them. But this DVD is so great that I felt obligated to put my two cents in. This is great music and the ""backup musicians"" are top notch. Especially the sax player. I think he's one of the best I've heard and jazz is basically the only thing I listen to so I know what I'm talking about. This is a must for any jazz DVD collection!!",1152748800,2,407,3.975609756097561
1407085,5,B000059H8T,"I fell in love with Earl's music after listening to his cds. Undoubtedly he's one of the best acoustic smooth jazz guitarists. Watching him play on stage gives absolute pleasure and tranquility. His music is enchanting and beautifully played. Though this studio performance only accommodates a handful of audience,its lighting and layout design actually enhance the ambience of the whole show which delivers an overall high-class feel to it. Earl and friends  really soothe your mind!",1145491200,4,484,5.368421052631579
1407086,5,B000059H8T,"Great songs.  Excellent musicianship.  Smooth jazz performed to perfection.  This has now become one of my favorite concert DVDs.  I mean up there with ""An Evening with Fourplay"", ""Sade Lovers Live"", & Lee Ritenour's ""Overtime"".  Great sound too.  I've got a few of the BET on Jazz concert DVDs and they are very well done.  The only thing I did not like was that Earl does not say a word the entire concert, not even to introduce his extroadinary band members.  I was so impressed that I had to find out who these guys were but was surprised to find no listing of the band in the credits or anywhere in the extras.  Terrible oversight.  After you check out this DVD you will want to know who these awesome players are, especially Lenny Price, the outstanding sax player.  This dude is bad!",1141084800,2,790,4.492957746478873
1407087,3,B000059H8T,"Im not going to go as far as saying this is a definitive Earl Klugh collection, but it is pretty decent. He has a full band backing him which i could have done without. The song selection is decent. There are 4 or 5 solid songs which makes it worth buying. I absolutely love watching Earl play. Every move he makes seems too easy. His hands just seem to glide upon the strings. If you are a guitar player, this is a must have.",1140739200,3,426,4.083333333333333
1407088,4,B000059H8T,"Earl Klugh has been playing acoustic guitar for many years now and I have several old vinyl records of his mastery. This DVD shows off his talents to perfection including the fact that most tracks are his own composition. Just sit back and enjoy this cruisy guitar player while sitting in front of a warm fire and sipping your favorite tipple.

1407089,5,B000059H8T,"Sigo la trayectoria de Earl desde los inicios de Dr. Macumba en disco de vinyl, desde esa poca qued prendado de ese sonido maravilloso que salen de sus mgicos dedos. Desde entonces he obtenido toda su discografa, sin embargo no tena el placer de poder verlo a travs de un vdeo. Es sensacional... con que facilidad y soltura toca la guitarra, Magia! Su banda es excelente y el sonido inmejorable. Lenny Price parece de otra galaxia! Altamente recomendable este vdeo. Sus fans esperamos por nuevo material. Bravo Earl!",1113004800,4,516,4.875
1407090,5,B000059H8T,If you don't have this one in your collection you are really missing out. Earl Klugh is at his phenomenal best. Lenny Price on saxes is from another planet! He has total command of his horns! Buy it! 10 bucks is theft!,1097107200,5,218,4.214285714285714
1407091,4,B000059H8T,"This is a fine musical performance that can be appreciated by anyone who enjoys jazz, whether a fan of Earl Klugh or not.  True to form, BET Jazz has come through with high production value in terms of sound quality and presentation.  The run time of only 73 minutes was a little disappointing (I'm a huge fan; I need more than 12 songs), but one must keep in mind the typical parameters of the original BET programming (this show aired in 2000).

Earl's band covers a very-easy-to-listen-to mix of songs, some funky and upbeat, others more mellow, ranging all the way back to the ""Finger Paintings"" album of 1977.  The band is tight, and the sound comes through pretty clearly.  Oddly enough, neither Earl nor any one of his band members utters so much as a word during the entire performance, which means you get a nice string of music with no interruption, but you have to refer to the liner notes to keep track of the song titles.  No worries.

The only noteworthy DVD ""extra"" is a 17-minute ""Meet the Artist"" feature which has Earl's commentary about musical influences, upbringing, thoughts on acoustic versus electric guitars, etc., interspersed with excerpts from the performance.",1094169600,6,1188,4.794117647058823
1407092,5,B000059H8T,"The greatest acoustic guitarist in the world, in concert. You know,Earl Klugh is a very talented guitarist and i've been wondering if he has his music on Video, until i saw this DVD and i promptly purchased it. Ever since i bought this DVD, i've been playing it each and every day, and i'm still playing it always  and even till the next 20 centuries, i'm sure i'll still be playing it. I love it just like all his other tracks on CD.  Every time i listen to this Great DVD, i feel at home, and at please with my number one Jazz artist in the Whole World. The Compilations are great and each tracks are beautifully rendered with a Grand Masters touch that can only come from no other acoustic guitarist than my Main-Man, Earl Klugh. I do recommend this DVD to all Jazz lovers in the Universe. It's a Great Collection.",1086912000,13,817,4.333333333333333
1407113,5,B000059H8T,"I have 30+ music DVD's in my collection from a wide variety of artists and styles.  I also have a pretty decent home theater setup that I've spent a great deal of time and money tweaking.
This DVD is one of THE BEST audio recordings/mixes I have on DVD.  The only other one's that compare are Eric Clapton's ""One More Car, One More Rider"" - DTS and Norah Jones Live - DD5.1.  I can crank up this Earl Klugh DVD and it just sounds better!  The mix is wonderful.  Drums are nice and full in the mix (as with Clapton's) and Bass guitar and lead acoustic guitar are also clean and in the right proportion.  Plus the musicians are just top-notch...particularly Klugh, the drummer, and the saxaphone player.  WOW.  Effortless yet highly technical playing.
My only complaint is the obligitory crowd shots which are mostly way too dark (almost a completely black screen).  What was the point?  Otherwise the video is also excellent with good lighting, color, and detail.  Should be 16:9 aspect ratio, of course, but most companies haven't figured this out yet!  I wish they all would.  The good news is you can jump right to the menu and skip the intro's, and the menu is simple static graphics, so you aren't waiting for some lame animation each time before you can navigate.  That is something all the companies could also learn!
If you love music and are even somewhat picky about audio, you will LOVE THIS DVD!  PERIOD!",1073779200,16,1415,4.581673306772909
1407114,5,B000059H8T,"This DVD was excellent.  It sets the standard for correctly produced video performances.  The stage seting, lighting, camera work and of course sound were the best. Mr Klugh said not one word during the entire performance.  There was about five seconds of claping before the next cut...YES!  All music all the time! If you like Jazz and especially guitar you will not be disappointed!",1065312000,,384,4.953125
1407115,5,B000059H8T,"There is no word to describe this DVD. It is simply awesome and the concert is flawless. I was glued to my seat and my mouth opening wide ""in awe of disbelief"" when I listened to the first song ""Wiggle"". Simply spectacular. All the songs are very melodic supported by a group of solid musicians which make Bon Jovi Band looks so miniscule.",1049846400,3,339,4.396825396825397
1407116,5,B000059H8T,I share the same reaction with Lenny Price.  I initially checked out this DVD from a local library and I was really thrilled.  I've been listening to Earl since the early 70's back in the Philippines.  I've been collecting musical dvds (as my kids take most of the movies) and I can only honestly say that the audio quality is superb not to mention the selection of the songs.  Indeed the supporting artists deserve the proper credits.  I was actually curious about the different musicians that played with Earl and thanks to Lenny.  Now I can buy two copies to be shared to my brothers back in the Philippines for them to enjoy/treasure,1046044800,6,637,4.592920353982301
1407117,5,B000059H8T,I have been a fan of Earl Klugh for years. Now with all the new technologies they make him sound even better.his backup musicians are simply great. Audio and videoare just about flawless. If you have ever liked any of Earl's music you will not be disappointed in this one. I liked this dvd the very first time I played it. Go and buy it. You will not be sorry!,1040515200,2,360,4.1571428571428575
1407118,5,B000059H8T,"I have been an Earl Klugh fan for some time now and always longed to see him perform. I got my wish ...when he came to Barbados for our annual Jazz Festival. I got my second chance having purchased this video. It is excellent!! Earl Klugh is a real professional and an excellent guitarist. My favourite is Take It from the Top. It's catchy and bouncy with the typical Earl Klugh melodic flair. The audience really seemed to enjoy that one.'Rayna' is smooth and romantic and really moving. I watch this video every chance I get. This video is truly a classic and so are Earl and his band. I highly recommend this video to any Earl Klugh fan or any one who just likes good music. What's amazing is that Earl Klugh's style in playing is so cool but the results are so powerful. He'll just take your breath away. Excellent stuff.
This review is on the Video version.",1015718400,6,862,4.39375
1407119,5,B000059H8T,"As a ""diehard"" fan, I saw Earl a few years ago, in Denver, and was relatively disappointed with how few of his classics he played.  Out of a set of roughly 16 songs, only 3 or 4 were songs written prior to 1994.  That is why this DVD is so terrific!  It is full of the classics.  ""Livin' Inside Your Love"" and ""Dr. Macumba"" have a bit of a 2001 twist to them, whereas ""Midnight In San Juan"" is just as we all remember it.  I was thrilled that he included ""Mt. Airy Road"", even though it's sans-George Benson.
I highly recommend this DVD, as it is a wonderful mix of the Late 70's - Early 80's Klugh, mixed with a few of his newer hits.",1010361600,,635,4.007936507936508
1407120,4,B000059H8T,"First of all I think this is a good DVD, but I hate watching and hearing in no perfect syncronitation and this is exactly what happens with the oppening tracks. The band is excellent (And I thank Lenny Price for the names 'cause I was still looking for them in the DVD credits or in an Earl's explanation. By the way, Lenny, your work is fantastic here and on every record you touch).Theese are the reasons that have made me vote only 4 stars, but I have enjoyed this concert a lot.
