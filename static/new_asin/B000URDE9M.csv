There are a lot of BIG names on those KO volumes. Jardine, Ludwig, Stevenson, Alves, Villasenor, Bennett, Gamburyan, Brennan, Radach, Buentello, etc.

For the price, you cannot go wrong with this set. Big stars and Big KO's. It's not the same production quality of a UFC PPV or DVD, but being a compilation, it is non-stop action.

The only criticism I have on this set is the Kendall Grove Vs. Hector Ramirez fight is on BOTH the KO's (disc 5) and the Reality Stars (disc 1).  Though I understand that the KO's and the Reality Stars 2 are seperate compilations.",1247616000,4,2410,4.762019230769231
