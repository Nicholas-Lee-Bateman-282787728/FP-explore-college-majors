1007070,5,630527827X,"Considering this film was released in 1965, the special effects WERE cutting-edge at the time.  Despite what others have written, there IS a plot to this film.  And as far as the acting goes, take it from a naive  Japanese speaker -- the acting was just fine.  All-in-all, I'd say this was  a well done Japanese scifi film.",957225600,,323,4.5
1007071,5,630527827X,"Giant Monster Gamera (LBX , SUBS).
For many years these films have been produced on cheapy SLP tapes , and never subtitled..Now , it is. The movie is one that any true Kaiju fan should buy if not , only rent it then. The  film has been completely remastered and its uncut.
In the film , Gamera  is awakened by a plane that crashes into the artic. From there on Gamera  goes on a killing spree , but not because he's violent , instead the  creature is hungry.(Don't beleive me? check out the cover's reverse side)  After destroying much of Japan the beast is rocketted into outer space....  Other movies are.. Gamera Vs. Barugon , Gamera Vs. Gaos (Gayos , Gyaos) ,  Gamera Vs. Viras , Gamera Vs. Guiron , Gamera Vs. Jiger , Gamera Vs. Zigra  , SuperMonster - Gamera (yuck) , Gamera : Guardian of the Universe , G2 :  Advent of Legion and G3 : Awakening of Irys (Iris)...All are okay but maybe  not to all....",937958400,17,907,4.313609467455621
1007072,5,630527827X,"After many years and cheap, SLP-mode speed video re-releases of various titles from the ""Gamera"" movie series, someone gives the giant, flying turtle the respect he deserves. This video is the original Japanese  film, letterboxed with English subtitles. The print of the film is superb  and the story tells a slightly different story than the American cut. While  not the terrible monster that Godzilla started out to be, Gamera was a fast  favorite of Japanese children. This movie, with its surprising ending, will  be a great film for kids and for parents to relive their memories of the  flying turtle.",935798400,7,606,5.01
1007073,5,630527827X,"Apparently, this the was original Japanese version released in Japan of the dubbed rubber monsterfest ' Gammera the Invincible.'  It's really cool to see these movies( Japanese monster movies ) subtitled in widescreen. It  gives these movies a respectability, not like the crappy home video  versions of the last four Godzilla movies. See this movie the way it was  meant to be seen.",932601600,,383,5.031746031746032

7887245,4,630527827X,"This is the best Gamera flick of its series. This is what started it all. The reason I did't give it a 5 because to me and Im not trying to be hard on this movie it resembles to much like
Godzilla in a way. But overal its a must have Gamera Film plus its uncut and original. Theres not more comments just get it. HG",1079827200,,315,3.787878787878788
7887246,4,630527827X,"Giant monster Gamera/aka Gamera the invincible. This is the first Gamera film. It was originally shot as a back up plan to a disastrous film project about car sized rats. The film was put together with a shoestring budget - That's why it was shot in black and white; To save money...
A doctor in zoology, his assistant, and a photographer, are out in the Arctic, in a Eskimo village, to study a ancient legend about giant turtle. Suddenly, mysterious airplanes are spotted in the sky. They run silent and their origin is a mystery. However, the US airforce has spotted them too, and they decide to investigate. The mysterious aircraft's, refuses to identify themselves, missile fire are exchanged! One of the mysterious airplane crashes, a huge explosion occurs - The plane was carrying a A-bomb! When everything has calmed down after this, something as powerful as the A-bomb arises from the ice - Gamera! The beast is however not a benign creature, the first thing it does is to sink the teams boat, all onboard dies. The huge ancient turtle makes eventually its way to Japan. Weapon can't pierce its skin. Different plans are carried out, but they all fail - It seems futile, is there any hope at all, for Japan?
The special effects are good. The story is intelligent - It's a very good film!
(Can one say anything bad about a monster film, which Tokyo tower is being wrecked in?)
They had a shoe string budget, but they have made magic with it...
This edition is a quality one; Hard video box, good picture quality, trailers and theatrical stills after the film, and a lot of info on the two sided cover sleeve. It's also is subtitled, not dubbed - Which me, from a non-English speaking country, without tradition of dubbing - Appreciates a lot!
Thanks, Neptune media!",1004227200,3,1772,4.6826923076923075
7887247,5,630527827X,"I am a fan of both Gamera and Godzilla. However, this changes with the newer movies. (For the 90s, I prefer Gamera.)
This is a movie you have to look beyond how real things appear to be. Are the special effects from Toho better than what this movie offers? Yes and no. This movie was made on a very limited budget. In response to another reviewer, that's why this movie was black and white. It's all stated in the notes on the back side of the case insert.
In the begining of the movie, the planes may look fake, but look at how they are moving. They move around in formation, and they aren't flopping around on a string. With Godzilla movies around this time, the planes may look more real, but they aren't very steady on those strings. Plus, the filmmaking styles I feel are superior regardless of how crazy the story might seem.
Another thing to understand is the actors speaking English were not speaking for an Engliah audience. It was for Japanese who spoke English. Anyone who has seen the newer Godzilla movies in Japanese will find the same thing. The acting for the non-dubbed English speaking characters sounds terrible. Here, the actor sounds as if he's reading his lines as he speaks.
I feel the Gamera editors do a better job of piecing scenes together. (This is something I figured out after writing my review for the 1995 Gamera movie.) The scenes seem to move along more because they switch between different angles more. In the newer movies, the Godzilla editors hold angles for too long even in action scenes. (This is very true in Godzilla 2000.) Naturally, in these older movies, things move a little slower than in the newer ones. Movies just tended to move at a slower pace back then.
I definitely recommend this version over the English version - especially after seeing the preview on the tape. Like the 1954 Godzilla movie, American studios felt there had to be scenes added in to make it work for American audiences. When Godzilla was released in the US in 1956, it seemed to work very well. With Gamera, they make it appear as if the American military solves everything. In the original Japanese edition, different nations work together to take care of Gamera. There's even a shot of an American hugging a Russian at the end - in the 1960s!!",992476800,2,2269,4.5911330049261085

7887249,2,630527827X,"I am not a big Gamera fan (I am a Godzilla fan, but I'm putting him aside of this review so I give Gamera a fair trial).  This movie had many  problems with it.
1.  Gamera's fire.  Sure it looked real if you ignored  the disturbingly visable tube that it is coming from.
2.  The cartoonie  flying effects.  Enuff said.
3.  The lousy plot.  A giant flying turtle  who likes little kids?  C'mon!
4.  The little kid.  Someone finally found  a kid more annoying than Ichiro (notice I said Ichiro not Godzilla) from  Godzilla's Revenge (even though he was not as annoying as the Pepsi  girl).
5.  (Which probably bugs me most) It's in Black and White!  This  film was made in 1965, Toho started using color in the late 50's with Rodan  (notice I said Rodan, not Godzilla).  Now I don't have anything against  black and white movies, but this fact just bothered me!
I'm not saying  that no one should watch this movie, I'm just saying it's not for me.",966643200,2,945,4.3604651162790695
7887250,3,630527827X,"This film was made in 1965, after Godzilla had battled Angilious, Rodan, Ghidorah, Mothra and even King Kong. He was now starring in his 5th movie ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero"". The Toho Studios struck a gold mine  with thier monster films and it was just a matter of time before some body  would come along and rip it off. ""Gamera"" premiered just as  ""Monster Zero"" was hit theaters and both battled at the japanese  box office. Godzilla had already had 4 color films and this new monster  film was in black and white... which was pretty rare for this time. Mabey  they wanted to start out just like Godzilla and his 1954 black and white  appearance. The film itself has a pretty decent storyline with decent  effects backing it up. Gamera is really a nice turtle with a mean streak...  because he's friendly to children but, he destroys Japan with lots of fury  and burns buildings to the ground with his realistic fire breath (his fire  looks even better than Godzilla's radioactive breath because Toho hand  draws Godzilla's rays on each piece of film, which looks kind of cartoonish  as Gamera's company used real fire that is shot out of the Gamera suit's  mouth). The army wants to kill him but, children love him. It's the best  film of the original series (the rest being horribly corney and fake cheapo  looking films). The next best ones are the new films that are being  released just recently in the states. All in all, Gamera will always be a  Godzilla wannabe, but if you like Godzilla movies you will really enjoy  these films too!",959904000,,1545,4.613970588235294
