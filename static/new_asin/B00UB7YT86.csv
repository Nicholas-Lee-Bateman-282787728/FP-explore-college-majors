8705160,3,B00UB7YT86,"Five hooligans of diverse backgrounds rob a bank wearing scary clown masks. As they make their getaway we are shown flashbacks of their hiring, some earlier scenes, and of the robbery itself. Things are not what they seem. The flashbacks were useful to supply the irony and twist. Some of the flashbacks worked better than the others.

Much of the film is conversation among the hooligans, thus we get to see inside their ""dangerous mind"". Our bad guys are being followed by a murderous detective who seems to know their every move, even when they aren't sure where they are going. Decent characters and dialogue.

Worth a rental.
