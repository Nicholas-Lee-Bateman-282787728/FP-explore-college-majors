8496140,5,B006BLKXFY,"Jason Gibson is a genius!! I ordered all of his chemistry, his calculus and all of his physics!! So far I have just completed the chemistry and I have such a greater understanding because of this man.  He breaks everything down to such a simple easy to understand format. Please, Jason Gibson, come out with an organic chemistry tutor DVD set!!",1423008000,,344,4.639344262295082

8496142,5,B006BLKXFY,I used this for my first gen chem course ever which was in college. Loved this and it helped me understand and relate to the course work assigned in the semester. Def recommend to help with prep and understanding!,1401926400,,213,4.487179487179487
8496143,5,B006BLKXFY,"I got these dvds for my husband, who is going to nursing school.  He watched these before his chemistry class, and he said it made a huge difference.  Jason Gibson makes everything easy to understand, and is not at all boring.  Get these for any class that you need to take - you won't regret it.",1371600000,,296,4.25
8496144,5,B006BLKXFY,"This is a continuation of Jason's Chemistry 1 tutor video series.  In this volume he mostly deals with acid-base reactions and titrations.  Like in all his other videos he will give you an introduction to the subject, tell you what you already need to understand to get the material, and then does a lot of examples.  The examples he gives range in difficulty level from fairly easy, to hard.  He really does try to get you to understand the thought process in solving these types of problems, and going from what you know to what you need to solve.  He explains really well how you will sometimes have to essentially solve the problem backwards to get to the correct answer, and explains why he is doing what he is throughout the problem.

The main reason I keep buying Jason's DVDs as opposed to just trying to find things on the internet, is because he really takes the time to break down problems step by step, and give you the skills you need to solve problems.  And you can take those skills to solve problems in the material he does skip.  This set covers about another chapter or 2 (depending on how the book you are using is laid out). From what I can tell the only material that you will get exposed to in Chemistry I, that Jason does not cover in this set is the ideal gas law material and the stuff on thermodynamics.  He has however put out a physics DVD on thermodynamics that does cover a lot of that material.  As people who have taken Chemistry and Physics knows there is a lot of cross over between the subjects when it comes to the thermodynamics material.  Hence, if you take chemistry first it will help at that point in physics, and if you take physics first it will help you in chemistry.  So if you get that set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-Physics-2-Tutor-Thermodynamics-Vol-One-Three-Disk-Edition/dp/B001KT61EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate Physics 2 Tutor: Thermodynamics - Vol. One ( Three Disk Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the 4 volumes of the Chemistry 1 tutor you will know most of what you are going to need for the first semester of General Chemistry.  Some of the material on the physics DVD will not necessarily be covered in chemistry, but the basic ideas are.

If your learning style is compatible with learning from a DVD, then I highly recommend this set.  The drawback of course are that you cannot interact and ask questions, so if that is something you need to learn you may have to go for in person tutoring, but this is far better than trying to learn the material out of a book.",1371340800,,2577,4.785553047404063
8496145,5,B006BLKXFY,"at age sixty eight I had doubts taking on the subject any further than I have already gone.
Jason Gibson as opened my mind to a whole new outlook to learning and exploring the world of chemistry.
thanks Jason and amazon for the experience.",1365638400,,239,4.454545454545454
8496146,5,B006BLKXFY,"I'M Not The Brightest Bulb In The Lamp. This Dvd Will Go Step By Step FOr AnyOne Who Struggles With ChemistY.
He's Very ThOughral.

Highly Recommended!",1365033600,,151,4.8076923076923075
8496147,5,B006BLKXFY,"These DVDs are clear, simple and complete -- meant to supplement a textbook, not substitute for it. Watch it on your TV and it becomes an entertaining show. I bought the entire set for my boyfriend and it boosted his grade substantially. The material is quite comprehensive and can also be used as a refresher when going from high school to college chemistry. I HIGHLY recommend the series for any student who needs that extra push towards comprehension.",1351123200,,454,4.833333333333333
