2931170,4,B000V6LSSQ,A wonderful Christmas movie. A bit of a tear jerker though. Top quality that we have come to expect from the Hallmark series of Christmas movies. So glad I found it for my Christmas movie collection. Recommend for any family Christmas collection.,1420416000,,246,4.880952380952381

2931172,5,B000V6LSSQ,"This movie was a wonderful movie. This was the first year I got to watch it and it was amazing. I do Homehealth and a client I have was telling me about some movies that they like and I told them about this one and since my client doesn't get the hallmark channel they ordered this movie and when they watched it my client even got teary eyed about it , but they 2 loved this movie. I guess another reason I like it is because I have a family member who is currently active duty and 2 parents that are retired from the service but it also worries me that something like this could happen to a family member of mine as well. (That they end killed in action)",1419724800,,656,4.053846153846154
2931173,4,B000V6LSSQ,"Both of these movies have been a joy to watch for me since I first heard of them some years ago.  They have a lot in common:  they aren't comedies or romances.  They are serious movies, both about families that are having troubles since someone in the family died unexpectedly.  Both are Hallmark products and the skill associated with their movies shows through.
  In both cases, the family is visited by the spirit of the deceased and, in both cases, that helps them get back on track, to heal and go forward with their lives.  They are serious movies, but I don't find them too somber; no I find them interesting and, given the endings, heartwarming.
  Both of them enjoy good acting, look good on screen, and take place during the holiday season.
  Hallmark has had a long history of making good movies about serious topics and these both follow well in that tradition.  If you like that kind of movie, and don't mind something different from the usual Christmas romances and comedies, these may prove of interest to you.",1419465600,,1025,4.633333333333334
2931184,5,B000V6LSSQ,Great movie,1416787200,,11,5.0
2931185,5,B000V6LSSQ,"Loved both of these movies, saw them on the Hallmark Channel and knew I wanted them for my home collection....very heartwarming. Loved them both.........",1398988800,,153,5.416666666666667
2931186,5,B000V6LSSQ,This movie does an amazing job in revealing how a family consumed with grief for 10 years from losing their son in Desert Storm learns to reconnect with each other and with life by welcoming in this fantastic mysterious stranger on Christmas Eve night.,1387929600,,252,4.75
2931187,3,B000V6LSSQ,This is an excellent movie when seen on Hallmark Channel because it is close captioned. I have bought several movies I thought were close captioned because I saw them on the Hallmark Channel. When I received the DVDs they were neither close captioned nor subtitled. What a disappointment.,1385769600,,288,5.020833333333333
2931188,5,B000V6LSSQ,I found this to be a very nice story.  It might be a little too sad for some people. But for someone who has lost a loved one it might be very comforting. I've seen this shown on TV many times and thought it would be too sad but I'm glad I did buy and watch it.,1371945600,,261,3.5789473684210527
2931189,5,B000V6LSSQ,"Quite the holiday movie.  For anyone who want to watch a great holiday movie this should be on there list.  Warning - my the end of the movie you will have shed a few tears of joy and for sadness.  Great casting, acting , and scenery.  Wish tv had more sit coms about being  positive and supportive for family, friend and thy neighbor like this movie. If so this world would be a better place to live.",1367366400,,401,4.1558441558441555

2931192,5,B000V6LSSQ,very sweet movie but it does provoke tears.  you have to pay attention because the ending is what the movie is all about,1356048000,,120,4.217391304347826

2931205,5,B000V6LSSQ,"My husband and I both love the Christmas Vistor. We watched it on Hallmark once and could not catch it again. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon on such a good price. My husband is a veteran who served in the army for 23 years. So, this story really touches our hearts. I cry every time I watch it.
The Angel in the family is a wonderful story which my husband and I both love. My husband lost his mother 13 years ago and this movie reminds him just how much he misses her.",1326067200,6,474,3.9479166666666665
2931206,5,B000V6LSSQ,I was so glad to receive this movie. I saw it for the first time last year and it was such a touching story I had to find it to buy. This was my first time purchasing from Amazon and was delighted with the fast service and pricing. I recommend this movie highly.,1324857600,3,262,3.9622641509433962
2931207,5,B000V6LSSQ,"A Christmas Visitor takes you into the story. The acting is done very natural. It could be very sad for someone to watch around Christmas that has lost a loved one in combat which would already be having a hard time. It can also give hope for someone thinking they may have cancer or console someone who has lost a child or sibling in battle. I like it. The bonus movie, Angel in the family, is too far out there for me. I don't care for it, since it came as a bonus I'm not out anything.",1323993600,2,488,4.041237113402062
2931208,5,B000V6LSSQ,I've done seen the movie 4-5do-date times and loved it. I looked for it at all the other stores and finally found it at amazon. And the price on it was great. Thank you. I will be shopping there more.,1323302400,,200,4.025
2931209,5,B000V6LSSQ,Powerful and gripping movie that will leave you with a very lasting true meaning ot Christmas and family values. Worth watching over and over and over again!

2931210,5,B000V6LSSQ,"Not much to say about this movie other than it being great.  This has become a Christmas tradition to watch this movie every year.  This is one of those movies that is based on the story, and everything else second.  Enjoy!",1263686400,,223,4.390243902439025
2931211,5,B000V6LSSQ,"We absolutely loved the Christmas Visitor movie which we've viewed twice already.  Haven't watched the Angel one yet.  Very  touching and inspiring, gave one to all my kids to get out when they celebrate Christmas each year.  I highly recommend it.",1262822400,,248,4.975609756097561
2931212,5,B000V6LSSQ,"As a Christian and a person who believes in Angels and miracles...this video has two of my favorite stories.

A Chritmas Visitor is about a family who has lost a son in the war and was notified of his death on Christmas Eve...out of their grief, they no longer celebrate the spirit of Christmas.  A Christmas visitor restores their faith and brings back the spirit of Christmas to the family.

Having lost my Mom nearly seventeen years ago, I still grieve for her.  She was my best friend and always made the holidays so much fun.  Angel in the family renews my faith in angels and the fact that my Mom's spirit will always be with me.",1262822400,5,635,4.3931623931623935
2931213,5,B000V6LSSQ,This movie is excellent especially if you've lost a loved one.  It has made me feel much better even though nothing can replace a family member who has died.,1236384000,2,157,4.413793103448276

8216781,5,B000V6LSSQ,"One of our favorite Christmas Movies, ""A Christmas Visitor"", we watch it every year at Christmas!  A heartwarming story, Sad & Happy at the same time. Plus, we just like William Devane! This DVD happens to be a double feature with ""Angel in the Family"". It's okay. Won't make our annual Christmas List of movies, but it wasn't bad. Well worth the DVD though for ""A Christmas Visitor""!",1517270400,,384,4.647058823529412
