The bottom line on Sucker Punch is that it's dazzling at times but often drags at many other times.  I really enjoyed Zach Snyder's 300 and liked parts of Watchmen, and I knew from those films he could be counted on to provide a visually impressive motion picture.  However, this new film really only comes alive in the fantasy sequences.  What happens is that the title character, Baby Doll, is unjustly imprisoned in an insane asylum by an evil stepdad eager to get his hands on her late mom's riches.  It turns out the asylum has a profitable sideline going, a pleasure-for-hire business involving the nubile inmates/ dancers and run by one of the orderlies.  Or I guess that's a level of fantasy in itself, removed from the grubby reality of the actual asylum.  Within that ""private dancer"" / inmate fantasy, Baby Doll has her own fantasy world she retreats into while she's dancing.  In that world, Scott Glenn is a sensei / commander, and after an initial solo battle, Baby Doll is joined by her fellow hot inmates on three ""missions"" that will lead to their escape from the asylum in the higher fantasy plane.  (Yes, shades of Inception in the two layers of fantasy.) One battle involves a fight against steam-powered nazi undead (!), the 2nd against a dragon, and the final, futuristic one against shiny robots protecting a bomb.  The ""missions"" are each quite striking visually (although the first solo battle is only so-so), but the action REALLY DRAGS when events switch back to the asylum.  I found myself wishing the asylum scenes would be over quickly so we could get back to the ""missions.""  This movie is worth renting for the fantasy missions/ battles, but I wouldn't rush right out and see it in a theater.",1301011200,4,1741,4.690789473684211
4339915,3,B004EPYZU8,"Zack Snyder just hasn't made the same impact on me that he apparently has on the rest of the moviegoing population. I enjoy his work, but it always seems like there's something to be desired when his films finally fade to black. With Sucker Punch, Snyder isn't really looking to change the formula his films have become notorious for, but the storyline just didn't sit right with me. We know ahead of time that this is all taking place in Baby Doll's head? That's like knowing ahead of time that Teddy Daniels is patient 67 in Shutter Island. Oh wait, we kind of did and that still turned out pretty great. Sucker Punch is fairly disappointing on one hand, but mostly just incredibly entertaining on the other.

The Zack Snyder formula mentioned usually just involves heavy use of slow motion while most of his films have a particular look to them like they're all sent through the same filter before reaching the screen while also feeling like they all taking place in the same universe. Snyder became notorious for his R-Rated films, but then broke that mold with Legend of the Guardians. Sucker Punch is Snyder's first PG-13 film, so don't expect a lot of gratuitous gore, endless strings of profanity or graphic sex scenes on spaceships that last an incredibly long time since there's none of that. If you're a fan of any of Snyder's work, Sucker Punch still hits all the same buttons that films like 300 and Watchmen did; the action sequences are still insane and the slow motion technique is used in a way that adds a bit of gusto to each scene it's used in. When the girls first arrive on the train and they're in the middle of trying to retrieve a kitchen knife, a gun is fired as we see the bullet bounce off and shatter a robot's head. The shell then flies by the screen as we hear the air in the room howl through the shell before it falls to the ground. So if you're a doubter of the PG-13 rating, it doesn't really affect much here.

This film is like a man's action movie fantasy. It's like Sucker Punch tries to roll everything a guy would enjoy in a film like hot women, heavy gunfire, a mother dragon who basically makes explosions come to her, and enough insanity injected into its most adrenaline racing scenes to keep you talking around the water cooler for hours. It's like trying to combine Showgirls, the Dawn of the Dead remake, Dead Snow, The Lord of the Rings, and I, Robot into one movie. During that same train sequence, I could've sworn the score suddenly paid homage to Terminator 2. Sucker Punch makes sure to tickle all of the brain cells in your head that are still attached to action films from your past.

While the film's charm mostly comes from its action scenes and the films they pay tribute to, the flaws in Sucker Punch aren't exactly minimal. The main one being that the film's constant use of music with vocals makes Sucker Punch feel like the director's cut of an extended music video. There are three songs used practically in full in the first thirty to forty five minutes of the film among countless others as the film progresses. The film also takes place within two layers of the mind in addition to what's actually happening in reality, which makes the film feel like a less complicated version of Inception. The plan that Baby Doll comes up with seems a little too grandiose for its own good with such little payoff at times. Do you really have to dance to go to another reality where you're fighting robots on a train while trying to disarm a bomb before it explodes all for nothing more than a kitchen knife? It honestly just felt like a group of guys got together and threw all their favorite action movies into a pot and created a film with an amazing looking incoherent film before coming back around and adding a story to it to try and make everything have some sort of meaning.

At the end of the day, Sucker Punch is basically just a glorified music video with really spectacular eye candy. The film can also be considered a fanboy's wet dream. If you're a guy, Sucker Punch is practically guaranteed to at least touch upon at least one of the things you look for and love in an action film. Whether it's giant samurai warriors wielding Gatling guns, steam powered zombie soldiers, hideous orcs and fire breathing dragons, an overbearing clan of bloodthirsty robots, or the fact that you just like to watch scantily clad, young women annihilate their enemies with nothing more than a blade and an endless supply of bullets, Zack Snyder's latest probably has you covered. Sucker Punch may not be the best written film of the year, but it's an action film that can still be considered a hell of a lot of brainless fun.",1300924800,12,4675,4.528994082840237

4340190,4,B004EPYZU8,"Back when Blockbuster was the main place to go and rent movies/tv shows/video games, I remember spotting this movie among the rows and was immediately intrigued by the movie Sucker Punch. I added it to my rent two get the third free hoard and took it home with me. Once the movie began, I was mesmerized by the CGI (at least for its day), the world within world, and the soundtrack. The soundtrack blew me away so much so that I bought it and played it on repeat for days. The world within world within world of the actual reality of Baby Doll's life in the asylum world to the mobster club world to the kicking a$$ world of fighting. The fantasy world within fantasy world is to combat the reality of what is going on to escape from the horrid conditions that the girls are living in. The only disappointment that I have is that we never really get to see Baby Doll dance. So, coming back many years later since renting Sucker Punch and constantly being haunted by this movie I took the plunge to buy the digital movie here so that I can watch it again and again. I might end up buying the physical sometime later. If you are looking for a reality/fantasy world type Inception movie give this one a go.

After all those BIG disappointments lately (American Gods, The Mist, King Arthur, King Kong, The Wall, Lala Land etc. etc.) I more and more rewatch movies I like a lot. One of those ""new classics"" for me is Sucker Punch - a movie which promotes fighting girls (a year before Hunger Games and the inflation of men beating up girls and women hit the screen), it has stunning visuals and a story - if you care - that gives you a lot of material to think about, on top you get a certain tone of melancholia which is just superb.

Zack Snyder got at least three masterworks in his line: his version of the classic Dawn of the Dead, 300, and Sucker Punch - these movies beat easy everything Hollywood calls nowadays Blockbuster and tries to sell us - 2016 and till now 2017 are filled with disappointing bad or at most mediocre and certainly redundant outputs of the once called dream-factory: Hollywood needs to learn to dream again, and what I mean is not dreaming about making big easy cash with generic and bloodless products and big names, whose emptiness is disguised by the CGI-department (which is the only part of the filming industry that seems to make a - positive - progress). Not to forget all this primitive implemented liberal p.c.-schrott - how it is well done shows a movie like The Rocky Horror Picture Show from 1975.

But I guess nowadays the possession of a notebook and the will to spill one's mediocrity over the world is enough to meet the qualifications to get a job as a scriptwriter (besides the ""right"" left ""liberal"" state of ""mind"") - real imagination and skill are a very rare thing in these modern times. Sucker Punch belongs (imo) to the master league of modern fantastic and visionary movie-making: Matrix, Fight Club, Sin City, Pan's Labyrinth and a few other triumphant works of (more) recent years.",1503878400,,1870,4.643504531722054

4340504,5,B004EPYZU8,"I didn't care for this movie the first time I viewed it.  Like many others, I missed the point.  Years passed and I came across an interesting video on YouTube of a stunning synopsis of the true point of this movie, set to Emily Brown's rendition of Sweet Dreams, Then, Army of Me by Bjork.  This prompted me to take another look at the movie with fresh eyes and a curiosity to understand the film.  Put simply, this time I paid attention and went on the journey intended by this film.
Going into the film with that openness and focus, well, by the time the credits rolled, I was covered in goosebumps and teary eyed.
The true focus of this film is not Baby Doll, nor is it Sweet Pea...it's You and I--The Viewer :
"" Everyone has an angel, a guardian who watches over us. We cant know what form they will take, one day old man, the next day, little girl. But don't let appearances fool you. They can be as fierce as any dragon. Yet, they are not here to fight our battles. But to whisper from our heart. Reminding that its us, its everyone of us that holds the power of the worlds we create""------
 ""We can deny our angels exist, convince ourselves they cant be real. But they show up anyway, at strange places and at strange times. They can speak though any character we can imagine, theyll shout though demons if they have to. Daring us, challenging us to fight"".--------
-----""And finally, this question, the mystery of whose story it will be. Of who draws the curtain, who is it that chooses our steps in the dance. Who drives us mad, lashes us with whips and crowns us with victory when we survive the impossible. Who is it that does all these things?
Who honors those we love for the very life we live. Who sends monsters to kill us and at the same time sings that we will never die. Who teaches us what is real and how to laugh at lies. Who decides why we live and what we will die to defend. Who chains us and who holds the key that will set us free. Its YOU, you have all the weapons that you will need, NOW FIGHT!""

Snyder and Shibuya are all but daring us to stand up and fight for that which we believe in, in whatever worlds we inhabit.  Given the female slant to the cast, our 'hero' is female as is her counterpart, Sweet Pea, this is not just the 'wise man' calling to all of us to realize we already have all the weapons we need and to stand up and fight for what we believe is right...it is a battle cry for women to stop feeling helpless in their lives, to realize they are already hold within them all the strength they need to slay their personal dragons, to stand up and fight.

-Spoilers Ahead--

This movie approaches with 3 different interpretations of reality. I see these as the 3 layers some people function in to a lesser degree.

The first is the base lair, what is actually happening, this is babydoll in a mental hospital. Notice how she gets more glamorous as the stages progress.

The second is when she is in her ""reality"", the slave in some seedy underground nightclub

The third is her fantasy view of how things happened.

4341070,5,B004EPYZU8,"I have the extended cut. The extra footage doesn't really add value and agree with Snyder's own assessment that the upbeat music number ruins the tone and pacing. It's interesting though, to see that Babydoll fires twice at the beginning.

The movie, in general, is kind of an off-the-mark attempt at making a pro-feminist satire of the film industry's capitalization of sex and violence, so long as it's a ""clean"" PG-13.

Our ""heroine"", Babydoll, inadvertently kills her sister while fending off the advances of her widower stepfather. She's the only thing standing between an he and her inheritance. The death of the sister becomes the the excuse to put Babydoll in an asylum, with an extra bill slipped for services to be rendered at a later date. Here, Babydoll has become a victim of patriarchy as men conspire to restrain Babydoll from outing their selfish machinations.

From this, we progress to the shared fantasy of multiple women inside the asylum. In these dreamscapes, to escape the gentleman's club, our main cast flee to a Gentleman's club, where each is a prized star and featured dancer. Even in their own head, each of these very well made women are a man's fantasy and little else. Knowing they are in a prison of sorts, they conspire escape. Babydoll demonstrates clear proficiency with erotic dancing, losing herself in the moments and whisking us away to another layer of stylized, bloodless over-the-top action fantasy...

Here's what's of note: We can sexualize women, so long as we don't actually show women's sexuality. Women can be strong, so long as it's in a visually appealing package. We can show violence, gratuitous and copious amounts of it, and so long as no one gets hurt it's all good. Instead of seeing Babydoll at her undulating finest, we see non-sequitur violence set to the soundtracks of the dance. We're watching, at minimum, a critique of agencies like the MPAA, and perhaps our culture's skewed criteria for what is acceptable.

There will be a point to contrast later in the film when a main cast member dies. It will be sudden, shocking, sexist, and with zero fan are. But as this happens to the periphery, it's still perfectly PG-13. Take note.

Does all of this work? You'll have to decide for yourself. Consensus seems to be ""no."" Ultimately, I think I agree. The movie seems to lose itself in the sexualization of our main cast. The film comes across as just the pageantry of anime inspired girls looking hot while doing random things. Even though I see what the director was trying to do, it's only after careful thought and not because he had the skill to convey it well.

""And one more thing...""

The title is apt. I saw this in theatres back when, and I felt like I had been sucker punched by the deus ex machina-esque ending.",1488240000,,2782,4.769230769230769

Movie Quick Review:
Love this movie. It's a visually spectacular film, filled with superbly shot and choreographed anime/video game-inspired action fight scenes in steampunk themed fantasy worlds. Great soundtrack, with a strong music video vibe throughout the whole movie. On a deeper level, the film explores dark themes, such as coping with abuse through fantasy and imagination - a very unconventional theme and story, for sure. Good job, Zack Snyder; you're a genius.

Extended Cut
The Theatrical and Extended Cuts are both included in this set, on separate discs. Extended Cut mostly adds in additional action moments, most notably a fantasy castle siege battle sequence against orcs. Also, there's a ""music video"" sequence, featuring singing and dancing by Oscar Isaac & Carla Gugino, and shots of all the girls performing on stage in elaborate costumes. In the theatrical cut, you only saw glimpses of this segment during the credits. I really love this sequence, so I don't understand why this wasn't included in the Theatrical Cut.

But the Theatrical Cut isn't entirely surpassed though. I actually think the movie worked better without one of the added scenes in the Extended Cut. It's a scene featuring Emily Browning and Jon Hamm added near the end of the movie that changes the dynamic of how the story ends, so I felt the movie actually works better when we don't see this scene.

Special Features:
The features on the Blu-Ray are unfortunately fairly limited, because there are so few of them. There's one very good feature, the Maximum Movie Mode (more on that below). There's a very short featurette on the music of the film. And there are some animated shorts inspired by the fantasy dream sequences in the movie. They are short stories taking place in the world of the fantasies in the movie, but have little connection to the movie itself. Nothing too outstanding, but not gonna complain that they're included on the disc.

The highlight of the special features included on this Blu-Ray is the ""Maximum Movie Mode."" This is a special mode that Warner Bros does for many of its Blu-Rays, including this one. It's like an audio commentary, but better, because it merges video featurettes into the movie watching experience. You'll hear director Zack-Snyder talking about the movie the whole time, but you'll also see segments where he walks on screen to describe the making of the scene. Simple audio commentary tracks on other movies seem lazy compared to this mode.

But one complaint I have is that the features in the Maximum Movie Mode can't be accessed except through this mode. They could have easily allowed us to access the features such as the image galleries directly, instead of only through the Maximum Movie Mode. In fact, this option is possible on other WarnerBros/Zack Snyder Blu-Rays I've watched, such as Man of Steel and Watchmen, so I don't know why they didn't allow us to do that for the Sucker Punch Blu-Ray.

Summary:
Great movie. Blu-Ray unfortunately has too few special features to be too satisfying, but the few that we got, notably the Maximum Movie Mode, are great.",1474675200,4,3195,4.949626865671642

4341888,3,B004EPYZU8,"I'll come right out and say it...  I enjoyed Sucker Punch.

Is it a ""great"" movie?...  Nope.  But even though this oft maligned offering from director Zack Snyder is almost universally panned by critics and fans alike, I believe that there's more here than meets the eye.

First of all, there's no denying that Zack Snyder makes some visually stunning movies.  Look no further than 'The 300' and 'Watchmen' for proof of that.  As a director, Snyder is extremely adept at creating moments that catch the eye and stick in your head, and Sucker Punch is no exception.  The movie features an attractive cast in a variety of interesting situations where they get into a full on Chuck Norris meets Rambo mode, and the fight scenes are as good as anything Snyder has ever done.  Where Snyder is weakest however, is in his ability to develop compelling characters and to weave stories that engage the audience.  Well...  that, and an over dependence on grey filters, but I digress.

On the surface, the plot of this movie is a hot and confusing mess, but if you dig below the surface(s) of the storylines, it becomes a little easier to understand what's REALLY going on.

WARNING:  SPOILERS AHEAD >>

The first thing you need to better understand this movie is my 10 cent psychoanalysis of Zack Snyder, himself.  He's a talented director, but if you ask me, he's getting caught up in a non-declared competition with Christopher Nolan.  Hear me out on this...  Nolan makes highly celebrated Batman/Dark Knight movie series...  then Snyder tries to recreate the dark, gritty feel of those movies in Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, etc.  I believe that Sucker Punch is actually Snyder's attempt to out-inception 'Inception', with a wild ""what the heck is going on...  is this real or is just imagination?"" plot.

On the surface, Sucker Punch is the story of a 20 year old girl named Baby Doll (Emily Browning), whose mother dies, or is murdered by her evil stepfather, who flies into a wild rage when Baby Doll's mother leaves her entire fortune to her two daughters (Baby Doll and her younger sister).  While trying to protect her little sister from being attacked by their step father, Baby Doll pulls a gun on him and accidentally shoots and kills her little sister.  Her step father then has Baby Doll committed to the local insane asylum, where he cuts a side deal with Blue (played by Oscar Isaac) to have her lobotomized by a traveling doctor in order to cover up his crimes.

Blue takes the duo into a common area at the asylum, which is set up like a theater and where the staff psychologist, Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) has her patients act out the traumatic events that caused their psychoses.  It's here where we meet Sweet Pea (the self proclaimed main attraction, played by Abby Cornish), Amber (Jamie Chung), Rocket (Sweet Pea's little sister, played by Jenna Malone), and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens).  At the time they enter the theater, Sweet Pea is on stage with Dr. Gorski, sitting on a bed in a manner that is very reminiscent of how we see Baby Doll at the beginning of the movie.

When Rocket takes baby Doll on a tour of the facility, alternate realities begin to creep into the story, as the asylum suddenly becomes a brothel that is run by Blue, and the girls entertain clients.  Most people confuse the brothel as a fantasy that allows Baby Doll to escape from her reality, but I don't agree.  I believe the brothel is not an escape, but a manifestation of how the men in the facility make her feel (like a piece of meat).  LONG STORY SHORT >> This is just one of many worlds created within the framework of Sucker Punch, as in their role as prostitutes, each girl is supposed to learn and perform her own special dance, but each time Baby Doll dances, aside from her first few gyrating motions, we never see her actual performance.  Instead, we see her in a variety of scenarios which parallel her quest for items in the real world, and she and the other girls get downright Ninja in their quest to acquire 4 items that will help them escape the asylum before the 'High Roller' (in the world of the brothel, he's a guy who is coming to claim Baby Doll's virginity...  In the ""Real"" world, he's the doctor who will perform her lobotomy) arrives in a few days.

NOW... TO UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE, THIS IS WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW >>

Except for Sweet Pea, none of the girls are real, including Baby Doll.  She, Amber and Blondie represent aspects of Sweet Pea's personality, and exist only in her own mind.  In my opinion, Baby Doll represents Sweet Pea's courageous side.  This is shown throughout the movie as it is Baby Doll who comes up with the plan to escape the asylum, and it is baby doll who steps in for Sweet Pea in situations where she is uncomfortable.  For instance...  The dance (which is a metaphor for something that Sweet Pea is forced to do in the real world that makes her uneasy...  but at this point, the Baby Doll aspect of her personality takes over and performs.  The real escape occurs here, because instead of imagining the Baby Doll side of her personality enduring ""the dance"", Sweet Pea imagines different, exotic storylines that allow her to ignore the ugliness of her reality.

As for Rocket, well...  Sweet Pea has brought her sister to the asylum with her (so to speak)...  This is Sweet Pea's story.  It is she who killed her own sister and it is she who is desperately trying to deal with the guilt of that incident.  In fact, at several points in the movie, you will see Rocket in situations where she is pinned down by different villains (reminiscent of how her stepfather pinned her down in the beginning of the movie), only to be rescued by Baby Doll or Sweet Pea.  Is she fantasizing a different reality where she saves her sister instead of accidentally killing her?

I won't divulge any further spoilers, because I think you get the idea at this point.  That, and no matter how much you tear it apart, this story needs some work.  But on the whole, Sucker Punch is a visually stunning flick with hot ninja girls and cool tunes...  You can either turn off your brain and appreciate it for what it is on the surface, or you can dig deeper and see if I'm on the right track or not.  The choice is yours...",1473811200,4,6258,4.550983899821109

""Everyone has an angel. A guardian who watches over us.' -Sweet Pea

Four and a half ADVENTUROUS Stars. It's really the audience that is 'sucker punched' by this movie, because within the outside drama concerning a young girl who is framed for a crime and committed to the unusual Lennox House for the Mentally Insane, she enters a wild 'action movie' component with some mind-blowing CGI and 'wire fu' action by the actors. Truly amazing visages. Starring Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Jamie Chung, Vanessa Hudgens, Oscar Isaac, Jon Hamm, with the great Scott Glenn as the guru and Carla Gugino as the teacher. An enjoyable 'escapist' movie about escaping, with a twist. Directed by Zack Snyder. Highly Recommended. Four and a half DECEPTIVE Stars. (Warner Bros. pictures. Rated PG-13. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray.

He would have been right at home making films in the silent era of Hollywood, making movies unburdened by words. Sucker Punch is truly a silent film that just so happens to have a script. Much of the story is told through visual language and masterful camera work, and once you accept that Sucker Punch really clicks. Of course there are beautiful women swings swords and shooting guns at all manner of fantastical enemies, but if choose to dig a little deeper, there lies quite a wonderfully tragic allegory for death, insanity, and redemption.

It's one of those that just tears you apart from the beginning to the end and you wish you could get in there and take out the bad guys yourself.

4343139,4,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker punch is an amazing movie rarely in this era of sequels, remakes, and reboots do we get anything as sophisticated or as insane as Zack Snyder's satire on the way we perceive women and of geek culture. I have seen this movie now 4 times and it really gets better on every viewing which is something that all of Zacks movies have in common. Many critics panned this movie when it was released saying it was juvenile and sexiest which is a complete lie. Zacks wife Deborah would have divorced him in a heart beat if that's what was going on and the actresses would have said though. In fact watching the movie their are no times where the camera lingers or gawkes at these ladies unlike in a Michael Bay film it's all handled in a very mature way and it takes every moment it can to show these sexy ladies being complete bad asses, come on when Babydoll is fighting the samurai with her katana is awesome. Jena Malone and Abbie Cornish though stand out the most grounding the film and being the heart of the story and I really want them to team up with Zack again and if your an Oscar Issac fan watch this movie especially the extended cut where a seen is reinserted to show off his vocal skills which are incredible. The action is some of Snyder's most visually stunning work integrating cgi and practical effects seamlessly except one or two shots but that nitpicking. In the end though it's the brains not the brawn that make it fantastic looking at the different decades of feminism to see how far women have come and how geek culture sees women in those action scenes. In the end the critics got it wrong and Sucker punch is an incredible movie that deserves your attention and if this review doesn't convince you then watch videos or read articles on it but if you have to get a version of this movie get the blu ray which is the best way to watch it. Hopefully in ten or twenty years Sucker punch will get its due as the most underrated and misunderstood movie of the decade besides Batman v Superman which if have not seen go watch one of the best comic book movies out their for the critics got it wrong and it is an amazing movie that I will review later.

Truly, the men (all but one) in this movie are vile creatures, but the women (girls, really, for the most part) are stylized to within an inch of their lives, dressed to give men boners, captives in an asylum / brothel.  The women do bond and form a sisterhood, working to escape, engineering this escape with help of a David Carradine like character who provides guidance in their fantasy worlds and who eventually manifests in the real world to provide cover one last time to the one who manages to get out.

Visually, the movie is great eye candy, with a dark, sour color palette, powerful CGI and terrific music.  It is fun to see the girls kick ass and get one (or more!) over on the creepy dudes, but ultimately, it is disturbing because it does so starkly portray the power struggle between men and women.  In the end, the message is about teamwork, but it does not give us much hope that we might bridge any gap between the sexes.",1457740800,8,1010,4.437837837837838
4343311,5,B004EPYZU8,"(content warning, for both review and film: discussion of rape and medical abuse)

This is a massively underrated film which was ill-served by two things: first, the marketing, which failed to prepare viewers for a movie which was fundamentally about the abuse and oppression of women; but second, incredibly sexist reviewers whose gender essentialism failed to acknowledge the movie's themes. The film, for those who aren't clear, is about a young girl imprisoned in an asylum by her abusive father to cover up her sister's abuse and murder. She develops multiple layers of fantasy to deal with her condition, one of which reimagines the (mostly implied) sexual violence to which she's subjected as coerced sex work, and a deeper layer which is a science fiction/action fantasy. The sexism I'm referring to in the reviews focuses on the idea that the fantasy layer is ""a teenage boy's fantasy,"" which is ridiculously dismissive of the diversity of women and how women deal with trauma.

Was the film poorly marketed? Yes, it should have been made clear the audiences were in for a film with a great deal of rape and a downer ending. Do I think that the film's themes ultimately work? Yes, absolutely. The film depicts someone's attempt to escape the horrors of very real violence that's been visited on women, and it uses fantasy to deal with that. Other films that have done similar things include Pan's Labyrinth and pretty much the entire filmic career of Christopher Nolan (but his stories are about manly men and their traumas).

It's not a _fun_ movie. It is, I believe, a deeply affecting and moving movie that has a lot to say about trauma. The absolutely haunting soundtrack helps a lot here, too.",1457395200,61,1707,4.879310344827586

I love Zack Snyder because he always produces dazzling eye candy in his films. Caravaggio styling from classical art, marrying present day cinema, giving birth to an epic narrative to produce a family of beautiful warriors.

Sucker punch is gorgeous cinematography and I'm Zack Snyder's bi-atch.

This film is a girlpowa action adventure that most feminists will deeply hate. I mean what is empowering about crazy girls/strippers trying to escape the reality of their cruel repressed lives through surreal imagination? Well it could be that its allowing them to fight their demons and reach one another in a commonality that sets their souls free. I read an incredible quote just before watching this movie that says that feminism isn't fighting against the ideals of a patriarchal society, it's fighting for women to know that they have a choices in everyone's society. So before someone starts waving their subjugation flag realize that this is an incredible movie for saying that the fight for many marginalized people is real and not to play dead for anyone. And fighting is making a choice when you have none.

/end of my politico soapbox speech.

Emily Browning is freaking gorgeous and I always watch Lemony Snicket after this to see where she has come from. The choreography for the fighting is spectacular; Emily and is lithe as all get out. Jena Malone is as kick butt in Sucker Punch as she is in Hunger Games--although I like her playing insane tribute more so than the idealistic younger sister in this movie. I often wonder if Donnie Darko approves of how Ms. Malone has had her come-up in Hollywood. She seems to play a whole lot of deranged peeps.

My favorite is Oscar Isaac in his scary portrayal of club owner Blue Jones. Some of the moments where he is menacing Dr. Gorski, Blondie and Sweet Pea are shockingly powerful in expression. His sinister aspect is almost palpable when he is in his victim's faces, chillingly so. Its all about the eyes and invasion of personal space--I think Oscar would make a frightening gangster boss--crazy eyes and all. Sucker Punch is where he flew onto my radar and he fascinates me still. Not to mention that spicy duet of Bryan Ferrys Love is the Drug with Carla Gugino on the soundtrack.

And if Zack Snyder's vision, Oscar Isaacs villainy, Steve Shibuya's screenwriting, and the soundtrack--which is beyond amazing, isn't enough than we have the icing on the cake. John Hamm steps in as the big roller/lobotomist making this movie killer. He has all of two minutes of screentime but hes like a good scotch and it doesnt take a lot to heat me up.

 Who honors those we love for the very life we live? Who sends monsters to kill us, and at the same time sings that we will never die? Who teaches us what's real and how to laugh at lies? Who decides why we live and what we'll die to defend? Who chains us? And who holds the key that can set us free... It's you. You have all the weapons you need. Now fight!",1451692800,4,3246,4.621527777777778

4344186,3,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch
 Sucker Punch has a number of serious faults but no one would put a lack of ambition among.  This movie is built on a grand, or grandiose if you like, conception.  But like the mighty Casey, at the end of the day all that is achieved is a strike out.  We can call it a huge, disturbing, visually dazzling action packed strike out if we want to but it does not change the end result.
 Writer/director/producer Zach Snyder certainly aimed for the bleachers in this film, hoping to add to his success with Watchmen and 300.  His overall design is something that is very rarely achievable in film.  He hoped to produce a story within a dream within a dream.  This is very ambitious and turns out to be beyond his reach.
 Twenty three year old Australian actress Emily Browning plays a helpless young girl in the clutches of her evil stepfather-really evil, a disgusting, vile monster.  He places her in a private mental institution in order to get her inheritance.  He also bribes an orderly to have the victim lobotomized (the movie is set in the 1950s when such things were done.)  The bulk of the film is fantasy sequences in a created world inside the head of the helpless girl.
 The Browning character is supposed to be such a compelling dancer (erotic style) that men cannot resist watching her.  This is a pivotal point, she distracts the men while her comrades work on an escape attempt.  The viewer never sees her dance-this is cheating.  We become involved in the escape attempt only to find out it is all make believe.  The helpless young girl spoiler alertis actually lobotomized at the end.  What tiny bit of empathy we have managed to build up for the victim, who is as cartoonish and as unreal as her hallucinations, is wasted.
 The film finishes up with a hallucinatory guru who has helped the victim in her imaginary adventures appearing in the flesh, miles from the hospital, in a venue that the girl could never have entered.  This also is cheating.
 We are left with a bad taste in our mouth, feeling let down by the producers.  After sitting through two hours of entertaining episodes of attractive young women in fishnet stockings battling robots, orcs, Chinese demigods and Zombies, we are left with nothing.  The entire enterprise is a trick, a fake and an icky one at that.  If you enter this theater, prepare for disappointment.
 The PG-13 Sucker Punch lasts a full two hours.  It brought in a respectable $19 million on the opening weekend.  I doubt if the $82 million Zach Snyder spent on making this ambitious but badly flawed, unsatisfying film will ever be fully recovered.  We can offer only two  and a half saw blades for Sucker Punch.",1442880000,,2677,4.624203821656051

Also, there is something to be said about having a strong plot, and the fact of the matter is that this movie does not have one. There's absolutely no rhyme or reason between the protagonists fantasies and whatever was going on in the real world of the film. By the end, I was just like 'Uh what?' As a big fan of LOTR, I also kind of resented the Orc ""posers"" that appeared in this movie. Along with the orcs, nazi zombies, samurai monsters, and robots all made an appearance in the protagonist's fantasy within her fantasy world - if you can follow that.

4346097,5,B004EPYZU8,"Seon Buddhist Monk Woncheol once said Myth is not just an event of long ago. Rather, myth is another reality, one that we are facing right now. It is our everyday life. By realizing this and treating myth in this way, we are serving its true purpose. Snyder's ""Sucker Punch"" is an attempt to take that concept of myth and apply it to a horrifically dark situation. People every day find themselves stuck under the thumbs of others and trapped in unresolvable situations. Through myth, we can escape, fight back, find our own strength and even, when the time comes, accept our fate. This movie is a beautiful ballet that tells a story so primal to the human experience that many missed its depth. I highly recommend it!",1424217600,4,718,4.6171875
4346098,2,B004EPYZU8,"Known for his heroic superhero films such as Watchmen, Man of Steel, and the 300 movies, director Zack Snyder flies dead south with Sucker Punch produced in 2011. Aside from cheesy special effects screwed into your brain, the film has poor plot development as well as an utter lack of cohesion. A literal sucker punch to the face would be less dreadful than watching the full two hours of garbage.

The movie starts off with eight minutes of an over dramatic symphony of music telling the story of how a young girl nicknamed Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is locked away in an insane asylum by her abusive stepfather. After eight minutes the story continues to unfold through actual words and Baby Doll is to have a lobotomy within five days. However, in this time she participates in the asylums money making prostitution shows. While owner Blue (Oscar Isaac) thinks he can bang a couple bucks off of his new star, he is proven wrong by Baby Dolls havoc plan to escape with the help of the other girls.

However, Zack Snyder has to go big or go home so he takes this basic plot scheme and thinks of this genius idea of making her dancing an action packed metaphor for her to escape in reality. This is where it all goes wrong.

You never actually see Baby Doll dance or how the girls collect the items needed to escape, just the symbolic fighting scenes. In her first trance Baby Doll is fighting in a Mesopotamian ancient temple against giant armored figures that magically got their hands on some heavy-duty machine guns. Sure, everyone likes guns so why not right? Well in her next trance she is now fighting the Germans in trenches whom all of which are wearing gas masks.  The plot has no progression because it has no realistic foundation. The plot merely jumps around and attempts to fill the gaps with clichd slow motion gunshots and spin moves by the girls fighting, which is another point to bring up. The entire movie is exploitative to its actresses through the prostitution gimmick and sexy schoolgirl outfits worn during battle. The only female adult roll is the dance teacher, and even she is always found with low V, scandalous outfits.

Since the movie has no highly known actors, it relies heavily on the storyline, which results in the failure of the film. There is too much being thrown at the viewer that the targeted audience is unclear and while the production design may be impressive to some extent in itself, it is over the top in context and causes jumbled overstimulation. The actors do their job, but only to the mercy of the disappointing script and Zack Snyders mistaken idea on how to make a fantasy thriller.

While the plot is undeniably original and creative on the next level, a less original movie about a not so crazy girl trying to escape a mental institution would have been more successful. Not every new idea is a good idea when it comes to movies; Zack Snyder should stick to remakes of comics rather than his own ideas clearly outside his expertise.",1424131200,,2990,4.632075471698113

4346304,4,B004EPYZU8,"This is a movie that's definitely not for everyone. It's an action adventure film based on the premise that a girl is about to either be sold in to sexual slavery or have a lobotomy. Truth is, it's none of those things and all of it, from the opening frame forward is a fantasy, an act. This is a movie made by an auteur, a film maker who wanted to have absolute control over every single shot, every single moment. He titillates the audience with beautiful girls, excites the audience with video game and anime inspired visuals and upsets them with a subject matter that's far too dark for a movie of this type... but that's kind of what makes it great.

Some will say the women in this film are role models for female empowerment. They're taking control of their sexuality and their femininity while also being bad ass super heroes. That's a fair point. But after a repeat viewing it's so very clearly about escapism.

Now I'm not saying this is a great movie. What I am saying is that this is the movie the director wanted to make. He used the hollywood system to make something so outlandish and ridiculous that at the end you can't help but look at your friends and say ""how the **** did this get made?""",1422835200,2,1208,4.388392857142857

4346311,1,B004EPYZU8,"This film succeeded on the level of T&A and special effects.  Jenna Malone and Scott Glenn did nice work as per usual.

On EVERY other level, I found the film to be a depressive and depressing failure.  It supposedly deals with big questions (as we are told in a muddy soliloquy at the end), but the message of the film itself is that we're screwed and have no hope of escaping the worst.

A mob-connected(?) criminal sexual psychopath either owns or effectively runs an asylum-for-hire.  The medical director, supposedly a qualified psychiatrist, nevertheless has no safeguards in place to prevent the virtual murder of her patients (lobotomy amounted to virtual murder, which is why it's no longer an ethical procedure and never should have been), apparently can't recognise that her employer(?) is a criminal sexual psychopath, and uncritically accepts claims of disturbed behavior in young women who behave unexceptionally while under her ""care"".  The cops show up to arrest the psychopath after it's too late, so apparently the psychiatrist was at least oriented enough to notice that he murdered two of her patients in her presence!.

(Bret Fetzer's opinion for Amazon notwithstanding, ""Baby Doll"" was not schizoid.  She was a normal young woman falsely imprisoned and doing her best to escape)",1421539200,,1300,5.127962085308057

It left me in tears.
Had to have my own copy.
To me: there was nothing literal about it.
It was the fantasies an exotic dancer/stripper;
Or an ordinary woman in bed with a man she feels trapped into the relationship with:
Loses themselves in.
During the dancing for tips.
During the sex.
You are anywhere but there.
I didn't take any of the attacks nor deaths in the movie literally.
To me they were just representing men believe the woman in getting turned on by the dance. The sex. Meanwhile in the woman's mind it might as well be an attack; a death. She is not even ""There.""

The story is about a young woman named baby doll who's stepfather has her committed to an asylum and wants her lobotomized so she won't remember that her her mother left her and her sister all her money in her will and just before he committs her he tries to kill er and her sister he has a gun tries to kill them baby doll tries to get the gun away from him in a struggle her sister is killed, then he drugs babydoll and she is brought the asylum and pays people to give her a lobotomy, her stepfather is a creep I hate him, anyway while babydoll is there she meets four women who help her try to escape the asylum but while th sere baby doll images a world different there her own where they fight dragons and so forth I don't won't to reveal anymore or else I'll give everything away but it is a good way to spend 2 hrs and 7 particulay the R rated cut of this movie which is better than the PG-13 version it has more songs and a longer scene near the end. Sucker punch stars my favorite actress Emily browning, vanessa hudgens, Jena Malone, Abby Cornish, Scott Glenn one of my favorite actors he is great on the h.b.o. who the leftovers one of the best shows on TV and many other actors star in this wonderful movie, I highly recommend it this is one of my favorite movies.",1408924800,2,1382,4.065934065934066

4347705,5,B004EPYZU8,"""Everyone has an angel, a guardian who watches over us...we can't know what form they'll take...one day old man, next day little girl.
But don't let appearances fool you...they can be as fierce as any dragon. Yet, they're not here to fight our battle,
but to whisper from our heart...reminding that it's us...it's every one of us who holds the power over the worlds we create.""

We can deny our angels exist...convince ourselves they can't be real, but they show up anyway, at strange places and at strange times.
They can speak through any character we can imagine. They'll shout through demons if they have to...daring us...challenging us to fight.""

""You know...for those who fight for it...life has a flavor the sheltered will never know.""

""...and finally, this question...the mystery of who's story it will be...of who draws the curtain. Who is it that chooses our steps in the dance?
Who drives us mad? Lashes us with whips and crowns us with victory when we survive the impossible. Who is it that does all these things?
Who honors those we love with the very life we live? Who sends monsters to kill us and at the same time sings that we will never die?
Who teaches us what's real and how to laugh at lies? Who decides what we live and what we'll die to defend?
Who chains us and who holds the key that can set us free?...it's you.
You have all the weapons you need...NOW FIGHT.""

This is a story about hope against all hope...about your choice to stand and fight for your life or be another faceless and forgotten victim.

I think, sadly that so much of our lives have been so saturated with so much form without any real substance, that when a movie like SUCKER PUNCH comes out,
which elevates both form and substance together into something uplifting and inspirational,
most only see the form without any substance they have been abused with and cannot see the movie for what it really is...a masterpiece of inspiration.

Do you see it?...do you see all the weapons you already have?...THEN FIGHT!!!

SUCKER PUNCH...for those that fight for it

4347962,4,B004EPYZU8,"I had a lot of reservations going in to this film, but put it in the Blu-ray player.  The color pallet reminded me a bit of Sin City, sort of a dark, brooding, ""old"" feel of a period piece in the late 50's or early 60's.  I really liked the old car in the early scenes so I continued to view it.  They dispense with the story introduction fairly early, and the star girl plunges into a savage battle with some huge samurai warriors.  Suddenly I was grabbed viscerally and i accepted the fantasy environment.  The movie proceeds through fantasies which were totally fantastic.  From WWI era airships and tri-wing fliers, ""steam"" powered robots, dragons, and an awesome spacescape with Saturn in the background replete with I-Robot style robots on a train. I thoroughly enjoyed the artistic work and basically ignored trying to find out what was really going on.

4347965,5,B004EPYZU8,"Now here's a movie I bought because of Emily Browning... who is SUPER hot. I expected to see Emily in tight clothes, kicking ass, which this movie certainly delivered. What I didn't expect was an intriguing story delivered in a very clever way. This movie is disguised as a chicksploitation flick but is actually a pretty high concept story about a young woman (Emily) who accidentally kills her little sister while trying to protect her from her sleazebag (step?)father's sexual abuse. In order to cover his own crimes, he decides to lock her away in a mental asylum run by a crooked guard who promises to fix her for good. That's where the story gets interesting. Baby (Emily) and her inmate friends hatch a plan to escape by securing a key, a knife, a map, and a lighter, all of which are secured through Baby's hypnotizing dancing. What I found cool was the way each item was secured through a metaphor-laced mini story, each rife with plenty of hot-chick-in-tight-clothes-kicking-ass action.

4348363,5,B004EPYZU8,"I saw this movie in theaters and came out less than impressed. It was very disjointed and just didn't impress. Why did I buy the bluray? Honestly I have no idea other than it was super cheap on a Black Friday and sale and boy am I glad that I got the extended version as it makes the movie so much better!

The bluray quality is amazing during the fight scenes. The picture quality is very clear to see in the first fight scene alone. The blend of the cool, dreary winter exterior scenes mixed with the warm interior firelight (and fiery explosions!) is stark and captivating. The action pops off the screen and really draws your eye to all the subtle details you'd normally dismiss or ignore like the wooden support beams splintering with the bullet impacts of the sinister red glow of the samurai eyes. The fire effects look so real you'd almost think they literally blew up a building instead of the heavy green screening they used. That's just one example.

The sound is so much beefier on the bluray I sometimes wonder if I even watched the same movie in the theater. The extended song and dance number with Carla Gugino & Oscar Isaac is so well done I found myself wishing they'd have left it in for the theatrical version. And I'm very much NOT a musical person, but there was no way you can sit and listen to that number and not be sucked into it. Along with the added visuals, which they stupidly omitted to keep the run time in check, the viewer misses out on a lot.

If you have any interest in this movie at all, pick up this extended version. It's down to a good price now and well worth the money. The animated shorts are ok and are on every other version as well.",1401494400,,1678,4.32063492063492
4348364,5,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch isn't your typical movie. Honestly, I probably never would've watched it, but because Emily Browning is my favourite actress, I have decided to watch all of her films. Now, I didn't purchase this on Amazon, so therefore, I can't say anything about shipping, but aside from that, I believe I can give this a decent review.

THE STORY
On the outside, Sucker Punch seems like if High School of the Dead met Metal Gear Solid, however, it is much more than that. Sucker Punch follows a group of girls, the main characters being Babydoll and Sweet Pea, who are trying to escape a place that is more like a prison to them. Babydoll creates a plan for the girls to escape. Through their struggle to obtain what it is they need, Babydoll escapes from her reality to a fantasy world where she and the girls are warriors attempting to obtain the items needed to escape. If that sounds at all complicated, this may not be the film for you. You definitely need to pay attention. With that aside, the film isn't just your average action film, but also a psychological story. I'm not saying that it is anything like Perfect Blue or Black Swan type of psychological drama, but it's still a well thought out story, and it's one worth watching.

Now, I purchased the Blu-Ray for two reasons. One, it was the only version at the store, and two, it included the extended (R-rated) version. The extended version is exclusive to the Blu-Ray release and this two disc set is not Blu-Ray/DVD combo. I can't say what is different about the extended version and the theatrical, because I've ONLY watched the extended version. I can say, however, that (the extended version, at least) is NOT kid appropriate. It's R rating is well deserved. While there are no sex scenes, nudity, or F-bombs, it does contain many adult, sexual situation, plenty of violence, scantily clad girls with too much makeup, and lots of suggestive dialog. With that said, I'd say the extended version is more suitable for audiences ages fifteen and up. The theatrical version is PG-13, though, so perhaps that one is more suitable for (slightly) younger audiences.

PACKAGING
Because I do not have the DVD release, I can't say much about that, but I can discuss the Blu-Ray one, and oh do I have some complaints... To start off, unlike the release for other Blu-Ray's, such as Brave 3D or Psycho-Pass, this case was a cheaply made piece of recycled junk. I prefer the recycled DVD cases to this one (and I hate those). Also, it had not one, but TWO of those awful, tree-hugger punch-outs (those stupid recycle symbol cutouts) on both sides of the case, making the paper cover artwork more vulnerable to tearing.

All in all, I thought it was a great movie, however, it most certainly isn't for everyone. My only real complaint with it, was that it had an awful case. If you're a fan of action movies or psychological dramas, this one is probably for you. It's definitely very unique and creative.",1401148800,2,2957,4.659003831417625

4348468,2,B004EPYZU8,"The film has plenty of pretty girls, skimpy outfits, great action sequences and yet it doesn't have any substance to it. There's nothing to really connect it all so it just seems random and slapped together. Usually when a movie comes out like this people try to put some deeper meaning to it and run to the usual ""you just didn't get it"" statements. This is an action movie that didn't make any sense and has the dialogue of a Sunday newspaper comic strip. If it weren't for all the pretty girls wearing skimpy outfits I'd have probably looked for another movie to watch. I just wish this movie had more to it than really just being a series of adolescent day dreams. Maybe a spoiler here *The main character Babydoll gets lobotomized and the twist is that she willingly accepts it.* Probably to forget about her mother dying, her sister being killed, and her step father screwing her over by dumping her in a mental institution so he can claim the mothers estate and assets.

Not a very happy movie and not one that makes itself very clear. In the real world the girls at the mental institution are being sexually abused by the character Blue. The story is about them trying to escape Blue and the institution. Zack Snyder has made some movies I loved like 300 and some movies I couldn't stand and highly hated like ""Watchmen"". Sucker Punch just seemed like an expensive experiment. The is no real reason to the movie because it barely has an actual story. It's like someone clumped together cut sequences from a bunch of video games and merged them into one movie. It would have been more interesting if we transferred from Baby doll's fantasy world into the real world instead of a fantasy within a fantasy nonsense.

I give this film 2/5 for having atleast 2 things I like. Hot women in skimpy outfits and action.",1398384000,5,1818,4.556574923547401

I do get the hatred toward it. It's natural considering it sells itself as one thing but is really something else entirely. I wish more people were talking about this. I can see it becoming a cult classic where, ten years from now, people will be really examining it and talking about it as something important.

4348795,5,B004EPYZU8,"I think the fact that I'm a psychology major lent me a different perspective than the reviews that I read prior to my ever seeing the movie.  I'm glad I endeavored to watch it despite the bad press.  Emily Browning who's stepfather kills her mother for her money finds that she's willed him out.  He turns to her daughters with the intention of apparently exploiting them.  She accidentally shoots her sister and he then throws her into an insane asylum.

Asylum turned brothel with an evil orderly overstepping his bounds as the pimp running the show.  The girls are made to perform dances and then shag their clients.  The first time she is asked to dance she doesn't move (which symbolizes her refusal to open up and talk to the therapist - or the Madam) she's then told that she herself has all the weapons she needs to fight and that her fight starts now (translation - therapy can help you just have to want it badly enough to fight and regain your resolve).  The music starts playing again and in comes Scott Glen her ""Escape"" coach.  Essentially, he tells her what she needs to escape from the prison in her own mind albeit it's made to look as if she's attempting to escape the asylum itself.

Every time ""Babydoll"" dances she's escaping this tortured reality she lives in.  She just lost her mother and killed her own sister and knows her stepfather arranged a lobotomy.  The adventures she runs off to in her head don't really involve anyone else only her chance to escape.  She essentially experienced 2 traumatic events one of which she was the direct cause of.  How do people cope with trauma?  In youth many will escape by dissociating which is psychologically speaking separating oneself from their own mind in order to keep away the horror/grief/guilt or whatever.  I'm speculating here but what appears to be going on is she did formulate a plan to escape (not entirely sure if they really did help her or not) but the reality that she has no one left and nowhere to go but the one person in the asylum that didn't belong was Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish). She helps her escape and ""be free"" but for her the only ""true"" escape she has is in fact the lobotomy because all that horror/grief/guilt and whatever else would be gone.

I believe the trailer, like almost every trailer does, gave people the wrong idea about the movie.  They saw action and a bunch of women kicking (insert bad word here) and then they go see what promises to be an action packed kick butt movie.  So, much so that even if they realize what they were watching they were disappointed or they missed all the underlying psychological phenomenons that were occurring.  Personally, I believe it was brilliantly done and well met.  The vast majority of people will at some point experience a trauma (it doesn't have to be violent) which is so difficult for us to bear that we remove ourselves from it - aka dissociate.

This was probably wayyyy too much for me to put in here but I'm hoping a different perspective might inspire people to watch a great flick.",1393977600,2,3041,4.571955719557195

It requires a sensitive ear and watchful eye to pick up the subtle parallels between the fantasies and characters.  Mr. Snyder left a lot up to the viewer to interpret on their own.

4349135,4,B004EPYZU8,"There are a lot of hardcore ""love it"" or ""hate it"" reviews on this movie.  I got it and watched it last weekend with my wife and nursing school-age daughter, not expecting a whole lot except for very nice visual effects.  You do get a LOT of very nice visual effects - the CG work in the film is stunning and the camera work throughout the movie is fantastic.  About twenty minutes into this movie, you will think you've got the whole thing completely figured out and it does seem rather simplistic and predictable if you've got any film smarts at all.  So, I was impressed by the visuals but not so much the story - until the last ten minutes of the movie!

Those who don't understand why this is called ""Sucker Punch"" or who don't like the film simply did not understand the end of the movie.  I'm a feature editor for a publishing company and do a lot of writing myself, and I NEVER saw this ending coming, and it does completely rearrange the entire movie and instantly made me want to scan back through it.  We watched it again late the next day, and sure enough, the director planted countless signals throughout the movie that tied into the ending that you simply don't notice until you know to look for them.  The way this thing ended makes it a brilliant piece of writing and it made the otherwise seemingly ""shallow"" story very deep indeed.

On that note, as mentioned, I watched it with my wife and daughter, who are both darned clever (in my opinion) and while I was sitting there on the couch going ""Whoa!""  at the end, they were both looking rather confused.  I knew they hadn't ""got it"" and asked them to explain what we'd just watched, and sure enough, neither one of them ""got it"" at all.  Once I forked over the explanation, they were both going ""OH!!! Well that make sense!"" and tossing around ""Never saw that coming"" and things of that nature - which led to us watching the movie again the next night.

As to those complaining about the scanty clothing - please!  Generally the girls are wearing dance practice attire, no different than was seen throughout ""White Christmas"" back in 1954 and nobody's thrown into a fit over that.  You'll see a lot more skin watching practically anything, and you certainly see a lot more sexy outfits if you go to any grown-up Halloween party.  There are no boobs shown here, no naked butts, and the girls only appear in their vampy outfits shown on the cover and in all the Youtube videos when they're in the fairly short fantasy combat sequences.

Over all, if you liked Inception, Shutter Island, Moulin Rouge, or just like action movies in general, you'll probably like this movie.  If you like movies that take you by surprise and make you rethink them and analyze them (like I do), then you'll probably love this movie.  If you want something simple and linear, like ""The Hangover"" crap like that, you will hate this film because you will not understand it - sorry, but there it is.  If you love Duck Dynasty and you think American Idol is actually real, avoid this movie because you won't understand it.

On a parting note with regards to some of the other reviews, this is NOT ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" - which is a movie that's similar in its dark and stylistic CG work, but was a complete failure in having a decent story line.  As much as I wanted to like THAT movie (which I ended up not liking at all), I was rather expecting the same out of Sucker Punch.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised that my initial impressions of Sucker Punch were completely wrong, and this ended up being a VERY interesting little movie - and the music's pretty good too!

You still have to deal with some pretty cheesy special effects in the 'WWII"" fight scene (go ahead and fast-forward past it, it's lame). But once you get past that you are rapidly moving into one of the greatest endings of all times.

The initial battles (Japan & WWI) were entertaining, but it's not until you get past 'Fire' that things really get interesting in this film.

4349920,5,B004EPYZU8,"I loved this movie when it came out and saw it in the theater. Just rewatched it with my sister and still think it's great. I was trying to understand why the critics almost universally panned it. I dig films that play with the frame, get all meta on you and this is one of them. The director sort of intentionally misleads the audience, disrupts the normal conventions of linear narrative and clear-cut roles. So the suckerpunch of the title really is, in one way, directed at the audience. And I think the critics just balked at the arrogance of this move by the director. By not delivering a completely feel-good piece of fluff - which may have been what they were thinking they were settling down to enjoy, what with the extremely smooth visuals. Instead, the film induces a sense of ambivalence, almost complicity, in the viewer as we find that we cannot simply turn off our critical faculties to indulge in a guilt-free gaze at the pretty women. Rather, we are challenged to consider their control and objectification - within the storyline, and by extension, the film industry and society as a whole. So I find it interesting that so many critics lambasted this movie as just that - some sort of soft porn anime-inspired female exploitation. When in my mind, that is exactly what the film is commenting on. It's like the critics didn't get it, took it at face value, or just knee-jerked reacted to their own discomfort at the implications of the film, its weird mixing of genres and glamorous aesthetics with essentially gritty realities about misogyny and a culture where the lines between abuse and pleasure are often blurred with hypocrisy and a leering eye. Or maybe they were just too uptight and puritanical to allow themselves to take seriously a storyline that intermixed a corrupt insane asylum, an oppressive brothel, and an over the top world reminiscent of a thrilling fantasy video game. As a woman myself, I found the topics presented within each level of the storyline to be intriguing, exhilarating, and emotionally resonant. And the reviews out there which imply that this is simply exploitation of girls actually deeply offend me. One, for presuming to stand for the protection of women, in that condescending way that those within that camp tend to do. And secondly, for assuming that watching fit young women in killer outfits kicking tail is only something enjoyable to perverted men, and that such a scenario is so outrageously absurd as to be insulting (this is the movies, for heaven's sake, there is no reality but what we make of it and what we are willing to accept into our mindset - do you really think most of those men in action films could actually do the things they pretend to be able to do?). I know one day this film will be truly redeemed and appreciated, and we'll be able to catch midnight shows as a cult favorite.

It wasn't until I watched it again, however that I was able to have somewhat more of an appreciation for what director Zack Snyder was trying to do here. Even though the story is a complete mess, it's not until you come to understand what the movie is about that the movie's magic becomes apparent. This is a movie that actually gets better with every viewing and in order to appreciate the film even more, you should really check out the bonus features on the disc to get a deeper understanding of how complicated the story actually is and how much work went into creating this film. The Maximum Movie mode especially is a great feature that gives a lot of insight into the film itself and should be watched if you have any interest in the behind the scenes of the film.

The movie itself is presented in pristine quality with fantastic picture and thunderous surround sound. For the price this Blu Ray is going for, it's really not a bad addition to anyone's library. There's plenty of action and the music used in the film is pretty awesome. It's not the most amazing movie ever but I'm convinced it deserves a little better of a reception than it initially received.

The dancer story pulls it all together but otherwise that parts pretty boring and I usually just FF through them.

The only reason I started watching was that Zack Synder, of ""300"" fame directed it. I went the length of the film because the computer generated graphics were interesting, not great, just interesting. Also at times I like watching really bad films just to see how far they can go with the outrageously bad plots, poor acting and gratuitous violence. This one went about as far as they could go. This film is proof that Hollywood can't produce decent entertainment. BOOOOO, BOOOOO!!!!

I think if 3 winged monkeys flew out of my posterior they could come up with a better plot and more meaningful themes.

Don't waste your precious time. And act as responsible adults and don't let your teens watch this, it will rot their brains. I repeat, BOOOOO, BOOOOO!!!!

Attention parents of teenage girls: I forgot to mention the appalling sexual exploitation of women in this film.

Yes it is all fantasy - I think the story is well written and the blur between reality and fantasy is brilliant.
The reality story is way too heavy to watch without the altered reality to get us, (and Baby Doll) thru it.
This could give girls going thru a hellish time in their lives a way (a reason, a blueprint, an inspiration) to push thru, and keep going.

4350138,3,B004EPYZU8,"I've seen 2011's ""Sucker Punch"" twice now and it struck me the same both times. Like I said in my title blurb, it is a spectacular production with absolutely stunning women, particularly Abbie Cornish and Emily Browning, and it is entertaining in many ways; unfortunately, the story is only moderately interesting.

Browning plays ""Baby Doll"" in the 1950s, whose wicked stepfather takes her to a mental asylum to receive a lobotomy. He wants to shut her up to hide his crimes, of course. She resorts to fantasy to escape her predicament, imagining herself and the other people at the asylum in a mob-owned brothel. When she's forced to dance at the ""brothel"" she withdraws further into wild fantasies involving feudal Japan, World War I German soldiers, a dragon and an assortment of other bizarre imaginations.

There's some depth here. The film's not all hot babes in lingerie and CGI-laden action fantasies. But I'll have to watch it a couple of more times to figure it out. The multi-layered nature of the plot -- reality turning to fantasy and then fantasy within fantasy -- is somewhat off-putting and tends to take one out of the story. As it is, the entertainment value is pretty much limited to the women and the outlandish action sequences. The story of the girls trying to get out of the brothel or asylum is only mildly compelling. Still, it's not bad and I may upgrade my rating after future viewings.

The film runs 110 minutes and the extended cut 127 minutes (I own the shorter version and that's more than enough for me).

Cons:
Empty story
Overly dark
Poor use of high caliber stars
Very Grainy Blu Ray transfer
5.1 sound is awful and constantly having to raise and lower volume

With a cast like this, I was hoping for a better movie. I really enjoy Zack Snyder's work. I loved Watchmen and Man of Steel looks promising (going to see it in a few days). This film though...something was definitely missing. The opening felt contrived and forced. It was overly dark and it made me feel like Zack knew he was skimping on the opening so he tried like hell to make the film dark to get the despair of the characters across. It didn't work at all and in the end, I didn't really care about what happened to them. While the visuals are nice at times, I felt like I was being bombarded with constant visual assault. I understand Zach has a certain style that he goes for, but it felt as if he just kept layering it on over and over to the point where I stopped watching the film at several times (I actually watched the extended version of the film over a 5 day span, constantly stopping it out of boredom and annoyance). As previously mentioned, the sound isn't all that great. I absolutely hate it when the dialog in films is kept at an unnecessarily low level. While characters were speaking in this film, I was constantly having to raise the volume so I could hear them. Then as soon as an action scene kicked in I had to lower it or be overpowered by gunfire and blasting music.

Regardless of the sound issue, Zach did pick some good music for the film. I instantly recognized Bjork's Army of Me which I've owned on CD for several years (was on the soundtrack for the film Tank Girl). It was nice to see Carla Gugino in another one of his films. I liked her performance as Silk Spectre. She did a good job here as well. The rest of the previously named actresses could probably carry their own films without a problem. Unfortunately, I felt their talents were underutilized in this movie. Abbie Cornish in particular had a great performance in the film Bright Star. I knew this being an action film we wouldn't see the same performance from her, but I felt bad knowing that with all her talent she was held in place by a hollow and boring character.

I'm also a little happy for them as they were able to let go of their more serious roles and just cut loose and kick some butt in this movie. It was nice to see them all having a good time with the sword and gun play. I think the overbearing visual effects hurt their good time though as they are constantly tugging at your eyes when you should be paying attention to the characters.

Overall, this film for me was a snoozer. I just got bored with it so many times that I almost didn't finish it. I'd seen it in stores for a few weeks, but never picked it up as I'd read some bad reviews. When I saw that it was under $8, I thought what the hell. I'll give it a look. I can see why there were so many bad reviews though. I won't say the film is trash because it does provide a little fun if you have a couple of hours to spare. If you like a movie with some depth and a solid story though, you may want to look elsewhere.

I would not recommend accessing the movie through the Instant Video On Demand feature on Amazon though. I usually have good experiences with Amazon (using this website for the past 9 years), but this time I had so many problems accessing the movie, and when it finally did show up in my video library and started to play (3 hours after I purchased the movie), it was pausing during play back. Makes it hard to keep up with the story lines with the movie pausing.

4350390,4,B004EPYZU8,"This movie has gotten a lot of bad press in regards to the veiled objectification of the female characters.  However, as much as I want to call it distasteful and chauvinistic, I have to temper that opinion against a story that has a great deal of emotional and psychological depth.  I give kudos to the writing and editing staff for making a movie that could have easily shown brutal rape and torture scenes in depth but chose instead to imply the abuse without the need to show it in all its gory detail.  For that alone I appreciated the movie.  But I most enjoyed the parallels between reality and the inner battles we all fight to survive when immersed in horrific circumstances.  I can say I liked the movie enough that I might want to watch it again, if only for the insane fight scenes which feature some pretty amazing special effects.",1371686400,,844,4.526315789473684
4350391,3,B004EPYZU8,"I put off seeing this movie for awhile as it the last movie Zach Snyder made that I needed to see, and I knew it had a bad reputation in comparison to his other movies. It started off bad, but once I finished, I found myself pleased with the movie and surprisingly good enough to buy.

The storyline while a little confusing at first, actually attracted my interest. It isn't completly original in the main goal, but the development of the characters, what Babydoll's visions were, the paralleling of the dream sequences to real events kept me watching. I found myself caring for the characters and felt sad when things turned out bad for them.

Now the ending I liked but it has a missing scene that is extremely helpful. Babydoll is told she needs ""Map, Fire, Knife, Lock and the reason"", well the theatrical cut, does not have the scene where she finds the reason. She does sort of say she figures it out, but it isn't enough for most viewers. Go to youtube and look up Sucker Punch uncut ending it's about 7 minutes. It's a pity studios decided to cut that scene out as it properly concludes the story.

Now why three stars? Purely becuase this movie is more of an eye candy film then Snyder's other movies, only a select few will appreciate the film and its messages and unlike Source Code (which is similer in terms of making you think and being powerful yet simple) the ending can easily be misinterpreted. I myself had to look up the film's synopsis to make sure I understood what I had just viewed.

4351150,3,B004EPYZU8,I had a DLP projector hooked up to my PS3 for watching bluerays.  I mainly bought this movie to watch some action on an 11 ft screen.  The movie came on time and as described.  If you haven't seen Sucker Punch I'd say it's worth watching maybe more than once or with friends.  It definitely wasn't what I was expecting after having had watched the trailers.  The first dream sequence in at the temple in the mountains is far by the best.  Worth watching once for sure.,1363737600,,468,4.32183908045977
4351151,5,B004EPYZU8,"Let me just say that I was waiting forever to see this movie. The trailer was badass, the sneak peeks were awesome, just the whole production looked like it was going to be mind-blowing. And upon buying the DVD, I discovered that this movie fell nothing short of my expectations.
Now, keep in mind that there are some really metaphorical and surreal elements in this film, which is why many people hated it; they just didn't get it. The basic storyline is this: A girl named Babydoll (played by Emily Browning, chick from Lemony Snicket) loses her mother and is left to protect her sister from their stepfather. When she tries to kill him in self-defense but accidentally kills her sister, her stepfather sends her to a mental institution, where a lobotomy is performed. It is here where the real story begins. Right before the lobotomy, Babydoll pictures herself as a newly arrived virgin at a brothel, where she is forced to dance for men. She makes a few friends there and promises them to help find a way out. Babydoll then pictures herself in several surreal and dream-like scenarios that mirror her and the girls obtaining several items that are mandatory for their escape. The only thing is, the last item is a mystery, one they will have to figure out for themselves.
I personally enjoyed the hell out of this film. The main reason it received so much criticism is because it spreads the message of female empowerment but depicts the girls in a male-dominated world in which they dress in skimpy clothing and are almost sexually assaulted on a few occasions. But that's the whole point of this film; it's about overcoming your restrictions and limitations to free your soul. As stated towards the end: ""You have all the weapons you need; now fight.""
And by the way, the visuals are the crown jewel for this movie. From 20-foot-tall Japanese samurais and steampunk Nazi zombies to giant dragons in an orc-ifested castle and humanoid robots on a distant planet, the movie is like a giant roller coaster.
If you love obscure films, this one is for you. Everything about this movie will leave you breathless. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Sucker Punch kicks ass!",1363737600,4,2174,4.708661417322834
4351152,1,B004EPYZU8,Too much fantasy without any material. Maybe teenage boys may think it is cool. It is a test of patience. Special effects may be nice but again I would not waste my time again. As a video game it may be a nice concept though.,1363651200,,225,4.022222222222222

4351380,1,B004EPYZU8,"Yuck what a piece of mess this film was man did i hate this film it was completely the exact oposite of what i thought this film would be. This film is just bad. One of those trashy films that directors think will make money so they put it in a good month instead of January or September where this film should have been. This is on my Worst Films Of 2011 list by far it is probably in my top ten now it is just yuck. How could a Director with a good acting and visuals mess this film up? Well i'll tell you starting with the good to bad. With the two things listed above being the only good things that kept this film from completely taking number 1 as the years crapiest film of the year. Ok so the two good things include the acting, and the visuals. Ok so the acting was really decent but the actors just looked to pretty as action stars there acting was excellent but as said before its not convincing if you look like a model. The only actress that gains both points for her acting and looks is... The Rising Star Jena Malone. She looks just like an action star and she acts perfect while acouple others to note are Emily Browning and Abbie Cornish while neither look totally action star worthy ( Emily Browning the main problem in looks but great in acting) they act excellent, Emily Browningthe better of all of them she just does not look the part , she did try her best but she is just to sexy and hot. Some actress's including Jamie Chung are not given alot of screen time to act in the movie they are just not in the film enough for me to recomment them or highlight their acting sadly. And so we move on to our next and last good thing which is - The Visuals. Ok so the visuals are excellent probably the reason why the film got a Solid March release date instead of an end of January release date. I mean the visuals look fantastic, they are probably the main use of the budget actually. The visuals are not ground breacking but they do look magnificent and the 3D shots with the visual effects is pretty neat too. The visuals were well detailed as well with the creatures looking realistic in a cool and slightly desturbing way. Now on to the bad stuff people which include the script, the cast(i already talked about this so i will not say anything for it) the title (a rare catagory) the run time, the release date, the poster (also a rare catagory), the parts that are not action scenes, the director , and its sexist. Ok the script is by far one of the worst things to be included in this film, i mean the lines are stupid and one liner alot of times i mean god why did you give us this dreadful film that has little action scenes and takes place in a mental hospital a where women dance almost naked for men then the men pay for them and do it with themoh and girls are raped often. Yes that is the script and the action scenes take place when she is dancing for men Oh My God this films script sounds pretty stupid and dull to me and yes this film has alot of Sexist and Rape i hope you decide to skip the movie now its a waist of time which could be sent living and watching a good movie like The Hobbit which was amazing and actually good. Yuck !!! The Title for this film is just something horrible, thats why i decided to say something about it. I mean Sucker Punch wow its just stupid and has nothing to do with the film itself its just bad yuck i could have thought of a better title even my dog could have i swear!!! The run time for this film just dragges on and on i just can't handle it ,it is just way to long i now of some scenes that could have been cut to save time, alot of scenes actually to get the film to 1 hour and 20 minutes which i rarly support actually i usually critisise a film for being to short never for a film being to long but this film is just so dull and gloomy that it makes me want it to be shortened and thats saying something. The release date of the film was bad to i mean March 25th a solid release date and month no way nop don't waste the date on thi \s crap, instead give it a late January opening where i'm shere it will make decent money against a mostly weak month yet still stay away from the good months which are for good movies not this. The Poster for this film was just such a lie most of this film does not have any action yet the film is being marketed as the next expendables movie. Come on who are these players playing this is just like the poster for Bednobbs and Broomsticks where they advertised the film as almost all animated scenes yet the film features about 10 minutes of animated scenes at the end of the over long three hour film come on, the best scenes were the animated scenes any way so wow. All the parts in the film that take place in the mental house place are dull, boring, and the worst thing yet i pray for the awesome 20 minutes of action that takes place all throughout the film man this film is just so boring. I never liked Zack Snyder at all he is just a horrible excuss for a director and it just so happens he also wrote this films script which i hated as well his films are just made to make money and are as boring as can be i swear !!!! And this film besides Mulan and anoher film whcih title i forgot was sexist. Men abuse the women in this film attempt to rape, and hit women and shot them and do any horrible thing they can think of to the women in the mental house it just is not right. This film needs to get burned its horrible !!!!! No women should watch this mess andthis film should only be sold at a xxxx store not at walmart this film does not deserve walmart at all.

4351505,1,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch is simply one of those great little movies that I see myself enjoying for years to come. FALSE. Sucker Punch is actually one of those stupid ""artsy"" films that make one very p/i/s/s/ed off when viewed through your retinas. With the millions of dollars spent on this drivel, starving children in Idaho could eat entire chickens for days on end, but said monies are rather used for releasing this on DVD where it will be personally snubed the same way women snub me when I say ""Hi"" to them out on the streets. In other words, it's a complete waste of everyone's time and money, and should be burned in h.e. double hockey sticks for the hour and a half of my life that it has wasted. Not only did this film not make any sense what-so-ever, but it didn't even try to make any valid statements or reflections on our current society. Look at some of the greatest films of all time; Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Paul Blart: Mall Cop. All of these movies have themes about our current unstable geo-political climate and dependence on technology. I wish I could tell you that this movie offered even a single morsel of an allegory, but other than a scene featuring two women macking out that's an obvious metaphor for our declining economic freedom, there are none ""to do"" with this movie. At first I thought that this was a movie about suicide, then zombies, then ghosts, then dual identities, then robots, then split personalities, then ninjas, then parallel universes, then robot ninjas, then dragons, and then finally b/o/o/bs. In the end we never know what it was truly about and can be chalked up as a completely and utterly waste of time.

In a perfect world, Sucker Punch would have been life changing. I really did want this movie to be a/n/u/s moistening. I mean those smoking hot actresses put out their whole talents on display and this is what they get in return! A film that supposedly tackles real life issues, instead, has some silly story about this girl that can transmorph into different fantastic creatures like tralfamadores. Heck, they could have done a whole MATRIX angle and I still might have dug into it. All I'm saying is that it would have been much more cognitively interesting if we find out that she is in an alternate reality and has to go on some dangerous quest for various items that can help in gaining her freedom. Now that would be a great movie! Visually, there are some thought provoking transitions in this flick, like the one of a dragon chasing an airplane, then to an explosion, then to a hot chick dancing in a brothel kitchen, and then to another explosion, but all of this is for nothing because the movie simply doesn't know what to do with itself. I think the director knows how to show sexy women in interesting ways, set the mood of a scene that involves sexy women, and have interesting comments on the overall state of sexy women in mental institution, but the man either had a shasty script or was on some kind of mind augmenting dopamine that elevated him onto another state and plane of incoherent passive thoughts. I'm super p/i/s/s/ed and you would be too if you saw this film. So please, don't be bamboozled by this movies allure of deep metaphysical contemplations, because it just ain't there.",1362009600,4,3312,4.642248722316865

Others might like it though.  The animation is very good and the fight scences are pretty impressive.  There's definitely more action than story line so if that's a plus for you, you might like it.  I thought it was too much flare and not enough movie though.  There is a plot line but it's weird and dramatic and there are random jumps into make believe battles, which I thought threw off the momentum of the story.  Recomend it only if you're in the mood for lots of action and are okay with the over-dramatizations.

4351815,4,B004EPYZU8,"Zack Snyder has gained notoriety for his extremely visually-appealing films.  If there's something you can't say about his movies is that they don't look pretty.  When Sucker Punch was being marketed, people wowed at the looks of the movie, but they were mostly at odds at what to think at what little they knew about the film's plot.  Some people didn't care, because they knew they'd at least be entertained, while others pointed out that Snyder's most famous and best films have been adaptations, while this story was wholly original, and they didn't trust Snyder had what it takes to write a compelling story.

When the movie was released it was inmediately panned by most critics and audiences.  I admit that was the reason I didn't go see this film in theaters.  Heck, even after I purchased the Blu Ray I let it sit there for weeks until I got the courage to watch it.  Everyone complained about the fantastic visuals being wasted in a poor story with bad characters.  On the one hand, it gave me hope, since it would mean people would finally be taking into account good stories in their films instead of just the visuals.  On the other hand, it gave me pause, since except for this particular event, people kept and still keep proving to this day that movies with terrible stories and awful characters are still successful, even with visuals much weaker than the ones in this film, or even terrible (for instance, the Twilight series).

What happened then?  Why is that movies with worse elements had been less despised, or even loved?  Sometimes you can suffer from very bad marketing (like Green Lantern did), sometimes you'll have people believing so hard a movie will fail that they'll be conditioned to dislike it even after watching it (like happened to The A-Team).  And sometimes... sometimes a movie will simply be terribly misunderstood.  This is, I believe, what happened to Sucker Punch.

I got this movie's Blu Ray on a whim, and I have to say, I don't regret having purchased it, and I do regret not having seen it on a theater.  The visuals are fantastic, period.  You know that, going to a Zack Snyder movie.  The story, though, can be confusing to the point of people not believing there's actually one.  Reading a bunch of reviews, I can see were the reviewers are coming from, but it looks like they didn't consider a movie that looked this good could have a good story and they didn't really bother to look for it.  On the other hand, I only saw the extended cut, and maybe the theatrical cut is harder to understand.  In any case, there's absolutely no doubt that lots of people failed to understand it, for one reason or another.

Emily Browning plays the protagonist, a girl whose mother died and left her and her sister everything in her will.  Her stepfather, mad at that fact, decides to kill the daughters, starting with the younger one.  Emily's character escapes, gets hold of the stepfather's gun, wounds him but accidentally kills her sister (this part is ambiguous, the sister might be dead before she arrives, but there's no question she blames herself for her sister's death).  The stepfather takes this as an opportunity and interns her in an asylum, claiming she went insane and secretly paying a shady employee to get her a lobotomy.  Five days later, as the procedure is about to start, we get to see the story of those five days unfold as a fantasy inside her head.  That story involves her plan to escape the brothel with a bunch of other girls she befriends.

Yes, a brothel.  As it happens, those five days are set in a brother instead of the asylum.  Why?  Well, you see, it's heavily implied (make no mistake, this movie's story doesn't hold your hand, that's one of the main reasons so many people misunderstood it) that the girls in the asylum are victims of rape.  The brothel fantasy makes the protagonist put some sense into a situation that's already happening without the girls' consent.  She knows they're having sex with strangers, but in her fantasy, they're not being forced, they're choosing to do it.  Also, the fantasy replaces her lobotomy with the loss of her virginity.  As an aside, she and her friends go by codenames, like Rocket, Blondie or Sweet Pea.  The protagonist goes by Baby Doll.

After saving a girl from a tragedy, Baby Doll befriends her and her pals and devises a plan to escape, thanks to the one element of the movie that can be attributed to supernatural forces instead of mere fantasy: a guardian angel, an instructor, a wise man.  The plan involves getting a bunch of items from the asylum/brothel, which are stolen by her friends while she distracts the staff by dancing.  You see, Baby Doll can dance so wonderfully she mesmerizes everyone who watches.  Now, people who watch this and take it literally might (and will) scoff at the concept, but you have to realize that, leving aside the fact that this is a fantasy, the rating (PG-13) won't allow them to mention what's REALLY happening.  ""Dancing"" is code for, depending who you ask, either ""stripping"" or ""having sex"".  This is a brothel, of course it wouldn't make any sense to have a girl dancing fully clothed and that somehow being so good to distract everyone around.  Then again, since the entire five-days wait is for her to ""lose her virginity"" I'd say sex is out the question in the fantasy brothel.  I believe the easiest way to explain what happens is this: in the real world (asylum) she's having sex to distract people while her friends steal the items, while in the fantasy world (brothel) she's either stripping or masturbating (or both) while her friends steal the items, but this is called ""dancing"" for the purposes of keeping the PG-13 rating.

In any case, you'd realize that neither of those would be a good fantasy for her to have while the stealing happens, so she replaces that with a Inception-style fantasy within a fantasy.  Every time she has to ""dance"" her mind switches to an alternate steampunk world where she and her friends are a group of sword-wielding gun-totting monster-bashing fighters on a mission to obtain an item that's a representation of whatever item in the real world they're out to obtain.  The best action of the film happens on these sequences, which are visually stunning and stylistic.  Every time the sequence ends and they obtain the item, we go back to the brothel, where Baby Doll stops ""dancing"" while her friends have the real item in their hands.

So, as you can see, the film borrows heavily from a couple of known movies, such as The Matrix, Inception or Shutter Island.  The problem with the back-and-fort between fantasies is that it probably confuses some people who are not used to movies not telling them exactly what's going on.  I have to say, you might have to watch it more than once to get what's really happening.  I don't think it will be necessary, since I only saw it once and understood it perfectly, but you can clearly see by reading the reviews of the theatrical release that A LOT of people didn't understand it.

I will concede a couple of points for the early reviews, though.  Despite this supposedly being a fantasy inside a girl's head, visually it's definitely a male fantasy.  Hot girls in skimpy outfits, doing cool, stylized moves with swords and guns while doing sexy poses is not something most girls would fantasize about.  And, of course, the story isn't very original (as I said, it borrows heavily from other films).  So, it's Sucker Punch a female-empowerment tale?  Not really.  Is it demeaning to girls, then?  No, not that either.  Is it all style and no substance?  No, the substance is there, but sometimes the style will distract you from seeing it.  Is it a bad film?  No.  It's not a fantastic film either, but it's definitely a good one.",1360022400,4,7789,4.684326710816777

4351819,4,B004EPYZU8,"Baby Doll imagines an elaborate fantasy world in which she plans her escape from a corrupt mental facility after being institutionalized by her abusive stepfather in Zack Snyder's SUCKER PUNCH from 2011. SUCKER PUNCH is a visual knock-out with mind-blowing special effects and non-stop action that will leave you breathless! Snyder has assembled the perfect cast for this exploitation/fantasy cross-over that take the otherwise empty characters and blow them up into larger-than-life super-heroes. SUCKER PUNCH pushes teen fetishism to the edge with its ultra-sexy heroines that are armed to the teeth with swords and guns, taking on everything from dragons to samurai warriors, undead Nazi soldiers, and futuristic androids in their skimpy schoolgirl outfits. It is so easy to become entranced by the cute girls, stunning fantasy worlds, and huge explosions that minor things like plot and character hardly seem to matter. Recommended for fans of 300, SIN CITY, and MUTANT CHRONICLES.

Instead of corporate thievery (the guy's world), we get domestic and institutional abuse.

The visuals, with lots of CGI, are over the top. Do they make sense? No. Who cares? But everyone IN the movie seems to care: Women are generally good; men generally bad. Is this a revenge movie? Yes...but not quite. Questions get thrown at you throughout the film but never gives you enough slack to come to an answer. Before you know it, the movie's over. For some, maybe it's about time.

But seriously, this movie ranks (at least for me) as a guilty pleasure, I saw it in previews and thought:  OK........it's worth a look see to watch with a bunch of guys who like looking at pretty girls.  And that's what the movie (on the surface) wants you to buy into.

Pretty girls who dance and show skin and seduce their clientele while secretly.....trying to escape the near prison like circumstances they live in.  The movie itself has a comic book/surrealistic (pillow) aspect to it

A very seductive soundtrack adds a lot to the movie itself and I think enhances every scene.  But overall, this is a fantasy movie for guys (teenage and up).

Remember as a youth, how much you enjoyed going for a ride at an amusement park that now as an adult, that ride doesn't seem all that great?  Sucker punch is like that: not that great at first...........but if you just go with it and not try to look for it's flaws..........can still provide thrills.

First there's the reality level, what is really going on in the real world, you quickly forget about that until the end, which is most likely a good thing. Second there's the low level of fantasy, a story within a story, which the characters create in order to cope. I guess you could say this is how the characters, or at least the main character now view reality. The third level is just total fantasy, lots of action very anime like, I found that in itself to be well worth the movie. I just couldn't wait for the next action scene to kick in. There were a few areas in the film I found a bit lacking, but I guess it was required to leave somethings unknown in order for this type of movie to come together.

I understand that the action sequences take place in a fantasy, within a fantasy, within a nightmare (I really do).  The action is just so disconnected from anything else in the movie that it looks like someone put some CG together then decided to write a movie around it.  The CG is enjoyable in and of itself, however it doesn't really relate to action in the mid-tier fantasy.  There just seems to be too much time spent setting up for the next action sequence without any character development.  In the end, the only reason that anyone seems to really trust baby-doll is that she can ""dance"" good.

Also, it looks this way on the DVD cover, and after watching it I feel lied to and sick because of this abuse. In the beginning after her mother is probably murdered by the abusive father and when the young girl accidently kills her younger sister in a failed attempt to protect her from their evil abusive father, I hoped that she would at least kill this disgusting abuser but she doesn't and he then pays to have her put in a bleak mental institution, and this is when I knew this is not the light Action movie I believed it would be. I thought it might get better if she grows up to escape and kills her abusive father but she doesn't and it gets worse. The girls in the institution are in many ways further abused. Sucker Punch is a movie about young girls being constantly abused. The DVD cover should say Sucker Punch is about abuse. Even if there is a few scenes with girls in skirts, I could not even look at them as being attractive because of knowing how in the institution they are being abused by abusers and this abuse is sickening. The actors and animation scenes were ok, had it not been for the theme of abuse. Then some of the young girls after being exploited, manipulated, and abused, are killed and thus don't escape. I felt sucker punched by not knowing before that the main theme is young girls being constantly abused. Do NOT buy Sucker Punch. If it was on tv I would have changed the channel, but I watched the DVD and out of over 100 DVD's I have seen so far this is only the second DVD that I have thrown in the garbage so no one else has to feel sick watching the theme of abuse in Sucker Punch.",1354924800,5,1869,4.194444444444445
4353059,4,B004EPYZU8,"On seeing the theatrical trailers, I remember thinking ""That chain gun wielding samurai looks pretty cool"" but that the movie just sort of looked like it would be a loud mess. Decided to skip seeing it in the theatre (sadly, much pickier about which movies I'll see in the theatre than I was 20 years ago).

I ended up catching the movie on cable and was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's not a great movie by any stretch, but it's eye and ear candy. Some of the imagery & action sequences are really just amazing to watch and I greatly enjoyed the soundtrack paired with the visuals. I liked it enough that I bought the BlueRay so I could see it in full high definition with great sound - and I was NOT disappointed.

I convinced my wife to watch with me and her review was ""It's like a teenage boy's fantasy come to life."" She didn't exactly dislike it and there were elements that she did like (some of the music and, again, some of the imagery). However, the long action sequences definitely did not have the same draw for her.

Perhaps a good litmus test of whether you should spend the time/money on this movie: Does the idea of a slight, sword wielding woman fighting 3 giant samurai make you think ""neat"" or does it make you groan?

Personally, I enjoyed the soundtrack (particularly the new versions of ""Sweet Dreams,"" ""White Rabbit"" and ""Where is my Mind"" enough that I also bought the soundtrack.",1354665600,,1421,4.453846153846154

4353424,2,B004EPYZU8,"Well, I saw Sucker Punch.  I'm not sure how that happened, but here I am.  And I do feel like I've been punched.  I know I'm not the first to make that joke, but, seriously, what else could that title be referring to?  It makes no sense in the context of the movie, other than to say 'look out, audience, this is gonna hurt!'.

Sucker punch is a perfect little microcosm of successes and failures and some more failures that encompasses everything that is good, bad, and awful about Zack Snyder as a film maker.  Unfortunately, though perhaps not surprisingly, it's much more bad than good.

I think the worst of the problems are hinted at in the very opening; we have a slow motion, dialogue-less montage where we learn about our leading lady (Baby Doll is her name, more on that later) and her troubles with her... father?  Step-father maybe?  And the accidental death of her sister, resulting in Baby Doll's incarceration in some kind of very specific mental hospital for gorgeous and thin twenty-something girls who act like teenagers.  It was an interesting choice; the visuals are clear (if a bit juvenile) and it tells the story well enough.  The problems are that a scene like that never happens again, making it stylistically superfluous, and the following scene gives all the exact same information only spelled out for the audience in ridiculous detail.  Making the opening completely superfluous to telling the story as well.  That first scene of dialogue, after the opening montage, also goes out of it's way to rape logic, as evil step/dad and rapey orderly work out their nefarious plot to ice-pick Baby Doll's brain... right in front of her... while she stands literally in between them and an authority figure who could stop the whole movie if Baby Doll would open her damn mouth and take some initiative.  But she doesn't, she doesn't...

I'm off on a little bit of a tangent, but I think it sums up the movie - overdone visuals, poor story-telling and a healthy dose of chauvinism masked as grrrrl power.

The gimmick here, of course, is that we spend a bulk of the movie in Baby Doll's fantasy world.  ...or ALL of the movie, it's not really clear.  The main setting shifts from the asylum to some sort of fantasy, parallel bordello, with the same actors playing parallels of themselves.  There's no warning for this shift or explanation, it just sort of happens and deal with it.  And then, from there, Baby Doll slips into yet ANOTHER fantasy world whenever she dances for men; partly because she's escaping the horrors of something, but partly because it's painfully obvious that Emily Browning can't dance.

I'm fine with this as a concept - the problem here is that the jumps are so artlessly handled that we have no idea how the fantasy world translates to the real world.  When they're peeling potatoes in the bordello, are they peeling potatoes in the hospital?  When someone gets killed in the double fantasy world, do they die in the hospital?  How?  Did they ever exist?  Yes, children can and do build thick layers of fantasy for themselves to escape trauma and abuse; so thick they can confuse it with the real world (the girls in this situation are a bit old for that, but whatever) but we, the audience, need to know what the stakes are and what the rules are at least in a general sense.  The oddball, action oriented ""missions"" the girls take in the double fantasy world are so loosely connected to their plan to get out of the hospital/bordello/whatever that they start to feel like seven or eight music videos strung together instead of a movie.

I'm sure this concept could be done well... oh, wait!  It was!  In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B003Y1D7UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>, a movie of stunning beauty that expertly weaves a young girls fantasy's with her horrible realities and shows us clearly how one influences the other.

Huh.  Maybe Zack Snyder should have watched that one first.

I'm being negative, but it's not all bad.  There are some great performances by everyone except Emily Browning, especially the core group of girls except Emily Browning.  Most notably, Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone who are clearly working very hard for this retarded script.  Some of the actions scenes are very, very well done - I'm remembering the choreography in a battle in WWI style trenches, which is an excellent blend of gun play and close-quarters combat.  Pretty exciting stuff.  Also, and I mean this in the most sexless way possible, the girls all look incredibly impressive holding their guns.  Large rifles are heavy and awkward and the girls clearly went through a good deal of weapons training to look like pros and it really come across.  Very impressed, I was.

Again, all that would be wonderful if they were trying to make one or two music videos.  It's not enough to hold up a movie.

The awful icing on top, though, is just how grimy and sexist the movie feels.  I know it takes place in a world where these girls are abused (in a vague, non-specific, but probably sexual sort of way) but I'm talking in a meta sense, in an 'outside looking in' sense.  It's clearly a movie that was made so grown men could watch young girls in short skirts; the creepy part is that it pretends to NOT be that.  It's a movie where girls murder hordes of faceless monsters, but only in their fantasies to escape the real world where they're raped and used (if I understand what little subtext there is).  We're never actually shown them trying to solve a problem and, in the end, they utterly fail as Baby Doll is lobotomized and all but one of them end up dead (I think).  Spoiler's ahoy.  Hell, the character's don't even get NAMES, they get PET NAMES, like 'Baby Doll' and 'Blondie' and 'Sweat Pea'; you know, the type of things you'd call something you possess but don't think too highly of.  Again, I'm not saying these ideas couldn't work, but it comes across as an older man's masturbation fantasy that he's tried to dress up in a way that can be sold to young girls.  If that isn't creepy, I don't know what it.

I'm being overly harsh, and in no way am I accusing anyone of anything overly rude or illegal.  But the movie is just such an artless mess of images and ideas that it's easy (and kinda fun) to nit-pick it to death.  I wouldn't call it lazy and I hesitate to call it stupid.  But it's certainly a craftless, jumbled... yeah, okay, stupid mess of a movie.  It's not a complete failure, but it really rides the line.

And you know what the kicker is?  I can't think of anything else to suggest watching in its place.  The Kill Bill movies, maybe?  Seriously, I go nothing over here...

I've seen my share of bad movies, but Sucker Punch is the first one that really made me angry for wasting 2 hours of my time.

Sucker Punch was marketed as an action movie with pretty girls and gorgeous CGI. When I read some reviews about it trying to be ""clever"" and failing at it, I initially thought ""well, it's going to be like The Matrix or Inception, good action/fantasy flicks with a pseudo-clever plot that one might enjoy or not, but which doesn't ruin the overall movie"".

I didn't have high expectations for Sucker Punch, I was just expecting an ok (or even below average) action movie. Turns out I was very wrong.

The first 20 minutes of the movie are deceptive, because they make you believe the movie might actually have a solid scenario. The introduction is actually pretty good, the background story of the heroin is well introduced with beautiful dark images (Zack Snyder is good for this), and it tricks you into believing the movie is actually going to be ""clever"" as far as action movies go.

The plot revolves around the 3 levels of reality the heroin will evolve in: her real life, where she is in an asylum scheduled for lobotomy, her dreams where she is a high-class prostitute working in a  brothel/casino, and her dreams within here dreams where she is the heroin of various video-game-like adventures with her friends.

This might have looked good on paper, but practically this film fails on so many levels that it made me want to throw the remote at my screen.

The most shocking part is the disgusting mix between the dark background story (a girl who is, in 2 levels of reality, scheduled for lobotomy, or scheduled to be sold for her body, and in both cases under the constant threat of rape) and the super manga/videogame universe, in which she evolves dressed in a schoolgirl uniform taken directly from a 14 year-old boy's wet dreams. So which one is it, Zack? Are we supposed to feel sorry for the girl because she is being abused, or turned on by the school girl uniforms and the massive amount of cleavage in the action sequences? Eventually, this lack of direction in what the audience is supposed to feel will lead you to either become bored, or feel dirty (is anyone supposed to be turned on by the sexy fighter when 10 minutes ago she was under the threat of being raped?)

As an action movie, Sucker Punch fails because the action scenes have absolutely no suspense or no stake. When people get hurt in the Matrix, they get hurt in the real world to. In Sucker Punch, we see the heroin getting punched by a giant, her body hitting a wall at full speed, and not even sweating for it. As a result, from the first action scene, we know that nothing major is going to happen there. The result is that the action scenes follow each other and each one is more boring than the previous, despite the orgy of CGI spat at the audience.
The action scenes look like they are some kind of Promotion Video for video games, but even video games have better plots than that. At some point in the movie, the girls have to kill a dragon. The dragon is protected by Orcs, so they have no choice but to kill the Orcs, then the dragon, which is ok. But once they're done killing the orcs and the dragon, they start killing the paladdins that were fighting the orcs. So, which side are they on? Apparently none, as long as it means even more action scenes will be shown.

As a drama, Sucker Punch fails because the audience doesn't get attached to any character at any time. The characters are dumb, and the scenario is weak. Dialogs are terrible, and not helped by actors who overall deliver a poor performance. Since the whole plot consists for the girls in finding 5 items, and it is described as if we were in a video game for retarded kids, there is, again, absolutely no emotion or suspense involved. Get one item, succeed, proceed to the next item, and so on. At some point, one of the girls dies, and you'll have a bad time remembering her name, who she is, why she was here, and why you even care... And if it wasn't enough, towards the end, the scenario decides that the true heroin of the movie is not the one you've been following for 2h, but another girl you didn't even care about, so if the audience's interest wasn't lost before, Snyder guarantees to do it at the end.

As a movie overall, Sucker Punch pretends to be clever, but gives away everything so obviously that it is insulting to the audience. ""Oh, she was in the asylum the whole time, let me show you 5 minutes of obvious connections between the two worlds to make it more obvious for you"". It is amazing how a movie that pretends to have so many layers is actually so flat and dumb.

The whole 2h are spent like that, alternating between poorly written/acted drama scenes, boring action sequences, and obvious scenario plots so that the 13 year old kid watching the movie can pretend that people who didn't like the movie just ""didn't get how deep it is"".

In some interviews, director Zack Snyder claimed the movie was about girl-empowerment, which makes me question his sanity even more. Hopefully, the target audience of this movie (13~20 year old males with serious hormone issues) understands that when a girl tries to run away from her terrible reality through her dreams, she doesn't dream that she is a prostitute, or the hyper-sexualized-heroin of a console FPS...

Let me add a 4th level of reality here. The lobotomy announced at the beginning of the movie is actually a message for the audience: it's going to take 2 hours and you'll be brainless after watching Sucker Punch.

Terrible, Terrible movie, I'm so sad I gave Hollywood my money for that piece of trash.

Pros
- The images are good. Zack Snyder plays well with the 3 levels of reality when it comes to colors, etc...

Cons
 - basically everything else. The scenario is lame, acting is sub-par, action sequences are boring, dialogs are terrible, there is no stake, no suspense, no emotion at all in this movie.",1351555200,10,6132,4.523938572719061
4353428,5,B004EPYZU8,"Three movies rolled into one. Who wants it? Or should I say who has the stomach for it? Unfortunately, not too many. I am surprised at how many people hate this movie simply because its story line is weak. Yeah...true, there isn't any real story. But then, there doesn't have to be any. This is a motion picture - a product designed to SHOW you an idea (that idea could also be a biography of a real or imaginary character, as is often the case) by running across your eyes a series of pictures. So, why do you need a story? Can't you appreciate the beauty of the flashing pictures, a visual extravaganza thrown at you by a director who simply wants to show-off his talent. Well, if you appreciate movies for what they are, you will like this movie. If not, you would do better buying Jeffery Archer's Twelve Red Herrings and eating it along with your nails. Btw, ever wonder why the Academy never gives away awards for plots and stories?

Anyhow...the movie is one of Snyder's most creative yet. He displays astounding camera techniques and pastes his imagination on the film canvas in vivid colors. The movie is about a captured soul and her inner struggle to stabilize herself and accept her fate, since she is not blessed with the strength to fight her enemies. What ensues is a portrayal of her inner struggle to understand her situation, fight however she can, and then surrender to her fate. But it's not what you're being shown, but how it is shown to you. And what better way to experience it than on a Blu-Ray!

This package contains the entire movie in Blu-Ray (Extended Cut), DVD (Theatrical Version), and Digital Copy (Theatrical Version). I was able to activate the digital copy even after the printed expiry date. The digital copy will play only on WMP or WMC. The audio-video on BD is astounding, and  is the deserved format for this movie, given its graphical intensity.",1351123200,2,1887,4.6101190476190474
4353429,3,B004EPYZU8,"It would be easy to dismiss this as an idiotic 'video game' movie except that some parts of it are quite good; a bizarre mixture of artistry and awfulness. The film starts with a few minutes of really beautiful, moody dark imagery by cinematographer Larry Fong, lovely and striking and extremely well done. Then we get into the 'plot' line, which is just ridiculous, with stiff amateurish dialog, almost a parody of a bad movie. Next we have the 'action' sequences, which are computer animated in the style of video games, with Steampunk Nazi Zombies thrown in. Hard not to laugh. It's all pasted together with some incomprehensible bits of 'philosophy' from the mind of the director, so pathetically stupid that it defies comment. Filmaker Zach Snyder has some talent, but it's limited; he was given way too much latitude in this production. He started life producing TV ads for cars and never developed the intellectual capacity for a feature film. He has a lot in common with Michael Bey, with whom he went to school, and the ""Transformer"" series - mindless, loud and violent movies which nevertheless find an adolescent audience. If this movie had been just an extended music video, just the dream sequences and skipping the dialog and computer game stuff, it could have been memorable.

And yet there is the soundtrack, which is very good, with some exquisite pieces of the highest quality. Emiliana Torrini singing ""White Rabbit"" is otherworldly and memorable, worth the price of the whole experience. So what gives with such an uneven and inconsistent mess of a movie? Drek like this shows us how Hollywood does business; they give an idiot like Snyder $20M to play with in spite of his incoherent thinking. The only explanation - they must think they will make money. The reviews here on Amazon are all over the place, from enthusiasts to those who feel that God owes them back the wasted two hours of their lives - but on the other hand there are 500 reviews!! Go figure.

Suggestion: Skip the movie and buy the soundtrack. And watch for the work of Larry Fong.",1350691200,,2070,4.779329608938547
4353430,1,B004EPYZU8,"This movie is appropriately named, because I felt like a sucker after watching it.  It was clearly made to bring in the male geek audience with its video game-like fantasy/action and scantily-clad actresses. But as a geeky girl, I was going to overlook the latter in hopes for some substance in the film. Unfortunately, there was no plot or character development and the ""dance"" that she does repeatedly before going into her fantasy world is probably the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Overall, it's a visually striking but horrid film.

4353431,5,B004EPYZU8,"Once you realize that the world of Suckerpunch is presented to you as seen by a shattered young mind struggling to make sense of a horrible situation, you have to step back and ponder what the visions really mean.  As her emotions play across the screen in a psychotropic tableau, stop and ponder... Is the asylum really an ex-dancehall doubling as an after-visiting-hours brothel?  Or does Babydoll just interpret her therapies and mistreatments that way to glamorize her otherwise horrendous situation?  Now... what is real and what isn't?  And when it is obvioulsy not real, what is really going on?

That's the real SuckerPunch.

I suspect the critics pan any movie that might take more concentration than a mind, fresh from a three-drink dinner, can handle.

My eyes started bleeding profusely as my soul offered itself to a higher power for soiling my DVD player with this crap. Abysmal doesn't cover this movie, it's the kind of trash you should to death row inmates 24 hours before execution just to violate the sanctity of their hearts and minds. This kind of films makes you wonder if storytelling shouldn't be a licensed job where you actually have to show serious competence before ever entering a studio.",1349136000,3,685,4.622950819672131
4353533,5,B004EPYZU8,"I'll begin by conceding what a lot of the negative reviews dwell on: there's not much plot, there's not much character development, and if you try to look at the movie from an objective, critical viewpoint, it kind of looks like a farce without any humor. In other words, this movie does not contain any of the elements that our current critical dogma posits are necessary to make a 'good' movie.

And yet I loved this movie, and posit that looking back twenty years from now it will be considered a classic.

I love a good, well-written drama, but Snyder is taking full advantage of technology and the artistic limitations and advantages that film offers to create something working on a different level. He lets gorgeous visuals, aerobic action scenes, and brilliantly-chosen songs do a lot of the emotional heavy lifting for him. The music in this film, particularly, is not just background accompaniment or snippets of popular songs that the viewers already like. Music is probably the best art form in terms of creating pure emotion, and Snyder leverages that power as much as he can. Where most writers and directors want the words and the plot to create the emotion, Snyder is using the power of music. Same with the visuals. Tarantino kind of moved cinema in this direction, but he was always so obsessed with how smart he is and his witty dialogue that Tarantino himself would be a character in all of his movies even if he didn't throw himself into cameo roles.

So the movie creates an emotional interest in the viewer through the music and the visuals. So what? What are the emotions serving? What's the point? To me, Sucker Punch is a wake-up call to the audience, a plea for us to live our lives like we mean them, and to believe that we have tools that we can use, even when it's not apparent. That may sound a little gooey and self-help-y, but it's an important message in our media-saturated world, and to deliver that message through a hyper-mediated movie, where we're looking at three different levels of reality, all obviously fake, is something I imagine an ambitious grad student could write a good paper on, if he had the balls to stand up to the criticism. And it's not a sappy, feel-good movie, when it comes down to it. You have to wrap positive messages in a lot of darkness in order for them to feel credible to modern audiences, and that's exactly what Snyder does in this movie.

Lastly, a lot of the negative reviews, as well as the positive reviews, seem to focus on the over-sexualized nature of the girls. I think they're all missing something: much as Gladiator implicated the audiences' love of violence even as it titillated that same love of violence, Sucker Punch implicates the audiences' participation in the objectification of women even as it presents beautiful women in skimpy outfits. This dissonance actually makes you think about how much sexualization and exploitation we take for granted in media, in a much more thoughtful way than most 'hot girl kicks ass' movies could ever hope to do. And, for the record, the girls are certainly dress sexy, but in a romanticized way, with elaborate costumes and pretty jewelry. No thongs here. No nudity. No actual sex. So in ways it's much less exploitative than a lot of what's out there, and it serves to make you think differently about the amount of female exploitation we take for granted in the media.

Long story short, if you can get into it, which I admit may be difficult for people to do if they're not already familiar with the geeky tropes this movie celebrates, this movie is incredibly entertaining and actually makes you think about the way we consume entertainment. It's far more than the negative reviews imply, but not everyone is going to 'get it,' because it's not trying to work in the ways that most movies do.",1348876800,5,3823,4.69150521609538
4353534,5,B004EPYZU8,"From the moment my eyes were first laid upon Sucker Punch, I was in love. I saw it in theatres and it quickly jumped to the top of my favorites list. For Christmas, I received the normal DVD (no blu-ray, no extras) and loved watching it. I've lost track of the number of times I've rewatched this movie, experiencing the same wonderment and pleasure each time as the first time I saw it. However, I quickly learned that the Blu Ray version (yes, this one!) has an entire 18 minutes that gets left out of the theatrical version. The second I could buy a blu-ray, I did. And you can be sure that in that same second I bought this version of the movie. My oh my was it worth it! The theatrical version leaves a lot of little holes that don't make sense. They're fixed in the extended edition. When I thought this movie couldn't be more perfect, it proved me wrong within those 18 minutes. I'm surprised that a lot of the scenes were cut because I believe they help this movie become even greater. If you're debating which version to buy (plain vs blu-ray), I would definitely recommend going with the blu-ray.

Other than, like, everything?

This movie was abysmal. Watching someone play UNCHARTED is more interesting than this movie because at least that video game has interesting characters, a good plot and is coherent. Look, COULD this have been a good movie? Yes. But the storytelling is completely incomprehensible and when it's not, it's insipid.

Zach Snyder does action brilliantly, but he is not a storyteller. Here, he even created the story, so it's doubly awful. Dark themes, a mental asylum, girls in danger and a prison escape are all great pieces - as is the idea of a girl creating her own world to escape from the horrors of her reality. But it needs to be cohesive. There is no connection between the real world, the imagined world, and the dreamworld.

In the climax of THE MATRIX, we are concerned about what happens to our characters when they're in the Matrix because we know it will affect them in reality. We're also brought back and forth between those worlds to understand the consequences of actions and decisions made in each world. We see both sides. SUCKER PUNCH eschews these cinematic rules in favor of ten-minute video game fight levels that hold no suspense because it all happens in the main characters mind and no one can get hurt. If these sequences mirror what is happening in the real world, we either never see it or it's so poorly connected that all suspense disappears.

Zack Snyder is not Christopher Nolan. Go watch INCEPTION instead.",1344124800,,1646,4.864285714285714

4353541,4,B004EPYZU8,"SuckerPunch is an interesting film. You become a part of a mentally confusing adventure about a girl who, through no fault of her own, ends up in an institution for the mentally insane. Distraught over the loss of her mother and sister and recently attacked by her step-father, Baby Doll (the main character) invents a world inside the asylum to help her cope with the terrifying situation in which she finds herself.

It's not entirely clear if some of the things portrayed actually happened, but it is implied that some of the events she instigates occurred. This is what makes the film so interesting.
Granted, the costumes and the fantasy worlds Baby Doll shows us could be considered simply ""fan-service"" for the typical anime/fantasy/videogame lover, however I feel that THAT is what makes the film so visually appealing. The transitions from muted tones and gritty textures to bright lights and colorful show-costumes serve as a helper to the viewer to determine between what is seems to be real and what is not.

Despite the tragedy that occurs in this film, the ending is bittersweet and closes with an answer to the opening questions: """"Who Honors those we love for the very life we live? Who sends monsters to kill us...and at the same time sings that we'll never die? Who teaches us what's real...and how to laugh at lies? Who decides why we live and what we'll die to defend?

DO NOT OVERLOOK the fact that Amazon's movie description compares this movie to Moulin Rouge right off the bat. Amazon is completely accurate. It's far more a whore-house musical than it is an action pic. If I hadn't read the movie's backstory on IMDB, I may or may not have understood that its scenes jump back and forth between three different realities. The movie Inception did that methodically and masterfully; this movie does it clumsily and without explanation. There's the initial reality where a terrible crime takes place, then an imagined reality (of a whore house) the main character envisions herself in after wrongfully being committed to a mental hospital, then a third reality (an action reality) that the character dreams of to escape her imagined whorehouse reality. I'm dreaming of a reality where I didn't watch this movie and instead had an entertaining evening. All that said, the soundtrack of the action scenes were good, and the cinematography was artfully and impressively executed. Perhaps then the best way to view this movie is with the sound off and running as a video background during a busy party. The Blu-ray transfer was also a disappointment - too many grainy scenes likely due to dim-lighting situations in which they were filmed.

Now, it seemed to show that every time baby doll would dance, she will go into this fantasy land and fight whoever to get special items to escape. In real time, she is really dancing, and others are helping her collect the real item they need to escape.

Spoiler Alert!!!

But, at the end of the movie, what we think is happening isn't really happening at all. It was a dream within a dreamworld. That's right. There TWO fantasy lands and we don't get back to ""true reality"" until the end of the movie. Then, baby doll gets sucker punch because she did no wrong. But, is forever gone to true reality because of her evil step-father and the bad guys that did that to her.

4353851,3,B004EPYZU8,"Really all you need to know is that this movie was directed by Zack Snyder (300 and Watchmen) who, like Tim Burton, really only makes one kind of movie. If you liked 300 or Watchmen you are going to like this movie, if you didn't you are going to hate it. Snyder's style is all over this thing: crazy physical fights, dark brooding world, LOTS of slow motion, bad dialogue, titillation and the ending is depressing. Think of it as a hour and a half plus long music video with some dialogue and ""story"" thrown in. It's part Kill Bill, part Moulin Rogue and I suppose a hint of Inception because of the psychological stuff going on. I will admit that the movie is visually stunning and the actresses in it work the tiny outfits costuming made for them, but just don't expect a super deep or comprehensive story from this campy action flick.
If you're going to buy it I would suggest the Blu-Ray for the enhanced audio and video, since that is really the meat and Potatoes of this movie, and the cut out footage actually does make a difference. They sliced the movie to eek out a PG-13 rating, but since that didn't save Sucker Punch from dreadful box office numbers, they should have just gone for the R and been happy with it.

Bottom Line: I didn't know what I was getting into, but considering how much I hate Snyder's other works, I'm amazed that didn't hate this one despite its cliches and fan boy pandering. I guess you can make a silk purse out of a sows ear if you put it in a school girl's uniform then arm it with a Samurai sword and .45 semi-automatic.",1334275200,,1562,4.3493150684931505

That's this movie.
I had heard it was terrible, but I thought I might be able to get some laughs from it.  No, not a one.  It was pure agony just to try and sit there while this movie played on my television.
It wasn't entertaining and I'm really glad I didn't pay anything to see it.
There's absolutely no plot.
There's absolutely no characters.  ""How can this be?"", you ask, I dare you to just try and watch this movie and you'll understand.
In fact, I've seen 30 second commercials that had more meaning to me, and more substance.
I've seen adult movies that had better storylines.
Here's this movie summed up.
A girl gets admitted to a terrible mental ward, that apparently only has female patients, by her evil stepdad to collect the money her recently deceased mother left her.  She's about to have a labotomy so that she can't tell the police anything about how horrible her stepdad has really been.  She goes off (in her mind) to create a fantasy world where the girls are all strippers and on the side fight off dragons, cyborgs, and steam powered Nazi's in barely any clothes (and certainly no protective armor).  Somehow, this is supposed to relate to getting all the girls out of the mental ward and away from abusive employees.  And somehow this movie is supposed to make sense.  She had the surgery at the end and is comatose.  The end!  Wow, what a great plotless, characterless, piece of cinema crap!!!!
The only good thing I can say about this movie is some of the CG work is fantastic and is beautiful to look at, but it can't save a movie that's missing a plot.
How did this movie ever get green-lit???!!!

The film has stylish cinematography and sumptious visuals as what you'd expect from the movies '300' and 'Watchmen'. Gorgeous battles and fight-scenes. The cabaret dance scene is excellent. I like the intriguing way the film morphs between fantasy and reality, it gets you thinking about it long after to figure out the symbolisms later.
Plus it gets points for featuring music by The Smiths ""Asleep""; Eurythmics; Queen.

For instance, how did the shot Baby Doll fired over her stepfather's head strike her sister?  As Senor Zoidbergo explained in his excellent review, Baby Doll fired a second shot that grazed her stepfather's arm, presumably passed through her sister, and then struck a steam pipe.  Baby Doll flashes back to the steam pipe being struck in her final moments of clear thought.

4353961,2,B004EPYZU8,"Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung (especially Jamie Chung) are all very hot superbabes.  Watching them defy gravity while kicking some serious CGI arse--while scantily clad, mind you--does wonders for one's libido.  However, the onslaught of eye candy that is the essence of SUCKER PUNCH brings beauty but no substance; this sweet tooth fantasy causes cavities.  Sure, it's a graphic novel brought to the silver screen, but it still fails to deliver any modicum of stability or sensibility.  This belly wobbler is nonstop nonsense that wreaks havoc on suspension of disbelief; it's hard to enjoy all the aesthetic goodies while constantly rolling one's eyes.

Told from the point of view of Babydoll (a platinum blonde Browning), we are privy to the mental unraveling of a persecuted babe about to undergo a lobotomy in a mental asylum.  And the asylum suddenly becomes some sort of surreal brothel, and while Babydoll enchants onlookers while dancing (and we never see the dances) she imagines herself and her fellow femme fatales battling dragons and robotic Samurai and zombies and every nutty thing in between; so the story is an illusion of an illusion of an illusion.  As additions to the super hawt babe cast we find a misused Scott Glenn and underwhelming Oscar Isaac and Carla Gugino (sporting a Russian accent, for cryin' out loud).  The visuals and CGI effects are impressive, yet cannot overcome a lame pizza story with a goofball ending; SUCKER PUNCH at least gets two stars for suckering me to watch the entire fiasco--eye candy and all.

From start until 20 minutes to end, it was an excellent movie. I was already putting together my glowing review of it. Then they almost literally defaecate on your plate.

They get you involved in the characters. They get you involved in the plot. They give you a fantastic series of (CGI)sets to enjoy the allegories. It was fantastic. Then the last 20 minutes they say ""we interrupt your movie to play the end of another one that has absolutely nothing to do with the one you were just watching"". Worse actually. They serve you a wonderful 7 course meal and for desert they pump your stomach. Suddenly things that happen in the brothel world have no relation to what is happening in the real world.  Where before where everything in the brothel was her copping with what was happening in the real world suddenly there were killings in the brothel world for no other reason than to force an ending that had nothing to do with what every single second prior had been leading up to.  Zero.  None.  Not even the same movie or characters.  Childish games of ""psyche"" have much more meaning than the end of this movie.  At least with kids you know it's to be mean.  I can't imagine the writers of this were trying to do that.  So nothing makes any sense about the end of the movie and will have you ranting in frustration for a long time to come.

I will say give this movie a chance. I was channel surfing and came into this movie with low expectations. What I came away with was a thought provoking, mind blowing, visual feast. The movie touches on child abuse, insanity, mortality, eternity, life, death and everything in between. In other words its a movie about the power of the mind. Reminds me of the first time I saw Dark City which I've seen 10+ times since. I absolutely cannot wait to watch this one again. How people can give this gem a 2 or 3 Star rating is beyond me.

But personally I gained a deep feeling from this film. Perhaps I look to deeply into it, and see a deeper message then is portrayed. But it has Emily Browning in it, and I would not be surprised if I married her someday.

The movie itself has a strong influence of music, some sang by Emily Browning herself, that add a nice feel to the movie when used right. The action scenes are the only real lacking area of this film to me. They all feel like they were more focus on making the scenes look really cool, and less action packed. One scene including a train I really felt they took the slow motion fighting too far. Well visually appealing, it doesn't deliver the action feel that five girls armed with guns, swords, and knives should. Which is what keeps this movie from a five star rating in this review. Outside the action scenes though is where I enjoyed myself the most, and where the story really takes place.

I really enjoyed the opening too. Emily Browning sings ""Sweet Dreams (are made of these)"" which plays during it, and it really tells a tale in a pleasing way.

So, would I recommend this film? If you can over analysis a film like I can, then there is a good chance you will. If you are fascinated by the mind, and the potential it has, give it a watch. If your a pure action junkie, skip it and go onto the next.",1327968000,,1455,4.283636363636363

There was no characterization for build up so the climaxes and dangers didn't seem real or important. Plus most of it was happening in someone's head, and it was totally unclear if there were any consequences until more than half way through the movie.

It was more like watching extended fan service. Here's the thing though, fan service is good because you're already a fan of something and it's hidden in between an actual story. This was just a lot of shots of robots and panties and boobs.

I'm not even going to touch how uncomfortable I was by thinking that these women were escaping the horrors of strip clubs by imagining they were dying in a war somewhere to weird techno remixes of old classics. That was...awkward.

I've been told I didn't like it because I didn't 'get it.' No. I assure you I 'got' the shallow, uncomplicated, psuedo-pschological bologna sauce. It just wasn't good or interesting or well written.

As a matter of fact,the small scenes of action we do see in Sucker Punch manage to put a lot of bigger action films to shame in some respects,spanning from fuedal Japan all the way to a futuristic city and manages to fall between Lord of The Rings and World War 2 all around a two hour period. The problem with the action offered in Sucker Punch is that it heavily favors style over substance. Yes the action is great but it plays off more times than not as tongue and cheek. What makes it worse is that it feels like the film makers where either oblivious to this fact or masked it as well as they could.

Pretty much,if you've ever played any video game from the final fantasy series think Final Fantasy X part 2 and this pretty much sums up Sucker Punch. Only this film attempts to take itself way more seriously than the before mentioned game.
The extended cut of Sucker Punch is well worth watching and the cabaret style rendition of ""Love is the Drug"" is worthy viewing several times by itself.

The cool thing about this flick is that it hits several genres all at once. It's a period piece set in the 50s. Dark and with like a steam punk feel. Then you get the first fight scene - think Anime meets Crouching Tiger. um, with a hot blonde rockin' some fab moves.

Then you get a world war I scene, and then a fantasy/castle scene complete with a dragon as the main character, Babydoll, and her sidekicks go on four wild adventures to acquire items needed to escape the hell that they're in.

I suppose this is not the first time I have judged a book by its cover and decided something was awful before every really giving it a chance.  And it is not the first time that I have been completely wrong.  I LOVED this movie.  First off, and without question, it is visually stunning.  Zack Snyder sure can paint a pretty picture.  I thought the CGI was perfect and the atmosphere totally pulled me in.  If you like steampunk you will certainly enjoy this movie.  Secondly, being an action fan, I was not at all disappointed with that aspect.  I guess the easy way to describe the action is by simply saying that it is COOL. Someone described this movie to me as one long music video.  That is somewhat an accurate description.  And the soundtrack is great.  Guess I don't understand all the hate that this movie has received.  Will it win any Oscars? Definitely not for the acting or the script, though those are not at all what I would call weak.  Everyone involved does a good job.  Perhaps most of the critics were like me and judged this movie based on the trailer without actually watching it.  I suggest watching it from start to finish before making any final decisions.  I think it is better than 300, which i felt was overrated anyway.  Just my opinion.  And as we all know, critics are often wrong and who really cares if it wins any awards?  I can think of numerous Oscar-winning and critically acclaimed films that, for lack of a better term, sucked.

I personally didn't care for it, but then, I saw the EXTREMELY BUTCHERED PG-13 version.  You could tell it had been cut all to pieces because of a lot of the scenes just didn't connect, and there was actually no flow at all to the movie.  I don't know if the producer(s) of this film decided he would make a lot more bank on a PG-13 version.  What he did in making that decision was deprive the viewer of what could have been a really different kind of story.

The main character of Babydoll is played by Emily Browning.  She's taken to a psychiatric hospital...but, then, she's not really.  You see, EVERYTHING in this movie is a metaphor.  Anyway, while there she is made to ""dance"" as part of her, uh, therapy.  Seems she can really shake a tail feather because EVERYBODY'S gaga for Babydoll.  Trouble is, we never get to see her ""bump-n-grind.""  And while she's performing, she has visions--and they ain't of sugarplumbs dancing in her head.  Scott Glenn was horribly miscast as the ""Wise Man.""  Babydoll is first introduced to him while performing her first dance.  She then does batlle with Japanese mythical giant monsters and when her battle is over, so is her ""dance.""

I did like the soundtrack.  Bjork's ""Army of Me"" is almost worth the price of the movie alone!  However, I just didn't connect with the rest of the movie or the characters.  I won't completely pan this one, but it didn't work for me.  Perhaps it might for you.",1326153600,,1675,4.4506578947368425

The added dance number was really great and helps add a new level and balance to the film.  I'm glad it was added back.  The visual look and feel of the film is incredible.  The story could use some work though, but not too much more.  I thought the story was easy to follow, understand, and interesting.  The thing I love most about the Blu-ray is the MAXIMUM MOVIE MODE.

And the option to view the additional concept art and photo galleries while the movie pauses, and then continues once you finish, works perfectly and seamlessly.  Zack Snyder and his team did a great job with visuals,story-telling, and creating a wonderfully wholesome and enjoyable film as he always does with his films, mainly 300 and Watchmen. I love this Blu-ray two-disc version of Sucker Punch and it is a welcome addition to my Blu-ray collection.  4.5/5 stars for the film, 5/5 stars for the 2-disc Blu-ray.",1326067200,2,1428,4.823045267489712
4354301,1,B004EPYZU8,"My expectations were wrong.  I thought I was getting a fantasy movie.  Its not.  The fantasy parts are not connected to each other.  In that sense, it contains some fantasy mini-scenes.  I've seen better story line coherence in video games.  The fantasy parts are linear and last about 5 minutes each.  Then its back to this weird hidden psycho-ward of no escape.  Its kind of like Sin City if you imaging that movie without a plot.  But then Sin City does not float between multiple realities like this does.

The worst part of it all is that no time is spent to explain the relationship between fantasy and real worlds.  Or why she has these fantasies.  Its kind of like playing a mini-game inside of a game, in order to accomplish some task.  But then there is no explanation about why the mini-game served to complete the task in the real world.

I found the difference in volume from scenes varied to the point where I had to hold on to the remote to adjust constantly.

But there is no excuse for the ridiculously long amount of time I wasted my life on this film. It was cool, I'll give you that... but it's so flashy and twisted that it loses any form of storytelling and instead wastes hours explaining a very simple point that frankly... by the end of the film was so PAINFULLY obvious you had to have a lobotomy NOT to know where the director was going with it.

The story, the effects, the action sequences, it was everything I could really ask for. One thing I noticed about the people who don't like this movie are actually quite bitter about it. I think it was over their head, and didn't realize that it actually does have a good ending. All the complaints about this movie being degrading towards women is bogus! Yes, women are degraded throughout this film, but that doesnt make it a film that is degrading towards women. If anything, it is the quintessential girl power movie! Every action scene has girls kicking serious trash. One of the final scenes of the movie has Emily Browning (aka Babydoll) kicking a bad guy in the balls. Cmon people! It doesnt get any more girl power than that! Btw, the music in this movie is amazing, and i loved how Emily Browning sang a few of my all time favorite songs.

4354525,1,B004EPYZU8,"WARNING: SPOILERS!

Don't tell me how ""deep"" it is and how ""I didn't get it"". If you dismiss the negative reviews on this film with a ""they didn't get it"", you're as close-minded and condescending as those who dismiss action movies on the assumption that action and CGI can't coexist with intelligent, good-quality films.

I got it all right. And I guess it IS deep... Like the sludge in the sewers is deep.

One reviewer said that this movie can only be appreciated by those who love videogames. I beg to differ. I'm a long-time gamer, but I'd rather suffer through a brutal migraine attack than watch this dreck again. There are actual games that deal with the subject of mental illness and imaginary worlds way better than this so-called movie (American McGee's Alice series, for example). Combined with mediocre acting and dreadful music, this movie is an absolute disaster. Yes, it has some very cool visuals and action scenes, but its visual beauty is completely smothered by its cerebral ugliness. It's all style over substance, poorly conceived and blatantly insulting to the viewer's intelligence. The first fantasy world tells us it's bad to exploit women, and the second fantasy world is a paragon of female exploitation. How does this work? It doesn't! Characters fly hundreds of feet into the air and slam into solid stone shattering it, with not a single bruise or scrape inflicted... Yes, I get it, I get it, it's a fantasy world, but seriously, if we the audience know no one's going to get hurt or killed, where's the suspense? Why should we care at all about any of them?

How can anyone think of this movie as being ""empowering to women"" is beyond me. If anything, it's blatantly the opposite. An underage-looking, scantily clad, heavily made-up nymphet named ""Baby Doll"" who fantasizes about being a prostitute is not empowering to women. Yes, she and her girlfriends kick butt, but they do it in an adolescent male's fantasy world. To add insult to injury, the ""dance"" Baby Doll performs every time she enters this over-the-top videogame fantasy world is quite obviously a metaphor for her having sex with whichever man needs to be ""distracted"" (which is why the actual dancing is never shown). Yeah, nothing empowers a girl like prostituting/being raped! (Now, apparently, there's a plot line about the impending sale of Babydoll's virginity in the extended edition that tramples the sex argument... I haven't seen it, so I can't comment).

It seems that very little thought went into anything here except ""we have to make it look hot to sell it to as many teen boys as we can"". If Snyder cared to do his homework, he would realize that the message this movie seems to promote (whether he meant it that way or not) is actually deeply insulting to abuse victims. The character gets to go to a ""happy place"" where she has power, because in the real world she doesn't have any. If you've ever experienced/survived abuse, it's heart-wrenching to watch, not because it shows the psychology of an abuse victim, but because it shamelessly glorifies it.

Was Zack Snyder thinking about the viewers when he came up with the title for this mess? If that's the case, he must be laughing all the way to the bank.",1324598400,12,3222,4.7859712230215825

Watching the movie makes me want to hear Panic Switch. In addition to Panic Switch, the trailer had Led Zeppelin When The Levee Breaks. Wow! Why weren't they in the film? Instead I get to hear Bjork?  Ugh.

4354531,2,B004EPYZU8,"What the heck did I just watch?  This movie is senseless.

In a nutshell, the hero does various dirty dance routines (presumably - because we never actually see the dances) in order to distract people so that her friends can steal a series of items in order to escape some sort of mental institution that doubles as a brothel.  Got all that?

Why don't we see the dances you ask?  Because whenever a dance starts our hero goes into a fantasy trance and we are transported into a dream sequence where her and her fellow dancers take on zombie Nazis, dragons, robots, etc.  For example, one of the items that they need to steal is a lighter.  Therefore, the fantasy sequence involves the squad of women cutting the throat of a baby dragon, ripping out two fire crystals, and then a chase sequence with the mother dragon.

I'll admit that the fantasy parts are pretty well done.  However, after the first two I found myself asking - ""Is this all there is?  Do I have to go through this two or three more times?""  In that sense, I suppose Sucker Punch is a lot like a vasectomy.  The first one is a bit of a surprise, but the second one usually hurts a little more.  Party because you know what to expect... partly because... well... it's a vasectomy.  Sucker Punch was just like that.  The first cut scene was a bit of a surprise, but then you get through it and have to endure the second one.  Unfortunately, there are more than two in this case and no warm towel to soften you up!  This movie made me want to spend two days sitting on an ice pack.

In the end, I just wondered what the point was.  This movie was just barely good enough so that I didn't turn it off.  That's the only reason it gets two stars instead of one.  One star is reserved for absolute trash like GI Joe.

You know how you can really tell how bad this movie is?  By how much many of the 5 star reviewers spend their time defending it.  Uhhhh... If it was five stars, it would speak for itself, right?  Apparently not, because many 5 star reviews spend time advising everyone how they ""don't get it"" etc, etc.  Yes, yes, yes... the critics were wrong, the poor reviewers are wrong... blah, blah, blah.

This film seems to have had a polarizing effect, a lot like Marmite, you either love it or hate it.  I go with the former and I must admit I really don't understand why it has been mauled by most professional critics.

A hormonal teenager may just see the film as fetishly dressed `hot chicks' going from one video game fantasy setting to another and generally kicking a lot of ass along the way but I'd like to think that most adults would see through this sugar coating to reveal the bitter pill underneath.  Truth is that this is a dark and downbeat film.  Don't expect any happy endings here.

I enjoyed the fight sequences (which I've analysed below). Visually they are a treat with a real sense of scale and grandeur (especially the trenches of the First World War). I have to say that the futuristic bullet train sequence has the films most poignant moment by far.  The soundtrack is pretty good too. `White Rabbit' (sung here by Emilana Torrini) and used during `The Trenches' scene was an audio and visual tour de force.

The `Maximum Movie Mode' extra is worth checking out.  For those that don't know it's just like director commentary but more interactive.  So Zack Snyder talks for a bit, then lets certain scenes play out and then at certain intervals there is the option to view galleries of stills of things like weapons, film sets and conceptual art &c. Storyboards are sometimes shown on screen against the actual final cut of the film as well.

*****MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*****

`Sweet Pea'
`Sweet Pea' is the THE protagonist of the story.  It IS HER story. `Sweet Pea' is a very troubled girl who has Multiple Personality Disorder brought on by the death of her mother, little sister and primarily by long term (but only implied) physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her step-father. `Amber', `Blondie', `Rocket' and `Babydoll' are all parts of her multiple personality that take the form of the likeness of four other asylum inmates.

`BabyDoll's' Dances
When `Sweet Pea' (again in her alter as `BabyDoll') dances, she isn't actually dancing for men, she is undergoing therapy with Dr Gorski.  It is clear that Gorski uses music as a tool of her trade.  The music is used to relax `BabyDoll' in order to get into the state where she is `comfortable' about talking about her past and issues.  You will note that in her first dance, she is nervous and unwilling but as her therapy progresses `BabyDoll' ends up more than willing.  From `BabyDoll's' point of view, through the music she is re-imagining herself as an erotic dancer who provides `extra's' as this puts her in control of her sexuality and body as a willing and consensual participant (although to me this is still a delusion because she is still being used by men). Of course in reality, this was never the case.

The Bordello
This directly relates to `BabyDoll's' (who of course is an alter of `Sweet Pea's) dances.  Through her therapy `BabyDoll' sees herself as an erotic dancer who works in a high class club/brothel.  The Asylum takes the form of this very club/brothel with `Blue' (a fairly lowly orderly in real life) as the club owner/pimp/gangster that controls all of the dancers (who of course in real life are the inmates).  The reality of the situation however is that `Blue' is not in charge in the real world (it is in fact Dr Gorski) but to many of the inmates who suffer abuse at the hands of him and his colleagues, he very much is in charge.  The extensive use of mirrors in these sequences is telling us all not to trust what we see.

Dr Gorski
She is the most powerful female figure in this film and like `Sweet Pea's' mother and the mother Dragon, Dr Gorski doesn't realise what is going on under her nose and act upon it until it is far too late. `BabyDoll' only ever sees her as part of the problem. She sees Gorski as the `dance teacher' of the club/brothel who is controlled by `Blue' and by this association that she must know what is going on and therefore is complicit in the use and abuse of the girls.  In the real world it is only when she finds out that `Blue' has been forging her signature that she then decides that something is very wrong and so she takes action in bringing in the Police to arrest `Blue'.  It is history repeating itself for `Sweet Pea/BabyDoll'.  Just as her mother failed her, so did Dr Gorski.

`BabyDoll's' Weapons
The Katana (more commonly but erroneously called a `Samurai sword') is not only an archaic, bloodthirsty and elegant looking weapon but it is also a phallic symbol.  The sword represents war, aggression and power.  Here `BabyDoll' uses this very personification of masculinity against enemy hordes that take the form of the masculine.  Swords are now mostly symbols of the human past or physical figments of legend, fantasy or myth and so it is of no surprise that `BabyDoll' uses one in her imagination.
The Gun is also a phallic symbol which is all about control and power. It also symbolises aggressiveness, anger and bad feelings.  At the beginning of the film she tries to shoot her step-father but fails miserably.  She certainly doesn't have this problem within her `dream sequences'.  This is her over compensating and righting that wrong in her own mind.
The Katana is actually etched with symbols that tell us the films story and the Gun has similar icons and symbols relevant to her plight but you can find more about that on the `Maximum Movie Mode' extra.

`BabyDoll's' Costume
Her outfit is that of a `Cute' Japanese High School girl.  Over 60 percent of all pornography in Japan depicts school girl related fantasies and about 40 percent of it depicts the sexual assault of these school girls. It is by far the most common sexual fantasy of Japanese men.  Japanese school girls wear their uniforms a lot outside of school hours and even on non-school days.  This is because the uniform is a cherished symbol of their childhood and innocence which they want to wear for as much time as possible before they leave school and have to `grow up'.  This then is the dual meaning/appeal that the uniform has in real life as well as this film.

Note: The other costumes obviously share a similar `sexual fantasy' element.  For instance, `Rocket's' uniform is that of a nurse.  The `nurse' fantasy is a common one and has been used extensively in American porn films.

The `Wise Man/General/Bus Driver'
This is `Sweet Pea's spiritual guide.  He looks like a grandfather figure and in dreams grandfathers represent wisdom and experience. Here `Sweet Pea' is therefore remembering her own grandfather and so the `Wise Man' takes on his likeness.
At the end he is also appears to be `Sweet Pea's' guardian angel (as he helps her evade the police and get on the bus bound for Fort Wayne).
It is also interesting to note that Fort Wayne, Indiana is named after General `Mad' Anthony Wayne of the Continental Army and that after the 1982 floods there, Fort Wayne was referred to `The City that saved itself'.

The Fight Sequences

Feudal Warriors
Here is where `Sweat Pea' (in her alter as `Babydoll') has to defeat three over-sized demonic samurai warriors. I believe this to be `Sweet Pea' realising that in order to get better, she needs to exorcise her massive demons (hence the size of the warriors).  It is also here where `Babydoll', who in fact is a personification of `Sweet Pea's' will is given her weapons by the `Wise Man', the very weapons that could set her free.  The tranquillity of the Shinto Temple and its immediate environment not only represents what should be a safe haven for her (the Asylum) but also the calm before the storm that will play out in her fractured mind. The destruction of the Temple in the sequence symbolises the state of her mind.

The Trenches
The briefing of the girls by the `General' (aka `Wise Man') takes place in the ruins of a Cathedral. This probably represents both the state of `Sweet Pea's' mind, ergo a bit of a wreck and also that what should have been another safe and sacrosanct place has been deliberately targeted and destroyed. This is a metaphor for her home where she was abused and the asylum where she is also being abused.  It may also symbolise her loss of faith in God - What sort of God allows girls to be sexually abused?
The mission is to steal a map showing detailed German troop formations along the front line.  This of course directly mirrors the plan to steal the map of the Asylum from `Blue's' office which shows not only the exits but where the security guards/checkpoints are located.  This is also the first time we see all of the `girls' fighting together. The `Wise Man' therefore advises the girls to ""try and work together"".  This is `Sweet Pea' realising that to regain her sanity and freedom she needs the parts of her multiple personality to merge into one.  The chaos and carnage on the battlefield and in the sky above it represent the conflicts going on in her head.
During this mission `Sweet Pea' saves her sister `Rocket' from certain death, something which she did not do in real life.  This shows that `Sweet Pea' hasn't let go of her little sister and the guilt that she has for her death.
There is a scene in the trench where `Blondie' lifts the helmet of a British soldier to reveal a traumatised looking teenage boy.  `Sweet Pea' looks briefly at the boy and then looks down and away.  This is `Sweet Pea' acknowledging that `boys' are also used and abused by men and are victims too.

Dragon
The scene represents the issues that `Sweet Pea' has with her deceased mother.  The killing of the baby dragon within the fantasy sequence represents the sacrifice of an innocent for a greater cause but for `Sweet Pea' it also represents her childhood and innocence being taken away from her by her abusive step-father under the nose and roof of her mother.
In the briefing, the `Wise Man' instructs the girls `not to wake the mother dragon'.  This makes a lot of sense within the context of the fantasy sequence but in the real world I think it has more sinister connotations as this is `Sweet Pea' recalling the sort of thing her step-father would say to her before he abused her while his wife/her mother slept. It is also a warning about what might happen if `Blue' finds out about her plans. The death of the baby dragon whilst its mother slept symbolises the abject failure of `Sweet Pea's' mother to protect her from being abused by her step-father.
The killing of the mother dragon represents not only the death of her mother but also of `Sweet Pea' punishing her for not protecting her in the first place and for turning a blind eye once she `woke up' and was aware of the abuse visited upon her eldest daughter. `Sweet Pea' therefore cannot forgive her mother for what she didn't do back then and for what has happened to her ever since.  I think `Sweet Pea' blames her mother more than her step-father for the abuse she has suffered and for the situation she currently finds herself in.  It makes me wonder whether `Sweet Pea' is also directly responsible for her mother's death in some way.

Distant Planet
This is the only mission that the girls fail. The scene itself is a metaphor for `Sweet Pea's' impending lobotomy. After the procedure `Sweet Pea' will look like she's `on a distant planet' and mentally she will `be on a distant planet'. The futuristic city represents `Sweet Pea's' brain, the bomb on the train represents the fact that time is literally running out for her and the train itself represents the Orbitoclast that the Doctor will use to strike her brain.  In this action sequence her sister `Rocket' dies (as she did in real life).  This is `Sweet Pea' realising that her sister is really gone and that there is nothing she can do about it. This is `Sweet Pea' finally letting her beloved sister go. At this point `Sweet Pea' realises that there is only one escape route for her now.

The `escape' and `lobotomy'
`Sweet Pea' only escapes the asylum/brothel in her own mind.  In reality another inmate escaped.  Dr Gorski tells the Doctor that has just undertaken `BabyDolls' lobotomy that (paraphrasing here) ""she started a fire, stabbed an orderly and helped an inmate escape"".
So in real life `Sweet Pea/BabyDoll' did indeed start a fire, stab `Blue' and helped an inmate escape. `Helped' is a key word here.  It was never `Sweet Pea's' intention to physically leave the asylum as she was too vulnerable and unstable to survive out there and live anything like a normal life.  The whole `BabyDoll' creating a distraction for `Sweet Pea' to escape thing is `Sweet Pea' literally giving up, losing her will to resist her lobotomy.
Now I am not sure whether in the real world `Sweet Pea' did actually work in tandem with the unseen inmate that escaped or whether she just had a bit of a psychotic episode which in all the chaos that followed this, it allowed another inmate to escape.
The sex scene with the `High Roller' (who in real life is the Doctor) I believe is two things.  The first is her `deflowering'.  Deflowering here in the sense of her being lobotomised as he is taking away everything that makes her the (very troubled) person she is. So he wants to be sure that she actually wants it.  Of course `he' wanting to make sure is just `Sweet Pea/BabyDoll's mind accepting its fate. The second is what you see on screen. Therefore, `Sweet Pea/BabyDoll' imagining what it would be like to actually have consensual sex with a man, or in more flowery terms `to make love'.  Something that she has never experienced (only sexual abuse) and something that in her lobotomised reality she will never feel or experience.
Finally, `Sweet Pea' getting on that bus and it driving off down a straight road, in a rather bland environment is `Sweet Pea/BabyDoll' in her new lobotomised state.  This is her `freedom'.

Well, that is my take on it.",1321315200,12,14002,4.64531820024321
4354611,2,B004EPYZU8,"Director Zack Snyder has a keen sense of visual style. His films are a visual feast for the eyes: 300, Watchmen. Sucker Punch is no different, but for me, where it has a lot of style, it is missing substance.

Browning plays Baby Doll, a young girl institutionalized by her abusive stepfather. She dreams an alternate reality in which she is in a dance hall/whorehouse, and devises a plan of escape. What makes it more crazy, is she creates another alternate reality, within the alternate reality. Whenever she is supposed to be dancing, she's actually fighting alongside her fellow inmates against hordes of demon Nazis searching for the things she needs to escape.

I can see how writers Snyder and Steve Shibuya are trying to make something out of all of this, how we sacrifice for those we love, but it's just an excuse for a creation of another fantasy world where all the sexy girls are dangerous assassins, carrying big guns and samurai swords. They kill demons, fight a dragon, and blow stuff up.

These action scenes are pretty cool, but as they exist as a coping mechanism of Baby Doll's incarceration in a mental institute, they are incidental and unnecessary. Just an excuse for action scenes.

Ultimately, Sucker Punch feels like two different movies jammed into one. But, unlike peanut butter and chocolate, they just don't go together.",1321142400,3,1350,4.856521739130435

4354861,4,B004EPYZU8,"I just rented this on VOD and I can honestly say I am presently surprised (yes that is a play on words).  The movie is not for those that are looking for a realistic movie, but it touches on some real emotions and feelings (like attractive women and the need to watch crap get shot, sliced and blown to pieces by them).  Here are the pro's and con's and hopefully it will help you decide for yourself.

Pro's
1) Imaginative with lots of fun twists
2) LOTR grade battle scenes (specifically the CGI and point that in those movies a mere humans can take down a 50 ft tall elephant) with intense action (I'll touch on this in con's too)
3) Hot Girls fighting in skimpy clothing
4) Very interesting comic based plot
5) It's unreal so you can enjoy that it is going to have unbelievable fight scenes with crazy CGI and awesome explosions (yeah, it isn't based on a work of non-fiction... shocker that this is not really a biography)

Con's
1) Fight scenes are semi-repetitive, but unique enough to be intense
2  Not going to spoil it by going into details) Ending is kind of trippy and you have to really think about what is going on (some people don't like to think)
3) Hot Girls fighting in skimpy clothing (some of you may not be into that or think that it is a cheap trick to get you interested)

My expectation is that if you like 300, final fantasy, Babylon AD, Sin City, Chronicles of Riddick (all or one), LOTR (fight scenes), you probably will like this movie... then again what do I know.

For those that hated this movie, you are certainly entitled to your opinion and I am sure people appreciate it... Take comfort in knowing that there is an amazing possibility that this movie will never have a sequel (this is coming from a fan).",1319932800,2,1739,4.381987577639752

You have to think about what is happening in front of you and why it's occuring.  That's right, a movie you MUST think about to comprehend.  It's a relatively new, and for me, refreshing concept for Cinema.  And unless I'm just hopelessly dense (which I've admittedly been accused of) it will take you 2-3 times of watching to form an idea of what's going on.  Much like the hit-movie Inception)

Visually, one of the most eye-catching, awe-inspiring pieces of visual candy I'd EVER witnessed.  The explosions, creatures, monsters, dragons, women, surroundings - all beautifully and purposefully done in a way that one would IMAGINE in their mind...one would conjure up, to replace the terrible reality that had been forced upon them - in this case main character, Baby Doll.

Audibly, an unbelievably matched set of songs that FIT the movie in such a way that it feels as if the movie was written for them!  The absence of a single one of these would've detracted from the sense of purposefulness.  Each coming in at the exact moment they should and all combining for a seemless interpretation of events occuring before your eyes.

For me, to really understand what & why, I had to think back to when I was fighting Storm Troopers (tree limbs) at the age of 8 in a forest on my way to rescue Princess Leah.  It takes that kind of mental open-ness and flexibility.  If you're not up for that kind of investment than don't bother.

4354865,2,B004EPYZU8,"I saw the Trailers, and noted the overall rating here on Amazon so I decided to give it a shot - despite some bad things I'd heard.

This is somewhat a fairly dark/creepy (insinuated sexual abuse) Movie right from the start. It's a bit difficult to follow at times as it's a somewhat disjointed venture.

You've basically got three themes running throughout this picture, and it takes a bit sometimes to see where they're connecting or overlapping.
You have reality, which is really pretty dark and not totally logical, an altered/enhanced (dressed up?) reality which is the main theme hooking in the fantasy reality theme.

Reality:
It's dark and a bit disturbing as I mentioned at the beginning, but it's also not really logical - to me it's really quite a stretch to see how she ends up being committed to an Insane Asylum.

Altered Reality:
Not quite as dark, but it's presented as a managed brothel where the girls are essentially slaves with no say or way to escape.
This brings in the dancing thing, where whenever she dances we hook into the fantasy part which impacts reality/altered reality - I guess her dancing is supposed to hypnotize everyone or something, I don't know.

Fantasy:
This is what you see in the Trailers, and is the real draw of the movie, with the only drawback being that this girl just suddenly becomes some super uber Martial Arts/Fighter without having any training/exposure to it what so ever - maybe all that was cut on the editing floor, who knows, but it was a disappointment.

[Spoiler]
The plot in the end, doesn't even end up about her, she's just a vehicle to help someone else escape.
In the end she end's up getting an Icepick Lobotomy (without Anesthesia no less) - like they still do those these days, especially after only five days in the Asylum.

I wasn't really crazy about the music.
A fair amount was some shreds (maybe shredded would be more accurate) of better known songs, where I'm guessing the target audience is more of the Punk scene - just not for me.

The two star are primarily for the Fantasy portions of this movie, they were decent, it's just too bad they couldn't have been wrapped into a better package than the overall Movie.
I've no doubt this will probably end up with a Cult following, it was too dark and had too many holes for my liking though.",1319414400,,2316,4.604368932038835
4354866,3,B004EPYZU8,"Basically ""Sucker Punch"" is an $80+ Million laser light show; projected laser beams set to music (in this case nicely produced by Marius De Vries and Tyler Bates).  This type of entertainment was quite popular in the theaters during the 1970's (see ""Freaks and Geeks"") as a psychedelic entertainment (Pink Floyd, ELO, Blue Oyster Cult).  Laser light was useful in entertainment because the coherent nature of laser light allows a narrow beam to be produced, so optical scanning can draw patterns and images on walls, ceilings or other surfaces. Reflected beams can be bounced to targeted positions with mirrors to create laser sculptures.  Focused minds are held spellbound by the focused and concentrated light rays.  With the advent of computer generated special effects, recreational drugs like ecstasy, and polysubstance use (kitty flipping anyone?); the light show has evolved into a feature film form.  ""Sucker Punch"" being one of the most ambitious.  One segment of the audience connects with this experience and another one does not, then both get on the internet and lament their disbelief that others are showing so much hate (or love) toward the film.  Few find a middle ground as illustrated by the paucity of three star ratings.

In the case of ""Sucker Punch"",  far more were disappointed than were impressed.  Much the same reaction occurred with Tim Burton's 2010 laser light show titled ""Alice In Wonderland"".  So if you hated that film you would be wise to avoid ""Sucker Punch"".  Although liking Burton's film is no guarantee that you will like ""Sucker Punch"", as Burton is a skilled acting for the camera director and there was simply no indication that such a skill set was present during the production phase of ""Sucker Punch"".

At about the 25 minute mark of ""Sucker Punch"" I was beginning to believe that it was something special.  In just 25 minutes the film had taken its main character (nicely underplayed by Emily Browning) through three stages of madness.  I was expecting this progression (or descent) into madness to continue in the manner of a high budget and surreal homage to Polanski's ""Repulsion"" (1965).  That is as a hellbound train that never looks back; with it's heroine's point of view fracturing in a steady progression of more bizarre realities.  Unfortunately, ""Sucker Punch's"" train spent itself in those early minutes and spends the remainder of the film disappointingly vacillating between the 2nd and 3rd stages of madness, before mercifully bookending itself with a return to the 1st stage.

The problem is that by its nature a laser light show lacks or struggles with certain cinematic elements; like audience to character identification, sensuality, suspense, and challenge to the imagination (there is nothing to imagine when the fundamental construct is one of visual illustration).  Which is fine if you connect with what it brings (in place of these missing elements) to its audience; like off-kilter production design, dazzling special effects, eye-popping action. But it is important for a viewer to be aware of the nature and limitations of this type of entertainment if they are to avoid frustration and disappointment.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1319241600,3,3225,5.104761904761904
4354867,4,B004EPYZU8,"Every so often a movie comes along that gains a poor reputation for no apparent reason.  It becomes the target of unfairly harsh criticisms on the part of cynical mobs of professional and ""armchair"" critics alike.  Such a movie is Sucker Punch, one of the most visually dazzlingly and narratively experimental action/fantasy movies of all time.

Let me begin by pointing out its only real flaw:  It isn't long enough for the story; which means there isn't enough time to fully establish its group of femme fatales. Even after seeing the much better extended version, I still feel like the characters needed more ""down time"" to breathe and interact between the insane action vignettes that are its main attraction.  The theatrical version seems stiff and remote because of this, although it is significantly improved by the extra footage in the extended version-- just not as much as you would want. I think Sucker Punch would be stronger overall if each of the five main girls were fleshed out (not a pun) a little more.  Perhaps as little as ten extra minutes of characterization would have helped.  Anyway, that is my only legitimate gripe.  Stay tuned for a comically illegitimate one later on.

As you might imagine, the visuals in the movie are awesome.  That is at least one thing the movie's detractors will allow it: it looks and sounds amazing.  The battles are well-staged and exciting, and I find it hard to imagine that anyone could not be entertained by watching these particular scenes.

If you are confused about the nature of these scenes because you have seen video clips here and there of giant samurais, machine guns,  World War II planes, dragons, etc.  then I have a simple explanation:  each of these scenes is an metaphor.  That's it.  They aren't dreams or visions,  just wildly imaginative metaphors for each stage of the girls' struggle to escape from the asylum they are forced to live in. Some people find this difficult to understand.  It isn't.

Now, I will address one more thing before I close.  There have been charges that the movie is chauvinistic and degrading toward women, that the girls are dressed scantily all the time, that the movie panders to drooling neanderthals who only want to see T&A, etc.  Well, fortunately (and unfortunately), this is not the case.  During the action vignettes, the girls are dressed only mildly inappropriately for the conditions of the fight-- by which I mean, you might see a bit of thigh or midriff, but they aren't wearing chain mail bikinis ala Red Sonja.  Their fight-scene garb should not raise any eyebrows.  During the ""real"" part of the story, which I forgot to add is the first layer of metaphor that blankets most of the movie, the girls are metaphorically in a 1920's style club where they have to entertain the rich and significant.  Well, not much of the movie actually deals with their interactions with patrons, or their dancing for that matter, so you still end up not seeing that much T&A even when logically you would expect to see a fair amount of it.  So, the movie under-delivers on this score and yet is unfairly said to contain too much of it.  There is no nudity in the entire movie, I might add.  Sucker Punch has a solid R rating, but only because of stylized violence and language.  Sin City has quite a bit of nudity and scantily dressed vixens, yet this is generally not counted against it in reviews.  Anyway,  as I was mentioning earlier about a comically illegitimate complaint, it is only that given the R rating and the fact that you have five dazzling girls as leads in a shady dance club, it is oddly disappointing that you never do see anything truly tantalizing.  Yes, I know, silly of me to mention it, but I'm sure someone was wondering.

In closing, I think Sucker Punch is a really entertaining and innovative action-fantasy movie and deserves far better treatment that it has received thus far.  Don't miss out just because of the critics.",1319155200,5,3955,4.740849194729136

The story nested us into the various imaginary scenes very well (ala Inception) so that was easy to follow. The visual cues at the start told us too much perhaps.

Just sit back and watch the effects!  As a woman, I do get inspired by all the fight scenes.

Baby Doll (our heroine) is trapped in a mental asylum.  She does things to try and escape, but what we see is a second layer that takes place in a brothel.  Then there is a third layer of a dream world that Baby Doll goes into when she dances.  Again, I love how weird this movie gets.

The dream world has a lot of interesting sequences-- fighting stone samurai, fighting german steam powered corpses... etc... it's all very random and great.

The film is an exploitation type of movie-- girls with guns in sexy outfits.  There is an underlying theme of sexual exploitation in this film, but everything is PG rated.

Don't go in with expectations or you will end up asking way too many questions about the logic of the movie. Some movies are made to entertain us  and ""Suckerpunch"" does exactly that. Although they killed off my favorite character with the train ride, all is forgiven.

  I enjoyed the fantasy scenes, I am hoping that Abbie and crew make a second part to this movie. I want our lead character to exact vengance on all her oppressors. That is why I am hoping for a sequel. I am sufferring from the ""I got more questions that need answering"" syndrome, and I am hooked on the visuals. I also like the music score I think it fitted the scenes perfectly.  The female characters were cool to watch during the fight scenes kinda Matrix like in the right places. So yeah, buy the DVD  and put it in your favorites section of your collection. The more I watch it, the more fun it is to watch, in it's predictibility. All you need are your favorite snacks, that comfortable chair or couch and it's on.

  There is nothing wrong with a little predictibily, especially when it is designed simply to entertain us for awhile.

Ultimately I believe the film is about empowerment and how we are all born with the weapons needed to empower ourselves to take action. The message is delivered in two very stylized worlds which may be where the problem seem to have is. One world is more like Moulin Rouge with bright colors and musical numbers. The other is a gold colored world of kick ass action sequences set in varying geek-bate locals. Maybe I liked the film more than most because I like action movies as well as musicals.

4354968,5,B004EPYZU8,This movie has become one of my favorites. Once you get over the fact that the main character looks like a 12 year old you can get into the highly original script. It takes some understanding to know whats going on in the film but if you can figure it out it is very entertaining. All the action scenes are very well done and the story is very meaningful and complex with an empowering message.,1317340800,,394,4.266666666666667

4355090,2,B004EPYZU8,"""Sucker Punch"" gets so close - it really does. For about 50% of its duration - it absolutely rocks. Employing visuals that borrow heavily from Guillermo Del Toro's ""Hellboy"" and The Wachowski Brothers' ""Matrix"" (falling empty shell casings, running up and down walls with big guns and even bigger swords) - it serves up huge action set pieces that come at you with the breathtaking audacity of a Punk band doing their first gig. But I'm afraid that's where the good news end, because there is also so much 'wrong' with this film...

The story goes something like this - the principal female character (the permanently soppy-faced Baby Doll played by Emily Browning) has five days to escape before the 'High Roller' comes into town and has his perverted way. Baby Doll and her fellow inmates are then instructed by a wise warrior (Scott Glenn) to gather up 5 items from 4 battles - a map, a knife, fire and a Key - the fifth item being an unknown - a mythical thing that will set them free if only Baby Doll can recognize what it is. It helps of course that the heroines look like a SEAL team from St. Trinians - tooled-up twenty-something nubiles with protruding cleavage, laced-up leather bodices, frilly skirts and Cheerleader ponytails.

It all sounds like great fun - and as I say - in parts it is. But all that hard-won admiration goes right out the window when we encounter the real world and the 'other' storyline...

The girls are really in a Vermont Sanatorium - orphaned and under the watchful eye of a violent slimeball called Blue (Oscar Isaac). The Lennox House for the Mentally Insane is a place where cruelty is an institutionalized norm and use of their bodies a lucrative side business. To alleviate all of this authority-ignored abuse of the inmates, Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) teaches each pretty young lady how to dance and thereby 'escape' to where there is no fear and they are free. ""...That place can be as real as any pain..."" she wisely councils them - poncing about the theatre area in her own ludicrously provocative outfit that's a composite of teacher, Madam and slut. And as you can imagine - it's these slyly staged scenes that will sorely test the patience of even the most open-minded of viewers. I hate to come across like an old prude here - but the 'girlpower' theme is so obviously exploitive - and worse - the film is blatantly guilty of voyeuristic sleaze it supposedly abhors.

But that's not the worst part - there's sickening cruelty doled out by men on the girls. Instead of empowerment of women we get assaults in kitchens, beatings in offices and lap dancing for grotesque male patrons. And ""Sucker Punch"" somehow seems to gloat on it too. It smacks of appalling hypocrisy and has of course caused an outcry in the States (as did the graphic violence to children in the sick ""Watchmen""). Women's Groups everywhere may quite rightly feel that Director Zack Snyder needs to be taken outside - given a good slap - and told to grow up.

It's a damn shame because you can't help but think that with some obvious rejiggering of the plot - put all the fantasy action sequences together in one go with the Asylum stuff at the end - thereby giving you a big reveal and also giving the girls a freedom of sorts - Snyder might have indeed produced a genre masterpiece that actually said something into the bargain. The actresses themselves could also be accused of being 'suckered' into such an obvious mix of titillation and torture, but they were probably having too much fun swinging around on pulleys to notice.

""Sucker Punch"" is not a movie I'm going to watch again willingly - let alone buy - and it's hard to forgive its staggeringly convenient theme about the empowerment of women through sexy clothes and fighting. But some of those action sequences are great and some may feel it's worth a rental for that alone.",1316908800,,3857,4.6398243045387995
4355091,3,B004EPYZU8,Lots of action and beautiful girls but story is kinda lacking.  I did not leave the theater thinking wow great movie.  It was ok and would make a decent rental.,1316649600,,160,4.3
4355092,2,B004EPYZU8,"There are some creative writers who shouldn't direct. Though I like ""Love Actually,"" the lengthy romantic comedy would have been much better with a director other than Richard Curtis. There are also some creative directors who shouldn't write. Visually dazzling as it may be, ""Sucker Punch,"" for which director Zack Snyder himself wrote the original story, needs a better writer.

After the film's introduction that tells the back story of a young girl nicknamed ""Baby Doll"" (Emily Brown), we are ushered into the Lennox House, a mental asylum where Baby Doll is locked up by her abusive step-father and will have to undergo a lobotomy surgery. There, as a way to escape from the grim reality, Baby Doll creates a fantasy world of her own, where she and four other heroine (or ""dancers"") - Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone) and Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) - will fight the WWI German zombie soldiers and dragons.

The screenplay by Zack Snyder and Steve Shibuya looks like a whimsical assortment of ideas they came up with brainstorming. It does not even try to explain why Baby Doll has to fight three giant samurai in Japanese temple. Scott Glenn shows up as The Wise Man, telling her to collect five items to be free, and that's all. Well, I really don't care these things as long as the film offers some creative and original ideas, which it fails to do.

Let's face it. For all nice costumes of the heroines, most things you see in the noisy CGI-heavy battles are derivative. The idea of Baby Doll fighting a giant samurai, which should be given more originality, soon becomes stale with unimaginative combat styles that you saw somewhere before. A bigger problem is that initial excitement fades soon because in the fantasy world (or the ""real"" world) there is no one to root for. The visual extravaganza is like watching someone playing the video game.

Clearly the players did a considerable amount of training for the stunt, and you can see that in their fight sequences. They deserve a much better film.",1316390400,2,2046,4.82051282051282
4355093,4,B004EPYZU8,"Even though I am from the U.K. and have already purchased the U.K. release,I just had to get this version.

Why? I prefer the packaging on U.S. releases and they don't have HUGE age certification all over the packaging. Anyway, less rambling more reviewing.

Sucker Punch is a movie that is broken down into some gorgeous action scenes featuring beautiful women with a 'thinner than a thin thing on thin day' plot trying to hold it all together.

It's almost as if Zack Snyder made cut scenes for a video game that was never released and stuck them all together. Visually stimulating and a treat for the eyes, if you like no brains-required action movies then this is for you.

I'm not gonna waste time trying to describe the plot, as I said before it's wafer thin.

4355096,5,B004EPYZU8,"""Sucker Punch"" had to have been one of the best movies that I've seen in awhile. Despite many negative reviews that other people may have said about this movie, I found it to be engaging, mystifying, and thrilling. I especially enjoyed watching the ""fantasies"" that Baby Doll imagined, one of my favorites being the World War Two steam-punk zombie scene. :)",1315872000,2,357,4.868852459016393
4355097,4,B004EPYZU8,"The first time I watched this, I was amazed by the effects work and the story was a bit by-the-side. But the next day I started to think about the movie more and more and in the end went out and bought the extended cut to watch again. The extra footage helps the story along much better than the theatrical cut and I like the fact that this isn't your typical Hollywood sunshine-fest of happy endings, unicorns and flowers. I know American audiences like the sickly sweet taste of the happy ending but it's really just not necessary in every movie.
So yes, this is a dark movie and the other reviews will tell you more about the plot and extra scenes and so on, but I think this is a sleeper hit. I know it wasn't big in cinemas but I think as word gets around it'll do some decent sales on DVD and BluRay. The story is good (not brilliant), with a good conclusion and a good message - you're in full control of your own destiny. The method by which we get to that conclusion is fantastical and brilliant. Yes, the movie is deep in eye candy for the guys, but the effects work, wire work with the stunts and fight scenes, and the overall look and feel of the movie is brilliant. If you're looking for a good bit-sized example of what I mean by the ""style"", cut to the end of the dragon fantasy sequence where BabyDoll jumps into the air and the camera travels along the blade of the sword, then zooms out to frame her against the dragon's fire in super-slow-motion before she drops to deliver the kill.
A couple of words about the sound and picture quality - all top notch with very few dark moment compression artifacts. The sound is good, the music is well balanced and the overall audio presentation is pretty nice. The only downside is the digital copy has some noticable compression artifacts in it in the darker scenes but then it is showing you the same movie with less than one quarter the information so you can't expect miracles.

Conclusion: if you're into more cerebral sci-fi and fantasy, this is worth a rental at least. If you want to see the sun come up and everyone skip home holding hands with jaunty music at the end, best look elsewhere.",1315699200,3,2157,4.365671641791045

4355160,4,B004EPYZU8,"Rumor has it that the extended version fills in some holes of the story or at least adds more details. That said, you're either going to decide this is a picture that wanted a bunch of attractive women in sexy clothing running around with Katanas, guns and other such things that go bang or you're going to see that this over the top action picture is trying to say something more of the human experience even if it isn't always elegantly presented. And it really is an over the top action picture in the spirit of a video game or high octane action comic book/graphic novel. The special effects are colorful and brilliant even if they don't always tie in to the story and viewers not familiar with comic books or video games will be put off and/or confused by the sudden shifts into the fantasies of a young girl who is going to be lobotomized in five days (it actually is a fantasy within a fantasy at times). In fact, probably less than 20 minutes are real time and most of the tale takes place in the dreams/perceptions of the main character who is trying to escape with her fellow inmates. The over the top action girls were clearly trained so they don't look dorky and the acting is above average or better mostly though some of the themes are too much on the noise at times (you're your only limitation so ""fight!""). By the way, don't expect a happy ending here. It's bittersweet at best. Most of the fantasies tie in to the real story five elements for the planned escape but they show it sometimes in a confusing or off manner so people not watching intently will miss it. Extreme feminists are claiming this picture exploits women as sexual objects and nothing more but they're dead wrong. Critics have mostly been negative towards the film and the North American Box Office total has been disappointing but it has done all right overseas and I'm sure the DVD market will help it along.

4355162,4,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch is one of the more divisive ""geek movies"" that has come out in a long time; those that love it REALLY love it, those that hate it dismiss it as stupid and pandering. The biggest problem facing Sucker Punch is that it is a damned peculiar movie. Nothing is spelled out, and you pretty much have to make up your mind over what is really happening in the movie. For people who need clear-cut narrative, this kind of movie is probably a nightmare. Those of us who like to soak up a movie will find Sucker Punch a pretty rich treat; there is enough texture and substance packed in to every frame to satiate the visual appetite of any fantasy film lover.

Geek culture is having a field day gnashing their teeth over whether Zack Snyder has any merit as a director. Let's be honest; Sucker Punch is not going to win any awards for story. There is one there, but it is wrapped up in a visual tapestry that makes it completely irrelevant. The color palette for the movie is lush, the effects are nothing short of jaw dropping, and the set pieces are any anime enthusiast's dream come true. Have you ever wondered what a battle between a B-52 and a dragon would look like? Give Sucker Punch a try. You'll get that, and quite a bit more.

The Extended edition is close to 20 minutes longer, and includes the entire song number between Blue (the skeezy intern that seems to run the asylum) and Carla Gugino's character. Some of the battles are longer, and the narrative of the story flows a little better. Some of the intensity of the extended cut ups the stakes for the characters, and the delineation between reality, escape, and fantasy is a little easier to navigate.

Ultimately, Sucker Punch is one of the most audaciously original movies to come out of Hollywood in a long time, and like Moulin Rouge before it, was pretty thoroughly reviled. Snyder is a daring director, and he put a lot of effort into making a daring movie. If anything else, it should have served as an effective palette cleanser for him before he tackles Superman.",1315526400,,2044,4.504043126684636

4355165,5,B004EPYZU8,"I often read the reviews at Amazon and Netflix, but this is the very first time I've felt compelled to write one.  That's entirely due to this movie, every second of which I found to be mesmerizing and top-notch.  This is truly a fantasy masterpiece.

Based on the number of reviewers who, for reasons I'll never understand, seemingly didn't like it, I can't wholeheartedly recommend this movie to everyone.  Moreover, this movie would be unsettling for younger children, and I wouldn't recommend it for early teens either, due to its dark overtones.  But to me (and presumably others like me), this movie is a multiple orgasm of visual and auditory bliss, and an elevation of the action/fantasy genre that borrows the best of the elements in that genre and from them weaves together something unique.

It takes the slow-motion over-the-top fighting seqences from marshall arts films and the arresting visual graininess of movies like 300 and Sin City(without being overdone).  It is a marriage of photography and CGI ala Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (but not so animated as Beowulf).  It is a fantasy within a fantasy within a broken reality, reminiscint of the Matrix. Shutter Island, the Sixth Sense, and Inception.  But above all, it is its own, a consolidation and a permutation, raising the bar by culling the very best from what we have so far while infusing some new inspirations (and a whole lot of writer/director Zack Snyder).

The movie snob that lives inside my head compels me to point out that plot and storyline take a back seat to the audio and the video, existing primarily to provide a platform for the images and music, which perfectly compliment each other.  Don't get me wrong, there is a story here, it's just that the storytelling is not of the usual style.  It's a kind of a visual shorthand, done in such a way as to keep the viewer involved and the movie moving forward without getting in the way of the incredible imagery and dynamite, rocking soundtrack (which contains refreshing and inspired covers of some of the great rock tunes of yesteryear).  Like most action movies, the characters don't develop.  Instead, they're deftly executed snapshots of people, not simplistic but satisfying and sometimes self-mocking, done exactly as they should be done for this movie.

The movie makes a statement, perhaps several.  And it's all put together seamlessly, with ingenuity, taste, and a perfectly aggressive, non-stop pacing.  Unfortunately, it would appear that Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder deserve far more recognition than they're going to receive, but mark my words, this movie will continue to gain a following, and will go down in history as a mainstreamed cult classic in the same league as the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Firefly/Serenity.

4355166,4,B004EPYZU8,"Using an uninspired plot gimmick as an excuse to throw a number of attractive young actresses into a series of video game style battle sequences could easily have made a terrible movie, but in this case provides a surprisingly thought-provoking offering.  The film manages to work in enough plot to provide the action scenes a sense of purpose while, at the same time, acknowledging their hokiness.  The action scenes are very well crafted, and avoid the current tendency to run on too long.  The recent clich of overusing inconsistent progress of time, however, is only too well represented.  The visual imagery makes good use of the available CGI technology, and in some instances the artistic composition and use of color are superb.

The entire movie adopts thematic elements from such a wide range of earlier films that it is hard to single out any particular one; it is likely that video game enthusiasts will catch an equal number of references missed by this reviewer.  It does appear incongruous that so much of the protagonist's imagination is expressed in terms of modern video games despite the story being apparently set in a time before even Pong on the Atari.  In a film so meticulously crafted, that does not appear to be an oversight.

The film's intended message of personal empowerment is largely undermined in that the only tools given Ms. Browning's character appear to be violence and sexual appeal.  Violence is clearly shown as having undesirable consequences (a message that more action films might do well to adopt).  The message to young women of self-determination through being alluring to men would be much more offensively misogynic if the film did not clearly acknowledge and criticize its own exploitive nature.  At times, the abusive asylum setting appears to be offered as a metaphor for how the entertainment industry treats its female talent.

The would-be inspirational message is also muddied by a lack of clarity, and could well be interpreted as suggesting that one should persevere by taking refuge in fantasy.  There are enough distractions from life that one hardly needs any encouragement to further ignore one's surroundings; it is easy to miss out on genuine experiences if one wastes too much time watching movies on DVD, and perhaps wasting even more time reviewing them afterwards.",1315008000,,2331,5.054830287206267

The sound is well balanced; most happens in the front to keep your attention, with just enough surround to create that immersed feeling.

If you like the CGI of '300' or 'Sin City', you'll like this.

If you like scantily clad women kicking a**, you'll love this.

While there, Babydoll learn to go into her imagination in order to devise an escape plan. Along the way, she's joined by inmates(Sweet Pea, Rocket, Blondie and Amber) who work together to escape the hellhole they're in before her stepfather(the Highroller) returns to get her.

I'll admit, I'm a big fan of Snyder's films. I have faith in his talent as a Director. Yet, for some reason, this movie just didn't do anything for me. Aside from plenty of eyecandy and cool visuals(as visually, it's stunning), there's not much here to be interested in. It lacks soul and you just can't get invested in the characters. I don't know whether it was wooden performances given by everyone or the fact that there's not much story to go on or what. I just know that I was somewhat disappointed in this movie.

Keep in mind, however, Sucker Punch isn't an awful or bad movie. It's just not a good one.  So, unless you're a Snyder fan who collects all his movies, I'd steer clear of this one. It's a good timewaster but nothing else.",1314662400,2,1163,4.502369668246446
4355334,1,B004EPYZU8,"What a monumentally stupid movie. Given all the negative press, I went in with low expectations, hoping at the very least to see a visually cool bit of entertaining action fluff. But Sucker Punch couldn't even get over that rather low bar, expecting audiences to take its bad writing, bad acting, unoriginal/overdone slo-mo effects, and ridiculous premise as serious, metaphysically weighty drama -- yes folks, you're supposed to CARE and THINK DEEPLY about those underage uzi-and-fake-eyelash-toting hookers shooting zombie Krauts in the face while sporting sequined Sailor Moon outfits! Forget ""The Matrix,"" this movie has even grander and dumber ambitions, fashioning itself as something like a new version of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" only with 100% more CG dragons and ninjas.

Even most of the music is offensive, with some of rock's coolest tunes butchered in distractingly bad fashion by newer acts (including the lead actress, whose bad acting can be partly excused by the awful script, but whose weak take on Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams"" is nobody's fault but her own). Using the original songs would actually have helped the movie a little bit, e.g., the epic-carnage-loving geek in me might have enjoyed seeing a helicopter shoot missiles at a moving train if the song playing in the background had been the awesome original version of the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" (one of the more bada*s songs of the '60s) instead of a lame cover by new indie artists who shoulda known better.

Look, I am by no means a movie snob -- I love good action flicks whether they're thought-provoking or terminally dumb, so long as they're entertaining and don't insult the audience's intelligence. But this multimillion-dollar turkey is not worth even renting. And don't get me started on all those five-star commentators who spend much of their reviews deriding the many professional critics and theater-goers who panned the movie, lamenting that we didn't ""get it."" Newsflash, folks: just b/c we think the movie is a piece of crap doesn't mean we didn't understand it, so why don't you keep your reviews focused on the movie itself rather than on people who disagree with you? If you loved the movie, fine, that's your prerogative, just don't get offended when the majority of other folks who gave it an honest shot still came out hating it.

Oh, and one more note of the ""what coulda been"" variety: in the future, if director Snyder can embrace the ridiculousness of his scripts and run with it like Tarantino (e.g., like the mayor's brief entrance scene, which has a certain winking, self-aware bravado to it), he might actually be able to create a film that will stand the test of time.",1314662400,5,2696,4.986666666666666

Not sure what anyone was thinking when this movie was put together. And I love Grade B movies, usually even the bad ones are worth laughing at. Not this one.

It looks nice, especially on Blu Ray. The CGI is pretty. But what about THE PLOT???

Don't waste your time with this. Take a walk or a nap or go have a drink and figure out something else to watch.

4355337,4,B004EPYZU8,"I have read the myriad of negative reviews of this film and while I agree on some points there are others that I think have been missed here.
The story is tragic.
I try and not tell too much about the storyline as I want people to know how well the movie was done and how it made me feel and leave the story to you, but I feel compelled here given what I have read.

We have a young girl who has been victimized over and over again.
Taught that she was a sexual object.
Taught that her sister is a sexual object.
Who knows about Mom, as you will see early on.

She is unjustly committed to an institution (this all happens in the first six minutes of the film).
Here she meets her allies.
Here she meets her foes.
All things in black and white (good versus evil) for this young victim and rendered beautifully through the eyes of one young lady.
Here she meets her fate.

She has a decision to make: take control or be taken control of...""fight.""
""If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything.""
This is what she does with the faculties and power that she has.

I won't tell you how, but I will tell you that it is beautiful to watch.
Art house/playhouse meets foreign flavor and an incredible CGI ride.
The music is not to be missed and pulsates through each scene.
If you feel baby doll (our protagonist) you will pulse with her.

Each scene is amazing to watch and draws upon various works to paint its picture.

You will forget it all swept up in the mind of the persecuted dance until the final moments of the film when reality returns to roost.

Some say this movie is all about the beautiful cast.
Some say it is about the CGI wrapper.

I say that it is the very simple depiction of a very complicated issue beautifully rendered and tragically told.
Look deep into the eye of the monsters and see what she sees and then tell me...do you see nothing?
Nothing...is what she seeks.

I even waited for it to come out at redbox to see it.  About the movie, the opening sequence was really good, probably one of the best openings i have seen in awhile.  After watching that though, the movie takes a huge spiral down.  The main character Baby Doll is put in a mental hospital, she dances and gets put in this world where she can get hit by a two story samurai made of metal, going about mach 1 into a house, pretty much destroying it and then gets up and is all ok.  If your confused , don't worry i was too.  After that scene I knew she would never be in any real danger and that this world held no rules or consequences for anything that happens in it.  Yeah I know its a world created by her, but really doesn't make for good drama when the main enemy force of this movie can hurl you like a cannon into a house and you live.  My final thoughts on the film are that is was made to combine to awesome things into one movie, awesome fighting and an all hot chick cast.  They got the all hot chick cast down in my opinion and the action sucked though in my opinion as well.

4355450,4,B004EPYZU8,"AFTER HEARING SO MUCH BAD about Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch, I really expected to dislike this movie. However, I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by what I've watched and this is the theatrical cut of the film I'm talking about (I've seen at least three deleted scenes exclusive to the BLU-RAY on YouTube and it's simply up to my mind to fill in the blanks when I watch the movie on DVD and those particular scenes happen to be missing).

For the most part, I think I'll just skip over my opinions on the all the Feminist arguments and follow-the-leader ""I'll compare to this movie to a movie that came out a year earlier"" commentary that I've seen on around the internet. I'll simply say that for the most part, I think most of the things said about this movie are in fact valid as far as Feminist critique is concerned. Zack Snyder, try as he might, doesn't understand feminism and empowerment for women and shamelessly attempts to cover his fantasy behind a flimsy veil of fan service and a love for how certain types of anime depict females. It wants to subvert the degrading ways women are depicted in media, but it fails in every way possible on this aspect. But is the movie bad because of it? No, not really. It's more embarrassing than anything because it reflects just how badly feminism is misunderstood and seen by general [male] populace on a whole.

However, when it comes to knocking an otherwise enjoyable action flick for being an ""Inception"" / ""Matrix"" ripoff, this is where a lot of the complaints lose me. People did the same thing with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PUSH/dp/B001OQCVI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PUSH</a>&nbsp;(2009)"", a sci-fi/superhero movie (I that I loved) that  has almost nothing in common with 2008's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JUMPER/dp/B00177Y9ZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JUMPER</a>"" (a poor adaption of an otherwise great sic-fi novel by Steven Gould) outside of the ""Evil Organization out to get the protagonist"" plot and what movie doesn't use that theme? Sucker Punch has superficial similarities to ""Inception"" (who's concept is by no means as original as its EXECUTION) and the ""Matrix"" and that's where the buck stops.

If I have anything bad to say about this movie it's the fact that you cannot skip the DVD Advertisement to get to the DVD Menu (at least on the Rental DVD version). There has to be a told of six to ten minutes worth of BLU-RAY-COMING SOON-NOW ON DVD ads shoved down your throat and you can't skip any of it. That aside, the storyline is as simple as it gets:

[A girl, codenamed ""Baby Doll"", and her unnamed little sister have suffered the loss of their equally unnamed their mother and are left with a rotten stepfather as their guardian. When he discovers that his wife has left everything to her two daughters, he throws a fit and decides he's going to have his way with the oldest girl. However, when she rebels, he locks her in her bedroom and goes after her little sister (who ends up evading him and locking herself in a closet with his keys). In a panic, Baby Doll exits her bedroom through her window and reenters the house armed with a gun just as the stepfather kicks the closet door open.

However, she misses her intended target and kills her sister instead. She's understandably grief stricken that she's robbed herself of the one person that mattered to her and is left with the one she could do without and run from the house. The cops find her at her mother's grave and her stepfather gets her admitted to a presumably all-female insane asylum where she awaits a lobotomy in five days. However, Baby Doll has no intentions of waiting to a hole punched into her head and enlists the help of four girls (Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber and Blondie) to get her and themselves out of the madhouse. In order to do this, they need five items (a Lighter, Map, Key, Knife and one unnamed item that will be the decider of how the plan goes), but all of them are under the guard of those who would keep them locked inside the madhouse (or brothel, depending how Baby Doll depicts her reality).]

Other than that, the enjoyment of the movie hinges on how well the actresses perform and how much you enjoy stylized action sequences straight out of an anime realized by someone who knows how to blend the overtop with visually stunning universes out of a fantasy book and not detract from the overall point of the movie. And with that, for a movie that literally runs on the fuel of a screenplay written by himself, Snyder does a good job. He gets the point of his tale across better than most would be willing to admit. It's certainly not the tasteless and fetishized movie a lot of people made it out to be.

When the characters interact with one another it doesn't come off an contrite or something made to kill time between action sequences; on more than one occasion, three out of the five female characters have a actual conversation with each other and the movie is better for it, I think. The relationship between sisters, Rocket and Sweet Pea, as unexplored as it is, for me, was the most genuine part of the movie. The actors Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone, made me believe that they were siblings on polarizing ends of a situation that was guaranteed to fail if something went wrong.

However, the one thing he does fail on is the entire concept of a Sucker Punch. Granted, it's no surprise what happens to Baby Doll (they show it at the beginning of the movie for goodness sake), but Between Scott Glenn and Jon Hammm, I'm not sure who gave away the meaning of the entire ending more. The Doctor/High Roller or the Wiseman who likes quote Grandpa from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jackie-Chan-Adventures/dp/B00005O5BN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jackie Chan Adventures</a>""? If I was surprised by anything it was how abrupt the cut between the close up on Baby Dolls face to the lobotomy needle was, other than that, one of the two the characters I wanted to see get out of that place alive, did and therefore I was content.

I, for one, enjoyed all four universes created by Baby Doll, paricularly the Medieval Japan and Futuristic city that bookend the first and final acts of the movie. The action sequences, complemented with a impressive soundtrack of varying sounds and styles of cover songs or remixes of the better known singles of days gone bye, are executed with perfection. The music video feel of it all works well with the interpretation that Baby Doll's dances are interpreted by her mind through violence and a way to achieve her goals which coincide with one another.  I'm not even disappointed in the fact that we never get to see her dance as that was never one of the things I was dying to see in this movie.

The acting for the most part is good. Emily Browning isn't a terrible actress, she gets the personality (or lack thereof) and determination of Baby Doll's character across to the audience rather well, but if anything she was one of the weaker performers of the primary cast. Vanessa Hudgens doesn't do a bad job in a movie that is basically her way of trying to become an adult in the wrong way most young actresses tend to do, but she isn't awful until she tries to cry on screen.

The actress who plays Amber isn't given anything to do except play wingman for most the movie and therefore has the weakest performance in the movie because she isn't given anything worth its weight in significance. Honestly, the strongest actors in the movie are Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone, who are given more do in the action and non-action sequences any of the other girls combined, especially if you adopt the idea that the tale of the movie is basically a story told in the second person narrative and the story is really about the two sisters (the oldest in particular). I was a little more than misty-eyed at one particular scene between the two (in both realities) just because of how they performed.

The orderlies and doctors were just there, I really had no emotional investment in any of them and therefore really can't comment on them other than to say, the orderly-turned-pimp's mustache was the only thing I could look at when he was one screen and, yes, indeed, the Polish accent for the doctor is something out of Rocky and Bulwinkle, but it's hardly distracting in any sense that it's bad. At least the actress is consistent.

All in all Sucker Punch is a good movie that does a excellent job of blending fantasy with action and anime with live-action (even if that was unintended or not even a thought in the visual effects artists mind). The movie is a beauty to look at on every level possible. Snyder's direction is competent, but it's nowhere near what he did for ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""Watchmen"". I don't think Sucker Punch is great by any means or that I'm even in love with it, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. [4 Out of 5]",1314057600,2,8990,4.742802303262956
4355451,4,B004EPYZU8,"REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILERS! I felt that I needed to review this film to counter all the analytics with absolutely no imagination whatsoever. This movie was thoroughly enjoyable for those few of us who are creative, inspired and artistic. With a very original plot (how many movies coming out of Hollywood can make that claim these days?) it opens up a world that is almost as creative as the Matrix. Maybe not quite as intricate, but I felt a breath of fresh air from this film's sheer creativity.

Since almost all of the epic fight-scenes were taking place in the mind of a character, it was absolutely open-ended. There is nothing to say that one CAN'T fight a dragoon with a WWII-era airplane. Or go into battle against steam-powered zombie Nazis in a mech from the future. Let's face it. Many of us that had over-active imaginations as a child used to DREAM about this stuff. There is a Calvin & Hobbes comic where Calvin is playing with his toy dinosaurs and introduces an F-14 fighter jet into the fray, piloted by a T-Rex. Hobbes, ever the realist and grounded one, thinks it is stupid. But the child in us all related so well to that comic because we all wanted to break the rules and have T-Rexes attacking triceratops and stegosauruses with a jet. We did it. Transformers would join in the action-figure battles with X-Men and a GI-Joe here and there in a Lego city. What I am getting at is that it was all in her MIND. So why is any of this stupid?

Maybe you felt immature letting your imagination loose and embracing the child within. Maybe you felt emasculated by it even. Or maybe you just lack the ability too imagine something so ridiculously crazy-awesome, that it made you insecure. Who knows? Who cares, though? This movie was, for me anyhow, the epitome of FUN, and in the end that is what movies are ALL ABOUT: entertainment. So look for a sophisticated plot if you'd like. You aren't going to find it here, and like Calvin's clubs, we don't want you here anyhow. We want people who like giant Samurais fighting with mini-guns. And T-Rexes in fighter jets. Because we just want to be entertained and have fun!",1314057600,3,2130,4.558746736292428

The only thing original about this one was the use of five women as the key characters; three blondes and two Asians.  The casting really did not matter here, the script was just bad.

4355585,3,B004EPYZU8,"This movie really goes where many movies have gone before.  It tries to be a deep story of an abused girl (Sweet Pea) whose stepfather puts her away in an asylum to cover up how he attacked her and her sister after their mother's death. During her attempt to save her sister, she accidentally kills her, brining much guilt. So now the rest of the movie is how does she live with this and escape from the asylum and gain freedom. They layer the story from here 1. real world asylum, 2. burlesque type act showhouse, and 3. War Scenes.  Many corney lines, a plot that is way to predictable, and a bunch of young girls in skimpy outfits.  That pretty much sums up the plot and movie.  In between, there are many CGI action sequences which are not that special in action, and play much like a video game, and integration wise between live actor and computer (blue screen), there have been better movies made.  All in all, I'm dissapointed I purchased the blu-ray. However, it appears the extended cut tried to fill in some of the gaps, and did so well, and I thought flowed better than non-extended cut.

4355590,4,B004EPYZU8,"I think that Sucker Punch is a much better and more interesting film than many critics give it credit for. I don't, however, think that the subtle machinations of the plot layers are the point of the film, or should be used to intellectually justify it by saying ""complex=good"". For me, this film is less an intellectual exercise than a stream-of-consciousness expression of emotion; it's about feeling powerless, and escaping that feeling through fantasy. The mechanics of the plot are just there to support the emotional content.

After the plot's complexity, the most controversial part of the film is the ""video game"" action sequences. Honestly, I am a bit iffy about them conceptually, as their relationship to the main plot is extremely tenuous, but to my surprise I found these sequences mostly very engaging and even moving. The exception to this was the sequence that most needed to be emotionally engaging - the train heist. It might have been because it was poorly directed, or because I was worn out by the preceding action scenes. Whatever the reason, I found this part just didn't work. It's the one big flaw of the piece.

Another controversial element often mentioned is the skimpy outfits the heroines wear. I don't think the allegations of sexism are valid as generally stated. If women are working at an exotic dance club, it is natural that they would ""hang out"" in their costumes or in their underwear - this is pretty much standard for back-stage behaviour. I didn't find the photography at all leering. What might be questionable is the fetish outfits* the heroines wear during the ""video game"" sequences. This is part of a wider argument about the double-image of feisty female protagonists, going back at least to the Alien movies, and I don't think Sucker Punch will solve the argument conclusively for either side.

Maybe these diverse criticisms are inevitable if you try to combine accessible contemporary action with arthouse explorations of plot and emotion. But Snyder deserves points for trying, and succeeding as much as he has.

3.5 stars

(*And of course by ""fetish outfits"" I don't mean kinky leather, but outfits containing certain elements which have become iconic to the video game-playing, anime-watching generation (i.e. sailor suits, samurai swords, aeronautical goggles, etc.). Failure to comprehend the iconic nature of these and other elements is the main reason older critics disliked this film. The question of what meaning these symbols possess when stripped of their original context is an issue so big I won't even attempt to deal with it here.)",1313625600,,2596,5.05607476635514

While some reviews complain about the lack of emotional connection to the characters, I don't believe that it's because there was a lack of development, I think that it was because the connections weren't all warm and fuzzy for what might be the heroines.  There were character flaws even with them.  Which I believe to be a harsh reality in itself, and I enjoyed as opposed to the typical Hollywood hero.",1313539200,,620,4.651376146788991

4355724,1,B004EPYZU8,"I like Zack Snyder, I really do. But it appears he's only good at adapting other material into films. When it comes to his original ideas, they don't translate well into film. I adored his director's cut of ""Watchmen"" and his vision for ""300"" but ""Sucker Punch"" is a film I wish to forget.

I saw his panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic Con and was excited for the film. I should've known better. I was told by moviegoers to not have any expectations going into this film because they would be crushed. I waited until the home video release and was so glad I only paid $1.50 at Redbox instead of $10 at the theater (even at $1.50, I feel cheated).

First off, the story is incoherent and not interesting at all. You don't connect with the characters nor care about them. The plot is a bore and most of the movie I was rolling my eyes and would rather stick my head between my legs than continue watching. The only good parts are the ""dance"" sequences where there's action and that's not saying a lot. There's not a lot to be said about the film other than it's cinematic garbage and one of the worst things to come out of Hollywood. Name any movie and it's probably better than this.

Additionally, the movie soundtrack was great as the fight scenes were perfectly choreographed to the music and the music was perfectly picked for the fight scenes.  The story line for this movie was pretty good, was intriguing and was very fast paced.  The action and fight scenes were fast, were exciting and kept you wanting more and more.  The ending to this movie was great; it added a nice twist and was not blatantly obvious.  I do have one particular complaint about this movie; basically, the characters were not developed enough.  Even the main character was not developed.  All we know about the main character is that she was sexually abused by her stepfather and that she tried to kill him.. end of story, and even worse we know less about the other girls... Yes, the character development absolutely sucked!  I do wish that the director would have expanded on this more than he did.  I notice a lot of people complaining about the ""misogyny"" and the sexualization of the women... get a grip on reality! Sex and violence sells.. Attractive girls blasting and chopping through hoards of goblins, undead, dragons or anything for that matter will sell and ultimately film is a business and is about what sells most.  Lastly, the addition scenes in the uncut version are great.  Many of the fight scenes were expanded and were made even more stunning, the final scene with the ""High Roller"" was expanded and elaborated, and contained a phenomenal juxtaposition of human sexuality, freedom and human emotionality.

The main plot of the movie follows a girl who is abused by her step father and whom she tries to kill.  She is brought to a 1950s era insane asylum.  Throughout the movie the girl disassociates herself from reality by creating intricate fantasies and by ultimately dulling the pain of her reality through visions and fantasies of self empowerment.  In essence the girls who she is locked up with, plan an escape from the asylum but they need to obtain 5 hard to get items to do it.  The end provides a real twist and adds a third layer to the ultimate plot.  I don't want to expand any further than this in risk of ruining the charm of the movie.

Many of the persons who underrated this movie complained about plot holes and the like, and how shallow the movie was.. I think that there was quite a bit going on, and that ultimately the movie was more than a comic book movie, but instead was a post-modern expansion of how the human mind deals with pain and psychological stressors by disassociating themselves from them and by creating fantasy worlds to live in.. Truthfully, this is not farfetched; I would say it was a pretty accurate portrayal of this type of behavior.

I think that you should definitely check this movie out as it was very well thought out and was very well done.  The CGI was great, the action was intense and the movie was visually stunning.  Ultimately the movie was a blend of elements of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Shutter Island"", ""Kill Bill"", ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""300"" all in one movie.  I think it is definitely worth seeing, and for me it was an enjoyable guilty pleasure.",1313366400,5,3330,4.724913494809688

You will see a group of young women in stylized fights scenes with Nazis, dragons and monsters set to cover versions of classic rock songs. If this sounds exciting, you will like this movie. If you're ""not sure"" when don't watch it. This movie has a very specific audience and many will ""not get it."" However those that ""don't get it"" shouldn't have bought it in the first place.

After pondering upon the matter for two hours, during which I was subjected to a noncohesive sequence of CGI scenes, I think I can safely conclude that, indeed, it does.  Further inquiry would reveal that some presence of acting aptitude might have a distinct impact on one's viewing experience.  The title is clearly a cruel pun directed at the viewer and the dialogue appears to have been written by a trained monkey using an Etch a Sketch while she was actively participating in a feces fight.

The special edition is worth getting for all of the extras that it contains, and is probably better than the combo pack (unless you have a ton of friends who doesn't own a blu-ray player or you are currently do not have a blu-ray player, but are considering buying one).

The movie doesn't have too much, if any, plot. Sure, I said it, but I still love it simply because of Snyder's visual style and music and feminist message. Almost every piece of music during the fight scenes are performed by women (and some are even covers of songs written by men). I think it is, aesthetically, a great work by Snyder.

4355863,4,B004EPYZU8,"Abused, exploited, and falsely-imprisoned girls are looking for a way out of Lennox House insane asylum in lovely Brattleboro, Vermont.  Baby Doll, the main character, and her svelte companions are on a quest for freedom.  Simple enough.  Just go with it.  Let the CG fantasy worlds wash over you.  Rock and roll to the rattle of machine gun fire.  Watch Baby Doll get busy with her samurai sword and stainless steel handgun.  Enjoy the gorgeous faces (and figures) of Jamie Chung and Vanessa Hudgens.  Again, just go with it.  Don't analyze it to death.  Towering samurai warriors, steampunk zombie soldiers, orcs, and terminator-type robots... all getting whacked by a contingency of young commando babes.  There's a lot of visual goodness here.  If you paid for and then disliked this movie, you didn't do your homework.  If you think Fight Club or American Beauty are ""important"" films then something like Sucker Punch may be a bit too straightforward for you.  To the director's credit, Sucker Punch never becomes preachy (like Avatar), and it doesn't pretend to be more than what it is (like the overblown Matrix Trilogy).  The plot rambles much less than the second Transformers film (Revenge of the Fallen) and you'll care more about the main characters, especially Rocket who befriends Baby Doll and then deliberately makes the ultimate sacrifice.  If you liked Underworld Evolution or The Crow you'll probably like Sucker Punch.

The movie gives you exactly what you should expect in abundance: entertainment with rich visuals, highly-stylized characters, and thumpin' beats.  The film is a mixture of A Series of Unfortunate Events (unwanted orphans with inheritance), Inception (dream sequences), Resident Evil Afterlife (machine guns, zombies, sword play), and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (with Baby Doll being Randle McMurphy and Sweet Pea as Chief Bromden).  Or you could simply remake the Shawshank Redemption with battle mecha and Mila Kunis in lingerie with the fighting skills of Jet Li.  Then add one big dragon, a snazzy bad guy named Blue, a statuesque Polish psychotherapist, and a brooding Gotham City atmosphere.  Many reviews mention the sexual aspects of the film.  Except for the skimpy outfits and moderate innuendo, the movie is not overtly sexual.  There is an element of fan service, but no nudity or even a love scene.  There is only one kiss in the movie and it's stolen.  The theatrical cut is rated PG-13.  Many rap and pop music videos are considerably more tawdry than this movie.  I also find it odd that a few negative reviews call the movie ""pornographic"" without also mentioning the really disturbing bits: a little girl (Baby Doll's sister) is killed by her greedy sadistic stepfather, and later in the film two young women are shot to death at point-blank range in cold blood (no graphic details are shown, but it's still very disturbing).",1312848000,2,2887,5.04862579281184

My only disappointment was that while much of the story is centered on the young girls dancing, we never get to see any of her dancing. Liked this one a lot.",1312848000,,464,4.32183908045977

4355952,3,B004EPYZU8,"This is a tough film to review. It plays on three levels, one conscious, the other two sub-conscious. Most of this films plays on the two sub-conscious levels, which are indeed pure fantasy. To me it's the major flaw of the film, although in truth, the best parts of the film are in the fantasy/escape parts. Seems our heroine isn't really that tough, mentally or physically in the real world, so she creates two separate worlds in her mind, that allows her to escape her real fate. Now the pure fanboy/action sci-fi fan in me loved this movie for what it was, hot chicks in cute/hot outfits, kicking butt, against everything you/I could imagine. Unfortunately none of it is really real, making the film tedious and predictable when the guns, knifes, and swords are put away.

Now I've never been much of a gamer, so I wasn't sure if I'd like the look of the film at all. Visually, this film is simply stunning. By far the best part of the film, with the action scenes coming in second. And I will give props to Emily Browning. For such a small women, her action sequences and fight scenes in this film are really good. I mean I'm not sure how much of it was really her, and how much may have been CGI, but I was very impressed by her. Be interesting to see if she does anymore actions films soon.

The SLOWMO KING is back and I loved every minute of it. The Ladies in this film were impressive the martial arts training they received paid off. Action scenes were flawless and breathtaking.

What people don't understand is the scenes in the brothel aren't real either, so they are being abused during all of that. Also when baby doll is dancing, it's safe to assume she is actually being forced to have sex, and is detaching herself from that horrible reality into the fantasy world of the fighting, whereas the whole experience is traumatic enough that she needs to create the burlesque dancer world just to cope with the day to day, then the dancing to cope with the sexual abuse, see? it's not like we haven't seen movies or shows with women action characters shooting guns scantily clad, that's not new.

Now.  Did I completely understand it?  Not even hardly.  And all I can say in favor of its originality is that it ""appropriated"" from interesting sources (especially anime, videogames and music videos) and made good use of them.  But it so excels in three specific features that I'm willing to forgive a lot, because these are features that matter a lot to me (if they don't matter to you, you might hate it):

1) It is visually stunning.  That alone will never make me like a movie, but it sure can make up for some uneven performances and thin plotting--which ""Sucker Punch"" also contains.  But the look of the thing paved over enough other weaknesses that I could appreciate...

2) ...an awesome soundtrack.  The action and eye-popping settings were well-wed to some wonderfully creative takes on classic songs from Queen, The Eurhythmics, Jefferson Airplane, and Bjork, among others.  It even closes, after some of the credits, with a fascinating little duet version of Roxy Music's ""Love is the Drug.""

What, for me, distinguishes ""Sucker Punch"" is its...

3) ...surreal and complex storyline.  Did the ending undercut the entire meaning of the film?  I think it did.  But did it?  I don't know.  Was the story uplifting or nihilistic, or worse yet, messianic?  Again, not entirely sure.  And I love that.  It hasn't let me go yet.  I might end up realizing that I've been ruminating on nothing--that there is ""no there, there.""

This is basicaly Twilight for guys. The film feels like a 100 minute video game trailer, and it's unbearabley boring. With an ending that's beyond predictable.

I can't stress enough it's mindless. The special effects are great, but as Matt Stone and Trey Parker said, (special effects are not story)

You also never see what actually happend sicne 99% of the film is a make beleive pretend world. Which leaves a lot open to interpretation.

Also the subplot with her evil father never gets resolved.

Their is also the logical flaw, Since it requred Carla Gugino's signature to give a labotomy, how could labotomy's be going on in front of her that she did not sign for and she not catch on until numerous ones had bean performed. Think about it if you had to sign for them and one was being doen right in front of you would you not realise hey Ididn't sign for that?",1311811200,10,1513,4.592592592592593
4356218,4,B004EPYZU8,"We rented Sucker Punch on standard DVD from Redbox today and it was quite an experience.  It was a visual orgy that mixes my AP English Composition teacher's sadism with music videos, Alice in Wonderland, and a JapAnime-Loving teen's wet dream all together into what is basically a 45 minute film, story-wise, that stretches out to almost 2 hours as a result of a handful of metaphorical sequences that have little to do with the story but create opportunities for the Zack Snyder Film Team to show what cutting edge technology and visionaries with keen eyes and healthy imaginations can do for movies.  It was visually striking on my big TV so in Digital 3D on a big theater screen I bet it was breath taking.  While the visuals were fun, the movie DOES actually have more than meets the eye (as far as I can tell since I just finished watching it and have not yet read anything beyond those opening week reviews).

There are 4 levels to this movie:

1. Reality in a Asylum (1940-1955 era when lobotomies were being performed)
2. Drugged reality in the Brothel
3. Music-fueled, dancing imagination-wars
4. Metaphysical super-reality that includes and transcends 1, 2 & 3

In the first level (the 45 minute story part) the movie is about 2 young women.  One experiences a family tragedy which cascades her into the asylum and kicks off the drugged, 2nd level of the movie.  The other woman was already at the asylum and is the key to the development of the metaphysical level of the movie.  It is the intersection of these two women that provides the structure to everything and I think much of the initial poor critical reception that I saw during the first week was probably due to people missing this.

The second level kicks off shortly after the arrival at the asylum once the mind-numbing drugs are introduced.  The perceived reality shifts to that of a brothel populated by unwillingly held women and the handful of low-life males who control them. It is in this world that all the relationships are forged and the plans are drawn for escape.  A key component to executing each portion of the plan is the distraction dances that the lead girl does while her accomplices carry out the escape plans behind the backs of the gawking men.

The third level, the dancing imagination-wars, is what we are presented with when the distraction dances are done. Rather than watch an actual dance number, the viewer is transported to a visual interpretation of the dancer's emotional and psychological state. The dancing imagination-wars have Lord of the Rings-style castle sieges (complete with orks and dragons), Samurai Giants in Feudal Japan, WWI steam-punk trench warfare, and future-scape iRobot terrorists on floating bullet trains... and the heroines dive into all the battles using modern automatic rifles, swords, knives, and some other small arms that look like they were plucked out of various points in history.  If you have ever dreamed of modern paratroopers dropping in to reinforce Aragorn and Frodo, this is your chance to see just such a lop-sided battle... with the bonus of the cleavage-heavy reinforcements skull stomping while wearing cute mini-skirts.  All this takes place with some pretty decent modern rock music fueling the artistry of it all.  Bjork was one of the featured, which left me scratching my head, but aside from her infamous vocals it worked well enough.

The fourth level runs concurrently with everything else that is seen. Taken by itself it is only a few minutes long and everything else in the movie is simply its supporting argument. The Wise Man/Commander/Angel (Scott Glenn) (with the help of the narrator) takes care of telling this portion, laying out the thesis statement in the opening scenes and the closing statement at the end while also physically appearing throughout, tying the whole mess together.

I liked this movie for 2 reasons: It was sci-fi, fantasy, gun blasting action with respectably good acting from the hotties AND it fed my brain something to think about on the level of the fun stuff we were agonizing over and writing about back in AP English.  If you hated writing English papers you might not ""get"" this movie enough to appreciate it... or if you hate noisy action flicks, you probably won't get past the gratuitous eye candy and overwhelming audio in order to study the brain food. While it isn't as deep as Watchmen, it is cut from a similar cloth, so I'd wager that Watchmen lovers will enjoy this.

My only gripe is that it is a PG-13 movie that deals with very dark themes that are obviously hard-core R. I'm not complaining about the lack of gore or nudity (they wouldn't have improved the movie), but there is no way I'd let my kids see this when they hit 13.  I would have been upset if I had unknowingly taken a young teen to this at a theater.

It isn't getting 5 stars because it has low re-watch-ability. It is amazing, beautiful, well executed and thought provoking, but it is a bit like Pan's Labyrinth or Watchmen in that, at its core, it is NOT fun and its darkness does not beckon for a second viewing.  I'll stick to ""Star Wars"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Ella Enchanted"" for multiple viewing movies.

4356219,3,B004EPYZU8,"Remember Pan's Labyrinth,how the little girl in that movie had wild fantasies and lived out fantastical events?  It's pretty much the same idea here, although they took it a step further and put imagination into imagination.  There are three levels going on here:

First Level(Reality) - the girls are in an insane asylum
Second Level (Fantasy A) - the girls are trapped in a burlesque house type of deal
Third Level (Fantasy B) - the girls are a team of fighters; the events in this fantasy are guided by events in Reality and Fantasy A.

The movie starts off with a bang and then slows down so much it makes you wonder if you have the right movie playing........However, it picks up again and eventually provides a satisfying ending.

One of the annoyances of the movie was the BLARING soundtrack during the fantasy sequences.  A little less would have been better.

It's kind of a women-take-revenge-on-evil-men-flick, and there are some gorgeous CGI effects, but halfway through I was already ready for it to end. After a while it felt like the whole thing was just a set-up for selling the accompanying video game. It's a comic book, true, but even then one wants characters with more than comic book depth to them.

And when the incredible effects almost always end up in brutal violence, it gets old and wearing pretty fast. Just because the violence is women killing men doesn't mean it isn't gratuitous. Is this the future? Women becoming as idiotic and blood-hungry as men? Wonderful.

It was so very interesting and had us riveted to our seats during the entire film. But... It was too dark for my tastes. I was expecting something a little different. I had lots of moments during the film where PTSD (from abuse) slipped in and made it such that I did not want to finish watching the film.

Personal junk aside:
The film was expertly shot, the angles and transitions were superb, and the camera motion never distracted me from the ""living in the movie"" experience I always get with films like these. I like plot twists, and this one delivered a few nice ones.

This was sort of like a modern Twilight Zone episode with excellent FX, killer song covers, and convincing actors.",1311552000,3,778,4.50354609929078
4356225,5,B004EPYZU8,"After the critics mostly negative reviews I was a little skeptical going into this flick.  Sucker Punch has a lot going against it from the beginning...young women in skimpy outfits.  I think that many people made a judgement call and couldn't get over it.  In my opinion this is the same as judging a book by its cover.  As I watched the film, in the theater, I was increasingly impressed.  By the end of the flick I didn't notice how the women were dressed, I was completely taken in by the story. The story is what impressed me the most.

In a nutshell a young woman loses her mother and is left in the care of her step father.  The step father doesn't have the best of intentions towards her or her younger sister.  In self defense the young woman accidentally shoots her sister.  The step father claims that she has gone nuts and has her committed.  In order to keep his secret and to keep their inheritance, he pays a crooked employee at the asylum, to have her lobotomised.  The lobotomy will be performed in only a weeks time.  In that week she is introduced to the other ""inmates"" and it is shown that the crooked employee is selling the young women for sex.  How would you deal with these situations?  How would you cope?  This is where Sucker Punch shines.  It is a movie about coping and it clearly shows how these young women overcome such horrendous circumstances by not allowing their minds to become broken...Awesome!

From a technical stand point Sucker Punch delivers.  The special effects are crisp and truly epic.  The soundtrack is arguably one of the best features--Emily Browning sings a stunning rendition of Sweet Dreams. The music throughout adds to the aura and the sound effects are seriously something to behold on a nice sound system.  The tactics used by the actors are some of the best I've seen and these young actresses should be praised for their hard work.

Overall I really enjoyed Sucker Punch and recommend that you watch it for what it is, a great story about coping and overcoming horrible circumstances.  My wife ended up liking the film, though she still doesn't like how the young women dress!",1311552000,2,2137,4.597883597883598
4356226,5,B004EPYZU8,"I sincerely believe that reviewers should be more honest and simply decline to write about films that they don't understand because the only problem with this film is that some people just don't get it.

They only see the gun-bearing hot girls in anime-like clothes and automatically assume it's a brainless visual feast. Well, it IS a visual feast but it's WAY more than that, and by the way, the hot girls CAN act. The problem is that many people are not accustomed to use their brains during films. If it is outside the formulaic storytelling structure that most films use, it's automatically considered bad.

Sucker Punch isn't a film to be simply watched. Like  many works of art it has to be experienced, felt. One reviewer wrote on the web that the director didn't know where he was going, which couldn't be farther from the truth. The whole movie works much like all fables, through the use of metaphors you see a character undergoing some hardship so as to teach us useful lessons in the end, and for those who missed it, the point, or if you prefer, the moral of the story, is clearly stated in the last narration, and this one is particularly aimed at those who are down, depressed and feeling like the whole world is against them.

4356227,5,B004EPYZU8,"Yes, you read my title and rating right.

Sucker Punch is probably the most visually appealing bad movie ever made.

I see where the director was trying to take the story.  I understand what he was trying to do.  He failed.  Miserably.  Beautifully.  The pretentious dialogue, which would have detracted from a really great movie, at the end was even the icing on the cake and was the final cringe before the credits rolled.

Personally, the movie would have been much better if the girls had been wearing skimpier clothing.  They were far too covered up and in the end, detracted what could have been an interesting suspenseful T&A movie.  It fails.

Disjointed fantasies could have worked if they were tied together with some plot more than ""we need a map, fire, a key, a knife and some really good drugs so we can make it all work.""  Sadly, it doesn't.

Baby Doll is such an amazing dancer, everyone sees her fantasy.  Except that we never see her dance.  Not even at the end.  Perhaps white girl can't really dance?  Who would have known.

Unfortunately there is no extreme in this movie except for extreme CGI.  It could have been really good.  Unfortunately all it really becomes is a teenaged JO movie that was too afraid to go in any direction and holds itself back at every turn... that it had none.

The beauty of the movie is lost from direction and scriptwriting that was too afraid to push it away from a PG-13 rating.  I never saw the theatrical cut and after watching the extended cut, I never want to.  All I know is that this movie tops the hall of shame and is ideal to present to friends when there is nothing better to watch and want to cringe on how beautiful a horrible movie really can be.

I wish the director would have sat down and watched a few truly disturbing movies and decided to take it off the worn path.

For what it's worth, Terry Gilliam's Tideland is one of my favorite movies.  At least Gilliam was able to push the movie in a direction that none other have gone and wasn't afraid to do it.  Sucker Punch could have been one of those movies that everyone will remember.  Instead, it'll fit nicely on someone's shelf next to the remake of Willy Wonka and be soon forgotten.",1311465600,2,2210,4.443890274314215

4356381,3,B004EPYZU8,"What a strange movie.  I freely admit it, I got it, but I also didn't get it at the same time.  There were a lot of flashy action scenes and something I think was supposed to be substance, but overall I merely found it average.

After the death of her mother, accidental murder of her sister (she was trying to save her from her father), Baby Doll finds herself in the mental institution.  Scheduled for lobotomy, she retreats and imagines herself in a brothel where dances are the key entertainment.  Every time she dances she retreats to a fantasy world where she (and later the other girls) have to fight different beings in order to achieve their objectives.  These visions help her to understand that if she obtains some key items, she'll be able to escape.  The other girls help  her along in her plan as they struggle against their oppressors.

Characters:
Emily Browning: Baby Doll
Abbie Cornish: Sweet Pea
Jena Malone: Rocket
Vanessa Hudgens: Blondie
Jamie Chung: Amber
Carla Gugino: Vera Gorski
Oscar Isaac: Blue Jones
Jon Hamm: Doctor/High Roller
Scott Glen: Wise Man
Gerard Plunkett: Stepfather

Let's face it, none of these characters were probably hired for their acting, but rather for their looks.  They did do a good job at what they did have to act at though.  In particular, Carla Gugino was very great as Vera Gorski.  At least, I liked her character the best as she was interesting.  Baby Doll I wasn't as fond of, while being slightly crazy, she seemed a little too wise for her character at times and it just wasn't realistic (yes I know, its a mental institution with delusions, but still).  The other girls probably would have been great, but it almost seemed like their roles were stifled in favor of Baby Doll's.

The plot was a bit convoluted.  There was delusions within delusions and it could get somewhat confusing at times.  Honestly, I don't think this movie was aimed at me as a viewer base but rather teenage boys.  There was a lot of pretty girly type scenes and actions scenes with swords, guns, and monsters.  Despite this though, there was nothing really graphic or strong language used much so I would say that it definitely is ok for younger viewers.  I do have to comment that the special effects were done very well.  All of the scenes were great but I especially liked the scene where the monsters spewed steam instead of blood.  It was just a great effect and not gory as most are.  The music was pretty good too, all of it was haunting but it fit in with the movie very well.

It was ok, but as said before, I don't think that it was aimed at me as a viewer group.  I'm sure other people would love it a lot more than I did.

4356383,3,B004EPYZU8,"I think this movie may not have been possible to make without 'Inception' being released first. A number of story elements have been taken from that film. One thing that is interesting and I don't know whether it has come out of the interest in trying to explain 'Inception', is that people are now trying to explain this film.

This could be a deliberate ploy of writing a story like that - hoping it will be interpreted as having different levels and that moviegoers are both ready for and want that.

A few other things can be true:
One - the film isn't that interesting and doesn't work at all, apart from the action scenes.
Two - the film is very simple to understand and people are trying to make it seem like there was more going on by being intellectual about it.
Three - it's just entertainment and none of the above matters anyway.

The film was made for Blu-Ray, there is no doubt of that. The visuals and production design are something else entirely.
However, I will agree that it is depressing and disturbing once you begin to put together what may not have been happening on screen to the main character, who is apparently a dancer (though we do not see this on screen). I did notice that Doctor Gorski (the mental health professional) looks very sad after the main character's 'dance' performances - this is not out of admiration for what we do not see, but rather seems to be because she knows what the dance REALLY represents. This may be because she is powerless to stop what is going on.

The film could be about empowerment or loss/lack of power.

I think for many the film was either a downer, was seen as sexist , had a confused plot and/or thought it was smarter than it was. Regardless, a lot of people didn't connect with it. It may have another life on home video. I will be interested to see how it is regarded in ten years. I would recommend renting it at least.",1311206400,2,1891,4.406876790830945
4356384,4,B004EPYZU8,"Finally some babes with balls. My biggest complaint on most chick-driven action flicks is how unconvincing the gun-shooting and fighting sequences are. But not the case in ""Sucker Punch"" These women are as proficient in their use of weapons and tactics as Navy ""S.e.a.l.s"" Totally convincing! You will never look at your girlfriend or wife the same way again. And if one word sums up Zack's movies, it's COOL. What makes Zack's films so much better than the average action flick is his use of a virtual 3-D camera environment which totally immerses you in the experience, unlike most film-makers who are linear in their action. Just as in ""Alien"" you are never not quite sure of what you're looking at until the camera completes it's roll, pitch and yaw. The results are a movie audience that is totally glued to their seats and to the screen. I am totally surprized that other directors haven't copied his style already. Just as in the fighting sequences of 300, Zack smacks you in the face (SuckerPunches"" you with the action and gritty realism. Visual imagery is astounding, music and sound effects plus the sighs and grunts of the female warriors composed into the score's background are dead on. Cast and costumes are sexy but totally functional. A well cast movie. Only wish there would have been an extended version of the 300 fight scenes. That movie always left me wanting more. Unfortunately he boxed himself in and never produced an extended version of the movie and left it no where to go. The only complaint on this movie is the ending. Didn't like it. And that the stepfather gets away with murder. Not a cool thing in my review of the movie. But other than that...WELL DONE ZACK. But again Zack why box yourself in. There is no where to go with a sequel in this universe. What if the audience wants to see more of ""Babydoll"" and her cool worlds and cool friends. Maybe Zack does not like sequels.

4356531,4,B004EPYZU8,"I can tell you this: it is my personal belief that whether you hate or love this movie is determined entirely by whether you have done the same thing as the main characters. So to speak. Otherwise the action sequences are out of place. I'll explain my point.

What we see in the opening sequence is Baby Doll, a person who even this early in life has gone through some kind of traumatic experience with her step-father. What we see, in hurried sequence, is how a person remembers how they got to where they are now. We see the implications of a sexually abusive relationship and we see the terrible death of Baby Doll's sister. She is eventually shunted into an awful asylum which is implied to be a place where they sent ""uncooperative"" women. In five days, our main character will be lobotomized. Based on what she sees, she concocts an escape plan. But what happens in those five days is horrific---too traumatic for Baby Doll to take. She therefore constructs several layers of fantasy. The second, the ""bordello"" layer, is a metaphor for Baby Doll's perception of the asylum. Note her PERCEPTION: we see later that things aren't always as they appear. It should also be noted that the character performances are simplified in the same way that you cannot know the inner lives of your closest friends. You are you, and they are in your head as you see them: mere grasps of the complex entity that is themselves.

If you don't know what the second layer's supposed to be and how it connects, well....how many fantasies have you HAD in your life? o. O;; The second layer is Baby Doll's fantasy reflection on what occurred: a protection that many people create to escape the stress of their lives. Baby Doll's life is simply more stressful than we can imagine. In a woman's fantasies, she often sexualizes herself out of a desire to be ""better"" as it were. I know this from experience; I did it even as a thirteen year old girl. XD We are also however impossibly powerful, gloriously badass, fighting nameless enemies as a representation of our very real fears and resentments. It's true that this is an odd thing to watch, deeply private for most of us, but if you know what it is it becomes rather more dramatic. ;3 She's actually astonishingly unselfish: how many of your friends take central roles in your private world?

In short it was a blast: the true villains were painful to see (There ARE real people like Blue in the world, and I was proud of the movie for being honest about the dark subject matter in its own bizarre way) and the victory was of a different kind. But in a world where you have so little power, a happy ending would have been deeply unrealistic. The movie shows you a very real hell some people live in and it shows the kind of victory you may be lucky enough to find there. A victory in which you win by being stronger psychologically than those who crush you underneath them. Save another's life, perhaps.

So in short...I doubt it's for everyone. The themes are deeply disturbing to most people, when they're thought about. It creates a sickening feeling in the chest, the proverbial sucker punch. Intolerable to some. The dialogue is a little crazy at points and sometimes the story wandered more than it should, focused on the wrong elements. But I saw no misogynistic tendencies in it: merely the revealing of what real misogyny is like to the powerless. So...make of it what you will.

1.  Girl gets framed by evil stepfather, who commits her to a mental institution

2. He makes arrangements to make sure she never tells her side of the unhappy story

3. She creates a fantasy where she can escape

4. Assisted by a group of girls far too hot to be incarcerated, the fantasy takes flight, video-game style.

5. Those not enthused by violent fantasy worlds will not be amused.

While I understand the concept behind the movie, enjoyed the action sequences and costumes, and loved the general campiness of it all, the movie as a whole was a bit choppy and didn't flow smoothly from one sequence to another.

In some early parts it was hard to figure out what was going on, and people who like a straightforward story will not appreciate what the filmmaker was trying to achieve. I'd watch the action sequences again, but probably not the whole movie.

This is the movie... Orphan sent to mental institution for accidentally killing her sister while attempting to protect her from their bad daddy.

When she finally defeats the forces of evil she gets lobotomized with a metal rod through her eye socket and the force of evil (the rapist) can no longer manipulate her... the end.

Well, my used copy of this movie arrived. Now I have clear picture and clear sound, I find it near-impossible to dislike it. Sure, in some ways it's absurd and I'm guessing some male critics were afraid to admit they liked it because of all the skimpy clothing, but I have to admire Zack Snyder's boldness. (It's interesting that two of the three most favorable reviews were written by women. Maybe they enjoyed seeing women kill the villains without a lot of help from men and without having to be ornaments for heroes???)

""SP"" is demented, delirious, and sometimes delightful.

When she tries to prevent her stepfather from raping her sister, a young woman accidentally kills that sister. The loathsome stepfather eventually has her committed to a mental institution where she's about to receive a lobotomy when.... she enters a dream world wherein she works in a brothel. What happens there is near-indescribable. But it gets a bit loud at times.

I can understand all the objections to this movie. I just can't hate it. Much of it I'm really enjoying. (I'm half through it.)

I'm not much of a fan of action movies and some of the battle scenes in this seem too long but they're so over-the-top I almost have to admire them.

I'm curious to see if this sells a lot of DVDs and/or becomes a cult favorite.

Here's a little oddity: I removed the paper sleeve so I could scan it for a review and I discovered there's artwork on the (usually white) INSIDE of the sleeve. Plus the art features the person who is the film's true protagonist. Snyder gives a hint or two very early about whom the story really centers, then he spends the rest of the movie throwing you curves. I wonder if that major mystery is solved more clearly in the extended version??? Did Warner Brothers insist on cuts that muddied the story and helped sink the movie at the box office? Blast! Now I want to buy the extended version!

************************************* UPDATE: 16 Dec 2011 ***********************

2. Blu-Ray extended.

4356743,4,B004EPYZU8,"I'll break down my review into the following sections:
1. Initial thoughts on movie
2. Video, Audio Quality
3. Special Features

1. I initially heard a ton of bad reviews about this movie; most people were disappointed with the execution considering all the hype. I never saw the movie in a  theater, but rather rented it on blu-ray and then decided to buy it, especially when I found out that the Two-Disc Extended Edition had an R-rated version of the film that had an additional ~20 minutes. I also wanted to see the extra features. As far as the film goes, it's a got a pretty simple story that is easy to follow, a linear plot (for the most part), and plenty of visually impressive effects, typical of Zack Snyder. The few complaints that I have about the film itself is that the characters are not very well developed (which is improved slightly in the extended version), and some of the more visually impressive scenes are not well integrated into the story and seem more like they were incorporated as a means of showing off the capabilities of CG. 7/10 in this aspect.

2. In regards to the actual video and audio quality, the blu-ray transfer was excellent and the video quality, even for blu-ray is pretty incredible. I cannot imagine watching this film is anything less than full 1080p high-resolution. The audio is synced well and complements the stunning visual effects well throughout the film. Multiple coding options are available on the disc, so it can be optimized for any home theater setup. 9/10 here.

3. The special features, while not incredibly extensive, make a huge difference when choosing to rent or buy this film. The extended version does not dramatically change the quality of the film, but does provide a little more time for character development without interrupting the flow of the narrative. A relatively unique feature is ""Maximum Movie Mode"" which is also found on Watchmen and is basically a visual commentary by Director Zack Snyder. If you are into the film-making process, this alone makes this product worth buying. There are a lot of photo galleries and stills that I don't find very interesting, but overall the special features are top notch. 7/10 for these.",1310688000,4,2205,4.810026385224274
4356744,2,B004EPYZU8,"The previews made this look pretty cool.  There are so few action heroes that are women, that that alone made me want to see this.  But the movie itself was a horrible disappointment.

A common problem with some movies is that they start at 1000 miles per hour, leaving them no where to go, nothing to increase the tension.  So, the plot & the intensity just flatlines through the whole movie.

The stylized fight sequences which looked incredible on the previews, went on WAY too long.  The sequences / settings, seemed to have no connection to the movie or to the fight scenes.  They were just random scenes that I assume, someone just thought they looked cool

4356877,5,B004EPYZU8,"Zack Snyder's ""Sucker Punch"" was released into theaters in March of 2011, to a resounding *THUD* from movie critics and movie-going audiences. The majority of mainstream reviews claimed that it objectified women and made a mockery of feminism, while audiences went into the theaters expecting a hollow piece of action-movie titillation, only to get... something else.

Well, now that ""Sucker Punch"" has been released on Blu-ray and DVD, and I've actually seen it with an open mind and no preconceived notions, I can safely say that both camps missed the point entirely.

This is not a mindless piece of T&A-filled escapism. This is also not the abomination that so many seemed dedicated to making it out to be... To put it simply: there is no way to put this movie simply.

Without spoiling too much of the plot, this movie centers around a young girl (introduced to the audience as ""Babydoll"") who escapes from the grim reality of being unjustly imprisoned in an insane asylum by slipping into a dissociative fantasy where she and several of her fellow inmates are ""working girls"" held captive in a brothel. The details of this fantasy realm suggest that there is sexual abuse going on within the walls of the real-world asylum, which (coupled with the implied abuse that Babydoll suffered at the hands of her step-father) is a corner-stone of who this young woman is and what she is imagining.

Within the brothel fantasy, Baby hatches a plan to escape from the brothel/asylum with four of her fellow captives. (All four of these additional characters are female, and it can be assumed that all have had to endure abuse of some sort throughout their time in captivity.)

While the four young women enact their escape plan, the audience is taken into a *second* layer of fantasy, one in which the girls are powerful, fearless warriors who fight as an impenetrable unit. (It is within this fantasy realm that the movie's aggressive soundtrack and mouth-dropping CG visuals really come into play for the viewer.)

I won't go into further plot detail for fear of spoilers, but this movie is one of the most original and engaging stories I've seen all year. The villain (Oscar Isaac) is amazingly diabolical in his role, and the five leads all do their jobs admirably.

Whether you love or hate it will be as difficult to predict as this movie is to describe, but it has already developed a cult following and one thing is certain: it is unlike any other film you'll see this year.

It may seem hyperbolic, but it's in my top ten... ""Sucker Punch"" got me.",1310515200,6,2552,4.770975056689342

4356880,4,B004EPYZU8,"First, let me qualify my 4-star rating by breaking the movie into more quantifiable pieces:

Visual Effects:  5 stars
Soundtrack & FX: 5 stars
Choreography:  5 stars
Cinematography:  5 stars
Editing:  4 stars
Acting:  2 stars (generous)
Story / Plot:  .5 stars (that's right, HALF a star at best)

Overall, the film delivered what I wanted from it: stuff blowing up in beautifully choreographed and stylized ways. If, like me, you've ever asked the question, ""in a fight between..."" this film is worth watching just to see one man's vision of what might happen. A pretty girl in a school-girl costume tackles giant [robotic demon?] samurai equipped with howitzer-scaled Gatling guns, a squad of scantily-clad babes mow down trenches of WWII [zombie] Nazis with automatic weaponry and even an anime-styled mech. It's over the top, it's nonsensical and just plan fun if viewed purely for the ""action/effects porn"" that it is.

The film's problems begin to manifest rapidly if you make the mistake of looking for any kind of meaningful reason behind the glorious fight sequences. Tying all of this carnage together is a thinly veiled excuse for shooting scantily-clad babes in explosive action set pieces. Unfortunately, for me anyway, these story bits tend to weigh the movie down into territory it never needed to explore--the psychological ramifications of mental, physical and sexual abuse.

Somehow, what might have been an opus to female empowerment has become the anthem for battered women resigned to their fate--the only way to cope is to escape into a fantasy. Too powerless to face and change her reality, our protagonist simply invents a new one to exist in.

Honestly, though, I wouldn't even have a problem with this set up if it wasn't so blatant and sophomoric. I came away from the film feeling that some lucky teenage boy got a chance to have his fantasies put on film. That horrid dragon book/movie written by a pre-schooler or the vampire travesty which has recently swept our teenage nation is why the producers of this film thought they could get away with slapping a melodramatic piece of drivel as filler between truly inspired action sequences. And, unfortunately, they were half right.

The reason there is a ""love it or hate it"" polarization to this movie is because it LOOKS and SOUNDS like a movie you want to enjoy and then tries to tie it all together with a ""story"" so weak and unappealing that you feel dirty for liking any aspect of the movie at all.

It has the drama... the crazy people, the sci-fi, the robots, the dragons, the technology, the war, the emotional tug, the love, the sacrifice, and then... finally... it has the real purpose of the story revealed, at the end... but you have to listen to the opening narrative to really appreciate the closing narrative.

I expected nothing from this little movie except some eye candy and maybe some silly video game scenes- but it actually has a story which draws you in and makes you feel for the characters- if you let it.

As far as story telling goes this movie is great. It's paced well, has excellent music, and lots of good trippy visuals. It was a suprise to me. Instead of laughing at it I really enjoyed it. For its entertainment value alone I think Sucker Punch will likely end up a cult classic.

4.)  Action.
5.)  Guns.
6.)  Hot chicks.
7.)  Tripped out plot, but if you follow it, it is worth while.

I won't put this film on a pedestal claiming it's the best film to come out the same year but it's hardly the trash some reviews have chalked it up as. Amazon compared it to Moulin Rouge, WTF!? Underneath this visually stunning film is a great story that comes off as intelligent, emotional and chock full of dark gritty drama. Some just couldn't see past the visuals or the girls and the outfits they wear or were probably disappointed because they expected more skin. Snyder's work is somewhat underrated in that he doesn't get enough credit for placing a fantastically laid-out film in the middle of his visual wizardry; the death scene of Leonidas in 300 is a perfect example of this. In Sucker Punch, the scene where the girls are confronted by Blue Jones because he's figured out their plan is utter brilliance in the structure of the movie, the performances and how it was placed on screen. This movie isn't for anyone and in an sense making a film like this is a new direction for the industry, visual effects that aren't sterile, included for vanity or overshadow the actual movie. Sucker Punch is the kind of film that brings a smile to my face in view of all the other pointless garbage Hollywood drones out. One of my friends was proud to take her daughters to see this and they all loved it claiming it to be the ultimate ""girl power"" movie showing girls they can rise up from anything. If you could see the intelligence and artistry laid out in 300 or The Watchmen then absolutely watch this movie. If you don't like it, Hollywood made three Transformers films instead.",1309996800,7,1689,4.614617940199335

I did read that the director had done 300 and watchmen so this was his artistry movie but to spend so much on over the top special effects dream sequences just didn't seem to stick enough substance in to the film to justify all taking place in her head. I have to admit as a guy in his twenty yes the women where attractive but was that a enough to drive the movie i don't think.

Mixing babes, WWI, Demon Samurai, Dragons, and Robota just makes a recipe for an epically awesome movie. The film takes young Babydoll who after accidentally murdering her sister is sent to a mental institution where she meets four other inmates, and soon realizes they're immersed into a world of dance and band together to escape. Using their dreams and the imagination, they must search for a map, fire, a knife and a key in order to escape from their ill reality. Soon, Babydoll bands together with Sweet Pea, Rocket, Blondie, and Amber to take an epic journey by using their dance routines to take a journey through the mind through four distinct worlds which include battling demon samurai, WWI demons, dragons and knights, and futuristic robots, all while coming up with a plan to escape from the clutches of Blue Jones....

It could fly over the heads of some people who don't understand the artistry and intelligence film because of the very intentional and self aware flash and spectacle that is in the film. Anyone who dismisses this film as a mindless action movie is an idiot. This is a well written, well directed work of cinema that posesses a level of artistic quality that is rare and usually completely absent in hollywood films. This film is a result of an individual's creative vision and not another banal product for the masses.
Sucker Punch catches you with a jarring twist at the end that turns out to be a feint and that is part of the genius of the script writing. The film then flows into an ending tone which is great.
A very entertaining, as well as a very satisfying movie.
Highly recommended. Ignore the low reviews. This is a Solid 4 star movie.",1309824000,7,910,4.4879518072289155

The suggestion that it lacks substance is also false. It is merely the latest version of ""A Hanging At Owl Creek Bridge"" but with mind blowing and original special effects. In essence, the entire movie is about the lobotomy of young girl.

The criticism that the subject and the world depicted are depressing and bleak is dishearteningly shallow. Perhaps these people should only go see mainstream Hollywood schlock like ""Twilight"".

Making disparaging comparisons with video games also is baseless. So what if it reminded some people of a video game. I do not see that as a valid criticism. Video games can be quite moving and meaningful.

After watching the extended (and originally intended) cut on this combo, it's plain to see why.  Many reviews I read complained of slow-motion and montages, which are actually just the result of trying to shorten this movie! It makes a lot more sense when you see the extended version.
By the way, haters, the ""Sucker Punch"" the title refers to is that the girls are dressed skimpy but this movie wasn't made for the boys! Nor was it made for women who think owning one's sexuality is disempowering. You can wear ankle-length skirts all you want, but I have to commend Snyder for accurately portraying a fangirl's daydream.  In my mind, I'd be kicking butt in an impossibly sexy outfit while still being formidable. These girls are tough but some reviewers say they are acting ""butchy"" i.e. they expect girls dressed this way to act like strippers, but these girls all carry themselves in a classy way.  This movie is NOT misogynist.  I think the real misogynists are the ones who can't take a girl seriously because her clothes are skimpy.  This movie is supposed to be divisive.

I would have felt ripped off if I paid full price for it. It seems to have been designed with the notion of turning it into a video game. You get the gist of the plot at the start of the movie, but no real detail. You never find out why the other girls are there except in the fantasy land dance hall or what happens in the real world of the mental institution while all the fantasy is going on. All in all, it has the feel of a comic book that was turned into a movie, but had to be cut and edited like Lord of the Rings to be able to adapt it to a movie.",1309824000,3,677,3.6758620689655173

The amazon set of blu ray, dvd and digital copy was a great deal and as always getting the ""lowest price"" is a nice surprise.

The soundtrack ALSO is perfect!",1309824000,7,353,4.101449275362318
4357241,4,B004EPYZU8,"I was pretty excited about the movie from the trailers and interviews, but when I started seeing all the negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, I decided to stay away.  Now that I've finally seen the movie on Blu-ray, I have to admit that it really is not nearly as bad as all the critics are saying.  (Also, I really would have given it a 3.5 instead of 4, but since there are no half stars in the rating, I will round up.)

I'll start with the things that did not work: the music was much too central in several parts of the movie.  It really did feel like a music video as some have commented.  The choice of songs are fine, but it really should have been more subtle and used more in the background, rather than dominating the movie.  The dialogue is definitely not the strongest element; it may not be unbelievably cheesy (ala Batman and Robin) but there are some lines (especially from the Wiseman character) that are cringeworthy.  The use of slow motion does get excessive in some scenes, most notably the scene on the train with the robots.  The action is also very CGI heavy and thus does suffer from the heft and weight that more grounded, live action shooting could have brought.

I think that sense of unreality was what many people took offense to; but in the end, it is perfectly suited for the story being told in Sucker Punch.  This is the story of how women who had no power in their society, imagined themselves to be powerful in their minds.  If you are willing to accept this lack of reality in their imaginary world, you will likely enjoy the wildly exotic imagery Snyder orchestrated.  The story is actually engaging in several moments as you come to care for Babydoll. I disagree with the criticism that the story is completely shallow and devoid of meaning; the theme of claiming the power to choose your destiny came through clearly by the end.  Don't let the critics scare you off, there is a lot that can be enjoyed in this movie; Sucker Punch is worth experiencing.",1309824000,4,1992,4.484764542936288

Popped the Blu Ray in last night. The movie got off to an interesting start, but once it went into the fantasy world, I lost interest. By about half way through (1 hour in), I stopped watching. Not sure if I will ever finish it.

I couldn't buy into the premise, and especially in the fantasy world, I couldn't care less about the heroine. Some of the action scenes were very nice (some were lame too, especially when Baby Doll first goes into the fantasy world and meets Scott Glenn's character).

Now the rest of the movie could be great. I just couldn't make it that far. In hindsight, I should have rented this movie instead of buying it. Wanted to like it.

I was hoping the critics were wrong on this one (pretty bad reviews on Rotten Tomatoes). In my opinion, they weren't too unfair.",1309824000,2,899,4.565217391304348

The girls have four tasks to complete and by the 2nd I just couldn't believe there were two more to suffer through. Even if you're just looking for eye candy, there is just not enough of that to entertain for an hour and a half. Boring, boring, pointless.",1309824000,11,613,4.482142857142857

This to me was a very immersing movie.  It starts out at ground zero with the character Baby Doll and just takes off from there.  Also, if you're into computer gaming you will find this movie quite interesting as well.  The movie has a very novel twist in that all the fantasy, action, and sci-fi take place only when Baby Doll is dancing and she transports herself in her mind to these places and events and thereby taking the other four female characters with her.

Fake fighting parts was terrible and the girls dancing that they never showed was mindless. What kind of writor would put dancing all the way through a movie but you never see the person dance.

4357328,2,B004EPYZU8,"Okay, let me explain myself just a tad.  I really enjoyed this film, but I'm totally aware that it's not really a good movie.  I am of the opinion that a film can be good or bad as a FACT, but it's only YOUR opinion if YOU don't like it.  Get it?  Citizen Kane is a masterpiece, perfectly made film, but you may hate it.  That doesn't change the fact that it's a great film.  YOu just didn't get it or it just wasn't your cup of tea.  There is a criteria from which to judge films, varying for each genre and the specific film's intentions.  I would go into more details but it would take up the majority of this review. Some films are great or good whether you like them or not.  Battlefield: Los Angeles is not an inspired or even good movie, it's a fact, but for whatever reason you may like it or think it's one of your favorites.  Making any sense?  There's a reason why professional film critics are film critics.  They have standards, they have experience and a vast knowledge of almost every type of film to use as templates for anything they're hating or loving on.  Anyway.....

I've only watched the unrated director's cut on blu ray all the way through.  I only skimmed the theatrical version

Okay, now on to Sucker Punch Zack Snyder's(Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead 04, 300) new epic fantasy film released last year to horrible reviews and even worse box office.  This film is the most upsetting of movies that don't work.  It actually has ideas and themes.  It just doesn't really get them through in a great way.  I've always said I'd rather see an epic failure by someone who is trying to say something or who is a REAL artist over some hackeneyed piece of corporate drivel(**cough, cough***Transformers III**cough, cough) without a soul or goal beyond the weekend's opening box office.  Sukcer Punch is a lot of things but it is definitely not a film made by committe with great corporate interests at hand.  It's way too much of a downer, loaded with as much physical violence as it is with mental violence.  And YES, I 'got' it.  It's not very oscure to get as some of the film's overzealous, and possibly in denial, champions would accuse this film's detractors of being.  There's no real twist to the story.  Right from the first five or ten minutes you know where you stand as a doctor hovers over our main character, Babydoll, with a needle ready to lobotomize her.  The movie never hides what's not real and what is.  There's no twist.  It states its case right off the bat.  That's also a problem of sorts.  The film goes into Babydoll's mind right before the puncture and it takes us to a brothel set in some fantasy world.  She is a new dancer set to be de-virginized by a 'high roller' in five days.  Of course she wants to escape before this but needs some help by some of the other likeminded girls around her.  Alas, her great gift is a magical burlesque dance, that we never see or experince, that distracts her captor long enough for her cohorts to get items they will need to make their escape.  Every time she goes to dance we go into a fantasy world within the fantasy world we're already in.  Get it?

Here's the thing: every fantasy world within the fantasy are made up of pop culture scenarios influenced by everything from steampunk, war epics, Lord of the Rings, and anime.  We never see what her cohorts are doing to get the escape items in fantasy world number one, we just see action scenarios in fantasty world number two that sort of emulates the emotions and actions going on in fantasy world number one.  Yeah, I'm getting a headache, and no, this is not Naked Lunch or Inception, not even The Matrix.  While the action scenes are beautifully rendered and fairly exciting, at first, they all seem tedious and moot compared to what the ACTUAL plot is.  It's real visceral entertainment, and while I applaud it for that, I can't get over the fact that so much time is spent on action scenarios that have no narrative thrust, purpose or even flow when we are told they are all just fantasies to begin with.  And that's not counting the fact that the dramatic situation pre-labotomy fantasy is also TOTALLY made up and pointless at the end of the day.  I get what Snyder is going for and I appreciate his risk but he fails more than he succeeds.  To make matters worse by the third fantasy scenario you are bored and start to have the tedium of the whole thing sink in.  You don't care about the girls slaying a dragon or slo-mo fighting cyborgs delivering a bomb on a train.  You just don't because you've already been told that they don't really mean anything, and the whole time you're just wondering why so much time is spent in this fantasty number two relm.  This is the film's biggest problem.  While you may want to try and turn off your brain to this, you simply can't.  Sure, some audience memebers are simple and just like the explosions and effects, so they don't care, but these types of people aren't real movie lovers or fans.  They're just veg-heads who dig anything that's in the moment qualifying as 'KEWL' to them.  So, as a real movie buff and lover, who cares what they think anyway?  Just skim through all the over-praising reviews and you'll see what I mean.  They all talk about action, half naked chicks and special effects.  Not really something a real movie geek spends too much time talking about unless it's truly amazing and integral to the story, ala Jurassic Park, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Matrix, Inception, and many others.

I say all this because I want to let you know that I may be over rating this film by a star and half due to my love of it's concept, tone and over the top visuals.  I love looking at this film.  I liked the whole concept while not really digging the execution.  This is NOT  a good film, but it's one I enjoyed and will watch over again for sure.  Zach Snyder is a Ridley Scott level visualist of the highest order.  His frames would make great stills.  He does things with visuals that hacks like Paul WS Anderson and Michael Bay wish they could do in their dreams.  Also, while his action set pieces are just as silly and over the top as a Bay or Anderson film, he knows how to compose interlocking shots and edits his films very well.  The action flows naturally and works for the most part.  ALthough, he should NEVER do slo-motion EVER AGAIN.  Actually, all directors should drop this as a tool of theirs when doing action with big effects.  Its become a parody of itself, and unless the director is trying to illicit laughter or groans through slo mo, I think it's beyond time to put it to bed for a while.  I was sick of it by the third Matrix sequel honestly.  Snyder has been quoted as saying that his upcoming Superman reboot(or whatever Hollywood calls movies that retread old ideas these days) will be lite to totally void of slo mo shots.  Thank god.  I admire and like this film to a degree.  I like what it was going for and the visuals are striking.  The first few action beats are truly fun but lose steam toward the third act.  You'll either love it or hate it, but it will never be a truly great or good film.

I can't really talk much about the acting or the characters due to most of them not even being real people, but rather figments and pesonality traits of one girl wrapped up in a fantasy.  All the female actress look good and perform well enough, but there's not much to play outside of action posing.  Emily Browning, who plays the lead in all three realities, is very striking and has much charisma on screen.  She has got an exotic beauty that doesn't resemble any young actors of this era or the past.  I would like to see if she has the chops with a meatier role.  I will say that the soundtrack is awesome and integral to how the film works.  The score is interwoven with songs by Bjork and Brian Ferry among others to create a vibe that is totally unique.  I have the soundtrack and I'm a huge fan of the cabaret-esque version of Love is the Drug co-performed by the always stunning Carla Gugino.  It's a real show stopper, more so than some of the later action scenes.

The blu ray looks and sounds great of course.  The special features are limited but they do include two features that make it worth it, the director's R rated cut and the Maximum Movie Mode that goes along with it on disc two.  The disc says that the R rated version is 17 minutes longer than the theatrical version, but I only skimmed the theatrical and only noticed two differences.  Firstly, the violence, while not more gratuitous, is more graphic(especially when some hero characters bite it towards the end), and some of the CGI laden action sequences have been added to in minute areas.  The biggest addition is at the ending with actor John Hamm(Tv's Mad Men) which was surprising to me, because in the theatrical version he seems to only show up for face time.  In the director's cut he plays a sort of salvation embodiment that lets the Babydoll character know that she can be free in an extended bedroom sequence in fantasy world number two.  It's a sweet and poignent scene but it's totally weird at the same time.  Why this was cut out of the theatrical version, especially with a name actor like John Hamm in the role, is beyond me.  Next up is the usually enteraining Maximum Movie Mode which Warner Home Video usually includes for its bigger blu ray titles.  It's basically the a behind the scenes doc that you watch simultaneously with the film.  Zach Snyder hosts, as he did for his director's cut of his much better movie Watchmen.  It covers everything from special effects, costumes, casting and set design.  Snyder also gives details regarding where the idea and the process of the scriptwriting came from, which may be interesting to fans and detractors alike.  Sometimes the info is played during the movie and sometimes the movie is stopped for docs and commentary.  I love this feature and I enjoyed watching this one for Sucker Punch.  The first disc of the blu ray has the theatrical version on it along with two other special features, both fairly useless.  First we get animated shorts that play as prequels or rather backstories for the fantasy heavy second realities.  They're not really animated but more on par with South Park style animation done by computers and very cut and paste.  They're pretty lame, and really only give vague backstories to what is behind some of the villains in the big action fantasy sequences.  Not really worth watching.  The most lame feature is the second one on this disc regarding the film's soundtrack and it's creation.  It's barely five minutes long and adds up to little more than a commercial for the soundtrack album. This a bummer considering how much work and thought went into the soundtrack from the composers to the pop songs chosen, most of which were sung by actress Emily Browning.  It's short and pointless.  For more in depth info regarding the soundtrack you're better off going to the Maximum Movie Mode feature on disc two.

So, there you have it.  I'm totally over rating this film, but also under rating it considering that I did kind of like what it was and what it wasn't.  It's worth a peek as a rental.  Like I said you will either hate or love it.

PS: Oh, yeah, Scott Glenn is in this movie too!  He's a really good actor that is totally WASTED in this film.  He shows up in each fantasy vignette as a Yoda-like character who guides our heroines and gives cliche'd lines(I think they're cliche'd on purpose though).  Nice to see him work, but I would have liked to see him more in this film....or any film.",1309737600,5,11611,4.4721561161351735

None of the absolutely disgusting villains get whats coming to them, there is no closure or justice whatsoever. Watching this movie is like molesting a mentally challenged person, then giving them a lollypop to suck on and telling them to 'pretend it never happened' that is the same sleazy, shameful feeling you get watching this horrible movie.

people keep saying how bad the plot was, that there was no story ? what ??!!
i really can't see what is the problem with it ?
"" An Abusive step father sends his step daughter into an asylum claiming she is crazy, more abuse at the asylum is inflicted on her, she escapes by dissociating from reality into a fantasy world "", that is an interesting story as any !! what exactly do people want for a plot ?

Sure the plot does lack in certain areas, and might have left things unexplained, but it does not harm the movie or make it the worst thing ever made.
I also like the fact that they never tried to add silly or funny scenes to make it more light or soft and kept it being a dark movie, unlike the silly Transformers movies, that have stunning visuals but very forced and silly humor.

Characters are interesting, and the girls were introduced gradually into the plot with good character development.

People complaining that they could not see the Girl dancing during the transition, well, BOHOO !! go cry to your mommy !! do we really have to see what happens and how she dance, what are you expecting ? live with it.

the action scenes and the sound effect editing are superb. special effects were amazing and visually stunning !! I can't believe people say that this is the worst movie ever made with this kind of unique effects that are not commonly seen in movies.

I do believe that people have different opinions, and some poeple could have not liked Sucker Punch, but the huge attack it is getting is unfair and unjust. this can't be the wrost movie ever made !! even if the producers wanted it to be, it can't be !

Unlike most negative reviewers here, i will admit that Sucker Punch is not the perfect movie, it is not the best out there, but it is very enjoyable and entertaining. it is worth 4 stars, but i will give 5 just to make things fair a little in here !!

It totally enthralled me but it's box office was lukewarm at best as was the critical reaction.  The operative tag was style over substance.  It wasn't until it was released in the then burgeoning home video market that word of mouth made the film the classic that it's considered today.  This is not to suggest that ""Sucker Punch"" is in that same lofty category but to draw an analogy.  As memory serves ""Sucker Punch"" on it's release last Spring was met with hostile reviews and plummeting box office as word of mouth got out.  I think it's more of a case of dashed expectations.  The ad campaign led you to believe that the film was straightforward comic book fantasy, or, the filmization of ""Fox Force Five"", the fictional TV show from ""Pulp Fiction"".  Director Zack Snyder has attempted something ambitious here.  He melds psychological thriller, hyper-realism, and uber-fantasy seamlessly into a work that kept me rapt.  Snyder proved he was a master visualist with ""300"" but here he's attempting something different.  Most of the criticism I've seen says there's no narrative but nothing could be further from the truth.  It's a richly detailed stream of conscience narrative that requires close attention otherwise you miss the rewards it reaps.  I don't know if I really loved this movie or I'm just playing devil's advocate.

The dialogue is bad, even the great Scott Glen can't save his sparse lines from sounding hokey. The girls are pretty. Color and scene composition is very good. And the effect of surrealistic blending of reality and lucid dream is nicely done. BUT - ( semi spoiler alert ) the ending and the pseudo-hip ""Like, wow, this is all, like,  a great Deep Profound Metaphor for ME and MY life and like, you know, I can BE and I can be FREE and like, you know, stuff..."" philosophy would only be impressive to someone who finds Secret Wisdom in the Cheech and Chong movies.

4357434,1,B004EPYZU8,"I did not catch Sucker Punch when it was in the theater being shown in IMAX.  I had seen the lackluster reviews on Rotten Tomatoes but since I have enjoyed Zack Snyder's other efforts (300, Watchmen) I thought critics were just being particularly hard on him with this newest effort.

I was wrong.

From the very opening scenes this entire turkey of a movie simply stinks from beginning to end.  No amount of gorgeous women running around in skimpy outfits with huge guns and swords can change the fact that this movie has a terrible plot that barely makes sense, action sequences that look like they were pulled from some of the worst ""B"" comic books of the past decade, and acting that is just simply completely atrocious.

Don't get me wrong, I like big spectacle movies that try to wow the audience with gorgeous visuals.  I LOVED Kick Ass!  I even thought Tron was decent because the visual styling was a masterpiece of light and color and the plot and acting, while sub-par were at least watchable.  Sucker Punch though is in a whole other category of film.  It goes beyond the bubble gum styled visual spectacle that has a weak plot and mediocre acting.  Sucker Punch is basically an ego trip for a writer who thought it would be great fun to shoot scenes of giant robots fighting Germans in WWI trenches.... or maybe it is mental masturbation when you scribble together a few weak sauce lines and try to call it a story.  I did not even think the visuals were that good and I have a top of the line 65"" Plasma TV to watch on, so I should know what looks good.

All in all this is a terrible movie.  I literally watched this disc (which I purchased here), struggled through to the end (by 20 minutes into the movie I was already debating turning it off) and promptly put it up for auction on eBay because I have absolutely zero desire to see this cornball piece of crap ever ever again.

Do movie viewers just have no standards at all? I always watch movies and accept them for what they are, but this... This was epic trash from the depths of pure waste. Even for what it is (and it will never be what it set out to be), it's a worst case scenario train wreck disaster.

Visually, some of if it was pretty eye candy, but THAT doesn't make it a decent movie. It's as if the director thinks throwing a cute blonde girl into action scenes that are ripped out of comic books and video games makes a movie.

The story is bland and hardly worth caring about, and scenes are broken up into 2 (actually 3) different realities for the main character. One is reality, the other a delusion, the other a sub delusion (or more like filler to take away attention from what's going on in the delusion). Sorry, but this doesn't give anyone fair reason to compare it to The Matrix or Inception, which had stories to back the concepts. The delusional mind of a mental patient in this case is hardly worth being called a story.

I had wanted to see it in the theaters, but reviews all over the place kept me from going to see it. Infact, just now remembering that a review from Gawker kept me home. Now I'm out $6 and 90 minutes of my life I can't get back.

To like this movie, I would imagine you'd have to be a very shelted 10yr old boy who is easily impressed by mediocre special effects, and a plot that's so boring that an ameoba would fall asleep.

Trying not to give anything away, my main point is this: Zach Snyder has created a modern-day masterpiece of a live-action adaptation of a fantasy anime film.  Phantasmagorical, fantastical, imaginative, enthralling, impossibly entertaining, Mr. Snyder has managed to transport the viewer into a world unlike any other, full of possibilities.  Reminiscent of mid to late 90's anime, this film makes real the imagination that was thoroughly fleshed out in films of the day, such as Metropolis, Akira, and Evangelion.  Just imagine those films, with live actors, and stunning visuals, and you'll get an inkling of what this film can be for you.

I was completely entertained by this film.  The story line is a steamroller of fantastic design, but without much character development.  The characters seem to pinball from one crisis to the next, until the eye-opener of an ending, heart-stopping in its intensity, but thoroughly addictive.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone willing to listen, if I could sit still long enough trying to describe it.

There were a handful of dissenters, notably Betsy Sharkey of the LA Times, who said she wouldn't have missed it for the world, but there always are a few eccentric responses to anything. So, when the DVD slid into the player last night I fully expected momentarily to go screaming from the room in agony because fumbling for the remote would take too long. I didn't.

Did the mainstream critics and I see the same movie? Many of the reviews were written by people I respect and with whom I usually agree. I don't agree this time. I saw the same movie Betsy did and I'm with her. Yes, of course this film exploits adolescent fantasies. I don't think the trailers hid that aspect. Do we need to list the many highly regarded movies that play to adolescent fantasies?

Basic plot: wrongfully committed to a high security asylum by a corrupt stepfather, ""Baby Doll"" seeks freedom while indulging in two layers of fantasy.

Just go with the flow of this surreal and beautifully filmed movie. It does make sense in its own dark way. It's true that video game references are not original to this film (see Scott Pilgrim as one example), but this movie handles them well. The heroine's journey is not a warm and fuzzy one.  It won't leave you feeling cheerful inside. But I didn't leave the room.

Clearly a lot of people truly hate this movie, and I can't guarantee you won't be one of them. But if the idea of a blend of Shutter Island (2010), Teenage Doll (1957) and the Nintendo game Zelda, the Ocarina of Time doesn't strike you as outlandish, you just might like Sucker Punch.

4357443,1,B004EPYZU8,"A young girl named Baby Doll in a mental asylum is scheduled to undergo a lobotomy. She retreats into her imagination, along with other residents of the asylum, and plots an adventurous escape.

Director Zack Synder is a genius when it comes to design. His films 300 and Watchmen are rich, visual marvels, though Watchmen was a mishap when it came to storyline. Watch a trailer of Sucker Punch and it's clear Snyder knows his strengths; he has stuck with delivering fantastic, arresting graphics to the screen.

But while this may seem an uber-cool, surreal flick, note the elephant in the room: the young age of the characters.  The film is cast with a bevy of attractive, young actresses decked out in sleek, skimpy costumes designed to highlight their sexuality. Clips and stills from the film also emphasize the overt sexuality of the production. This may not seem like much to modern audiences, but stop and think about this for a moment. There is a definite pedophilic vibe to the whole production---the lead character's name is Baby Doll for a reason. She is committed to the asylum by her wicked step-father and is described in all of the marketing material as being a ""young girl."" The director, himself, referred to this film as ""Alice in Wonderland with machine guns""---but Alice was a young girl. Why hasn't Snyder been held accountable, even questioned about his using underage female characters in an highly sexualized and violent film? How is the sensationalism of this production going to further erode morality within our culture---to the further detriment of what should be one of our society's greatest treasures: our young women?

Baby Doll escapes into a fantasy world she has created in her own mind. Which is more real to her---the fantasy or the horrors of reality? While fantasy is always fun to watch, it's a great delivery system for worldview.

We often find the fake world of the film to be presented as comparable or even superior to the real world.  Then comes the eventual questioning of which world is actually real (think The Matrix). This blurring of the line between reality and fantasy promotes, often subconsciously, the idea that our world is defined not by established rules and shared experiences, but by the perceptions of the individual. If there are no shared experiences, there is no shared morality or expectations.  Again, man is left to fend for himself.

4357612,4,B004EPYZU8,"I was really excited when Sucker Punch came out in theaters.  I went to see it right away based on the previews.  Here's the deal (with no spoilers):

1.  The film is beautiful.  It's just pleasing to watch.  The female characters and the scenes.  It's a big movie.

2.  It's a great ride, but a bit of a downer.

3.  The story is a little bizarre.  You need to suspend a lot of disbelief to enjoy the movie.  It's Alice in Wonderland meets the Matrix.

4.  Lots of action.  Girls kicking *ss ala Kill Bill, but with big guns too.

5.  Interesting mix of futuristic and old, again reminiscent of the Matrix.

When the movie ended, I wasn't sure if I liked it or hated it.  I was glad I saw it though.  I plan to watch it again.",1309478400,6,727,4.086330935251799
4357613,4,B004EPYZU8,"I really enjoyed Sucker Punch. I am a huge fan of special effects and sexy babes in skimpy costumes with big guns, and this very atmospheric movie had all that in spades. I read that the critics didn't like it, but I say phooey on them! I rarely enjoy the high-brow stuff that the critics like anyway.

Will you like this movie? If you saw and enjoyed Terry Gilliam's quirky scifi movie BRAZIL, then I am very confident you will also enjoy this one. In fact the ending of both movies felt exactly the same way to me: Both had disturbing doctor scenes at the end, followed by paradise and bliss.

If you watched Inception and did NOT like it, then you probably won't care for Sucker Punch --because both films interweave at least four different stories throughout the film. There is the ""real"" story of the insane asylum; there is the fantasy story of the angry male lead; there is the fantasy story of the female lead; and there is the unresolved and peculiar story of the bus driver.

For me, the mixture of fantasy and reality was very entertaining and captivating.",1309478400,4,1067,4.518134715025907
4357614,4,B004EPYZU8,"My daughter and I saw the movie before it went out of the cinema.  We each had our own impression of the movie.  My daughter thought it dark, and had trouble following the plot of the movie.  While the theme has darkness in it (main star's evil step father, what happened to her mother and sister, and then what was happening to her).  I found the plot to be extremely deep.  If you felt you were in a no win situation, would you do your best to help others around you?  Or would you just cave in and let it be?  Sucker Punch, to me, is about a young lady who is courageous, bold, and has the spirit to continue on in the face of what appears to be certain defeat. To do so in a way that helps others, and gives her peace in the end knowing she smiled at the face of what would be death for most of us.",1309478400,7,802,3.9135802469135803

4357616,1,B004EPYZU8,"Just a really poor movie. Non-sensical story used to jump between sci-fi action sequences. It made little sense, was misogynistic in nature, and just boring. It's like a 1970s ""women in prison"" movie without nudity. Even adding nudity would not have saved this clunker.

What I wonder is who's spending millions to make junk like this? Why not just donate 1/100th of the film budget to me. I could write a better script.",1309392000,16,420,4.7534246575342465
4357617,4,B004EPYZU8,"If there was ever a movie made in the last decade that divided movie go-ers in terms of ""is it any good"" it was Sucker Punch. Panned hard by pretty much every critic worth noting, Sucker Punch seemed to prove that CGI + Live Action Anime Girls =/= success. However, there was a rather large group of movie go-ers that claimed there was more than meets the eye, as the saying goes...

Rather then debate weather or not the movie is any good, lets look at the technical aspects of the Extended Blu-ray Edition:

VIDEO: 9/10

The transfer is awesome! I originally saw this on IMAX, so the scope obviously isn't there, but everything else is! I was rather disappointed with some of the grainy imaging in some scenes (especially when in Baby Dolls REAL world), but you could immediately tell that it looks better on the small screen. Added/Extended Scenes are consistent and unless you had scene the original you would never know the difference. Nothing in this movie is consistent pallet-wise, but that was always the point. This movie really knows how to make dark and dingy into sweet and sexy.

AUDIO: 10/10

The real winner here is the audio track. The 5.1 really comes alive in the dance sequences when coupled with the movie's amazing soundtrack. Its a good shoot-em-up mix that has everything you want in it. This is definitely a movie you would want a soundtrack-only audio track included, but we didn't find one. The added musical number in the Extended Edition (Love Is The Drug)is really cool. NOTE~ If playing this disk on something not named PS3, ensure your player is updated to its latest firmware. 2 test players of ours experienced strange audio/video skips and de-synching. A quick firmware update fixed everything easy.

Overall: 4/5

No matter of technical achievement can hide the fact that this movie REALLY makes no real sense. Its a great flick to watch with your rocker friends after getting sloshed in the rain because of the cool soundtrack. But if there is meaning to be found in the lightly written dialog its gonna take a lot of patients and imagination. Zack Snyder never struck me as a deep thinker/meaning kind of guy.",1309392000,3,2147,4.724598930481283
4357618,4,B004EPYZU8,"I liked this movie! People are very hard on it.  Sure the narrative is a little rough.  Could it use some smoothing? Yes.  Is it hopeless? No.  I found that the movie kept me entertained and the different venues for battles and plot progression kept the movie feeling fresh.  If you are the kind of person who goes to the movies to be entertained still and not worried about whether or not this movie is the next Godfather or Inception or (insert some award winner here), then get it!  Favorite part of this movie: Special Effects!!!!",1309392000,5,534,4.510416666666667
4357619,5,B004EPYZU8,"The critics hated this movie and I just don't understand why. In this day and age we complain about remakes, reboots, and sequels but when an original movie comes along it gets trashed. I was expecting the world with this movie and it did not disappoint. From the beginning to the end I was entertained and that is what a movie is supposed to do. The plot was simple enough to follow. Girl gets locked in a mental institution. Girl tries to escape. Along the way she imagines different scenarios to deal with what is going on in the real world. It follows Inception with the ""dream within a dream"" idea. The music for the movie was unquestionably one of the best scores I've ever heard. Every song matched with the scene it was played with. Of course I can't get away without mentioning the visuals. Zack Snyder is one of the best today with how he portrays a scene. His work with 300 and Watchmen was well worth it when he did Sucker Punch. I can't begin to express how good this movie really is.",1309392000,7,997,4.365591397849462

My boyfriend and I were very excited to see this. Thinking that we had saved money by not going to see it in the theaters, I went out on a limb and bought this Blu-ray the day it was released. So last night we sat down and watched it... all 2+ hours of the Extended Cut.
I agree with the critics. It seems like three or four different movies put together. I caught myself several times looking at the clock to see what time it was or scowling at the tv! My boyfriend, who loves a lot of movies (more movies than me!) gives a C- on his grading scale.

The scenes jump from one place to another and starts to remind me of the ending to Wizard of Oz - where Dorthy says she had a dream and everyone was in it. I never figured out what the plot of the whole story was. So I give it 3 stars = 2 for the Action and sort of excitement and 1 star for showing how strong women can take over an action movie.",1309392000,3,494,4.0
4357656,5,B004EPYZU8,"The extended cut of Sucker Punch adds approximately 17 minutes and 45 seconds of additional footage, and is R-rated.  The extended cut is much darker than the theatrical cut; while not necessarily being more visually explicit, previously implied suggestions are now explicitly overt.  The violence and action scenes have also been extended as well, with two re-inserted battle sequences, one with the orcs at the castle (arterial spurts of green orc blood), and the other with the German World War I zombies.

I don't think I quite understand Snyder's multi-layered metaphorical comparisons between the brothel, asylum, and Baby Doll's fantasy worlds, but I will say that the movie (especially the action sequences) are visually stunning, and the colors beautifully contrasted.  Credit especially to the actresses for their proficient firearms handling (but where exactly did they store all those extra magazines I wonder?).  However, it would be superficial to suggest that Sucker Punch is only about girls in anime costumes fighting monsters in fantasy worlds, though that is certainly an interpretation shared by many critics who panned the movie.

Here are the main differences between the Extended Cut and Theatrical Cut; NOTE, SPOILERS FOLLOW, so continue reading at your own risk.

(1) Baby Doll shoots at the stepfather a second time (as compared to a single time in the theatrical cut), resulting in some CG blood and an arm bullet wound, which the stepfather grabs at.

(2) When Sweet Pea first meets Baby Doll (with Blue and the priest), Sweet Pea says, ""the priest brought you here from the orphanage to lose your virginity, right?"".  Then Blue says, ""The High Roller is coming in 5 days to do a little flower picking..""  There is no such comment about deflowering in the theatrical cut.

(3) Rocket takes Baby Doll on an extended tour of the nightclub, showing her a backstage area where clients are not allowed.  She shows Baby Doll the cleaning closet where new girls are assigned cleaning duties.  They pass by the kitchen where the chef makes a lewd face at the girls, who ignore him, and walk onwards.

(4) Full dance number of ""Love is a Drug"" as performed by Blue & Vera.  It's quite extravagant.

(5) The cook attacks Rocket more violently and physically in the extended cut.

(6) The backstage scene where Baby Doll explains her plans is extended.  Vera writes the order of the dancers, with Sweet Pea performing first.  Rocket and Sweet Pea then sit down, and Sweet Pea tells Rocket that she won't help Baby Doll.

(7) In the World War I scene, the Wiseman briefs the girls for a little longer.  The map they are to capture is a map of the trenches and troop locations, the map will be sent via courier by zeppelin.  The Wiseman then asks Amber how she likes the mech, to which Amber replies in the affirmative.  The Extended Cut includes a great shot of the girls slowly walking out of the fog into no man's land, and additional shots of zombie German troops rushing out of their respective trenches.  Amber shoots down several attack German fighters before herself flying skyward, and Blondie grabs her Daewoo K3 and mows down a horde of attacking zombies, littering the battlefield with their corpses.  There is additional hand-to-hand and (hatchet-to-bayonet vis a vis Blondie) combat in the trenches, and Baby Doll fights the Zombie commander initially in an extended sword fight.  I'm glad they extended the WWI sequence, it looks fantastic.

(8) Vera tries to cheer up Baby Doll pre-performance with a quote by Mark Twain about illusions.

(9) The orc/castle/knight siege scene has been heavily extended, most prominently featuring a new scene of the girls jumping into the courtyard, and decimating the orcs using firearms and edged weapons, while performing various acrobatic maneuvers.  Green orc blood spray across the screen.  Additional shot of knights trying to break through the gate with a tree trunk.  Extended combat scene of girls versus knights, and slow-motion scene of Blondie firing the side machine gun.

(10) Blue tells Baby Doll that he will ""pop that smile right off of her face"", whereas in the theatrical cut, he falters without completing the sentence.

(11) The sequence where Amber is killed shows Blue's gun being fired twice, rather than the slight vibration in the wine glass.  Blue shoots Blondie when she's on the ground an additional time.  Nothing graphic is shown.

(12) Blue attacks Baby Doll for a longer period of time (and more physically) in the extended cut, when backstage.

(13)  After Baby Doll is knocked unconscious, Sweet Pea steals a white dress while on the lam.

(14) During the last, infamous scene between the High Roller and Baby Doll, white gloved hands undress Baby Doll down to her skivvies.  High Roller and Baby Doll talk, and High Roller doesn't just want to deflower Baby Doll; rather, he wishes to grant her freedom from everything, in essence, granting her absolution.  Baby Doll seems quite taken and the two begin to kiss passionately, but no nudity is shown.  The Extended Cut directly links Baby Doll's deflowering in the brothel to her lobotomy in the real world; I can understand why this scene was cut to make the PG-13 rating, as it's rather sexually suggestive.",1309305600,497,5260,4.944191343963554

Films of this type have to be taken for what they are worth, if you saw the trailer and other films by this director and team, you know pretty much what to expect.  Since this film was all about style and not substance one must judge it on those mertis or lack therof.  It looked and sounded fantastic.  I agree with those who point out, rightfully so, that the line between the dream world and the real world is, at best, blurry.  I agree.  Also this film suffered from the ""Lovely Bones"" issue of rating.  The target ticket buyers can't go to an R rated film.  The subject matter is R rated, what to do?  Make a confusing, yet visually stunning picture and hope no one notices, then release ""Extended"" version later to home video market.  I know, I know, I don't like it either, but with the cost of making a film, this happens.  I love Emily Browning, she doesn't really have to say anything, I have often wondered if she was a real person or if she only exists on film or in some digital never never land, she is fantastic in this bizaar, missunderstood oddity of a film.  BTW if you need a blu ray player check wallmart or AMazon, you can get one super cheap.  They are worth it.

I could complain extensively about this but, obviously, those responsible DON'T CARE WHAT I THINK. Which is what has created this prejudice manifesting in real-world terms of the product disparity. I was even going to buy the BluRay combo pack just to get the extended cut of the film until I read on the back of the box that the extended cut in the combo pack was only on the BluRay disc.

The reason with out spoling anything is tht there is way tooo much un-explained in this movie. What is missing is greater then a leap of faith that is explained in the end

To know more I have to state SPOLIER ALERT information below you may not want to know before watching the movie. Ok that said lets get to the un-explained:

1) The Dance the female lead in the movie does this dance that makes people just focus only on her they are aware of nothing going on around them. What is this dance we have no idea we never get to see anymore then her swaying back and forth for a few seconds.

2) The fight scenes at first she is alone in them then in the second fight scene she is joined with others how is that are they danceing also are they aware of the fight scene?

3) we have all watched movies where part of it takes place in a dream world but now we have a movie where the dream world has a dream world.

4) The core story that started the movie what happen to it. It is never resolved.

This is a movie for those that perfer not to look for a good story just flashy things going on on the screen with no meaning or reason. I have to say most of the fight scenes are great but you could get that in any video game cut scene. The 2 stars I gave it is only due to the great looking fight scenes.

4357661,3,B004EPYZU8,"""A sensory overload"" would best describe this movie.

My BR Disc Review:
 It will give your sound system a workout.  The effects and images are in a word, Awesome!

The story itself is a bit convoluted. I understand this is all taking place in ""Babydoll's"" mind, but the action that takes place in the real world does not properly build up enough to understand why the Protagonist is who she is.  The whole opening sequence is essentially a 10 minute montage, and I won't give anything away but the opening action seems to be the most crucial part of the story and it is essentially glossed over.

This movie had so much potential for me when I read about it, but it fell short in the story telling.  I was most emotionally attached to the movie at the beginning and spent the next 1.5 hours growing detached from the story.
Compared to the other ""Teen SciFi"" which has come out recently (Push, I am Number 4, etc.)  this movie is far better in my own opinion.

Bottom Line:
If you are a fan of the stylistic action of movies like 300 and Kill Bill; or you want a a movie to test the limits of you stereo system;  You should definitely put this movie at least on your rental list.",1309305600,4,1180,4.322727272727272
4357662,5,B004EPYZU8,"I wrote this review mainly in response to Sucker Punch's 22% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In my honest opinion that number is quite simply ridiculous. Sucker Punch so far has been one of the greatest films of 2011.

Yes there are some scenes in this movie which some view as rip-offs of other films. Here is what I said about Hollywood in response, so what?  We live in a world where remakes come out every other week and their sequels made to 30 year old films that have no business being revisited. Sucker Punch did nothing wrong here, Sucker Punch saw great movies and said to itself what can I do better?

And there were plenty of things that Sucker Punch did that were better. Look at the scene that mirrors, Lord of the Rings. Now, Lord of the Rings is one of the most treasured franchises in all of cinema but its protagonists were incredibly annoying. Sucker Punch did something that J.R.R. Tolkien was afraid to do, introduced hot women the equation. Is that really so wrong?

There are other parts of this movie the mirror Kill Bill. But where Kill Bill faltered, Sucker Punch succeeded. There was only one good-looking girl in Kill Bill. Sucker Punch had several. Once again, this is much better.

Other critics have said this movie too closely resembles the videogame. My answer, no such thing. Videogames try and look real, movies John look real. If every review videogame said, this looks too real then no video games would sell. The double standard in Hollywood is ridiculous here.

What does it say about we as a nation when we cannot appreciate the true gems that Hollywood has put forth? Director Zack Snyder has made a masterpiece here and yet only 22% of all critics can appreciate. This is absurd.  I highly encourage you to check this movie out. You will not regret it. This movie does not set out forth to abolish laws set by its predecessors. It comes rather, to complete, and it does so quite well.

Sucker Punch had so far been the greatest movie of 2011, bar none. Everyone should take the opportunity to own this gem on Blu-ray or DVD.",1309305600,8,2070,4.560646900269542
4357663,2,B004EPYZU8,"I bought this movie thinking it was going to be a kick ass action movie with hot girls, well at least they got the last part right. It almost seems like they either had two writers write completely different stories and then piece them together or they wanted to add ""depth"" to a movie that was a TnA action movie. Honestly with movies like this, or what it should have been, I don't want to ""think"" that hard, if I want that I'll watch Inception or Pans Lanbrynth. It's like she's crazy and imagines herself as a berlesque dancer but that imaginary world is so messed up she imagines herself in another imaginary world fighting things.....what??! Other than the girls(especially Jamie Chung and Vanessa Hudgens) being hot and maybe 2 good imaginary fight scenes, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1309305600,5,800,4.7214285714285715
4357664,5,B004EPYZU8,"This was a great action film, from start to end. I liked the main hot girls, especially Baby Doll. It takes place in a mental asylum and Baby Doll has a few days to escape before she gets a lobotomy. She uses her mind to create an alternative world and every time she dances, she again goes into a different world, but where all the good action is at. The music was great and the whole idea and plot was wicked. A real hardcore film that packs a sucker punch!",1309305600,4,459,4.111111111111111
4357734,2,B004EPYZU8,"I expected a great movie. I was cheated. The story started off great. The opening scene is very breathtaking. It falls apart once they make it to the mental hospital and the main characters tries to escape using her imagination and some newly made friends. Here's what I hated, the dream within a dream. The asylum disappears completely and somehow the place becomes a gentleman's club. Why? Why create an extra layer. The hospital was a gritty place to tell a story. You lose what really happens to this girl and her new band. It doesn't add up how she really forms such quick friendships. Whats worse is we learn very little of the main troupe. I would have loved to see cuts of Baby Doll in and out of dream world. She sees giant samurai, we see huge orderlies; she sees a sword, we see a knife; she sees world war one trenches, we see crawl spaces. I guess I expected ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest meets Kill Bill"" what I got was ""Inception meets Kill Bill meets A Clockwork Orange."" It would have been more chewable if it really was just a story about a girl combat group fighting evil robots. The writer/director does great visual work, but his story telling needs some work. You need to feel for these characters, and you really don't.

I give it two stars. The visuals were amazing, but little else held my attention, which is sad because the main cast is five amazingly beautiful young ladies.",1309305600,9,1404,4.484375
4357735,5,B004EPYZU8,"I absolutely love the movie! I've been waiting for this day since I was in the theater in March! This is a one-of-a-kind movie, I've never seen anything like this! I strongly disagree with those who claim it has no story. It does have a story, even though the story is very simple, it is being told in a very special way: through a series of metaphors and symbolism. This movie takes your imagination to its limit! you may need to watch it multiple times to understand every bit of the symbolism used in the film. The extensive use of symbolism also opens up the opportunity for a long post-movie debate with fellow movie lovers! Last but not least, if all else fails, the 4 action sequences will be worth collecting!

Now Sucker Punch comes in Extended cut and Movie-only, what's the difference? The extended cut comes with 2 separate Blu-ray Discs, 1 for theatrical cut, and one for the R-rated Extended cut. I'm guessing the Blu-ray movie-only edition will just include the theatrical cut disc you find in the extended cut pack.

The extended cut is the original cut, I can see it's intended to be rated for
PG-13, no nudity or gore or F words or anything, but words are the MPAA insisted
on rating it R, so Snyder had to cut it down to the theatrical edition. The
thing to note is, the extended cut does not change the story line. there are
little bits and pieces added to existing scenes, and 2 full scenes not seen in
the theatrical release. So keep this in mind if you're deciding which version to
get, or if you want to know what you missed in the theaters.

In general, I have mixed feelings for the extended vs. theatrical cut. So I will
list all the changes I noticed, if you've seen the theatrical release, there
wont be any spoilers as I said the story is mainly the same.

*******!!!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!!!!!!!********

Extra/Extended Scenes in Extended Cut:

1. Opening Scene: Babydoll fired a second shot at her stepfather after the
first, where the bullet goes through his arm

2. Sweet pea meets babydoll, the conversation involves clear statements such as
""The priest brought her here to lose her virginity, right?""

3. When Rocket gives Babydoll the tour around the theater, it shows details of
the cleaning supply room and the cook.

4. A full scene that shows the club's busy hours. girls dancing on stage for
customers to pick, what customers do, what girls do. here, all the main
characters and addition girls each get about a 5-second cut of a dance on stage
(except Babydoll who's cleaning). this is the same song ""Love is the drug"" as we
see in the ending credits in the theatrical cut.

5. in the dressing room scene where Babydoll first explains her plan, Madam
Gorski writs on the small white board the dance schedule, and the conversation
between Sweet Pea and Rocket is slightly longer.

6. The German steam soldier scene has added bits and pieces here and there.
Wiseman's briefing is more detailed and more shots of the girls fighting (one
shot where Blondie kills a field of soldiers, IMO it's a bit too long, the fight
between Babydoll and the commander is about 2 seconds longer, and the chase
after the map is about 5 seconds longer)

7. Madam Gorski gives Babydoll a small pep talk before her first dance for the
Mayer.

8. In the dragon scene, about 2 minutes added showing the girls fighting the
creatures. Here the music is synchronized differently from the theatrical cut on
the few shots that gets kept in the theatrical cut. There are also a few
2-second bits that are added. The flow is still very good IMO

9, Blue's lecture after Amber steals the lighter is slightly longer. One notable
change is where Blue says to Babydoll ""I would...."" in the theatrical cut, he
says ""I would take you right now, and and I would pop that smile right off your
face""

10. Blue's lecture before he executes the girls, he says ""... me, your father, you're lover, you're employer!"" instead of ""...me, your friend, your protector, your employer!""

11. When Blue executes Amber, it shows the gun's recoil instead of the glass of

12. And finally, the scene everyone's been talking about, the intimate
conversation between Babydoll and Highroller. There is one long and deep
conversation where the highroller offers Babydoll freedom in exchange for her
giving herself to him. This is a very PG-13 scene, no nudity, not even partial
nudity! I do not get the MPAA...

fyi, i am a 45 year old mother of 3, two out of the nest and a 4 year old. all boys...but if i had a daughter i would sit down with her and hope she absorbs the essence of this film. breathtaking, stunning, exhilerating.

""Who teaches us whats real, and how to laugh at lies. Who decides why we live, and what we'll die to defend. Who trains us, and who holds the key to set us free. It's you. You have all the weapons you need. Now fight!""

oh yes, fight with the weapons you have inside yourself. what better lesson can we teach our children? do your girls a favor, fairytales belong in the 60's. it's 2011, prince charming is not coming to save you. save yourself. amen, sucker punch.

step away from the norm, be brave and go for it. you might be pleasantly surprised by how it makes you feel.

i hope you didn't expect me to babble about the plot, blah blah blah...there's enough reviews doing that. i just felt compelled to say how it made me feel.",1309219200,20,1156,4.260273972602739
4357737,5,B004EPYZU8,"Since the critics universally gave this movie a ""sucker punch"", I immediately knew this would be an entertaining movie worth my time. Suffice it to say that they are movie critics since they cannot make it in the ""real"" world like the rest of us. Their lack of imagination insures they cannot possibly understand a movie on this level, way too complicated for them. Too many levels of imagery, allegorical interpretation, and symbology for them to have to sort through.

My daughter and I both agreed that we liked it, on many different levels. This movie is an excellent blend of a good moral story, sacrifice of one's self for others (the 5th element needed in the story-line from the wise character portrayed by Scott Glenn in Baby Doll's fantasies - who makes a surprise ""real-world"" appearance at a critical moment at the end of the film leaving us wondering) mind-blowing Matrix style action, surprisingly good acting (if this same level of acting had been in a boring ass movie made on a $50k budget with no special effects, filmed in France, it would have probably been a critically aclaimed gem by the critics, premiered at the Can Film festival), mind-blowing special effects that would make George Lucas proud, a kick-ass sound-track; these all insure this movie is worth 2 hours of your time.

The movie starts off with a enveloping story immediately, with Baby Doll, the young, petite, beautifully genuine young lady, placed in the mental institution by her abusive step-father after the death of her mother, also after she desperately tried to stop him from sexually abusing her little sister. In the struggle with her step-father, she discovered her sister had been killed.

The rest of the show details Baby Doll and her new friends from the institution/brothel in their plan to escape their chains of bondage into freedom.

Baby Doll uses her vivid imagination (the source of the fabulous special effects that abound in this movie) in order to escape from the erotic dances she is forced to perform for the evil men that surround her. Ironically, this enables Baby Doll to draw upon her fabulous imagination in order to maintain her sanity within the insane asylum, as well as her courage and spirit that she needs to lead the other girls in their attempt to overcome the evil men that surround them. This leads to an important morale of this story; never give up - never give in (Dare Devil style). No matter the consequences. No matter the cost. Evil men must NOT prevail. EVER. (This includes movie critics).

This is a movie that triumphs in it's theme of the unsuppressable nature of the goodness and unquenchable power of human spirit, and the ultimate sacrifice of good to win over evil. A sacrifice that has been repeatedly performed throughout the Millenia of human existance, that insure good wins in the end - every time. A concept a movie critic, devoid of all imagination, cannot possibly understand.....

The Amazon critic here just simply doesn't get it. There was actually an insane asylum posing as a front for the brothel that the girls were effectively slaved to. The critic writes that the brothel was in Baby Doll's imagination. What an idiot. All he can see is 5 scantily clad, sexually stimulating women in Japanese style, body bending, mind-numbing visual and audio special effects overload, repleat with rocket launchers, gatlin guns, 6th century Jananese and samuri swords, machine guns, colt 45's, zepplins, and one very cute ""pink bunny rabbit"" killer girl-controlled robot. By the way, these components are good as well....

People need to actually have an open-mind to understand a work as creative as this show. Given enough time, it will become a cult-classic.",1309219200,10,3709,4.915335463258786
4357738,4,B004EPYZU8,"This movie, at least at its top level, is not about femininity, female empowerment, or exploiting sexuality (or cynical pretenses of those things).  It's about oppression and injustice in the abstract.  The brothel is just as much a fantasy/allegory as the ""video game"" setpieces.  If the plot is seen as fighting injustice rather than a quest for freedom, the end pays off beautifully, especially if one tracks the talismans with the five stages of grief.

The action is not ""next gen"".  Aside from a beautiful long continuous shot through robots, it's excellent but normal action filmmaking, with some annoying cliches thrown in.  This likely isn't a ""wow"" movie that'll catapult itself into your top five.  But for me at least, it was a thought-provoker that demanded more than two viewings and made me glad to buy it.  Opposite nearly every critics' review, it's all about the substantive story, not the action.

I wasn't as impressed as others with the ""maximum movie mode"" extra.  A lively audio commentary conveys more information than these sparse interviews with simple green screen footage.

The bottom line for me, though, is that in today's climate any movie that even makes an effort to be different should get an automatic three stars.  Then it's uphill from there.",1309219200,3,1279,5.009478672985782

4357742,5,B004EPYZU8,"I won't review the movie in full. There are many other reviews here, good and bad.

However, if considering a purchase, I want to stress to be sure you order the combo pack, which includes the Extended Edition. (The theatrical and extended editions each come on separate Bluray Disks in the pack).

I enjoyed the theatrical film when I saw it in the theater, but the extended edition flows much better and is a much more satisfying experience. I'm not sure how many people and critics who hated the movie in theaters will be swayed by the extended cut, but I think that most people who at least somewhat enjoyed the original cut will get much more out of the extended cut.

For people who missed Sucker Punch in theaters, skip the standard edition and go right for the extended edition. It provides a much fuller experience and it's easier to understand than the cut down theatrical cut.

It should be noted that the extended edition is Rated R, not NR. It is the cut of the film that the director had intended for theatrical release. The studio insisted on the movie being released as PG13, which is why we got the less satisfying, more confusing theatrical release. After watching the extended cut, I came to two very clear conclusions: The MPAA ratings board system is completely broken for giving the extended edition an R rating and the Studio made a horrible decision in forcing a cut that would prune the rating to PG13. It's beyond me how the deleted scenes would raise the rating from PG13 to R. It's also beyond me how the studio believed it would be better to have a somewhat ""crippled"" PG13, that really suffers from the cuts, rather than just going with the much better R rated version.

Also, shame on the studio for not offering the extended cut on the standard bluray edition, nor in the DVD edition. Fortunately for blu-ray owners, the price premium here on Amazon is miniscule, but sadly, people still stuck on DVDs miss out entirely.",1309219200,,1952,4.6138328530259365

4357834,1,B004EPYZU8,"Honestly, I don't get why this movie has so many stars, it's really frustrating to me.

I was PUMPED for this movie to come out at least a year before it was released.  I even told everyone about how pumped I was whenever it was mentioned!  I was eating crow after finally getting to see it opening night though.

The beginning had me wanting to find out more but after the second or third action sequence I had to hold myself back from walking out of the theater.  There's not much story or substance to what's going on here.  The CG, costume design, music, and scenery are stunning eye candy but they do absolutely nothing to hide the horrible non-existent storyline and overly long playing time.  I wanted SO bad for this movie to succeed but in the end I just couldn't muster up the courage to admit I picked a bad one.

4357835,4,B004EPYZU8,"Zack Snyder has got to be one of the more ambitious directors around today. After doing a decent job retelling George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, making an awesome graphic novel-to-movie interpretation of 300, to making the love-or-hate, also graphic novel turned movie in The Watchmen; Zack Snyder has a good reputation of having style, if nothing else. But how does his own, original work fare? Well for most, not so well. Most have made plenty of comparisons to Inception and The Matrix. However, Snyder set out to make one thing: a movie that was to be fun, loud, and completely insane...and that's what he delivered. Is it original, no, but it is a fun movie that has some stellar action scenes with cool use of slow-motion. Outside of the action, the interpersonal stories of Babydoll, Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber, and Blondie work for this type of movie. While the story isn't perfect, and has some plot holes, this is infinitely times better than some movie Hollywood puts out today. Style wins over substance with Sucker Punch, and sometimes, that's all a movie needs.

*The Extended Cut ( original R-rated version ) doesn't add much to the movie. You get an extra scene with Rocket and Babydoll, a couple extended fight scenes, and a more robust ending ( just because of the extra footage of the High Roller and Babydoll )

PQ- as with most Warner Bros. titles, Sucker Punch is a stunner. Reference material? Just about. When the girls are in the asylum, the colors are clear, but sometimes look a bit flat, skin tones look a bit pale, and grain occasionally rears (to some's taste, but not mine) its ugly head. I know that this is probably how Snyder wanted it to look, given the atmosphere. However, when the Babydoll an the other girls are in the fantasy worlds, LOOK OUT! Mainly due to the ambient pieces being CGI, and different cameras being in use, colors are bright, clear, and this shows the quality of Blu-ray. Black levels are dark without being indistinguishable, skin tones are spot on, and grain is a no-show. Overall, when watching this in a theater with a digital projector, I was blown away. Watching this at home on a 1080p t.v., I am speechless.

AQ- lossless audio, what a friend you are when watching a movie like this. Speech levels were perfect, gunshots were loud, and explosions will shake your speakers. Even the music that played in the background had awesome delivery. What else can I say. Even if you hate the movie, the sound field should make you a happy camper.

Extras- surprisingly light, but at the same time, informative. You have 4 animated shorts corresponding to the 4 different fantasy worlds that average around 2.5 minutes long. While neat with their motion comic design, they really didn't add anything to the main story, and while they are prequels to Babydoll and co.'s story, again, they could have been left out. Then there is an inside look at the soundtrack to Sucker Punch, which in essence, is a documentary on the atmosphere and the style of music they play. Although finding out Emily Browning, who played Babydoll, sang a few songs in the movie was really neat.

Overall, like The Watchmen, Sucker Punch will be a love/hate movie. I loved it, especially the actions scenes because they were fast, loud, and adrenaline-pumping. If you go into this movie expecting the next Nolan or Spielberg masterpiece, you will quickly be disappointed.

4357842,2,B004EPYZU8,"I highly anticipated this all-original Snyder film, and the movie is very beautiful: characters, setting, and effects are all top-notch regarding aesthetics.  However, the story leaves much to be desired, and the experience may take a heavy toll on victims of rape.

The plot itself is simple and, at times, bears incomprehensible turns.  Without spoiling anything, there were several points where characters did things for no discernible reason (most notably during the ending).  I have no further criticism for the plot.

The themes of rape and exploitation were laid on very thick and insensitively for what I thought should be a fun action-fantasy film.  For my part, I could not enjoy the film (particularly the very deliberately sexy cast) because of the constant reminders of rape and child exploitation.  Despite the many instances of promotion of feminine empowerment in this film, one wonders how all the female leads and Snyder's own wife had no problem with the final product.  Regardless, anyone who has been victimized with rape or childhood abuse should consider the potential impact of the film: a companion with whom I saw the film opening weekend was rigid through certain parts, and came out in tears, experiencing traumatic flashbacks.  While not universal, certainly, the trauma of those experiences can have long-lasting effects and should be considered when choosing to view this film.",1309046400,5,1408,5.25

This movie starts out as depressing as it could be. A family's mother dies, and in that instant the father runs to check on her will, which will go straight to the family's daughters. He kills the youngest and frames the eldest, Emily Browning's character ""Babydoll"" for the murder.  To shut her up he takes her to a insane asylum. During her ""stay"" she's forced to become part of a dance team within a brothel as babydoll ""imagines"" that the asylum's owner fronts the establishment as an entertainment theater. (Confusing I know!) Now when Babydoll is forced to dance, she jumps into her imagination and creates a weak, poorly thought out plan for an escape. Probably one of the poorest escape plans I've ever seen in a movie.

 Babydoll's imaginary sequences begin as she dances while the other characters aid in finding useful tools for the escape. These action scenes are random and extreme. Where do they come from??, Who knows! It would have been useful for the director to mention that the main character was an artists,writer, or heavy reader or SOMETHING to aid in explaining her extravagant imagination. What I couldn't accept was that these thick imaginative action sequences almost completely veil what was actually occurring in reality. Sure you get to see bits and pieces of the girls stealing a few a essential tools for their escape, but what is Babydoll doing while she's on stage? Since her ""erotic dance"" renders everyone speechless, the audience is forced to guess that her dancing is amazing, but for all we know, she could be spazing out,rolling around on the floor. There's never a cut to see what babydoll comes up with to steal the attention of the guards and asylum workers!

 Another flaw is in the character development. The movie would have benefited if the director shortened or combined a few of the action scenes or ""missions"" for a few essential minutes of dialogue between the girls. Any kind of Witty banter or past stories shared between the girls would have given the audience a chance to get to know and build feelings for all of the characters. Instead, you get a team of random girls who need to escape. Nothing more.

  To be fair, the director did a great job with the visuals. Not the most realistic thing to watch, but cool to look at none the less. The pacing of the fight choreography gave the movie a matrix feel. One more thing was the directors ability to mix imagination with reality. It wasn't the best, but the director cleverly confuses what actually happened at the ending. It brings up a few questions for the audience to answer making a more lasting impression and experience. It almost made me want to watch the movie again. But not really. The action scenes were great too look a, yet a bore, nothing was believable or understandable and the ending made me wish I had never seen it at all.

It's also a movie about making the best out of your situation, dreaming big, and self-sacrifice. The plot isn't deep until you think about it, but it never gets less confusing. The weakest part of this movie is it's barely-masked lack of character development; I don't feel like I know any of the characters.

The concept of a reality that exists only in the character's minds is potentially interesting but despite the opportunity for depth and creativity, it ends up a mere vehicle to bring us to the over-the-top action sequences.  This is certainly not of the same caliber as 300 even if all the parts seem to be there.  The pacing is monotonous and the danger is fake.  I didn't feel that the characters were actually in a fight for their lives until an hour had passed and by then I'd already become a bit numb.

But even when we are hellbent on seeing things explode and people and creatures get slaughtered, in the back of our minds; deep inside a small crevice we also desire to see some coherence; some connection to the hero and some immerison in what's going on in the silver screen.
Unfortunately, Sucker Punch is just a hollow punch. It hits you square in the jaw with its stylised environments and sepia coloring (too much like ""300"" which was a way better movie) and stops there. It feels too long and too stretched. Characters are shallow even for an action movie. You feel no connection to the movie. The saddest thing is I ended up being bored so much that the ending which probably was supposed to shake me somewhat had no effect at all.
Sucker Punch is a good idea that looks good but ultimately is a failure.",1308182400,4,1133,4.425837320574162

4358073,2,B004EPYZU8,"I watched this movie on opening day and boy did I feel ripped off... I've also read allot of reviews over the months and wanted to try and convey exactly what is really going on with this film to help others make a logical choice weather to buy the ticket and take the ride.

Honestly, I really wanted to like it :(

People who review the film throw words and phrases around like ""misguided"" or ""misunderstood""... I'd agree, things like using Sweet Dreams in the opening sequence was terribly misguided by the director and set's an odd tone right from the word go in my opinion.

This movie is supposed to be a story about empowerment, which is admirable. The two biggest flaws in it seem to be as follows. The trailer leads you to believe it's going to have allot of sexy girls in short skirts leaping around fighting crazy robots and monsters with swords and machine guns. Which it does have, however this accounts for less then half the film... about 40-50 minutes on the generous side, broken into 4 sequences through out the film.

The majority of the film is more like Little Orphan Anne meets Moulin Rouge, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What is bad however is in order to get a PG-13 rating allot of this portion of the film had scenes of a mature nature cut or trimmed way down. This kills allot of momentum of the film, but most importantly it removes the feeling of danger and pearl we should feel for all the main characters. At first I felt it was because the story is ""a dream, within' a dream"", but have since realized it's because it's PG-13. There's a cap on what we will see as an audience which brings the level of engagement way down. Nothing on screen will be as terrible as what we can imagine in the same situation. When a scene comes that leads us to believe something unsavory is about to happen, we automatically know it won't be that bad, due to the rating... something will intervene to keep us safe at PG13.  Together these two elements really hurt the film because we, as an audience quickly realize two things. First, due to it being a dream, the characters are never really in true pearl and secondly that in situations where the characters are in a position to have unthinkable physical harm befall them, on or off screen it's never as terrible because it's a PG-13 dream... honestly, it would have been better if it was exactly the same movie but with an R rating so the viewer isn't preconditioned by the rating to understand how far things will actually go.

I was hoping the dvd/blueray would have the additional material put back in to see if the film plays out any better, but if the run time is accurate on this listing that doesn't appear so. I think ultimately, the concept wasn't bad and was even an admirable attempt, the special effects and fight scenes are spectacular and worth a look. I just found myself not caring about any of the characters and just wishing the movie was over about 25 minutes in so I could do something more constructive with my afternoon.",1308096000,4,3014,4.48087431693989

  Visually the movie is stunning. It really is a live action anime. If you like comic books and anime then you might find Sucker Punch entertaining and the effects are well done.

4358078,5,B004EPYZU8,"""Sucker Punch"" is most likely going to be the most misunderstood film we'll see this entire year.  And sadly enough, I can't completely discuss the film without revealing some HUGE spoilers.  What I can say without any danger is that this movie works on at least three different levels... and the film absolutely lives up to its title.

At its most eye-popping level, the film is a fantastic action-adventure with an all-woman team of warriors.  Just on this level alone, the film's action sequences are breathtakingly stunning.  These sequences are original, flashy, silky smooth and carry a scope that boggles the mind.  I mean, where else can you see a movie that combines strong, sexy women, martial arts, shoot-em-ups, zombies, golems, Nazis, orcs, killer robots, airplanes, helicopters, mecha and DRAGONS?  Seriously.  It's all in there.  Just from the action included, the movie is off the charts.

But the action is only one layer of the film, and people who are watching the movie expecting this non-stop get to be the first winners of the titular sucker punch.  It's not an action movie at all, although all of the action I've talked about it is absolutely in the film.  It's just a part of the larger story, which is much more gripping and emotional by being put in contrast to the elegant fighting sequences.  At this level, ""Sucker Punch"" is a story about abuse and banding together to survive a brutal, horrific reality.  It gets uncomfortable at times, even, seeing what the characters have to cope with, but that makes the moments when they can be mentally and fantastically free so much more transcendent and poignant.  It truly works.  For anyone who has ever had to deal with abuse, be it sexual, physical, emotional or otherwise, this film sends a powerful message about the struggle to keep a part of yourself free and untainted from the cruelty of others at any cost.

And then there's the third level of the movie, but I'm not discussing that in detail in a public review, because it is best appreciated without any preexisting bias or foreknowledge.  This deepest level requires some serious thinking, but it's very much worth it.  If you knew, I mean absolutely KNEW, that you were doomed beyond a shadow of a doubt, how far would you go to save someone you loved?  THAT is what this movie makes you think about, in the end.  And any movie that makes me think and makes me feel is a movie worth seeing.

One last comment about the dress (or relative lack of it) the main characters seem to find themselves in throughout the film, if you don't mind.  As a woman, when I let myself fantasize about things, you'd best believe that I'm sexy and showing it off in most of my fantasies.  That's true for most women, if we take the time to think about it and have the courage to admit it.  So I'm not bothered in the least by the sexy outfits our girls wear in their fantasy sequences.  In the real world sequences, the skimpy attire has entirely the opposite effect, which I believe was quite purposely done; instead of being powerful and sexy like in the fantasy world, the revealing attire is both shameful and degrading to the characters, reinforcing the ugliness of their situation on that level.  The effect on the viewer is extremely dichotomous, and it's done in such a masterful way that it reinforces how brilliant a director Snyder really is.  Again, we get sucker punched, and it makes watching this movie unlikely anything else you'll see for a long time.

Watch ""Sucker Punch"" with an open, questioning mind, and it'll reward you with a unique, revealing experience.  Go into it with expectations of a bikini-clad assassin team with T&A everywhere and you'll be sorely disappointed.  But by all means, see it.",1307836800,17,3741,4.726851851851852
4358079,2,B004EPYZU8,"When I see a good movie it usually entails characters that are developed or developing, high detail in story and portrayal, and uniqueness from the mainstream archetype.  This movie fulfilled the bonus points for initial interest, but lacked detail and coherency for plot.  There were too many holes in the story that seemed like things were rushed and filled in with a gleaming overabundance of ""the bigger the better"" mentality.

A decent movie if you're not interested in thinking at all while your eyes are fixed on the screen.  There's a tremendous amount of eye-candy (not specifically speaking of the scantily covered ladies).  However, a horrible movie if you need more substance to feel a longing for more or rewardedness for plopping your butt down for the duration.",1307750400,4,776,5.03125
4358080,3,B004EPYZU8,"All of the elements were there: originality, metaphors, a talented cast, a great soundtrack and the crucial statements of self-sacrifice, the ability to create our own stories, abusive authority, reality versus our dreams, and the power of feminism. Somehow, even with so much material, Zack Snyder failed to deliver any of these concepts very strongly in Sucker Punch.
When Babydoll (Emily Browning) gets sent to a mental asylum by her wicked step-father after her mother's death, she has five days to escape the impending lobotomy that has been scheduled for her under his command. As Babydoll retreats into her imagination where reality blurs with fantasy, she becomes a dancer at a brothel along with four other patients that have been wrongly imprisoned. Babydoll teams up with Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jenna Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung) in order to escape their captors. To escape the girls need to collect five items, and each time Babydoll dances, they are given the chance to get the next item as they are thrown into yet another reality.
The plot has many clear holes that are difficult to ignore: the audience never actually gets to see Babydoll's hypnotic dance, and the majority of the characters were removed in a rather rushed, uncreative way. Most criticism that the film has faced is along the lines of the power of women in an abusive environment, and it is easy to see how women with machine guns and short skirts twirling around can be seen as more objectifying then empowering.
 Throughout the layers of realities one might mistake this film for Inception, however everything is so plainly spelt out that it lacks pretty much any intellectual concepts that one might hope to get from a reality bending movie. The movie would have been more enjoyable for me if it was just about the five girls in the asylum, because all the rawness that would be there has been covered up and polished by the fantasy worlds.
 The most prevailing idea was presented at the end of the movie, are we living our own life or are we just a supporting character for someone else's? Sucker Punch dares us to live life for ourselves and to make the story we live, our own.",1307577600,4,2208,4.823218997361478

'Sucker Punch' is a perfect example of a good concept that was ALL show and an ambiguous lack luster storyline.  It tried the ""dream within a dream"" motif that worked so well for 'Inception' and instead of drawing audiences into it's fantasy world, it fell FLAT.  The storyline was mediocre at best and tried to wow audiences with it's photoshop filters, special effects, & soundtrack.  I felt like I was trapped inside a psychedelic video game the entire movie and was wondering what drugs Zack was on when he wrote this movie.  And the Yoda like message at the end was laughable at best after viewing that mess.  The message I took was, ""There is freedom in your own delusions.""

This was one of the most nonsensical movies I have ever seen! Not that the plot was terrible, no. The plot was fair. Super hot troubled girl with difficult past makes a mistake that lands her amongst more super hot troubled girls who instantly dislike & distrust one another but eventually ban together to face a difficult escape from some horrible backdrop. I's been done to death! Albeit never so beautifully. It's the execution that is the total WTF element to this film.
The action sequences have so little to do with the rest of the film that I am still to this day unsure of what it was I was looking at. If you have not seen this film I promise you it is NOT what you think it is! It is more akin to a Pan's Labyrinth but without the brilliance. And yes there are Matrix elements shamelessly strewn about which sort of make up for the lack of sense in the story/action sequence tie in. My advice?

The music plays a constant role in setting mood and is louder than in many story based movies. The special effects and camera shoots are spectacular and if nothing more are worth seeing the movie for them alone. There is a necessity on the veiwers part to stop veiwing it as a movie and start thinking of it as more of chaotic dark dream. So if you are unimaginative, not a fan of blending cgi into reality or just do not like dark movies, this is not a film for you. I personally loved it. I think it is the future of film (at least part of the future) the special effects come effortlessly and look realistic. This is quite simply put a movie that would have been impossible to make 20 years ago. Even if someone one could have wrote the screenplay. Also I really enjoyed the writing (both in dialogue and plot progression) I will be fair and admit there are moments that felt slightly rushed and there was a time or two the writing did not hold its own.

I'm also a fan of cotton candy and other things that are pretty and fun and mostly empty.  But even cotton candy can be chewed, and even mindless entertainment is still supposed to be entertaining.

4358343,5,B004EPYZU8,"The critical response to Sucker Punch depressed me.  They just SAVAGED this movie, as if they had all received instructions to ""kill this film.""  You see, I loved this movie so much when I saw it that I couldn't believe that the reviews were real.  I had this bizarre feeling that I was dreaming.

Which brings up an interesting point, considering that this movie is a dream.

Sucker punch is not a realistic film.  It's not supposed to be.  It's a dream-scape.  The characters are dream characters, in a dream that *somebody* is dreaming--but who?  I could say that ""you"" are dreaming but that's not a precise use of language.  There is not some other person, some ""you,"" doing the dreaming.  I am the dreamer.  I am dreaming and the characters in Sucker Punch are dream characters in my dream.  There is no ""reality"" in the movie Sucker Punch (just as there is no reality in any movie).  But, in a way, there is MORE reality in Sucker Punch than the average film.  I'm dreaming it, after all, and within the context of the dream whatever I experience is as real as any other experience (or pain), just as long as I don't get hung up on the existence of ""others"" who really don't matter, anyway.

In some films, it is my job to feel sympathy for, and compassion towards, the characters in the movie.  That's my ""job"" as a member of the audience.  But in Sucker Punch I have a different job to do.  I shouldn't walk out of the theater with the impression that I saw a movie that tried to get me to care about the characters when it did no such thing.

The movies, in general, are dream-like. Sucker Punch takes that idea and runs with it.  As I watch the film, I am dreaming.  I am a person called ""Baby Doll"" and I am fighting dragons and also living in multiple worlds where I win wars, perform some kind of exotic dance, get institutionalized and eventually lobotomized.  I rescue my friends and they rescue me.  There are villains and heroes.  I even have the ability to ""jump"" from one identity to another.  Not all of the dream is ""fun.""  Some parts are nightmarish.

And then I wake up.  The lights come up in the theater.  I leave the cocoon and step outside.  Now I have to ask myself if I have learned anything from the dream.  The dream told me that I should have total victory.  Total and complete.  So do I?  I do if I ""control this world.""  If the world I inhabit is another dream, then what happens to me in it is a product of my mind.  I will experience in this world what I expect to experience.  No more and no less.

So what do I expect?  If I expect to be afraid and be defeated, then I will be.  But if I expect to be unafraid and undefeated, I will be.  I have all the weapons I need.  Now it's up to me to fight.  The film may (or may not) ""bleed"" into my ""real life"" in the way that some dreams do.  That's a pretty impressive piece of film-making, in my opinion, and Zack Snyder should be congratulated for it.

The above interpretation of this film is not a conventional one.  I know this.  But I don't know why it can't be a valid one and leave anyone who sees this movie with the choice to accept that this film is a step further along the evolution of film from ""story telling"" through ""thrill ride"" to ""guided dream"" to ""lucid dream.""  Sucker Punch is a guided dream intended to unfold in my mind.  It is different from a ""story-telling film"" but it is not a lucid dream experience, but it is a step in that direction.  At some point in the future, movies will be ""interactive"" and the video game and movie will be one and the same--providing us with the opportunity to experience a lucid dream while fully awake, and take one more step towards the experience of an alternative, virtual reality.

The objection to the idea of ""movies as guided dreaming"" is that, after all, we are accustomed to seeing a film as a story.  We peek into another person's life and, as voyeurs, we enjoy watching them.  Disbelief is suspended and we are tricked through the magic of film into believing that we are seeing ""real people"" and so we have an emotional response to them and their story--but this is not what Sucker Punch is.  Sucker Punch is not intended to ""make you think"" it is an experience that you have, not something you look at and interpret.  The only difficulty Zack Snyder had in putting this on screen is that the technology doesn't really exist (yet) to give the viewer the physical experience of the characters on screen.  When that does occur (and it will) then we'll have a true ""mind bending"" experience and we'll see where Sucker Punch has led us, for good or evil.

Sucker Punch is going to go down in history as a noble experiment that failed financially.  It will also be seen as the event that demonstrated (once again) that ""the critics"" can be very, very wrong.",1307059200,9,4805,4.3457207207207205

Sucker Punch is a movie that many have critically drubbed, to the point of labeling it varying degrees of schlock at best, and a video game movie at worst. What critics don't seem to realize about that last charge, of calling it a video game, is that the video gameish aspects of it are in fact a conscious and well wrought choice on the director's part. Sucker Punch is a movie about multiple layers of perception, of imagination, and of fantasy used to mask the very dark and sometimes inconceivable horrors that befall the powerless. This is a movie about the powerless finding power where they can in order to shape their own destinies. This is also a movie about making hard choices and doing what you need to in order to cope. These are nuances lost on a great many critics.

There are two, maybe even three levels of fantasy working at any given time of this movie. I say maybe three, because I'm not completely convinced that the asylum itself, with its own stylized version of a 1930s pulp story of institutionalization doesn't also constitute some fantastic version of an actual reality. The three layers we're privy to in the movie are the institution, which sandwiches or frames the narrative, the brothel/dancehall, and the video gamey action sequences. Each layer of fantasy is one more layer of protection for the main characters of the story, a layer of lies they tell to get themselves through the rather raw and painful reality of their lives. Had the director peeled those layers back completely, one would of have seen exploitation of the powerless at its most absolutely visceral.

So how do these layers work? The institutional layer is the closest to an objective reality. This is merely a funhouse reflection of the world in which these girls find themselves. In this world Baby Doll was almost attacked by her evil step father, and her sister killed before an attack could occur. I wonder if closer viewings might not support a reading of crisis not averted. In this world Rocket was merely thrown into the institution, and her sister followed. Rocket's style and dress, even her haircut and instant crush on Baby Doll suggests she was institutionalized for her unspoken but present sexuality. Again, these things are merely a superficial spackling that vaguely romanticize the institution.

The second layer is the combination brothel/dancehall where the girls are trained in the art of dance, where dance is as thinly veiled a metaphor for sex as one can possibly get without a pole and a feather boa. This layer, more than the first, shows signs of conforming to the girls' perspective of the world. In this version of the world, the orderly is the boss and has all the power, whereas the kind and compassionate doctor of the institution is more Madame/mother figure who finds herself subordinate to the boss, mostly by dint of her gender. As we discover near the end of this movie, the power dynamics between the boss/madame actually belie the real dynamics between the orderly/doctor, when the doctor asserts authority over the orderly that the madame never has. This act, which would have been a usurpation of power in the brothel world, suggests that the power dynamics are, as previously stated, based solely on the girls' read of the situation.

The third layer is the most problematical for critics and the one that makes most sense after an objective review. Again, I call this the video game layer. This is the layer that the girls retreat to when they engage in ""the dance."" In this layer girls have complete power over their environments. They are superheroes, batted around, beaten and bruised, but for the most part (and until fantasies start to bleed into each other) indestructible. There is a reason video games are a popular form of entertainment: they give power to the otherwise powerless. It doesn't matter how strong you are, quick you are, intelligent you are in real life; video games are the great equalizer capable of turning even the weakest among us into gods among men, or goddess among women in this case. This is a world where the girls all have power over their environments, where their skills, and their talents, and their ability to work together allows them to succeed. Also consider that the villains of these pieces, clockwork Germans, mechanical soldiers, knights and trolls, are all generic fantasy creations, cartoonish in their simplicity. Again the girls turn them into monsters they can reasonably defeat because their only hope of defeating the monsters in the other layers is through surrender.

That's why the fantasy needs to be there. These girls exist in a world where their skills are dismissed and where their talents are graded on their curves. Bob Chipman of The Escapist said that ""This is a movie that invites the so-called male gaze, and then spits in its face."" These girls exist in a world where exploitation is the norm, so they quite logically retreat to worlds where they can transcend that exploitation.

This whole thing brings me to how these layers interact. Each layer is a buffer of protection against the very harsh realities these girls, Baby Doll specifically, have to face. The video game layer is their attempt to find empowerment to justify their having to debase themselves to get what they need to survive. In the other layers, the only talents that will allow them to succeed are their abilities to dance (brothel world), seduce (institution world), or submit to sexual exploitation (unseen reality). The fact that so many layers of fantasy are required to make these acts even remotely palatable goes a long way toward suggesting just how much these girls must go through to win out in the end. As Scott Mendelson says in his review on the Huffington Post ""'""Zach[sic] Snyder just made While he raped me, I closed my eyes and imagined myself somewhere else: The Movie.'"" It's an apt epithet for a disturbing movie.

Unfortunately, few get past the sexy girls kicking monster butt. Closer examination drains the titillation out of the movie, when you realize that it's dealing with very real, very vile exploitation. While not a perfect movie -- I would go so far as to call Sucker Punch a beautiful mess -- it is definitely a movie that fills the screen with flash and dazzle, but it's flash and dazzle that begs to be scratched, begs to be dissected, begs to expose the very real and very twisted underbelly, the reality we never see, the reality that is only hinted at, and is only made the more disturbing by its absence.",1306886400,6,6709,4.817708333333333
4358346,4,B004EPYZU8,"I anxiously awaited the release of this movie after seeing the first trailer. ""What's it about?"" I pondered with my co-workers, musing on possible plot theories. (Working in a restaurant kitchen leaves you lots of time to ponder lifes mysteries)
Overall, I think Zack Snyder is pretty damn good at making movies. His visuals are always striking, and the action sequences are always unbelievable. I loved ""300"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000QXDED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (Widescreen Edition)</a>), and the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead-Unrated-Director-s-Cut-Blu-ray/dp/B001CW7ZW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead (Unrated Director's Cut) [Blu-ray</a>])is one of my favorites. His adaptation of ""Watchmen"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen-The-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001QTXM5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>)was very good, although lacking in the ""psionic squid"" department.( If you've read the graphic novel, you get it...if not, READ IT!!) Needless to say, the lead up to ""Sucker Punch"" had me shivering with anticipation.

Well, the time came to see it, and much to my surprise despite the crappy reviews hurled forth at it, I really really liked it.
Granted it's no ""Gone With the Wind"" or anything like that, so don't go into it expecting an Oscar caliber film. That said, watching some really hot girls run around with guns, swords, and tactical tomahawks does something to you. Something nice. Very nice. Best thing to do...shut off your brain, don't think too much into the plot, and enjoy the scenery.

Quick synopsis...""Babydoll"" gets locked in a mental institution, and needs to find a way to get out before she's lobotomized. She fantasizes that she is actually being held against her will in a brothel and must dance to please her clients. Every time she dances, she goes to another fantasy world to obtain an item to effect her escape.

It's certainly no ""Inception"", though dreams and fantasies are what it's all about. You see, when ""Babydoll"" dances, we are taken to one of her escapist fantasies, along with her co-""dancers"" Amber, Blondie, Sweet Pea, and Rocket. There's been lots of discussion about what each dream ""level"" means or alludes to. I have my theories (as does everyone else) ,so if you feel the need to further analyze those sequences, knock yourself out.

I won't go into hard detail of the movie itself, as many have done before, but if you like fantastic visuals,ridiculous action, blinding violence, dragons, hot girls, zombie stormtroopers, giant samurai with miniguns,B-25 bombers, and mech-suits with pink bunny faces painted on them, then this movie is definitely for you.",1306713600,4,2912,6.026570048309178
4358347,5,B004EPYZU8,"Okay, now you know how I feel about it so let me attempt to review. Sucker Punch is the first movie I've gone to see twice at the theater in decades. I would make it three times if it was still around since there's noting else I want to see this weekend. I realize that most critics are trashing it and apparently a lot of viewers are disappointed. I will ramble a bit but try to eventually address those reactions.

First of all, critics had their own preconceived ideas of the movie they wanted to see and they didn't get it. They persist among other things in believing it is wrong that perfectly normal people admit ambivalence fascinations concerning sex and violence directed towards women. They also believe that too much action, music and camera work mean a movie can't have any real emotional impact. Oddly at the same time these folks complain that Sucker Punch is a downer. Can it have no emotional impact and be a downer at the same time? Some have said that the movie is a mishmash mess. Some have said it feels too much like a video game. They are all wrong. They don't ""get"" it.

The movie fits together like clockwork. Every little thing is important. It all comes full circle. All but the first ten or fifteen and last five minutes are not real. (Guestimated times) The first section depicts the traumatic event that has created the mentally disturbed Baby Doll character. I think some critics are forgetting that she may actually belong in the institution. As a result the jarring music and camera work makes sense for the first section to depict her trauma and then the rest of the movie is not supposed to be real. It is a depiction of multiple levels of the world created in Baby Doll's mind to deal with her situation. I think it works perfectly in that regard. Do girls dressed as schoolgirls or dancers in wild fight scenarios look like a video game. No doubt. There's a reason. Baby Doll has imagined them as kept girls in a dance hall setting, but the dancing is a euphemism for sex. So when she jumps to the other level to escape that horror of the institution she leaves them in that costume in her mind. Clues in the opening section and dialogue in the last section explain how all the action scenes are euphemisms for the struggles to do the things that transpired in ""reality.""

I think some viewers were disappointed that the climax wasn't a huge winning-battle fist-pump moment, but by the time the movie gets there the conclusion made perfect sense to me. Sure, part of me wants to see everyone escape and triumph and get revenge and all that. But that would be the same sort of empty lame action movie conclusion that critics generally pan. Not that I'm not a ""sucker"" for those sorts of endings myself, but this movie takes another approach to identifying what triumph is.

I've chatted with a couple of folks who didn't like the movie as much as I did and here's the thing. I believe Jack Snyder made the movie he wanted to make, something which movie makers don't get to do all that often. He's a geekdom enthusiast. His style is live-action comic book style. He made 300 and Watchmen for heavens sakes! What did the critics and people expect? Sucker Punch is a powerful movie with depth but comic book sensibilities as to pacing and visuals. Some of us like that! I personally don't need a lot of touchy feely meandering around to get to know the character stuff. As a comic reader a couple of frames that hit the nail on the head to explain the character are enough for me. It would ruin this movie to meander around getting charactery since the whole thing functions as a modern allegory or fairytale. Snyder keeps things moving like a good comic at all times. There is no rest for the viewer.

I think everyone, even the critics, agree that the visuals are stunning. I would point out that the girls are as well. And they all do an excellent job. I often roll my eyes at actresses in these sorts of action sequences, but never did here. Not that they're accomplished martial artists or anything like that, but Snyder understands how to make the action look good. On the flip side they are all excellent actresses which means they deliver the dramatic moments quite well.

Obviously I loved this movie. Easily movie of the year, perhaps the decade. Snyder took chances and made an original movie. I can certainly see why some folks don't like it. Perhaps they wanted a rah rah victorious ending and didn't get it. More likely they don't have comicbook sensibilities. But for anyone to claim Sucker Punch is not an amazing work is to fail to see how well crafted it is.

I got considerably more than that. It took me two viewings, in fact, to formulate a full opinion of this movie, which is something I don't often get in my brainless action blockbusters. The film exists in three different layers of reality, two of them nestled within the mind of Babydoll (Emily Browning). The relationship between those and the ""true"" reality are not always so clearly defined, and the viewer is left to piece together certain connections on their own.

Snyder is also making a commentary here about voyeurism and the objectification of women. Predictably, this has angered a lot of men who came in only looking to get their rocks off at the sight of young women tarted up in fishnets and sailor fuku.

There's much more I could get into, but not without spoiling the whole thing, and Sucker Punch is the kind of movie where word of mouth doesn't suffice: you have to see it yourself and draw your own conclusions.",1306281600,7,1231,4.637614678899083

4358455,4,B004EPYZU8,"Zack Snyder is very passionate about geek culture. That's very obvious from his cinematic body of work, (Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen). Sucker Punch, Snyder's fifth effort as director - he also helmed the 2010 animated film Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole - is a film that oozes that very passion. It contains everything that fanboys crave and is likely to have limited appeal outside of the ComicCon set. Sucker Punch tells the story of ""Babydoll"", a young girl who is consigned to a mental hospital against her will by her stepfather. While there, she re-imagines the institution as a cabaret dance club and conspires to escape with several other girls. Their attempts at escape become outlandish fantasy-action sequences in which Babydoll and the other girls are gun and sword wielding heroines.

Sucker Punch is like a dream that a geek would have after a lengthy binge on video games, comic books and anime. It is a fantastical melange of action, science fiction and fantasy elements. You get the feeling that Snyder wrote the story by hanging out with friends and throwing out ideas. ""Wouldn't it be cool if she fought a 15-foot samurai with a machine gun??"" Pretty much any far-out idea that comes into Snyder's head turns up in the flick. Through the course of Sucker Punch's 110 minutes the audience bears witness to (in addition to the aforementioned fifteen-foot samurai) mechanical German soldiers and WWII dirigibles, a fire-breathing dragon and robots programmed with sick martial arts skills. Some of these ideas feel half-baked and, indeed, I did have that feeling about the movie as a whole; that Sucker Punch was a series of very cool scenes in search of a coherent story. The framing ""real world"" story of a girl in a mental hospital couldn't possibly compete with robots and giant samurai. The film does tend to bog down a bit in the dramatic scenes of the girls, Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung chit-chatting and discussing their plans.

The movie is very well made. Visually, it's absolutely incredible. I literally cannot wait to pop in the Sucker Punch blu-ray and see this baby in 1080p. It has a video game look and feel which I'm sure where intended by Snyder. The colors are desaturated and the flesh tones tend to look very computer generated. Emily Browning's Babydoll in particular looks like she has just hopped out of a Final Fantasy game. The action sequences are amazing to look act and lots of fun, if a little too chaotic. Snyder's love for slow-motion fight scenes is once again on display here. Acting is about what you would expect for an action-fantasy film. Emily Browning, the human star of the movie, speaks very little and wears the same expression on her face as if she's about to burst into tears for the entire movie. Carla Gugino does some nice work as the madam/dance instructor/whatever and Oscar Isaac is an appropriately slimy villain.

I do get the sense that there is more here than meets the eye. I do not think that Zack Snyder merely intended this film to be an empty excuse for cool action scenes, but on a single viewing any profound messages or themes eluded me. I'm not sure what to make about the opening and closing  gobbledygook voice-over about angels. However, I will be seeing Sucker Punch again and I will pay closer attention to the subtleties of this story in hopes to grasp any such profundity. Despite some misgivings, I had a good time with Sucker Punch and look forward to a second viewing. Warner Bros will be releasing an extended cut on blu-ray which I will view and possibly amend this review accordingly. Clearly this movie is not for everybody. Critical reviews have been understandably very mixed. As I said earlier, the movie is not likely to find an audience outside of the comics and video game crowd. Zack Snyder is trying hard to do something bold and outside the box and I give him much credit for that. Sucker Punch may not totally succeed as a movie, but at least it tries!

4358459,5,B004EPYZU8,"Long review short, I fell in love as soon as the first dirigble graced the screen. More on that later.

It's weird to see that the editorial review did focus a lot on the women's looks rather than the plot (of which there were layers of). I do apologize in advance if this seems to be one of those ""Nuh-uh, you're wrong and here's why"" reviews. Two people can see the same movie two different ways, for example, Ron Howard can see the Dilemma as a comedy while all I saw was a sad tale of people's lives falling apart.

As I said before, the movie is layered. The first layer, Reality, falls away pretty quickly and without warning. The other two layers, The Imagined Brothel and Fantasy, switch back and forth throughout most of the movie. As only a small part of the movie takes place in harsh, naked reality, it must be forgiven if the physics are a little off.

The Imagined Brothel is either the result of a mind trying to escape the true horrors of it's situation (the mental hospital was simply too terrible to process, a distinct possibility), the side effect of a drug (a ""treatment"" or a way to make it seem as though she was actually crazy), a combination of the first two, or perhaps she was actually mentally ill (schizophrenia is a condition in which the bounds between reality and fantasy are broken down, which is where the brothel layer is.) Interestingly, schizophrenia can be mistaken for a bad trip. Perhaps the more well-meaning staff had tried to medicate her, and the side effect was this very hallucination? It would explain why the brothel events have echoes in reality. We have no way of knowing if those other girls were aware that they were being depicted in Babydoll's mind as anything but the way they really looked and where they really were.

The Fantasy layer is what you saw on the previews. Epic, awesome, full of everything from clockwork zombies to robots to orcs. In this layer, the girls had real power. I think this layer is also where the movie becomes a chick flick. Instead of watching the girls forced into dancing in the brothel, they move into a realm where they can do something. The task is related to the task in both other layers, but more done up. This realm is the most mentally based, so things do get a little weird. There's also beautiful music and the bonds of sisterhood deepening as the girls slaughter their inner demons.

So, to me, the story wasn't about hotties slicing things up as many many professional critics seem to think (and the last few seconds seem to back me up there). What I think we're witnessing here, between the poor professional reviews, the seemingly short run (in my local theater anyway), and the large number of people who stayed through the whole movie and loved it, is the birth of a cult hit.",1304208000,14,2779,4.527888446215139

Sweet Pea's breaking the fourth dimension (barrier?) near the beginning of the movie is clever, as well as various one liners provided by Scott Glen's character (many of which you've heard before, but all worth hearing again). The story itself is somewhat dark, but not pessimistic. I waited until it arrived at the discount theater because I was worried it would be more dark and pessimistic than it turned out to be. It's more akin to 'Life is Beautiful' in my opinion than to 'Sin City'.

Snyder's imagination in my opinion is right up there with Guillermo del Toro although Snyder's imagery is more tied to pop culture, whether it's samurai and chinese temples, mechs ala robotech, steam-punkish nazis, orcs and dragons, or futuristic robot soldiers. Throw into that mix some sharp costumes, the spinning camera from 'The Matrix', and you have a movie that if nothing else is good to look at and entertaining to watch. It's worth at least a rental, and if you're a fan of Snyder's other movies, it's worth a purchase when they decide to release this on dvd and bluray.",1303689600,,1362,4.651452282157677
4358572,5,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch is a grand slam, 5-star, diamond studded allegorical tale of the triumph of the human spirit over the dark forces of misogyny, malevolence and grindingly wicked evil. Come-on, we've all encountered these ""gutter rat characters,"" in real life, albeit for most of us in lesser form. Don't you want to see the pimp, schoolyard bully, morally corrupt politician, obnoxiously controlling boss, or rapaciously greedy Wall Street Financier get obliterated? Sure you do! These and other societal miscreants imprison, manipulate and control for their own selfish purposes. And, I'm sure you can conjure up other communal deviants; they are all represented in this movie by the step-father and certain staff members at the insane asylum who are then cast in the metaphoric form of the zombie storm troopers, orcs and mindless robots in Babydoll's dreams where she and her companions destroy them: Domina  Victoria!  And here Babydoll, empowered by her dreams (remember, dreams are all that she has - she's locked up in an insane asylum awaiting a lobotomy) finds her true inner strength and saves herself and her other companions,  if only in self- redemption, while Sweat Pea is literally saved. Good triumphs over evil while Love triumphs over lechery, avarice and the objectification of the powerless female, or any human being enslaved by undeserved, ill-fated circumstances. In this movie, the innocent victims empower themselves and ultimately triumph -- a noble theme in a mostly ignoble world today. It is truly inspiring, especially if you've ever been figuratively ""sucker-punched"". Assuming we all have (been sucker-punched) this movie becomes universally relevant. And, the music fits like a cashmere glove on this unfolding allegorical tale as it completely envelopes and immerses  you into the story. Haven't you ever fallen into a metaphorical rabbit hole ... like Alice in Wonderland or, as in the movie, Babydoll entering the insane asylum? Been in a place where all is not apparent and much is hidden?  Been the victim of, for example, a destructive and manipulating malignant narcissist?  Well, in this movie they are all destroyed. Vaporized! Finally, simpler, better lines could not have been written for a movie ... they are captivating, especially those at the end and also from the character played by Scott Glenn. The director skillfully unfolds this well written and produced allegorical masterpiece through the rhetorical device of metaphor and in doing so achieves a work of Genius!  Go ""through the looking glass"" again. See it a 2nd time with some intellectual flare, fired-up imagination and eyes wide open.",1303344000,6,2641,5.273809523809524

The soundtrack is awesome and works great with the action. The only dissapointment but only slight was the ending it's not what you'd expect. Zack Snyder is getting better each movie.

That having been said, Sucker Punch is his most underrated film to date.  I'm not going to bother going over the plot and storyline because that's not what a review is for.  As usual, the critics are bashing this film to no end because of their usual reasons... ""no plot and no characterization"".  Don't even get me started on critics...  I am a former film major, so I think I know a little about what I'm talking about.  Anyways,  I don't know what movie they were watching, but the movie I saw definitely had a story, it was a little confusing at first, but all you have to do is pay attention and you will fully understand it in no time.  If characters can elicit emotions, then there is characterization, and I did get emotional during the movie.  The five main ladies definitely did a good job with their characters, especially Emily Browning.  She has some talent to spare in my opinion.  In conclusion, if you go into this movie with an open mind, I think you will have a great time.  From one movie person to another, PLEASE do not listen to the critics.

4358575,4,B004EPYZU8,"Not much of a story, but fun to watch, nonetheless:

This film possesses the elements I generally look for in a film.  Gorgeous girls, and in this case, hot young girls dressed in scantily clad fighting gear and even just tangible scraps of clothing that could pass for military uniforms.  They did quite well at keeping it all ""sexy-looking.""  And I like cool, dark world visuals.  So, babes and dark dystopian landscapes are two strong elements I seek in a film.  Sometimes, I really don't care if there is little to no real story.  This film is basically ALL about eye-candy!

After I've watched this, I try to look at this film as how the original concept was perceived.  I have to think that somebody who's really creative at fabricating graphic, very detailed, dark worlds and over-the-top fighting scenes in these fantasy worlds, had concocted a few pre-conceived five minute visuals designed by computer graphics (of course) and then they had to figure out how to write a story to put these various unrelated fantasy scenes together to make a movie somehow.

As a story, this was really lame.  Very empty.  Directionless. This could not possibly be an interesting book, even if they included a few pictures.  So, that alone, should tell you that there is no real story here.  Just great artwork brought to life.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  I like films that have cool visuals, and this film has many.

Parents should have no problem allowing their children (even as young as 10) to watch this film.  There are no real bloody scenes, and no fowl language.  I respect the makers of this film for making this film a treat for a family audience of all ages.

I noticed in the movie trailer that they used Led Zeppelin's ""When the Levee Breaks"" as background music.  Perhaps that was to attract an older audience.  Well, that did capture my interest, for sure.  But, in the movie, they used Bjork's ""Army of Me"" which has a similar rhythm and beat.  But, that song is cool too.

Yeah, I'll get the Blu-Ray when this film comes available for release.  It makes for a great background movie to have on, whether I choose to actually sit down and watch it, or not.

If you like ""babefest"" films with girls fighting, check out ""D.O.A. Dead or Alive"", and ""B!tch Slap.""  Other good ""babefest"" films are ""D.E.B.S."", ""Chasing Papi"", ""Man of the House"", ""Bride and Prejudice"" (the semi-Bollywood version with Aishwarya Rai and Namrata Shiradkar), ""Cloud 9"", ""So Close"" and even the Japanese Criterion Collection masterpiece of Seijun Suzuki's ""Gate of Flesh.""

I don't buy a lot of new movies these days.  Hardly any. Semi-stimulating stories are diminishing.  Dramas are directed more towards the female audience anymore, so all that's left for me to enjoy in any new film is if it looks cool on the screen, and if it is not too offensive.  I don't need blood, guts, and gore to be entertained.  And today's idea of comedy, is just too stupid.  Comedies today try too hard to be funny and so it fails to be, to me.  The situation comedy of film seems to have faded away, these days.  Making parodies of past films seems to be the goal of today's comedies, and it all just stinks.

But, with all that said, this quirky film, with the girls, and the graphic detailed artwork, apparently works for me.  It was a good time for me at the theatre when I went with my girl.  Well worth the five bucks!",1302566400,2,3401,4.614357262103506
4358576,3,B004EPYZU8,"After her mother and sister die, our protagonist known only as `Babydoll' (played by Emily Browning) is put in a mental asylum by her evil stepfather and is due to receive a lobotomy in 5 days. So she has 5 days to escape the asylum. Whilst inside she makes 4 friends - Amber (played by Jamie Chung), Blondie (played by Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (played by Jena Malone) and Sweet Pea (played by Abbie Cornish) - and with these 4 other girls concocts a plan to escape the asylum: they have to get hold of 5 objects - a map, fire, a knife, a key and a fifth, unrevealed item requiring great sacrifice - which will grant them their freedom. The plan to obtain these objects revolves around Babydoll doing a special erotic dance for Blue Jones (the director of the asylum, played by Oscar Isaac), distracting him whilst the other 4 girls retrieve the objects. We find that each time Babydoll does her erotic dances (which she presumably hates) she escapes into her imagination and we are transported to spectacular fantasy worlds where Babydoll and her 4 friends - guided by the mentor known only as The Wise Man - battle fearsome foes including fire-breathing dragons, demon samurai, advanced cyborgs and steampunk Nazis in World War II; questing in these fantasy worlds to retrieve the items they need to escape from the asylum in real life. And it is the fantasy parts of the film, with its superior CGI and kicking soundtrack that really make the film: these parts of the film where Babydoll escapes into a fantasy world in her own imagination are insane and brilliantly done with wonderful fighting moves from our 5 kick-ass babes and brilliant CGI and prevent this from being a boring movie. But will the girls' plan to escape the asylum succeed? You'll have to see the movie. Is the movie any good? I immensely enjoyed the fantasy sequences but the movie just didn't feel strung together as a coherent whole. Without the fantasy sequences the film falls apart and because it doesn't feel like a whole just isn't interesting enough. Blue Jones' character (the man who runs the asylum) is a nasty piece of work and because of him certain people die who shouldn't. We never see the supposedly amazing erotic dances that Babydoll does, presumably so that this film could get its 12 rating, seeming to imply that the subtext of this film was about the exploitation of women and the fight for freedom from exploitation. I'm not sure why the girls have the nicknames that they do, except perhaps to make the movie seem cool. And the fantasy sequences are cool but by the end of the film I felt as if I had eaten a meal that hadn't managed to satisfy my hunger. And the way events eventually play out in this movie is a cop out: what exactly was Zack Snyder (the film's director) trying to say? And why doesn't the main protagonist Babydoll talk for the first 10 or so minutes of the film? At first I thought she was mute! In the final analysis this film will be remembered for its fantasy sequences (clips from which make up the trailer). But these are not enough to make the film a coherent whole. Ultimately disappointing.",1302566400,4,3119,4.6014362657091565
4358577,3,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch was NOT AT ALL what I expected, and the story line just wasn't there.  Sorry, but it was WEIRD.
The CGI was FANTASTIC, a definite 5 plus.  The music was pretty hip.  It was kickin' at another 5, assuming you like heavy-beat rock with some rap.  It made me feel like dancing myself!  The story was a ZERO -- nada, zilch, zippo.  Don't get me wrong though, I could easily watch it again for the CGI.

The movie begins with a young girl (age 18 or so?) and her sister (age 8?).  Their mother dies and they are left all the inheritance while their step-father gets nothing.  Boy, is he mad!  He comes after the oldest girl, obviously attempting to do her harm.  She escapes and comes back with a gun, too late to save her now dead sister.  With the blood on her hands from caressing her sister, she shoots the gun but does not kill daddy.  Daddy calls the authorities and says the girl did it.  Next thing you know, the girl is in the Lennox House for the criminally insane in Vermont.  (This all happens in the very beginning.) Daddy does some wheeling and dealing with an orderly there to make sure the girl never gets to talk about it, but the girl decides she is going to get out and enlists the help of others she is in there with.  (From here, most of us would probably expect certain things to happen and have already formulated the expected ending in our minds.--Guess what?  Nope!) From here, she goes off into several scenarios of fantasy fighting her inner demons with the help of her friends.  The scenarios are different and jump all around.

I don't want to tell you anymore about the plot.  I will admit that I stayed with the movie the whole time and was very interested, but I am fascinated by great CGI, so the CGI with the thumpin' heavy-beat music was enough for me.

In generalizing, I would say this is a movie mostly for the younger folks (age 18 - 38 or so, and 38 may be on the high side).  Most people 40 or over would probably give it a negative rating.  If you are on the fence about it, I suggest you rent it for a buck from the big red box before you buy it.",1302480000,3,2097,4.21356783919598

4358579,5,B004EPYZU8,"I initially had little interest in ""Sucker Punch.""  I had seen the preview but it was not compelling.  Yet the negative reviews were so many and so hateful, and the positive reviews were so few but equally passionate, I became curious, if worried.  I actually sat where I could make a quick getaway as soon as I could no longer take it.  This was a movie I was prepared to dislike.  Instead, I fell in love with it.

It all began with Ken Kelsey and his unhappiness over how the movie ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" turned out.  I greatly admired Kesey's the book and was excited about the prospect of a movie.  Unfortunately, the producers took the easy way out.  Instead of doing it from the POV of Chief Broom and his mental issues (paranoid schizophrenia, likely), including the hallucinatory and occasional unpleasant imagery, the decision was made to tell the story objectively, using Randall Patrick Mcmurphy as the central figure.  Telling it from the POV of Chief Broom must of smacked of trip movies and the like and nobody wanted to do that.  It sounded far too risky a box-office proposition.

I was left hoping that there were people here and there in Hollywood who wanted to do the story like the author intended.  That is, tell the story of a tragic rescuer from the POV of Chief Broom himself.

I have no idea whether any of these thoughts of achieving the vision of Kesey's novel ever coursed through the mind of writer/director Zack Snyder when he was writing ""Sucker Punch.""  From what I have read he mostly wanted to assemble something along the lines of a framing device that would enhance and give ironic detachment, or some such thing, to this  tale (tragic in its own right) of female empowerment.  The Battle Angels/Pretty Warriors so standard in Anime would have been a tempting symbolic choice.  Much of the story requires fantasy, this being a tale set in a mental institution.  The main character ""Baby Doll"" would of course use the wildest fantasies she could summon to sustain her.

It's all in the mind, after all, the ""threater"" of consciousness (or of war or of movies -- ""theater"" works in all three contexts).  Nevertheless, Snyder's choice of setting and show wouldn't work for most (surely test audiences would have reported their dissatisfaction).  In fact, as near as I can determine, about 1/6 of the potential audience hated even the idea of the movie.  But whatever his reasoning, once the decision was made he did not hold back.  [Not that he is the kind of guy to hold back in any event, as viewers of ""300"" and ""The Watchmen"" well know.]  It was a daring move.  The relentless imagery of male monsters dominating a prison/nightclub/brothel of helpless females could easily have succumbed to parody.  What fascinated me, as I watched the film, is how able Snyder was to keep it all under control and only tearing loose during the fantasy sequences.

But do the fantasies work?  They are the visual core of the movie and Baby Doll is not a paranoid schizophrenic.  Her fantasies would be nothing like those of Chief Broom.  The issue is not if the fantasy sequences should have been cut or  reduced in scope for enhance audience acceptance.  The issue is: do they work given the character of Baby Doll and her situation?

They do.  They are plausible.  Anyone caught unjustly in such a situation (young male or young female) would have violent fantasies of fighting back.  If not against the immediate obviously enemy, impossible in this instance, than any enemy that suits the psychological purposes of the terrified.  The more oppressive the external situation, the more extreme the internal response would be.  Having gone to the lengths to portray the girl's environment as horrible as he did, he must have felt equally compelled to show how under the leadership of Baby Doll that the girls would fight back against imaginary monsters every bit as intensely as real ones.  And from that ongoing fight draw strength to keep fighting.

Though female empowerment, violent or otherwise, is a fairly common theme in hollywood, Snyder cranks up the volume to a pitch that is almost unbearable (I mean that literally -- as an experiment I saw the film in one of the ""I-Max"" theaters and almost had to keep my fingers in my ears throughout).  But he succeeds thereby in keeping the girl-power theme and characters from becoming cliche.

The chosen psychological symbolism won me over completely, I went with it without regret.  In addition to the Anime stylization, beautifully done, the figure of the ""Wise Man"" is crucial.  He is the Jungian animus for Baby Doll (who is the Jungian anima for another of the captive girls, Sweet Pea).  The ""Wise Man"" (wonderfully played by Scott Glenn) centers the fantasy sequences.  His appearance at the end of the film also enables the perfect emotional release.

""Sucker Punch"" is a masterpiece and as such a demanding one.  While I understand most people who go to the movies expect to see ""really wide-screen TV."" This requires more attention.  So I  reserve by impatience for those critics who seemed unable to watch the film without being in a rush get back to the office to see that they say the same thing as their fellow critics (I lost track of how many times ""teen-age boys and masturbation"" were used as the ultimate put-down.  How droll.)  If that's your profession, it is not good enough.  Critics have a responsibility to go beyond what Ebert calls ""level-1"" criticisms when it is clear the writer-director is putting all that he has into it.

A lot more could be written about ""Sucker Punch"" and will be written.  For now, to the entire cast, pitch perfect, and this wonderful, sad tale that fully realizes at last Kesey's vision of freedom, psychological and existential -- magnificently done.",1302393600,3,5792,4.777442094662638
4358580,5,B004EPYZU8,"There are a lot of ways to describe this flick: surreal grindhouse, Gothic music video, video game movie, prison girl film, Heavy Metal meets LOTR etc. The movie for the most part was 5 stars. I didn't like the ending as they attempted to make a statement when none was needed. Baby Doll's mother dies. The step-dad was left out of the will so he kills Baby doll's sister and blames her during a goth version of ""Sweet Dreams"" (Annie Lennox). Baby Doll is committed to the Lennox asylum in Brattleboro, Vt. She is supposed to get a lobotomy in 5 days, during which she plans an escape.

The asylum has a stage where the girls perform. Baby Doll has a dance which mesmerizes people, a dance, we the audience never get to see. While Baby Doll dances she goes into a trance or dream world where she imagines she is battling all kinds of creatures (zombies, orcs etc). This is all done to a great soundtrack and computer graphics. In this aspect, the movie reminded me of ""Heavy Metal"", a series of stories loosely connected by a plot. This actually works well, unfortunately when the movie deviates from it, it doesn't work at all. During the first dance Baby Doll is told to get certain objects so she can escape. During her subsequent dances she entrances the males in the audience while her fellow inmates steal the item they need. The item they steal relates to the surreal imagination of Baby Doll.

No nudity, no sex, and the language was acceptable. Girls run around in short skirts with tight black hip boots. This is this generation's ""Heavy Metal"" movie, one that would be best watched on the big screen at a midnight showing.",1302307200,,1633,4.551020408163265

Yes, this has almost everything.

What doesn't it have? Subtlety, for one thing, starting with the Eurhythmics' Sweet Dreams (""... some of them want to abuse you ...""). Then there's coherence and reason to care. That leaves us with eye candy, fight scenes, and cool effects. Sometimes that's enough.

Doesn't quite fit. ALLURING? RAVISHING? ATTRACTING? STUNNING? GRAND? Maybe if we morphed all of these words, it would be just less than 1/1000th of the actual result: Suluvitrand... Yes - that's it!

Now, in all seriousness, this movie is probably the ONLY movie deserving of a suluvitrand grade. Just, close your eyes... well, no. Then you won't be able to see what I'm going to say next. Okay, close ONE eyes. NOT BOTH! One... and let that ONE eye shut you out of the critical world. The universe of wretched, black-hearted, unprofessional critics. That MAY have been a little too far, but come on! These critical critics have no idea what they're talking about! Listen for a second... I saw this movie yesterday and have thought of nothing else. Everything from the opening scene with a beautiful cover of ""Sweet Dreams"" and a montage of a family gracefully being torn apart (if that makes sense) to the final seconds of the ride. It's an adventure - all of your senses are pulled in here - the venturous visual effects are basically diamonds for your eyes; the superb soundtrack and sounds of the film are mind controlling and beauty for the ears; The fire and ice and pain and sorrow really grab you in a way that you can feel it. I suppose there really isn't too much to taste or smell unless you have popcorn and Pepsi on your lap, but everything else goes above and beyond and makes up for the hunger - not only for nachos with jalape&ntilde;os and cheese - but for more! Two hours (exactly 120 minutes, actually) is just NOT. ENOUGH.

I want more. I'm not a begger, and certainly I'm not saying this film wasn't capable of giving me enough, but I need more. The acting is fabulous, and I have to say that Baby Doll (the star; Emily Browning) and Blue (Oscar Isaac) are very convincing and really the best. They control the screen like it's a game of chess - the two playing a game against each other: level expert. I saw this with my friend, who usually likes calmer things (calmer music, calmer movies, blah blah blah - I really don't understand it) and even HE was falling for this movie. In some parts I saw him glued to the screen when I looked over. This didn't happen a lot though, because I was in love with it even more, and forgot I was watching a movie at some points (which, let me say, is like waking up from that dream where you're a billionaire and then realizing you need to buy the groceries).

Now, I'm sorry, truly, but I had to get that all out of my system. I SUPPOSE I will tell you what the movie's about now...

It's raining outside - hard. There's a symphony of lightning and thunder performing a scary opera outside, but Baby Doll, who's sitting on her bed crying, isn't afraid of storms. In the next room, her mom is lying in her bed, dead. Her evil stepfather smiles sinisterly as Baby Doll and her sister sob. Later, though, that smile disappears when he finds out his name is nowhere in his wife's will. He sips down his troubles and does away with Baby Doll's sister, blaming her for the murder. This ""crime"" of hers gets her sent to the asylum with plenty of other girls that have to perform masterful dances to survive. ""We're already dead."" says Rocket, one of the other leads, when Baby Doll plans an escape route. In a partially imaginary land, the girls must complete missions, which are just as dangerous, really, in their fantasy world as they are on Earth. This is the perfect risk that endangers them all by a man with a fully-loaded gun - Blue. Blue makes his money off of these girls, and if he can't have his money, the girls can't have their freedom. They need to escape now -- before payday...

With 3 viewings of this movie, I am convinced this is clearly one of the best movies produced in a very long time. Please disregard the so-called movie critics that are bashing this film.

4358698,5,B004EPYZU8,"I'm stepping outside the average on this one. SUCKER PUNCH got hammered by reviewers, basically called the worst movie this year. I went to see it anyways. Come on, chicks fighting clockwork Nazis? How could I miss that? And I'm beyond glad I decided to purchase a ticket.

SUCKER PUNCH is a metaphor within a dream. Not everyone is going to ""get"" the film and instead will criticize it as a simple romp through a 13-year-old boy's wet dream. But the point of this story was not the sexualization of the women, but how they took it back and overcame it. The striking visual effects and unrealistic video-game-esque scenes were artistically and purposefully done. Snyder uses such outrageous fights as a five-foot tall girl versus 100-foot Samurai statues to tell the story of the strength of a group of women against enormous odds.

I loved the film. I loved the soundtrack. I loved the effects. I loved the story. I'd ignore the critics on this one and try it for yourself.",1301529600,5,974,4.690058479532164
4358699,4,B004EPYZU8,"I highly recommend this movie. It's Charlie's Angels meets Kill Bill meets Anime meets Steampunk. Without giving too much away (because you have to get at least a short synopsis before you watch or you probably won't get what's going on--I didn't and had to look up the synopsis on my phone during the movie), Baby Doll is sent to a mental institution and her way of surviving this awful place is to fantasize that she's somewhere else and in control of her environment. Her fantasies give her and her fellow inmates the tools to survive and the means to plan their escape. Good action, incredible artistry, even better music! If you're into it, it's a great chick power movie.",1301443200,4,677,4.65
4358700,5,B004EPYZU8,"""Sucker Punch"" is gorgeous.  And I'm not just talking about its quintet of leading ladies, who are all undeniably attractive.  Every shot of the movie is absolutely drool-worthy.

It's no ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Casablanca.""  But who expects it to be?  Anyone familiar with director Zack Snyder's previous films (the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""300"", ""Watchmen"") or anyone who's seen a trailer of the movie, should know exactly what to expect.

It's hard to describe the plot because there's plenty open to interpretation.  The movie follows a girl, played by Emily Browning, known to the audience mostly as ""Babydoll.""  Locked away in an insane asylum, she and/or the other girl(s) cope with reality by retreating into one or more levels of fantasy.  Now's not the place to get into my interpretation of the plot.  Suffice it to say the ""story"", while being a little bit deeper than what you'd expect from your typical action flick, is still just a line to hang jaw-dropping action scenes on.

As Snyder's first completely original screenplay, ""Sucker Punch"" is exactly what you would expect from the imagination of the man who directed ""Watchmen"".  Almost every male fantasy conceivable is brought to life on screen, from the beautiful women (obviously), to samurai swords, epic fantasy and science fiction landscapes, heavy artillery, evil robots, and more.  Snyder doesn't exactly have a flare for dialogue, and some of the lines feel clunky.  So, thankfully, not much talking is done.  The dramatic opening sequence, after a little bit of narration, is silent except for a cinematic cover of ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"", telling the audience everything they need to know through action and the actor's expressions.  Similarly, not much talking gets done during the movie's big action set pieces, definitely the highlights of the film.

As with Snyder's other films, it's easy to compare the way certain scenes are shot to a video game or a music video.  The soundtrack is perfect, incorporating covers of classic and modern rock songs perfect for each scene they accompany, including some performed by Emily Browning herself in an enchanting, haunting voice.  Even the incidental music adds to the movie's excitement.

Being a movie with five major characters that's less than two hours long, not all of the characters feel fully developed.  Jena Malone as ""Rocket"" delivers the best acting performance, sharing most of the movie's dramatic scenes with Abbie Cornish as ""Sweet Pea.""  Vanessa Hudgens as ""Blondie"" actually does surprisingly well during the action scenes, but her voice still seems too sweet for this kind of role, and she's not going to help audience forget she's a graduate of ""High School Musical"" anytime soon.  Emily Browning does a fine job with the leading role, conveying more through her big eyes and pouty lips than any of her lines.  Jamie Chung as ""Amber"", personally my favorite character, sadly gets very little screen time.  As far as supporting performances go, Carla Gugino delivers yet another solid acting job, Jon Hamm adds a touch of class, and Scott Glenn intrigues as the mysterious, homespun wisdom spurning ""Wiseman.""  Oscar Isaac is noteworthy as a nasty who doesn't seem like a typical Hollywood villain but an all-too-real sleaze ball audiences should love to loathe.

But for the most part, dialogue and story aren't Zack Snyder's strong suits.  The CGI is breathtaking, the action choreography's plenty of fun, the girls all look great, and the cinematography is a feast for the eyes.  And not just during action scenes.  Each time the camera panned around the murky corners of the asylum, I found myself turning my head to try to see what was coming.  ""Sucker Punch"" may not be for everyone, but it delivers everything the marketing promises.  It's a visual feast with a script that, while not sensational, manages to be just good enough to stay out of the way.",1301443200,3,3916,5.013931888544891

4358764,4,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch has such an extraordinary trailer that there ought to be an Oscar category for trailers, just to reward it. That may be the only recognition the film ever gets, because no full length feature film in history could live up to that kind promise, just in terms of sheer bombast. And, judging by the initial critical reaction, nor has this one got a Babydoll's chance in a House for the Mentally Insane of getting any industry recognition: it's going down like a burning zeppelin with the critics. A ""crass women's penitentiary picture reconceived for today's manga- and vidgame-savvy crowd"" says one (presumably not manga- and ""vidgame"" savvy) critic; ""built so as to dispense with the need for narrative logic"" says another. A pity, because I think the critics are wildly wrong here. With any luck the public will have a different view, because Sucker Punch almost lives up to its trailer.

It could be the greatest fantasy motion picture since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00004R80K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>. It could also be the greatest disaster since The Hindenburg. In either case the ringside seat is a scorcher.

Let's see, then.

In fairness, the film does miss a couple of the trailer's features: There's no Led Zeppelin on the soundtrack, for one thing. Nonetheless, Zack Snyder uses every trick in the book. It's beautifully shot. Every frame is a gem. The technology - there's more green screen here than in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sky-Captain-The-World-Of-Tomorrow/dp/B0006L7OB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sky Captain & The World Of Tomorrow</a>- is sympathetic, clever and impressive. It's artistic. It oozes style. It is in glorious two dimensions.

There's a little preamble which winds up in an all-girl asylum before things descend impossibly into a psychotic imaginarium of kick-ass ninja dolls, samurai, monster robots, fire-breathing dragons, sepia-tinted Nazi zeppelins and crash-&-burning bi-planes: yea: all of the above. Amongst it all, statuesque, like a serene core at the eye of the storm is super-cool Scott Glenn, a multiple personality avatar dispensing one-line platitudes to his jailbait harem as if the structural integrity of universe required it. He intones Alexander Hamilton's aphorism: ""Stand for something, or you'll fall for anything"".

Sucker Punch, indeed, stands for everything. Anything, even. So much does it play like a seventeen-year-old's wet dream that it is tempting to write it off as one.

It would appear many critics have been duly tempted. Their major complaints: Lack of wit. No plot. Wafer-thin characters. Gratuitous girlitude. The last two, sure - but, come on: the context is comic book bravura. What did you expect:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kurosawa/dp/B00004D04C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kurosawa</a>? Yes, parts of it are like stages of a video game, they are meant to be. Sucker Punch borrows from The Matrix, but repays with interest.

But lack of wit? This is a brilliantly funny picture. And no plot? Au contraire: that's a different story. In their haste to write this off, I fear the critics have forgotten to pay attention. Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury: before you bemoan a lack of intellectual endeavour, use some of your own: at least have a go at trying to puzzle things out. And there are some puzzles, if you only look for them: narrative peculiarities which Snyder has gone to some lengths to achieve. It's only fair to suppose he did this for a reason.

Firstly, the opening scene: pay attention. We open in a vaudeville theatre. The velvet curtains open on a set that is a young girl's bedroom. We see a blonde girl sitting on her bed with her back to us. Take note: This is a theatrical set of some description. It's a play. It's not real. The camera tracks in and around the girl on the bed, and as it does so the set resolves into an actual house. Then we see the girl's face. It is Babydoll (Emily Browning). Note how we are introduced to Babydoll: on a stage. It is important.

Babydoll's mother is dead. An Evil Stepfather circles like a vulture. He tries to have his way with Babydoll. She resists. He locks the door, and turns to Babydoll's little sister. Babydoll tries to intervene, but little sister winds up dead. Again, remember this. Look out for parallels with other characters later in the movie.

Babydoll is framed for her sister's murder and corruptly declared insane. She is institutionalised and maliciously scheduled for a quick lobotomy. Again, note how this happens: To a reworking of Eurhythmics'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweet-Dreams-Are-Made-Of-This/dp/B001GU516G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)</a>, a Black Maria rolls up the hill to ""Lennox House"", an institution ""FOR THE MENTALLY INSANE"" - or just of sweet dreams? Warders and orderlies leer. Babydoll is given a tour. She winds up in a common room full of crazies called ""the theatre"". At this point there is a sudden and jarring transition from Asylum to Bordello. Suddenly we are in a Burlesque Club of some sort - where did the Asylum go? We meet a showgirl Sweetpea, during a rehearsal. She breaks off, mid scene, aghast at the notion that the production should contemplate her character, an orphan, being sent to an asylum for a lobotomy. Again, note this scene.

These are hardly subtle clues. Yet still this secret seems to have eluded Hollywood's finest: Is this film really about Babydoll? It is not. Whose world is imaginary and whose is real?

Sucker Punch is certainly not perfect - it's 20 minutes too long, and for a film featuring five bombshells in their knickers, it is oddly sexless. Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac) is a bloodless villain. But as far as science fiction/fantasy goes, it is so much more sophisticated and imaginative than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar/dp/B0046A8796/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Airbender/dp/B003L772E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Airbender</a>or utterly pitiful Mars Needs Moms as indeed to seem like Kurosawa. It is stylish. It is witty. It has more bombast than Elton John's birthday. It has an attention span of about thirty seconds.

A Matrix, therefore, for the YouTube generation. God forbid that they make a sequel.

4358765,1,B004EPYZU8,"I just arrived home after bolting from the theater. I usually stay for the credits but, in this instance, I was already halfway to my car before the first name appeared. My mistake was that I listened to my teenage son. He wanted to see a movie at the last minute and as we had already seen most of the other films currently in the theaters, we went to see this train wreck. Had I known how bad Sucker Punch is, I would have scheduled an appointment to get hemorrhoids lanced or offer to clean the theater's bathroom floors with my tongue as both of those options would have been FAR more pleasant than having to suffer through this movie.

There is NOTHING positive I can possibly say about this cinematic nightmare. Horrible acting, NOTHING worth watching - it's a visual nightmare. Asinine script, insipid story. My ears were bleeding from the ""music"" that blared throughout.  Heck, the movie would have been improved, immensely, if Rebecca Black had been selected to sing the title song! LOL!

SPOILER ALERT!

The best part of the movie occurred at the end when a lobotomy is performed - it's just too bad that free lobotomies weren't offered to movie patrons as we battled to see who could run out of the theater first. I suspect that a lobotomy might be the only cure to ensure that this nightmare has been completely erased from one's gray-matter!

Run, don't walk from anyone who suggests that Sucker Punch has any value - it has NONE. Sucker Punch is a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.",1301184000,19,1482,4.556390977443609

4358767,5,B004EPYZU8,"I'm starting to wonder if we're seeing the same movies as the critics nowadays. Or at least, if we're getting different cuts of movies. Because I've often found myself walking out going ""Did I see a different movie than the critics?""

Of course, Snyder is no stranger to critical disdain. He may be the most misunderstood director out there. True his films aren't for
everyone, but if you look close enough you may just find something there. And Sucker Punch is the biggest example of how big a visionary he is- Here he manages to bring to the table a satisfying and exciting new vision.

I was in right from the opening scene. A cover of Sweet Dreams set to a fantastic and tone setting scene depicting her abuse from her wicked stepfather. WHAT an opening scene.

We are then transported to Mount Pleasant Insane Asylum, once a performing arts venue. Baby Doll is just a drop in the ocean of how
many beautiful girls who can dance. Baby Doll doesn't know this until she saves Rocket, another one of the girls. There she meets the rest of the gang, and the sexy Goski, a doctor who has a form of therapy- dance. When Baby Doll dances, she can slay dragons, fight robots, wield swords, etc. The girls love her- but as it stands, she's dancing... to escape from the asylum with the girls.

The concept may not sound dazzling- but wait till you see it. Sucker Punch is what its title states- a conceptual sucker punch. Nothing can prepare you for what you will experience. You are in the world with Baby Doll- you feel as if you are experiencing Baby Doll's therapy with her. Snyder totally does a great job with this aspect, and as a theatre nerd and dance lover, arts as therapy really hit home because it's very true, and I've experienced that euphoria from being a performer.

The acting is fantastic, and Emily Browning is great as both an action chick and a confused, disturbed girl. Cugino is sexy and adds her usual charm to her role. Hamm as Blue is easily the best, as his villain is certainly convincing.

Add to that, one of the best soundtracks ever put to film. Working with Tyler Bates, Browning covers a few songs, and quite a few others contribute too. And Bjork's ""Army of Me"" has never sounded cooler.

I was skeptical- Snyder has struck gold with 300, Watchmen and Guardians, but could he manage to make one of his original ideas spark?
As a result he can- and he did. Do NOT be a puppet of the critics- experience Sucker Punch with an open mind. Touche, Zack Snyder...

4358769,2,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch was a long awaited film(at least since Christmas for me)especially after the endlless string of mediocre, dud films that were released this last summer through fall. I was hoping for more, but at the same time I wasn't entirely surprised when Sucker Punch didn't measure up to the hype of the trailer. Personally, I'm getting a tad tired of the ""alternate reality/mind game/Matirix"" plot driven films.

Sucker Punch (as anticipated)was visually stuning, but it was largely left to the viewer to translate the rest of the film as it stalled and dragged on from one mission to the next. It seems that this film was largely depending on the ""exploitation"" of the female cast to ""sell it"" and fill in the blanks where the film lacked substance.

When in doubt, dress a hot girl like a porn star,put her in lingerie or something else tight and/or revealing and have her dance around to maintaim the male audience's interest. Kind of like what I call the ""Michael Bay soloution"", except this film uses ""skin"" and allot of ""suggestion"" instead of bullets and explosions(although there is plenty of that too).

Granted,I have to give credit where credit is due. It had originality and potential and some good art style/direction. It borrows heavily from ""Steam Punk/Heavy Metal fantasy and Samurai/Japanese film/animation, but the ""you have 5 tasks"" to complete plot and the mysterious,""only you know the answer to the riddle"" question to win your freedom has been done to death a hundred times.

Boiled down to its basics, Baby Doll is sent to an asylum by her evil step father where the girls are used(or sold) I should say to the highest bidder as sex slaves and/or objects of affection. Baby doll creates her own fantasy world to win her freedom and escape for herself and others to ultimately keep from being labotomized. Guess what happens?

I liked the the visuals, but a film being ""visually attractive"" isn't enough. Just because a film has fantastic CG and visuals doesn't make it an outstanding film let along an entertaining one. Often it played out(or reminded me) of some elaborate video game as the heroines pranaced around dressed up like Jappanese Anime characters and who (miraculasly) had super human strength and intricate knowlege of  martial arts and warfare. I know that was ""part of the fantasy"" and that being part of the gag, but it can only work for so long. In the end,I found myself wanting more from this film than it was capable of giving.

Sucker Punch will be worth renting and certainly when released on Blueray and viewed on a large Plasma/LCD screen it will look great. However,if you are looking for a storyline that will keep you going, this one is left on auto pilot virtually from the begining hoping to bedazzle you with pretty faces,tight bodies,over the top action and CG. I wouldn't pay to see an evening show at the theater,and watching a matinee is really pushing it.

The title itself has no realtion to the film at all,its just ""catchy"" and looks/sounds cool. What I can say is, ""don't be a sucker"" and pay to see it in the theater let alone buy the film when released on DVD.While I thoroughly enjoyed Sin City and 300, Sucker Punch can't deliver what is promised, not even on a strictly ""entertainment level"" which both 300 and Sin City were capable of doing. Simply put...""don't believe the hype"" because in the end, all it ends up being is just a cool movie trailer.",1301097600,10,3423,4.750841750841751

Indeed, a few of Bjork's songs are sprinkled into SUCKER PUNCH.  Think of Zack Snyder's latest as a high fantasy, computer-generated, girl power version of DANCER IN THE DARK.  Even SUCKER PUNCH'S ending scenes are similar to that movie.

Like Dancer in the Dark, the main character of SUCKER PUNCH escapes into a fantasy in order to cope with her situation.  The movie is highly episodic.  The main character Babydoll doesn't stay in her fantasy continuously, like the trailers make you believe.  Instead, she comes in and out.

A young girl's dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality. Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will, but Babydoll has not lost her will to survive. Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls--the outspoken Rocket, the street-smart Blondie, the fiercely loyal Amber and the reluctant Sweet Pea - to band together and try to escape their terrible fate at the hands of their captors, Blue, Madam Gorski and the High Roller. Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual arsenal at their disposal. Together, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man, their unbelievable journey - if they succeed - will set them free.

The cast led by Emily Browning (as Babydoll), Abbie Cornish (as Sweet Pea), Jena Malone (as Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens (as Blondie), Jamie Chung (as Amber), Carla Gugino (as Dr. Vera Gorski), Oscar Issac (as Blue), Jon Hamm (as High Roller / Doctor) & Scott Glenn (as Wise Man) is great.

This is a great action-packed ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat and your heart racing. This is an entertaining and fast-paced ride. Zack Snyder has made another great movie that is right near ""300"", ""Dawn Of The Dead"" & ""Watchmen"".",1301097600,3,4362,4.940054495912807
4358872,4,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch can be described as a big screen video game with hot chicks. It's almost as if Zack Snyder went down the check list of everything you could throw into an action film. You have your giant samurai warriors, WWI era German soldiers who are full of steam rather than blood, medievil knights, orcs, dragons, a robot army and five good looking girls with big guns. This is not going to win any awards, but I had a blast. If you liked Snyder's other movies (300, Watchmen) you can pretty much expect the same CGI bonanza, but at least it's used in moderation. All of the fantasy sequences come from the main character's imagination, who just happens to be stuck in a mental hospital and looking for a way out.

I know some have found the plot confusing. In fact, I overheard some guys leaving the theater saying that they liked the music and visuals, but didn't undertand it. I did not find it that hard to follow, but it could have used a little more work when it came to layering the story. I'm pretty sure a Director's Cut Blu-ray will be released with an R rating and hopefully some more scenes to help clear a couple of things up.

There is a lot of music in this film and not just a background score. The lead actress, the ever so cute Emily Browning, actually sings an entire cover of ""Sweet Dreams"" over the opening scenes and the classic rock tune ""White Rabbit"" gets covered at length as well as some other nice songs.

The acting and dialogue are adequate, with nobody really standing out other than the main girl. Or maybe I was just transfixed by Emily Browning's appealing face and lips?

I can't say that I've seen a bad Zack Snyder flick, so maybe the future of Superman is in good hands after all.",1301097600,49,1720,4.39937106918239

Before seeing this movie, I was fully aware of its low Metacritic rating. In spite of that, I decided to give it a try. After all, BATTLE: LA got trashed by critics and I found that movie to be not as bad as everyone said. Not only that, but I love airships, steampunk creations, WWII battles, fantasy novels, feudal Japan and photogenic women. You'd think this would be my perfect movie. I wish it was! . . . but it wasn't.

The biggest complaint I heard for Suckerpunch were the slow-motion scenes. Honestly, the slow-motion didn't bother me one bit. In fact, it was actually a RELIEF to be able to see the action instead of feeling sea-sick due to shaky-cam techniques so jarring that you'd think that Jaws was holding the camera in his mouth during a frenzied attack.

But while the slow-motion wasn't an issue, there were tons of other things that were:

1) The movie uses slow-motion to make everything look ""cool"". Bullet cases raining down, huge monsters sliding across the ground, gravity-defying acrobatics that would make any ninja jealous. Unfortunately, it's not like we haven't seen any of this before, so it may not impress you for very long.

2) There is almost no emotional attachment to any of the characters. When things happened to them, I felt as empty as the clockwork Nazis and robots that they killed by the hundreds.

3) Baby Doll's surreal music-triggered worlds are certainly entertaining at times, but the harsh truth is that probably 2/3 of the movie takes place in a depressing asylum and boring bordello dance-school. In fact, it seems like the only way they could prolong this surreal world escapism was by resorting to slow-motion while fighting copious groups of enemies.

4) Finally, I could have done without all the narrator-spoken philosophical questions used to try and4pass this movie off as ""intelligent"" and ""serious"". The ending, instead of blowing you away, bores you with admonishment. I thought this was going to be a mindless, surreal fantasy romp, not AESOP'S FABLES.

ALTERNATIVES:

If you like the ""Girl uses her imagination to replace reality"" plotline, then I highly recommend PAN'S LABYRINTH--a film with a far better story and engaging soundtrack.

If you're into perverted chef's and weird characters in general, try Mervyn Peake's GORMENGHAST books. You won't find a more twisted chef than Abiatha Swelter.

This movie tries to show that you can use the power of your mind to make realities more palatable. Unfortunately, no amount of imagination can delude me into thinking that this movie is anything more than a fantasy with a lot of flaws.",1301097600,19,2614,4.904761904761905
4358874,4,B004EPYZU8,"There a many reasons I was (and remain) excited for the release of Suckerpunch:

 1) An original concept by the director of such Graphic Novel adaptations as 300, Watchmen and the Upcoming Man of Steel Superman reboot project, too.

2.) I'm always ready for Retro-Neo-Anime-kick-a$$-Chicks, including the lovely  Emily Browning as an institutionalized girl slated for a lobotomy who escapes to a reality as Babydoll along with 4 equally hot inmates the brash Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-wise Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the loyal Amber (Jamie Chung) and dear-reluctant Sweet-Pea (Abbie Cornish) as fact and fiction merge.

3.)Suckerpunch is the first mainstream DieselPunk movie since 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' or 'Dark City' although it is not a pure example of the sub-genre as there's modern firearms and fantasy aspects present which diverges from traditional Dieselpunk. If you aren't familiar with the genre DieselPunk it's a term coined by  by game designer Lewis, to include a WW II  look along with stylistic influences of that period like Art Deco, pulp serial film cliffhangers , film noir, even  pinups.

Ultimately Suckerpunch's premise of removing us and characters from the 'real'  world provides ammo for over-the-top action, but at the cost of creating cliched characters. While one can make an argument for the archetypes and roles assumed here, it can also be argued it can be too formulaic. The film's action scenes are epic, no question, but opportunities are missed to develop them. In the end a needed narrator closes the gaps in on-screen exposition with what can also be construed as a stylistic element and not a flaw in
character development or storytelling.

The story is largely akin to Alice in Wonderland meets the Anime feature of your choice.,, our incarcerated heroines band together to escape the hands of Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm) by collecting 5 symbolic items,  a map, fire, a knife,  a key and a mystery all while building their own sense of self-worth, of course.

 Having grown up with the Star Wars saga, the storytelling aspects of film scoring is a very important consideration for me; here Suckerpunch is a knockout (sorry). The soundtrack merges nicely with it's visuals, single songs framing scenes using clever covers, mash-ups and remixes from Queen, Bjork, The Pixies, The Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, Iggy Pop. Some featuring vocals from stars themselves, for example, Emily Browing's cover of Eurythmics'""Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This""

Other casting includes Jonathan Perez as Magician,  Vicky Lambert as The Countess, Danny Bristol as Little Tommy Soldier",1301097600,4,2681,5.2266355140186915

4358876,5,B004EPYZU8,"Damn Sucker Punch was EPIC! So ZEN!

Too bad 99% of ppl ""will be unprepared"" to understand the overly simple, perhaps too RAW (lol), yet profound message of the film:

It's NOT about the story making sense! It's about YOU making sense of the story... not Baby Doll's story, not Sweet Pea's story, but YOUR story!

99% of people prefer to be TOLD why something makes sense, rather than stepping up and making sense out of something for themselves.

So in honoring the message of the film, I'll ""step up"" and ""make sense"" of the film's story for the many who have seen it but still complain that it was the DIRECTOR'S responsibility to provide ""clarity"" for the audience despite critics complaining at the same time that the dialogue was ""not complex enough""

In a nut shell, a girl ""loses everything"" (her mom, her sister, her sanity) essentially becoming ""an orphan"" and is thrown into a chaotic world that doesn't make sense (note: it MADE sense BEFORE she ""lost everything"")

NOW she is trapped in this prison called ""reality"" populated only by ""whores"" and their ""masters"".

The ""whores"" do what their masters tell them because they are not ""free"" to do otherwise, and in fact rationalize that their masters are allowing them to ""be who they are"" so it's all good.

However the orphan girl ""Baby Doll"" decides to be ""selfish"" and say being ""allowed to exist"" by the masters of the their world ""isn't good enough"" and that ""survival is not enough"" and that it is only really worth it if you are truly ""free"" on your own terms.

She recruits others to their cause and the very fact that they join says that despite the ""fear"" they feel of leaving ""everything they know and have"" behind, a tiny part of them agrees that being ""truly free"" (ie their own masters) is more selfishly desirable than the illusion of ""being who they are"" when it is the ONLY option dictated to them by their masters.

Over the course of their plan to become free not everyone ""survives"" but then again everyone is destined to die anyway (yeah nobody wants to hear that but it IS true hate to break the bad news =P) and in the end all that was really accomplished was turning a team of ""whores"" INTO ""masters"" of their own story...

So basically yeah, a long selfless life as a whore, or a short SELFISH life as a master is basically what their story boils down to =D

But the irony is that this simple example is the same choice everyone needs to make with their lives but these are EXTREME examples

(Hello, it's a movie! extreme examples are the only way to get your attention! 99% of people are BORING examples)

Yes ideally you want to life a LONG SELFISH LIFE (like The Matrix, like Inception, like Avatar where you get to be selfish AND have a ""happy ending"")

But since 99% of people are not being selfish enough in their REAL LIVES after watching these so called ""inspirational life changing reality mind-opening outside the box idea"" movies, Sucker Punch decides to ""fast-forward"" from the ""happy ending"" moment that the former three movies leave you at and go all the way until Baby's apparent ""death""

Many people see this as a ""letdown"" because she ""died"" almost like she was ""punished"" by death for being ""too selfish"" and that despite how hard she tried, it was all for nothing and she ended up ""a failure"" unlike Neo, Cobb, and Sully who selfishly went against all odds to be ""truly free"" and ""won"" a ""happy ending""

These people are TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT: Neo, Cobb, and Sully all die too, their deaths are just never shown.

Baby's IS shown, and the point is that it's not about the happy ending but about the happy JOURNEY.

""The end"" is 100% certain but ""the journey"" is YOUR choice! And that choice is ""happy journey"" or ""sad journey"", end be damned!

Baby KNEW she was going to die, in fact she KNEW before her journey even started! (Proof: she was just seconds away from getting lobotomized before her journey began =P)

In the some of the final scenes of the movie, Baby realizes her time is up, it's not longer her story but Sweet Pea's now (and ultimately the viewer's story after passing on that message)

Baby may not have reached the ""goal"" of her ""physical"" journey to ""escape the prison and gain freedom"" but in a ZEN sense, the self-chosen journey itself WAS the freedom she sought, it WAS the reward, as the map, fire, knife, and key were just breadcrumb ""goals"" leading her to the ultimate realization of the final goal: ""self"" is what sets you free.

Also in the final moments where the doc says ""look at her face, it's almost like she WANTED this"" and the former ""master"" being dragged off for being ""mentally insane"" can basically be interpreted in the extreme sense that she made the CHOICE to live by the standards of her own inner world rather than by what her external world told her

(Nobody WANTS death, but PHYSICAL death is INEVITABLE, so the only thing you really have a true choice of freewill over is SPIRITUAL death or spiritual LIFE and she ""physically"" died making the SPIRITUAL choice she WANTED =P)

Then the former ""master"" gets dragged away ""defeated"" as he has ""failed"" to get her to submit to ""spiritual death"" and is exposed to the audience as being the true ""insane"" one.

Also for further clarity, once Baby realized ""self = freedom"" her journey was complete as she was ""seconds away from physical death"" and ""out of time"" so it was no longer ""her story"" and now Sweet Pea's and ultimately the viewer's story.

Scenes of Sweet Pea getting on the bus with a ""long journey"" ahead of her accompanied by Baby's wisdom ""the wise man"" she has ""all the tools"" she needs to fight / write her own story / live the journey as her own master and not as somebody else' whore etc.

THAT is ultimately the message the movie was intended to deliver, but instead of simply saying it this complexly, the Director expects YOU to DO WORK and THINK about it to make your own CHOICES about what the message actually was...

If they TOLD you what ""it"" was like every other movie out there, it wouldn't have the same effect of YOU making sense of things YOURSELF

So essentially anyone who complains about the ""ending"" is just ""unprepared"" to think for themselves because they cling to the mantra that movies should TELL rather than EXPRESS and let the viewer make the DECISION on how to interpret life

(Maybe it's just saying that all the people who didn't understand the movie are to some degree still ""whores"" and have yet to truly become masters of their own stories and that if a rebel orphan comes along and tries to recruit you on a ""suicide"" mission where you'll ""get what you truly desire"" by ""giving up everything you currently hold dear"" then you should just ignore her and stay in ""blissful ignorance"" of the ""illusion that you are free"" until the day you die... just kidding....... kinda ;)

OR maybe I was just ""lucky"" to read the multiple ""grade F"" reviews by the majority of so called ""professional"" movie critics allowing me to completely disregard the hype, go into the theater EXPECTING complete crap, and yet walk away from the experience with an unbiased pure, personal interpretation of the EXPRESSION that is Sucker Punch haha...

But yeah, subtle & simple yet profound & ""zen"" meaning of life message and ending aside, the ""journey"" of the movie was MORE than enjoyable with EPIC comicbook/scifi/fantasy inspired eye-candy visuals, great music, and a harem of hotties including blondes, asian, and VANESSA HUDGENS! ...what's NOT to like? <3

Oh... and for the retards who complain ""but we never got to SEE the actual dance"" ...the ""Fantasy/action/dream sequence"" IS the DANCE effin retards ...it's called a METAPHOR!

""Dance"" is on a fundamental level simply just ""expressing"" your ""inner world"" to anyone who wants to see it.

Dancers don't TELL, they EXPRESS so therefore the viewer isn't TOLD anything, he/she can only INTERPRET the dancer's self expression based on his/her own DECISIONS.

Dancers are Performing ARTISTS so in a sense the entire movie isn't really a story TELLING you what it IS, it's just ART, the whole film is a DANCE for the audience to interpret and decide what to make of it on their own, because hey ""a picture is worth a thousand words""

Sucker Punch is ART in the purist sense of the word. Film ORIGINATED as an ART (not as storytelling like writing) something which most movies and viewers tend to forget =)",1301097600,8,8380,4.629554655870446
4358877,4,B004EPYZU8,"Note: I wrote an original review for the film only way back when I saw it, which was actually on opening day.  Now that I have acquired the Blu-Ray version of Sucker Punch, I will write a review.  My consensus though is to purchase the Blu-Ray package over the DVD, so if you just want to read my thoughts on the movie, skip this section.  I will review the Blu-Ray.  If you are wanting to know everything about the layout and the general features, Amazon is correct with both product descriptions, so you can trust them.

When I first saw Sucker Punch in theaters, the art direction, CGI, and the colors was absolutely jaw dropping; this was one of the movies that I could see blasting on my TV screen. Well, I am happy to report that Sucker Punch looks and sounds terrific on Blu-Ray.  Given the sensory overload Sucker Punch provides, one can only imagine how the potential of the , and the transfer does its justice and brings Sucker Punch to complete life upon your HD TV.  The picture is crystal clear and sharp, which gives way to an absolutely dazzling high definition picture on screen.  Sucker Punch's intense colors, elaborate architecture, and stylized visuals all come to life onscreen, with a visual intensity on the same boat as any high production value video game would be able to achieve (Think Uncharted 2 or God of War 3.  Sucker Punch can surely compete with both games in terms of visual splendor).  All the little details of the visual intensity absolutely stand out and are crystal clear.  You can see everything little snow-flake, bit of explosion, and piece of dust, yet the little details don't substantiate the stylized and beautiful landscape and architecture.  I give the picture an easy 10.  It looks absolutely amazing.  So safe to say, it is ABSOLUTELY worth buying for television viewing.

The audio is not quite as impressive as the picture of the film (seems fitting, however, given the visual approach to the film), but the sound is no slouch either (I think this has to do with the fact that the Sound design by default is not as good as, say, Saving Private Ryan or Lord of the Rings).  Sucker Punch will still work out your home theater system, so if you have a great sound system, it's time to watch Sucker Punch with it.  The movie really takes advantage of the DTS Sound track, as you will be able to hear the explosions surround you, the bullets clanking, whizzing, and whining and all around you, and the adjacent sound effects to the visual keys that Zack Snyder is so fond of using is crystal clear and satisfying.  Your theater will rumble, and you will be totally surrounded by the immersive sound to really match the whole movie.  What else could you ask for?  I give the sound a 10, although the sound design is a 9.

As most of you already know, the Blu-Ray version of Sucker Punch adds 18 minutes to the movie.  This is a whole 18 minutes of new film footage. More dialogue is added to certain scenes, and while they really don't radically make the story better in a way, it does add some fluency and color to the movie.  These add more color and life to the characters and situations.  There is also more action to make those peaks and valleys of the action more effective, and there are a couple more graphic shots to the action scenes, as there is a bit more gore.  There is also the cut scene that Snyder had to remove (which deals with a sexual encounter),  The most prominent addition to the film is a eye catching and theatrical musical number, and it doesn't at all tone down the pure visual and aural onslaught the movie previously had.  I'm not going to give out spoilers but the is worth seeing and makes the movie even more of a blast than it was in theaters.  Really, what else can you ask for?

As far as the rest of the special features go, here they are.

Maximum Movie Moment with Zack Snyder: The informative and fun special feature from the Watchmen Blu-Ray returns for another round, with Zack Snyder stepping out of the director's chair to give us more insight as to how the film was made, all interactive and almost feels hands-on to an extent.  In the Maximum Movie Moment, Zack Snyder discusses how certain interesting and intricate shots and portions of the film were made, which really satisfy the question of ""How did they film that?"".  He is not on-screen the whole time, but there's more than enough useful information to make the feature very worthwhile and awesome.  In addition, some sketches and storyboards are thrown into the mix.  Zack Snyder really shows how, and with something as interesting and useful as what he does with MMM, who needs it?

*Sucker Punch: Behind the Soundtrack-A somewhat interesting mini-feature regarding the unique and stylistically interesting sound track.  Unfortunately, it's wait too short.  Giving the short running time (only 3 minutes), Zack Snyder and and company do not go into much detail when it comes to the soundtrack.  They basically just give a loose overview of how they came up with the soundtrack.  That's it.  Sure, it's interesting, but honestly, however, it's not a must see special feature.

*Four motion comics: These four ""comics"" remind me of a moving graphic novel of sorts.  I think they are not substantial, but they do give background and interesting that further flesh out parts of the film.  On the downside, each of them are only 3-4 minutes, and there are only four of them.  At least they cut to the chase, which, actually, may strengthen their impact.

In addition, the Blu-Ray Combo pack, as you can tell, also comes with a Digital copy and a DVD of the theatrical release (NOT a Blu-Ray version).  Be quick though with the Digital copy; however, as all of the digital copies I have owned eventually expire.

Finally, should you get Blu-Ray or DVD?  As mentioned before, I do not own the DVD, however, my best advice would be to spend the extra money on the Blu-Ray version of the movie.  The Sucker Punch DVD is a bit too bare bones, as the two special feature that the DVD have the run time of less than 20 minutes.  Another nail in the coffin when it comes to the two is that the price of the Blu-Ray is not much greater than the DVD.  Personally, I would recommend springing for the Blu-Ray version, hands down.  If you do not own a Blu-Ray player and have no intention of ever getting one, I can see why one could settle for the DVD.  But if you in any way have a choice between the two, I would recommend spring for the Blu-Ray version for sure.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

After being disappointed with Battle: LA in theaters a couple weeks ago, I crossed my fingers and hoped that Sucker Punch would be the good Spring movie that kicks a major amount of @$$, like Kick @$$ did last year.  Well, I put my trust in Zack Synder, and he didn't disappoint.  Sucker Punch has got some critical backlash, but what for?  Who cares anyway?  Sucker Punch, with thrilling action, a massive scope, the patented Zack Snyder style of film making, and absolutely GORGEOUS imagery sensory overload, make this film a must see.  It also happens to have some actual decent acting (well, a little over the top, but for this movie it makes sense) and a plot that actually not half brain dead.

So what is this movie about anyway?  Well Sucker Punch, while not totally original (the film conjures up many other works as influences, such as Alice in Wonderland, Philip K. Dick, and The Matrix), is a film that blends themes such as freedom, reality, identity, the power of imagination, and escapism, among other things.  Sucker Punch is a film that deals with a young girl who is framed for murder, and is about to experience a lobotomy.  Given five days of her sanity, she then makes a list of things she needs to escape the institution.  Through dancing in order to distract certain members of the mental institution/brothel to get the things she needs to escape (yes, you read that right), she teams up with four other patients to escape the place they have been held in.

Character development, I'll admit, is pretty sparse here.  You pretty much know the characters themselves very quickly, and there's nothing too revealing or deep about them.  Thankfully though, the film manages to make the characters interesting and likable, thanks to the acting.  Sure, you don't find any Oscar winning performances here, but I think it works by just letting the actresses and actors just act like, well human beings, and it's very much present here (that is, if people actually pay attention).  I actually think this work better than trying to add a bunch of stupid back stories that we've all heard a million times before; a cheap way to try to humanize a character if you ask me.  Snyder is also able to milk the likability of these young actresses to make, them, well, likable, so for all of it's positive aspects characters are not really a problem.  As long as you are not expecting the character study that Snyder's Watchmen was a couple years ago, there won't be much problem here.

Sucker Punch, also, has a very emotional undercurrent to it's dilemmas, which was all the more powerful and effective.  There's something about the motives of these people and what they are doing that really gives the film the various subtexts it needs, no small feet there.  Sure, it's still an action film at heart, but Sucker Punch does leave quite a bit to talk about, and no harm can come from that.  All well and good, but that's not even the best part of the movie.....

The best part though, is this film is a VISUAL medium no halls barred.  I've seen three Snyder films, and Sucker Punch outclasses both 300 AND Watchmen.  Snyder sure knows how to really use the visual film medium, and Sucker Punch holds nothing back.  Iconic slow motion everywhere, massive sweeping cinematography, and a unique melding of aesthetic make Sucker Punch have more visual delights in one film that the most of the other bid budget films released every year do combined.  Most importantly, Snyder has a sense of wonder and awe that so many countless big budget action films are sorely lacking, the imagery forces your to look on.  I must have sat in the theater with my jaw dropped the whole two hours.  From huge castles and dragons, dark and grimy asylum halls, Gothic WW1 wastelands with zombies, to a truly awesome futuristic land of trains, futuristic cities set in a galaxy next to a planet.  In addition, music and sound also plays a integral role as well, with tons of great sound effects, and a soundtrack with songs from Jefferson Airplane, Pixies, and The Beatles filtered through a dark, almost cyberpunk type of aesthetic, as sweeping as the imagery on screen.  Indeed, everything about the film making is first rate.

The elaborate worlds that Babydoll and company are thrust into are amazing to look at. Massive, eclectic, and designed with incredible detail, Snyder did not stop at all in making truly immersible and jaw dropping worlds. Add that with Snyder's great use of music, and you got one heck of a great movie experience. These worlds are as imaginative as you would expect from any Grade A video game, and Snyder doesn't hold anything back in his head. You won't get any lukewarm art design when these action scenes hit the screen (in case you haven't figured it out, all the action scenes are in their head). Speaking of the action, it's, for a lack of a better word, absolutely thrilling. It's just as good as you would expect from Snyder. Massive monster fights from cool looking Samurais to dragons, lot's of guns, huge explosions, heart stopping action that feels like it can pirouette on a dime, it's all here and more. It doesn't let up the intensity either, and each one is a roller coaster ride of sheer movie delight. It has all the giddy thrill you would get from watching movies such as Transformers, 300 (yes, same director I know), or Kill Bill (although obviously not R rated), so that's a big compliment on Snyder's part.

Alright, if my rambling hasn't convinced you already that this movie is worth seeing, then you might as well skip it.  Ignore the critical backlash Sucker Punch has received.  It's totally worth seeing.  It's clear that Zack Snyder always takes pride in his films and loves making them to make them, and it shines through here.  As long as you are not expecting Andrei Rublev or a Mike Leigh film, you should at least go into the movie knowing what you are going to get.  Sucker Punch, thanks to the visionary and imaginative directing of Zack Snyder, is easily an action film that, well, beats out the competition.  Recommended.",1301097600,219,12596,4.624831309041835
4358878,4,B004EPYZU8,"Because that's the kind of movie Sucker Punch is, point blank it's just there to entertain you. It's like a video game with insanely good graphics got together with a comic book and deided to make an anime music vidio mash up, Are ypu still with me. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. As long as you not looking for a complex plot or 4 star acting. Sucker Punch is built on it's action sequences and it's clear from go that this were SAnyder's priority you sort of get the feeling that he circled back around to squeeze a story in with the deadline coming up fast. which is a shame because the story had real potential. leaving that aside and as long as you don't mind having almost the entire plot given away near the begining of the movie, Sucker Punch fires on all the cylinders that most people go to action movies for. guns,knives, a sword. creatures futuristic zombies, lots of things that go boom and hot girls in shrt skirts. it's PG13 though so if strings of profanity and sex are must haves for you, you won't find it here. So why did I give it four stars, because the action was great amd the imagery was fantastic  But above all I liked Sucker punch because I went into the theater thinking that I already know what the film would be and it ended up being somthing else amost entirely. and I love when I movie suprises me. I'll say briefly that a major plus for me was was that Babydoll dosn't stand around looking holding a gun and looking sexy while she waits for the hero to rescue her, I know this deviation from the usual action movie plot is not unheard of... Underworld, Kill Bill, Tomb Raider ect.. it's still nice to see. A quick note on the music. I think not going for a tradtional action movie score was the right call here,the songs chosen encapsulted the film and represented the characters far batter. An orchestral would have been awkward given the overall look and feel of the film. To sum up Sucker Punch won't be winning best picture anytime soon but it is a good time. and I'll be looking out for the dvd.",1301011200,2,2038,4.349081364829396
4358879,3,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch, starring Emily Browning, arrived with a lot of hype and more than a few expectations.  But when a movie starts making you wish you were watching Matrix: Reloaded, you're in trouble.

We start out on a dark and stormy night with Browning's unnamed character in her room awaiting the inevitable bad news of her mother's death.  She tries to comfort her little sister, but Slimy Stepdad can't be more thrilled about this- until he finds out the girls are left all the money.  One too many drinks later he barges into Browning's room; she scratches his face and locks him out, so he goes after the sister.  Browning finds his gun and fires, missing but somehow taking out her little sister.  SS has her institutionalized at Lennox House for the Mentally Insane (sic) run by Dr. Gorski (Carla Guigino) and bribes the Head Intern (Oscar Isaac- King John from Robin Hood) to schedule her for a lobotomy.

At a critical moment, Browning funnels her surroundings into an elaborate fantasy- much like Keyser Soze in Usual Suspects. Browning, now called Babydoll, re-imagines the institution as a burlesque club/bordello of sorts run by Blue (Isaac), while Gorski (Guigino) becomes the matron and dance instructor.  In this fantasy she meets the other girls- Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), her little sister Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung)- who seem to like spending all their time in fishnets and bustiers.  Babydoll then drifts into her own fantasy- sort of like Inception, a dream within a dream.  Here she meets the Wise Man (Scott Glenn) whose fortune-cookie advice sets her on the path.

Back at the bordello, Babydoll gets the others to follow her in a lame scheme (it is a fantasy, after all) to collect five blatantly foreshadowed items to help them escape.  As each opportunity to collect these items arises, Babydoll returns to the Wise Man for a mission briefing, with the girls in tow.  Once engaged, they all strut around in even more stripper-riffic costumes, blasting the CGI scenery into hash as Babydoll guides them to their level achievements... I mean, objectives.  But their problems are far from over: one of the missions costs a girl her life even as Blue suspects trouble and confirms it from an unlikely source.

This flick is built upon pop culture references and homages.  From Robocop to Terminator to Star Wars, Crouching Tiger, The Matrix and yes, even Kill Bill, this is pure Fanboy Fantasy from start to finish.  Snyder pushes all the buttons- hot babes, samurais, katanas, orcs, dragons, steampunk, kung-fu and other assorted bad-a$$ery are lovingly served up in slo-mo CGI closeups focusing on the Hot Blondes while the Token Asian and Sultry Brunette take up the background.  Problem is you'll be nodding to sleep waiting for the next sequence to happen.  The plot is nonsense, especially as you're practically told twenty minutes in how it's gonna end.  The only question that remains is how it all ties together, and it's pretty corny when it does.  It's not like you're expecting this to be a tour-de-force, but a little something to work with would've been nice.

Even the soundtrack is a little grating.  While the soundtrack itself is smoking hot, the songs are inserted at the start of every fantasy sequence like markers, which at full volume got a little annoying (Hey- look what we're doing now! LOOK!  IT'S METAPHOR!!!).  Whatever orchestrations Tyler Bates used to fill in the gaps weren't even noticeable beneath all the chaos.

Zach Snyder has described the film as ""Alice in Wonderland with machine guns"", including dragons, B-25 bombers and brothels.  He wishes.  AiW had a story to tell.  This is chicks in high heels and tights with guns- period.  Don't look for any more than that, and you should be ok.",1301011200,10,3796,4.9043887147335425
4358880,4,B004EPYZU8,"The first thing you have to do is lower your expectations of this film. It's not 300. And it's not Watchmen. Those are two phenomenal films based off of someone else's intellectual property. This is Zack Snyder's own, and in many ways it's unfair to compare Sucker Punch to those two films. What Sucker Punch is is pure exploitation; it's piled to the brim with over-the-top action sequences, and has as much fan-service as an old Burlesque film.

Sucker Punch follows the Alice-in-Wonderland-like adventures of Babydoll, a twenty-year-old girl who is having the worst week of her life. Her mother has just died, and her and her sister must face a future with her stepfather. Babydoll's stepfather, a dispicable man, finds out that all of his wife's possessions were left to the two girls, and this sends him into a rage. The result of this rage puts Babydoll into a mental hospital where the orderlies have taken control. Now Babydoll faces lobotomy if she can't find a way to escape the hospital. The new world she enters completely envelopes her, and she begins her quest to find the items needed to escape her fate....

Understand this about Sucker Punch: it's a fantasy film. That means suspending disbelief. A lot of the scenes are chaotic depictions of future or fantastic landscapes. Robo-Nazi-Zombies, Japanese demons, dragons fighting World War 2 era planes, and a future civilization on one of the moons of Jupiter can all be found in this movie. Zack Snyder takes a lot of liberties, and considering the themes of the story (rabbit-hole and mental illness), he does a fine job at conveying his action-oriented story.

If you love 300 and Watchmen, then you should like Sucker Punch. It's filmed in the same style, gritty and oft-times violent. But if you're expecting 300 and Watchmen then no doubt you'll be disappointed. Sucker Punch's story is not a powerhouse. It's a means to drive the action of this film. It's not bad, it just isn't very substantial. Besides that, it's a very satisfying movie. One other important note: Sucker Punch has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie.",1301011200,2,2107,4.847222222222222

LoL And let's not forget its flippy twisty inny outty deeply profound story and edgy plot. Quick delivery makes it five but I almost made it to four because there is no digital code and the barcode does not scan when trying to digitize it, but it's a throwback so I'll let it slide.

8427410,4,B004EPYZU8,"Sucker Punch is a dark and surreal fantasy action/adventure with a style heavily influenced by video games and anime, its visually stunning (even by 2018 standards) and I found EVERY alternate reality sequence absolutely spellbinding.  Unfortunately the main story is depressing to the point of despair, the decidedly misandrist  subtext off-putting and the ending (SPOILERS) basically tosses out 90 minutes of heroic struggle in lieu of a cheap everyone deserves a trophy theme.
