8756005,5,B01DJ62SUQ,"Daniel Bruhl is quite a talented actor whom Hollywood has finally started casting in big name movies, so don't miss the chance to see this earlier work of his about an apocalyptic Europe.  Hopefully our hunger for Middle Eastern petroleum resources has subsided, as this film explores what could happen if it doesn't.",1520294400,,317,4.981132075471698
8756006,5,B01DJ62SUQ,"Excellent movie. Very thoughtful and thought-provoking political thriller as well as a very moving love story. Though the story is set in the near future it's not a bleak science-fiction film nor a depiction of a dystopian future. It is a very plausible and cautionary tale with real existing, tragic humanitarian problems transposed to Berlin in the 2020s.",1518048000,,357,5.172413793103448
