4130911,5,B003JLL2Q8,"This movie is excellent and one of Meredith Baxter's best roles as far as I am concerned.  It tells the painful story of a family torn apart by adultery, but there is much more to it.  Truly a touching movie about marriage, love and ultimately the ability to forgive.",1362355200,,267,4.428571428571429

4130913,3,B003JLL2Q8,"I love Meredith Baxter, ive seen most of her movies and they and are all pretty good but this one was a little disappointing. Alot of questions were unanswered: like what happened to the daughter? How did she cope with the break up? And what Joan said disappointed me, when she said ""What happened was normal"" Cheating on your wife is not normal. All four of them should have went to counselling and talked about the situation instead of leaving it up in the air.",1358640000,4,463,4.458823529411765
4130914,5,B003JLL2Q8,I have bought several DVDs on line through Amazon and the descriptions of the movies are very accurate.  They always arrive quickly and in very good condition.  Only one time did I have to return a movie but that was a simple error of which area the movie could be played in.  The one I received was only for Great Britain but the seller was able to refund my money as soon as I returned the item.  Unfortunately he didn't have another one but I was able to find one on Amazon.  It's great to be able to buy older movies through Amazon and their sellers.,1349568000,,554,4.188679245283019

4130916,5,B003JLL2Q8,"This Movie should say Two Women and a Husband - I'm not going to give away the story here - but I'll say this - I believe most adults will enjoy this film - There is no foul language / no nudity and if I was going to rate it - I'd give it a PG13 only because under 16 I don't believe would understand the friendships involved / the parenthood's involved. Four 1/2 Stars is my real rating and that's because the first 15 minutes are very slow to the real true grit of this film.

They just aren't convincing. Or likeable. This movie was well thought out in how it showed how people react differently to ""messes"" like what was portrayed in the movie. We saw how each person's personality and position affected how they coped and adapted. The actors all pulled it off. It was an real journey how Meredith Baxter's character came to accept what happened and change... or at least struggle to find the path forward to survive. I had forgotten what good acting was.",1425859200,2,653,4.6869565217391305

I can't blame the actors because they didn't write the script, but I must say that the dialogue (often melodramatic) was so ridiculous that it was funny, and I mean ""laugh out loud"" funny, in parts. If this was intended as a farce it deserves three stars, but as a serious drama it failed terribly.",1424476800,7,470,4.3522727272727275

4131078,5,B003JLL2Q8,"This is an excellent movie of it's type.  And who doesn't enjoy a good drama sometimes.  This is very well written, well acted, well directed.  I really enjoyed it. One thing I would like to have had the mother say to the daughter would have been ""Have you ever heard of THE REBOUND? This just reeks of REBOUND. It is what you are doing now that is causing so much trouble. You are REBOUNDING. You left college with a broken heart because of somebody you met there and almost as soon as you get home you begin an affair with the most inappropriate man you could possibly find"". Also, there is only one throw away line by Baxter about ""almost incest"". I thought this should have been stressed more.  There is a big difference in a man having an affair with another woman and his having an affair with the much younger daughter of his wife's best friend whom he has known as well as his own children since she was very small.  THAT does smack of incest.  Hard to forgive and forget something like that because it says something serious about him as a person.",1407110400,9,1056,4.362244897959184

4131083,1,B003JLL2Q8,"Amanda (Meredith Baxter) has a perfect life and is a wonderful woman. She has a beautiful house, two wonderful sons, and a hard-working husband. Her best friend Joan (Swoosie Kurtz) is a widow who has a daughter, Dana, who apparently has had a nervous breakdown? Broke up with a boyfriend? Dropped out of college? Or just didn't go back when college started the next semester? Anyway, Amanda's husband, Rob, has given Dana an internship at his firm.

SPOILERS

For some reason, although Dana used to take naps as child in Rob's and Amanda's marital bed, and also used to babysit their boys, she and Rob begin an affair. No one knows or suspects, except Rob's boss. Rob (says he) works late all the time and is always coming up with excuses. Proving that they are both very, very stupid, Rob goes to Dana's house (Joan's house) to fool around with her, and guess what? Joan comes home, to her house. What a surprise!

Joan is very angry, and tells Dana to get out of her house, which she does not. She keeps living with and off of Mommy. Joan tries to tell Amanda, but can't get the words out. Rob finally tells Amanda that he's having an affair (she catches him crying and pries it out of him), but doesn't tell her who the other woman is. Finally it's out in the open that the other woman is Dana, and Amanda and one of her boys are furious. The other boy is kind of laid-back, and his dad is going to buy him a car, so he has a kind of ""wait and see"" attitude.

The furious son confronts Dana (he had wanted to date her) and she cries when he talks about all the people she has hurt. Dana doesn't really care about the others and what her choices have done to them; you can tell she's only crying because she's feeling sorry for herself. She then happily meets Rob again at the hotel room, ready to continue. Rob has had a quick change of heart though, and all of a sudden, realizes what he stands to lose.

He tries to get back with Amanda, and she tells him he betrayed her and lied to her. He says everyone lies, so get used to it, but now he is being honest (that must have been difficult). He really doesn't get it, or care to get it. He's just thinking of himself and trying to get back what he had. He doesn't empathize with Amanda and what he's has chosen to do to their marriage, and to Amanda's belief system.

However, Amanda must have considered being on her own, and decides to forgive Rob; she says she knows he's sorry. That makes everything okay. She asks how she will be able to trust him again and he has no answer for that. He tells her he missed her and he loves her (now that he's not with Dana anymore). He wasn't missing her or loving her while he was cheating on her with her best friend's daughter, but if this occurs to Amanda, she doesn't say so.

Amanda is angry with Joan, and Joan says everything wrong, so you can't really blame Amanda. Joan has zero interpersonal skills. She tells Amanda to ""Calm down!"" She tells her that she is being irrational, and later, that Amanda had better lower her standards, or they can't be friends. Amanda doesn't like this. She doesn't like being told that her values are wrong and that everything she believed in was wrong, but that doesn't matter to Joan. She has no compassion for Amanda, she is just insistent and persistent, because she wants her friend back, and HER life back the way it was (pretty much as Rob does). Joan is like a child. Are we supposed to believe that Joan's ""pep talk"" to Amanda really made her see things in a new and improved light?

This film never gets to the heart of the matter, which is: Why would Dana have an affair with Rob, her mother's best friend's husband? According to Joan, she raised her better than that, but Dana never gives her reason, from which I can only conclude that she is a selfish skank. Why did Rob, supposedly so perfect, fall for Dana, who is younger, but really nothing remarkable? There does not seem to be much going on behind this actor's eyes, so it's difficult to tell. He doesn't seem to go very deep.

There is no explanation as to why Rob and Dana felt entitled to do as they pleased. The remorse they felt (if any) was only for themselves, not for those they hurt. They both came across as ""Looking out for Number One."" So we shall never know what that really was about.",1401667200,24,4305,4.324659231722428

4131093,4,B003JLL2Q8,"It's a typical day for Joan Bixler (Swoosie Kurtz) until she returns home to a shock--her college-aged daughter, Dana, making love to the husband of her best friend, Amanda (Meredith Baxter).

In a single moment, years of friendship and bond between mother and daughter are hopelessly shattered. Joan banishes Dana from her home and Amanda leaves her unfaithful husband, but when they need each other most, the best friends are driven apart by rage and guilt...unless they can gather the strength from within to forgive each other.",1390780800,4,531,5.103448275862069
4131094,3,B003JLL2Q8,80-early 90s throwback.  Reminded me of a Lifetime movie.  Acting was good and the emotion was definitely believable.  Wouldn't expect anything less from these 2 women.,1389830400,,168,5.384615384615385
4131095,4,B003JLL2Q8,"We like Swoosie and Meredith, so it's an easy 4 stars. Definitely worth watching. Starts slowly, but has a pretty good ending.",1388966400,,126,4.7727272727272725
4131096,3,B003JLL2Q8,"It's well done for a made for tv movie but not sure this was anything more. It's well-enough acted, a rather overdone story but thoughtful in its treatment...",1388275200,,158,4.678571428571429
4131097,2,B003JLL2Q8,"The acting was sooo campy and over the top. I wanted a brain candy movie. However, it could have been better candy. Sorry I wasted hours of my life watching this movie.",1387756800,2,168,4.28125
4131098,4,B003JLL2Q8,"While this movie is much like a number of movies that cover the subject of affairs, it is a good one to watch because it asks the question, What would I do if this happened to me?  It is a difficult situation to be in for anyone and we all know someone who has gone through this type of situation in our lives.  Some come out of it ok and some never recover from the betrayal.",1384819200,,376,3.9342105263157894

4131100,5,B003JLL2Q8,"Good subject matter, a well written script. Great actresses in the main characters, an excellent supporting cast. All around a very interesting film to watch-could've delved deeper,that would have made it really compelling to watch-a must see. As it is, its good, but it had the possibility of being great.",1383436800,,306,5.14

4131102,4,B003JLL2Q8,It was interesting to see the problem from the view of each woman and her pain...and Baxter was Baxter-very good.,1382572800,,113,4.7
4131103,4,B003JLL2Q8,"I really liked this movie.  I chose it because it was a true story...and this is what I tend to gravitate towards.  The three well known actresses in the movie were superb, and the story itself will definitely keep your interest.  Yes...I would recommend watching this movie...especially if you like movies based on true facts, even though some of the facts just might shock you!  It certainly did not disappoint though!",1382140800,,420,4.873239436619718
4131104,4,B003JLL2Q8,I enjoyed this movie. I loved the two very strong female leads in this movie. Subject was handled very well.,1379116800,,108,4.45
4131105,5,B003JLL2Q8,Being a huge Meredith Baxter fan I really enjoyed this movie. You could almost feel her pain when she discovered her husband cheating. Loved the ending & how friensdhip won in the end. Highly recommend,1377302400,,201,4.771428571428571
4131106,4,B003JLL2Q8,So glad to find this Lifetime Original movie that premiered in the 90s. Interesting story of two best friends - played by Meredith Baxter and Swoozie Kurtz - whose friendship is tested by a daughter's - played by Clare Carey - indiscretions.,1374710400,,241,4.761904761904762

8398269,4,B003JLL2Q8,"Always a treat to watch Baxter act, and with S. Kurtz as a team, its an unbeatable entertaining worth your time to watch.  They were excellent together in this movie, worked great together for this type of topic.",1500336000,,212,4.578947368421052
8398270,3,B003JLL2Q8,"This movie is funny to watch mainly because of the lesson it teaches. Ultimately, life is terrible, the world is a cesspool, and people are rotten to the core... so just wallow in the filth and accept it! Morals and ethics are overrated and outdated, ridiculous relics from the past. We're living in ""the new country"" now! If you think cheating on your spouse is bad, you're living in a fairytale dreamworld. Cheat, lie and steal everybody... it's the modern evolution of society. LOL",1499990400,,484,4.773809523809524
8398271,5,B003JLL2Q8,A good chick movie.,1486339200,,19,4.0
8398272,5,B003JLL2Q8,Some gutsy performances here. Swoosie Kurtz's portrayal of the woman trapped earned my respect. Meredith Baxter showed depth and even the villian philander was convincing in his mea culpa moments. Holes in the story's wrapping up point to the dilemma of those caught in such impossible Thomas Hardy-like whirlpools.,1486166400,,315,5.448979591836735
8398273,5,B003JLL2Q8,Great movie. Love the actors.,1486166400,,29,5.0

8398275,4,B003JLL2Q8,"Normally don't watch these kind of movies like this one that are usually found on Lifetime, but I have to say it was pretty good. The characters were believable and it did bring out some emotion, in that you could feel the pain that the people were going through and makes one wonder what you would do in same situation. I would say it's worth watching.",1484179200,,353,4.363636363636363
8398276,4,B003JLL2Q8,Good movie; good acting.  Anything with Merideth Baxter in it is always a good movie or show.,1477612800,,93,4.470588235294118
