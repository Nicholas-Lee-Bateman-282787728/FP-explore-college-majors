For years and throughout several cases, I've blinded trusted police, defending the acts of several officers who probably shouldn't have had my support to begin with, but the obvious corruption within this case made me physically sick.

It would be truly frightening to be living in the same community as Jeremy Banks, especially when he is back as a police officer. To see the entire force not even for a second doubt his story shows the bond police forces across the nation possess. In some cases, an unbroken bond is good. But when someone dies and to talk to that officer not as a superior but as a friend in the back of a police car directly after the incident is sickening.
