214547,5,6300182029,"I first saw this movie in 1978 and was quite impressed by it.  ""Dr. Strange"" has good acting and an interesting story; definitely above average for a film based on a comic book.  I believe this film was supposed  to be the pilot for a proposed TV series, but unfortunately it wasn't  picked up by the network.",935884800,26,309,4.368421052631579

214670,5,6300182029,"This is a very cool 1970's adaptation of Dr. Strange (the Marvel character who is Master of the Mystic Arts).  I saw it when it originally came out.  It is a more or less wholesome movie (so you don't have to worry about cringe-worthy Game-of-Thrones-type-Red-Wedding scenes causing your family members to be grossed out or inundated with gratuitous foul language, just for shock value).  These were the days when writers knew that Good defeats Evil, and the hero saves the fair maiden (instead of the other way around, like today's ""superheroes"" who the writers portray as all too often needing the fair maiden, or the supporting character, to save them!).  Peter Hooten does a great job as the cool physician who is destined to become a hero.  You might also check-out Dr. Mordrid, starring the great Jeffrey Combs (a.k.a. Weyoun of Star Trek Deep Space Nine fame, who also totally triumphed in the role of the blue-skinned Andorian in several episodes of Star Trek Enterprise!).

214671,4,6300182029,"I missed this when it originally aired on TV in the 1970s (although I was a teen then).  Albeit it dated, and intended as a TV pilot, it could have worked.  I'm just trying to figure out why the screenwriters decided to change Stephen Strange to a psychiatrist vs a surgeon, and whey his mentor wasn't the Ancient One, but instead, some inner-city sorcerer who had been following Strange's career for years.",1504569600,,407,4.638888888888889

214675,4,6300182029,"Dr. Strange from the time of Bewitched. It is a fun movie with TV era graphics.
Like the 2014 Benedict Cumberbatch film, we see an awakening Dr. Strange coming into the mystic powers. Sadly, this movie like the more recent one delves into back story without letting the Doctor explore his full potential. As a TV movie that could have doubled as a series pilot this is a fun movie introducing a character. Sadly, the other Marvel hero from TV at the time does not make an appearance. Nicholas Hammond's CBS Spider-Man could have and should have made an appearance in the movie's world. Since this TV movie came before the success of the Incredible Hulk--that ultimately pulled in Daredevil and Thor--the comic book crossover did not occur in Dr. Strange's generation.
It is better than you might expect but you have to keep your graphics and pacing expectations set in their proper place.
This is much better than the TV quality Captain America movies (that had porn quality dialogue and a revisionist Captain backstory).",1501459200,,1021,4.84

214677,5,6300182029,"I remember seeing this movie on television when it was first released. Yes, I'm old; you do the math. Suffice it to say, it's stuck with me for decades, so I was delighted to find it. It's just as I remember, and I like it a whole lot better than the new version with Cumberbatch, which is one long special effect. The older film has some actual character development, and is nicely creepy in spots. The new one . . . meh. One manipulated background and hand-to-hand battle after another. I'm very glad I checked it out of the library instead of buying it. If you're going to purchase one of the two, make it the first one with Peter Hooten and Jessica Walter; rent the new one.",1500163200,,678,4.3046875
214728,5,6300182029,"I have been waiting a long time for a legitimate copy of the Dr Strange TV movie and Shout! Factory did an excellent job with this DVD. No picture or sound issues considering the age of the movie. This DVD preserves the original Full Screen format, unlike some other studios who release older TV shows in faux widescreen and cutting off parts of the picture in the process. You can always change your TV settings to display in widescreen if that is what you prefer. The product description on Amazon does not list closed captioning as an option but this DVD does have English captions available. I had a good laugh at one of the captions: (evil synthesizer music).

214732,5,6300182029,"So glad to see this TV pilot finally on DVD. It looks and sounds great! Thank you Shout Factory for remastering it! Aside from The Incredible Hulk TV series this TV effort was one of The best attempts at adapting a Marvel comics character into live action form for television in the 1970s. The special effects are cheesy but Looking at it through a 1970s lens it's pretty impressive. The cast is great! Jessica Walter steals the show camping it up as evil sorceress Morgan Le Fey.
Any Dr. Strange or Marvel fan should definitely check this out. It would've been interesting to see where this proposed series would've gone if CBS had picked it up.",1494201600,,646,4.577586206896552

214735,5,6300182029,I remember seeing this on TV when I was a kid I think I was about eight years old and I loved it. Marvel was really trying to conquer TV back in the late 1970s they had Spiderman on TV the Incredible Hulk was also on TV now that was shooting for Doctor Strange with this movie. I think a year later they would try with Captain America but that's another review. I've heard a lot of people fuss about the special effects for this movie but they have to remember this was the late 1970s not 2016. I enjoyed the movie very much if you are a fan of Marvel Comics you going to love this outing as well take it for what it is a good popcorn fun movie people seem to forget that sometimes.,1491091200,4,682,3.9854014598540144

214898,4,6300182029,"Here's the first filmed appearance of Dr. Strange, reveling in all of its late 1970s big-collared goodness ... and it holds up very well indeed, better than I remembered, both as a time capsule of the character's most successful period in comics, and as a strong, solid pilot for a TV series that should have been made, but wasn't. That's a pity, because based on this film, it would have been FUN!

Yes, as previous reviewers note, it deviates somewhat from the details of the comic, and it certainly owes more than a little to the then-recently released ""Star Wars"" -- but taken on its own terms, it works.

Things I like:

- Peter Hooten is the spitting image of Frank Brunner's classic comics interpretation, and he brings a certain humor & sexiness to the role, as well as human warmth.

- Clyde Kusatsu's Wong is portrayed as far more than just a servant in his smart three-piece suit & possession of his own magic skills.

- Jessica Walter is stunning, sexy, evil, and alluring ... if just a wee bit over the top at times, hmm?

- John Mills brings class & quiet elegance to the new character of Lindmer & makes an impressive mentor.

- The overall look & tone of the 1970s adds considerably to the film, with even the eclectic dcor of the Sanctum Sanctorum fitting in quite comfortably with the residual grooviness of the times. The zeitgeist is mellow & easy-going & herbal-tinged, with grittiness in the streets, the undercurrent of casual sexuality among adults (it was definitely the Age of Braless Cleavage, for one thing), simple but effective visual effects in garish colors, and an equally garish semi-funk guitar & synth score -- it just has That Look, That Style, and I wish there'd been more of it.

So, essentially a curio, certainly a period piece -- but what a period! :)

The Eye of Agamotto gazes favorably upon this film -- recommended!",1485388800,,1861,4.632218844984802

Watching it again I can see why it didn't make much of a splash. Frankly, the story is a lot of not much. If they had stayed truer to the source it might have stood a chance, but it was so watered down and anglicized it lost its mystery and the sense of other-worldlyness that made the comic so good. Also, the costume he wears at the end is really lame; he sort of looks like the seventh Village Person. The one he gets earlier from the villain is a lot better.

There is a lot to like here. The special effects are limited in certain ways; they resemble what a person would see on the '70s live-action Shazam! and such. However, the director and staff use imagery very well in this movie, so the film still has a cool look. Also, the script does not follow Marvel canon too closely, but the story is an acceptable adaptation of Strange Tales. Furthermore, this 1978 fantasy offering borrows blatantly from Star Wars: A New Hope, and that borrowing does or does not work for you. Finally, the production has a more mature approach than much '70s TV fare, and that touch is a nice surprise.
However, strengths acknowledged, Dr. Strange '78 has some weaknesses. The dialogue and acting get really cheesy and corny at times. And, there are some unintentionally funny scenes, including one meant to be shocking and violent.

It's presented here in its original 4:3 aspect ratio and looks & sounds good. No extras, but worth catching to see what could have been. 4 STARS

THE STORY: Stephen Strange is a staff psychiatrist working at East Side Hospital in New York. Unbeknownst to him, Strange has been watched over from a distance since childhood by a mysterious elder sorcerer named Thomas Lindmer. Now with the sudden return to our world of an ancient evil, in the form of seductively beautiful but decidedly deadly Morgan LeFay, the old magician must contact Strange and quickly initiate him in the ways of sorcery; a changing of the guards, so to speak. Reluctant at first, when Dr. Strange realizes the apocalyptic threat posed by LeFay, will he embrace his destiny to become Earth's Sorcerer Supreme?

THOUGHTS: Yeah, the final costume is hokey, (the first outfit is much better-looking), the special effects aren't so special, the acting is pure hammy 70's... but underneath it all this TV pilot had the makings of something fairly cool and unique. Unlike TV's Spider-Man and the Hulk, who just tripped up small-time crooks & creeps, Dr. Strange took on hellish demons & battled otherworldly forces of Darkness for the fate of Earth in his very first adventure! Peter Hooten was a swingin' 70's ringer for our good doctor: sincere, determined, compassionate. Clyde Kusatsu, as Wong, made for a loyal & fastidious disciple of The Ancient One, replaced here by none other than Merlin the Magician himself! (though they never say so by name), played by rascally John Mills. Villainous Morgan LeFay is brought to life by sultry Jessica Walters, in a delicious, scenery-shewing performance. Rounding out the primary cast is Anne-Marie Martin (bizarrely billed here as Eddie Benton) as Strange's presumably future girlfriend and confidant, Clea Lake. The effects, while tame by current standards, at least tried to give us a show. They are admittedly trippy, and do convey the idea that these folks are wielding some serious magical might. Special mention to the cool stop motion demon (Dormammu?) who controls Morgan LeFay and sets her loose on Lindmer & Strange. I had never seen this movie before buying this DVD and found it to be quite entertaining, in its own 1970's way. Certainly it would have been something to have had Dr. Strange go to series and eventually perhaps team up with Spider-Man, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk in a retro TV version of The Defenders. (The fevered dream of many a 10 year old, back in the day.)

THE DVD: Shout! Factory gives us a decent yet regrettably barebones standard-def release of 1978's DR. STRANGE. Picture is steady & solid, with a mostly clean image. Some fading is present, but Universal likely didn't take very good care of this particular film. Audio is strong and the soundmix is level. Zero bonus content. English subtitles for hearing impaired viewers is accessible on the main menu screen.",1480636800,2,3083,4.947876447876448

215004,5,6300182029,"Just finished watching ""Dr. Strange"" released by Universal.
Now that ""Doctor Strange"" is raking in the big bucks across the globe, the folks at Universal has thankfully decided to release the series pilot of a proposed ""Dr. Strange"" television series that first aired across the airwaves long before the advent of color-only televisions and the Internet back in 1978 - when there was only three major television networks.  [Zack, Jeff, and Berry all gasped in horror when they learned of such a time in human history.]
Morgan le Fay is tasked by her master - a dark, unnamed god - to destroy the Ancient One and open the Gateway to Earth so that he can satiate his hunger by feeding on the souls on men.
Meanwhile, back in the Earth realm, the Ancient One, otherwise known as the Sorcerer Supreme, is busily preparing himself for the upcoming battle with Morgan le Fay.  He is also searching for Stephen Strange, who is a psychiatry resident at a nearby hospital.
When the Ancient One is almost killed by Morgan le Fay, a young woman, who was used by Morgan as a pawn, is admitted to the hospital where Dr. Strange works.  He is taken in by her because they share a physic link and he's seen her terror in a dream where she is reliving the real life experience of throwing the Ancient One off a bridge and into oncoming traffic.
The  Ancient One visits Dr. Strange and informs him that he can save the young girl, if he is willing to make a dangerous journey into the higher dimensional realms.
Strange saves the  young girl, but is unwilling to become a sorcerer himself until Morgan endangers the young girl again and threatens to harm her if he doesn't come with her.
Morgan offers Stephen anything he wants.  All he has to do is take off the ring on his hand - the ring of light.
""Dr. Strange"" still holds up  very well as a pilot movie for a possible television series.  I do remember it had very high ratings when it first aired.  I suspect a combination of expensive special effects and subject matter - white versus black magic - probably prevented the network - NBC, if I'm remembering correctly - from green lighting a full series.  Keep in mind that this was before supernatural shows were mainstreamed - the exceptions being ""Bewitched."" ""I Dream of Jeanie,""  and ""Dark Shadows.""  Comedy and a vampire seeking redemption was acceptable; but still protested on the pulpit.
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1480032000,10,2415,4.629976580796253

It felt like they were so afraid of getting TOO scary or Too something else. So they ended up with a kind of ;lack luster attempt at telling a story that was too big for it's budget. Peter Holden did an acceptable job as the good doctor. But our witchy villiness was too soft and matronly to generate any seance of dread in her presence. Over all it was a nice try.

215052,2,6300182029,"Doctor Strange is fated to enter theatres at the end of 2016. But like many Marvel superheroes -- the Hulk, Captain America, Spiderman -- he was previously brought to television decades ago.

This brings us to the 1978 television movie ""Dr. Strange,"" which was intended to be the pilot for a new TV show. But while the Hulk's TV show could get away with Lou Ferrigno in green body paint, a tale of otherworldly magic requires a tightly-written plot and some excellent special effects. Instead, we get a tepid urban fantasy tale full of halfhearted Arthurian myth and an annoyingly perfect protagonist.

Morgan le Fay (Jessica Walter) is sent by a demon to overwhelm the ancient wizard Linmer (John Mills), who protects the world against supernatural threats. She does this by... possessing a girl and pushing him off a bridge. Yes, really. That's all the forces of evil can manage. While this completely fails to give Linmer more than a bruise, it does draw Morgan's attention to the girl, Clea Lake (Anne-Marie Martin), who is now apparently very magically important. For some reason.

Clea ends up in the care of Dr. Stephen Strange (Peter Hooten), a handsome and charming (well, we're told that) psychiatrist... who also treats gastrointestinal disorders and head trauma for some reason. When Linmer comes to find Clea, he recognizes Strange as the one who is destined to inherit his magical mantle -- but first they must save Clea from Morgan. Unfortunately, Morgan has decided she's now in love with Strange, and wants to seduce him to the dark side.

Fans of the Marvel universe should probably be warned that -- if Wikipedia has not steered me wrong -- there is little of the comic books' mythos in this TV movie. Instead, it's a fairly generic urban fantasy flavored with Arthurian myth (""Linmer,"" har har), a rather standard tale of an ordinary guy discovering he is the Chosen One. And while there's nothing inherently wrong with that, it does make for a rather bland story that will probably disappoint fans of the comics.

What IS wrong... is that the story is rather boring and contrived, with very little of any importance happening until the midway point of the movie. Until then... things just sort of happen without any importance to the overall plot, such as Linmer's mildly inconvenient tumble off a bridge, or Morgan popping up to stare meaningfully at things. And of course, hospital politics. Expect much infighting with nurses and doctors who just don't recognize Strange's genius.

Even worse, some plot points seem to happen just because they NEED to happen, not because they make sense. Clea was just a passing pedestrian until Morgan possessed her for a whole five seconds... and then suddenly she becomes vitally important to both Linmer and Morgan. Why? Because, that's why. After an accident, Clea becomes disoriented and acts mentally ill for several scenes, until magically recovering because... well, it's time for her to stop acting crazy.

Furthermore, the sorcery depicted in this story really highlights that the story needed a far bigger budget. Most of the magic we see is very low-budget stuff -- possessing something by staring at it, Jedi mind tricks, glowy body parts, and the actors pretending to fly through some stock psychedelic camera tricks. The most ludicrously obvious is the demon that Morgan serves, which is obviously a hand puppet. They didn't even try to hide that it can't even move except for its flapping jaw.

Another problem is that the titular Dr. Strange doesn't really have any development -- he's depicted as a brilliant and perfect bachelor doctor with no actual flaws, and so sexy that every single woman swoons over him. That includes the villain, whose entire motivation becomes ""I want to have sex with him.""

Unfortunately, Hooten doesn't have the charm or charisma you'd expect from a guy who is supposed to be catnip for woman, and he doesn't have the presence of someone who is supposed to be the Sorcerer Supreme. The latter issue is also true of Mills, who seems more like a genial grandpa than a powerful wizard, and Martin has little to do but look scared. The best performance is by the steely-eyed Walter, who is a pretty convincing Morgan, but her character goes straight off the rails when she decides that sleeping with Strange is the most important thing.

""Dr. Strange"" isn't abysmal, but it is tedious and poorly-plotted -- and the Gary Stu main character and cheap magical tricks certainly don't help the story. Hopefully the newer adaptation will have some more magic at its core.",1470960000,6,4568,4.913099870298314

- Dr. Strange (suggestively): ""How about a hot bath?""
- Clea: ""How about settling for a cold beer?""

The other day, I was rummaging thru the funk of my dank old storage unit and came across this primordial doodad they called a ""VHS tape."" On it was a recording of Dr. Strange, the backdoor pilot that aired on CBS on September 6, 1978. Man, what the hell was CBS thinking? I'm thinking the thought process back in 1978 went something like this - ""Yo, The Amazing Spider-Man is rocking it on primetime. Next year we're gonna broadcast two Captain America movies. So, guys, what we need is a bridge from Spidey to Cap. We need another superhero JUST LIKE THEM. I know! Let's do Doctor Strange!""

Unfortunately, the movie received a crap ton of viewer complaints about their children being exposed to Satanic stuff and witches on prime time. And, unfortunately, the movie went up against a rerun of Roots. So there's Dr. Strange, one and done.

If crap quality doesn't vex you, Dr. Strange is available on YouTube. See for yourself. And if you're old enough, let fond nostalgia war with your critical eye. It's odd, for years I was okay with giving this movie a pass... because it's all that we had of the live-action Sorcerer Supreme. Now that there's a Cumberbatch sighting, I say nostalgia can go jump out a window. This Dr. Strange drags, brother. Plus, they discarded so much of the source material. Stephen Strange from the comic books was a haughty, narcissistic neurosurgeon who lost the use of his hands after an auto accident. Desperate to repair his mangled hands, he scoured the world for a cure until, finally, in the Himalayas, he fell under the tutelage of the Ancient One and was inducted into the mystic arts, eventually becoming Earth's Sorcerer Supreme. That Dr. Strange was a badass.

The 1978 movie version isn't an arrogant neurosurgeon. No, he's a caring, groovy psychologist serving a residency in a New York hospital. and who casually macks on his nurses and patients (yeah, okay, it WAS the '70s). This Dr. Strange (Peter Hooten) isn't tested and reborn thru the fires of some self-defining crucible. He basically inherits his magic. The Ancient One here is some old British homie (John Mills) who, five hundred years ago, thwarted Morgan Le Fay's (Jessica Walter) try at opening a demonic portal. Today - in 1978 - Morgan's satanic master tasks her to try again. She's also ordered to kill the Ancient One, and if she can't do that, then kill his successor, the groovy psychologist with the porn 'stache. For whatever reason, she has only three days to get this done.

Clyde Kusatsu plays Wong, and his may be the closest approximation to the comics, even if he's in western clothes in this one. Clea (Anne-Marie Martin) surfaces, only she's not Strange's otherdimensional disciple but some chick that Morgan hypnotizes into harming the Ancient One.

I'll say this, it's a trippy film, what with the driving synth score and the psychedelic imagery and all the mumbo-jumbo speak about a ""higher plane."" The special effects are seriously dated. There's this one absurd sorcerous showdown between Morgan Le Fay and the Ancient One that's just ridiculous. All they do is stand in place and make lethargic hand gestures. The f/x crew lays in the magic effects, except that the visuals are so lame and the actors so lacking in commitment that there's no weight or seemingly no exertion to the spellcasting. The magic bolts and blasts seem to have no physical effect on anyone or anything, they looked so unconvincing. Not to mention, Morgan Le Fay's demonic master is rendered in this stop-motion haze. He looks like a raving orange poopsickle that's DVR'd too many Monday Night Raw episodes.

It doesn't help that it's 25 minutes into the film before Strange joins the main plot. Interspersed throughout the occult stuff are scenes of medical melodrama that wouldn't look out of place on General Hospital or Dr. Kildare, and the whole thing was so odd a gestalt I wasn't sure how to feel about it. Dr. Strange is a sloooooowww movie. It takes too long to get going. And, damningly for the fanboys, there's nary an incantation regarding hoary hosts of Hoggoth or the Eye of Agamotto or sundry crimson bands of Cyttorak. Hooten is a good-looking bloke, give him that. But there's no edge to him or the required projection of authority. Too, he talks like he's in an Italian movie being dubbed in English. I don't buy him as a master of the dark arts. I do buy him as a doctor diligently tending to his patients and, meanwhile, banging the hot nurses. And give him this, when Hooten finally dons a semblance of the classic Dr. Strange uniform, he rocks it. And kudos to foxy Jessica Walter for her awesomely over-the-top spin on Morgan Le Fay, a dark enchantress who evidently had been shortchanged on love and cuddling and lovely romantic walks. When her master chastises her for sparing Strange, she confesses, ""I am still a woman, and the man attracted me."" Respect to Morgan Le Fay!

Okay, I did like the wiggy otherworldly landscapes that tried their best to mimic Steve Ditko's surreal style.

If you can't wait for the Cumberbatch version, you should check out Dr. Mordrid, a 1992 film that was intended to be a Dr. Strange adaptation, but then the studio's license expired before production began. It's not bad at all.",1426204800,4,5379,4.762875536480687

 Peter Hooten as Stephen Strange is ok but nothing special. The story with Lindmer and evil Morgan LeFay and takeover of Earth is easy to follow but really there is no budget or great special effects to elevate the movie to the comic book level it needs to be interesting to the audience.

The first fourty minutes are nothing more than wishy washy soap opera stuff until Strange meets Lymer but even then as mentioned when Strange does battle with Lefay there are little effects to make it worthwhile until the last half of the movie. I will say it does become more enjoyable near the end as finally we see a couple of visuals in play.

And thus it was with ""Doctor Strange,"" with its cobbled-together story line and absence of the more interesting characters from the series. But if you're a die-hard fan, try to get a copy for your collection (but at a cheap price, if possible).

However, if you want to see another movie that gives you a flavor of what a real ""Doctor Strange"" movie should be like, try ""Doctor Mordrid"" from Full Moon Studios (back when they were in their horror/sci-fi days).

In every age and time, some of us are called to join the battle.
This is the story of Dr. Stephan Strange, a man in middle years who suddenly discovers the great mystery of his own life, and of all life. He comes face-to-face with the Ancient One, Master of the Hermetic Arts- Sorcerer Supreme. He is told that he has been chosen to be the next bearer of this mantle, the next champion of Light. Yet he cannot accept it. To change his mind it takes exposure to the nemesis of Light, Morgan- who is Kali, who is Lillith, who is Ishtar.... Only then does Stephen accept his destiny- and the sacrifice of the mortal pleasures of ignorance, progeny, and an easy death. The only thing he doesn't sacrifice is Love, for that is the very fabric of the Universe itself- the Universe that he now serves.
Based on the Marvel Comics series, this film will probably disappoint some purists. There is no mention of Tibet, or the accident that cost Dr. Strange the use of his hands (in the comics he was a surgeon, here he is a psychologist), and the Ancient One is a westerner (John Mills) and lives in New York. However, the spirit of the original is definitely here. I saw this on television in the late 70's and never forgot it.
