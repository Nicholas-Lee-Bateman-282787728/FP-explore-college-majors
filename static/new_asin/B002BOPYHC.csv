8646177,5,B002BOPYHC,I am a 29 year old guy who has almost no cooking foundation and really didn't know where to start.  This video was easy to understand and fun.  It gave me a basic understanding of cooking fundamentals and enough information to build on so I could explore and really have fun being creative with my dishes as I get more adventurous.  Scott has a very cool personality and made me look forward to watching and learning.  2 thumbs up!!,1251936000,5,432,4.430379746835443
