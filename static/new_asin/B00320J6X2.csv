8387323,5,B00320J6X2,"Magnificent music by two great musicians, Stochelo Rosenberg and Florin Niculescu, accompanied by the Kristiansand Symphonic Orchesta. One could say that this is the symphonic sequel to ""Live Jazz a Vienne"", a fantastic performance of Gipsy Jazz recorded live in 2002. Highly recommended.",1468800000,,288,5.72093023255814
8387324,5,B00320J6X2,It's the very best mixture between an orchestra and gypsy guitar muisicians. I've seen it many times already and sent 5 of them to family members,1359331200,2,145,4.615384615384615
8387325,4,B00320J6X2,"Stochelo Rosenberg, as most will already know, is one of the top soloists in the style of music, inspired by Django Reinhardt, that is sometimes called ""Gypsy Jazz"" (also called ""Jazz Manouche"" or ""Jazz Tzigane""). Florin Nicolescu, likewise, is a violin star within this genre. They are the featured soloists with the Kristiansand Symphonic Orchestra in a 2007 concert hall performance. The program is almost entirely made up of Django Reinhardt's own compositions. Jon Larson, the lead guitarist of the Hot Club of Norway (another group inspired by the music of Django), plays rhythm guitar here, as does Per Einar Watle. Svein Aarbostad plays swing bass, and completes the classic Django-style all-strings combo that plays alongside the orchestra. (In front of both the orchestra and conductor, actually). The quality of the filming and sound recording is excellent.

The orchestra arrangements are by Per Ekdahl, and are classic ""with strings""-type charts that jazz soloists from Charlie Parker on have used to give their music a new texture. Django himself recorded at least one piece (""Troublant Bolero"" with l'Orchestre Symphonique National, 1951) in this style. Rosenberg plays with his usual fire and astonishing technique, though because of the setting and impressionistic repertoire, he shows restraint where appropriate. There is a nice mix of ballad and up-tempo material. There are a couple of early entrances by the soloists here and there, and they both shine a bit more in small-group settings, but overall the project is a success and adds something new, yet still very much in the tradition, to the contemporary Jazz Manouche scene. The concert portion of the DVD lasts one hour.

The songs played are:

1. Djangology (written ca. 1935)
2. Nuages (ca. 1939)
3. Diminushing Blackness (ca. 1947, also titled simply ""Diminushing"")
4. Douce Ambiance (ca. 1943)
5. Melodie au Crepuscule (ca. 1943)
6. Place de Broukere (ca. 1943)
7. Listen (solo guitar improvisation by Stochelo Rosenberg)
8. Tears (based on folk song ""Muri wachsella an u sennelo weesh"", Django's arrangement ca. 1937)
9. Nuits de St-Germain-des-pres (ca. 1952, originally in bebop style)
10. Manoir de mes Rves (ca. 1943)
11. Belleville (ca. 1942)

Bonus Features:

Interview with Alain Antonietto in his Paris apartment: Antonietto knows as much or more about jazz tzigane (""Gypsy Jazz,"" i.e. the music inspired by Django Reinhardt) as any person living or dead, and for 20 or so minutes we get to see him discuss the music and, most interestingly, his connections to the relatives of Django Reinhardt. He also discusses a few of the many stringed instruments hanging on his walls, including a 1940s Busato (similar to the more famous Selmer-Maccaferri style guitars played by Django) that was owned and played by Django in his final years and then given to Antonietto by Django's sister following Django's death.

Also included as bonus material are interviews with the two principle soloists of the concert, Stochelo Rosenberg and Florin Nicolescu. Rosenberg is himself a Roma (Gypsy) from the Manouche ethnic group (as was Django), and he discusses his childhood, career, and other topics (English, heavily accented, with English sub-titles to assist viewers). Nicolescu, a Romanian native (and also a Roma), discusses his musical philosophy (in French with English subtitles).

This DVD makes an excellent companion to ""Bireli Lagrene & Friends- Live Jazz A Vienne"" for people who want to explore the range of music created and inspired by Django. There are certainly other worthwhile concert videos documenting this style of music (the Django in New York festival has produced some valuable live videos, as well as Djangofest Northwest), but these two are probably the best choices for those not already deeply involved with the music of Django Reinhardt and the contemporary jazz manouche / jazz tzigane scene.",1300406400,6,3899,5.258842443729904
