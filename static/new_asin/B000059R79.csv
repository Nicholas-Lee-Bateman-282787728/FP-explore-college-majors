7933939,1,B000059R79,"Not the music but the region.  I ordered a second Candy Dulfer album (this one), thinking that because it was sent out by Amazon, then it would be playable.  The problem was the Region.  I live in California (part of region 1, United States and Canada).  In the usual Product Details listing, it said Region 1, but when I attempted to play the DVD on my machines, it said it could not open because I was in the wrong region.  All I could do was to throw it away.  I really wanted to see her play live in Amsterdam.  Oh Well.",1409875200,2,524,4.128712871287129
7933940,5,B000059R79,"This is a stunning live performance with the 2006 Amsterdam audience going mad and demanding encore for encore. It must have been a powerful event. The audience is well recorded, too, bringing their good moods right into your room! The result is amazing! Not many live recordings bring about such.
This is musically one of the ten best captures of a live event that I have ever heard, and I did not know that it exists until yesterday, when I accidentally stumbeled over this musical gem in a public library. Now I am searching for a way to purchase a CD copy of it. Its overall sound is full and rich, with sound bass lines. Nile Roger's clean Stratocaster and the two female singers are clearly positioned in a realistic row next to each other on the virtual acoustic stage floor (a good stereo system provided).

If you should find this on CD: Take your chance. 74 minutes of sizzling music energy, funky rhythms, fiesta moods and vibrant musicianship are waiting for you.",1233360000,,975,4.635838150289017
7933941,3,B000059R79,"OK I got one, and returned it for a second one. Both Froze & Skipped. Anyway I only kept it because I love Chic. This one is the same as the ""LeFreak Live"" DVD which I bought locally. And it actually played in my DVD player. Earlier reviews said the LeFreak one features Bernard Edwards. The one I really want is the one from Budakan. the concert that was done days before Bernard died. I would kill for a copy of that one...to see the real masters of Chic. I did download the audio of that concert from iTunes and it was brilliant. Bernard we miss you!!",1173744000,,554,4.186915887850467
7933942,3,B000059R79,"Good concert but the DVD is not produced in the U.S. and in this case it will not play on all DVD players.  I had to order two and neither one played without skipping and jumping.  Ordered from two different dealers with same results.  It's a coin toss if it will play or not.  Besides that, I love Chic and if you luck out will love this concert.",1173312000,2,347,4.0588235294117645
