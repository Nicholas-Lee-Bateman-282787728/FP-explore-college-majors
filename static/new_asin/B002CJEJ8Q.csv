This one is extremely informative, covering topics such as why fire hydrants are different colors, why is there a pole in a fire station, and what firefighters wear. There is lots of great video from the Seattle Fire Dept. along with the fun animation of Billy and his dog. Highly recommend.",1386720000,,362,4.671875
8364050,5,B002CJEJ8Q,"Our 2-year-old son LOVES this movie. We checked it out from the library three times and finally decided that we needed our own copy. My husband and I even learned quite a bit from it. Billy Blue Hair is a bit cheesy, but overall it's a great movie and one that we are completely fine with our son watching again and again.",1298073600,,322,4.209677419354839
