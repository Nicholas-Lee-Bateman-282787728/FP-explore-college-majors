7484765,3,B0170K341O,That other review seems vicious. The movie was good enough to watch. Reminds me of H. P. Lovecraft. I love most horror so I couldn't go wrong with this.,1447200000,13,152,4.275862068965517
7484766,1,B0170K341O,"If you like bad movies, add this to your collection.  Onne minute consisted of a gross-out opening sequence that I'm assuming was supposed to make the following 5 more endurable since they at first seemed unrelated and thus might make a viewer want to endure some hack writing/acting in order to satisfy the obsessive curiosity...as in ""gee, I wonder how this is related to the scene preceding it!""  I don't understand how someone could want to know such a thing badly enough to waste an hour of his/her life.  This film is a hack job.  The primary actor, who I'm assuming was guided by the director, the man in charge of turning the screenplay into a motion picture, portrays a jobless sculptor who is getting nowhere with his ability to make worthwhile art.  His creations barely pass as art.  He's approximately 30 years old, or at least appears to be.  The whole vibe of the first few minutes with this character give me the impression that if you don't hate this movie, then you're expected to relish in the opportunity to scoff at the character's pompousness.  I was annoyed with the character, but even more so with the way the character was so obviously a cardboard cut out that the writer inserted seemingly for the purpose of being hated/ridiculed.  And if the cover has any bearing on the rest of the film, you may expect there to be a lesson to be ""learned"" from it -- if you enlarge the Amazon product photo, you'll see it says ""be careful what you wish for"".  Oh, how profound!  It's good advice, and may or may not have something to do with the movie...there may even be so much more to the story that you can barely swallow it.  If that is the case then so what?  You can get bucketloads of heavy duty wisdom from all kinds of sources.  As for the scare factor, there may have been some relationship to the bonechilling cover-art and the film itself, but I was too annoyed with the character and underwhelmed with the cinematography, set design and lighting etc. etc. to bother watching further.  If you really need to know what a guy pulling a plug out of his bellybutton and thus bleeding to death has to do with an artist struggling to come across as talented, then you've GOT to see this film!!",1447200000,,2214,4.513784461152882
7484777,4,B0170K341O,The movie although done very well reminds me of videodrome from back in the 80's. same concept with the surrealistic entity that cannot be explained being accepted and then of course kills.

7484779,3,B0170K341O,"The hole was the best character in the movie. She gets 4-5 stars. Otherwise, it's a one star movie. I found the ""main character"" to be a caricature of all the worst artist stereotypes. He was selfish, obsessive, self-involved, condensing, and arrogant. The other human characters were not much better. There were too many unanswered questions and gaping holes in the plot. No pun intended. The movie felt painfully long. Too much time was spent on his ""art"" and too little on the only interesting thing in the movie. The hole. The relationship between the main character and the hole was somewhat interesting, but my annoyance with everything about the guy was really hard to get past. Also, the ending sucks.

7484863,2,B0170K341O,"My discussion, analysis, and questions will spoil the plot for some, so it's best to read it after you have seen the film.

I wanted to like this and at first I did.  The plot is original.  You feel some empathy for the protagonist as he as not successful at his passion in life.  It is clear that his uncle has some dealings with the creature in the wall and had a hand in his success.  In the beginning it shows a nightmare he is having of pulling a chain from  his abdomen and with it comes his internal organs.

What I'm not clear on is what influence did this creature have on any of them?  After spending time conversing with this hole in the wall or weird sexual stuff through the wall, she would spit out a small item wrapped in a slimy skin.  When inserted in his crazy, weird, ugly mobiles they were suddenly awe inspiring.  I thought they were still terrible.  Did these slimy items change people's perception of his art?  He even told his boss/girlfried the art director that she does the artwork, but this is still not entirely true.  He creates it and she adds a small touch.

The gallery director who origiinally showed no interest in him or his work signed him on for feature shows. It's clear that she did not care for him and was just seeing the dollar signs.  Why did she want to get romantically with him?  She was his ticket for marketing his success and she already had him.  This seemed unnecessary and in contradiction with her character, as she loathed him.

The film never went into the origin or motives or even the appearance of this woman/creature/thing in the wall.  It was clear that she was lonely and she could not leave.  The film also ends abruptly with no conclusion or resolution and just leaves the viewer saying ""that's it?""  The film poster depicts her as a hideous monster, but there is very little revealed about her character or  her appearance.  Does  he continue with his art career or move out after she inured/kills those who seemed a threat to him or her?  Did he stay in the apartment and continue to make art?

Lol, look at one of his mobiles.  They contain empty boxes of birth control pills hanging from mobile strings.  What in the world was this guy thinking?",1466121600,,2213,4.424317617866005

A little different when it comes to Horror.
It was a decent movie worth the watch for those trying to find any horror movie that might be good with gore.

However, it wasn't long before the weirdness level increased and i was hooked in the hopes of putting a face on the sexy voice emanating from the hole in the wall. Of one thing i was sure, it definitely wouldn't be human.
 The acting was good, as was the cinematography. I don't know what some of the fuss about sex and killing is about. The sex is less graphic than many music videos and only one person gets killed; and killed mildly at that, compared to most films in the genre.
 I agree with others who have said, this film is not for everyone; but name one film that is.
 I usually avoid discussing symbolism and metaphor, but since others tagged the voice in the hole as demonic and malevolent, i'll beg to disagree.
  To me, the voice is the lure of recognition and appreciation that pulls at everyone who puts their heart and soul into something they perceive as truly beautiful; monetary gain not included.
  We  crave recognition, case in point, how many selfies have you taken? How many facebook posts about the Lo Mein you just scarfed? How many reviews have you written?...:)

I was pleasantly surprised to learn this is a dark fantasy about a failed artist who questions what lengths he is willing to go to in order to be successful. Granted, there are horror elements (executed extremely well), but the movie's focus is on developing Hermann's character amid paranormal goings-on.

The studio apartment in this film brings a new meaning to ""hole in the wall."" And when that hole in the wall speaks, Hermann complies, knowing his newfound success can be stripped from him as quickly as he attained it. The character of the hole is nuanced and complex (impressive for a character who's just a voiceover), and we are led to wonder who in this film really is the monster, and who is the good guy at heart.

He also has his enemies in the art world who gain popularity in the art world after doing something ""unexpected"" and different. After his mum convinces him to speak to his artistic uncle (by artistic I mean not at all) for advice he ends up staying at a run-down apartment he rents out. In this apartment he comes across this thing that speaks to him through the wall that helps him succeed in the art world.

Now, correct me if I am wrong, this movie is about a tortured, depressed artist at his wit's end, ready to end his suffering. At least, that was his mindset in the beginning.
However, he finds help and hope in the least likely of places- a glory hole. The entity on the other side of this perverted creation promises to give the artist everything he desires, but needs to murder people to do so. Kind of like how a lonely man, in his most desperate state, would willingly call a sex line, just to relieve some pressure.

Is it just me or does anyone else see the parallel between this fictional story and the common fear of commitment found amongst the males of our species? I mean, a guy who prefers his sexual conquests to be solely about satisfying his libido (a nicer way of saying ""a faceless hole"") than actually having to invest emotion or respect for his latest catch, would most likely view monogamy in the same way that we see murder. It means the death of his ""perfect"" life, piece by piece, as he cringes against his powerlessness to abate the expanding terror.

So, in essence, this shouldn't be listed as a supernatural horror film. It would be far more at home listed in the ""Metaphorical interpretation of a common phobia"", right?",1454025600,,1411,4.5078125
