8075216,1,B000A6T2IU,"I don't know who filmed this dvd, but they did a poor job. They didn't know how to capture everyone in the front view. Throughout the front view, you are either seeing the instructor and the three ladies in the back of her or you are mostly seeing the lady in blue. For some reason, the camera focus on this lady instead of showing you what the instructor is doing. Of course, the lady is doing what the instructor is doing, but she's not the instructor.

The camera shows sideviews as well and in them, you may see everyone or just the people in the back. Both shots are a no no. How do they expect people to follow an instructor and see if they are doing the exercise right, if the instructor isn't facing them.

You have more than one instructor. The instructors switch out during the exercises. They don't cue, they just jump into exercises and expect you to follow them.

I have wasted my money on this dvd. I wish that Amazon would show people a clip of every exercise dvd. It would help people from wasting their money on low budget exercise dvds.",1287964800,,1054,4.340101522842639
