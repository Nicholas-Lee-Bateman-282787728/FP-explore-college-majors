8537799,4,B0099116Z4,Great film and great performance. The film is very good and the beauty and Samantha Eggar's performance is excellent. I read the book many years before and I think is wonderful but I can say the film is at the same level. The Quality of the DVD is very good although the film is so old.,1439683200,,286,4.125
8537800,5,B0099116Z4,"It would be easy to overlook David Hemmings work here because between he and Samantha Eggar she has the more demanding role.  Consider that Eggar has to juggle the demands of a character who is not only crippled physically but emotionally as well and she hits it out of the park.  Curiously she was not nominated for an Oscar for her efforts.  That said if one were not to accept Hemmings' character, if you can accept a character who is essentially a parasitic manipulator, then the film doesn't work.  If one doesn't leave the film ambiguous to Hemmings Leigh's intentions towards Eggar's Deborah then the film is not the success I think it is.  Director Eric Till directs the film at a deliberate pace letting the relationship between Leigh and Deborah to develop and allowing the audience to make their own judgments.  A splendid film undeserving of its relative obscurity.  On a curious note the score that Stanley Myers employs here seems to have been recycled later in the decade for ""The Deer Hunter"".",1439596800,,1009,4.764367816091954
8537801,4,B0099116Z4,"An interesting psychological suspense story.  Good performances from David Hemmings and, especially, Samantha Eggar.  Set in the early seventies",1414972800,2,144,6.526315789473684
8537802,5,B0099116Z4,"The movie ""The Walking Stick""  is an intriguing story where a beautiful young women stricken with polio who is employed by a prestigious  antique auction house, is coerced into participating in a robbery.  Deborah Dainton is a crippled woman played by Samantha Eggar whose main purpose in life is her job, until a young man named Leigh Hartley played by David Hemmings comes into her life.  Leigh proceeds to charm Deborah off her feet and she is happy for the first time,  Leigh tricks her into getting involved in a robbery of the business where she works.  She then discovers that Leigh has been lying to her all through the romance. The acting is excellent with Samantha  Eggar giving an especially skilled performance.  The movie is well worth watching.",1377648000,3,758,4.821705426356589
8537803,5,B0099116Z4,"This is a wonderful movie, although if you have read the book, you will have to put it out of your mind when you see the film. Thematically, the movie is not on very firm ground, relative to the book. However, Samantha Eggar is just great, and I wouldn't change the film because she is so good in it.

I really just wanted to write a review because this is an on-demand film, burned to order. The quality is fantastic. I was concerned at spending the asking price for burn-on-demand, but I couldn't ask for better. I played it on an HDTV, and it was film-quality. I don't know what technique was used to make the print, but it justifies the price.",1356220800,6,647,4.30327868852459
8537804,5,B0099116Z4,"It was a stellar year for film as this film, ""The Walking Stick"" was released in 1969 or 1970 and the list of stunning films goes on almost as memorable as 1939. The difference was many of these films became classics without being good films.  Films were looked at as art. It was quite a time for Samantha Eggar as well as she did ""The Molly Maguires"" opposite Sean Connery prior and followed this with one of her better performances as the heroine of the movie version of Sebastien Japrisot's book, ""The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun"" opposite Oliver Reed (who she later starred opposite in 1979 in a comeback in David Croenberg's ""The Brood"").  Her co-star in ""The Walking Stick"" is David Hemmings who was having surprising success in films as a leading man after Antonioni's ""Blow-Up"" considering his looks and build and their chemistry together is quite good.  Written by George Bluestone, the film is based on a rather good Winston Graham novel (Graham was responsible for a number of fabulous suspense novels (and the ""Poldark"" saga) perhaps the most famous being ""Marnie,"" the book on which Alfred Hitchcock based his film) and we can actually see a lot of the more suspenseful moments included in ""Marnie"" (the waiting behind in the toilet stall to commit a robbery) showing up in this later story and Eggar's participation in the robbery in ""The Walking Stick"" is pulse-poundingly effective.  Here Samantha Eggar gives another beautiful restrained performance which restores our faith in her as the award-winning actress of ""The Collector.""  We feel for her character throughout, despite her mistakes.  The director, Eric Till, gives a detached hand to the proceedings with the film somehow seeming to not connect with the viewer, but then some of its impartiality telling the film in a very assured manner.  A relative newcomer, Till had previously made the 1968 film ""Hot Millions"" starring Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith.  Also in the cast of ""The Walking Stick"" are Emlyn Williams, Phyllis Calvert, Ferdy Mayne, Dudley Sutton, Francesca Annis and Gwen Cherrell.  The score by Stanley Myers sounds identical to his score nearly ten years later for ""The Deer Hunter.""  Featuring a trailer, this Warner Archive product was made in Metrocolor and Panavision by MGM and presented in Widescreen.",1349395200,8,2311,4.963730569948186
