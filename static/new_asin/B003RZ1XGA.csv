8403935,4,B003RZ1XGA,"One of my favorite screen adaptations, ""Nightbreed"" is classic horror before CGI but with colorful characters and imagery.
""Cabal"" is simply the book title substituted for the Italian release of the film. I purchased this thinking it was Clive Barker's super-rare cut.  Although, I am pleased because it is the best quality DVD of the film so far pertaining to sound and video, much better than the Warner Bros. release. It was great to revisit this cult classic!",1382918400,6,463,4.935897435897436
8403936,4,B003RZ1XGA,"I suspected that this was the movie Nightbreed, released foreign under another name, but I couldn't verify this online. Anyway, it is. Video quality is what you expect from a good DVD. Mine arrived damaged, so I'm waiting on a replacement. Looking forward to owning this again.

Note: Because it's European, its in the PAL format. You will most likely have to watch it in your computer and convert it to NTSC format if you are in North America.",1370736000,6,444,4.620253164556962
