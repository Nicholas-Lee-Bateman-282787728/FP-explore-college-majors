2530438,4,B000EQHX7I,"I am a teacher and I saw the movie ""Pilgrims Progress"" many years ago and it had a great impact on my life. When searching for the original movie I came across Christiana. Even though it is an old movie I wanted to show it to my children to inspire them to want to take the road to salvation and make it into the Kingdom of Heaven.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilgrim-s-Progress/dp/B000EQHX78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilgrim's Progress</a>",1260144000,6,483,5.816901408450704
2530439,5,B000EQHX7I,Great compliment to the Pilgrim's Progress DVD.  Both for the one with Liam Neeson and the 2008 Pilgrim's Progress set in modern times.,1456444800,,135,4.869565217391305
2530440,2,B000EQHX7I,At one time (years ago) this might have been an ok movie.  But after studying the book that Bunyan wrote I see that the movie has left out valuable  material and has taken liberty to misrepresent some of the original book. It does get the point across that Jesus is the only way to be saved but is very mushy.  If you are interested In The Pilgrim's Progress; Book 2 Christiana's Story read the original book by John Bunyan or the amplified version by Jim Pappas Jr. This is a good story and I recommend it for the whole family. p.s. I do like Liam Neeson.,1437523200,,556,4.226415094339623

2530442,3,B000EQHX7I,"The Pilgrim's Progress ""BOOK"" is probably what I consider one of the BEST books that I have ever read outside of the BIBLE itself.  However, when we purchased this DVD set, it didn't have the same kind of pizazz that the book had.  The narration was sluggish and the children did not find much interest to hold their attention.  It didn't hold mine very well either.  I was hoping that it would be like the film that we saw a few years back as a church rental movie.  Unfortunately, it was not.  It was OK, and I'm sure that there are others who might find it to be what they were looking for, but it didn't meat our needs.",1436745600,,623,4.19327731092437

2530448,1,B000EQHX7I,"This was awful.  After reading other reviews I was looking forward to seeing this.  I love Bunyan's book and this did not come close to doing it justice.  I love older films, so it wasn't about cinematography.  It was just a poor telling of a classic book of the journey to faith.",1409961600,,280,4.326923076923077
8113440,3,B000EQHX7I,"This DVD was a bit disappointing in that it lacked a lot of action, and there were times when the main character just stood still and did nothing.  Also, we did not see any of the characters cross the Dark River.  The ending seemed abrupt and could have been so much better, I felt.",1522627200,,282,4.203703703703703

8113447,4,B000EQHX7I,"I liked the movie for what it is, but I liked the book better.  This is the second part of Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyon.  The movie does not follow the book very well, but the storyline was good and the acting was great, especially the one who played Mercy.",1477612800,,262,4.22
8113448,5,B000EQHX7I,"Liam Neeson in his early years.  The film production is very primitive.  You have to be open minded enough to look past the corny special effects and take in the message of the film to enjoy it.  The message of the cross of Christ is powerful in this film.  The supporting actors are not bad, it is just a humble production of the most important message ever sent to the world, the Gospel of Jesus Christ.",1474848000,,405,4.2894736842105265
8113449,5,B000EQHX7I,"Love this movie! It's about the wife of Christian, named,"" Christiana,"" of the Pilgrims Progress.  Christina is following her husband, Christian, going on a pilgrimage away from the city of ""Destruction,""  on a difficult and sometimes dangerous journey towards the Celestrial City.  This movie, based on a book written by John Bunyon is really a morality play with all sorts of symbolism, both  beautiful and frightening.",1470787200,,421,5.333333333333333
