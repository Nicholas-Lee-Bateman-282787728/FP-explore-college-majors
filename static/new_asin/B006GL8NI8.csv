8497656,1,B006GL8NI8,At least 3 of these movies are camcorder horror. Many people don't like horror movies filmed on a camcorder so I had to warn them. I'm not gonna bother describing these horror movies because I was disappointed with all of them. I'll just advise you to check out the trailers for these movies on youtube and read the comments. Then go to imdb.com and see what reviews and message board posts are saying about these movies. If the comments from others who have seen these flicks isn't reassuring then don't bother wasting your money on this garbage.,1376438400,,547,4.649484536082475

They might not be the highest rated movies, but they were economical to purchase and they were entertaining  They were well packaged and arrived fast.",1374883200,,267,4.933333333333334
