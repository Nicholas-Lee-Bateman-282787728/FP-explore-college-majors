8341575,4,B001TIQTMA,"The ""Tagged Classic"" series are old WWE PPV events that they package together & release as a set together for those who didn't catch them back when they originally were released. And to answer the big question surrounding every release of a PPV since July 2007 is that Chris Benoit has not been edited out of the events. These are just re-releases of the original PPV DVD events.

Judgment Day '04 was SmackDown's first post-WrestleMania PPV & also their first PPV since the WWE Draft a month earlier...and as a personal note, I was at this PPV live.  SmackDown went though heavy changes leading up to this PPV as Kurt Angle was out injured and put into the position of General Manager of SmackDown.  Also, ex-APA member Bradshaw had a heavy makeover that transformed him into the person we know today as John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield and catapulted into the main event scene here against WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero.  They had a match that would make a star overnight as if you didn't have respect for J.B.L. as a main eventer before, you would here as he held his own against Eddie that would result in one of the bloodiest scenes in WWE history to the point where Eddie lost around 1 quart of blood.  Other standout matches include Undertaker vs. Booker T, RVD/Mysterio vs. Dudley Boyz, and John Cena vs. Rene Dupree.  The rest of the card was so bad & boring that I actually fell asleep during the midcard...Chavo Guerrero with one hand tied behind his back vs. Crusierweight Champion Jacqueline (you read that right), Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie, the FLAT debut of Mordecai (the future Kevin Thorn) vs. Scotty 2 Hotty, and WWE Tag Team Champions Rico & Charlie Hass vs. Billy Gunn & Hardcore Holly.  I don't remember all the DVD extras but I know they had the segments from the previous weeks SmackDown involving Booker T visiting a psychic & a graveyard; J.B.L. giving Eddie Guerrero's mom a heartattack, another J.B.L. promo with him kicking illegal immigrants out of Texas & back across the border; and a match from Heat.

While Judgment Day showed that SmackDown was clearly in trouble during the spring, RAW was heavily superior leading into the Bad Blood match.  The feud between Triple H & Shawn Michaels would come to a final conclusion here as they met in a Hell In A Cell match that went close to an hour that didn't depend on someone going outside the cell, falling off the cage, or beating each other down with weapons the whole time to make it memorable...just those two beating each other down so badly that even you as the viewer is exausted at the end of it.  This PPV also featured Chris Benoit pulling double duty as he & Edge had a rematch for the World Tag Team Titles vs. La Resistance and Benoit later defending his World Championship against Kane in one of the best matches in Kane's career.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin, Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko, Womens Championship: Victoria vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus, and Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman.

In the end, Judgment Day was one of those cards where half the matches were good while the other half was crap as the opening match was good but then you have to skip the middle of the PPV all the way to the final 3 matches.  Meanwhile Bad Blood really only had one dud (Eugene/Coachman) and was a solid PPV from top to bottom which is what made me rate this package 4 stars instead of 3 or lower.  But in the end, both packaged together at a cheap price is something I'm going to recommend.

As a side note for those looking for certain matches on other sets:

8341576,3,B001TIQTMA,"I just reviewed the TAGGED CLASSICS combo that occurs before this one.  In the NO WAY OUT / BACKLASH set, we get to see champions Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit at the height of their careers.  But in this set --- featuring JUDGMENT DAY from ""SmackDown"" and BAD BLOOD from ""RAW"" --- we get to see our champions in increasingly gruel situations.  While our champions are in desperate times, so is the WWE's product.

*****JUDGMENT DAY 2004*****
This night showcases a very strange time for ""SmackDown"".  After the brands' draft, some puzzling situations occured.  Kurt Angle's injury forced him to become the GM of ""SmackDown"", some pearl-white apocalyptic guy named Mordecai was to debut on this night, the Cruiserweight champion was a woman (not that there's anything wrong with that), one of the Tag Team champs is incredibly feminine, Undertaker continued his ""Dead Man"" antics....and Bradshaw became a Wall Street New Yorker?!  Try to take all that in for a moment, and you've got a PPV that's more weird than good.

The opening match pits 4 former ECW talent in tag team action: The Dudley Boyz versus Rob Van Dam & Rey Mysterio.  The action is filled with exciting spots and solid teamwork from both sides.  Just an all-around strong way to start a PPV.  Too bad it wasn't for the tag titles.  After this opener, Kurt Angle not only rips in the Los Angeles crowd & Eddie Guerrero, but he stipulates that if Torrie Wilson loses to Dawn Marie in the next match she'll be fired.  All I'll say is too bad Torrie lose, and too bad that these ladies didn't do as well as I've seen them do.  I still think their ROYAL RUMBLE 2003 was a decent match.  Never mind, let's move on.

So, we get to see our cross-bearing scary-looking self-righteous Mordecai debut against Scotty 2 Hotty.  Well, he had a cool entrance, and he had a decent opponent, but the match was just a boring hodge-podge.  Mordecai eventually returned to WWE as ""Kevin Thorn"", in a decent vampirism gimmick.  That factoid is more interesting than this whole fiasco.  The match afterwards is a decent tag team match between (get this) Billy Gunn & Hardcore Holly against Rico & Charlie Haas, the latter being the WWE Tag Team champs.  The match is pretty funny at times, when Rico is so flamboyant that no wrestler wants to mix it up with him.  These four men have talent, and while I kinda enjoyed this showdown, there's nothing that I'd put on a PPV.

This is the second ""SmackDown"" PPV in a row to deliver an intergender match with the male being handicapped in some way.  Chavo Guerrero challenges Jacqueline to regain his Cruiserweight Title, with one arm tied behind his back.  Like the Noble/Nidia Blindfold Match at NO WAY OUT, if you're into seeing a woman humiliate a man, then this might entertain you.  I actually got into it, because Jacqueline has always been a formidable female competitor.  Plus, Chavo Sr. was always a funny presence at ringside.

We finally get another legitmately good match when Rene Dupree goes after John Cena's US Title.  This is definitely a match that belongs in both men's Best-Of category, because Dupree and Cena just clicked.  The match was very fast-paced when it started, enjoyable when it slowed down, and breath-taking when it got to the final minutes.  Dupree was certainly singles title material (IMO), and Cena once again proves that even if his offense today is limited, he has the 'ability' to perform in technical matches as well as old-fashioned slugfests.  Easily my favorite match of the PPV!

I've often enjoyed watching Booker T and Undertaker work together, but I've yet to see a classic showcase between the two.  There's always something a little off when they mix it up, mainly because Booker's has the most bizarre flexibility.  Well...now that I got that rant out of system, what's also odd is that Booker keeps going for a bag of dirt to use against Undertaker.  In any event, this match is par for the course: enjoyable, but not must-see.

The main event between Eddie Guerrero and JBL is a must-see, but for most unusual reasons.  The match itself is solid, and I'd have been satisfied to pay PPV money to see it.  Guerrero dominates the early part of the match, with JBL getting the upper hand to pummel Eddie later in the match.  But, that's not why the main event is must-see.  It comes to down to JBL's pre-match promo (which I've read almost caused an old school RIOT!), and what has got to be the sickest chairshot leading to the most blood lost in a single match.  Eddie Guerrero --- either by blading or a legit smack from a chair --- bled gallons of blood for what had to be 10 minutes!!!  It has to be seen to be believed!  Don't get me wrong, JBL & Guerrero had a very good one-on-one match going in, but that single chairshot and Guerrero's pure guts will awe anybody who watches it.  Guaranteed!

JUDGMENT DAY 2004 is a passable event.  It's not bad, but not particularly good.  Even with three very good matches on it, the rest is uninspiring.  This PPV is ultimately why I won't give this combo 4 stars.  But read on for why I almost did anyway:
___________________________________________________

*****BAD BLOOD 2004*****
The 3rd and final PPV with the name BAD BLOOD is the 3rd and final time a Hell-In-A-Cell Match made its way to this event.  Also, our World Heavyweight champion has to defend two titles in one single night.  Unlike JUDGMENT DAY, this June event from ""RAW"" gets it mostly right from start to finish.

The show predictably and wisely begins with Chris Benoit teaming with Edge to defend the World Tag Team Titles against La Resistance.  Aside from the formulaic French-Canadian gimmick, Sylvan Grenier & Rob Conway made a good team in my opinion.  What's interesting to me is rather than just pushing the storyline of Kane's inevitable involvement, these four men were allowed to have a nice back-and-forth match that gave La Resistance a chance to show their stuff some more.  Other than some patience-testing with Edge being double teamed for a long time, this was the right way to kick off BAD BLOOD 2004.

Chris Jericho unforuntately was still stuck in his rivalry with Trish Stratus, leading to his PPV match against newcomer Tyson Tomko.  Tomko has improved considerably in TNA, but in 2004 he was just a body.  Anyway, these two did alright, but I expected more from a Y2J match.  What did meet my expectations was Randy Orton's IC Title defense against Shelton Benjamin.  After cutting a promo so awesome that the script had Orton start it backstage and finish it in the ring, Shelton came out to start their advertised contest.  Just as fans of either wrestler expect, the two engage in a remarkable showdown that's worthy of the title's lineage.  Shelton can physically do anything, and Orton can play the villain better than most.  Throw in Ric Flair's hilarious manager interference, and you've got a PPV quality presentation.

Next is a Fatal Fourway for the Women's Title.  Lita was making a return to the ring, Trish Stratus already made her presence known on the PPV, Victoria was the champion, and Gail Kim...was just there.  What I like about this match is how talented these ladies are, and how botch-free this one is compared to most Divas matches.  What sucks big time is how short it is.  I think it lasted only 6 minutes.  These four women deserved much better than this.  Entertaining, but leaves a bitter aftertaste.

Okay, so next up is one of the strangest matches you'll ever see.  Jonathan Coachman (sigh) faces the mentally-challenged Eugene.  This whole match includes both men running into opposite ropes for almost a minute, an unnamed bikini-clad woman with a tray of cookies, a teddy bear, and Eugene emulating Junkyard Dog & The Rock.  You get all of that?  In the end, this was an amusing bit of comedy the first time around, but repeated viewings haven't been good to it.

Now that we got past that one, you wanna see one of Kane's best matches?  Here you go: Chris Benoit competes for the 2nd time at BAD BLOOD to defend his World Heavyweight Championship against ""The Big Red Machine"".  Any doubts that Kane isn't championship material are to be quelled after watching this.  Any doubts that Benoit could get a good match out of anybody are to be silenced as well.  I don't quite get Benoit's post-match promo, but then again, Kane beat the crap out of him.  The two just hit all the right notes.  Submission holds, stiff slugfests, high impact slams, finisher counters, injury psychology, and a unique pinfall finish.  I thought this match COULD be good, but didn't think it WOULD be as awesome as this!

Our main event concludes the long-running on-and-off rivalry between Shawn Michaels and Triple H.  What better way to do it than Hell-In-A-Cell, right?  Two words for you: 47 Minutes.  That's right, HBK & HHH patiently start the match with slugfests & submission holds, and slowly work their way towards the violent weapons spots & bloodshed we crave in matches like this.  The best Cell Matches know how to start slow, and how to make the carnage not phony.  This HBK/HHH Cell Match succeeds at both very well.  What's strange about this main event is how it goes for broke, and sticks to its storytelling from start to finish.  In a way, it's great and also a bit excessive.  The last five minutes aren't as epic as the wrestlers & WWE crew hoped it would be.  Frankly, waiting forever for a weakened wrestler to deliver a finisher and a pinfall attempt that results in a two count isn't fun.  I accepted it because as fellow reviewer Ervin Griffin pointed out, ""We become exhausted along with them.""  But this one got too real for its own good in its final stretch.  Don't get me wrong, I love this match and love this feud.  But just be aware that you might get impatient when the 3 count is called.

In 2004, ""RAW"" had excellent TV, but didn't always deliver when the PPVs came around.  But BAD BLOOD is one of their best shows of the year.  It delivered its three marquee matches (Hell-In-A-Cell and Chris Benoit's matches), gave us a very good IC Title contest, and an undercard that's enjoyable even when it's not as good as it should've been.
___________________________________________________

There are a few reasons I'm not recommending this TAGGED CLASSICS with 4 stars.  First off, both PPV's main events are available on other DVDs (Eddie Guerrero's VIVA LA RAZA and the HELL-IN-A-CELL DVD 3-disc sets).  JUDGMENT DAY has one of the best John Cena matches to date & a fine tag team opener, but the rest of the card is forgettable.  I personally recommmend that you just get BAD BLOOD because WWE will not re-release the Chris Benoit matches on this set.",1237248000,,10688,4.705121293800539
