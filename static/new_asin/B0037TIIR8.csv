5904228,5,B0037TIIR8,"I saw this film during Docuweeks in Los Angeles about a year ago. It inspired me beyond words, into action.

I found this film to have a broad range of views on varying topics having to do with dirt: natural building, tree planting, edible schoolyards (and after watching Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution, I am convinced that EVERY school needs a garden program!), mountaintop removal, mycology, energy, food, water, farming, composting, gardening....

I have since seen this film NUMEROUS times and I highly recommend it. While it does touch on some serious topics, it is not a heavy documentary that requires a barf bag (thanks, Cove) or a prescription for Lexapro. It is informative, general, entertaining and inspiring. AND it has a great soundtrack from KCRW's highly acclaimed Tom Schnabel.",1270425600,10,794,5.147286821705427

5904230,5,B0037TIIR8,"I've had the chance to watch a few clips from the upcoming DVD release of Dirt! The Movie and can't wait to see it in its entirety! Absolutely fascinating documentary of ""what lies beneath"" all of us and how we have abused and now must protect the soil that feeds all of us in so many ways.

I wouldn't have thought to select JL Curtis for the V/O work, but her voice actually works quite well and she's a pleasure to listen to. I can highly recommend Dirt! The Movie for everyone. Don't expect most of the right-wing conservatives to appreciate this film, since it deals with reality. :)",1268006400,4,588,4.394495412844036
5904231,5,B0037TIIR8,"Although this is not yet released, I have heard and seen some previews of DIRT: The Movie, and I must say what a great way this is to sum up what we need to know and do in order to save our planet; by learning to respect and treat as sacred, or at the very least essential, the basic element of our natural environment, the Soil!

Preserving and nurturing our soil preserves and nurtures life on the planet. We often look for the obvious, or plainly visible, and want the type of instant gratification that comes with easily recognizing something. In our soil lies the mostly invisible forces that make and sustain life on the planet. The fungus, bacteria, insects, and other minute, often microscopic beings and other elements that feed, support and recycle life as we know it. I will be purchasing this  from the producer and turning a lot of people on to the wonder, glory and essential beauty of DIRT!

Get Dirty!

5904232,2,B0037TIIR8,"It makes some good points and has some good information, but is very biased and seems anti-agriculture. It does not rely on information of experts in the field and qualified soil scientists, but instead uses information from less-qualified individuals to fit the narrative.

5904240,5,B0037TIIR8,"Dirt! The Movie is a must-see film for every gardener whether they are just starting out or if they are seasoned veterans. This documentary is all about building appreciation for that delicate living skin that envelopes our planet -its soil or dirt.

The film starts out just a little overly playful for my tastes, but the tone quickly balances out and I found myself thoroughly engaged. I had not realized how some cultures used dirt (and poop) in their actual building construction.

As one would expect, a documentary like this exposes the gross mismanagement of the earth's resources at the hands of humans. Deforestation is a serious problem which is not going away any time soon. Increasing desertification has resulted from poor agricultural practices. And precipitation run-off gets worse as we pave over more and more land area.

But although there is a grim moment of despair, the film does not leave you feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. The story is presented of the hummingbird in the forest, scrambling to fight a raging forest fire. Other, more capable animals look on, feeling helpless. But the little bird is not deterred. It continues to carry water, drop after drop to try to combat the raging fire. The point? It's doing the best it can.

The film shifts the focus from communal accountability and makes us stop and look at ourselves. Individually, what am I doing to show that I appreciate the gift of this beautiful planet I inhabit? Am I killing the soil? Or am I trying to have a positive impact?

I enjoyed seeing the efforts of people who are trying to turn the tide and make a difference. I watched as a bare landscape was transformed through a re-forestation project. I saw a prison system, using gardening to rehabilitate inmates helping them to turn their lives around. Even if your personal choices won't fix this world's problems, they will at least say something about who you are as a person. What do you stand for?",1475020800,,1949,4.8059701492537314

It is more of a lets hold hands and sing program. You will not get inner city people to tear out concrete and plant and take care of community gardens.....and produce enough food to be significant. Look at some of the communities and you will see that they will not even pick up their own garbage....They certainly are not going to care for huge compost piles properly and they are not going to attend work efforts in the heat or towards the end of the season.
I also don't think the automatic attack on large corporate farming is necessary or accurate...We are not still in the dustbowl and the large farmers have certainly learned a lot about maintaining the soil and all the aspects of producing food. Lets quit pretending that the professionals at farming are all stupid people taking advantage of the public. Farming is like other enterprises.

Cute little cartoons of dirt are interspersed throughout the documentary to bring a little levity to an intense topic.  It's amazing how important dirt is and how we need to take care of it.

5904307,5,B0037TIIR8,"I'm a student of the spiritual realms and the study of human nature. One could define that as understanding through transcendence, oneness, and the channeling of the divine. While I can re-contexualize the message in this movie and take it a step further, it doesn't negate the viewpoints which are put forward and valuable insights by very aware and loving people. Our misuse of soil is a very clearcut example of where we as people, are lacking in fundamental integrity. As one mentioned in this documentary, the soil is the very foundation, or heart of mother earth. If we treat it well, all of humanity prospers, and you will be nurtured by her warmth. Sadly, lesser lower self indulgences have created an agricultural system that benefits only ( or so they think) a select few. The karmic truth comes full circle and the destruction will eventually become apparent. The result? War. Much like the problems with the creation of antibiotics, quick fixes should remain nothing more as that and emphasis should be placed on using the same natural compounds to help us maintain health and harmony with bacterias, rather then forcing it to mutate in order to survive, resulting in a war of any description (Biological or economical, it's the lower self mechanisms of primitive instinct being guised  in either a sophisticated manner or not).

Not everyone can be ''saved'' ( I could take this further but it would be going beyond a review), the laws of nature and it's basic principles are not going to create double standards for us. We can put certain things in quarantine, but like vaccines that would protect otherwise susceptible beings to measles, there has been evidence to suggest autism and other neurological disorders have transpired in correlation to vaccination use over the last century. All this though is merely secondary. Not the ultimate culprit so to speak. The primary issues is understanding our true nature and recognizing what love entails. Self enquiry (Check out Ramana Maharshi's teachings) is a wonderful tool to help build the foundation so academia can be used for the greatest benefit to planet earth.

 When we truly love, we let certain thing's go, if it means prosperity and balance.

This is a great movie on awareness. Jamie lee Curtis did a great job narrating and the specialists discussing the topics did so in a fun and clear manner. This is a movie ultimately about respect.

5904313,5,B0037TIIR8,"This movie is a fantastic movie that describes all aspects of soil and somehow makes the viewer have emotions for the very thing that we trample on, on a daily basis.
I am currently a freshmen at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio and I watched this in my Soil Science Lab as an introduction to the class. I am studying Environmental Sciences with a focus on Ecosystem Restorations. This movie has taken all of the Environmental Sciences classes that I have taken and showed that the connection between them all is the soil. From catastrophic natural disasters to wars all across the world, the problem is that the soil has been degraded and is not functioning to its full potential. If you are looking for an introduction to Environmental Sciences this movie is an accurate and entertaining method to do it.
Besides just educating the viewers the movie calls them to action, to right the wrongs that the human race as done to the soil and therefore the environment in general. In the movie there is a short parable about a forest that is a fire and the animals are in shock. The animals can do nothing but watch their whole world go up in flames. One animal decides that it cant just sit by and watch the whole forest burn, the hummingbird. By itself the hummingbird carries water back and forth from the stream to the fire trying to put out the fire. The other animals criticize it saying that she is one bird and her actions so small .The humming bird responded, I am doing all that I can. The movie call the viewer to be the humming bird. The environmental problems that we face are huge and our world is going up in flames, (metaphorically at the moment but whos to say about the future) but if we all did all that we could with 7.1 billion people on this planet our actions would add up and make a change for the better.
As a passionate Environmental Sciences student I would highly recommend everyone to watch this movie and hope that you will answer the call to Be the Hummingbird!!",1390003200,2,1995,4.483516483516484

The Movie raises awareness to the unsustainable and economically-centered agricultural practices that have led to more than 200,000 suicides among Indian farmers, declining nutritional value in certain foods as a result of pesticides, and hunger and food-riots around the world.
 While slightly cheesy at times, the film offered many manageable solutions to promoting soil health and increasing soil fertility in developing countries and close to home. These solutions included: roof-top gardens in urban areas, composting, supporting local farms and CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture), and even grandiose ideas like harnessing energy through microbial fuel cells.

5904336,3,B0037TIIR8,"it also comes from some flawed assumptions.

I liked the quality of the film and the imagery. There were some valid points made about soil importance and degredation. Yes, we do have to do better as stewards of the land and soil quality, way better. But, it's not just the treatment of soil that is the cause. There are political/governmental, international financiers and corporate controllers that are manipulating our economy's, ecologies, and our populations including where they locate.

The whole evolution trip was annoying. All this millions and billions of years stuff when we witness major transformations in terms of years and decades at the most. Yet we are to believe that human beings who started writing about 6,000 years ago took nearly 2 million years to figure out how to do that, according to the time frame presented in the film. Oh pulleeze, stop with the fairy tale claims.

Heck, those Hearty Roots dudes changed hay fields into productive organic farms in a matter of a few years. Didn't take them decades or centuries even. I can compost waste into soil in a few years myself. Even the tree lover dude made changes from concrete to productive soil in only a few years. Yet, we're supposed to accept the premise of millions of years of evolution and the creation of the soil and life. To me, it's a flawed assumption and claim that permeates the film.

Additionally, I noted many references that had nothing to back them up other than a statement from the person, half the time an activist not a scientist. Guess we are expected to accept every claim as fact without the facts to back it up.

And the global warming stuff? Political agenda and a theory that is collapsing in the light of actual reality.

That said, the film is worth viewing simply because it points to an important issue that we can take better control of, i.e. the treatment of our soil and what is grown upon it.

P.S.- I eat natural and organic food as much as possible. Have a much smaller footprint than most urban area dwellers, have an organic garden and have done this stuff for nearly four decades so I do support this direction with my actions and lifestyle. I just don't buy what I have discovered as flawed threads that run through some of the film.

I would give it three stars because of what I perceive as flaws but would still recommend watching it as you are sure to get something worthwhile from it. The intention is good and the presentation is well done and an overall positive message about an issue we should all pay more attention to which is the quality of our soil and the food we grow and consume from it.",1371686400,4,2623,4.601713062098501

Children without parental guidance or from neglected and abusive environments will least likely become good citizens (always with exceptions, of course). People who are serious about the welfare of our planet (not just waffle on about Climate Change, Environmental Degradation, Destruction & Polution, ...without naming ourselves as the main culprits), MUST support a global one child policy, maybe maximum two.

5904360,4,B0037TIIR8,"Note: this review was originally written for PRISM Magazine, published by Evangelicals for Social Action, and appears in the July/August 2011 issue.

There are all sorts of things you and I take for granted every day of our lives, but few are as basic or fundamental to our very existence as dirt. This is the basic premise of DIRT! The Movie, an 80-minute documentary film exploring the profound impact of soil on every sphere of society.

The film is narrated by Jamie Lee Curtis and features interviews with an Indian environmental activist, the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, a wine connoisseur, an Austrian-born physicist, a professor of agroecology, and an array of others, all offering their unique perspectives on the irreplaceable significance of dirt in our lives.

To Christians, this should come as no surprise. In the second chapter of Genesis we read, ""God formed Man out of dirt from the ground and blew into his nostrils the breath of life. The Man came alive--a living soul!"" (The Message); indeed, even the name Adam means ""dust."" Yet too often we consider this mere poetry, thinking of dirt and dust more as nuisances to be avoided rather than the elemental sources of life our Creator God intended them to be.

Given the long-standing indifference and neglect dirt has endured in the public mind, one might expect a documentary of this sort to be, well, dry. It's anything but. While the interviewees have impressive credentials on their own merits, the creators of the film went to great lengths -- at times rather goofily so -- to make the film accessible and interesting.

If DIRT! The Movie makes one core contribution to the environmental conversation, it is in highlighting the symbiotic relationship between people and the land. In doing so, it makes clear that for better or worse, even the smallest of actions on this finite planet have cosmic consequences.

""The earth is the Lord's,"" says the Psalmist, ""and everything in it."" Meditating on the truth of those words, with the arguments of DIRT! in mind, may help us as stewards to cultivate and value dirt for what it is, rather than treading it underfoot.

Feel good stories emphasize the universality of protecting soil, nurturing it for our own survival, and ways in which soil is celebrated by people around the world.  Hard science this is not.",1308441600,8,374,5.098360655737705
5904362,2,B0037TIIR8,"Why? Because it spreads simplifications and generalisations, which only make people confused about a very important but complex subject, which deserves so much more: a balanced and erudite exploration of reality! Without emotional honky-tonky, without one-sidedness, and definitely without the sentiment of ""oooooh, the soil is so holy, we must all worship the soil"", on which this movie spends an awful lot of time, time better spent on analysing problems and exploring solutions. Admittingly, the movie does put the mark on some serious problems and takes a peek at a variety of interesting ""solutions"", albeit pretty small-scaled ones which are in no way an answer to the big problems we face - big problems for which there ARE improvements/solutions, but which this movie fails to explore. Bad things aside, this movie dd made me reflect on whether we should take good, living soil for granted: it's actually pretty amazing!

One thing that stands out in ""Dirt"" is the tunnel-demonisation of modern large-scale farming with its monocultures. The movie doesn't provide a balanced story, with all the arguments, all the sides, the good and the bad. What it does provide is a disservice to the difficult and complex reality of farming.

Some examples of how ""Dirt: the movie"" tends to generalise and simplify:

The movie opens and ends with this quote: ""Of the billions of planets in all the galaxies of the known universe, only one has a living, breathing skin, called dirt"". Actually, as far as I know, the present knowledge is more like this: we don't know if there is another planet with life/soil, and since we haven't been able to check a lot of those billions of planets, we do not know.

""As we walk through the landscape, not only are the birds aware, and the bears, and all the other animals of this forest: all the microbes in the soil are aware of our presence."" Oh, please.

Throughout the movie there is a woman (smiling ALL the time, which would be admirable - instead of irritating - if it weren't in this movie) who sais head-in-the-cloud-things like: ""We are made of the same five basic elements that the earth is made of."" Then there is this guy who tastes soil and sais ""With the amount of species living in a teaspoon of dirt, I think it is very obvious that dirt might be more alive than we are."" I myself was taught that our bodies are as well full of life, with billions of bacteria and stuff. I'm just saying...

[Natural resources are used] ""for the benefit of a very small number of people"". Do the makers of this movie not have electricity? A home with furniture? Water? Food? Clothes? Transportation? This reeks of conspiracy theories (a small business elite rules the world!!), which is smellable throughout the movie.

""In India alone [they target that] 600 million famers should disappear in an industrial model of farming"" They say that like it would be a bad thing... Moving away from an agriculture society to a service society is a consequence of economic growth, and vastly improves the lives of many. In the West, only a few percent of the population still works in agriculture. That's why many people can pursue lifes as doctors, engineers, scientists, teachers, writers, dancers, actors, photographers,... instead of destroying their back while farming like papa.

""Famers around the world are comitting suicide."" So vague, so easily said, so easily pulled out of context.
""In  India, over the last decade, an estimated 200 000 farmers have killed themselves; many, by drinking the pesticide they can no longer afford."" There is indeed a problem with farmers who kill themselves in India, but this oversimplified and selfserving statement is shamefull. For a wider perspective (not one-liners that have LITTLE to do with REALITY), read e.g. the Wikipedia article on farmers' suicides in india.

We live in the 21st century, which is characterised by an enormous amount and availability of information. I find it somewhat strange that bad analysis, misleading ""facts"", out-of-contexters, etc. still get airplay like this. The world will be a better place when that changes. Facts, clarity and vision: that is what we need when analysing problems and solutions. Not the manure this movie brings to the table. I don't eat that ****. And neither should you.",1306800000,26,4294,4.934903047091413

5904364,5,B0037TIIR8,The movie itself is very good but unfortunately I could only play through my computer. I was warned that it may not work here in Australia so I'm not complaining. Just would like to be able to purchase DVD's that I can play on DVD players rather than just computers. So much is lost on a very small laptop screen. Am I ordering the wrong thing?

5904368,5,B0037TIIR8,"So I really enjoyed this film, and am a college student a year away from an environmental PhD and have learned quite a deal about soil composition, what exactly ' Soil GUY ' ....is this film inaccurate about, the research is clear and cons-iced from researchers, botanists and the scientific community on how terrible our Dirt situation is, locally and around different countries and the world. You mentioned this film is criminal and downright misleading but also did not elaborate or explain anything of what exactly is so criminal about it... I bet you work for Monsanto or some other large Agribusiness corporation disciplining in the bare necessities you can engineer soil to survive off of, and still get a short term profit out of it, somehow regardless of it's effects on people, animals, plants, nutrition, the actual soil itself.  But it in no way is it healthy, un toxic, or sustainable.  That's a ludicrous statement and yes I happen to know that it is, and its irresponsible for you to come on her saying otherwise; people just want to think it's some crazy conspiracy hey no the soils great, waters great, climate change is debunked by 3 emails taken out of context and slandered by a senator who said, I quote ""...this is probably the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people since the separation of church and state..."" Yea I think that speaks for itself, look that guy up seriously,  his consistent record speaks for itself.

 Yea environmentalists and concerned people made a documentary about things going on right now and that continue to go on, and don't want, the stuff life is made off of dirt, eroding away at an obscene totally unsustainable rate, and for people to consciously making fertile places unusable and tarnished....yea the f**ing nerve, what a bunch of wack jobs....You seem pretty wack jobby to me, with the comment I just read you above about this movie, and really if you are as knowledgable as you say you are and this film is so off base, Please say why and explain that....yea that's always helpful.  even though it would destroy your case.

5904370,4,B0037TIIR8,"The movie is adapted from Bill Logan's essays collected under the title ""Dirt: the Ecstatic Skin of the Earth."" In three parts, it explains the miraculous nature of soil, illustrates humanity's mismanagement of soil, and shows some hopeful approaches to better management. The talking heads are varied and interesting, and the photography wonderful. I found the coverage of soil mismanagement a little difficult to follow, even though it's not new to me. I'm planning to show my copy to a youth group at our church and will have to pause it there and explain things.

8604177,1,B0037TIIR8,"As an informed plant pathologist, there was very little I liked about Dirt: The movie. I liked that it got across the fact that soil is full of lots of diversity that helps recycle resources, although, it did this rather redundantly. However, the rest really didn't inform me of the science of dirt. It quickly became heavily anecdotal, obviously biased against conventional agriculture, and paradoxical. This movie contributes the misinformed views about agriculture and ignores the realities of farming to feed the world.
The movie manages to quickly shame GMOs and mass agriculture as well. Then, twists the fact that the actual science and technology that allows farming to feed more people and reduce food prices, is actually the cause of food riots. This oversimplified look at the causes of food riots as just soil troubles to fit their stance with soil, actually causes the viewer to ignore the real issues surrounding food riots.",1504396800,,938,5.097402597402597
