2835245,5,B000QCU9JO,"I have been waiting for these movies to come out with good quality picture & sound for a long time. That time is now. I couldn't be happier than I was when I opened these movies and watched them. Now I can wait for Flim Flam Man with George C. Scott, The Rounders with Henry Fonda & Glen Ford, and Jekyll & Hyde Together Again with Mark Blankfield to come out. As they are all great movies also. If anyone knows who to contact to get these movies made into DVD format please share it with me, because they are also long over due to come out.",1191542400,,541,4.065420560747664
2835246,3,B000QCU9JO,"In Trinity is Still My Name, there is a missing scene where Trinity, Bambino and his mother and father are having dinner and his father tells them they ought to get married. He then proceeds to tell them how he met their mother and she preens as he does this. Well ... that story of how he met their mother is NOT in this version. Which is tragic. I'm going to have to see what else is missing. After waiting for decades for the remastered widescreen release ... it's wildly disappointing that scenes are missing that were in the far far far inferior fullscreen versions that preceeded it. Still it's nice to see it in anamorphic.",1189555200,88,630,4.439655172413793
2835247,4,B000QCU9JO,These two versions look great as far as picture quality goes.  But the running times don't seem to match the original running time.  Perhaps we can get an amateur dvd detective on the case?  They also seem to be from French(the word avec is in the opening credits) source material so they might be shorter prints than the original.  But other than that the quality is excellent. The movies are alot of fun and highly recommended.  I just hate dvds that are not in original running time though so that is why Iam concerned a little. The box art states that they are from original negatives and they do look the best I have ever seen.  But are they edited is the question?,1189209600,32,670,4.40650406504065

Disc 2 has a really nice root menu and the transfer is beautiful.

Neither is Closed Captioned. There are no subtitles.

So basically if you're buying this, you're only getting your money's worth for the second film, as you cannot watch all of the first.",1509235200,,384,4.536231884057971

lived in Moscow. To this day, I absolutely love this film and can

watch it over and over and recite it line for line...

I saw the second one recently and also love it, but not nearly as

much as the original. The music, the silly comedy, and bud spencer

and terence hill is nuff said. The restoration looks good on this

release, probably the best ive seen for this movie. If I made a

I liked the Part in the first movie when Trinity wants to become a Mormon and have two wives only to find the two women he wants to marry are married to the ""old man"" he was helping.

Heads up to fans that the remastered 2003 Nouveaux Pictures UK release of these films has great present-day extended interviews with both Terence and Bud. Terence speaks pretty good english but Bud never did speak english and his interview is subtitled. Great stories and memories from the old days and gives one a better understanding of what they were trying to do with their success.

What a shame they didn't include these rare interviews on this new US release. But that's how it always goes over here. (Check out the UK release of Bronson's Red Sun with a SUPER RARE interview with the normally tight-lipped Bronson!?!) Ahh the joys of a region free DVD player....

If you like these films, skip the unofficial third installment of this Trinity Trilogy titled 'The Trouble Makers' and check out 'Watch Out We're Mad' instead - it's hilarious!!

2835553,5,B000QCU9JO,"I shall begin by explaining to other reviewers, why there is a missing sequence in Trinity Is Still My Name. All the other poor quality versions are not official releases. The official Italian released version removed the scene where the mother was talking about having the boys out of wedlock. Italy being predominantly Church based and given the era, it was decided to be prudent. And given that the ""spaghetti"" western era was at an end at this time, it was decided to leave this scene on the cutting room floor.
Hen's Tooth Video have done a magnificent job on these re-productions. The video is crisp and sharp (even being played here in Australia on a PAL/NTSC compatible system. I use a 42"" Plasma and these ""scale"" up to their perfect anamorphic size while no quality losses are noted.
I have seen MANY copies of these two movies from all over the world, both PAL and NTSC versions. This set is the best available in English.
If you love these two actors as much as I do, then this set is for you. You will not be disappointed. Maybe one day,  full on re-mastered versions will be authorized, with all missing scenes and DTS 5.1.",1214784000,29,1137,4.546341463414634
2835554,4,B000QCU9JO,"I never watched Westerns as a kid, so my recent introduction to the Trinity movies was a real treat. These movies aren't of the best quality (production-wise), but I understand from other reviews that this particular version is far superior to any others out there. But the stories are hilarious, and everyone in my family loved them - from my 60-ish dad on down to my 8-year-old little sister. Trinity's laziness is legendary, his filth is unparalleled, and these movies can't really be compared to anything other than Blazing Saddles. The humor here is a little less ribald, but still funny enough that you'll want to watch them over and over.",1214438400,,645,4.81981981981982
2835555,4,B000QCU9JO,A healthy plate full of spaghetti for the discriminating fan of Westerns. Lots of funny moments in both of these movies--from slapstick to card-sharking and trick-shooting..If you're a fan of this genre this is good stuff..,1214092800,,223,5.222222222222222

2835559,3,B000QCU9JO,"I saw these movies with my family as a child,and loved them.  I saw them online and ordered them.  They were cheesier than I remembered, but they were still great fun to watch.  You have to keep in mind they were made over 30 years ago, and spaghetti westerns.  I'll watch them again!",1206489600,,284,4.30188679245283
2835560,5,B000QCU9JO,"Finally a true remastered version of these classic spaghetti western spoofs.  Clear picture, great sound.  However, as stated elsewhere the running times are shorter.  They Call Me Trinity is about 5 minutes shorter in this version as compared to my earlier dvd from Direct Source.  Trinity Is Still My Name clocks in about 10 minutes shorter in the Hens Tooth version vs the Direct Source dvd.

View the comments below and one person provides an explanation that there are conversion rate issues that may shorten the movie after the transfer is done.  That may explain most of the time differences, but I still suspect that some things have also been cut.

That all being said, these new versions are worthy.",1204243200,,709,4.858333333333333

Arrived in good shape and in a timely manner",1200268800,,95,4.647058823529412
2835562,4,B000QCU9JO,this is a great 2-pack for all of us trinity lovers.the movies here have been remastered and look as good as they did when they were first released.don't miss these great westerns...buy!,1194393600,,186,4.84375
2835563,5,B000QCU9JO,"I've loved these films ever since I saw them in high school, but I could only see them on terrible copies, and have never seen them in widescreen. The previous DVD releases have also been terrible, with awful sound. But the new release has changed all of that.

First, the video is a hundred times better than anything I've seen before. While the visuals of the Trinity films will never be anything to write home about, everything is now crisp, there are no video distortions, and best of all, it's in widescreen! Second, the sound is dramatically improved. I can now understand dialog that's always been murky in the past. Trinity has been a great love for me, but showing it to the uninitiated has always been a problem because people would bolt as soon as they saw the horrible copy come on the screen. With the new release, I'm having regular viewing parties and bringing new fans into the fold.

The extras are nice, but they're really just the italian movie cards and the trailer. Interesting, but ehh. Still, I'm grateful they're there.

Finally, it's great that the two Trinity films are in one collection. Buy this and you're done. Don't be misled by other Terrence and Bud pics which look like Trinity (with some even being renamed Trinity), because they're not part of the series at all.

This is the most exciting DVD release for me in years. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1193702400,37,1383,4.609756097560975

8195620,5,B000QCU9JO,"I love the Trinity movies!  If I'm reviewing the movies, then 5 Stars!  The physical product was inexpensive and probably in line with the quality. But the movies themselves are some of my favorites from my youth... and I gave them to my children who have become enamored with westerns.  The Terrence Hill spaghetti westerns are very fun and well worth your time -- but know that they are ""silly"" and not ""Clint Eastwood"" type westerns.",1514332800,2,436,4.7105263157894735
