3664919,3,B001KEHAGC,"John Denver stars as Jim Clayton, an FBI agent who gets fed up with his job in LA and moves to Alaska be a bush pilot.  There, his partner gets involved with some shady smugglers and when he's found dead, Jim spearheads the investigation.

This TV movie was a pilot for a series.  It's entertaining enough, with an exciting plot and nasty bad guys.  The problem is John Denver was a wonderfully talented singer but not a strong actor.  He struggles to deliver his lines and isn't believable as an agent. His awkwardness contrasts greatly with the experience of his costars Martin Kove and John Rhys-Davis.  Denver does shine when singing the lilting title song and a rousing ode to Alaska.  His fans won't mind his self-conscious acting, but I can understand why this wasn't picked up as a series.

The movie does have a well-written script and beautiful Canadian scenery, and those who loved John Denver will find the scenes of him flying his little plane will tug at the heartstrings.  A good movie for his fans.",1292198400,,1014,4.651685393258427
3664920,5,B001KEHAGC,"This is a a great treat for anyone and a must see for fans of John Denver.  He's looking great, showing off his excellent acting abilities against the backdrop of beautiful Alaska and is shown doing what he loved almost better than anything; flying. It is exciting to see him in fight scenes, a sharp contrast to his gentle nature and beautiful songs.  Even peace loving people sometimes have to stand up for what is right.",1255478400,4,423,4.552631578947368
3664921,4,B001KEHAGC,"I bought this dvd partly because i'm a big John Denver fan & partly because the reviews of it here on Amazon were overwhelmingly good. I unfortunately missed it back in 1988 when it was on tv but I am really glad I took a chance &  bought it cuz it's one of Denver's best movies. It's also a real treat to see him playing a former FBI agent in the wilds of Alaska who while investigating the murder of his best friend & partner (Martin Kove), gets to fly around in cool seaplanes as part of the shipping business that he's working in. His investigation rubs a few locals & the sherriff (John Rys-Davies) the wrong way at first but they quickly start to see that his character is smart, tenacious & not someone to be taken lightly. Along with the good story there is teriffic scenery & a good cast as well. You even get to see John sing & play guitar during a party scene. The highlight of this film isn't the music, story or gorgeous scenery though.  It's actually getting to see John do the thing he loved to do the most when he wasn't entertaining all us lucky fans, and that was flying airplanes. Obviously there is a bittersweet quality to this but it's still great to see John having a great time & know all the while, that at the very least, he died doing the thing he most loves to do.",1249430400,19,1292,4.205645161290323

3664923,5,B001KEHAGC,I really enjoyed this movie and can recommend it for anyone whether they are a John Denver fan or not.  The acting was great and the scenery even better.,1238198400,3,153,4.275862068965517
3664924,3,B001KEHAGC,"This little telefilm is a must have for John Denver fans. If, for no other reason, it is one of the few films he ever did. Otherwise, there is not much about it that is worth anything. The story isn't bad. The scenic shots of Alaska are stunning.  It is a big budget production with a fairly solid cast. The direction is weak and unimaginative and the writing appalling. The entire film makes you wince given the words that these actors have to struggle with. However, for JD fans, it's a chance to spend some time with him. The character he plays is really John Denver as an FBI agent. ""Oh God"" gave us JD when he was much younger. This film gives you a more mature JD. Aside from ""Oh God"", ""Foxfire"" with Jessica Tandy is a much better film with John. The, as yet to be released in DVD telefilm ""The Christmas Gift"" is also a better choice to see JD. He's a pretty natural actor and, in ""The Christmas Gift"", he sings a lovely verse from one of his more contemporary songs, ""Love Again"" - an added bonus.",1235606400,15,1006,4.267015706806283
3664925,5,B001KEHAGC,"I eagerly awaited delivery of this newly released DVD. It arrived in yesterday's mail and I watched it last night. I was truly surprised with John's performance. Admittedly, he was not a great actor, but a substantially good one. Of his films that I've seen, this was his best. The casting is superb; the acting well directed with fine performances all around. The scenery is magnificent and John sings and plays. A perfect evening of entertainment.",1233792000,30,449,4.921052631578948
3664926,5,B001KEHAGC,"This is an inspiring movie about following your dreams...reaching for higher ground, while making choices between right and wrong.

3664947,5,B001KEHAGC,"I loved this movie, a ""pilot film"" for a television series starring John Denver. The TV series didn't happen, but we still have this movie to show us how much John loved planes, flying, and rural places of great beauty. The plot is so-so, but that's all right, because it's another view of John Denver that many haven't seen.",1471305600,2,325,4.52542372881356

3664975,5,B001KEHAGC,"I got my husband to buy this for me, and I am so glad he did!  Although he never shared the enthusiasm that I did as being one of John Denver's fans, he knew that I did.  I have always been a HUGE fan of John Denver, and I had never heard of this movie, having lost touch with some of the films he made during a very busy period of my life.  When I was looking through items pertaining to JD, I came across this film and my husband ordered it for me.  I really enjoyed watching it tonight.  I thought he did a great job and was rather convincing in the role.  I thought the scenery was beautiful, and how well the script fit him, as he had matured from a mop-topped, granny glasses wearing singer/guitarist (whom I adored, incidentally) to a mature man who, though not a professional actor, did a fantastic job in this movie.  I read some of the critics words tonight regarding his performance, and I don't understand how people can be so cruel.  Considering some of the trash that has been made for television and film, and considering that John wasn't a trained actor - give the guy a break, why don't you?  It is easy to criticize - It takes a deeper spirit to find the beauty in a thing, be it a song, a film, nature, a book, whatever!  Suffice it to say, considering the way John left us, it was bittersweet to see him in an airplane for the film, and one can only imagine how he was as a pilot in reality.  I noticed in the film that it mentioned that his father (in the film) had flown, and anyone who knows anything about JD, knows that his father was an air force pilot, and John was called an air force brat, and moved around a lot when he was growing up.  Considering all that, one can truly appreciate the man he grew up to be and that enormous talent that he had.  Yes, he was an excellent singer and songwriter, and a good guitarist/musician, and no one can argue that those were his main strengths when it came to talent, BUT this film was one of his best, in my opinion, if not THE best, and any fan of John Denver would certainly agree with that statement.  I would encourage any fan of JD's to buy this film for their library.  I plan to watch it many more times in the future.",1414022400,6,2195,4.143867924528302

3664999,5,B001KEHAGC,"John Denver made this pilot for a television series relatively late in his career, and it is fun to see him in an entirely different role, hunting down the bad guys and singing.
