2360653,4,B000A59Q1E,"Longer than most, this Doris Day edition of ""Biography"" originally aired on 'Sweethearts' week with Susan Lucci hosting. Many have confused it with Doris's first movie, ""Romance on the High Seas"", since ""It's Magic"" was an alternate title. The special follows young Doris's rise as a teenage dancer in Ohio who was good enough to secure Hollywood backing--until a train accident left one of her legs in horrible shape. Recuperating in bed, Doris began to sing along with the radio and discovered a hidden talent--she had an uncanny ear and was a superb vocalist! There are no interviews with Doris herself, but Terry Melcher, her son who recently passed away, adds his comments, as do Kaye Ballard and biographer A.E. Hotchner (who tells us of DD: ""She's like Greta Garbo--you'll never see her again""). Except for a brief phone interview on CNN after Ronald Regan died, Hotchner seems to be right. Relishing her privacy in Carmel, California, Doris is said to be happily surprised at how her music and movies have held up in popularity. If only she knew how much the entertainment world still needs her...",1140998400,48,1105,4.9144385026737964

It's an excellent documentary and any Doris Day fan would love it, but don't think it's a movie, 'cause it's not. :)",1126137600,43,264,4.574468085106383

8074586,5,B000A59Q1E,A beautiful bio of Doris Day.  I have already watched my DVD several times.  Movie clips and interviews with people who worked w/ Doris Day are included although Doris Day doesn't speak at all herself about anything (as she's currently 90 years old and still living).,1412726400,,267,4.782608695652174
8074587,5,B000A59Q1E,"This is for the DVD ""Doris Day - It's Magic"" (1998). It's 90 minutes long, and narrated by Peter Graves.

This is very well produced. There are many songs, movie clips, and pictures. Lots of people were interviewed. I was disappointed that Doris Day herself was not interviewed. My guess is that she did not agree, is very guarded of her privacy.

The video promises at the outset to be a story of the ""girl next door"", with ""wholesome good looks"", but a ""backstage story of heartbreak and tragedy"". And so it was. Somewhat surprisingly (at least for me), Doris Day is the top-ranking female box-office star of all time. So her story is significant for several different reasons.

Here are some highlights:

- Poor relationship with distant, cold father.
- Dancing star at young age.
- Tragic childhood accident stops dancing career.
- How she got into singing while recovering.
- Her many marriages and (often relatively quick) divorces.
- How she got a screen test in Hollywood.
- Singing ""Sentimental Journey"".
- ""Young Man with a Horn"".
- ""The Man who Knew too Much"".
- ""Pillow Talk"".
- ""Que Sera Sera""
- Losing all her money, getting back on her feet.
- Rock Hudson's death, how it affected her.
- Her strong Christian Science religious beliefs.
- Her son Terry, and the connection with Charles Manson.
- The tabloid stories about her being a bag lady.
- Her love of animals and work for animal welfare.

I found the video to be entertaining and educational. To me the video tells a real story about a public perception (sex kitten and perpetual virgin) vs the private reality (how hard she worked, many up and downs of her marriages and finances), and her intrinsic goodness.",1391385600,,1681,4.684745762711865

8074590,5,B000A59Q1E,"An interesting, well-balanced, informative documentary on Doris Day. I only wish the producers had been able to snare an interview with the reclusive Ms. Day, but she hasn't done one since 1991 for a PBS special. She has had an interesting, yet very sad life. A highly successful movie star and singer, Doris yearned for the husband, kids and white picket fence, but that traditional goal proved elusive. She has now found happiness with her animal rights causes and her kennel of four-legged friends. This documentary is well worth purchasing, as the PBS one is no longer being broadcast.",1217030400,3,589,4.959595959595959
