859884,5,6304392494,"A truly superb classic 70s kung fu film.  When a kung fu movie starts out during the opening credits with a live animal fighting another live animal on an empty sound stage, followed by the film's stars fighting each other in their signature animal form on the sound stage, while a serious-sounding narrator gives you the history of each animal form --- you know it gotta be good!  If you like that truly classic-style flick, buy this video immediately.  Chen Kwan Tai is superb, as always.  The plot is straightforward and engaging and leaves you in suspense throughout.  Spectacular intricate fight sequences are scattered liberally throughout the entire film, from beginnng to end.  One of the Kwan Tai's many opponents, I believe, is a Venom.
This movie, made in 1977, should not be confused with the altogether different 1993 film of the same name.  From my ""classic"" perspective, this film (the 1977 ""original"") is far superior.  This is one of my favorite kung fu movies of all time.  It contains one of my favorite kung fu films lines, uttered by the aging monkey fist master to his new would-be student on the first day of training, ""The monkey fist technique is most complex...""",971481600,11,1188,4.812807881773399
859885,5,6304392494,"When a 70s style kung fu movie starts during the opening credits with a live animal fighting another live animal spliced with one fighter of the one animal style fighting another fighter of the other animal style while a serious-sounding narrator gives you the history of both animal forms --- YOU KNOW IT GOTTA BE GOOD!  This is one of my most favorite kung-fu films of all time.  It contains a very intriguing and engaging plot.  There are intense superb fights throughout the entire film, not just at the end.  Many of the villain fighters are readily recognizable, including, I believe, a Venom.  Chen Kwan Tai is awesome, as usual.  The film contains one of my favorite kung fu film lines of all time, uttered by the aging, venerable Monkey Fist Master to his student on the first day of ""class"": ""The Monkey fist technique is most complex...""  If you are a lover of 70s classic kung fu, you will want this movie.  Do not confuse this movie with the newer 1993 film of the same name.  While that movie is good in its own right, I still prefer the ""classic"" 1977 movie hands-down.  If someone tells you they like the newer version better, they are probably too young to appreciate classic Venom-style choreography and/or never had a opportunity, as I did, to enjoy the movie in a packed ""hootin' and hollering"" theatre during the original theatrical release.",970012800,,1362,4.684873949579832

859888,4,6304392494,"Fans of Sonny Chiba and Bruce Lee may not find this movie to be their pride and joy,but will probably find it enjoyable nevertheless. Iron Monkey is set in Manchuria, and made by the Eastern Heroes Video Company. This  fact alone would usually turn me off, because of the extremely realistic  and conservative fight scenes. There is no gore, unlike the Street Fighter,  and there is not that certain charm that Bruce Lee gives to his films. But,  somehow Iron Monkey finds a way to please a westerner (me) through its  original,laid back fight scenes and a very strong ending.",926208000,7,576,4.72

860093,3,6304392494,"The great Chen Kuan Tai (""Challenge of the Masters"") stars as the title character in a revenge-themed movie that distinguishes itself from others in the genre of old-school kung fu.  For starters, IF this movie has a sense of humor, it's long gone within 10 minutes!

Chen plays Iron, an irresponsible gambler whose priorities seem to relate primarily to loafing.  When his anti-Ching parents and siblings are betrayed/executed by his father's friend (Wilson Tong, ""Daggers 8""), it's up to Iron to earn his namesake and take revenge by training at the Shaolin Temple.  He takes a lot of crap from his fellow secular students (including Chi Kuan Chun, ""Showdown at the Cotton Mill"") but quickly passes them in terms of martial progress.  He climbs the Shaolin ladder one rung at a time and is soon offered the opportunity to train with an individual master.  He chooses the Monkey Fist as taught by the Bitter Monk (Chan Muk Chuen, ""Crippled Masters"") and trains until the Ching General (Kam Kong, ""Master of the Flying Guillotine"") sends men to recruit fresh talent from Shaolin.  A request answered only by Iron Monkey.

The fights are kinda slow but occur frequently.  I actually like them but I know of a lot of fu-fans who don't and I can't really blame them.  A lot of kung fu movies of this era had slow choreography and had I seen this one as a kid, I would definitely have loved it and the nostalgia would've carried over BUT I saw this for the first time about a year ago.  What makes this work is Chen Kuan Tai and the degree of masochism Iron Monkey is willing to inflict and endure to achieve his ultimate revenge.  Methods that would in no way be endorsed by his father or the Shaolin Temple!

Once again, a Xenon DVD advertises itself as being ""Digitally Remastered"".  And once again, the consumer responds with ""not likely"".  However, last year's viewing was a rental with an even worse picture so perhaps it is.  I still can't categorize the picture quality as being anything beyond decent but it is widescreened and fans of old-school fu have had to tolerate much worse.  If you enjoy costumed, mid-70s kung fu, without the Peking Opera-inspired humor, then this is recommended.  Not quite a classic but solid.

860094,5,6304392494,"""Iron Monkey"" The film:
*****stars.

 ""The Iron Monkey"" from 1977 remains one of the absolute finest kung fu films of all time.  Starring the amazing, legendary 'monkey fist' master, Chen Kuan-Tai, who also directed this seminal film, ""The Iron Monkey"" possesses a beautiful and surreal quality, without the huge budget of films from the 'Shaw Bros.'  Costumes, cinematography, acting and of course fight scenes, are of a high quality.  Chen Kuan tai stars as the Iron Monkey, a gambling, undisciplined playboy, who returns home to discover that his family has been murdered by soldiers of the Ching dynasty.  This becomes a traditional revenge picture, but executed with a wonderful amount of style and integrity.  We get to see 'the Monkey's' slow transformation into a one-man killing machine, under the guidance of 'The Bitter Monk,' possibly the most fascinating and mystical of all the teachers in this genre of film.  ""Iron Monkey"" is an atmospheric and thoughtful work of art, and should be seen by fans of kung fu cinema.

The dvd
*** stars

  For those looking at the dvd from 'Xenon,' this is the one to get. Xenon is a good label, and has released some great, rare titles. It also seems like they search out the best quality print available, and for this title, what you see is the best you will find, as the original print for ""Iron Monkey"" has long since been lost/destroyed. That makes it impossible to do a proper, full restoration. However the Xenon dvd is, amazingly, in it's original 2;35 screen ratio, and if you are a fan of the martial arts genre, you know how important this is. The framing of each shot is important when seeing the many fight scenes in great detail. So the colors might be washed out, but you still get the ""full picture."" This is the edition to buy.",1282348800,,1791,4.723472668810289
860095,4,6304392494,"this is a really worth it decent old school kung fu movie in the late 70's.

A story about delinquent guy whose family has been murdered by the ching empire.  The guy found refuge at shaolin temple where he soon learn one of the hardest technique called monkey fist.  After he mastered the art, he left shaolin and went to join the ming empire to act as a spy so that he can assasinate the general who is responsible for the death of his family.  He met the general at the end only to found out that the general also has a deadly kung fu technique.

A very good kung fu between monkey fist vs. eagle claw style...great acrobatic moves and raw fighting with no wire and flying around.  The picture of the film is not great but is bearable to watch but the sound is good.  Highly recommended for old school kung fu fans out there",1170460800,,827,4.229299363057325
860096,5,6304392494,"Iron Monkey is one of the masterpieces of the kungfu genre. Many connesiurs of this genre think that the finest kungfu films were produced by the Shaw Brothers, but this film proves them to be wrong. Directed by the hero of the film, Chen Kuan Tai, the film is truly a classic. The scene in the opening credits sets the mood for the film; cross cutting between a monkey style practicioner and an eagle claw practitioner fighting, and a real monkey and eagle fighting ferociously.

The story is simple; the hero's family is killed by the Manchus because they are accociated with rebels, but the hero escapes. He seeks refuge in the Shaolin Temple, and learns the Monkey Boxing technique. He then joins the Manchu government in order to get revenge for his family.
 The costumes and sets in the film are excellent, better than any other kungfu film I have seen. The cinematography is also very good, adding to the excellence of the film. The film is full of excellent kungfu; no comedy, magic, or corny tricks, only straight martial arts. I have not seen Chen Kuan Tai in any other films before this, but he is certainly one of the best actors and martial artists in the genre, equalling the famed Shaw Bros. stars such as Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh. The film is not only has good martial arts, but is is good as a movie. The VHS version is widescreen and dubbed in English, and the picture quality is good.",1040342400,,1401,4.511811023622047
860097,5,6304392494,"I just finished watching this underappreciated gem and all I can say is ""holy christ!""  This film delivers the goods with AWESOME choreography and fluid, authentic monkey and eagle style action.  The film moves sort of slow for the first two thrids or so but it keeps intrest and displays a few well done fight sequences.  When it gets to the last thirty minutes or so, brace yourself for maniacal kung fu action!  I have practically seen it ALL in the realm of kung fu and I am one of the most fanatical peoeple on this planet when it comes to martial arts movies.  I can honestly say that this picture ranks with the cream of the crop, a true classic that makes me want to see more of the talented Chen Kwan Tai.

860098,3,6304392494,"I am a big fan of Kung-Fu movies, even the average ones. So, I checked this one out just for the [heck] of it. I was not sure what to expect, so I just watched it with an open mind. As this type of movie goes, it's the same old story. Guy seeks revenge for death of family members. Hey, I am not one to complain. As long as it's fun to watch, and has good fighting in it. I figure, I got my what I wanted. Iron Monkey was just that. Sure it's not the best Kung-Fu film by any means, but it is a fun one.
The Problem:  The company who made this DVD desurves to be beaten just like many of the bad guys in Iron Monkey. This is by far, the worst quality DVD I have ever watched. You can tell they just made it from an old VHS tape!  To make matters worse, the quality of the tape is just downright sad. The movie is watchable, but thats it. Now I am not sure what the story behind this movie is. Was the original print lost or what?  There is a part in the film where the English just stops, and Chinese starts. Then it goes back to english again. I am confused.
In final. Not a bad movie, but it feels like you are watching a bootleg. Don't waste your money.",1022716800,2,1156,3.869198312236287
860099,2,6304392494,"While there is no doubt that all the actors in the movie had extensive martial arts trainning, their talents were wasted in the badly choreographed fight scenes.

So don't expect this to be like the jet li movies where the fights were fast and hard.  I give a two star only because the plot had the potential of a great movie.",1001462400,5,499,4.461538461538462
