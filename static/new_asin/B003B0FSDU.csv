8393326,2,B003B0FSDU,"This is a ""B"" movie by 1941 standards. Need I say more? Keep reading if I do. No expense was spared as long as it didn't cost more than 2.00. Yes it is a British movie, but I suspect Great Britian would prefer to keep that tidbit secret.

The cockpit scenes were often pilot and passengers sitting in chairs with the instrument panel just out of sight.

To be fair there are fleeting glimpses of the aircraft carrier Ark Royal. However, at the time of filming she was fighting a war. I assume there was no time to shoot scenes onboard, other than a couple of take-offs and landings.",1457568000,,582,4.330275229357798
8393327,2,B003B0FSDU,My father who fought in the Fleet Air Arm (RNZNVR) in WWII saw this film in Edinburgh in March 1942 just after he had been commissioned and on his way to his first posting.'A very poor story and film' he wrote in his diary. But I will probably buy it for its historical interest,1370476800,,278,4.166666666666667
