8692181,4,B00QN6LGMQ,This movie is a documentary filmed in 1944 following a fighter squadron using the Thunderbolt fighter bombers based in Corsica. The mission was to strangle the supply routes to the Germans in Italy. Cameras mounted in all parts of the planes were used to shoot the footage. This film is a fascinating look at the day-to-day lives of the airmen and their maintenance crews at the base and also the action during the missions they flew. This is an interesting film well worth watching.,1511049600,,483,4.761904761904762

8692183,5,B00QN6LGMQ,"I've watched this movie 3 or 4 times.  It's excellent.  It very similar in style to the ""Why We Fight"" series.  I covers a fighter squadron in Sicily and their raids over Italy. What really amazed me was how young they were.  The Squadron CO is 22 or 23 years old.  The wing commander, the ""Old Man"" the guy running the entire wing is 27.

The photography is excellent.  How they mounted cameras and the photos they took was all new.

Please watch this movie.",1473379200,,459,4.317647058823529
8692184,3,B00QN6LGMQ,"As a follow-on to his highly acclaimed documentary THE MEMPHIS BELLE, the story of the B-17 bomber, Major William Wyler took on the task of accomplishing the same for an American World War II fighter aircraft, the P-47 Thunderbolt, arguably the best in the U.S. Army Air Forces. The documentary was filmed in 1944 during actuals combat and, though said to be the experiences of the 362 Fighter Group in Italy, the aircraft featured came from many fighter units. At the time of the filming, Jimmy Stewart was serving with the Eighth Air Force in England and had nothing to do with the film; this very late marketing of the film simply had him to do an introduction. Though Thunderbolt, as with The Memphis Belle, was an Army Air Forces propaganda film, by the time filming was completed, the war was won and the AAF saw little value in marketing the film and Wyler had to arrange private funds to produce the print. One final note: While much of the film came from cameras installed within and attached outside the aircraft, Wyler rode in a B-26 medium bomber filming from opened bomb bay doors. As a result, the rush of wind destroyed his hearing in one ear.",1430956800,,1158,4.599033816425121
