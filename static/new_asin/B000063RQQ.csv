1691575,4,B000063RQQ,"Cillian Murphy is not a new face to acting (well, at least, outside of Hollywood) and with this movie, you will understand what Mr. Murphy has in store in future films. He can truly act, even in a movie that may be slim of plot and writing. He takes what he is given and runs with it beautifully. He plays a suicidal young man who often contemplates what life holds for him as he stays in a mental institution. While there he meets two fellow troubled young people and through them he manages to find what life may be all about. A good cast, good soundtrack and an okay plot makes this film quite enjoyable.",1125446400,4,607,4.28695652173913
1691576,5,B000063RQQ,"Daring, humourous, and extremely emotional body of work about people and life. Murphy, Rhea, Vessey, and Jackson deliver a beautiful performance. You have to watch for yourself. Keeps you wondering enough about the lives of these characters to keep you watching. Had me teary eyed at the end, though I may be slightly biased b/c I love (thus far) the work Cillian Murphy does in general. Nice Soundtrack.",1124323200,2,404,4.955882352941177
1691577,5,B000063RQQ,"I highly recommend this movie. Cillian, Tricia and Jonathan are wonderful actors. The love story is beautiful. I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters. I found myself getting too much into the story, crying and totally wishing them a happy ending. The music throughout the movie heightens it also. Buy it, you'll love it too.",1121472000,,338,4.844827586206897
1691578,5,B000063RQQ,"'On The Edge' is an absolutely amazing movie... It has this perfect mix of melancholy and humor that is so touching and beautiful. It completely respects the real depth, pain and hopelessness of its characters, while providing a subtle sense of hope for viewers battling their own hopelessness. Cillian Murphy is charismatic and seductive in his role, totally flawless. I love this movie. Nothing shallow, superficial, hollywood or forced about this movie.",1119052800,2,456,5.347222222222222
1691579,5,B000063RQQ,"There's a moment early on in John Carney's ""On The Edge"" that serves to self-assuredly define itself as the alternative to the tired, Hollywoodized coming-of-age genre. In a scene between Jonathan (Cillian Murphy) and his psychologist (Stephen Rea), a chidingly defiant Murphy declares there won't be any ""Good Will Hunting"" moments between doctor and patient. True to his word as the movie is true to its central point about the fragility and the value of life, there aren't any. And the result is quite simply a breath of fresh air.
I won't bore you with plot points because I don't believe any self-respecting movie review should (hello Mr. Ebert). And anyway, like most good movies, ""On The Edge"" is the kind that should be watched with as little knowledge of the plot as possible so as to make its charm and impact that much more...charming and impactful.
Cillian Murphy (of ""28 Days Later"" fame) delivers a subtle, understated but no less brilliant performance as a young man quietly grappling with his fate, slowly coming to terms with the value and importance of his own life.
The script, often quirky and with a sometimes oddly upbeat feel for a movie that could have come off as an extreme downer, leaves plenty of room inbetween the lines for supporting actors Tricia Vessey and Jonathan Jackson to flex their more than capable acting muscles. Superlative acting vet Stephen Rea (""The Crying Game"") is perfectly cast as a psychologist with baggage that's never so much stated as it is implied in his countenance.
But it's Cillian Murphy that carries the movie with the effortlessness of ease, and a presence and ability that belies his years. Seeing Murphy at work, it's easy to forget you're watching a movie, and I can't recall a time that I've been more moved or captivated by the depth of emotion and compassion expressed by an actor in a mere reaction shot. It's downright fascinating to watch him steal scenes without uttering a word or twitching a muscle. But thief he is, whether he knows it or not, and it's one of the many things that adds an extra notch of respectability to a movie already rife with it.
No less miraculous and awe-inspiring is director John Carney, who in addition to co-writing the script also scored the original music and sang lead vocal on the final song--something I haven't heard of being done since Sylvester Stallone crooned the theme song for his directorial debut ""Paradise Alley"" back when he was still respectable.
""On The Edge"", although quite possibly a bit too emotionally heavy to watch time and time again, is without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen this year and is definitely worth a viewing.",1059609600,68,2662,4.789130434782609
1691580,5,B000063RQQ,"From the opening scene, it is evident you are watching a truly great movie.  The story is essentially ""boy interupted"" with a bonus love story but the cast and cinematography are superior. Cillian Murphy is a gifted actor and I look forward to seeing more from him in the future.  I highly recommend this movie, eventhough it would have been nice to have more special features since there are very few: bios, production notes and the trailer.",1040947200,,442,4.7272727272727275
1691581,5,B000063RQQ,What a great movie!  I wholeheartedly agree with previous review extolling the virtues of this film's simplicity!  The lead actor Cillian Murphy was excellent.  I loved the story and setting and ....man I just loved this movie.  There was a scene of the two lead characters standing against a blue ice cream truck with the guy holding bright orange creamsicles in his hands attempting to hug and console the  sobbing girl.  Wow!  It doesnt do it justice me describing it....I will definitely look forward to more movies from this director and cast.,1035504000,12,548,4.891304347826087
1691590,4,B000063RQQ,"Every once in a while, a film comes along with a common subject that is fashioned differently and feels like a breath of fresh air. 2001 Irish film  ""On the Edge"" is one of these movies.

The adorable Cillian Murphy, (Batman Begins), stars as Jonathan, a young man with a carefree, non-committal attitude towards life.  He has just lost his father and, after a night of debauchery, tries to commit suicide by driving his car off of a cliff with his father's ashes in the back seat.  Keeping with the light humor displayed throughout the story, though, Jonathan lives and his only wound is a broken pinky finger.  Because he tried to kill himself, he is offered the choice of a prison sentence or admission to a mental hospital.  He chooses the mental hospital.

At the hospital, which Jonathan clearly states he is treating as a vacation and nothing more, he is coached along by a psychologist, Dr. Figure, played by Stephen Rea, who ends up helping him deeply despite his first impression of the doctor.  Jonathan attends a group therapy session and ends up making friends with Toby, (Jonathan Jackson), another young man with a dark secret and Rachel, (Tricia Vassey), whom Jonathan immediately fancies but who creeps him out a bit with her turn-on of blood.

Over the course of the film, you can see how the bonds between these three people are deepened, with Dr. Figure fleshing out the picture and helping Jonathan despite his protests.  Toby harbors a crush on Rachel, which becomes more apparent when he writes a poem for her.  Jonathan defends Toby when he almost ends up in a violent fight at a bowling alley and Jonathan almost ends up paying for it.  This will be the first time that Dr. Figure steps in an tries to teach Jonathan that he needs to start valuing his own life, too.  Jonathan will learn that lesson by the end of the film, though, when his love for Rachel grows and, after a tragic circumstance, her parents take her out of the hospital.  Jonathan is miserable and worried and in the end, Dr. Figure helps him to achieve the one thing he desparately needs to do.

The acting in this film is rich, especially from Jonathan Jackson who is an American actor but flew to Ireland to make this film and took on the accent in an uncanny fashion.  Cillian Murphy is excellent as always, as is Stephen Rea, and the story is interesting enough to keep your attention.  It is sort of like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" meets a young adult drama, but without a lot of the melodramatic acting that usually comes along with it.  Plus, the soundtrack is a nice boost, starting out right up front with ""1979"" by the Smashing Pumpkins and includes ""Alright"" by Supergrass, ""Please Forgive Me"" by David Gray, and ""Is She Weird?"" by the Pixies, among other great songs.

If you were impressed with Cillian Murphy's performance as the Scarecrow in Batman Begins, you should definitely check out this film.  And even if you have no idea who he is, this is a charming film that takes place in psycho-therapy but doesn't make the whole film about that concept.  It is more of a focus on human behavior and relationships and what leads us to do what we do.",1251158400,3,3162,4.5808170515097695
1691591,5,B000063RQQ,"For anyone who has ever had a depressed friend, this movie can perhaps help you have better insight.  I didn't particularly like Cillian Murphy until I saw him in this movie.  I think this movie is for everyone who understands that emotions drive our lives, whether we want them to or not.",1208736000,,289,4.538461538461538
1691592,4,B000063RQQ,"A very good film.  While I never got the impression that the main character (a young teenage boy) was about to commit suicide, or shown any signs of commiting suicide (besides that car ride scene) his character was nonetheless quite impressive and very moving throughout the movie.  While at the psychiatric hospital, he met a girl he fell in love with instantly, and he quickly found out why she was in the hospital too (which is what makes the movie so good).

He also met other people who he seemed to get along with quite well, though throughout the film he had a psychiatrist trying to help him, though honestly, I never got the impression the boy even needed help.  He seemed more like a regular kid with a few problems that could have easily been solved just by having someone get close to him and talk, and sending him to a mental hospital was a bit extreme.  That's the impression I got throughout the film because for the most part, his character was quite normal.

His acting was really good though.  You cared about which direction his life was taking whenever he encountered that girl, and you wanted to see what happened when he was about to get into major fights with people at bars or bowling alleys.  A movie well worth watching.",1190937600,2,1246,4.53125
1691593,2,B000063RQQ,"On the edge was a good plot for a movie. But was poorly acted, and over all poorly done, if you are looking for a good drama, as I said the plot was great, but the acting bore me.",1172188800,,179,3.6153846153846154
1691594,5,B000063RQQ,Cullian Murphy is my new obsession. He is a wonderful actor and I love his diversity. What ever role I see him in he makes me forget i'm watching a movie. He's a breath of fresh air to Hollywood and I hope he continues to accept good roles instead of the big budget anyone can play that type role. I never really paid much attention to Jonathan until this movie and Trish either. Both were excellent. I buy very few movies because usually once I watch a movie I never need to see it again. This is one I bought. The acting is top notch and  the story really good not your typical hollywood crap. It's well worth the money.,1171670400,,622,4.183333333333334
1691595,5,B000063RQQ,"Cillian Murphy, Tricia Vessey and Jonathan Jackson are very convincing in their roles as tormented souls who have failed to achieve the precarious balance that most humans find that keeps them most of the time away from the brink of desolation that young people find themselves peering over, as shown so well by the lens in the last sequence of ""On the Edge"".  What brings them to this ""brink"" - and what saves them from it - are the mysteries that those who delve in the dark, murky waters of human depression and mental health find.  This movie has explored, and not so deeply as to crush the viewer in morbid thought, these things and provided both tragedy and hope, all in a beautifully written and well-performed script.

While Stephen Rea is anything but dynamic in his role, his seemingly single dimension is actually a statement to the fact that far more often than not, there is nothing that can be done but to give these folks a little time to decide to try to live -- another day.",1170633600,2,991,4.5251396648044695
1691596,5,B000063RQQ,"At every turn during ""On the Edge"", you will be delighted and moved and horrified and amused when you discover the sheer jewels of dialogue and facial expressions and quirky but real human responses to the burdens they bear.  They - the jewels of acting and writing and cinemetography - came so unexpectedly that each moment was as rich as the last.  I'm so surprised both Cillian Murpny and Tricia Vessey aren't more prominent in the USA. They have enormous talent.  ""On The Edge"" - because of the inestimable talent of its actors - is a warm, funny, tragic, lovely jewel in the rough - a rare find.  The music is terrific too.  Is there a soundtrack CD?  I'd buy it tomorrow.",1133740800,10,677,4.508196721311475
1691597,3,B000063RQQ,The movie is only good because of Cilian Murphy.  It is funny and mental.  Good movie for a boring day.,1129420800,4,103,4.1
1691598,5,B000063RQQ,"The movie may be generally thought of as a drama, but it has a lot of comedic elements. On the Edge has a beautiful way of dealing with serious issues such as mental health and emotional dependency.

  All of the actors and actresses delivered outstanding performances; you would think that Cillian Murphy had been in movies his entire life. It's amazing that this film is virtually unheard of in the states.

  Simply put, it's a fantastic film, and I'm glad that I purchased it.",1127606400,11,480,4.654761904761905
1691599,3,B000063RQQ,"Sorry but I have to go against all the positive reviews given this movie.  I will however agree whole heartedly with everyone about the captivating acting of Cillian Murphy and Jonathan Jackson but the story line is so bland.  Murphy's eyes reveal emotion whether it be sadness, humor, irony or anger.  Jackson in my opinion had the better of the two roles.  His heart wrenching revelation about his brother's death moved me to tears but that was about the only thing that did.  Boo Hoo, these teens have problems....give me some background information on each rather than a sentence uttered now and then giving the viewer a clue of what their problems are. I might have felt more compassion for them.  Let's see at least one indepth therapy session or some constructive help from the other patients in place of all the excessive hugging.  Admittedily a hug helps now and then but this movie has more hugs than Rose yelling ""Jack"" in Titanic. Stephen Rea, my Irish favorite actor, could have telephoned his part in.  And imagine my surprise to see Gerald McSorley in two tiny scenes in which he didn't utter a single word.  What a waste of these men's talents.

I'm glad to add this to my collection of Irish Film Board approved films but it won't be one I watch over and over.",1126224000,3,1277,4.610619469026549

7959633,4,B000063RQQ,"Cillian Murphy has been in Red Eye, Disco Pigs, and even the Dark Knight Trilogy. With his smooth voice and penetrating blue eyes, I expected a lot when I read about this movie in which Murphy's character (SPOILER ALERT) tries to commit suicide after his father dies. He's then taken to a therapy session in which the other members have tried suicide as well, and failed. through this movie, there becomes a tangled love story in which two people love the same girl, and I think Murphy is in his game. When this movie is watched, the audience can't expect a lot of WOW happening because the plot itself is so down to earth. No time bombs, no plane threats, and not even a Batman but still, this movie is worth watching even to feel a little homey.",1370908800,,747,4.420289855072464

The picture that is shown and the description is correct, but I received on the edge with ICE T, some shoot em up movie were ICE T is maybe a detective or who the hell knows.

But, I did come across it and decided to watch the preview for this movie. I HAD to see this movie after watching the preview. It is definately a good movie. And I love Cillian Murphy in it, I don't think they could of found anyone better. Though it is a bit of a sad movie, its one worth watching. Maybe even watching twice for.",1343088000,,469,4.280898876404494
