8717805,3,B000BCE93Q,"I wanted to get fight club and I wasn't THAT interested in the special features on the second disc, so I just decided to get this set and post whether the first reviewer was right.  He is correct.  The Fight Club/Kiss of the Dragon set includes the SINGLE DISC version of Fight Club.  Hope this helps someone out.  I only gave it three stars because fight club is a great movie but I haven't seen Kiss of the Dragon yet.",1155686400,2,420,4.2125
8717806,3,B000BCE93Q,"This set looks like a great deal: the dual disc version of Fight Club, plus a Jet Li movie for a few more bucks.

I was a little skeptical, however, and looking at some other websites, I found that the picture showed the single disc version of Fight Club, not the dual disc as pictured here.  It is uncertain which the set actually contains at this point, so buyer beware.",1135036800,8,372,4.3
