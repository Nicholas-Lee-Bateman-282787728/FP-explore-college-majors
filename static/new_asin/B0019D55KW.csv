8273593,3,B0019D55KW,"According to her father's will, a fiercely independent young woman (Rhonda Fleming) must marry immediately in order to retain control of her father's estate and business. To this end, with the aid of a corrupt judge, she marries a man (Guy Madison) about to be hanged to fulfill her father's last wishes. But when he escapes from jail, he follows her and demands his place as her husband. Directed by Harmon Jones, this would ordinarily be a nondescript routine ""pass the time"" western. What makes it so disturbing, even repugnant, is the systematic humiliation and domineering of the woman by the cocky and arrogant man in an attempt to break her independent spirit and take control. It's the most sexist western I've ever seen in that respect. Madison is adequate and Fleming looks breathtaking in color and CinemaScope but the unsavory aspects of the story dampen whatever enjoyment one might ordinarily have. The title song, with whip cracks and all, is by Frankie Laine, who else? I wonder if Mel Brooks saw BULLWHIP as the title song from BLAZING SADDLES, also sung by Laine sounds quite similar.

The Suevia DVD from Spain is in its original CinemaScope (2.35) ratio in an anamorphic transfer. The picture is fine but the sound has a slightly hollow tone to it. Although from Spain, my copy had the credits in German! The Spanish subtitles are easily disabled.",1298505600,2,1367,4.866952789699571
