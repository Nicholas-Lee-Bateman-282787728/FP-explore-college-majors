8573910,2,B00BUAEZMS,"Let me start by saying the animation is great.  Really great.  This is a good thing, because other than that - and a few very entertaining action scenes - I really dislike this film.  I'll confess that some of my reasons are mine alone and may not be shared by others, but still, I just can't watch this thing.  It's pretentious, dull (except for the previously mentioned action scenes), and pretty much runs counter to many of the things I enjoy about Lupin III.

As I'm recalling, I had to wade through over 45 minutes of genuine boredom before anything of any note happened.  I blame the pointless non-linear timeline for a lot of that.  Why is that even happening here?  Non-linear storylines are complex and need to be handled very carefully (see ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Memento"" for how it's done) or they just come off as confusing and - dare I say it again - pretentious.  They need to be there for a discernible reason.  That is not the case here.  They seem to be doing it just 'cause, and that's simply not good enough.  All it does in this film is render the pacing truly abysmal.

The movie is also rife with WTF moments, and I'm not talking about the good kind where you point at the screen and spray your drink down your front in a gale of laughter at the sheer absurdity of what you're seeing.  That's a great Lupin III WTF moment.  No, I mean where you sit there with your mouth hanging open saying ""WTF just happened...?"" because something is completely incomprehensible.  Bad WTF moment, very naughty.  No biscuit for you.

Then there's the thing that really shot it all down for me.  'Lupin' is just a title and Lupin's closest friends would utterly abandon him just because some punk got lucky?  We're talking about a gang of criminals who, on the surface, are actually some pretty reprehensible people but who are redeemed by their camaraderie and friendship.  Now we're going to toss all that just because someone thinks it equates to an 'update'?  So what we're saying here is that redemption is outdated and what we need is shallow, self-involved jerk-ness.  Total rubbish.  I think I'll take mine old-fashioned, thanks.

Hate this movie... I should give it one star...",1400544000,5,2190,4.61139896373057
8573911,4,B00BUAEZMS,"In many ways this Lupin movie is both a tribute to the four decades of Lupin shows, movies, and manga AND a contemplation of what it means to be Lupin.  There is a great scene in which dozens of Lupins drop what they are doing to head to Tokyo.  Lupin fans will have fun catching all the references to past movies and shows.  While the ""many Lupins"" of the movie were a bit confusing at first, it gives the makers of this film a chance to play with the idea of the pursuit of ultimate freedom and mystique embodied by a persona that many wish to adopt.  The plot involving the ""ice cube"" diamond does not completely come together by the end, unfortunately.  And while it will never be my favorite Lupin movie, I certainly enjoyed watching it.  Three and a half stars sounds about right to me, but I'll round up to four.",1392508800,2,819,4.285714285714286
8573912,1,B00BUAEZMS,"Opinions on this film are polarised, apparently. I'm not one of the ""it's so obscure it must be great"" camp. I found it pointless and boring and a waste of my anime-buying dollars.

In Green vs Red (GvR) the setting has updated to the contemporary, so cellphones abound while Lupin drives a Bambina or his other classic ride. There's a retired guy who may be the real Lupin, an ageing but near-timeless Zenigata, and pointless tributes to past Lupin opponents. Nothing zips, nothing gets a laugh, and do you know why?

They basically tossed all the storyboards into the air, reassembled them as they fell, and that's the film sequence. It's not clever. It's not entertaining. I fell asleep several times. There's no revelation and again, no humour.

Any of the old Lupin films - and I include Mamo in this - are better than this dreck.",1381708800,12,835,4.666666666666667
