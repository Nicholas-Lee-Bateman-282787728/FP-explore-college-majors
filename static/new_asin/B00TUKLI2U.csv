7022580,1,B00TUKLI2U,What a waste!,1426032000,2,13,3.6666666666666665
7022581,5,B00TUKLI2U,"This was an absolute joy to watch and seen such development of everyone from the first Witch Graveyard movie.  It honestly has a really good story to it and the actors delivered it on target.  I would highly recommend this version of the film along with a little extra added in from someone who is truly becoming a remarkable Director by the name of Reuben Rox.
Rox along with his actors really made this one for true fans of Indie Horror that enjoy something different from the larger Hollywood Big Budget Films and going back to the basics of Film Production.
As well there are two incredible actors in Catherine Franklin and Rachel Wise along with Rox who really help develop and improve this film as they continue to grow in their skills as actors with everything they do.
The supporting cast was very good this time and I can see all of these people continuing to make great productions for many years to come.
If you truly enjoy Indie Horror, unique stories along with beautiful as well as talented actors in Franklin and Wise then this is something you should check out!",1425945600,,1077,4.575129533678757

7022583,1,B00TUKLI2U,"Absolutely awful. Don't waste your money. Terrible acting. Bad sound. I have a feeling that it could have been good with better actors. The scenery was very nice but even so, I couldn't get more than 1/2 way through before turning it off.",1425600000,2,238,4.558139534883721
7022584,3,B00TUKLI2U,"Being the Horror completist geek that I am, had to check out both versions. This version has a few extended scenes and what seems to be an alternate scene where a tree bites a girl's arm not seen in the Director's Cut.

This in-name-only sequel follows a reporter and several others entering the land were witches were supposedly killed and buried.
Some of the acting was pretty stiff, but it isn't too distracting. The first half is pretty much all talk and exposition. Once the gals go to the graveyard and separate, the strangeness begins and the gals, along with few others get bumped off one by one by the witches lurking in the woods.

This being low budget there were audio issues during the movie. You can hear the spoken dialog fine, there's just some hiss present.

This version does not include the short film included in the Director's Cut.",1425513600,2,852,4.629139072847682
7022585,4,B00TUKLI2U,"A step in the right direction. This in-name-only sequel follows a reporter and several others entering the land were witches were supposedly killed and buried.
Some of the acting was pretty stiff from one of the leads, but it isn't too distracting. The first half is pretty much all talk and exposition, but not too boring as the characters keep changing locations. Once the gals go to the graveyard and separate, the strangeness begins and the characters start getting bumped off by the witches.

This being low budget there were audio issues in the beginning of the movie. You can hear the spoken dialog fine, there's just some hiss present. Some outdoor scenes were a bit pixelated for a few seconds, but this could be Amazon or my internet speed.

The included short film was fun.",1425427200,,784,4.757352941176471

7022591,4,B00TUKLI2U,"Not bad decent plot like the actors the blond girl is my fav. Why is it that when they hear a place is spooked they go there anyway not me but then I am a wuss muwhahaha. This has lots of subtle's throughout yes it has blood and gore but only moderately not much violence other then in the killing parts. Would I watch it again? Nope it's not really something I'd go back to, but they did do a good job. Here's a sample girl passes by a stuffed toy sitting under a tree blood runs out of it's eyes",1428537600,2,497,3.9306930693069306
7022592,3,B00TUKLI2U,"This is a film only for people that enjoy low-budget horror films. There's low budget, then there's no-budget, this might be even below that... it shows that mostly in its poor sound mix. Photographically it looks pretty good, lots of interesting shots. Reuben Rox writes, directs & stars, he's got a very unique voice and a fun screen presence. I feel like with a decent crew behind him, he could turn out some really fun horror films in the future.  Right now I think he might just be him doing it all himself, but he's fun enough that I'll keep an eye on him.",1427155200,,562,4.403846153846154
7022593,1,B00TUKLI2U,"Horrible, just pure crap.  Long title, bad audio (constant hissing), bad acting, no eye candy (pretty girls), tedious, bad directing, and bad make-up (one of the lead females appeared to have a moustache most of the time).  The T&A mentioned in other reviews lasts about ten seconds.  Save your money, do not watch.  Any positive reviews must come from the cast and crew of this film, or other people paid to write a positive review.",1427155200,2,433,4.733333333333333
7022594,4,B00TUKLI2U,"Low (and I mean low) budget horror flick isn't going to win any awards and doesn't really kick-in until the 30-minute mark. Before that there is a lot of talk about some missing people and some witches.

The unknown cast isn't as horrible as some of the reviewers before me claim and they weren't stereotypically portrayed or unlikeable. The camera work in the beginning wasn't the best, I agree with that, but as the movie progresses it gets better.

6 or 7 bodies, 4 vintage breasts, some decent music and just enough plot to keep things moving. Overall, I liked it.",1426291200,,568,4.6138613861386135
7022595,1,B00TUKLI2U,That was one of the worst things I've ever seen.  The plot itself had potential but that went right out the window with the awful acting.  Do NOT waste your money or time with this one and pay no attention to the high ratings given.  A disappointment.,1426204800,3,251,4.297872340425532

8703123,1,B00TUKLI2U,"Oh this movie was sooooo irritatingly bad and very boring.  The odd accents with the very very bad acting was just too much to handle.  (I know it is their real accents it just was very out of place and made their conversations just that more hard to listen to, it did not mesh.  This is why actor actresses and models are taught to speak english without an accent unless it is necessary for the part.)  The whole movie was pretty much these people running around this graveyard in circles with these witches or something chasing and killing them.  The costumes for the ""witches"" was horrible, it pretty much consisted of a halloween rubber hand and a black cape, they did not show anything else.  I would not call that scary or entertaining, just very very bad.  Even on a zero budget I could come up with something better than that with no experience and so could  my 9 and 11 year old daughters, oh so so bad.  Save yourself and run away very far from this movie, it is dreadful!!!",1471219200,,984,4.392265193370166
8703124,1,B00TUKLI2U,"Well, that's time I'll never get back... This ""movie"" is hands down one of the worst I have seen in a long time. And based on what I've watched in the last month, that is NOT a compliment! The writer/director/actors really need a better job, because this is *not* the career for them. The editing too, woah...

One scene in particular made me laugh. Jonathan (some moronic web show host who debunks ghost stories) sits in front of a laptop in what appears to be a spare room at a library, or something acting as their office (which is funny on it's own based on the inactivity, etc). There's a window overlooking a street, and a guy walks by. Normally that's not a problem, however, if your editor is drunk, incompetent, or just plain clueless, it makes for issues. In the first scene you see him, he's walking at a normal pace. BUT, he only takes a few steps across the window, and poof! He magically teleports himself across to the other side! And when we see the same window later, he walks by again this time the whole length, and seemingly in reverse!

The acting is beyond rigid, and to be as nice as it deserves; incredibly horrid. Seriously, my niece's 2nd grade play of ""The Ugly Duckling"" had less issues! The acting wasn't nearly as forced, either. However, in Return To Witch Graveyard, the writing sucks (at best), the directing is a joke, and the special effects and editing are laughable, at the very best. My guess is that they had a $50 budget, and went to a discount Halloween store for party favors, and leftover costume accessories as props. The evil hands you see are clearly from a cheap costume, which made me laugh when I first saw a finger bend upward as it brushed against some incredibly bad actress' head. Actually, to say she (and everyone else in this thing) was incredibly bad is a gross understatement, and a slap in the face to bad actors worldwide!

The soundtrack though? You might be thinking, ""At least the music's gotta be decent, right?"" Wrong. A few note progression that goes nowhere, is repetitive, and is just lame does not help an already steaming pile. Remember when I mentioned how bad the editing was? The soundtrack edits were *no* better. The music just cuts off completely in spots, and does nothing for the movie when it does play.

The funniest part about this ""movie"", in my opinion was not only the crappy fonts used in the credits, but how they suggest you stay tuned at the end for a bonus short... First, it bleeds off into a blooper reel that, even though stale, and unfunny, was almost better than the feature. Next we get to that bonus short... ... ... ... No. Ok, you guys ruined this enough, why continue? It's more or less the story all over again, minus the witch, and they're ""making a movie"" (as they tell another terrible actress who wanders into shot). The thing is though, that it's almost like the ""bonus"" short was probably the first draft of the stinker we just sat through to get here!

There is a very specific reason for a 1 star rating percentage of around 62%. This movie sucks. That is the only thing you can really say about it. I noticed the 7.1 rating on the imbd, but I'm very skeptical that it's from outside sources. I would sooner think that the cast and crew, friends and or relatives have done a fine job at raising a rating that is not only not deserved, but laughable! I also suspect that any rating above 1 star here on Amazon, and any down votes to this review are probably from these same people! Sure, some folks MIGHT like it, but some folks also MIGHT enjoy a root canal, or other invasive and likely unmedicated dental work.

There are enough bad reviews here to warn anyone, but if you're like me, you probably want to see for yourself.

Go for it! But, might I recommend a book, or maybe a game on your phone, computer, or whatever to help pass the time?",1470873600,,3852,4.463068181818182

8703126,2,B00TUKLI2U,"Return To With Graveyard: The Director's cut. Yeah, I know. But what's in a name?  Here, (exactly 5 minutes in) one of main characters is perusing a file and is looking at a page... upside down.
You would think that this 2-3 second bit of sadness/hilariousness might have been cut in the director's cut. Alas no. Maybe the original scene was longer where she held it up and read aloud from the page while it was upside down. Eesh.",1469318400,2,430,4.443037974683544
