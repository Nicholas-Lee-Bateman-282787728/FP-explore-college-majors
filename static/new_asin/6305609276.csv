1052893,5,6305609276,I had seen this video many years ago and always wanted a copy.  It sports a cast of famous and not so famous characters.  It is a statement on the human condition and mans resilience in the face of hardships that would make Jobe surrender.,1228003200,,239,4.288888888888889
1052894,5,6305609276,"This documentary should not be down-graded due to its lack of narration.  The lack of commentary is exactly what makes this such a unique piece of work and all the more memorable and fascinating.

I think the film is compelling enough to motivate those who may not fully understand the history of the Great Depression to learn more, which will only enhance their next viewing.",1146096000,8,376,4.769230769230769
1052895,4,6305609276,"My father introduced me to this doc. when I was fairly young, and I loved it at even a young age. It combines news and movie clips that flow together wonderfully with period music (alot of great Woody Guthrie) The end is lacking as it jumps raggedly into the next 20 years and then ends, but on a whole it is a great film! (I introduced it to many of my history teachers as an alternative to poorly acted educational films.)",1124496000,2,424,4.246913580246914
1052896,3,6305609276,"There is great documentary, movie, and news footage in this film, however, the lack of commentary is frustrating.  I was expecting something that would give more of the history of the period, rather than just showing footage.  The lack of narration left me questioning the history and context of the footage being shown.  Narration, or even captions, would have been effective.  The footage that is shown, however, is excellent and would probably be much appreciated by someone who is familiar with this time period.",1120694400,5,516,5.107142857142857
1052897,3,6305609276,"Although this documentary brings together a lot of interesting footage, lack of a commentary means that a viewer without a close knowledge of the period in question will find themselves wondering, ""Who were those people, and why was what they were doing of historical significance?"" On the other hand, if you are very familiar with the politics and culture of the US in the 1930s, this may provide some useful illustrative imagery. I suspect that, these days, more people will fall into the first category.",1053302400,15,506,4.964705882352941
1052898,5,6305609276,"Shows the real down in the trenches struggle of America during the depression.  In our times of prosperity and wealth, we sometimes forget it wasn't so long ago that money was almost impossible to come by, soup lines were many peoples only source of survival and life without all the gadgets and other pleasures we take for granted is very tough.

7892213,5,6305609276,"One of my all time favorite movies.  Have watched it many times.  That's because I was born in 1927 and was growing up during the
Great Depression.  This movie is about half facts and half Hollywood Ballyhoo and and if you haven't lived in my time period and seen
a lot of early movies you will sometimes find it hard to separate the two.  This depression was before half the country was drawing
government checks  so it was a lot tougher than today.  I highly recommend this movie",1462147200,,481,4.409090909090909
7892214,5,6305609276,"I bought this because I already have the VHS tape version. This version has a few more scenes and is worth the price.
A minor complaint I have (Personal preference, really) is that when the movie ""takes us back to the 1970's"" this version has the soundtrack from the footage playing softly. This is kind of distracting; the tape only plays the music, which I think is better. Also, the end credits on the tape have the MUSIC credits with all the songs and artists featured in the movie and Ronnie Lane and the Hard Chance Band playing the title song.
One last thing that needs to be brought up: they feature Humphrey Bogart in ""The Black Legion"" and most people think this was a depiction of the KKK. In reality, the KKK was all but disbanded by the 1930's; there really was a copy-cat organization called ""the black legion"".",1433635200,,825,4.506666666666667

7892216,5,6305609276,Excellent Video and it was in pefect condition. It covered all the incidents during the Great Depression that I remember so well. Glad I bought it.,1386028800,,147,4.6923076923076925

7892218,5,6305609276,Great anthropology of the Great Depression.  I think this was an HBO special I saw about 10 years ago.  There are some classic scenes from some great movies and some wonderful pieces of nostolgia from that period.,1348358400,,213,4.72972972972973
7892219,5,6305609276,"As of 2/12, no matter which format you seek an authorized copy of BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE A DIME in (UK-1975), it's selling for ""collectable"" prices, even as a used item. Unfortunate, as this is one of the most outstanding and unique documentaries ever made. Outstanding for its brilliant editing and non-stop pastiche of snapshots, movie and newsreel clips; unique for reanimating the years 1929 to '41 without a single word of obtrusive narration.

Most footage here has rarely been seen since the Thirties. Among these clips are: a phalanx of ""G-men"" firing hundreds of tommy gun bullets into a doomed sedan; a fat man stopping a cannonball with his gut, not once but many times; an eyewitness describing Huey Long's assassination; a serious lad of maybe 12 who names all 48 states in a single huge breath; rioting FORD plant strikers and the small civil war that ensued; a cartoon Clark Gable doing the conga; Dust Bowl devastation; jitterbug contestants going all-out; John Dillinger on the coroner's table; Jimmy Cagney (a central theme) in several of his pictures. And always, there's Frankiin Roosevelt. We watch with the passage of years his transformation from late middle-aged vigor early in 1933 (""fear itself"") to a frail and world-weary elder taking America into WWII late in '41 (""day which will live in infamy"").

Music excerpts are as memorable as the visuals they accompany. A partial list:
Bei Mir Bist Du Schn - Andrews Sisters; Big Rock Candy Mountain - Harry McClintock; We're in the Money - Ginger Rogers; California, Here I Come - Al Jolson; You're the Top - Ethel Merman; Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out - Bessie Smith; Jeepers Creepers - Louis Armstrong; Ten Cents a Dance - Ruth Etting; Now's the Time to Fall in Love - Eddie Cantor; Zaz Zuh Zaz - Cab Calloway; Dust Can't Kill Me (also) Vigilante Man - Woody Guthrie; Saddest Tale (Blues) - Billie Holiday; Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day) - Bing Crosby. ""Der Bingle"" also performs the title song, as do Rudy Vallee and Al Jolson.

With its cast of literally hundreds --famous, unknown and infamous-- plus a judiciously chosen and skillfully assembled chronology of film clips, BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE A DIME distinctly succeeds at conveying a sense of the 1930s to viewers born long after that decade's passing. For those who remember all or part of the Great Depression, it's a bittersweet stroll down memory lane with the familiar shadows of that momentous era.",1327536000,,2471,4.836879432624113

For 6th graders (and below) they really couldn't follow along with the format of the film. Some events were familiar, but all in all, they were a bit bored due to being lost. The film itself is great. But not for elementary aged students.",1239580800,3,410,4.337662337662338
