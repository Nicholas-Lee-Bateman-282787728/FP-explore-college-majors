2916308,5,B000U1ZV4E,"I think most people miss the point of Full House. It's apparent corniness and cheesiness is part and parcel of what it is. As Dave Coulier once said, the Tanners are a ""G-rated dysfunctional family"". They're not perfect and the aforementioned corniness was a mainstay of the 80's and early 90's sitcoms. It's basically a teriffic family show and certainly something kid-safe.

All that being said, while I find myself disappointed in the lack of special features, for the most part of it, you get all the uncut episodes. But then, that's the question. Are they REALLY uncut? I think most of them are because I remember most of the 8th season's missing scenes that they cut out in syndication. I do have a feeling, however, that there are still some things missing. Like in ""Michelle Rides Again (pt. 2), I seem to recall a hospital waiting room scene. Or I could just be confusing a different show for this one. Also, at the end of ""Michelle Rides Again (pt. 1)"", they show a clip of the family minus Michelle having a discussion about whether or not she'll ever get her memory back. This had to be after the Michelle actually comes home. Does anyone know if that was a full scene that was in the original airing of the episode? I also suspect that this scene was taped but likely never made the second part of the episode due to length (gotta make room for those commercials. Ugh). Anything's possible. I'd love it if Warner Bros. would release all the excess footage and make a DVD out of it. Full House: Rarities and Extras. Yeah, I'd buy that.

Anyway, this is an excellent DVD of what was a great show that would definitely remain popular for generations to come. So if you're a Full House fan, get this DVD. If you're a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen fan, these DVDs are a great chance to see them when they were much younger.",1195257600,15,1828,4.503012048192771
2916309,5,B000U1ZV4E,I love the DVD. It is nice to watch. I love Bob Saget and the other 2 guys in the show.,1194998400,2,87,3.1904761904761907

2916311,5,B000U1ZV4E,Lastima que esta sea la ltima temporada. Me encanta esta serie!  Me lo he pasado genial viendola.  Yo ya hice la pre-order de la 8 temp. a qu esperas t para tenerlas todas tambin? Regalatela!,1191024000,3,191,4.428571428571429
2916312,5,B000U1ZV4E,"This is the very good final season of Full House, and it is full of all the trademark family quality from previous seasons.  As usual it may not be for everybody and it won't work if you're not in the right mood, but when it hits you just so it's perfect.  Unfortunately, all good things must come to and end and for one reason or another this was it for Full House.  Clearly the show will live on forever through reruns and be popular for generations to come hopefully, and you never know-there could always be a reunion or a revival or something somewhere down the road.  But for now and for those of us who have been collecting, be sure to get and enjoy the final season, and then maybe re-watch the whole show some time.",1189123200,22,724,4.262773722627737
2916313,5,B000U1ZV4E,"Even though this show has always been on the corny side, Full House is still an enjoyable show. Defintely one of my guilty pleasures and the complete eighth season is the final installment of this surprisely loved show. My favorite episode from this season is Dateless in San Franciso. I admit I used to love this show like crazy and don't you love the sappy melodramatic music that pops up at the last five minutes of every episode, it's hilarious! I can't believe how fast each season has come out and I'm sure fans of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are the main ingredigent for the success of the DVD sales. I highly recommend purchasing the eighth and every season of this sappy but entertaining show. Enjoy!",1187395200,22,708,4.626984126984127
2916314,5,B000U1ZV4E,"This is the episode list for Full House Season 8!

1. Comet's Excellent Adventure
Jesse is so self absorbed in his own problems with ""The Rippers"" that he mistakenly tells Michelle she can walk the dog by herself.

2. Breaking Away
Letting go of your babies is hard to do as Jesse and Becky find out when it's time for the boys to go to pre-school.

3. Making out is Hard to Do
Jesse's competitive streak is unleashed when he learns that the Rippers' new lead singer has brought more success to the band than Jesse ever did. This experience prompts Jesse to get serious and form a new band of his own. When invited to her friend Gia's place for a party, Stephanie arrives armed with Pictionary--but the events of this gathering prove to be quite different than what Stephanie expected.

4. I've Got a Secret
What good is a secret club if it's not a secret. Danny spills the secret that Michelle told him about their secret club. Michelle gets kicked out of the club because of it.

5. To Joey, With Love
When your substitute teacher is somebody you live with, it's hard to maintain a fine line between the two. This is the case when Michelle--whose third grade class is in need of a substitute--begs Joey to fill the position. Eager to work with the children and be a good role model, Joey does his best to make a good impression, but when class begins, all the kids want is a free comedy session. When their out-of-control behavior prompts Joey to get tough, he ends up sending Michelle to the principal's office--a decision that places a serious damper on their close bond. Meanwhile, Jesse reluctantly agrees to let Danny audition as a guitarist for his new band, but what Jesse doesn't realize is that this longtime king of spic and span also knows how to rock 'n roll!

6. You Pet it, You Bought it
Remember how you used to be lucky if you scored a couple dollars from your sidewalk lemonade stand? Well, after earning a cool $221.00 with her own stand, Michelle heads straight to the candy store--but gets sidetracked and comes home with a donkey. Danny agrees to let her keep it until morning, which results in a long, loud evening that is only calmed when Jesse stays up all night serenading ""Shorty"" with a certain television theme song. The family narrowly survives this grueling time with Shorty, and although Michelle is sad to part with him, she decides it is best to send him to a more appropriate home.

7. On the Road Again
Many things are not the same as we remember them from our youth. This is the case for Jesse when his new band tours and he returns to his old motel room. And he sees it's a dump.

8. Claire and Present Danger
As Danny starts spending more time with Claire, Stephanie and Gia fantasize about the possibility of becoming stepsisters. Michelle, however, is not quite ready for these types of changes, and her methods of sabotaging her father's latest relationship are both shocking and hilarious. Meanwhile, DJ experiences some troubles in her own love life when her boyfriend Viper begins feeling threatened by her intellectually.

9. Stephanie's Wild Ride
You know getting more mature when you not only hear that little voice inside you but you actually listen to it. Until then it's great to have somebody help you. Such is the case for Stephanie when she wants to put herself in danger and DJ stops her.

10. Under the Influence
Friends don't let other friends drive drunk. When Kimmy gets intoxicated at a party, DJ risks destroying their friendship when she refuses to let her get behind the wheel. While Kimmy is frustrated at being treated like a child, she may soften when she learns the emotional reason behind DJ's insistence. Meanwhile, after Michelle angrily snaps at the twins for getting in her way, she enlists the help of Jesse to make amends with them--a request that leads to unprecedented chaos in the Tanner kitchen!

11. Arrest Ye Merry Gentlemen
When she regrets purchasing a tacky Christmas gift for her father, Michelle convinces Jesse to take her back to the store on Christmas Eve for an exchange. Crotchety store owner Mr. Dreghorn is not very cooperative, however, and when Jesse and Michelle push him to the limit, he places them under arrest and locks them in the shop. Back at home, the family does their best to help the twins perceive Santa as something more than a frightening monster.

12. D.J's Choice
Stunned when Viper suddenly breaks up with her, DJ finds immediate comfort with former flame Nelson. As their common experiences with heartbreak help them reconnect romantically, DJ finds herself in a difficult situation when Viper returns, begging her to take him back. Meanwhile, an act of vandalism at the community playground prompts everyone in town to team up and repair the damage.

13. The Producer
Danny is initially delighted when Michelle takes interest in writing about him for a Take Your Daughter to Work assignment, especially since he is confident that his boss will be giving him a promotion. When he is snubbed for a producer position by Becky--who has not been working as long as him--Danny feels the pangs of jealousy and makes an impulsive decision to quit the show. When he is quickly replaced by the loud and obnoxious Phil Blankman, Danny's bottled-up resentment toward Becky leads to a sudden blow-up. Meanwhile, sugar lovers DJ and Stephanie have a face-off to see who can avoid sweets the longest, Nicky and Alex exasperate their parents with their frequent public tantrums, and Joey has difficulty coping when his favorite childhood snack is discontinued.

14. Super Bowl Fun Day
A promise made should be a promise kept. Joey should have kept his promise to take Michelle's science group to the science museum instead of a bar just to be able to watch the Super Bowl.

15. My Left and Right Foot
Some seemingly harmless teasing from DJ and Stephanie leaves Michelle feeling self-conscious about the size of her feet--but maybe some shrink wrap and ice water will help cut them down to size! Danny and Joey team up with Jesse to do a bedtime singing routine for the twins, just as they used to do with Michelle, but when Becky tries to join in, they have a hard time explaining to her that her ""unique"" singing voice doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the group.

16. Air Jesse
When she volunteers as a coach for a charity basketball game, DJ chooses Danny, Joey, and Jesse to play on her team. The only problem is that Jesse can barely dribble a ball (literally) and despite a cram practice session with the guys, he seems to be a hopeless case. But when a certain NBA sensation shows up at the basketball court, will he have what it takes to prepare Jesse for the big event? Meanwhile, Becky--who doesn't have the heart to be honest about a hideous blouse that Stephanie made for her at school--opts instead to sport it in public.

17. Dateless in San Francisco
As Danny prepares for his first Valentine's Day with Claire, Becky gets excited about what Jesse will have set up for them this year, but she is disappointed to find that he appears to be losing interest in being the ""King of Romance"" he once was. With this exciting day approaching, even Michelle's third grade class gets into the spirit. With their class party coming up, Lisa has the bright idea of pairing all the girls up with the boys, and Michelle and Teddy are placed together. Determined to turn up the heat a little bit, Michelle's efforts to push the romance only end up alienating Teddy. Joey, too, is having some relationship woes of his own; he has received a gift from a secret admirer, but he is afraid that it's from Mrs. Carruthers, the obnoxious woman who can't seem to keep herself away.

18. We Got the Beat
Practice makes perfect. When you don't practice you get what Stephanie and her newly formed band was at their debut.

19. Taking the Plunge
Crushed when she receives a rejection letter from Stanford University, DJ is left with a feeling of uncertainty about her future. Kimmy, who knows that DJ will still be attending an excellent school somewhere, is concerned about what will happen to their friendship when high school is over. Unable to cope with the idea of losing her best pal, Kimmy decides that her best option is to elope immediately with her plumber boyfriend Duane. When DJ catches wind of this, she and Nelson fly down to Reno and change her mind--but when she leaves a note for her father explaining her whereabouts, a freakish misunderstanding prompts a frantic Danny to believe that DJ and Nelson are the ones getting hitched! Meanwhile, Joey is excited for the opportunity to meet with Queen Elizabeth, but his improper etiquette at the reception leads to serious trouble.

20. Up On the Roof
DJ tries to pull the ultimate senior prank. She put the principal's car on the roof. Then it starts raining. But Principal Robolard doesn't mind it.

21. Leap of Faith
When an elderly yet feisty woman guest stars on Wake Up, San Francisco with spirited stories about her bungee jumping hobby, Becky is inspired to spice up her own life with this thrilling new experience. Upset to learn that Becky is seriously going through with this, Jesse does his best to talk her out of it, but his efforts only result in friction between the couple. Meanwhile, when Michelle convinces Danny to let her attend a concert with DJ. Stephanie--who was originally supposed to go with her older sister--conspires with DJ and forces Michelle to surrender, but will the girls soften when they realize the real reason why their baby sister wanted to attend the show so much?

22. All Stood Up
After rising past the embarrassment to ask a hunky classmate to a school dance, Stephanie is crushed when Ryan stands her up on the night of the event. Seeing his daughter in such pain is more than Danny can handle, and when his rage is unleashed, he confronts Ryan directly, giving the young man a thing or two to think about regarding his selfish behavior. Ryan stuns Stephanie by apologizing and asking if they can start fresh, but what will she do when she recognizes her father's role in all of this? Meanwhile, as Michelle gets increasingly frustrated over DJ's ability to beat her in everything, the 8-year-old is forced to get downright devious in order to come out on top. Jesse is advised by his doctor to lower his blood pressure, but with a certain person named Kimmy Gibbler living right next door, relaxation is not as simple as it sounds!

23. Michelle Rides Again (1)
Changes are on the horizon for the Tanner clan as this 2-part season finale begins. High school senior DJ is planning to forego prom night, which sends Kimmy on a chase to find her best friend a date. Former business partners Jesse and Joey have the opportunity to appear on live television with professional wrestlers, but this is hardly the type of material they are used to working with. Stephanie is rehearsing a portion of Romeo and Juliet with a handsome classmate, but she doesn't understand why he always freezes up during the kissing scene. Lastly, Michelle is excited when Danny gives her permission to participate in a horseback riding competition, but the pressure to win results in a terrifying accident.

24. Michelle Rides Again (2)
At the hospital, everyone is relieved to learn that Michelle is clear of any serious danger. Unfortunately, her head injury has resulted in amnesia, and nobody is sure when her memory will return. Upon Michelle's arrival back at home, the family tries to help by surrounding her with familiar things, but the experience creates mostly fear and frustration for Michelle. Meanwhile, Stephanie finds out the true reason behind her classmate's reluctance to kiss her, and Jesse and Joey make an important decision about their working lives. By the episode's end, the entire family receives quite a few special surprises--particularly DJ, whose escort for the senior prom is the very last person she expected.",1186444800,61,11917,4.715521383950024

Be warned: If you're looking to buy them all, don't do what I did. I purchased each season individually. Many were very cheap. But towards the end, they got very expensive.",1458604800,3,346,4.672131147540983
2916343,5,B000U1ZV4E,Love it,1458345600,,7,3.0
2916344,5,B000U1ZV4E,"From a favorite growing up when the show first came out, to my 11-year-old middle daughter's favorite now.  The 8th and Final Season.  I've been buying her a season a year for the last several Christmas's, and she's been enjoying them immensely ever since.  She was a bit sad that it was the last season this Christmas. So imagine how stoked she was when Fuller house came out on Netflix this spring.  She counted down the days.  It worked out rather well that we finished the last season at the same time Fuller House came out.

Anyway, Full House is a classic.  They simply don't make TV like they did in the 80's and 90's.  I'm so glad to have all the Seasons now on DVD to share with my kids.

If you grew up on Full House with the Full House cast like I did,you'll love it now.  If you have tweens, pre-teens or teens, they'll enjoy it as well.  Even my 4-year-old enjoys sitting down with my 11-year-old and watching it.  And my 19-year-old has been watching it with me for years.  Full House is just solid family programming at it's finest.  You simply can't go wrong.

If you haven't watched it, and want a good, wholesome family show to watch with your kids, you can't get any better than Full House.",1458086400,,1209,4.334821428571429

2916352,3,B000U1ZV4E,"This 1994-95 Season of this sitcom that ran on ABC for 8 years was the season that abruptly became FULL HOUSE's final season, due to the premiere of much newer and sexier shows like SEINFELD, MELROSE PLACE, BEVERLY HILLS 90210, which all came out in the 90's, which stole a lot FULL HOUSE fans away, due to the fact that the 1990's was the decade when sex started selling and became allowed to show on regular primetime TV.

Therefore, FULL HOUSE wasn't even in the Top 10 or Top 30 in the Nielsen ratings anymore, especially since FULL HOUSE's good clean family time fun couldn't compete with the raunchyness of those much newer shows that K.O.'d FULL HOUSE in the ratings by the mid 90's.

Overall, I used to sometimes watch FULL HOUSE every Friday night as part of ABC's TGIF line-up before it was moved to Tuesday nights, and then FH was eventually cancelled on short notice in the Spring of 1995, since the show was running out of steam and going stale.",1440201600,,958,4.5

It's time for Jessie to move out of the house so they can raise their family in peace.  Maybe then Danny and Joey can find women of their own.

But the once cute kids were growing up, and the show really lost it in the later seasons. I thought the final episodes had some nice call-backs to the old days - including bringing back DJ's boyfriend Steve, but overall nothing about season 8 was great.

That said I'm still glad that it's avaliable on dvd, and that I bought it. If you loved the series, then the final season is a necessity.",1300492800,5,478,4.252747252747253

The characters you like, the characters you hate.
I like Donna Jo (D.J.), Stephanie, Jesse, Rebecca & Danny.
I hate Michelle & Joey.

The Olson twins could  NOT act.  And, if I heard ""Cut It Out"" out of Joey 1 more time.

The show was still a hit when ABC removed it.  Was it the story lines for this last season.

The ending of the D. J. & Steve relationship.  Then, her brief dating of other guys, the rich guy then Viper.  Remember, we NEVER learned his real name.

Repeating story lines again.  Just in season 7 Episode 8 ""Another Opening, Another No Show"".  Jesse & Kimmy getting locked in a storage room during the Smash Club opening.  Here we go again.  Episode 11 ""Arrest Ye Merry Gentlemen""  The Mickey Rooney episode, Jesse & Michelle locked in his store.  How many times did Jesse get locked in someplace in the entire 8 seasons?

Another episode with an animal.  How many episodes did they use this bit?

Normally the show was good family entertainment, same with this season BUT with these flaws.",1298592000,,1105,4.402985074626866

Now that there on dvd, i just bought this 8th season to complete my collection. It is really fun watching it for the first time now (Even thoguh im 29). my 3 year old loves watching it with me. There are lots of great scenes with the twins (becky and uncle jesse's) and also with Michelle. So glad we have something fun to watch together. The only thing I didn't like is how Stephanie is hanging out with that bad girl Gia. I remember teh earlier seasons when DJ was a teen, she was a pretty good kid. Stephanie is good, but the stories with her aren't as wholesome as the DJ ones were (example, riding in that car with those boys). In the end stephanie always does the right thing though, so I guess that is good.",1269388800,,875,4.183431952662722

I highly recommend this series for wholsome family entertainment.",1197072000,,329,5.0
2916452,5,B000U1ZV4E,"It's time to get ready to say goodbye to the Tanner family.  But before we do, we still get one last season of fun and laughs.  And everyone faces challenges as well.

This season, Danny (Bob Saget) finds a new girlfriend in one of Stephanie's (Jodie Sweetin) friend's mother.  Joey (Dave Coulier) tries to substitute teach, but finds it hard when Michelle's (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) class expects him to be funny instead of serious.  Jesse (John Stamos) is kicked out of his own bands and forms a new one, Hot Daddy and the Monkey Puppets.  Meanwhile, his wife Becky (Lori Loughlin) becomes the producer of ""Wake Up, San Francisco,"" much to Danny's dismay.  And Jesse and Becky have to deal with their twins, Nicky and Alex (Blake & Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit) starting pre-school.

And the kids on the show face their own growing pains.  D.J. (Candace Cameron) tries to juggle two boyfriends after breaking up with long time boyfriend Steve.  (And as long as we're on the subject of Steve, what is he doing on the cover of the box since he isn't in this season?)  D.J.'s best friend Kimmy (Andrea Barber) decides to elope when faced with the possibility of D.J. moving away.  Stephanie forms a new rock band.  And Michelle uses her lemonade stand money to buy a donkey.  Even Comet gets into the act this year when he runs away for an afternoon.

This may be the last season, but the show isn't running out of laughs.  Long time fans will find just as many laughs as previous seasons.  The cast is still having fun together bringing their characters to life each week.  As is tradition, most episodes end with a heart to heart, and a hug or two.  And there are still special guest stars like Barry Williams and Mickey Rooney, too.

The one thing this four disc set doesn't have is special features.  But that's not really shocking considering that the last few sets haven't had any either.

It's hard to say goodbye.  But fans of the show will be pleased to have the final season in their collection.",1196899200,6,1999,4.584745762711864
2916453,5,B000U1ZV4E,"The eighth season of Full House is also the last one. A real shame, in my opinion, because Full House could have definitely gone on for a few more seasons! But unfortunately the eighth season is the last one and luckily a good last season. The two final episodes, Michelle rides again, show what Full House is all about: family and being there for each other. A great end!",1196553600,9,372,4.405797101449275
8211940,4,B000U1ZV4E,"The set is OK, but I was kind of expecting the discs to be different like how they are in the picture on this site. Instead my discs turned out to be plain and not like the discs pictured. Maybe it's a newer version of the set? Can someone explain maybe? Thanks. Also, there's a scene missing in Michelle Rides Again Part 2 where they're at the hospital waiting for Michelle that was apparently cut in syndication. It's not really ""complete"" if all the scenes aren't intact. Also, why is a scene from season 6 on the back of the DVD set cover when this is season 8? Other than those things, it's not a bad set.",1525651200,,610,4.222222222222222
8211941,1,B000U1ZV4E,"Had to buy a new DVD set because this disk refuses to play. Also I just realized that apparently there is nothing on it (do you see a DVD menu?) physically, including the episodes All Stood Up (which is what I wanted to watch, for Jesse and Kimmys battle of noise lol), and the finale Michelle Rides Again 1&2. Makes no sense because Ive had these DVDs for years (not the complete series (I bought the entire series back in 14 I believe) but each season as a single DVD set).

UPDATE:
I bought a second copy and the same thing. But when I pressed PLAY it proceeded to play the final two episodes but Michelle Rides Again skips over the scene when Danny is arguing with Elizabeths mother Morgan and proceeds to go directly to the next scene. Shame, I love season 8.",1523145600,,765,4.2827586206896555
