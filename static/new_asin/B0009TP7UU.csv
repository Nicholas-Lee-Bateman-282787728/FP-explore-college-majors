I had to turn it up quite a bit in order hear. At times it was hard to hear what they were saying but that is why you should see it with complete concentration. Maria is a bedette which is a dancer and singer in a nice club  and the role fits her very well.",1388707200,,431,3.842696629213483

The distributors, Tekila Films, did nothing to find a good master for the transfer and nothing to restore the lousy copy they used on this product. Unfortunately this is common fare in Mexican films from the so called ""golden era of Mexican cinema."" In Mexico they blame lack of funds for this situation. I believe is mostly neglect and lack of respect for the consumers since the original producers and their descendants are filthy rich.  However they will not spend one peso in cleaning and restoring the product but keep exploiting it on home video and television.  Screw the consumer, take the money and run! This state of affairs is both tragic and disgusting since they are depriving new generations and film enthusiasts from watching these films as they were originally conceived. ""Caf Coln"" is an extraordinary film, lavishly produced and directed by Benito Alazraki. Beautiful Mara Flix plays Monica, a temperamental music hall singer during the Mexican revolution, who goes after a rebel leader (Pedro Armendariz)in order to take possesion of a fortune in jewels confiscated from the rich by the rebels. Maria's ""belle epoque"" wardrobe is breathtaking but her singing is not that impressive. They should have dubbed her in the songs as they did in other films in which her character was required to sing. But at the end it doesn't really matters since it is a pleasure to watch her perform. In my opinion Flix is a good film actress and with adequate direction she always comes through.  Pedro Armendariz will not surprise anybody with his performance since he has played the same rough, macho type in countless films but it is exciting to watch him.  The rest of the cast contribute a lot to the film and the Gabriel Figueroa cinematography is flawless. I imagine the film looked great in its original Eastmancolor but shows dull and faded on this DVD.  We must be grateful that at least ""Caf Coln"" has retained some color  because there are other Eastmancolor Mexican films which have been released on DVD in black and white!  In short, I recommend this DVD only to those who heve some money to throw away, understand Spanish and are extremely interested on the topic and the stars.",1345766400,,2341,4.791563275434243
8066482,3,B0009TP7UU,"It's really a shame that so little of Maria Felix's work is available in English-language versions.  There's some dispute on the net as to how good of an actress, in technical terms, she actually was, but what there's no argument about is that she oozed superstar power just standing still and could have drawn all eyes to her just by reading from the telephone book.  It's no wonder she's considered one of the iconic figures of Spanish-language film in general and Mexican cinema in particular.

""Cafe Colon"" is set during the Mexican Revolution.  While I don't understand Spanish, I get the basic plot easily enough; it's the story of a romance between a cabaret singer (imaginatively named Maria Felix) and a revolutionary general (the great Pedro Armendariz).  Felix looks particularly lovely in Edwardian-era costumes (which she also wore to great effect in Jean Renoir's ""French Can-Can"").  The picture quality is not all that great; it looks to be a direct transfer from the original film, complete with all the flaws that appeared on the original negative.  Maybe someday another company will be able to do a proper digital transfer and restoration, with English subtitles.  In the meantime, this film is well worth a look if you want to see ""La Dona"" in action.",1186876800,2,1271,4.934272300469484
