6878576,1,B00QSMFRXO,"The only thing culled here is an interesting story. This is frankly, just another boring, low budget b-horror movie.

The odd thing about this film is it has the foundation of some good elements (it's a lot like the DVD artwork, actually - it kinda looks interesting, but it's really as if the artist never finished the project - just kinda left it a quarter of the way through the job), but it never moves beyond introducing those elements, which just leaves the film flat. Creepy dolls, a maybe creepy kid, a potentially creepy house, kinda mysterious voices... I can't say it was atrocious. It was just... meh. No thrills, no scares, not even a cool scene I can point to as being horror-like. It's just a bland trip through a low budget b-movie, that's it.

Save your money - I'd wager this one will come out on Netflix or Amazon Prime soon. Long story short, if you pay for this, you'll be disappointed. If you can catch it for free, and you're bored, then maybe it's worth your time. Funny thing was, the acting wasn't half bad. It was really down to the writing and the directing that let this one crash and... fizzle.",1426118400,20,1124,4.478048780487805
6878577,1,B00QSMFRXO,"What a total waste of money and time. I watched the first 30 min and deleted it. Amazon really needs to improve the movies in the horror section especially.

I'm not sorry I rented it. But maybe it helped that I went in with no spoilers or expectations, which let me get excited by the movie's quality until it got stupid. (I don't use the word 'stupid' lightly here.) If watched with friends to share the cost, or as some kind of film class assignment, I still think it's worth it--it's definitely discussion worthy, if only to analyze what went wrong.",1426032000,10,653,4.581196581196581

6878584,1,B00QSMFRXO,"Shaking my head over this one. I'm confused from start to finish. To begin with, how can 18% of reviewers think this movie was worth 5 stars? Tell the truth: you're related to the director or actors. Amiright?

This begins with a plot that makes no sense to anyone who saw it - 5 stars be damned! It continues with a horrible script and some of the most awkward dialogue ever written. Then, to seal the deal, a director who obviously never took a step back far enough to look at the big picture and ask, ""Should I be doing this?"" I'm not even going to blame the actors because they were working with nothing and maybe a brilliant actor could have done Something with the Nothing, but that would be an Academy Award-worthy performance.

Finally, I blame myself for paying two bucks for this movie even though my gut told me I was going to regret it.

6878596,1,B00QSMFRXO,"The sub-title for ""The Culling"" is ""When the Devil Breeds"". There's no devil and no breeding in this stupid mess of a film. It doesn't know whether it wants to be supernatural or about demons. Take for instance ""Amanda"" (Linsey Godfrey). She hears a noise in a cupboard, opens it and a black figure appears like a mist that then pours into her mouth. You'd expect she'd become possessed. No. She's mildly ill and this leads nowhere. Later she runs and falls into a pit of dead bodies (who are there for no known reason). As she is helped out by a friend a flying hatchet hits her in the head killing her and the two baddies say ""We were going to use her"". For what? If they wanted to use her then they should have killed the guy helping her out of the pit so she couldn't get out.

There's a barnfull of locked up kids, that may be demonic, but if they're being bred, then just locking them up serves no purpose. This film is completely garbage.",1439251200,6,945,4.279329608938547
6878597,5,B00QSMFRXO,"The Culling really isn't as bad as the reviewers below are saying.  No disrespect to anyone's opinion intended of course!  I was going to give this 4 stars but I'm raising it to a 5 based on the negativity overall.  It's about a group of teenagers that just want to go out for some fun and vacationing.  When they stop at a diner late at night to grab a quick bite, they're disappointed that the waitress closed it down and won't let them inside.  Suddenly an adorable little girl appears behind a car.  She's upset and wants these teens to take her home.  They're reluctant to not so much because you shouldn't place a child in your car, but because they're in a hurry and don't want to deal with this stuff.  Of course you should never place a child in your vehicle unless it's an emergency, otherwise you'd get accused of kidnapping.  I'd like to think exceptions would have to be made if it was an emergency.

Anyway the teens end up giving in and driving the little girl home, but instead of dropping her off and leaving they open the front door and walk inside.  Uh oh!  That's a bad idea for many reasons.  One they're now trespassing/breaking and entering, but for the sake of a movie, well it's a bad idea because it turns out the parents are cultists and they've not only gathered several children in the woods as a means to conjure up more evil entities, they've created a really nasty shadow figure that likes to roam the house and nearby woods making all kinds of eerie sounds.  I really like the emphasis on scary sounds.  Not enough horror films go that route anymore and settle for silence instead, which is boring and leans towards jump scares which admittedly make me jump sometimes, but true horror is more than just jump scares.  You know what I mean?  So the Culling works wonderfully there.

Anyway as you can expect, the teens don't suspect there's anything odd going on until they hear weird sounds coming from the nearby barn.  After the mother chops some wood and cuts her leg, she has to be rushed to the hospital... and the mother and father leave their little girl with the teens again.  WHAT the?  So the movie goes from logical to illogical!  It's logical when the parents question why these teens are at their home with their daughter when they pull into their driveway after searching for their daughter, but now it's illogical that they'd leave their daughter with them.  Lapse of judgment in the writing there, haha.  It's not like the 10 minutes these parents got to know the teens while they shared their feelings and stories out back around a campfire was enough to convince the parents their daughter would be safe with these teens.  The teens are all decent (except for maybe the obnoxious and spoiled Brett Davern's character).  Funny these teens bring up how they don't like cult stuff to the family.  I mean that's like walking into a bar and saying you don't like people who drink, lol.

All the teens are fantastic actors and actresses too.  This means they show believable concern whenever they witness unexplainable dark shadows roaming the hallways and walls or hear creepy sounds without being able to find the source.  I think Linsey Godfrey might be the best actress.  She totally flips out and shows what looks to me like genuine worriedness whenever she'd witness something evil take place.  Given her history of being mentally ill, her friends just accuse her of being whacky in the head.  Nope!  She gets downright breathless due to such a severe panic attack!  I feel that Chris Coy is another fantastic actor- his emotions were believable when the situation got intense later on, and Elizabeth di Prinzio is perhaps the main actress since... well, nevermind!  I don't want to spoil to much more.  Just know that the dark entity that roams the house and woods is more persistent and angrier than any of the teens could have anticipated.  Jeremy Sumpter plays the logical one who controls the gun since Chris is just too nerve wracked to think.

I never quite understood what the deal was with all those kids locked in a jail or barn.  Were they kidnapped kids that the parents snagged, or were they actually demonic presences from another dimension that the family brought into this world?  Either way I really liked the special effects.  The movie would never reveal too much and spoil the mysteriousness of the dark figure, but it never dragged along boringly either. A perfect balance.  Great acting, terrific storyline and atmosphere, top-notch character acting, and highly recommended for horror lovers.",1439164800,2,4564,4.69521410579345

6878615,1,B00QSMFRXO,"This barely feels like a movie. It's almost like a film someone would make as part of a forty-eight hour dare or something. Five stock 20-something characters trade cliched banter on a road trip to SXSW when they encounter a lost little girl clutching a doll in the middle of the night at a closed roadside diner. They kindly drive her to her home, where they encounter her parents. Even though the parents have been frantically searching for their daughter, they immediately yell at the travelers. ""You're at my house with my daughter and I don't know who you are!"" I'm the person who found your lost child, you idiot, is what I would've said.

Then, the mother accidentally hacks her leg with an axe while cutting firewood. The solution? The mother and father drive to the hospital 90 minutes away, opting to leave their daughter with the strangers they were yelling at earlier. Granted, given how the ""story"" turns out, this makes sense, but in the context of any right-thinking character, eyebrows would've been raised. How about you take your daughter with you to the hospital so my friends and I can get out of here, you idiot? is what I would've said.

Maybe you noticed I put the word ""story"" in quotation marks up there. That's because this really isn't a story. The hospital trip is a painfully obvious ruse to get our five annoying characters alone in a house that may or may not be home to a malevolent presence, which manifests itself in spooky ways, like turning off the lights a little. Then one character runs and screams. A lot. Boy does she scream. I bet she destroyed her throat, she screamed so much. Like a strangled goat, she screamed. Then some of them die, all of them in deeply ridiculous ways. Then nothing is explained. The end.

I don't mind a movie that leaves questions unanswered, but there's gotta be some kind of basic foundation to your tale or it turns into nothing but a gumbo of unconnected events and images. ""Most people never figure out what's going on,"" says a bad guy when confronting a non-bad guy. No kidding, bad guy. There's a sloppy, halfhearted bit of exposition when the bad guy kinda-sorta reveals the big master plan (arbitrarily using the word ""culling"" to justify our movie title), but it makes virtually no sense and is relayed in such a dumb scene with such a dumb speech delivered in such a dumb whispery tone (whispers are creepy!) that it would've been better if nothing had been said at all.

At barely over 80 minutes long, the movie hardly registers as anything other than a waste of an hour or so of time. Without any kind of interesting characters, forward movement, or even a basic storyline, all you have are a few cliched scares (broken dolls and kids in the forest are spooky!) without any emotional or intellectual hooks to hang them on, leaving you with a limp, unorganized pile of crap.",1429747200,8,2856,4.627218934911243

I just watched this movie and this person was right.  Both the movie's description on this site and the DVD cover are extremely misleading.  I expected a storyline similar to the motif of Village of the Damned from twenty years ago starring Christopher Reeve and Lindsey Haun and thought (after reading the description) that The Culling would feature a main child character with supernatural attributes who lures those five twentysomethings from that parking lot to her lair then teams up with her friends who share her powers (in a setting with no adults other than those five victims she brought) to compel them into doing all of their bidding!  Wouldn't you have gotten the same idea?  I mean look at the girl's eyes on the cover!  As it turned out there is nothing of that sort within this movie.  This was such a disappointment.  At the child's request the five people come to agree to drive her back to her house (although one of them is more reluctant to do this).  Not long after these young adults arrive with the girl back at her house one of the young women seems to urge them all to remain on the premises until the child's parents return.  I find it absurd that they even allowed the girl to get into their car in the first place!  Did they want to be accused of child abduction or molestation?  They had cell phones with them.  Why didn't they just call 911 from the parking lot, report the situation and get the police to come and bring the child to safety?  The parents arrive soon after and although seem concerned at first their tensions ease within minutes and then they seem like they're trying to make best friends with these five strangers!  Who would have thought there would be any parents in this movie?  Recalling what I said earlier I didn't think this child or her accomplices were the type who needed supervision from adults given the otherworldly intelligence and powers from other realities I believed they possessed!  I know that all the customer reviews on amazon.com are just based on one's personal perspectives but in this case I sure wish I had taken all the negative reviews of this movie posted on this site seriously and I encourage you to do that before deciding whether you'll buy it!",1427846400,5,2433,4.592592592592593

Three guys and two girls head out to listen to a band, drink alcohol and do drugs. They end up helping Lucy (Harley Graham- see DVD cover) find her way home. They end up staying there, a house with strange noises and broken doll parts....oooh creepy. There is some black smoke and we do get to see something once, but that was the limits of the special effects. Scary scenes included pictures drawn by a child.

One by one....I think you got the picture.

I think I would have enjoyed the film more if I knew what ""culling"" meant before I watched it. This is a run of the mill horror film and might work as a Wednesday night Redbox rental.

6878638,3,B00QSMFRXO,"I'm still not quite sure what to make of this movie?!  To start, I did enjoy it.  I found it entertaining enough to keep my constant attention and never felt that it was boring.  That being said, it was severely lacking in actually explaining the events.  The movie follows 5 friends on their journey to Austin, TX and the annual SXSW (south by southwest) music festival.  Along the way, they happen to meet a little girl who has been separated from her grandpa and needs a ride home.  Instead of just calling 911/the Police (as any normal person would) the crew decides to drive her home and await the return of her parents.  Once the parents are back, things seem to return to normal, with the exception of hearing some INSANE noises coming from the barn.  When her parents leave again (to attend to a wound suffered from mom) they decide to leave their daughter in the care of the (by then) drugged up/drunk college students they just met hours before.  That really should have been a clue?!

Like I said, the movie itself is pretty entertaining and is never really lacking for interesting action, but the story and explanation is really never there.  They just go through either thinking you, as the viewer, will fill in the gaps yourself, or simply not care enough to worry about it.  Either way, the acting and overall film quality is great!  I enjoyed it.

6878639,1,B00QSMFRXO,"Polished production values and professional actors aren't nearly enough to save this surprisingly uneventful horror film.  The Culling opens with a bunch of friends taking a road trip to South By Southwest.  After five minutes of their playful banter I was already rooting for painful deaths for all of them--but The Culling doesn't even manage to fulfill that very modest wish.

The annoying friends stop at a diner for food but it just closed.  When they are about to leave a crying little girl appears asking them to take her home.  So as a horror fan you probably figure the girl is bait leading them directly into some sort of horrible trap.  Unfortunately you can scratch off the directly part.  The girl's parents turn up and seem pretty normal.  They invite the the folks who brought their little girl home to stay for steaks and beer.  Then they talk about how the couple and their child ended up in the country.  Then the woman cuts her leg chopping wood so the husband drives his wife to this hospital which is an hour and a half away while they leave the almost total strangers at home with their daughter.  Then the friends watch football and the young woman who really likes kids reads the little girl a bedtime story--twice.

It's more than 45 minutes into this 81 minute film (the Amazon listed running time of 118 minutes for the DVD might include extras) before anything that could charitably described as an actual horror scene actually happens--unfortunately that involves a really lame looking special effect that portends the awfulness to come.

The friends bicker obnoxiously and do dumb things--they become possessed by a silly looking black smoke spirit or die in extremely uninteresting ways.  Meanwhile the promise of the creepy little girl on the cover never happens because she isn't given much of anything to do and it takes until nearly the end of the movie for her parents to finally tip their hands and reveal their sinister intentions--sort of--but by that time it's extremely clear that writer/director Rustam Branaman made this thing despite having no good ideas for his film--heck, there are hardly any bad ideas--The Culling is pretty much all filler with some awkward expositionary dialogue near the very end so we understand what was supposed to have been going on earlier.

The Culling is a seriously dull horror movie that feels much longer than its 81 minutes and delivers absolutely no thrills to go with virtually no plot, no interesting characters, no creepy imagery and ultimately no reason for anyone who isn't friend or family of the cast and crew to actually sit through this complete crap excuse for a horror film.",1426118400,18,2665,4.852097130242826

8692670,5,B00QSMFRXO,"The Culling, with its excellent cast, mounting intensity, and ingeniously constructed surprises, is  a commanding achievement. Apart from its confronting and shocking nature, The Culling is also a film which asks many theological questions in regards to faith and the roles of good and evil in the world. Its deep philosophical slant drives a deep wedge between it and other films of its ilk, which do not have the intelligence or substance to tackle such themes, as this movie so cleverly does. For this reason The Culling not only tops the horror genre but transcends it, resulting in a profound experience where movie making horror, thrillingly dramatic storytelling and deeply felt spirituality of the Catholic kind make for pivotal viewing.",1474934400,,745,5.208333333333333
