8056743,4,B00092A1JE,"The story of an American Prince. JFK Jr. A tragic story I suppose retold very well. I have long since had a fascination with the late President. I was born 4 months to the day before he died in Dallas. I was first turned on to his story when the mini series the Kennedy's came out where Martin Sheen played JFK, a great series, then the movie by Oliver Stone. This tele movie was perfect. I would have chosen another actor to play John Jr as the look, build and hairy chest were missing. John Jr had that wonderful trademark hairy chest that was pure magic. The story was well told. I found myself once or twice saying, don't go John. It's funny when you watch a movie like this and you know how it will turn out and you get sad knowing what's going to happen, but I suppose it's how you get there. The interwoven real news footage of the aftermath of the disaster and what followed. The Kennedy's were not so much cursed as unfortunate. They continue to move forward His legacy will live on in his name and the people who remember him. R.I.P John Jr",1345507200,,1050,4.255
8056744,5,B00092A1JE,"Although it has been at least ten years since the death of John F. Kennedy Jr.; this film has been made with the upmost bravado depicting his life and times, and especially his marriage to the woman of his dreams. May John and his lovely wife Caroline, along with her sister rest in peace; moreover all three are gone yet they will never be forgotten.",1258243200,4,351,4.415384615384616
8056745,3,B00092A1JE,"This movie was well acted by Portia De Rossi, Kristoffer Polaha and Jacqueline Bisset but it was not in-depth enough. If you like exceptional acting and want to know about the basics of J.F.K Jr.'s life: then this movie is for you! My biggest gripe about this movie is that the perspective commentary of the two women at the makeshift memorial was just useless and irritating dialogue; that seemed to only be in the movie to bash the women that were in J.F.K Jr.'s life.  At times it was slow with the storyline; which in turn made it boring.",1220659200,9,542,4.474747474747475
8056746,4,B00092A1JE,"I recorded it when it came on television.  Well I like the insight into JFK Jr.'s personality or their version of it. However, their were scenes where they had these to bimbos and other jerks on the street commenting on his and his wife's life as if they knew him they could have kept that part out.",1157932800,9,299,4.245614035087719
