8741806,4,B0189RYJ6Q,"""Theeb"" (2014 release from Jordan; 100 min.) brings the story of a young boy named Theeb. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is ""Arabia, 2016"". We get to know Theeb and his older brother Hussein, both part of a nomadic tribe of pilgrim guides. One evening the tribe is visited by an Arab and an Englishman who need a guide to a remote well near the train line. Hussein takes the men, and Theeb secretly follow them. Once found out, they are too far out for Theeb to be sent back. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this release comes to us from Jordan, where the entire production took place. I am fairly confident that this is my first exposure to Jordanian cinema, and what a beauty this is. Jordanian director Naji Abu Nowar worked mostly with non-professional actors from the Bedouin tribe, but this does not in the least affect the quality of the acting performances. If anything, the actors seem to feel perfectly at home in that rugged desert environment because, guess what, that is where they actually live! Speaking of the actors, the young boy in the title role is absolutely amazing. Without giving plot points away, a good chunk of the movie is just Theeb by himself or with one other person. Yet the boy easily carries the movie on his shoulder. The movie is shot beautifully, with tons of epic shots of the desert and nearby mountain range. I'd love to see that area for myself at some point (I read that past of ""The Martian"" starring Matt Damon, was also filmed in that desert). Last but not least, there is a beautiful score for this movie, from composer Jerry Lane, and played by the London Contemporary Orchestra. In case you are not aware: ""Theeb"" has gotten an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign language Movie. (Not sure how the Oscars work, since ""Theeb"" was actually released in 2014, yet somehow just now got nominated, not that it matters one way or another)

""Theeb"" recently opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The evening screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely, somewhat to my surprise. With ""Theeb"", I've now seen 3 of the 5 Oscar nominations for Best Foreign movie, and I hope to see the remaining two still. At one level or another they are all winners, but I'm quite certain that the Oscar will go to ""Son of Saul"" when all is said and done. Regardless, if you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign film, you cannot go wrong with ""Theeb"", so if you get a chance to check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. do not miss it! ""Theeb"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1454025600,3,2691,4.523613963039014
8741807,5,B0189RYJ6Q,"I purchased this from Amazon U.K. a few weeks ago and only just got round to seeing it. Why did I wait?
One of the most engrossing films that I have seen in years. I always enjoy films that take you to another world (on Earth) and this succeeds in doing that in spades. Incredible performances from an amateur cast and equally incredible photography.

The Academy got this one right in nominating it for Best Foreign Film this year. I hope it wins",1452816000,2,447,4.385542168674699
8741808,5,B0189RYJ6Q,"Why doesn't Hollywood make any Westerns like this anymore?  Every shot is like a postcard and the story is totally originally.  I'm not one for movies with subtitles, but I barely noticed.  The acting is solid and the writer and director tell the story confidently.  I only found out after it's their first movie.  I'm still not sure that's true.  Doesn't matter though - if you like a Western with a real soul then check it out.",1450569600,2,429,4.5064935064935066
