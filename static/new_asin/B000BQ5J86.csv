8090854,1,B000BQ5J86,"I saw this movie last night; please.. is this a horror movie? I never understood the idea; as a horror movie fan, I think movies like this one must be destroyed!!!!! I am sorry to say that... but is the truth.",1195948800,,209,4.121951219512195
8090855,2,B000BQ5J86,"This movie had been recommended to me for its interesting twist ending. Well, if it's there, I don't get it.

I have an inkling about what the branching off of plot line may stem from. But if it's what I think it is, there are a lot of lapses in logic that would make the new path unlikely, or actually impossible.

Furthermore, the production values for this film are rather cheesy. So unless you want to puzzle out the implications of this particular hatchet-man pursuing yet another set of teens in the woods - you might find a better way to spend your time.",1161216000,2,561,4.384615384615385
8090856,3,B000BQ5J86,"An indie film obviously with a low budget, BLOODLINE isn't all that bad.  While it's not a classic by any means, the movie does throw in some unusual plot twists that will keep the viewer puzzled.

A somewhat retarded young man goes on a killing spree and murders a bunch of his brother's friends on a camping trip, and then disappears, only to be taken in by some reclusive stranger.  Years later, the brother is having his own nightmarish memories and it's not clear just who is responsible for the deaths.

The movie's climactic scenes seem a little contrived, but the psychological implications are chilling even if a little confusing.  All in all, not a bad indie horror film.",1159142400,3,681,4.689075630252101
8090857,3,B000BQ5J86,"If horror isn't your thing forget this movie; if it is, buy it.  Some very good acting is done by CLAY ADAMS, whom you may recognize from the T.V. soaps ""As the World Turns"" and ""All my Children"".  BRYAN SMITHSON and the supporting cast use their talent to move the plot forward very effectively. The ending, although simple, caught me by suprise.  Low budget movies require a greater than average suspension of disbelief, especially since the advent of computer graphics and super special effects.  If you haven't got the brain power to sit through a play, then stick to mega movies like Star Wars....they've thought of everything for you, but if you can enjoy a film at face value give this one a shot......I think you'll enjoy it!",1137283200,7,733,4.703125
8090858,1,B000BQ5J86,"The cover art made this movie look like it was going to be along the lines of SAW, the description made the move sound good too.  Boy how pictures do decieve, this was the most stupid movie I have seen in awhile.  I would watch this again if it was the last movie on Earth..Don't waste your money or time on this one.",1134950400,2,317,4.015873015873016
8090859,1,B000BQ5J86,"All i can say is wasting my time. i just rent the movies today. at first i thought it will be horror and murder movies, but all i can see is crap. the production is very poor and all the character.",1134518400,3,197,3.8292682926829267
