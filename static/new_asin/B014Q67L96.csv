7420309,5,B014Q67L96,"This DVD features three Monogram B-Westerns, Yukon Manhunt, Northwest Territory, and Yukon Gold.  Each movie is about an hour long.  I played it in my DVD player and the picture quality is outstanding, although I did have to turn the sound way up to be able to hear the dialogue.

These are typical Kirby Grant/Chinook B-westerns, and the movies are all quite good. My favorite is Yukon Gold, because it features a young, short-haired brunette Martha Hyer as the leading lady.

Chinook is real star of these movies.  This magnificent, white German Shephard, really stands out as he repeatedly rescues Kirby Grant from the bad guys.  Chinook could out-think and out-fight any baddie ever to appear in a B-Western. What really impresses me about Chinook is that he appears to be interacting with the humans in all his scenes.  I could not find a single instance where he appeared to look to an off-camera trainer for a signal as to what to do. Chinook is the most natural animal actor that I have ever seen.  This DVD is worth the price just to watch Chinook in action.",1346976000,7,1067,4.668449197860962

8731524,4,B014Q67L96,James Oliver Curwood wrote a whole series of novels about the North West.  This series features the Royal Canadian Mounted Police force as produced by Monogram Pictures.  In all Monogram made ten films featuring Chinook an Cpl Rod Webb.  Kirby Grant was an excellent choice for the lead character.  I would recommend this collection for your DVD collection.,1394755200,2,357,5.103448275862069
8731525,4,B014Q67L96,"Saw these as a kid and never found them on TV until this set at least made three of the nine films available. Thank you Warner Bros!
They're simple, straightforward cowboy-in=-the-Yukon stuff, but quite enjoyable regardless. I think even kids today would like them, even without a lot of pyrotechnics...

I vaguely remember some of them being in color. Hope Warners releases more!",1377302400,,380,5.031746031746032
8731526,4,B014Q67L96,"This three feature DVD is family oriented and each film runs a little over an hour! Monogram Pictures created this series of Kirby Grant and his faithful dog Chinook in the early 1950s. This heroic twosome battle bad guys and always win by the final reel of each film! Nothing earth shaking, just good entertainment by the Monogram Studio!",1359158400,4,339,4.762711864406779
8731527,5,B014Q67L96,"Sometimes it's harder to write down your thoughts than usual. I am an unapologetic fan of Monogram/Republic/PRC/etc., and own a lot, but I have never seen any of the Kirby Grant ""Mountie"" films. I know they were occasionally shown here in the U/K in the 50's but nowhere near me, and I don't think TV has ever shown them. So....when I saw Warner had these 3 eps from their ""Made to Order Archive Collection"" at a reasonable price...I leapt in. The 5 stars? That's for Wrner for releasing these so hard to find films and in such fine condition. The prints are really very good, probably better than when shown in 16mm in the cinema!! No, I know, 35mm, but you get what I am saying - I hope. So that is good and worth the stars. Sadly, and of course this is subjective, and other reviewers disagree, I found the films just a little dull, and can't help but think maybe Warner just picked any 3 and didn't ""select"". I know this applies to all the ""B"" pictures, but the locations used are virtually the same for all 3 films. The stages are cheap. The fights are very poor, and I found Grant hard to take to. YUKON GOLD is my favourite, and it has Martha Hyer showing real promise. YUKON MANHUNT has a fair plot and Gail Davis in an unusual role, and certainly has it's moments. NORTHWEST TERRITORY I wasn't too keen on. All the chases in all 3 films are either by canoe! or on foot, and I miss the galloping horses. YES this is worth getting, and I am sure other viewers will probably get real pleasure and if I am truly honest - If Warner do release 3 more I will probably buy them. They can only be the same or better. Hope this helps anyone in any doubt about purchase!! (Oh! Chinook MUST be the fiercest film dog...ever)",1358812800,2,1720,4.295384615384616
8731528,4,B014Q67L96,"I like Kirby Grant, first saw him in Sky King as a kid. He did well in the triple adventure on this disc. The picture is quite good.",1353024000,,132,3.75
8731529,5,B014Q67L96,"I add my complete agreement to Mr. Williams' September 7, 2012, review of these Monogram ""Kirby Grant and Chinook"" Westerns from 1951 and 1952. Kirby Grant is usually known today by his starring role in the TV series, ""Sky King,"" yet before that popular television series, Grant made a number of first class B Westerns, including several during the mid-1940s for Universal. He went to work for Monogram Studios in 1948/1949, and between 1949 and 1954, starred in a series of well-made oaters set in the Canadian northwest, in the Yukon. As Mountie Rod Webb, with his faithful and very talented white German Shepherd, Chinook, Grant's film outings are always entertaining and superior in the genre. Production values for this series are consistently high; plots are well-handled--indeed, it is usually only at the last moment that one discovers the real villain or mastermind behind the crime being investigated. Visually, the camera work is striking. Although these films were most likely filmed at Monogran's ""ranch,"" they have the feel of actually taking place in the Yukon. Director Frank McDonald knows how to create solid action. And the casts include such worthies as Gail Davis, Rand Brooks, Harry Lauter, and Martha Hyer.

As with its excellent earlier series of Monogram releases (in three volumes, featuring Johnny Mack Brown, Rod Cameron, and Whip Wilson),
Warner Archives does film buffs a real service by releasing these films (i.e., YUKON MANHUNT, NORTHWEST TERRITORY, and YUKON GOLD). Let's hope that there are more!",1349222400,7,1531,5.198380566801619
