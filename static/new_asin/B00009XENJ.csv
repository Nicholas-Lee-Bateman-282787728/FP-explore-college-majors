7993885,4,B00009XENJ,"I gave this video more stars than it actually deserves because of my bias toward Darin.  It is, after all, this superstars first US TV special - the youngest star at the time to have his own special - so it's noteworthy.  But it's not a great show and Darin's lack of experience is obvious 'cause he mugs horribly and lacks subtlety in sketches.

Maybe it's dated, or maybe I'd have disliked it in its day too 'cause I dislike the material and the performances.  It opens ok with I've got Rhythm/Plenty of Nothin' and a decent dance number and ok monologue.  But then it's all downhill with a song that strikes me as snooty (Some People) and an annoying French routine that just seems like an inside joke that excludes the audience.  Then there's an equally annoying medley with Joannie Summers where Darin plays a high school student in an overly cute manner.  And finally, saving the worst for last, is an unfunny ""comedy"" routine with Darin and Bob Hope trying on hats, and Darin mugs terribly, followed by a stodgey vaudeville kinda conga line.  Ugh.

Only for Darin completists, but then I am one.",1136419200,4,1102,4.581632653061225
