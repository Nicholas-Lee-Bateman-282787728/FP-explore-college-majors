They are a bunch of no-talent morons who have absolutely NO creativity or any ability to do anything of interest to anyone beyond themselves.

3102918,1,B0013BLGYE,"I snatched this up as soon as I saw it on Amazon thinking it was the latest dvd by the MST3K spin-off group the film crew.

The actual dvd features a troupe of comedians that take the long way around getting to the plot concerning murders at a cineplex. After the first murder I'd had enough. I don't like to discourage young talent, but this project is thoroughly amateurish. The script is pretty much one tawdry sexual situation after another. The production desperately needed a make-up professional or at least somebody that could light the performers in a flattering manner. The acting is exaggerated mugging, almost like this had been a stage production and they're reenacting their broad 'to the back seats' performances. All in all, it seemed like a video made to impress their friends rather than something that should be in general release. I can't comment on the second feature since the first one was so unpleasant to sit through.",1211932800,10,942,4.814814814814815

8249776,2,B0013BLGYE,"Beware, fans of MST3K! This has nothing to do with our favorite riff masters!

Wet Heat is the redheaded stepchild nobody wanted in the first place. Filmed by Chris Seaver and company, Wet Heat is just one installment in a long list of low budget movies that Seaver wrote, directed and starred in (most of the time). While I haven't seen all of his movies, I can assure you they all follow a similar formula: a weak premise (usually based on some other popular franchise) followed by dialog that is comprised of one-liners first made famous/funny by the professionals we idolize today, all wrapped up with character names that either sound like a 10 year old created them or are straight rip offs of other popularized material (McLargehuge from Mulva: Zombie Ass Kicker! or even Mulva herself for example). Of all his characters, Mr. Bonejack is without a doubt the best.

Ultimately, what you get is a film lover living out his dreams, regardless of how they look, sound or come off to whoever is viewing them. I commend Seaver for putting it all out there but I refuse to watch any of his movies more than once. If anything, give Quest for Egg Salad a chance, definitely an easier sit-through than Wet Heat.

Now who wants to see how big mah dick is?!",1451952000,,1253,4.584821428571429
8249777,4,B0013BLGYE,"Apparently, this has nothing to do with Mike Nelson or Mystery Science Theater.  I know that because I read the description provided by Amazon.  Luckily, it has everything to do with Chris Seaver and his Low Budget Pictures gang.  If you are a Seaver fan, this is a great double feature.  If you are new to his ""realms"" it is actually not a bad place to start.  Again, no hilarious film riffing here, that would be The Film Crew, 4 dvds released by Shout Factory starring the RiffTrax guys.  Those are also very funny, and clearly identified by Amazon. This is a double dose of primo Seavage, butter squashed, powdered thoroughly and ladled with thick ape gravy. Enjoy?  Yeah...ENJOY!",1440892800,,684,4.697478991596639
8249778,4,B0013BLGYE,"Film Crew takes place in a movie theatre. We get introduced to the workers, who are an eclectic bunch. Turns into a slasher movie. Again, not Shakespeare, just something to be entertained by and have fun. Wet Heat again, has Teen Ape (he's in a lot of LBP movies) in a not to distant future, trying to find the president of Hollywood (ala Escape From New York). Billy Gabberina turns in a hilarious performance as a Frank N. Furter type character.",1365033600,,447,4.530864197530864
8249779,4,B0013BLGYE,"All....please don't take these movies seriously....they are what they are.  If you are comparing them to hollywood produced movies then of course they are 1 star.  But if you think of them as extended comedy  skits...say something you would see on Saturday Night Live, Mad T.V. or Cartoon Network then you will enjoy these a lot better. They are very funny if you appreciate its type of humor. The first time i saw a Chris Seaver Movie I was shocked on how ""Un-Hollywood"" it was.  I am now on my 5th or 6th one so I know what to expect...and that makes it easier to watch and more enjoyable.",1320192000,,591,4.394495412844036
8249780,1,B0013BLGYE,"i bought this dvd because it came up in a search for the film crew.........so so naturally i assumed it was the same guys that did mystery science theater/ the film crew.  was i ever mistaken........this is the worst piece of absloute trash ever , it was a total waste of money .........i took it out of the machine after the first insulting five minutes and threw it away...........BEWARE!!!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MINDLESS TALENTLESS JUVENILE GARBAGE!",1227398400,3,466,4.825
8249781,1,B0013BLGYE,"I was dupped.. I thought this was THE FILM CREW with Mike Nelson and MST3K Buddies.. NOT WORTH THE MONEY... I want to Burn it.

AMAZON you sent me this as a pre order suggestion and I am so pissed. Because this is not what I wanted to get! THANKS FOR NOTHING",1225497600,5,258,3.9615384615384617
8249782,1,B0013BLGYE,"When I saw this online, I thought it was 'the Film Crew' with the MST3K gang and opened it up before I realized my error. So I can't get a refund for this trash. I wish as hell I could give this one a ZERO rating. Since I can not, I'll do it here:

How do you rate this item? ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO

and finally... ZERO!!!",1218240000,9,349,3.767123287671233
8249783,1,B0013BLGYE,"Sorry Amazon.  I trusted your suggestion that Film Crew to accompany my order of MST3K The Movie thinking it was the new tv show, Film Crew, done by some of the same guys that brought you MST3K the TV show.  In the words of COSMO CRAMER, ""You were WAAAYYY off!""

This was literally made in someones basement with people that were barely in their twenties.  I couldn't make it through 5 min.  I wish I could get my money back.  My fault for not looking more closely.

Hopefully the creaters of this Film Crew movie use the money for film/acting lessons.

Amazon, be more careful next time.",1217376000,7,588,4.429906542056075
8249784,1,B0013BLGYE,"This was by far the biggest waste of money ever. This DVD was absolutely awful. The producers stole the name from The Film Crew and have mislead purchasers into thinking they are getting something from that group instead of this horrible, horrible waste of time. I strongly recommend that this item be pulled from inventory so that no one else will make the same mistake I did.",1213574400,7,377,4.641791044776119
8249785,1,B0013BLGYE,"I was mislead when I purchased this item. I thought this was the newest release by the ""Film Crew"". Instead it was a couple of no budget slasher flicks. The bright spot was that after I made the purchase, I received an extra couple of dollars off the price due to Amazon's low price policy, so I didn't throw as much money away as I could have. This DVD will sit unopened and will most likely be used as a gag gift. Remember to read descriptions closely and not to assume that because you bought something and the AI at Amazon thinks you'll like what it recommends, it's a sure thing. So, so disappointing. My own fault really. Who else is going to review this steaming pile of a DVD?",1213574400,7,684,4.269230769230769
