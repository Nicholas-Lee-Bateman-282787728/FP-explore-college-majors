6673069,4,B00NMVV3XW,"Dustin Mills is on top of his game.  He is probably the most creative and imaginative independent filmmaker out right now for many reasons but it's his style  of shooting and writing that grab me the most.  Yes he's a great innovative fx artist but the further he goes in this business the more and more I just love seeing his camera work and finding out what new story he has in store for his viewers.  Nothing Dustin does is ever boring or mundane or even repetitive.  From the titles of his films all the way through the dialogue his writing is just off the wall and never predictable.  Dustin takes ideas that have been done over and over and adds a twist of lime to make everything that much better.
  Here we have the ""A"" typical torture porn movie which is a term I hate to use but it paints the picture pretty well so there you go.  I myself have waded through the many indie films of this kind and grew tired and bored of it long ago.  For some putting naked women up on screen getting tortured becomes boner footage for most of their viewers no matter how those viewers try and rationalize it and it makes a quick buck. I may be in the minority but you need much, much more than that to impress me when it comes to making movies of any kind.  And well here comes Dustin Mills to do just that.  When I found out the small details I did of Hornet's Sting I was on the fence waiting.  I mean Her Name Was Torment was definitely similar but in my opinion it was far more of an art film and this is definitely a torture and humiliation film.  I'd use the words ""and nothing else"" after that last sentence but with Dustin there is never ""nothing else"".

Do not be derailed by reviews from people who have no experience or education on independent films.  This is not Hollywood and nor should it be.  These movies are created on micro-budgets of thousands sometimes hundreds of dollars.  No one in the business shoots like Dustin.  This pink nightmare is not for everyone but if you're smart enough to read up on the films you're watching then take a chance and go for it....if you like artistically shot films of this style.  There are lots of naked torture films out there with no validity and frankly are boner boy movies.  This is not.  This is true independent art.",1417478400,3,2330,4.32258064516129
6673070,5,B00NMVV3XW,"Dustin Mills does an outstanding job with visuals and lighting.  This might not be for everyone, but it is a very good film and all of the actors/actresses did an outstanding job.  Highly recommended, especially if you have seen any of Dustin's other films.",1417478400,2,257,4.818181818181818
6673071,2,B00NMVV3XW,"Stay away from this unless you have a strong stomach and weird tastes. One of the actresses is nice looking if you like full-figured girls, but unless you also like them tied up and covered in fake blood this isn't for you.",1417305600,2,223,4.333333333333333

8679247,1,B00NMVV3XW,"I found lots of ways to waste money in my life, but buying this dvd has to be the worst way. First 15 minutes of movie your watching the movie through a camera that is taking pictures. Last 45 minutes the women is naked, but that is about it.",1431734400,5,242,3.9591836734693877
8679248,1,B00NMVV3XW,"Joni Durian is beautiful and has shown glimpses of talent in her other microbudget z grade horror movies (Babysitter Massacre, Haunted House on Sorority Row) and in each film I really wanted to see her more in the spotlight. So I purchased this hoping to see a film where she is center stage. Alas, though she is the star she spends most of the film bound and gagged ... which is cool if you like that sort of thing but that means the film is driven by plot and cinemagraphy and her co-star Minnie Grey.

now, Minnie is really good as a pyscho-photographer that tortures models. But the script doesn't give her much to work with and the film is shot in a way that tries to be trippy but the effects fail to bring you into her charcter's madness , rather they just make it seem like your TV is malfunctioning.

The lack of character depth, some of the plotholes, and the over the top gross out factor (which is always a fine line between creating a sense of eww and just being so much that the audience stops caring, I just didn't care by the 50 minute mark) makes this film difficult to finish

The sad part is it's like a first draft of an awesome movie...give these actresses some grounding in their characters, and then allow them to interact with more depth than Joni pleading and Minnie chewing scenery saying oddball stuff, and give the ending more emotion and it would be really good..but as it is...it's a mess",1430265600,6,1418,4.404580152671755
8679249,3,B00NMVV3XW,for the price it charge it could have been more action  i was a little disopointed,1429228800,,82,4.125
8679250,5,B00NMVV3XW,as a true and blu horror fan this is awesome work .........i love these kind of horror movies,1428192000,,93,4.222222222222222
8679251,3,B00NMVV3XW,If you are a fan of LOW budget horror movies then you will like this. Having said that the only thing that's good in this film is Nikki Seven!!! Sadly her part in this production is very short! Nikki Seven has an amazing YouTube channel and is a much bigger star then this film would indicate.,1428192000,,293,4.25

8679253,2,B00NMVV3XW,"I became familiar with Dustin Mills by watching Puppet Monster Massacre. I liked it, but thought it ran a bit long. So, I started buying pretty much everything he put out. I watched Kill that Bitch and Her Name Was Torment and found myself fast-forwarding, hoping to see something that sparked my interest other than the nudity. Torture and depravity just for the sake of it has pretty much ran it's course for me, and it bores me to see it over and over and over. So, what did Hornet's Sting have to offer that those didn't?  Pretty much nothing, same notion, different movie. I think Dustin has great potential as a filmmaker, but needs to break away from these types of movies for a while. Sure, there's a market for them, and I can appreciate nods to movies like Nekromantik, but there has to be more to offer. Maybe his new movie, Applecart, will be different, but Her Name Was Torment 2 and 3 are already on the horizon.",1422921600,2,926,4.447058823529412
8679254,1,B00NMVV3XW,I purchased this movie since I enjoyed another purchase that I had made by the same director Mills. That movie was Snuffet with puppets and it was something different for sure. I was hoping for another good film that was different from movies that I have seen before. This movie does not have a menu and it is on a DVD-r. The film contained nudity from the start to the end so that might get them some positives for that. I guess acting is harder for someone when they are nude but wow the acting was real bad in this one.  For a torture film it fell flat. The special effects in this one were also weak. It seems like this film was just put together after a night of some binge drinking. I guess the lead actress was supposed to have clients that paid for photos of people that are being tortured  but they didn't show any torture at all. The torture was watching the film from start to finish. They got me on this one as I wasted $15 on it. One out of two isn't bad I guess but stick with puppets Mr. Mills.,1420934400,10,1009,4.116751269035533
8679255,3,B00NMVV3XW,"The story to this film didn't make much since, but over all the movie is very well made. could have been longer. I recommend it.",1420156800,,128,4.16
