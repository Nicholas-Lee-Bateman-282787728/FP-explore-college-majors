1975346,4,B00016XO2E,"This DVD would be great if it was a little longer, but it's not that expensive so it's worth it.  Buy this AND Killadelphia and you'll have a great look at one of the best metal bands out there today.",1123718400,5,200,4.0
1975347,2,B00016XO2E,I'm a huge fan of Lamb Of God. But I mean this DVD is watch worthy but quality could have been alot better. Take my advise get Killadelphia. Know that is truely a DVD worthy of Lamb Of God.,1122768000,7,189,3.871794871794872
1975348,5,B00016XO2E,"Having bought this DVD alongside the Will Haven DVD; it became instantly apparent that this one was by far the best of the two. The feature on this DVD consists of live footage scatterred through an array of band interviews and just general band stuff. Some of the best stuff in here was The Blair Sh*t Project which was absolutley hilarious, and the interviews with the band. You really do learn a lot from it. As for the extras, there are videos for Ruin and Black Label, along with live footage of Pariah, The Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion, Ruin and In The Absence of the Sacred. Randy says something before each song to introduce it, and those sentences are always funny. Such as ""This song goes out to anyone you don't like, personally."" There is also a video of some strange kid and his parents who made a video for A Warning. Watch out for the guys Dad as he jumps with the gutair. A priceless image. There's also a sort of, bonus tab on the menu that opens up a video of the most dangerous thing to do in a mosh pit, ever. Overall, this DVD is short but complete. If you are a fan of Lamb of God or just a general metal fan, this will do you fine.",1105660800,10,1162,4.2152466367713
1975349,4,B00016XO2E,"This is very similar to the brilliant Pantera DVD, with live footage, and their videos.  But the real golden material is the boys just messing around...the part with Willy's pants is hysterical.  But it is rather short.  That is the only complaint.  But I think you'll dig it.",1078099200,3,276,4.6875
1975350,5,B00016XO2E,"While I must say this is something any fan can easily go without, it IS something fun to add to the collection. The first part of the DVD features a hilarious look at LoG behind the scenes, and has a few live clips. The second part is where all of the media is found. 2 music videos (Ruin and Black Label) and 4  live songs (Ruin, In the Absence of the Sacred, Pariah, and one more which I can't remember off the top of my head), and a couple other goodies. My only complaint is that the 11th hour music video isn't on it, which couldn't be shown for some stupid legal matters. However, for only 10 bucks this is a great grab and I would recommend it to any LoG fan.",1075161600,,666,4.045454545454546
1975351,4,B00016XO2E,"While Lamb of God's first DVD is far from disappointing, it's not perfect. Let's go thorugh all the features.
Feature- a ""documentary"" of sorts filmed by the band itself.  Very,very,very, hillariously funny, but it's just too short (around 30 minutes). Very good. 4 stars.
Extras - misc. stuff such as music videos and some live footage - very good, but could've included more live stuff.  Also, the video for 11th Hour is missing due to ""fines and legal restrictions"". Whatever. Very good. 4 stars.
Overall, a well rounded package for the Lamb of God fan.  Plus, it's only 10 bucks! Buy it now.",1074729600,4,595,4.757281553398058

8007398,5,B00016XO2E,"This is shorter in length than their other dvds, but still a good look at the band and the funny moments.  I'd recommend this for any Lamb of God fan.  The ""Blair S**t Project"" is especially hilarious and the commentary available is worth a listen.",1256342400,,248,4.488888888888889
8007399,5,B00016XO2E,Cool video! Kinda short but has great extras (hint: easter egg). By watching this I noticed that LOG is influenced by Pantera.,1181174400,,126,4.7727272727272725
