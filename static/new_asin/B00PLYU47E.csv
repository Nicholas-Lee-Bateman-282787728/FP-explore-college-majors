6818094,2,B00PLYU47E,"Mild Spoilers

This movie was ok, till the end.  When she shakes her head at her homeless friend for digging in the trash searching for food it disappointed me greatly.  She judged him when he did nothing but help her.  It's hard going up from the streets.  She was offered another job helping a kid find his dog, she could have asked if he would help her, and taken him to get some food.  If you're going to put these cheesy movies on Prime, that's ok, they're ok for kids. But offer some with better lessons than this.  Awful",1446854400,,527,4.262626262626263

6818099,1,B00PLYU47E,"This is a terrible movie! We tried to watch it with our six year old son, and had to turn it off after twenty minutes: bad acting, bad story, bad choices by this obviously unstable girl (script/plot - not actress - although she was not good at that either). We expected a 'dog' movie, but couldn't wait that long. A definite Hollywood basement production. Even tho it's 'free' with Prime, we should be able to get our twenty minutes 'time' back.",1441584000,2,445,4.506172839506172

6818108,2,B00PLYU47E,This Movie had great potential but it just didn't come through.

8688726,3,B00PLYU47E,"Zoey to the Max is an amateur looking film, the camera work at times both in choice of what to shoot (for example an RV driver we just see his hands on the steering wheel, or Zoey is shown by a camera walking on the other side of the road), as well as it's quality, the camera is shaky at times, and most of the times it's noticeable we're viewing the action through a camera lens . The songs in the background that make up the soundtrack are annoyingly irritating at times to. The acting by Cassidy Mack who plays Zoey, is good, although the writing for her character has her making really dumb decisions at times that if this wasn't a movie would have you fearing for her safety and that's she's not long for this world.  The same scenario for her friend in Palm Springs.  Grant Bowler and Amy Smart the only recognisable faces in this thing, do an adequate job, although neither have much screen time. Bowler plays the small town sheriff and Smart his wife who take in Zoey after she stows away in an RV and ends up in their town, while they await her LA foster parents getting back to them.  But the other actors in this are pretty bad, especially the alpha of the couple of dumb criminal dog abductors. I honestly can't recall seeing acting as bad as his in a movie before.  The movie is obviously very low budget, the best acting is from the dog.  Refreshingly this black lab gets abducted, and like a real dog just acts normal, so I'm with you guys now? Okay.  There's no trying to save the day, outwit the criminals, it just acts like a normal dog would, which is nice.

I'm guessing this movie was financed by the local council of the town of Palm Springs to try and put it on the map for visitors or perhaps people to relocate and live, as much of the movie has nothing happening, just Zoey and the dog playing on a large area of grass in the town, her at her new school where unlike LA everyone is really nice, or them going to some skate park and other cool activities area that kids of the town love.  Even when stuff eventually does happen involving Max (the dog) and the bad guys, you can't help but thinking why doesn't Zoey or her friend just ring the sheriff, give him the description of the car, it's number plate and tell him where his dog and the bad guys are, and have him arrest the dumb bad guys?  What is their goal in just following them other than putting themselves in danger of being abducted themselves or even killed?",1517529600,,2448,4.2813852813852815
8688727,1,B00PLYU47E,"The girl was borderline disturbing, and certainly disturbed. The way she kept ogling her foster father, weirdly clingy yet looking scared...and it was only him, not the mother. Maybe it's because I'm a psych major, but it kept making me wonder about her past. Ick. Not really suitable for a kid movie, in my opinion.

It looked like it was going to be a cute dog movie, and that's not what it is at all.",1495411200,,403,4.373333333333333
