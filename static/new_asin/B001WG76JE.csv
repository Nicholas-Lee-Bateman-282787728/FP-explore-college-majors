If you care about foreign affairs, you will enjoy this movie. If you don't know about foreign affairs, It will help you to understand it a little bit. It's a true story and that makes it more interesting. George Clooney, Matt Damon, Alexander Siddig, and Jeffrey Wright are superb!  Each line means something, so you can't get popcorn without pausing. I hope you enjoy it.",1430352000,,510,4.543478260869565
