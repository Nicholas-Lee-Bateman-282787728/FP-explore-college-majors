5183195,5,B008UE8ICK,"I just watched the world premiere English Dub on Neon Ally and I was thoroughly impressed. As any Berserk fan would suggest, read the manga. Don't have time to read the manga, then watch the original anime series. The movie is great as a stand alone, but is much better as a supplement to the original anime. The best part of the movie reboot is that it caters to the fan of the original English casted anime, in the sense that they managed to bring the original voice talent back, which, if you're like me, will blow your mind. If you're completely green to the Berserk universe, stop reading here.

The movie takes you along the visited path of the original anime, starting with the Bazuso fight (episode 2), hitting some major themes (ie. joining the Band of the Hawk, Zodd fight) and ending with the assassination/Giffith's talk with the princess regarding what he constitutes as being a ""friend.""

Although it speeds through the first block of the anime, it still hits on major tones that give you a feel for the direction the characters are heading and what feelings are beginning to brew. If I were to watch this movie without prior knowledge I would have little care as to what happens to the characters due to lack of character development given. However, having that prior knowledge makes the outing a blast and keeps you on the edge thinking ""what scene will they hit next.""

Take the movie for what it is, a supplement to the original anime, which in turn is a supplement to the manga. If you like the movie, watch the anime, if you like the anime, read the manga. I excited to see where it goes once the first three movies are completed. We can only hope that they continue on (albeit movies or a second series). Whatever the case may be, it's great that the original voice actors are back into it and hopefully will have some great bloopers for extras in this blu-ray release.",1351382400,15,1890,4.536656891495602
5183196,5,B008UE8ICK,"As a long time fan the only thing that worries me is... ""will they finish the story!"".  I watched this video as a fansub and was very excited to see it available here for pre-order!  SOLD!  I can't wait for the wife to go somewhere with the little ones and enjoy this in 5.1 surround and full HD!

The extra's (soldiers and such) tend to move a little like paper dolls which was a big disappointment.  But overall I was really happy with how the pages of the manga came to life.  I can't wait for more!  I had to go back to the old TV series and look at what satisfied me back in the 90's to realize how my standards have changed.. overall this is very well done.  I can't speak for the english voice acting though.....  I hope they don't disappointing either...",1351123200,4,762,4.2
5183197,5,B008UE8ICK,"First off, let me just say that I have read all of the manga in Japanese, and watched the anime in Japanese, so I cannot vouch for the English dubbing or subtitles in this title. So, I'm reviewing this assuming that the subtitles are at least decent. In my view, you shouldn't listen to the English dubbing if you really want to get the most out of your anime.

That out of the way, this anime is absolutely flawless in my view. The characters come across exactly as they should, the quality of the animation is extremely high, the music fits perfectly (and in places is really moving, expecially the intro/outro music), the action is extremely stylish (including very cinematic camera sweeps and whatnot in places) and the story although condensed, perfectly tells the story, hinting in places at things to come, and back-story yet to be told.

I absolutely CANNOT WAIT for the next instalment in this fantastic series to be brought to life! If you are looking for an anime with depth of story and character, look no further, this is a must-buy!",1349913600,3,1046,4.648648648648648
5183198,5,B008UE8ICK,"I'm going to start this review with a bit of backstory. This may be a long read but this is Berserk so I'm going to take my time and get this right.

The original Berserk anime is infamous for its massive cliffhanger ending. I was never into manga until I watched Berserk, then I simply HAD to read the manga, because I literally could not live with not knowing what happened next. The fact that Berserk is one of the most well drawn and well written (if poorly updated) manga series ever made.

For years the fans clamored for season 2, even after it became clear that it wasn't going to happen there were still some hold outs, but eventually even they died out as well. Then the past few years we have started to see a lot of old uncompleted anime series get reboots. Some like Ultimate Hellsing were just what the fans were waiting for, others like Inuyasha: Final Act were rushed and kind of disappointing. But if any anime deserved a reboot, it was Berserk. And now here it is, the long rumored Berserk reboot that we have waited for all this time.

Now I'm going to review the actual series itself of Berserk (be patient the movie review is coming).

I don't really look at Berserk like a manga, to me it's more like a great work of art, and it reads more like a classic novel that will survive the ages. It's also easily one of the best drawn series I've ever read. The detail Miura puts into his work is spectacular, and his stories are breathtaking. As we follow Guts on his journey we see him go from an aimless wanderer, to a soldier and a friend struggling to find his place in the world, to a revenge driven sociopath fighting his fate as he travels down his dark road, to a man doing his best to heal from the wounds inflicted upon his mind, body, and soul by the dark hand of fate.

His journey constantly exposes us to the very best and the very worst of humanity. We see the darkest and most depraved things imaginable happen in these pages, which only makes it all the more heroic when we see the characters we've come to love climb out from the darkness and hold on to their humanity against all odds. Berserk can make you cry one moment and laugh another, look on in horror at a characters depravity then cheer another's heroism.

There are really only two negative things I can say about this series. The first is that the updates are very irregular, Kentaro Miura will take very long breaks, and they kind of happen pretty often too. But what can I say; quality takes time, when you take a look at some of the artwork I can see why each page could take an entire day to create.

The only other thing isn't really a complaint since I don't have a problem with it, but as a warning to others the series is very dark. There are extremely brutal death scenes, with a lot of gore. There is also a lot of nudity, including some very graphic rape scenes. This series is NOT for the faint of heart, and certainly not for children.

Ok on to reviewing this actual movie, Im going to break it down into pros and cons.

Pros:

- Great quality. The animation is absolutely superb, and the battle scenes were stunning. In particular I want to praise the Guts vs Griffith fight as well as Zodd's transformation. In fact I actually want to praise Zodd's entire scene. The big battle scenes were also warrant mention (although I think I already did that).

- Excellent sound track, I loved the music in this movie. I didn't think it would be possible to top the soundtrack for the old anime, but this at least matched it.

- Good cast. I used to watch nothing but dubs, but after my girlfriend forced a few subtitled anime on me I've grown a great appreciation for Japanese voice actors and this movie has some great ones. Their also recasting the original VAs for the English dub, which I've always felt was one of the really good English dubs out there. So whether you're watching it subbed or dubbed you should be happy.

- The story is very compelling and manages to hold on to the feelings and themes of friendship and loyalty that are present in the original anime and the Golden Age manga arc.

- Most importantly to me, it wasn't rushed. Inuyasha: Final Act was clearly rushed, and was a big disappointment to the fans. Covering over two hundred manga chapters in 26 episodes is a disgrace, no matter how pretty the animation is. And I'm happy to say that Berserk did not make that mistake. There were a few scenes that were cut, but nothing important was lost. The most important scenes are still there and are handled well.

- This won't break your bank. Most anime is pretty expensive, but fifteen dollars (seventeen blu ray) is pretty good, especially for a movie that clearly had a very high animation budget.

Cons:

- While it wasn't rushed there are a few scenes that were left out. Most notably Guts' childhood is just covered in a series of flashbacks that don't explain much. While this didn't bug me, there might be a bit lost for those who haven't read the manga or seen the original anime.

- This is my main gripe, and the only thing that made me consider giving this less than a perfect five star rating. There are a few times during the CGI battle scenes where some of the characters faces get this kind of cheesy PlayStation 2 graphics look. It happens a few times during the opening castle siege, and once or twice during Guts' fight with Casca (that was what really bugged me because it was such an important scene). It didn't happen so often that it ruined the movie though, and the fans have been vocal enough about it that I'm sure it will be cleaned up for future movies.

So all in all this is a quality product. A great movie for old Berserk fans or newer people just coming to the series. I own the original Box of War anime set, as well as the remastered version, and every volume of the manga. I'll be proud come November to add this to my collection.",1346630400,128,5894,4.3662100456621005

The story just blows your mind if you just watch the anime because it finish really quickly and left some parts out but luckily they are still going with the manga
This movie should cover everything in the anime all 25 Episodes for newcomers to understand the story
Please get this you won't regret it

5183202,5,B008UE8ICK,"Been a huge fan of Berserk, both Manga and Anime series for over 20 years now. This film looks and sounds incredible! Much more brutal and violent then the original anime. I refused to listen to others about the CGI sucking...because it doesn't. I found the film very crisp and bloody. Action scenes are amazing and the sound offered on the disc is very loud and thrilling. However the film does not come with English subtitles. I was able to play the disc on both my Panasonic and PS3 players. I know the story well enough to understand the film. I love the art booklet this collection comes with along with a second disc that hold the soundtrack too. There is a commentary selection for the film but is in Japanese of course. If your a die hard fan and want to support the Berserk story then buy this. Otherwise you will have to wait till November to get the US release of the film which hopefully it is not butchered and censored. I can't wait to see the other 2 films and anyone else interested please SUPPORT BERSERK!!!",1344643200,5,1024,4.423280423280423

5183212,4,B008UE8ICK,"I owned the series as a kid in the 90's and still it's one of my favorite anime of all time. If you haven't seen the series then this retelling will seem full of holes. Fortunately, you can find the series online in HD for free on numerous sites if you want to gap those holes with information. That is why I can only give this four stars, another 40 minutes would have been sufficient to explain the rest. The voice acting is also pretty bland, standard for English versions of Japanese shows I guess. Why Americans are so bad at voice acting Japanese content? I sincerely do not know.

The animation though is bar none the best I've seen. It's fantastic and beyond praise worthy. The battlefield scenes are wonderfully done and the gore is just as vivid as I hoped it would be. This show/series/movie collection has some of the best mature content in all of anime. We get a powerful and masculine protagonist as well, something many and most anime's lack and in place, give us weak willed children to watch. The story in the manga is much more extensive and goes far beyond the end of the series and the end of these movies. So if you do like this then there is amply more content to enjoy.

5183229,3,B008UE8ICK,"A young wandering mercenary carrying a very large sword by the name of Guts, finds himself enlisted in a mercenary group called Band of the Hawks, which is being lead by the charismatic Griffith. The small group soon increases their numbers into an army; this leads them to side with the Kingdom of Midland whom have been at war with The Chuda Empire for 100 years. Griffith hopes to one day have his own kingdom, while Guts is pretty much at a loss on what he really wants. The two will soon come face to face with their true destiny. -summary

When it comes down to remakes and reboots of a beloved series and even movies; it's best to completely ignore what you've seen and loved once upon a time, and give the new material a fair shake. Unfortunately, there are titles where it's very difficult to do this, and the 2012 remake on the unfinished work Berserk is no doubt one of them. Part of me commended the creators for delivering an updated take on one of my favorite anime series of all time, while the other part kind of felt uneasy and restless. This is a take that long time fans will need to accept with a shovel of salt. New fans though, will probably find plenty of enjoyment.

The updated CGI animation is indeed a new addition and 5 years ago I would have shunned this for that alone, but since this animation technique has been prominent in anime for years now I can accept it. The battle scenes are still entertaining with some good choreography at times. Guts moves like lightening on some occasions with quick sword swipes in a fluid motion. There is some nice detail slashes and hacks that will give blood lusting action fans what they want. I also really did love the backgrounds; there really are some beautiful castle laden backdrops, that also helps towards Griffith's character development by shedding light on what exactly he's fighting for. The war torn battle fields can capture the carnage on occasion, and one moment even works towards its horror element on revealing a rather creepy individual. The soundtrack has more variety this time, so at least this area has been improved upon.

The plot follows Guts after he collects his money for winning a fight; he soon ends up with the Hawks and then quickly makes it to the rank of Captain. From here, the Hawks begin to work exclusively for the kingdom of Midland.

Those new to this series will not be as terribly bothered as fans whom are familiar with the original series. There's a decent amount of character development on the part of Guts and Griffith to at least either like or hate them. The plot delivers enough for one to want to move further; but even in the case of a newbie, I can imagine them feeling as if something is missing. There is this trace of things feeling rushed and just happening. This brings me to fans of the original and my own personal gripes.

This first movie feels very rushed and much depth of the original is lost. There's a reason for the chaos and carnage that I don't think is properly explained. Many of the characters are simply faces making a head count and are clearly lacking depth. I'm also not too pleased with the visuals in regards to setting its overall atmosphere. This movie feels way too clean lacking the grittiness of the original. At this point, I feel like Berserk shouldn't have been remade at all because it was clearly a product of its era when anime was far darker.

In closing, is this something everyone should see? Hard to say at this point since I'm on my way towards completing these three volumes. I will say that newbies should definitely check it out since they haven't seen the original, because there's nothing for them to compare this with.

Highs: Some good action and decent production values

Boy oh Boy was I wrong!

[Mini Spoiler ahead]

Guts, the main character, was born from his mothers corpse while she hung from a tree after a mass murder had taken place. Just let the gravity of this sink in before going on. Yes, now you realise just how intense this series is. and it gets even darker still.

Berserk is a masterpiece of Manga/Anime. Its a shame that all media works away from the actual Manga remove and omit so much from the story. This is only further exacerbated by the fact that the Anime Series is only 25 episodes long, Worse still would be that the films gloss over the anime with, yeah you guessed it, an even more stripped down version of what is in the Anime. (only the first film, which is a summary of about episode 2 to 11)

None of this matters because once you're hooked, its very hard to get out of the immersion. Themes of struggle,hardship,friendship,betrayal,revenge are all touched on and work in tandem to bring about a heart wrenching story. all this...and I am actually NOT a fan of anime.

5183244,4,B008UE8ICK,"These movies were originally meant to be one single animation, but due to the length, they were split into three. Therefore, my review of this movie will be taking the other two movies into account as well, due to the fact that if judged separately, they would not receive the appropriate praise that they should.

With that in mind, the three Golden Age Arc movies are a decent summary of one of the best manga ever written. I say summary because even though it does a fair job of making the original story come to life, it unfortunately still leaves out various crucial elements. While I believe that the animation studio did intend to recreate the original Berserk storyline, according to many of the fans I've spoken with (myself included), these movies are instead seen viewed as a kind of synopsis of the full story. While it is of course understood that during production, many events and other aspects must sometimes be cut out due to budgets and time constraints, the fact still remains that many significant events were either underdeveloped and shown with much scarcity or, in some cases, disregarded altogether.

The other issue that many fans have with these movies is the obvious use of CGI. While the motions and fight scenes of characters are in a sense, more realistic, the fact that the CGI is clearly visible in comparison to the regular animation (which makes up the remainder of the scene) makes things seem a bit strange. In short, I'd say that for the majority of the time that the CGI is used, it's obvious presence proves to be distracting. Through CGI, the level of motion, character, and background detail are all very impressive, however, I believe that when combined with regular animation, the result was an ""abnormal"" appearance for viewers.
Fortunately, in order to address some of these CGI related issues, a fan-edit of the movies has been made which also incorporates the original 1990's animation series of Berserk in an attempt to focus on improving both character development and much of the manga's plot which the trilogy left out. While there are still various important events omitted from the 1990's series as well, the combination of the series and the trilogy due a respectable job of getting as close as currently possible to the manga's story while still providing an exciting cinematic pace through the use of animation.

With all that said, despite it's flaws, I'm sure I speak for many fans when I say that any new Berserk related material is always exciting. While the results may not have been what we hoped, these movies provided a refreshing new perspective using modern techniques in order to present to fans, a new side of Berserk never before seen.

TL/DR: If you're unsure about starting the manga, either watch the movies or watch the 90's anime or better yet, watch the fan-made redux edit which incorporates both. Then dive into the manga and weep as all of your happiness and joy is slowly eaten away.

5183258,5,B008UE8ICK,"[No, I'm not serious. But the violence is far more realistic than the last anime incarnation of 'Berserk'.]
If you've ever wanted to see a realistic film depiction of Medieval siege-warfare, well... go elsewhere. `Berserk' is a strange, hyper-violent vision of European sword and sorcery, from a Japanese POV. It looks like the dark ages, but there's no historical connection whatsoever; instead, it serves as a brutal playground for Kentaro Miura's twisted imagination.

This film trilogy is actually a reboot; it takes the viewer back to the first meeting of Guts the Black Swordsman and The Band of the Hawk, rather than acting as a sequel to the first series. It's different from the manga as well, but retains the essence of the tale.
While I liked the original anime, I wasn't terribly impressed with the animation. This film, as well as the two that follow, are spectacular in comparison. The blend of animation and CGI isn't flawless, but it's pretty damn good, providing much more detailed art and realistic movements.

While this movie could be a bit longer (namely to improve overall character development), it serves as quite a feast for the eyes and an excellent reduction of a series-to-movie!",1408060800,4,392,5.046153846153846
5183275,4,B008UE8ICK,"Intro:
Beware, this is not for children. As a fan of both the manga and the original anime, I found a lot to like here. A dark story, some pretty animation, a well acted dub; but the movie is not without its flaws as well.

Animation 3/5
The animation in the smaller fights is beautiful, although the larger-scale battles suffer from some strange animation choices. The CG portions of the movie can be quite ugly and the framerate is surprisingly low at some times. By all means, this did not break the experience for me, but I did find myself pulled out of the moments a bit. (Heads up, the animation gets better as the trilogy goes, the third is beautiful!)

Audio 4/5
The english dub of this is surprisingly good, with the major characters reprising their roles (the japanese actors have been mostly replaced). It seems to me that the actors have improved greatly since the original berserk was released in the U.S. The music is fitting, although nothing really jumped out at me either. The beginning song is much more appropriate than the original anime's in my opinion. My only complaint is that the range is quite large, without Dynamic Range Control on the movie can be extremely jarring when going into a battle scene. This is coming from a guy who generally likes a decent amount of range.

Story 5/5
I adore Berserk's story and world. It is a very dark world, where bad things happen to good people on a regular basis. It is not sugar-coated to make this time period appear to be that of happiness and wonder. One issue would be that the running time of this first movie leaves out some moments that I missed, but nothing that is of any extreme importance.

Overall 4/5
This is a great movie to add to your collection if you are a fan of dark fantasy, especially to those of you who already enjoy A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones to TV viewers) and I thoroughly recommend it to both fans and those who've never heard of it alike!",1406505600,,1946,4.457865168539326

5183277,1,B008UE8ICK,"Don't bother with this release. As a long time fan of the Berserk franchise (ever since it was first published in the states) I was massively excited for these films only to be as equally disappointed. That being said, the film does have a few things to its merit.

1. When the film is using hand drawn animation, the film looks simply GORGEOUS. That being said, it makes the contrast all the more jarring when the film switches to very, very poor CGI animation. The quality of this CGI is on par with something you'd see in early to mid era PS2 and Xbox games and there are instances where the film swaps between hand drawn animation and cgi on the fly.

Another major issue is the pacing. As the very large Golden Age arc of the manga is being done in film format, alot of content from the manga and even the original anime is streamlined or straight out removed. Key character development scenes are often glanced over or told through a very strange shutter effect, only giving images with little to no dialogue explaining exactly what is going on.

These problems persist throughout the other two Golden Age films as well. As a long time fan I can only say that you avoid these films and opt for the the manga and/or the original anime, which covers this entire arc in much greater detail. These films do no justice for the franchise.",1405555200,12,1338,4.475409836065574

However, due to my own impatience while waiting for more volumes, I decided to rent BERSERK: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King. I'm not sure how closely this movie follows the manga, but it was definitely an enjoyable watch itself. The animation is a good blend of 2d and 3d styles. The latter being used mostly for scenes with a large amount of characters on screen at once. Although, it is sometimes used for scenes that I believe would look much better if they had a traditional style. From what I understand, many of the English voice actors from the original anime reprise their roles in this movie.

5183290,4,B008UE8ICK,"Berserk- arguably one of the most badass, dark, graphic and utterly disturbing manga and anime series to have been created in the last 30 years. When the first anime series came out most fans of the manga were taken aback by how the series follows just the backstory of the lead protagonist in lieu of his other exploits, but still found themselves drawn to the show nonetheless.
As many of you know finding the original Berserk anime series on DVD at a reasonable price is nigh impossible, and if manage to find it and watch it start to finish you're left with a want of more. Much more.
I'm not going to lie. The Golden Age Arc is a recap of the original series, part one basically cramming all of the major plot elements of the first ten episodes into a 75 min runtime. It has all the original voice actors (thankfully) and miraculously still maintains the spirit of the original after all these years.
First drawback (not counting the crammed narrative) the animation style changes. Action scenes are handled via CGI, and while it looks fine, its very jarring when suddenly everything is in hand drawn style. Some of the character models deviate more from the original works such as Casca having lighter skin or Griffith SOMEHOW looking more effeminate, but these are minor nitpicks that don't ruin the experience.
Be forewarned now! There are some awkward moments in this that go above and beyond in making you question certain characters. If you're familiar with this IP you know what I'm talking about.
Aside from this there is little to complain about. I wish the DVD featured more special features like outtakes or a documentary on the reboot or even the creator of the series. It's action packed, has some nudity, violent, and Guts still is a badass. Also, I'm not sure if they will cover this in other movies for this arc but the first film really didn't give any backstory to Guts besides he was raised horribly. Granted if you know about his character then it's a mute point, but having that glimpse into his past makes him all the more relatable.
I suspect that this trilogy is leading up to a continuation of the series after the final act Eclipse (or Descent as they are calling it). I'm hoping like hell it will mean a Black Swordsman Arc and other major acts in the manga series that fans were denied when the original series ends. Who's to say for now.
Highly recommend, but nothing new besides a paintjob and some alterations.",1393718400,,2446,4.625287356321839

5183304,4,B008UE8ICK,"The red is a lot to like about this adaptation on the manga in movie form. The animation is excellent and well drawn.it looks much better than the anime series. Their is some nice looking CGI.I would also commend them on the quality of the voice actors. My understanding is that it uses some of the voice actors from the anime series. The show is dark,violent and just as bloody and violence as the manga or anime. There is plenty of action,intrigue and likable characters. People who who like sword and sorcery type fantasy may love this. As a fan who is really into beserk it was nice to see something done with on the animation side of things.

I do have a few issues with this however. While the CGI is pretty good I could have done without it to be honest. The back ground music is forgettable in my opinion. The anime series have very good back ground music that I actually still have on my mp3 player even now. I am surprised they could not have done better in this area or at least used the anime series background music. One huge problem is the amount of time they have is not enough to go over the largest amount of materia they have to cover. Because of this the film's rushes through certain events quickly. Personally it might have been better to just leave some things out rather than fly through them. The fast pace hurts when it comes to developing an attachment to the characters and understanding all of the little plots and issues going on with the story line. My biggest complaint is that it is going over material that was covered in the anime series already. The majority of people who will be Watching this are most likely fans who have been eating to finally see material after the eclipse. They could have skipped all of this as far as I am concerned as the anime series dealt with this part of the manga better.

In all worth buying for fans of the manga and people that like this type of entertainment. For fans looking for new material it may not be worth it to be honest. For newer fans I would suggest watching a friend's copy of this and buying the anime series as it does the portion of the manga far better than this does.

5183307,3,B008UE8ICK,"I would like to start by saying I'm a big Berserk anime fan! I have not read the Manga comics so this review will be in comparison to the original series anime!

 In my opinion, what made Berserk great was character development, detailed emotions in every still image as well as emotions in the characters voice! I typically watch titles in their native language but, Berserk's voice actors did a very good job in English! Even though they got the same actors to the voices, they seem uninterested this time around and it all sounded really forced specially because of the lack of facial expressions in the characters!

 Character development is non existent, you can't really get a feel for the relationship between Guts, Casca and Griffith. Ricket, Judo and Corcus has been totally left out of the picture!

  I understand that there's only so much you can fit into a movie but it seems that they invested most of the movie time in battle scenes rather than the story and character development!

  Yes, all of the key points of the series are there but, because of a lack of detail you almost don't get a feel for it or you can't really follow it!

  the details in scenes has greatly improved, specially the battle scenes! that is really the only improvement, everything else fell short!

 I say this is a typical remake because that's what everyone is doing with movies and tv shows now days, they take a popular movie or tv series that had great story line, plot, actors, script, directing, etc... put a bunch of CGI in it and sell because, everyone in their mid twenty's and younger think it's great!

 We are a generation that's giving praises to technology rather than imagination and creativity!

  for those who have seen this movie and not the original anime series, give the original series a shot!
I guarantee you will enjoy it more and feel satisfied!

 If you're not going to lose sleep over $20 I'd say go ahead and get it or watch on instant play but, this doesn't even come close to the original!",1380672000,,2014,4.582633053221288

Pros:
- some nice bonus footage
- ok scene transitions
- brief nods to the manga

Cons:
-if I wanted bad frame rates I'd run multiple YouTube vids at once......
-removed epic soundtrack
-removed almost all characters personal thoughts
-removed strong scenes from original series
- too reliant on CGI (like bad wii graphics everywhere)

5183315,5,B008UE8ICK,"I've been an anime fan since watching Speed Racer as a child. Growing up with it, my particular taste in both these films and television shows has become very specific. I still like a great number of them, from across just about every genre. However, only a few titles have moved me and caused me to feel like I ""need"" to, ""have to"" purchase them. This one, this series, is the last to make me feel that way. Before it - have been only: Basilisk, Claymore, Wicked City, The Guyver: Bio-Booster Armor {1992 on tape), Ninja Scroll, Fatal Fury and a few others. The ones named are just some of my favorites and give you an idea of my particular taste in these films/series. I honestly feel like the Berserk series is right up there with these other titles; titles that have become classic films. So, if you're a fan of any or all of the other films I've named ... you really don't want to pass this one up!",1376870400,,903,4.317647058823529

5183318,5,B008UE8ICK,"For those familiar with the Berserk anime and/or manga, this is the first movie in a trilogy that covers the Hawks arc.  The movie version does skip over certain scenes and shortens others for the sake of time, so it helps to have seen the original anime series or read the manga.  If you haven't, this is still a great movie but it might seem like some character development is missing and that's because it is.  This movie series is like a thank you letter to all the fans who have been following the series all these decades.  Don't expect to see every single scene from the anime or manga.

So how is this a thank you letter?  Because it's absolutely beautiful. The art and animation quality in this are by far the best I have seen in any anime.  It's like an animated painting.  The battle scenes are very well done and they are probably the biggest draw here.  I would definitely say that this is a must have for any Berserk fan.",1376611200,,935,4.327586206896552
5183319,5,B008UE8ICK,Animation is awesome.  Adaption from manga was pretty good.  Heavily edited for time constraints but still very well done!  A must own for Berserk fans.  Hope they continue the movie series beyond the Golden Age Arc!,1376265600,,216,4.916666666666667

5183321,4,B008UE8ICK,"I have to admit I was just a tad disappointed with The Egg of The King; mostly due to how the animation could sometimes make it look like you're watching someone play a video game instead of the first part of an animated dark Byronic Fantasy epic. The story is good (if massively condensed) but since this is trying to adapt so much into about an hour and a half-ish some of the characters can come off as one dimensional. If you've read the manga or seen the old tv series (and if you like the old shows dub you'll be pleased to know they bought back the voices of Guts, Griffith, and Casca) you'll have an easier time understanding what's going on. Be all that as it may I still suggest buying this just so we can (hopefully) FINALLY move past The Golden Age in animated form someday.",1375833600,,786,4.281879194630872

5183323,4,B008UE8ICK,"While I do enjoy the new animation, you need to at the very least watch the TV series before watching this.

Now I'm not a person who is fanatic about saying ""You have to read the book!"" I think a book and/or movie can be enjoyed separately. But with this reboot I'm definitely going to say that.

It's not because I'm sore about the information that got left out (even though I am a bit). It's because it feels like a rushed plot. You don't really get to know the characters, important parts aren't given the pauses they deserve. It really does just skip around to the main events. The excitement is just sucked right out of it. It's exactly like watching those 1-2 minute recaps at the beginning of TV shows. You know like, ""Last time on..."" Only for this film it lasts for an hour.

If you don't read manga, the TV series will give you the story, this movie will give you the updated animation to imagine it in. (I guarantee you'll want to read the manga after you watch the show.)

PS Berserk is an awesome series. Watch the show, read the manga. I don't read manga, but the show pushed me to read this one. The TV series is really good about being true to the manga also. I've watched it while reading it side by side with the manga, and they pretty much just copy the panels right out of the pages for about 95% of the series.",1375228800,,1332,4.232283464566929

Animation is pretty good overall but they CG most of the minions and battle scenes.",1373155200,,393,4.444444444444445
5183327,3,B008UE8ICK,"I've been a Berserk fan for a long time now. Being introduced to the series through the 90s anime, I've went on to read the manga as well. Unfortunately, I have to say that both of those are far superior to this film adaptation. If you're just looking to see if this is worth your time as an intro to this great series, I'd say skip this and watch the anime TV series instead.

Why is this mainly for established fans already you ask? Given how limited the time frame for a movie is, the story and more importantly the character development gets drastically abridged. You get plenty of that berserk action sure, but if you aren't familiar with the characters or story, you'll be scratching your head as characters are introduced and develop relationships off screen. Leaving you with a feeling of, ""Who are you people? And why should I care?"".

Besides the story, character development, and pacing issues the movie is a solid bit of action entertainment. The art work is top notch and the digital effects give it an interesting flare (though it might turn some people off).

So to conclude, this movie is kind of a mixed bag for new comers to the series, with better stuff out there for you to enjoy (tv series and manga). For fans of berserk, you won't mind the short comings and enjoy some new content to add to the collection.",1373155200,2,1329,4.5062240663900415

The story and characters are pretty standard if not downright clich, but still enjoyable.
My main complain is the absurd amount of CGI, I like anime because of the art, apart of the given fact of expecting a good story.
I would say almost 80% of the movie is CGI, and sometimes it is not painfully obvious but painfully bad, If I wanted to
see hours of cell shading I would have played ""Tales of Symphonia"" instead.
Still I would like to see the conclusion, just for closure.",1369699200,,528,4.453608247422681
5183338,3,B008UE8ICK,"I am a HUGE fan of Berserk.  However, this movie has jarringly bad CGI at times, and has more content left out than the anime series had - in other words, this is more of a supplementary entry in the franchise than a replacement for the dated anime series, which is a shame when you consider the technology available to them after so many years.

I'll probably end up buying the second and third movies just because as a diehard fan in the States, we're not given many opportunities to actually enjoy Berserk.  But in no way am I validating this movie or the others in doing so.

On its own, it's a decent enough film.  The pacing is quick, the battle scenes are exciting, and there are some moments between characters that are well done.

It would have been vastly improved by an expanded soundtrack by Susumu Hirasawa, who really understood the fantasy that Miura was going for, and with a complete overhaul or outright removal of the CGI elements.  A longer run time to actually explain half of the supporting characters would go a long way toward the impact the third movie will have on the cast.",1369267200,,1100,4.49748743718593

Here was my newbie impression of Berserk part 1:
-CGI was amazing, especially the detailing and the impact of battle scenes.
-However the same impressive motion got annoying when it was a mob scene of armors standing in the square, moving a foot here, raising a shoulder there...EVERYONE was bobbing slightly up and down. I understand this is realistic movement, but for the sake of animation, i wish the mobs were less distracting. This is why i took a star off.
-Original Japanese cast is amazing and I thought the dub was OK too.
-The other reviewers say a lot was left out from the manga. No wonder i was sometimes lost.
-Cliffhanger ending, keeps you excited so that you HAVE to watch part 2!! Which will be out very soon :)

In the end, I think this is a great film adaptation of the chapters it covers.
There are some minor bits that are cut from the original anime that may help build a little more of an emotional connection to certain characters, but when you have to condense these chapters down into 2 hours segments - cuts have to be made.

5183350,3,B008UE8ICK,"In 1990, the manga series ""Berserk"" was published by Hakusensha for Jets Comics.  Created by Kentaro Miura, the series would be serialized in ""Young Animal"" and a 25-episode episode anime series was made.  Also, video games and now an animated film series.

With the first animated film ""Berserk Golden Age Arc 1: The Egg of the King"" released in Japan on Feb. 2012 and in the U.S. courtesy of Viz Media on Blu-ray in Nov. 2012.

The second animated film ""Berserk Golden Age Arc 2: The Battle for Doldrey"" was released in theaters in Japan on June 2012 while the third animated film ""Berserk Golden Age Arc III: Descent"" was released in theaters in Japan on Feb. 2013.  The other two animated films have also been licensed by Viz Media.

While many fans are drawn to the series for its medieval storyline, its violent action-packed storyline and its characters, for some, it has been a series that Kentaro Miura has taken his time with, as one to two volumes of the manga series are released each year.  And as of 2o13, a total of 36 volumes have been released.  So, for 20 years, this storyline has been released slowly but still is going strong and admired by many readers internationally.

As the films feature different animated artwork and voice acting since its 1997 anime series, the animated film series is produced by Studio 4C and is directed by Toshiyuki Kubooka (""Gin Rei"", ""Gunbuster""), screenplay by Ichiro Okouchi (""Angelic Layer"", ""Azumanga Daioh"", ""Brave Story"", ""Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion""), music by Shiro Sagisu (""Bleach"", ""Kimagure Orange Road"", ""Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water"", ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" series and films), character design by Naoyuki Onda (""Armitage III"", ""King of Thorn"", ""Ergo Proxy"") and art direction by Goki Nakamura (""King of Thorn"", ""Ghost in the Shell II: Innocence"", ""Cat Soup"") and Yusuke Takeda (""Armitage IIII"", "".hack/Quantum"").

VIDEO:

""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  The first thing that long time fans will see the creative difference that Studio 4C brings to character designs but also giving a new look with detailed art backgrounds and the studio's integration of 2D and 3D which they are known for.  The anime is colorful, while not super detailed when it comes to shading of the characters, the art backgrounds and mechanical designs are quite pleasing to watch.

But I'm sure viewers will have a subjective opinion towards the overall look of the film versus how things looked in the original 1997 anime series and compared to the manga series.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King is presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD MA with English subtitles.  The dialogue and music is crisp and clear and while most surround usage is during the action sequence, the film utilizes a wonderful score from the legendary anime composer Shiro Sagisu.  The voice acting is well-done on both Japanese and English soundtracks but it's important for people to know that the voice acting does not utilize the same talent from the original 1997 animated TV series.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King"" comes with a production art gallery.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For someone who follows ""Berserk"", part of me was excited that a new animated film was created because so many people have been waiting for more ""Berserk"" for a long time.  The manga is released slowly and suffice to say, when I was following this series, It was not long after graduating from high school.  And like many people who have grown up with this series, nearly 30-years have past and it still has not concluded.

So, I think that for fans, seeing ""Berserk"" as an animated film is exciting...

But there is a problem when it comes to animated films that are based on the manga series and are not standalone stories.  And the fact is that only so much storyline can be included in an abridged version of the film.

With the animated TV series having been released in Japan (and hopefully in the U.S. in the near future), people can watch and get a better idea of the storyline of Guts.

In fact, the animated film tries to cover seven episodes featured in the anime series in 76 minutes and that's pretty tough.  While we see images of Guts and his adoptive father Gambino in short flashbacks, we miss out on important details of how Guts killed him.

So, there is just more story that is featured in the anime and manga series than what is seen in the animated film.

It would have been great if fans got an all new standalone story, not an abridged version of what was seen on television and the manga series because the animated series was well-done for its time and what people are expecting is a continuance of the story and something new.

So, in essence, what viewers are watching is an abridged film utilizing today's animation technology with 2D and 3D implemented courtesy of Studio 4C.

While two more films are yet to be released on Blu-ray, I still found ""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King"" to be enjoyable and for those who are not interested in reading the manga series or watching the old school animated series will surely find the animated film series to be good enough for them.

For those new to ""Berserk"", it's important for them to know that like the animated TV series and the manga, this is one of the most violent series that was featured in Japan. And that violence carries onto the animated series.  There is a lot of blood, a lot of decapitations, bodies cut apart, guts spilling out... this is a series that will appeal to those who like violent swordfighting action.

The Blu-ray features a colorful pallete with beautiful art backgrounds and utilization of 2D and 3D was good, dialogue and music was crystal clear but not too immersive as I would have hoped.  And special features is only a production gallery and that's it.

Overall, ""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King"" is an entertaining yet violent action animated film based on the manga series.  While those who want the story may want to opt for the manga or 1997 anime series, for those with no interest in reading past volumes or watching the old school animated version will enjoy this first part of the ""Berserk: The Golden Age"" trilogy.",1364601600,,6325,4.693840579710145

It's not as good as the original Beserk as it's not as in depth, but if you've seen the original series, read the manga, or just love Anime in general than this is for you!!! 4 stars though because they don't have the Guts song in this one :'(",1364256000,,334,3.8550724637681157

now these awesome Movies.. can't wait for the second and third movies..",1363910400,,211,4.435897435897436
5183353,4,B008UE8ICK,"Gonna be short and sweet here. Story is faithful the manga, with some stuff missing for budget and time-constraint purposes I'm sure. Guts' voice is back, which is awesome. Animation can be problematic though, with the lame CGI. Some of the movements don't seem very fluid, which sucks because seeing Guts in action demands top-notch animation quality and fluidity. They improved on the animation a lot in the second, so it's no so bad.",1363910400,,436,4.905405405405405

5183355,4,B008UE8ICK,"I am one of those people that found out about Berserk through the original anime series, and as a result ended up following the story through the manga after that, actually reading it from the beginning. In the last few years I have been hoping that someone would decide to continue the anime, and when I found out about this new project I was happy, even though I knew that the story would start back from the start.

Even though I have already experienced the events in this film through both the anime and the manga, there was plenty for me to like here. I found the graphics to be very crisp and vivid. The characters are portrayed accurately and the mood of the series is respected. Some scenes, like Guts confrontation with Zodd are above and beyond what we have experienced in the past.

The only reason why I am taking a star away is because they did not have time to provide as much detail as in the anime series. Therefore, for those people that have not experienced Berserk in the past, it will probably be a challenge to understand everything that is going on. On the other side, it will probably make them want to find out more and watching the original series and reading the manga is a very good idea.

I am looking forward to the next movie, and I hope that there are many more after that so we get to see the story continue in this format.",1363305600,,1356,4.330708661417323
5183356,3,B008UE8ICK,"I have been a fan of anime ever since I was 11 years old and I saw the original Guyver Bio-Booster Armour . For years Guyver reigned as my all time favourite anime, that is until I came across the original Berserk. At the time I wasn't really familiar with the fact that anime is derived from Manga and so I had no idea that there was more of the story to tell. I remember when I saw the mind blowing final episode of the original how annoyed I was there was no season 2. So naturally you can imagine how happy I was when I found out they were finally making more Berserk Anime.  I must admit I was a little disappointed when I discovered the new anime would be a series of movies that would tell the story from the beginning.  However I just couldn't resist getting this movie.
Before I say anything else the producers of the English version deserve a hell of a lot of praise for getting the original cast back to do this. Heck they even managed to get the guy who does Goku's voice to return for the bit part character he voiced in the original. I noticed the character of Pippin doesn't say anything and I can't help but wonder if it is because they couldn't get the original voice actor on board. If that is the case than they only deserve more praise for staying faithful, (which in this day and age is a true rarity that I am extremely grateful for.)
With that said the first thing that struck me about this was the animation. While I am glad the production values are high because that indicates a large budget and so it represents how dedicated they are, the fact is it is just too nice and clean. I really missed the dark and gritty art of the original. I mean the world of Berserk is dark and gritty they should have kept it that way. Speaking of which while this version remains bloody the violence has been toned done somewhat, strangely though they have no problem showing full frontal nudity. As a purist I did find the delusion of blood a tad annoying.
Another big problem is the fact that since this is a series of movies, a lot of important details are glossed over or simply not mentioned. That makes it very difficult for the new audience to really get invested. As I understand it this is their attempt to eventually make all of the Manga into a series. Which would explain why they started at the beginning, to allow important characters from the Manga such as Puck and Skull Knight to be involved (Although neither make an appearance in this movie but they probably will appear in later movies.)
This does have its share of problems and I still would have really preferred a second season instead. However at the end of the day I am just happy that they are making more Berserk anime. For potential new fans I strongly recommend checking out the original series as it is far superior before coming anywhere near this one.",1363305600,5,2843,4.352165725047081
5183357,4,B008UE8ICK,"I ordered Berserk complete season I so this one is the same with complete season 1 but just the beginning of Episode, not all of it but the picture is more clear if someone love blue ray so you know how it works! nice package with fast delivery!",1363219200,,245,4.125
5183358,5,B008UE8ICK,"I really liked this reboot of berserk I hope they continue to make these. It would be nice to see them follow the manga which is still ongoing I think.

I really liked the voice acting too I think they kept the same actors been a while since I saw the older version.",1362960000,,266,4.018867924528302
5183359,2,B008UE8ICK,"First, to get one thing out of the way, I received this item as a gift.  So I do own it and have watched it, despite the lack of the ""Amazon Verified Purchase"" status.  Having cleared the air on that, here is my review.

I must strongly recommend against any Berserk fan from purchasing this movie.  This is nothing more than an abridged, re-make of the original Japanese television series.  It is even audacious enough to re-use the exact same lines, the exact same scenes, and the exact same choreography.  One would think that, being a more recent title, that at least the animation would be upgraded and some of the fight scenes creatively re-invented, but no.  If anything, the story is noticeably less dark in this version compared to the anime and thus the characters and their motives lack the same level of power and depth.

If you're craving Berserk, do yourself a favor and re-watch the anime.  This version is less a revision than it is an imitation.",1362873600,4,962,4.6117647058823525

5183363,5,B008UE8ICK,"Don't buy if you are blood shy or wheasy. There is a lot of violence in this movie, blood, a moderate amount of fighting, even some gay jokes and some boobs and butt.

While the overall execution and polish of this is much better than the original series, the character development and sense of atmosphere are not there in this.  The original music composer is back but that violent, tragic, and beautiful feeling is just not there.

5183373,5,B008UE8ICK,"Even though it never ended. I am a big fan of the Berserk anime that came out years ago. I even have the old video game that came out for Sega Dreamcast. But when I watched this new Berserk which is a re-telling of the original story, I was impressed.
The animation was awesome, so was the score, and I cant wait for Arc 2 to come out! Hopefully they will finish the story unlike the old anime! Gutsu Rocks!",1360540800,,407,4.1
5183374,5,B008UE8ICK,"Let me start off by saying that I have been a fan of the original series since I was around 9 years old. YES, nine years of age, watching this gruesome anime with my uncle late at night after my aunt went to bed. I fell in love with the story, the characters, and the music. When the end came I was so shocked and distraught, but what a great ending. When I watched this movie I got the same feeling all over again. Now as a fan for 14 years, I know the characters and I know their back story, and I do have to say that these recent movies skip by some character development. They also skip past some of the repetitive, albeit meaningless battles from the anime. Yes it is important to flesh the characters out, and show that Griffith has cunning strategy, and Guts is just a brute that enjoys the sparks of battle, but movies don't have the option to spend as much time on things like anime do. They don't do some characters justice, but it's not a ""travesty"" as some people claim. They show you their reactions to situations and you do get the feeling of the bonds they've developed along the way. Not as strongly as the anime, but they are there.

The hand drawn animation is top-notch with brilliant colors and details. As many people state in their review the CG is the worst part about these movies. It's a shame really that they couldn't do it all by hand, but I understand their decision. If they had drawn the battles like the original manga and anime it would have taken longer to produce, more money and drawn away from other aspects that have great focus. By the end of the movie the CG doesn't feel as offsetting as it did in the beginning, and it gets much better in the second movie. The music is a recreation of a different kind, but doesn't necessarily lose the theme of the original anime such as war, compassion and creepiness. Overall I rate this movie a 5/5 for being an honest rendition of the anime, as a studios best attempt to recreate a legendary story. I am excited for the third film, and hope that they continue the project beyond the 25 episode anime story arc of The Golden Age.",1360368000,,2109,4.312342569269521

Yes this is a remake or upgrade as I would put it but when you wait so long for something that's this awesome you will take anything you can! I'm hoping if enough people purchase this they will continue to make it a series. I hope to god they do! If you have never seen this anime and want something way better then what they were throwing at you on toonami or adultswim then my friends you are in good hands!

I just wish that it wouldnt have just went off so soon.  Now I have to wait for the next one.",1359590400,,190,3.5
5183380,4,B008UE8ICK,"When I heard of the Berserk movies my heart was filled with so much excitement and joy. Finally, someone took the time and money to bring this amazing story to a full fledge movie. Even more so, when I found out that they would keep it as true to the manga as possible. I mean if you ever read the manga series, then you know how much depth each and every character has. And that is something worth putting into a full length movie.

Before I go into the movie I just want to talk briefly about the animated series. The animated series was not exactly true to the manga, because it excluded some major characters, such as the Skull Knight. However, it was really close to the actual manga, even the art work was true to the manga. It is a rare piece were artwork, screenplay, and musical score come together to create an epic masterpiece. So you can imagine my high expectations for the movie.

Sadly, the movie did not meet my expectations. I really try hard to not be so bias because of the animated series, but it was nearly impossible. I just couldn't believe some of the flaws in the movie. I mean there are very excellent examples of this storyline both in manga format as well as animated series. Yet, somehow the creators of the movie missed it. For example,

* Characters are not allowed to mature, enough to allow an emotional involvement with the plot. This is crucial for what is to come.

* Soundtrack is nowhere nearly as powerful as the animated series. Susumu Hirasawa did the intro song in the movie and ending song (I believe), which are great, versus him doing the entire soundtrack in animated series. The overall score in the movie is pretty dull in comparison to the series.

* The CG animation are of poor quality. I understand it cuts production cost, but at the cost of what? It really was the nail in the coffin for me, so it dropped from 5 to 4 for me.

I know this might sound negative, but the movie did have its pluses.

* It shows promise of exploring more characters than animated series, as you will see in opening credits.

* Even though they cut out a lot of scenes from the manga, for the ones they kept, you can tell they try to be true to the manga. That's an effort well received.

* Animation is pretty good (minus CG). I prefer animated series over the movie, but the animation in the movie is not bad at all.

* It promises to go further than the series was able to. This means we will finally get to see on HDTV's the Skull Knight come to the rescue, how Guts met Puck, and maybe even Guts berserker armor.

Overall I think the movie is a solid 4 out of 5. So if you are a Berserk fan and haven't got this yet I recommend getting it. For a person new to the Berserk universe I recommend the animated series first (unless you want to go even deeper, then I would recommend reading the manga), then buy this movie. Otherwise I'm afraid you might not fully grasp the amazing characters and storyline that is Berserk.",1359244800,3,2956,4.317689530685921
5183381,4,B008UE8ICK,"I have been a fan of Berserk for quite a few years now, and I was not disappointed in the retelling.  The animation doesn't seem as gritty, but at least they seem to have gotten most, if not all, of the original voice actors.",1358985600,,225,4.113636363636363

5183383,5,B008UE8ICK,"I would like to assume anyone here watched the old ones and/or read the mangas. How else would you know about it? Yes it skips some stuff and jumps around but I really can't complain because after I was left hanging from the previous anime for 12 years I was excited someone took the reins. Not only that, they get the old English voice actors back... CASCA PLEASE!!! This is awesome. I say we all support this so the series isn't lost. I'm thankful for these ""movies"" and hope they continue on after the third one.

If you like Berserk you should love this. Even if you are a super picky fan boy you know all the details from reading the mangas anyway so let it go. Rejoice! WATCH IT! LOVE IT! SUPPORT IT! EVEN WITH CHANGES IT WAS STILL SUPER AWESOME! To each their own thou.",1358985600,,776,4.27891156462585

However, I don't think a completely new viewer who hasn't watched the original berserk anime or has read the actual Berserk manga would be impressed by the story and how it seems to jump to one major event to the other without much explanation or set up.

If you love Berserk like, you have to watch it just to see the updated animation which is right up there with the best of them but it provides nothing really new, in fact, you are losing a lot of the story because they are giving us 70 minutes of an anime show that had 25 24 minute episodes.",1358726400,7,666,4.328

5183390,1,B008UE8ICK,"I am going to start by saying Berserk the series is my second favorite anime of all time, but this Golden Arc story has reduced it to Naruto mindless action that should not even carry the same name.  All the character development is gone our of Guts, Caska, and especially Corkus who has none of the personality from the original anime.  The story is rushed, and the battles have no build up of suspense to make it feel any different than any other anime on the market.  If you like action then you will initially like the animated battles, but even those get tiresome as the movie's overdramatized flare takes away from the struggle it is supposed to represent.  The worst part of this anime is the dialogue, once one of the best written animes I have seen, now reduced to a childish dribble that makes it feel like I am watching an episode of Pokemon.  I am glad my friend bought this instead of myself, because it is money wasted, get the original series or watch this movie series free on the internet. To go further into the disconnected ""action scenes"" and story, the battles happen almost like a videogame cutting to the battle screen.  This complete takes the immersion out of the anime, and consistently reminds people who watched the original and loved it, what is wrong with this remake.",1358121600,7,1298,4.573275862068965
5183391,2,B008UE8ICK,"This movie is an hour and a half covering about 4 1/2 hours of anime, its just not enough time to tell this story in the right way. For me the best part of berserk is not the action, it is the story and characters. The anime took its time in setting up the characters, making you experience the story from there perspective. When someone in the story is betrayed or hurt emotionally you feel the same way, but in this movie I really don't think its enough time, you just don't give a $***.

Just my two cents though, you might love this adaptation, then again you might watch all the marvel movies in awe. Oh how the entertainment industry is in favor of the idiot.",1358121600,4,665,4.2362204724409445

Technically however, there are parts of this that are near unwatchable.
While the traditional animation is amazing, the use of 3D models is awful. Holy crap they are bad. There are whole sections that look and feel like a PS2 videogame cutscene.

They said it was so short, and the animation looks crummy. Bah! I passed on getting this for my friends for christmas. I was worried for nothing! I was pleased to learn that while the runtime is a bit short, the ending is not some abrupt let down. The pacing of the movie is great and we get pretty far into the series as far as events go.

The animation looks beautiful and its cool to see an old favorite like this so vibrant, colorful and modern day hi-res. Some of the reviewers pointed out some graphical glitches and yes they are present. Short, fleeting, and then it's back to slick visuals. Fans will remember the english dub was well done and this one is excellent, plus the entire cast is back in their roles! It's like how Kevin Conroy is Batman right? When it's not him it's weird!

5183400,4,B008UE8ICK,"If you are a fan of Japanese animation, also known as anime, then you most likely heard of a violent little series called Berserk. A well-known manga (Japanese comic book) and anime, Berserk was created by Kentaro Miura and instantly became a hit. When it was announced that Berserk would be getting the anime treatment once again, fans everywhere were more than thrilled, and yet a little bit worried. Does the first installment of Berserk: The Golden Age leave its mark, or is it simply treading familiar ground?

The animated feature, which clocks in with a run time around 100 minutes, hits its mark dead on. Based of the legendary manga series, this first volume introduces the world to Guts (English voice over: Marc Diraison), a young mercenary with a fighting spirit and a massive sword to back it up. In a world of swords, knights and kingdoms, one needs to be able to survive, which is what Guts has done by any means necessary. But when he butts heads with the Band of the Hawk, a fearless group of mercenaries led by the almost unbeatable Griffith (Kevin T. Collins), his whole life changes.

The animation is beautifully done by STUDIO4C and licensed in the US by Viz Media, as it has a very distinct, modern feel to it. Very different from the previous anime, which had a dark, gritty feel, this animated feature has some of the best modern day, 2-D animation I have seen to date. The voice cast for the English cast is top notch, as the man who voiced Berserk, Marc Diraison, returns to voice the lone swordsman, and does so effortlessly. The entire voice cast puts out an amazing performance; well worthy of the glorious animation it is paired with.

With a name like Guts in an anime called Berserk, you better believe there is plenty of blood and violence to go around, just like its original source material. Having been a fan of the original manga and anime, I am very pleased with this new interpretation of a classic franchise. Highly recommended!",1357171200,,1969,4.652298850574713
5183401,4,B008UE8ICK,"As mentioned before, this is a remake of the original series, cut down to fit into a movie, and split into 3 parts. This is part 1, and despite the rush of plot points, manages to pull you in just like the show, at the worst unfortunate time, like the rebuild Evangelion movies!  Those bastards.

Animation in this movie is split into several sections.  The CGI for Objects, mostly weaponry, gives this movie a unique flair.  Swords, Armor, Helmets, Catapults.  It gives the item's it's own Look.  A soldiers helmet and a solider are two distinct things, and it shows.  People and Helmets don't mix in animation, everybody knows this.  Just try showing emotion when face is hidden.  Helmets in real life are just buckets over the head, the person is inside still, the CGI gives that effect, and provides a unique experience.

Problems include your Hero's looking like godly HD Blue-ray level armor with matching high detailed animated money money money detail, with mook's standing around in barely animated suits of low quality dreg.  These low quality extra's should be less....low quality as each new movie comes out, as CGI assets are simpler to carry over, it's like making more of the same movie, instead of starting from scratch.",1357171200,,1236,4.838095238095238

5183406,4,B008UE8ICK,"It's good to know that the creator of the anime series paid attention to his fans and coordinated with a studio to finish off what he orignally started; even though it took ten years!

If you have watched the original anime, you will know what I am talking about.

The original is meticulous and what I like about the series is that it shows human nature in a very precise manner, the storyline is touching, and the art work is amazing (This is coming from someone who is not artistically inclined and does not watch cartoons).

With that said, this new anime is good, but not as good as I had desperately anticipated.  In some respects this video feels a little bit rushed.  This first part of the new trilogy has several of the old animes compressed into this new version.  (I don't remember off of the top of my head how many, I think its three).  Some of the grammar is not correct, which is not a big deal.  I wish that they created this like the old anime, I cannot stress how good the artwork is in it.

This implies that you miss out on some of the details that the original had.

It's still a good video, if you were like me and saw the original anime seven times and are very desperate to see what happens, I would hold off until at least until the second video comes out.

Some day, I will read all of the comics that the series is based off of.  I believe it has been in publication since 1990.

If you are wanting to watch this for the first time, I recommend watching the old version first.  If you don't like cliffhangers, then wait until the second video comes out or the trilogy is completed.

The series is definitely not for kids!",1356739200,,1649,4.257234726688103

I did find that the first half of the movie swooped over quit a bit of materiel, making the transitions between events in the story a bit sudden. But in the second half of the movie it slows down a bit and fallows a more steady flow of narrative.

The ending left me eager for the next installment. It is a treat to see the action and highlights of the story displayed in such beauty for the first time on screen. Any fan of the existing series will be reworded by watching this movie. For any new comers, this is a great place to start.

I have read the manga and own the original anime series on vhs. The animation and design is mostly beautiful, there are some moments of inconsistency of quality but it is never too jarring. They compacted the story pretty well focusing more on Guts, Griffith and Caska, which is fine, but not spending more time on the other supporting characters may lessen the impact of the ultimate conclusion of this story arc. Either way I'm excited to see the next 2 parts.

My only real gripe is that this disc has very minimalist extras like most anime blurays/dvds. This only has an art gallery and trailer.",1356566400,,715,4.542635658914729

The action scenes kind of sucked even worse than the cell animation from the first anime.

It condenses everything up to Griffiths imprisonment into one hour. And the rational thing to do would be say okay we can't really tell any kind of plot someone would understand, but at least we could get one really well done action scene.

every single somewhat decent action bit was actually in the preview. I literally liked the preview better than the movie itself.

I will start with this: the reviews saying this is more for people who have already watched the whole series or read the manga are correct. You are going to miss out on the in depth character development that brought these people to life and made you feel their emotions. Assuming you have bought this product as a previous fan and already have that bond, you will enjoy this remake it is just a more focused tale so that they could captivate more of an audience, the ones that can't appreciate having patience to grow with a character, and I don't fault them for that one bit because those types of the majority. This is still a great movie despite all the ""hardcore"" fan drama and easily dwarfs the majority of weaker animaes  out there, so enjoy and hopefully this takes us into the even better parts of the manga that never made it to development with the last series because if you read the manga you know it only gets better.",1356134400,,1030,4.392670157068062
5183412,5,B008UE8ICK,"This Blu-ray disc was my introduction to the Berserk anime. I saw it at Best Buy last week and I had a friend who was really into the series a few months back, so I figured I'd give it a try and buy it.

I watched the first 10 minutes or so when I first bought it to see what I was getting into, and what struck me first was the animation. I didn't like the animation at all in the beginning of the movie so I turned off the Blu-ray player and put it down until today when I finished it. I picked up right where I left off last week and I really enjoyed it past the first 10 minutes of weird animation, and boy was it weird/not very good animation. I'm not sure if I grew more accustom to the animation as I watched the movie but I didn't find it a problem once the movie really got started.

I really enjoyed the movie overall though. I won't say anything about it because I don't want to spoil it, this review is mostly about the actual product and the flaws I found with it, but I did greatly enjoy it and will be waiting for the second movie from this series to get released (hopefully) in 2013.

The case it comes in is one of the typical, cheap recyclable cases. There is no real extras either. It does come with a small paper for Neon Alley like all other Viz Media releases, and a paper for the Berserk manga series which can be read online.

Without giving anything about the actual movie away I would highly suggest this to new fans, I feel it was a good introduction to the world of Berserk. Especially considering all of the original series releases are out of print now I believe, this is the next best thing.

The dub is great, all voice actors fit great as far as I am concerned. The final thing I really enjoyed in this movie is how beautiful the bright colors are during the animation when there is an outdoors scene or battle, it really stuck out to me. Especially scenes with Griffith for some reason.",1356048000,,1920,4.150537634408602
5183413,4,B008UE8ICK,"Being a huge fan of berserk, I had to snatch up this retelling of the story. However the result may not be for everyone.

My first encounter with Berserk was the Sega Dreamcast game, Guts' rage. While not a good starting point, it did introduce me to the world of Berserk in all of its violent glory. Soon after, I watched the 25 episode anime series, and was left with my mouth agape and wanting to know what the hell happened to the characters I had grown to care about so much. As expected, I started to read the manga, the rest is history.

What had me so excited about this reboot was the fact that it promised to be more true to the source material, meaning the violence will be much closer to what the manga offered, and the inclusion of previously overlooked  characters like the skull knight, the fetus, maybe even a kushan or two (or an army of them)

After viewing The Golden Age Arc 1, I must say I was not disappointed, but was left with a bit of longing for more (as any fan probably would) Arc 1 hits most of the major points you would expect, the fight with Bazuso the grey knight, guts joining the band of the hawk,  the first meeting with Nosferatu Zodd, multiple battles, and Griffith taking his first steps in his bloody conquest to get his own kingdom. There are things that I wish were more intact (such as Guts' childhood surrounding Gambino and his ""Mother"" Shisu) but who is to say they may not go into greater detail later. This movie is great for fans who are already familiar with the manga and anime, but may not have as much to offer new fans who start their berserk journey here.

Fans will either love or hate the style used to animate Arc 1, It is CGI with cell shading, which looks nice in certain shots , but can also look downright weird in others ( The first time I really noticed is during the first battle when the general tells everyone to charge, he looks just...goofy) At times it has the movie looking like an older video game would look on a playstation 2. It can be jarring, but does not take much away from the intense battles.

Arc 1 also ends somewhat quickly, leaving you hanging as is always the intention with these types of ongoing series. Here's hoping they don't drag their feet when bringing them overseas.

Overall, I would say Arc 1 was a good start to this reboot, and am hoping the others will be progressively better as they grow accustomed to telling the story over a shorter period of time that the anime.",1355961600,,2467,4.3478260869565215

5183418,4,B008UE8ICK,"This story goes from the beginning of Berserk up until the assassination, so it looks like there will be at LEAST one more movie before the end of the Golden Age Arc.  I'd suggest it to anyone familiar with berserk as a great movie, and also to anyone new to the series with some slight reservations.

Pros:
 - Great story and great retelling.  Nothing really changed from the comics or original series, just some of the elements put into a slightly different order.
 - Amazing animation.  Except for a few mouth flaps I felt I was watching something much smoother than a normal anime.  It reminded me more of Disney than a cheap no budget children's cartoon.

Cons:
 - Only the theme song is composed by Susumu Hirasawa.  The rest of the soundtrack was composed by someone else and they unfortunately weren't as good.  No iconic Forces remake or anything,
 - Too short!  The pace seemed fast but it still felt like it cut out early.  Guts's flashback to his childhood spans only 2 minutes or so and is hard to follow if you're not already familiar with the story.

5183421,3,B008UE8ICK,"I'm a long time Berserk fan, I've been following it and enjoying it for over a decade now.  I keep up with the manga, have watched the original anime many times, and have played the games.  So I feel this gives me a good perspective on how to view adaptations and interpretations of Kentaro Miura's ""Berserk"", and generally these adaptations turn out rather well and in some ways superior to the source. Unfortunately this latest movie interpretation just feels like a let down, I really came into this with my hopes high, and with good reason. If you've never seen or read Berserk before, I would not recommend you start here, the pacing of the story within the movie is just bad and the movie ends on a cliffhanger. I don't mean a cliffhanger like the ending of The Fellowship of the Ring, I mean a true cliffhanger like Walking Dead where there's been some big revelation and then the end credits roll. This would be easily forgivable in a weekly television show or if the second movie were already out, but more likely we'll have to wait a year or so for the 2nd portion of The Golden Age Arc. To me this seems like the biggest thing that keeps this movie from being an effective stand-alone story. (Of course the story continues and a sequel is on the way, but I'm judging this on it's individual merits.)
Additionally the movie (and this is really more just the nature of the beast with turning books into movies) doesn't give itself enough time for characterization or to allow for steady character development the way the manga and anime do.  Important scenes are rushed through, given a proxy event that doesn't carry the appropriate emotional weight, or are cut altogether.
Oddly enough another one of my complaints is the animation, Studio 4 degrees makes some amazing animation and they've been at it for a while, and all of the tradition cell animation in the film looks AMAZING. But, frequently and in large amounts they make use of CG animation that's made to look traditional but it doesn't quite blend in and takes me out of the experience.

It's certainly not a ""bad"" movie, and perhaps to someone who's never seen Berserk before this might be a stellar flick, but I have to view this as someone who knows the story front to back and omitted scenes are glaring for me, and the so-so animation just makes me want to watch the original anime. In spite of all of that I still support buying the movie, especially to Berserk fans to help ensure that the rest of the movies are both made and released outside of Japan. From what I understand Studio 4 degrees realized the issues with pacing and the CG from the first movie and took steps to correct those issues for the second. I'd very much like to see where they go from here, and I feel that Berserk needs more fans outside of Japan.

If you've never been exposed to Berserk before, consider the manga or anime.

If you have seen Berserk before, at least show this movie some support so we can get the (purportedly superior) sequels localized.",1354579200,7,3009,4.55268022181146
5183422,1,B008UE8ICK,"First of all, let me say I am a HUGE Berserk anime fan!
Loved the series, which was probably one of the best I've ever seen!

But this movie is nothing but a low ripoff of the series!
I thought this movie was going to be an extension of the series, or perhaps a side story, but instead it's just a repetition of the series in better quality.

The only good from the series is that the scenes are more detailed, more background activity thanks to CGI, some nice bloody effects, but that's it.

The negative is a whole list:
Half the things shown are not explained, it feels like you're watching the series in a rushed pace. The character depth is too low, there is orchestral music, but not the original spellbinding music from the series, most of the story is without background music. I found it quite a huge dissapointment. It's short, and the ending I went like ""What the???""?
I mean, I saw the ending, and thought, this can't be the ending! There must be a pause here, and it's going to get better! (as the movie really started to get sloppy near the end).
The most popular fight with Guts against the 100 bandids is missing, what happens to Griffith in the castle with the king's daughter, how Griffith gets tortured and the band of the hawks almost cease to exist, how Guts rescues them, how Griffith becomes a demon eaten by his own ambition, and what about end of the series? All these scenes are left out, and some frames are shown, to give you clues. You'd only understand if you've seen the series. Just like watching photo's, and you need to make the link in your mind, but unless you've seen the series, those photo's are only probabilities, and you can't know for certain what exactly happened after Guts left the band, from watching the movie alone!
It's really someone who put everything in a pot, and had enough of moviemaking, and decided to publish a half finished product!

Probably the worst Berserk ever!

Kind of feels like a filler, and a real bad one, only it's repeating the series instead of being new!

If you watched the series, you know that the movie is about between 25% and 50% of the series end, which makes me believe there's going to be a second part of it!

A HUGE disappointment, DON'T BUY!

SPOILER ALERT:
[spoiler]The story starts where Guts defeats the big masked guy with the axe in the beginning, you get another fight with him and the huge goat demon in the castle, and ends where Griffith talks to the kings daughter on the fountain, (the scene just before he gets intimate with her in the series), about how a friend to him should be someone equal, someone with his own dreams; and how Guts heard this, and decided to be Griffith's equal by departing from Griffith, and following his own goal.
So basically it ends by Guts leaving the band. Very bad ending![/spoiler]",1354579200,6,2813,4.4911937377690805
5183423,4,B008UE8ICK,"As someone who watched a lot of anime back in the mid-to-late 90's and into the early 2000's (and sold off most of it) the Berserk series was one of my favorites. I found out about these new movies being released by total happenstance, and I thought it was worth taking a look at for the price. I'm really glad I did! I've seen a lot of reviews that complain about the quality of the animation and how distractingly bad it can be at times. Compared to many of the anime movies and TV shows shows I used to love from the 70's, 80's and 90's this looks like an absolute masterpiece! My theory is that a lot of anime fans these days are totally spoiled on ultra high quality modern animation, and I can safely say that if you liked or at least tolerated the production quality of the original series you will love this.

Story wise these movies cut out a lot of filler and get moving through the major plot points quickly. Some important things are left out or confusingly added like Guts' back story (I still call him Gatts from the fansub days). It seems like these movies are more for people who have already seen the original series or read the manga than for people seeing it all for the first time. Fortunatley I had so I could explain things a little when I showed this to someone who had never seen Berserk or any anime show before.

Of course certain parts were removed and a lot was condensed, but I thought all of that was done very well. The movie flowed nicely and had a lot of impact in all the right places. The animation(aside from the occasional bad cg shot) was stunning, and the english voice cast sounded better than ever. Of course it wouldn't have hurt if the movie was 15 minutes longer, but I honestly didn't feel like I was missing much. I watched this with my friend who I watched the original anime with 10 years ago, and he loved it as much as I did.

So this is quite a nice little suprise!  While the film is not without faults, the animation is quite beautiful in my opinion, definitly much more modern as compared to the original anime.  Viz deciding to bring back the original english cast was awsume.  For this first installment, the cast in my opinion could not have done a better job with the English Dub - this is a blast from the past.  The pace is far quicker & the Battle scenes look better than the 1990's Anime.  While no adaptation will be perfect, unless its page for page of Miura's Manga, this adaptation promises to continue the story arc to its end and more Berserk Arcs are quite possible in the future, depending on the success of this project.  There are two more films to follow, arc II and arc III.  And I just saw a trailer for the final arc and it looks to be amazing.  The fact that puck, zodd, skull knight, and other charectors missing from the 1990's animation may be in the arc III film has got me excited to say the least.

5183426,5,B008UE8ICK,"Let me just say that I read the manga and watched the anime series, so after seeing this movie on blu ray, I say here, have 5 stars.  It's basically a quick recap of the anime series up to a certain point.

However, if you have not read the manga and seen the anime, don't watch this movie---you'll be left in the dark when it shows a few scenes that fast forward through Gut's life.....Among other things, lets just say it helps if you know the back story and other events going on.  Imagine if Game of Thrones (any of the 1K page books) were condensed into a 150 page novel----get the idea?

But as a huge fan of the series, it felt great seeing the Berserk characters back in action!  My favorite (yet small) scene in the movie is equal to a scene in the manga-----In the manga, there is a scene where Griffith is in the castle, and catches that little bald guy who is some sort of spy or whatnot looking at him.  Griffith then gives him this ""hawk-like stare-down"" of ""your doom is certain"" and I thought that was so flipping awesome---it has to do with how well the characters were drawn and how well there eyes convey emotion!  Griffith's stare down was so scary its like I was nervous!  Well they do a scene like that in the movie with his eyes when he just saves princess Charlette and he gets shot by an arrow.  He then gets up and just does that ""stare of your impending doom"" right through a trail in the woods at who he knows was behind the arrow being shot at him.  The animators who drew his eyes and that scene I felt was just an epic scene from the book.  I guess you had to read it, but dang that sent chills down my spine seeing it again!  I'm just thankful to see this movie because Berserk is my favorite series and I hope things work out and they can animate the rest of the manga!",1354320000,,1802,4.161383285302594
5183427,1,B008UE8ICK,I preordered this movie months ago and had been literally counting down the days until it would arrive at my door step only to become very disappointed. I'm a huge fan of berserk and have been since I discovered it years ago in fact I would even say its my favorite anime of all time. The animation was good until the cgi would kick in mainly around battle scenes where I kept getting reminded of the lego video game graphics and people. The movie was hard to follow even for someone who had seen the original anime series many times and if you had never heard or watched berserks anime then forget about understanding this movie. Instead ofcomming out with these disappointing movies why couldn't they have just picked up the anime where it left off and keep it the original animation? This movie was an embarrassment to the berserk franchise and an insult to its fans don't buy it. Instead just rewatch the anime or read the wonderful manta and remember the good times.,1354320000,11,971,4.554285714285714
5183428,2,B008UE8ICK,"Most readers who are looking at these reviews are already huge Berserk fans, and a majority of them here are fanboys who are giving this movie praise based on their love for the franchise only. So, while I'm a big Berserk fan - both manga and original television formats - and was anxiously waiting to see this film for myself, I gotta be honest and say that I was really disappointed with it. The animation is pretty ugly (being all computer rendered models with simple skins over them), the additional nuances added to the characters and their actions for the sake of the movie take away from the original concepts and ideas of the source material, and there's nothing new to this movie that wasn't animated before (there's actually far less).

It sits at about 1hr 12min, and has some of the worst pacing issues I've ever seen. Sure, it was bound to happen if you were planning on making a three movie epic for the first 13 manga chapters. But the key word here is ""epic,"" where this movie should have ran for at least 2 hours minimum to do the story any kind of justice. I think what's most disappointing is that the notion of a Hellsing Ultimate-type format is totally lost here, where the manga would have been fully adapted and didn't still gloss over the elements that the television series had already cut out. So, you get a severely condensed story that still skips over the first three manga volumes, you don't see any of the new characters that were heavily advertised as being included (no Skullknight or Puck), it cuts out other characters that were key to original story (Minister Foss is gone, and he was the one who planned everything that had to do with killing Griffith in the court), and it changes whole story elements to try and make the movie more dramatic (mild spoiler - The end has Casca putting two and two together that Gutts killed the King's brother and nephew, when originally she had no idea what was going on and only was only there to stop Gutts from interrupting Griffith's advances on the princess at the party).

This new film series advertised itself with new characters and a grander vision of war on the battlefield, but comes up short in every way. The animation is ugly, and none of the new characters previewed show up here. Don't let the fanaticism of other Berserk fans/reviewers on this site fool you - this movie offers nothing new, and considerably less than what we've gotten before.

Buy it for cheap AFTER you've seen the other two movies AND ONLY IF you've decided whether or not they're worth your time or not.",1354233600,9,2563,4.579520697167756
5183429,5,B008UE8ICK,"Delivered promptly. Just watched it today. As an avid fan of the series and having read the entire manga up to its most recent release I will say this: If you're completely clueless to Berserk, then this is the perfect sample taste to get you interested. For the fans, you know the deal, so you won't be disappointed that they either left out or severely sped through some major plot points. It still tells the same tale although at a different pace. And the animation and mood is absolutely awesome, in fact I'll go so far as to say that this version has incredible intensity and much more of a cinematic flair. Can't wait for the next one. Hey Amazon, where is the Golden Arc part 2? It was in theaters in Japan in June.",1354233600,4,722,4.355555555555555
5183430,5,B008UE8ICK,when watchhing something like this one must understand that you can not judge this movie by itself because it is one part of a story meant to be told in three movies. I can't say much other then after watching the first part of the story i can say that i hope and pray that they release the other parts of the story soon. Give it a chance i for one can not wait for the second and thrid parts of the story. only time will tell if they release them or not.,1354147200,,455,3.903225806451613
5183431,3,B008UE8ICK,"Here's a review of the actual blu ray. This movie is basically the first 10 episodes of the anime series compressed to roughly 70 minutes or 75 minutes with the ending credits. If you've seen the anime then you'll know what to expect. There's definately changes to the story, but it's doesn't change my enjoyment of it. Anyway, the characters look all brand new and younger while the anime they look more rugged and rough. Also, some of the music doesn't match the scenes like the anime does. It's a blood bath of show so the music should match this. Movie is very good but I'm not reviewing a movie, I'm reviewing a blu ray purchase. If you know anything about Viz media, they're cheapos. I love Ranma and Maison Ikkoku and thank God Viz brought them over as Maison Ikkoku is one of my absolute favorite and I never get bored of Ranma. However, with that said, they are still very cheap as far as extras goes and this is no exception. Movie is 3 stars as the hand drawn artworks are freaking gorgeous story is very good. Then you get the CGI portion and they're just horrendous, cheap looking and jar droppingly out of place when it shifts from one scene to the next and most of them are in the fight scenes. This is one star off. The next one is the music. Like I stated before, some of the music simply doesn't fit the scenes to me. Maybe they'll fit to you, but to me, they simply seem out of place. This is 1/2 a star off. The third is the blu ray itself. If you're expecting tons of extras, forget about it. There's absolutely none other than a Neon Alley trailer and some sketch drawings. This is 1/2 star off so I'm giving 3 stars. Still looking forward to the 2nd and 3rd portion and here's hoping the CGIs are done better. If you like the anime, you'll like this movie as well. If you didn't, you probably won't like this. I loved the anime and I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, other than the CGI portions. Oh, I didn't even bother with the English dub as Viz is pretty bad at this portion too and the original dub casts were extremely bad.",1353715200,5,2050,4.272493573264781
5183432,4,B008UE8ICK,"The seller was good and I have watched the original anime, there is some missing character developement, but the action and fight scenes are well done with the additional high budget animation styles. I believe this basically tells about one third of the anime series in the given timespan. I know it is probably a much smaller portion of the Manga, as it is much longer than the anime was and it really only follows the band of the hawk, Based on the story in the first part I am guessing the series will only cover the same ground that the anime covered following the band of the hawk to their rise and fall from glory. It may not be as satisfying for folks who follow the manga series but I think if you were just a follower of the anime series it will be a nice more polished re-take on the anime.",1353110400,2,801,4.241830065359477

8530531,5,B008UE8ICK,What a series.  I first watched Berserk in the early 2000's and was blown away by it then.  It's gotten better with age.  The entire saga has been put into a three part movie series and the animation is incredible.  They cover all the important parts.  Very well done.,1469491200,,268,4.387755102040816
8530532,5,B008UE8ICK,"I really enjoyed the anime all those years ago when it came out and I have been following the manga every religiously. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard they were making a condensed version of the anime into 3 movies so I knew as a Berserk fan I had to have this.

The animation I found was incredible and the tones are even more darker than before. This is the Golden Age of Berserk and in my opinion the best that it has had to offer so far. You will feel the camaraderie and grow to love the Band of the Hawk and it's leather the White Hawk Griffith. But what starts out as something so great quickly turns to something so heinous.",1467590400,,640,4.161290322580645
