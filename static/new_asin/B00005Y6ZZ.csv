7956470,5,B00005Y6ZZ,"One of the most bizarre, funny, original movies I have ever seen, despite the budget. For those who criticize audio/visual quality, they must not have seen any 90's low budgets. My husband and I do, Feast is actually better than most of that genre.

But what inspired me to post a review was the singularity of the movie. The plot is intriguing, mixing both humor and drama. Sometimes it doesn't work, but for the most part, it does. You have to appreciate the film maker's attempt to try something different, and given the dreck that most low budgets present, that has to be given extra points. As one reviewer pointed out, if you are easily offended, then this ain't for you. If not, and you can appreciate some very black humor and gore, this is perfect....",1454457600,,760,4.588235294117647
7956471,4,B00005Y6ZZ,"If you're tired of the same old gore/slasher/zombie/cannibal movies (who needs another Friday the 13?), then feast your eyes on this nasty little piece of work here.  Its best feature is the way it intermingles the world that we consider ""normal"" with that of horror movies.  Unlike mainstream cinema, this one even employs two veterans of hard-core pornography--Ron Jeremy and Sharon Mitchell.  The plot twist at the end is like nothing you've ever seen.",1169164800,3,455,5.121621621621622
7956472,1,B00005Y6ZZ,"Let just start buy saying this movie offered nothing. It had no original thought or plot. I will describe this flimsy  story line for you. First You  have a enetertainment lawyer and a B movie producer who have a taste for eating women. They lure them in by promising them roles in film. Sounds so original doesn't it. The lawyer is seeing a shrink because he thinks their dreams and not really happening. The doctor he is seeing becomes obsessed with his cannibal ways and desires to experience what it would be like to be eaten alive because she has a high tolerance for pain.

Like I say it sounds beeter than it really is. The acting is poor. The effects are ok but do not help this film along. The best part of the film was the previews of other films that this company puts out. Now I know what not to buy. Like The Ice Cream Man, Vampire Vixens, Dahmer, just to name a few. I wish I had listen to the negative reviems of this film because they where right. I bought this thing so I'm stuck with it. Do not become a victim like Me!",1158883200,2,1037,4.201005025125628
7956473,1,B00005Y6ZZ,"Just a warning, this isn't the ""Feast"" from ""Project Greenlight"" even though I found it listed under ""Project Greenlight"".",1155772800,8,122,5.473684210526316
7956474,1,B00005Y6ZZ,"First of all, the DVD of ""Feast"" is very poor. The picture and sound quality are below that of a VHS tape. The picture is seriously grainy and has many VHS style dropouts and the soundtrack in tinny. The whole production was a low budget one anyway and you can hear the director giving directions to the actors on at least two occasions. The acting is also very poor and the main lead is best known for her roles in porn films. The entire movie seems like an attempt by pornographers to do something other than film people having sex. I guess this film is best compared to H.G. Lewis's ""Blood Feast"" in overall production and acting value, although, ""Blood Feast"" is kind of fun to watch. The gore content is seriously lacking and most of the film is filled with bad acting and lame comedy attempts. It is not even in the so bad its good category. Don't waste your time on this.",1128902400,3,878,4.359756097560975
7956475,4,B00005Y6ZZ,"A truly bizarre and twisted movie about two cannibals who crave the flesh of young women. One is a sleazy movie producer and the other is a lawyer. The lawyer goes to a psychiatrist to discuss these cannibalistic tendencies as being dreams that he is having. The psychiatrist becomes fascinated with this. The problem is her boyfriend is an anthropologist who is helping the police with investigations of cannibalistic murders. The relationship starts to get tense as he tries to persuade her to reveal confidential information about this lawyer client. The movie producer is constantly trying to get the lawyer to help him catch girls to be eaten at their mutual feasts. The lawyer's recollections of these events are fuzzy when he is not engaged in this activity. All the while the psychiatrist becomes obsessed with finding out more about her client's cannibalistic tendencies and has ideas of him and his friend helping her fulfill a fantasy much more perverted and bizarre than anything these two guys are doing.
If you have a strong stomach you may appreciate some of the black humor presented here. This movie was obviously shot on a very limited budget but it seems to help the seediness of this movie. Don't expect much in the way of picture and audio quality, but it is adequate enough. Not all trailers can be viewed for other titles which was a slight disappointment. The acting is adequate with a pretty good performance from porn queen Sharon Mitchell who plays the psychiatrist. Nothing oscar worthy to be found here though as expected. This movie's strong points are it's gore level and it's unique subject matter. This is definitely one of the grossest movies I have ever seen and that's saying something. If you like movies that are way out on the fringe and you are not easily offended there is plenty to entertain you here. Watch this along with Ravenous for a cannibal double feature but save Ravenous for second because it is definitely a better quality movie. This gets extra points for weirdness and depravity.",1034899200,7,2034,4.8645533141210375
