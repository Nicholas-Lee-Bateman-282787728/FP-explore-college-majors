8269763,5,B0018GZYZG,Think it is a great set.  All of the segments are very informative.  I have a special link to the one about Iwo Jima as my bother-in-law fought there and watched the flag go up.  He was interviewed for this documentary.,1510704000,,219,4.2926829268292686

8269769,5,B0018GZYZG,"I bought this DVD collection for my husband for his birthday. He loves it...and so do I lol:) My favorite video is about ice trucking, his was the logger video. I would highly recommend this collection, it has alittle but of everything and enough to keep you watching! Great for husbands, but wives love it too:)",1369958400,,312,4.589285714285714
8269770,4,B0018GZYZG,"I read the other review and agree that it is odd that this set is mostly WWII and some other odd dangerous jobs. I dissagree that it promises to be all about WWII. I think they went by the photo only - and did Not read the episode index.
I'm not a WWII buff - but found most of it to be very interesting.
I also liked the epsiodes about Daredevils and the history of Ice Trucking.
I found the one about Timber (dangerous logging) to be sad (as I love trees).
Rescue swimmers is informative - but not my topic.
Hostage Negotiators - I like - but was a bit general.
Overall - a very good set.  I find WWII amazing the sacrafic (a lot of that in here) and the tenacity to win.
For me - I'd rather a set about very odd - different jobs - this is mostly WWII, but still mostly well done. Scott MacNeil.",1314057600,,797,3.98125
8269771,3,B0018GZYZG,"I thought this would of had more ww2 or at least all war but when you have an episode on stunt men which i don't think that would go under the title of dangerous missions. The ww2 episodes that are on this are good value and footage that i haven't seen before, so if you love knowing what brave men did to keep freedom for us to take for granted i would say this is worth the dollars that they are asking. They even have an episode on u-boats so they also look at it from both sides as they were only doing the same as us and fighting for their lives and mates.great value for money",1313798400,2,582,3.982905982905983
