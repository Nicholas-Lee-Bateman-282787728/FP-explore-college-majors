8641235,5,B00IDDHVP8,"I'm 56 and that will be important in the context of this review.  When I was in the fourth grade I became aware of a band curiously named ""The Guess Who"" as ""The Mighty 690, W.V.O.K."" in Birmingham Alabama was playing in heavy rotation a cool sound entitled ""These Eyes"".  I didn't know it but I was being touched by a person named Randy Bachman.  Randy wasn't even singing and even if he was I didn't know anything about this band, but a seed was planted.  This music just grabbed me even in my immatureness of youth.  A great song can do that.  More followed and finally I bought a RCA album of The Best of The Guess Who when I was in the sixth grade.  This band, in the short period between my fourth and sixth grade years, had amased a quality catalog of hits.  It didn't matter if it was a ballad or heavier because the lyrics and the music meshed well.  They were quite accessible, but they had a gritty very real, even heavy, side too.  I've always thought The Guess Who was a very talented band and as time progressed I realized the heart of so much of it was Randy Bachman.

Well, I must have sensed something at a young age because with this video, and age, I feel validated in my youthful interest.  Randy Bachman is a great song writer and musician.  He has a fantastic catalog spanning many years and two bands who became world-wide successes.  That's not what this video concert of Randy Bachman is about actually though.  It's like being in a cool basement with a guy who lived the life of a musician and had the talent to take serrendipitous things around him and create some very memorable music as a result.  It's interesting and enlightening.  You know the guy didn't amass the wealth of, say, a Paul McCartney, but like McCartney what he created is still enjoyed and remembered fondly around the globe.  Bachman is totally not affected by his great success and comes off as a guy still just having the time of his life sharing music with his fellow human beings.  That's the core of Bachman telling some great stories about growing up in Canada and unleashing his muse on a appreciative world.  It's not a concert, though there are nice, tastefully truncated performances, of some his best stuff.  It's just like mutual friends enjoying music and getting some real insider's stories allowing one to know more as to how it all came to pass.  I'd say Randy has done in video form exactly what fans of his radio show have found so engaging.  This is a treasure for fans and simply interesting for most anyone.

I really respect Randy Bachman.  I sense he is a very grounded fine human being.  I share his enthusiasm and thank him for sharing.  See this if you're in any way likewise inclined, it's really a fun show.  This is the kind of musician I wish I could hang with because I sense he could share so much more than just the limited time of this video covers.  Great fun, great music, and a, truly, great talent.",1456531200,,2934,4.4216417910447765
8641236,5,B00IDDHVP8,Great Entertainment DVD. Thanks for the excellent service. Thanks,1456099200,,65,6.333333333333333
8641237,5,B00IDDHVP8,"I always love to know the stories behind the music. Randy Bachmann is a talented musician and a very entertaining storyteller. Listen to the music of the Guess Who and BTO, and hear Randy's anecdotes about the inspiration for the writing of the song or interesting events around recording the album. A DVD I will watch many times, I'm sure.",1437350400,,340,4.683333333333334
8641238,5,B00IDDHVP8,This is a must have for the fans! Performances are great and the stories are spectacular!,1428883200,,89,4.625
8641239,5,B00IDDHVP8,"I heard Bachman on a satellite radio station in the middle of a road trip, giving extended versions of the stories he tells here. Naturally, I had to go out and get the DVD. He and his band cover the songs well enough as they prop up the stories he weaves about their inspiration. Whether the stories of how the songs came to be are exaggerated, or whether Bachman really has the luck and skill to turn moments of random inspiration into what have become classic rock really isn't important. All autobiographies are fictional to some extent. What is important is that the stories are funny and heartfelt and you wish it was a concert with an encore.",1422316800,3,649,4.508474576271187
8641240,5,B00IDDHVP8,sat down and watched it twice.  How these songs came about is a real story.  Great Christmas gift to fans of rock.  So glad he shared these stories,1416787200,2,147,4.178571428571429
8641241,4,B00IDDHVP8,"Very fun program and unlike many semi documentaries I will watch this many times. This is an updated version of a program Randy recorded over a decade ago.  He talks about his history, how many of his most iconic songs were inspired and composed and then the band and him play them.  This is a more hi tech program with split screens, old photos and widescreen HD.  The one thing this program and the prior one with the almost exact name have in common... is the obvious absence of Burton Cummings and Fred Turner.  Both of those ""partners"" of his have such iconic voices that any  song they sang sounds ""off"" without them performing it. I didn't really deduct a star for that because that isn't really the point of this program.  My deduction of what would have been a 5 star review is the nearly 30 dollar list price.  For that price , there should be a wealth of bonus features... say Randy sitting with a bunch of his favorite guitars like Jeff Beck does on one of his BR discs... or more bonus footage from the day from his archives.  If you buy from alternate sellers for closer to 15 bucks and are a fan this is a dead bang 5 star item.... Mr Bachman is charming, enthusiastic and a great musician with terrific stories and songs.",1404172800,8,1237,4.37117903930131
