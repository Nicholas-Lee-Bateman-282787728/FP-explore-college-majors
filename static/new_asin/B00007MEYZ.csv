7978599,3,B00007MEYZ,He showboats. He does it wrong. He acts like he is in a tournament. I use the DVD as a guide but do not copy him. If you want to see how it should be done go to the source. Chibana sensei is the original grand master. His DVD is great. He is dying of cancer and is in pain but he does kata for posterity.,1372032000,,304,3.621212121212121
7978600,4,B00007MEYZ,"The good.  Expertly performed Katas.

The bad.  Video quality is low.  I very much doubt it was remastered from the original footage which is a shame because the content is excellent.  No menu to speak of just one big long chapter.  At a minimum they should have put in chapter marks at the start of each kata.

Bottom line is I think its worth buying but a little more effort they could have made it a great training aid.",1255910400,,422,4.265822784810126
