8296744,4,B001E6PH16,"This film is extremely dated in that it obviously conveys its message from the perspective of another era.  It was filmed during the Vietnam war, and though it portrays the debate over the Philippine rebellion after the Spanish-American War and tries to identify key figures of the times, the film is nonetheless refracted through the eyes of people of 1970. It's as interesting for its ""historiography"" as its pure history.

This little film is well worth use by any class room teacher seeking to show either of these periods (Spanish-America War or Vietnam Era) or as a backdrop to modern American imbroglios in Iraq and elsewhere.",1332720000,,633,4.962264150943396
8296745,5,B001E6PH16,"Any teacher, junior high level through college, could make good use of this video in exploring the difficulties brought on by American imperialism.  The parallels between the time period of U.S. involvement in the Philippines and the Iraq War are uncanny.",1313971200,,255,5.219512195121951
