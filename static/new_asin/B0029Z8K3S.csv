8358739,5,B0029Z8K3S,"I love this workout. I am a on again off again work out person trying to stay on. I need full cardio and weight training to build muscle. I found the work out challenging and the instructor VERY engaging. I thought she was positive and had lots of energy, her encouragement and cueing was right on point. The first day I only made it 15 minutes, the second time I made it 30 minutes now I am moving up to the entire workout. The cardio training will get you sweating and adding leg and knee lifts into the mix really intensifies the strength sections. For those persons that require constant plyometric and the use of 10 pound weights and higher this video IS NOT for you. For those of you that need exercise to revive and rejuvenate you to moving into a consistent working pattern this workout is perfect, you will definitely see results in your stamina, sleeping habits and overall physical condition. I have only lost a few pounds doing this workout every other day but, hey a few pounds is a start. The eating plan is also a good start to better habits (no weird foods to buy and carbs are included).",1361404800,,1104,4.416666666666667

It also cost more for this new package then if you buy the same workout with the dark haired girl on it.  Don't be fooled.",1248998400,10,278,4.12962962962963
