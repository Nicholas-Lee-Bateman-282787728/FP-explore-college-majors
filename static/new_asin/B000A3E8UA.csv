2356534,5,B000A3E8UA,"Cute, short, informative, interesting.  Kept my kids' interest (ages 6 and 9), and made them curious to learn more about Columbus.  Kids are exposed to so much nonsense these days.  It is nice to see a series of videos that focus on historic figures and heroes.  If you are tired of all of the politically correct stuff your kids learn in school about Columbus, then this is a great antidote.",1320710400,9,392,4.557142857142857
2356535,3,B000A3E8UA,"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS"" (1949) (99 min/Color) -- Starring: Fredric March, Florence Eldridge, Francis L. Sullivan, Linden Travers, Kathleen Ryan, Derek Bond, James Robertson Justice, Felix Aylmer, Nora Swinburne, Edward Rigby, Francis Lister, Niall Mac Ginnis, Abraham Sofaer, Richard Aherne, Dennis Vance

Directed by: David MacDonald

The British Invasion has struck again - VCI has restored and released another film.

The plot and story line is bent on discovering the New World, with Fredric March as Christopher Columbus gives an outstanding performance.  March asking for funds for his fleet, with his real life wife Florence Eldridge, cast as Queen Isabella.  The retelling of the great adventure with the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria as co-stars.

There are slow parts within, but for the most part a good telling of his adventure of 1492, landing and christening the new land as San Salvador.

Fredric March's closing line before the end credits start rolling - ""People will remember me long after Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand are long forgotten""

Good musical score by Arthur Bliss, performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Muiir Mathieson.  The soundtrack by Bliss lends classical passages of pure enjoyment

2356536,1,B000A3E8UA,"The film has so many mistakes regarding Columbus' history.  Just a few: He never spoke of a ""New World"" - he was sailing to Asia, actually Japan.  He never till his death believed he had reached a new continent or continents.  The reason he had trouble getting funding from the Court of Ferdinand and Isabella is because his math and geography were so bad - he under-estimated the size of the earth by at least 30%.  He selected facts about geography that were known in the late 15th century.  That is not brought out in the film.  It is glossed over that after leaving Pella, Spain, his ships went to the Canaries for fresh water, food, etc.  The crossing did not take 71 days - just 35 days.  The biggest lie perpetuated in the film is that the view then was that the world was flat.  It had been known by the Greeks since the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. that the earth is a sphere.  Only the ignorant in the 15th century argued the earth was flat.  I was told the big lie about a flat earth when I was in school in the late 50's, and this film was made in 1949.  There are many other errors.  The film is unhistorical and scientifically invalid even by 15th century standards.  Regardless of possible great acting performances, don't waste your time watching it unless you recognize it as FICTION.",1302307200,5,1299,4.380753138075314
2356537,5,B000A3E8UA,I am grateful that there are these old time movies! They have higher morals and less gore. This story of Columbus showed a good perspective about him which we don't get now. The acting was good and the plot was enjoyable.,1301270400,,221,4.414634146341464
2356538,5,B000A3E8UA,"We are studying early American History right now and are using these dvds as we study each event.  They add so much and help our boys to absorb more of each story.  They have a better understanding of what the buildings, clothes, transportation, customs, etc., were like in each particular time period.
I enjoyed learning along with my children more about who Christopher Columubus was with this movie.",1266105600,4,402,4.897058823529412
2356539,2,B000A3E8UA,An excellent story and take on Columbuse's life but I was barely able to watch the movie and found lots of problem with sound and images in another word this product is very oudated for today's technology. I hope they digitally re-mastering it.  it  worth all the effort.,1196294400,,271,4.625
2356540,2,B000A3E8UA,"""Christopher Columbus"" is a movie made in England and resembles a good old-fashioned American film epic from days gone by.

The movie is wonderful but avoid this DVD unless you just want to have any copy in hand.  I saw this film playing on TCM not long ago and it looked wonderful and decided to purchase Vision Video's DVD thinking it had to be the same transfer.  WRONG!

This looks to be a 2nd or even 3rd generation video tape to DVD transfer with washed out colors and blurry grainy picture that is moving all over the place (gate not stable).  Also there are artifacts abound.  I was hoping that this was simply an error or defect but judging by the prices of their other DVDs and this title being basically a budget price point, I am sure they knew what was being put out and surprised as this is also a Christian based company.  Maybe they will correct the problem and re-release it as it should be?

In the mean time, is there an official release somewhere that will play in Region 1?",1176422400,14,994,4.364130434782608
2356541,5,B000A3E8UA,"Great historical drama from 1949 of the great discoverer and his ups and downs- trying to convince the rulers of Spain that the world is indeed round. Features great costumes/sets, and performances by a wonderful supporting cast, with Frederic March in title role. I rate it even with another favorite 1949 epic, The Prince Of Foxes(Tyrone Power)- although this one was filmed in color. 5 stars!",1145836800,6,395,5.0

8074016,3,B000A3E8UA,A couple of other films were done in time for the 500 anniversary of the first voyage.  Watch this one first and you'll understand how much better (historically accurate) they are when you see them.,1407196800,,198,4.6571428571428575
8074017,2,B000A3E8UA,The DVD did not play well.  The sound quality was not good and it would not play on more recent (current and up to date) DVD players.
