5110724,5,B007UW9W8W,"wow! this was really really good.
Bobcat Goldthwait has created a masterpiece.
this movie beautifully sums up the fact that we have become a nation of repeaters, rather than thinkers.
Joel Murray is just excellent, and i was pleasantly surprised to see the great Frank Conniff as a Glenn Beck type TV host named Stan Kurtz.
i highly recommend this for anyone with a healthy sense of humor and a constant and growing outrage at what the media has been spoon feeding us for the last 30 years or so.
if you're not sure if your sense of humor is healthy, this movie would be a good test for you to find out.
go ahead and watch it.  if you find yourself feeling offended, then you are probably challenged, not only in the humor department, but in understanding why our civilization is on the fast-track to extinction.
so go on, try it... or you can just keep on being entertained by alarming stupidity and the misfortune of others.  i'll just stay here and remain disappointed in most of you for your willingness to be gluttons of mediocrity.
as you were.",1333843200,4,1050,4.521052631578947
5110725,1,B007UW9W8W,"The premise for this film is good, but Goldthwait lets his biases get in the way. Like Andrew Breitbart or Paddy Chayefsky, Goldthwait correctly identifies the mainstream media as a modern villan. Unfortunately, by leaving out the most egregious offenders on the left and making up unrealistic characters on the right, he leaves a huge part of his potential audience wanting and box office money on the table.

For example, he associates ""Teabaggers"" (his term in the credits) as vitriolic haters, turning himself (Goldthwait) into the same lying manipulator that he portrays in the film. He creates an ignoble news commentator whose behavior could best be identified as coming from a network like MSNBC, but whose rhetoric is meant to indicate that he is a right wing zealot, which paints such a dishonest picture as to, once again, destroy the potential hubris.

Goldthwait clearly is trying to wrap up elements of Taxi Driver, Bonnie & Clyde, Lolita, The Professional, and Network in this film, but impales himself on his own opinion. There are plenty real world opportunities to choose examples of potential targets in this story without making up cartoon character boogie-men on the right. It makes the shots seem cheap, and in the end, ridiculous.

Joel Murray and Tara Lynne Barr turn in great performances, but the camera work and lighting leaves this film feeling like a made-for-tv movie. Tighter shots and grittier lighting would have been more of a homage to Taxi Driver or Network. The character development is thin, but better camera work would have gone a long way to building relationships between characters, especially the leads.

In conclusion, the material is timely and relevant, which made me want to see it, but the execution hypocritical to the point of laughter, which I don't believe was Goldthwait's intent in this black comedy.",1333756800,25,1855,5.072131147540984
5110726,5,B007UW9W8W,"Bobcat Goldthwait, is known as a comedian, an extreme character actor of the 80's, but it's as a director that I cherish is work most. The films he crafts, are not popcorn flicks, they are not gag heavy. His films are thoughtful, dark, funny bits of ugly and yet are at times more beautiful than a drama that makes you feel because it has a sweeping score. These are not films for people seeking out comfortable fare. They are not rehashes, remakes, prequels, offshoots. These are original films, with heart and thoughts that if you don't have already, you will after you see them. His filmography is short, but every one is worth a viewing, even Shakes the Clown, though less poignant, still has underlying thoughts that should be observed. I'm proud to put God Bless America, among his films, and happy to say, he's hit every time he's gone up to do so. I implore you to seek out his work, and prepare to laugh, feel mixed up, and think. I can't recommend this film enough.

You'll notice I haven't really said anything about the film specifically, and I think it's because, you've already read a synopsis, what more can I tell you without ruining something specific that you should discover on your own?

Just watch it.",1333756800,19,1222,4.60091743119266
5110727,5,B007UW9W8W,"Are you one of those people who feel ill when exposed to reality televison?  Did you watch the moive Idiocracy and think, ""This isn't just a movie, it's a prophecy.""  Do you let idiots win arguments because it just isn't worth it to waste the oxygen?  If you have answered yes to any of these questions, then I highly recommend that you watch God Bless America.

God Bless America has to be one smartest films I've seen in years.  This isn't some generic garbage that Hollywood poops out, with the intention of pleasing everyone...it's the exact opposite.  This movie has a target audience, and you'll be 100% sure if you're that target audience, if you can make it past the first five minutes of the movie.  If you can't make it past the first five minutes of this movie, I would suggest you go  and enjoy some Jersey Shore reruns.",1333670400,112,832,4.5
5110728,5,B007UW9W8W,"This is a commentary movie on nearly every aspect of our culture and country.
I just got done watching this, and I've been anticipating it since I saw the preview on Google+ back in February.

It had to have been an easy movie to write because there's so much material to choose from. And let's be honest, every American male has probably considered going around and getting rid of all the people in the country ""that deserved to die"" like in this movie. This movie is a great exercise in fantasy, for sure.
It may be a ""low budget"" film, but it didn't seem like it. Cinematography was great.

Only watch the PG version of the trailer because I think the other trailer gives away too much of the awesomeness of the movie. It definitely has some violence, but if you saw Kick-Ass, it is a bit less violent than that mainstream movie.

My only real complaint is that is swung a little to far to the left (like Avatar) but it was still reasonable and wasn't annoying about it as Avatar.  You right-wingers can handle it, I promise.

It will have a limited release, not showing anywhere near me. So I watched it on demand on Amazon. $10? It's a bit much if you're used to Netflix, but it costs less than going to the theater and I considered that I can't even see it in the theater near here.",1333670400,,1288,4.327800829875518

The film was soooo cathartic. Seeing what this once great nation has become is truly maddening. I know the vigilantes had to die in the end but I wish it had been set in Trump's era and that they'd assassinated him and his entire staff as well, as Treason once commanded the death penalty.

We are a cruel, decadent nation of selfish narcissists and shallow greedy parasites who worship only money, easy lazy luxury, and attention.

5110739,4,B007UW9W8W,"This is a film that meets the criteria I believe those classic, artful critics ascribe to  Great Films. But is actually good. It removes us from our contemporary circumstances and 'resets' us. Forces us to a different perspective. Away from the semi-brainwashed, desensitized to way too much and uber-free of discernment existence we embrace today. Do our times emulate the last days of the Roman Empire? Goldwaith fleshed out some interesting ideas here. Some may see them as Heroic, even. I wouldn't think I'd have much to discuss with the Comedian, much less appreciate his work. And I'm telling you- it's a good movie. I recommend you watch it- but If you-like I do-dislike gore/cartoonish violence-prepare to turn away a few times.

5110743,5,B007UW9W8W,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indies.  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

And while this film does get a little more outrageous than I outlined above and is chock full of action and violence, its still definitely up my alley and made me want to check out all director Bobcat Goldthwait's films (think I'd seen at least one before this and liked it, too, which led me to this one).  Though this one is still my favorite.  Reminded me a lot of Falling Down.  Great movie about an average, oppressed, downtrodden guy who just has enough of all the mean people in the world and decides to do something about it.  My kinda hero.  Basic premise: Mean People Suck :)

I won't say I agree with all the people on he and the girl's list (especially the girl's, talk about an extremist, haha.  Maybe that was part of the point?  None of us are perfect and all have our biases that make us imperfect judges, juries, and executioners?), but I just couldn't take offense, because I will say they definitely mostly had the...""right"" people ;)  Also, for people being harsh on the protagonist, calling him a ""loser"" or whatever, I wonder if they'd be as harsh if he were female, since I've noticed similar films with female protagonists getting more leniency from reviewers in that department.  Double standard?

Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494633600,,2295,4.608374384236453

Tara Lynn Barr is wonderful as the Bonnie to his Clyde, as they take off killing people who are mean or just stupid.  Quite a few times Joel will ask his victim ""why do you have to be so mean"" and I think it is perfect for this day and age, when people are JUST mean, so they can be famous, so they can get more listeners or whatever their goal is.

5110753,1,B007UW9W8W,"My friends showed me this movie because they know I have become disillusioned with much of society. I have the bias of being generally disgusted by dark comedy but I do love satire. If there was a message of hope eventually, I might've enjoyed it. Still, probably not. The concept of murdering everything that annoys you is absolutely horrific.

Eventually, my friends  could see I was so uncomfortable that they changed the movie. Growing up in a culture that truly believes media to be controlled by the devil, I was frustrated with the main character's indictment of popular culture. I have stepped away from that way of thinking and I entertain myself with the things that make me feel glad I watched them.
As he sat there ready to kill himself while watching reality television, I was just yelling at the screen telling him that there are plenty of better things to watch. Cable TV doesn't have the influence it used to. The entirety of the world isn't on My Super Sweet 16. There are plenty of intelligently written shows with which to spend one's time.
This movie disturbed me so much, I even wrote a blog post about it! The trouble is that intelligence is in some ways relative. One day you're on this killing spree destroying all those who you deem idiotic, the next, you're someone else's target in their killing spree of those with a lesser intellect. Nobody holds a monopoly on knowledge. People are varied and nuanced. Killing them because you are irritated by the one aspect they've shown you in public is absolutely disgusting.
The way you experience life depends on what you let into your world. The main character hated his job, he was incredibly bored and disillusioned, then he got fired. Great! Now he can get a different job and see the better parts of society, stop depressing himself with cable TV and find things, friends even who challenge his intellect and sharpen his compassion. But this movie was not about that. It was about revenge against people by whom you've never personally been wronged.

Like an above reviewer, even for watching 20min of the movie, I wish I could give it 0 or negative stars and get back the money I paid to watch this movie for free and get back everything else it tried to steal from me. My hope, my faith in humanity, and my sanity. Disgusting. Do realize that before watching.",1477872000,,2335,4.662621359223301

5110756,2,B007UW9W8W,"It's ironic that Goldwait writes and directs a movie condemning what he made his fortune at, mocking the strange and apparently demented, the pumping out of shlock and cheese for profit in a nation that consumes it, and those who don't respect that of others (set fire to Jay Leno's stage).

That he does so by featuring two people who epitomize the values he apparently rails against, shallow people who would kill those that hold different values than they do only adds to it.

He mocks us for being mean and condemnatory is simply hypocritical of him when this movie is just one long fest of same.

5110785,2,B007UW9W8W,"It's easy to find things to hate about any country or culture; it's especially easy to find things to hate about the USA. The fact that so many Americans are ""in on the joke,"" and laugh about the absurdity of their own civilization concerns me. This isn't the first movie to raise awareness on a rather serious issue, while at the same time being flippant about its own message. Idiocracy comes to mind. And although God Bless is funny, at times, I feel guilty for finding it so. Here is a movie that highlights and ridicules the most shallow aspects of entertainment in the country, and rather than leave it at that, it devolves into some awful parody of itself by investing in massive amounts of violence. Maybe the director is trying to pander to his audience, who even though they believe themselves to be above the vile figures portrayed, are nothing more than consumers of the very filth railed against in the film. This is hypocrisy at its finest, in other words, and everyone is in on it. Me too, and I hate myself because of that. Having seen the previews before, I started watching the film with some knowledge of the plot. I wanted to sit and watch the mutilation and destruction of things that I see as repugnant. Unfortunately, I became repugnant for indulging in that desire. I haven't felt this dirty watching a flick since Borat.

Structurally, God Bless is very well-made. Even if the ending is predictable, you get that feeling as with all good road-trip movies -- you're just along for the ride, no matter the destination. The acting is superb. The only other program I've seen Joel Murray in is Mad Men. He was a decent choice for the disillusioned Frank.

5110786,5,B007UW9W8W,"After reading the description, and a couple of the reviews, I decided to give this movie a chance. I was both humbled and entertained, though it was not the type of entertainment I expected. The idea behind the movie is what humbled me, since in real life, I refuse to watch reality tv, both the family style and the idiots hurting themselves to make themselves famous on TV. This is a movie that makes you think of how we are raising our youth, as well as how we have changed the type of ""Entertainment"" we currently watch. This should be a must watch, just for the lessons on how we treat each other. I will not give any spoilers to ruin the experience, Frank was over the top, but I think it was necessary in the movie that his character pushed the limit to get the point across. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to think, not just stare at the tv and not remember what they watched the day after.

I would have given it 5 stars because the acting and direction are wonderful, but there's just no way it could happen.  I'm all about suspending my disbelief, but there's just too much going on here to be believable. There's no way they would have been able to evade the cops as long as they did.  I want to see clearly how they're able to do it, but they just expect us to believe that they do.  Also, the film itself gets really preachy about societal arguments today like the injustice of disparate payscales etc.  I understand that the kid is an anarchist idealist and so is the main character, but the soliloquies are excessive.  We get it.  You're mad at stuff.  People are stupid.  I get it already. We know why you're shooting those twits, now just shoot them and be happy. I'm just telling you, cops are way better trained than to let you get away with stuff for no reason.  For example, maybe the idiot neighbor was a crack head and DIDN'T report his car stolen. One shot could have told us that.  Anyway, the acting was grand for the two stars.  Really superb.  Everything else cost this movie a star.",1437696000,3,1251,4.378260869565217

Exhausted, sick and very tired of being kicked around, he launches his vengeance on reality tv media-huggers. Along for the ride is a teen runaway (Tara Lynn Barr) whose disgust for the same scummy types make them a perfect pair for bloody clean-up time.

Small budgetted and a full little package by Bobcat Goldwait, GBA has a growing, buzzy following. We've seen all of the elelments over and over: the loner with guns who cracks up because society drives him to it. Well, GOD BLESS finally points the gun at something, and plenty of that ""something"" that we all just plain hate. Think ""American Idol"" sucks? Me, too. Hate those self-promoting ""Real Housewives"" shows? Same here. Wish you could just whack a few preening celebs, TMZ schmucks and spoiled tabloid self-agrandized famous? Join the club.

Great music by Alice Cooper, Ray Davies and this and that all contribute to a small gem.

So, concluding: If you've ever just wanted to blow away all of those moronic quasi-celebs, bad politicians and their fans who dominate every inch of tv, web and print these days, pop some snacks and let this do the dirty work for you. Trust me, this'll deliver the dark, bloody, satisfying laughs.

He is the victim of his own ability to sense outrage where it is warranted. God Bless America was made for every reasonable person pushed beyond his limits by the madness we can't ignore. We see ofttimes destructive behaviors elevated to an art form, creating celebrities out of the sorts normally shunned and despised. Political correctness creates criminals out of the innocent, yet the defenseless can be skewered mercilessly for ""reality"" entertainment in the media. Frank's rampage to rid society of this vermin is outrageous, yet we somehow tolerate it better than screaming teenagers demanding free cars on reality TV. Even murder is less stomach-turning than that.

With all the crap on TV now a days I was pleasantly surprised to find a movie that echoed what I disdain in America today.  I found it reassuring that they went with a possible conservative and possible liberal main characters to portray there actions driven by not politics but truly by the things that are ruining America.

5110835,5,B007UW9W8W,"This is definitely one of the most underrated movies in recent memory.  We saw ""God Bless America"" not long after it came out, and at the time I thought it was incredibly funny, tremendously insightful, and deeply moving.  After watching it again last night, I had those same reactions again.  It's a shame that more people have not seen this movie or are aware of it, because it's some of the best social commentary on life in the U.S. that has been done in recent memory.

I won't go into the plot in a lot of detail, but the story is about Frank, an earnest man who has tried to live the American dream but has ended up divorced, gets fired from his job soon after the movie starts for showing innocent concern to a co-worker that is misinterpretated as sexual harrassment, and soon finds out he has terminal cancer.  His evenings are spent watching TV, and we are ""treated"" to what is ubiquitous reality TV that shows the putrid state of discource in our society and what passes as ""entertainment.""  Feeling he has nothing left to live for, Frank decides to do something about it, and goes on a killing spree to try and restore some small bit of sanity to the world.

Obviously this is a dark comedy, and anytime you combine bullets and laughter it can be difficult to pull off.  But Goldthwait does pull it off, and the movie is at times hysterically funny while also making you wince.

It's not a movie without flaws, and I won't go into its flaws here.  But the positives so outweigh the negatives that I can't give this anything less than five stars even though it's not a perfect movie.

It's a shame more people didn't see this and that it became a cultural event, because this is a movie that has a lot on its mind and expresses its perspective powerfully and even movingly.  It's a plea for sanity in a world that has lots its moorings.  And it's damn funny too.",1426982400,3,1874,4.412790697674419

5110893,4,B007UW9W8W,"GOD BLESS AMERICA (2011) is director-screenwriter Bobcat Goldthwait's loving Valentine card to Americans. Outside, to get our attention, it portrays a pair of vigilantes with guns blazing in all directions. Inside, its message is ""Please try to be NICER to each other!""

Frank (Joel Murray)--divorced, fired from his job, and perhaps suffering from a massive inoperable brain tumor--has long been disgusted with the rampant selfishness, thoughtlessness, and downright MEANNESS of a large segment of America, a character defect that virtually all viewers will easily recognize in dozens of this movie's satirical scenes. While preparing to commit suicide, Frank decides to execute one mean celebrity who lives near him before he dies.

During this somewhat bumbling first execution, Frank is observed by a teenage girl calling herself Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr), who persuades him to forgo suicide and team up with her on a cross-country shooting spree that will include minor meanies (like those who use cell-phones in movie theaters and who deliberately take TWO parking places) and major meanies (an organized bigot-group resembling the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, fake-news broadcasters who deliberately divide America with lies, and cruel TV talent-show judges who mock contestants to get laughs).

Since few of us are  going to have identical levels of disgust or anger toward any or all of the ""targets,"" be prepared to have mixed feelings about many parts of this film ... AND be prepared to learn that your mixed feelings were foreseen and encouraged by Bobcat Goldthwait when he wrote his screenplay.

The DVD comes with a Commentary Track (Goldthwait, Murray, and Barr conversing about aspects of scenes), interviews, and other bonus features. I very strongly encourage viewers to watch several if not all of these. The purpose of the whole film and the purposes of many individual scenes not only CAN be misunderstood, but they in fact often HAVE BEEN misunderstood.

5110900,5,B007UW9W8W,"Once every not-so-often, I come across a movie that hits me like a punch in the face. Everything about it rings true  the script is full of zingy one-liners, the cast knows what they're doing and it feels like this thing was made for a very good reason. This happens once in a blue moon. In this case, Im going to tell you about a little movie I just watched called God Bless America.

Frank Murdoch (Joel Murray) is a normal guy. Hes divorced, and his daughter is a little whiny brat, very much the product of her environment. Frank sits on his couch every night, trying to find something good on television. He sees the disgusting behavior glorified on singing and mean-girl reality shows. The problem is that this country eats this stuff up like its candy. People cant get enough of their dumb entertainment and famous-for-being-famous celebutards. Frank finds out he has a massive brain tumor and will likely die soon. He considers suicide, but ultimately goes on a rampage to kill all of the stupid people wasting space on this good Earth. Likeminded teenager Roxie (Tara Lynne Barr) eventually joins forces with him, and they become a team devoted to making the world a better place, one murder at a time.

With all of the mass-shootings and equally disgusting violent crime depicted on the local news every day, its obvious that a film this honest and cynical might not be for everyone. It glorifies violence, but at the same time it doesnt. It is not a film of ideas, but a film of reactions. If you fall outside of the bell curve of American people who love trash culture, you might really enjoy this movie. In the back of your head, you may have wondered all along, what would happen if someone just killed these idiots once and for all?

Another thing that makes this film remarkable to me is that its full of unknown actors, and yet it features two of the most memorable performances in recent memory. Murray is perfectly cast as the everyman who has simply had enough already, and Barr brings a whole lot of fun to the table. This movie will make neither of these people stars, because its so gloriously politically incorrect, and will likely not be accepted by the masses.

God Bless America is a scathing satire with a gaping hole where its heart should be. It doesnt need a heart, for it has a brain. Its a sobering and perceptive statement on where we stand as a culture at this point in time. Even though this movie is a few years old, it feels as if it was made yesterday. It could be dismissed as left-wing propaganda, because sometimes it does get a bit heavy-handed with the political side (a Glenn Beck type is brutally murdered), it provides a point of view that isn't biased, because in some way, we all kind of relate to Frank. If you find yourself on the couch looking for something to watch on Netflix, give God Bless America a try. Itll give you plenty to laugh about, but a lot more to think about.

5110903,4,B007UW9W8W,"Echoing others, this is a somewhat preachy vigilante flick, buoyed by solid performances from Mr. Murray and Ms. Barr, and the thoughtful,unobtrusive direction of Bobcat Goldthwait.  Evenly paced if somewhat unbelievable premise that one guy could basically go on an invisible killing spree, taking out baddies several at a time while avoiding capture without all that much effort.  The demise of humanistic culture in America aside, the film gains credibility by confronting the Murdoch character with several life-altering situations in a compact time window.  His sense of self governance suddenly MIA, he takes out his anger and frustration on anyone and everyone.

To his credit, Bobcat never succumbs to prurience by forcing the middle aged vigilante and his teenage charge into a forced, compromised sexual adventure at the same time they exact revenge.

Not perfect and not entirely believable, but well done and thought provoking.  The slo-mo scene with the Kinks singing ""I'm Not like Everybody Else"" is golden.",1398297600,,1021,5.389937106918239

5110909,3,B007UW9W8W,"Frank (Joel Murray) just does not seem to have any luck in life. A divorcee whose daughter hates him, he lives next door to obnoxious and inconsiderate neighbors. Things go from bad to worse for Frank when he gets fired from his job after a nonsensical sexual harassment complaint and then is diagnosed as terminally ill with a brain tumor by his rude doctor. He spends his evenings watching TV and is disgusted with the lowbrow quality of everything he sees. He is about to commit suicide when he changes his mind and instead goes on a mission to rid America of what he sees as the most hateful people. Along the way, he forms an unlikely friendship with teenage psychopath Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr).

To be sure, the film starts off quite promising. Even though Frank's predicaments are exaggerated for comedic effect, you do start to feel for him. His complaints early in the film about trash TV and the lack of kindness in society does make one stop and think and wonder if he really has a point. There are some pretty funny jokes throughout the film.

However, I felt the film was far from perfect. While watching it for the first time, I felt the film was getting pretty tired about halfway through. By this point, you already know what is going to happen as Frank and Roxy run around waving guns and shooting people they dislike. After the first time, the characters' soliloquies are too in-your-face and sound far too scripted. The film overall really lacks subtlety. Another complaint is the Roxy character. I thought she was paper-thin and she does not develop at all throughout the entire movie. Unlike Frank who has a general motivation for his actions, Roxy just seems to like being violent for the sake of being violent.

Many people have compared this film to 1993's Falling Down which is how it originally caught my eye. However, the similarities between the two films are only superficial. Both feature a laid-off and divorced main character who become disillusioned with the society they are forced to live in. However, Falling Down had a more gritty realism to it while God Bless America is far more over the top and violent.

Also included on this DVD are numerous bonus features including an audio commentary by director Bobcat Goldthwait and the two principal actors, some interviews, and a making-of documentary.

This movie was a mixed bag for me. While there is a decent message in there about its critique of modern American culture regarding lowbrow television, celebrity worship, and general rudeness, this message gets lost amongst excessive violence. It may be a violent fantasy film that I am sure will appeal to many people.",1396742400,3,2653,4.783842794759825

5110924,5,B007UW9W8W,"This is a movie that ""Falling Down"" half-assed breezed at, came somewhat close to for about 30 to 45 minutes, but then some producer realized that they would have to show the end result in mainstream corporate-owned-chain-movie theatres and so took a hard turn off the road upon which it started and made a middling weak milk-toast crapfest instead ...

""God Bless America"" has the high beams on and barrels down this two-lane, ill-lit back road with plenty of potholes full bore, engine screaming, alignment in constant jeaopardy, and a huge rooster-tail of dust arcing into the sky behind them as they go. It doesn't shy away from the subjects that need to be addressed in this country ... such as why the riders of 'the short bus' (as mentioned in the movie) are suddenly on tv and are perfectly fine to laugh at, mock, and ridicule? i recall getting smacked upside the back of the head if i even snickered at these kids because it was impolite ... not to mention that with only an odd chromosonal quirk i could be riding right along with them. They are not to be laughed at. Further, they are not to be pitied. They are to be treated as you would like to be treated. But parading them in front of a tv audience to be mocked is sick yet tv executives and the faithful followers of the show apparently never got clipped in the back of the head like i did ... apparently, they don't know any better, for some reason. Of course, once we start seeing the 'parenting' going on in this movie, and by extension, this country, we soon understand why things are as they are.

And so this movie explores those attitudes in America at the beginning of the 21st century. Think about that ... it is the 21st Century and this is our main form of entertainment. When i was a kid there was a movie called ""Rollerball"" that came out which was the subject of HUGE debates and AGHAST outcries from newspaper editors, tv sports shows (Howard Cosell no less denounced it), and even from the pulpit of the church i was coerced to attend as a young teen. How horrible this movie was to portray such a horrible sport that was played to the death. I suppose some christians might have been a wee-bit sensitive about it since that old coliseum bugaboo might still be up their collective butt (tho somehow i doubt they knew anyone who was closer than a sixth generation removed from those poor sods tossed into the ring) but then to go home after that sermon and watch three straight football games where 22 men filled with the beginnings of the steroid craze and the much better scientifcally explored use of cocaine and speed and painkillers to make these oversized rabid madmen into literal killing machines and not think abother thing about ""rollerball"" might, to my mind, ended up just a wee-bit hypocritical when was was said and done. After all, football was fine. Not too many people got killed. Some got crippled but once in a wheelchair they soon found god so that was all well and good. (Remember Daryll Stingley was damn near killed by Jack Tatum ... pretty frightening to think what Tatum would have been today with the expert quality of steroid use now available. My god he would have killed someone. I know Wilbur Marshall certainly got as close as anyone i've ever seen.)

So i imagine many people will decry ""God Bless America"" as senseless violence and that the shows they 'fictionlize' in the movie are over-the-top portrayals and not even close to the fine family fare that is offered by the networks and cable. Has anyone watched ""Jerry Springer""?

Bobcat Goldthwait is a genius who hits it right on the head once again. His view of society is always a bullseye and never wavering. I know why he doesn't get more opportunities to make these kinds of movies. It's amazing they allow him to do the few he does and to get them distributed at all.

Bobcat I'm behind you and i'll always be behind you.

As for the acting? It's top notch, very natural and shows the perfect amount of affection between Joel Murray (an underrated Murray family talent) and the young and promising Tara Lynne Barr. Can't wait to see more from Barr as well as Murray and Bobcat, of course.

And yes, Green Day SUCKS, as I mentioned in another post ... Green Day completely ripped off Stiff Little Fingers and did a piss-poor job of it at that ... listen to SLD and heave your Green Day cd's out the window as you blast down one of this nation's fine interstates. It's really cool to watch them sail thru the air and it will do your mind a whole lot of good.

take care,

5110926,1,B007UW9W8W,"I admired Bobcat Goldthwait 25-30 Years ago - as a stand-up comic. This movie is Disgraceful though!! - Sickening!
I get this film - about how America has further deteriorated over the years - from who we Used to be - on so many levels.
How a kind deed at work - can later get us fired. How TV lost what mind it once had.
How people mindlessly embrace the insane (like some do with this movie).
But - Then - to resolve - or even to try to obtain a moment of satisfaction in killing the idiots portrayed in this film - the message is clear - 'treat severe dysfunction - with mass slaughter'.

I don't have the answers to all that the world needs to do - but - I don't have to compete or try to top other people's dysfunctional insanity. - Sometimes the best I can do - is just disconnect from other people's craziness - and do the next right thing in front of me. - Unlike this sick movie.

I'm not going to waste much more of my time reviewing this movie - it has already taken more of my life and disgust than I thought I was  offering. When is Amazon going to allow us the option of a 'Zero Star rating' - and/or even better - 'Negative ratings' in the minuses - where this movie belongs!!

5110928,4,B007UW9W8W,"I like Bobcat Goldthwait. He's smart, he's funny, and he's opinionated. I like all of those things, and even when I disagree with him, I still like seeing what he's up to whether it be in stand up or directing a new movie. As a writer and director Goldthwait has improved dramatically over the years, and this is a very well made movie that is an impressive creative achievement, even though I do quibble with one of its premises. As Bobcat explains in one of the (excellent) extras, the film is about ""a liberal with a gun"" and is ""a call for kindness."" I agree with him on both accounts, and appreciate the fight Goldthwait wages against rampant materialism, societal ugliness and irresponsibility, and narcissism. These are completely valid targets for a satire and wry cultural commentary, and Bobcat excels at skewering these excesses mostly through the technique of mocking reality shows which here are thinly disguised counterparts of actual televised atrocities (e.g. ""American Superstarz."")

The protagonists, Frank (Joel Murray) and Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr) have had enough with society and take out miscreants one jerk at a time in a wicked killing spree. Most of this is directed against reality star Chloe, her awful family, and the like, but the added theme is that the political right is a key underpinning of the lack of civility with typical xenophobia and oil company propaganda masquerading as genuine political positions and news stories with captions like ""Tea Party Members Assault Parkinson's Sufferer."" I would be curious how many of the producers in Hollywood behind the reality shows he skewers so well are Fox News acolytes. (I'm guessing none.) I am not defending the likes of Sean Hannity here (he can defend himself just fine, and I haven't watched him since Alan Colmes left,) but I guess Bobcat missed Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthew's venom over the last decade or so. Bobcat is welcome to make any political point he wishes of course (it's his movie,) but it's fair to point out the philosophical disconnect that if he's arguing that reality shows and popular culture are making the US a meaner country (I believe they are and completely agree with the premise, by the way,) he is blaming the wrong side of the political fence for this problem, rendering the plea in the film that ""there's no right or wrong"" anymore moot. In the film's climax Frank makes a valid criticism that ""America has become a cruel and vicious place. We reward the shallowest, the dumbest, the meanest, and the loudest."" That is completely true on reality television, and as I have stated I think it's not only to the key to the film, it's a genuine societal concern. What gets lost in this vision though is that reality television isn't reality.

Having explained my philosophical differences with the film let me tell you why I liked it. It's extraordinarily well acted and directed. Camera work is excellent throughout, and the ambience of the film makes the characters sympathetic despite their deeply sociopathic crimes. Although I don't agree with all his positions, I do think Goldthwait's ""call for kindness"" (as odd as that may sound given the context) is brilliantly written and makes excellent points about American pop culture; I'm glad he made them, as he can do so with more nuance than most. The extras are also superior: the interviews are golden with a few hidden gems emerging: see Bobcat explain why ""Oliver Stone has the sense of humor of a Vulcan,"" and why he wants to get a merkin for his eyebrows, among many other humorous diversions.

This movie will not be for everyone, but if you loathe reality television and have no objection to satirical violence with a point, I recommend it to all open-minded viewers.",1386115200,2,3743,4.872841444270016

5110934,4,B007UW9W8W,"God Bless America is a parody and criticism of pop culture all at once.

Almost in parody of Natural Born Killers, we have an older man and young girl drawn to killing for their own reasons: the girl because it's ""glamorous"" and the guy because he's sick of the way people treat each other and feels we'd be better off with less jerks around. Admittedly, he started first and only started because he found he was dying of cancer, but that makes sense. Watching him progress from trampled down and miserable to vigilante is shades of ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" and rather fun to watch.

The rest hits on teen slayers, theater murder sprees, and ""Celebrity-making"" TV shows like American Idol in a steady parade of destruction all while asking ""Why can't you just be nice to others?"" There's a lot of subtle character development as well, but I can't say too much without serious spoilers. The shots are clear and bright and many comedic moments shine with good pacing thanks to Bobcat Goldthwait's work.

Overall God Bless America is a good movie. I don't think it's a true classic, but it's still worth watching if you're sick of pop culture fascination and wish someone would just up and shoot the self-entitled jerks already.",1382054400,2,1225,4.714953271028038

5110936,3,B007UW9W8W,"God Bless America is a great concept for a movie, and one which has a lot of potential, not just as an idea but also as a critical success in today's television and film milieu. The premise is simple. An average Joe - known to us only as Frank - loses patience with what he sees as the entitled and vicious culture of a decadent empire, and goes on a murder spree. What distinguishes it from other stories about serial murderers is that here, the killer is unabashedly billed as the hero. This is bound to make some people very uncomfortable (see vitriolic reviews for details), and in full disclosure, ends up being the main reason the movie becomes increasingly uninteresting after the first half hour.

The first thirty minutes of GBA on the other hand are truly masterful at times, showing with painful detail every aspect of Frank's slow slide into homicidal rage. This is done quite candidly, and with a viciously black sense of humor, such that it is both quite funny and truly abbhorent to watch. It is high satire, plain and simple, and the stick that director Bobcat Goldthwait uses to poke fun at our society is exquisitely sharp. Unfortunately, once he puts that stick away in order to give our hero a gun, the movie quickly loses steam.

Joel Murray turns in an extremely compelling performance as Frank, but as soon as he has to share the frame with Tara Lynne Barr, who plays an ADD high schooler named Roxy, everything takes a turn for the worse. For no discernible reason other than the influence of an emotionally unstable teenager with latent violent tendencies, Frank quickly and dramatically relaxes the reins on his conscience, and we start to see people in his crosshairs who really have no business being there. The cerebral, deeply emotional, even ethical thinker (sans a few noteworthy scenes of extreme violence) we see in the early stages of the film vanishes, as though Roxy has shown up to say ""Nope, sorry gang, it's not that kind of movie anymore."" She is a likeable character, but she has no business being in this movie, and the dramatic split between the beginning of the movie and its meat and resolution never works itself out.

What this amounts to is that the rest of GBA just isn't very interesting. The action isn't bad but it isn't great by itself, the relationship between Frank and Roxy isn't bad but it isn't great by itself, the narrative isn't bad...you see where I'm going with this? The director plays all his high cards in the first half-hour, and all that's left is an average film that - as funny as it is to say this about a movie about a serial murderer - has lost its moral compass. In fact, it feels very much as though we've crossed into the realm of glorifying violence for violence's sake, and though I disagree with their tone and content, many of the most critical reviews of GBA here on Amazon point to the undeniable fact that the movie crosses - blunders, really - into some very dangerous and insensitive territory later in the film.

Having said that, the movie's build-up period is an intelligent and biting inditement of American values, truly entertaining to watch. My only parting advice to you is the following: Watch the first three minutes. If you are so offended you are already tempted to turn off the movie, please do.

For a better indictment of violence in our society and a decay of morals, the OTHER movie Series 5 is more chilling, as it thrusts normal people into kill or be killed situations for the entertainment OF the masses, whereas this is just an opportunity for characters to off characters whom it is politically correct not to like at this time.",1372982400,2,756,4.960629921259843

The movie had the potential to be very good, but there were definitely anti-conservative and anti-religious themes throughout. Overall I would classify it as a poorly written and executed rip off of ""The Last Supper"" from 1995 (a way better movie might I add). There is also a very disturbing scene with a child in the beginning of the movie which made me almost stop watching.

In the very beginning the guy daydreams about shooting a baby with very graphic blood and gore from the killing spewing all over its mother. A mentally handicapped man is shot in the end as well.

5110954,1,B007UW9W8W,"Spoiled, entitled Hollywood celeb Bobcat Goldthwaite takes aim at spoiled America and, clueless as a stump, doesn't realize he hit himself, and not just in the foot.  His flick is bloody self-indulgent, self-satisfied and self-righteous; all of which could be forgiven were it funny, or at least passably entertaining, but it isn't.  It is SO not funny or entertaining; Jesus, it's a 105 minute lecture/sermon.

White collar schlub Frank lectures his co-workers about trash-TV and the unraveling of civilization shortly before being called into the boss's office to be canned for sending flowers to the receptionist at her home after she complained about his unwanted ""advances"" (likely another Goldthwaiteian indictment of Souless Corporate Amerika).  He should have been sacked for boring his co-workers to sleep.  Thereafter, Frank decides to off himself, but not, in a last-minute decision, before offing some reality-TV spoiled, rich teenager (how spoiled, how rich, you ask? Well, the Lexus sport coupe' she got for her 16th was just so totally lame).  The murder doesn't go quite as planned, not least because Frank is spotted by another teen, this one a standard-issue spunky, precocious brat who thinks it just totally rad that he offed the spoiled rich brat.  Precocious Brat somehow tracks Frank to his seedy motel room, and they're off!  Cross-country killing spree, complete with Bonny & Clyde habiliment! (PB is really precocious - and hip - she's seen a bloody crime-spree flick made a good thirty years before she was.)

Note to Bobcat: Trading in stereotypes - especially tedious and grossly exaggerated stereotypes - doesn't really work with satire.  It tends to get you laughed at instead of your satire.  Also, a little snappy dialog, even cute, precious snappy dialog, say, like Matchstick Men or Paper Moon, would have gone a long way.  Dialog like ""Exploited some tragedies to further your agenda,"" or ""big oil companies' right to keep boiling the world alive"" (she says, just before she and papa-surrogate take off in a 12mpg American muscle car) will get some laughs all right, but not in a way you'll like.

Anyway, Frank & PB rid the country of a few real & imagined stereotypes that enlightened, entitled Goldthwaite doesn't like (and he doesn't make us guess - Precocious Brat rattles most of them off for us in her second scene) before Frank, while watching the news, realizes that - are you sitting down? - he's been had!  This girl hasn't been abused or abandoned, her parents are sensitive and caring, and OK, a little boring, but . . . she lied to him!  Frank packs her off back to the folks, and then there's Frank arming up for the big showdown at the nasty Simon Cowell talent show, and PB showing up just in the nick of time for the tearful reconciliation, and . . . well, fill the rest in yourself; whatever you come up with will be as good or better than BG's.

==================================================================

PS:  Speaking of the cultural trashosphere, while Goldthwaite's depiction seems way over the top, I must confess that I wouldn't really know for sure - I've never actually seen one of those reality TV series, or celebrity trash series, and I try to pay as little attention as possible to hate preachers, rabid-right (or loony-tune left) broadcasters, etc.",1371686400,5,3325,5.014545454545455
5110955,5,B007UW9W8W,"I can't believe I had to discover this movie while sifting through Netflix! I find it hilarious to say so, but this movie is important, and should be required viewing for all Americans. The film, through it's protagonists monologues defines perfectly, everything that is wrong with American culture as it stands today. We've become a society of lazy, attention deficit, mean spirited jerks who can't see past our own noses to see the damage we inflict on other people and society en mass. Modern ""celebrities"" are celebrated for their vanity and selfishness. Our ""news sources"" are nothing more than loud mouthed hypocritical talking heads.

I can see where the movie could come off as an excuse to hate America, no doubt it if had gained a wider audience that would be the argument against it. It is not however. The right wing pundits always talk about how they miss the America of old, they refer to the pre-civil rights movement era, and when gays were still firmly in the closet, and worse they refer to a country that never existed outside of their 6 year old minds. This is a movie truly in mourning for the real America of old, when intelligence was celebrated not mocked, when our celebrities actually had something of value to say, when we still at least had the illusion that our leaders were good people who cared about us.

The movie is obviously a satire, the actions the protagonists take are not meant to emulated, and the movie actually acknowledges that. Their reaction to go on a reality star killing spree is only the initial gut reaction to that kind of ignorance in an intelligent person. I dare any rational/intelligent person to say they've seen so much as a preview for Honey Boo Boo and didn't consider child murder(or at least her mother) for the first time in their lives. Or didn't want to beat someone to death because they wouldn't stop talking during a movie at the theater. After all, what else can you do with these people? Sadly their not even the real problem, the problem is much much worse, it's that our society somehow puts these so called humans on a pedestal! It's weird how stupidity slowly crept into society as being ok, even good. I think much of it started with Jerry Springer, we'd all tune in to see the parade of losers and psychos who were on that show on a regular basis to feel better about ourselves. Somehow those losers and psychos became celebrities. You can't kill everyone who worships ignorant people, all you can do is remain true to yourself, try to ignore them the best you can, and hope that the condition is not permanent.

As I say it's tragic that this movie didn't garner more attention than it did, it should be broadcast on every major network in a continuous loop(preferably during the final week of American Idol). Show it your friends, their friends, your children, their children, drag people in off the street, offer beer and food so they'll stay and watch this movie!

5110973,1,B007UW9W8W,"This review is only based on the first 15 minutes or so, at which point I turned it off.

While I can understand the main character's ranting against mindless drivel that is displayed on American TV, he seems to ONLY be against Conservative commentators, while having nothing at all to say against Liberals.  This makes me believe that the writers have not a societal agenda in mind, but a political one.

Also, the idiocy and irony of the main character's stating that he would defend the freedom of speech of those he opposes... but later on in the movie, he apparently kills those same people.... doesn't make much sense to me.  If you defend the freedom of speech of individuals to say things you disagree with, how can you justify killing them for saying exactly those same things?

5110976,4,B007UW9W8W,"At first I was a little disappointed with this film, it moved at a really slow pace (apart from the odd dream/day dream fantasy), there was a lot of just sitting around flicking channels of the TV by the depressed main character Frank. As well, conversations, such as the one in his work cubicle that just go on, and on.  But about half an hour in, once he steals his neighbours' car and decides he's going to take out someone who doesn't deserve to be alive, when he himself is about die from a brain tumour, and he then encounters the much more energetic Roxy, who saves him from himself, then joins him on his taking out the people who are what is wrong with the world today, it becomes a really fun film.  Granted the movie is not realistic at all, in real life they'd get caught pretty fast since they do nothing to really avoid that, such as ditching a highly visible stolen vehicle, or making any attempt to disguise themselves, but I think the overall over the top unbelievability factor lets you enjoy a film about murdering people, in the same way your 80s slasher film did, whereas with a realistic film you maybe wouldn't.

The movie does have a scene near the beginning where while asleep Frank's mind dreams of ending the torment of his noisy selfish neighbours by shooting them, including their baby which never stops crying.  I could understand some people not being comfortable with watching a movie with a baby being killed, and I really don't know why they included that scene other than to create controversy. I mean as you are watching it you're thinking, geese! People are going to complain about that, or even stop watching.  It was a dream by the tired mind of the main character and not something he did in real life in the film but the film and its storyline wouldn't really have suffered if it had been left out.

I think both of the main actors did a brilliant job.  I totally bought Joel Murray's performance as a depressed miserable guy who snapped and finally had enough when told he was about to die.  Likewise Tarra Lynne Barr's performance of a school girl aged groupie was brilliant.  I also liked how they went with an 18 year old actress rather than someone around 30 or older like most movies/TV shows do when portraying a teenager.  Obviously Barr's a few years older than the character she was portraying, but still that's better than the usual 15 year gap.  I'd definitely hope she goes onto star in more films in the future.

For me though the slow start of the film did lessen it overall, if I watched this again in the future I'd probably skip the beginning. I would have liked to have seen a bit more background on Roxy maybe in there to express to us viewers why she disliked the spoilt girl in her school. Maybe a scene of the girl with her entourage making fun of or bullying Roxy.  I would also have liked to have seen a few more people get their comeuppance, possibly the fun to watch taking out the jerks moments could have been expanded adding another ten minutes or so to the film, as it's only an approximately hour and half length movie.  The ending also was pretty unrealistic, someone surely would have taken a shot before what happens does but I guess this reinforces that this is a fun and not realistic film afterall.

I was also disappointed that there were no special features.  A few interviews with the cast, director or something like this, especially being that it's a controversial film would have been nice.",1366848000,5,3475,4.509554140127388

5110999,4,B007UW9W8W,"This film is principally a commentary on the vapid, soulless society we seem to have become. It satirically targets certain aspects of our current culture represented by reality television and the self-centered narcissism it champions. The action also takes a couple of shots at gun issues and workplace harassment.

The main character chooses a path of violent action against those he perceives as offenders of decency and good taste after he suffers a run of bad luck that concludes with his doctor informing him of his fatal condition. He picks up an under-aged female companion, or rather she forces her way into his life, and they form an interesting bond which is more realistic than their murderous quest.

I suspect this movie is not for everyone but I liked it. First, I like Indie, character-driven movies in general. Second, the movie satirized aspects of our culture that offend me as well.  The viewer should remember that satire typically addresses issues by carrying an aspect of its target to absurdity and this movie is no exception so if you are a devotee of American Idol, a gun enthusiast put upon by the gun control, close to someone killed in a shooting spree, or a victim of workplace sexual harassment then you might find this particular film as offensive as its main character finds reality TV.

Nope!  Think again.  Feel the dark sarcasm of the director, who unleashes the movie two characters, a deranged middle aged office worker gone mass murderer and a teenage girl who wants to kill people for ""giving and receiving high-fives"".  Is that the real world that the director is showing us, or is that the world through the eyes of these two?  Bobby Goldthwait plays a trick on the nave audience expecting to get simple and straightforward left wing propaganda, which this movie is not.  The message of this movie is: if you think to solve this world's problems through violence then you will receive violence.  Like in this case, through the bullets of police officers, causing the lights to go off for the two protesters.

The real success here, the best of the movie, is the time spent on the relationship between the two leads. Scratch away the dark comedy that works(for the most part) and the social commentary that largely doesn't....and you've got a story as clever and intellectually satisfying an interaction between two characters as anything you'll see in a more serious movie. Growing up as a teen during Goldthwaites successful-but-not-subtle 15 minutes in the 80's-90's, I was shocked to realize I would easily pay money to see him doing straight drama with the same heart and soul.

It's a flawed movie, to be sure: about an hour-ten of great filmmaking stretched into an hour-forty. I'm sure many will find some of the comedy falling flat in light of recent shooting tragedies, and the truth is, some of it was just never funny. But if you can live with a bit of filler, and just a tad of self-indulgent pretentiousness, the overall experience is well worth the effort, and a promise of better things to come.",1358035200,5,1124,4.764102564102564

5111021,4,B007UW9W8W,"The message of Paddy Chayefsky's 1976 film ""Network"" was clear enough: ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" Putting aside that the future media predicted by ""Network"", so shocking to 1976 audiences, would pass muster on The Disney Channel today, the message was clear, but the strategy wasn't particularly specific. How exactly are you not going to take it anymore, besides opening windows and yelling catchphrases?

In Bobcat Goldthwait's ""God Bless America"", both the problem and the coping strategy are laid out clearly. The problem: American society is rotten to the core. The strategy? Shoot it in the face.

Bobcat has clearly arrived as a director and screenwriter. The story is well written and unfolds on the screen masterfully, without giving in to the sort of precious indie filmmaker clichs that take you out of the movie. True, the lead character has some blocks of dialogue that, if you close your eyes, you can see being polished on a word processor. And you will want to stretch out your suspension of disbelief muscles before watching this film, particularly when it comes to the relationship between mass murderers and the cops who might like to speak with them for a moment. I mean, this guy is roaming the country in a bright yellow Camaro (stolen), accompanied by a pretty teenage girl (missing, presumed kidnapped), watching crystal clear surveillance photos of himself on the news every night - yet he can move freely and use his credit card for shopping, dining, and entertainment without any hindrance from the law enforcement community. Okay, he did eventually steal some license plates off another car - in broad daylight.

You know how foreign films can seem kind of confusing when you're watching them? (Stay with me here.) Between the subtitles and cultural differences, you kind of have to work for it? But after they're over, you're often left with something to mull over - you make connections, you begin to relate to the characters and situations, after the fact? Whereas American popcorn films are fun and entertaining while you're watching them, but once they're over, you're not sure if you actually watched a movie or just meant to? ""God Bless America"" delivers on both fronts. It's fun and entertaining to watch, with a steady flow of laugh out loud moments, and when it's over, you're left with something to think about. Like what to do about our rotten society. Hey, wait. Is that thing loaded?",1357430400,2,2455,4.910843373493976
5111022,3,B007UW9W8W,"I wanted to enjoy God Bless America, I really did. The whole plot and story, which revolved around a middle-aged man who is sick and tired of all the crass and vulgar content which passes itself of as ""entertainment"" nowadays and how Americans have become mean and lost their kindness and civility, sounds like my kind of movie. In the beginning I found the film funny and engaging, it was sharp and witty, if not a bit dark and disturbing, and the acting was fairly decent, however that all changed when he kills his first victim and Roxy enter's the picture. Now, a secondary character isn't bad in and of itself, and I wouldn't have minded if Frank had found a kindred spirit in Roxy, but to be completely honest, the character Roxy was very unlikable and in many ways represented all that is wrong with the youth of America, nowadays, she is incredible shallow, vulgar, and violent, and I have no idea why Frank even allows her to talk him into doing the things he does or why he even allows her to tag along on his killing spree. It is fairly ironic listening to her idiotic ranting on topics and people who aren't all that bad and certainly not ruining America or deserving of death, if anyone is truly deserving of death, it's her, as she is in no way above any of the people she cruelly judges. It is her character that ultimately brings the entire film down five stars to three. In all honesty, much of what God Bless America rails against and much of the things Frank says about modern American society, is spot on, and this is ultimately a very dark, almost depressing, but funny film. The media is saturated with sex, violence, cruelty, and stupidity, and many of the most vulgar, disgusting, mean-spirited, nihilistic shows and films are in fact the most popular and highest rated, it's actually kinda bizarre when you think about it. To be completely honest, America has NEVER been particularly known as one of the greatest places to live on this planet, even as early as the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Americans have been known for being more open, violent, and vulgar than Europeans, but it has now reached an all time low starting in the early 70's for the most part. And it only seems to be headed further down into the darkness, I wonder what sort of things my future kids will be exposed to, if I even have a TV when I'm raising my kids, I'm not entirely sure I will. The ending scene I feel was very symbolic of how the few people who are still decent, moral, and kind are slowly dying out, soon to become an extinct species if something isn't done about this mess of a society.

For some reason, I came back the next day and finished the film.  I should have gone with my first instinct; it did not get any better.  Although I agree with most of the politics in the film, I felt that any meaningful social message is lost in a flood of bullets and cliches.  It is almost like watching one of Bobcat Goldwaith's stand up routines from the 80's, where he screams at you half the time and you really do not understand what he is saying.  The movie works best during the times the main character reflects on our society.  Yes, we have become a society that is dumbed down by asinine reality shows, loud-mouth conservative talk radio hosts, people at rallies that have no clue what they really stand for, and too many individuals that just don't seem to show any common sense.  Many of the targets that the movie focuses on are those that I too have issues with.  But... enough to go on a murderous rampage? In light of the events that have taken place in our nation recently, not only is is not good entertainment, but is is downright irresponsible. Throughout the movie, the main characters talk about people that ""..deserve to die.""  Really? People that irritate me in the movie theater deserve to die?  Even people like Glenn Beck, Tea Party Member, and those protesting soldier funerals do not deserve to die.  I disagree with their points of view vehemently, but would never wish any harm upon them.  Really, in the end, the only people that truly deserve to die where the main characters.  What point is Goldwaith trying make? Does he seriously not think that murderous thugs with easy access to guns are an even BIGGER threat to our society than American Idol judges? And also, for someone that seems to have a disdain for cliche, he throws quite a bit of them around.  He takes pot shots at Diablo Cody, while creating a character that is indeed essentially a more mean-spirited and psychotic Juno.  And, the final shootout at the theater? No, that was not too Bonnie and Clyde, was it.  This was a truly badly conceived film.  I don't think I care to watch another film by ANY of its participants.",1357084800,15,2308,4.576642335766423

5111026,4,B007UW9W8W,"God Bless America is from the warped mind of Bobcat Goldthwait, the screechy voiced freak who was a staple of comedy films in the 80s (and cartoon voices of the 90s).  It turns out Goldthwait is a gifted writer too with an acerbic wit, which he puts to bloody use in ""God Bless America.""

""God Bless America"" uses ""Falling Down,"" as a template: middle-class loner Frank Murdoch (Joel Murray) fails at life and love, is fired from  his job, and decides to start fixing things by killing people.  When a movie begins with a baby being killed with a shotgun, you know you're in for some polarizing stuff. Fortunately, it's just a dream sequence (even Goldthwait isn't that crazy), but the plan that hatches in the mind of Murdoch is to simply fix the impolite world he lives in.

And that impolite world is a largely liberal fantasy.  The Westboro Baptists who protest everything, Bill O'Reilly's polemics, the Tea Party, and reality show stars are just a few of the people who earn Murdoch's bloody wrath. He is joined by underage Chloe (Maddie Hasson) who decides going on the run with a murderer is still better than surviving high school, and it's not long before she becomes a fervent endorser of Murdoch's means if not his methods.

If you can look past the obvious provocation, there's something quaint about how Goldthwait works in the idea that reality shows are based on reality and that it's somehow morally okay to kill people you disagree with, because that's still more polite than having to deal with them.

If Goldthwait simply left it at that, this would just be another revenge fantasy film.  But he doesn't, and he doesn't let his characters off the hook either. They are all deeply flawed, morally bereft, and hypocrites in their own secret ways.  ""God Bless America"" is less about the moral rot that is on display every day and more about our own disempowerment. In this film, two people attempt to take it back...and in doing so confirm that they're not better than the rest of us.",1356307200,4,2000,4.672364672364672

5111032,1,B007UW9W8W,"I had the misfortune of watching this junk two nights before the Sandy Hook school shooting tragedy. The good thing about this was that I checked it out from the library-I truly got what I paid for.

While I believe in free speech, there is also fool speech and yelling fire in a crowded theater. This film tests the limits of responsibility with this horrible, sick, vile story about a loser named Frank who fails at everything in life and is put upon by rude neighbors, ignorant co-workers, a bratty daughter, shrewish ex-wife, and an overall disgust over the crudity of 21st century popular culture. The film begins with Frank fantasizing about murdering a crying baby who disturbs his sleep. Later, he kills a teenage reality star (near her school, I might add) which attracts the attention of another bratty teenager (the girl on the cover of the DVD). The latter brat then joins Frank in a shooting spree, blasting away all who offend their standards. In one scene that was admittedly filmed before the Batman murders, Frank and the girl shoot rude patrons at a movie theater. Are you laughing yet?

Not only is this film disgusting for the above reasons. ""Frank"" (who appears to be in his 50s) stays in hotel rooms with his teenage accomplice. While no sex is openly implied, the underlying sexual tension is there and this has no place in movies intended for the general public. There is also an atrocious bit of business clealry intended for laughs involving an (obviously) mentally challenged singing contestant in an American Idol type spoof. The audience wildly hoots and mocks him as he does a horrific hip hop version of the Theme from Mahogany (Do you know where you're going to) that would send Diana Ross to a hospital bed. Of course, Frank and the teenage girl take on the audience for this. I'm surprised no scenes exist in this film of people tripping up blind people.

I flatly say that this movie is a work of pure sickness! It boggles my mind that there are people who find this funny in light of Colombine, 9/11, the Batman shootings, assassinations, the tragedy I mentioned at the beginning of this review, ad nauseum. What's next? Gladiators at the Colosseum? Public lynchings? The return of mentally handicapped court jesters? There are too many real life ""Franks"" out there who may be encouraged by this filth and this is one of the most inappropriate and irresponsible films since ""Birth of a Nation"" regenerated the Ku Klux Klan in 1915. Before going on his spree, ""Frank"" should have used this DVD for target practice.

5111041,5,B007UW9W8W,"This brilliant film is in the `Falling Down' genre, but is all about modern America or more correctly society and how it has gone south in the being nice and decent department. Frank has landed in middle age, he is divorced, has a daughter who would have been great in `The Exorcist', without coaching, neighbours that have taken `red neck' and made it their own, a job he gets fired from and his doctor has just told him he is going to die.

As he contemplates not wanting to live he gets pushed over the edge by a reality TV show where a spoilt rich girl gets to be on prime time just because she is rich, pretty and a total biatch. So he drives down to where she is for some not so random justice. That is where he meets Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr) and she wants to join him in killing as many people as they can who, quite simply, deserve to die. When you start to think of the categories of people that fit into that, not so exclusive `death list, it actually become a big job. Frank is just tired of reality television, selfish, rude people, the right wing single issue politics and pure toxicity of the moronic pop culture that is ruling and ruining the world, and God bless him for that. She hates high fives, racists, homophobes and religious bigots, plus a few more that she can enunciate with the language of a street walker - brilliant.

This is funny, intelligent, well acted and just a great ride. Joel Murray (`The Artist') is outstanding as Frank, the reluctant gun wielding guy, just asking people to be nice to each other. The soundtrack is great too with a lot of original material for the film, and it all hangs together brilliantly. Check out the end credits too where we have a credit to `Boy who gets shot in movie theatre # 2' and `Pancake eating pedophile' (sic), if that don't prove what a messed up work of genius this is, then I think nothing will.

It is fun to watch, it has guns, a lot of shooting, a lot of good jokes, etc. It has all ingredients of a blockbuster except of zillions of computer generated images. But 15 years ago there was almost no CGI. It also contains some legitimate critique of the American society. But its US gross box office is $122,029.00 and it was never shown on more than 15 screens. More or less nobody had a chance to see it in a theater.

There are not only guns, but also knives and killings and a lot of blood. All this is to be taken at the same time lightly and seriously. The main characters, Frank and Roxy, kill only bad guys, but for them the bad guys are not the usual blockbuster villains, but fairly common people. If you cannot stand a lot of blood, stay away from this movie. The same if need a traditional ""happy end"".

There are flaws. All prolonged moralizing speeches by Frank should be cut out. Such things should be implied or just hinted at by a few words. All current politics should be eliminated. The left-wing slant should be avoided even if the intended audience is left-leaning, although one can enjoy the movie independently of what party one likes more. Instead of the satirical version of the TV programming the real programming could be used. Actually, all this still can be done, and some director's cut can be released.

What this movie is about? It is definitely not about a killing spree of a middle-aged man and a teenager, although it is fun enough as just such movie. In an extra on Blu-ray the director said that it is wrong to compare this movie with ""Falling down"" (with Michael Douglas), as it is often done. ""Falling down"" is about an insecure, threatened man; Frank is neither, and this is what makes the movie funny.

For me, this movie is about a person who lived long enough to be fed up with the society, and cannot take it anymore. It may happen with a middle-aged man, with a teenage girl, or may never happen. Still, it looks like a lot of people are fed up. The only unrealistic assumption of the movie is that they act out their discontent in an very bizarre way, but the movie is not realistic in the first place.

There is an old French movie about the same issue, ""Dmons de midi"" by Christian Paureilhe (1979). The storyline is quite similar, but there are no such flaws as mentioned, despite ""God bless America"" is a comedy, and ""Dmons de midi"" isn't. It is hardly accessible now (I am sure that the same fate waits ""God bless America""). I wonder if the writer-director is aware of ""Dmons de midi"". Is ""God bless America"" is simply a sort of remake of ""Dmons de midi""? Or different people come to these troubling ideas independently?

Tara Lynn Barr plays Roxy with charming spontaneity and joy. Joel Murray plays Frank a little bit heavy, but I cannot tell who is at fault, he or the script.

Highly recommended, both as a pure entertainment and as an occasion to think if something is wrong about all of us (not just in America, ""Demons of the South"" is a witness). Do not miss the extras on the Blu-ray.",1350345600,4,3099,4.43585237258348
5111048,5,B007UW9W8W,"I won't pretend the movie is perfect. The ending left me sad; it was as if one of the main character's major purposes in life was not fulfilled. However, I experienced great joy from the fact that the duo of Tara Lynn Barr and Joel Murray portray surprisingly morally complex characters in this film, and they feel like fully fleshed-out people. Tara Lynn Barr's delivery is sometimes preachy and forced, but that is both excusable and unsurprising from a young actress still modulating her approach. Joel Murray is completely believable as a man completely and utterly disgusted with everything America has come to stand for.

Most importantly, the film does not ultimately resolve whether the cause of the main characters is just. Bobcat Goldthwait of course inspires sympathy in us for the main characters, but does not force us to accept their cause as righteous. Indeed, he qualifies their violent actions by reminding us that violence always has consequences, even if you try to limit the collateral damage.

I haven't been moved to really *think* by a comedy in a long time. I haven't experienced the level of catharsis- in both the normal and Aristotelian sense - inspired by this film in a long time.

5111069,3,B007UW9W8W,"Frank (Joel Murray), a lonely middle-aged man, diagnosed as terminally ill, embarks on a mission to get rid of those who he thinks are responsible for the moral decline in our modern society. Then Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr), a girl who ran away from her home, joins his journey. Unlike in a certain Nicholas Cage film, they wear no mask or costume. Frank and Roxy are more like Bonnie and Clyde, though Frank looks much older than his counterpart.

The best part of ""God Bless America"" is not the killing rampage by the incongruous pair, however; it is Joel Murray's subtle performance as Frank before he turns into a killer, as a decent person whose life is slowly falling apart. His ordinary life is made unbearable by the people around him in a plausible way. Dejected Frank turns on TV. All he sees there is stupidity.

So far, the film is good. But once the protagonist starts killing, we feel something is not quite right with the film. I am not talking about moral codes. I know this is a comedy, or a satire. The problem is that the story is not just interesting. Their ""mission"" soon gets repetitious as ""God Bless America"" does not know where it is going.

The film also fails to develop the characters of Frank and Roxy. What is their relationship like, for instance? Father and daughter? Partners in crime? Or Humbert Humbert and Lolita? We don't know. True, the movie is generally well-acted, but the direction is heavy-handed at times. We are not sure whether we should laugh or not when the protagonist starts rambling monologue about what he thinks deserves punishment. Are we supposed to laugh with him, or at him?

And when he speaks, he speaks on and on, as if being the mouthpiece of the director Bobcat Goldthwait. Our hero's preachy attack on everything he dislikes (from ""American Idol""-type reality shows to Diablo Cody and those who overuse ""actually"" in their conversation) is not only unfunny, but annoying, making us think: ""If you don't like TV shows, why don't you stop watching them and read a book instead?""

Maybe Goldthwait is aware of this. Or maybe not. What we know is ""God Bless America"" could have been a more insightful and funnier movie than it is, a one-note comedy of which second half drags.",1346976000,8,2231,4.666666666666667

5111083,5,B007UW9W8W,"After reading a few of the reviews, I see people seem to not even understand the concept of thinking let alone participate is this dying pastime. So I have decided to help you guys out.

First off, this is NOT a guide on how to kill conservatives or liberals or any other people or even hating on any specific religious, political, divergent sexually oriented, or racial groups. However this DOES hate on people who can't think for themselves and who just flat out don't care about the well being of other people.

If you look beyond the killing, and look at what Frank says, you can see that he is spot on in what has happened to America: how people now just repeat everything they hear on TV, how people act certain ways because ""everyone else"" acts that way, how people only act for their own convenience without any thought at all for what they are doing to other people in the process.

The movie presents a solution to a currently unsolvable problem. However, this solution, though effective in riding the world of cruel and disgusting people, can never be implemented. If you honestly think that this movie says ""go kill Tea Party members and people who work on Fox News"" then you should probably go back to shallow 1-dimensional movies.

Now for the actual review, after attempting to clear the air of stupidity:

Personally, this is one of my favorite non-fantasy/sci-fi movies of all time. This is probably due to the fact that I quite frequently get very annoyed at people who act like their brain is the head equivalent of their appendix.

The movie is more of a release than anything else. It gives intelligent viewers who get frustrated with the stupidity of the world a way of release, which is something they never really could do. If you point out how ridiculous something is to somebody, they instantly scream that you are a hater. If you try to have a simple debate with people they also call you a hater for not agreeing with them. If you try to be nice to people, they instantly think you are trying to take sexual advantage of them or something. Even if you try to be considerate, people will just ignore it or think you are weak and just be inconsiderate back to you. Now, if you can relate to any of this, wouldn't you get frustrated and want to do something?

This movie offers the simplest solution to all the problems listed above: just kill the people doing them. Obviously this can't be done in real life, but this is a movie and not real life. That is what makes this movie great. People can relate to the problems they have with people and can actually see those types of people getting exactly what they deserve, without any consequences.

To me, this movie is the embodiment of what non-fantasy/sci-fi movies should be: a ""what if"" of some situation in real life and a answer that could never be used. Just look at all ""reality"" movies this way: what issue is the movie addressing and what is the solution it is giving. I can guarantee you will find EVERY movie follows that basic set-up.

I am sorry if this is not a ""real"" review for the movie, but I believe that this review was more needed than the standard ""compare acting, directing, music score, plot, and story line to other movies"" way most movie reviews are made.

And if you really want to know, I am very far right wing, Republican, conservative, w/e term you want to use. Yet I have said I love this movie, especially the shooting of the Tea Party ""members"" and the news anchor guy. If you can figure out why I can love this movie so much then congratulation, you are no longer on the top of the hit list for the main characters in this movie.",1346371200,2,3639,4.483383685800605

5111085,1,B007UW9W8W,"This movie advocates the murder of conservatives, the rich, patriotic Americans, FOX celebrities, Mormons, and anyone else Goldthwait thinks the world would be better off without.  Goldthwait is clearly not a deep thinker.  While many of his victims are politically on the right, his main character instead justifies killing them because they are ""mean.""  That is code for ""right wing.""  The Hollywood liberals that Goldthwait is transparently trying to please fancy themselves as caring and rational, and see the right as mean and selfish.  Goldthwait kills off apolitical but entitled and bratty teenagers as well, failing to realize that this entitlement culture is the product of decades of the left's efforts to inculcate value-free thinking.

In order to make the main character seem less of a monster, he is made pathetic by losing his job and having a fatal disease.  (Ironically, he loses his job for unintended sexual harassment - for which we can thank the left.)  The only moral compass he follows is in refusing to kill people ""who don't deserve to die"" (i.e. are polite - I guess crying babies aren't polite) and his refusal to sleep with the teenaged girl.  That's something I suppose.

It is obvious that the majority of viewers find this blood bath liberating.  They say they wish they could do the same.  Their hatred is a product of the leftist Hollywood and public school propaganda.  One wonders if the Aurora shooter was inspired by this movie, which was released only months prior.

Those moments are getting scarce and more impossible to find nowadays. We have been living in new culture shaped by media and television. We are babysit by commercials and reality shows. Our sense of reality is only sharpened by sensations and tragedies. We are no longer moved by simple things. TVs are playing too loud we can barely hear our conscience anymore.

This movie may jolt us back a little, back to what is left with our humanity. But if that's so, why watching an unlikely duo with their trigger-happy vigilante action feels so good?",1346198400,2,688,4.830508474576271

It features an adult man and teenage girl presented as heroic anti-heroes who 'get even' for all the stupidity of some of the rankest pop 'culture' in the USA.  Yep, it's a sewerpipe straight from Hollywood (where else) spewing out murder spree after murder spree under cover of 'critiqueing' the sleaze present in the US culture.  Portrays anyone of a conservative bent a crazy hate-monger and the liberals are presented as idiots for the most part,but as mostly better people than the conservatives.  That's to make sure it doesn't offend the chief audience it will garner.  I really have no quarrel with the latter presentation, but the caricatures are so transperent it's foolish.  Anyhow, it's a good flick for ""male anger ventilation"" in the world of the imagination (possibly women too, but I'm not so sure).  But for anybody under 30 years old (maybe 45, maybe 50) it is a movie that shows the actualization of mass murder perpetrated on innocent citizens like we see happening in the news.  This stuff (these presentations) has/have been going on for years and people wonder ""What's wrong?""  ""Why would anyone do this?"" in reality.  I'll tell you why.  A good example is a Super Bowl commercial.  Why do they cost 50-60 million (or more) for 30 seconds of air time?  That's because television and movies ""really don't have an effect on anyone"" right?  Keep the sewerpipe open and prepare for more of the same in your daily news.  Don't go around wondering why this stuff happens.  It's not weapons or guns, it's Hollywood (or, the ""movies"" if you will).  They glorify the stuff.  Ain't no ifs, ands, or buts, about it.  Pretty good acting by the main guy.  The 'girl' does OK also.  Kinda has a pedophilic undertone at times, but mainly handles the two characters well in that regard.  They both have a certain conscience about some things.....so I hand them kudos for that.  But the rest - The movie should be released as Restricted to Audiences Over 50 Years of Age.  Let the sewerepipe roll on and quit blaming gun people (of which I am not one of) for the actual murders we are seeng in our society and put the blame where it belongs, Hollywood!  Have fun...I did!

Much the same as Drive, the dynamic differences between the ""storytelling"" parts and the action parts is magnificent. I was torn between a 4 and a 5, and would ideally like to call it a 4.5.

""America has become a cruel and vicious place. We reward the shallowest, the dumbest, the meanest and the loudest. We no longer have any common sense or decency. No sense of shame. There is no right and wrong. The worst qualities are looked up to and celebrated. Lying and spreading fear are fine, as long as you make money doing it.""

And he's absolutely right.

In America we have Simon Cowell, Gordon Ramsay, Ann Coulter, Mike Savage, Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity. Without exception every single one of these people have made a fortune from being mean and vicious. And Ann Coulter, Mike Savage and Sean Hannity have also made lying very profitable.

What does it say about our society when somebody as vicious and dishonest as Ann Coulter is invited onto the Today show, Good Morning America, Morning Joe with Joe Scarborough, Fox & Friends and just about any TV show that ever invites guests onto their show?

What does it say about American society when millions of Americans watch ""news"" programs where ""experts"" are invited onto the show to try and paint the President of the United States as a racist, labor unions as criminal organizations and scientists as drooling idiots?

Frank (the main character) is a mild-mannered citizen who can't stand it anymore and he finally snaps. He goes on a killing spree across several states and kills a vicious and dishonest ""news"" anchor, several religious fanatics, multiple members of the tea party, rude people who talk loudly during movies and a spoiled rich blonde girl who terrorizes her parents.

Actually that's an incomplete list, but those were the ones who stood out in my memory the most.

5111127,3,B007UW9W8W,"Comedian/filmmaker Bobcat Goldthwait returns with yet another pitch black comedy, 'God Bless America', in which he proceeds to tear the jaded, superficial culture of today to shreds.

The story follows middle-aged Frank Murdoch (played by Joel Murray, brother of Bill Murray), an all around nice guy and insurance salesman, who has grown weary of the culture in which we live. The insipid, superficial nature of those around him, as well as the shallow attitudes of reality television celebrites, has caused him to become cynical and angry. The fact that his ex-wife and bratty daughter regard him as a loser does not help matters, and his belligerent and loud neighbors are constantly testing his patience. The next day, Frank is fired from his job, and shortly after, his doctor casually informs him that he has a terminal brain tumor. With very little hope for the future, Frank attempts to end his life.

As Frank sits in bed in front of the television contemplating suicide, he catches a glimpse of a `Sweet Sixteen' reality television show, in which a young girl named Chloe spews profanities at her parents for buying her the wrong vehicle for her birthday. You see, Chloe wanted an Escalade, and her parents bought her a Lexus. The audacity of this young woman sets Frank off on a mission - a killing spree to rid the world of rude, insensitive jerks.

The following day, Frank stalks the aforementioned Chloe and shoots her. He flees the scene, but a young woman named Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr) witnesses the crime. She tracks Frank down, talks with him, and discovers that they have similar ideologies regarding their disgust with modern day culture. She convinces Frank to let her join him on his spree, and from there on, the body count continues to rise. It all leads to an explosive finale at an `American Idol' spinoff.

As a satire, the film is quite effective, even if the script is occasionally brought down by rambling monologues that throw the film off balance. That isn't to say that these moments are without value; however, they feel a bit forced and unnecessary. Joel Murray gives a fantastic performance as Joel. This is a character that most of Goldthwait's audience will sympathize with to the very end. The stilted performance of Tara Lynne Barr as Roxy takes some getting used to. Her character can be quite grating at times, and you begin to wonder if the film would be better without her.

Bobcat Goldthwait has evolved as a filmmaker, as he has proven with his previous feature, `World's Greatest Dad'. Aside from the weaknesses with the script, Goldthwait is in top form with `God Bless America', and I, for one, am looking forward to his next project.

5111134,3,B007UW9W8W,"Written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait, God Bless America rails against what he considers to be dumb American culture, blending a little Fallen Down, The Professional and Bonnie and Clyde together. This is coming from the guy who played Zed in the Police Academy series and made a living by screaming on TV, he's now decided to moralize against meaningless reality shows and narcissistic celebrities.

It's slow to get going and although there's a certain grim satisfaction watching him pick off the rude, the movie is a 90 minute rampage connecting shootings with ranting monologues. The relationship with the girl never goes anywhere (and if you've seen Sleeping Dogs Lie, I felt sure something more was going to develop) and the ending is signposted so early on in the film that your enjoyment depends on how much you like to watch annoying people being executed.

So although the message resonates and it's a fairly thoughtful film, it's a one-note plot with some average performances and there's not much meat here to last 90 minutes. It's worth mentioning that following the Colorado shootings, the scene in the movie theaters might be disturbing to some viewers.

I applaud BG's willingness to undertake many taboo subjects and coalesce them into a pulp fiction nuance that is very relevant to the psyche of middle America. The protagonist is everywhere, all inclusive and able bound. Our collective understanding of that profile is not. Bg is sending a warning, as well as an indicator of what may transpire in our midst. The electronic medium will run its course and in doing so, dictate behavior patterns that were established prior....from Latin ""post hoc, ergo procter hoc"", after therefore because of it"" or one thing follows the other, therefore it was caused by the other.""

5111138,4,B007UW9W8W,"However I have ""docked"" this movie one star because I wish that both the lead actors' characters had been explored in equal depth.  I feel that we are really shown the heart of the Frank character but not so much Roxy's.

Which is a shame, because based on the job she did with the character she was given, Tara Lynne Barr would've been capable of defining her character as well as Joel Murray does.  I especially wish we'd seen more (or really any) of what her character's home life was actually like.

As to the larger questions of the movie, of course, there is an inherent irony in presenting the case against rudeness from behind a gun.  I think Goldthwait was well aware of this; I don't know if there's any message to be found here.

But if there is, I certainly don't think it's that Goldthwait thinks anyone with opposite views to his should be shot.  It's closer to the truth, perhaps, that the movie dramatizes a gaping wound in the world today.  It's more a calling for attention to a problem than a suggestion of answers.

In fact, one of the more troubling thoughts the movie leaves with you is that there may *be* no answers:  The world's just gonna keep getting dumber.

Which leads me to an even *more* troubling idea.  Goldthwait has said that one of his models for the script was the film Network, which upon its release was seen as satire:  Surely no TV executives could really be *that* cynical, surely people didn't want to be on TV *that* much, surely the profit motive isn't the *only* motive.

Some 35 years later, we realize that the sort of thing which must have seemed repellent then, is now enjoyed by millions of families several times a week.  It's a world where ""reality"" shows are seen as an acceptable activity for recent Vice-presidential nominees, and girls are celebrated for how much liposuction they've had.

My point is:  What if, 35 years from now, the problems at which Goldthwait ""takes aim"" in this movie...sorry...are thought of as ""quaint,"" with sweet nostalgia?  If that happens, there may be part of me (assuming I survive) that wishes Frank and Roxy had one more ""call to arms.""

Not literally, of course.",1344902400,3,2154,4.606299212598425
5111139,4,B007UW9W8W,"I never thought the oddball comic, Bobcat Goldthwait, would turn out to be such an accomplished writer/director. The several movies of his I've seen have been good and this is no exception.

Here's the scoop. Frank is kind of a schlub. He's divorced and lives in an unremarkable apartment. His young daughter is spoiled and wants nothing to with him. He loses his job, at an insurance company, for a misinterpreted act of kindness and he's diagnosed with a brain tumor to boot. He's angry at the path America has taken with it's reality shows, religious right and general mean-spiritedness and goes on a killing spree, with a like-minded young lady, to do in all the types that tick him/them off.

Goldthwait wrote this script and he's angry. He makes a lot of good points and I can't say I disagree with him on most of them. He made a smart decision in making his protagonist an articulate guy who sticks by his morals (aside from the killing thing), and is consistent. For instance: His young, female protege is rather fetching but he keeps business as business and maintains a platonic relationship with her.

There are some lapses in logic throughout, but overall this is very good. I'm not used to seeing Joel Murray as the Alpha Male in a movie but he makes a good everyman here. Tara Lynne Barr makes for a perky sidekick. The story moves logically and the end is fitting. A normal person can't advocate the killing of others for the reasons given here. But, as our hero says ""I'm no longer a normal person."" This is a heck of a watch. Enjoy.",1344729600,,1549,4.5647482014388485
5111140,2,B007UW9W8W,"Movies like FALLING DOWN or to some degree OFFICE SPACE are fun because they feature folks rebelling against the mundane stupidities of life in ways we CAN'T in ""real life.""  We wish these surrogates well as we watch them, because they are taking action against the anger we experience when McDonald's stops service breakfast 14 seconds after you get to the counter to order, even though you've been waiting in line for 3 minutes.  Or when bosses demand that darn TPS report!

GOD BLESS AMERICA, in its trailers, promised to be in a similar ilk, only more violent and black.  Certainly there is a lot more violence and bloodshed. I was expecting a guilty-pleasure catharsis.  I was going to chastise myself for enjoying watching horrific reality show divas getting killed or maybe some folks to talk on their cell phones during movies.  I mean, don't we ALL hate that.  Sure, I would have felt bad for enjoying the fantasy, because enjoyment would imply some level of agreement.  I was prepared to live with that!

But writer/director Bobcat Goldthwaite made a couple of key miscalculations.  First and foremost, he veers too much from targets we can all agree with (rude neighbors, gossip mongering TMZ hosts, people who double park on purpose) to political targets.  The main character in the movie, Frank, starts out wanting to get rid of rude people or those who aren't ""nice.""  Yet much of his ire is focused on conservative talk show hosts and the Tea Party.  The film does more than imply that most of the rudeness and decline in civilized discourse in our country is due to ""the right wing"", as though Chris Matthews or Keith Olbermann were the most civil folks on TV.  It equates those hate-mongering crazies who demonstrate at soldiers' funerals about God hating gays with everyday Tea Party members, who assemble peacefully.  WHY drag cheap & incorrect political targets into this when there are so many non-partisan jerks in the world that we can all agree on wiping out?

At the beginning of the film we spend A LOT of time getting to see Frank (an actually pretty terrific Joel Murray) sink into the despair that leads him to kill (rather than his first temptation, suicide).  He gets fired for no good reason and then is diagnosed with a fatal brain tumor.  He figures he should clean up some of America's mess first and (without spoiling anything) ends up partnering with a precocious and VERY rude & angry teenage girl named Roxy.  (I call her ""very rude"" because she really seems like someone Frank might actually want to target not befriend.)

Also, even if the politics don't bother you, it's likely the fact that the violence, while bloody when it occurs, is actually pretty infrequent.  From the needlessly long build-up to the extended scenes of the two partners chatting (some of the scenes are good, others are repetitive)...GOD BLESS AMERICA frequently drags quite badly.

There are some amusing moments and one that made me laugh outloud, involving an effort to light the gas tank of a car.  The music selections, including lots of Alice Cooper and a GREAT Kinks song, are good.  And Joel Murray certainly showed that he needs a good, big role to chew into.

But the poor pacing, needless stereotyping of 50% of America and a terrible ending weight down the kernels of goodness in this film, and I cannot recommend it.",1344643200,4,3345,4.785714285714286
5111141,4,B007UW9W8W,"Why bad timing? Well let's get the plot discussed first and move on to that. Frank (Joel Murray) is having the worst time ever. His neighbors are the worst ever, constantly fighting until the wee hours of the night with a baby that won't stop crying. Frank watches TV to deaden the sound but the things he sees there are so terrible it doesn't help, everything from being able to buy farting pig ring tones to reality shows where terrible women toss used tampons at one another in anger. When he sees a singing competition show (only someone living in a cave won't recognize the jab here), he sees everyone on the show making fun of a contestant who has no idea just how terrible he sounds. But it gets worse.

Frank goes to work where co-workers seem like the rest of the world, eager to make fun of people and talk trash thinking that's entertainment, discussing the loser on the singing program non-stop. When he tries to tell a co-worker how terrible it is that people seem to have nothing better to do than be uncivil to one another he's called to the office to discover he's being fired. His transgression was that he sent flowers to the receptionist because she told him she was having a bad day. In today's world this constitutes sexual harassment. To cap off his day, Frank goes to his doctor to find out he has an inoperable brain tumor.

Going home with the intent of killing himself, Frank once more turns on TV only to witness a reality show where a rich spoiled brat complains about everything going so far as to curse out her parents for buying her the wrong car for her birthday. Frank has had enough. He goes to the town where the girl lives and watches her until he has the chance and then kills her. A young girl witnesses the killing and tells him he's fantastic for doing so. A twist leads the girl to join Frank and off they go on a road trip where they discuss and sometimes kill those who are uncivil to everyone else.

I know, it sounds twisted and a bit rough. But then again keep in mind this is a dark comedy from director/writer Bobcat Goldthwait who has made some seriously dark comedies in the past as well. At least one moment will place this movie in the category of pitch black dark comedy. Amazingly enough for the violence in the film the truth is the concept behind it IS that the world has become uncivil and he's trying to point that out. The shows on TV celebrate how nasty we can be to one another. Pop-tart stars seem to be the focus of everyone's life these days, who they slept with, where they go, what they wear and more. I mean can anyone honestly tell me why we have more than one series on TV talking about a Kardashian? What did they accomplish or do that deserved a TV series?

If you can get past the violence (and especially something that even I think was over the top in the first 10 minutes of the movie) then you'll find some seriously funny stuff here. The movie hits the mark in the idea of what it is trying to discuss and satirize. Popular culture has taken a turn for the worse in the past decade or so. Discussions on serious topics have gone to the wayside leaving us talking about nonsensical things. We now praise that which we used to scorn. And this movie shows us that.

So why is it bad timing? The first reason is the violence, the choice of the main characters to use guns to solve their problems. More and more every day people are actually doing this in real life. Within weeks prior to this film coming out on DVD there have been several shootings where individuals have gone off the deep end killing groups of people. But rather than blame that person, we still look to find something to blame it on.

Secondly is a sequence in the film that seems as if Bobcat saw it coming. While watching a documentary in a theater, Frank and Roxy deal with punk kids who toss popcorn at them and continue to use their cell phone and talk while the movie is on. Eventually (and this isn't a spoiler since it was in the trailer), Frank turns around and shoots each offender. While many of us have had to deal with inconsiderate patrons at theaters often, the recent shooting in Aurora make this sequence seem a little eerie. While it might have been something to laugh at over a month ago, now it just seems too real.

The often say that art imitates life and in this case it does indeed. The movie is actually quite good and says a lot of things that many people feel is true. The violence will turn off some, especially since there is humor tied to it. But that's always been the case with dark comedy. Thirty seven years ago (has it really been that long?) it was Monty Python lopping off the arms and legs of the Black Knight. Times change and things get increasingly more intense. If you can overlook that and realize that this is a comedy then you're in for a treat. If you're too sensitive then look for another film. This movie is one of the better films I've seen this past year. I would say it's too bad about the timing of the release but instead I'll say it's too bad that someone would actually take things to this extreme in real life.",1344470400,,5110,4.338912133891213

5111146,4,B007UW9W8W,"I believe the main character, Frank, is someone that many people can relate to in today's America.  I feel that many of us are disgruntled by the way things are going in this country, and this movie feeds on that.  It serves as a depiction about the blatant mindlessness and the narcissistic ideals that seem to move us and capture our imaginations as a society.  Great premise, a very different movie in that aspect.  Every part of Frank's life seems to be going from bad to worse, and he decides to take on all the things he finds wrong head on......  In a very violent way.  Frank becomes an anti-hero whom one can't seem to hate nor shed all sympathy for.

But then it starts pushing a political agenda.  Mainly Roxy's ""bleeding heart"", teenage girl agenda, that is often removed from reality.  It is a confusing mishmash of real grievances and wanting to go on a murder spree because she finds some people's mannerisms annoying.  Granted, I wasn't expecting a very deep message with this movie, but it holds so many underlying real life problems that we are surrounded with every day, and thus I was hoping it could bring about a better motives for shooting sprees than for example, ""people who misuse the word 'literally'"".

I did enjoy the movie quite a bit, but you can expect to be offended by many of the views.  It is a clear swipe at trashy VH1 and MTV shows, American Idol and FOX News, while somehow implying that it is wrong to scrutinize the President of the United States.

5111147,4,B007UW9W8W,"Bobcat nails it with his commentary on America today. We live in a narcissistic, arrogant, and selfish country where people are lauded for their fake boobs and their hair extensions, but mocked for reading books and getting good grades. It also, to me, kind of explains what may be going on the minds of rage killers. It is a sort of psychological profile of the death of a man's rational being.

He shows a typical American man (not unlike your husband or father) whose life has not turned out the way he planned, but keeps trying to do right. The most poignant point is when he gets fired. Wow! Without revealing too much, I can truly say he was fired for doing something so innocent and kind that most of us have done! The frightening thing is that people really get fired for the same thing. Bobcat shows how far gone our society has come, and still going.

I loved the actors. Joel Murray is brilliant and loveable to the very end. Strange, but true, because his character is a murderer. Tara Lynn Barr is over the top hilarious, even for a stone cold killer. They work wonderfully together. I know, strange, but true.

I agree a lot with most of what Frank says throughout the movie.  There is some particularly good dialogue regarding the way people treat each other and the absence of civility in our civilization.  It's fairly predictable, though a couple of plot twists are unexpected and fun.  The acting is solid and the directing and editing kept my interest.  The opening sequence was just a little over the top for me, and I recommend skipping the first five minutes if you're a parent and sensitive.

Frank is divorced with a rude ex-wife and even ruder daughter who has a fit because she gets a blackberry instead of an iPhone.  Frank has a thankless job with coworkers who consider him a snob because he isn't fascinated with ignorant, rude pop culture.

If someone just made a movie and said in a soft, timid voice how people are so mean and gee I wish it would stop...who would watch that or think twice about it?

Again, I have to see another movie that can't think of anything new? Just ""kill conservatives, that'll make the world better"". It gets old. However, I also just got bored with it.  I didn't know where they were going with  the story. How could these two, after being shown on the news, driving around in a banana boat of a car, not be noticed by police or anyone else?

I knew I shouldn't take the movie too seriously when I rented it, but this was just asking me to  go way too far out.

It was a great father/son bonding moment--as he doesn't always realize that we are closer than he thinks.  People who hated God Bless America might try taking life more seriously and this movie less seriously.

This movie is not for everyone.  If you're easily offended, if you're wrapped up in being politicaly correct, or if you think reality television is awesome, then skip this movie.  But if today's shock culture and the desire of so many to get their 15 minutes of fame just bugs the living crap out of you, get this movie, and get it now.

I'm not condoning any of the actions taken by any of the characters in this film, but I fully stand behind their reasons for it.  Frank's reasoning of, ""why have a civilization if no one is interested in being civilized"", sums it up exactly.",1341619200,,836,4.3896103896103895

5111165,4,B007UW9W8W,"During the second time I watched ""God Bless America"" this year, somebody in the place I was viewing it was offended, and requested me to turn it off. This person was not watching it, but heard some of the dialogue streaming in from the other room. The dialogue itself wasn't nasty, or disgusting in any way. Rather, it was the protagonist's terse tirade on everything that he felt is wrong with today's society, name-dropping different types of television and radio. Now, out of respect for this person, who is a friend, I turned off the film. It is then that I realized that Bobcat Goldthwait has created a truly divisive movie, one that digs a knife into the jugular of American society and proceeds to twist it. In doing this, he has crafted one of the most intelligent pieces of social satire you're ever going to see.

Everything kicks off on what may be the worst day of Frank Murdoch's life. He is fired from his job of eleven years for a false charge of sexual harassment, he's diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, and his bratty daughter has no interest in seeing him after his divorce. Piled on top of his general discontent with society at large, and his deep-seated hatred of how mean America has become, it pushes him over the edge. He almost offs himself, but before he commits the act, he sees a spoiled 16 year-old on a reality show making the life of everybody around her a living hell. He hunts her down and kills her, but is caught in the act by a fellow student of the girl named Roxy. Instead of turning him in, she sees the validity in his action, and persuades him to let her team up to begin a crusade of taking down every demographic they think deserve to die.

While this movie is indeed a bloodbath, it is also a sharp commentary on society at large. Juxtaposing the tight action sequences are lengthy dialogues and monologues that both question and lambaste American culture. The focus is primarily on how mean people have become, and how today's entertainment is reliant on the harm and humiliation of people. It extols this message while at the same time being an incredibly mean and relentless picture, one that will definitely upset more than a few people. Some may view this as hypocritical, but after seeing Goldthwait's excellent 2009 film ""World's Greatest Dad"", I can't believe that he would overlook such a simple hypocrisy. In my opinion, he uses violence and cruelty to get across a message that even pacifists can be pushed to a breaking point. It imagines an instance where a demographic who generally protests with their brains instead takes to the streets and starts annihilating everybody they disagree with. It is a warning message, one that firmly speaks against intolerance and demands change. I did not agree with everything Frank and Roxy thought, but instead looked at their actions objectively. By doing this, the movie took on a whole new light, especially the second time through.

Joel Murray is great as Frank, with a wry tone and earnest goal that quickly escalates into something more than he ever prepared for. His performance reminded me very much of James McCaffrey's in the ""Max Payne"" video games, right down to the pitch of his voice and demeanor. But the scene stealer in this picture is undoubtedly Tara Lynne Barr as Roxy. Everything about her performance is absolutely flawless, taking the ""hipster Lolita crossed with cynical murderer"" character and running with it. She is quick, funny and, most importantly, convincing. When she speaks, it's with a false sense of intelligence and confidence that is underscored by bitter pathos and sadness that might not have even been intentional. This is the type of performance that true stars break out from, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see more from this incredibly talented young lady in the coming years.

""God Bless America"" is funny, engaging, and thrilling all at once, and not particularly in that order. It had me thinking about it ages after I saw it in theaters, and it was even better when I watched it for the second time over the weekend. It takes the satire that Mike Judge's ""Idiocracy"" was going for and hones it into something more poignant and brutal, like ""Postal"" but with a brain. It will not win any awards, for it is far too divisive and harsh for most audiences. While the comedy of the situation subsides within the first half of the film, and the characters sometimes act as figureheads for the director himself instead of being fleshed out a little more, it is still an excellent timr, and worth adding to your collection.

In a way, the abruptness of the ending left you as distant from the rest of the persons in the world as the characters felt while on the road.",1340755200,3,381,4.536231884057971
5111167,4,B007UW9W8W,"This is the third film I've seen by Bobcat Golthwait (after ""Sleeping Dogs Lie"" and ""World's Greatest Dad""), and he's really emerged as an interesting filmmaker. So far, all his films seem to have a similar formula: take an outrageous premise, and then use it to explore the human condition in surprisingly nuanced ways.

Frank (Joel Murray, in a sensitive leading performance) has had it. His cold ex-wife has left him for a younger man, and is spoiling their bratty daughter. He's fired from him job for sexual harassment, when all he did was send flowers to a co-worker to cheer her up. And finally, his horrifically indifferent doctor diagnoses him with a terminal brain tumor. Frank is also disgusted with current American culture. He sits in his living room, flipping channels, and is horrified by how dumbed down and mean-spirited everything is. Finally, while watching a show that features a monstrous, entitled girl planning a garish Sweet 16 party, Frank snaps, and decides to track the girl down and murder her.

While committing the murder, Frank meets teenage Roxy, who is thrilled and impressed by the execution. Roxy tracks Frank down at this motel room, right before his planned suicide, and encourages him to turn the incident from a final act of rage to the beginning of a murder spree meant to rid the world of the worst of society. Despite their age difference, Frank and Roxy bond. They're both angry, lonely and disturbed. Their relationship explores the similarities between adolescent disillusionment and middle-aged disillusionment, and discovers they're really not so different. Roxy approaches their crime spree with more excitement and enthusiasm, perhaps, than world-weary Frank, who approaches the whole thing from the perspective of a has-been who has nothing left to lose. But really, they're kindred spirits.

The two then go on a quest to rid society of many of its biggest cultural tumors, and various characters serve as stand-ins for real life institutions such as American Idol, Fox News, and the Westboro Baptist Church. Frank and Roxy also occasionally execute everyday people who are just plain rude and nasty, including people who talk on the phone in the movie theatre, or people who take up two spaces with their car.

It's all very entertaining and darkly funny. Yet often throughout the film, when Frank is glued to the TV in disgust, I find myself asking a question: why can't he just turn it off? Instead of all his reactive ranting, why can't he just go for a hike, or read a book, or listen to an album by someone who actually has talent? So as much as the film justifiably criticizes much of the cultural wasteland, it doesn't let the viewer off the hook either. Why do we continue to watch awful TV shows and movies, listen to awful music, and give attention to vapid, narcissistic people? Why don't we only support artists and products that are worth supporting? And if we're finding our culture has become petty and cruel, why don't we counteract it by treating the people around us with kindness and respect?",1339977600,2,3063,4.9073359073359075
5111168,2,B007UW9W8W,"After watching trailers for this movie, I was really hyped up to enjoy it. Who wouldn't want to watch a movie that gives the ol' bird to the US o' A. Well, when this movie revolves around a dated reality singing show that's been on for 7+ seasons, it's hard to even take this movie seriously anymore. Sure, the title, trailers, etc., make it seem like a comedy, but there was some real hope for a serious discussion on the pitfalls of American society.

What irritates me the most about this movie is Frank's monologues. They're extremely boring and re-hashed at least 3 times throughout the movie. Roxy joining in the diatribes doesn't help as she follows his same patterns.

There are some good moments. Just the scene where he attacks the reality show star in her car was really well done. Perhaps if this movie came out about 5 years ago, it would have been more relevant.

5111170,4,B007UW9W8W,"Joel Murray is Frank, a poor soul who is constantly annoyed by his next door neighbors, his co-workers, television programming, his ex-wife and daughter and the world in general.  People are just mean and stupid.  After he gets fired from his job for sexual harassment (he sent flowers to a co-worker's house), he gets notice from his doctor that he has a brain tumor.

Frank is particularly annoyed by reality TV shows (I hear ya' Frank) and decides to go looking for the high school girl on TV that makes a big scene based on her parent's birthday present.  She got a Lexus sedan instead of the Escalade she wanted.  He stalks her at school and takes her out.  This is witnessed by another high school girl named Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr) who applauds Frank's actions and suggests she come along for further liquidations of people who ""deserve to die.""

While this could get pervy real quick with 50 something Frank taking up with a cute teen outcast, director and writer Bobcat Goldthwait never goes in that direction.  He just allows the pair to kill annoying people.  You know, people who talk or use cell phones in movie theaters, people who hog parking spaces.  He is also upset with mean right wing talk show hosts, religious zealots and ""American Idol"" type shows.

5111178,5,B007UW9W8W,"""God Bless America"" is good, but for a reason many people will either find strange or disagree with entirely: It's a movie that needs to be there.

As some other reviewers have noted, ""God Bless America"" is more of a rant than a movie, but the ranting is the reason for the movie to exist. It's a statement embedded in good acting and pretty cinematography.

 It features a plotline that is by no means wholly believeable (that never stopped anyone from making an episode of The Mentalist) and it is nothing *like* entirely pleasant (that never stopped anyone from watching an episode of The Mentalist) in which two alienated loners, a divorced middle-aged man and a too-clever teenaged girl, find one another and go on a killing spree that features representations from a rogue's gallery of American incivlity and mental degeneration; one that includes, among others, a Glenn Beck clone, a ""God-hates-gays"" preacher and a large sampling of the superficial, the cruel, the entitled and the merely rude.

It is a rant wrapped in a thin layer of movie that displays a very linnear, paint-by-the-numbers plot, the point of which makes the movie almost like something Brecht might have written were he alive today. Goldthwaite's story and how he tells it, like Brecht's, pushes the viewer back far enough to see the point: that we are so bombarded by multimillionaire media personalities vomiting nonsense, dwarf-tossers, infinitely entitled celebrities and the people who have given us the worst of YouTube, that our world is riddled by a media-fueled cancer of noise in which each tumor of diseased culture is replaced by the next one so quickly that horrible events driven by horrible people have become our norm and we cease to notice the presence of the disease, that things were ever otherwise,  or to imagine that anything else is possible.

""God Bless America"" is a black comedy that at times is not entirely funny, but that is nevertheless worth watching for its point.

5111185,2,B007UW9W8W,"I really wanted to like this movie. I loved Goldthwait's last film -- World's Greatest Dad -- a scathing critique of contemporary culture as well as parenthood and what it takes to get noticed (let alone loved). I also loved the trailer for GOD BLESS AMERICA. If you haven't seen it, it neatly encapsulates what the film is about, but also gives it a high-speed, pitch-perfect tone. Estranged from his young daughter and ex-wife, fired from his work on a ridiculous technicality, and beset on all sides by the loud, crass, obnoxious death rattle of American Culture, gravelly-voiced Frank finally snaps when a callous doctor informs him that he has an inoperable brain tumor. He decides to spend his remaining time on Earth cleaning house, and thus begins a cross-country murder spree, with Frank gunning down everyone from rude theater audiences to double-parkers, as well as some big dogs, such as an inflammatory Bill O'Reilly clone and the cast and fans of American Superstar (an American Idol spoof).

Anyone with half a brainwave will have some sympathy for Frank, if not a hidden desire to see his vengeance take some shape. The trailer really milks this and milks it well. The movie ... not so much.

It is almost as if Goldthwait came up with the idea for the trailer first. What works about the film -- Frank's descent into madness -- is mostly tip-toed around. Great pains are taken to show us that Frank is, at heart, a decent guy, and the movie does everything in its power to paint him as sympathetically as possible. The world Frank lives in is a nightmare full of loud morons and entitled screaming, and when Frank finally rants against it, his speech is perfectly articulated, obviously rehearsed, and just as obnoxious, in its way, as the Me-Me-Me culture it rails against.

For a movie about a serial killer, the film moves sluggishly. In between Frank's self-righteous monologues, there are very long shots of Frank driving or sitting in his car, always accompanied by loud rock music with lyrics that pretty much spell out the emotions you're supposed to be seeing in Frank. The self-righteous monologues get even more intolerable when Frank is joined in his quest by the young Roxy, a Juno-esque character who gets an entire scene where she rails against the movie JUNO and explains in great detail her love of Alice Cooper. Roxy hardly feels real at all. It is as if Goldthwait created two avatars for his personality: the half that is sad (Frank) and the half that is angry (Roxy). Roxy pushes Frank's quest to ever greater extremes, but her motivation in the film never makes any sense, and she seems more like the devil on Frank's shoulder than the cool, witty, anti-establishment teen she's supposed to be.

The movie fails most of all because it waters-down its own satire. If these characters were not presented so apologetically or with such slick soliloquies, if they were presented even just fractionally as a part of the problem, then the movie would have a story, characters, and a message worth thinking about. Frank occasionally has chances to move the story into areas more fraught with questions, complications, and intrigue -- his ex's new hubby is a cop, Roxy is just as obsessed with the media as the people she's always complaining about, Frank's own daughter is slowly turning into the same type of person he starts his murder spree with -- but just as you think the film is setting Frank up to face some serious questions, it veers back into music video wish fulfillment.

Goldthwait made this film for one reason: he wanted to put onto a screen the stuff he probably spends a great deal of time thinking to himself. The reason why Alice Cooper is a rock god. Just exactly what's wrong with Americans and American culture these days. All of the people who deserve to die violent deaths -- most of whom, by the way, are conservative, Fox News types. Instead of using this opportunity to show all the ways the world is screwed up -- not just from the ""pop politics"" (both right and left), but also from the people who rage against the rage, who scream about the screaming, and who hate all of the hate -- this movie sticks with one note, and it doesn't even play it very well or consistently.

I loved Goldthwait's last film --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-s-Greatest-Dad/dp/B002PI1NRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World's Greatest Dad</a>&nbsp;-- a scathing critique of contemporary culture as well as parenthood and what it takes to get noticed (let alone loved). I also loved the trailer for GOD BLESS AMERICA. If you haven't seen it, it neatly encapsulates what the film is about, but also gives it a high-speed, pitch-perfect tone. Estranged from his young daughter and ex-wife, fired from his work on a ridiculous technicality, and beset on all sides by the loud, crass, obnoxious death rattle of American Culture, gravelly-voiced Frank finally snaps when a callous doctor informs him that he has an inoperable brain tumor. He decides to spend his remaining time on Earth cleaning house, and thus begins a cross-country murder spree, with Frank gunning down everyone from rude theater audiences to double-parkers, as well as some big dogs, such as an inflammatory Bill O'Reilly clone and the cast and fans of American Superstar (an American Idol spoof).

Anyone with half a brainwave will have some sympathy for Frank, if not a hidden desire to see his vengeance take some shape. The trailer really milks this and milks it well. The movie ... not so much.

It is almost as if Goldthwait came up with the idea for the trailer first. What works about the film -- Frank's descent into madness -- is mostly tip-toed around. Great pains are taken to show us that Frank is, at heart, a decent guy, and the movie does everything in its power to paint him as sympathetically as possible. The world Frank lives in is a nightmare full of loud morons and entitled screaming, and when Frank finally rants against it, his speech is perfectly articulated, obviously rehearsed, and just as obnoxious, in its way, as the Me-Me-Me culture it rails against.

For a movie about a serial killer, the film moves sluggishly. In between Frank's self-righteous monologues, there are very long shots of Frank driving or sitting in his car, always accompanied by loud rock music with lyrics that pretty much spell out the emotions you're supposed to be seeing in Frank. The self-righteous monologues get even more intolerable when Frank is joined in his quest by the young Roxy, a Juno-esque character who gets an entire scene where she rails against the movie JUNO and explains in great detail her love of Alice Cooper. Roxy hardly feels real at all. It is as if Goldthwait created two avatars for his personality: the half that is sad (Frank) and the half that is angry (Roxy). Roxy pushes Frank's quest to ever greater extremes, but her motivation in the film never makes any sense, and she seems more like the devil on Frank's shoulder than the cool, witty, anti-establishment teen she's supposed to be.

The movie fails most of all because it waters-down its own satire. If these characters were not presented so apologetically or with such slick soliloquies, if they were presented even just fractionally as a part of the problem, then the movie would have a story, characters, and a message worth thinking about. Frank occasionally has chances to move the story into areas more fraught with questions, complications, and intrigue -- his ex's new hubby is a cop, Roxy is just as obsessed with the media as the people she's always complaining about, Frank's own daughter is slowly turning into the same type of person he starts his murder spree with -- but just as you think the film is setting Frank up to face some serious questions, it veers back into music video wish fulfillment.

Goldthwait made this film for one reason: he wanted to put onto a screen the stuff he probably spends a great deal of time thinking to himself. The reason why Alice Cooper is a rock god. Just exactly what's wrong with Americans and American culture these days. All of the people who deserve to die violent deaths -- most of whom, by the way, are conservative, Fox News types. Instead of using this opportunity to show all the ways the world is screwed up -- not just from the ""pop politics"" (both right and left), but also from the people who rage against the rage, who scream about the screaming, and who hate all of the hate -- this movie sticks with one note, and it doesn't even play it very well or consistently.

Watch the trailer, close your eyes, and picture all the people YOU think deserve to die. You'll have a better time than if you watch this film.",1337212800,11,4525,4.885416666666667

5111191,1,B007UW9W8W,"Worst movie I've seen in years, kept waiting for something funny to happen. Terrible acting from the Magic Pixie Dream Girl that rips on Ellen Page while trying her hardest to emulate her.

The first act (prior to the arrival of Ju-wannabe) had a bit of potential, but Frank's monologues were tired and uninspiring. His problem with everyone was that they were so rude, so uncaring, and yet his answer was to murder them.

Oh, he's got a kid? That might be an interesting story line. Perhaps some form of redemption for her? Nope.

Oh, his ex-wife's new man is a police officer? That should be mighty interesting in a movie about a murder spree! Oh wait, nothing comes of it. (Also, he doesn't kill him because he ""wants him to suffer?"" He's a nice guy. He's nice to Frank, he's nice to his wife, he's wonderful to Frank's daughter. He should be happy as a pig in poop that a man like that will be there for his child after he gets caught/the tumor kills him.)

Oh yeah-- the tumor! It was the thing that tipped Frank over the edge, but whoops, the completely unbelievable fake wenis of a doctor that's worried about being sued (and saying things that no one worried about being sued would say), made a mistake. No cancer. The headaches? Just the headaches of a fat old sadsack with a crummy life.

WBC gets run over. Great. Too bad they don't protest unless there are cameras around, so I'm guessing the bright yellow stolen Camaro would have been pulled over pretty quickly.

Frank worked for a bank for 11 years and got canned because of a technicality. Then he goes on a shooting rampage. And doesn't kill anyone at his workplace.

Hey Frank, the people next door to you suck so much, huh? Well then why are they driving nicer cars than you, why haven't their wives left them, and why do they still have their kids? Maybe you should knock on the door and ask if the young couple would like a night without the kid, or if you're not willing to do that, move your GD bedroom away from the wall that their TV is on.

Also, he's got a bomb at the end and decides to shoot people instead? Huh? Where'd he get the bomb? Who on earth was the ""arms dealer""? Why can't he tell a young girl she's pretty? Does he think admitting that someone is beautiful is the same as raping her? Only someone with serious hangups and troubling thoughts would think you can't tell a child they're pretty. The Venus de Milo is pretty but I don't want to bang it.

There was no suspense, there was no comedy. (Okay, the scene where he lights the gas tank of the Lexus on fire only to have the rag blow out was pretty funny.) I wish I had pirated it, because then I wouldn't have anything to be disappointed about, but that was one worthless movie and I want my money back.

5111195,4,B007UW9W8W,"Bobcat Goldthwait turned R-rated comedies inside out with ""World's Greatest Dad"". It was so dark and funny and wrong. You even got to see the kid from ""Spy Kids"" (Daryl Sabara) be a total pervert and take on autoerotic asphyxiation. It was like you almost felt guilty for liking something so twisted. That dark comedy made me a fan of Mr. Goldthwait's for life. I even marked out when he was on a recent episode of ""Adventure Time"". Three years later and Bobcat has another dark, twisted comedy up his sleeve. ""God Bless America"" begins with a baby being shot point blank with a shotgun in its opening moments and you just know Bobcat has returned to deliver another cinematic journey that's just as unsettling and hilarious as his previous effort.

Frank (Joel Murray) suffers from chronic migraines. He's utterly disgusted with what the world and even what humanity has evolved into. His daughter is a spoiled brat, his ex-wife refuses to take responsibility for anything, and he loses his job when a few acts of human decency on his part are mistaken as sexual harassment. When he goes to the doctor, he's diagnosed with a brain tumor and isn't given long to live. He contemplates suicide and even gets as far as putting the gun into his mouth, but instead decides to take his frustrations out on the stupidity and downright vicious behavior that currently plagues the world. His strange behavior and cruel intentions attract the 16-year old Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr), who not only supports Frank's cause but wants to help him achieve it.

""God Bless America"" is a bit different than ""World's Greatest Dad"". ""World's Greatest Dad"" had this father/son relationship at its core and while it wasn't exactly the most normal relationship, it was more intimate in comparison to ""God Bless America"". ""God Bless America"" has a bigger message. It takes aim at our entire generation and is mostly spot-on about everything it has to say. It just so happens to be things people either don't want to hear or are too afraid to actually say. If anything, ""God Bless America"" has the biggest balls of any movie so far in 2012.

The 9/11 bumper sticker, American Superstarz phenomenon, rude people talking or using their cell phone doing a movie, and famous individuals swerving the population's opinion about something even though they know nothing about it are just a few things ""God Bless America"" puts in its crosshairs. The truth of the matter is that if you don't relate to absolutely everything Frank or Roxy have to say, then you'll find at least one message in the film worth applauding. Does that mean people are going to pick up an AK-47 tomorrow after seeing this movie and annihilate rude people they think will be for the greater good? Probably not, but deep down if you're reading this then that thought has probably crossed your mind at some point.

""God Bless America"" is most reminiscent of ""Super"" and even though Frank and Roxy's friendship is never taken to the level that Frank (Rainn Wilson) and Libby's (Ellen Page) gets to, the two dark comedies are more similar than you may think; both contain twisted subject matter, both Franks take matters into their own hands after something drastic happens to them, and the older man/younger girl relationship are just a few examples.

""God Bless America"" is a really sensational comedy that not everyone is going to enjoy. It jumps over boundaries that many expect should never even think of being crossed. While it may appear cynical and pessimistic, it's actually very intelligent and makes several fantastic observations about how the world currently works. One of the key points Frank makes in the movie is ""Why have a civilization if we're no longer interested in being civilized?"" In between its destructive mayhem, raunchy vulgarity, and sadistic violence, ""God Bless America"" makes you think, which is the only thing a memorable movie should be asked of being capable of.",1336694400,9,3929,4.866965620328849

As a fan of ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""Idiocracy,"" and ""Falling Down,"" I was pleased that another of these films were being made, but I'm not entirely pleased with the outcome of ""God Bless America.""  The story is simple and at times, a bit far-fetched and convenient to the plight of the main character.  He knows that the things he hates are all around him, yet he refuses to change anything about his living condition, entertainment options, or his job.  He feels the only thing he can do is drink and commit suicide...or is it?  His sidekick in frustration, a 16-year-old, antisocial girl who looks like a younger Christina Ricci, is OK, but her love for all things to be obliterated gets really old.  I kind of wish he would have taken his own life because there really is no point in killing off a handful of people who don't subscribe to his version of being civilized.  It was good seeing cameos by Mo Gaffney, Larry Miller, and Tom Kenney, all comics who probably met director Bobcat Goldthwait back in his prime comedy years.  I hated the diatribe about Alice Cooper, but I loved the gag about the flaming rag falling out of the girl's gas tank (which the lead was trying to blow up).  The lead made me think of Phillip Seymour Hoffman in ""Happiness,"" which is a good, creepy-guy role to play, in my opinion.

If you like movies about vigilantes who take out their agressions against the blind American society, this movie's for you, but it's pretty simple, and some of it feels forced and pretentious.  The inclusion of numerous modern targets makes it feel like an immediately dated film, even for the current year.  I grew up seeing Bobcat on TV, so it just felt good to contribute to his current project by renting this movie through Video On Demand.

8522057,5,B007UW9W8W,I love this movie more than anything lately its not crap and NO ONE FALLS IN LOVE! I hate when people fall in love in movies that have nothing to do with romance this is a dark comedy not falling in love crap; even in horrors they do that and it gets on my last nerve. So expect it to be funny cause it cheers me up except the end but obviously it going to get them at the end my heroes no more :(,1529625600,,397,3.6823529411764704

8522061,2,B007UW9W8W,"I recently re-watched this movie, having first seen it a couple of years ago. I must say that I am a bit less impressed watching it the second time around. While this film was obviously made on a shoestring budget, the acting and directing were both engaging and eye catching. The dialogue between the two main characters was extremely well done and deadpan comedy timing was excellent at times.

Where the film really let me down was with the overall screenplay. It is contradictory in so many ways as to make your head spin if you actually sit down and think about it. While the main characters ramble on endlessly about the ills of our society and those of us who are a part of it, what is their brilliant strategy for making things right? Going out and shooting people who are mildly annoying. The film beats a dead horse with just about every kind of cliche you can imagine, but the characters acting as judges in the movie are not only no better than the people they are complaining about, they are even worse examples of society than the rest of us.

In the end, the two main characters just come off as hypocrites who throw away their lives (and the lives of others) for absolutely no purpose whatsoever. There is really no lesson to be taught by this movie other than perhaps, if you can't beat them, join them. Hardly the deep societal message that the film holds itself out to be. While there are some great lines and acting in this movie, it ends up becoming nothing more than the cheap, exploitive entertainment that it claims to condemn.",1524009600,,1551,4.516014234875445

It's the kind of movie that had potential when written but there were soooo many lulls and scenes that just went on FOREVER, that by the middle of the movie, I was wishing someone would shoot ME!

Great acting but the script itself is terrible.",1516060800,,258,4.354166666666667
