8081138,5,B000AZ78ZU,Hi to all true Sir Elton John fans. This is a must see for sure to see the true facts of sir Elton And Burne Toben. along with other singers and song writing artists.,1485993600,,166,3.911764705882353
8081139,5,B000AZ78ZU,"I was so glad to find this on DVD; I probably watched my VHS at least 30 times once upon a time. If you are a fan of Elton you HAVE to own this. To see Elton and Bernie tell their own story is not to be missed. The ""Your Song"" edit is brilliant  I never get bored watching all the cuts to different years and costumes. Check out the look exchanged between Elton (in a Donald Duck costume) and Nigel Olsson. Great bonus too: a Tumbleweed-era British TV piece.",1475625600,,458,4.088888888888889
8081140,4,B000AZ78ZU,"Took me a while to source the DVD to replace the VHS tape my wife gave me along with the album when it was new.

I've knocked off a star because of the content itself, which leaves me feeling that it fell short in places. Not sure why. Sometimes I wanted more time with the artist. Sometimes more from Bernie Taupin (who contributes heavily). Elton John, not so much. There are plenty of sources featuring him giving his side of the story of The Great Partnership.

The album had some ""Meh"" moments - The Who's choice to cover ""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"" was a bit obvious for example -  but also contained two of my all-time favorite surprise tracks - Sinead O'Connor's ""Sacrifice"" which is heart-breakingly beautiful and the way the song should have been produced originally, and Kate Bush's brilliant heavy-reggae version of ""Rocket Man"". I could have wished that the full tracks were shown on this video, but I guess they were time-constrained. Some covered songs only get a brief mention and a couple don't get shown at all, which is a shame.

I'm not sure of the value of this DVD without the audio recording. If you could only have one, the audio is the way to go.

But I found it worthwhile to search far afield for a long time to replace my VHS recording of it.",1435276800,,1282,4.508620689655173
8081141,5,B000AZ78ZU,"This is a great video for Elton John fans. It gives the background of many of the songs anf has great guest performances.

Excellent!!",1380758400,,134,4.583333333333333
8081142,5,B000AZ78ZU,"I love Elton John's music so it was really cool to see how him and Bernie Taupin create their music. They are never in the same place when they write. Taupin writes the lyrics and sends them to Elton John to put to music. I found it amazing that they can come up with so much great music literally from ""Two Rooms"".",1380758400,,315,4.096774193548387
8081143,5,B000AZ78ZU,"Elton's been my ideol for decades and I don't miss his concerts when he comes to Florida. I think this pair (him and Taupin) are impressive, they never cease to amaze me so, yes, this met my expectations.",1372291200,,204,4.394736842105263
8081144,5,B000AZ78ZU,"Brand new what can I say extremely satisfied it has been a favorite of mine for years and now I own it.

8081145,5,B000AZ78ZU,"This an excellent look into how Bernie Taupin and Elton John came together and created the most amazing music, that is still second to none! Here is your opportunity to hear the real story!

This is a four star film! Every Elton John fan should have a copy. Get the Two Rooms CD to with the likes of Sting, Clapton, etc., covering their songs!

Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin by Various Artists - Rock (Audio CD - 1991) Available at Amazon! A four star performance!",1325376000,3,497,4.450549450549451
8081146,5,B000AZ78ZU,"I had been looking for this item for quite some time, and finally found this one here at Amazon for a great price.  It arrived well ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.  Couldn't be happier.",1283126400,6,197,4.444444444444445
8081147,4,B000AZ78ZU,"This film celebrates the song-writing partnership of Elton John and Bernie Taupin. The title refers to the fact that they have never written a song together in the same room. In fact Taupin writes the lyrics first and sends them to Elton John who puts them to music.

Many famous stars perform their songs (and you can buy the audio CD as well): Sting, Eric Clapton, Sinead O'Conner, Phil Collins, The Who, Kate Bush etc. There are numerous clips of Elton performing himself as well.

The film dates from the early 1990's so theres nothing recent on the the film, but its a good representation of a great song-writing team.

Worth getting at the right price.",1193702400,10,658,4.655172413793103
