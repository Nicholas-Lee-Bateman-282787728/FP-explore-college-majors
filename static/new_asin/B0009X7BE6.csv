2332657,3,B0009X7BE6,"I'm a die-hard Good Times fan, but it's hard to completely endorse this season of the show.  It's like the writers just gave up completely.  The jokes are so stale they are almost evil - pure garbage. You really can't imagine people sitting at a typewriter believing anyone would think the jokes are funny - the writers should be ashamed of themselves. When sit-com writing gets this stupid, it sucks at your brain.  There are many disappointments - J.J. trades his dream to become a artist and works at an advertising agency, never to pick up a paint brush again, Michael, our black genius gets a ""D"" on his report card, and as an African American, I'll never understand why a show that makes so many comments on discrimination has so many crude fat jokes. (also see What's Happening.) Bookman was never strong enough to be a main character, but there was really no one else, I guess, to consider.

That said, this may still be a ""must buy"" for a few reasons.  One is the early Penny eposides(""The Evans Get Involved"")when Penny is introduced as an abused child.  These episodes do what Good Times does best - poignant dramatic comedy with an edge.  Watching Kit Fields and Janet Dubois' confrontation over her abuse allegations is amazing, and Janet Jackson is heartbreaking when she says to her mother who she is protecting, ""I didn't tell them anything Mama."" I never forgot these episodes when they aired in the seventies and now understand why.

Part of the advantage of watching the shows in order by season is that you can see the progress (or decline.) I happen to like Wilona as a lead character and Janet Dubois as a actress definitely has her moments. Some of the situations she's put in are ridiculous, but her acting is strong and it is always touching the way she becomes a mother to Penny.

And finally, there is ""Write On, Thelma.""  Thelma is asked by Mr. Nichols to change her play and finally delivers words to live by.  For my family, this was a classic and the DVD was worth it for this episode alone.  When Thelma recites her main character's monologue ""My Daddy Always Told Me......."" it is amazing how John Amos, gone from the show for two seasons, still makes an impact on the viewer's mind as ""James.""

Good Times was a complicated show and has been criticized rightly for many reasons.  But I still love it, and James Evans was unprecedented in terms of the presentation of black fathers on television.",1126656000,12,2429,4.618604651162791
2332658,4,B0009X7BE6,"During the 1977-78 season, Florida is on her honeymoon with Carl (in reality, Esther Rolle left the show because she got so fed up with the buffoonery of the JJ character, but she returned the next season), making longtime neighbor Wilona (the superb and multitalented Ja' Net Dubois) the motherly figure of the household. I won't review every episode, but I did highlight a few that stand out:

THE EVANS GET INVOLVED (Parts 1-4).  Enter Janet Jackson - before the hit records, the Grammys, and the disastrous ""wardrobe malfunction.""  She plays Penny, a strange yet charming little girl who's abused by her mother (Chip Fields, Kim's mom).  Wilona intervenes and ends up adopting her.  These are some of the most memorable episodes of the entire series.

THELMA MOVES OUT  Thelma gets fed up with sharing her pad with her two brothers, so she moves out into her own apartment, which she shares with a nerd, a fat slob, and a flirtatious woman who makes a move on Thelma's man.  The moral to the story?  The grass ain't always greener on the other side.

THELMA'S BRIEF ENCOUNTER  Any man who dates you only during lunch hours, won't give out his number, and refuses to invite you to his place is a red flag for trouble.  Thelma learns this the hard way.

PENNY'S CHRISTMAS  That Penny girl just can't stay out of trouble.  She gets busted for shoplifting at a department store.  The timing couldn't be any worse, as her adoption is close to being finalized.

JJ AND THE BOSS' DAUGHTER  In which JJ learns a valuable lesson: never mix business with pleasure.  He dates a co-worker who is not only his assistant but also his boss' daughter.  Things get messy when she threatens to have him fired after he breaks a date with her.

WHERE THERE'S SMOKE The couch is set on fire.  Thelma, JJ, Michael, and Penny all give different versions of the story, but only one is telling the truth.  Guess who?

JJ's CONDITION  JJ is stressing and he's getting an ulcer.  Is it because of Thelma's cooking?  Nope, he's dating a woman who's still married to her husband.  Two's company, but three is definitely a crowd.

As with the other ""Good Times"" DVDs, there are no extra features.  It would have been nice if they had a documentary or some interviews, but all we get are the episodes and nothing more.  Still, it's a good buy, and some of the season's best episodes can be found here.",1126483200,5,2374,4.594272076372315
2332659,5,B0009X7BE6,I love me some Good Times if I am not reading a book. I am watching Good Times. This is my favorite season with Penny (Janet Jackson). I used to do my homework while watching Good Times. I thank whomever came up with the idea of putting it on DVD.,1125273600,2,247,3.96
2332660,4,B0009X7BE6,"the show was still Good,but Losing John Amos was a Huge loss. the Politics of the Show ran Him away&for a while also ran off Esther Rolle. Wilona steps in big during this season. Wilona is a Sexy soul Sista. Thelma then&Now still keeps me Glassy Eyed&can still make my Pinky Toe Cabbage patch sight on seen. the subject matter of Child Abuse with Janet Jackson&Chip Fields was Powerful then as it is now.where has the Challenging Subject matter in Tv gone again?? the show was still good,with quality subject matter still hapening,but there was a Fall minus John Amos there. John Amos is One of the Most Underrated Actors Ever. John Amos was very good in the Role of Kunte Kinte in Alex Hailey's Mini Series""Roots"".",1123977600,2,715,4.637795275590551
2332661,4,B0009X7BE6,"This season began with the introduction of Janet Jackson's character of Penny who became Willona's daughter. The first few episodes with Penny's mother (Chip Field's) are some of the best episodes of the entire run.

The remainder of the season however leaves alot to be desired. The plots seem contrived and the writers appear to be struggling to include each character in every episode.

However, as a die hard fan, I contined to tune in then and I enjoyed the DVD now.",1123113600,9,471,4.7317073170731705
2332662,3,B0009X7BE6,"This is the season of Good Times where the mainstream veiwers were tapering off, and left with only the hard-core(i.e. African-American) fans. Not only was John Amos killed off long ago(while getting acclaim for his portrayal of adult Kunte Kinte in Roots),but Esther Rolle departed the show due to the direction the show has taken.
 By the fall of 1977,the fifth season was re-tooled with not only Ja'net Dubois taking center stage, but gaining a new daughter in the form of Penny Gordon (Janet Jackson) an abused child who was abandoned by her mother.
 Although the Evans' parents were gone, the hub of activity was still the Evans  apartment as the children were left to fend for themselves under the watchful eye of Willona. The new retooling of the show displayed the drama of backstage politics manifest itself into the show that was itself self destructing.",1119484800,24,864,4.904109589041096
2332663,5,B0009X7BE6,"In season five we are introduced to a little girl in a bad situation.  Janet Jackson joins the cast as Esther Rolle leaves the show for a while.  The Evans kids really show remarkable growth into adult hood in season five.  They still tease each other and make us laugh but that's just a sibling thing.

Wilona Woods really gets her chance to shine as the new lead actress of the series.  She takes Janet Jackson's character Penny under her wing as we discover Penny's home is nowhere for a child to be living.

The writers really did a good job at recapturing the mood of Good Times as it was in the first season even without the lead actors it began with.",1119225600,25,657,4.300813008130081
2332664,5,B0009X7BE6,"I have all the good times DVD's, but the best thing I like about the show is not the comedy or the nostalgia; it is the controversial and political subjects that the show has portrayed over all the seasons. From the subjects of drug use, gang violence, and especially the way the fourth season carried on without the patriarch of the family, and how the family struggled more but grew stronger. Season five has the best of all these seasons combined, that is, when they brought the subject of child abuse, single parenthood and adoption of children to poor people in a five part continuing story of the new girl in the neighborhood(PLayed By Janet Jackson)and her abusive mother and how Wilona (Ja'net Dubois) save her from this horrible situation. I think of all the topics of Mr. Norman Lears Television shows during the seventies, this particular story stayed with me the most. I watched it when I was a child, and it still has the same profound impact on me today as it did when I first seen it on TV. My friend who has never seen the show being from another country who watches it with me frequently, agrees that this is one of the most underrated TV shows in TV history. THese issues are as important today as they were thirty years ago.",1119052800,28,1243,4.504424778761062

2332714,4,B0009X7BE6,"IMO Good Times lost some important steam (and heart) with the departures of mom & dad Evans.  Having series star/ comedian James Walker (""Kid DY!NO!MITE!"") take over as the head of the Evans clan in his lanky heart before head way as opposed to bucking his parent's authority certainly adds a different flavor but the fact that he doesn't have the same resonating authority as his parents is showcased in having neighbor Willona (the lovely Ja'Net Du Bois) stepping in and filling Florida's old shoes as the guiding light of the family.  Bookman (""Buffalo Butt""/ ""Booger"") is also given a larger part and more recurring role as he morphs this season from the jawing janitor ready to evict the Evans family every other episode to the jawing janitor who slowly begins to be incorporated into their expanding family as a family friend.  Janet Jackson's Penny character, Willona's daughter, is largely used as slight comic material and mostly wasted this season as is Michael's; so much more could have been done with this young man who has passed from boyhood living in the ghetto now fatherless and motherless.  Still, the series continued to match lighthearted humor with real day-to-day difficulties both economic, social, and interpersonal while showcasing how these issues could be resolved with integrity and strength in suffering.  What a fantastic show.  Is there a show on like this today?

For me (a young white boy from the solid middle class in the late 70s/ early 80s growing up in a good neighborhood) Good Times was a much loved show with very real characters who were important to me because they showed me how a poor family could be connected and survive by their deep love, taught me lessons about the importance of standing strong in the face of adversity, and showed me just how decent people can be no matter that they and I look very different on the outside.  (That and I had a crush on Thelma...I mean, c'mon!)  This show was both beloved and held a huge importance for me and so many others in a still then largely white America.

Could this show be brought back?  Or would that crack the back of the current interrelated and rainbow diverse zeitgeist, recognizing that not everything is rosy but strong knit families in torn up communities still have something to teach us?",1397347200,,2296,4.802030456852792

2332727,4,B0009X7BE6,"""Good Times - The Complete Fifth Season"" marks two significant changes in the cast this season. The first change is an addition to the cast: Janet Jackson joins the cast as Penny Gordon, who's the central character in the four-part episode ""The Evans Get Involved"". Penny is first seen coming in contact with the Evanses, who become acquainted with Penny & later discover bruises of all sorts on her body. This prompts the Evans family to contact the authorities. It is later discovered that Penny's mother is causing the abuse, so Willona takes steps to adopt Penny. A chilling episode. J.J. & three friends share a car in ""Wheels"", & Penny is caught shoplifting in ""Penny's Christmas"". The other cast change is more significant, as Esther Rolle is absent from the cast this season. Florida & Carl Dixon, a love interest from the previous season, have moved to Arizona due to Carl's health. Ja'Net DuBois' Willona Woods gets bigger roles as a result of Esther's absence, so you could say the addition of Janet Jackson to the cast worked out quite well. Thelma, frustrated over her lack of privacy from her brothers at home, decides to move into a roommate's apartment in ""Thelma Moves Out"", & J.J. is suspicious of Thelma's new boyfriend in ""Thelma's Brief Encounter"". Michael makes friends with a girl in the building via CB radio, & later finds out she has a disability in the episode ""Breaker, Breaker"". Johnny Brown's Nathan Bookman gets a larger role this season as well (no pun intended), as the Evanses scheme to get Bookman fired from his job in ""Bye, Bye Bookman"". Robert Guillaume guest-stars as a neighborhood wino who everyone believes he died in a tragic accident in ""Requiem For A Wino"". Willona is involved in two distinct employment scenarios - in the episodes ""Willona, The Fuzz"" - where she takes a store security job to pay for Penny's skates, & in ""Willona's New Job"" - where her ex-husband arrives in town & has big plans. Along with asking to marry her, he buys Willona's company & becomes her boss. So, there's a lot to choose from this season, although it's a weak season since Esther Rolle's not part of the cast. Many of the episodes feature strong storylines to compensate for this absence - hence the four-star rating. ""Good Times - The Complete Fifth Season"" is still a worthwhile, must-have purchase to add to your DVD collection.

Anyway, Willona Woods played by the sassy and entertaining Janet Dubois adopts an abused girl, Penny, played by Janet Jackson.

Johnny Brown as Booker is also a regular and the three Evans kids are still here.

While the show may have hit it's peak two seasons ago, the show still has our favorites.

Janet Jackson's performance as abused child, Penny, was relatively done with dignity to entertain and inform the audiences about the dangers of child abuse. Like so many issues, Good Times had always managed to deliver a realistic portrayal of such a timely issue.",1198108800,,775,4.676470588235294

2332762,4,B0009X7BE6,"The fifth season pulls you in with the four part story line, ""the Evans Get Involved.""  I was too young to see it when it first aired but it hooked me in from the start.  Janet Jackson fits the role of sweet but troubled Penny and Wilona plays the mother role quite well.  The season contains all sorts of laughs and predicaments as J.J is now the head of the household and has to hold it together.  It would have been more believable though to see an episode where J.J actually gets the job at the ad agency.  As another reviewer commented there were too many fat jokes in this season directed at Bookman and after a while they got stale.  Since the show was about discrimination they sure had no problems attacking other types for a cheap laugh.  The episode where J.J dreams that he has turned white was one of the weirdest ones in the season and it failed to actually make the point it was trying to make.  Another memorable episode is when Wilona is offered a security job but has doubts when she discovers what she actually has to do.  It truly was an episode ahead of its time taking into account all the surveillance cameras in the world today. I have to confess I did enjoy the season very much although I do have one complaint.  In the first season the poverty is very much front and centre but here, one would be hard pressed to say the Evans are suffering in any true sense.  The porridge that was a constant for breakfast in the first three seasons has been replaced by pancakes, eggs and bacon.  Their fridge is now full of ribs, chicken, pork etc...they buy new furniture in this season without a fuss and there are forever going out and taking part in cultural events.  The family in reality is now lower middle class.  They might still live in the projects but so what?  It's also interesting to see all the rich guys that come through Wilona's door.

8069122,5,B0009X7BE6,"Great/cool season... I remembered I was 5 six years old when this season was aired on CBS and I also remembered (in early 1980) when the entire series began to air on syndication on one of our local independent stations in NY.  However, I do have a few concerns though... I've been wondering how this show would've turned out if the Florida Evans character was still on the show during this season?.  Would J.J. actually have a job at the advertising agency during the 5th season?  Would Willona adopt Penny... would young Janet Jackson even join the cast at all??  Would Bookman (officially) join the cast in the 5th season?  Would J.J.'s friends (Poppo, Head, Cool Breeze) visit the Evans' apartment from time to time during the 5th season?",1502582400,,742,4.72093023255814
