6791762,4,B00PBGOY3M,Fascinating and sad. Your jaw will drop at the ease and comfort of these guys denial and narcissism.,1427673600,5,100,4.611111111111111
6791763,5,B00PBGOY3M,"An awesome inside look at what it is to be an internet celebrity.  Mark and Ethan have always been my favorite YouTube couple and this film captures the genuine nature of their relationship.  On the flip side, the film also exposes the raw and often narcissistic persona's of Hollywood male celebrities.  It's a short film but fast paced and packed with intimate details of two very disparate paradigms.",1426204800,3,403,4.897058823529412
6791764,3,B00PBGOY3M,"I purchased ""Studlebrity"" as I am a fan of Mark and Ethan.  They were the only good thing about the CD as it had a lot of down-market pretty boys who were always angry and willing to fight!
Ethan and Mark, on the other hand, are a young couple who live in Bloomington, Indiana. They are so natural, fun and down to earth, it is refreshing to see.  I hold them up as an example of what being gay should be and I urge others to buy the CD just to see what normal is. Forget about the pretty boys, this is Mark and Ethan's all the way.  I would have scored this 5 s but the others pulled the rating down.  Phil.",1423094400,3,608,3.9186991869918697
6791765,4,B00PBGOY3M,"Interesting documentary type of film. I got this primarily because I have seen Youtube videos of a few of these men and was interested to see what they had to say. Let me say something about the subjects. 1...Mark E. Miller, I've followed hi on Youtube for quite a while, apparently (I say that because to some extent they are all performers) going by what I see, real and genuine and very down to earth Great looking outside and inside. 2...Ethan Hethcote, I saw him when he dated Mark Miller, very Midwestern, cute sometimes a little ingenuous but I think that is just for the cameras. 3...Murray Swanby, probably the one I find most attractive. he models for Andrew Christian and I did see him in those ads. Definitely a party boy but seems to know his mind. 4...his BF Pablo Hernandez, also a model, seems to want the limelight all the time, me, me ,me. Not for me! and the worst of the 5....Topher DiMaggio, what a phony, he says that most people see him as unapproachable or aloof, he says he isn't then later he says that he only surrounds himself with attractive boys. What A egomaniacal, superficial and shallow idiot. Glad Mark can make a living from Youtube.",1416096000,7,1169,4.545023696682464
6791766,1,B00PBGOY3M,"What a terrible film, if that's what it was. Poorly narrated, no focus, insignificant and unrelatable characters.",1475366400,3,113,5.705882352941177
6791767,3,B00PBGOY3M,"It's just interesting to see how good looking people can be famous for just being good looking, even making a living off it. lol",1474588800,,128,4.375
6791768,3,B00PBGOY3M,It was interesting.  Light entertainment and discussion about being young and gay and involved in social media.  The young men spotlighted were very optimistic.  I hope they continue to be as the world and social media dishes out whatever it will.,1473984000,,247,4.975609756097561
6791769,2,B00PBGOY3M,Disheveled mess by the end. Never quite attained the focus needed to document anything but  semi coherent clips.,1473724800,2,112,5.222222222222222
6791770,2,B00PBGOY3M,"Typical gay men turning to prostitution thinking it's a career. I'm prettier than most of them including ""Gopher"" and those who need an audience to feed their ego's. I prefer educated and grounded and no need to become a social media whore taking pics every other minute of myself. This is what I expected and sorry I watched. Useless fodder.",1470873600,5,342,4.716666666666667

6791772,1,B00PBGOY3M,A documentary about good-looking men  that are completely unattractive. Narcissistic to say the least.,1470528000,3,102,6.285714285714286

8687305,1,B00PBGOY3M,"This video seems to elevate and glamorize the sickness of what I call the ""internet nobodies"".  People who are famous for nothing, really.  Just for being pretty and being ""out there""...putting their lives on display.  While not entirely new, narcissism and shameless self-promotion has taken on incredible proportions in this age of the internet and social media.  In my mind this needs to be rejected and these people held up to ridicule, but because the younger generation just doesn't ""get it"", the sickness grows.  Unchecked human vanity IS a sickness.  I have no respect for these people.  I respect humble people who truly contribute to society or create art of lasting social value.  These sick ""nobodies"" are on the low road to celebrity and their shallow, arrogant, souls sicken the enlightened (yes, mostly older) folks in this world.  This crappy video is an apologist piece and featured a couple of the saddest excuses of celebrity to be found in this sad, new world.  We HAVE to quit giving pretty people a pass and we certainly shouldn't give monetary support for their vapid, egocentric lifestyle.  Wait...a Mark E Miller production...that explains everything.  Let's hold this guy up to ridicule this moment as the carefree, loathsome, empty, self-centered human that he is....Sorry, no love for internet nobodies.",1517011200,,1331,5.1395348837209305

8687311,1,B00PBGOY3M,Lame! Typical gay guys that get paid for absolutely nothing but think they've accomplished something.  I'm gay but couldn't stomach more then 10 minutes.,1482624000,2,153,5.375
