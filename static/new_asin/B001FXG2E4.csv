3589601,1,B001FXG2E4,"This could have been a good film.  The direction shows promise.  The casting was a disservice to the cast and the film, though all made a good effort.  I cannot in good conscience recommend this film",1446940800,2,199,4.472222222222222
3589602,4,B001FXG2E4,"Interesting film. I was intrigued with Stephen Grimes imagination, a portrayal of his own shadows.  Found it to be a worthwhile evening's entertainment. Which was the plot of the movie and which was the plot of the book?",1446940800,3,220,4.7894736842105265

3589604,1,B001FXG2E4,"Unbelievably bad. Lame plot devices, unsympathetic characters, horrible dialogue. I'm only 15 minutes in and I'm picking apart this movie like crazy. My gut reaction is the main character has a lot of jerk friends and needs to clean house. Don't even get me started on the dance scene or the fact that the main character hits a kid with his car and even tho he HAS A CELLPHONE he picks the kid up to rush him to the hospital. My 10 year old niece knows better than that. Very happy this came free with prime, cuz even 2.99 would be a huge waste of money. Do yourself a favor, scroll past this one.",1443830400,,597,4.245614035087719
3589605,3,B001FXG2E4,Clever plot twist. This low budget film does not seem to suffer from financial restraints. The audio could have been a little crisper.,1439683200,5,134,4.869565217391305
3589606,1,B001FXG2E4,"To me, this was a boring, endless, homemade ""art"" film.  There was nothing suspenseful about this, but there was a heck of a lot of tedium.  Just a warning to others (and this from someone who normally writes good reviews!).",1428710400,2,224,4.575

3589608,4,B001FXG2E4,"Horror novelist Stephen Grimes is suffering from writer's block, and - with a deadline looming in just two weeks - is desperately searching ""The Shadows"" (2007) for ideas, putting his regular life (in the process of going through a divorce, living with his sister, in desperate need of some way to relax) on hold.  On a late drive to clear his head, he hits Emett, a young man who coincidentally has the same last name, and takes him to the hospital where he is treated and released. In his desperate need for a distraction, he is attracted to the young man, and they begin a sexual relationship, apparently a first for Stephen.  Eventually, Stephen decides to give up his demanding ""real life"" (by means of eliminating any paper trail of Stephen Grimes, which is actually just his pen name, adapted to differentiate himself from his hispanic heritage, which he has some guilt feelings about), with Emett and his friends helping.  Soon thereafter, Stephen finds out that he has been the patsy in an elaborate con, and looks for the answers in the shadows of his former life.

Beautifully photographed, and capably acted, but this is a rather complex film that is not for everyone.  The director switches seamlessly between scenes in real time, of flashbacks of what happens before, and what Stephen is imagining for his novel.  The ending is also hard to believe.  Perhaps worth a rental, but not the kind of film you would watch more than once.  Four stars out of five.",1228089600,7,1470,4.737254901960784
8303045,3,B001FXG2E4,"The shadows start with a plot well defined. A famous writer says he will finish his novel in two weeks. The problem is the first page, and he is blocked to go on. He searches for inspiration in a night ride, finishing by crossing over a guy. There things begin to get more mysterious when the ran over has the same surname of the writer. Who then reveals that is not his real name. From now on, we don't know where the plot of the film is and what is the plot of the novel hes writing.
The film is dynamic, with constant turns-over between the reality of the film and that of the novel. Its well enacted. He gets involved with the boy, or is it his shadow. He loses all he has to his shadow?
Its not an easy film to watch, I myself had to watch it twice to get my idea of the film, but I think it worthies a try.",1484352000,,812,3.9272727272727272

8303051,5,B001FXG2E4,"Beautiful movie with a very intriguing plot.  The editing is also excellent cutting back between fantasy, a novel being written and the actual story of a successful horror novelist.  I find Joe Lia an extraordinary actor. His performances are powerful and energetic, tender and intimate.  He completely makes me forget the camera and instantly draws me into the storyline with his presence.  There is something natural and organic about his acting abilities.  As the love scene between the two main characters unfolded, my lover turned to me and said, ""Joe Lia is the first actor I've watch that makes gay sex look normal and natural.""  I even loved the way he dances in this movie!  I can't believe all the one star ratings given to this movie.  I've seen some BAD movies, and this, by far, was not one of them.  I highly recommend it. I highly recommend ANYTHING that Mr. Lia is in.  I think he deserves an Oscar Award for his performance in FAQS.  He one of the best actors in Hollywood, but he does not seem to be one to sell out. I hope eventually, the industry catches on too.  Keep up the good work Joe!",1459555200,2,1110,4.522613065326633

8303053,2,B001FXG2E4,"The plot seemed thin in places and the storeline was hard, at times, to follow.  The end almost made no sense to me.  There were, however, some moments that seemed fairly entertaining and well thought out.  Overall, not really my cup of tea but to each his/her own...",1456617600,2,267,4.520833333333333
