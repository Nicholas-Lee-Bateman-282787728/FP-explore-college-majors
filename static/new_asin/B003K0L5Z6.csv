8398598,5,B003K0L5Z6,Garand was a mystery to me before this CD. Recommend.,1434326400,,53,4.4
8398599,5,B003K0L5Z6,"I was the writer/producer/director/actor for this video back in the mid 80's, and I was quite surprised to see that it is still available.  It was made on a shoe string budget with what a couple of guys had on hand, a VHS camcorder, and a VCR.  Some of the filming was done in my apartment.  As I remember, the closing credits were done on a Commodore 64 computer, state of the art.  Now a bit dated and some of the facts are a bit off, it has stood the test of time fairly well.  I stil have the original master VHS tape.  Too bad we don't get royalties!",1334275200,,555,4.045871559633028
