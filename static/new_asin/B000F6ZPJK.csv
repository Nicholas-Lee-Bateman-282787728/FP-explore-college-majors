8118605,3,B000F6ZPJK,"The 2 discs in this DVD set are Latin Grooves and Reggaeton. Latin Grooves has an option for overdubbed instruction in Spanish. Both begin with a stepping warm up which starts out a little fast. This is like joining an  aerobics class, how well you can keep up depends on your experience following choreography. Latin Grooves/Disc 1 contains these routines: Warm-up Fiesta, Tribal, Flamenco, Espiritu, Carnival, Eclectic Sounds, Cool Down. Each Routine is about 5 minutes. Reggaeton/Disc 2 begins with a warm-up then Cross & Punch, Samba & Mambo, Kick & Slide, Triple Step & Cross, Gallop & Routine, Cool Down. Some of the footage seems a little raw but it doesn't interrupt the flow. The music is a light synthesized blend that changes only slightly for each style and routine. It's corny. So are the outfits. I think I'd like this better if I were 13. The instructor is upbeat and energetic and talks a lot, all the time. The choreography is the stuff of basic dance classes and probably won't be difficult for anyone with good dance coordination. For me, it all flies by a little fast. I would have liked to have each movement broken down, isolated, but this does not happen at any point. I'm still searching for a dance DVD that is for the uncoordinated non-dancer.",1168646400,7,1269,4.742081447963801
