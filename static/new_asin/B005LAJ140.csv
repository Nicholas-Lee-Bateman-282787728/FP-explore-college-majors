4821462,4,B005LAJ140,"""Strike Back"" is an imported British series that has been shown in the United States on pay cable's Cinemax.  With lots of graphic violence and gratuitous sex, the show is an amalgam of James Bond movies and TV's ""24.""

Michael Stonehenge (Philip Winchester), a British sergeant, and Damian Scott (Sullivan Stapleton), a former U.S. Delta Force operative who was discharged on the eve of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, are members of a top secret intelligence agency known as Section 20.  Stonehenge, Scott, and the rest of Section 20 criss-cross the globe on the trail of a deadly Middle-Eastern terror mastermind named Latif (Jimi Mistry), who is planning a major attack involving a cache of weapons of mass destruction that could have worldwide repercussions.

The series harks back to 1980's buddy-action cinema and further back still to ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.""  The dialogue is often witty and far more clever than your standard action drama.  The look is slick and stylish, with episodes taking place in many exotic locales.  It's timely and relevant because the underlying dramatic thrust is tracking down terrorists bent on widespread destruction.

The six-disc Blu-ray set contains the DVD version, a Digital Copy download, and five audio commentaries with cast and crew.",1343520000,,1278,5.169902912621359

Strike Back  seems like a broadcast answer to 9/11.
We are introduced to Section 20, a secret branch of the British Secret Intelligence Service.
Sergeant Michael Stonebridge (Philip Winchester) and Damian Scott (Sullivan Stapleton) are our heroes.
Stonebridge is a by-the-book Royal Marine and Special Boat Service commando. Scott (Sullivan Stapleton) is a former American Delta Force operative .
Initially Stonebridge and Scott are sent in to rescue John Porter.
Porter is a former SAS (Special Air Service). Prior to the invasion of Iraq, he was on a hostage rescue mission. During the course of the mission Porter saved the life of an Iraq child. That child goes on to kill two of Porter's soldiers. He is held responsible and chooses to retire instead of facing an unstable future.
Porter has been captured by Latif, a Pakistani terrorist, who is plotting ""Project Dawn.""
Stonebridge and Scott repect each other but get on each other's nerves.
""He (Scott) is the one that usually goes in first and takes the bullets, whereas Stonebridge arrives at the last minute and saves the day,"" Philip said.
Strike Back is based on a book of the same name from former Special Air Service (SAS) soldier turned novelist Chris Ryan. It's a believable, action packed series but hard for the layperson to follow at times.",1343174400,2,1375,5.026315789473684
4821464,5,B005LAJ140,this is a GREAT series but if you want SEASON 1 you will have to buy the all region blu-ray which has SERIES 1 & 2.  you WON'T be dissappointed.,1342396800,2,144,3.8
4821465,4,B005LAJ140,"Ahh, Cinemax. Home to all of the same movies on HBO but also home to everyone's favorite late-night soft-core porn. So how does this channel look to distinguish itself from HBO other than the soft-core porn? Two words: Original Programming. But since it's Cinemax, it has to have a program that not too  dissimilar in flavor to what Cinemax is so well-known for. So they imported a show from the UK originally called CHRIS RYAN'S STRIKE BACK, shortened the title, and according to information about that show, Cinemax splashed it with a super-sized helping of pretty graphic violence and lots of (mostly) unnecessary sex and lo and behold Cinemax gave us STRIKE BACK.

The show is, in essence, a volatile chemical mixture of the conspiracies and action of 24, the stand-alone episodic suspense and serious character work of SPOOKS (known here in the US on PBS as MI-5), the kind of tech and teamwork of THE UNIT, the kind of graphic violence Premium Cable allows for, and some of the gratuitous sex and nudity of Cinemax's late-night fare. The structure of the show is a buddy-action film with two mis-matched partners going after the bad guys and kicking (and showing) some serious buttocks, but intermingled with some more serious and shocking moments you wouldn't expect.

On the partner side you have the stiff British soldier Alex Stonebridge (the impossibly well-chiseled Philip Winchester) who is all about the orders and the mission, and then there's the sloppy and rugged American, the disgraced former Delta named Damien Scott (Sullivan Stapleton, suitably tough) who is all about the ladies and the action. Stonebrigde works for a secret unit of British Military Intelligence called Section 20, run by Colonel Eleanor Grant (a terrific Amanda Mealing). An operative of theirs is killed in the hunt to find a Middle-Eastern terror mastermind called Latif, and in order to find Latif, Scott is reluctantly brought on-board in Section 20. Over the ten episodes of this season, there are some real highlights, some real low-lights, but mostly a pretty solid piece of entertainment.

Among the real highlights of the season are an extremely tense two-parter where Stonebridge and Scott along with Capt. Kate Marshall (the lovely Eva Birthistle), another Section 20 agent and Stonebridge's secret lover, square off against a former IRA bomber (the always great Liam Cunningham); another extremely tense two-parter with Stonebridge and Scott as they partner up with an arms dealer (GAME OF THRONES's Iain Glen) to free his daughter from an African rebel army's leader (LOST's Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); a truly magnificent set-piece involving a minefield, and a massive firefight with Stonebridge and Scott vs dozens of Chechen rebels all look to raise your pulse or stall your breathing. The final sacrifice. These are all moments that push this show into pretty awesome territory.

Among the low-lights of the show, one is that there is very little character development beyond what's on the surface. Stonebridge and Scott get by on their looks, action-hero personas and charm. The other semi-major characters of Section 20, like Maj. Sinclair (Rhashan Stone) and Sgt.  Richmond (Michelle Lukes) have no development. They're not quite red-shirt ""Star Trek"" characters (but to be fair, there are more than a few of those), but they have no real life to them, and that's not the fault of the performers. The only character that seems to really have a developmental arc is Col. Grant, and she has some questionable motives. Scott's sexual liasons are as unrealistic as the other Cinemax late-night fare (the woman in the bar he talks to for 2 minutes; the only beautiful hostage; etc.). The absolute worst thing the show does is a pretty significant death for Stonebridge happens, and once it's done with, it's done with. You never really see that revisit his character, and you never see anyone else grieve or really even acknowledge the death. The direction never seems terribly inspired either. It's pretty much a point-and-shoot show.

So yes, there is a first season that was shown in the UK that actually concentrates on the character who is the lynchpin of Scott coming to Section 20, but there is no way of really seeing that in the US because of the apparent region coding issues on those discs. The real showrunner of STRIKE BACK is Andy Harries, who's been doing TV and film in the UK for a few decades, with shows like WALLANDER and films like THE QUEEN. But when the show got stateside, the biggest name involved was Frank Spotnitz, whose work previously included the awful remake of KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER for TV a few years back and sci-fi thrillers like HARSH REALM and MILLENIUM. But Spotnitz was also a producer for THE X-FILES (and the first episode of this show has a HUGE shout-out to that show) so having someone on staff who was a big part of one of the greatest television series ever is a big plus in this show's favor.

STRIKE BACK is a throwback to charming 80's buddy-action cinema but with the sensibilites of more modern storytelling techniques, and a healthy amount of flesh give this show a very unusual flavor, but it's tasty enough to make you want seconds.",1340496000,41,5198,4.952981651376147
4821466,3,B005LAJ140,"Strike Back season 2 have a good story, and good cinematography with believeable photography.

Its shortcomings are the lack of memorable characters, something season 1 had, especially with Richard Armitage's character, John Porter. Also I find the amount of violence shown exceeding my preference.

If you expect the same quality in all aspects as season 1, you will probably be disappointed. But if you expect it to be something on its own, rather than a regular follow-up season, then you can find liking season 2 easier.

Caught Strike Back on Cinemax and it is great to watch a series with a budget that is not hampered by US censors. Violence galore, nudity and a very interesting plot. Strike Back may not have the complexity of Spooks, though with much more in your face violence, it is like 24 on steroids with some of the witty dialogue reminiscent of the last 2 seasons of The Border. As this is done in a serial format, watching in a few sittings would be like a really long non stop action movie. Highly recommended.",1325548800,61,571,4.296296296296297

4821530,5,B005LAJ140,"Wasn't sure this reboot for tv could stand against the original movies, but it more than does.  Roger Murtaugh's family has more credibility in this tv series, with all the kids getting equal story time.  Wife Trish has her own career, instead of being in Roger's shadow.  Martin Riggs has WAY more depth and screen chemistry, especially with Jordana Brewster as his therapist/friend/colleague,  than Mel Gibson ever did.  I do WISH the makeup department would do something with his hair. He's supposed to be the hottie, but his unkempt appearance comes off as staged.

Everyone's acting is impeccable, and the scripts for each episode are gritty and believable.  This series more than stands on its own, and we can look forward to future seasons.",1523059200,,747,4.975806451612903

Good people get hurt and die, bad people sometimes win. Fights are chaotic and brutal. I'm sure real life military would cringe at some the the action, and it is admittedly a little over-the-top. But it's still fun and well done; similar to a James Bond movie.  The plot, while somewhat unrealistic, is good enough to keep me going. The problem here is that there is so much unnecessary sex. I wouldn't complain if it was occasional or necessary to the plot. But it's not either of those. Literally every episode has at least one, if not more sex/nude scenes. If that's what your watching for, then great. But for those of us who want a decent action show without the filth of unnecessary soft-porn, this is not for us.",1519257600,,842,4.425806451612903
4821537,1,B005LAJ140,Purchase this item because it included the digital HD copy. When I received it I find out the code to redeem the digital copy expired 4 and a half months ago. What a rip off. Really should be zero stars.,1519171200,,203,4.1
4821578,1,B005LAJ140,"Let's see if I understand today's action thrillers. Men's dress: fatigues or tight jeans. Men's body: muscular with square jaw and habitual two day growth of facial hair.  In addition, butt should be muscular and as round as a man's butt can get because we'll be see a lot of it.  For the women: tight pants, tank tops or button up blouse that is a size too small and a push up bra. Since we'll be seeing a lot of their chests during each and every episode, nice boobs are a must along with an appropriate butt.  The good guys are usually made up of: ex or active military, M5, ex-SWAT of a mixture of these types.  There is usually an angry guy that doesn't like to follow the rules and for some reason can boink any female that he comes within 5 feet of.  Even the enemy women.  I'm sure there must be a minimum number of bullets expended during every gun battle and blood has to be splattered during every gun fight.  Although hand to hand combat occurs with regularity, our heroes heal quickly and by the next episode show no signs of any damage. I'm afraid that the women in this series (as well as a couple of others I've watched) usually aren't as smart or deadly as their-male counterparts but do seem to hold a lot of command positions.  Since I am not a long-time watcher of action movies, I may have missed the good points that other reviewers have mentioned.  It seems to me, though, that if I can figure out the plots before we reach the end of the episode and know who's going to make it to the next show, that there is something lacking in the story line and script writing.  I won't even go into the acting. There is not much of it required.  The language is what you would expect.  One wonders how James Bond made it through his continuing adventures with out saying the ""F"" word or making enough enough noise during sex to wake the dead.  I will continue to try an action film now and again because I want to learn about this type of movie. I'm afraid I can't recommend this one to you.",1519084800,,2004,4.26984126984127

The underlying weak plot and intrigue are overshadowed by intolerable foul language and inexplicable and obligatory sex scenes. As someone who writes for a living, this show is the perfect example of clutter. The writers and producers have a few minutes of intelligible script of the plot line and the rest of the script is various forms of the F word. That is not a creative script whatsoever and does not harness the actors' skills. The sex is random, explicit and totally unnecessary to the plot line. Maybe it was needed once to establish that Sgt. Scott is promiscuous and frivolous. However, the show runners made it a recipe. Every script will have 5 fights, 4000 forms of the F*** word and 1.5 full nudity sex scene. Also, every woman chosen for the show was a potential sex mate for the actor. So female actors auditioning for the show had to be OK with making a naked sex scene in order to have a part in the show. They may play a highly skilled agent or assassin but everyone has to have sex right? Also, nobody has sex with clothes on so everyone has to be nude! I am ashamed for the actors both male and female who wanted to be taken seriously but are put through the porn action show.

Contrary to movie makers' beliefs, bullets from AK 47 rifles do not weave random patterns in the air.  They go where the sights line up.  And the soul searching constantly wrestles for screen time with the topless interludes and the noisy sex bouts.
There is a saying: ""The best laid plans of mice and men oft go awry.""  That doesn't apply here. All the plans are bad.  Every operation by ""Team 20"" is a house of cards that collapses at the creak of a floorboard.
A lot of effort went into the mechanics of this series.  People in all the crafts worked their butts off making it.

Strike Back sounded like it contained the action we always like having been fans of the show 24 (I know don't compare it to 24) but in reality that is what I said it reminded me of after about the 3rd or 4th episode, just a British version.

We watched the entire 1st season in less than one week but have been much slower to get into the 2nd season. The actors are very effective at portraying their parts although the Scott (American) character seems to be some kind of horn dog and the every episode sex scenes seem extremely unrealistic and just thrown in to keep the younger crowd watching.

Great viewing, worth watching if you have Prime but not sure I would spend any extra to watch it on a DVD nor would we pay extra to watch additional seasons that are not available Free with Prime.",1487462400,2,874,4.355828220858895

4821921,5,B005LAJ140,"There was nothing on tv so on a whim....And I'm very happy that I started watching Strike Back! Cinemax hit this one out of the ballpark! The career British soldier who's straight forward and the dishonorably discharged American who's an ""a-hole and comedian"" end up making a fine pair of black op force recon soldiers! They must have had a UK director cuz this show doesn't have the ""American type"" of director created feel to it like every American action show has. And they battle terror in Thailand, Beirut, Paris, etc. Basically places that American produced shows don't. Stonebridge is the Brit who's married and the American is the womanizer who has a sense of humor he eventually rubs off on his Brit counter part.

Each episode is very exciting (I've watched 1-4 a couple times already) with the good guys trying to stop the bad guys throughout the season, with the last episode being high octane, which makes you want it to never stop!

This Cinemax produced cable show its ten times better than 24 which was a hit in America but bores the heck out of me that I just couldn't watch more than five episodes concurrently!

Of course the government is the bad guy or a corporation. They do not hold back on the terrorists though, making sure we get a full blown bad guy you cheer when he gets his.

Even though everyone the two stars encounter must have the worst aim ever, so just a little silly how they are missed with 10-15 shooting at them, its still a good show.

I had some misgivings going in that the story may be too simple, but I was impressed by the scope of the story, the characters and the points of interests used in the filming. Of course, every episode appears to have at least one ""adult"" situation, which I'm okay with. Eye candy can't hurt a show, but I also think there should be a better balance in the use of it.

Although the production values are high, and the locations handsome, and there are inordinate amounts of gratuitous gore and nudity, the storytelling is pretty standard and old-fashioned: two apparently indestructible hunks fight terrorism around the world, blah blah. Kind of Man From U.N.C.L.E. for the 21st century. One of the hunks is an American who does surprisingly well with a British accent. Most American actors get lost somewhere in the Keanu-in-Dracula zone. The other is an Aussie doing an American accent -- one of those generic 21st-century Aussie hunks who all look like their stage name should be Biff Kake. He, of course, is a wisecracking discipline problem, because, well, he's American. Not usually one to complain about this, but the way virtually every woman on the show is there to have sex with one or the other of them  really is demeaning and sexist and detracts from rather than adds to the edgy, gritty vibe they're aiming for.",1484870400,,990,4.963855421686747

While it plays with modern storylines about terrorism, etc, it is unbelievably racist. A middle-eastern chant is always a sign of the bad guys -- even when they are not Muslim or Middle Eastern.

The Americans and Brits storm into any country without permission and wreak havoc and they are the only decent folks. People from other countries are always uncooperative when they aren't outright bad guys.

Of course there are many more..
Whether this stupid show has lived up to the creators' of entertainment expectations, i can't say, as 8 min in the first episode i was already totally bored and disgusted with the typical ""hollywood template.""

4823925,1,B005LAJ140,"Many reviewers rightly mention the quantity and graphic nature of the pretend humping as a detriment to the show, but it was fatally flawed anyway, as it starts out sort of OK, but then inevitably devolves into the standard liberal line of conspiratorial propaganda BS regarding the resumption of hostilities in the Iraq war. Tiresome, droll, and completely lacking in imagination, much less any regard for what the audience really wants to see, which is a vigorous prosecution of the War on Terror, which of course means taking it to the islamic extremists who are at war with the civilized world, whether we recognize that fact or not. The show also became increasingly lazy and stupid, as you find yourself asking more and more frequently, ""Now why would they do that?"" I would have recommended ramping up the sex, since Cinemax is pretty much all about soft core porn, and making the show a comedy. Maybe call it something like ""If Bill Clinton worked for MI6."" Thus, this mess is a failed concept and a missed opportunity.",1483833600,3,1027,4.807909604519774
4823926,3,B005LAJ140,"The acting is a bit off at times but the series is pretty good. The word over-sexed comes to mind with one character and is a bit unbelievable. All things said, I will continue watching.",1483833600,,186,4.3428571428571425

4823928,5,B005LAJ140,"Strike back is the best TV show that I'd ever watched. Storylines were superb (well except the last season.....), their fighting scenes were amazing (looks to me that casts surely spent lengthy quality time with stunt/military supervisors), and their hardware was interesting to look at (I am a gun nut....) except bunch of nudities, which I guess that they were necessary for the storylines but I think that the show could have done still awesome jobs with fewer those scenes. I strongly recommend Strike back!",1483747200,,511,5.023529411764706

4824011,2,B005LAJ140,The show is predictable and cliched. I got especially bored of Scott's constant sex scenes and the endless number of scenes where Stonebridge and Scott successfully take on 100+ bad guys. The rest of the show is decent and the two actors have good chemistry. Its a shame the writing isn't better.,1483660800,,296,4.711538461538462

I'll say this.....highly enjoyable,  there's a lot to see and think about. It just gets better as the seasons progress. Real politik with a thong. Thing is, folks get killed. Sometimes there ain't calvary over the hill. I reckon that's why I regard this series so highly. There's some real world situations posited, and the solutions are messy.

Essentially, this series is about a special forces unit that kills trouble makers. No real other way of explaining it. Nope, it's not even clear who is right at times. What you have to understand watching this is that your comfortable world actually depends on real life folks like this.",1481846400,,779,4.893939393939394

4825978,5,B005LAJ140,"Years ago, there was an excellent tv series on British television called ""The Sandbaggers,"" showing how the intelligence community really worked on the ground, with Orwell's ""rough men"" doing bad things to bad people.

Take that, ramp it up with modern technology - great ops room - and match it with smart guys using guns and explosive - lots of guns, lots of explosives - with some of the most expert stunt work in this field you will see. Now, add two guys - one, classic upper class (meritocratic) SAS/MI-6 type, and another, bit of a wild man, ex Delta Force, great with the ladies. Then, add a smart women to do the thinking - Amanda Mealing is perfect.

Mix with bad people doing bad things, and you have a masterfully directed series, one that is well worth watching.

This is based in Capetown, South Africa (great scenery!) , but they go all over the hemisphere, particularly the rougher parts of Africa, so you get a travel show, and, as this is partnered with CINEMAX, there are a lot of really good looking women.

But you knew that, right?

Added bonus: they use Czech vz. 58/2008 rifles as their go-to's in many cases - by far a better firearm than the AK.",1476921600,,383,4.731343283582089

4826041,1,B005LAJ140,"The casting was way too Hollywood. The women were all size six or less, with boobs prominently featured - even the colonel wore a tight T shirt. The male stars were both chiseled specimens. There wasn't a real looking, homely person on the set. The sex scenes between Scott and his many conquests were way overdone and boy did they milk the nudity. But even worse was their attempt to show Scott getting serious about a woman. That was nauseating. The sex alternated with the scenes of gratuitous violence, which got more and more implausible, as Scott and Stonebridge took on armies of opponents. It was a good series to fall asleep by, but eventually, we got impatient with the silly formula.",1476748800,4,694,4.69672131147541

The salty language is authentic and the sex scenes are rather joyous, even amusing,, without being gratuitous,.

Great show so far with a lot of action and suspense, along the lines of something like Homeland, minus the main character constantly falling in love with the terrorist...but I digress.  The show doesn't get into serious character development, but let's face it.....we're watching for the action.  Be warned though....this is a Cinimax show.  As such, there are at least 2-3 sex scenes in each episode that could pass themselves off as softcore pornography.

Thanks to one of the comments on the Strike Back page on Amazon, I found out that this is actually the second season which explains the way this season started. If you really want to immerse yourself in the Strike Back universe, go out and find season 1. I believe its under the title ""Chris Ryan's Strike Back"" or airing on Cinemax as Strike Back: Origins. It's still a good show but I wished Amazon had included that season under the Prime banner. Otherwise the leads are great and the action is non-stop!

4826889,4,B005LAJ140,"This show grabbed me early on when the hotel was swarmed by a group of armed terrorists.  Scott , after shooting two terrorists in the hotel room, picks up BOTH MACHINE GUNS from the dead guys and goes  on to fight off the rest of the group.  Characters in similar situations, in other shows, would only grab ONE of the guns to go running after the bad guys with. I've screamed at my TV many times because of this.  Then, as I continued watching a few more episodes I noticed that the ""heroes""  REGULARLY get ""captured"" by the bad guys while on their headsets (in the middle of a mission) talking to the crib (home base) or each other.  Now I'm yelling at my TV again.

If you're looking for a Breaking Bad caliber show, you're in the wrong place. However, if you want a fun action packed adventure show that you can watch while sorting your laundry (without fear of missing some critical moment), this is for you. It has a significant amount of awesomeness, like the ""picking up both guns"" example mentioned above, but it  also contains its fair share of stupid things to keep the drama unfolding.",1472774400,2,1098,4.455

sexual ""voyeurism"" diminishes what could  have been an interesting story line.  it would be understandable that the ""agents"", being in a country that includes
""sexual tourism"" as an enticement for travel would perhaps find themselves on occasion in bar, club or similar venue where nudity and nude dancing was visible
and ""adds"" to the story line. perhaps the scriptwriters ascribe to Freudian concept of a correlation between ""sex & violence""; because...  if that is what you are looking for this

Two very likable heroes, who have the back and forth jabber down pat like ""real"" old time friends would, are perfect for the story's premise.  The story lines in each of the episodes are ones that keep you interested through out.  There are two main things that get tiring after a while:  1) the requisite sex scene in EVERY episode (I don't think it's necessary nor does it really add to the story) and 2) the extreme violence (I understand that the premise of the story is to fight terrorists, but every episode doesn't need to have 10-15 minute automatic rifle/gun battles.",1471132800,,633,4.625

It doesn't have anything close to the writing quality of, say, Homeland. If you're the kind of person who likes Dolph Lundgren movies, you'll likely enjoy this show.
