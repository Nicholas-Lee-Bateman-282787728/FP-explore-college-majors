Along with understanding that he harbors a phantom inside of him in which makes him into a symbiote; he has to deal with that one day, he must kill the other symbiotes within the Tokko organization he now considers friends. -summary

Tokko volume three contains the final episodes of the series 10 - 13. Directed by Masashi Abe and based on the manga written by Tohru Fujisawa; the series is an action anime that dabbles in the supernatural as well as Japanese mysticism. It follows a group of individuals whom must battle against monsters controlled by demons that seek to devour their human victims. The problem with the series through out is that it suffered from stale characters, bad pacing, bad story progression, and poor interactions. The interactions especially can fail to register with most serious viewers that demand a lot from their entertainment. This final volume fixes some of these ailments and manages to pick up some steam, but the rushed and unfinished ending clearly annihilates whatever progress the anime has made, which results in a complete waste of five hours worth of time. I was told by reliable sources that the manga was unfinished as well. I really hate this about the anime genre; I want some closure for the money and time I spend. Why go through the trouble of bringing a manga to life through animation if there's no chance on finishing it? The anime was released in 2006 and it hit US shores in 2007, this is more than enough reason to avoid it since you're not going to get a satisfying ending.

The plot picks up as the main antagonist by the name of Taishi makes his appearance. His motives are rather unclear, but one thing for certain is that he has an interest in Ranmaru. The character interactions see some positive progress as things develop between Ranmaru and Sakura. These few minutes of them together completely blows away everything seen before this. It's sad in a way that this near stranger has more chemistry with Ranmaru than his own sister Saya, and outside of more development concerning the monsters and even Sakura as she must combat her symbiote brother, there really isn't much else to look forward to; and whatever interesting story elements that do come across, they're not well developed plus the ending really doesn't solve anything.

In addition to all of the other ailments such as characters, etc., Tokko crumbles underneath everything it wants to do. There is plenty of potential and it feels like there was some type of plan leading towards something grand, but you're just left with nothing. Ranmaru meets a couple of symbiotes working as demon hunters outside of Tokko. They claim to increase their powers by actually eating the monsters they kill, but nothing is shown or done with this new and even interesting story element. These two characters even seemed as if they had potential to be better than the main characters. Unfortunately, they make a couple of token appearances and just go away. Something I failed to mention in the earlier volumes is how predictable the story is; it's too obvious what's going to happen and who could be working something behind the scenes. This anime is just badly written.

The production values is the only area it truly shines and not really by much either. The animation still takes plenty of shortcuts with the action consisting of sword swipes across dark screens followed by body parts, which definitely grows boring when it's one scene after the other like this. However, there are times that the action scenes are brutal and cool, with some decent exchanges. Demons will be cut to pieces in detail plus getting blades straight through the head. It's a shame the viewer doesn't get more of this. I saw a professional review once stating that this anime is an unrelenting blood bath, and it's one of the most violent series ever created. Do not buy into this, the violence is pretty tame when considering how violent this genre can really be. The only people I can see dropping jaws to this are newbies. The final episode looks really cool as Ranmaru travels to the underworld, and the backgrounds fall into a hazy, dream like setting taking place in a flipside like version of the real world. I also saw this in English, and the voice acting was a little better in the final episodes with some angry interactions that did register. Unfortunately, I can't really point out anyone specific since none of the actors really stood out. The performances were still on the average side.

Overall, Tokko is a waste of time; I still can't believe that I thought this anime was at least decent at one point because it's not. The characters are poor, the action isn't really great, pacing is bad, nothing seriously worth noting occurs until about episode 10, and it's unfinished. Does this sound like a good anime to you? I don't recommend this at all unless you're the anime ga-ga type. I would advise to spend ten hours plus of your time watching Speed Grapher, Basilisk, or even Death Note. Three anime series far superior to this.
