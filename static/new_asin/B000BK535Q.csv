Carl Davis has composed very attractive music for the ballet which has woven in it Christmas music and what appears to be traditional ballads of the times. The ballads depict the unfortunate conditions of the poor. All this adds greatly to the impact of the ballet (There are even optional subtitles for the singing which are really not needed because the diction is so good). The choreography, staging, filming and performance are excellent!",1153008000,5,480,5.0125
2420893,5,B000BK535Q,"There are many great classical stories and fairy tales that are aching to be choreographed and this one need wait no longer.  Just in time for the holidays we have this ballet version of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"".  It sticks to the well known story with no unusual surprises.  It features beautiful costumes, sets, and music with plenty of interesting dancing of a modern ballet flavor.  If you want to see a brand new story ballet about Christmas (of course, the story is actually about epiphany and redemption and not about religion) give this a try!",1132185600,6,563,4.77319587628866

8087583,5,B000BK535Q,Very nice DVD!  Am a big Charles Dickens fan.  This version did not disappoint!!,1424044800,,80,4.642857142857143
8087584,4,B000BK535Q,"This is a unique version of The Christmas Carol! Not a version for ""movie night"" but if you truly appreciate the Ebenezer Scrooge of Christmas and are a collector, you will love having this dvd.  The costumes are great and its interesting to see how they adapted it to a stage setting with ""opera"" music and no lines to speak.",1375401600,,326,4.433333333333334
8087585,5,B000BK535Q,"A Christmas Carol ballet, with music by Carl Davis is simply a must own. The music, the dancing, the costumes all contribute to 86 minutes of pure joy. I had tears at the end. I am surprised that this ballet has not been performed more often, it certainly deserves to become part of the ballet repertoire, alongside The Nutcracker. I am greatful that this DVD exists. My list wish would include a Blu-ray version along with a complete recording of the score on CD. Highly recommended!!!",1356307200,,486,4.662790697674419
8087586,5,B000BK535Q,"I have always enjoyed this on a once-a-year basis and as fairly light entertainment. A ballet equivalent of a stage musical say.

On this basis I played this recording to my class of 8-9 year olds as the Christmas DVD treat for years while other classes watched the latest DVD blockbuster. My class regularly watched transfixed (yes - even the football obsessed boys) and emerged at playtime happy while other classes clearly became bored and restless. Why? Well it had the advantage of being a truly different experience, the story was very familiar, there were no tutus, the dancing was energetic and modern. In short, it was fresh and had entertainment value.

Don't expect music of the calibre of Stravinsky or a masterpiece such as Swan Lake, just to mention two irrelevant comparisons, but do expect a good entertainment.

The format is 4.3 and the sound is in good stereo only so it could benefit from a re-make - perhaps coupled with a re-make of the Simple Man ballet. Now there would be an attractive proposition!

In the meantime this is a unique presentation and is uniquely entertaining!",1343088000,,1100,4.835106382978723
8087587,3,B000BK535Q,We collect Christmas Carol movies to show all through December at home so this was a nice change. It is a little different but we enjoy ballet so it was fun to see. Not one of my favorites but worth watching and owning.,1232409600,,219,4.116279069767442
8087588,5,B000BK535Q,"This version combines ballet dancing, stage and video effects, costuming, acting (pantomiming) and singing, to produce a spectacular Christmas movie.

Unfortunately, I didn't recognize any of the carols in it.  However, my room-mate recognized ""The Boar's Head Carol,"" which I since discovered has been popular in Great Britain since the sixteenth century.  During this song, dancers carry around a charger with a large boar's head on it.

Besides the unusual songs (to my uneducated ear), another thing that struck me as unique about this version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" is that it's the only one I can think of which included simulated sex scenes by ""prostitutes"" in the pawn shop scene introduced by the Gost of Christmas Yet-to-Come!  Not to worry!  This scene isn't too graphic for minors, although I would suggest parental guidance.

Everything about this production is spectacular!  For me, the only thing missing is dialogue, which you can interject, if you're familiar with the novel, anyway.

This version compares favorably to the version starring Kelsey Grammar and Jennifer Love Hewitt - the main difference being that Kelsey's version includes speaking parts.  I regard this version as the most spectacular I've ever scene!",1231891200,3,1237,5.297435897435897
8087589,5,B000BK535Q,"There have been many versions of Dickens' classic story of holiday redemption, ""A Christmas Carol,"" but there are none quite as unique or as beautiful as this ballet version performed by the Northern Ballet Theatre.  With dynamic music composed by Carl Davis, this wonderful dance piece recounts the already familiar tale of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge and his reconnection to the world through the haunting visitations of various Christmas ghosts.  From its opening chant of ""Marley is dead"" to the heart warming finale where Scrooge sees a final farewell from his spiritual rescuers, this event is a treat for the eye and ear.  The sets are impressive, yet functional with even the set changes done in a balletic style.  The costumes also are impressive.  One such example is the Ghost of Chistmas Yet to Come who becomes a truly terrifying image with its skull face peering out of a black hood complete with huge dark angelic wings and scythe. The ensemble dance group do a beautiful job in interpreting Davis' music, as well as Dickens' powerful tale.  Needless to say, this is an excellent production and well worth your time.",1229904000,5,1132,4.931578947368421
