8134272,5,B000GRUR4Q,"I loved it. I was not sure at first but after a time, I started to really appreciate the story and Della Reese is a fine actress. She was perfect for this part. So much love. Relationships are complicated but with prayer, love can move mountains. The story is about a Pastors wife who loses him to death and her world just seems to fall apart. But it is also a story of a group of people in a Church who love each other and fight for each other
then ultimately open their hearts and love each other through every trial. This is not a religious movie, nor preachy but the love Jesus blesses us with is there. There is a beautiful twist at the end. Enjoy!!!",1513123200,,655,4.165354330708661

8134278,2,B000GRUR4Q,"Very slow movie that never really went anywhere. It was interesting to see the lack of continuity as well. One minute there are cars from the 1950's on the road, and the next minute there is a PC on the desk.

The scenery surrounding the church, and the church itself was beautiful!",1188172800,3,282,4.423076923076923
