1023572,5,6305306141,"This is the only non-documentary film that I know of to capture anything of the life in Detroit experience. It is a must-see film for anyone who's spent any serious time in Motown. There are classic Detroit scenes such the  drive up the Cobo Hall ramp, a dialogue scene in the Michigan Sports Hall  of Fame inside Cobo, the old Top Hat Coney off Grand Circus Park, a  functioning Book-Cadillac Hotel, a skyline before the RenCen, and even a  B.C./Marathon sticker and Detroit Tigers ""Bill Freehan in action""  calendar! This film has early-70s Detroit written all over it. Yet, this  film also goes beyond its local setting as well. Its no wonder Tarantino  has a special regard for this film. It shows the racial hypocrisy of  institutions and the establishment. There is racial opportunism and strife  among the politicians and police chiefs. So it is no mistake that the  criminals in this film are the only ones racially mixed working in  cohesion. The final chase scene is not actually a chase but a slaughter  akin to the S.W.A.T./Patty Hearst scene. All the establishment figures are  out for themselves, yet they lie continually about racial harmony to hide  their ambitions. The thieves are out for themselves yet they're together  and have put aside their racial differences. This is a unique film. Too bad  the acting wasn't better. Also the editing is a bit staid. Once you get  behind these rough spots you'll see a film with a very compelling story  line.",951955200,5,1468,4.804
1023573,2,6305306141,"I happened across this one in the university theatre a month or two ago.  It's definitely worth a laugh, and would make for an amusing evening at  home.  But greatest on foot chase of all time?  Give me a break.
You'll  probably enjoy, as I did, the made-more-than-a-little obvious racial  tension.  I sure did.  And I'm a honkey.",941414400,2,330,4.568965517241379
1023574,5,6305306141,"This movie would have never caught my eye if it wasn't for Tarantino.  I'm a huge fan of Tarantino, but I can't honestly see what Tarantino did to make it better, except put his name on it to get people to buy this classic  film.  The pure acting of Scatman Crothers and Alex Rocco make this movie  flow.  It has a wonderful plot and dealt with racial and other real issues.  I think it wasn't that big of a hit when it was first released because  people just didn't want to see films like that then.  Today on the other  hand, as Tarantino realized, people love films such as Detroit 9000.  Absolutely brilliant!",938649600,5,613,4.345132743362832
1023575,2,6305306141,"After seeing a preview in a theatre of this re-release, I was intrigued, mainly because it didn't have any of the usual '70s black action stars (Fred Williamson, Richard Roundtree, et al) in it. I though maybe this was  The Great Lost Blaxploitation Film. I was wrong. It's just not that great.  It's got a good plot and good intentions, but a mediocre script, some  remarkably gratuitous scenes of violence and nudity (even for this genre)  and atrocious acting by everybody except the two leads (who struggle  valiantly but in vain) keep this on the level of a cheap made-for-TV movie.  Sorry, folks, it just doesn't live up to the hype.",938131200,4,639,4.711711711711712

1023754,3,6305306141,"There is a fund-raising party in Detroit to support a politician who wants to be the next governor. But a half-dozen masked men show up and rob the attendees of their money and jewelry. They make a getaway, the police are under pressure to solve the crime in a few days. The Detroit river police pull a trunk out of the river. The body had its legs cut off. One was cleanly done as if by a surgeon, the other leg was crudely cut off with a hacksaw. Is there a connection here to the crime?

The police lieutenant begins to check out sources of information. We see his personal life, a wife who is permanently hospitalized. There are the usual shoot-outs, killings, and car chases that are the on the menu of any Hollywood action picture set in a city. We learn how that gang knew about that party. A canary tries to help an old friend, and suffers the usual fate. Each gang member is discovered, chased in a running gun battle, then dies in a flurry of gun shots.

One detective learns where the loot was hidden and where it was supposed to go to avoid the usual police searches. The lieutenant takes the suitcase to find the head of the organization. But he overlooked one minor detail. There is another chase and shoot-out to get the rest of the gang, a typical ending to these kinds of films.

The background scenes show Detroit, but it could have been any other big city. This is a good action film, but not as interesting as ""The Asphalt Jungle"". The language reflects the 1970s. If it had been made in the 1930s it would probably have been set in the Wild West.",1220486400,,1567,4.341296928327645
1023755,4,6305306141,"Tough, gritty crime drama; finally gave Hari Rhodes a shot at starring role (remember him as the early on drug pusher in ""Sharkey's Machine?).  One of the better flix from the so-called blaxplotation era.",1188172800,,204,5.0
1023756,4,6305306141,"Probably never gonna be a famous ""must see"" type movie, but a whale of an entertaining piece this is! We rarely get to see the Motor City in the distinction as the prime locale for a major film, but this proves to be a notable and entertaining exception.  No real Hollywood high profile stars here: Alex Rocco, Vonetta McGee and Hari Rhodes are the headliners closest to that category.  Nonetheless, it is a fast paced tour-de-force of Police corruption and Black Power machinations in an era of nascent political upheaval. Add to that a cleverly conceived and executed heist scene and you have the makings of a very absorbing melodrama.

  What I appreciate about this movie in particular is its cut-to-the-chase and tell-it-like-it-is dialog, eschewing all the fancy Hollywood glamour patter in favor of real life good and bad guys (can you tell the difference?) just trying to take care of business. The story line is fast paced, well thought out and executed, although the chase scenes are a bit too drawn out. The aforementioned principals each do his/her part to carry out the demands of that story line.  The not-so-famous supporting actors come across very well also, adding a distinct Detroit flavor to the production. Also, check out the ending: what do you think?
  If you get a chance, add it to your video collection.",1126656000,2,1330,4.853982300884955
1023757,5,6305306141,"This crime drama/mystery is set in a post-riot Detroit, and touches on many issues that Motown has yet to resolve.

First we have an elegant, well scripted political fundraiser for the potential first black governor of Michigan. This event is held at the still open Book-Caddilac Hotel, and you will see a number of Detroit landmarks in this film that were still in use at this time (1973), and today they are either gone (Union Depot, JL Hudson), or remaining as a ruin (Caddilac Hotel).

The event is robbed and the first charge made is that if this was a ""white"" event there would have been a better police pressance to protect it.  That about sets the tone for this movie.............

A veteran white detective, gets paired with a younger, black rising star to solve the crime.  In the interim we are shown the world of lingering racism, black on black exploitation, and the ever corupt world of politcs no matter what race the politicians are, and the politics of religon (no that is far from a new concept).

This movie is VERY graphic in the chase scene (most of it filmed on the approach trackage to the then already closed Union Depot), and the business side sex is featured as well.

A very well done film (rescued by Quentin Taratino) that is far above the ""Blacksploitation"" film genre of the 1970's. A strong soundtrack adds the perfect background for many of the scenes, and the group of singers at the hotel, after the bobbery add a touch of the macrabe to the aftermath.

.and Detroit continues to grapple with these issues today.

1023758,2,6305306141,"This movie starts out alright, with some good chase scenes and a few shoot-outs, but then it just becomes incredibly boring. Detroit 9000 becomes so slow paced, that it will put you to sleep.

1023759,5,6305306141,"This movie is truly more than a standard exploitation flick (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Sure, there's some stilted acting and neon orange blood, but beyond that there's a pretty darn good story, and some of the best location shots of Detroit next to ""8 Mile"".  The plot twists will actually surprise you, and the amount of locations will make you wonder how they got enough money to pull this off.  ""Detroit 9000"" is the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" of Blaxploitation, in that it goes beyond the genre but still keeps the mainstays intact.  Highly recommended, although I wish the dvd had more (any) special features.  Epic.",1073779200,2,646,4.889908256880734

1023761,5,6305306141,"This is classic Blacksploitation! I am such a huge fan of the genre, that when I heard a soundbite from Detroit 9000 on the Jackie Brown soundtrack,  I knew that I had to see the movie. And, even better, it had Quentin  Tarantino's stamp of approval. More than enough for me!
A gritty, tell  it like it is white cop is assigned to find the men who robbed the  fundraiser for the first black man to run for Govenor of the state of  Michigan. When he realizes that he can't do it alone, he reluctantly agrees  to let a young black cop, who happens to be an up-and-comer, help him out.  What follows is a mess of gun fights, funky music, and dead pimps. All  culminating in probably one of the biggest shootouts/chase scenes in film  history!  My jaw was dropped and my eyes were open in amazement as Detroit  cops and the robbers chased each other all over town whilst expending  thousands of rounds of ammo. The ending came as quite a surprise, and  nothing that I had seen coming. This film is a very good movie, especially  for blacksploitation, and it is a total blast. I watched this on a Friday  night with some friends, made some remarks(ala Mystery Science Theater  3000), and totally had a great time. If you like blackploitation, see this.  If you like action films, with millions of bullets, and bloody gunfights,  see this. And if you like cop movies with great chase scenes, see this!  I would love it if Tarantino remade this film, and put Sam Jackson in it. A  lot of fun, and worth your time.

7889031,3,6305306141,"Rediscovered by Quentin Tarantino, ""Detroit 9000"" is a flawed yet admirable 1973 crime drama propelled by solid portrayals from Alex Rocco and Hari Rhodes. Tough and surprisingly intelligent, the film rises above its ""grindhouse"" categorization. However, Orville Hampton's ambitious screenplay juggles a few too many characters and subplots.

7889032,3,6305306141,"This came out 2 years after ""The French Connection"" and it tries to capture that 'on the street' gritty cop drama. The results are mixed.

Here's the scoop. Lieutenant Danny Basset (Alex Rocco) is a detective in Detroit who suffers from bad sinuses, is living paycheck to paycheck to take care of an ailing wife, and is just grinding it out. A huge heist has taken place at a political fund raiser and Danny is put on the case with a new, black, up and coming detective (Hari Rhodes). They're not the best of partners but they shoulder to the task.

Like ""The French Connection"" this is not a flashy, glitzy cop thriller. These guys go after the case with rudimentary police work. They follow leads, interview people and put the pieces together. This movie depicts a booming Detroit. The auto industry is healthy. People of color have money. Fancy clothes, clubs and good times rule the day, but the black vs. white rift continues. Harry is not thrilled with working a case with a black cop. He sees it as a lose/lose situation, whether or not he cracks the case. Rhodes is Okay with it. He knows he's on his way up. This takes you to street level. In the clubs, the brothels and even into Canada. The cinematography is gritty. It brings the viewer right into the action. And some of the writing is rough. Today's viewer might wince at how these people talk to one another. This is all good but some of the dialogue and script points are clumsy. Some of the directing, particularly the action scenes, is clunky. Some better directing, and a script doctor could have elevated this to a far higher level.

This is a decent enough watch, if only for it's spotlight on the time and place. It's a decent snapshot of the zeitgeist. Don't put it at the top of your 'to watch' list, but don't dismiss it out of hand either.",1372982400,,1815,4.477341389728097

Then the rest of the movie is trying to figure out who has seen or heard anything about this caper on the streets. A chase / shootout scene at the end and wondering if the white cop on the case was crooked or not. Only thing interesting about this movie is seeing the Detroit skyline missing the renaissance building since ive spent alot of time there since 2006. To wrap this review up if you are thinking about viewing this movie DON'T ! you can find something better to do with your time i'm sure.,1303084800,,760,4.141891891891892
