2706864,5,B000LC4WPQ,"Greetings,

This is one of the best movie I saw. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll want more.

The dvd suplement is a must to watch. The letter format to describe the movie making is almost as good as the movie.

It looks expensive, but it is worth the price. If you don't want to own it, just rent it at Netflix.

Thank you",1181520000,2,326,4.046875
2706865,5,B000LC4WPQ,"It's only too obvious why this short film won the Oscar for Best Live Action Short in 2004 - because it's a true work of art. Most people never get to see the projects that win such categories - but Director Aaron Schneider has given us this wonderful gift in bringing the film to DVD.  Mr. Schneider shows he can take a labor of love project and turn it into a world class production that rivals anything on the big screen. The film will make you laugh, remember, think, cry, and has an uncanny ability to take you right back to Mississippi of 1941. Jonathan Furr as Willie turns in an award winning performance himself that will endear his character to you - keep an eye out for this young man for sure! Schneider's attention to detail, not only in the film itself, but especially in the feature packed DVD, are to be commended as it's rare to see such care and attention taken for a short film. The special features and THREE commentaries from Director, Producers, crew and cast on the DVD give a rare glimpse into the world of making a short film - working on a limited budget and often with the help of favors, freebies, grants, and a lot of hard work by a cast and crew who obviously believe in Schneider and his vision for the project and story. Get this DVD by all means while you can - it will someday be a collector's item when Schneider's name is a household word next to the great directors of our time.",1130716800,8,1415,4.319548872180451
2706866,5,B000LC4WPQ,"This film is awesome. From the direction, to acting to musical score, etc etc. You will want to watch again and again. I can't wait for more from director, Aaron Schneider. He'll be around for a while.",1130198400,,201,4.45945945945946
8161580,5,B000LC4WPQ,"""Two Soldiers,"" though not a typical Faulkner short story, remains one of my favorites and is one I like to read in my American Lit. class because it is a simpler introduction to the author. I bought the short film to see how well it aligns with the story, and I found it to be fairly faithful. The changes that have been made are understandable and will offer good discussion for what works in a short story vs. a short film. It's beautifully made and faithfully presents the heart of the story of these two brothers. I actually cried for most of the film the first time I watched it.",1409616000,,585,4.327272727272727

8161583,5,B000LC4WPQ,"If there is a better short film I haven't seen it.  It there has ever been a more poignant film I'm not aware of it.  If there has ever been a more touching acting job than this kid did, I've never heard of it.  I'm not a big Faulker fan but if this story was all he ever wrote he deserves a prize.  Not only is this a great little film, it is an important one.  It says so much about love, honor, loyalty and patriotism.  We bought several copies to give to our friends.",1252108800,,471,3.905263157894737

8161585,5,B000LC4WPQ,"I loved this story. There are a couple lines which are difficult to hear, unfortunately. Others watched this with me and agreed. The characters are cast perfectly. Emotion pours out at the recruiting office when the brothers connect. I've watched that segment over and over. This is a great tale of brothers. The little boy is great. Ron Perlman plays a sensitive role. The older brother is loving, too. I highly recommend it. It is only 40 minutes long and has some great scenes.",1238544000,,480,4.726190476190476
8161586,5,B000LC4WPQ,"The DVD released 5/22/2007 of this 2003 Oscar winning 40 minute short film is identical to the DVD released 11/22/2005 except for minute artwork changes (one line note at the bottom of the front of the 2007 DVD case is two lines on the 2005 DVD). The same special features on both are a real plus: 3 commentary tracks, behind the scenes documentary, image gallery, 21 minutes from the film featuring Alan Silvestri's music without film dialogue, and anamorphic widescreen 1.85:1 aspect.",1228780800,5,486,4.939024390243903
8161587,5,B000LC4WPQ,"""Two Soldiers"" is a short (40 minute) film that follows the relationship between two brothers as the older one prepares for war while the much younger brother is left to deal with trying to understand what is happening.  The film was made with the assistance of faculty and staff from the Film School at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and showcases the skill of these students as they contributed to this Oscar winning (Best Live Action Short Film of 2004).  It is a very moving film and one that you will enjoy watching over and over.  I first saw this film at the RiverRun International Film Festival and was delighted to purchase a copy when it was finally released on DVD.",1227484800,2,697,4.56
8161588,5,B000LC4WPQ,"Stumbled upon this one and what a great flick it is.  Not a war movie, but such fine and natural acting. In his small part, Ron Perlman is fantantic in his understated way.  Spend the 42 min. to watch this beauty!",1217980800,,213,4.170731707317073
8161589,5,B000LC4WPQ,This is a great short film about family and war. I enjoyed working on this film in the art department and enjoy it even more as a master piece of modern short story turned film. I you have anyone in the US service fighting the good fight you will cry as you watch this movie. The sets and colors are just great and make you feel like your in the farm land of North Carolina. The greatest state in North America!,1191456000,7,411,4.08641975308642
