The cast is great.. the acting is wonderful, and so is the soundtrack.  A++",1407110400,,327,3.9846153846153847

1848177,5,B00008J2EA,I bought this movie because it has been a favorite of mine since first seeing it long ago.  I was excited to be able to purchase it but forgot to check if it was in letterbox and it wasn't.  Otherwise I recommend this heartwarming movie about true to life issues.,1367712000,,263,4.24
1848178,5,B00008J2EA,"How, can any Movie go wrong when Glen Close is in it, she is such a great actress, makes every movie she's in so enjoyable to watch. This was probably not one of her more spectacular films, but certainly very enjoyable to watch.",1360022400,,228,4.325581395348837

1848180,1,B00008J2EA,"I rented this mainly because of the good reviews and the strong cast.  Unfortunately the cast didn't have much to work with here.  The pacing of the film is very slow, you could walk out of the room for 20 minutes and not miss much. I would put it on the same level as a D grade Lifetime Network made for TV job.  Sorry.",1314835200,,320,3.96875

1848187,5,B00008J2EA,"This is a great movie!  My sister and I used to watch this a long-time ago when we were just kids and I remember how touching it was then.  This is a ""gotta have"" movie!",1217030400,3,169,3.8
1848188,5,B00008J2EA,"I watched this touching movie today and was absolutely riveted from start to finish. Glenn Close and James Woods play a successful couple who after 11 years of marriage still find themselves unable to have a child. They tire of medical attempts and finally decide to adopt a child. Mary Stuart Masterson and Kevin Dillon play teen parents-to-be who realise they can't raise a kid and decide to give their soon to be born baby up for adoption.

This is an emotionally heart-wrenching movie about the joys and pitfalls of adopting, on both the biological and adoptive parents. All the lead actors have done an amazing job in portraying the emotional fragility that each character goes through in the process. Glenn Close is so subtle yet riveting in her performance as a woman desperately yearning to have a baby and experience motherhood. It is a performance I shall not forget anytime soon. Her husband as played by James Woods is tender and credible in his role. Mary Stuart Masterson conveys all the fears and hopes of an unwed teen mother with a high degree of realism.

All in all, this is a wonderfully poignant family drama that will touch your heart.",1214179200,11,1157,4.751243781094527
1848189,5,B00008J2EA,I had never heard of this movie when I stumbled across it on TV years ago and it really moved me. I have recommended it to dozens of people over the years.  It is very well done and very poignant.,1190592000,3,196,3.9
