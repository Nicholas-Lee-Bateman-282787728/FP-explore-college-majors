5441599,5,B00AJLHVES,"My bf got me the dvd, but i haven't watched it yet. I am glad that Tyler Perry put this play out on dvd",1360022400,,103,3.3333333333333335
5441600,5,B00AJLHVES,"I've been a Tyler Perry fan since day one. He never lets me down with any of his work (especially his plays). Tyler has recieved his fair share of positive & negative criticism for his Madea character over the years. Madea is what made Tyler a household name. Fans come out in droves to support anything with Madea's name attached to it. I can almost guarantee that everyone will fall in love with this tell it like it is play! This is a great play with outstanding singing & a powerful message. The play is set in a nursing home in which Madea was ordered to do 20 hours of community service. As usual Madea gets things in order in grand slam fashion. We'll know Tyler lossed his mom a few years ago. I remember reading an interview in which Tyler said his mother told him on her dying bed to keep his Madea character alive no matter what the naysayers think. I don't care how many times times this man's name is dragged through the mud or how redundant his messages can be @ times. I'm 25 year's old. Madea always leaves me with a message that pierces my soul! I'll never grow tired of her. This play will make you laugh,cry & jump for joy all @ the same time! I know Tyler said that this is going to be his last Madea play for a while. He's focusing more on his films now. I've no problem with that. I'm a huge fan of his movies & plays. But nothing beats a Madea play live in person. Keep up the good work Tyler! You're my inspiration!",1360022400,72,1439,4.179856115107913
5441601,5,B00AJLHVES,"A great show filled with good singing and plenty of laughter.  Tyler, you did it again.  I watched it twice.",1360022400,35,108,4.35
5441602,5,B00AJLHVES,I saw this play live...TWICE! It was THAT good! I can't wait to see how he changed things on the dvd. He changed the plot on me the second time I saw it so I'm sure the dvd will have a little twist. After years of watching his work onscreen there is absolutely NOTHING like seeing it live! Best experience EVER!!! I can't wait for this DVD.,1359504000,53,340,4.08955223880597

However, in the process of caring for our parents and family we always left feeling that we can do more.
The movie spoke volumes and gives you a focus glimpse into the Time given and the necessary care.
Great spoken words

5442117,3,B00AJLHVES,"Usually Tyler Perry's plays have some good inspirational messages! While I don't mind these messages, I would prefer that they don't encompass the entire play/movie. In this case almost half of the play is spent with Madea giving advice about everything from how to raise children to how to pray.lol. It was like a watered down version of madea.lol
. In my opinion it took away from the play and atmosphere.. It left me feeling disconnected and I lost interest in what was going on in the play.  To make matters worse it ended abruptly with about 30 minutes left still. The last half hour was filled with the cast members singing and dancing. While I didn't mind hearing them sing. I think the play and plot could have been better structured so that the time could have been used to focus on the plot and the play.. Otherwise there was some very funny parts where I laughed out loud. The character Mattie was hilarious! The lady who played her did an outstanding job!  Overall it was just ok but certainly not one of his best plays.",1410652800,,1032,4.5133689839572195

5442203,3,B00AJLHVES,"This is a very entertaining stage play but it just seems like it ended prematurely. I don't want to spoil the play for those who haven't seen it but if you're a Tyler Perry fan you know the formula for his plays: Issues begin, Madea gives her worldly advice, and then you see how the characters solve their problems. Well in Madea Gets A Job, after Madea gives her wisdom the play ends prematurely for a concert. Youre left thinking is this it? Did Mr. Perry get tired of writing or what? I would rate the play 3.5 stars, the play simply needed a better conclusion like his other great work and the concert shouldve been eliminated.",1400976000,,632,4.410256410256411

5442350,5,B00AJLHVES,It was very funny.  It was very realistic with normal and abnormal situations that occur in everyday life. He also did a lot of witnessing in this play to a lot of hurting people.  Which is what God would have us to do as Christians.,1380412800,,233,4.155555555555556

5442356,5,B00AJLHVES,"Tyler Perry outdoes himself in this play. This had more of a Broadway feel. In everything he puts Jesus first and guides others to love and forgive. This play touched on the feelings of abandonment elderly parents may go through when left at an old age home and the array of feelings the son or daughter may be experiencing too. The moral of the story is to love and follow God's will for your dreams because you may wind up wondering where did the time go and why you didn't. Great show. If he has another play, I would love to go see it.",1379116800,,539,4.1923076923076925

I would really like to see him turn one of the actual plays into an actual TV show with the singing and all.

And some of the most incredible singing, live, I said Live On Stage!!!! Down falls....to religiously motivated some parts made you feel like it was a Protestant Show Down. Leave Religion Out, Keep Jesus in, stop the preaching. Mr. Tyler Perry I love your humility in loving Jesus, but at times, it robs from your messages on stage and can distort your script as being overly preachy. I love your work, I appreciate and respect your work. But sometimes, We want to hear your wisdom- Don't drown it out by being too overwhelming about your faith.
Okay enough said!- ALL THE ACTORS WERE GREAT! All the songs were sung with such great power and force and deeply moving, All the life stories, Hopeful, sad, and inspiring. There is Hope in Mr. Perrys' heart. As a survivor of child abuse myself, Hope and faith is all we have left to heal the damage caused by abuse. I hope one day Mr. Perry you can include (male survivors) in one of your stories. Amazing. I want to give it five Stars...(it deserves it) like I said...The Protestant Preaching was a bit much for me....",1372464000,,1319,4.785087719298246

I ended up buying it after renting it.  Definitely something to have in your archive.",1369353600,,257,4.382978723404255
5442492,5,B00AJLHVES,"I really love Tyler Perry's movies. This one, I had my doubts, as the format is a Play, rather than movie---but it's wonderful. Good musical numbers, written in the usual Perry style---funny, amusing, and always lessons to be learned. I think this is one of his best.",1369180800,,267,4.702127659574468
5442493,5,B00AJLHVES,Tyler Perry really ministered in this play. I loved this play and the flow that it had. I do not know how to explain it. After seeing this play I was able to get a little more energy to help me pursue my dreams and goals in life.,1369180800,,229,3.7916666666666665

5442498,5,B00AJLHVES,"This play was truly a treat from Mr. Perry, as he gave you a nice two in one deal.  The message and deliverance was truly on point, and he has casted some talented individuals!

5442500,5,B00AJLHVES,Good singing like in other Tyler Perry plays. Good wisdom provided by Madea to a resident of the nursing home as well as some employees. I always enjoy watching Tyler Perry productions. A lot of talent on the stage.,1368316800,,215,4.538461538461538
5442501,3,B00AJLHVES,"Let me start by saying I am a Tyler Perry fan, but this one was not very good.  I gave it 3 stars because it did have some funny moments in it.  Madea was funny, but the chemistry between this character and the others did not seem to connect.  Cheryl ""Pepsi"" Riley's character was a little weak also, she has been quite good in other roles.  I wish I'd rented it for $3 instead of buying it.  I won't say it was terrible, but the laughs were far and few between.  Not his best, but the message was good.",1368230400,,503,4.03030303030303
5442502,5,B00AJLHVES,Love Tyler Perry. I would always recommend his DVD'S to all my family and friends. I love his work and he always has a message in everything he does. I love him for all the hard work he does. Thanks again.,1368230400,,205,4.024390243902439

5442506,2,B00AJLHVES,Tyler Perry's Madea Gets A Job is funny...for about the first thirty minutes. After that it starts to grate on the nerves thanks to Madea preaching too much and too much singing not enough comedy.,1367971200,,196,4.628571428571429
5442507,5,B00AJLHVES,This play is so funny.  But all of them are.  Loved the way it ended.  Much different from the norm. Definite buy.,1367798400,,114,4.090909090909091
5442508,5,B00AJLHVES,I am not a play type of person but this was actually a really good play. All throughout the play there was some valid real life points addressed.  I would highly recommend this to be added to your collection of motivational movies. It drives home the points of trying to make it in this questional world. It made one stop and take a second look at some things that most people forgot. Great play to be watch by all ages.,1367798400,,420,4.25

5442522,5,B00AJLHVES,"Wasn't what I expected.  I love Madea but she was not the focus of this play.  The play is about why people end up in retirement homes.  It focuses on the relationships with the retiree's family and how it affected the reason why they ended up in the home.

The play is emotional but is lightened with levity as with all of Tyler Perry's plays.  Also, at the end of the play Tyler Perry allowed the cast to shine by giving each member a chance to sing a song of their choice to showcase their individual talent.

Very nice.",1367539200,,523,4.232323232323233
5442523,4,B00AJLHVES,Never seen a Madea I didn't like but I don't really care for these plays. Come on Tyler Perry bring the movies back. We all know that Madea is funny as crap but she is not on half the time and its just not as funny in the plays.,1367539200,,228,3.673469387755102

5442525,5,B00AJLHVES,There's not a whole lot to say against this great Director/Producer/Actor.  His movies and plays are a class act all by itself.,1367280000,,127,4.7727272727272725
5442526,5,B00AJLHVES,I love everything that Tyler Perry stars in and produces! What a talented and gifted man. I saw this on stage and it was a scream so had to get the DVD.,1367193600,,152,3.78125

5442543,2,B00AJLHVES,"The sit down long talking in the name of ""counsel"" by the main actor kills the play. Needed far more acting or drama. The people loving Madea, is not an excuse for Tyler to be given the people mediocre stuff just to get them laughing. The people deserve better.",1366934400,,261,4.346938775510204
5442544,5,B00AJLHVES,"I am a big fan of Tyler Perry.  Anything he puts out I try my best to see it. Especially when Madea is in it.  I love the fact that there's always a good lesson to be taught and told.

We need to get back to the positive things and good morales people had back in the days.  Good movie, its a MUST HAVE.",1366934400,,434,3.942528735632184
5442545,5,B00AJLHVES,"What can I say Tyler Perry makes movies that makes you laugh and touch your heart all at the same time. So I can say if Madea can get a JOB, then I can say they rest of us can get a job if it is not ordered by the courts. Even to get a job at Jack In The Box, if you are happy with the job you have, thank God for it and if you are not why do you go to one every day and you are not HAPPY. Thank You Tyler Perry for Madea you/she helps us to laugh when the rest of the world is so sad. And thank you too Amazon, you rock my part of the world, Yuma, Arizona.

5442547,5,B00AJLHVES,"This play is excellent from start to finish, I love the particular message he sends to parents as well in this movie and about

5442551,4,B00AJLHVES,"I really like Tyler Perry's Madea, all his movies, and especially the plays on dvd.  This one included a bit of a concert afterwards, which was unique and different from the normal plays.

5442709,4,B00AJLHVES,"This Tyler Perry play was one of the better ones yet. I didn't like the fact that he seemed a little too relaxed which caused him to come out of character often and then to acknowledge it wasn't good.  That was the only negative for me. I loved the songs and the concert at the end.  Patrice Lovely ""killed"" it.  That woman can ""sang"" as well as act.  The duet with the characters Carson and Barbara was what, I believe, one of the major emotions that the elderly feel in nursing homes.
Mr. Perry had some on time and on point powerful situations with the answers attached. Needless to say, I enjoyed the play.",1363219200,,610,4.324561403508772

5442717,5,B00AJLHVES,"When I was young and the house was quiet, I would steal away to my bedroom and try on my mother's underthings. She caught me a few times admiring myself in the full length mirror. Now, this was the 1960s and I don't have to tell you that it was a different time. The look of disgust on her face was something that has stayed with me to this day.

What I could never tell her is what happened between me and her third husband DeMarcus. He told me I was more to him than my mother could ever be and he liked to do things with me that he said my mother frowned upon. DeMarcus was later killed in a tragic roller coaster accident but there's not a day goes by that I don't think of the moments we shared and all the delicious cherry wine we drank.

In many ways, Tyler Perry has filled my void since DeMarcus passed away. It is a void that is dark and mysterious ... and smells like corn chips. I hope that I can meet Tyler Perry one day because we have so much in common: we love to wear women's clothes, we both KNOW who we really are and we both write in a manner that is neither funny nor compelling.

Come to me, TP!",1363046400,,1117,3.9776785714285716

5442756,5,B00AJLHVES,This particular play is one of Tyler Perry's best and I have seen all of his stage plays.  It especially looks at how older people are dealt with and left alone.  Patrice Lovely is a very talented young woman that plays Hattie and she is very talented she has the best song as far as I am concerned in the play.  I could feel the emotion in her song.  As a young person we don't think about getting old and before we know it we are there.  I can definitely relate.  Thanks Tyler for your message.,1362787200,,496,4.114583333333333

5442770,5,B00AJLHVES,"This was one of Tyler's best performance and although his tour was cancel I am very pleased to have witnessed greatness once again. If you are  undecided about purchasing this play this is a wonderful gift for parents, grandparents and especially for your own personal collection. The musical ending is far the best and it ends the whole play. Great job to Tyler Perry and the cast.

It site is a nursing home and Madea is order to do community service, when you put Maddie and Madea together you can only have an explosive dialouge. The story line was unbelievable and awesome. Get your copy of ""Madea Gets a Job"" you won't regreat it!",1362700800,,636,4.5701754385964914

5442776,5,B00AJLHVES,"Tyler Perry role is as funny as it get and the very fact that this suppose to be elderly ladies is misrepresentation.

5442778,5,B00AJLHVES,"This play was funny and meaningful for the young, middle age and the more mature crowd. Loneliness comes in so many forms and recognizing it is first.

We are still out here for you!",1362441600,,334,4.153846153846154
5442797,5,B00AJLHVES,"I ordered this play for my girlfriend for our anniversary and we both enjoyed watching it. Not only was it hilarious and entertaining; it also provided ""food for thought"" and excellent singing performances from the cast. Regardless of how religious or spiritual a person maybe; Madea puts it out there that one should never lose their faith. At any rate, Madea holds down a job at a nursing home while dishing out her signature brand of humor and knowledge to the ones she interacts with through out the play. For any Tyler Perry fan, this is a must see and needs to be added to their libraries.",1362441600,,595,4.570093457943925

5442823,5,B00AJLHVES,"This is a great play.  There are several mini-dramas and multiple life lessons communicated throughout the play.

5442827,3,B00AJLHVES,"I do like how his stage plays have evolved from set design to script.  I would like to see Tyler actually make a stage play and get away from the musicals.  This had some funny parts to it and an excellent message but its the same content as all the other plays.  There's a crackhead, usually someone who was abused or a women with a broken heart who obtains love from the good brother she over looked.  I gave it three stars because of the message, but I will not put this one in my Madea Weekend repertoire.",1361923200,4,509,4.163265306122449
5442828,4,B00AJLHVES,Tyler Perry plays always have a nice message and fun to watch. You can tell he's making some cash. His plays have changed a little (not for the worst),1361923200,,150,4.206896551724138

5442841,4,B00AJLHVES,"I love all of Tyler Perry's plays.
The movies are great too, but the plays are so funny when the characters
experience unplanned and uncontrollable laughter.

The best play in my opinion is ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"".  hilarious.....lol",1361836800,,238,4.780487804878049
5442842,5,B00AJLHVES,I am still laughing and singing at my desk....Patricia Lovely has added a special touch to this particular showing. God has been a part of this show also.,1361836800,,154,4.535714285714286

5442844,2,B00AJLHVES,"I'm a big fan to Perry's plays. I have all of them on tape and will probably get this one just because. However, it is no where near a funny as his previous plays, the music isn't as good, and there isn't much Madea. The play is a typical Tyler Morality play but this one is simply done with less humor. Unlike the other plays where I sometimes feel a desire to make a weekend of watching them, I don't see myself popping this one into the DVR and just watching as part of my Perry Popcorn weekend.",1361750400,2,498,4.091836734693878
5442845,5,B00AJLHVES,his has to be one of the funniest plays ever i couldn't stop laughing and i watched it 3 times but the thing i like the most is that there is always a moral to the story!!,1361664000,,171,3.6486486486486487
5442846,5,B00AJLHVES,I highly recommed this play. If you like Perrys other plays you will enjoy this one. It comments on dating and baby momma drama. Very funny!,1361664000,,140,4.423076923076923
5442847,5,B00AJLHVES,Tyler Perry does it again! I am so proud of my collection of his plays and movies. Keeps me laughing and has lots of life lessons to learn added in.,1361664000,,148,3.966666666666667
5442848,5,B00AJLHVES,"Wonderful play, actors was off the chain (funny) but a wonderful way to show just how Seniors are placed in a nursing home and forgotten, also how they are put there and forgotten by the family.  Another way to also look at it is they are put there and you eventually feel guilty for putting them there.",1361491200,,303,4.315789473684211
5442849,5,B00AJLHVES,Loved it it was a great watch would watch this again and again Tyler Perry was great it was funny and im gonna buy the blu ray,1361491200,,126,3.7037037037037037

5442852,3,B00AJLHVES,This was good. Madea preaches better than these television preachers. Madea Goes To Jail and What's Done inThe Dark are better than this one.,1361491200,,141,4.916666666666667
5442853,5,B00AJLHVES,"I love Tyler Perry and his work, be it the plays or the actual movies.  Madea is the the best medicine that come to life, she is funny, and keep  you laughing no matter what mood you're in. Madea's laughter is definitely the best medicine for out lives.",1361404800,,253,4.25

5442858,3,B00AJLHVES,"This was very funny but too many mistakes as if this was a practice run. Tyler talked to the audience way to much. Almost more like a a stand up comedy then a play. Good advice and very spiritual. I would still buy the DVD again, but expect a more serious approach that has laughter. This seemed like the last show for the season.",1361232000,2,330,4.171875
5442859,5,B00AJLHVES,"All is there to say is, BUY IT, even if you have seen it, you know you can't get enough, and if you haven't yet, you won't be disappointed...Can Madea ever go wrong ? NO..We def need laughter in this world today. I know I do.",1361232000,,225,3.9130434782608696
5442860,5,B00AJLHVES,I just love this play.  I took my wife to the play when it came to Baltimore.  If you have not seen Tyler Perry live you are missing a treat.  The grand finally at the end was outstanding.  WOW!!!!,1361232000,,197,3.9743589743589745

5442862,5,B00AJLHVES,It is very hard to make me laugh.  By the end of this play I was screaming and shaking with laughter.  Tyler Perry had a few instances where he screwed up like walking out of the wrong door.  It was a hoot.  Don't know where he finds such talented people but they are excellent and Hollywood is missing something by not employing them.  May Tyler live a long time.  My husband and I felt like we were in the theater.  The cost of the DVD is nothing compared to what you get.  Forget all your worries and problems and enjoy the evening.  Madea rules!!!!!,1361145600,,553,4.240384615384615

5442865,4,B00AJLHVES,"I gave it a four because it wasn't great, but it also wasn't horrible. The play began good, and towards the end was all over the place. Madea went from room to room to room, giving each character advice. Which made it boring. Honestly, Hattie (Madea's old friend) made the play good. There was too much singing throughout the place, and the songs were not that great. I loved the ending when the cast dressed in all black and had a concert, singing old school R&B songs. Tyler can sing! I love Jeffery Lewis' voice (and Zuri Craig aka The CraigLewis Band.""",1361145600,2,556,4.46078431372549

5442891,5,B00AJLHVES,"Enjoyed the singing. Mr. Perry's endings are some what predictable. I have seen all but two plays live, and watched all movie form (I paid the right way). Shall continue to support 100%.  I wish some mystery would take place, more surprise endings like; Married 2, and Dairy of Mad Black Woman or Happy Family Reunion or Prey Together.
Yes! I love Surprise endings :))",1360713600,,368,4.661538461538462

5442893,3,B00AJLHVES,The play was okay (typical Tyler Perry). However there was just entirely too much singing and not enough substance. It should have been titled Madea Puts On A Concert. It was a struggle for me to give the play 3 stars. My lady fell asleep and did not finish watching the play even though we had access to the it for 24 hours. A good movie I watch over and over...I watched this one only once....,1360713600,5,395,4.2105263157894735

Although, Tyler Perry playing the leading role of Madea seem to get a little carried away with exaggeration at times;  overall the play was meaningful and thought provoking.  The singing performances was entertaining too.",1360454400,,305,5.425531914893617
5442911,5,B00AJLHVES,I would recommend this to anyone seeking a feel good movie that prompts us to do better toward other people (especially the elderly). They were laughing at themselves on stage and the concert after the play was also great.,1360454400,,222,4.717948717948718
5442912,5,B00AJLHVES,"I was starting to think that Tyler was getting worse at plays and getting better at movies. I wasn't too impressed with the last few plays that he put out, but this one was amazing! I laughed throughout the whole thing! What I love about Tyler's plays is that he always makes sure that he drops some knowledge on us! Whether it's about forgiveness or about dealing with a child who has gone astray, Tyler is always going to give good advice in his plays. I love the jam sessions that he always does at the end as well! He is so amazing, and I also love how he always talks about following your dreams! I love you, Tyler! You are such an inspiration and such a blessing to so many people. Your mother is smiling down on you, and she is so proud! ;)",1360368000,,747,4.158620689655172
5442913,5,B00AJLHVES,"Ths is a MUST SEE. It is soooo funny. If you watch it with someone that you're having issues with, then this play should invoke some conversation and hopefully, after the conversation, you're on the road to healing",1360368000,,214,4.657894736842105

5442930,5,B00AJLHVES,"Tyler Perry plays are great for entertainment and advice on some levels real life things that people face.

5442932,4,B00AJLHVES,"So, I just finished watching the play and I must say that it was pretty good. The play is about Madea being sent to the Easy Rest Retirement Home to do some Community Service. While there, Madea gives some good advice to several people. Now, the play basically follows the same formats of many of his plays; but, it was actually entertaining. I loved seeing Madea and Hattie Mae together again. Why only 4 stars? Well, there are some things that he needs to work on like too many songs and tying up loose ends when it comes to the story. One of the new twists that I loved was at the end it was like an Old Skool party! The only extras on this DVD is the Behind the Curtain with the Cast of Madea Gets a Job. It really is a good play and worth watching.",1360108800,,753,4.094594594594595
