1667964,5,B00005UV34,"This movie has it all....fear, anticipation, and even some humor in the right spots!  When they say it's a ""white knuckle thriller,"" they are right on!  I was on the edge of my seat squeezing my husband's hand the whole time!!",1002153600,,226,4.487804878048781
1667965,1,B00005UV34,"I saw the movie Jeepers Creepers about a week ago. I liked it. I especially liked the truck chases. Anyway, I saw the preview for this movie and at first it looked cool, but then I realized that it looks like a poor take-off of Jeepers Creepers..I mean, the car chase?Where did they get that from? Hmmm... Maybe JEEPERS CREEPERS! Can't the writers of Joy Ride think of their own ideas? And, what about that lame thing the killer says ""You really should get that fixed!""
""What fixed?""
""Your back headlight!"" hahha how lame is that..It may have worked in Scream but I don't think it will work in this movie. My predictions for this movie is that the killer ends up to be some old guy that kills 10 people every 23 years, has a hook thingy he holds in his hand to slash people with, and wears a mask of some ""ghostly image"".. Oh yeah, and he probably wears a raincoat or hat when its not even raining! All I can say is, I'm waiting for this to come on T.V.",1001721600,6,953,4.213114754098361
1667966,3,B00005UV34,"I saw a early screening of Joy Ride and I have to say that this movie is made in the vein of the 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' flicks. After all, they are pursued by a psychotic truck driver who they had a played a prank on. Honestly, I didn't think this is the best horror flick I have ever seen. But it warrants to be a must see if you are looking for a decent horror flick. As for the script, at points you can infer that something is going to happen, and it does. It is not to say the whole movie is predictable, because there are some scary moments in this movie. As for the acting, at first, Steve Zahn seemed kind of irritating, and definitely like the irresponsible character that he was to play. But it seemed like characters he plays in his other movies seem similar. Paul Walker's performance of playing the straight coursed brother of Zahn's character seems to be well done, but his character seemed to be somewhat of a pushover in that he kept doing the dumb things that his brother wanted him to do. You would think that he would have the power to keep his brother in check, and avoid the horror that the pranks caused. As for Leelee Sobieski's character, she seemed all too subdued and calm that there was some type of stalker was on the three of their backs. As for the scenes, there is a weird unnecessary nudity scene when the prank goes sour, which seemed quite corny and dumb to put in. Overall, despite my badgerings of the film, the flick still has enough thrills and chills to warrant seeing. But be warned: expect to see some of the same setups of other horror flicks.",1000857600,,1596,4.288079470198675

1667997,3,B00005UV34,I don't remember buying this. But I remember seeing the movie. Oh wait I know. My fiancee saw it at a hotel and then we ordered it on amazon. It is a movie. It is a want to be scary movie with good lines. It only meets one of those expectations half way.,1510790400,,254,3.811320754716981

1668000,2,B00005UV34,"Really disappointed in this movie after reading all the good reviews. Wish I could have my money back! Very boring. Very weird and creepy but not in a fun way, just in a ""I gotta skip this part"" sort of way.",1507334400,,207,4.073170731707317

1668003,4,B00005UV34,"I thought it was good.  It seems like most things with Steve Zahn in it are pretty good actually.  It reminded me of a couple other movies, such as Breakdown with Kurt Russel.  Basically a buddy road trip gone wrong type of flick.

One thing I noticed though is that Ted Levine is clearly the voice on the CB throughout the movie.  His voice is very unique, but he's not actually the actor when you finally see him.  So when they finally do show the bad guy, the actor has a completely different voice.  It's like WTF?  That didn't detract from the movie at all though and is insignificant overall.  It keeps you entertained the whole time, and it has a good pace.  A few things go unexplained, which kind of make the whole thing a bit unrealistic, but it is a movie after all.  I'd watch again.",1503446400,,795,4.304054054054054

1668103,5,B00005UV34,John Dahl is one extremely underrated director. Along with his excellent Red Rock West and Kill Me Again I present the relentless thriller Joy Ride. Its an outstanding thriller the will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Steve Zahn is outstanding in a brilliant comic performance but also in a great dramatic turn as well along with the late Paul Walker who should be very proud of this awesome movie along with his excellent Running Scared (which is also extremely underrated). They are great together as brothers terrorized by a psychotic trucker after a prank. This is an expertly made thriller that deserves a much bigger audience. Definitely a must own!,1471564800,6,674,4.818965517241379

The scene after the hotel when they are back on the road and contacted by ""Rusty Nail"" is a classic that makes me laugh Everytime, ""you freak show, walkie talking...."" is killer! Highly recommend this film. I like Paul Walker better in this role than any of the F&F movies, real shame they did not do proper follow ups with Paul and Steve Zahn.",1469923200,3,517,4.395833333333333

This genre is overbloated nowadays but this one never got so out of hand that it was absured. Kind of paved the way for ripoffs also.

1668274,4,B00005UV34,"Overall, this was a good movie.  Not great, but definitely worth the money to see it.
It starts off rather slow.  A couple of guys, bored during a long car ride, play a prank on a trucker.  It goes through the usual, something bad happens, cops are called, trucker and guys get into an altercation which seems to make things even, and the two sides go their separate ways.
But in the second half, it gets more interesting.  Once the guys pick up the girl, the trucker has a renewed interest (if he even lost interest, considering he's still watching them).  There is some good action while the trucker plays through his revenge, I thoroughly enjoyed the process he goes through.  The final scene was very dramatic and not what I expected.  However, the very end of the film was very transparent and expected.",1436745600,3,808,4.569444444444445

Plus the first one is the best especially when Fox brought it out to DVD now get the original Fox DVD release which is the better version to have of the film anyway just stay away from the sequals they are a waste of money to own. Anyway the first has the best actor's in it especially Paul walker and also Ted Levine from the silence of the lambs did the the voice of rusty nail and Steve zahn plays Pauls brother in here and boy they get in to trouble especially with a cb radio.,1435449600,,672,3.948529411764706

1668348,3,B00005UV34,"Lili Sobieski is easy on the eyes and the premise of this film is interesting, but it decays into a rather preposterous, standard thriller/horror flick.

1668352,5,B00005UV34,"This is one of those horror movies that will terrify you from ever playing a prank on anyone again. It does to pranksters what Jaws did to beaches, and what Cabin Fever did to cabins.

We all take a prank differently. Some people laugh it off, others get pissed but do no more than maybe attempt to hit you. Then there's the ones who take it seriously.

Two unfortunate guys play a prank on a trucker via Radio station. The prank is pretty over the top but all in all innocent. They didn't get him hurt or anything like that.

But this is one trucker you do NOT want to mess with. He stalks them, follows them, chases them...hunts them. It's a type of a horror film that keeps you jumping out of your skin and hanging on the edge of your seat up until the last second. A WINNER for horror fans.",1420675200,,794,4.176470588235294

In spite of this, the movie still entertained me; so I gave it 3 stars.",1420416000,,363,4.217391304347826

REVIEW - 5/5
In the same vein as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hitcher-The/dp/B00CDV4RS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hitcher, The</a>, this film is pretty intense. I like Paul Walker (RIP) in the Fast & Furious series, but this is hands down my favorite film of his. I've watched it two or three times and it still has me on the edge of my seat. Not to mention the bad guy is voiced by none other than Ted Levine. Also surprising to see Steve Zahn in a non-typical comedic role as Paul Walker's brother who is on the run from a maniac. They have great chemistry together. Without a doubt a must watch for anyone who slightly enjoys a good adrenaline rush.",1400371200,,876,4.879194630872483

1668451,5,B00005UV34,"Paul Walker plays the responsible younger brother to Steve Zahn's troubled older brother character; Leelee Sobieski is Paul's very good friend/potential love interest.  The movie has lots of twists, is a bit demented, and Steve Zahn is funny without much effort.  One of my favorite scenes is when he is talking with police after the first hotel incident. (If you've seen this movie you hopefully know what I'm talking about. :)  )  Good cast, well acted, and still fun to watch after all these years.  I love Paul Walker and Steve Zahn.

He really can act if given the right material, still prefer the F&F franchise over all his other work, but in this one I thought he'd wind up with the girl.

It also didn't follow the criteria that way too many teenage dramas like to do; there was no ""knowingly walking into danger and hope for the best"" scenes. Pure popcorn fun!

1668480,5,B00005UV34,"With its now-eerie title, JOYRIDE documents the late Paul Walker in one of his finest hours. Produced by a pre-Trek J.J. Abrams, co-starring Steve Zahn and Leelee Sobieski, and directed by John Dahl, the project culled its cadre of talent when all were poised for greater success. The plot consists of a road trip and a prank gone wrong -- namely, the consequences of messing with a truck-wielding maniac. It was a modest production by Hollywood standards but, as a thriller, the film works superbly, calling to mind its elder-brother, DUEL, that Spielberg/Matheson masterpiece which dropped Dennis Weaver into similar cat-and-mouse circumstances. In this jaunt, Walker and Zahn play brothers with believable chemistry in roles requiring range as the scenes switch from the humorous to the horrifying to the outright harrowing. We glimpse Walker's quiet charisma throughout the proceedings as we are vicariously conveyed across the desert in a '71 Chrysler Newport. The film did fairly well in theaters and earned some critical praise, Roger Ebert calling it a ""first-rate, pure thriller."" In retrospect, it's easy to see why JOYRIDE was a vehicle that came along at the perfect moment in Walker's career. At the time of its release, it was just another entertainment, and a good one. But now, just days from the first reports of Walker's untimely departure (I'm incredulous as I write it), JOYRIDE is an opportunity to remember Walker in contexts he loved best - film and cars - just before he journeyed out of sight.",1386028800,,1518,5.076

1668483,3,B00005UV34,"""Joy Ride"" (2001) is about two brothers on a road trip (Steve Zahn and Paul Walker) who play a prank on a trucker and incur his homicidal wrath. Leelee Sobieski also appears as Walker's wannabe girlfriend.

It's pretty much a mish-mash of ""Duel"", ""Breakdown"", ""Thelma & Louise"" and ""Kalifornia"", but it's the least of these. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent road thriller with a quality cast and production, but the improbabilities stack-up the more the film proceeds, especially in the third act. Take, for instance, the corn field scene and the entire motel sequence at the end. While they're thrilling to some degree, the eye-roll factor is way too high and it insults the intelligence of the viewer. The other four films don't make this mistake (for the most part).

Other than that, the movie's well done and Zahn, Walker and Sobieski work well together.

The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in California, Nevada and Utah.

GRADE: C+",1382832000,,942,4.796296296296297
1668484,5,B00005UV34,"There's something to be said of the buddy road movie genre.  When they're done well they can be pure, cinematic magic.  Think of films like Thelma and Louise, Terrence Malick's Badlands, National Lampoon's Vacation, Vanishing Point, and even Trains, Planes, and Automobiles.  What they all share in common is precise casting, clever script development, and enough substantial character development to make you really give a damn about who these people are.  In Joy Ride, the two very attractive male leads (Paul Walker and Steve Zahn) play brothers who are terrorized on the road by a maniacal psychopath--with the clever CB handle of ""Rusty Nail"".  And why are they terrorized?  Because Zahn talks the more subdued Walker into playing a trick on Rusty Nail by impersonating a woman over the CB.  So the prank turns into pure, and terrifying mayhem when Rusty Nail, whom is never shown discovers he's been played.  What works very well in this film is the very believable interaction between the two brothers.  Zahn plays the immature but likeable counterpart to Walker's more sartorial character.  Zahn is the Joker to Walker's Jack--both prone to outlandish behavior because it's just a part of their brotherly bond.  The evil in the film is more of the manufactured variety since the viewer never ""sees"" Rusty Nail.  We only hear his deep, dark voice talking over the airwaves.  Even when the film cuts to the big rig that he's driving we never see him through the windows.  So the viewer is left imagining what this guy looks like.  Is he hideously deformed?  Does he look like Frankenstein on steroids?  Or is he simply a twisted, human being?  It all depends on your perspective of the genre.  Joy Ride represents a type of terror that is firmly rooted in the real world--the world of homicidal road rage incidents, random mass murder, and dysfunctional people doing mayhem that ends up on the 6 o'clock news.  That's the magic of this film, and the notion that the real world makes better film fodder than any made-up movie monster.",1382745600,4,2039,4.872093023255814

1668489,5,B00005UV34,"It's been done before and undoubtedly will be done again. Road rage at it's finest! Reminiscent of The Hitcher, Duel, and various other killer trip flicks, Joy Ride takes a heavily used idea that's been spread around more than the world's largest 'virgin' liar and manages to make it look appealing again. Not necessarily an easy feat, which is likely what the audience thought when seeing the previews. Most didn't bother trying this one on for size, which may explain the low box office cash-in.
Regardless of judging a film by it's trailer, this one turned out a real delight. Suspense was steady, from start to finish. In the beginning a young horny male, Lewis, is on the phone with an old friend he's always had the hots for. Hearing she's broken up with her boyfriend and needs to return home for summer vacation, yet wants the trip to last so she can unwind, he sees the perfect opportunity to replace the ex. He quickly buys a junker car, needing to get away himself, and heads up to find his potential beloved and reunite them. Along the way he learns his wayward brother is in jail yet again, so he makes a pit stop, dishes out the bail, and then takes his sibling along.

While stopping for some auto maintenance, the over the top brother gets the brilliant - at the time- idea of putting a CB radio in the car. Something to preoccupy their short attention spans on the road. Lewis obliges, and off they go to make one of the biggest mistakes of their lives. Dear brother Fuller play a practical joke on an awkward, lonely sounding truck driver (Rusty Nail), tricking him into believing he's a woman named Candy Cane and will meet him in a hotel room. Falling for the folly, the trucker heads out to the room, which happens to be right next to where the two lads are staying, giggling into their pillows.

The following day they have nothing more to laugh at. The boarder from next door has had his jaw ripped clean off; obviously this trucker is not a happy companion. From here on out it is mind games, adrenaline rushes, and sheer terror galore,. Rusty Nail means business, and the two teenagers no longer find any of the situation amusing. Once the girl is picked up it quickly escalates into a powerful, nail biting ending.

Where Joy Ride works best is its magnificent directing by John Dahl. Tension is heightened with scenes throughout the flick, making it truly enjoyable. Even though the middle may not be as potent as the first and last segments, it's still very interesting and shows its stuff too. The pacing is never considered a problem and neither, for that matter, is the acting.

Paul Walker plays Lewis and does a more than fine job. In other movies he has faltered at times but proves here that this type of role fits him like a leather glove. The brother, Fuller, is played extremely well by Steve Zahn. Fuller's character is hysterical but not forcibly so; it's not the humor one grows tired of in this day and age. You know what I mean, the fake humor from fake teenagers the studios think we lap up? The boys both have  genuine chemistry, and don't get fooled into thinking the girl is a big pawn in this killer chess game. (Sobieski acts well by the way)  She's there but the focus is all about the men, their bad deed, and how they're paying for their screw ups.

Much of the dialogue is side splitting and adds to the films entertainment value. It is not at all lame and over the top, not corny. It is realistic, underplayed humor that works so well it's hard to describe. Yet the movie isn't about humor in the least. While one of the characters causes the viewer to smile, the rest of the time the same viewer is cringing, biting the lower lip, and gripping the side of the chair. The ending scene had the most suspense, but the car in the cornfield was amazing too.

Rusty Nail as the villain is ideal. I heard on the DVD the other voice try outs; clearly he was the only reasonable choice. All other paled GREATLY in comparison. Played by Ted Levine of Silence in the Lambs fame, this voice does have enough acting for a whole cast. It's sophisticated, ignorant, creepy, sexy, and repulsive rolled all into one. A unique thing is that ol' Rusty is never quite seen. A shadow of him here and there but other than that? Nada. Having just a voice behind the killing and stalking ups the creepiness and menace. Highly enjoyable!

On the bumpy side, it is kind of unrealistic how the trucker manages to trail his prey so closely. I can actually see some of this really happening - those truckers can be quite creepy if sent over the edge - but here it's a bit too convenient in some spots. Much like the Hitcher, the villain seems almost clairvoyant. Sure, he's intelligent, but I hope not everyone is that predictable.

In another area I would have liked to see more of the end result. The last shot was the best choice (better than the many cut scenes presented on the DVD anyway), but what about the relationship between the girl and the two  guys? I don't care if they moved away, got financially stable jobs, met others, got married and kid crazy, but it would have been nice to have the sub plot of the three way love/lust situation tied up. After all, the plot is brought up in many points of the film, so I'd like a hint of how that fell through.

But enough whining about small, small things. Joy Ride made me want to gather up a couple of friends and hit the road, being sure to leave the CB behind. It did great with directing, suspense, acting, and pace. A fun, strong, dynamic film that was underappreciated. Such a shame. See it, love it, learn from it.",1379635200,,5605,4.4575609756097565
1668490,1,B00005UV34,"Joy Ride Blu-Ray disc is a hack job of the Joy Ride DVD, Special Edition Disc.  The Special Edition DVD actually gave the viewer two different movies that could be watched on different nights, so the viewer could think about and reflect on the film, or if so desired both could be watched together.

This blu-ray lacks the famous scene of Paul Walker chasing the truck while nude, as the truck is leaving the truck stop. It's in the extras as are the alternate endings.  The extras are in small screen, low res, confusing order, and really not worth watching.  Really confusing if you had not watched the 'Special Edition DVD'.

1668502,4,B00005UV34,"Joy Ride is a 2001 horror thriller I remember the network FX liked to air quite a bit for a period. Somehow, I almost always ended up watching it so I finally bit the bullet and bought the movie myself.

Joyride follows two brothers (one being played by Steve Zahn who has been starring as the father in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies recently), neither having spoken or seen the other for five years, as they travel across the country to meet up with one's female friend. Along the way, the brothers get to messing with their car's CB radio and play a prank on a trucker named Rusty Nails, leading him to believe he's chatting with a woman with the handle ""Candy Cane"" who wants to meet him at a local motel. Things quickly go downhill from there as the trucker (somehow) learns exactly who they are and what car their in based solely on the fact the brothers admit it was a prank to him.

Similar to Duel, Rusty stalks the brothers and their friend throughout the movie trying to exact his revenge.

I think Joyride, though more or less straightforward and simple, is one of the more underrated horror movies that came out around this period. It wasn't another typical ""teenager slasher"" movie or the like that was seemingly extraordinarily popular during this time.

One issue I had was the subplot of Venna's friend and roommate, Charlotte (who was played by Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman alumni Jessica Bowman). The character appears in the movie for a total of maybe three minutes and two scenes and the movie wouldn't have missed much without her as a plotpoint as far as I'm concerned.

Two brothers Fuller (Steve Zahn, ""A Perfect Getaway"") and Lewis (Paul Walker, ""Running Scared"") are in an old car on their way to pick up Lewis' girlfriend Venna (Leelee Sobieski, ""The Glass House"") from college. While on the road the brothers use an old cb radio to just joke around with Lewis impersonating a woman with the name of Candy Cane, this gains the attention of a trucker named Rusty Nail (voiced by Ted Levine, ""American Gangster""). Lewis and his brother come up with an idea to have Rusty Nail meet ""her"" at a hotel nearby that night, well they stay in the next room and he does show up and well kills the guy in the room when he doesn't see Candy Cane.

This of course terrifies the brothers and even shaken up they decide to keep going, but this game isn't over as Rusty Nail is one guy you don't want to mess with as he starts to target them. Even after they are being knocked around in their car and they admit it was a game, which he says he was just messing with them and drives off, he later sees Venna with them and the deadly game resumes.

""Joy Ride"" isn't the greatest thriller/horror flick but its quite fun, the creepy voice Levine provides Rusty Nail is certainly a nice addition, the main three actors do well and there's some good jumps even though its pretty predictable. I do like how they kept the identity of who Rusty Nail was a secret for the most part as you really don't see him much, beyond a couple of quick shots.

Its certainly a fun flick to watch, never gets boring and this does help show what could happen if you mess with the wrong person. *** out of 4 stars.",1347148800,,1627,4.324590163934427

1668515,3,B00005UV34,"My major issue with films like `Joy Ride' is a relatively simple yet pretty big one; they just aren't scary.  Isn't that what these films are supposed to be?  I mean, sure, they have elements of a thriller, but overall they just don't manage to evoke many thrills with their preposterous scenarios.  Thankfully (and I mean that in a big way) the ending of this film is gritty and somewhat terrifying.  It is the only thing that elevated this from a 2-star bore.

`Joy Ride' revolves around two brothers who find themselves in a disturbing situation when they play a prank on a lonely and psychotic truck driver.  Lewis is traveling to visit his girlfriend Venna when he gets a call that his reckless brother Fuller needs to get bailed out of jail.  Fuller is a complete goofball with no regard for consequence.  When the brothers wind up with a ham-radio installed in their car they get a little carried away with yanking some guys chain and soon they wind up being hunted by a guy who wants to humiliate them like he humiliated him.

Sadly, this film is just plain preposterous.  Nothing makes any sense, not even in a suspension of disbelief kind of way.  The acting is rather ridiculous.  Paul Walker is probably the worst actor of this past decade, completely unnatural and plain awful.  Leelee Sobieski is a bore here.  Thankfully Steve Zahn has a shred of charisma (and I generally dislike him) and he adds some color to this otherwise failure of a film.

But I can't slam this film too hard, because it ends on a major high note.

The ending here is one gigantic slice of pure terror.  Sure, it is ridiculous and high unbelievable, but one can easily overlook that because it finally does what it promises to do; scare us to death!  The gritty, disturbing nature of the ending is just fantastic, and it will make you lose your breath.

Truth be told, most new age teen horror films of this nature are stupid, but horror films don't really have to be smart.  If they are scary then they are forgivably dense.  This film wins back points for making me near pee myself in suspense during the final moments; I only wish that the setup had been more effective.  Sadly, until those last moments of baited breath, this film is rather dull.",1275350400,,2239,4.545
1668516,3,B00005UV34,"Directed by John Dahl (Rounders), Joy Ride (2001) is a thriller about the unexpected repercussions of a foolish prank.  A tense, compelling adventure, is built around the tragic consequences of a simple childish joke.

Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) is driving his 1971 Chrysler Newport to Boulder, Colorado, to hookup with his friend Venna (Leelee Sobieski), when he makes a detour to Utah, to bail his older brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) out of jail.  On the way up to Boulder, Fuller installs a CD radio in the car, and convinces Lewis to pretend to be a woman, to pull the chain of a trucker they are having a conversation with.  It's all in fun, until the brothers pull over at a motel for the night, and run into an obnoxious guest.  As a prank, Lewis as the pseudo chick ""Candy Cane"", sets up a midnight rendezvous at the motel, with a trucker known only as ""Rusty Nail"".  The brothers laugh it up as Rusty shows up at the door of the obnoxious guest, with a bottle of pink champagne, but the laughter dies, and the police are not amused, when the guest turns up near death, lying miles away on the side of the road.

The Thomas brothers soon meet up with Rusty Nail, and barely escape being flattened like a pancake.  Fuller tosses the CB out along the side of the road, and thinking their troubles are over, the boys pick up Venna, and head south into Nebraska.  Things are pretty cool, until they get a call from their old pal Rusty Nail.  The level of action ramps up from here, as Rusty moves forward with his plans for revenge.

Up to the point where Venna joins the guys, the story is very tight, and plays very well.  After that, things do get a bit iffy, as the filmmakers were not sure of the best way for the story to play, and the finished version of the film, has a different ending than what was originally planned by writers J. J. Abrams (Lost, Fringe) and Clay Tarver.  The DVD contains various alternate versions and endings, providing an opportunity for the viewer to decide which path works best.  In addition there are three commentary tracks, which provide a broad spectrum of information.

Steve Zahn and Paul Walker complement each other well, and real life college student Leelee Sobieski, is perfectly cast as Venna.  Also key to the film's effectiveness, is being able to establish Rusty Nail as real character with a discernable personality, just from hearing him speak.  In the course of the film, Rusty conveys many moods through his voice, from friendly, to shy, to reflective, to ironic, to dog mean, and coldly heartless.

Joy Ride has some rough edges, but is still a pretty entertaining time.  Although there were second thoughts about the script, and the last half of the film is cut and pasted together, the story holds together fairly well, aside from Rusty Nail's remarkable talent for kidnapping women.",1275177600,,2842,4.625498007968128

This movie is about 2 brothers taveling to new jersey and along the way deciding to pull a prank on a truck driver using a CB radio. One of the brothers posed as a girl and started messing around with the trucker hoping to get a good laugh. What they thought was a practical joke turned out to be completely different and causing the trucker to stalk them and make them run for their lives.

What makes this movie great is how it's not like other movies where you can probably predict what will happen next. ""Joy Ride"" will keep you guessing. When you think you know what will happen, something completely different occurs. The thrill of this movie how its believeable. People can take jokes too seriously and take it to drastic measures like the trucker,""Rusty Nails"", in this movie.

Not so much constant driving as suspense at a motel and other locations. Where as Weaver was alone and mainly constantly driving, this movie has three people making several stops and being subject to much more suspense. Well worth seeing.

1668528,3,B00005UV34,"Paul Walker and Steve Zahn play two brothers on a road trip who make the mistake of their young lives when they make a fool of the wrong guy.  Bored with the endless road between them and their destination, the brothers call up a random trucker on the CB and after a little role-playing hook the clueless Rusty Nail up with the imaginary Candy Cane.  But when Rusty Nail finds somebody other than the girl of his dreams waiting for him at an out-of-the-way hotel, things quickly go from bad to worse, and before they know it the brothers are fleeing for their lives.  And when Paul's lovely sort-of girlfriend, Lelee Sobieski, gets sucked into the game, Rusty Nail's revenge goes over the top.

Not bad as road thrillers go, JOY RIDE is pretty exciting and keeps the viewer guessing.  The acting is quite good, especially from Lelee Sobieski, who plays a damsel in distress who is both vulnerable and strong, and the ambiguity of her relationship to both brothers adds an interesting dynamic to the plot.  There's really no sense comparing it to Speilberg's DUEL--it's a much different movie despite some general similarities, and anyway DUEL is just much better.  JOY RIDE is fun and suspenseful, but the humor often misfires and some of the twists are ridiculous and the ending is cheap.  This is one of those movies I really enjoyed once but have no real desire to watch again--once you know how it turns out, there's no reason to go back for more.

1668529,5,B00005UV34,"Wow!  I was very impressed and surprised by this one!  I give the special features 10 STARS!

I have wanted to see this one since it was advertised on television many years ago.  For some reason, I just never got around to it.  I rarely see movies in the theater anymore, and I just never got around to seeing this on DVD. Recently, I went on a budgetary required fast of DVD purchases.  I just recently joined an on-line DVD rental service, and this has been the best decision I've made, since deciding to marry my beautiful wife!

I am a big Paul Walker fan.  He really is a good looking actor, and his acting skills match his good looks.  He's a man's man, with a super smooth style.  I have a feeling he's a lady's man, in real life!  And Steve Zahn is hilarious!  I think both of these parts were perfectly filled by these two young actors. Also outstanding is the young female part, played flawlessly by Leelee Sobieski.

I sometimes don't get a chance to view all the special features on a DVD, especially when I rent it, but thankfully I decided to try to view all of the special features on this one.  And I'm so glad that I did!  This DVD included three or four extended and alternate endings.  I have a feeling many movies film extended and alternate endings, but choose not to include them on the DVD.  I say shame on them.  I really appreciate when the company chooses to include it, as, in my opinion, it adds tremendously to the viewing pleasure.

There are also three commentaries for the entire movie.  I listened to the one from Steve Zahn, which was hilarious!  He's a really funny guy.

The movie was very well done.  The cinematography was excellent!  I have a component Video set up on my HD TV, and the colors were brilliant and the scenery was beautiful throughout.  In particular, the colors of the Police cars and the Motel lights throughout was brilliantly done.  I like how this movie featured a part of America rarely seen in Hollywood films.

A great October movie to rent or purchase!

1668530,4,B00005UV34,"In ""Joy Ride"", the Director John Dahl (Last Seduction, Red Rock West, Rounders)pounds you right from the beginning and never lets up.

It's ""Duel"" updated for the millenium and for a contemporary audience.

Two brothers, Paul Walker (Fast and The Furious) and Steve Zahn (Shattered Glass) take a road trip to pick up Walker's college girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski).

Using a CB radio, they play a practical joke on a trucker who turns out to be the biggest movie big rig psycho since Rutger Hauer planted a finger in C.Thomas Howell's french fries.

What the trucker, whose CB handle is ""Rusty Nail"" does to exact revenge keeps the audience on edge for the film's 97 minutes.

(Note: one of the sequences in the chillingly directed and edited climax cribs gleefully from ""Silence of the Lambs"")

Dahl pulls of the the difficult challenge of blending scares with a few laughs with little effort..he's a wildly talented director with a taste for hip, off beat material.

Dahl directs from a script by JJ Abrams (""Lost"") and Clay Tarver

The voice of ""Rusty Nail"" is supplied by the great Ted Levine.

Note: not long before ""Joy Ride"" began shooting, the studio decided it wanted a different ending, supposedly a few alternate endings were shot, one of which, running 29 minutes, is included on the DVD which also includes Eric Roberts vocal audition as Rusty Nail...Roberts obviously lost the gig to Levine.",1153008000,24,1403,4.886075949367089

Along the way Fuller and Lewis play a joke on a trucker using the handle 'Rusty Nail' (Ted Levine) and they end up biting off more than they can chew, resulting in a panic driven adventure where they never quite know what's going to happen next.  The film really doesn't pick up til towards the end, and the final frames are heart racingly intense, and while the acting could have used a boost (Walker is one of the worst young actors on the screen) at least Zahn and Sobieski hold there own (moreso Zahn who is everybit hilarious as he is convincingly petrified).

1668536,4,B00005UV34,"I was a little leery of Joy Ride at first since I'm am not( and I stress the not) a big fan of Paul Walker. But I do love Ted Levine which is partly the reason I was willing to give the movie the green light. That and John Dahl (writer, director of Red Rock West) also directed this movie...and confession here, I found it at the $[...] bin at wal-mart. Anyhow, to make a long story short, I picked it up and watched it that night.

Joy Ride is about Lewis (Paul Walker,) who travels through the countryside to pick up his newly-released-brother-from-jail, Fuller( Steve Zahn) On the way, they stop at a gas station, and Fuller, a very wild and joke happy person has a CB radio installed so that they could keep an eye on traffic cops and have some fun tormenting a certain truck driver. Unbeknowst to the boys, this trucker is a cross between the character from Jeepers Creepers, and a very scary individual. When he finds out that he has become the brunt of the joke, he retaliates by hunting the boys down and trying to kill them and their girlfriend.

Ted Levine is the voice of the truck driver (moby dick, memoirs of a geisha, the fast and the furious,) a man who is able to make the word ""CandyCane,"" seem scary. Although we never really get to seem him (be forwarned, the small glimpse we do get is not the real Levine,) just the knowledge that he is out there haunting the roads is enough to make me dread truck drivers for years to come. And the way he handles his big rig, is amazing. Its a cross between a race car and a tricked out army vehicle

I shan't give away the ending, but be assured its probally not quite what you where thinking. Although this movie isn't to deep that you probally will be unable to guess plot points or scenes, and although the movie won't be keeping you too near the edge of your seat. It should keep you a few inches from the seat backing. And with a killer soundtrack by Marco Beltrami (I, Robot, Terminator,) this movie should be crowd pleaser.

Just remember...CB radios are not always a good idea, especially when Ted Levine is out and about.

1668538,3,B00005UV34,"I'd like to start off with the pros by saying this was decently entertaining due to its fast pace suspense and believable storyline.  The 2 brothers who play a light joke on a trucker over a CB radio, and later find themselves, along with their friends, the targets of the vengeful trucker, is realistic and absorbing because it can happen to anyone.

I would categorize this into a suspense-slasher despite the fact you see very little blood and gore.  The actors/actresses are by far one of the better groups among modern horror flicks with loads of crappy, stiff actors.  The movie builds suspense very creatively and unleashes them at opportune times without making you feel like they are throwing cheap scream bursts at you (think The Grudge).  It's filled with twists and turns and leaves you little time to guess what happens next.

Now, on with the cons.  Usually, candidates selected for targets in horror flicks are known for their stupidity.  The common ""don't go in there, you fool"", ""don't divide up, stay together"", or the ""shoot him, dammit, that's what your gun is for!!!"".  It's very normal for people to make a mistake or two and pay for the consequences.  But seriously, the actors in this movie are so stupid (bad scripting?) that they continue to make dumb mistakes and very, very illogical decisions that gets you to wonder if the writer specifically put those decisions in to carry on the plot.  There must have been at least 15 or 20 places where these sort of things happen, and some of those mistakes are just so unforgivable that I had to take out a star for the bad plotting.

The other part I really found annoying was how godly they made the pyscho trucker.  I mean, we aren't talking about normal killers like Jason or Freddy who are a step or 2 above their victims...we are talking about an omniscient, omnipotent criminal who can stealthily maneuver a huge truck to do anything at will, track down people with every piece of information about them, strategically plan every move and moves of opponents, while also knowning skills close to those of being an espionage.  I mean, this guy should not even be a trucker, but an instructor who teaches CIA or FBI agents.  This was the part that took the movie down further more.  It would not have been hard to make an intelligent killer rather than the god of all criminals.  The guy doesn't make one single mistake besides the prank that he fell for, and that's just very implausible.  I'm sure you can find some far-fetched idea to explain this phenomenon, but I find it hard to beleive that a guy that can drive like a getaway specialist and track down people and plan out strategies like a CIA, would be a normal, ordinary trucker.",1125100800,6,2713,4.651991614255765

1668540,3,B00005UV34,"Here's a heads up to all you silly kids out there:  Long haul truckers who drive those massive Kenworths are not to be messed with--especially on the CB radio.  The hours are long, the road monotonous, and some of these drivers get a little too puckered.  But alas, brothers Lewis and Fuller (who named these characters?) fail to grasp this incontrovertible truth, so the stage is set for a road trip from Hades, a nonstop cat and mouse chase that makes JOY RIDE an entertaining, yet goofy, experience.

Having hooked up with his wacky brother, steady Lewis (Paul Walker) heads out, in a rundown old jalopy (was that an Impala?), to pick up a hot babe he has a crush on--a babe out of college for the summer, with all three of them destined for the east coast.  But, problematic brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) decides it would be great fun for his sibling to play with some truckers on the CB radio. . .with Lewis pretending to be a female looking for love.  Going on the air as ""Candy Cane,"" Lewis instantly attracts a trucker who doesn't like to be the subject of any kind of prank.  Once the trucker discovers that Candy Cane is a Dandy Shane, all sorts of awful stuff starts happening.

Thus, the chase commences, as the disgruntled semi driver stalks the two brothers relentlessly--even though his rig could do stuff on dirt roads and in cornfields that I never knew a double-tandem could ever begin to accomplish.  But hey, I suppose motive always overcomes burying a ten-ton rig up to its twin axles in dirt.  People come, people go, suspense unfolds, suspense ebbs, girls scream, police come, and we witness a very dramatic, exciting destruction of property.  And then, predictably, the climax tells us this tale has yet to end. . .

Walker and Zahn are solid, if not noteworthy, in their roles, while Leelee Sobieski very aptly plays female-soon-to-be-victim Venna, a college coed who is on both brothers' babe radar.  Ted Levine furnishes the eery voice of the scorned trucker, and he reminds me how Claude Akins might sound if the beloved character actor had had too many tequila shots.  Be that as it may, JOY RIDE entertains as a ""chase flick,"" as long as you ignore reality, the laws of gravity and physics, basic human interaction, and several other bothersome little quirks.  But what the heck:  with a CB radio, you've got the entire world on your doorstep.

1668541,3,B00005UV34,"So I just saw this on TV. Usually, I channel surf during the commercials but this movie was so suspensful that I actually stayed on the same channel waiting for it to come back. I wasn't expecting much for a movie with Paul Walker in it, but it was actually pretty good.

It's a basic plot with two brothers, Lewis (Paul Walker) and Fuller (Steve Zahn) driving around with Lewis' long time friend and crush, Venna (Leelee Sobieski). It starts off with Lewis calling Venna and then making plans to pick her up from college and drive home. Along the way, he picks up his recently out of jail brother, Fuller, and off they go.

Before reaching the college, they play a mean joke on an unsuspecting truck driver, who calls himself ""Rusty Nails"", mostly initiatied by Fuller, the more cruel of the two. So after a few close encounters with this psychotic truck driver, who remains unseen for most of the movie, they pick up Venna. The brothers are so close to death at one point that it seems kind of illogical that they don't run for help, but instead kind of blow it off as a mean joke. That's one of the few things about the movie that bothered me.

The real horror comes in a little later after they run into this crazy truck driver again and they realize just how much he doesn't like being made a fool out of. It's a crazy chase along the highway that's extrememly enthralling and it gave me a mini heart attack.

The final scenes at the motel end the movie nicely. You're dying to see what this truck driver looks like and what happens to Venna and the brothers.

Minor things that bothered me were the fact that this huge truck was able to follow them across the country unseen by them. Why don't they immediately call for help after the first time they run into this crazy guy? Why are they even still using that radio after the truck driver nearly kills the guy in the room next to them?! Oh yeah and Fuller was a little repulsive, first he gets them into the whole mess by suggesting the prank, then he tries to go after the girl his brother has a crush on, and then he picks up the radio just to egg the guy on even though it's pretty obvious that he shouldn't.

Sure there isn't much character development, sure you may have seen this premise before, and yes ""Joy Ride"" is a B-Movie.....and it's a great one! I don't know what more you could ask for with a movie like ""Joy Ride"", it gave me plenty of chills, and had me really rooting for the two brothers who get on the wrong side of a homicidal truck driver. ""Joy Ride"" may resemble ""Duel"", ""Breakdown"", ""Highwaymen""  or any one of a hundred thriller ""road"" movies, but the story is definately edge-of-your-seat fun, and worth adding to your collection if you are a horror fan. Within the first 10 minutes you get sucked into this thriller and it does not let go. Ted Levine is perfect as Rusty Nail (you forget how menacing he can be after watching him as Stottlemeyer on ""Monk""), and if Levine's voice oozing through the cb radio doesn't give you goosebumps, you should really go have your blood pressure checked!

1668548,4,B00005UV34,"Joy Ride is a horror and humor movie that came out in 2001. Joy Ride has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it about two years ago. I did not know what to expect, but one of my friends told me that it was one of the funniest and scariest movies that they had ever seen. So, I thought I would give it a shot, and it turns out that I now watch the movie all the time, and I brought to Illinois State with me when I moved in.

 Joy Ride starts out with Lewis (Paul Walker) and his best friend Venna (Leelee Sobieski) talking on the telephone. Venna was talking about how great it would be if she had a car and could just get home at any time she wanted. Lewis, who has a crush on Venna, tells her that he has a car and will come and pick her up. So, as Lewis is leaving college for the summer and heading to pick up Venna he calls his mom while driving to Boulder Colorado, Venna's college town. His mom informs Lewis that his troublesome brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn), was put in jail again for being drunk and disorderly.  So, being the good brother that Lewis is, he picks up his brother, and his brother asks to just go home with him.

 After picking up Fuller, they keep heading to Colorado. Along the way, while getting gas, Fuller pays for someone to put a CB radio in the car. They first just use the radio as a radar detector, because the truckers will inform them if there are any cops ahead. After awhile of riding in the car, ""Black Sheep and Mama's Boy"" (Fuller and Lewis's CB names) Fuller thinks it would be funny to prank one of the truckers into thinking he is a girl. So, then Lewis, in his girly voice as ""Candy Cane,"" talks Rusty Nail into thinking he's a girl. When they pull over to get a hotel room they invite Rusty Nail to come and join Candy Cane for a late night rondevu at the hotel. After Rusty Nail finds out about this, he comes after Fuller and Lewis for revenge. Eventually they tell Venna when Rusty Nail comes after them later on when she joins them for the ride home.

 Even though throughout the whole story we never actually see Rusty Nail, I was scared out of my pants all most for the whole movie. Joy Ride, I think, is one of the better thriller movies that I have seen. Joy Ride's other great characteristic that made the movie what it is, is Fuller, Steve Vahn's, humor throughout the entire story. He kept me laughing because of his smart and sarcastic remarks. If I hadn't liked the movie, I still would have been entertained just by listening to Fuller. Plus, Paul Walker and Steve Vahn are very cute, which almost all girls know and would agree with me, so that also kept me interested.

 The only thing I didn't like about the movie would have to be with Leelee Sobieski performance. I personally do not like her acting skills in general, but she did not do a great job in this movie. The fact that she was only in it half the time, I think, was a plus. It was not as if her performance was the worst I have ever seen and she was absolutely horrible, but I just think the part could have been better if played by someone who would have fit the character better.

 Overall, if anyone wanted to watch a humorous, keep you on the edge of your seat movie, I would defiantly recommend Joy Ride to them. Even though there were some small details that I did not like about the movie, it still comes out to be one of my favorites. So, go rent or buy it, you will not be disappointed.",1096416000,,3433,4.170694864048339

SPOILERS!: Rusty Nail rigged the ice man's body (the guy from earlier in the film whose truck gets torn in half by Rusty's) in his truck and used something to hold down the gas pedal to run into the motel. That wasn't Rusty Nail in the truck at all. Sorry again, I know most people could figure this out, but some like the reviewer below can't. Very good movie by the way and that Ted Levine has got a creepy voice.",1093392000,,494,4.2105263157894735
1668550,2,B00005UV34,"Since Paul Walker was in it(and I hate his annoying voice and wooden acting) I was expecting this to be a total disaster. To my surprise it wasn't as terrible as I anticipated. Although if you ask me whether it was a good movie, the answer would be no. Paul(and his baby blue eyes) goes on the road trip along with his dimwitted  jailbird of a  brother and hot(in producer's opinion) chick that he wants desperately. On the way, they decide to play a joke on some trucker who gets pissed off and starts stalking them. Somehow this trucker(whose face we never see) knows everything about them and he appears at the most unexpected moments. Instead of going to the cops, like any normal people, the characters spend the movie trying to run away and outwit this fathom. I thought it was supposed to be suspense thriller but this is definitely ""Friday 13th"" kind of movie(and I'm not found of those). Paul Walker didn't stink as badly as he did in the ""Fast and the Furious"", but this LeeLee Sobievski who was playing the ""hot"" chick is one bad actress(and skanky looking one at that. I suspect the producers had the beer goggles on when she was selected for this role).

The plot has been summarized before, so I will avoid that. This movie is very much a tale of suspense that you will keep thinking about for days. Paul Walker and Steve Zahn do really well in this film, but I'm not crazy about Leelee Sobieski. I've seen her in other films, and her acting is the same in all of them, lukewarm.
The first half of the movie is really good and you can really get into it, then Leelee's character is introduced and it starts to drag. This is a good movie to watch with a bunch of friends sitting there yelling at the screen.
The alternate endings are also very fabulous. Check them out if you haven't seen them yet.",1085529600,,754,4.171232876712328
1668553,4,B00005UV34,"And this one is.  John Dahl racks up another effective modern thriller.  Although the story is very simple and leaves very little to the imagination, it still draws you in and entertains you enough to make you want to see it again some time.  The cast is good, and, like ""Jeepers Creepers"", does take some time to build up the characters enough to make you care about them so that you're not left waiting for them to die (unlike most teen/young adult slasher flicks).
But, what struck me the most, was the placement of not only one, but two vintage Brenda Lee songs (and not even one of them was ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"")!  I'm telling you, I nearly jumped when I heard ""Everybody Loves Me But You"" start to play in that cornfield!  I thought ""only I would have thought to do that"".  And as if that weren't enough, shortly afterwards they played ""I Wonder"" in the motel room.  Oh boy, I was overexcited.  Early 60s Brenda Lee songs are probably my favorite pop songs of all time.  There is nothing more exciting than a clever song placement in a movie.  I don't know if it was John Dahl's idea or what, but someone deserves major props for that.  (Oh, and I won't complain that in the movie they were being played by the villian.  I'm okay with that.  I'm sure Brenda didn't mind, either.)
Definitely a good night's entertainment.",1082073600,,1341,4.491735537190083
1668554,4,B00005UV34,"We rented this movie on a whim. Didn't expect much, didn't have high expectations, were just hoping it wasn't so bad that we had to turn it off. Although, if I didn't turn off Species II while watching it, I can pretty much watch anything.
So watch it we did. And we were pleasantly horrified.
Joy Ride is about the all American road trip. One brother (Lewis, played by Paul Walker), on his way to pick up a potential future girlfriend (Venna, played by Leelee Sobieski) and thence homeward bound, finds out his older brother (Fuller, played by Steve Zahn) just got ""into some trouble."" That trouble involves jail time, apparently. But not for very long, because Lewis bails him out.
On the way across the U.S., the two boys get into trouble by pretending they're women on the CB. The brothers go one step further than usual man-boy antics by inviting a lonely trucker over to the hotel room of another jerk who crossed their path.
Hilarity ensues.
Okay, actually, the pissed off trucker, angry that he's not getting laid by ""Candycane"" rips off the other man's jaw in a rage. He gets points for creativity.
The above summary does not do the movie justice. There's great tension, slow camera pans, and moments of building suspsense -- one of them just focusing on an odd picture on a wall. But we're listening to what's going on BEHIND the wall.
Joy Ride is about anonymity. I relate to the issue because my Master's thesis was about just that: what you do when you're anonymous. It can be empowering when you're the anonymous one, or terrifying when someone anonymous stalks you. And that's exactly what happens in Joy Ride.
Joy Ride has its flaws. The brothers, Fuller specifically, borders on being an unlikable jerk that you begin to hope gets killed. But the characters redeem themselves by acting like real people. They freak out, call the police, run screaming, shout for management -- they do everything *I* would do if I was being stalked by a 300 lb., 6-foot tall sexually repressed trucker. It's the actions that get them in trouble when you lose sympathy for them...until you realize just how horrible the angry trucker is.
Poor Leelee is supposed to be the eyecandy in the film (or, as the trucker puts it, the Candycane in this film). She's cute, but she's far too intelligent -- in her manner and her appearance -- to come off as the doe-eyed victim. Her role doesn't even require that much acting (for most of the film, she's drunk).
Nevertheless, Joy Ride is just plain scary. If you've ever been afraid of being stranded on the road, if you've ever been one of those little [disagreeable persons] who taunted truckers on CBs (I was one, sadly), and if you've listened to the hotel room next door wondering if people are making out or killing each other...you'll like this horror film.",1079913600,,2802,4.6626262626262625

All the actors turn in top-notch performances especially Steve Zahn in his first main star role. Marco Beltrami's music score is delightfully exciting and scary, adding tension to even the most calm parts in the film. Directed and photographed beautifully with ominous images of the dark, shadowed stalker and of desolate highways, blending this particular trucker in with the rest, as they all play a game of hide-and-seek.
Overall, this is one of the best thrillers to come along in ages and deserves all the appreciation it can get. The DVD is also highly recommended, though the featurette is actually very ""etty"" (meaning its very short)! Pulse-pounding entertainment!",1077321600,,1064,4.883977900552487

This movie stars Paul Walker as Louis and Steve Zahn as his troublemaker brother Fuller. Fuller gets the genius idea to ""prank call"" someone on a CB radio. Turns out the guy on the other end REALLY hates prank calls. One of the cool things about his movie is that none of these characters have cell phones. I don't have a cell phone because I can't afford one, and it's nice to see that these guys don't have a cell phone simply because they couldn't afford one either.
I was gripping my chair during the chase scenes and freaking out over little things-- like when the truck driver loudly plays a fifties type song on the radio as he's trying to find them in a cornfield.
The alternate endings are especially pleasing. One of which is 29 minutes long (which was the original ending) and MUCH MUCH different than the one used in the movie. There are also three other endings, all fairly similar, but with twists on the same scenario. Another special feature is listening to the other voices that were intended for the truck drivers voice... you'll know why they chose Ted Levine for the voice after you hear the other two.

Actually the cinema print was different from the DVD because the bad guys face was not seen at all but they restored lots of that for the DVD (which has like a zillion alternative endings!)
This is pure pop-corn fodder but it is still good and the suspense is all there. If you are looking for cheesy horror/suspense films then you can not go too far wrong with Joy Ride. It is entertaining, but not exactly Oscar winning stuff as I am sure you are not expecting.

1668561,5,B00005UV34,"""Joy Ride"" directed by amazing suspense director John Dahl , is a state of the art thriller.  This movie stars the hilarious Steve Zahn, convincing Paul Walker and new-comer Leelee Sobieski.
  To open this clever thriller, 2 Brothers (Zahn and Walker) install a CB Radio into their car. Not being able to resist themselves they make  what they think is a harmless prank on a Vengeful trucker with the handle of ""Rusty Nail.""  The two soon realize that the prank is now on them.  There are then  clever scenes of suspense and comedy and eventually Venna(Sobieski) is thrown into the mix, and the three race for their lives from the phsyco trucker.
  Joy Ride is so well done, the script is top notch, making every scene interesting, even the over long car ride in the beginning.  The direction is amazing, and the lighting gives the dark effect and look of the plot.  Of course the trucker does have special ""powers"" and some things are never fully explained.  Although these little things have no effect on the over all outcome of this thrilling nail-biter.
  What is great about the movie is the great mixture of comedy and terror. Also the timing is wonderful too.  The movie is not over-long and you find yourself wanting more after the not so happy ending.

1668568,5,B00005UV34,"Joy Ride has everything you could ever want in a thriller, delivering 96 power-packed, intense minutes of movie magic.  The DVD makes this great movie even better by dumping as many extras as is scientifically possible onto the disk.  Director John Dahl and his crew got everything right: cast, plot, special effects, overall vision, etc.  This is no insignificant achievement given the fact that the storyline of the movie is a familiar one that could have fallen flat in a number of different ways.  Under Dahl's direction, Joy Ride delivers a uniquely impressive twist to a familiar movie formula.
This is Fate at work here, thinks Lewis, when his friend Venna (LeeLee Sobieski) tells him she has broken up with her boyfriend, and he takes advantage of this opportunity by picking the girl of his dreams up in Colorado on his cross-country trip home from college.  He also decides to backtrack 200 miles and bail his older brother out of jail.  Fuller (Steve Zahn) left home five years earlier, seemingly just to try out for town drunk positions all over the Western US.  Fuller has the bright idea of having an old CB radio installed in the car, and it is not long before he hatches up a prank to play on a certain trucker known as Rusty Nail.  Lewis pretends to be a woman, gets the guy all worked up, and invites him to meet ""her"" that night in a hotel room occupied by a hateful fellow Fuller encountered in the hotel lobby.  You know how this goes: it's funny until someone gets his lower jaw ripped out of his head.  The boys head on east a little bit the wiser, but Rusty Nail refuses to go away, terrorizing them in a big way.  The guys try to forget everything that happened by the time they pick up Venna, but Rusty Nail is still watching from the shadows and now sets his sights on the lovely young lady of the group.  The suspense builds quite impressively over the course of the film, leading up to a climax that does not disappoint.
The three main characters are just normal people, and that helps contribute to the fear factor involved in watching their insanely difficult ordeal.  The voice of Rusty Nail works wonders, as his faceless presence over the CB is incredibly chilling and powerful.  In the midst of all this terror, though, the viewer will find plenty of comedy.  Steve Zahn is simply hilarious as Fuller; he takes gleeful delight in the prank he masterminds, yet he is at his funniest when he starts wigging out in terror, as he does on numerous occasions.  Paul Walker has his moments as well, and he really serves to keep the story grounded, offsetting the hyperactive mania of Fuller and the serious and frightened attitude Venna has to adopt after learning that she is in grave danger as a result of a moronic prank.  Sobieski is, of course, her always perfect self, demonstrating her acting skills across the entire spectrum from brave, determined young woman to helpless victim.  The driving force behind Joy Ride, though, is that big black semi that just keeps coming and coming.
The movie is more than worth its price in and of itself, but the special edition DVD simply showers us with gifts.  Let's say you don't care for the ending of the movie; well, in addition to one deleted scene, you get four alternate endings to choose from, including an original, unused ending totaling twenty-nine minutes.  Amazingly, all of the endings work for me, although I agree with the director that the theatrical ending is the best of the bunch.  You have the option of watching the extended original ending on its own or, more impressively, during your viewing of the movie itself.  The other alternate endings involve quite different final scenes, giving everyone a chance to be a hero.  The extras don't stop here, though.  The DVD also comes with a theatrical trailer, a short featurette, three separate commentaries, and a trio of auditions for the voice of Rusty Nail.  As impressed as I was with Ted Levine's voice in the film, I was still rather amazed at just how inferior the other two Rusty Nail wannabes sounded.  Joy Ride is the total thriller package and then some, and the DVD is by far the most impressive one-disk DVD release I have ever seen.

1668571,4,B00005UV34,"If you think you're going on a joy ride with this movie, then think again. This isn't the ""Fast & The Furious"" street-racer type kind of thing. If it is, you're sadly mistaken. There're some boldly-captivating, gut-wrenching, heart-pounding action-sequences, in ""Joy Ride"" that'll make your head spin. ""Joy Ride"" is a riveting piece of work. This is gonna be a wild-ride, so ""buckle-up."" (The following is an excerpt from the movie:)
Lewis [Paul Walker] takes his brother's friend, Venna [Leelee Sobieski], who's from Boulder, Colorado, along for the ride who are about to embark on this wild-adventure. Lewis eagerly hops into his classic-looking car heading-out West enroute to Salt Lake City, Utah, to picking-up his brother Fuller [Steve Zahn] who had just been released from jail. This unsuspecting trio are oblivious to what's going on - with what will eventually take place on their harrowing-journey. (It's about getting out of this thing, alive.) It's all in a little harmless fun, making some prank-calls to somebody on a CB radio while traversing this desolate stretch of highway in Utah. Whereupon which, they're talking to this weird guy driving around in a big black truck.
They're given instructions by this guy that goes by the alias of ""Candy Cane,"" who wants to meet them at some undisclosed location. The brothers and the girl, had a bad feeling about this. Filled with trepidation, they ignored the call, and went on their way. Meanwhile, they're checking-in at this roadside motel so they can relax, and get some shut-eye for the night. When they're all settled in  - they get a call from Candy Cane on their CB to inform them, he's at the motel parked out front. Sure enough, this creep pulls-up in his big black truck. (He ends-up killing this guy, who's working at the front-desk of the motel.) The trio instinctivly bolts, for a quick getaway in their car, trying desperately to evade Candy Cane. They end-up being followed by Candy Cane down this country road (winding its way through this small town) to a gas station, where they're getting a fill-up. The brothers spot the guy at the gas station, and start to freak-out. They're subsequently the target of this brash truck driver's misdeeds who's in a relentless-pursuit of giving-chase, attempting to run them over with the big black truck. They find themselves ""clinging-on for dear-life."" They're trying to avert an imminent disaster with this scum-bag, by driving through this dusty road in a corn field. They look back in the rear-view mirror (and over their shoulders to the back window) of the car they're in, to seeing him coming their way with the big black truck riding their tail. When they get to the end of the road, the driver suddenly changes his mind and backs his rig up. Luckily, he leaves the trio unscathed. (The truck drivers name alone, is enough to send chills through your whole body.)
This movie has all sorts of supense. I don't want to give the whole movie away. You'll have to see it for yourself. Paul in my opinion, did a great job of playing this complex role. He was a vigilant kind of guy (pretty tough) throughout the movie. He had the fortitude and the resiliancy to keep he, and the rest of the gang out of harms way. Some of you may be thinking: he's this pretty boy, who usually plays the cutesy roles. Frankly, I think he gave it his-all. Steve on the other hand comes-up short, with his sub-par performance. He acts like a crybaby, with his incessant whining. They should've chosen Vin Diesel (or Leonardo Di'Caprio) to play the part instead. He's much better off playing the ""funny man"" in a comedy piece, than he is doing the tough roles. Leelee, did an okay job as the one who got sucked-in to this mess, in the first place.
There's a lot of violent chase-scenes in the film, which makes for ""high-octane"" thriller. This film is rated [R] for: Language, Nudity, Violence, and Gore.",1058227200,,3902,4.7807407407407405

The movie has all the prerequiste scary car scenes, including being chased by a semi in a corn field. The movie begins very well with two brothers playing a joke on their cb radio on their way to pick up a friend in another state. The joke turns very badly when the trucker comes back for revenge. After there first encounter with the trucker the movie starts to trail off and I lost a little bit of interest. The movie then begins to lead into the ridiculous and some of the action doesn't really work well. Interestingly, there are plenty of deleted scenes which make you wonder about alternative directions for the film.
Overall, however, it was a decent movie and of course it left it wide open for a sequel. The DVD has plenty of special features including a testing of possible voices for the all important faceless voice on the radio. Check out the one with Eric Roberts. I am so glad they didn't chose him.

1668585,5,B00005UV34,"I will admit that I went into the film expecting to be disappointed, but I ended up enjoying the ride.  The villain, Rusty Nails, is truly creepy and his pursuit of the main characters stressed me out to the very end.  The premise of the film is much like all the roadside thrillers (The Hitcher being the most famous).  Psycho killer stalks young prey down the lonely highway.  This time, the killer is savage and angry.  There is something more terrifying when you understand why he is going after these people and what he does to the first victim is absolutely disturbing.
Paul Walker and Steve Zahn are terrific.  Paul Walker has a killer smile.  Steve Zahn is wonderful as his delinquent brother.  And they both get naked.  Adding to the suspense is Leelee Sobieski.  The fact that she is innocent and all this, but becomes a target none-the-less really sucks in the audience.  This is a great suspenseful film!
Now the DVD is an added plus.  Apart from the usual special features, this includes an option to watch the original version of the film.  Halfway through the movie, you can set it up for an icon to appear.  This icon will take you through an alternate version of the film!  An enitrely different half hour ride!  If you've already seen the film and liked it, get the DVD!  If you enjoyed films like The Hitcher or Jeepers Creepers, then this is a must-have for your collection.",1040947200,,1394,4.578947368421052
1668599,3,B00005UV34,"a practical joke on anyone because you don't know who is psycho out there!
That is the main point to this story, which was very different than I had expected.  It didn't resort to bloody grisly murder scenes but did that old Hitchcockian thing and thrived more on the suspense of it all.
Steve Zahn(Fuller) and Paul Walker(Lewis) play two brothers who are on the road travelling to pick up Walker's girl, Venna, played by Leelee Sobieski.  On the way to Venna, they decide to get on the cb radio(yes, cb) and play a joke on a trucker. Lewis pretends to be a woman(candycane) on the prowl. They trick him into meeting ""candycane"" at a hotel.  Little do they know who they are dealing with. This guy is a full fledged murderer, and doesn't like being tricked.  Kudos to Director John Dahl for this interpetation of horror. It doesn't quickly rush into the gore and stupidity that other recent horror films are notorious for.  ""Jeepers Creepers"" has one similarity with this movie -- a truck chasing a car. The main characters in ""Joy Ride"" were stupid to mess around with this guy, but they learn a valuable lesson whereas the main characters in ""Jeepers..."" are just plain dumb.
The acting was fine, not brilliant.  Zahn is the best actor in the film. And creepy Ted Levine, best known as Buffalo Bill in ""Silence of the Lambs"" gives our ""monster"" his voice.

1668602,5,B00005UV34,"As I started watching Joy Ride, I wasn't necessarily sure what to expect. Yeah, the trailers made the film look like a frightening ride, but the previews also seemed to give most of the plot away, and the box office returns were surprisingly low for a teen-based thriller (JR actually somehow grossed less money than Swimfan?!). Well, have no fear; even though the trailer does give too much away (avoid it if you can), Joy Ride is an intense, nail-biting thriller that surpassed my expectations.
Paul Walker stars as college student Lewis Thomas. He's just bought a car and is on his way to Colorado to pick up Venna (Leelee Sobieski), the girl he's always had a crush on, and take her home to New Jersey. But on the way, he stops in Salt lake City to bail out his brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn, who's absolutely marvelous), who he hasn't seen in five years. Fuller decides to tag along with his brother and even has a CB radio inserted into his car. That's when Fuller decides to play a joke on a gravelly-voiced trucker who calls himself Rusty Nail. But this little prank has an unexpected backfire, and Fuller and Lewis suddenly find themselves in a deadly road game of cat-and-mouse.
Plot-wise, Joy Ride is heavily reminiscent of Duel and Breakdown, with maybe a little bit of The Hitcher thrown in for good measure. The fairly young cast will probably remind some of recent slasher films such as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer. But you'd be wrong to merely place this as another teeny-bopper thriller that's simply out to crank as much cash as possible from its unassuming audience. From first scene to the very last (and I do mean VERY last), Joy Ride is gripping, heart-pounding entertainment. What director John Dahl has done is take an old, but quite intriguing premise (the road-trip horror/thriller) and craft it into a funny, scary, and suspenseful thrill ride that stumbles only a few times throughout its entire running time.
Dahl's great with both the physical action and the psychological head games. There are the chase scenes, which are exhilarating and furiously intense. Yeah, they don't feature the mayhem of the car chases in Gone in Sixty Seconds or The Fast and the Furious but they're far more effective because you actually care about the characters, the situation, and the outcome.
Psychological thrills aren't as prevalent, but are effective. For almost the entire film, you only hear Rusty Nail's voice, so the fact that he could be anybody our protagonists encounter adds that much more to the suspense. It's also more frightening not knowing what he looks like, and his voice alone is enough to creep you out (see if you can guess which actor voices him).
The performances are overall quite good. Pretty-boy Paul Walker is showing improvement with every film he makes (he was awful in The Skulls and is decent here; quite impressive, I might say). Leelee Sobieski is like a teenage Helen Hunt, and I can't really seem to look beyond that. But the scene-stealer is top-billed (yes!) Steve Zahn, delivering a terrific performance that would be worthy of an Oscar nomination in a fair world. This man is hilarious, with a carefree attitude that feels entirely genuine and addictive. And when all the on-screen horror begins, he seems so convincingly terrified, you can't help but keep your eyes glued to the screen. He's also got great chemistry with Walker, and I wouldn't mind seeing these two playing siblings again in another film.
Like I said the film does make a few stumbles. Around the half-way mark, the movie inexplicably slows down for a lengthy breather, which isn't paced very well, though it does feature a hilarious improv bit from Steve Zahn when he encounters a group of rednecks. The cat-and-mouse road games are quite elaborate and unlikely, with Rusty Nail knowing seemingly everything about these brothers and staying one step ahead of them the whole time. That's actually only a minor complaint, considering that the elaboracy quickly builds suspense, since you're never certain what's going to happen next (take, for instance, the hair-raising scene with the road signs and the car trunk). Then there's Rusty Nail himself, who at the end, you get a few brief glimpses at. Dahl probably shouldn't have let us get that good a look at his physical appearance, but just as bad is why they didn't use the same actor who voices the part to also play the part (if you know who I'm talking about, then you'll know how genuinely creepy this guy can act and look).
But these problems are hardly detrimental. The slow middle is just a gear-up for the last 1/3 (about 35 minutes), which features one high-octane, frightening set-piece after another at a non-stop pace, all aided by Marco Beltrami's excellent score, probably his best yet (it's derivative of his work in Scream and Michael Kamen's score in Event Horizon, but it makes for a damn good mix). The last fifteen minutes, in particular, features one of the most exciting and chilling finales I've seen in years. Don't let anyone spoil it for you.
The DVD displays four (!) alternate endings for this film, including one that runs 29 minutes! Having seen all these conclusions, I can say with confidence the one Dahl chose to go with is the best. Joy Ride was unfairly ignored at the box office, but now on DVD and video, it'll hopefully find the large fan base it should have received. This film was released the same year as Jeepers Creepers, that other ""psycho truck driver chasing after teen siblings"" thriller, which I also highly recommend and would make a good double bill.

1668603,4,B00005UV34,"Roadrage is a thrilling road movie that engages its audience, respects their level of patience and delivers the goods, via a truck storming down the highway.
College freshman Lewis (Paul Walker from the Fast and The Furious) is embarking on a road trip to pick up his dream girl, Venna (Helen Hunt look alike Leelee Sobieski from Deep Impact and Joan of Arc). On the road he detours to go bail his loser brother out of gaol, Fuller (played by Steve Zahn from Happy Texas and Riding in Cars with Boys).
Lewis and Fuller lure a truckie by the name of ""Rusty Nails"" into a fake engagement with a fictional character called ""Candy Cane"". The stunt goes horribly wrong which sets the pretext for a `road-rage' scenario, in which the unseen but eerily voiced Rusty Nails unleashes a campaign of fear and terror upon the trio as a payback for their cheap and cruel stunt. Director John Dahl (Redrock West and The Last Seduction) is terrific at cranking up tension and thoughtfully spares the audience much of the ridiculousness that other teen road-trip movies all have in common. Zahn is a real scene-stealer and has some great lines that provide terrific comic relief while pretty boy Walker does his best with a mediocre character. `Miss Personality' Leelee Sobieski is as always pretty lame, and this `performance' is no exception. She is at her best when she is bound, gagged and unable to move. This film is a real `edge of your seat' thriller that hits all the right nerves.",1032220800,,1474,4.694980694980695
1668604,3,B00005UV34,"The premise of JOY RIDE seems like a pretty good one.  Two brothers (Paul Walker; Steve Zahn) with a penchant for doing the irresponsible play a practical joke on a trucker named Rusty Nail at a backwater Wyoming motel, only to have this trucker come after him on the open road and the police not take them nearly seriously enough.  The horror escalates when they bring in Walker's girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski), and she becomes ensnared in the trucker's murderous rampage with them.
In essence, this is a Generation X version of Steven Spielberg's 1971 suspense masterpiece DUEL, ratcheted up with plenty of SCREAM/URBAN LEGEND-type shocks, salty language, and violence.  Unfortunately, however, these additions to this plot about teen pranks and road rage diminish its effectiveness.  This is nowhere near the masterpiece that DUEL is, because its premise is structured to cater to a teen-horror audience wanting cheap thrills instead of the realistic, unsettling psychological terror of Spielberg's film.
The difference between JOY RIDE and DUEL is evident in the main characters.  With DUEL, Spielberg and legendary screenwriter Richard Matheson constructed a very terrifying situation of an innocent motorist, played by Dennis Weaver, who does nothing more than pass a road-hogging oil truck on a California highway and then is mercilessly pursued by that truck and its psychopathic driver.  Weaver, however, was someone whose shoes we were put right into as individuals.  In contrast, the Walker and Zahn characters are drawn up as ciphers by co-screenwriter J.J. Abrahams and director John Dahl, and they act so inanely that I almost wanted Rusty Nail (Ted Levene) to rub them out halfway through.  Sobieski's character, though small in comparison with Walker's and Zahn's, is perhaps the best-drawn character in this whole road rage tale; and near the climax, she plays the typical young-person damsel in distress.
Dahl does a very good job with the action scenes and the bleak photography of the Wyoming landscape, which almost comes out of a Peckinpah western.  But the film itself is badly let down by two leads who generate too little sympathy and a premise with not much in it that's overtly memorable.  This is why, like THE RAGE: CARRIE 2, which tried to bring the story of Brian DePalma's masterpiece CARRIE into the SCREAM/URBAN LEGEND era, JOY RIDE is only so-so in bringing DUEL's road rage premise into today's teen-horror world and falls short of the mark.",1032048000,,2476,5.15211970074813

Introducing: I don't know why this movie flopped. It's one of the five best I have ever seen in my life (and I've seen every Hitchcock, Spielberg and Fincher movie). But I think it wasn't succesful, because everybody thought it's another Teen-Slasher -and this movies were in past very bad- (Thirteen ghosts - bad, Jeepers Creepers - very bad, Ghosts of Mars - ARRGHH). But the director John Dahl didn't borrow from Slasher movies, he borrowed from Spielbergs Duel and Hitcher.
Acting: Leelee Sobieski, Paul Walker and Steve Zahn are the leading actors and I tell you: Everybody will win the Oscar in other movies in the future. This 3 actors are SOOO talented. They are sexy and the performances are fantastic. I think Paul, Leelee and Steve are now my favourite actors of all time. I love they.
Directing: John Dahl is a great camera worker and there are great places in this movie. The script is great written. This movie is very suspensful. I'm schocked by the ending. WOW WHAT A FLASH. I think - no, I HOPE - there should be a Sequel. I don't know because only succesful movie have a Sequel, but I HOPE I HOPE PLEASE PLEASE JOHN DAHL MAKE A SEQUEL. If they make a Sequel I wish one of this 3 (Venna, Fuller or Lewis) die and the other 2 kill Rusty Nail, but I don't know: Joy Ride 2 or not?

I finally got hold of it on DVD and I must say JoyRide is a thoroughly enjoyable film, although it does have its flaws (which are so minor I won't go into them).  The director's use of lighting and subtle shooting techniques really help you believe the main characters are stranded in the middle of nowhere with a killer stalking them.
The DVD is superb - 4 endings (The original being the best, which was sadly cut from the final release).  There is also directors commentary, a featurette and voice auditions for Rusty Nail.

The list of extras alone is instructive: the DVD includes not one, not two, but FOUR alternate endings. The disk also features a ridiculous number of commentaries for a film of this kind, and they're alternately telling and absurd. (Example: Leelee Sobieski talking about how particular Stanley Kubrick was about his orange juice. The poor guy must be spinning in his grave.)
Storywise, the film depends on a series on contrivances starting with a refundable airline ticket and the nonsensical purchase of a CB radio. It's conventional thrills are seldom particularly thrilling, and a villain who might have been scary instead seems to have super powers of the Michael Myers/Jason/Freddy Krueger variety.
There's one effective scene early on as the brothers played by Weller and Zahn put their ears to a motel room wall and hear the first consequences of their practical joking, but the rest of the movie is utterly predictable and, again, contrived. When the principles end up in a Nebraska cornfield, you can practically hear the writer(s) saying ""Wouldn't it be cool if they ended up in a cornfield?"" (Getting them there turns out to be more difficult than perhaps anticipated.) Then there's the climactic motel room trap: ""Don't open the door! No, don't open the door!

1668628,3,B00005UV34,"By definition, a ""joke"" is something said or done to promote laughter or amusement; but more than that, a joke can be a helpful instrument for discerning character, establishing bonds of friendship or merely relieving stress.  Laughter, as they say, is the best medicine.  A ""practical joke,"" on the other hand, is something else entirely.  In fact the term, ""practical joke"" is, in itself, an oxymoron.  It is never ""practical,"" and rarely does it promote ""laughter and amusement,"" especially with the recipient upon whom it is perpetrated.  More often than not, the result is nothing more than the embarrassment and humiliation of the intended victim.  In extreme instances, in fact, it can actually become the antithesis of a joke, ultimately producing dire consequences and repercussions.  Which is exactly what a couple of bored young men discover on a trip across country in ""Joy Ride,"" directed by John Dahl, a film that points up the possibly extreme effects of a single moment of thoughtlessness; and how lives can be changed in the time it takes to draw a single breath.
The drama unfolds between Salt Lake City-- beginning when Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) stops to pick up his just-released-from-jail brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn)-- and Boulder, Colorado, where Lewis has promised a ride to his friend, Venna Wilcox (Leelee Sobieski).  En route to Boulder, the bored and thoughtless Fuller coaxes Lewis into playing a practical joke, via their CB radio, on a trucker they know only as a disembodied voice with the handle ""Rusty Nail.""  Lewis affects a woman's voice, calls himself ""Candy Cane,"" and arranges a rendezvous with the hapless Rusty Nail at a designated motel room.
At the appointed time, Lewis and Fuller listen from the room next door when Mr. Nail shows up and finds someone other than Ms. Cane in residence.  What follows is not pleasant for any of those concerned, and especially for the Thomas brothers, who discover too late that Mr. Nail is anything but hapless.  He is, in fact, dangerously unstable-- and devoid of any sense of humor.  He also has the wherewithal to find out more about the brothers than is good for their health.  At one point, Lewis and Fuller think they've lost him, only to find out after they pick up Venna, that Mr. Rusty Nail is very much present and accounted for; and that's when things take a real turn for the worse.  What began as a moment of frivolity turns out to be a defining moment in their lives, and it's the beginning of a seemingly endless nightmare for all of them.
Director Dahl has crafted and delivered a film that is part ""Duel,"" part ""Breakdown"" and a ""Ride"" that is altogether wild and adrenaline inducing.  This film is not what you think it's going to be-- it's much more.  What Dahl gives you is some real thrills and genuine menace, delivered with a solid impact and a subtle message about doing unto others and stopping to think before you speak.  And the young, unaffected and inexperienced may shrug it all off with a laugh, but there's a real lesson to be learned here about the difference between a high school or college dorm prank, and thoughtlessly provoking a stranger out there in the real world, where a swagger, machismo and all that testosterone will seem ridiculous when you're alone in the dark of night on a lonely stretch of road, and it all comes down to that moment of truth.  Reality can be sobering, and it can be humbling.  And the sad thing is, there are too many among us who choose to learn it the hard way.  But with this film, Dahl gives you a good taste of what it's all about; all you have to do is catch a glimpse of the terror in Fuller's eyes while it's all going down.  Unfortunately, it `s a message that will be lost on those who would best be served by it.
For all intents and purposes, this is a three character drama, and the actors Dahl has cast to bring it to life do just that, beginning with Paul Walker, who turns in a solid and quite natural performance as Lewis.  He successfully captures that youthful, somewhat naive innocence that defines his character, and his portrayal is honest and convincing.  And Leelee Sobieski, as Venna, continues to demonstrate that she is one of the finest young actors in the business.  This is not a particularly challenging role, but she makes it more than it is by bringing a maturity and insight to it that a lesser actor would find elusive.  It's a wonderful performance, and it definitely takes the film to a higher level.
The performance that really stands out, however, is turned in by Steve Zahn, as Fuller.  Zahn captures that rolling-stone, loser aloofness of a guy basically just drifting through life, coming from somewhere that isn't important and going nowhere.  And there's at least a part of Fuller to which just about everyone in the audience will be able to relate and identify.  The same is true of the characterizations of Lewis and Venna, but it's especially apparent in Fuller, and that connection Dahl and his actors enable the viewer to make with the characters and their situation is the predominant strength of the film.  It's a collaborative effort that allows you to fully appreciate what they are going through as the story unfolds.  Also significant is the participation of Ted Levine, who supplies the voice of Rusty Nail, possibly the most menacing voice-over since James Earl Jones created Darth Vader.
The supporting cast includes Jessica Bowman (Charlotte), Stuart Stone (Danny), Luis Cortes (Night Manager), Satch Huizenga (Ice Truck Man) and Jim Beaver (Sheriff Ritter).  An action/thriller that really delivers, ""Joy Ride"" is a rush of ice water through your veins that just might make you think twice about what you want to say sometime; and to whom you want to say it.",1026259200,,5765,4.758032128514056
1668629,4,B00005UV34,"Directed by John Dahl, previously best known for Red Rock West and The Last Seduction (the movie that launched Linda Fiorentino's career), the ironically titled Joy ride is very much a homage to the seventies Spielberg movie Duel but rather than being just a cheap rip-off Joy Ride is in fact a very entertaining, genuinely scary edge of the seat ride, which proves that you don't need a big budget to make great movies.
THE PLOT: The film's instantly likeable hero, Lewis, played by Paul Walker (The Fast and The Furious) a scholarship student at Berkeley, buys a battered 1971 car so he can pick up Venna (Leelee Sobieski), who he has a major crush for, from the University of Colorado and drive her to the East Coast for summer vacation. However, on the way he unexpectedly has to pick up his irresponsible older brother Fuller (the always excellent Steve Zahn) who's in a Salt Lake City jail on a drunk-and-disorderly charge. During the journey Fuller buys a cheap CB radio and involves Lewis in an unpleasant practical joke at the expense of a truck driver with the CB handle 'Rusty Nail' but they find themselves in fear for their lives when old Rusty turns out to be a psychopath who takes a violent dislike to them. From then on, they themselves become the objects of the unseen Rusty Nail's revenge. After several hair-raising encounters, they resolve not to tell Venna of their adventures when they pick her up at the clean, well-lit Colorado campus.
It would be easy to criticise Joy Ride (known as Road kill in the UK). Its premise is hardly original and its reliance on a CB radio as a plot device harks back to the seventies, rather than the present day when everybody (except in this movie) has a cell phone. However, Joy Ride is actually a stunning success due to its faultless direction, which creates Hitchcock like suspense and provides many heart stopping moments. The script is excellent too combining and balancing humour and horror in equal measures, often hinting at violence that is not actually seen and providing nervous moments of humour whilst avoiding corniness. As for the three leads they are perfectly cast with Paul Walker, minus the blonde beach boy locks he sported in The Fast and the Furious, making a good fist of the part of the boy from the wrong side of the tracks in love with the girl from the right side of the tracks played by the equally impressive Leelee Sobieski (Deep Impact). Steve Zahn (Out of Sight) as the misfit brother Fuller is also excellent and he steals many of the scenes with witty one-liners but ultimately this is a movie whose strength lies in the sum of all its parts. Cheaply made it shows that its not big budgets that make great movies its talent and imagination. Here's hoping there's a sequel! Four stars, well merited. ****",1025395200,10,2795,4.682926829268292
1668630,3,B00005UV34,"Joy Ride starts out with an ominously unsettling aligning of events that would make a classic episode of the one hour Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Where it loses its way, pretty much, is right after the scene where the two brothers who are driving cross country learn that they are not as anonymous (to the trucker they have been taunting by CB radio) as they had believed. This scene is a really beautiful pivotal suspense moment, one of the best in recent movies. And the strange thing is, the same great scene also signals the start of the movies descent, right at the point when a whole lot of possibilites should be opening up for it story-wise.
I'll give the makers their due: Simple and obvious as it may seem, the visual correlative for the trucker --the pulsing volume display on the CB-- is inspired. Joy Ride would have been half the movie it is without this device, which acts as the brothers' dark and irresistable touchstone with the unseen trucker. Unfortunately, most of the plot of the movie after the situational setup relies on tired old tricks we have seen a hundred times: exploding vehicles and a cheesy near-mystical unstoppable human monster ala Michael Myers or Jason. It is as if the makers lost the energy to carry off their brilliant beginning and put a hodgepodge of cliches together for final half, hoping no one would notice.
I wanted to like this film, and it definitely does have its early moments. Maybe that will make it work for you. But for me, it loses all believability the closer it gets to the end. I would recommend over Joy Ride ""The Hitcher"", ""Duel"" or even ""The Car"" to name three films that no doubt influenced it. But if it has to be new, this film may do.

Leelee Sobieski looks like a teenage Helen Hunt and has her ability to combine intelligence, strength, and vulnerability.  Few films of this sort have such well acted and engaging characters.
The film works best in its earliest parts in which the two brothers are on their way to Colorado to pick up Ms. Sobieski.  Their amusing banter and pranks are the highlight of the film.  The earliest scenes with the maniacal Rusty Nail are moody and suspenseful, but the film's plot soon takes various outlandish detours, bringing this joy ride to a dead end.  But even at its most ridiculous, the film includes enough wry humor, combined with the cache of viewer good will built up in the earlier scenes, to keep the audience's attention.",1022803200,,1066,4.861878453038674
1668652,3,B00005UV34,"Joyride, while a well crafted suspense thriller, lacks the nastier edge or, more importantly, tighter plotting that makes for a classic thriller.  Perhaps borrowing too heavily from other classic road rage thrillers ""Duel"" and ""The Hitcher"", Joyride tells of a young man who makes the mistake of bailing his black sheep brother out of jail while en route to pick up the unrequited love of his life.  During the long, boring drive the two pick up a CB and play a prank on a truck driver named Rusty Nail.  The prank turns very nasty and the youths soon find themselves stalked by a revenge seeking psycho.  The movie will keep you guessing and the actors play their parts very well, seeming real people rather than stereotypes (which they could have easily been in far less talented hands).  In fact the only character that comes across as less than human is Rusty Nail, and that is a deliberate decision on the part of the filmmakers.
I'd like to highly recommend seeing the alternate/deleted ending on the DVD.  The screenwriters and director really improved on the film's third act (though the closing minutes still needed a bit of work), considering the film used plot elements/style techniques from the aforementioned Duel and The Hitcher, playing homage to the finale of Jaws was a poor choice.

1668654,4,B00005UV34,"'Joy Ride' - a nerve-knocking thriller about two brothers and a girlfriend chased through the byways of America by a monu-mental truck after playing a practical joke - has predictably been compared to Spielberg's 'Duel'; but whereas that film's evasion of human psychology or motivation gave it an abstract or mythic dimension, there's a very good reason why this particular trucker is in a bad mood.  The promise of a midnight motel encounter after long solitary months on the desert road turns out to be the grotesque mirage of a foul-mouthed, middle-aged racist man.  All that built-up desire has to find release somewhere, and the solitude and mental hermeticism engendered by the shadow-existence of truckers suggests the channels won't be so straight.
I thought 'Joy Ride' had much more in common with two recent, acclaimed teen movies - the Mexican classic 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' (both films are road movies with two intimate, but fractious boys jostling over the favours of a more emotionally mature woman), and Larry Clark's 'Bully' (the weird psychosexual relationship between the brothers is a mixture of deep family attachment and boorish thuggery).  It is the relationship between the brothers that is most fascinating, their own sexual suppressions mirroring that of the truck driver; the latter's name, Rusty Nail, suggesting merely a decrepit version of a masculine desire they all share (the film is full of sharp phallic objects, put to squeamishly painful use).  Before they are even seen in the same frame with a girl, the boys are exchanging sex talk, and the fact that both have just spent time in confinement with other males (Lewis in his college dorm with a roomate; Fuller in prison), irresistably leads us to read this banter, and the pracitcal joke (with Lewis really enjoying playing the teasing woman) as deferrals of repressed homosexuality.  The truck, which is always looming large behind them, can be seen as a classic displacement of the repressed, the id that haunts and seeks to destroy the ego.  'Joy Ride' is a morality play, not about the dangers of prank calls, or even of playing with sexuality, but the dangers of denying your true sexual self, which can only become distorted and perverted, destroying all around you, including the girls you profess to long for.
These are mere afterthoughts - the actual experience of watching 'Joy Ride' is one of exhilirating terror (by the end, I was hiding under my seat), punctuated by dread-leaking calms.  John Dahl's three strenghts mark 'Joy Ride' as a return to form - his comic understanding of sexual dynamics between people; his anti-Western sense of empty American plains, which seems initially to be a paradise of unmarked open spaces and automobile freedom, but turns out to be a constrictive labyrinth in which those classic American hiding places - filling stations, motel rooms, giant crop fields - offer no refuge, with the wide vistas by day clamped down by night, and peopled by a Dahlian gallery of hostile locals; his canny sense of class, and the resultant, often unconscious power games it can unleash (see the fetishistic importance of Lewis' credit card) - with new ones, such as a thrilling clarity of narrative, and a facility with the big, suspense set-piece which, like Hitchcock in playful mood, elides the line between horror and hilarity with admirable ease.  This, mercifully, never descends into the flip knowingness of a Kevin Williamson, evincing a more rigorous, 70s-style cinephilia (i.e. 'Joy Ride' is more Carpenter than Craven).  It deserves a place with that other under-rated, terrifically-acted, oddly unnerving teen suspenser, 'Final Destination'.",1021248000,6,3670,5.1237458193979935

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THRILLERS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!",1020211200,,596,4.146551724137931
1668658,4,B00005UV34,I don't want to give away the movie ( i'm sure you've read the other reviews)All i will say is: JUST ENJOY THE RIDE!,1020124800,,116,3.875
1668659,5,B00005UV34,"I originally was attracted to the cinema to see this movie because, simply, i think Paul Walker is the best looking guy on the planet. The reason i entitled my review 'surprised' was because as i watched the movie i honestly found i loved it. Not because of Paul Walker, i'd be lying if i said it didn't have anything to do with him, but i found the plot captivating and strangely original, the way the three main characters stood united and finally the fact the threesome tried to turn thier backs on the enevitable evil on thier tail. In many teen horrors, ie. Jeepers Creepers, they notice deaths and they head straight for it. Silly really and fake. Not in 'Joy Ride', in this film the menace sets out to find them.
I live in England, here the film was released under the name 'Road Kill'. I'm not sure why they changed it because i think both titles are suitable. The film is still in its opening weekend and i went to the cinema last night with some friends. Background information for ya'! lol!
Many critics have described the plot in summary, which i find is hard, as i don't want to spoil it for the budding U.K audiences. Lets see, Two brothers set out on a road trip, (Paul Walker) Lewis' main aim is to score with beautiful, (Leelee) Venna. While, the other, (Steve Zahn) Fuller is desperate to move on from yet another prison visit. Crazy Fuller persuades level headed Lewis to install a CB radio. Thats when the basis of a simple joke begins and they are pulled into a fast paced flee from a ...Truck Driver. As soon as they are joined by Venna she is also thrown into the desperate struggle for survival.
As the bond between the three grows more intense and the driver constructs his (warped) revenge, comedy begins to be incorporated.
All thats left to say is i can't wait untill it comes out on Video!
Prepare to be scared!",1019952000,,1840,4.430678466076696
1668660,3,B00005UV34,"This movie was good it just needed a bit more scary suspense scenes and a little bit more of a ""DEEPER"" plot so to speak. This movie is worth renting. And if you like ""Scary Movies"" I suggest renting it first and then making your own personal decision on whether to buy it or not after you watch it.",1019606400,,299,4.084745762711864
1668661,1,B00005UV34,"...  Guy in Berzerkly buys a junker to drive a childhood acquaintance he wants to sleep with (Leelee Sobieski and her `glass cutters') from Colorado to New Jersey.  Detours through Utah to bail his brother out of jail.  Bad seed brother's influence leads to a string of retarded decisions that end with them managing to incur the wrath of a trucker by pretending to set up a romantic liaison with him over their CB radio.
The trucker is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent and indestructible.  Through means unknown he manages to follow the group in his eighteen wheel rig without being spotted, determine all of their names and figure out where they are going.  His only contact with them is over the CB radio and they never reveal anything to him but their handles, Black Sheep and Mamma's Boy, plus the alter ego Candy Cane.  He must be channeling Karnak to have figured out everything else.  His rig is indestructible, too.  He drives it THROUGH another truck, a heavily constructed and insulated ice truck.  He goes right through the frame portion of the freezer unit of the truck without sustaining any damage to his own vehicle.  Joy Ride's villain has some annoyingly ""Jasonesque' qualities.
In a strange little role reversal, Paul Walker and Steve Zahn generally scream like ninnies throughout the movie while Leelee seems to have the cooler head.  All of the performances are relatively unremarkable.  Zahn, delightful in some of his other roles, needs to figure out that it is quality, not quantity.  Leelee's prescence seemed more based on her willingness to display her turgid nipples throughout the production than any acting ability.  Walker was like a ghost, leaving no impression at all after the movie was over.  He let things happen to him without really reacting to the environment or other characters.  Except for when he and Zahn were screaming like women.  NOT RECOMMENDED.",1019088000,6,1896,4.968253968253968
1668662,5,B00005UV34,"Joy Ride was a great thrill ride. I've seen plenty of thriller and horror movies, but this one is very unique. Psycho truck driver seeks revenge on two guys that ""toy"" with him over a C.B. As they say, basically a prehistoric internet. The truck driver known as ""Rusty Nail"", stalks and decides to play his own little game with them. Not a board game, but a game where the life of one of the brothers girlfriends, is coming to a stop. The movie takes you into spins and thrills, both scary and funny, but in the end your heart will be beating fast, as the race between life and death begins. I learned a good lesson...don't anger a trucker!",1018569600,,640,4.341666666666667
1668663,5,B00005UV34,"this is what great suspense/horror movies are all about.  when it first came out i was a little skeptical about it.  i mean come on a trucker trying to kill some kids because of a joke?  but i saw it for the first time, and i was like S*@t.  they made this totally believable.  not only that, but totally creepy.  Ted Levine's voice as ""Rusty Nail"" is perfect.  if you don't know who that is, he's Buffalo bill in silence of the lambs.  but his voice has matured a bit, in a creepy way.  This is a great movie, i watched it twice in a row to see if i could believe it twice in a row and i'll be damned if it wasn't better the second time around.  Great acting from all 3 actors, though at times i felt like paul walker was a little too valley for my taste.  steve zahn continues to crack me up even in a movie like this.  Buy it, rent it, borrow it from a friend...just watch it.  oh and if you borrow it, just make sure you return it.  i hate that!",1018310400,,949,3.9263157894736844
1668664,5,B00005UV34,"I recently rented Joyride and to say the least it was an impressive horror thriller. It also has just enough comedy to keep you off guard.
Paul Walker stars as Lewis Thomas, a college student driving across country to pick up his friend Vienna Wilcox(Leelee Sobieski). Along the way he picks up his delinquent brother Fuller(Steven Zaun) from jail. Fuller is definitely the best character in the film. Along the way Fuller picks up an old CB radio. Fuller coaxes his brother Lewis to play a prank on a trucker who goes by the name Rusty Nail. Lewis acts like a woman who goes by the handle Candycane. Lewis tells Rusty to meet Candycane at the hotel they are staying at. They tell him to meet Candycane in room 18 at midnight. Fuller and Lewis are in room 17. They see the truck pull and go into the next room. After hearing a disruption next door the call the front desk and ask him to check it out. Everything seems to be fine. The next morning they wake up to police surrounding the hotel. They are interrogated and fess up to the prank they pulled. The police release them. Rusty, however, has not forgotten and he stalks and torments the brothers the rest of the movie.
The movie is well made, the acting was impressive, and the DVD I saw anyway was packed with extras, including 4 alternative endings. I really enjoyed the movie. It kept my interest peaked throughout. I also know that it is something I'm sure all of us have done sometime in our life. Prank someone that is, especially as teenagers. However, after you watch this film you will think twice before you ever pull a prank again. See this movie!!!!",1017792000,,1617,4.4847457627118645
1668665,5,B00005UV34,"If you've seen ""Jeepers Creepers"", ""Joy Ride"" is the film that ""Jeepers Creepers"" should've been, but was not! I think I enjoyed ""Joy Ride"" as much as I did because I was expecting it to fall on it's face somewhere towards the end of the film (like ""Jeepers Creepers"" did the last half and went into utter stupidity!), but ""Joy Ride"" didn't. Director John Dahl kept the tension throughout the entire film -- and most importantly made the main characters believable.",1017619200,,465,4.753086419753086
1668666,4,B00005UV34,"I will not give my thoughts on the movie, just read what everybody is saying about it.

This is big praise coming from a person that hates the teen movies that have been coming out lately...",1017619200,,302,4.611111111111111
1668667,5,B00005UV34,"This movie is so intense. Very gripping and action packed. It will definetely take you for a ride. It's a little creepy to know that there are people out there capable of things like that if they're pushed far enough. It doesn't have a real complicated story to it which keeps it simple yet it draws you in with it's great actors who keep it easy to stay caught up in. Highly recommended for those who like action/adventure/suspensful movies. For the girls out there, it shows Paul Walker's cute [behind], so it's definetely worth seeing for that! Have fun watching this one!",1017446400,,575,4.647058823529412
1668677,5,B00005UV34,"Great film! I regret not seeing it in the big screen. More of a guy's film than anything else. Imagine if you and your brother had to been seen naked in a parking lot and entering a fast food joint! As the story unfolds, the pace will keep you on the edge of your seat. It reminded me of the 1965 thriller ""I saw what you did"" with Joan Crawford. Only this time, instead of the telephone that intervenes, it's the CB radio. Makes you think twice about who is on the receiving end. Another example of what can happen when a prank goes too far!",1017446400,,542,4.122641509433962
1668678,4,B00005UV34,"The ""Duel"" influence seems to be getting heavier.  Breakdown in 1997.  And now both Jeepers Creeper and Joyride have taken elements from that Spielberg telefilm and had moderate success.
Lewis (Paul Walker) is on his way to pick up girlfriend-prospect Venna (Leelee Sobieski).  Along the way he stops and picks up ne'er-do-well brother Fuller (Steve Zahn).  Fuller buys a CB radio for no adequately explained reason and the fun begins.  Fuller convinces Lewis to pull a prank on a trucker by the handle of Rusty Nail.  When the prank backfires and someone nearly gets killed the trucker turns on the two boys and follows them in his truck.  After some cat-and-mouse, the boys escape death a couple of times and pick up Venna thinking that it's over, but Rusty Nail isn't exactly the most stable trucker driving the earth.  The story is pretty much just a chase movie after that.
The movie lost me at the beginning of the third act.  I don't mean I couldn't follow the plot, I just mean that there's a certain scene which turned me off to Fuller and Venna and I didn't care whether they lived or died.  It was the scene just after the three return to the hotel after drinking at the bar.  Fuller goes from being a lovable screw-up to being a backstabbing jerk and Venna is just too stupid (willing?) to say anything.  I know this may seem like a minor point to those who watched the movie, but those characters were completely lost to me for the third act.  It didn't have to be done like that.
The ending is pretty suspenseful, especially if you've seen John Dahl's previous work.  I went in thinking it could have a Seven-ish and it was pretty close.  It COULD have happened a certain way.
The DVD is pretty awesome.  The coolest extra is the ""More than One Rusty Nail"" feature which allows you to listen to the other men who tried out for the part.  4 Alternate endings -- most of which are pretty different from the original.  My only complaint is that the endings aren't ""finished"".  If they had been I'd rank the DVD right up there with one's like Fight Club and T2 Special Edition.
Joyride, like Breakdown before it, is a solid movie that gets credit for being a great movie because it comes from mediocre times.  It's not genre-defining or groundbreaking, but it's certainly worthy enough to go on your shelf.",1017100800,,2316,4.561743341404358
1668679,4,B00005UV34,"Joy Ride was 100% better than I expected and the extras on this DVD was the best I've seen yet!!! The movie handles about two brothers playing a joke on this truck driver and he ends up going crazy and tries to kill them. The movie didn't lack at all and entertained me very well... the only thing I ddn't like in this movie was the actual ending (Not the deleted ones), it made me somewhat angry BUT there are 4 different ending and on the back of the DVD it says not only deleted scenes, but a whole new movie and they were correct! The deleted scenes that include the ending start somewhere in the middle of the movie and goes all the way until the end, and the only thing i have to say is that the different ending made me happy so i was no longer dissapointed after i watch the other endings! This is a great fil and is a MUST BY!!! The acting was also very good, especially from Steve Zahn and Leelee Sobieski, they played these roles very believable!!",1016928000,,958,4.183783783783784

1668681,5,B00005UV34,"I was pleasantly surprised at what a great film this was.  The story of the two brothers traveling cross country to pick up a friend starts off rather low key.  Lewis decides to go pick up a girl he likes named Venna at her college and ends up having to take his troubled brother, Fuller, with him.  The latter decides to get a cb radio and from then on the action begins.  The mischievous Fuller talks Lewis into playing a prank on a trucker called Rusty Nail only to end up driving the guy into a psychotic rampage.  As the film progresses, there is a growing sense of dread as one crazy thing happens after another.  The guys soon learn what happens when you play a joke on the wrong person.  There is even a nude scene for the girls though sadly for the guys, Leelee stays clothed.  This film can be fun at times and Steve Zahn was great as Fuller.
This one is great from beginning to end and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. An all around great film with a solid dvd loaded with extras.  A wild, scary ride!",1016668800,,1018,4.153061224489796

1668684,5,B00005UV34,"That's why I give it five stars.  It shows you can still make a quality scary movie without a lot of computer special effects or other such big costs.  A good film still comes down to a good story coupled with good direction, and this one succeeds magnificently here.
The movie shows how a small prank backfires big time.  A group of people on a road trip pick up a CB radio for fun.  While driving, they pick up a trucker.  The prank is that the guys pretend that it's a hot female.  They get the trucker all hot, and the ""girl"" invites him to a motel.  Not content to leave it at that, they manage to get the motel room next to where the ""girl"" is supposed to meet the trucker.
Big mistake.  Not only does the trucker discover the prank, but he also figures out that the pranksters are next door.  This leads to a vacation in hell for the pranksters, as the now angry trucker becomes an unstoppable force determined to get them.
From then on, it's Terror City, as different plot twists dig our heroes deeper and deeper.  We of course, get several scenes where the truck all of a sudden appears behind there car.  These are done well, but the direction also adds other tricks.  The voice of the trucker coming over the CB is truly creepy, played nicely by Buffalo Bill from ""Silence of the Lambs"".  When they figure getting rid of the CB will solve their problems, guess again, as it conveniently shows up again.
This movie is several cuts above standard horror fare.",1016582400,,1468,4.372693726937269

The rest of the cast including Leelee Sobieski (Deep Impact, Never Been Kissed) also gives a good performance as Veena, and Steve Zahn (The Object of My Affection) brings some great unexpected laughs to this movie as Fuller. Now Lewis and Fuller are brothers and Lewis is traveling cross-country to pick up his girlfriend Venna but after Fuller gets out of jail Lewis decides to pick him up on the way. The two play a prank on the CB radio fooling a Trucker man in to thinking Lewis is a girl who goes by Candycane. They set up a meeting at a motel for the guy but when the girl knows as Candycane does not show up all hell breaks loose. This guy and his Big Rig soon end up chasing these 3 down and refuses to give up. I will not say any more other than this is a great movie that just keeps you wondering and on the edge of your seat.

1668706,4,B00005UV34,"`Joy Ride', a devilishly clever horror thriller, is best movie of its kind since `Jeepers Creepers'; in fact, it's better. While it can be described as a blend of  `Halloween' and `Duel', it stands on its own as an original work. Director John Dahl is an accomplished master of `B' movies, a category in which one almost never wins awards. That's okay, especially when you compare him to some of the hack directors working on `A' list films.
Lewis [Paul Walker], a decent kid, has offered to pick up his friend Venna [Leelee Sobieski], who's in college in Boulder, CO, and drive her home. On the way, he picks up his nothing-but-trouble brother, Fuller [Steve Zahn]. To show his appreciation, Fuller buys a CB radio and convinces Lewis to play a prank on big rig truckers by pretending to be a hot chick looking for some action. When a trucker named Rusty Nail falls for the trick, they send him to a motel room while they listen in in the next room. But things go wrong - horribly, murderously wrong.
The movie works because the script is good and because the director really knows how to set up a scene in order to scare the daylights out of the viewer. If you haven't had your `edge of your seat' fix lately, here you go.",1016409600,,1224,4.464285714285714
1668707,5,B00005UV34,"Joy Ride is a surprisingly good little flick.  It's about a straight-laced Berkeley student named Lewis (Paul Walker, The Fast and the Furious) who has a crush on a girl from his New Jersey hometown.  Lewis buys a used car to pick up Venna (Leelee Sobieski, Here on Earth) in Boulder, hoping the two will bond during the cross-country drive.  But right before he leaves, Lewis finds out his older brother Fuller (Steve Zahn, Saving Silverman) has just been busted for a DUI in Salt Lake City.  Salt Lake City is on the way to Boulder, so Lewis bails Fuller out and agrees to drive him as far as Denver.
Grateful for the bail and ride, Fuller buys Lewis a CB radio so the two can monitor police activity as they speed through the dusty west. Saying the CB is like ""a prehistoric internet,"" the bored Fuller talks his brother into impersonating a woman to lure a desperate-sounding trucker with the handle ""Rusty Nail"" to a hotel room with the promise of a good time.  The boys stay in the room next-door and listen like a couple of giggling schoolgirls before falling asleep.
They awaken to a grisly scene in the next room and shortly thereafter find out Rusty Nail (voiced by Matthew Kimbrough) knows who they are and is hell-bent on revenge.  Dahl expertly ratchets up the tension into an edge-of-your-seat frenzy that only gets the slightest bit silly when Rusty Nail's truck is trying to run them down (it's too much like Christine, Jeepers Creepers or that dopey Metallica video).  Dahl never shows us what Rusty Nail looks like, which helps to make the story all the more disturbing.  Very good movie.  DVD is pretty good, has many extra features and has nice sound and picture.",1016323200,,1683,4.620805369127517
1668708,4,B00005UV34,"This is a very good suspensful movie that relies more on the pychological impact of the story then on blood and gore, there is very lttle and its done in good taste. I missed this movie when it was in theathers last october and almost just rented it, Am glad I didn't rent it because I would have lost three bucks that i could have applied to the purchase. The dvd has three commentrie tracks one with the directior John Dahl, one with Steve Zahn and Lelee Sobersiski and one with two of the writers of the script, a trailer, a short featurette and 4 altrente endings including a nearly thirty minute one and a extened scene that shows zahn and sobersiski kissing in the motel. Now the only bad thing I have to say is fox why so such bad sound and picture on the extra scene and ending, It is really bad for a dvd and would be considered bad for a  vhs even.

I can't speak more highly about his movie. I've seen other movies by this director (Dahl)and enjoyed them -- he delivered to my greatest satisfaction--and I'm usually very hard to please.  The DVD is especially great because of the three separate commentaries and additional endings for the film.  There are also some fun features for ""Rusty Nail"".

I knew it was getting rave reviews, and it looked good, but I still wasn't so sure. I'm glad I gave it a try. Go into this film thinking of such other movies as ""Duel"" and ""The Hitcher"", but only more suspenseful. Two guys on a road trip(played by Paul Walker and the always reliable Steve Zahn)are driving from Salt Lake City to pick up Walker's girlfriend Venna(played by the mighty fetching Leelee Sobieski)in Colorado. On their way there, the guys play a prank on their CB radio. A gruff sounding trucker responds calling himself 'Rusty Nail'.Well, the guys' joke on the trucker backfires and it comes back to bite them in the [behind]. It seems the trucker doesn't like to be fooled. He goes about stalking and terrifying the guys(and later Leelee after they pick her up)on the road. The nasty voice of the trucker might sound familiar. It's supplied by Ted Levine. He played the serial killer in ""The Silence Of The Lambs"". It's not him, however, when you see the trucker. Our three leads are all pretty exceptional. The best is Zahn, as usual. He delivers some solid comedic relief to the proceedings. Sobieski does well with what she has, but isn't given much of a role. Walker is pretty decent as well. The film was directed by John Dahl, who also directed ""Red Rock West"" and ""The Last Seduction"". The film is shot very nicely and well scripted. Not a gore movie at all. It goes for the tension. The suspense. Thank God. There are a few scenes that are just full out heart pounding. I can only imagine if I saw it in the theater. The DVD comes with 4 different endings to the movie. All of them are good and any one of them would of been satisfying if they were used. ""Joy Ride"" isn't going to change the world folks. Far from it. It's sheer fun and entertainment that is meant to entertain and satisfy like a box of popcorn. The movie succeeds in all areas. If your in the mood for a wild and entertaining ride, then I suggest you get cozy in your chair and pop this move in. Prepare yourself for a real 'joy ride'.",1016236800,2,2133,4.388888888888889

Superb thriller is a surprise gem, complete with high-octane suspense and scares.  The initially subdued and creepy set-up builds nicely to the last half-hour, a terrifying knockout.  Kudos to Steve Zahn for a wonderful performance (he also has good chemistry with Paul Walker) and to John Dahl's taut direction.  The film may be a little too elaborate at times with a couple of illogical moments, but you'll be too enthralled to care.  Enthusiastically recommended.",1016236800,,626,5.038834951456311

Because now he just won't leave them alone. The result is an often very scary thriller that holds your attention from start to finish. There's some minor flaws but none are bad enough to ruin the movie. For instance it's a little silly that he always knows where they are and even knows their names and you're suppose to believe that it's because of the CB radio. The film packs enough of a punch that you don't care though.
  I read some reviews here and I saw a few complaints about the ending but I must say I really liked it. Well anyway if you don't like that one there's 4 alternate ones on the dvd and I must say that all of them work. Rusty Nail's (the truck driver) fate is a little different in each one.

You never get to see what he looks like.  Was the movie original?  No.  It is a crazed trucker who chases down a couple of guys who played a prank on him.  Was it entertaining?  Yes!  It had a good mix of suspense and humor.  I saw 'Duel' a long time ago when I was young and I barely remember it, so this didn't spoil the movie for me by comparison.  This movie may have struck home with me a little more, because I was chased down by a crazed trucker a few years ago, so I know they're out there.

1668715,4,B00005UV34,"""Joy Ride"" got many rave reviews when it was playing in theaters, and now I see why.  The suspense is unrelenting.  I liked the unusual villain, voiced by Ted Levine (unforgettable from Silence of the Lambs).  It seemed like he had an almost supernatural hold on the trio of main characters, and his moves were certainly unpredictable.  The cat-&-mouse game between the Nail's big rig and the brothers' vintage automobile reminded me of another similarly suspenseful movie called ""Duel,"" the debut three decades ago from a director named Stephen Spielberg.  That movie also featured an automobile driver being hunted by a never-seen truck driver.  The DVD of ""Joy Ride"" has a bunch of interesting extra features.  One of the alternate endings starts about half-way through the film and was about half an hour long!  (And it unfolds in a very different way from the theatrical version.)  And the feature that allows a side-by-side comparison of three different voices for the killer (incl. Eric Roberts) was fun.",1015977600,3,1011,5.042168674698795
1668726,3,B00005UV34,"Joyride is about a young collegiate who suddenly one day finds that his long-distance female friend-hopefully with benefits-has broken up with her current boyfriend because he was getting too ""serious"" (I like hearing that word out of college students' mouths, I really do).  Well, faster than you can say GONE IN 60 SECONDS, our lead male played by Paul (my `car' movie was way better dude and yes the first 15 mins of it was about a tuna sandwich!) Walker, is embarking on a cross-country journey to pick up his wannabe squeeze Vena, played by Lelee Sobieski.  Along the way, our hero picks up his useless brother, who has once again been arrested for an alcohol-related incident.  Since they haven't seen each other in some 5 years, you would figure they would do some catching up...but instead decide to alter their fates forever by playing a not-so-original joke on a CB radio.  They start a conversation with this man (with the voice of Ted Levine, unbilled; yes that voice u hear is familiar, he played Buffalo Bill in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) who goes by the handle ""Rusty Nail"".  Paul pretends to be a female and starts a flirtation with this Rusty Nail of whom they know NOTHING about, and eventually takes the joke to the extreme of inviting the lonely trucker to meet him/'her' to a hotel in room 17 (while the two brothers stand idly by in room 18 and get to be `in' on the joke).  Well, the movie starts to go in various predictable directions as our two brothers are menaced by the now very peeved and relentless Rusty Nail; giving them a ""break"" per se, and then eventually menacing all three of our headlining stars in a sometimes frightening and claustrophobic (but predictable) manner.
 Ok, so what are we dealing with here you ask?  Well, I could steer you picky viewers away by telling you that JOYRIDE is anything but, and is merely a rehash of Steven Spielberg's ultimate classic DUEL with a hint of Scream-like humor and pace; with a consummate air of predictability that is consistent throughout.  But, taking the film at face value, the film is fun and has some very tense moments.  It definitely isn't as funny as it thinks it is, but has a few laughs courtesy of the always-humorous Steven Zahn.  JOYRIDE is one of those time-wasters, a movie that wasn't intended to be dissected under a microscope and picked apart like I did in the in the first few sentences of this paragraph (hey I have to appeal to the masses here).  It was made to entertain, and does on a few different levels.  It succeeds as a good thriller with decent acting (though as good-looking as Paul Walker is, he would DEFINITELY benefit from some acting classes-lets just hope he doesn't go the Keanu route and wing it throughout the rest of his career), a genuine sense of paranoia that lingers whenever we aren't aware of the villains whereabouts, and some well-placed scares throughout.  It won't become a classic, but if you are in the mood for a little formulaic thriller with bite, then this just might be the thriller for you.",1015977600,6,3032,4.632462686567164

JOYRIDE is definitely one of the best ""road"" thrillers i've seen since BREAKDOWN with kurt russell a few years back. it's intense, and really does keep you floored. i totally enjoyed the movie, but the DVD is what really sold me. it has a lot of extra features, putting most current DVD releases to shame and making JOYRIDE a must for collectors (we must remember, the DVD format was intended for real movie fans). the ""4 alternate endings"" pushed by the ad campaign & box art are pretty cool. the main one is 30 minutes long, and is totally different from what happened in the theatrical version. the 2 others are only slightly different (and shorter), and the last one is only in storyboard form. you also get 3 commentary tracks, which also run thru all the alternate stuff & the one deleted scene. also of note: sometimes, deleted/alternate material is of very reduced and questionable quality. JOYRIDE's extra stuff isn't quite on level with the actual film's presentation, but is a lot better than a lot of others i've seen. the footage is complete w/ sound and fx, and the picture quality is just slightly grainy. also, there are a couple really cool interactive features that are pretty unique. one allows you to view a scene and flip the audio button to hear 3 different actors' versions of the voice of the killer on the CB radio. another allows you to gain access to alternate footage while viewing the actual film. very cool, definitely worth your time and $$.",1015977600,,1589,4.618374558303887

1668729,3,B00005UV34,"Another cheap suspense thriller.  In fact this is so tame that it could have been PG-13, in fact if you want to know the truth the only reason this rated R is because they say... one to many times (by my count at least 10-15).  That is a cheap way to have an R rating.
Teh story revolves around two brothers on a road trip to pick up this lady friend of theirs.  On the way they get one of those Trucker Radios and they play a prank on one specific trucker named Rusty Nails.  When the prank goes way out of hand the trucker decides to go after them and the lady friend.
What's funny is that most of the violence revolves around the trucker either ramming the car or chasing them.  There are onl;y two moments involving guns, and both are in the end and have nothing to do with the final outcome.
What's even more pathetic is that in the end they took the Hollywood route and left it open for a sequel.  That is sad.
As for special features, lets just say there is only one deleted scene, four alternmate endings (warning, the original ending is basically the last 30-45 minutes in a different sequence, and a little more violent {but not much}).

The truck driver was just some big fat dude, nothing special or scary. I just couldn't get into it, and it just didn't work on a few levels. It had some nice scenes, like the big bad truck going THROUGH this other truck in the beginning. The cornfield chase was nice looking. The end was nothing special.

John Dahl (""Red Rock,"" ""The Last Seduction"") delivers a noirish and stylized tale about a college guy preparing to fly home for the summer when he has a chance to pick up a girl he has a crush on and drive her home. It's a no brainer.  He sells his plane ticket, buys an old convertible and along the way bails out of jail and collects his older black-sheep brother.  At a rural gas stop, they install a junker CB radio and tease a trucker in a girl's voice, telling him to meet at a motel at midnight.  It's a cruel joke they get away with and soon forget as they race to where they hook-up with the girl.  Paul Walker and Steve Zahn are terrific as the brothers and Leelee Sobieskei is a natural as the pretty, would be girlfriend.  It should be no surprise that the trucker is not out of the picture, but now there's a real girl to menace in horrific payback.  The direful voice of the trucker is malignantly rendered by Ted Levine (the killer-skinner in ""Silence of the Lambs"").

1668755,5,B00005UV34,"""Joy Ride"" is one of the year's most exciting and intense rides. Director John Dahl directs a wonderful young cast through a smart, well-paced script that provides a great deal of suspense and thrills, all of which add to the effect that the final showdown will have. There was not a moment in the film that my interest dwindled, and when it was over, I wanted to keep watching.
It's the beginning of summer, and college student Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) is on his way to Boulder, Colorado, to pick up girlfriend-hopeful Venna (Leelee Sobieski). On his way, he stops by to retrieve his brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn), who convinces Lewis to play a prank on a trucker (""Rusty Nail"") by speaking like a woman on their CB radio. The prank works, so much so that they arrange to have the trucker come to a motel room next to theirs at midnight that same night. And, the next day, a situtaion happens to them is one that they will NEVER forget. What ensues is a combination of gutwrenching suspense, and a great directorial effort.
By this time, Dahl has built an incredible amount of unease and tension, much of which comes from the fact that the killer is never revealed in full form. We are never given a glimpse of his face, and much of the time it is his voice or the looming headlights of his truck that provides the fear factor. This high level of suspense keeps us so intrigued that we are able to overlook small details of logic, such as how the trucker so easily maneuvers such a large vehicle, or how he keeps track of their whereabouts.
Accompanying this justly acclaimed suspense factor is an incredibly paced script, which stands out as one of the better scare plots to come out in recent years. Dahl takes the material and keeps it moving at a rate of speed that allows us to understand what's going on and, at the same time, want more and more. When the climax arrives, the pace reaches a fever pitch of energetic suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat, holding my breath.
Part of the success goes the the convincing characters, each played by actors who give equally convincing performances and share great screen chemistry. Paul Walker, Steve Zahn, and Leelee Sobieski, especially, each have a wonderful knack for playing themselves as upbeat and carefree one moment, and completely frightened the next. Zahn is particularly effective, providing much of the movie's laughs, while at the same time instilling in Fuller a sense of sheer terror. Sobieski has less onscreen time than her two costars, but manages to turn in a well-rounded performance that fits the story well.
The good thing about ""Joy Ride"" is that none of these attributes diminish once it's time for the big showdown in the end. Up to and right past this point, everything moves quite rapidly and effectively, building us up for an ending that doesn't disappoint, and lives up to the standard set by the plot before it. The plot is full of suspense and energy, and the cast is, among other things, believable. The title is a perfect description of the film itself, which, in this humble critic's opinion, is one of the year's best films.
I can't remember the last time I had so much ""fun"" at the cinema. The villain, ""Rusty Nail"" has the scariest voice! Listening to him talk on the CB radio (""Candy Cane... I'm looking for Candy Cane..."") is enough to send a chill down your spine. You'll have to watch the movie to know whether he does show his face or not in the end.
This movie ends with a ""delicious"" twist.... to pave the way for a ""Joy Ride 2"", maybe?

(Fuller Thomas), Leelee Sobieski (Venna Wilcox), Jessica Bowman (Charlotte Campbell), and habitual antagonist Ted Levine (Rusty Nail), John Dahl's (Rounders, Last Seduction, Red Rock West) effervescently dynamic Joy Ride is a spaciously well performed thrill ride which weaves a thematically eloquent and morbidly psychological laced narrative that habitually leaves the viewer breathlessly craving more and hesitantly doing so. Graced with an abnormally textured and unreservedly robust cast of characters, an astoundingly effective ambiguous antagonist that harkens back to the insanely unforgettable thriller villains of the 60's and 70's, outrageously wicked erratic story twists that even contradict a hardened Thriller Fan predictions, and an expertly evasive droll wit that reinforces Joy Ride's unaccommodating manipulation of intelligent fear with an unadulterated depraved sense of humor that spikes the film's thrills with unexpected and uncomfortable laughs in typical Hitchcockian style. Joy Ride seems to have it all.
Joy Ride commences by the telling the tale of Lewis Thomas's college summer break. Lewis has been platonically friends with Venna Wilcox for a while now, and after impulsively selling an airplane ticket home in exchange for an inexpensive automobile junk heap. Lewis decides to do the chivalrous thing and drive all the way to Colorado to pick Veena up from college and take her home for break. On the way there, Lewis discovers that his consistently immature older brother Fuller has been arrested in Salt Lake City, Utah, and his mother would like for him to pick him up. After picking Fuller up, Fuller purchases a CB player, as a gesture of gratitude, and begins to pull verbal pranks over the CB player. This leads them down an initially seemingly innocent trail of zestfully energetic humor that eventually stales into a fully unadulterated descent into unfathomable
details of grisly horror and indescribable anxiety.
Joy Ride represents the metaphorical zenith what a thriller should deliver on a regular basis. Instead of providing the audience with overabundant gore and exceedingly outrageous cleavage and nudity, why not just tell a comprehensively sound story that amuses with ingenuity rather than excess. Charged with indulgently clever shrewdness in its presentation, Joy Ride demonstrates acutely the rather sparkling joys of suspenseful storytelling that as of late continue to be ignored
by a majority of the Hollywood establishment.
As for Joy Ride's upcoming DVD release hopefully it includes a ravishing anamorphic widescreen presentation, an informative John Dahl commentary track, deleted scenes, and documentaries. We'll have to wait and see.
Deliriously recommended to anyone who really enjoys a tearfully intense movie and even those who don't. Footnote: Ted Levine also played the unforgettable antagonist Jamie Gume in Jonathan Demme's Silence of the Lambs.

1668762,3,B00005UV34,"""Joy Ride"" is released in Japan with the changed title ""Road Killer,"" and probably this alternate title will tell you what you see in this thriller.  Frankly, it is a B-movie, but not without merits.
Basically, the concept itself has been what Steven Spielberg did in his made-for-TV-movie ""Duel,"" which deservedly put his name on the map.  So, if you have never heard about it, just check it out first.
And if you have seen ""Duel,"" you might have known that there are so many followers of the masterpiece, and ""Joy Ride"" is one of them.  But don't get me wrong; this is not to complain.  I rather enjoyed watching ""Joy Ride,"" and the reason is its director, John Dahl (of ""Rounders"" and ""Unforgettable.""
Director John Dahl is good at using light (mainly red) and here certainly delivers a sinister atomospher in a local motel, where the two young boys, Steve Zahn and Paul Walker, are staying to witness and eavesdrop the embarrassed ""Rusty Nail,"" who, deceived by them on CB radio conversation, comes to the appointed room to meet ""Candy Cane.""  Here is the director's skill at its best.  With his trade-mark red lighting and slow camera moving, Dahl surely succeeds in creating a really scary moment.
We regret that the story cannot hold the tension for long.  After that, the movie gradually goes downhill, though as a thriller it still has its moment.  However, some of the plot twists are predictable, and what is worse is the character of Leelee Sobieski joins the ""ride"" only in the latter half of the movie.  And the final surprise (now this is becoming a sort of clithe) seems to defy the logic.
Overall, this is an enjoyable ride, and as I like Leelee Sobieski, I won't dislike it.  But as I like her (especially her in ""Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,"" I am disappointed by the way they used her character.@I feel so all the more because the two leading males are doing very good job.",1006473600,,1896,4.649700598802395

I can't remember the last time I had so much ""fun"" at the cinema. The suspense in ""Joy Ride"" is taut and heart-pounding while the laugh moments are also plentiful. The movie's about the danger that 2 brothers, Fuller (Zahn) and Lewis (Walker) get themselves into after their ""seemingly"" harmless prank on their car's CB radio goes horribly wrong when their ""victim"", a truck driver (who calls himself ""Rusty Nail""), decides to get even with them. Watching this movie was great fun! Loud LAUGHS from the cinema audience during the funny scenes and SCREAMS from the female (mainly) audience during the ""scary"" moments testify to how effective the movie is. To me, one of the most hilarious scenes is the one where Fuller goes to the rescue of Venna (played by Sobieski) who is being harassed by a bunch of men in a motel bar.

I'm not going to lie, there were some parts in the very beginning and the end of the film that I liked. The ending is definitely what you would call a ""nail biter"". I think a good number of teens will probably enjoy the film to some extent. And I usually I'm ALWAYS defending ""teen"" movies. Just check my reviews if you don't believe me! But, the main and most important problem I had with this movie was the fact that it's too predictable! I saw this movie with some friends of mine, and I was literally calling the next scene. I knew when the film was ""playing"" or ""teasing"" us with certain scenes making of believe certain people could be the maniac that was after them.
Back in 1971 Steven Spielberg made his directing debut in a tv movie called ""Duel"" starring Dennis Weaver. That movie, while not a masterpiece, had more excitment to it than ""Joy Ride"" did. The most importmant thing when dealing with a movies like this is that the viewer must identify with the characters. The viewer has to find the characters likeable, we have to WANT to watch them for 90 minutes or 2 hours or whatever. ""Joy Ride"" does reach this goal, sorta. Most teens will like this movie for what it is. But, if you've ever seen a lot of movies, and I'm not talking about movies made in the last 2 or 3 years. I mean if your a serious filmbuff, you'll find ""Joy Ride"" to be predictable. If your looking for a good scare go and watch ""The Others"" or the just released ""From Hell"". Both films are much better than this. Just to give everyone an example of how stupid some scenes were I'll explain one to you. There is a scene were Sobieski, Walker, and Zahn are running away from the truck driver, who happens to be in his truck. Now, for the sake of arguement, lets just say this guy is driving 5-10 mph. How on Earth can these 3 people out run a truck!? And, just so you know, the truck was not going anywhere near 5-10 mph. I would guess at least 30. It's unbelieveable scenes like this and the predictablity rate that ruined this film for me. So, despite the fact I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. It was a nice try though. ** 1\2 out of *****",1003881600,,2499,4.307855626326964
1668789,3,B00005UV34,"Believe me, I thought I would enjoy this movie better than what I actually did. I had been waiting for this movie to come out 2 months prior to the release date. It kinda reminded me of a ""Jason movie"". I hate movies that leave the ending open for a sequel(s). Not knowing who the killer is, is a killer. In all, the movie plot was pretty good, but very predictable.",1003795200,,366,4.169014084507042
1668790,5,B00005UV34,"What a movie! If anyone wants suspense, this is the movie for you. Paul Walker is beautiful, too. That's another reason to escape life for 1 hour 50 minutes. Go see this roller-coaster ride of terror. You won't regret it.",1003622400,,221,4.55
1668801,3,B00005UV34,"I had high hopes on this flick due to hoopla, even in this realm of reviews. But alas, i was a bit disappointed. Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie at all, just not the thriller I was hoping for. I gave it a 3 but it takes a lot to scare me, so judge for yourself:)",1002931200,,276,3.6166666666666667
1668802,5,B00005UV34,"This movie was an unexpected suprise, breathed a little bit of fresh air into this genre. Steve Zahn was hilarious, Rusty Nail was a creepy psycho and the climax is totally suspense-filled. There may have been a few flaws, but it should have made more during it's first weekend.!!",1002758400,,280,4.73469387755102
1668803,4,B00005UV34,"Even if daddy takes the T-bird away, darn it! This movie is outrageously entertaining. I was in suspense, I wasn't sure who would live and who would die (anybody is game here), I've never been so impressed with Paul Walker's acting, Steven Zahn can play serious(!), and Leelee was really a good choice. I was a little nervous about her at first, but she made more than many actresses might have with her character....To get to brass tacks: the simple premise of a prank backfiring because the dupe turns out to be a psycho seems like it could be very unoriginal and thoroughly predictable. This movie was NOT. It was tightly directed for one, by gifted director John Dahl, well acted, tense and dark script, gorgeous cinematography (neon lights are just beautiful in this film), and a stunning climax! It's closer to five stars than four but I don't want people to think this is the next Psycho. It's not a brilliant film overall, but it IS brilliantly executed.",1002672000,3,962,4.6982248520710055
1668804,5,B00005UV34,"This movie was total freakishness. It was a disturbing, beliveable account of two prankster brothers who are forced to learn a lesson that they will never forget. The acting was wonderful, the direction was great, and the story and plot where totally convincing and were not too drawn out. Not your typical thriller. The end will send chills down your spine!",1002672000,,358,4.885245901639344
1668805,4,B00005UV34,... Yes at times it had classic horror film happenings which we saw coming but all in all it was a very edge of your seat thriller. We definitly recommend this film for a fun two hours.,1002672000,,185,4.027027027027027
1668806,4,B00005UV34,"Joy Ride was a great movie. Aside from some ... opinions that obviously haven't seen the movie, it isn't reminisiant of Scream or horror pics. ...This movie has an eerie feeling and is good at freakin you out.  The psycho in the truck is well put together, obviously scarry, and yet you can understand how he feels in one scene with leelee sobieski.  Also you never really see him which makes him even more freaky.  The only reason for the lack of a fifth star is that the ending is somewhat not resolved.  Otherwise for the that this movie is definately worth your money and is very enjoyable.",1002672000,,594,4.472222222222222
1668807,4,B00005UV34,"First off none of the other reviewers who gave this one star really know what they are talking about... This borrows many elements from spielbergh's Duel. Also Dahl was paying omage to that film using the same looking car that was in Duel. Also this film was made two years ago but couldn't get released due to columbine or something in that vein. Also Jeepers Creepers is a slasher movie this is a very pulse pounding thriller. It kept me on the edge o my seat the whole time. The ending is also very good, yet a little predicatble. This is a great movie to see with a group of friends if you want to have a great time being scared. I would give this 4 and a half.",1002585600,,665,4.162790697674419
1668808,5,B00005UV34,"Wow.  This movie creeped me out worse than Final Destination did.  It's taken a lot of flak (even on this website!) but it's better than what's said about it.  The acting is actually pretty good, although Matthew Kimbrough kind of hams it up a little too much.  As for the car chase scenes, there are a lot of people who are saying it looks like a cheap rip-off of Jeepers Creepers.  Well, ordinarily I might agree... except that I will almost guarantee you that filming of this movie was finished by the team Jeepers Creepers was released.  Duh.  Yes, I'll admit that it is along the vein of the typical teen horror flick - two guys trying to get away from a psychopathic killer, with the requisite really hot chick in Leelee Sobieski.  However, none of the main characters get killed, and some parts of the movie were actually really funny.  The end is kind of left open - Joy Ride 2, or just to make us all really freaked out?",1002585600,3,929,4.385964912280702
1668809,5,B00005UV34,"I went to see the movie ""Joy Ride"" last night. As I went to the theatre I had very high expectations, and let me tell you this movie did not disappoint. ""Joy Ride"" is one of the best movies to be released as of lately, and definatly the best horror movie I have ever seen. This movie is definatly scary, but thats ok (...). The movie is more than just out to scare you though, it is very enjoyable, at times it is down right hilarious. Steve Zahn gives on of the more impressive performances that I've seen in recent movies. See this movie, it is awesome!!!",1002585600,,557,4.214953271028038
1668810,4,B00005UV34,"I'm happy to report that Joy Ride is NOT just another teen slasher movie, nor is it a Scream clone, instead, it is one of the better thriller/horror film that came out of Hollywood recently.  The Thomas brothers while traveling towards New Jersey decided to pull a prank on a stranger by using a CB radio, posing as a female they agreed to a midnight rendezvous with a trucker who calls himself 'Rusty Nail.'  Hoping to get a good laugh, the brothers found instead that the joke is on them as they flees from the psychotic stranger out for revenge.
What makes Joy Ride scary is its believability, this kind of thing can actually happen, probably not to the extreme as portrayed in the film, but people do play jokes on each other constantly, and some do get carried away.  Composed of a relatively young cast, Steve Zahn (Fuller Thomas,) Paul Walker (Lewis Thomas) and Leelee Sobieski (Venna) did a good job keeping the audiences attention glued to the screen, the pacing was actually well done because there was not a dull moment on this road trip.  Unfortunately, with this genre there is usually little character development, which is true for Joy Ride, but it isn't necessarily a bad thing here.
Joy Ride was an entertaining and short movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, the direction was tight and the script was decent, it's a great film for adults and teenager alike.  Just remember, it's all fun and games until someone gets hurt, and do unto others as you would have them done to you.",1002240000,74,1503,4.635338345864661
