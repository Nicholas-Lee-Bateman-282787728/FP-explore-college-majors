5103187,1,B007PK9NCY,"As a Van Halen Fanatic, I went against my better judgement after reading these other reviews and bought it anyway< because I am such a complete collector. What a waste of money!! Do NOT WASTE YOUR MoNEY !! Period!! A complete rip-off. Buyer Beware !!",1340928000,7,250,4.5777777777777775
5103188,1,B007PK9NCY,"This DVD is A JOKE! Most of the interviews only discuss Roth's solo work, with barely a mention of Van Halen. There is no visual Van Halen content AT ALL. Also, the picture quality is
poor, and the editing must have been done by a 3 year old. A TOTAL waste of money, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",1340668800,7,286,4.035087719298246
5103189,1,B007PK9NCY,This DVD was a not as advertised. It just contained random interviews with David Lee Roth that you can find on YouTube.,1340582400,18,119,4.454545454545454
5103190,1,B007PK9NCY,"Buyer beware. This is the worst video on the subject of the great Van Halen that has ever been issued any time, any where. The only interviews are with Dave, post Van Halen, with the only reference to Van Halen being in passing. No Ed, no Al, and no Mike. The so called ""exclusive biography"" is a quick scroll of text that any 10 year old could have put together. The information given is common knowledge that you can find on any website. It even has the gull to mention that poser, Sam. Avoid this video at all costs.",1340496000,32,519,4.252525252525253
5103191,1,B007PK9NCY,"THIS DVD HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST RIP OFFS EVER! DO NOT BUY!THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS IS THE COVER.THESE DLR INTERVIEWS ARE MOSTLY POST VH.NO MUSIC,NO RARE PHOTOS,NOTHING!AS FOR THE BIO,YOU HAVE TO READ IT! UNBELIEVABLE!",1340496000,15,224,4.769230769230769

8520397,1,B007PK9NCY,"I got to see this for free because there were four copies of it on the DVD shelf at my local library, and even though I didn't pay a cent to view it, I still feel ripped off!  Yes, it's THAT bad, just as all the other reviewers here have said.  It was a complete waste of time to check it out and bring it home.  There's no Van Halen here at all, only post-VH David Lee Roth interviews from TV.  Does anyone really want to hear the sound of DLR's voice without the music of Van Halen behind it?  Well, this DVD has made me realize that I, for one, don't.  This mess is a low budget hack job that doesn't deliver on anything you'd expect from the title or the brief bit of text on the package.  Even more unbelievable than XXL Media's nerve in perpetrating a fraud like this is the fact that TWO people actually want to take credit for it on the back cover, which says, ""Produced by John Wood for Intermedia,"" and, ""Co-Producer Mike Castain.""  What, are Mike and John a couple of unpaid interns who just learned how to use a freely downloaded media editor to convert and stitch together old VHS cassettes taped off broadcast TV way back in the 1980s?  Because that's about what the results look like.  Or maybe not even that good.  Whatever, this thing is an abysmal rip-off that's not even worth watching if you can see it for nothing.  For any Van Halen fans who are actually thinking about paying something for this garbage, save your money.",1358899200,6,1443,4.303703703703704
8520398,1,B007PK9NCY,"Wish I had waited until there were reviews out on this.  I want my money back from XXL Media.  There is NO documentary on this disc.  Like others have mentioned, nothing but poorly edited interviews post-VH and a laughable biography that is quickly scrolling text.  This is a con and Amazon should stop selling it as you clearly do not get what is listed.",1354579200,,355,4.5
8520399,1,B007PK9NCY,"This DVD is a complete rip-off, waste of money DO NOT BUY! All it is David Lee Roth interviews (4)after Van Halen
It has NOTHING to do with Van Halen, and Amazon and the makers of the DVD are MIS-LEADING the consumers. That should be illeagal!!!My mistake was not reading the reviews, but still it shouldn't say ""Van Halen Years"". Unless you want
post DLR interview to waste money on, this is a RIP OFF. AMAZON, you should be ashamed for selling this travisty and mis leading the public!!!",1344643200,2,489,4.50561797752809
8520400,1,B007PK9NCY,"The most boring, egomaniacal drag.  No music, just Dave Dave Dave, as though Van Halen would be nothing without him.  Wasted my money on this one!",1344297600,,146,4.576923076923077
8520401,1,B007PK9NCY,"I have recently purchased 2 dvd's ironically both with the same title.. Van Halen - The David Lee Roth Years  (one was also marked '1983' - it was a bootleg-ed copy of the 1983 Us festival).. this particular one showed minor promise, albeit with no prior description given to my purchasing said item.. all I can say is 'Man am I p***ed off!!'.. like my fellow reviewers before me have mentioned, this contains nothing (and I mean NOTHING) but a poorly video-recorded compilation of interviews of 'Diamond' David Lee Roth made post VH - except one showing him totally wasted and feeling mighty sore and sorry after (allegedly) jumping out a hotel window in 1982 (he's regaled this tale a number of times, changing the location at will).. I love the guy, but I know this is not of his making, he would have had more taste and style than this hackneyed piece of low-grade, low-quality junk.  I'm surprised any quality retailer would carry this to be honest, its misleading and extremely poor quality, no descriptions, details, just a literal cut and paste lump of badly recorded TV shows picture quality is abyssmal... sadly this DVD is a travesty and a rip off.... its a crying shame.",1342483200,,1182,4.705314009661835
8520402,1,B007PK9NCY,"The title of this dvd is completely misleading.  ""Van Halen - The David Lee Roth Years"" would lead one to believe that this would be a documentary about the band Van Halen during their initial period with David Lee Roth as their frontman/lead vocalist, or contain footage from that era, or contain interviews with band members/industry insiders about that era of the band.  It doesn't contain any of that.  It is entirely made up of interviews DLR did with various media types AFTER his split with Van Halen.  I think the name ""Van Halen"" only came up once during the whole dvd.",1341705600,,578,4.637254901960785
8520403,1,B007PK9NCY,"4 old David Lee Roth interviews.  No Van Halen.  No music.  Total scam and waste of money.  To add to this insult, there is a timeline that flashes at the end far too quickly to even read.",1341187200,,188,4.0
