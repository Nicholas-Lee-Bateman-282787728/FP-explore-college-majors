4547377,5,B0053PTFDK,the first movie came out when i was high school and have had a soft spot for them ever since. I think Fast 5 is the best of the bunch,1354060800,,133,3.466666666666667

4547379,4,B0053PTFDK,"The packaging design looks like it is a foreign release (based on the age/content system; it's not the G/PG/R system); The movies have played fine on my player except for Tokyo Drift. I watched Tokyo Drift and the movie has a section that skips. Fast & Furious and Fast 5 played just fine. I bought the set at $50, and I'm seeing it at $43. Damnit. Oh well, at $10 a movie it was a good deal.",1353456000,,392,4.103896103896104

4547494,5,B0053PTFDK,Great collection of the first 5 films. The tire package is really clumsy to deal with. There's 10 discs and they are all on 1 spindle stacked on top of each other with a very thin piece of foam in between each disc. The foam is extremely light and can be easily misplaced. It's harder than I thought dealing with all the discs. As long as you are careful this isn't that big of a problem. I can't complain about the price. The films look stunning and the audio is flawless. I would recommend purchasing this to anyone who doesn't have the first Fast movies. No regrets with my purchase.,1443830400,,586,4.336363636363636

4547601,5,B0053PTFDK,"As an ordinary person not of celebrity status, Paul Walker's death was very upsetting to me.  It still is upsetting to me.  Shortly before his death I found out he had a charity that helped people all over the world.  I am/was infatuated with him.  He kept his charity under the radar and was very humble and helpful.  I can imagine him being a loving, wonderful father to his daughter.  I wanted to add this series to my collection of DVDs so I could treasure them forever and also because it made me aware of Amazon Smile.  I didn't know of it's existence until I bought those DVDs.  I now purchase everything from Amazon Smile and my charity is of course Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW) 100%.  I am most certain his brothers will do him justice with his charity and keep it thriving.  It is nice to see more celebrities reaching into their pockets to help the common man.  Paul Walker was a good man and he was taken from us too soon!!  May he rest in peace!!!",1424563200,,958,4.320224719101123

4547878,5,B0053PTFDK,"Thanks to Paul and Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez, etc. for a great series of films that only now shows signs of ending due to the tragic death of star Paul Walker. The action and acting are first rate. You would be hard pressed to find a continuing series that puts something new on the screen each episode like these films and never repeats itself. Episode 6 is also a great addition to this series (and also available from Amazon.com) and Episode 7 was in production when Paul was tragically killed in a single car auto accident. Episode 7 is going to be completed and released by Universal using digital computer work to retain Paul Walker in his role in the film. This will probably be the last film then, because I can't see this film series continuing without one of it's major stars gone, leaving only Vin Diesel to head the films. You will enjoy this bundle of films. I have watched these films many times and enjoyed each viewing every time.",1396742400,,975,4.545454545454546

The bundle came in ""taped"" together, and I decided to keep them together, cutting the top of the plastic and using my finger to push the case out of the sleeve. (I like to keep the preservation of the box).

Yes, I did come across one of the movies having a damaged cover, in which I replaced it with a empty blu ray case.

4548088,4,B0053PTFDK,"My wife and I consider these films guilty pleasures because they aren't the most deep or thought provoking films, but they sure are fun. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel (were) are a good team and the supporting cast is usually just as interesting (Han especially). The best of the series in my book is probably a tie between No. 1 and No. 5 although they are all fun to watch. No. 4 gets a few demerits because the CGI of the tunnel chase seems to show some cost cutting and Braga isn't the best villain. No. 2 gets a few knocks because of Paul Walker and Tyrese's constant use of ""cuz,"" ""bro,"" etc. It's strange how that all disappeared when they were all reunited in the later movies. Tokyo Drift (no. 3, but apparently the events take place after 6) is surprisingly well done even without most of the original cast (Diesel makes a brief cameo that seemed unimportant when 3 was released but now is much more key to the series). The drifting in particular was very beautifully shot, especially in the mountain scenes.

This package deal that Amazon sells is well worth the price since Universal hasn't found it necessary to issue a box set yet (presumably they are waiting for part 7 to be released). You still have to buy part 6 separately, but it's a great bargain if you are a fan of the series.

4548300,5,B0053PTFDK,"I saw these for a super great deal shortly after hearing about Paul Walker's unfortunate passing (RIP). I think that sad event helped resurrect a lot of the popularity for these movies, because they were backordered for awhile. But they finally arrived and I had a Fast & Furious-athon shortly after.

I was worried about how Amazon was bundling these due to other reviewers saying that they were all taped together, and could lead to damaging the cases when you pull them apart. But mine came all individually shrink-wrapped, so yes, they were all taped together, but since the tape only touched the shrink-wrap and not the actual cases, there was no damage. After removing the tape and all the shrink-wrap, they were all in perfect condition.

There have been many previous releases of these movies (individually as well as in various bundles), and I think I remember seeing some special features that these Blu-rays are missing, but overall I'm not too disappointed. There are still some special features in each one, enough to keep my attention for a few minutes after watching the movies. I can never get myself to go through hours and hours of special features anyway.

The covers are pretty boring, and unfortunately do not match the cover of F&F6 that I purchased this set with. But at the price I got these for, I was okay overlooking that. I may eventually regret not waiting once there is a set of all 6 (and later 7) movies with matching packaging, but no big deal. If you like these, I would highly recommend buying F&F6 with them. It is one of the better movies, and includes a short homage to Paul Walker and his character, Brian O'Connor, going through highlights of his character through the movies. It really makes you reflect on how sad it is that he is no longer with us, especially since the circumstances involved driving too fast in a sports car (though he was the passenger). Don't take these movies too seriously and remember to drive safely!",1388966400,,1967,4.712209302325581

4548303,1,B0053PTFDK,"This was a Region 2 set. I had no idea what that meant. It will not play in the United States without changing your setting on a laptop or other device such as an Xbox. It will not play on a DVD player. I was told that this was mentioned all over the purchase section, but I did not see it or understand it if it was there. I have learned a lesson on this.

4548337,5,B0053PTFDK,"I did not own the Fast and Furious bundle on Blu-Ray but the price sold me. The fact that you get 5 movies for $7.00 a piece with UV codes, they pretty much pay for themselves.

These movies are great for anyone who loves street racing or the street racing culture along with action movies. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are at their best and really bring a great chemistry to the series. The Tokyo drift is a good movie that allows for some insight into the future of where one of the characters ends up after FF6.

These aren't winning Oscars for the acting but they are great for anyone looking for a fun time with fast cars.",1388880000,,625,4.243697478991597

The Fast & The Furious: It was pretty good would probably again...

2 Fast 2 Furious: I love Paul Walker and Tyrese as actors but this movie should have been ONE BIG DELETED SCENE. It really didn't really have a point and I just felt like it was corny.

The Fast & The Furious Tokyo Drift: This is a good movie especially for the younger audience. Will watch again someday!

Fast & Furious: Another good movie ! Way better than the first 3 I think !

Fast Five: WOW. I love this one. Loved what they did with the vaults. I will be watching this again really soon.

So now I just have to rent the 6th one and if it's good I will buy it. So sad to say it will not be the same without Paul Walker.

The improved video and audio made the films much more enjoyable.  The video was only somewhat better because my equipment upscales 1080i to 1080p, but worth the upgrade.  The sound....great use of all of my speakers.  Vin Diesel is always great in everything he does (except for some really early stuff I have but don't remember the names  of).

I already owned all of these movies on DVD, but I couldn't pass up a deal to get all of them on blu-ray and digital as well. The Fast and Furious series is by far my favorite of all time. It will clearly never be the same without Paul Walker. However, these past movies will give us fans the opportunity to remember him always. He will be missed by lots of people, including myself.

I'm annoyed because part of the reason I ordered this bundle was the customer photos showed they were shipped with slipcovers. But when my set arrived I didn't get any. Just 5 bluray cases taped together and wrapped in plastic. Plus the middle case was cracked on all four corners from the pressure of being shrink wrapped with the rest. I'm kinda crazy about my movie collection and everything has to have slipcovers. So I had to give ebay sharks money for the matching slipcovers to complete the set. The price was still great for me to finally own these on bluray so I can let go of my dvds... So I'll stop complaining now.

4548503,5,B0053PTFDK,"I already owned the first and fifth movies on bluray, but this was the cheapest way to complete my collection.  A franchise that I have loved since the first movie in 2001, and that will now never be the same.

As other reviewers have said, the tape holding the movies together did leave some marks on the cardboard sleeves, but the discs are all in cases so its not such a big deal (I normally misplace the sleeves anyway.)

A great price for 5 great movies.

RIP Paul Walker, watching these will never be the same again.",1386806400,,522,4.350515463917525
4548504,5,B0053PTFDK,"Blu-Rays are excellent. Actual product is amazing and shipping was insanely fast. However I have to agree with other reviewer, the discs came beautifully shrink wrapped but when you remove it 2 pieces of tape are holding the boxes together. In attempting to take it off I ended up throwing away the boxes as they were ruined. They are still in the jewel cases so not a big loss, like I said the product itself is beyond excellent and the price is unbeatable. I won't take a star away because the product, price, and shipping immensely outweigh the tape issue.",1386806400,,559,4.6

The loss of Paul Walker is a traggedy, he'll be greatly missed! His performance in the movies was extremely awesome, a great performer & an actor! Well loved & liked by those he touched & inspired, a blessed Angel taken so soon from us! May the Angels & Heavens embrace him with open arms, know that he was loved by all walks of life!",1386720000,,477,4.252747252747253

4548507,1,B0053PTFDK,Love the Movies. but the rest is just garbage. Case is flimsy. when I received the set one of the dvd pages were just floating around inside the case itself. the disc is covered in french wording i believe. very disappointed. returned it immediately. did not even get full refund.,1386547200,2,280,4.62
4548508,3,B0053PTFDK,"First of all, I would like to mention that it wasn't the movies that got the 3 stars, the movies are awesome.  Like several others have mentioned, the packaging is terrible and the clips that hold the disk pages fell apart as soon as we opened them.  Besides that, we got a foreign or a pirated copy or something.  It looks genuine, but the movie quality is suboptimal, especially for a Blu-Ray set that wasn't cheap.  Also, what the actors are mouthing doesn't match up with the speech.  My son noticed that this is an Italian copy or something like that, so I guess that explains that.  Not happy but by the time we got around to opening the box and watching the movies it was too late to return. I saw someone else that had reviewed the set but didn't purchase it from Amazon saying that he gave it 3 stars to try to balance out the reviews, and he commented that we shouldn't have made the purchase because it said right on the package picture that it was from Italy.  It never said that in the description... ANYWHERE.  So until you receive it, there is no way of knowing.  Also, we are from CO USA, and we got it to play with no problem, just poor quality.  Is this what Amazon is resorting too?  Foreign stuff?  I almost bought a Sony camera from Amazon until I read a review that it too, was foreign and that none of the video taken on this camera was able to play back so all of this reviewers memories were worthless and unusable, so needless to say I didn't buy it from Amazon.  Amazon better change their ways or I will boycott.  And I buy a lot from Amazon and consider myself a loyal customer.  How about some customer loyalty, Amazon?",1386374400,5,1649,4.29126213592233

You were taken from us too early. To those who knew you, you were a charismatic, down-to-earth, friendly guy; you made an indelible impression on those you met. To the millions who know you from movies, you were a cool, funny, intense actor with a winning smile.

You may not have been the most versatile or talented of actors, but you were always the heart and soul of your movies. You were the emotional core of the Fast and Furious franchise, the everyman in Eight Below, the riveting protagonist of Running Scared.

You gave to charity, you posed for pictures, you were a role model for fans. You were a great guy who never got caught up in the celebrity image. The action world will never be the same without you. Yours is a hole that can never be filled.

We miss you, Paul. Our prayers to your wife and daughter.

The Fast and the Furious:
The Fast and the Furious is a nitro-burning joyride that makes outstanding use of special effects, innovative camera work, and a nonstop throbbing soundtrack. From the opening sequence--a high-speed, high-tech truck robbery--the film never drops below the red line. Roaring along at breakneck speed, Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew meet on the streets of L.A. each night to show off their high-powered racers. When new guy Brian (Paul Walker) wants to add his fuel to the fire, he can't cough up the cash to race, but offers up his car as collateral. In their tiny jacked compacts, Dom, Brian, and Edwin (Ja Rule) burst into a high-gear race with Brian nearly beating perennial champion Dom. But in the final moments, he loses the race and his car. Brian's debt is quickly cleared, however, when he saves Dom both from the cops and from a potentially violent encounter with Johnny Tran (Rick Yune), a rival gang lord. Dom takes Brian under his wing--a decision that disgusts his gang but delights his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). The gang never suspects that Brian is not who he seems: he is actually an undercover cop, and though he wishes otherwise, he's there to bust Dom for committing the armed truck robbery witnessed in the opening scenes.

2 Fast 2 Furious:
""Like the high-revving imports and American muscle cars that roar down the streets of its south Florida setting, 2 Fast 2 Furious is tricked out to the max. While Vin Diesel opted for his XXX franchise, this obligatory sequel to The Fast and the Furious benefits from Diesel's absence, allowing returning star Paul Walker to shine while forging a lively partnership with rising star Tyrese, who fulfills his sidekick duties with more vitality than Diesel could ever muster. The Miami/Dade locations are another bonus, lending colourful backdrop to the most dazzling street-racing sequences (both real and digitally composited) ever committed to film. The plot is disposable--former cop Walker and jailbird Tyrese are recruited by the FBI to dethrone a thuggish kingpin (Cole Hauser)--but director John Singleton keeps the adrenalin pumping, enlisting a rainbow coalition of costars (including rapper Ludacris and Chanel supermodel Devon Aoki) to combine a hip-hop vibe with full-blown action while showcasing hot babes, edgy humour, and some of the coolest cars that ever burned rubber. Heed the movie's warning, kids: Let the stuntmen do the driving.""

The Fast and the Furious - Tokyo Drift:
""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has all the elements that spelled success for its predecessors: Speed, sex, and minimal dialogue. The plot doesn't need explication; it's a nonsensical series of confrontations and standoffs that serve to get us from one race to another. Tokyo Drift can most accurately be described as a visual poem about screeching tires, crunching fiberglass, and sleek female skin, set to a killer soundtrack of Japanese pop and hip-hop. The actors are only needed for tight close-ups of narrowed eyes or sweaty hands tightly gripping gearshifts, though Sung Kang, Better Luck Tomorrow, stands out as a vaguely philosophical hoodlum with deadpan charisma. The curved bodies of the cars and the luscious flesh of the women are both shot with a fetishistic hunger. The ""drift"" style of racing--in which the cars are allowed to slide in order to take sharp turns at high speeds--grabs your eyes; there's a strange, spectral beauty to rows of cars sliding sideways down a mountain road at night. Also starring Lucas Black (Friday Night Lights) as our wheel-happy hero; Bow Wow (Roll Bounce) as the scam-artist comic relief; and martial arts legend Sonny Chiba (Kill Bill) as a yakuza big shot.""

Vin Diesel and Paul Walker re-team for the ultimate chapter of the franchise built on speed--Fast & Furious. Heading back to the streets where it all began, they rejoin Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster to blast muscle, tuner and exotic cars across Los Angeles and floor through the Mexican desert in the new high-octane action-thriller. When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto (Diesel) re-ignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). But as they are forced to confront a shared enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to out-manoeuvre him. From convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the wheel.

Fast & Furious 5:
Former cop Brian O'Conner partners with ex-con Dom Toretto on the opposite side of the law. Since Brian and Mia Toretto broke Dom out of custody, they've blown across many borders to elude authorities. Now backed into a corner in Rio de Janeiro, they must pull one last job in order to gain their freedom. As they assemble their elite team of top racers, the unlikely allies know their only shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt businessman who wants them dead. But he's not the only one on their tail. Hard-nosed federal agent Luke Hobbs never misses his target. When he is assigned to track down Dom and Brian, he and his strike team launch an all-out assault to capture them. But as his men tear through Brazil, Hobbs learns he can't separate the good guys from the bad. Now, he must rely on his instincts to corner his prey... before someone else runs them down first.

4548665,4,B0053PTFDK,You are getting what is described. Movies and packaging are good quality and I would recommend to a friends. ABC,1377907200,,112,4.65
4548666,5,B0053PTFDK,"I love these films, the first one came out when I finished school, and i thought it was great.  So what if it kinda resembled a crappy movie called ""Point Break"".  Nothing is truly original these days anyways.  Also for a remake it was pretty good; way different then the original from the 19whatevers but so was ""gone in 60 seconds"" and I liked that too.  As for the shipping yes they tape the movies together, but they come shrink wrapped and all five have cardboard covers of the same thing as the slip behind the plastic... so throw that crap away. Lastly If you are thinking about not buying these because it is not a complete set because it does not have the short films in between you wrong.  If you ordered this set then I think you should know, ""Turbo Charged"" is on The first movie in the extra's about three scrolls down through the menu's. In short you get all 5 movie's and both Short Films. ""Turbo Charged"" on ""The Fast and The Furious"", and ""los bandoleros"" on movie 4 ""Fast and Furious""
Who keeps the cardboard sleeves anyways? I have only kept one out of every movie I own and that was because Iron Man 1 does not have a double cover, it makes cense to keep that one.  Just my opinion here so hopefully this help make up your mind and get this great deal at a great price, and you will be all ready to get Furious 6 when it releases later this year.
Side Note, Both shorts are on YouTube if you cannot find them on the disc menu's and you have to watch them.",1377648000,,1475,4.212765957446808

4548669,5,B0053PTFDK,I have always enjoyed the movies but being able to buy them in a set and on blu ray made it the deal closer.  A nice addition to my video collection and can't wait for 6 to be released.  Would easily recommend this set to anyone.,1377129600,,229,3.9565217391304346

4548671,5,B0053PTFDK,Great Bundle for a great price! Happy with my purchased. I had noticed some would like a gift box  for the collection but honestly when I think about it the only way I would keep them organized would be if the DVDs would all be in one box.

4548692,4,B0053PTFDK,It was good. Good quality movie. Price okay for all 5. Only complaint which is a big one is that it took FOREVER to get to me. I waited over a month for it.,1376956800,,156,3.6176470588235294

Me, I like them, I'm a car guy, I like action movies, and I like pretty girls...that is all these movies have to offer, in case you are not familiar with the franchise.  Do not expect good acting, do not expect a heavy well thought out plot that makes you go ""wow, I didn't see that coming"", do not expect any sort of a realistic premise of any kind.

The movies are even better on bluray because of the action and sharp images. Even the first movie which was created before blurays were popular, the film was meant for bluray.

If you like the Fast movies as much as I do, you won't be sorry if you purchase this.

My only complaint was the tape on the boxes, which a few other people have complained about as well. I spent about half an hour peeling in hopes of not damaging the boxes, and managed to save all but one (just a little bit of the side peeled off, no big deal). It's not a big deal if you don't like to keep the sleeves, but if you're like me and like to display what you have, it's a little irritating. All in all though, it doesn't affect the discs themselves, so I can't really complain too much.

Don't be fooled into buying one-day shipping. I chose my 2-day free Prime shipping. I ordered Sunday at 2:30PM. The scheduled delivery was Wednesday, but I had my movies in my Amazon Locker by 10AM Monday morning.",1373846400,,1044,4.348717948717948

4548780,4,B0053PTFDK,My wife and I love this series. The movies are full of action and suspense making a best of 2 worlds film. I had all of these on DVD but wanted to upgrade them to BD disks. The only problem I ran into was that the tabs that hold one of the multi discs in was broken making it hard to close the case. I still have the cases from the DVD's so I am not worried about the return but am forced to reduce the rating by one star for the defect.,1373673600,,437,3.7096774193548385

I have never had a problem with previous purchases I have made through Amazon, but for not one, but every dvd I bought to not work is outrageous! I am reconsidering the reliability and also the quality of products that are associated with Amazon from now on. I am very upset and disappointed that this has happened, not to mention embarrassing for me due to the fact that I gave them as a gift.",1373587200,5,542,4.271844660194175

4548799,4,B0053PTFDK,"After watching Fast 6 this summer I decided to go back and watch the older movies.  It was fun getting the refresher and watching the characters and actors grow.  Good popcorn action flicks--it is what it is fast cars, decent storyline, good if not very believable stunts--but I'm here to be entertained not dissect, and hot actors/actresses.  I have to say after the first movie I never expected 10 years later the franchise would grow like this--the movies get better with believable plots.

The other reviews have all the special options, so I won't repeat.  Its a good deal, 5 individually packaged blu-rays with a digital copy for roughly $7.  LOL and definitely check out Fast 6, it was worth seeing in the theater :)",1373241600,2,723,4.744

I was a little sketched out because the price was so low but it turned out to be exactly what I wanted!!

4548867,4,B0053PTFDK,"This set came exactly as was expected. Five movies, all in cases the same as you would purchase individually at retail. Only two criteria held these back from a five star rating. Firstly, the short film that took place in between Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious from the DVD Franchise Edition of the first two movies is, for no logical reason, excluded from the 2 Fast 2 Furious Blu-Ray unless I have completely missed something, along with the entire content of the bonus disk, though I understand that was exclusive to that collection. Not a huge deal since I know the entire storyline as I've been a fan since I was thirteen years old, but for my girlfriend who has JUST started watching the series I feel she missed out a little having me explain how Brian made it to Florida and where the Skyline came from instead of watching the short film as an introduction. My only other complaint was that the package came with all five movies taped together with packaging tape. For those who simply discard the cardboard sleeves surrounding the movie cases, no big deal. For me, annoying that the edges of my sleeves are peeled off. Great product, I got it for a steal as a deal of the day. Buy this if you're a FATF fan as there will be at least a seventh movie, so no comprehensive ""the series is over, here's everything"" collection will not appear for likely several more years.",1371600000,2,1387,4.486166007905139

The fast cars and the daring deeds these guys do are unbelievable.  But I personally think the set up on these five movies are out of line.  The Tokyo drift one should not be number 3 because Kon gets killed in that one.  It should be the last one.

For those of you wanting to put a little excitement into your living room then this is the bundle to get.  It will be watched over and over.  Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are a team that should not be broken up.  Looking forward with excitement for Fast & Furious 6!!!!",1371340800,,651,4.185483870967742

(If you want to see him in a totally different role, check out Boiler Room.) The quality of the Blu-rays is very good. I leave it to others to describe the plots. Suffice to say that rare is the movie franchise that holds together with consistent (or improving) quality from release to release. My only disappointment is that the movies have become more about capers and action, less about cars and driving.

I'm a little OCD so the fact that movies 1-4 are color coded and movie 5 isn't is a little frustrating to me, but I'll have to learn to deal with it.

The main negative feedback I have is that they taped the covers together with cheap packing tape before they shrink-wrapped them: so when you pull the tape off you're pulling off parts of the printing/design from the sleeves. So if you don't care about the appearance of the sleeves you're fine, the disks played as expected, but I thought it was a bit careless.",1370217600,43,484,4.6395348837209305

4548915,4,B0053PTFDK,"I think they did a great job of learning from mistakes, developing what works and becoming a very good franchise. each film is better than the last (some would argue that point) and FastFive was a surprisingly good character piece with fantastic action/cars as a backdrop... i look forward to FF6",1370131200,,296,4.823529411764706
4548916,4,B0053PTFDK,"Me and my boyfriend watched the Fast and Furious movies and loved this! We couldn't find the collection in the stores locally, so I went ahead and ordered. Honestly love the fact of having the collection with all the movies. I do recommend. Only gave 4 stars because of the case isn't to durable, but it holds all discs. Just take your time to place the movies back in the case. Not a US made copy, but very well have no issues. Enjoy! Fast 6 is awesome too!!!",1370131200,,460,4.238636363636363

4548918,5,B0053PTFDK,"We all know the Fast and the Furious is a little bit unrealistic sometimes..... But, this series is a lot of fun. I appreciate how it's not full of sex scenes and cussing. I'm not saying there isn't ""sexiness"" in it, as seen with all the scantily clad women around the cars. But there are no deep sex scenes which as a mother I appreciate. They are not cuss word free, but in no way are they one of those movies where every other word is cussing (which makes me cringe because it is unnecessary!) Overall, I say they are excellent because they are entertaining and fun!",1370044800,,569,4.327102803738318

By buying them all like this it was cheaper than buying the box set and it also came with digital Copy and Ultraviolet. I have to admit I have no Idea what Ultraviolet is, but hey I guess now I can try to figure out. Have already watched the 1st 3 of these this week.

Now the big ol' box set has to be opened gingerly to ensure nothing falls out when I want to grab one disk.

It's still functional but details like that SHOULD be shown somewhere on the product description page.",1369094400,31,531,4.6
4548994,4,B0053PTFDK,The movies themselves were very good and worth the money. The only complaint I have is the case was very poorly made with movie banging around inside.

As for the movies, they are all incredible adrenaline rushes! I highly recommend this set! I have mixed feelings about #5 because I didn't like Dwayne Johnson in this movie and there was little to no street racing. In #3, I thought the plot had nothing to do with the rest of the movies. #1 and #2 are by far the best in the series! I watched the ones dubbed in Japanese in Japanese. They did a good job dubbing it. Everything else about the movies have already been said, I just wanted to put this review out so everyone can see what movies are actually in which languages.

The discs play in every bluray player. My player is a Japanese Playstation 3 and these discs came from the UK.",1369008000,,1955,5.167721518987341

4549007,4,B0053PTFDK,"The box is great. The first four movies have subtitles in a lot of languages. What I do not understand is why the last one only has subtitles in English. At least they should write it on the description. I would've liked a heads up. In that way I would've bought the last one separatelyor just buy a 4 box set and the last one individual.
Still a great box set.",1367452800,,361,4.098591549295775
4549008,3,B0053PTFDK,"The movies resolutions throughout is flawless and couldn't be any better on blu ray, the only issue was the amount of time it took to receive the package, i received it well over a month later and it definitely exceeded the time expected for delivery. It's a great series and definitely playable on PS3, which took none of the resolution or features away. Great buy, just would've been better if I had gotten them in a lot faster. Never had this problem ordering other blu rays from Amazon.",1367452800,,490,4.579545454545454

4549010,5,B0053PTFDK,"I didn't realize this was coming from the UK.  That said, that was my fault that somehow items from UK sellers were on my page.  I'm not going to dock Amazon or the rating for that because it shipped so quickly.  The only thing I didn't like was in the description, they didn't list the Audio / Video types included in this Blu Ray Pack.

Let me clarify.  This has the same content like the US (Region 1) version, except it's Region Free.  The Audio is English (DTS-HD High Res Audio).  I believe all of the audio languages are: German (DTS 5.1), English (DTS-HD High Res Audio), Italian (DTS 5.1), French (DTS 5.1), Japanese (DTS 5.1), Spanish (DTS 5.1).

The Blu Ray quality is great.  My only complaint is the box set (book style) came with a broken hinge, so one of my Blu Ray disks flops around.  It seems like a pretty flimsy, so I will just have to remember every time I pull them out.

All in all, if you love this series, you'll love the set!  As my wife says, hot women and fast cars, what's not to like? :)",1367366400,,1017,4.212435233160622

And I also watch a lot of Ultra Violet and iTunes movies, so this is perfect for my home blue-ray, my iPad on the go and for the Nexus 7 for work. So basically you are getting three versions per movie, not bad. I ordered this bundle as of ""Deal of the day"" and got it for 37.00 bucks.",1366934400,11,339,3.788732394366197

4549014,4,B0053PTFDK,"This is a bundle of five ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies. Please note that this is not a box set, it is just the five movies sold together - each movie comes in its own separate blu-ray case. Video/audio quality varies by disc, but is generally excellent; these discs also include a variety of special features that take you behind the scenes of the making of the movies.

The Fast and Furious films vary greatly in quality, but they are all entertaining.  If you are into cars or the racing culture, then these movies are made for you.  I'm not much of a car guy myself, but I enjoyed these films because of the car chases and stunts, which have become progressively more over-the-top but are always fun to watch.  My favorite of the films is the most recent one, ""Fast Five"", which is less of a racing film and more of a heist movie.

In addition to the blu-ray disc, each movie also comes with a Digital Copy (compatible with iTunes) and an Ultraviolet copy which allows you to stream the film on various devices.

If you've never seen the Fast & Furious films, or if you're a fan but have yet to buy them, then this collection of five films on blu-ray is the perfect set for you and comes highly recommended.

When it arrived, tiny blue plastic fragments fell out of the box and the disc holders were broken with Disc 2 and 3 and 4 holders falling to the floor. However, who cares. The discs were in great shape and still play fine and this is even better than some US productions with crystal clear surround and picture and all 5 movies in one set. You cannot find this in the US and matter of fact it is cheaper than buying 2 of the movies Blu Ray in the US. The only drawback, the case is a bit tough to close and you have to play around with it a bit to close it securely, plus the broken disc holders but that is it.",1365292800,3,813,3.9036144578313254

So I tried it on my PS3 and it still took forever to load. Needless to say I returned it for a refund.

4549037,2,B0053PTFDK,I am sure I will love the movies when I get them...I ordered them right at a month ago..even though they are not late according to the sellers time frame I am very frustrated and disappointed that I have not received them...,1362355200,,224,4.357142857142857
4549038,4,B0053PTFDK,"While I love the movies and they were exactly as I ordered I was a bit discouraged by the packaging.  When I opened the package I noticed that even though there was no external damage to the outside of the DVD case in general the inside of the case (the part that holds three of the five disks) were broke. I expected to have everything in tact and in fact it was not. When packaging and sending this could have been done better. The package was sent in just a bubble wrap container and although there was no external damage done to package it appeared that it was broken prior to shipment.

I would recommend these movies as they are great action packed movies!",1362355200,,662,4.330645161290323
4549039,3,B0053PTFDK,I love all the fast n furious movies. I was excited when I found all the movies on blu ray and in one box set. When I watched the movies I noticed tht some scenes on the movie were a little distorted and not to mention the movies come in widescreen edition not full screen. Over all the movies are good but wished it came in full screen,1362009600,,336,3.9558823529411766
4549050,4,B0053PTFDK,It good the only bad thing is that is a long wait to get Ur product other than that its good,1361836800,,92,3.4285714285714284
4549051,4,B0053PTFDK,Great set. Not released in America so you have an international rating system on the box. Box was cracked when I received it. The seller gave a 10$ credit. A few freeze spots in the 3rd movie but it doesn't take away from it. For the price great deal.,1361577600,,251,4.142857142857143
4549052,3,B0053PTFDK,The movies were all very good but the only problem was the case was broken and the DVD's flop around inside the case,1361404800,,116,4.086956521739131
4549053,1,B0053PTFDK,The case was damaged and hard to store the disks in after opening. They were not new disks like it says. don't buy this product.,1361318400,2,128,4.16
4549054,1,B0053PTFDK,I don't normally write this but the packaging this comes is absolutely horrible.  Upon opening the box it fell completely apart.  Also it was made in Germany and nowhere on this product info says thats its non us format.  Lucky my PS3 still played or I would have returned immediately.,1360972800,,285,4.66
4549055,5,B0053PTFDK,If like any of the movies the blu ray version is the way to go. Action scenes so crisp and clear.,1360540800,,97,3.6666666666666665
4549056,3,B0053PTFDK,"If you love the movies this is a great buy for the movies however the case it comes in just plan stinks.  It has those hard plastic folding pages that have hinges break really easily, in fact they were already broken when I got them.  As some other reviewers have pointed out this is not a US release set apparently however the discs play fine on US blu-ray without doing anything special.

The last two movies are kind of difficult to tell what they are.  The movie title is not on the disc itself so you are relying on the order the discs are in to make sure you watch them in the right order.  Keep that in mind if you take more than one out at a time.

Fans of the movie that don't have them on Blu-ray will like the price tab but I think we get what we paid for in regards to packaging.",1360281600,4,791,4.006369426751593
4549057,3,B0053PTFDK,"movies are good quality..crystal clear, however the package was ridiculous. two different blu ray sleeves with 2 in one and 3 in the other. the boxes were not attached to each other. they were taped.  i don't know if it was suppose to be attached or whether the main box was lost and they rigged it that way. i ended up super gluing the box to each so it doesnt look that bad.",1359936000,,376,4.1506849315068495

Well I learned this the hard way.  The company refunded my money but I had to pay postage to Italy, and fill out custom forms etc.

Company should not fill orders in wrong regions.  Hope this helps you investigate when it says only works in  region 2 etc",1357862400,2,366,4.084507042253521

4549073,3,B0053PTFDK,"The movies play just fine and I did get all the movies I expected in blu-ray.  One of the movies, Tokyo Drift may have skipped once, which was weird, and could have been a fluke.  We just questioned it because the packaging the movie came in broke right away... so it made us wonder about the quality of the entire product.  The DVD set was cellophane wrapped, all 5 in a blue plastic box.  My biggest complaint is that the 2 inside pieces that hold 4 dvds and flip as the pages of a book completely broke upon the first time opening.  The plastic pieces for both ""pages"" at the top, that held little peg like pieces into them, allowing easy turning broke right away.  It's difficult to explain, but the bottom line is the ""pages"" are no longer held into place and fall out easily when we open the case.  Sure, I can probably duct tape it, but not what I was expecting.  As far as we know the actual movies seem fine.",1357603200,,917,4.2298850574712645

4549077,1,B0053PTFDK,"I ordered the Fast and Furious 5 disc series for a Christmas gift. Unfortunately when they arrived...they were in Italian! The DVD's don't even work on the DVD players that are sold in the U.S. I find this very problematic because the advertisement for this product is all in English and on an AMERICAN website. It says it comes from ""The Little Music Shop"" which sounds to me like a store in AMERICA. When the product came the receipt was all in Italian I couldn't even read it so why was it advertised in English?? Seems a little misleading and dishonest to me. I went to try and send the movies back, well it costs $35 just for the shipping. Obviously I'm not going to pay almost what I paid for the movies just to send them back. So now not only am I stuck with DVD's I cannot even watch, I'm out 45 bucks! ""The Little Music Shop"" is fraud! I'll never recommend them nor will I buy from them again.",1357171200,2,902,4.25
4549078,2,B0053PTFDK,"I got this a few days ago and I love this series, this was a great deal. Few problems though. For one the discs do not have titles so you don't know which movie is which (unless I miss the titles). Also the case is HORRIBLY made. It comes with a ""clasping"" lock when you clsoe it, except have the time it doesn't work. Also each disc comes on a circular piece of plastic each in its own snap in holder. Problem with that is two of my holders are broke so the plastic (with disc) just bounce around the case. Aside from that the movies seem to work fine.",1357171200,,553,4.036363636363636

4549097,5,B0053PTFDK,"I really love fast cars... And of course I don't quite appreciate speed limits... That's why I love these movies.... They can take me to a place where my dreams come true... Drive fast cars, without watching for speed limits and the best part: without the risk of accidents...(this only happens on movies and games, not in the real world).

The video:
This boxed set is full hd 1080p.... Which is really amazing for watching on a big flat screen. The action runs smooth, without ghosts, and other coded glitches. The colors are extremely vibrant and you can feel the speed.... The parties and explosions.... It's a sure 5 out of 5!

The sound:
The surround effects are really amazing.... You can hear the cars around you, you can really hear the engines roar.... That takes the experience to the next level. I always thought that the video is of extreme importance, but the sound that really creates the atmosphere for the different scenes.
The soundtrack for these movies really match the context... Definitely a 5 out of 5!!

The plot:
Some may say its lame! Some may say its a bad influence for real world drivers! Of course real-world drivers should not try to do those stunts while driving, but that's why it's a fictional work.....
I like the story of the series! I think there's a little bit of romance, a touch of friendship, a bit of trust and loads of fast-paced action!!! The story is very simple and I really think the reason is that these movies are only about cars and speed... The 5 movies also kinda relate to each other via some recurring characters. They are worth a 3 (maybe 4) star rating.

Overall:
Great video, stunning fx, extremely hifi audio and an ok plot. I'd give it a 5 star overall.
If you like fast cars, I know you'll love it. If you're a big Need for Speed fan, you'll love it for sure! Let the action begin!",1355184000,24,1841,4.502994011976048
