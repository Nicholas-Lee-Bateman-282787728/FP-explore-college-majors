Of course the cities were really bad years ago, but most people did not want to move out into the country. Therefore the burbs were created and had to be explained to people. You get to see women fascinated by the idea of dishwashers and coffee makers. I laughed at a lot of the sillier moments and had a great time watching all of the movies in the package.",1148428800,,504,4.260416666666667
8175026,5,B0008GRFRW,"""I was moved by the pathetic living conditions in Philadelphia, which are depicted so well in the film 'A place To Live'. Made me glad I wasn't born there at the time. The script for this film - and the others too - is written by people with a lot of insight. I enjoyed watching the delight on people's faces when they listen to the radio in one of the clips.""",1146182400,,360,4.084507042253521

It was amazing to see how well organized the city of New York has always been. Trains, buses, taxis, ferries, the film does not leave anything out does it? It is not surprising that millions of people call New York home. I love my city and this little clip explains why I am proud to be a New Yorker.""",1145923200,,423,4.3
