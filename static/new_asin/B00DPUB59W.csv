5846557,5,B00DPUB59W,"Neil Jordan has always been on of my favorite directors.  This is my new favorite genre film. And I had no idea it even existed until I found it on pay per view.  The story is well written and acted . The casting is perfect. With so many bad vampire movies being made to cash in on the truly awful Twilight craze, this movie stands apart.  I'd give more stars if I could.",1374883200,3,371,4.054794520547945
5846558,3,B00DPUB59W,"Directed by Neil Jordan, ""Byzantium"" tries to make a serious movie from the genre of the horror, vampire film. The movie has themes of loneliness, guilt, attempts to connect with others, together with strong feminist overtones. The movie tells the story of a mother-daughter pair of  a type of vampire called a sucreant. They are able to walk during the day and use their fingernails more than fangs as a weapon of choice to draw blood. Eleanor Webb, forever 16, beautifully acted by Saorise Roman and her mother Clara Webb are  the sucreants. They are each over 200 years old and are forced to flee from one British town to another as death follows in their wake.

Clara is forever a prostitute and latches on to a lonely client who owns a building called the Byzantium where she sets up her trade in both flesh and blood. The name of the hotel refers back to W.B. Yeats' famous imaginative poem ""Sailing to Byzantium"". (""This is no country for old men"") Her daughter, shy and guilt-ridden, meets a young man and ultimately grows to trust him and reveal her secret life. Humans cannot know the secret of a sucreant and live.

There are flash-backs to the earlier lives of the women, which led to their becoming sucreants. Clara is involved with a group of male sucreants who try to push off and subordinate the women of the species. Clara tries to restrict her feedings to the rich and mean spirited of humanity while Eleanor feels guilty about her life and searches for love.

I found the movie a near miss. It includes some good acting, particularly from Saorise Roman, good period portrayals of brothels, and some stunning visual effects. But I thought that on the whole the movie was slow, disjointed, and too full of clich&eacute;s to be convincing.

5846559,5,B00DPUB59W,"In a time of many various forms of what it is to be vampire, like in 'True Blood', 'Twilight' movies, and 'Vampire Diaries'.  Byzantium is a refreshing take on vampirism.  Like the movie 'Underworld: Awaking' we have a mother/daughter team that is trying find their own identity in the world.  However, in Byzantium, we get the real deal.  What we find is a movie that is portraying a real life relationship between mother and daughter who are fighting to stay alive.  To the detriment of an all male vampire league.  The strength of the movie comes from the acting abilities of Gemma Arterton and Saoirse Ronan, as the mother and daughter lead.  In the world of the 19th century and in present time they both have to deal with a male dominated world.  But in the end they find their own strength as women.  Showing that women are just as powerful as men, intellectually speaking.  However, the ending shows that there is the potential for a sequel.  Like Christopher Nolan, if there is a sequel, I hope it builds on the first film.",1373328000,98,1032,4.584699453551913
5846560,4,B00DPUB59W,"Just watched this on pay-per-view and I will be purchasing it on Bluray. There is a strong woman/mother and woman/daughter aspect to this story. Claire will do anything to survive, without morals, but her daughter operates on only morals. This, to me, is one of the essences of being a mother..or at least as much as I can observe without being a mother...to do anything to assure the survival of your child. (Of course, others watching this may find Eleanor's manner of feeding to be morally reprehensible.) Man ...the brotherhood... does not understand this instinct, or at least we are lead to believe this during the story. Outstanding performances from all the actors, especially the two main actresses playing Claire and Eleanor. (I was not bogged down by their real lives, thank goodness. )  Overall, an interesting take on the vampire mythology, akin to Twilight in that the creation of a vampire is not the usual old tale of drinking blood; in this story, one must eat one's soul to transform. Unique, and worth a watch.",1372723200,6,1029,4.846590909090909

5846562,5,B00DPUB59W,"Slow burn but rewarding story driven film in relation to the characters. THe ending or story wrap up feels slightly forced in comparision with overall story telling but it doesn't detract from what came before, along with providing resolution.

'Clara' (Gemma Arterton) is part happy go lucky, straight-forward & sweet street flusey & mother, part ruthless predatory killer vampire, with Arterton the burning centre to the film's elements. 'Eleanor"" (Saoirse Ronan) is the withdrawn, haunted and alienated vampire daughter, who is about to go through her rebellious teens after 200 years.

Mild Spoilers follow:

I like to think of the Vampire never directly seen, the ultimate source of this tale, as one of Anne Rice's ancient vampires. It's vampires are not especially powerful & they are able to be in daylight so they are not the typical full blooded kind, more like half-breeds, as is there transformation untypical. The film presents the intricate tale of Clara, Eleanor, Darvel and Ruthven/Frank tied up to this, over a couple of centuries in a gradual unfoldment type of way. This slow burning mystery also includes flashbacks, slightly non-linearly, and flashback within flashback.

In a Neil Jordan type of way, part of it's story is the stylistic atmosphere of the film and it is also peppered with well done visual cues. A fun stripper bar scene and then chase intro with Arterton's Clara starts things off. It is good to watch with sub-titles option also.

5846571,4,B00DPUB59W,"It's difficult to imagine that the vampire film could have anything new to say in these fang-xhausted post-Twilight days.

Especially from a director who already has waded in those crimson waters. Neil Jordan pulls off the improbable in Byzantium, his first vampire flick since his controversial 1994 adaptation of Anne Rice's Interview With the Vampire struck box office gold.

Lyrical, full of visually enthralling fantasy sequences punctuated by moments of intense, bloody violence, Byzantium is a literary, allusive piece from playwright Moira Buffini, whose film credits include the romantic dramedy Tamara Drewe and 2011's ferocious Jane Eyre adaptation starring Mia Wasikowska.

A strange blend of poetic cinema, Dickensian romance, and urban horror, the film is a melancholy meditation on the power of storytelling - of the human compulsion to weave tales and of the vital role stories play in giving our lives shape and meaning.

Jordan's films often live or die depending on his casting. It's impeccable here.

Saoirse Ronan (Hanna, The Host) stars as the film's heroine and narrator, Eleanor ""Ella"" Wells, an alienated teen living a near-destitute, peripatetic life with her mom, Clara (Tamara Drewe's Gemma Arterton), a stripper and prostitute who became pregnant by a customer when she was barely 13.

5846572,3,B00DPUB59W,"This film is very well written and beautifully paced. But after  convincing us that we are watching a wonderfully realistic gothic film, all of a sudden the director cranks up the CGI effects and makse an entire river and waterfall turn ""food-coloring red"" to simulate torrents of blood cascading down a mountainside! The effect is beyond ridiculous! [I had the same reaction in Kubrick's THE SHINING and Ford Coppola's DRACULA when suddenly a hotel hallway (in the first) and a bedroom (in the second) are suddenly and inexplicably ""flooded with blood."" Now that film directors have such wonderful toys in their hands, it must be very tempting for them not to use them, whether they need them or not. Such effects literally rend the focus away from the story and focus it directly on the guy operating the CGI computer. Frankly, I don't want to be reminded (during a dramatic scene) that I'm just watching Computer Generated Effects. For the moment, I'd like to be able to ""suspend disbelief"" and enjoy the moment.

Although I wasn't convinced in the first 15 or so minutes, the actors, production values, and most of the story turned out to be top grade. The only point of contention I see is the ending, which is sure to not please everyone (some people thrive on tragedy while others prefer not to be left in a pool of misery; some are not happy with ambiguous endings that don't neatly resolve every plot point).

Looking at the top reviews of those who found fault with Byzantium, I am not seeing reasons I can agree with:
- ""Gemma Arterton's trout pout"": seriously? A reviewer so fixated on an actor's mouth that it ruined the whole movie? Those lips are the ones she was born with, not a ""surgical deformity""; furthermore, her character can be forgiven for pouting through most of the film, as it's no small task for a vamp to smile by default in a life outside of time.
- ""It's no Let the Right One In"": no it is not, but that's okay since I found that film to be fairly predictable.
- ""there's not much blood sucking going on"": again, seriously? If I were to time blood sucking incidents between this and most of the universally accepted top vampire films, there would be no less sucking going on in Byzantium (no pun intended). And who said that blood sucking is what makes a vampire film worth watching?

Final comments. It's apparent some viewers won't find a sex worker antihero to be all that relatable, but her endearing daughter was as much the protagonist and should capture your imagination regardless of age. One of the strongest storytelling mechanisms of the vampire genre is an ability to go back in time further than a century to tell a tale of an individual's history (life + undead years), and that wasn't put to waste here.

Undead ""life is ironic"" best moment: Saoirse Ronan's character watches&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula-Prince-of-Darkness/dp/B00D80GMP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula: Prince of Darkness</a>&nbsp;in one scene.

5846579,4,B00DPUB59W,"This feels a lot like Interview with the Vampire for an important reason, this was created by the same director.  But this is NOT a story from Anne Rice.  All things considered though, this may be a more interesting movie than Interview with the Vampire was, or might even be considered along the same continuity.  Its really not that difficult to enjoy the movie with that in mind.  But these vampires are very different from the Ricean vampires.

Saoirse Ronan is really touching in this movie, you can see a great deal of potential in this actress in this movie.  And the director did well to tap into that potential.  Her character's story is quite heart breaking.  Gemma Arterton is very good, very multifaceted in this role.  Sweet, and brutal.  Tired, so very tired of the hell they are living.

This movie is entertaining, don't look for deeper meanings because while you may find it- you're meant to be entertained.  Don't lose sight of that.

This is survival/vampire story set in contemporary times on the coast of Ireland about a mother and daughter who have lived on the fringes of society for 200 years. The story is focused more on relationships than horror, though there is lots of blood and killing in this atmospheric tale. The back story is that Clara (the mother) is an outcast from a brotherhood of vampires and the daughter, Eleanor (Saoirse Ronan from the ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""Hanna""), is changed into a vampire by her mother in order to save her life after she becomes infected by a degenerative decease. Turning her daughter into a vampire is against the rules of the brotherhood who are tracking them both down. Outcast and on the run these two are always just living day to day in order to survive. This is a poignant story with a lot of heart that doesn't shy away from the darker side of what it would be like to live life on the edges of society.",1452988800,,1008,4.543956043956044

The historical flashbacks are wonderful, and the modern story riveting. Should become with ""Only Lovers Left Alive,"" a classic of the genre. Neil Jordan makes a wonderful second addition to the genre. I love that the author of the story was influenced by the earliest vampire stories; John Polidori's ""The Vampire"" and Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's ""Carmilla"" both classics of the genre. This makes for an unusual addition to the vampire genre. I even bought this film in spite of the fact that I can watch it for free on Netflix; which was where I found it initially. That is saying something, as I'm on a very limited budget. If you enjoy classic, atmospheric, romantic Vampire stories, you won't be disappointed.

The theme and story line seems to be very similar to ""Let the Right One In,"" but it's not nearly as good; I had to work really hard to keep being interested as I was watching it, and to make it to the end.

The young vampire in this case is not nearly as well developed a character as in the other film, and often does and says things that don't really make sense or seem to add to the story. The older one, similarly, seems to act strangely and a bit crazily for no apparent reason for her character development or that of the story. I did like some of the history that is interspersed that tells their background stories, but much of it is missing huge chunks of context for it to make sense, and some things like how they were turned, for example, is never clearly explained.

5846591,5,B00DPUB59W,"""Byzantium"" is a haunting vampire film that explores the complex lives of a mother-daughter duo through the centuries. The film is a 2012 Irish production directed by Neil Jordan and stars Gemma Arterton and Saoirse Ronan. I admit it was Ronan who drew me to this film as I have long admired her acting capabilities.

Ronan plays Eleanor Webb, a lonely girl with dark secrets. Having no one to confide in, she writes her life story on scraps of paper - pieces of which are found by an old man who pieces them together and discovers her secret. Their brief friendship comes to an end with the old man's release into death and thereafter, Eleanor and her mother Clara are forced to flee when it becomes apparent that their lives are in danger.

As the story unfolds, viewers learn both mother and daughter are vampires who are being hunted by the Brethren, a group of powerful men who are also vampires and who are bent on destroying Eleanor and Clara for breaking a vampiric covenant long ago. The story is unique among vampire films, although the lonely vampire theme had me thinking of another favorite, 2008's Swedish vampire film LET THE RIGHT ONE IN. The stellar acting by both Ronan and Atherton is supported by an ensemble cast comprising Johnny Lee Miller and more.

Part of the allure of this film for me was the complex backstory of both mother and daughter that takes viewers back into the past through the centuries. The period details are well-done and the main setting of an Irish coastal town enhances the sadness and pain that Eleanor experiences because of the secret she is compelled to keep. Clara on the other hand, goes through her existence determined to keep her daughter safe, even if it means resorting to her centuries' old profession of being a prostitute. As demeaning as it is, Clara is a strong woman who will do anything to ensure their continued survival. The story of how both women became vampires is also well-told and makes for a unique vampire origin story.

Final verdict - a haunting and atmospheric vampire tale that has its bloody moments, but unfolds in a leisurely manner that allows the viewer to fully understand the characters and their motivations. Beautifully-filmed and compelling, this is highly recommended for fans of the genre.",1442016000,,2279,4.776649746192893

5846615,5,B00DPUB59W,"As a huge Gemma Arterton fan, this was a MUST-BUY for me!  Not only is the film a really great take on vampire lore, but Gemma's beauty just radiates and shines in this dark film.  The first Blu-ray I received came crushed and would not play in any Blu-ray player I tried it so I contacted Amazon and within a few days I had a complete replacement that worked flawlessly.  You have to love that about Amazon!  Anyway, here's my review as originally posted on whysoblu dot com:

I went into my viewing of Byzantium wanting to like it so much because of my love for the can do no wrong actress, in my opinion, Gemma Arterton.  So the truth be told that whenever you do something like that you're almost guaranteed to set yourself up for failure and utter disappointment (point in case Man of Steel this summer).  And when that doesnt happen, then by God thats when you know you just experienced a damn miracle.  No, Byzantium is not the second coming of Christ, but who in their right mind would compare such a revolutionary event like that to a films quality (unless were talking Fight Club)?  However, if you go into Byzantium with a bloody thirsty seeking of re-experiencing another satisfying tale akin to that of Interview With The Vampire with societal emphasis on themes of brotherhood, okay motherhood, and what its really like mentally and socially to live for over two centuries, then I cant imagine you could ever walk away from this one disappointed.  Thats my story and Im staking to it.

Obviously I made reference to 1984s Interview With The Vampire above not because Byzantium is a tale similar to that, although it is, but its brought to you by the same visionary director that perfected the vampire formula in cinema, Mr. Neil Jordan.  For those keeping score, Byzantium is actually Mr. Jordans third flirtation with that of the undead in cinema.  Its based on a screenplay beautifully written by Moira Buffini and stars the ever radiant Gemma Arterton, Saoirse Ronan, Sam Riley, Caleb Landry Jones, Daniel Mays and Jonny Lee Miller.  The film saw only a small limited release this year in theaters, but rest easy my weary traveler, the tale is coming to retail shelves near you this October courtesy of IFC Films.

For those who were unlucky enough to have Byzantium play anywhere near their hometown or municipality this summer and/or are impatient enough to want to wait until October, you're in luck!  You can experience the blood filled coming of age drama like I did via rental from your favorite digital retailer or your cables On Demand channel.  It just so happened that the film kept me company on a recent flight from Austin to San Francisco this past weekend.  And needless to say, I won't be canceling my Amazon pre-order for this bad boyor should I say girl?  I look forward to the day when I can revisit Byzantium on the Blu-ray format.  So nowwhats it all about?  Im glad you asked.  Would you like to come in (I know its a bad vampire joke)?

So before I go into whether or not I liked Byzantium or notby the way I loved it!  I thought I would preface my review by saying how much I love a good vampire tale of the blood sucking undead.  Now don't get me wrong, I can play on both sides of the field.  While I enjoy the nonsensical wars between the Lycans and the vampires in the Underwolrd films, as well as Kate Beckinsales body clinging black leather outfits, Im also a sucker for the films that tread delicately on the subject matter and intricately explore what it truly must be like to be undead and believe it or not the hardships of it all, like in Let The Right One In.  Byzantium is definitely the latter with the bonus of Gemma thrown in.  In essence, she only makes this film that much sweeter for me.  I could get diabetes just watching it (I knowbad tasting jokeliterally).

The story of Byzantium, as I kind of alluded to before, is that of a mother and daughter vampire duo.  We saw the whole surrogate vampire parent relationships explored before in films like Underworld and Interview With The Vampire, but what of that of mother and daughter?  Im sure there are some, but none this weary mind of mine can recently recollect.  So what it must be like to raise a teenage vampire daughter over two centuries is really the essence of the story here.  What happens when you are made?  I mean even if you are a good vampire, you can only be friends or neighbors with someone for so many years before they start to notice hey bubba, why aren't you growing old, right?  Bingo!  Imagine how hard it must be living life like this as a teenager.  You want to tell someone your secrets to someone so bad, but you cant.  Now all you moms out there who thought you had it roughtry being a single vampire mom raising a rebellious, teenage vampire daughter.  So not only do you need to constantly reinvent yourself and find new jobs to provide for her, but you got to deal with her raging teenage hormones for two centuries too.  I don't know about you, but in that scenario being immortal sure sounds like a curse, eh?

Our story begins with young Eleanor (Ronan) desperately wanting to tell her story through her penmanshipher writings.  The only problem is that she cannot distribute the many manuscripts she creates for people would never understand and just like the government hides UFOs from us, society would freak out if they knew the real truth.  However, through Eleanor we the audience learn quite a lot.  She spills all the beans.  For lack of a better term, she is essentially our narrator on this trip throughout a two hundred year journey as we learn all about her and the ultra compassionate ways in which she kills her foodfor the blood.  Without any spoilers, its actually quite sincere and endearing in my opinion.  And Ill leave it at that.

So where were we?  Oh!  The story!  Its such an delicate story told through elegant flashbacks that I don't want to ruin any of the mystique surrounding it so like Walter White in Breaking Bad said to Hank, If you don't know who I am, I suggest you tread lightly.  And thats what I am doing here.  Lets just say all your questions of how they became vampires, why they became vampires and every essential piece of backstory you would ever want to know WILL be answered by the movies end.  I can at least guarantee you that.  However, I think I can safely spill the beans that Claras main profession is that of a woman of the night.  And I don't mean that because shes a female vampire, LOL, I mean that because shes a P-R-O-S-T-I-T-U-T-E.  There I said it!  My favorite actress is a prostitute in this, and she makes a damn good one too.  And rest assured that how she became a prostitute is revealed in the convoluted backstory (more on that subject soon) also.

So we find our two essential characters on the run and eventually forming a fresh new start as they seek sanctuary in a coastal resort area complete with its own carnival.  How can you not stay here, huh?  Clowns make the world go around.  Im being facetioussort of.  Anyway, fate intervenes while Clara is providing her services like only she can to a new client, Noel (Mays), and he spills the beans (I know I used this phrase twice in the same review and for that I am forever sorry) on why he is so lonely and talks about the Byzantium Hotel he has just inherited.  Picture a light bulb going off in Claras head.  She formulates a plan.  Oh poor, poor Noel.  Ten minutes laterbingo!  No, Noel did not climax, but instead the vampire family, keeping their secret under wraps, is making themselves comfy in the abandoned hotel.  And its not before long that Clara has transformed the Byzantium into a brothel so to speak.  Meanwhile, Eleanor is still that same depressed teenage vampire girl we first met in Act 1.  Things don't get better for her as she disapproves of the way her mom, Clara, makes money.  What a brat!  Gemma is doing her best!  I mean Clara.  Its during this pouty time that Eleanor reluctantly falls for Frank (Jones), a waiter whos quite taken by her.  And this Frank definitely has his way with Eleanor as he gets her to do things she has been resistant to do beforeshare her stories.  Im stopping right there.  I already said too much I fear.  Youll just have to see for yourself where this intertwining two hundred year-old tale goes.

So I mentioned the word convoluted above and I guess if thats my only complaint here, then wellthats not bad at all.  Its 118-minute runtime can be a bit draining at times (not like how a vampire sucks out all its victims blood).  Its not the quickest pacing youve ever seen and its not balls-to-the-wall action like Underworld either.  Its much more inline with Jordans earlier work on Interview With The Vampire and the Swedish masterpiece, Let The Right One In.  I mention the pacing only because of all the flashbacks.  However, without themyou would never have all your questions answered.  So you will have to pick your own battles here.  Would you rather watch a straight forward moving narrative or do you mind jumping around in the two hundred year proverbial sandbox?  I prefer my movies to satisfy all my curiosities, don't you?  If so, then you're in the right place.  While Byzantium isn't the perfect movie, I sure hope it remains on my Top 10 list throughout the year.  Right now its hovering near the middle, but we still have four more months to go as we battle it out for picture of the year in the upcoming Oscar laden months.  Brace yourselves.  Anything is possible.  And lets be honest, when you are talking about a film that hasn't seen much light of day (not another vampire joke) theatrically, being in someones Top 10 of the year is quite an accomplishment in my books.  Byzantine is a slow burning journey that I want to take againmaybe even check into the hotel for an extended stay if possibleand re-live all the revealing and blood gushing moments on the Blu-ray format.  Until thendigital retailers and On Demand channels are your friend.  Enjoy!",1422144000,2,10003,4.545912653975364

5846621,5,B00DPUB59W,"Just when you think that there are no more depths to be explored in vampire fiction, this little gem of a movie from director Neil Jordan comes along. Byzantium stars Saoirse Ronan and Gemma Arterton as two young women, sisters it seems, who travel from place to place living rough as they try to keep the secret of their lives hidden while avoiding mysterious, and fatal, pursuers.  Their secret?  They feed off human blood to sustain their lives.

Eleanor (Ronan) is the younger of the two, a sensitive teenager who writes her story over and over again and then shreds it and disperses to the winds.  She writes what she cannot tell. Clara is a twenty-something beauty who takes care of Eleanor including making the hard decisions about what actions they need to take to preserve their lives and safety. Clara works in the sex trade, with an energy and allure that is hard for any man to resist.

I don't want to give the plot away, and advise potential viewers not to watch the trailer as it shows too much of the dark, lush visuals that make the movie so appealing.  This is not primarily an action film although it does have some set pieces that are thrilling. It belongs to the type of story that explores themes of loneliness, love and connection through the lens of vampirism.

The musical score is excellent and includes Beethoven's Sonata in C major Opus 2 no 3 as well as a haunting version of The Coventry Carol that is heard throughout the film in flashback sequences that take place 200 years before the time of the story.

I have watched the movie from start to finish several times, and if I stumble across it while channel surfing, I always have to stop and watch. Highly recommended for aficionados of classic vampire fiction.",1417996800,,1744,4.603225806451613

5846625,4,B00DPUB59W,"Neil Jordan made ""Interview with the Vampire"" movie and now he made a new film about vampires called ""Byzantium"".  Main heroines are mother and daughter pair who act as sisters.  One is a prostitute and seeks constant amuzement and entertainment.  The other one, Eleanor is turned inward, she is very artistic - plays piano and writes insightful literary stories and above all, she seeks solitude.

This is new kind of vampires.  They are not limited to roaming the cities at night.  They can be outdoors in the sun and decapitation can kill them just as well.  As story progresses we learn that these two female vampires are outcasts.  One must watch the entire movie to understand why is that because all characters are closely intertwined to each other with their stories, fates and distant past.  Every move that one character makes affects the other and in most cases, there is no turning back, because all is the matter of survival.

It is interesting how even their basic need for survival - food - is procured.  Most vampires are without mercy and kill their victims indistriminantly.  Eleanor is not like that.  Her victims are old and sick.  All of her victims are ready to accept death and embrace it.  Eleanor's last visit to them is relief for both - for Eleanor it is ease from guilt and sadness about killing her victims.  For her victims - there is a release from this world that for most has become a burden full of loneliness, pain (both physical and emotional) and ther is a sense of eager embracing of the end of life that ends their seemingly endless suffering.  Eleanor's mother Claire sees herself as protector of weak.  Forced into prostitution against her own will and not knowing any other way to survive, she takes pleasure in punishing men who have no scruples, who are arrogant and brutes.

Once these two women become hunted, by their own kind - they fight for their survival with all their might.  With all burdens of immortality and endless need to feed on human blood, survival for both women is something they are not willing to give up.

This is also a story of coming of age.  After traveling together for 200 years, mother and daughter come at the point when daughter must leave and start living her own life.  Everything Eleanor has learned about protecting herself comes from her mother and the only thing left for her is to find her own companion.  Someone sensitive and kind and also deserving of her.  Her mother on the other side, does not need much guidance on who her companion will be.  Besides she knows how to make her life exciting at all times.  Woman like Claire will never be bored.

I liked this new twist on how new brand of vampires might be.  Their existance is amazing, if for no other reason but for the fact that even they are seeking a higher purpose and legacy in their immortal life, they wish to leave behind.",1415836800,,2872,4.609467455621302
5846626,4,B00DPUB59W,"I liked this film quite a lot, but it was not at all what I expected. This is definitely not your typical vampire tale. I'd categorize it as more of a drama than horror film. The story is about a mother and daughter who are vampires. They did not become vampires through traditional means, but rather a process involving a secret map and a shrine hidden within a remote cave. Most vampires are men who are carefully selected to become vampires by members of the ""Brotherhood."" I do not want to give too much away because it is very interesting to watch history unfold. All of this connects back to Clara, the mother's past.

Eleanor, Clara's daughter, narrates the story. In contrast to her violent and reckless mother, Eleanor is kind and graceful with a quiet demeanor. Clara gave birth to Eleanor when she was a teen before she became a vampire. As you find out about the people and events who molded Clara into who she is, you'll likely feel sympathy and even some respect for this incredibly flawed character. Despite all these flaws, you'll find that Clara truly does love her daughter and will do whatever she can to protect her.

There is an adequate amount of blood, action and violence, but this movie is definitely not what I'd consider as scary or even spooky for that matter. I actually found myself crying at certain points during the movie. At first I was disappointed that it is not really what one might consider a horror film. However, as the story unfolded, I found myself thoroughly enjoy this film. The English and Irish scenery is quite lovely, and the storyline is very creative and intriguing. Like I said before, it is different from most other vampire movies. It's really just a sad, beautiful story about the bond between a mother and her daughter.",1415318400,,1775,4.649681528662421

He can certainly do vampires, because Interview was fantastic, even with the two dumbest and most boring actors in Hollywood as its stars. Here he has a much better cast but a really lame story, and no interesting male characters at all.

Then there's Gemma Arterton's trout pout, which is very distracting. I can't imagine why such a pretty girl thinks she needs deformed lips. Her performance as the movie's only complex character would be great if those lips didn't steal every scene they're in. Saoirse Ronan is very good, completely convincing as a naive 206-year-old bloodsucker, and without any obvious surgical deformity to distract the viewer.

I'm not sorry I saw Byzantium, and I may even see the obviously set-up sequel when it comes out. I just hope lovely Ms Arterton has reconsidered the lip enhancement before the camera rolls.",1412035200,4,1262,5.494845360824742

Interview With the Vampire is Jordan's masterpiece in my opinion as he captured the tone of the novel perfectly. Byzantium is another vampire film but it's very unique from anything I've seen in recent years. Plot aside, acting aside, this film just LOOKS beautiful. The cinematography and scenery is stunning, the tone eerie, yet lush and dramatic.  It follows a mother/daughter, masquerading as sister/sister, for obvious reasons as they attempt to run away from their past, which is easier said than done. They are polar opposites and that's why this film works so well. They contrast each other beautifully, each hiding a dark secret that they've sworn never to reveal. The consequences would be fatal.

The movie skips periodically between the present and two hundred years earlier, without ever losing the flow or narrative. This is where the originality comes to play as we see a very different type of immortal existence, as well as creation. It's vivid and entertaining from beginning to end, fantastically acted and features a haunting, beautiful musical score.

I would give this 5 stars if not for the few plot holes and lack of information regarding certain important aspects of the film.

5846649,5,B00DPUB59W,"""There comes a time in life when secrets should be told.""

-- dialogue from Byzantium

Nothing would give Eleanor Webb (Saoirse Ronan) greater pleasure than to reveal the dark secret she's been harboring all her life. She is seen repeatedly writing it down on pieces of paper, and then crumbling up the pages and releasing them to the wind. ""Maybe the birds will read it,"" she tells us. Her secret has forced her to lie to others, about who she is, as well as the nature of her relationship with her mother Clara (Gemma Arterton). Now she's ready to tell the truth, if only to make a genuine connection with another human soul.

Eleanor's secret is that she's a 16 year old girl, and has been for the past 200 years. She and her mother are vampires, and they have been going through time running from a brotherhood of vampires after Clara broke a sacred rule by turning her daughter into one (apparently, women are not allowed to turn people). Clara has kept the existence of the brotherhood a secret from her daughter, and has supported her by working the streets as a freelance prostitute. In an earlier scene, Clara decapitates one of the brotherhood with a cheese wire, and she and Eleanor are forced to relocate to a seaside English town and start over.

It is there that Eleanor meets Frank (Caleb Landry Jones), a leukemia-stricken young waiter who immediately takes a liking to her after he hears her play the piano at the restaurant where he works. In time, Eleanor comes to trust Frank enough that she decides to write to him a story detailing her life and her terrible secret. The problem is that Clara is very adamant about making sure than any human who knows the truth about them won't live to tell about it.

Byzantium is an extraordinary movie, a quiet, melancholic, and poignant fantasy thriller from director Neil Jordan, who also made the Academy Award nominated Interview With a Vampire back in 1994. While the movie is as gory as you'd expect a film about blood suckers to be, Byzantium is not a horror movie by any means. It is, at heart, a deeply moving and heartbreaking tale about the sacrifices parents make for their children, and about outsiders longing for human companionship.

Clara finds a companion of her own in the lonely but kind-hearted Noel (Daniel Mays), whose mother recently passed away, and who has inherited the Byzantium Hotel, which was once a thriving business that has since become rundown. Since Clara was only a few years older than Eleanor when she turned her, she tells Noel that Eleanor is her little sister. Noel offers them refuge at the Byzantium, and Clara sees this as an opportunity to turn the place into a make-shift brothel, but one that's more sympathetic to the working girls, especially since she's been one her whole life.

The movie frequently cuts to flashbacks explaining the women's tragic backstory. Clara was sold as a prostitute at an early age by the despicable Captain Ruthven (Johnny Lee Miller), and was forced to give up her daughter when she was born because children weren't allowed in the brothel where she was employed. She contracts a disease that rots her lungs and causes her to cough up blood. When Ruthven's old buddy Darvell (Sam Riley) gives him a map to a rocky island that changes people into immortal vampires (the details how are best left unsaid), she steals the map from Ruthven and gains eternal life for herself. Not wanting to live as an immortal alone, she springs her daughter from the orphanage and makes her one as well.

One of the complaints I've heard against the movie is that Clara goes through life as a prostitute, a job she can't stand, when she could easily have been able to find other means of making money. I disagree. From a very early age, this is the only life she's ever known. She may not like the job, but it was enough to support her daughter during her stay at the orphanage, and it's enough to support them now. Besides, Clara's big thing is keeping her identity a secret from the rest of the world, and prostitution is a job that doesn't require deep human connections. A man pays a woman for her services, and nothing more than that.

One of the most intriguing elements of the film is the way it shows how both mother and daughter approach vampirism in different ways. Clara targets men who are scum and abusive to other women, or people who discover the truth about her and her daughter. Eleanor, on the other hand, is more of a mercy killer, targeting people who are already at death's door, and that's only after they give her their consent. ""Peace be with you,"" she tells them before making the kill. ""May light shine upon you."" Even still, every life she ends takes a toll on her. It's easy enough for Clara to kill; she's all about forgetting the past. Eleanor seems to be constantly haunted by it.

Neil Jordan paces the movie very deliberately, which is how it should be. A faster pace would have pushed us away from the material and diminished a lot of its impact. Cinematographer Sean Bobbitt contributes to the film's atmosphere with his lushly Gothic images, with some of the most breathtaking shots involving waterfalls of blood. The mother daughter relationship between Clara and Eleanor is beautifully developed (I smiled at the scene where Clara sang to her daughter while they hitched a ride from a trucker), but the heart of the movie is easily the relationship between Eleanor and Frank. Their story is one of lost souls who finally find each other, and when they kiss, it isn't explicit and erotic, but rather tender and sweet (which is the way a first kiss should be).

The acting is terrific across the board, but the movie belongs to both Arterton and Ronan, and they both turn in spell-binding performances. Just watch Arterton's face when she's on the phone with her daughter and realizes how much her relationship with Eleanor has crumbled. Just watch Ronan try to fight off temptation when she sees a rag soaked with Frank's blood on the ground. Both of these performances are award-worthy, and both of them keep the viewer entranced throughout the entire movie. The screenplay is written by Moira Buffini, which she adapted from a play she wrote called A Vampire Story, a title that describes this movie the best. Byzantium is now out on DVD, and is one of the very best movies of 2013.

Where Twilight is vapid, melodramatic, and angst ridden, Byzantium is literate, contemplative, and dignified. Both stories focus on a female teenager in the midst of an existential crisis, yet Twilight handles this with all the grace of a gossip tabloid. Byzantium's approach pays dramatic dividends because we actually grow to care about Saoirse Ronan's Eleanor in ways that codify this film as an allegorical tale of life.

This slow-burning story regrettably won't satisfy every palette, but if you're even slightly curious about a vampire tale with an emphatically human core, Byzantium will reward you in ways Twilight degrades you.",1398902400,,745,5.260504201680672

5846656,4,B00DPUB59W,"An intelligent, superbly acted vampire story, serenely-scored and with a more realistic, fresh perspective.

This finely shot film opens with an elegantly underspoken narration by Eleanor (Saoirse Ronan), a young woman who reveals that her fate is bound to Clara (Gemma Arterton).  As we are cautiously introduced to these strong characters our eyes traverse one scene to the next, and with each we swiftly approach an understanding of their desperate lifestyle spent drifting and suppressing secrets.

The acting is superb.  Like Anne Rice's Lestat, Clara portrays the ruthless, manipulative, survivalist parent whereas Eleanor (much as the resistant Louis) resents her mother's actions.  Director Neil Jordan (The Borgias, In Dreams, The Crying Game, Interview with a Vampire , The Company of Wolves) has an impressive rsum including period piece drama, sexual thriller, classical vampirism and gory non-mainstream fairy tale horror, so we I read he was directing this film let's just say ""you have my attention.""  This film moves at a generally slow pace, punctuated with occasionally eventful blood flow.  It is far from exciting; more ""interesting"" really.  For even the slow seasons curry my curiosity of what fate will befall Eleanor, Clara, their relationship, their lives.

Through a series of flashbacks we discover a more mysterious vampire origin; one that neither matches folklore nor is completely explained .  These vampires walk in daylight and have no fangs, but live forever, crave blood and require invitation.  The vampirism is not exactly presented subtly, but the focus is placed on Clara and Eleanor's struggle to survive and the growing strain on their relationship.  To protect this secret Clara would do anything.  But it seems Eleanor yearns to share her secret.  When she meets a brooding love interest (Caleb Landry Jones; The Last Exorcism, Antiviral) her willingness to suppress her secret wanes.

The score is serene, able to lull a beast to calm before putting it down.  It complements the thought-provoking, moody atmosphere so well as we estimate the dubious future of these vampires.  The gore is abundant in brevity, but not distasteful, and occasional scenes are brutal, but appropriate.  One shot of bloodletting was actually quite beautiful.

I was never swept away by an Anne Rice-esque violent vampiric passion.  But I remained engrossed in this story, beautifully told by characters with depth.",1397433600,3,2437,5.363157894736842

5846661,5,B00DPUB59W,"Unlike other vampire stories we've seen a million times before, Byzantium is so good because it one, feels very real, two, humanizes vampires almost to the opposite extreme of other mediums like ""True Blood"" and ""The Vampire Diaries"" (where vampires are basically gods) and has vampires that can walk in daylight, three, has a mother/daughter dysfunctional family love story and four, has well done acting and directing. While I'm not a big fan of Gemma Arterton (St. Trinians, Clash of the Titans, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, Runner Runner), she does an amazing job here. Perhaps its because Clara is so dysfunctional, yet well meaning, she feels real. Also, the fact that Arterton is still fairly young, which makes it seem like she had her child as a teenager and acts as such.

Almost no one in the movie, except for maybe Eleanor, is either Good or Evil. Everyone has realistic shades of gray, though Eleanor is probably pure of heart. Clara is overall a decent person and nice to get along with, but she's a survivalist above all else, even resorting to being a stripper and prostitute to earn cash and pay the bills. She's good to good people and drains blood off the abusive or criminal in society. Or anyone who threatens her or her daughter. Clara and her daughter are on the run from the global vampire league known as The Brotherhood. They're almost entirely male and a relatively small group that shares the secret of vampirism and makes sure it stays secret. But Clara is a rebel and a loose cannon and likes to do her own thing, and so, has been on the run from them for over a century, as she fights to earn a living and keep her and her daughter Eleanor safe. She lies, cheats, steals, robs, and on rare occasions will even kill (when starving for blood or thinks someone will bring attention to them, luring The Brotherhood to threaten their lives). She's very flawed, but far from evil.

Eleanor, on the other hand, is extremely lonely, possibly depressed, and has OCD. She never uses any of her vampire gifts to her benefit and often seems to desire being human. She wants companionship and even love, but all she has is her wild prostitute and stripper mom who controls her and has been controlling her for over a century. She wants to grow up and be her own woman, but the two are always on the run and have to stay in the shadows and depend on each other to survive. Over time, Eleanor has become a gifted pianist and writer. She writes journal entries but can never keep them, as Clara fears for their safety if they ever got out. But while attending school in their new temporary hometown, Eleanor hand-writes an autobiography for a terminally ill teenage boy she's fallen for, but it also falls in the hands of the teachers and faculty at the school, and they're impressed enough by it to where they want to publish it. This draws the attention of The Brotherhood to track down Eleanor and Clara and Clara goes into survival mode again, but mostly blames Eleanor's crush for the predicament her in-depth biography has gotten them in to.

As mentioned before, the story feels real, because of the great directing, as well as Gemma Arterton and Saorise Ronan's acting and chemistry. They feel like a real introverted and shy 16 year old daughter and her reckless extroverted 32 year old stripper mother. In many ways, they are opposites. The movie has a very classical, old-school vampire feel to it. They feel like Shakespeare-ian era characters, not like these lame, two-dimensional, sexed-up teen vampires of today that pretend to go to high school and only want sex and a boyfriend/girlfriend to have it with. Despite its teen protagonist, it is very much a mature movie, yet also works so that any mature-enough teenage girl will also appreciate and love it. Its the Anti-Twilight. Also, unlike most vampire movies, the two here are pretty close to human. Clara is powerful enough to hold her own against the average man and take him down without much trouble, but also likely would not survive a group of trained policemen. The vampires here are slightly stronger and faster than normal humans, but not by very much. They don't have ""superpowers"" unlike the 'True Blood' vamps. Aside from needing blood about once a week and never aging, they blend in perfectly as human beings. Which is what makes Clara's desperation and willingness to work in the sex trade all the more believable.

One thing that seems odd though is that any immortal over a long enough period of time can become wealthy, even two fugitive vampires, so how Clara and Eleanor could be poor for so long seems a bit unrealistic. Even without any kind of business or monetary skills, anyone surviving that long would have enough antique possessions or experience in society to have earned a decent amount of wealth by the early 21st century, even if they did have to keep moving every few months or so. How can someone not have learned how to earn a decent living aside from sleeping with men and dancing after over 200 years of living? But its a moot point. It somewhat can be ignored or you can make your own conclusions as to why they've been struggling and poor for so long.

The story can be slow at times and the origins of Clara, then Eleanor, are teased throughout the movie and take a while to find out. They only give you small flashbacks at a time (a little similar to ""LOST""), but the flashbacks and origins themselves aren't all that interesting, especially for taking place in the 19th century. At least the origin for creating vampires is different, here. Eleanor is the driving force of the movie and the protagonist, while Clara and her dysfunctionality and crass language is what keeps the movie interesting enough through Eleanor's brooding, depression, and loneliness. But basically, Eleanor just wants love, companionship, and freedom, while Clara just wants to survive, make money, relax on an island somewhere, and possibly be accepted into society. But both have kind of given up on their dreams, with The Brotherhood always on their tail. Innocents do get killed in this movie, which is always a shame to see, but the movie does leave you with hope by the end, so its not all doom and gloom.

Overall, ""Byzantium"" is VERY MUCH recommended! Its even better than the other recent female vampire movie ""We Own The Night."" Worth seeing, but I'm not sure if its worth watching again after the first time. As stated, the movie does move slowly and the flashback scenes are a little boring, but its a somewhat original vampire tale. It has two strong female leads, great acting and directing, has a classical feel to it where you can appreciate the vampires for their inhumanity or other human flaws rather than their ""vampire superpowers"", and shows a realistic mother/daughter duo on the run, trying to find their humanity and place in the world in a society that (they assume) doesn't want them and will never accept them. The mature, but brooding and lonely Eleanor and the crass, yet loving and maternal Clara work well off each other and they both will help each other survive no matter what. But Eleanor can't be sixteen forever, even if she literally can, and Clara's behavior and killings will eventually catch up to her.

If you want a mature vampire movie with a classical feel, a realistic story, realistically flawed characters, and a bit of a twist, you'll definitely want to watch Byzantium! Five Stars.",1396656000,,7439,4.722093918398769

Some things were just flat out random and made absolutely no sense whatsoever to the story, and were just plain illogical.

There wasn't alot of background. It just flowed from event to event without much background on how those things came to be so in my opinion it made the movie a bit choppy.

5846681,4,B00DPUB59W,"Admittedly, I have a soft spot for vampire cinema, and with that said, I have fallen into a sort of love with Byzantium. Directed by Interview With The Vampire's Neil Jordan, Byzantium was a brilliantly atmospheric horror/drama focused principally on an immortal heroine with a mortal's passion. In unique and original fashion, we are introduced to Clara and Eleanor and gradually revealed their nature and their strengths of character. And, we spend the next two hours on a dark, emotional journey through their lives - time itself a secondary concern, even for the audience as we are given juxtapositions of the past, the present, and even an evanescent glimpse of the future. The birth of the vampire in this film was surprisingly fantastic and symbolic - surprising because it is its own lore separate from traditional stories and leaps from the root mythology of the Bram Stoker novel. I fell in love with this film and I can't wait to spread that emotion with my friends and family. Saoirse Ronan is a wonderful talent and I have never been disappointed by her in a film. She grows more beautiful, skilled, and charismatic every year. Gemma Arterton, who I absolutely adore, is a fantastic fit for vampire Clara: she is painfully attractive, supple, sinister, and her aesthetic seems to suggest a timeless beauty. I have always liked her. Enough to see 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' a second time. And that's certainly a strong statement. Byzantium won't blow you away with any groundbreaking technical feats, witty dialogue, or timeless characters but it is emotionally resonant. Here is a slice of new-age Vampire cinema that, much like 2008's Let The Right One In, will not work to change the genre but rather work to forge an amorphous brand of its own - solitary and singular, beautiful and original.",1392595200,,1814,4.931372549019608

5846683,5,B00DPUB59W,"Byzantium is a Visually stunning tale of  mother and daughter Vampires that live by very different codes and morals.(Saoirse Ronan)is Eleanor who is always writing her story down and tossing it to the wind as she cannot tell anyone because it would endanger the existence of she and her mother Clara  played by  the beautiful (Gemma Arterton) but Eleanor who is called Ella by most people desperately longs to tell someone she and her mothers story. One of the main plot lines in the film revolves around if she tells anyone and if so whom does she tell?

Clara never even thinks or considers telling anyone their story as she is the more worldly and wiser in some ways of the two. Clara is a Prostitute and takes advantage of any man that allows her  access. If by chance anyone finds out what Clara and Eleanor really are  she deals with them in a very unpleasant way,while kind hearted Ella waits until someone is ready to die before she feeds upon them and she does this by visiting hospitals and other places you would find someone very old and ready to let go.

Clara meets a man/Client who's mother just died and he has inherited a hotel named the Byzantium so she sets up a bordello there.

This has it all, first love, brutality,tenderness and it plays out into a very beautiful if not tragic story.it is definitely not your average vampire tale and many of the  Clichs do not apply in this film.

5846685,4,B00DPUB59W,"Purely by coincidence I stumbled upon 2 little know vampire movies and watched them back to back.  The first was Guillermo del Toro's first film from 1993 called ""Cronos"" (reviewed elsewhere), which I had sitting on the shelf for several months and then this little film from director Neil Jordan which hit the U. S. theaters in the summer of 2013 and was up next in my Netflix queue.  Jordan, of course, is no stranger to vampire movies having ""Interview with the Vampire"" on his resume.

Like ""Cronos,"" ""Byzantium"" is not your traditional vampire with fangs film, nor is it oversaturated in gushing blood flowing from human necks.  Having said that, there is plenty of violent death occurring but mostly as a matter of survival.  In a pair of remarkable performances, Gemma Arterton and former Oscar nom Saoirse Ronan play a mother and daughter and the only known female vampires.  How that occurred is an interesting turn of events which is primarily shown in flashback through the eyes and pen of Eleanor (Ronan).  As one of the characters remarks ""Eternal life comes only to those prepared to die.""

Mother Clara makes her un-living as a prostitute, the only trade she knew both hundreds of years ago and now.  Her victims are generally unruly Johns.  When the forever 16 year old Eleanor needs to feed, she goes to hospitals or hospices and finds elderly people who ask to die.  The pair take up with Noel (Daniel Mays), a shy owner of a rundown inn called Byzantium.  Clara uses her charms on Noel and soon the place is the newest brothel much to Eleanor's displeasure.

Eleanor meets and falls for an oddball schoolmate, Frank (Caleb Landry Jones) and he reciprocates.  Eleanor knows that any long term relationship is doomed, but Frank also has Leukemia which puts an interesting twist on the story.  Jordan and screenwriter Moira Buffini tell the vampire saga without caskets of dirt, crucifixes, garlic and aversion to mirrors.  It is one of sadness and regret.  It is also about love and survival.  Fine film.

I watched this IFC film on a Blu ray transfer that has a 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  It appears to have been shot digitally and many, if not most, of the scenes are shot in low light.  I didn't see the film in a theater so I'm not sure if the video noise was there to begin with or part of the conversion.  Most likely any dullness in the video will only be noticeable by purists.  For me, it didn't affect my enjoyment of the film.  The primary audio track is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is excellent throughout the movie.  Some nice surround activity.  Excellent presentation of the dialog.  Always clear and well balanced.  There is also an uncompressed PCM 2.0 track and subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a 76 minute piece consisting of interviews with various cast and crew members.  And a trailer.",1391904000,,2877,4.718875502008032

5846688,4,B00DPUB59W,"Clara and her daughter Eleanor constantly move from place to place, finally ending up in a sleepy coastal town. Noel meets them by chance and allows them to stay in his recently inherited, but dilapidated hotel Byzantium. Clara starts up a brothel in the hotel to get bt while Eleanor sullenly writes and mopes. Eleanor befriends Frank, a sickly local boy, and tells him her deepest, darkest secret: that she and Clara are 200 year old vampires on the run from the Brotherhood, the vampire council that has labelled them abominations. As their story circulates the town, all sorts of unwanted attention plagues the two women from both humans and vampires.

Byzantium is a fresh, feminist take on vampires and stands out in the face of an oversaturated genre. The vampire mythology is markedly different than usual. Blood is still their source of sustenance and an invitation is necessary to enter someone's home, but the sun, garlic, and crosses have no adverse effects. Without fangs, they relay on retractable and incredibly sharp nails. Their history is also quite different. Instead of random bands of loner vampires as is typical, this film features the Brotherhood, a glorified boys club of undead, that decide what is and isn't allowed and enforces those rules. The organization is rigidly unchanging, only making a small allowance to allow Clara to live when she joined their ranks. However, she was clearly labeling her as an outsider and an outcast without the same rights and privileges as the rest of the Brotherhood because of her gender. One of those rights denied her is that of creation, which is incredibly ironic. It calls to mind other real life forums of men deciding what women can and can't do involving reproduction. These men are the villains of the film and hunt Clara and Eleanor for being abominations by virtue of their gender and reproductive choices.

Clara and Eleanor are vastly different women trying to maintain their independence. Clara is fiery, sexual, and independent. Throughout history, Clara has been working as a sex worker to support herself and Eleanor. At first, she was forced into prostitution by a man who raped her. The 19th century held no support or agency for such women. Not even the law protected her and she was damned to suffer abuse her entire life and die at a young age. After giving birth to Eleanor, Clara works tirelessly to give her education and opportunities so she won't suffer the same fate. Then she contracts tuberculosis along the way. When all hope seemed to be lost, she stole from her abusers and took immortality for herself, going against the societal expectations of her time. Afterwards, she chose to be a sex worker in part to support her family, but also to help and protect other sex workers so they can work on their own terms without abuse. She takes that role she was forced into as a child and turns it into one of empowerment. When asked by the Brotherhood what she will do with her power, Clara responds ""To bring justice to those who prey on the weak and to curb the power of men."" Clara chooses to feed upon those abusers and victimizers who more metaphorically feed on the weak and vulnerable.

Eleanor is much more introspective and quiet. Every place they move, she writes their history and then throws the papers to the wind. Very similar to Louis de Pointe du Lac from Interview with the Vampire, she focuses on examining and reliving the past and is a mite overdramatic and whiny. Like Clara, she makes conscious choices about her feeding habits, opting to feed on the extremely old and close to death. Even though she's over 200 years old, she still acts like a teenager and rebels against her mother by telling humans about their story and generally getting them into a lot of trouble. She befriends a fellow surly, depressed teenager named Frank and confides completely and truthfully in him, causing the aforementioned trouble. Eleanor and Clara have been in a stagnant relationship for 200 years with no change in their dynamic despite all the time that has passed. Eleanor is tired of the lies, the prostitution, and acting like a regular human teenager she appears to be. At the end of the film, Clara realizes this and sets Eleanor free with directions to the place of creation so she can journey forward in her life, form her own relationships, and choose how she wants to live.

Byzantium is a feminist film at its core, but makes an effort to differentiate men from the evil patriarchal Brotherhood. Many men are portrayed who are decent human beings. Noel welcomes Eleanor and Clara to live in his abandoned hotel and seems like a sweet person going through grief after his mother died. Frank is an nice if odd young man who makes a real connection with Eleanor. Darvell. although a member of the Brotherhood, defects when he executes the leader instead of Clara as he was charged to. He has a mind of his own and chooses to reject the Brotherhood's policies and mindset.

Byzantium is a fantastic film that portrays feminist ideals with an interesting, nuanced story. Gemma Arterton and Saorise Ronan impressively portray Clara and Eleanor and their complex relationship. Even though obviously frustrated with each other, they still love each other and will fight to protect each other. The portrayal of men is varied instead of the one dimensional one used in most films like this, differentiating between systematic patriarchy and men. This film is well made, beautifully shot, and much different than most in the vampire genre. Highly recommended.",1391558400,,5557,4.8452631578947365

5846690,4,B00DPUB59W,"I remember hearing about an upcoming vampire movie starring Irish actor Saoirse Ronan (The Host, The Lovely Bones) maybe eighteen months to two years ago, but I don't remember it ever coming to the cinema. I found it recently and thoroughly enjoyed this very different vampire tale. Its directed by Neil Jordan, who also did Interview with the Vampire.

Byzantium is often bleak, but with the muted tone, vibrant cinematography and stunning performances by Ronan, Gemma Arterton and Caleb Landry Jones, Id recommend it to any fans of the vampire genre who are interested in watching something different.

Clara and Eleanor have spent the last two hundred years moving from place to place, running. They could be sisters, and call themselves such, but Clara is actually Eleanors mother. They are vampires, but not the sort weve come to know in recent years. They aren't superhero powerful, leading fabulous lives of wealth and frivolity, having great sex or enjoying all-consuming romances with eternal lovers. No, Clara ekes out a meagre living for them as a prostitute. Shes been selling her body for hundreds of years and doesnt know anything else. Times may have changed since she was a young human, but one of the oldest professions in the world goes on. Shes sparky and straight-talking where Eleanor is quiet and reflective. Clara kills when necessity strikes. Eleanor takes only those who are willing and ready to die.

Their arrival in a rundown seaside resort in England brings about big change. Clara finds a home and new business enterprise in a nerdy guy suffering a recent bereavement. She turns his deceased mothers closed down guesthouse into a brothel. Eleanor meanwhile wanders into a nursing home one night and starts playing the piano. A young employee  watches her play. She is polite but not eager to answer his questions. Frank is a pensive young man, quiet and older than his years. They attend the same school, both are outsiders and loners, and so its no surprise they are drawn to each  other.  Eleanor breaks her mothers rule. She writes the story of their lives for Frank, and their private world is about to be torn apart.

I found myself moved watching this story. It doesnt have the action or the beautiful brooding vampires weve come to see in recent years, a welcome change. These two women seem like ordinary, down-on-their-luck people, scrummaging through the garbage heap of life to maintain their existence. The dilapidated promenade running the length of the beach and the desolate, empty atmosphere of the town serves to underline the sombre and quiet tone of this film. The flashes of life, spirit and violence all come from Clara.

How they came to be vampires is another unusual twist on the typical blood exchange weve come to see in most books and films. The flashbacks that happen throughout the film give us just enough information to keep us waiting for the next piece of the puzzle.

For a rainy day, Id recommend Byzantium. Even if you're not a fan of the fang, but enjoy supernatural dramas, give this a try.",1390521600,,3058,4.8766859344894025

5846692,4,B00DPUB59W,"This is an interesting, and mostly absorbing dark vampire movie. It has whiffs of feminism as the vampire brotherhood considers female vampires and their children as an anathema-only worthy of extinction, So the 2 protagonist undead, (Gemma Arterton and Saorise Ronan ) who turn out to be mother and daughter, must run to survive.
And, there is a take on personal morality to go along with the movie's convoluted plot. Without giving away too much, I'd say the centerpiece is Saoirse Ronan's character who is a pretty unhappy bloodsucker. She did not choose to be a vampire, and so her rationalization for killing to feed is to be an agent of assisted suicide. She only drains and kills humans that consent, and are ready to die.
Arterton's character has a much harder edge. She will do anything to feed, survive and care for Ronan, but concentrates on those who she assesses are evil, and whom the world would be better off without. Her performance is excellent, compelling and not a little scary. The other supporting actors, Caleb Landry, Johnny Lee Miller, Daniel Mays, and others do a creditable job. This is a disquieting and very dark movie; probably not for everyone. Nasty around the edges; I found myself frequently identifying with the vampire's naive prey items.

5846702,4,B00DPUB59W,"I found this British-Irish fantasy thriller quite watchable, mostly because of the good performance by two principal actresses, but it is not really an immortal masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Clara (Gemma Arterton) and her daughter Eleanor (Saoirse Ronan) are vampires. Clara is an adult woman but Eleanor is a teenager - and she was a teenager for the last two hundred years or so. They live a rather poor existence, on the margins of the society and they travel A LOT, because, as it very quickly becomes apparent, they are on the run - in fact they have been on the run since the Napoleonic Wars... I will say no more about the story.

This is not exactly a horror film, even if a dead body drops from time to time, as Clara and Eleanor are genuine blood-drinking, human hunting vampires and not the ""vegetarian"" kind like some of those from ""Twilight"" or ""Angel"". They are however not exactly ""classical"" undead monsters, as they can walk in full sunlight without trouble and crosses, holy water and garlic do not bother them - on another hand decapitation and fire are a concern...

The director went to great lengths to present his heroines as nice girls, almost wrapping all the killings of this murderous duo in pink fluff - but well, a killer is still a killer and a creature which needs to kill people in order to feed itself is still a monster...

This is a slow and frequently sad film, not devoid of charm and quite watchable, with both actresses doing very well. Clara's fierce devotion to her daughter and Eleanor's unhappiness with her ""unlife style"" are main topics of the film and they are shown very well indeed.

This film is also quite feminist and it actually hurts it a little - but I cannot go into details without giving up too much...

Bottom line, this is an interesting and quite watchable film and watching it can a be a pleasant thing - just do not expect too big a firework...",1389312000,,1949,4.586206896551724

5846735,3,B00DPUB59W,"I agree with other reviewers that this is well-acted and has unique aspects. But the unique aspects are what made me dislike this film.

The vampires don't have fangs. They have one thumbnail that they can extend into a razor sharp talon for thrusting into the neck or wrist of a victim. Furthermore one is 'made' a vampire by visiting a cave.

I thought these plot elements stupid, especially the vampire-making bat cave.

Gemma Arterton is Clara the mother Eleanor (Saoirse Ronan). Both are vampires. There's some flashbacks into how both became vampires.

They move from place to place living fairly rough. Clara works strip clubs to earn money. It's never explained why because they don't look like they live any place decent.

Clara protects her daughter from 'the life' (of a prostitute). Eleanor is forever sixteen. But she's no innocent. She goes to old people when it is their 'time' to die. Then she falls in love and is tired of being a vampire. All worn out plot elements. Ultimately this film's slow pace is boring. It's not even sexy.",1383868800,3,1048,4.767955801104972

Neil Jordan plays with the rules of vampires by giving them more freedom within the rules, and overall structures to struggle against. Ultimately the characters are fully imagined and the family secrets allow for dramatic tension that pull slowly until things begin to crash down around the central characters.

Viewers (including my girlfriend) may be turned off by the very slow pacing, with little action, and sometimes little dialogue or long voice over portions, but the style pulls you into the story to make you understand the characters and their motivations to their fullest.",1383609600,3,835,5.0

5846747,3,B00DPUB59W,"Neil Jordan (""The Crying Game"") directs a UK-Irish fantasy thriller ""Byzantium"" starring Gemma Arterton and Saoirse Ronan as Clara and Eleanor Webb, two mysterious women staying at a run-down seaside hotel ""Byzantium."" They have secrets that no one should know. Their long-term relationship is severely tested when Eleanor is attracted to a lonely boy Frank (Caleb Landry Jones). Also, some secret organization seems trying to locate the girls.

You may think this is yet another vampire-themed fantasy movie. In fact, ""Byzantium"" seems not really interested in the romantic side of vampirism; the film explores what it is to survive while being ostracized (and ostracized in more than one way). The film's allegorical attempts to view the two lonely women are fine, but they are weakened by the heavy-handed narrative and supporting characters that are too many and not interesting.

Neil Jordan, having directed ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" back in 1994, is no stranger to the overcrowded genre where ""a new take"" seems no longer new. With atmospheric photography, ""Byzantium"" has a near-epic-scale back story that should be as intriguing as those of characters played by Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst in ""Interview,"" but in ""Byzantium"" two women's story, told in too many flashbacks that look more like a series of vignettes, only frustrates, not tantalizes, the viewers.",1380240000,4,1396,5.340909090909091

Jordan's BYZANTIUM is the melancholic tale of two vampires trying to eke out an existence while doing their best to hide their true nature from the mortal world. Comparisons to INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE are sure to turn some off but the imagery in this film is far more breathtaking, and the mythology far more riveting than what Jordan was able to accomplish with INTERVIEW. That's not to say it's a better film, I just feel it offered me a bit more.

If you're looking for action or teen romance, this isn't going to be for you. BYZANTIUM takes its time telling a story and it's a bit grittier, a whole lot more tragic and unconventional than modern vampire fare.

5846758,4,B00DPUB59W,"First off. I hate vampire movies. Vampires as a metaphor or literal, terrible plot device in my opinion. Almost as bad as zombies or werewolves.

But...
I like this movie.

The sense of drama is not overdone, there are some funny parts you have to laugh at the utter seriousness of it. Its not really ""new"" but I think its right up there with Warm Bodies and Beautiful Creatures. There is the idea of bringing horror into realism and asking the question: ""What would it really be like if..."" and then making a movie out of it.

Now to be fair, I am a deeply cynical and jaded movie watcher. My initial reason for choosing this movie was if the wife wanted to see a vampire movie at least don't make me pay $15 a ticket for it, lets stay near our bathroom and fridge on our couch with our headphones and do this.

I filtered this movie out based on 4 star rating and currently in theaters; wasn't disappointed.

5846759,5,B00DPUB59W,"Overall, this is an excellent movie and well worth the time and money to watch.  In a time of too many vampire movies, in particular Twilight, this was an interesting and unique story.  And it really moved away from the dangerous male vampire seducing an innocent girl.  There are 2 strong female lead characters.  It is very well acted, and I think it moves at a good pace revealing story as it goes.  I think at times it might appear slow, because it is building anticipation in the audience for resolution.  There is depth to the characters and realistic and interesting interaction/relationships.  There aren't clear divisions between good and evil.  Characters all fall somewhere in the gray area on the continuum, which really reflects the reality of the human or superhuman condition.",1377475200,25,791,4.9393939393939394

5846764,4,B00DPUB59W,"Neil Jordan's latest is a low key voyage into the human side of being a vampire. Mother and daughter team Clara and Eleanor are approaching their 200 year adolescent crisis. Forever 16, moody, creative Eleanor is the polar opposite of her flamboyant mother. The film focuses more on Eleanor who, raised in an orphanage that instilled moral authority is a kinder, gentler vampire. She is tired of being alone, lying to everyone she meets and is ripe for romance. She feeds only on the elderly whose lives have lost meaning and are ready to die. Her mother, sold into prostitution at an early age has a much different attitude toward the world and survival.

I was intrigued by the idea of a feminist plot. While the male vampires are quite upset when Clara ""steals"" her way into the boys club, that element of the plot is not nearly as fleshed out as the themes of loneliness, aimlessness and the quest for survival. What I liked most about the film was that I witnessed decent acting and character development rather than special effects. Unless you consider a fingernail growing and water turning red to be the epitome of CGI, there are no special effects or horrid transitions using make-up and blood is kept to a minimum. It is set to music which includes nice renditions of Beethoven's Sonata in C Major Op. 2 No. 3, Adagio, and Schubert's Landler D790 No. 4 and Nacht Und Traume, D.827, as well as Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues Op. 87 No. 2 in A Minor.

5846770,4,B00DPUB59W,"The concept behind Neil Jordan's film BYZANTIUM is compelling: A mother/daughter vampire story.  The grabs the attention right away.  Jordan as director makes in more interesting, and an eclectic cast that includes the rising Gemma Arterton, the unusual Caleb Landry Jones and the excellent Saoirse Ronan makes it a must-see.

BYZANTIUM is moody, atmospheric, often bloody, sometimes funny and always interesting horror tale.  It is not a SCARY movie...nor is it trying to be.  Vampires don't really scare anymore...but Jordan proves that they can be interesting subjects for story-telling.  BYZANTIUM is also often very slow moving and isn't quite as gripping as it thinks it is.  I enjoyed the movie, I guess...but in many ways I APPRECIATED it more than I loved it.

I don't really want to give away too much of the plot, because much of the film is really the slow telling of the backstory of these two vampires.  The film is set in modern times and shows how these two make their ways in the world.  (These vampires can go out during the day, by the way.)  They could probably settle into a ""normal"" life of sorts (except for the need to feed on blood and the lack of aging!), but they are being chases by a group determined to kill them.  Again, I won't say more, because finding out the history of these two and their relationship to the group attempting to root them out is the fun of the film.

Arterton spent her last few years of ""real"" life as a prostitute, and even centuries later, she is a vampire who makes a living in the sex trade.  Ronan was her daughter, abandoned to a convent as a baby and raised by nuns, and carries with her an intense guilt for what she is and a burning need to tell her story.  Normally, she writes her story down on paper as a cathartic device, and then destroys her writing...only to begin again.  Vampire OCD.  But when she meets the brooding but interesting Landry Jones and the two begin a tentative romance...will she be able to stop herself from sharing her story?

Eventually, of course, events from both the past and the present must collide climactically...and I found the resolution of the story to be quite satisfying.  While this film never quite got my blood pumping (I'd say Jordan is at his weakest as a director of action scenes)...I did find myself quite invested in the Ronan/Landry Jones relationship.  And I loved much of the tone of the film...it feels old-fashioned in so many ways, and tells a touching backstory.  This movie is an intelligent vampire film.  Yes, there are still moments of silliness or times when credulity is strained...but it's well plotted and well acted.

It's leisurely pace DOES keep it from being a visceral experience, as I said.  You care about the characters and you have an interest in the story and its outcome.  But I wanted to be swept away just a bit more.  Thus, I can only give this 4 stars out of 5.  But I believe it's well-worth seeing...particularly after the TWILIGHT movies and the speedy decent into camp that TRUE BLOOD has become made vampires either laughable or boring.  BYZANTIUM shows there's still plenty to explore in the dark realm of vampires.",1375228800,46,3162,4.669077757685352
