I use them not only as gifts to other Salsa dancers but also to test whether they have an NTSC video player & TV set up.
This is the cheapest ""BEST"" Salsa & Merengue video on the market.
Limited number of techniques but what can you expect for the price. Would make great PRESENTS for friends who want to
learn Salsa & Merengue but do not know any moves. I enjoyed this tape & when they did their freestyle demo's I was quite
happy as you could pick up moves not taught on the tape. Well worth buying.",1005091200,2,642,4.144
7926852,1,B00004Y7IG,"I wish i could rate it lower. The tape was hot, but only after i set it on fire rather than risk it escaping out to someone else.",999820800,,129,3.642857142857143
7926853,4,B00004Y7IG,This is an absolute beginners video but for the price it has got to be the best value for money. Limited number of moves taught but you can pick up more moves when they are giving their free style demo's. I think this is a must buy. It would make a great present for a friend who wants to learn these two dances & dosnot know a step. I am buying several more copies as Christmas presents. Well worth buying.,974419200,6,407,4.1
