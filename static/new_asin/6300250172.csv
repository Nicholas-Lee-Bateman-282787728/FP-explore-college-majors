273006,1,6300250172,"I usually read Amazon reviews carefully before buying anything, but this time I mixed-up this movie with what I saw at the end of a documentary about Bruce Lee. (probably ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruce-Lee-A-Warrior-s-Journey/dp/B00005UF83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruce Lee - A Warrior's Journey</a>"", as another reviewer suggested), so I was falsely confident.  What I got instead was definitely the worst movie I have ever seen. There was even a shot in the beginning with a still photo of Bruce Lee's face stuck on top of the replacement actor. I should have turned it off right there, but I was hoping that the real Bruce Lee shots would be worth the wait.  But even those were cut short, so skipping to the climax doesn't help.  Please, do not watch this movie.  If my mistake and suffering can have any meaning, let it be to save someone else from making the same mistake!",1452038400,,927,5.285714285714286

273015,3,6300250172,"It's been many years since I'd seen this film, and all I could remember of it was Bruce's fight with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Watching it now, you can easily see how many of the scenes don't have Bruce in them at all, but have been shot after his death with stand-ins, or edited in from previous films. A scene of when a film crew is supposedly making the Bruce Lee-Chuck Norris scene from Return Of The Dragon is pretty obvious, as are edited-in shots from Fists Of Fury, and other items. It's a noble attempt, even if it rarely works.

But there's enough there to make this a better film than others that cost 500 times more to make. For instance, the fight scenes in the pagoda are perfect, as is the corny ""Wax!"" moment. Interesting, by the way, how much like Doctor Evil the character of Doctor Land is... I wonder...",1414540800,,818,4.417218543046357

273099,5,6300250172,I enjoyed Game Of Death a lot. I thought it was a great movie. I remember seeing this film years ago and really liking it despite a lot of the negativity surrounding it because Bruce Lee wasn't in it a lot and wasn't involved in the film since he passed on. It's too bad Bruce Lee had passed away and he isn't in the film that long as another actor takes his place. There is a great action. I liked the story. I liked that they had Kareen Abdual Jabbar in it. I liked all of Bruce Lee's film that I saw. I think if you can look at this as a regular Kung fu movie and not a Bruce Lee film you will enjoy it. It's a good kung fu movie and escapism. I liked the ending of the movie. I wish Lee had made more movies but he was taken from us too soon. His legend lives on forever though. I say give this one a rent or buy if you can get it cheap.,1405209600,,841,3.7570621468926553
273100,3,6300250172,"Fantastic title sequence, one that would not be out of place in a James Bond film.
Classic, yet well-shot and thrilling finale as our hero literally fights through levels of bad guys to gain ultimate justice.
In between is a sick, weak money grab. But the 5 minutes starting and 10 ending made me glad they did it.",1403136000,,314,4.431034482758621
273101,3,6300250172,"The movie opens like it's going to be a Bruce Lee spy film ala James Bond, with the use of roulette wheels, card tables and other props referencing the 'Game' of Death and the classic Bond aperture in the closing titles. Even the music was conducted by John Barry who scored many Bond films including Goldfinger, Thunderball and You Only Live Twice to name a few. Coincidentally Lee was slated to do a movie with one time James Bond George Lazenby.

One of the main problems with this movie was it's poor filmmaking, which may come as a surprise as Sammo Hung has done some acclaimed martial arts films. In the beginning of the movie there is a scene where Lee is talking to someone in his dressing room, it seems that the two actors were not even filmed at the same location as in one of the shots it looks like Bruce Lee's head has even been superimposed onto someone else's body. The other main problem with this movie was something that could not be avoided and that was the death of Bruce Lee. The movie was released in 1978 even though Lee died in 1973, so there were many things that had to be changed before it's final release. When the main character (Lee) is 'killed off' it is essentially because Lee had died during filming.

In the funeral scene actual footage was used making that more or less a questionable decision. It was almost surreal to see a scene where Bruce Lee's character (basically playing a real life version of himself) is shot by a gun with a real bullet in it while filming on set. Seeing as how this is the way Brandon Lee, Bruce's son, died 15 years after the movies release, this scene becomes increasingly disturbing. However, if you just fast forward the movie to the final fight scenes, you will not be disappointed. Bruce Lee wears his iconic yellow and black jumpsuit and puts on an unforgettable show, which in it's own right, makes the movie worth watching.",1397865600,,1898,4.498550724637681
273102,1,6300250172,"The original intent of Game of Death, when Bruce Lee started filming, was a continuation of his mission concerning martial arts.  To be rid of rehearsed routines and set ways and to adapt to all forms of fighting.

In his words:  The way of no way.

He completed approximately one third of the film before Warner Brothers came a callin' and wanted him to be in and take charge of the first Hong Kong/Hollywood production of a martial arts film.  That film became the legendary and incomparable Enter the Dragon.

His intent was to resume filming of Game of Death in September of 1973.  As we all know, he was unable to finish this film.  He died in July of a cerebral edema at the far too young age of 32.

It would have been nice if Raymond Chow and director Robert Clouse put some effort into finding the original notes and script of his vision of the film.  It would have been a great tribute.

Instead, Chow and Clouse gave us this cheap and exploitive abomination.  A film that has nothing whatsoever to do with what Lee wanted.  A film that resorts to cheap camera tricks, unworthy martial artists pretending to be what they're not and, most horribly, using footage of Lee's funeral as a plot point.

Raymond Chow a friend of his?  Not from where I stand.  And I'm sure that daughter Shannon Lee and widow Linda Lee Cadwell think the same.  Good thing not they, and not one person on earth, could stop them from making this awful example of cinema.

It's just basically a standard revenge plot about a martial artist faking his own death to catch a killer.  Those are dime a dozen.  It features Gig Young (not knowing where he was because he was drunk), Hugh O'Brien (being a 50s B-movie star and it's the 70s) and Dean Jagger (an actor I loved in White Christmas and have less respect for now).

The first time I put this stink burger in my DVD player I saw it as far as the funeral scene.  It was so offensive that I ripped it out of the player and threw it in my recycling bin.  I saw it later on Netflix and was sorry I did.

Avoid this at all costs.",1384214400,,2060,4.3046875

overlook the cheesy plot that they reworked from Lee's original idea for the movie.  However, I can't, with all my might, stand the ridiculous whiny cat noises Billy Lo makes when he fights; which is a shame, because the fight choreography is excellent - from both the original Lee and his doubles.

273255,2,6300250172,"This was the film Bruce Lee was working on when he died. He had stopped working on this film to work on Enter the Dragon and never had the chance to come back and finish this. The good news is that Lee shot a good 30 minutes worth of footage for Game of Death. The bad news is Robert Clouse came around and tried to make an entire film leading up to the Bruce Lee footage that was shot including Bruce Lee look-a-likes and cardboard cut-outs. The entire film is pretty awful since the story is lame and the acting is over dramatic. I'm surprised Sammo Hung agreed to be a part of this at all. The archived footage of Bruce Lee just seems forced and thrown in to try and make a buck while the actual footage of Lee's funeral just feels tasteless and inconsiderate. Clouse would unfortunately give birth to something that would spawn many films including Bruce Lee clones starring the likes of Bruce Li. The actual Bruce Lee footage is some of his best, but is shown in its entirety in the documentary A Warrior's Journey included in the special edition of Enter the Dragon. If you're a Bruce Lee fan, don't waste your time with this.

Most of the footage left shot was re-takes after re-takes being Lee was such a perfectionist.

In a Warriors Story documentary, you see the remaining footage edited together nicely in what would have been the ending of the movie.
That being said........the directors of Games of Death did not have access to Lee's notes or what his vision was for the movie, this movie came out in 1978....5 full years after he died, and who knows when they actually started on it...1976?  who knows.

What you get is a decent story line, good Amircian actors, good mucic score.  Actually the production quality of this movie ranks about the best of any Lee movie (exception Enter the Dragon).

The stand in are good.

If you just watched this movie for the very first time and knew NOTHING about its background, you'd say it wasn't bad at all.

What we get is a directors vision of a movie and uses the last footage of Bruce Lee, to me thats not bad.
I do wish the director used all of the Lee footage, and got them other 2 guys with him back to make it a better movie, but it is what it is.

BUT I must say this.........now that the original Bruce Lee notes and ideas and lost footage has been found.

Please Hollywood.....or Harvest Moon Productions, make a authentic ""Games Of Death"" to the best of your abilities, making it what Lees vision was.  Using todays computer enhancements and technology, Im sure a decent film came be rendered......actually, one could almost make a version themselves on their own personal computer using all the footage available, maybe someone will.",1243123200,,1739,4.598705501618123

273263,1,6300250172,"The Game of Death is the biggest disappointment you can watch as a Bruce Lee fan. It is not even a Bruce Lee film. It is a film with a terrible story, a stunt double, Bruce Lee's face pasted on the shoulders of the stunt double (yes it is actually like a photo on someone's shoulders), sequences taken from other Bruce Lee films you have seen before and the two fight scenes filmed with Bruce Lee before he died.

So most people want to watch it for the 11 minutes of Bruce Lee where he appears right at the end. There is the nunchaku fight scene and the Kareem Abdul Jabbar fight.

The bottom line is that there is a much better way to do this than watching this train wreck. The film is absolutely chronically bad and the production should have been shelved and the fight sequences released in a documentary. That is the way this should have been done... in fact it has been done! It's called ""Bruce Lee - A Warrior's Journey"" (2000). If you have any sense you would get that if you want to watch this for the Bruce Lee fight sequence. It contains all of this sequence and more (outtakes).

The fight scene is a classic though, although it is debatable if it's his best. It is Lee with more experience and his styles are even wider than before. He also wears a legendary yellow jumpsuit with black stripes and cute matching shoes. The outfit appears in the Tekkan games with the character Marshal Law.

This terrible film should never have been remastered for release in the Martial Arts section of Contender Entertainment Group's `Hong Kong Legends'. It should have been omitted from the Bruce Lee box set and replaced with A Warrior's Journey.

Anyway, A Warrior's Journey is where it is at. Bruce Lee would have personally smashed this production to splinters.",1205020800,4,1765,4.52037617554859

A very bad decision, because the finished product is one of the most broken and comically bad kung Fu films ever made. It's not that I'm angry that they decided to finish the film with out Bruce, but if you're going to finish a film make sure that your star is in at least half of the footage. Instead Bruce Lee is in about 10% and the rest is his body double with a Bruce Lee head pasted on his shoulder. He'll be fighting and the head will remain motionless and expresstionless, it's like a gag video from youtube. On the other hand, the 10% that Bruce is in(Not his evil pasted head clone)is classic. No one can forget his fight with Kareem and it's truly one of the most memorable fights in Kung Fu film history. The rest of the film is a painful bore. I find out fast that this wasn't really a Bruce Lee film at all. Just a poorly fabricated movie built around 15 minutes of Lee footage that only comes in at the end.

Bruce Lee plays as Billy Lo who is being blackmailed by some mafia gangsters. Naturally, Billy refuses to cooperate and that makes him a target for elimination by the gangsters. Since Bruce Lee died during the making of the movie, most of the film is played by Tai Chung Kim, who performed reasonably well. To disguise the fake Bruce Lee, he can be seen wearing sunglasses, fake beards and bandages. I, however, enjoyed the fights, although they are not up to the standard of Bruce Lee.

Of course, the parts that Bruce Lee really appeared were first class. An example is when he has to fight Kareem Abdul-Jabber. Unfortunately, Bruce Lee only appears for only about 11 minutes or so.

The movie could have been made better if the plot was sensible. So my recommendation is to rent the movie and not to buy it: it is not worth buying.",1146873600,20,1097,4.50251256281407

  Now tell me this, in all of Bruce Lee's previos movies, has tere been any motor bike chases? No!

I'm moved they put Lee's funeral shots in . very moving. goes to show that even though he's dead he's respected even in a movie he never got to finish. there are some laughs in this movie. the look alikes to Bruce Lee really do look like him. the fight scenes and choreography are amazing. see this movie if you have an open heart and mind. I will be viewing this more and more in ode to Lee and in ode to his talent as a kung fu teacher master, and actor and person in general.

273342,5,6300250172,"When this film first came out, I did not know that Bruce Lee was dead.  I was born in 1972(July 22)and I of course assumed he was alive.  I assumed that Alexander Fu Sheng was alive also.  I always wondered why I did not see him anymore...

People like to put this film down.  Of course it would have been better to work with Lee's origianl plan, but if they had not put this out, no one would have known about it and we would not have seen Lee's illest fights and the cool yellow suit.

They put together a decent film and mangaed to find excuses not to show the stand-in's face.  Now people claim thatr the stand-in sucked, but I have to say that the stand in was nice.  You can't deny the locker room fight.  The stand-in had nice kicks and he was also in ""Game of Death II.""  That was an ill movie also.  Dare I say iller than this.  They did good with what they had.

Now I would like to see someone put out all fulllength footage of Lee's interviews and making of films.  As well as All footage of ""The Game of Death.""  Then we could see the outside scenes and Lee in a funny brown 70's suit.  If only he could have lived to make just two more films...

They should also take the original film and give it to Hollywood to reedit them, re-dub them and add redo the sound as new for DVD or something.  THe man is not coming back so they should give the HK films the Hollywood treatment.  Make it happen.",1101772800,2,1407,4.069343065693431
273343,3,6300250172,"Before watching this film,I knew that Bruce Lee died before finishing it,so my expectations where that Bruce would come out in some parts of the films and other parts would be doubled.

Plot

Bruce Lee stars as a martial arts movie star, Billy Lo

who has a white girlfriend, who are threatened by a mafia

organization. Of couree Billy refuses, the mafia orders

a hit on him and thinks he is dead , of course he isn't.

The sad part is that a large bulk of the film isn't played

by Lee but his body double, Tai Chung Kim. However he has

a pretty good double, the movie has some pretty good fights

done by the double, although he obviously lacks the body Bruce had.

That is the frame of my mind you have to have with this film. However you will probably have to fast forward to the only fluid moments with the Master Bruce Lee. The 60 minutes use pictures of Bruce Lee in the fights but it's a bad idea. The movie could have been cut considerably into maybe a 30 min to 45 min ,but instead we are forced to stomach, a Bruce Lee wannabee who cant compare an eye to the Master, and who gets his butt kicked throught the movie.

The footage with Bruce Lee, is incredible. The fight scenes last up to 10-15 minutes total, but they are so physical, they probably took up several rehearsals to shoot.

Bruce was filming ""Enter The Dragon"" while filming this film. He and the Directors did the right thing by filming the end first because of Bruce's busy schedule.

You cant call this film an overall great action movie like one reviewer said because it has many faults. It's too too long (90 minutes) and the Bruce Look alike gets beat for half the film until the Real Bruce Lee shows up at the end.

Also the Bruce Lee double in this film is just plain puny looking. He looks as if he has never lifted weights.

What I would have done to make the film more enjoyable is shorten the film, immensely, then put a biograpy about Bruce , so as not to leave the viewer unsatisfied with the film.

No one today can do what Bruce Lee did in his prime (ask Chuck Norris who has failed miserably copying his moves and is now doing a laughable show called Walker).",1097971200,,2153,4.266009852216749

However,  thanks to Bruce Lee - A Warrior's Journey (now widely available complete and uncut as an extra on the Enter the Dragon 2-disc special edition dvd!), it is now possible to see both this fight scene and the once lost fight scenes leading up to it cut and edited the way Bruce Lee originally intended. As a result, Game of Death has been rendered completely and utterly pointless and should forever be relegated to the trash can.",1097971200,2,631,4.675675675675675

In the rest of the movie, the inconveniantly dead Lee is doubled by some other guys. I bet the writers wrote this movie based on how they could disguise the doubles. Doubles are seen wearing sunglasses, bandages, and even fake beards. In one classic instance, Bruce Lee's face is superimposed over one of the doubles. The plot itself is really awful and enough to make one sort of queasy, but the movie, while not for the purist, is a certifiable curio.
The DVD is in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The picture looks bright, but a few scenes are scratchy, and the colour often bleeds. The box advertises a theatrical trailer, even showing a picture of the main menu with ""theatrical trailer"" as one of the options.

273347,3,6300250172,"While billed as the ""final film of Bruce Lee"", it is important to note that this movie just splices footage from other Lee films in with both shots of a Lee double and the only actual material that Bruce recorded for the film, which clocks in at just over 20 minutes. The way that the filmmakers try to pass off a poor double as the real Bruce reminds one of the infamous Bela Lugosi ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" curtain call. While the first hour or so of the movie is laughably bad, one of the big anti-climatic fights involving Bruce and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is worth every dime you put in. The jaw-dropping battle uses well-placed fight choreography as opposed to today's fancy camera tricks to make for one of the best martial arts fight routines captured on film. For those who want to know, the plot of the film surrounds a martial arts film star who fakes his death and returns to seek revenge on the mob. In a twisted sense of irony, Bruce's character is shot on a movie set with a gun that is filled with real bullets instead of blanks, the very same accident that would claim his son, Brandon, on the set of ""The Crow"", nearly twenty years later.",1086652800,,1153,4.392523364485982
273348,2,6300250172,"While watching this movie again, I actually got quite angry. I thought of all the things wrong with this turd of a movie. I thought of the greedy movie producers who say a payday in the lost footage of Game Of Death. I thought of the horrid & cheesy way they made this movie. I thought of the way Raymond Chow was responsible for this crap even though he had worked with Bruce for many years. This movie is a insult to Bruce Lee, plain and simple. This should have NEVER been made. And then you get to the last 15-20 min......
The ONLY, and I mean ONLY reason to watch (what I call) the worst movie I have EVER seen is for the last 15-20 min. It's there you get the footage of Bruce Lee fighting three enemies in the bogota that was later going to be part of the real Game Of Death. I will get to that in a bit. I would like to comment on how utterly crappy the rest of the film is.
The story goes something like this: Bruce was in the middle of filming Game Of Death when he got the green light on Enter The Dragon. He then halted production on Game Of Death and went to america to make the greatest martial arts film of all time. Upon returning to Hong Kong, he went to a ""friend's"" apartment and laid down to take a nap. He had a headache so this friend of his gave him some asperin. He never woke up. I won't go into all the conspiracies behind his death, but the point is, he died. Game of Death was then left unfinished. Fast foward SIX years....ugh.
It's 1979 and some producers get the idea to take the footage of Game Of Death that was shot and make a movie around it. What you have here is a double of Bruce playing most of the movie. It's got mostly american hollywood actors in it. It has an american director, Robert Klause (who I hope dies a painful death for directing this movie), and a terrible story. The worst part of the movie, however, is the cheesy way they intercut scenes from Bruce's other films to make it seem like he is in this movie. The double for Bruce rarely shows his full face. He hides behing huge sunglasses, even at night. They even have a scene where he gets shot in the face, has surgery, and comes out looking like a different double of Bruce!!! They even used footage of Bruce's real funeral in the movie. In the script, Bruce's fake character fakes his own death to get a crime syndicate off of his back. Instead of staging a fake funeral, like I said, they use REAL footage!! Another disgrace.
There is even a scene where the Bruce double is supposed to be looking into a mirror and they have put a cardboard cut-out of Bruce Lee's face over the double's image in the frame. I have never in my life seen something look so fake and ridiculous in a movie. Especially one that was supposed to be some big budget movie of 1979. The story is utter crap. The acting is actually the best of all of his films (except for Enter The Dragon), but the actors don't fit into this kind of movie. They are all established american actors, who don't belong in a Hong Kong kung fu film.
I could go on and on about how bad this movie is. It's a insult to Bruce Lee, plain and simple. I liken this to going to his grave, urinating on it, and then leaving. He deserved much better than this and it's a shame that Hollywood continued to treat him like this, even after his death.
Now, after all of that.....why would I even give this DVD two stars? Well, because of the footage that actually has Bruce in it. These are the best fight scenes he ever filmed. There is one the best nunchuku battles (with Dan Inosanto) to ever be filmed. He battles Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the last stage of the bogota. It's a fun battle to watch, due the height difference between the two. I am sure many of you have seen these lost scenes, so you know what I mean. It's the only reason to watch this movie. In fact, do yourself a favor and skip to these fights by using your chapter selection feature. You will be happy I saved you that extra 1:15 hrs. of your life.

I feel many people did not give Bruce Lee his credit for this movie. You have to be blind to not see the value of this movie.

273400,4,6300250172,"Game of Death is much more than a film; for this Bruce Lee fan, it is an emotional experience - both good and bad.  Bruce Lee died suddenly early in the shooting of the film, yet the fight scenes that would serve as the late moments of the movie were much too good to deny all of the Bruce Lee fans and mourners in the world.  Finishing this movie and releasing it to the world was a tough decision, and the film suffers from both the plot manipulation that serves to tie the pieces of the scant 10-15 minutes of Bruce Lee footage together with the radically changed storyline as well from the competent stand-in who is in no way, shape, or form the equal of Bruce Lee, but for me personally, the merits of Game of Death far outweigh the negative connotations associated with it.  Many a devoted Bruce Lee fan will disagree and decry this mutated film as a travesty and insult to the legendary man, and I can understand such feelings.  In the end, each Bruce Lee devotee must come to his/her own conclusion as to the merits of this film.  It is important to note that Game of Death was released six full years after Bruce Lee's death, and this fact does much in my mind to offset allegations some make that Bruce's memory was exploited purely for profit here; as I see it, Game of Death is a controversial gift to Bruce Lee's fans and in some ways a tribute to the amazing man's life and career.  Many fans will hold the opposite opinion.
It is difficult to know the full history of this film as it evolved over time.  As I understand it, much of the actual Bruce Lee footage (less than fifteen minutes of the released film) was shot in 1972, and Lee served as writer, choreographer, and even director of the film ; during production, though, he suspended filming in order to make the triumphant Enter the Dragon.  After finishing that project, Lee apparently planned to rewrite and re-shoot Game of Death, but he died suddenly and tragically before his new vision could be formulated.  Later, Robert Clouse decided to complete the project, using a stand-in (who is obviously not Bruce Lee) for most of the dramatic and some of the early fighting scenes, re-shooting some scenes with the original surviving actors, and pasting in some close-ups from Enter the Dragon.  There is one awful shot early on showing an obviously pasted-on image of Lee's face which is just frighteningly amateurish, but the stand-in is also unimpressive.  Consigned to sunglasses or a helmet in order to hide his eyes, the stand-in is most obvious in the fight scenes he takes part in; talented he may be, but he is no Bruce Lee.  Some plot twists involving a faked death and plastic surgery serve as the new plot's weakest points, but perhaps the most controversial decision Clouse made was the inclusion of some shots of Bruce Lee's actual funeral.
The story really isn't that important; it is just a means to an end.  The fight scenes making up the final portion of the film are what really matter, and it is here that we get to see the real Bruce Lee in action.  Part of Lee's original vision of this film was a series of climactic fights showcasing different fighting styles, and we find his character working his way up through a ladder of increasingly dangerous opponents, culminating in the amazing fight between Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  I believe Kareem actually studied under Lee for some time, and his performance is quite amazing, especially as he absolutely towers over Bruce Lee.  I feel safe in saying that Kareem was the only man to ever make Bruce Lee look small.  Of course, the larger they are, the harder they fall, especially when Bruce Lee is the man doing the chopping.  This fight with Kareem is something that no Bruce Lee fan should miss; skip over the rest of the movie if you want to, but you owe it to yourself to watch this fight scene.
Of course, one must also mention the uncanny parallel between this film and the future life and career of Bruce Lee's son Brandon.  In this film, Bruce Lee's martial arts movie star character is shot during the filming of a scene; here it is a willful act of murderous intent, but in the case of Brandon Lee's shooting death during the filming of The Crow the ironically parallel occurrence is a mystery that has never been adequately explained.  Game of Death carries a unique and unsurpassed weight of emotional baggage, and I would simply urge Bruce Lee fans not to dismiss this film out of hand; whether you come to view it as a tribute or a travesty, it is a film that should not be ignored.",1065052800,,4545,4.533007334963325

273404,3,6300250172,"Bruce Lee (AKA: Lee Jun Fan), is one of film history's most talented action stars of all time, and it shows on every movie he made ! He was respected by a whole lot of people from the US and in Hong Kong during his existence in the early '70s. He has made four smash hit martial arts movies like ""Fists of Fury"", ""The Chinese Connection"", ""Return of the Dragon"", and ""Enter The Dragon"". All of these films shot Lee to stardom. And finally, it comes down to Lee's fifth and final movie ""Game of Death"". This movie was originally filmed, months after ""Enter The Dragon"". Unfortunately, after he died of cerebral edema in July 20, 1973, Bruce Lee only completed a third of the film. The film remained incomplete for five years. Finally in 1978, Raymond Chow and Robert Clouse finished the film and threw in the scenes Lee was in before his death, and some additional with a Bruce Lee lookalike, Tang Lung. This movie turned out okay, but unfotunately for my taste, it was a little dull, since a third of the film didn't include the REAL Bruce Lee. It's very simple to realize that when Lee is fighting sloppily, everyone knows it's just the lookalike, Tang Lung himself, but at least he looks like Lee in almost every way. Besides, if it weren't for Tang Lung, ""Game of Death"" would've remained incomplete for 25 years, and I give him credit for that. Everybody else should ! Another drawback of the movie is the voice acting on some characters. One of the fighters sounded like an answering machine voice with an Asian accent. I laughed a bit, but all in all, I thought it was ridiculous ! Granted, I really liked the action sequecnes, especially the big fight between Bruce Lee and former Basketball sensation, Kareem Abdul Jabbar. However, some of the fight scenes turned out a little plain, when Tang Lung tags along as the Lee lookalike, but his fighting skills are fairly interesting, but not as good as the real thing, and you know who I'm talking about ! All in all, this turned out to be a unique martial arts classic like all of Bruce Lee's films, but not what I have come to expect ! The flaws of the film were too noticeable and the fact that Bruce Lee was replaced by his double, Tang Lung, is way too noticeable. That's what I didn't like about the film.

Like what the heck do people want! To tell you the truth it would be even more depressing if Chow only released the twelve minute footage of Lee in the pagoda scenes! Think about it! At least you can see memorable clips from Lee and also the classic Pagoda scenes featuring Dan Inosanto and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!

273406,1,6300250172,"I first became intersted in this film because I was watching the original Bruce Lee fight scenes from this film on the American Movie Classics channel.  I was mesmerized by the action sequences and vowed to own the DVD because from what I saw, the story line was awesome and the action sequences were the best I had ever seen!  Unfortuately, I'm not a huge Bruce Lee buff, so I didn't know which movie I was watching at the time.
After I did a search for Lee and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, I happened upon this film: Game of Death.  Since this movie boasted to be the only movie to show Kareem and Lee's only fight sequence, I figured this must be the movie I had been viewing on AMC.  However, unbeknownst to me, AMC was showing A Warriors Journey, which had all the footage from this film, including additional footage that was edited out in the 1979 release of Game of Death (such as scenes where Lee and Kareem Abdul Jabbar talk during their fight and scenes of Lee's two buddies fighting the bosses and getting the crap kicked out of them until Lee steps up to regulate).  In this movie, Lee's two buddies are gone and Kareem's fight sequence is quick and painless, along with other notable edits that made the movie that much more painful to digest.
As if the disappointment of not seeing all the scenes I had been engrossed in on AMC wasn't horrible enough, the story to this movie [is not good].  It's just a bunch of garbage thrown together to try and get a profit off never before released fight scenes using a cookie-cutter storyline that's been done a billion times before.  The story is too confusing to even go into detail over, due to trying to make the movie last 90 minutes and still relay the story into Lee's final fight scenes, but I'll mention these elements: mafia, kidnapping a girlfriend, and extortion.  (Ironically, the mafia isn't even Chinese, but American, even though the movie is set in China!  They should have just set the movie in San Francisco or something!  ARRGGHH!) I hope you see what I mean when I say ""a bunch of garbage thrown together"".
If you're familiar with dumb 1970s movies that never should have been made, you're probably familiar with this one and just don't know it.  If you're not familiar with some of the horrible movies to come out of the '70s, please trust me when I say to skip this one ...",1033776000,,2342,4.474178403755869

True, it didn't fully capture Bruce Lee's work due to his untimely death; however, the film itself is a good martial arts flick. I was impressed by the fight scenes displayed by Bruce Lee himself and the plot of the movie was not too bad either. I would strongly suggest getting the ultimate platnum region 2 DVD version of Game of Death with the restored footage of Bruce Lee's battles that were not included in the original movie. If you can't find it, then get ""Bruce Lee-A Warrior's Journey"" because that DVD not only has the lost footage on Game of Death but also has interviews with Bruce Lee about his personal life, doing martial arts flicks, etc... Though I have never actually seen A Warior's Journey, it is good based on reviewers who are Bruce Lee fans or people who just want to see the lost footage from Game of Death.",1033516800,3,902,4.407185628742515
273408,4,6300250172,"Most Bruce Lee fans HATE this movie.  They (or I should say ""we"", since I'm a Bruce Lee fan) note the use of very transparent doubling by Kim Tai Chung & others, the drastic change of plot from Lee's original story-line, & the use of footage from Lee's actual funeral in the film.
I understand why these fans dislike ""Game of Death"" so much & I respect their beliefs.  However, I think these fans are reacting a bit too strongly.
There are some good points to this movie:
1.  The high production values.  Remember, this is 1978.  Hong-Kong movies from THIS time period weren't what they are today.  Jackie Chan was just starting to find his way with ""Snake In The Eagle's Shadow"" & with the exception of the Shaw Brothers, most Hong-Kong films from this time period were cheap, exploitation flicks.  We're still a few years away from John Woo, Tsui Hark, or Ang Lee.
2.  The John Barry musical score.  Remember him?  He's the one behind ""The James Bond Theme.""
3.  The opening title credits by John Christopher Strong the Third.  The floating games of chance, combined with John Barry's musical score give the film a ""classy"" action-movie feel, like a Bond film, quality-wise, that is.
4.  The major American stars Dean Jagger, Hugh O'Brien, Gig Young, & Colleen Camp.  Okay, this is supposed to be Hong-Kong & one reviewer pointed out that in real-life, the heads of Hong-Kong's papers & crime-syndicates would be Chinese.  But again, this is 1978.  Lee did want to break out onto the mainstream by working with major ""American"" actors.  (Lee himself, of course was an American, since Lee was born in San Francisco, but raised in Hong-Kong.)  ""Enter The Dragon"", while being an obvious James Bond swipe, was successful, not only because of Lee's great talent & charisma, but also because that film featured American stars at the time.  (If you can consider John Saxon a ""star"", that is.)
5.  The locker-room fight.  No, that's not Bruce Lee fighting Bob Wall, it's doubles Kim Tai Chung & Chen Yao Po.  But it still is impressive & for this scene, at least, the cutting in of clips from ""Way of The Dragon"" (or ""Return of The Dragon"") actually works.
6.  The plot.  Okay, some people don't like the story, but it's obviouse that writer Jan Spears based the story on the rumors surrounding Lee's death.  (In truth, he died of an allergic reaction to the pain-pill Equagesic, causing his brain to swell with an edema.  However, there were rumors, and that's all they were, just rumors, that he was killed by the Triads for refusing to give them a piece of his successful film-company.)  The character of ""Billy Lo"", faking his death after an attempted murder, so that he can do battle with the syndicate, is based on the Bruce Lee MYTH.  (Kind of like the way the 1957 Elvis vehicle ""Loving You"" is based on the Elvis Presley myth.)
I'm not arguing with the fans who hate this movie.  They are fans of a true innovative genius of the martial-arts & so I can't say that they are wrong.  However, the REAL script & missing additional footage from Lee's original ""Game of Death"" wasn't uncovered until the mid-1990's.  I'm not saying Raymond Chow & Robert Clouse weren't thinking of money when they ""finished"" ""Game of Death.""  (After all, the film industry is a business.)  But I don't see an exploitation picture when I watch ""Game of Death.""  Instead, I see a well-intentioned (if somewhat misguided) tribute to the genius of Bruce Lee.
P.S.  To see what Bruce Lee intended for his original version of ""Game of Death"", watch ""Bruce Lee:  A Warrior's Journey.""  This documentary has a detailed rendering of Lee's script outline, as well as over 30 minutes of completed footage for the film's finale.",1025913600,17,3697,4.684782608695652

Now they could have been smart and think into the future and tried to complete the movie with look-alikes, but with the original script and characters, brought in Lee's top students like Dan Inosanto and Ted Wong and so on for second hand knowledge of Bruce's style. Later in the future, like now! They could use CGI or Computer Animation to complete it. This is not far fetched because George Lucas thought of computer technology in the future when he filmed STAR WARS in 1977! This movie came out in 1978. Well I don't think it's impossible, but now half the cast is old and two are dead so they would all be CGI if Film Makers could complete the Game Of Death.",1018569600,,780,4.461538461538462
273466,5,6300250172,"I don't have to complement anymore on how badly they did this movie which probably made Bruce turn over in his grave, but the fighting where Bruce was in the film is true magic. This film amazingly enough grossed out Enter the Dragon at the box office when released and set the record at the time for most extras in any film, haha. Yes the film was doubles galore with some being pathetically awful in every perspective (acting and looks). The story of Game of Death?...Bruce is an upcoming movie star named Billy Lo with a bright future and he has a gf whom is an upcoming singer. A mafia organization within the entertainment industry wants them to sign a contract to work for them,Billy and gf refuses,mafia threatens them,attempts to murder Billy,Billy fakes death and sets out for revenge. The leader of mafia happens to stay at the top of some pagoda tower with 3 floors, each floor being guarded by a great fighter. Bruce's intention with the film was a little different: Bruce plays a character named Hai Tien, a retired martial arts champion who is being harassed by some underground Korean mafia group to participate in ""The Game of Death"" where a contestant must accend a pagoda tower consisting of 5 floors with a fighter on each floor. The one who gets to the top gets some treasure. Hai refuses,his brother and sister gets kidnapped, he sets out for revenge and particiates in the ""Game"". Only the top 3 floors of fighting was shot before Bruce's death, but it was a masterpiece of filming. Robert Clouse changed the whole story and added a pretty decent musical score to it. There are two other fight scenes with the doubles in this film that are pretty decent, the one in the locker room with Bob Wall, and the bike scene. The main reason to own this movie is of course Bruce's signature fights with Dan Inosanto and Kareem. This is the only film where there is a nunchaku battle, and a great one at that. I feel sorry for those who are getting this horrible US Fox version of the film because the sound is pitiful. If you can play Region 2 PAL dvds, then the Hong Kong Legends platinum version of Game of Death is the masterpiece to own. This is the only dvd that has ANY of the surviving cut footage from the scenes that Bruce shot. Yes, the fighting scenes in Robert Clouse's Game of Death are cut, and if you want to see the entire scene the way Bruce intended, this is the only dvd that has it plus many other cut scenes. Plus everything on this dvd is remastered and unmatched. There are more than 4 hours of extras surrounding Game and this a 2-DVD Platinum set. Many have bought the dvd solely to see the cut footage. There is also a cut glasshouse fight scene with a Bruce double that is admittedly awesome. So do yourself a favor and get a regionless dvd player with PAL converter because this dvd is essential. The 5+ stars is for this dvd...I give the Fox version 2 stars, too watered down. All of Bruce's films are magnificent...Fist of Fury (not Fists, and it is Chinese Connection here), Big Boss (Fists of Fury here), Way of the Dragon (Return here), and Enter the Dragon...Had Bruce lived on to complete his script, it would have probably been his greatest film, the scenes he shot were mindblowing and just so far ahead of its time...he is a martial arts genious whose films and philosophy will live on forever...hope this and my other martial arts film reviews are helpful.",1017964800,3,3408,4.5072697899838445
273467,5,6300250172,"Yes, the bulk of the film is awful.  However, Lee's fight with Kareem Abdul-Jabaar is  one of his signiture fights. The height disparity between the two combatants obviously was a challenge for Lee to choreograph around, and he does it superbly. I think it is worth seeing the fight as part of some slightly cohesive fillm rather than as a featurette or part of a documentary.  The storyline portion of the film while not great at all does at least provide a decent buildup to the last fight scene.
  I recommend it for those who know what the film is comprised of and just are interested in seeing the limited Bruce Lee footage anyway.  But I would not recommend it for a casual fan of action films looking to pick something out for a Friday night.  For that, pick up Enter the Dragon, Return of the Dragon, Fists of Fury (originally ""The Big Boss"") or Chinese Connection (confusingly titled ""Fists of Fury"" originally.""

273469,1,6300250172,"This movie has to be one of the worst Bruce Lee movies I have ever seen, but I knew that had to be oblivious since he died before the movie was finished. I decided to get it because I thought it could stand on its own, but in reality it can't stand on its own because its billed as ""Bruce Lee's Final Movie"" and he only appears in about 20 minutes of it and only 12 minutes was from his original project ""Game of Death"".
 The original project was supposed to be about a group of seekers (led by Lee) that would raid some tower and seek out the greatest fighters of all time. Unfortunately, Lee decided to put the project on hold when he was contacted to do ""Enter The Dragon"" and then died before he could restart his ""Game of Death"" production. All was left was the ending that Lee shot.
 So to capture on the legend of the late Bruce Lee, it was decided to complete a version of ""Game of Death"" with a new storyline and some doubles. It was so oblivious when the fakes were on the screen and having close-ups of the real Bruce Lee from his other movies made it look even faker. I could have live with the fake Lee sound effects and voice because many of Lee's movies were dubbed into English anyways, but knowing it isn't Lee makes me want to either laugh at the people billing this as a ""Bruce Lee film"".
 The story is basically about Billy Lo (Bruce Lee and a few fakes), a actor, that fakes his death when some mobsters try to kill him for refusing to join them. Billy then spends most of the movie seeking revenge, and then confronts the mobster's henchmen and picks them off one by one. The ""henchmen scenes"" come from the original ""Game of Death"" concept  with the real Bruce Lee.
 It should still find a place in your Bruce Lee or Marital Arts movie collection for a few reasons:
1. Colleen Camp.
2. The fight scene with Bob Wall and the fake Bruce Lee in the locker room.
3. Using real footage from Bruce Lee's funeral as backdrop to ""Billy Lo's"" funeral. I think they even had a open casket shot of Bruce in the film. I think this is true because later when they show a scene with Hugh O'Brien destroying a clay head, the bangs were shorter than shown during the ""funeral"" footage, making me think they might have shown the real Bruce Lee's body in that quick shot. How tasteful of them.
4. The lame attempts to mask the fakes as the ""real"" Bruce Lee. The infamous scene with Hugh O'Brien, where they attach a cardboard photo of Bruce on the fakes head is too much. The sunglasses and the fact that the doubles looked like they were either smaller than Lee didn't help matters either.
5. The final showdown with the ""karate masters"". It was oblivious that some of these shots were trimmed or never finished, but they still show what Bruce Lee was all about. The fight with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was funny in a Sports Entertainment (Wrestling) kind of way.
6. Hugh O'Brien - karate master.
7. The final fake that passes more like Bruce than the rest of the fakes.

273524,2,6300250172,"This weekend I had the misfortune of watching this whole movie, the first time I'd watched it all in about 6 years. Like most people, usually I just watch the actual Bruce footage at the end, and skip everything in between. But my roommate and I were up for some punishment and sat through the movie. Here's some funny things I noticed that may help you get through your next viewing:
1. How smashed Gig Young is throughout the movie. The guy was obviously tanked on something during shooting. Notice his occasional slurring of lines, especially any scene in which he's on the telephone. Sadly, I read on the Internet Movie Database that Young killed himself in '78, as well as his wife. Notice that the year of his suicide was 1978, the same year GOD was released to the world...coincidence?
2. Dean Jagger. The poor man seems almost senile, like he's not very sure where he is. I love the way he screams his lines, especially when he yells ""Kill! CARL!!"" During the Bob Wall/Sammo fight. Even though he appears to be at death's door in this movie, Jagger amazingly lived another 13 years.
3. Speaking of Bob Wall, I love that expression on his face in the locker room fight, after the fake Bruce knocks him on his behind. Bob's mouth is hanging open and he blinks a couple of times in shock, looking like he's just had the greatest sexual experience of his life and it's blown his mind.
4. The thugs in this movie are even less threatening than those in Way of the Dragon (aka Return of the Dragon). That sounds impossible, doesn't it?
5. The stand-in for Kareem is also hilarious. The guy looks like he's barely over 6 feet.
6. Notice how that even though this is Hong Kong, every main character in the film save for the fake Bruce is a white American. White Americans controlling a crime ring in Hong Kong, white American staff reporters for Hong Kong papers, etc. Just like real life, huh?
7. The ineffectual assassin ""Stick."" Watch how he ""perfectly"" blends in with the extras and stagehands on the set of the Fist of Fury rip-off, in which the fake Bruce rushes the cameras and is shot (in the cheek?) by Stick. As if the people on the set wouldn't notice some sneaky-looking stranger with shifty eyes, dressed in the classic mafia get-up, carrying a revolver.
6. Four words: ""You lose, Carl Miller!""
It's a shame that Game of Death is so bad, especially considering that the final ten minutes, with the actual Bruce Lee in scenes that he shot for the REAL Game of Death, contain some of the best martial arts footage ever seen on film.  No one knows how much of Game of Death Bruce actually completed, however there is at least 30 minute's worth, all of which will be seen in the soon-to-be-released documentary Warrior's Journey.  So keep your eyes peeled for that: Game of Death looked like it would have been Bruce's best movie yet, so it will be great to finally see it in the way he intended it to be seen, and NOT full of cut-rate B actors and beard-wearing imposters.",984182400,2,2982,4.510166358595194

My favorite kind of music is classical so perhaps people with different tastes won't dig it very much but that's how I feel. In particular the title sequence and the fight with Robert Wall in the locker room are incredible. The later I think is the best martial arts fight sequence ever made. Pay special attention to the final ""execution scene"" and the accompaniment provided by the percussion. Is it the double who appears on that sequence ??? He looks very much like Bruce Lee.

How do I know this? Because my brother and I saw  ALL the fight scenes back in 1974.  Being so long ago, its hard to  remember exact details, but this much my brother and I remember...the final  fight had at least 6 floors of battle. Also, 2 other fighters went into the  building with Bruce, one of which you see lying dead on Kareems' floor.  Of the floors you don't see...the first floor was a room full of fighters,  probably around 15 guys. Another was a tae-kwon-do fighter. My personal  favourite was an old man who never stood up, but instead sat cross-legged,  hiding a weapon(a 3 section staff I believe) behind his back, hopping  around and lashing out with it, only to hide it again. My brother says he  remembers a sword fighter, but I can't recall him.  There were also a lot  of outdoor fight scenes shot, none of which is in this film.  As for whats  in this pathetic film, Bruce would never have allowed the blunder of  bonking himself on the head with the nanchuka when fighting Dan Inosanto.

However, guard yourself from cinematic agony. The story itself  is not in denial of a plot but is at times very distastefull. Note that the  original sequences filmed with Bruce pryor to his death are some of the  best scenes ever filmed, and include fight scenes which feature Chuck  Norris, Kareem Abdul Jabar (with whom Bruce experienced a true life  challenge, and is a fine example of his Martial Arts power and  versatility), and most notable is the encounter between Bruce Lee and Dan  Inosanto (an actual personal friend, and one of the most accomplished  students of Lee's fighting philosophy and technique). In all, the film  ""Game of Death"" is at best very awkward, and more directly, it is  a dis-respectfull compilation which exploits the talent and legacy of Bruce  Lee.

Production and filming  where halted for ""game of Death"" early on in the project and most  fortunately for his fans, some of Bruce Lee's fight scenes were filmed out  of sequence. Bruce stopped the production to film his most ambitious, and  possibly the greatest Martial Arts film ever produced, ""Enter the  Dragon"". Due to Bruce Lee's untimely death soon after, this meant that  ""Game of Death"" was unfulfilled and would later be completed with  a stand-in actor and without the benefit of Bruce Lee's power or abilities,  however what remained is final  tribute to his gift and abilities as a  Martial Arts Icon and legend.",952905600,3,2035,4.672316384180791

Calling it exploitative of Lee's death and legacy would be stretching it, seeing as Lee himself committed to the role (not like they slapped together footage of him, as with so many  other ""Bruce Lee clone"" movies and posthumous releases).  But in  terms of quality, this movie certain has some insurmountable  problems.
First, of course, the conspicuous absence of the hero from  about half the scenes.  Impossible problem to get around, but they  compounded it by using a dubbed voice and body doubles for pathetic  stand-in scenes.  I suspect it would have been much more feasible to simply  use what they had and write a new script around the footage.  Marks to  Colleen Camp (who appeared in Die Hard with a Vengeance 20 years later),  gamely playing a love interest without the lead around, and Bob Wall and  Samo Hung, who present a pretty nicely choreographed fight  scene.
Cinematically director Robert Clouse is no genius, but his shot  selection is considerably better than Lo Wei's and even Lee himself (Return  of the Dragon was directed by Lee and, despite tremendous fight  choreography, was poorly shot and acted).
The climactic showdowns in this  movie are overrated -- the nunchaku dual could have been staged much  tighter, and the use of those limp-looking, coloured weapons was a  mind-bogglingly tasteless choice.  Everytime the nunchaku strike flesh, you  could almost hear the ""splat"" of the soft-looking sticks hitting  a face.  The second fight (the white-robed master) is much better.  The  third fight was a huge letdown, the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar/Bruce Lee showdown  being heralded to the stars, but in fact a slow-moving, uninteresting,  unconvincing brawl.  Bruce Lee isn't known for his wrestling techniques  (fluidity being one of his principles), and in this fight he's relegated  mostly to grappling and gritting his teeth.

7807153,5,6300250172,"The best version of this movie out there. Better than any of the collection sets because Shout! Factory went back and did their own transfer that's nice and clean. Good special features, even some unreleased stuff.

For a video unboxing of the reverse cover art and review of its picture quality and features, please see my YouTube channel.",1509753600,,340,4.862068965517241
7807154,4,6300250172,"Most of footage was shot prior to Lees death, but then the film makers had to rewrite the script. Stunning action from the first scene. An entertaining film. Hard to believe it was his last.  The new script included actual footage from his funeral where a close-up of his embalmed face appeared in the film.
 Little Peacock as he is sometimes called, is certainly missed. For a martial arts film, this is top shelf.

7807157,1,6300250172,"I'm sure the new 4K HD transfer is fantastic. Shout! Factory does an amazing job on their remastered releases. But as a die-hard Bruce Lee fan and follower, I cannot endorse this movie whatsoever. This was produced and screened after Bruce died, only showing about 10 minutes of Bruce's actual footage near the end. The majority of the movie has a stand-in ""clone"" who looks, sounds, and acts nothing like Bruce Lee. If you truly want to experience Bruce Lee and the work he did before he died, try to find the out-of-print The Warrior's Journey on DVD. It will have everything you're looking for as far as Bruce's genuine and expanded footage and vision.",1493337600,,655,4.7043478260869565
