Overpowering. A true masterpiece. ""My Way"" is, in my view, one of the best movies about war ever, one that you will feel and live. Well Go USA brings us again another piece of Korean-Japanese history that desperately needed to be told, and it looks outstanding in its Blu-ray edition.

Helmed by Kang Je-Kyu, who was also responsible for ""Taegukgi: Brotherhood of War"" (2004), the film takes us to Korea, during the Japanese occupation of that country. We immediately meet Jung-shik Kim (Dong-gun Jang), whose father works for a high-ranked Japanese army officer, as well as Tatsuo Hasegawa (Jo Odagiri), grandchild of this officer, who comes to visit. Both Jung-shik and Tatsuo are very young, and they are excellent runners. Unfortunately, a tragedy happens which separates the families, and they never develop a friendship while growing up together. In addition, at the time, some, if not most, Japanese looked at Koreans as low-class people. Once they become adults - the year is 1938 --, Tatsuo, who is wealthy, is due to go to medical school (against his will; instead, he wants to become an army officer) and Jung-shik, who is poor, becomes a rickshaw driver. Tatsuo, too, is running at the Olympic Games, representing Korea, which infuriates the Korean population. As a result, Tatsuo and Jung-shik have to compete for the Olympic trials, with Jung-shik winning, but being cheated by government officials who wanted Tatsuo at any cost. But fate intervenes and Japan goes to war, with the Koreans forced to join the Japanese army as ""Imperial soldiers."" As expected, both Jung-shik and Tatsuo go to war, and their paths will be crossing over and over for the next years, leading us to a surprising, dramatic end.

""My Way"" is a story about redemption under the worst circumstances, and the battle scenes are as realistic as they can get, with amazing cinematography by Mo-Gae Lee and production design by Geun-hyun Cho. This is one grandiose production, also ignored by Hollywood. The Blu-ray includes a making-of feature, interviews with the director and Dong-gun Jang, and more. (South Korea, 2011, 143 min plus additional materials).

5109381,5,B007S0DB56,"Riveting.  Brutal.  Epic.  All of the above.  Director Kang Je-gyu sure knows how to make films that are heartbreaking.  Based on the true story of an Asian man found on the beaches at Normandy during World War II, somehow the main character ends up being forced to fight for the Japanese, the Russians, and the Germans over the course of the film.  There are at least five different languages spoken in this film: Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, and German.  And then the credits roll with a wonderful song from Italy's own Andrea Bocelli.  Truly a multinational picture.  Contains amazing scenery and a jaw-dropping, climactic recreation of the Normandy invasion.  Just don't watch it if you're squeamish.  Very, very graphic in places.

5109382,5,B007S0DB56,"***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT. If you want the movie to be a surprise do not read until you've watched, although I will not go deeply into the story or ending.***

Wow!

I just watched this movie after being terribly (and I mean TERRIBLY) disappointed with ""Red Tails""...

WOW....

What a superb movie. ""My Way"" has got to be one of the finest war movies of our time, and possibly all time.

For a movie that I just grabbed out of a Redbox, I'm probably going to buy it and add it to my collection of esteemed war movies.

""My Way"" is an amazing journey of grit, sorrow, and impeccable realism. I cannot remember seeing a war movie lately which was filmed with such splendor. It is gut-wrenching and inspiring all at once, and everything about the film just feels true and not forced.

The battle scenes are glorious. The movie seems to borrow from some other recent war movie scenes (such as the Normandy invasion in Saving Private Ryan, and some of the bitter Russian battles from Enemy at the Gates), but it does so in a way that feels both similar and genuine to the other films. Also, the battle of Normandy for example IS in the movie, so it should follow suit with the setting created in Saving Private Ryan. The special effects are superb and not horribly overdone by excessive CGI, which seems to plague many modern films these days. I really felt like I was in the battles, and I watched the movie on my laptop with some cheap headphones. I can't wait to get the dvd home and put it on my surround sound (sorry neighbors).

There is so much sadness in the film, however. Of course, this movie was intended to be miserable, as it depicts some of the most brutal atrocities of World War II. Talk about a world really at war. Europe and the far East are huge battle zones, and this movie will have you racing through the heart of it. This movie will place you in the horrible realities of what it was like for those unlucky men and women, and isn't that the point of a war movie?

I give ""My Way"" five stars without a doubt, for splendid cinematography, an interesting plot that wasn't overbearing, and terrific actors who convey the nicely written script.",1343174400,6,2159,4.445569620253164
5109383,4,B007S0DB56,"A epic production about two friends who grow up together ,but a horrible tragedy while they were young tore them apart, the acting in this film was very compelling ,the meat of the film is the spectacular war scenes , very realistic and harsh, there are few similarities with this film and the film ""the brotherhood of war"" which came a few years prior to this one ,both films told a very human story around the brutal reality of war.

5109388,4,B007S0DB56,"First off, the acting was superb. It is a complicated story that starts prior to WWII. There are many small details that enhanced the story but are too many to enumerate. You just have to watch and pay attention. Throughout, the contempt of Japanese for Koreans is strongly portrayed. The story starts in Japanese occupied Korea with two boys, one Korean, Jun-Shik, and one Japanese, Tatsuo, who start out as friends. As they grow older, they become competitors in the Marathon. This comes to a head when Jun-Shik beats Tatsuo (and all contestants) in try outs for the Olympics despite an attempt by a the Japanese to, first, prevent any Koreas from participating, and, second, by having one of the Japanese contestants try to trip Jun-Shik as he is close to the finish line. After Jun-Shik wins anywaty, the officials play a switcheroo by accusing Jun-Shik of tripping the other contestant. They disqualify him which starts a riot. Jun-Shik (who did not join in the rioting) and his friends are arrested and punished by being forced into the Japanese army. Now they are in Manchuria fighting the Russians and enduring abuses from their Japanese superiors. Eventually, Tatsuo arrives to take command of the unit. Tatsuo treats Jun-Shik with contempt while the later freely engages in defiance (and endures the punishment). Eventually both become Russian prisoners and are sent to a Gulag where they and other POWs are treated harshly while serving as slave labor. When Germany invades the USSR, they are impressed into the Soviet army where they are used as canon-fodder. For Tatsuo, he sees in the brutal acts of the Soviet political officers a reflection of himself. He begins to understand how cruel he had treated the Koreans, in particular, his childhood friend. After the slaughter, both men are alone and wounded. They decide to head for German lines in hopes of escaping the Russians. Their initial contact with the Germans is not pleasant but they both eventually end up in the German army as part of the Eastern battalion in Normandy. They become friends. Since they both just want to get home, they plan on desertion but the Allied invasion interrupts their plans. I won't spoil things from here. I would have loved to rate this movie higher but the battle sequences were lacking in reality. I loved the portrayal of Soviet BT tanks but they were portrayed in a silly fashion. In BTs the commander was also the gunner. To have them standing up out of their hatches firing  MGs (not realistic in of itself) while the canon were likewise firing was absurd. They also drive their tanks into the Japanese masses rather than standing off and firing (it is difficult to bring tank weapons to bear on close-in infantry). The scenes of Japanese officers likewise leaping upon the BTs killing tank commander after tank commander with their katanas was also absurd. Skipping over to Normandy, the weather was much too nice for the invasion. It also portrayed ships firing on the beaches even after the troops had landed and showed paratroopers landing in broad daylight immediately behind the beaches. At any rate, the story is the important element and it is well told and well acted.",1510531200,,3186,4.88909426987061

I bought the blue ray version the picture and sound quality are excellent the blu ray comes with both the original language with subtitles and the English dub I highly recommend using the original language with subtitles the English dub really ruins the movie watch the movie the way it was made to really appreciate the acting and storyline so many high quality movies have come out of Korea and my way is no exception

5109409,5,B007S0DB56,"This is probably one of the best movies I've seen, period.  It might even be the best war movie. Most war movies focus on a single platoon/unit of American soldiers fighting against one enemy.  This movie is different. Seeing WWII from so many angles from the eyes of a few characters is really eye-opening.  The human side of this film is just as good as Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket.

People who don't like this movie knock it mainly for not being historically accurate. I really couldn't care less. Everyone knows that ""based on a true story"" usually means ""fiction"". This isn't a war documentary film.

Critics generally don't like this movie for the usual stupid reasons, i.e. bad cinematography, bad editing, bad soundtrack, etc. They need to realize that the average movie viewer doesn't pay attention to trivial things such as these.

I won't blow any of details of the plot. I'll just say that if you want to see WWII in a different way, this movie is for you.",1498608000,,981,4.641618497109826

5109451,4,B007S0DB56,"Its not easy to describe ""My Way"" a story based on 'true events' which means you have to figure out which events are true--and which were added or fabricated I guess. Yang Kyoungjong was a real Korean soldier in the German Army captured on D-Day by American Paratroopers. The film begins in Korea, occupied by the Japanese for several years before & during WWII. The story follows the relationship between two men, a Korean & a Japanese boy who are competitors for Japans Olympic Marathon Team. Let me say right here that the running scenes in this film aren't particularly well done--the competitors look more like they are 'jogging' as in 10 min miles, versus 5 min miles which is more realistic but the running story isn't even 'necessary in this film--its a War movie. The Yang gets conscripted into the Japanese Army where he is sent to the Mongolian Border to battle the Russians in 1939. It just so happens his Commanding Officer, is his Japanese counterpart from the Marathon Trials and he is a brutal, sadistic leader of his men. At this point the film begins to shine because without a doubt, the battle scenes in this film are SUPERB; graphic, intense, heroic, truly as amazing as anything in Saving Private Ryan. The Russians prevail and our 2 main characters are captured & sent to a POW Camp deep inside the USSR with more amazing scenes of the Korean & Japanese POW's now 'united' somewhat against the Communists. When the Germans invade Russia, the POW's are given a choice; fight for the Russians or be executed on the spot. Our Yang & his Japanese nemesis are thrown into the battle of Dedovsk and the battle with the Germans is astonishing. Somehow, the 2 men survive the battle & then decide to escape their Russian captors and head towards the German lines with the hope of getting back home. They wind up getting separated after finding the Germans, and eventually are conscripted into the Eastern Battalion stationed at Normandy Beach. They find each other after 3 yrs apart both serving in the Wehrmacht building defenses for the inevitable attack by the Allies. Over time our 2 characters have gone from bitter enemies & rivals, to survivors & friends.

The climax of this film comes on D-Day with our 2 characters serving in the German Army and plotting a way to escape Normandy and get back to Korea. What takes place next is probably the finest battle/set piece I've ever seen showing the D-Day invasion from the German perspective. I won't write any spoilers here about what happens at Normandy, but the film ends with the 1948 Olympic Marathon (again, not very well done) which isn't part of the incredible true story of Yang Kyoungjong as far as I know . In my view the 'running story' was maybe added as a 'device' to fill out the character development between Yang & his Japanese friend which is just unnecessary. In summary, this is an amazing War movie with a title that gives no indication of what your about to see (its not the autobiography of Frank Sinatra) & some running scenes that add nothing to the story.",1462060800,12,3049,4.677839851024209

Based on actual events can (and in this instance does) mean something very different than true. I also have some of the same issues with Enemy at the Gates and other well-done movies that alter history to sell  more tickets (don't get me started on Pearl Harbor). I'll let people do their own research and make their own decisions about where entertainment trumped realism. And this movie is entertaining, the special effects are respectable but hardly at the Spielberg level, of course who can afford that? The acting is decent as well but not in the running for foreign language Oscars.

I will be looking into this event - that an Asian man in German uniform was taken prisoner during our massive campaign that obliterated the enemy - I need to know more - but will say no more in this review.

5109519,4,B007S0DB56,I would have given this 5 stars but the idea of a Korean boy and a Japanese boy bonding and finding out that the weird bonding lasted to the end of the movie is strange. Korean's were treated so bad like on the order of how Hitler treated the Jews and from what I have read worse. The soldier Yang Kyoungjong who's story was told and you can use this name and Wikpedia will bring up his picture. The US 101st airborne captured Yang and 3 other. Lucky Yang was sent back to the US and ended up living his life in Illinois till his passing in 1992. Many Koreans wanted to return home but those forced in the Soviet army were sent back to the Soviets when the war ended and what's strange is that the US exchanged the Koreans serving in the German army with US prisoners. What is strange is that the Soviets were on our side. I did feel sad to see these Koreans who were forced to fight for Japan and then forced to fight for the Soviets. And as you watch the movie they looked happier working for the Germans in fortifying the shores of Normandy. The movie could have been researched more. Like they were captured in the Third battle of Kharkov in the Ukraine in 1943 and that no Japanese were mentioned serving in the German army.  There is a lot more that could be done and maybe a second movie about Korean friends clinging together to survive. Oh well  I would still recommend the movie like most movies today it gets a little bloody and war is nothing pretty. I do believe more people should see the horrors of war to enlighten people to want to protect people.,1413158400,,1564,4.262626262626263

My Way uses this weird true story to kick off a terrific film fictionalized to show how two rival marathon runners, Japanese & Korean,  ending up fighting for Germany on D-Day. The war scenes are spectacular as the two battle the Red army, escape prison in the icy Siberian forest, end up under our bombs and battleship barrages in Normandy. This is a polished production you would not see from an American producer because it is too long and too lavish a show.

5109544,2,B007S0DB56,"Long time Amazon buyer, first time reviewer, or maybe second review.

It is visually, and aurally epic, but it is not a great example of Korean cinema. It is a Hollywood film in the sense of stirring emotion for the sake of stirring emotion. Overly long without spending enough time to develop characters during the many (too many) different stages of this film.

Implausible story development and non-sensical decision making from the characters make it too hard to identify with the two leads. The development of the friendship from strong enemies to best of friends is truly unbelievable and pure escapism, it took me out of the story.

All the boxes are ticked for epic scenes, climbing snow capped mountains, diving on bombs, kamikaze tank bombers, friends turning on friends, friends betraying friends and enemies befriending enemies to save their enemies from the friends that betrayed them, list goes on... oh dear.

Cinematography is nice though, there are some decent scenes during the war sequences that bring you right up into the action in some nice POV footage.

5109562,3,B007S0DB56,"First a comment about the title - and the pit-falls of translation. ""My Way"" is indeed the literal translation of the title in the Korean language. Unfortunately, to most Westerners, certainly to most Americans, this evokes Frank Sinatra's song ""My Way"", in which he sings about how he got to live his life the way he had wanted to. But this story is about the lives - the way - of two men who in fact were never given the chance to live their lives the way they wanted to, but were marched in lock-step to their fate, which was in many ways the exact opposite of what they would have chosen if they had had a choice.
For a Westerner this film is an excellent educational film in Korean history of the first half of the 20th Century and I would be happy to recommend it to any history professor as course material. It is also a very interesting film if one wants to see an example of ""truth that is stranger than fiction"" (while the film is not actually a true story, its basis is a real fact - a Korean man who, fighting as a soldier in the German Army, was captured by the US Army during the invasion of Normandy).
It is however clearly made with a Korean (and possibly, Japanese) audience (who know little about European History) in mind and contains some amazing lapses (the invasion of Normandy took place in 1944, not 1945... the ""London"" that the first marathon scene was filmed in, is interesting too, the city shown is indeed in Europe, but a long way from England...), however this does not detract from the fascination of the story.
Finally, since one of the other reviewers commented on the ""spectacular"" battle scenes, I, as a former military person, have to say that unfortunately, to me, was the weakest part of the film. Granted, the battles were spectacular - CGI - alright, but I would have to describe them as cartoon ""explanations"" of what happened. Then again, to non-military viewers, that is perhaps all for the best.
The battle of Nomonhan was indeed won by the Russians because the Red Army overran the Japanese forces using masses of tanks, which the Japanese were forced to fight against by strapping suicide vests to their soldiers because they lacked adequate numbers of tanks and anti-tank guns themselves. However, the battle did not consist of lines of Soviet tanks advancing hub-cap to hub-cap with no infantry support against a Japanese force whose formation I can only describe as an 18th Century infantry square. The later battles, the Red Army v.s. the Germans and finally the Allied (only US are shown) attack on the Normandy coast are similarly caricatures of what really happened.
It is for this reason that I only give the film three stars, the story deserves all five.
The film is of course sub-titled, the action takes place in at least 5 languages (Korean, Japanese, Russian, German, English, Chinese may be in there too) and keeping the speakers separate is a pre-requisite to understanding what is going on. The sub-titles were adequate to clearly understand what is happening and why (the issue with the title not withstanding). Picture quality was fine... etc.",1379808000,11,3108,4.683729433272394

The production qualities are high and with the exception of the first 20 minutes it moves at a good pace. The viewpoints in the movie are very different to that put forward by the US film companies. In order to more enjoy the movie I believe it is necessary to accept the alternate views. I find it interesting that the US film critics panned this movie, yet Saving Private Ryan gets accolades and wins an Academy Award. It maybe that this inability to accept other views could be the reason.

Instead of making a movie about the real fantastic events which saw these men serve in the Japanese army, then the Soviet army, then the German army (which is an extraordinary tale), the film makers invented a Disney-like tale about two rival marathon runners and fabricated an entire story to go with it.

5109578,5,B007S0DB56,"I liked this powerful and original South Korean film and I am happy that I bought it - in fact, even if it has some small weaknesses, I liked it more than the renowned ""Brotherhood"". Below, you will find some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This is a work of fiction, but it is remotely based on a true story. During the battle of Normandy in June-August 1944 allied armies captured in France numerous soldiers from so called Osttruppen of Wehrmacht. Those units were composed of conscripts and volunteers from occupied territories in Soviet Union and also from volunteers recruited amongst Soviet prisoners of war. A total of at least 98 Ost battallions were raised (that total doesn't include neither the Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Belarussian, Cossack and Ukrainian formations nor the early Russian ""Hiwi"" volunteers and the later created Russian Vlassov Army).

Amongst those captured were at least four Asians from Far East with whom nobody was able to communicate, as they only knew a couple of words in German. One of those men was Yang Kyoungjong, a young Korean who, as his country was under Japanese occupation, was forced in 1938 to serve in Japanese Army. He was then taken prisoner by Soviets during the bloody - and quite important for world history - war waged by Soviet Union and its Mongol vassal against Japan and its own Manchukuo puppet state between 11 May and 16 September 1939 (this war is known as Nomonhan Campaign in Japan and in West and as Khalkhyn Gol Battle in Russia).

As all Japanese, Korean and Manchu prisoners he was send to a concentration camp in Siberia where he managed to survive the hard labor and all kinds of privations until autumn 1942. He was then, as hundreds of thousands other inmates of all nationalities, pressed in service in Soviet Army and send to fight against Wehrmacht. In March 1943 he was again captured (possibly after deserting), this time by Germans, during the Third Battle of Kharkov (last major German victory on Eastern Front during WWII). He was then again pressed in armed service, this time in one of battalions of Osttruppen. Once formed, his unit was ultimately not send to fight against Soviets, but to garrison the Atlantic Wall in Normandy. It was there than he was captured for the third time, by US Army - once identified as Korean he was not send back to Soviet Union after war but allowed to imigrate to United States, where he lived peacefully until his death in 1992.

Now this film DOESN'T tell Yang Kyoungjong story. The main hero of this film is named Kim Jun-shik and his story, although inspired by the one described above, is also GREATLY DIFFERENT in many aspects. But of this I will say no more - you will have to discover it your self.

This is a very powerful, brutal, bloody, dramatic and cruel story. At a risk of being taken for a male shauvinist pig, I would even risk here an opinion that this is really a film for men, to watch amongst guys, with some good beer (but NOT popcorn - this is not this kind of movie) and rather in silence, both to fully enjoy it and to show some respect for all human misery and suffering pictured...

Now, granted, this film has some small weaknesses, which actually made me smile by moments (but briefly). To cite some of them, let's just say that no matter how good a shot a soldier is, it was never possible to INSTANTLY destroy a Polikarpov I-16 fighter (quite well made CGI by the way) with ONE single rifle-shot...))) Also, at Nomonhan battle, Soviet tanks ALWAYS charge without any infantry present, when in reality Soviet ""tank-riders"" (infantrymen riding on tanks) were a great Red Army speciality.

But possibly the funniest moment is during one of battles on Eastern front. Probably just to make things clearer for the Asian viewer director decided to decorate German positions in a ruined town by a great number of absolutely ENORMOUS Nazi flags, the kind of which were used during those massive Nazi ""Reichsparteitags"", like the one filmed by Leni Riefenstahl in 1934 in Nuremberg. OK, it is not really a deadly sin, but it made this otherwise horrible battle scene unwillingly very funny.

There is also one moment when in 1943 the hero wanders through a frozen desolation, after his Soviet unit was destroyed. Well, he travels through some incredibly gigantic mountains - which are notoriously absent from Russian, Belarussian and Ukrainian flatlands...))) The only mountainous places in Soviet Union which were concerned by the fighting during World War II were the Caucasus, which Germans had to evacuate at the end of 1942 as well as Crimea and Carpathian mountains, which both were reached by Soviet Army only in summer 1944...

Finally, it was real fun to see Iowa-class battleships shelling Normandy in 1944 considering that all four were in this time fighting in the Pacific (but the footage of those ships firing broadsides is freely available in public domain...) as well as seeing hundreds of B-17s bombing in full day from such a low attitude, that they could be engaged not only by light 20 mm Flak pieces, but even by machine gun and RIFLE(!) fire. Such a thing NEVER happened in Normandy as 1) there was never need for such an action and 2) the losses thus suffered would be crippling - as it was well shown in ONE such event, in 1943, during the (in)famous Ploesti raid, when American B-24 Liberators had to bomb a target in Romania completely surrounded by high hills and therefore exposed themselves to full firepower of EVERYTHING (including not only the 20 mm Flak guns but even MG08 and MG34 7,92 mm machine guns) that could shoot at them from the summits of hills...

But all those things are very minor points, noticable only for military history freaks like me and my kind. This film is an excellent, brilliant, very moving and beautifully filmed thing, with actors giving everything they had in them and what they could borrow. I liked this film very much and I am going to keep it preciously for a possible future viewing. Warmly recommended, albeit mostly for male public. I can not really wish you to enjoy it, as it is a very brutal and violent thing - but I think you will not regret buying and watching it!",1369094400,,6204,4.7255083179297594

5109584,5,B007S0DB56,"The movie is based on true events.  This is a correct statement.

The battle scenes depicted throughout this movie appear to involve many of the military units actually involved in the fighting in the noted time periods.  The uniforms, weapons, tanks and unit actions seem to be authentic enough to be believed by the viewer.  The storyline of a friendship between two marathoners and the continued running practiced by the Korean man, though a bit of a stretch considering some of the circumstances that befell them, is a nice touch and adds warmth to a bad situation, and adds to the value of the advice given to him, ""Never give up!"" The action is continuous without any real downtime.  I highly recommend this film.",1365811200,2,1128,4.823834196891192

5109591,5,B007S0DB56,"Most Powerful Intense Action Film I have seen recently! Explains How a Korean in German Uniform was Captured  on D-Day by US forces!
 My Way (Hangul:  ; RR: Mai Wei) is a 2011 South Korean war film, co-written and directed by Kang Je-gyu which stars Korean actor Jang Dong-gun along with Japanese actor Joe Odagiri and Chinese actress Fan Bingbing. This film is inspired by the true story and documentary of a Korean named Yang Kyoungjong who was captured by the Americans on D-Day. Yang Kyoungjong was forcibly conscripted in the Japanese Imperial Army, the Soviet Red Army and the German Wehrmacht. Soundtrack by Andrea Bocelli - To Find My Way.
In multiple languages, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, than German with English subtitles, not much plot but with lotsa Action and Suspense so don't let that put you off from seeing it. more than two hours of savage, bloody CGI-enhanced combat, with explosions galore and a body count seldom seen on the big screen.(ala Saving Private Ryan) Everything looks terrific -- which is to be expected from the movie with the largest budget ($25 million) and Korea's largest production ever made and inspired by a true story. More than two hours and 57,500 fired-bullets long, according to press material, My Way is an epic eye-popping, Second World War movie through two theatres of war and 3 battlefields with four different armies.  Early in the film an evil Japanese commander tortures Korean recruits with a taunt from the Monty Python Ministry of Silly Ethnic Slurs: ""Kimchi-breath!"" Kimchi-breath? Well, you know how the Koreans like their soaked vegetables.
My Way is drawn from a real-life incident: a 1944 photo of a captured Korean soldier wearing a Nazi uniform after D-Day. How did he get there?
According to South Korean filmmaker Kang Je-gyu ( Shiri, Taegukgi(Brothers of War), what might have happened was a village feud got all out of control. A great marathoner, Tatsuo Hasegawa (J ""Joe"" Odagiri) is the grandson of a Japanese Colonel stationed in Korea. Tatsuo's only sporting rival, ironically, is his equally proud Korean servant, the splendidly athletic Kim Jun-shik (South Korean superstar, Jan Dong-gun).
The boys race to represent Korea in the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. The film starts with them racing as little boys from the moment they meet but by the time they are teenagers (Do Ji-han, Kobayashi Yukichi), they have become fierce competitors, the rivalry reaching a head when imperial higher-ups strip Jun-shik of his rightful Olympic qualification after beating Tatsuo starting a riot . As punishment the Korean rioters are consctripted into the Japanese army. A couple of years later, in 1939, they both find themselves at the Mongolian border--Tatsuo as a evil/sadistic colonel and Jun-shik  who takes a stand when Tatsu sends 50 Koreans on a suicide mission to destroy Soviet tanks. When Tatsuo orders Jun-shik's execution, the latter simply runs away, the first of many last-minute escapes from certain death managed by the two fleet-of-foot main characters. While escaping, Jun-shik, seeing Russian tanks on the horizon, attempts to return to base to warn the Japanese forces. During his return, he is attacked by a Soviet fighter-plane and is saved by Shirai(Fan BingBing), a sniper Jun-shik captured earlier after she killed all the Japanese in his squad but who he later freed, but she dies after shooting down the plane with just one shot. Jun-shik returns to the base and manages to warn the Japanese forces that a large-scale Soviet tank attack is coming but Tatsuo refuses to order a retreat. Each CGI-enhanced battle scene (Kang appears to have a Michael Bay-ish fondness for showing combat vehicles massed in formation) effects a realignment of the Jun-shik/ Tatsuo dynamic. As they meet again in a freezing icey Soviet Gulag and then later as Nazi soldiers at sunny Normandy Beach, bad blood gives way to a deepening mutual reliance and respect helping Tatsu change from finding redemption.",1363132800,,3979,5.096625766871166

Than the Korean boy is conscripted unwillingly into the Imperial Army; and there he finds his competitive companion as a ruthless Japanese officer.  The rest of the story has to do with their experiences during the war, until they each find themselves fighting for The Third Reich.

He was 1 of 4 Asians in German uniforms that were taken prisoners by the US paratroopers that day.

5109605,5,B007S0DB56,"In Korea, it's common to watch the large scale epics, may it be an action drama of traditional Korea to the tensions of South and North Korea.  But in 2011, filmmaker and writer Kang Je-Kyu (""Shiri"", ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"", ""Gameui Beobjig"") began to work on his latest big budget film ""My Way"".

A film inspired by the photo and story of Kyoungjong Yang, captured by Americans in Normandy in 1944 during World War II, the Korean soldier was found dressed in a German uniform, but what surprised people is that he served for the Imperial Japanese Army, the Russian and German military.  How is this possible?  How would have life been for Yang?

So, Kang Je-Kyu would go to work on what would become one of the most expensive Korean film of all time.  Not only would it star Korea's Jang Dong-gun (""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"", ""The Promise"", ""The Coast Guard"") but it would also star Japanese star Jo Odagiri (""Shinobi: Heart Under Blade"", ""Bright Future"", ""Tokyo Tower: Mom and Me, and Sometimes Dad"") and Chinese star Bingbing Fan (""Battle of the Warriors"", ""Flash Point"", ""Shaolin"").

The scope of the war would lead the characters beginning with Japanese-occupied Korea, the Mongolian border, the Soviet Union, Germany and Normandy, France.  And because of the film's budget and wider focus, the battle scenes are more detailed, more vast (and suffice to say, looking more expensive) than any Korean film ever made.

VIDEO:

""My Way"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray.  From the opening scenes of showcasing Jun-shik Kim, you can see the detail of the grime on his face but then go forward to the more war scenes or the characters in the frozen train ride to Russia, there is a lot of detail featured in those scenes.  The intense action sequences are just chaotic, scenes of war is amazingly detailed from its look of despair, violence, bloody carnage to explosions galore, I was quite impressed by the look of this film in HD.

Amazing detail, colors vary from warm to cool depending on the area, but when the characters arrive in Normandy, colors are much more vibrant thanks to the change of scenery.  Black levels are nice and deep and I saw no artifacts or any more issues while watching the film.

""My Way"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""My Way"" is presented in Korean 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Korean Dolby Digital Stereo, Also in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and English Dolby Digital Stereo.  While I don't listen to English dub tracks for Asian cinema, it's good to know that people who can't watch films with English subtitles, do have that option with this Blu-ray release.

As one would expect from a war film, this is an immersive lossless soundtrack.  From bullets shooting all around you, hearing tanks rummaging and crunching its way through barriers, overhead planes attacking and spraying bullets to bombs being dropped and many scenes of many structures blowing up, the surround channels are utilized as with the LFE for the low frequency booms.  The lossless soundtrack is amazing!

English subtitles are included and easy to read!

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have watched many Korean war films and ""My Way"" is no doubt, the most ambitious film to come out of Korea and one of the best war films to come from Korea.

Inspired by a photo of a Korean soldier in a German uniform, anyone who has seen the photo before has asked themselves, how is it possible?  While the story of ""My Way"" was inspired by the photo, it is not a story about the soldier but a story about how Korea was during the time of Japanese rule.

There will always be this lingering dispute between both countries.  And as their have been amazing progress politically and thanks to Korean entertainment permeating worldwide and both countries working with each other in many ways, while a Korean film that focuses on a Korean and Japanese superstar with Jang Dong-gun and Jo Odagiri, this film is not about this country being better than each other.

It's about two people who grew up with each other, circumstances led them to hate each other, nearly kill each other (multiple times) but during the War and both being away from their countries, their government and facing so much tragedy in their lifetime, the two become each other's greatest hope.

And what's amazing about the film is how it captures humanity, the best and worst of it.  We see these men put into dire moments, fighting a losing battle against the Russians, being captured and forced to labor by the Russians and then serving in the Russian military to later be captured and forced to be part of the German military.

It sounds so farfetched but because of historical records and the photo taken at Normandy by American soldiers, we know that it happened.

But most importantly, what I liked about this film is that director and writer Kang Je-kyu didn't follow traditional Korean screenwriting.  Where most Asian films would always try to show a man fighting for his country against the savage Japanese Imperial Army, this film focuses on the humanity of two people who grew up with each other and somehow, would become important in each other's lives despite their differences.  The way the film ends was brilliant, touching and very ambitious, and typically when you use the word ambitious, most often these epic films tend to fail.  Not the case with ""My Way"", this film direction and screenplay was brilliant and easily accessible for viewers worldwide.

Outside of Jang Dong-gun and Jo Odagiri, the film also stars Chinese superstar Bingbing Fan.  Fans's involvement is more or less to showcase how China and the women were victimized by the Japanese Imperial army but instead of showing a weak female character, Fan's character, Shirai, is an expert sniper.  And while her character is not utilized a lot through the film, she plays an important part of bringing back humanity and caring for one another, specifically for the character of Jun-shik Kim.

It helps to bring realism by hiring Russian and German talent in the film and the film's efficacy also lies within its location shots, the cinematography and also research that went into weapons and tanks used during that era.

The visual effects and the sense of all out chaos during war was well-executed and cinematographer Lee Mo-gae and editor Park Gok-ji is impressive throughout the film!  Aside from the Josh Groban-style ending theme, I enjoyed the film from beginning to end!

The duration of the film is 143 minutes but not as bad as other war films that have gone near 3-4 hours.  In fact, because of the action and its captivating storyline, the film went rather quickly for me.

As for the Blu-ray release, the picture and audio quality is fantastic!  This is probably the best looking Well Go USA Blu-ray I have seen so far and watching this film in HD really showcases a lot of detail and clarity and and the film's lossless soundtrack is quite immersive.  I wished there were longer special features but you do get two short ones and three trailers, so of the entire release, it's low point it is short on special features.

But still, with an amazing film with awesome picture quality and lossless audio, it's hard to anything bad about this release!

Overall, ""My Way"" is a must-see Korean film that captures the human spirit, to never give up hope and that even amidst the chaos of war, hope continues to thrive and persist.  Another amazing film directed and written by filmmaker Kang Je-kyu and wonderfully acted by Jang Dong-gun and Jo Odagiri. ""My Way"" on a Blu-ray is a must-own release for fans of Asian cinema.

I watched the Blu ray DVD of this movie and as mentioned by other reviewers, the graphics are stunning.  Perhaps what disappointed me most was that in comparison to the other films mentioned above, although I am not a detailed expert on exact events in WWII, this movie may not have depicted certain historical events correctly.  For example, I believe the paratroopers landed in Normandy at night, whereas the movie depicts them landing in broad daylight during the final capture.  Thus, what left me short of placing this movie in the highest category of those listed above was the almost unbelievable saga of super human survival although it is supposed to be based on a true story.",1353542400,,859,4.783783783783784

5109614,5,B007S0DB56,"This is the sort of film the word `epic' was coined for. It is a Korean World War II film that takes in China, Russia and Europe as its scenes for some really well done battles. It is based on `true events', and I suspected a lot of licence has been taken but have since found out that this is based on the life of a Korean captured by the Americans on D Day in a Wermacht uniform - Yang Kyougjong.
The film is the story of two men Jun-Shik (Dong-gun Jang `Brotherhood') and Tassuo  (jo Odagiri - `Shinobi'), the former is Korean and the latter Japanese. They are both keen runners and an early rivalry starts between them as children when Tatsuo's family move to the now conquered Korea to bring the Imperial Army jackboot down on the populace. An enmity soon grows between the two which is worsened by Japans decision to not allow Koreans to do the try outs for the Olympics.

As a result of the ensuing unrest many Koreans and press ganged or sentenced to fight in the Imperial Army, this happens to Jun-Shik and many of his friends, they are sent to China to further the war that has been raging there since 1937.  They have to face Russian tanks with swords drawn and strap bombs to themselves as suicide attacks and it all kicks off. Hopelessly out numbered and out gunned they are taken prisoners of the Russians. This now begins the story of bitter struggle in the camps and the ensuing journey across Europe. To say any more would be a plot spoiler, but having said that there is rather a lot of plot so please don't think I have revealed too much already.

There are some great battle scenes and the action is all excellent as is the period detail and the languages are all authentic too, including Korean, Japanese, Mandarin, German and English; so this is obviously sub titled. There is rather a lot of CGI and it is all on the above average side, but considering the scope and ambition of this film, they could not have done it any other way.

This is from `Brotherhood' director Kang Je - Kyu who has taken seven years off but made this in ten months, I just hope he doesn't need such a break this time. For location fans this was actually shot in Latvia, but I did not feel this lacked authenticity. Whilst this is unashamedly emotional as most Korean cinema is, it is still brimming with action and no on screen time is wasted, it is an edge of seat marathon with a run time of 2 hours and eighteen minutes, you get a 40 minute `making of' as an extra too. If you are a fan of the ever growing catalogue of Korean action films, then this is one you will want to add to your collection - unmissable.",1348790400,19,2614,4.315682281059063
5109615,2,B007S0DB56,"""My Way"" is another epic blockbuster by director Kang Jae-gyu which focuses on the relationship between two men of colliding cultures in a hotbed of war and national grudges.  Kim Jun-shik, played by Jang Dong-gun, challenges his new childhood friend, Tatsuo, played by Joe Odagiri, to a race.  They meet during the controversial and repressive era in which the Empire of Japan occupied Korea for a few decades (1910-1945).  The premise of the story, it seems, builds on this foundation for their joy for long-distance races and their rivalry.  After a positive, feel-good montage showing them going back and forth winning races, the climax comes when Tatsuo controversially wins a major race based on allegations that Jun-shik cheated. A riot ensues, started by the Koreans, and Jun-shik and some friends end up forcibly drafted into the Imperial Japanese army as punishment.  Tatsuo enters the story again as a military colonel, who then runs into his old rival in the same unit.  As the movie carries into several changes of scenery based on the shifts of battle lines, Tatsuo and Jun-shik come to an understanding of friendship and survival, which even brings them across the fields of Europe to the Western Front of WWII.

Again, the idea for the movie about racing comes across as heart-warming, but the execution of the film is at times very messy and the pacing of the story, especially the angst of conflict between certain characters, can be overwhelming and unnecessary.  I felt like I couldn't get a grasp of what storyline the director wanted me to follow:  the marathons, the war, or the grudges between Tatsuo and Jun-shik that turns into a surprising friendship.  Kang Jae-gyu definitely brings back his forte and pallet of directorial skills from his earlier hit Korean War movie, Taegukgi, while trying to keep the sentimental value rolled in.  The war scenes are well done, done with a sense of chaos and well-placed shots, and this time the audience doesn't get a 'pro-(insert nation)' feeling, its just random battles with soldiers dying in a senseless manner.  Yet one of the major flaws of this film is that the director focuses so much on the battles that characterization and plot are left to be desired.  There is a large chunk of the film in which it is dedicated to straight up violence and personal conflict.  There are several consecutive scenes of fist-fights and brawls between certain characters at random times, which becomes annoying because you get this ""I've seen this before.""  Even more randomly, a female character is inserted, and you're left wondering is that Jun-shik's love interest?  You're not quite sure.

Then, out of the blue, there are shots of Jun-shik racing around an army or prison camp.  ""Ooops,"" it feels like the director wanted to remind you that he's a marathoner, ""don't forget that folks.""  Its like the director is playing catch-up with elements he forgot to add in.

War films can be tricky to direct because there has to be a fine balance of understanding the motivations of your main players while showing the chaos of war.  Director Kang shifts to highly choreographed war scenes which you come to watch a long war re-enactment.  There are death scenes that are stereotypical where the characters spurt out a heroic dialog with blood spewing everywhere, and the brawls occur over, and over, and over again.  In comparison, a film like ""The Frontline"" (with Ko Soo and Shin Ha-kyun), balance well the senselessness of war while making you attached to the characters.

In the end, the only positives of the film is that you do get a sense of the historical grudge between the Japanese and Koreans during this era and the war is portrayed very well.  But the story catches up way too late to make the whole premise, of racing and friendship through battles, to make it a fine finish.  Two stars.",1348617600,2,3858,4.878834355828221
5109616,5,B007S0DB56,"My Way is a war film by the phenomenal director Kang Je-gyu. The story follows rival marathon runners Jun-Shik, Korean, and Tatsuo, Japanese, from their heated races as kids and young men to the chaotic battles of World War 2; they learn a lot about themselves and each other as they fight for the Japanese Army and become prisoners of war. The story is a lot deeper, but for the sake of keeping this short and sweet, and to avoid spoilers, I'll leave it at that.

As I previously stated, My Way focuses on two main characters and develops them and their relationship with great detail. The main actors and the supporting cast were amazing in this film; you can really feel their pain as you hear their agonizing cries and witness their pleas to stay alive, especially in the Prisoner of War camps. The story is deep and works very well. The war sequences are also stunning; there are very large scale battles, including suicide bombings to stop tanks and an epic battle at Normandy. These battles are also very violent and realistic, a lot of stabbings and soldiers graphically get ran over by tanks. The action and drama are balanced, so it's not one big action film. Also, I thought the music was amazing and had a triumphant/epic feel; it matches the film perfectly. It's also shot beautifully. The ending was unexpected and very powerful. The story is inspired by a true story that I've never heard or seen, so it was also very informative.

My Way perfectly blends action and drama to create an amazing war film. With brilliant acting, superb music, amazing direction, and a stunning depiction of war, this film is highly recommended. As of 9/22/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is highly recommended as well.

This film has very strong violence and gore, including intense war sequences. No sex or nudity.",1348272000,,1843,4.717391304347826

5109618,5,B007S0DB56,"I can not describe the moment of excitement when I found this movie in a supermarket in Massachusetts! I immediately recognized that this movie was a story I've known since childhood: An incredible journey of an Asian teenager in three gigantic struggles of WWII. Back to high school more than a decade ago, I happened to read the original story of this teenage boy in an obscure anthology of folklore-type stories from the school library in China. Keen to literature and short stories, I was immediately touched by this remarkable story of destiny and experiences (How precocious I was). Vividly I still remember several paragraphs from that anthology (in Chinese) : ""Don't look down upon this young boy, a small figure but with extraordinary experiences...(there is a picture of the boy in the book), he was first drafted by the Japanese, and fought in the Battle of Nomonhan (in the west it's called Battles of Khalkhin Gol, which is the first scene of battle in the movie depicting the conflict between Japan and Soviet Russia), and then the boy (he was in the supply units in the original story) was taken prisoner by the Soviets. When the Nazis Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the boy was again captured by the Germans and served on the Western front. The only thing strikes me is that before I thought that this boy must be Chinese. I would say that this is the best story I've ever read about WWII in Asia. The Korean directors do pay a lot of attention to details. Fluent in German myself, I've also read stories about people in the ""Ostbatalion"" (East Battalion, People from the eastern European countries, Russia, etc, conscripted to fight the Allies in France), and that was the final scene where they fight in non-German units in Normandy. For American audiences, there may be some artistic presentation of the story which are different from the realistic effect of the American movies (like Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, etc). The movie also has the nationalistic feelings of the citizens of certain countries, which may be unfamiliar in the US and make people feel judgmental.  There are some scenes which seems to be unrealistic......so on and on. But ultimately, I am no historian. I have no idea if these stories are 100% true. But that's not the point. I would say, there are many riveting stories in the history worth being presented on movie and TV, even from a commercial perspective, but they are just oblivion to American directors and filmmakers. Less known but definitely interesting story-lines like this will have a growing market. I wish that more movies like this can be shot in Hollywood quality and be known internationally.",1348012800,,2667,4.848684210526316
5109619,5,B007S0DB56,"This an excellent movie, good story, lots of action, and great acting.  A wonderful addition to my collection.  I'll be looking to see more of this director's movies.",1348012800,,166,4.892857142857143
5109620,3,B007S0DB56,"I bought this dvd because it was Korean, and I knew that it would contain some fantastically choreographed battle scenes.  In that regard it exceeded my expectations.  I also bought it because, until now, I never knew that Koreans and Japanese served in the German Army facing off the allied invasion of Normandy.

What made the film lose some credibility with me was the strong brotherly relationship of the two main characters towards the end of the movie, and the fact that in most of the battles they seem to be the sole survivors.  I could not believe that the long suffering and severly oppressed Korean could get close to a Japanese officer who despised him for being Korean, and who excuted many of his Korean comrades in arms while serving in the Chinese theatre of war.  Somehow, I was expected to believe that the closeness came about when Koreans and Japanese were interned in a very brutal Soviet gulag and later used as cannon fodder against the German invaders of Russia.

I suppose the film is intended to serve as a form of reconciliation between the Japanese and Koreans.  But in that regard it is very much over the top, and very unconvincing.  Other than that criticism I can state that it was a beautifully filmed epic.",1347926400,2,1240,4.655963302752293
5109621,4,B007S0DB56,"While it doesn't have quite as cohesive a plot or reach the depths of characterization achieved in Kang's 2004 masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tae-Guk-Gi-The-Brotherhood-Of-War/dp/B003EAYMZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood Of War</a>, the whole fascinating WWII odyssey of Jun-shik Kim makes ""My Way"" an exquisitely unique film. The irony of how the Korean Kim--ably played by Dong-gun Jang, who also starred in ""Tae Guk Gi""--is forced to labor, fight, and ultimately expected to die for a succession of three not-so-different nations, none of which are his own and none of which inspire any particular loyalty, is not lost here.

Despite some abrupt transitions and a few unlikely details, the general cinematography is excellent and, particularly during the Siberian segment, includes some very arresting scenery. Without distractive moralizing, the film touches upon a number of different themes such as that of individuality over nationality and, most importantly of all, how the bitter enmity and competition between Kim and the aristocratic Japanese officer Tatsuo becomes a friendship when they are faced with using their common ability (running) to get home (another important motif in this film).

Over the last three decades or so, the general movie-making trend has been to portray war as starkly and realistically as it can be shown on screen. ""My Way"" is dominated by scenes of men being blown apart and run over by tanks; in this regard, it outdoes any American effort such as ""Flags of Our Fathers"" or ""Saving Private Ryan."" Thus, one of its biggest strengths could also be its biggest weakness: The pervasive battle footage is disturbing to the point where it's just plain hard to watch. .  . but isn't that how it should be?",1346630400,,1820,5.516129032258065

He had six teeth knocked out because the VC smashed the rifle butt in his face during a hand to hand combat.  He said it is easy to kill somebody but the person becomes part of you.  It is something that you cannot forget.

Most people who has encountered the senseless cruelty of war in person understood the suffering people have to go through.  My Way has some flaws but overall, it is a movie which all war mongers or the US politicians should watch.  We should only get involved in a war when we don't have any other choices.",1346544000,,658,4.258064516129032
5109623,5,B007S0DB56,"I had read long ago about a few Asians being conscripted into the German army just in time to see plenty of action at Normandy, but I never imagined a movie would be made about two of them in particular!

This movie is very battle-packed! It shows a Korean man named Jun-shik who dreams about being able to go to the Olympics, but Japan won't allow any representatives from a country that they have annexed many years earlier and the man is cheated out of his chance when he wins the tryouts and Japanese judges instead claim the winner to be Japan's representative, a man named Tatsuo who Jun-shik had competed with quite a few times since childhood and are rivals.

The results of the judgment force Jun-shik and several of his friends into conscription as lowly soldiers in the Imperial Japanese Army. Koreans serving as soldiers for the emperor are looked down upon as even worse than a Japanese private. Jun-shik finds this out the hard way up into the summer of 1939 when they are fighting Russian troops over a border dispute in the regions of Mongolia, the war of which is mostly unknown to most people today and only lasted a couple of months. The present colonel of Jun-shik's unit is punished for allowing his regiment to fall back in a bloody battle and is demoted to private and forced to kill himself to regain his honor. The new colonel is...VOILA!!! Tatsuo himself, the one and only!

Tatsuo regards Jun-shik with resentment from the start and tries to have him imprisoned for execution when Jun-shik objects to being part of a suicide unit to battle Russian tanks in the next battle. The Korean finds himself lucky when he is rescued before the scheduled dawn execution by members of his own squad. They go to escape but run into the assault force of at least  a hundred incoming Russian tanks. Jun-shik goes to warn the other members of the regiment about this attack but cannot prevent the bloodshed that follows. The battle scenes in here were excellent. You see Japanese troops take on Russian tanks by ramming trucks right into them. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers die in this battle and just when it seems like the Russian tank force cannot withstand this brutal assault of Japanese infantry, they are reinforced by more Russian tanks. Despite Tatsuo's exclamations to not fall back and to die for the emperor, he and Jun-shik are taken prisoner in the end, which is rare since Japanese troops regarded POW status as dishonorable and thousands of Japanese(and who knows how many Koreans)would rather kill themselves than be taken prisoner.

Both men, and many others, including the members of Jun-shik's squad, are then suffering for what seems to be an eternity in a freezing Soviet labor camp. Tatsuo is bitter and gets constantly punished when he defies Russian authority by refusing to deface his nation's flag, but he seems to hate Jun-shik all the more, with a scene where they are supposed to fight to the death. The two are about to meet their fate in front of a firing squad when news comes at the last second that Germany has invaded Russia. They are then conscripted into the Russian army to fight the Germans, fighting their first battle for them in December, 1941. The conscripts are little more than cannon fodder to be served to the Germans and their machine guns. It seems like the entire Russian unit of conscripts is wiped out in that battle, with Jun-shik and Tatsuo as the only survivors. It seems like the former Japanese colonel has started to warm up to this Korean because they leave together for German lines and Tatsuo has his life saved by Jun-shik right before advancing German infantry split them up.

In May, 1944, Tatsuo is reunited with Jun-shik at Normandy, France, following up towards the Allied invasion of France, and both men wearing German army uniforms. This is when the men regard each other as friends, and they go through quite the struggle to survive together when the American troops hit the beaches under an intensive bombardment by Allied aircraft and warships alike.

Do they survive? Well, you'll just have to see the movie! This is a MUST-HAVE for all history buffs!!!",1345852800,2,4140,4.741666666666666
5109624,5,B007S0DB56,"This is a story of an unlikely bromance between a Japanese soldier and a Korean during WWII. The film starts with their childhoods and marathon competitions. Jun-shik Kim (Dong-gun Jang) is a poor Korean who trains by being a ricksha driver. He is our likeable Rocky underdog. He runs against a privileged Japanese man,  Tatsuo Hasegawa (J Odagiri). Through circumstance the two end up together fighting in the same Japanese unit in China. Kim is a lowly private, who is considered fodder while Tatsuo is a complex character driven by his nationalistic teachings which he must overcome in order to survive.

What the movie shows us is that the Chinese, Koreans, and Russians have no love for each other, but can find unity in their hatred of the Japanese. It is a lesson in being careful how you treat people on the way up because you meet them on the way down. I loved the cinematography. The camera angles showed you bullets and bombs coming at you in a mock 3D CG effect. Since the DVD box tells you they become friends, you have to wait for the ""Agorn"" moment...but you know it is coming.

The film is dubbed in English. At 137 minutes I started feeling the length with about 20 minutes left.

5109628,5,B007S0DB56,"My Way (have I missed the point of the title?) is a movie with great content; good plotline and character development, cinemaphotography, cgi effects, and action sequences. Where My way deviates is in the details, and there are great liberties taken with facts.

Every character is mostly well thought out, the director having fleshed out the characters fairly well. While the discovery of a conscripted Korean in the service of the Werhmacht is true as well as amazing, Yang Kyoungjong,  (the real name of the Korean impressed into service by the Japanese, Russians, and eventually the Germans) is elevated by the film maker to an Olympic contender- the story line of Olympics, while real (  Sohn Kee-chung (gold) and Nam Sung-yong (bronze) in the 1936 Olympics in Nazi-era Berlin , and Korea placed far down on the roster in the 1948 London Olympics)this has been muddled into the plot of My Way. They do follow Yang's history line of where he fought and captured fairly closely.

In terms of the military aspects of this movie, the film makers did an excellent effort at realistic content. However, sharp-eyed observers will no doubt be squirming when they see BB63, the Missouri and several other Iowa class Battleships giving support fire in Normandy ( all of these class battleships were in the Pacific). Other nitpicky observations:

MG42 were used in the Soviet battle scene (taking place around 1939) when they weren't available in any quantity until 1942

Modern phones used in the German Bunkers at Normandy

Florescent lights and fixtures in the German Bunkers

US paratroopers (that caught Tatsuo at the end) did not land on the coast- their drop zones were well inland

Germans didn't have rubber soled boots

The characters didn't have proper haircuts (especially the main characters, who were allowed to retain their modern pop hairdos)

The main characters didn't hitch up their collars during inspection

I'll stop here...

All in all, this is a very good MOVIE, and well deserves a place on your shelf of worthy WW2 drams. By the way Yang Kyoungjong ( the real Korean soldier) immigrated to the US after the war and died in Illinois in 1992...",1344643200,2,2162,4.922865013774104
5109629,2,B007S0DB56,"Since 'Saving Private Ryan,' some of the best war movies to come out have been from South Korea, of all places.  Boasting big budgets (by Korean standards anyway), great CGI and high production values, movies such as 'Taegukgi:Brotherhood of War' and 'The Front Line' are loosening Hollywood's monopoly on war movies.  So it was with great expectations I saw 'My Way.'

'My Way' is the story of two friends who were swept into the maelstrom of war in 1939.  One, a Korean peasant named Kim Jun-Sik, was impressed into the service of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) against his will.  The other, a Japanese aristocrat named Tatsuo Hasegawa, volunteered out of patriotism and a sense of duty.  Althogh the two were childhood friends, an unfortunate incident which resulted in the death of Tatsuo's beloved grandfather at a party led to a bitter rift which was further exacerbated by their competitiveness in the Olympic sport of marathon running.  Alas, when our two protagonists cross paths again at Nomonhan a year later it was under anything but ideal circumstances.

Tatsuo, now the youngest colonel (his rise must have been quite meteoric) in the IJA, had relieved the disgraced colonel who retreated against massed Soviet tanks rather than making suicidal charges and ordered his seppuku.  He soon found himself fighting for his very survival when his own well laid plans were thwarted by yet another well-timed massed Soviet armored attack, and ended up a prisoner-of-war of the Soviets along with Kim.  After serving some time in the frozen Siberian gulag, Germany invaded Russia in 1941 and they were given the choice of fighting for the Rodina against the invading Nazis or facing summary execution, so the former it is.  And guess what?  Once again, the side he's fighting on had no tanks and less firepower than the enemy!  Oh, why must our poor boys always end up with the short end of the stick when it comes to battles?

Whatever misfortune befell Tatsuo and Kim, however, were more than made up for the fact that they were the only two survivors in the suicidal charge against entrenched German defenders (so who said your 'ying' doesn't balance my 'yang?), although Tatsuo was gravely wounded while fighting for the now tank-less Soviets.  Soon afterward, they were captured by the invading Germans and became separated.  Flash forward three years later and voila!, Tatsuo is now in German feldgrau preparing the defense of Normandy against the Normandy invasion.  And lo and behold, he saw his buddy Kim running along the beach!  Life is full of such unlikely coincidences, no?  Yes, I know this story is based on actual events, however loosely, and that the German army defending the Normandy beaches is truly a multi-national one, but come on!

I must admit, the CGI battle scenes in 'My Way' are first-rate and spectacular, though it feels like I'm playing 'Medal of Honor:Allied Assault' or 'Call of Duty' on the Playstation at times.  The final battle scene at Normandy is truly something to behold, even if it wasn't quite the way it actually happened.  But what really ruined this for me is its sheer ludicrousness.  For example, there is one relatively early scene in which a Chinese female sniper shot down a speeding, strafing Russian fighter plane coming straight at her with a single shot from her bolt action rifle.  This is just one of many unlikely implausibilities that stretched my belief beyond the breaking point and prevented me giving this movie my endorsement.",1344384000,12,3499,4.941880341880342

5109632,4,B007S0DB56,"This is an unbelievably inspiring movie.  Jang Doung-Gun and Joe Odagiri have performed superbly.  I have no doubt about it.  However, there are quite few scenes missing details.

At first, this movie is based upon the true event that a Korean man who wore the German uniform was captured in Normandy in 1944.  So where is follow up story of this with photos?  Without this, we could consider this as a fiction.

At second, the movie poorly portrayed the Battle of Khalkin Gol in 1939.  It was a total war with 500 tanks and 250 aircrafts from Russian Army (Red Army), and 135 tanks and 250 aircrafts from Japanese Army (Imperial Japanese Army).  Russian BT-5 and BT-7 crushed Japanese Type 95 and 89 as a massive tank battle; and Russian I-15 and 16 crushed Japanese Nakajima Ki-27 as air battle.  Those details are obviously missing, unfortunately.  In general, Korean or Chinese movies poorly portrayed the Imperial Japanese Army due to their historical resentment.  But missing these details could cause the movie viewers to turn off.

At last, they were rescued by the German Army after they fought against them as Soviet Army soldiers in 1941.  Then, they appeared in Normandy in 1944.  So this movie obviously left blank between 1941 and 1944.  I think that it should show some follow ups.",1343779200,,1296,4.796380090497737
