8639668,5,B006ZSLCFS,"Amazon shows it as being in English and German.  It is actually a mix of both.  The Cockpit to Traffic Control is in (broken) English, but the narration is in German.  While I was disappointed in this, it was still put together extremely well.  The audio and video quality is better than I could have expected.  While I am returning this one because of the language barrier, I bought three more with English subtitles.",1390780800,,418,4.594594594594595
