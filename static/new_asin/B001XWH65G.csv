3829636,2,B001XWH65G,"This film has so much potential to touch all ages with a sound and vital Christian message- but- I was disappointed with repeated scenes of -not being able to ride in a car alone, hold hands, or go on a date with a person, until they are engaged-- This strictness would turn off most. At the very least I would not be able to prove this belief by the Bible-- unless you went far enough back to opt for arranged marriages. This idea ate away at the credibility of the actor's words and sadly competed with the real, needful issue of- life beginning at conception- and the wonderful focus of ""doing the right thing come what may."" Truly sad and disappointed.",1264896000,4,656,4.429752066115703

3829638,5,B001XWH65G,"Fantastic, inspiring Christian movie!  We gave this as graduation gifts to two of the high school graduates in our church.  It is a great reminder to always do what is right, no matter what the cost.  Movie is good quality with good acting!",1245628800,19,240,4.534883720930233

3829641,3,B001XWH65G,"This DVD had a great message and a good Christian content, but it was not up to the previous ones that I have seen such as Facing the Giants and Fireproof. I would recommend it for it's content, but because it was the first project of a home school group, it lacked some of the professionalism of the previosly mentioned videos. I would purchase another video by this group, as I think they may have learned from some of their mistakes.",1244678400,11,436,4.395061728395062
3829642,5,B001XWH65G,"This movie emphasizes the importance of doing what is right even if you know the results may not be the best for you. A young man, who wishes to attend Patrick Henry College, must choose between a sure thing, which will guarantee his education is paid for and doing what is right, which will almost definitely end his ""scholarship.""

The movie also touches on the importance of purity before marriage and the importance of working through marital issues.

Extremely moral and excellent messages taught. Family friendly especially for children old enough to handle the abortion issue.",1243641600,24,583,5.0625

The story was pretty standard stuff, to be sure, but it was well worked out and well presented  if you consider that it was made with limited resources.

3829665,5,B001XWH65G,"This is a powerful movie with an awesome message.  Will you confuse it for a major studio film?  No, but it's a great movie considering that it was for the most part young people in their first film.",1346544000,,199,4.2105263157894735
3829666,5,B001XWH65G,"This was an excellent movie. It had a wonderful lesson in doing right no matter the consequences. It also touched on the importance of a respectful relationship between a young man and young lady, and the importance of faithfulness and forgiveness in a marriage relationship. The message far out-weighed anything it may have lacked in professionalism. Done quite well. Great movie. Highly recommend it.",1329782400,,402,5.296875
3829667,5,B001XWH65G,"In relation to the Movie ""Come What May"", we not only loved this film for the great story and performances by the actors, but also for it's consistent affirmation about the sanctity of life and it's great example of keeping one ""pure"" in regard to personal relationships.  It also shows how ""consideration in who one should marry and get personally involved with"" and not just simply rushing into a relationship because of convenience or attraction, was well worth the effort.  The changes of attitude and behaviour that the main (male) character of the film made, due to the leading lady's response (or lack of it), was encouraging to say the least.  And likewise, the female actor's respectful, but firm reluctance to submit to pressure was truly inspiring.
We have young adult teenagers who also have refrained from succumbing to such pressures from the opposite sex, and this film was a great tool in not only continuing to encourage them in their choices, but it also encouraged us as parents that raising our children with such Godly standards is well worth the effort.  The fact that the two main characters in the film had made the right choices in the end and therefore were able to enter into a marriage that was nothing short of beautiful, was an extra encouragement to our entire family.  There should be many more films like this one!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Come-What-May-DVD/dp/B001XWH65G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Come What May DVD</a>",1307491200,8,1497,5.273109243697479

3829673,4,B001XWH65G,"At the end of this film, we're told that the movie was made by a group of over fourty students, and I have no real difficulty believing that.  The film's subject matter is somewhat likable, but its cinematography is imperfect in a number of ways.

For one thing, the film could have benefitted from about fifty percent more background music than it had.  Lack of any background music can work well in horror films, but in inspirational stories, it really helps to have it.

Secondly, I'm afraid that the acting of the two young leads may turn people off at first, since neither of them are fantastic actors.  Not Keanu Reeves-type bad, but still not great.

I also found it hard to sympathise with the girl on at least one level.  I don't see why her father should be the one making ethical decisions for her.  I understand why she made the choices she did, and I agree with her, in a sense, but at her age, the role of the parent should be more as an ethical advisor and confidant; not as ""the boss of me.""  I'm afraid that even if that wasn't intended, that was how it sort of came across.

On the subject of its ethics, its understanding of law, and of religion, this film is spot-on, and I appreciate that.  There aren't enough modern movies willing to work that hard or think that much.  However, you also shouldn't watch this movie if you only care about happy endings, because this film is kind of a depression pill.

In Spider-man 2 (one of the best mainstream movies in recent years, in my opinion) Peter Parker expresses his discontent over the fact that his Uncle Ben lost his life because he was the only person who did the right thing, but Spider-man also tries to comfort us over the loss experienced by all the people who try to do the right thing, and give us a little hope.  As its title might indicate, Come What May makes no such attempt.

Still, there's a distinctiveness to that, and a sort of hard-hitting insistence in that approach, even though it excludes the film from ever becoming the feel good movie of ""x time of the year.""  This movie definitely didn't make me feel better.  In fact, it made me feel a lot worse.  Others have called it inspirational, and in an ethical sense, it most definitely is, but I'm also comparing it to better movies, made during better times, when the movie industry was a better thing.  Quality films like ""the Sound of Music,"" ""Newsies,"" and ""Beauty and the Beast,"" made during times when the quest for shock value wasn't all that mattered.

Maybe I shouldn't do that.  Maybe comparing this film to some of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time would be a mistake, but regardless, I feel that it would be just as wrong to give it the perfect grade.  This film has its heart in the right place, and it expresses that heart very well, but it's not perfect, and that's really all there is to it.",1265414400,,2861,4.4510556621881
