7945876,5,B00005MKOH,The film tells about the great escapes of allied and axis prisoners of World War II. Stalag Luft III was of special interest to me since my uncle escaped from there. The greatest escape artist was a brilliant German pilot who fled from a Canadian prison camp three times right in front of the guard's noses.,1398902400,,307,4.5

7945881,4,B00005MKOH,"This series had a couple clever surprises, in addition to what you are likely to expect.  It presents some perspectives I had not anticipated.  I enjoyed it, and think you will too.  Consider it your duty to watch it--or just get out!",1326672000,2,234,4.523809523809524
7945882,4,B00005MKOH,"The History Channel generally offers good productions on WWII subjects, and this DVD is no different. It is entertaining and accurate, and well worth the price of admission.",1168300800,5,173,5.214285714285714
7945883,4,B00005MKOH,"This two-part DVD presents escape experiences from situations as varied as POW camps, evacuations of land troops (Dunkirk)  and overturned ship hulls (the USS Oklahoma at Pearl Harbor). Some of the escapes cited, in my opinion, do not belong together in this DVD. Thus, for instance, the repeated escapes of one German POW (Luftwaffe pilot Steinhilper from a Canadian POW camp) hardly deserve mention together with the Great Escape of European POWs from Stalag Luft III. Individual escapes from German POW camps, each a counterpart of Steinhilper's experiences, were a common occurrence.  In addition, German POWs in Allied custody had much better conditions for escaping than did their Allied counterparts in German hands, and did not face potential death upon recapture, but that is another story.

Detailed scenes of the aftermath of the bombing of Pearl Harbor are provided, and survivors of the bombing of the USS Oklahoma are interviewed. One is also heartened to learn that several times as many soldiers were evacuated from the beaches at Dunkirk as had been originally planned.

Much detail is presented about the Great Escape from Stalag Luft III. A number of ageing veterans of the Great Escape were interviewed. Their memories appear to be very crisp despite the passage of all this time. Some of them were still brought to tears when the murder of 50 of the 73 recaptured airmen was recounted.",1147219200,13,1406,5.073593073593074
