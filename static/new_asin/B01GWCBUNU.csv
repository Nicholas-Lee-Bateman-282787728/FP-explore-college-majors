8763807,2,B01GWCBUNU,"This DVD was transferred from film using what is now a primitive technology. A single beam of light was projected through each frame of film onto the electronic receiving medium. The DVDs and Blu-rays were all accustomed to viewing today are made by projecting a scanning laser beam instead: a technology that produces colors of great fidelity. The older technology makes the faces of the actors resemble a bad job of embalming. The result resembles the black-and-white movies the Turner Company colorized decades ago for distribution to television. The result is so artificial and unlife-like that I tossed the disc after watching only a few minutes of it. What I saw, however, appeared to be a very fine movie.

Some viewers might not mind the appearance. I found it extremely distracting.",1500163200,,791,5.038167938931298
