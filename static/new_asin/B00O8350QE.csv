6728771,1,B00O8350QE,"I give it a star because you have to give it at least one star, it was horrible. Bad acting. It was like home movies. The budget must have been like ten thousand dollars. Do not even pay the $2 to rent it.",1427328000,4,205,3.7906976744186047
6728772,5,B00O8350QE,Amazing movie. Loved the story. The vampires were well portrayed. Lynn lowery was amazing as always.,1427328000,,100,5.3125
6728773,1,B00O8350QE,"Bad Script , bad acting, not even cult potential.",1426636800,2,49,4.555555555555555
6728774,1,B00O8350QE,"Interesting premise of a town cut off from the outside world, which is sparsely populated by humans, but busting at the seams with vampires. Very poor acting and poor sound quality make it a waste of money to rent, and a waste of time to watch. I love vampire movies that include at least good acting, good sound quality and a good plot; however, ""Mostly Dead"" is a flop!",1426550400,5,371,4.391304347826087
6728775,1,B00O8350QE,"I don't usually write a review but this is bad, bad, bad.  I read the other reviews that gave 5 stars and thought I would give it a chance.  Waist of time and money.  I watched 3 mins. of the movie and couldn't believe this had 5 stars.  This girl walking with a baby in her arms in one scene has on flat shoes and other scene has on boots and being chased by vampires actually wearing capes like cheap Halloween costumes.  Music is horrible and acting is even worse.  DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY unless your with a group of bored friends and need a good laugh.",1425600000,4,556,4.149532710280374
6728776,5,B00O8350QE,"I was impressed by this film from a new director, Hernan Caraballo. I really enjoyed watching it. It has drama, suspense and humor throughout. Nice job everyone!",1414368000,2,161,5.0
6728777,5,B00O8350QE,"Great indie film, I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to attend the premiere! I'm definitely looking forward to more from this company. Highly entertaining and thought provoking character study.

Update: So glad to see this finally getting a VOD release! Instant purchase!",1412640000,2,277,5.441860465116279

8682430,1,B00O8350QE,"Have you ever had that annoying ringing in your ears that just seems to go on and on, and you just wish it would stop?,  Well, this is the film equivalent of that.  Monotonous sets, acting, story, lighting, music....just plain dull.",1472169600,,232,4.634146341463414
8682431,3,B00O8350QE,"The idea behind this movie was great. The soundtrack was awesome. Understanding the budget was only $22,000 to $25,000, it was a good movie. If you are a Vampire movie fan, you should watch this movie.",1471132800,,201,4.611111111111111
