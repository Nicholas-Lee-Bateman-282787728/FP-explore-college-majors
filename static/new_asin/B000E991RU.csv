2510816,4,B000E991RU,"Martians invade sunny and scenic Puerto Rico to-what else?-find earth women to mate with.  They shoot down a space shuttle that they mistake for a nuclear missile(using MAXIMUM ENERGY!).  Little do they know that the rocket was piloted by an android designed for space travel.  The android, frazzled by the crash, decides to go on a homicidal rampage until he's found and calmed down by his creator(James Karen no less!).  Since you've already got a malfunctioning, bloodthirsty robot on your hands, why not turn him loose on the martians?  Well, that's what happens.  Our robot hero battles stock footage and an army of Billy Corgans and finally frees the slave chicks, but not before his final confrontation with the Space Monster.  The Space Monster looks alot like Oderus from Gwar.  So, what does Frankenstein have to do with this mess?  Absolutely nada.  The name Frankenstein must be box office gold or something, coz it's used here for no reason at all.  The ""Frankenstein"" here is the hero android.  His name is Frank though, so I guess that sorta qualifies.  He looks a bit like the Terminator when half of his face is gone, exposing the metal skeleton underneath.  You certainly don't need a review to let you know if you want to see a film like this, the title and cover art speak for themselves.  Fans of this kind of stuff will know what they're getting into.  But in regards to movies of this type, this one is actually rather fun.  Odds are we won't see this one remade, so that's a plus.",1174262400,2,1504,4.657794676806084
2510817,3,B000E991RU,"Pop quiz hotshot...your home planet, devastated by atomic war, is now inhabited by a handful of men and almost no women...what do you do?  Answer...you hop in your spacecraft and scour the universe for hot babes in the hopes of abducting them and returning home to repopulate your world of course, and that's pretty much the main gist behind the film Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster (1965), directed by Robert Gaffney, who would later go on to direct photography for part of Stanley Kubrik's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).  Starring in the film is James Karen (Poltergeist, The Return of the Living Dead), former playmate (June '59) Marilyn Hanold (The Brain That Wouldn't Die), and Lou Cutell (Little Big Man).  Also appearing is Nancy Marshall (Asylum of Satan), David Kerman (Murder, Inc.), Robert Reilly (To Save a Child), and Bruce Glover (Diamonds Are Forever, Chinatown) in a dual role as a Martian patrolman and also the space monster named Mull.

As the movie begins we see some Martians, led by the comely Princess Marcuzan (Hanold), along with her bald-headed, smirking, often effeminate brainiac sidekick/scientist named Doctor Nadir (Cutell), cruising about in outer space, headed towards Earth.  Once in orbit they perceive various rocket launches by NASA to be missile attacks and proceed to use a force field to destroy them.  NASA, unaware of the Martians, decide on a new approach by sending a rocket into space piloted by a human looking robot (one that can feel pain, for some reason), created by Dr. Adam Steele (Karen) and his assistant Karen Grant (Marshall), to eliminate the possibility of human error, I guess.  As launch time approaches we get a load of stock footage, and, again, the Martians force the ship down, but the robot manages to eject his capsule, landing somewhere in Puerto Rico.  Princess Marcuzan, now realizing the rockets were not missile attacks but manned space missions, orders her crew to land and destroy the pilot for fear he might relate to Earth authorities of their presence, which results in the robot getting blasted and subsequently damaged, turning it into a sort of Frankenstein monster who wanders the area killing at random.  From here the Martians decide to enact phase two of their plan, which involves collecting nubile, young female specimens for the purpose of returning them to Mars, because Mars needs women...er, wait, that's a different film.  Anyway, a bunch of stuff happens including tons more stock footage (most of it of the military type), some go-go dancing, the procurement of more bikini clad breeding stock, Nadir continuing to act fruity, Adam cruising the streets of San Juan on a Vespa, a couple people get disintegrated, we meet Mull, the mutant Martian monster brought along for the ride, Karen gets abducted, all culminating in a real clash of the titans (sort of) as the discombobulated Frankenstein robot battles the Martian mutant.

While this film was the pits (but in a fun way), I did learn quite a bit including the following...

1. Stock footage and lengthy driving montages are a great way to pad out a film's running time without having to spend a lot of extra dough

2. Dressing a few guys up in phony looking spacesuits hardly instills the belief they're actually Martians.

3. Martian men are bald and sport Vulcan ears.

4. The makers of this film should have gotten their money back from whoever supplied them with those baldheaded wigs and pointy ears for the Martian characters as they look ridiculously phony.

5. Martian princesses, while certainly attractive, are harsh mistresses, especially when it comes to punishment doled out to those who fail in performing their duties.

6. A machete works just as good splitting skulls as it does coconuts.

7. A mutant Martian with excessive body hair and obviously rubber claws doesn't seem all that threatening.

8. When trying to communicate with a Spanish speaking bartender your need to use his telephone by using the word `telephone', he'll most likely give you a beer, but if you use the phrase `el telephono', he'll understand you perfectly.

9. Dr. Nadir seems to enjoy the more heinous aspects of his job just a bit too much.

10. When the military issues a `Code 24' alert, prepare yourself for massive amounts of stock footage.

11.  Earthmen are unusually passive when dudes in spacesuits show up and steal their women (in all fairness the spacesuit guys were sporting ray guns, but still, forty unarmed Earthmen against three armed spacemen seems like favorable odds).

12. Conventional weaponry (artillery, rockets, etc.) is useless against a geodesic dome-like spaceship with a metal skirt and spindly landing gear, all seemingly made of aluminum.

13. When obtaining the rights to songs for a film, maximize the expenditure by playing the songs more than once.

14. Unused montage footage can be utilized to provide viewers with something to watch during the closing credits (waste not want not).

As I alluded to earlier, the film's a real dud, but goofy enough to be entertaining.  One really funny aspect that sticks in my mind is near the beginning when Adam, Karen, a General, and a pilot are traveling in a Lincoln Continental, all four in the backseat.  Now the backseat of a Continental is large, it's obviously not large enough to accommodate the foursome, resulting in the appearance of the General actually sitting on Karen's lap.  Another entertaining aspect of the film was the character of Dr. Nadir, played by Lou Cutell.  He's made up in a way that makes him look like a bald, evil gremlin, enhanced by his slyly suggestive, effeminate smirks.  The performances are generally rotten, as was the dialog, which is steeped with harebrained exposition.  The special effects are bargain basement (I thought the creature Mull actually looked halfway decent).  I dug inclusion of the song `That's The Way It's Got To Be' by The Poets, even if it had no relevance what so ever to the film.  There's probably about a good twenty minutes of stock footage (the film only runs 77 minutes) but what's used seems to have been chosen with some thought, so that was appreciated.  All in all the movie is a real dog, but entertaining in an Ed Wood/Plan Nine from Outer Space sort of way, certainly worth a few laughs.

The picture quality on this Dark Sky Films DVD release, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks better than it should (there are some obvious signs of age, but, overall it's quite clean and clear) and the Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio comes through exceptionally well.  There are some good extras, including a 14-page insert booklet, an original theatrical trailer for the film, a still gallery, and English subtitles.  All in all a great release of a rotten, albeit fun, film.  Two stars for the film plus an extra star for the DVD release.

By the way, if you're interested in getting a copy of the infinitely groovy tune `That's The Way It's Got To Be', by The Poets, featured in this film, you can find it on disc two of a four CD box set released by Rhino Records entitled Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond.  The set itself is pricey, but it's worth it especially if you dig on rare British rock from the mid to late 1960s.",1159315200,20,7270,4.88599348534202

2510820,5,B000E991RU,"I've lusted after this movie for a long time now after reading about it in my movie books and now, finally, thanks to Dark Sky Films, it's on DVD.  Was I disappointed now that I've finally gotten to see it?  Nope, not one bit.  Here's the plot, such as it is:  Alien beings, hanging out in space, keep blowing up earth's space shots because they think they're missles sent to destroy them.  Earth doesn't get it.  They send up a robot, named Frank, who looks human but underneath that nice head of hair he's vacuum tubes and capacitors.  The aliens shoot him too but he escapes in a capsule and lands in Puerto Rico.  The Aliens land there too & their mission is to capture babes to help bring back their population which was destroyed in a nuclear war.  Frank tangles with aliens and gets most of his face blown off after which he looks like a monster.  Alien dudes are running amok collecting bikinied babes.  The babes get dragged back to the space ship, and put on conveyer belts, covered with sheer curtains (like your mom had in the living room) and sent off somewhere else in the spaceship while the leaders look on and nod in approval.  Is this weird?  You bet.  Is this cheesy?  Also affirmative.  But is it FUN?  Oh yeah, it is.  Lots of cool music in the background also adds to the charm.  This will most likely be enjoyed the most by drive-in and bad cinema enthusiasts, like myself, but it's a fun little time capsule of sorts and even has a very young James Karen from ""Return of the Living Dead"".

2510821,5,B000E991RU,"I wonder how good the print will be but, really, it can't be that much worse than any of the previous versions I've seen. This movie is flat out amazing.

Update: The disk is great, better quality than a lot of other recordings. Super happy I bought it. Nothing really wrong that I found. I am sort of miffed by all the ""so bad it is good reviews"" I read of this movie now. The movie is so painfully tongue in cheek that I feel like you'd have to a totally ridiculous aesthete snob to think of it as a mistake. It would seem it is easier for a viewer to assume that everyone in the 50s/60s we only fresh out of the trees. Clearly a movie about sex starved Martians and  a broken robot is not meant to be taken in the same light as 1984 or some other more well known science fiction art film. I've also had to explain that Starship Troopers is meant to be viewed ironically.

Sorry to be such a nerd but this is perhaps one of my all time favorite old scifi movies, because it is so abnormal and for me that makes it worth of genuine enjoyment, it the same way I love Solaris(original) or 2001 which both have unintentionally funny moments. I think of this movie as only needing a misfits soundtrack to be more enjoyed.",1148774400,7,1218,4.174468085106383

2510834,4,B000E991RU,"I first saw this movie when I was four years old. Yes, my father and grandfather took me and my little brother to see this at my first drive-in flick. To say the least, it scared me greatly. The first really bad thing was the astronaut losing half his face and me not understanding the robot concept. Then he loses his mind and starts killing people at random. So the good guy is a deranged killer. Yes, I was hiding behind the front seats by that time!

And what could make it worse, for this, then, four year old you may ask? When the astronaut would go on his killing sprees, they would play a tune that sounded like insanity to me. In fact, that particular noise has been played on a number of other crazy situations within film of the time, including, for sure, an Underdog episode when he loses his mind and goes off wanting to kill Sweet Polly, etc. For a great deal of my life, every time I heard that music, something would snap inside of me and I would feel a unique sense of dread, as though I was starting to lose my mind or something; really odd.

Anyway, I bought this movie and went through that crazy sound one more time, and it didn't bother me any. I think that is on a par with my dream life, as nightmares just don't scare me anymore. Nonetheless, aside from my personal weirdness about this movie and that music, this is a unique enough movie, maybe just for that crazy music alone, to make it worth the purchase price to me. Just the weirdness of a bunch of guys in full atronaut gear, chasing and capturing a bunch of beach girlies is another reason. Oh, the humanity! What would Major Matt Mason have said?

So you have the bad guys in full, clean astronaut gear, and a hero astronaut who has half his face burned off. Our ""hero"" goes around as a homicidal maniac for a certain amount of time, and then you have the Uncle Fester character (whom was certainly menacing to my child eyes). Add that weird music to all of that, and I don't know what stranger movie I could had seen as my first.

All in all, I would say the transfer here was in pretty good shape, though with so much lunacy onscreen, I'm not sure I really noticed.",1379808000,2,2151,4.264705882352941
2510835,4,B000E991RU,"Should you watch this?  No, but not an imperative no.  Why would you watch this?  Well, perhaps that cover tricked you into thinking that you were going to see a 1950s sci-fi feature with some good costumes.  You'd be half right.

Made in the 1960s on a budget that would have undoubtedly impressed a shoestring FMTSM became legendary in the annals of bad cinema.  In the booklet that accompanies this DVD we find out why: it was originally written and conceived as a sci-fi comedy with intentional hammy acting but the producers said ""no"", they wanted something more serious.  So the script was rewritten in a less humorous tone.  The actual movie, intentionally funny at moments, is more often unintentionally funny.  Take, for instance, an early scene where we are introduced to Colonel Frank Saunders who literally freezes up before reporters; we are later to find out that he froze up because he glitched what with him being an android and all but the movie literally freezes the frame and just hangs for a moment making the viewer wonder what happened to their player, figuring that they're DVD player froze, only to find the scene in motion again with the reporters repeating their questions with quizzical looks on their faces and then jumping back to the freeze frame.  The technique that is used provokes laughs.

The acting is either wooden (the captive women; James Karen, a veteran actor with a recognizable face even if you can't immediately pinpoint what you know him from) to hambone (the alien Dr. Nadir, looking like an inspiration for Mike Meyer's Austin Powers nemesis Dr. Evil, slays his lines with eye-popping enunciation).  This is all part of the movie's charm, along with copious amounts of stock footage which often doesn't match from one scene to another and a hackneyed plot that sees the aliens, ""victors"" in their own internal civil war that has left their planet uninhabitable and worse yet without women except the inaccessible dominatrix Princess Marcusan, coming to earth to abduct fine human female specimens.

But what of the monsters on the front jacket?  Those would be the titular Frankenstein, an android created by earth scientists to send on a mission to Mars, who gets the side of his face fragged and goes on a rampage and ultimately battles the monster Mull (our other cover character) who looks like an alien crustacean-humanoid-bigfoot hybrid.

This is a movie whose charm is tied up in exactly how terrible it is.  It's endearing in that quality, and quite entertaining.  I'll close with a quote from the booklet, written by George Garrett (one of the writers of the screenplay): ""And the movie, itself?  It has not improved with age, true; but it is still out there in video versions and sometimes even on TV, patiently waiting, not for your attention, because it doesn't demand anybody's full attention.  In fact, it probably plays best when your attention is divided or even altogether elsewhere.

2510847,4,B000E991RU,"""Do your eyes dare witness total terror?!?""

Grab the popcorn, and prepare for a wild ride! ""Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster"" is a hilarious 1965 sci-fi flick about astronauts, Martians, nuclear war, and stock footage! The film starts with a wacky backstory about a half human-half android astronaut on a trip to mars, but quickly finds itself in Puerto Rico. Featuring tons of stock footage courtesy of NASA and the US military, it turns out that a Martian ship under the command of the strict but beautiful Princess Marcuzan (Marilyn Hanold) and proto-Vulcan Dr. Nadir (Lou Cutell, whose bald head and ear appliances are beyond hilarious) are shooting down the spaceships from Earth. The android astronaut ejects (is that wise in space?), and the aliens pursue him and land their ridiculous spaceship which looks like a piece of Buckminster Fuller architecture on stilts. The aliens succeed in burning half his face off, but are otherwise stymied. The now Astro-Frankenstein (Robert Reilly) becomes a murderer, and begins his random monster trek, killing randomly when the urge strikes him.

The film then explains that the reason the Martians came to earth in the first place is that their own world was destroyed by nuclear war, and there are no females left for breeding: humans are obviously required for breeding stock, and women in bikinis are most highly prized: no wonder why they landed in Puerto Rico. The hoards of aliens are stunning to behold; I am particularly entertained by the scene where they storm the pool party.

Along the way there is much padding when a cute couple from NASA, Dr. Adam Steele (James Karen), and Karen Grant (Nancy Marshall) explores Puerto Rico on a Vespa scooter: you have to get the running time up to 79 minutes somehow! The couple finds Frank (the astronaut is still technically Col. Frank Saunders) in a cave, and he seems compliant and doesn't mind having electrodes implanted in his skull at all. The couple splits up, with Karen (Marshall) going on the scooter for help, at which point she is promptly abducted by the aliens. Karen resists the aliens, who punish her by putting her in a cage by Mull, a hideous beast. I can't bring myself to describe the ""purification"" the aliens employ on their bikini-clad captives: suffice it to say it's one of the silliest concepts in motion picture history.

Because of the disappearance of eight women the military goes to it's highest level of alert (""This is Code 24, General!"") and the stock footage brigade is unleashed. Steele gets Frank up and walking and they search for Karen. He instructs ""Karen shouldn't be very far,"" even though he sent her away on a moped. Of course they find her moped without difficulty, and adjacent to it they discover the very conspicuous alien ship. Steele leaves Frank in charge of securing the ship, while he goes for help on the scooter. The General activates ""Project Mayflower"" with a ""priority one message, code 24!"" Oh, the excitement! Frank fights the aliens and loses; the aliens bring his body into the ship and Karen eyes him with something like lust in her eyes. It's a whole weird thing. Frank wakes to Karen's soothing voice; Frank then frees all the women, but Mull escapes and Frank and Mull duke it out, hence the title of the film. (Finally!)

I bet you cannot imagine what happens next. Steele and Karen are reunited, the alien ship takes off with the Frank and Mull battle still raging, and Frank becomes a hero as he blows up the ship, saving Earth from a horrible fate! The action is over, but your personal terror is not: the film closes with a ghastly song and endless footage of moped touring of scenic Puerto Rico. Good luck!

The DVD includes some extras including a photo gallery and the trailer for the film, and pictures of some great poster art and lobby cards. This film breaks no cinematic ground whatsoever, and is like many other ""Martian women harvesting"" movies, most notably ""Mars Needs Women."" The pleasure of this film is in viewing it as a humorous artifact of mid-1960's cheap horror cinema, complete with almost total lack of logic, continuity, or budget. For people who revel in the delicious badness of B-movies from years ago, ""Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster"" is a clear gem of the genre.",1265155200,5,4272,4.8212824010914055

There's a nuclear war on Mars that destroys everyone except a half dozen men and one woman, the Queen of Mars. So they fly to earth (strange that they have the technology for interplanetary space flight, but know nothing about earth, their nearest planetary neighbor), and shoot down rockets that they think are armed missiles. Meanwhile, NASA is a bit concerned that they keep loosing their rockets and astronauts, being oblivious to the presence of the last remnent of the Martian race hanging out in orbit above Earth. So they build an android astronaut named Frank. When they send him up, the Martians shoot his rocket down; but see that it was manned (that idiot Dr. Nadir didn't know these were rockets? What's the Queen of Mars to do?), so they land in Puerto Rico to kill the earthling; and also to begin collecting women to use for breeding to repopulate Mars.

Frank the android / robot, however, gets damaged, and starts going around killing people. This is an embarassment for NASA, so Frank's creators fly to Puerto Rico to get him. The Martians are unable to find or kill Frank - who is now ""Frankenstein"" due to his deformity in the Martian attack. Meanwhile, the Martians start collecting Earth women to prepare them for the breeding program. Dr. Nadir's enjoyment of his work is all too obvious: one would be hard pressed to find a finer example of utter sleaze. Abducting the women proves easy; hardly any resistance is offered to the Martians; who, by the way, are dressed in NASA surplus space suits, rubber things to simulate baldness, and prosthetic pointy ears (The Queen is wearing a regal looking head dress; so the question of her baldness and pointy ears is a mystery never solved. Too bad: I would have liked to have seen that).

The women are put in a cage, and later laid on a conveyor belt and covered in sheets (the women being unusually submissive at this point). The conveyor belt takes them,,, somewhere, and the purpose of this is,,, well, your guess is as good as mine. Oh, I almost forgot! The Martians brought something with them: a hairy rubber faced monster in a cage. Why? Who knows? I suppose you can't plan an invasion of a whole planet to abduct women for breeding purposes without a hairy rubber faced monster in a cage.

Meanwhile, the NASA scientists find Frank. He's been going around murdering anyone he sees, but they have no problem with him. The woman of the team treats him in an almost maternal manner; despite him being a machine.

Well, the end is predictable. The female scientist with tender feeling toward Frank the android is abducted, but later freed by Frank. The military (shown with tons of stock b-roll) finds the space ship, but cannot seem to hit the space craft (which looks like a flimsy metal tent that is noticably larger on the inside than on the outside). Frank the Android gets loose, frees the women, fights the hairy rubber faced monster, and ends up blowing up himself and the spaceship - an act of heroic self-sacrifice (displaying high moral character for a damaged robot) and simultaneously, genocide against the last of the Martian race. After which the hero and his woman rides off into the streets of Puerto Rico on a mo-ped. And they all lived happily ever after.

Of course, it all makes perfect sense.",1260662400,,3325,4.684931506849315
2510849,5,B000E991RU,"People often belittle this movie as being poorly made, full of plot holes, etc. They absolutely right; welcome to B-movie antics. Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster is a triumph of stock footage and budget film-making. Shot on a small budget over the course of two weeks, the film spared every expense, making use of both free locations to film and a record amount of stock footage; a certain hillside in Puerto Rico will endear itself to you many times.

We as Americans have made countless movies that stand as cultural icons. Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, I would argue, is among them for its sheer absurdity and impact on future films. It is often the golden standard against which other schlock films are judged.

This film doesn't take itself too seriously. Don't judge it too harshly. You would do well to relax your guard and enjoy it for what it is: a frankensteinesque mashup of comedy and schlock horror made on a shoe-string budget.",1237766400,,954,4.810975609756097
2510850,3,B000E991RU,"A race of Aliens continue to destroy Earth's space ships. In order to prevent the loss of another astronaut the US decides to send up an android named Frank. Of course, Frank gets shot down, but survives only horribly disfigured.  Meanwhile his builders are concerned that if he survived the crash he might become ""a Frankenstein"".  Of course, Frank does go a little ""off course"" and terrorises the locals where he crash lands. Meanwhile, the Aliens land to start their real mission to capture bikini-clad babes in order to repopulate their dying world. Bad make-up (Dr. Nadir's bald cap and ear putty are a hoot), bad special effects - okay , no special effects and a hairy skulled monster. What else could you ask for, except maybe a cutesy little song at the end as our hero and heroine scientists drive off on their Vespa to the lyrics, ""Oh, Oh, Oh."" The end music never matched this sci-fi ""classic"", but somehow as hokey as it is, it seems to add a final touch to this amusingly silly flick. I give it 3 stars just for the tubes (check out Frank's post press interview)!",1231632000,,1076,4.569948186528498

Only true science fiction buffs know what I am talking about. No, you cant compare this film to any modern day film because it has a different kind of creative style of its own. The only film that comes to mind made in the last couple decades that stand up is Lost on Mars. Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster is truly a brilliant made film for its time.

8107707,2,B000E991RU,"When eggheaded spaceship commander, Dr. Nadir (played by Lou Cutell), eagerly flashes his cartoon eyes and flaunts his snack-like ear extensions, it signifies a direct launch into oddball movie territory. As Cutell's Nadir excitedly describes the operation to abduct choice female Earthlings to repopulate his home planet, his silly putty appearance and curiously campy portrayal makes him the star of an otherwise unremarkable cast. Marilyn Hanold (as Martian Princess Marcuzan) has picture perfect mannequin-like features, but her portrayal is so rigid, dull, smug, and exacting you'd think she was playing the part of a strict schoolteacher. In another department we have Frankenstein, not the much-loved Frankenstein monster as created by Mary Shelley, but an android with the same moniker devised by an American engineer. Frankenstein, or ""Frank"" as he is later called, is part of a plan to help prevent human casualties from occurring during space missions. The actor's unusually wide-set eyes seem like a perfect attribute for playing the part of an android, but his acting proves inconsistent as he wavers from appearing too Homo Sapienly to too robotic. Frank barely cuts an interesting character, but even more disappointing is that the director strings him around in an increasingly thin, formulaic plot consisting of search and chase scenarios. All the while the viewer sits wondering: ""Where IS that hideously horrible and tacky Space Monster we've all been waiting to see?!!"" You'll see him alright, IF you make it through the first three-quarters. When he makes his appearance, one wonders whether he was really worth waiting for.

Neither the ""worst of the worst"" nor the ""best of the worst"" could be used to describe this B-movie. Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster sinks from a watchable 3-stars to 2-stars in the second half where it becomes a bit too obvious that the scriptwriter ran out of imaginative ideas.",1484697600,,1932,5.293159609120521

FMTSM is a very entertaining little film; perfect for a rainy Saturday afternoon. The monster is actually well done and highly original. The Frankenstein monster's ""melted face"" makeup is unique and the close-ups of his computerized brain are fun to watch in a gross sort of way.

Look for Bruce Glover, father of Crispin Glover, as one of the aliens.

Mix in some cool music montages, cute ladies in bikinis, a campy Femme fatale, cult movie legend James Karen, and you have a sure fire winner.

I hope Rifftrax will riff this one day soon.",1466726400,4,778,4.827067669172933
