7900794,5,7886113101,"Zhang Yimou has become a virtual brand of Chinese art movie--Zhang Yimou as director, that is.  In this atypical film, he is leading actor.  Also in contrast to the A list of ZYM productions, the story highlights not an oppressed Chinese female, but a chained society: an entire suffering village of toiling generations, in which personal martyrdom becomes aggregated in mass social history.  Tolerate the grainy visuals, bad subtitles, slow to develop plot; and you will unearth a starkly moving story of gritty characters who will enlighten you about some of the forces behind China's rise and fall, fall and rise.",1213488000,5,616,5.079207920792079
