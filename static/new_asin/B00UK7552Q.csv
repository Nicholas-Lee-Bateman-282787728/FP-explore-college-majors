7049587,5,B00UK7552Q,"As I am just getting started with this video set, I will speak to those things that I can speak to. First, delivery: timely and in great condition. Second, production value: well lit, and good sound. Lastly, technique: well explained, and shown in varying points of view.
If you've never trained in striking arts, these videos give a very good introduction.
I would strongly recommend this set of videos. The only real question you need to ask yourself is:  Aren't I worth it?",1447286400,13,476,4.734939759036145
7049588,5,B00UK7552Q,"This an excellent DVD series. As a former practitioner of Nihon Goshin Aikido, as well as World Oyama Karate, I wanted to learn a new art. I found Krav Maga and researched everything I could on the subject. Unfortunately there are no Krav classes anywhere near where I live so I started looking into DVD courses. That's when I came upon this series and decided to buy it and give it a try. I popped in the first DVD and was hooked. Michael South is a great instructor! Every move and principle are very well demonstrated. I am also impressed at the availability of the instructors. If you are looking to learn Krav Maga and can't attend regular classes; I would highly recommend buying this series. You will not be disappointed.",1444780800,8,728,4.564885496183206
7049589,5,B00UK7552Q,"This is, by far, the best of the home study courses I've found on the subject of Krav Maga. The lessons are clearly explained and demonstrated several times on all DVDs, and would benefit both the beginner and advanced students alike. The delivery of the DVDs was swift. I also purchased the advanced set and was just as pleased.

I bought a two dvd set from Century that was horrible and hesitated to buy another. I'd heard good things about this set and gave it a try.
I found Michael South's instruction on the series to be very detailed. While not being excessively wordy like some instructors, he gives a clear description of what he is doing. Can't wait to see series 2!",1435881600,11,505,4.5

These videos do a great job at giving viewers workouts that they can practice at home.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to learn how to do Krav.

7049595,4,B00UK7552Q,Just got these dvds last week they came earlier then expected. I have to say the quality was great and the instruction was very detailed and easy to follow. If your looking just for a workout again these dvds are perfect they come with a in classroom follow along workout. Believe me when I say if you do them 3x a week you will notice a difference. Even just the combative dvd you could make into a workout with a little imagination.

7049596,4,B00UK7552Q,"I have been training in Krav Maga for the last 3 years across Belgium, UK and US. I am often moving for my work.

I am a French native speaker. I sometimes have a hard time following a technic during a class. On top of that I can easily start to wonder, picture the technic in my head or a real world situation where I am the hero. Because of that, I miss small (critical) details, sometimes.

I was looking for DVDs summarizing all the basics, core notions that I could have missed, and more.

I write notes after each class. I have a bunch of notes with childish drawings that I would be ashamed to show to anybody. But that's enough to trigger memories of a technique weeks or months after a class.

I came across Total Krav Magas videos (Youtube etc.) number of times before buying the DVDs.

Pros:
- The quality of video and sound is excellent. Distinct voices, no blur, different angles, etc.
- Labels on the upper left corner indicating what is the next exercise or technic. That helps me a lot refreshing the names of the technics.
- The instructor does a fantastic job explaining and demonstrating the technics, even if I often pause or rewind (mainly for the workouts and drills).
- You can directly jump to a specific video. This is not just a single track DVD. That's a small detail but is incredibly helpful when you want to review a technic or workout quickly.

Cons:
 - I was a tad disappointed by the workout. You need a partner in order to take advantage of that part.

I also bought a BOB (Body Opponent Bag) to train at home. I know this is an expensive item, but coupled with this DVD, it's incredibly useful (ground work, abs, etc).",1484179200,3,1653,4.379084967320262
7049597,2,B00UK7552Q,"After careful review of this set i have found it to be incomplete, inaccurate and even dangerous to the unlearned novice especially. Krav Maga is based on principles that have been tried and proven in combat, law enforcement and now even our civilian community. That being said, if we train improperly or we train inaccurate techniques or we do not follow the basic principles of Krav Maga we put ourselves and even others in harms way.
i will start with dvd 1 basic combatives: When teaching straight punches Mr. South never explains about proper wrist alignment, or that you need to punch with your front two knuckles(important to know especially for beginners to prevent injury in training).His combatives are basic as for the rest of his combatives but his footwork and body sponsorship as he likes to call it are questionable at best.
disk 2
When Mr. South demonstrates 360 outside defenses he only demonstrates 4 of the 6 angles of defense on each side. He demonstrates making his block by stopping the attackers arm at the elbow with his wrist which it should be as much as is possible wrist to wrist to prevent the attackers arm bending and making contact anyway. This is especially true when defending against weapons.
When demonstrating the sprawl it is incorrect as in he does nothing to stop his attackers foward movement and to establish control.
His choke from behind with a push defense is questionable and his footwork is dangerous.
His same side wrist grab defense he pulls back to release his wrist as opposed to steping in, closing distance as you step off line of the attack using leverage as opposed to muscle. He also remains in the line of attack.
Opposite side wrist grab same problem he pulls away relying on strength as opposed to leverage. He also shows a very bad ineffective modification this would never work for the 100 lb woman trying to escape from an enraged man. I have pages of notes breaking down each dvd but I would just keep it short because I am seeing the same mistakes repeatedly throughout these training dvds.
Throughout the entire set I am watching techniques that require strength to execute them properly which is totally opposite of everything Imi taught. These weapons defense techniques demonstrate poor control, poor redirection especially with the firearms Mr. South has been confronted with these inaccurate defenses and refuses to acknowledge the danger of teaching improper defenses especially against weapons. I do not recommend anyone using this training material to learn Krav Maga! i wil also be reviewing his advanced dvd set as well and I will post a review once I have finished.
Krav Maga, true Krav Maga is a very effective system when taught, learned and executed properly. Beware of misled instructors teaching bad habits and techniques, it could cost you your life!",1481760000,5,2832,4.88981288981289
7049598,5,B00UK7552Q,This is a very well put together DVD. The instructions are clear and concise. All the moves are explained in detail and shown from many angles so you can see exactly how to preform them. Any one wishing to learn Krav Maga at home should buy these DVD's and then sign up for the classes that go with this DVD.  The quality and the support is great.,1479254400,,347,4.17910447761194

I am also a smaller person and when looking at the short clips I thougt it would be worth checking out since the person in the video clip didn't look like a big guy, so I ordered this DVD set but my friend told me not to open it before I watched his copy first.

7049604,2,B00UK7552Q,"I will have to give him an A for effort, however like one other reviewer mentioned it is highly unlikely this instructor has ever been in an actual confrontation, let alone had a gun pointed at his head. As a former law enforcement officer with 40 years experience in the martial arts, I can attest that many  of the techniques on this series are extremely dangerous to attempt. Once adrenaline kicks in, it is extremely difficult to execute the weapon takeaways as they are performed here. Although the instructor means well and demonstrates some proficiency, he seems a bit young to have had any actual street fighting experience. In addition, the sound effects that he makes when executing techniques becomes almost comical at times. Although this series shows some good basics, the majority of the movements will only work on a cooperative opponent in the dojo. I recommend you get one of Jim Wagners Reality based DVDs for more practical fighting techniques.",1469836800,3,963,4.944444444444445

7049606,5,B00UK7552Q,"This is an outstanding resource for any krav maga enthusiast and a very welcome addition to my ever-growing self-defense and martial arts dvd and book collection. A bit of background before I get to my review: Ive studied krav maga for a total of about two years at a local facility but, recently, my instructor more or less retired. The only other facility in my general area is quite a drive from where I live. Hence, Im mostly continuing on my own or with a partner or two when I can muster them; but, I wanted to better organize and structure my training and thats why I purchased Total Krav Maga.

Ive had the dvd set for about a week and a half now--long enough to view and analyze the materials, using my previous training as a frame reference, and to begin practicing the techniques and participating along with the recorded classes. Ive also read the downloaded manual to which one has access after receiving the dvd set.

Approach: The overall approach to krav maga presented in the introduction and throughout is very good. Michael South, the instructor, is very clear about the differences between krav maga and more traditional martial arts and emphasizes, rightly, its pragmatic orientation. I also appreciate that he emphasizes that even successful execution of techniques in a confrontation or attack does not render one invincible. Rather, the idea is to avoid harm if possible and minimize it if this is not possible. This is very realistic: training won't make you Superman, but done properly it should significantly increase your chances of getting home safe.

More generally, South is a genuine teacher. He is an expert but not at all condescending; rather, he seems to enjoy sharing his knowledge with others rather than simply displaying his mastery of the system.  Another sign of a good teacher: the proficiency of his students. The two students who participate in the recorded classes are both skillful practitioners themselves.

Techniques: The demonstration of techniques is excellent. Souths demonstrations are fluid and dynamic. The formatfull speed demonstration, breakdown, and further demonstration from multiple anglesis very conducive to understanding how a technique works and how to perform it. The quality of the camera work, production values, and editing is similarly excellent. Furthermore, South explains concepts and techniques clearly and accessibly. I especially appreciate that he takes time to explain why a particular technique is effective in a given situation and what its trying to achieve. This approach folds nicely into another point that he makes throughout: krav maga is less about perfectly executing a technique and more about grasping fundamental principles of self-defense. (Or, as my instructor liked to say: If it works, its krav maga!) The overview of blocks is especially welcome. Frankly, my live instruction in this dimension of krav maga has been limited and the instruction here very much helps to make up for that.

Organization: The design and structure of the dvd set may be its greatest strength. A fair number of dvds about krav maga or combatives are available, a few with decent demonstrations of techniques. What sets Total Krav Maga apart is the obvious thought and care that have been put into designing a comprehensive training program that clearly lays out a course of progress. While Im not pursuing rank through this program, at least not at the moment, I greatly appreciate having a structure in place for moving from the basics to more advanced techniques.

Moreover, the four complete classes are invaluable; its incredibly convenient to be able to get back from work, set up the heavy bag or grappling dummy, and then go through a complete class in my own home (or in the park across the street). One real advantage of training at or near home is efficiency. In my experience, even well-organized live classes entail a lot of extra time and downtime: commuting to and from the facility; waiting in line to sign in at the desk; setting up mats and getting equipment out of the supply closet; waiting five or ten minutes for stragglers to arrive; etc. Even a 90 minute session was often more like 40-45 or so minutes of actual instruction and practice. Here, each 30-minute class is focused and requires an honest effort from start to finish. Plus, the sample sessions provide a very useful template for designing ones own classes to emphasize whatever techniques one feels need work.

Overall: This is a fantastic set of dvds and a great value. For those who are skeptical that an at-home training program can provide quality instruction (I was one of them, admittedly) Total Krav Maga is a shining example that outstanding instruction can happen in any format, so long as the student is willing to put in a lot of work. And South makes it clear that he expects students to work hard!",1459123200,16,4869,4.972972972972973
7049607,5,B00UK7552Q,"I love this workout program. I'm a 47 year old female, and I find it challenging but doable. The first three DVDs are instruction, which is clear and concise. I really enjoy the actual workouts. To be really serious about this, one needs a partner with which to practice.",1456099200,7,271,4.551020408163265
7049608,5,B00UK7552Q,"I have been involved in martial arts/self defense for more than 25 years at the time of this review. I was first introduced to Krav Maga while serving in the U.S. Marines and learning hand to hand combat. It was one of the major styles that were integrated into what we used and were taught. I have earned three black belts during my martial arts training and am always interested in exploring new products and the evolution of self defense. I purchased this DVD set on Amazon.com. It arrived very quickly and as described by the seller's listing. I'll continue the review by covering three main points; packaging, production quality and content. Let's begin:

1. Packaging

  The DVD set comes as in a box set style package with each of the 5 DVDs in their own individual cases. I found the box and plastic cases to be of good quality and not flimsy, cheap feeling like one would expect from a $1 unknown movie from a dollar store. The Cases were labeled very clearly and gave great detail on the reverse side. The DVDs were not loose and scratched as the cases were well designed and held them in place through shipping.

2. Production Quality

  These videos were well produced and did not give off the feeling that someone recorded this with a cellphone or in a living room. The lighting was great and the camera angles were spot on. There was no apparent shaking of the camera and the editing was on par with what one would expect from a professional quality product. The sound was consistent and clear as they were wearing lapel mics. The DVD menus were user friendly and very easy to navigate.

3. Content

  The content of this beginner set is very well organized and complete. It is very basic information if you are familiar with martial arts but it is necessary in order to be a true beginner's program. It does progress as you go along and provides very clear instruction with every new technique. Multiple angles are shown for each movement and demonstrated both with and without a partner for clear viewing. The techniques are on par with what I've seen and experienced with other Krav Maga instructors with a few minor variations. This set is great for anyone looking to get into Krav Maga or just add some tools to their skill set.

Conclusion

  Overall, I believe this DVD set is a great value and very beneficial to anyone of any skill level. As I stated earlier, this does contain some very basic information at the beginning but no so much that an experienced martial artist couldn't gain some useful knowledge. The instructor is a natural teacher and very easy to understand and follow. He shows a high level of skill and does not display any arrogance, which is very refreshing. If you are an instructor looking to add something to your instruction or a student looking to supplement your training or someone brand new to Krav Maga and looking to use this as a home study course, you will find a very valuable asset here in a sea of junk. If you are considering purchasing this DVD set, do yourself a favor and pick this one up. A job well done to Michael South (the Instructor) and the Hodge family at the Total Training organization.",1453939200,14,3158,4.572695035460993
7049609,1,B00UK7552Q,"Very Disappointing Material... As a police officer with 22 years on the job, I am always on the lookout for good self-defense training. I also look at training from a civilian point of view because I want to have my family trained as well. This material is HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING. The majority of it will not work against a violent perp or someone who seriously physically assaults you. I thought that this DVD set looked good. However, after watching it, especially, the weapon defenses and other potential deadly force scenarios, I can't in good conscious recommend this instructional material. I also feel like a belt ranking from the instructor would be worthless. While the guy makes a few good theoretical points, I don't believe this instructor has any real-world experience or good krav maga/self defense training. I know first hand that fights and attacks can be serious; deadly serious. In short, I am afraid this training will not help. I suspect there is much better krav maga training and videos available than this and I am going to try something else. I do not recommend this set.",1453852800,9,1093,4.881720430107527

7049612,3,B00UK7552Q,"I was disappointed with this video set. Several of the techniques shown would not work well in a real life self defense application. A couple of examples that come to mind are the recommendation to do a 360 defense elbow to wrist vs wrist to wrist: Elbow to wrist 360 would significantly slow down the time to grab the attacker's wrist in a knife defense, which could potentially get the defender killed.  Choke from behind with push into a wall: significant space between defender's bicep and ear prior to turning toward attacker as shown in this video reduces the ability to break free from the choke. To be fair though, the packaging was good, and the disks did arrive in good condition, timely manner and excellent customer service, and the lighting, sound quality, camera angles and description albeit inaccurate at times were at least easy to learn from.",1452038400,3,860,4.8108108108108105

An Israeli background has exposed me to useful and effective krav maga which has been proven through years of use in the IDF by family members and friends. This DVD set displays wrongful applications and uses of variations that can jeopardize you own safety when in the line of attack. I urge not to utilize this as a representation of what true effective krav maga is, and by no means should you let this taint your perspective on what krav maga truly is and its practicality for hundreds of different applications. In krav maga their is a broad spectrum of possible variations and ""styles"" that can work for some individuals and not for others, however this does not fall in between those lines.",1448668800,5,801,4.854014598540146

8707149,2,B00UK7552Q,"Video material is good, video quality is good don't get me wrong. What I really don't like is that many techniques are the standard commercial Krav Maga moves that will, as proven in subsequent years by the general public, get you killed in a real life confrontation as they they assume compliance by the assilant. Not recommended unless you like to see ""classic commercial"" Krag maga defense (i.e. to practice a sport and NOT self defense)",1520294400,2,440,4.802631578947368
8707150,5,B00UK7552Q,"I must first say that I am by no stretch of the imagination an expert martial artist., or even a serious student of it... however, I worked as a Correctional Officer for 28 + years, and had quite a bit of defensive tactics training, and have some SCARS (Special Combat Aggressive Reactionary System) although limited.  I heard of Krav Maga long ago, and decided to see what it was all about, and after reading lots of reviews, decided to go with Total Krav Maga, and I although I am not too far along, I am thus far very impressed with the thoroughness of the training.  In many aspects it reminds me of DT training from my Corrections Officer days, but is far, far better in that the DT we were instructed in was more or less defensive in nature.  Being older now, and realizing it takes a lot longer to heal up, and also feeling my age (52), I was wanting something to enable a ""quick ending"" to any possible altercation that may arise, while minimizing bodily injury to myself.
I like the way that the combatives & techniques are taught.  With the multiple views and explanations these are a very good way to get a basic understanding of the methodology of Krav Maga, and with time & proper training should fill the bill quite nicely.
I also appreciate that the instruction isn't arrogant, but genuine. Glad I purchased this, and am looking forward to learning from it.",1519948800,2,1372,4.520161290322581

8707155,1,B00UK7552Q,"I have many Krav Maga books and videos and bought this to add to the bunch. Some of the material seems very effective but I must say I am very disappointed overall.  A few examples of many....In the overhead stick defense, if the attacker were to let go of the weapon as I performed the 360 defense the momentum of the stick would not stop and I would be in danger of being struck in the head.  In gun from behind, after disarming and striking why wouldnt I use the cold weapon to strike instead of an elbow?  A gun is much harder than an elbow not to mention the risk of injury to elbow in a dynamic situation.  Even the most simple thing such as fighting stance is flawed.  The instructor is standing square with his groin wide open.  A much more effective stance would be bladed turned to the side in order to reduce his/her targets while protecting the groin.
Someone completing this course and believing they are intermediate is sorely mistaken in my opinion and could get hurt. I cannot,with good conscious, recommend this course.",1487289600,3,1036,4.48404255319149

I think they are what I was looking for and look forward to continuing with the course. It truly is education and instruction. Many DVDs offer fantastic Krav Maga self defense but no real detail or step by step. These DVDs do that. Also, I have had a few questions and they were quickly answered by the instructors. I am not sure what else I would be looking for in an at home course.",1484611200,3,548,4.179245283018868
