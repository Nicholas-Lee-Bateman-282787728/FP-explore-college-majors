3478212,4,B001B15SQS,"Almost 5 stars!  Susan is a pretty ""girl next door"" with natural pubic hair and a wonderful on-camera presence.  She offered lots of action poses that would be very useful for an aspiring comic or graphic novel artist. Aside from the figure reference aspect, she is just lovely to watch.  I like the fact she does not wear high heels. I also have the Phylis module, and have viewed the trailers of the other Optik Dave DVDs. I have the usual nits with the camera work and editing, but I think this is a great buy.",1260748800,6,513,4.322916666666667
3478213,3,B001B15SQS,very pretty model...all these videos are pretty much the same. but few different movements..I bought Theresa's all so and she does have a larger bustline and like to shake it. Doing jumping jacks and dances..Only a couple of closeup of body parts that the photographer catchs so use the Zoom.,1259107200,,292,4.86
3478214,4,B001B15SQS,"I have a few video productions of these nude figure modeling videos from Optik Dave and for the most part, I think they are pretty high-quality in terms of picture and production quality. The Phyllis module here is no exception, although it suffers from a few common detractions that have plagued other videos in this series such as poor sound and video editing, lousy music and dvds that sometimes stubbornly refuse to play easily.

What really makes this one work for me is the model, Phyllis. She is very attractive with a face not at all unlike that of actress Jamie Lee Curtis ; in fact, she could probably pass for a younger version of JLC. She has an attractive, in-shape body and does look nice naked. She has near-perfect, all-natural, medium-sized breasts and refreshingly has no tattoos, no piercings. In fact, she is just how I like my women: unenhanced, unadorned and unperforated. The only attribute about her I didn't care for was the fact that in the actual video she has dyed-blonde hair even though she's clearly a brunette naturally from the picture on the video case cover. Jeez, when will so many girls stop dying their hair blonde? Why can't they just have the hair color nature gave them?

In the video, Phyllis covers a wide variety of poses and actions, from facial expressions to walking, stretching, sitting and fighting. In all of the scenes she is either clad in a slinky little lime-green dress or fully nude. (She even does naked jumping jacks at one point -- yeow!) The camera mostly holds steady angles on her all from one distance, but it does move in on her for a close-up in one scene. This video also contains trailers and previews for several other videos in this series from Optik Dave following the feature presentation. Overall, a good figure-modeling video that should be a very helpful visual tool for artists, sculptors, video game designers or just anyone who's a connoisseur of the female form in its all-naked glory.

Now for a few minor grievances I have with this disc: I'm not sure if these discs are copied as dvd-r's or dvd-rw's, but they won't always play right away or refuse to load easily when inserted in the disc tray. Once it finally loads it will play no problem, but it often takes the disc several trys before it will actually play. Just a slight kink that the producers should take note of and fix if possible. Secondly, the background music in this series is nothing short of atrocious ; it's lousy, worse-than-elevator-style, new age music that just plays on a continuous loop over and over again, never failing to annoy its involuntary listener. This is why my title suggests this one may be better to watch with the sound off. True, Phyllis does talk and provides some narration/explanation as to what poses she is doing, but this isn't really necessary as each chapter is introduced with a title explaining what actions and poses Phyllis is doing for that scene. Plus, some of her comments are already drowned out by the afforementioned awful background music. Just put it on mute and enjoy Phyllis's beautiful naked form and jumping jacks. Watch this one for the visual asthetic.

Final Review: 3.5 Stars",1238284800,5,3173,4.742753623188406
3478215,4,B001B15SQS,"I admit I'm not an artist but I think this DVD will benefit the real artists that are contemplating buying this or any of the other models available in this series. The DVD is similar in format to figure reference books that are widely available. Teresa is shown moving in numerous varieties of poses and she is nude or nearly nude throughout most of the video. Looking at the menu will give the viewer the option of choosing what poses to study. The DVD is pricey but I can't complain because the video quality is very clear.

I deducted one star because the video and audio editing was poorly done. For example, you'll see Teresa doing one thing then the scene jumps to her doing something else with no explanation. She comments throughout the video and some scenes her mouth can be seen moving but there's no sound except the background music. The poor audio editing may actually be a positive because some of Teresa's comments sound like something straight out of a porn video.

Overall I am happy with the video just because I think Teresa is attractive, has a nice figure, and, as far as I can see, does not have any tattoos or pierced bits.",1215734400,3,1147,4.509615384615385
3478216,5,B001B15SQS,"This is one of the best videos out of many I have purchased on Amazon.com.
Picture quality is great, much better than the average. The model : Andrea, is really nice, she has a beautiful face and great body, she clearly enjoys shooting the video, and has no problem appearing nude on video. In Europe she would qualify as a naturist, as being completely at ease with nudity.
She takes many poses, some academic, some playful. Music is very basic (the same 6 second music phrase gets repeated once and again) but this is not a classical music concert video anyway ?
The model makes a presentation on some scenes, reading what seems to be a panel hidden from the viewer. She has a playful tone, and it is refreshing to see her getting some fun.

Video says 101 minutes long, but Andrea only appears during around 80 mins. The last 20 minutes are shots taken from other videos produced by the same guy, ""Optik Dave"". These other models are clearly less beautiful than Andrea, and I will not spend a dime on the other ""Nude Female Reference"" vids.

Definitely 5 out of 5 stars.

I've been often disappointed by the poor quality of some videos sold on Amazon, but not this one : I greatly enjoyed it.",1214870400,4,1195,4.472477064220183

3478221,1,B001B15SQS,"I have been looking for video's that are like attending a real figure drawing class.  After reading the discription of what this disc had, I ordered it.  Boy was I wrong!!  For true artist looking for a model, look somewhere else. The video says that she is showing movement to get more life in the drawings, but the model hardly gets into charater.  She half-heartedly throws a punch and says she's mad.  Her ballet is the only part worth anything. The video almost never shows her below the knees (my figure drawing teachers all called pictures not showing below knees or past elbows as porn).  This is just a way to sell a naked woman on video and pass it off as art.",1286582400,4,670,4.40650406504065

3478226,3,B001B15SQS,"I generally agree with reviewers Phillips and DaVega, but I did not experience any playback problems.
I would have preferred Phillis in fewer poses with high heels, along with unbleached hair, and I would like to have seen more action poses with realistic weapons.
I also have the Susan module which I like very much.  Both modules have excerpts from other modules including Teresa, who has a heavier figure but a funny wise-cracking narrative.  Some of the remaining Optik Dave modules also look interesting but seem to be unavailable(?)",1262995200,,538,5.033707865168539

8280928,3,B001B15SQS,"As I write this review in February 2013, I am surprised that others rated it so highly.
I must admit to only viewing the preview that was included on another Optic Dave production, but can say Teresa has an ample ""Rubenesque"" figure.
Susan, Julie, and the Nude Stories model I find much more attractive. However, Teresa does have a very fun personality.",1361232000,,353,4.709677419354839
8280929,5,B001B15SQS,"The model, Lisa, is absolutely stunning! From the product description I was expecting a little more action type poses. One scene she holds a football, does a few poses and spends way too much time throwing the football to someone off screen, camera left. I'm being picky, but it would have been much better had she thrown the football towards the camera and off screen camera right as well. What about a shot of her hiking the ball? Would have been great if they had put her on a treadmill and shot her from all sides. Lisa is by no means an athletic girl and not used to ""fighting"" or being tough, but she is totally naked for 99% of the video, so 5 stars.

The previews show the other models available. If you're looking for beautiful models, Lisa is the only one worth getting.  Perhaps the one titled Blonde, but not the others. The producers would do much better getting Lisa back, do some better pre-production work, so they know what to have her do, and have her redo the other girls videos.

Still nice work.",1333670400,2,1016,4.422459893048129
8280930,4,B001B15SQS,"Model is slim and attractive, with a lively personality.
Not the best video for the portrayal of anger and fighting(the Susan Module is better for punching and kicking), but Julie does a good job swinging a sword. In short, 5 stars for the model, and 3 stars for the overall production.",1326844800,,286,4.627450980392157
