8519197,3,B007KWD7MY,"The latest IMAX 3D Blu-ray release, Arabia 3D, takes the viewer
on an exploration into the mystery and mystique of Arabia.  Directed
and produced by MacGillivray Freeman (The Living Sea, Everest)
and Narrated by Academy Award winner Helen Mirren (The Queen),
the film attempts to give an overview of the Arabia's culture, religion
and history.

It's actually the very first movie ever shot in Saudi Arabia. And in
case you were wondering, the movie Lawrence of Arabia was actually
lensed in Morocco.

The film opens with a with a stunning view of the Red Sea's
underwater life as our narrator explains that the scalding desert
sun would normally cook most of its corals. She then goes on
to suggest that these reefs have had to adapt just like the
people of Arabia.

In telling this story, we are introduced to Hamzah Jamjoon,
an Arabian film student who is shooting a documentary of a
journey that depicts ""who we are and how we got here.""  This
documentary concentrates itself on Arabia's two Golden Ages --
one of wealth and the other of knowledge.

Going back 2000 years ago, we learn of the Nabataens who
were responsible for the first Golden Age and its wealth created
by the trading of frankincense, a resin obtained from trees of
the genus Boswellia.  We learn about the dangerous trek across
the deadly Arabian desert by European explorers in 1876 and the
discovery of the lost city of Madain Saleh.

The Prophet Mohammed and the quest for knowledge was the
driving force for Arabia's second Golden Age.  The Kuran provided
a simple instruction to understand the world as tribes unified in
their belief of one God, making them a potent force that conquered
more territory than the Romans in half the time.  The documentary
goes on to explore Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud who united all the tribal
lands and laid the groundwork of the present Saudi Arabian state.

Photographed in in 65mm and  transferred at up to 8K resolution,
Arabia 3D is rather stunning to watch on the large home screen.
From the vivid colors of the reefs and life below the Red Sea to
the ariel shots of Saudi Arabia's large cities -- all the visuals are
presented with utmost clarity.  Colors and flesh tones are very
accurate and black levels are more than acceptable.  Filmmakers
effectively used the Imax 3D cameras to shoot their sequences
behind natural objects which provide a terrific sense of depth. One
of the most memorable moments for me was when the camera
takes us inside ancient tombs where its narrow, cramped dirt walls
makes the viewer seem somewhat claustrophobic.  The underwater
sequences are particularly amazing to watch, with its colorful fish
and coral reefs.  It's the kind of IMAX imagery that seemingly jumps
right off the screen.  Speaking of which, only a few items project
themselves towards the viewer, most notably the film's opening credits
and later, the nose of a camel.  Other than that, the 3D becomes more
about perceiving depth than having objects thrown towards you.

The DTS-HD MA audio is quite robust.  Narration clearly resides
in the center channel. Steve Wood's beautiful score featuring
Middle Eastern musicians and singers surround the viewer as
does many of the film's effects that include sandstorm winds
across the desert and bubbles beneath the sea.  LFE response
was barely audible.

Arabia 3D is presents the feature in both 3D and 2D on a single
Blu-ray disc.  Included is an interesting Making of documentary that
reveals how Saudi Business people approached the filmmaker,
wanting a documentary made of their country so that Americans
would have a better understanding and appreciation of what an
Arab is.  There is some insight given to the IMAX process as
well as what it took to capture the grandeur of the hajj pilgrimage
in Mecca with its gathering of 2 million Muslims.

Also included is a History of MacGillivray Freeman's large
format films as well as a nice handful of IMAX trailers (none
of which are presented in 3D).

I wouldn't exactly recommend Arabia 3D as a title one needs
to immediately add to their collection.  The documentary was
mostly created as an educational overview of Arabian history,
religion and culture in helping the world better understand their
people.  The IMAX 3D footage is generally breathtaking, and
for those with an interest in Arabian history, this title serves as
a simple introduction to it.",1453075200,,4367,4.880758807588076
