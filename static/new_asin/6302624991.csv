Kyung-Wha Chung is my favorite living violinist. She was a prodigy that moved from Korea to New York at age 12 to study with the renouned pedagague, Ivan Galamain who also taught Perlman, Zukerman, and Rabin to name a few. She later studied with Joseph Szigetti who was my favorite violinist before Oistrakh. When I heard her CD ""Con Amore"" I knew she was as good as any player who ever lived.
In this video, Ms. Chung plays the Mendelssohn Concerto, probably the most popular of them all. This is a work that requires feminine sensitivity in the first movement and masculine technique and control in the last movement.
The violin concerto was filmed in 1989 with Georg Solti conducting the Chicago SO.
It is clear that every note came from inside her, never was there a note without meaning. Ms Chung plays with such incredible emotion and completely effortless technique, she has the ability to play with such grace and beauty and then turn around and stun you with demonic technique. My mom even said it looked like she was in tears when she was playing. It is funny but I have heard this Concerto so many times and for the first time ever I think I am falling in love with the music.
The sound quality is fantastic and far superior to the Mintz VHS of the Mendelssohn Concerto. I really enjoyed the Mintz video as well but this one I like more.
For CD recordings of the Mendelssohn I like Heifetz, Perlman, Szeryng, and of course Ms Chung's recording.
If you are lucky enough to get your hands on this, be prepared to be blown away by her emotional offering.
