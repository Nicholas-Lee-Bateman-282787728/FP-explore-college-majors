8290064,5,B001CU7WC6,It is hard to believe how the circumstances developed and this pilot was able to survive the war and live to tell his story. I did not know that American pilots were imprisoned in extermination camps instead of POW camps for American pilots. Outstanding History Channel DVD and really informative on little known events that happened during WW II.,1394496000,4,347,4.898305084745763
