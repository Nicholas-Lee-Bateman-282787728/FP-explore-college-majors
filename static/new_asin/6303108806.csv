Unfortunately, due to certain circumstances, the movie got shelved only to come out 2 years later, under a different name  (""KNIGHTS OF THE CITY""), & a different look & feel to it. Nonetheless, although quite corny & badly acted, it's still a great piece of 80s nostalgia for those of us that experienced it first hand & still love the 80s. The DVD arrived in great condition & earlier than anticipated & the picture quality is very good.",1480723200,2,587,4.59047619047619

Received it in timely manner. Wish they also had DVD of this movie for my collection.",1456963200,,341,4.181818181818182
