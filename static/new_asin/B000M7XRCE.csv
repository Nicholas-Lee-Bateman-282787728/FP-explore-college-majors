2726124,5,B000M7XRCE,"The Cartoon Network is known for its kooky Adult Swim, with everything from ""Robot Chicken"" to superhero lawyers.  But few of their shows can match the comic brilliance of ""The Venture Brothers,"" whose first two seasons are combined here -- it unabashedly spoofs ""Jonny Quest"" and other kiddie adventure fare, with plenty of sarcasm and weird characters.

It's about the adventures of Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture, who was once a child genius, but is now a fortysomething has-been who is still overshadowed by his adventurous dad's legacy. Now he has two not-so-bright teenagers of his own, Dean and Hank (""Go Team VENTURE!""), as well as the sweet robot H.E.L.P.eR. And finally there's his lusty, secret-agent, mullet-haired Swedish bodyguard Brock.

In these two seasons, the Venture Brothers (plus Rusty and Brock) face the Monarch, a second-rate villain who desperately wants to be Dr. Venture's nemesis, and his deep-voiced sidekick Dr. Girlfriend. They also have to deal with a crazy Walt-Disneyesque mogul, the steel-jawed Baron Underbheit, and the Guild of Calamitous Intent (whose leader is someone we're all familiar with).

And they must also deal with many other problems -- mummies, chupacabras, the repeated deaths of the twins, failing space stations, evil Egyptian cults, bad porn, testicular torsion, necromancers, Japanese demons, ""Venturestein,"" aliens, sex changes, ghost pirates, and even a Christmas episode where they get crashed by a strange Christmas spirit.

A series like ""Jonny Quest"" is just asking for a spoof, and ""Venture Brothers"" happily obliges. But in fact, it also mocks  all unrealistic action-adventure, from the Fantastic Four to the ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" Where else can you find a villain's henchman arguing who would win in a ""crazy fantasy fight-fight between Anne Frank and Lizzie Borden""?

And while many series get lamer as they get on, ""Venture Brothers"" starts off well -- in the pilot, which is included -- and gets progressively funnier. Even the death of main characters is treated with irreverant sarcasm. t's full of adolescent gross-out humor (the Monarch and porta-potties), gory action, and occasionally a sex scene for Brock.

But what's REALLY brilliant about this series? The scripting, which is often crazy and unabashedly sarcastic: ""I have watched you pull a man's eyes from his head and make him dance like a marionette with his own optic nerves!"" "" At least I didn't break his heart."" If anyone says anything serious, it's just a windup to the punch line (""What's he doing now?"" ""He's making his dramatic exit"").

Patrick Warburton and James Urbaniak are utterly perfect as the indestructible super-agent Brock and the bitter Venture, with Michael Sinterniklaas as the ultra-naive Dean. Christopher McCulloch does several roles, particularly the know-it-all Hank and the whiny-voiced Monarch. And Steven Rattazzi gets a special mention as the melodramatic necromancer/single dad Dr. Orpheus. Love that guy.

""The Venture Brothers"" have exactly the kind of adventures that kids dream of NOT having, but the adults will love the first two seasons of this richly absurd show. GO TEAM VENTURE!",1172966400,45,3163,5.333333333333333
2726135,5,B000M7XRCE,"Any show with characters such as David Bowie (OK he WAS in Zoolander but Bowie as in Scary Monsters', Major TOM?) and the German singer Klaus Nomi can't be beat!  I watched Jonny Quest as a kid and loved the animation and great sound track.  The Venture Brothers is just as good and is MUCH funnier....... when people of a certain age have to explain the jokes to the young - the sign of greatness, like the old Warner Bros. cartoons!",1217635200,,434,4.345679012345679
2726136,5,B000M7XRCE,"...in the sense that the way things are priced right now, you'd be better off buying seasons one and two separately. The combined package is just seasons one and two shrink-wrapped together, but they charge $10 more for it.

But yeah, buy these. Watch them. Love them.",1216857600,9,268,4.702127659574468
2726137,4,B000M7XRCE,I had to get both seasons after watching season two on adult swim. I enjoyed the episodes even more then before. Everyone of my friends that have seen one episode has become a fan. The only issue I have is that neither set is in the widescreen format. Amazon clearly stated that they were. Other than that buy them now!,1215129600,,319,4.333333333333333
2726138,5,B000M7XRCE,This is a great set.  Enjoyed both seasons and will be able to watch over and over. Worth the money.,1214352000,,100,4.0
2726139,5,B000M7XRCE,"This show is one of my favorites! It's very and clever very, very funny. It's a great twist on classic cartoon network cartoons. At times it is pretty crude, but enjoyable all the same!",1213228800,,185,4.470588235294118
2726140,5,B000M7XRCE,"This show was way under-rated when it was on the air, now that I've seen both seasons I realize I had forgotten how funny it was.  I'm psyched to see that there will be two new seasons airing on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in the next year.",1211846400,,241,4.127659574468085

This is a great comedy spoof of the 60s and 70s cartoons like Johnny Quest.  Really funny writing in this series, as seen late nights on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.  You will love this series!",1209254400,,386,7.533333333333333
2726142,5,B000M7XRCE,"The product itself is (of course, awesome and) intact (including all packaging), working properly.  But it did arrive later than I had expected by about 5 days, and completely soaked in something greasy!  I think my college's mail room repackaged it (explaining the delay) so that it could be handled with the other mail.  The product was okay thanks to the plastic lining, but I have no idea how that mishap could even be explained....",1208476800,,436,4.786666666666667
2726143,5,B000M7XRCE,I THINK THAT THIS IS THE MOST ENTERTAINING SHOW IN THE ADULT SWIM CARTOON LINE UP.,1207526400,,82,4.1875
2726144,5,B000M7XRCE,"The Venture Bros. is currently the funniest animated show on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim roster. It's equal parts Jonny Quest (and characters from that show make hilarious cameos from time to time), Reservoir Dogs, Harvey Kurtzman-era Mad magazine and something completely original all at once.

Jackson Public and Doc Hammer have created a unique world of neurotic, pill-popping super-scientists (the type who invent anti-gravity rays and make backups of their death-prone teens in an underground cloning lab), equally neurotic costumed villains with highly dysfunctional romances, and ultra-violent government agents who aren't happy unless they're snapping necks and slaughtering waves of henchmen. The show manages to integrate old-school pulp fiction with post-punk humor and tons of pop-culture references, and the result is hysterically funny. Think Austin Powers as written by Hunter S. Thompson, and you'll get an idea of how funny this show is.

The DVD's include commentary on some episodes, as well as deleted scenes, a hilarious mockumentary on the history of Astrobase Go, and most importantly, the original pilot for the show and the insanely brilliant Xmas special.

If you're a fan of the show, this is the best way you can spend $42.99. If you're not a fan of the show - god help you.",1203292800,9,1303,5.285024154589372

This is one of the few shows on the tube that keeps me from turning my TV into a nightstand. It's hilarious, blows Family Guy and the like out of the water. Seriously the creators deserve an emmy, it's that good.",1191110400,,329,4.32258064516129
2726153,5,B000M7XRCE,"If you grew up watching cartoons in the 80's and early 90's this show is for you.  It draws from and parodies many of the staples of those decades.  It's got it all: Action, Comedy and Brock Samson!",1185667200,5,198,4.184210526315789

I love the rediculuos take on super hero/villany and Brack Sampson pwns!  These are not seperate episodes, they go in order, and they tell a captivating (and very silly) story.  Supposedly Season 3 ties it all togather in some true realizations!  Suspense! Intrigue! Scooby Doo dies painfully!  Johnny Quest is addicted to smack! Why is that women's voice so low?  All can be yours when you own these DVDs.  Where the heck is season 3!!!??",1221782400,,614,4.726415094339623

8166930,5,B000M7XRCE,"I purchased the DVDs after having seen all the episodes when my friend lent them to me. Normally, I will only watch my favorite episodes once I buy a DVD set of a show I've already seen because there's nothing new to see, but in the case of ""The Venture Bros."", the show has such a dense storyline that repeated viewings are a must.

The show is a great send-up of the old 1960s cartoons, mainly an homage to Johnny Quest but also containing both overt and subtle elements of probably every major cartoon from that era. The plot is simple but the mythology becomes very complex as the story unfolds. Dr. Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture, son of the late great super scientist/adventurer Dr. Jonas Venture, is now the head of Venture Industries, his father's research company.  He's not too great at the super-science thing, so Venture Industries is a shell of its former self, and Rusty lives off of his father's name and achievements. He brings his two sons, Hank and Dean, along on his adventures as his father did with him, and as such they are naive and socially inept and also stuck in the 60s in a sense. His bodyguard, Brock Samson, is a killing machine but simultaneously is a kind of nanny to the boys. Dr. Venture needs a bodyguard because he has an arch-nemesis, The Monarch, who is his own kind of incompetent. Together with an ever-growing cast of supporting characters, the travails of the Venture family unfolds.

This show is hilarious, and has dialogue that you will be quoting well after having seen the episodes.  For someone who has grown up seeing the 1960s cartoons on Cartoon Network, and who is pretty tuned in to pop culture in general, the frequent references and callbacks are great.  What's more, if you're looking to get into a show that is imaginative, intelligent, funny and builds upon itself at every turn, this is the animated series for you.",1217721600,2,1868,4.648484848484848
