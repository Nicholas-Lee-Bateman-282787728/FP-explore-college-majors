It makes a very good point on the value of a relationship between men and women.. Buy it..",1408579200,,183,4.411764705882353
1810206,4,B00007GZR2,"I remember seeing this film when it came out (I know I'm dating myself here) in the early 80's.  I have always been a huge fan of Tim Matheson and, although she is a lousy actress, thought Kate Capshaw was adorable.  I really wanted to have a copy of this film for my TM collection.  I am so glad I bought it and, frankly don't know why I didn't already have it!  I remembered that it is a time capsule of the worst and, I must say, funniest examples of the terrifying decade which IS the '80s.  From the BIG hair and ridiculously short jogging shorts, to the color combos and frighteningly ugly decor, this film is a microcosm of that decade!  It was a really good laugh.  Please understand that this film was every bit as funny and saucy as I remember it.  However, I did not recall it being so graphically (for the time) and blatantly sexual, in both language and content.  I had truly recalled it completely differently.  I can't remember laughing so hard at a, very dated, film in a long time.  Wallace Shawn and Edward Herrmann are hysterically funny and inciteful.  Tim Matheson is at the height of his ""hunkdom, and his long muscular gams and tight bottom are fabulous in the aforementioned abbreviated jogging shorts.  The saucy script is perfect.  And, every profanity is perfectly placed!  Want a journey into the past?  You can' go wrong with this one!",1388534400,,1364,4.506122448979592
1810207,5,B00007GZR2,"I love this movie so much that it was nice to see that women knew how to dress like a woman, & not like how that they dress today like a man which us guys are to blame for the way they dress today as i love the way they show off there bodies & legs & i think that is absolutely beautiful in the way that they express themselves & most of all of there beautiful faces to go with there figure & charm, i love it. Call me an a#@hole but,all you beautiful women know what i'm talking about. The best thing that i love about this movie is the way in which his wife finds a way to forgive him for what he has done to her which i would feel sick to the bone if i did that to the one i love so much but, finds a way to move forward & that's an insparation to me which i find a hard to do still to this day but, i am learning & a movie like this makes me think to look much clearer if you love someone that much, you should try to get over the bad experience, talk about it & move on with a better outlook on life. A very educational movie for me as i'm sure that it would be to others who think like me.
Awesome movie..........!

1810208,5,B00007GZR2,"This movie very good. Love the time period and Kate Capshaw is excellent . Great humor and tons of sex. It even has some nice action scenes where Kate Capshaw hits Tim Matheson with a baseball bat and breaks his ribs for cheating on her. Has alot of emotion and easy to get watery eyes if you're not careful. Love that this was filmed in NY and Edward Herrmann was damn funny in this as well. I would have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time it's a real gem. I believe this is the first movie with Kate Capshaw, she is a real doll. Love me some young Kate Capshaw mmm, she is pretty darn cool.

I highly recommend this movie for anybody who loves comedy with a twist of drama and sex!! 5 stars easy....",1346889600,,719,4.063380281690141
1810209,5,B00007GZR2,"This is a funny film! I loved its free spirit. Tim Matheson is pitch perfect as Michael, a young man who sincerely loves his wife and is struggling to be faithful to her due to his wandering eye. Kate Capshaw is wonderful as his smart, gorgeous wife. Edward Herrmann is very funny as Michael's brother. The film has great chemistry between Matheson and Capshaw. The film benefits from a well-written script, solid performances by the supporting cast, and excellent character development.",1301270400,,487,5.0246913580246915
1810210,5,B00007GZR2,"For years i was a fan of this little guilty pleasure. Tim Matheson plays a young video director who marries his sexy girlfriend, played by Kate Capshaw ( in real life, Mrs. Steven Spielberg).However, theres one slight problem: he cant stay faithful. What to do, what to do, lol. A great comedy about the trials of love and commitment.",1233100800,2,334,4.677966101694915
1810211,4,B00007GZR2,"The leads are charismatic, Edward Hermann is good in everything he does.  Most importantly, in addition to some decent character-driven comedy, physical and verbal, (remember the scene where Matheson is trying on the wedding rings?) this movie actually sketches out how you move forward from animal cravings to having a loving relationship.

It's not particularly profound, and sure, it feels a LOT like a TV movie.

It sure felt realistic to me, in this one way-- it really did feel like Matheson's character was trying to understand how to love somebody without thinking of himself as some sort of martyr to monogamy.  And I did feel like Capshaw's character had some backbone, unlike other female leads in similar comedies.",1205280000,4,726,5.07563025210084
1810212,1,B00007GZR2,"The plot of this movie centers around one of the most ubiquitous of human traits:  the male libido.  Is it possible for a man in possession of an above-average sex drive to be devoted to one woman?  Or will his loins always win out?
Certainly, this is not the 1st movie to address this question.  However, typically the best venue to engage the topic is via the Romantic Comedy.  Instead, this movie is a drama that takes itself way too seriously.  In the end, it comes out being more sappy than anything else.
One of the aspects I liked the least about the film was its glorification of smoking.  I realize that smoking is supposed to be sexy & erotic, but I have never got into it.  In this movie it simply comes across as dirty & sleazy (much like the plot-line!).  I swear that Tim Mattheson doesn't go a single scene w/out lighting up;  it gets old really quick.
The one highpoint of the film is Kate Capshaw as the virtuous but betrayed wife.  She is certainly very loveable in her role, and the film dates from the prime years of her film career.
If you're looking for a movie with a similar plot-line, but done much better, check out JUST A LITTLE HARMLESS SEX.  The latter is also funny, while the present film is bereft of humor.  If you pick this DVD up I can almost guarantee that you will be bored with the result.",1081641600,4,1327,4.323886639676114
1810213,1,B00007GZR2,"Despite game attempts by Tim Matheson and Kate Capshaw to generate heat, ""A Little Sex"" fails to ignite a single spark.  With a script entirely devoid of situational tension or even tittilation, the viewer is  left wondering why this film was made.  When I first saw this movie, in a  theater in the year of its release, I would've walked out had I been the  one to drive.  (I later had the misfortune of producing a cut-down trailer  for TV.)  I hadn't walked out on a movie since ""Juggernaut"" in  1974 or 1975.  The only recommendable thing about this movie is the fact  that you'll be watching it on video and will have something (the tape  itself) upon which to vent your rage.  You will be in a rage when you've  wasted time on what could possible be the most boring movie of all time.  Don't believe me?  Give it a try, but when you start feeling the life-force  being sucked right out of your skull, don't say that ralph@loop.com didn't  warn you!",913852800,6,954,4.416184971098266

It took me a month to watch the whole movie as I was determined to get through it. The best part of the movie was children's snake story Tim tells at the end of the movie that had everyone crying!

A chick flick maybe .... romantic comedy .... where the guy is a heel, somewhat a victim of circumstance, but a heel none the less, and he really has to prove himself to get back in the good graces of the female ... it's cute, romantic, and even though I am a guy .... I like romantic films, and this was a feel good flick",1416096000,,422,3.8505747126436782
