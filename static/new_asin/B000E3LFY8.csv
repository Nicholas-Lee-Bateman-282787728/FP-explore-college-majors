8140212,5,B000E3LFY8,"~~~An intimate evening with Nhojj

Entering into an atmosphere so perfectly intimate.

Be prepared to leave all the crazy world noises behind.

Here it's quiet and comfortable, easy.

As I began watching this CD I felt like maybe I was trapped in time. Like everything was moving in slow motion.

Not because I was disinterested or bored but because I was impatient for what might happen next.

These feelings diminished quickly when I realized time really was going way to fast.

I wished that I could slow or even stop time and remain in this place.

Before me is a man with a voice of an angel.

Intimately performing some of my favorites.

Lost/Found, So sultry and heart pounding realization and acceptance of truth, acceptance of reality. I can feel the journey inside from Lost to Found.

I can see the joy of realization on Nhojj's face, I can hear the freedom in his voice. ""It don't have to be like this"" ringing true.

An a capella version of ""Faithful"" with vocals so emotionally pleasing that instrumental music is really unnecessary.

It's almost as if I have become invisible for just a moment and I am looking in as Nhojj is singing this song to the one it was written for.

I watch, eyes wide open, as he reaches so deep within himself, way down inside his soul.

I have to try and catch my breath when he begins to pour out his words because I can feel him pouring out his heart inside those words.

When the sound of his voice reaches my ears I experience the memories and experiences he is holding out fully for all to share.

He looks back, drawing from the past, putting every soul at rest with ""Wade in the Water"".

Yes,you can feel the love, the peace, and even the pain.

You can hear the love and emotion with every breath, every note.

A then a wonderful surprise. A poem ""A New Me""

Nhojj is a brave heart for baring all he holds dear inside for all to see.

For share in his life changing journey of finding peace within himself.

I see vulnerability supported by a strong self confidence, a beautiful self confidence with no sign of arrogance.

A self awareness supported by his ability to transcend all pain and show there is hope and love.

I have watched, I have listened with all of my heart.

With ""More Love"" a hope for love and peace, I realize how wonderfully easy it has become to leave the crazy world noises behind.

I have not just heard the exhilarating voice and searching revealing words. I have not just heard the music and the poetry.

I have heard the heart and soul of a man who is fighting for love in the most powerful way, by showing love.

And in the process my heart has become even more clear to me.

As the DVD comes to an end I cannot help but to try and reach inside myself for the peace I have found on the stage with Nhojj.

In him you can see the humbleness and satisfaction of connecting and sharing what to most of us is sometimes too personal to share.

For this my world is a better place.

I know my heart is stronger and my love is freer than it was before
