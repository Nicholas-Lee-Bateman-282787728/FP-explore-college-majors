8265498,5,B0017APPVQ,thanks abunch,1449360000,,13,6.0
8265499,5,B0017APPVQ,"I got both this and Volume 1 and would like to correct what is being said in some reviews (and on other sites)

if you get Volumes 1 & 2 you do in fact get ALL 28 episodes of the Lone Ranger cartoon series.

Volume 1 has 11 of the 22 minute episodes

Volume 2 has 5 of the 22 minutes episodes and the remaining 12 shorter episodes

And of course all 13 Zorro episodes are included so the Volumes are in fact complete

I have included the liner notes as proof

Now if only the Tarzan series were released...",1419465600,5,506,4.01
8265500,5,B0017APPVQ,very well done series the lone ranger segments grand and told of the early days of our great nation in away that was fun and entertaining to young children with all of the fun and charm of the asked man tonto and the horses silver and scout.,1388016000,,241,4.148936170212766
8265501,5,B0017APPVQ,"Awesome collection, it's too bad these shows
don't air anymore, these throwbacks contain what's lacking
in childrens entertainment today. Double feature of the
Old west most nostalgic and beloved heroes ever created
without super powers. Perfect air time episodes for one
to enjoy without feeling unsatisfied. This is a good buy
and makes for a nice gift for the holidays.",1254182400,,372,5.216666666666667
8265502,5,B0017APPVQ,I bought this set because of the Zorro Series. Between both Volume 1 and Volume 2 all Zorro episodes are included. The Lone Ranger episodes are not completed. Still this is satisfying for the Zorro episodes.,1231200000,2,207,4.777777777777778
8265503,5,B0017APPVQ,"Filmation made som of the best cartoons when I was a kid and wathcing these programs reminded me why they were so good. There was a lesson that had to deal with the episode and also there was some form of restraint on the violence. They mayt have used a lot of stock footage, but the movements of the Lone Ranger & Zorro were more life like and loved the stories.",1226361600,,363,4.126760563380282
8265504,5,B0017APPVQ,this is a great dvd set and better than the original cartoon's of the 60's cartoon's of zorro and the lone ranger. get vol. 1 to.,1219968000,,129,4.0
8265505,4,B0017APPVQ,"I remember watching these adventures as a child, and I'm very grateful for their release on DVD. Filmation maintains its high quality standard of mixing great adventure with educational lessons (in this case, facts about the Old West and Mexican/Spanish History). It would be nice if some contemporary cartoons would incorporate more educational and/or life  lessons into their format as children continue to need these lessons given to them from sources in addition to the home. Finally, as Western Tales are not very commonplace in today's entertainment world, it's nice to have the adventures of Zorro and The Lone Ranger to relive on DVD.",1219795200,5,642,5.173076923076923
8265506,3,B0017APPVQ,"According to the articles I've read online,
If you buy Volume 1 & 2, you'll get:
18 of the 28 Lone Ranger stories
All 13 of the Zorro stories.
The way I see it, this leaves them with 10 Lone Rangers and no Zorro stories for a potential Volume 3.
14 Lone Ranger stories per volume would have wrapped things up nicely for both shows.
I can only hope they still put out a 3rd volume anyway, to give us the remaining Lone Ranger stories.
Failing that, I'll feel rather disgruntled about having spent my money on the first two volumes, but it's too early to complain yet.",1210032000,11,566,4.25
