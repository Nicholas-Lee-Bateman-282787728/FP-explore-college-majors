8088105,2,B000BKSJCK,"In Volume 2 of Loki Ragnarok we get even more Norse gods descending to the Earth in various forms, some with shady motives but all suspected of following Odin's order to kill Loki. First, there's the ""Mystery Thief Frey"", who is really the god Frey, who is pulling off all manner of heists around the city, and is so confident that he even informs the police of the crimes beforehand! But they still have not been able to catch him. This is all part of Heimdall's plan to lure Loki into a trap because when Frey announces he will steal the ""Brising Necklace"" Loki finally agrees to investigate the case. Heimdall hopes to use the necklace on a young girl named Reiya, who is actually the goddess Freya, who loved Loki but whose love was never returned. Unlike Loki and the others though, her human form has no memory of her true divinity and instead she seeks out Loki because she is having terrible nightmares and seeing ghostly apparitions. The last episode on the disk lets Yamino and Mayura take centerstage as Loki is taken hostage by some bankrobbers. He could get out of the situation easily, but he puts his two friends to the test to see how they'll function without him.

Loki Ragnarok is a series that I feel has reached a deadend, at least to my taste. I think it is a show that will appeal to younger viewers instead of a more general anime fan. The fact that Loki walks around with a familiar named Ecchan resting on his head that looks like a big spot of bird doodoo and makes baby noises and the fact that Frey's familiar is a flying mechanical pig doesn't really help my impressions of this anime. Heimdall, instead of coming off as a villain, comes off more as a Dr. Evil with lines like ""This isn't over"" as he gets away every time Loki and his gang close in on him. Don't get me wrong. This show isn't bad. It just fails to interest me with its Scooby Doo storylines.",1154476800,,1887,4.3914285714285715
8088106,4,B000BKSJCK,This series is great. It really grippes you and makes you on the edge of your seat. This is an excellent edition to anyone's collection. I can't wait until volume 4 comes out.,1139356800,,175,4.333333333333333
