8474824,1,B00556E0D2,"I bought this DVD with the intention of showing it to my high school art history students. Unfortunately, it was so boring I could barely sit through it myself. The constant reference to the blazing sun of Spain is more than annoying ~ it's a waste of time. It would have been more valuable to hear a discussion of El Greco's unique painting style and technique. Too bad that most of the art history DVDs I have purchased turn out to be dull as dirt, presented by British art historians who themselves have absolutely no color or talent for public speaking. This purchase was a waste of money.",1364688000,9,593,4.5
