664380,5,6303471501,"How can you not love this cheesy low-budget film from down under?  Mel is great as Max, whose family is killed by a nomadic biker gang.  The heartless and stone cold Max sets out bent on revenge, hence  ""Mad"" Max.  Violence is as plentiful as the high-octane chase  scenes.",923011200,,273,4.489795918367347
664381,5,6303471501,"If you don't have Mad Max already, get it. When you do, see it for the fun, the violence, Mel - and then see it for the story construction. Mad Max is a classical and elegent heroic epic. The film is actually three  films. The first focuses on the fall of Goose, Mad Max's foil. The second  is the fall of Mad Max, from family man to rogue samari. The third is Mad  Max's revenge. Road Warrior is good, but not as carefully constructed.  However, Mad Max: Beyond the Thunderdome is a wonderful addition to the  triology because it is essentially a modern retelling of Exodus. Mad Max is  a type of Moses who leads the children to the promise land(Sydney) from the  hands of ""ignorance"" and brutality ""Romans/Egyptians"".  This is a film of Mad Max's redemption.",916531200,,760,4.4963503649635035

664496,5,6303471501,"A bona ride CLASSIC, which retains its status as such. Quite frankly, I am a bit suspicious about the number of one and two star ratings this film has, along with the three or four word review attached. A bombastic performance from Gibson, whose pending SUSPERSTAR status was clearly on display in his first major film role, combined with incredible action sequences and a straight-forward revenge plot that will have you glued to your seat and cheering aloud when the mighty fist of vengeance is struck hard and squarely in the faces of those who murdered his family. As far as people complaining about the supposed lack of a plot, I wonder about which film you are referring to, as I don't think the plot could be any more straight forward. Despite cranking out quite a few great films, the Australian film scene was barely recognized before this film came along and shook the foundation of Hollywood, as well as the low budget indie scene so hard, it put Australia on the map and helped to raise the profile of the country and its movie output for years afterward. A worthy purchase and an excellent way to spend a few hours.",1509408000,,1128,4.616915422885572

664545,4,6303471501,"This is a 1979 action movie set in the ""near future"" about a dystopian society in Australia.  The movie provides the breakthrough role for a then, young, Mel Gidson.  The are a lot of high speed car and motorcycle chases and stunts.  The movies seems to me to be technically solid.  It also sets the stage for sequels.  I can easily see how this movie may appeal to some viewers and not to others.  I respect other opinions, but I just cannot enjoy a movies like this.

I watched this movie while visiting relatives.  It is not normally the kind of movie I would take upon myself to watch.  One may want to take that into account in regard to my review.  If a viewer is like me and does not enjoy gratuitous violence, one may not enjoy this movie as a viewing experience.  This movie reminds me of some of the extremely violent movies I saw as a youth at drive ins.  I sort of liked them then.  I have to admit, don't mind seeing extreme ""bad guys"" get what's coming to them, but I hate all the violence against innocent victims that sets the stage for the inevitable climax.",1499990400,,1075,4.288557213930348

664621,3,6303471501,"Mad Max as the first film in the franchise, perfectly sets up the world to come. Society is teetering on the verge of collapse. Biker gangs terrorize desert highways on decaled Kawasakis and law enforcement operating from their crumbling Halls of Justice has dwindled down to a few pursuit units calling themselves the Main Force Patrol. A revenge film at heart, 'Mad Max', despite its budget, has tons of great stunts, impressively staged vehicle sequences and an emergence of the iconic style its later installments are famous for.

Despite the movie being set in a near future dystopia, I did not see much about the scenery that looked dystopic.  I understand that the movie was made in 1979 and I should not have 2016 movie expectations, but I think they could have done more with the story and scenery.

So cool watching again as an adult.  It's been 30 years at least since the last time I watched the original Mad Max.
What a great movie!  I had forgotten nor probably never appreciated how stylized and subtle were the themes, costumes and acting.  The original Mad Max remains quite the masterpiece in Cinema.

While I heard the remake was quite fun, being an endless relentless orgy of car crashes and chases, I am glad I had the reminder of Mad Max's roots.  More so seeing the dystopian, apocalyptic and imaginative themes that have been inculturated into our popular culture, i.e. Burning Man and other similar festivals.

The American dubbed version was bland and overall aweful. This version includes both with two variable audio options for both. Plus, it came with new commentaries and trailers of the film when it came out, as a bonus. Loved it, be forewarned though. One part in the movie eluded a rape scene. It didn't show anything, but you could tell what was about to go down. ( It shows a girl being taken out of a beat up car by a psychotic biker gang. ) Besides that, a must buy.

669498,5,6303471501,"The film that started a franchise. George Miller's masterpiece.  Made on a shoestring budget using actual bikers, his own car, and many unknown cast members, including a young Mel Gibson. Mad Max is a thrill ride with only short pauses in the action so you can catch your breath!  Miller's use of cameras attached to vehicles give the audience an incredible perspective of speed.  A technique that has been used by directors in action movies ever since.  I loved this movie when I saw it as teenager and later when I bought my first motorcycle, it was a Kawasaki.  The sequels are probably better films overall, but this one launched the series.  I have been a fan of Mel Gibson and George Miller ever since.  If you get the DVD, you can switch between the dubbed 'American' version and the original 'Australian"" version.  The US distribution company didn't think American audiences would understand the Aussie accents, so they hired voiceover artists from Speed Racer!  Captain Fifi Macaffy as Pops!! For years, that was the only version we could get in the US.  It wasn't until the DVD was produced could we get the original sound.",1462406400,,1133,4.764102564102564

669628,5,6303471501,"This review is for the Collectors Edition from ""Shout! Factory"" released in May of 2015. The picture here is as good as you will ever see this film. Ditto the audio. I just watched the whole thing complete and the extras are quite good, being very informative and never boring. Mel Gibson has some good anecdotes and leaves no doubt that this is the ""accidental"" movie role responsible for his rewarding career. Joanne Samuel has plenty of things to say as well. Remarkably, she has the exact same hairstyle as she did 35 years ago during filming. There's quite a bit of David Eggby who talks at length about the perils of the production including the financial situation. (My latest VIDEO WATCHDOG reports the total cost at about $400,000.00 and since they never make a mistake I'll stick with that). Director Michael Pate makes a short appearance with a story about how he directed Mel in his movie TIM just before MAX was released. He bemoans the fact that after the release of MAX he could not afford to hire Gibson for another of his films so rapid was his rise to stardom. That gave me quite a laugh because if you have ever seen TIM, where Gibson plays a mentally retarded yard boy to Piper Laurie, you would probably believe, as I do, that Gibson would not have done another film with Pate no matter HOW much money he was offered. Finally though,, The best thing about this particular Collectors Edition, if you are a REAL collector, is that when you peel off the shrink wrap you can carefully take  the artwork folder out of the see-thru plastic, reverse it, re-insert it and PRESTO!!! You have the original 1979 poster art for your disc. That's why it gets that 5th star and makes it worth the price, for me anyway.",1462406400,,1725,4.546623794212219

Obviously the visuals are not at the same level since this came out in 1979 but that didn't matter to me after the first few minutes. This is a great movie and and it streamed in HD. I normally do not watch and enjoy pre-1990s movies but this on just got added to the short list. I didn't really understand the story line at first since I watched the new one and was expecting this one to be similar. This ones description says ""Mad Max is a chilling drama that combines a futuristic plot with high-speed car and motorcycle action"" and this didn't seem in anyway related to the new one or futuristic but in the end that didn't matter! After I finished the movie I watched the trailer for the sequels and then it made sense to me how this one is related to the new one.

I like the character, there just isn't much of him, and nothing to really showcase his villainy other than hissing, ordering the assassination of a manikin, and attacking a car with a meat cleaver.

671016,5,6303471501,"Mel Gibson finds his feet in the role of Max, a quietly intense man who suffers for the cause of keeping the law in a land where society has just begun to collapse.

First off, for anyone who hasn't seen this film, but is aware of the Mad Max franchise mythos, this is a more subdued and grounded movie.  There are roving bandits, but they haven't quite decided to deck their vehicles out like horrific carnival floats.  And the stakes are simply keeping law and order this time around.

But as a fairly low budget and grounded film, it's very effective.  It does move a little slow, but but it keeps a pace.  Generally, things are always happening, and characters have things to do.  It's not an aimless movie.

This is where the Mad Max character begins, so you get to see a serious character arc from him.  And it works.  Mel Gibson is just perfect in the role.  He can go from stoic, to relaxed and jovial, to hell bent without even trying.  And it stands out as a just plain good character performance.

This doesn't have the same grandeur and theatrics of the sequels, but it's just a darn good, deliberately paced film.  And it has a great human element to it.  So while it's not as much of a thrill ride as the movies that came after it, it's still a really great film in a franchise that's had some real watershed titles in it.  Definitely check it out.",1460592000,,1362,4.345238095238095

Watching the Blu-ray in 1080p was stunning.  The Blu-ray version does show some grain, but the film is much clearer than previous DVD releases.  The original Australian audio was pretty good, with a few places where the voices were a bit muffled by the sounds from the engines.  The American dub audio was still comical.

As it stands, this is the best picture / audio release of the film to date.  The film is right at 30 years old, and by today's standards it was a low budget film.  There is always a chance that we will get a caring, full digital restoration of this film in the future.  Maybe in a special Blu-ray box-set?  Who knows?

The story involves an outlaw biker gang terrorizing the outback area of Australia.  This once again characterizes Australia as a mainly rural state, the image apparently still most prevalent in America, even though Australia is more urbanized than America with most of its people living in six major cities.

Much of the story involves high-speed car chases with Gibson belonging to a special police department only slightly less violent than the bikers.  The film manages to generate a lot of exciting action without any robots, aliens, or special effects.  It is one of the best police movies ever made.",1446940800,,777,5.03125

I never saw the original Australian version, but it was still enjoyable. Only confusing part of the movie is the setting. I knew before watching it that it is set in some sort of future apocalyptic scenario, but that is not explained until road warrior was made. It's like they forgot to explain what is going on in the world and automatically expected the audience to indulge in Max's story in this crazed world. Still enjoyed it none the less.

The leader shaves an eyebrow and wears eyeliner! He's even, apparently, bi- or homosexual! In fact, to enjoy this movie, you have to be able to overlook its homophobia.

672787,5,6303471501,"This movie gave me one of the deepest feelings of unease around the line between civilization, where we can feel safe and protected by shared laws, and utter barbarism. It shakes you from the comfort of easy western living and makes you think how so many unfortunate live under horrible conditions with their lives dictated on the whim of warlords, madmen, and gangsters. The world in this film never tells you whether you should feel ""safe"" because there's ethical law enforcement and a system here or maybe you should feel ""unsafe"" because the system and those enforcing it are just vestigial theater and evil crazies roam freely. By rooting for Max in this film you're rooting for the movie's world to resolve to the safe version. He stands for ""Law and Order"". Not in the ""Republican"" sense, but rather in the sense that we're only safe in a society with a skeleton of a shared moral bearings. Whatever broken parts of that skeleton exist, we need it. Otherwise its the sophistry and dictates of mad men who just happen to hold power that hold sway over us. Max stands in for the barely breathing system here. It's not one ""man"" vs crazies. Max is the tip of a rusting spear -- the legal system he works for. You root for it, for him, because without it there's no basis for hope. When that last breath goes out of the general shared good of ""law and order"", of trying to consistently right wrongs and find justice, then there's no more reason to build a home, live a life, make plans, or become succesful.

I'd seen Max Max 2 (Road Warrior) and Beyond Thunderdome but not the one that started it all. I can see why this low budget film is a cult classic. Quite different than the high-budget sequels.

When watching this film, the women swoon when they see the Highway Patrol Officer Max Rockatairsky (Gibson) and declare, ""...what's not to like?"" about this new, young, superstar-to-be. The guys, see the movie and love it because of the fast race cars and their design, the turbo-charged engines sitting halfway on the hood, the macho motorcycles which they ride into the ground and the vengeance that is rendered.

The villain, Toecutter, is wonderfully evil (trivia: he's played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who is also the bad guy in the most recent film, Mad Max: Fury Road).  It is exciting, but it leaves you with a sense that the story is unfinished--which it is.

Don't really know why they don't just say it's a western...revenge and shotguns and fast cars (horses) and great showdowns.
I cannot believe Mel Gibson ever looked like this, very handsome. His pretty, blue eyes just come through the screen. There are lots of shots of him strutting around in tight, black leather and a pair of white, see-through pants. Lots of shots of him staring into the camera and lots of shots of him walking away....nice shots of him walking away.....and a scene of him sitting with nothing on but a wet towel....legs and all......lots of Mel....

674004,5,6303471501,"There are a lot of films focused on the post-apocalyptic era and a lot of films focused on persons consumed by the need for revenge, and sometimes the two cross paths.

What Mad Max does differently, and better, is that it sets itself right before ""the fall"" as some might call it, and so we can see and appreciate fully what all of it means.

The film takes place in pre-apocalyptic Australia: things are getting worse and worse, society is crumbling, and cops like Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) are struggling to hold it together. There's a particularly rousing speech given by Max's commanding officer to try and keep him from quitting the force when life starts getting too hard for him, one that really illustrates just how bad things have gotten and how sorely good men are needed to keep everything from going to Hell in a handbasket.

But quitting the force doesn't mean quitting the world, and Max finds out that the bikers he enraged will stop at nothing for revenge, and once they've had theirs and he has nothing left to lose, we see the fall as Max Rockatansky becomes the most dangerous man on the continent.

The visuals are stellar, especially with the upgrade to hi-def. Australia has some naturally gorgeous environments, On top of that, the car chases (and crashes) look better than ever, the kind of stuff you don't see much of anymore, which is truly a shame (unless you are a Fast & Furious buff or own season NASCAR tickets).

The acting is believable, and that's what sells it. You don't need a cast of decades-built legends to make the characters come alive, you just need them to be people trying to find answers in an increasingly broken world. Max tries and fails to be a cop, so he tries (and tragically fails) to be a husband and father, leaving his only success in the single-minded pursuit of vengeance.

Maybe you'll love this and maybe you won't, but if you don't give it a shot, you really are mad.",1433376000,,1932,4.585507246376811

674059,1,6303471501,"Watched this on the back of Fury Road, which I enjoyed recently at the theater. There's no comparison - I kept thinking that somehow Amazon was showing the wrong Mel Gibson movie, or that we might have somehow picked the wrong movie entirely, by accident. Got about 40 minutes into it, couldn't take any more. Why? It's bad acting all around. The musical soundtrack is too loud in parts to hear the dialog (it was the original Aussie, though that adds only slightly to the challenge). And it's supposed to be set in some dystopian near-future, but the cues to that are very spotty and confusing - the inside of the police station is run-down, but the yard is pristine (I would think it would play out in the opposite order). Gibson's character has a happy homelife, there are still functioning highway restaurants (i.e., commercial life). Maybe it just hasn't aged well, but at this point, you'd have to be a real Gibson fan to sit through the whole thing.",1433116800,3,956,4.629411764705883

674143,5,6303471501,"First  off  Max  (Mel Gibson)  has  got  a  good  life,  he  lives  right  on  the coast.  He's  got  a  pretty  wife  &  a  close  friend  Jim Goose  (Steve Bisley).
The  beginning  starts  out  with  the  nightrider  who's  escaped  from  prison  &  killed  one  of  the  prison  guards.  &  is  on  the  run  to  join  the  motorcycle  gang  where  Toe Cutter  is.
After  everybody  else  fails  to  stop  the  nightrider  it  is  up  to  Max  to  finish  what  they  started!  He  stops  the  nightrider  after  a  10  mile  chase.  But  is  not  aware  that  the  Toe Cutter  (Hugh Keas Burns)  is  not  going  to  take  it  too  lightly.  They  go  around  harassing  the  towns  people,  tormenting  the  heck  out  of  them  &  destroying  a  car  beyond  repair!
Goose  is  a  good  officer  &  is  eager  to  bring  these  guys  to  justice,  &  tries  starting  with  Johnny  the  boy,  but  cannot  hold  him.
I  liked  Jim  Goose,  he  was  happy  even  in  this  uncivilized  after  war  future.  He  gets  ambushed  after  his  motorcycle's  gears  lock  up  on  him  &  he's  sent  flying,  a  friend  loans  him  a  truck  but  he  runs  off  the  road,  after  a  tire rim  is  thrown  through  his  windshield.  Then  gets  set  on  fire.  Afterwards  at  the  hospital  Max  does  not  want  to  believe  that's  his  friend  in  there  suffering.  &  who  can  blame  him?  Jim Goose  was  near  death,  &  he  looked  awful!
Max's  boss  Fifi  (Roger Moore)  gives  Max  time  off,  Max  had  said  he  wasn't  coming  back.  So  he  takes  his  vacation.  To  forget  things  about  Gooses  horrible  accident.  Him  &  Jesse  unexpectedly  run  into  the  Toe Cutter.  Who's  following  eager  to  settle  a  score  over  the  loss  of  someone's  hand.
Max  &  Jesse  soon  arrive  at  May  Swayze's  house,  on  her  way  back  from  the  beach  she  knows  something  isn't  right,  but  she's  unable  see  the  gang  because  they  blend  very  well  with  the  trees.
She  too  has  a  bad  accident  from  the  gang  &  loses  one  arm  &  one  leg. But  their  child  was  ancient  history!  &  Max  knowing  now  he's  got  nothing  left  steals  the  V8  police  car  &  hunts  the  gang  down  for  some  payback!!  Short  work  is  made  from  4  of  them,  &  the  Toe Cutter  gets  crushed  by  an  18  wheeler.
Johnny  the  boy  got  it  worse  then  any  of  them,  he's  the  one  that  threw  the  match  when  Jim Goose  died,
Max  handcuffs  him  &  sets  down  his  cigarette  lighter  with  a  flame  burning,
&  the  truck  blows  up. Both  accidents  were  from  gas  leaking.
At  the  end  Max  does  not  return,  just  keeps  going.  No  destination!",1433030400,,2701,4.218678815489749

Let me be more specific: The plot is predictable. The acting is 100% over the top but not in the fun way. The music is random and distracting. Mel G hadn't even become good looking when this was shot. It's much like the movie that Tarantino's Death Proof is an homage too, except Death Proof is well-made, funny, horrifying, and interesting.

674550,5,6303471501,"As someone who grew up with original Mad Max films, I was totally excited to see the new film and also to get back to the originals. Unfortunately the new film is just a ghost shell of its predecessors. If you like your films where the central male character is second banana to a bunch of female rouges then you'll love Fury Road. Max is reduced to a secondary character that takes orders from the female lead for just about the entire movie. George Miller has pretty much made a feminist film here with Fury Road and I have to wonder if he was able to do so because the backing for the film came from feminist groups. It's no secret that Miller had been trying to get this film made for the last 15 years. On again off again reports would drift through media for years but never really giving explanations for why it couldn't come together. Money and backing is usually the reason for films not being made and possible he finally found his funding through feminist groups. Or maybe making all those kids films turned on his maternal side and he just wanted to empower woman in a action film. But to do it at the expense of one of the great action characters of the 80's is unforgivable and a slap to his own face, though I doubt he would see it that way.
As far as the original Mad Max film, it's still awesome today. It's gritty, edgy and it's real visuals. All the cool chases and wreaks are real and not cgi. The bizarre characters and humor also add to the viewing experience as well as watching Gibson take control of his character making it his own. There will be no other Mad Max like Gibson and that was even  more obvious watching Tom Hardy's horrible interpretation. It's just to bad that Mel showed his evil side to the world and pretty much ended his career. I think had all that stuff not happened, he would have been playing Max in Fury Road.

Finally you feel an emotional response to the film in the form of outrage at the injustice committed by outlaws.  You then become excited to see the retaliation that will surely fill the remaining half hour of the movie, with action packed justice.  This never happens.  A quick, anticlimactic, and somewhat unintentional death falls on the character you hate the most, while the slow, clever, and painful death is given to thug that may not be innocent but is at least conflicted about killing on behalf of the gang.  Maybe if I had friends to make fun of this movie with, it might have been fun to watch, but I don't, and it wasn't.

674692,5,6303471501,"One of the best Australian films ever, very raw film-making/Directing by George miller for sure
even thou it's Mel Gibson first film it's still Great acting performance
aswell as Actors Steve Bisley-Jim Goose, Hugh keys byrne who plays Head Gang member Toecutter
Actor Tin Burns-Johnny the boy, Actor Vince Gill who played the Demented Night rider
and Actress Joanne samuel-Jessie, Max's wife in the film
all these actors had originally come from NIDA National institute Drama Art school
the best Dramatic acting school in Australia
not to mention George miller's Directing, and David Eggby's cinematography
and the incredible haunting music score by Aus composer Brian may, not Queen Guitarist Brian may
plus all the stunts in the film, very convincing stunts, car chases all that is really done in the film, no CGI, no camera tricks
what you see on the film was caught on camera, no camera tricks all done for real

the first blu-ray release by MGM had no extras at all, just barebones
so as a fan that was an insult i didn't waste my money
Scream/shout factory got the rights to the MGM DVD release and finally released the respectable version
i have no regrets buying this new blu-ray reissue
the new High definition transfer looks fantastic, very clear & sharp picture quality in 2:35:1 widescreen
shout factory really made the effort with the transfer for sure better quality than the old MGM dvd
plus scream/shout factory made the smart Decision to carry over both the
Australian & American Dialogue soundtracks to this blu-ray from the MGM DVD version
i've heard some scenes with the American Dubbed accents, it's terrible it really does wreck the film
so of course i switched to the new Australian 5.1 Master audio mix and the sound quality is incredible
sounds Great through my surround sound system
there's also an AUS Master audio stereo mix added if you prefer to listen to the stereo mix instead
i believe all fans will want to watch the film with the Australian Dialogue, not the Thought was best option American Dubbed version

scream/shout factory also made an effort to add new special features something that MGM would never do
MGM would just recycle the old dvd extras
a new 29mins retrospective featurette with Mel Gibson, Actress Joanne samuel & Cinematograher David eggby
who all give recollections acting on Mad max
Actress Joanne samuel who plays Max's wife in the film Jessie
talks about how she got the acting part, her experience acting with Mel, and Hugh keays-byrne
working with George miller etc
David eggby recalls shooting the scenes with George miller, gives some interesting behind the scenes stories
and so does Mel Gibson of course
Definitely an interesting 29min featurette
plus all the special features from the old DVD release have been carried over
MAD MAX THE FILM PHENOMENON, a 40min retrospective with interviews with
Director of photography David eggby, special effects artist Chris murray & Tim ridge and Art director Jon Dowding
MAD MAX-THE BIRTH OF A SUPERSTAR which is a documentary about Mel Gibson himself
and how he became famous from his role in Mad max
plus the Audio commentary from the MGM DVD release has been added to
you also get still Photo Gallery, Theatrical trailer
there's reversible artwork cover like all scream/shout factory blu-ray's, so if you don't like the new 2015 artwork
just switch it around for all the original Theatrical poster artwork

worth the money for sure, this blu-ray is region A locked so
Mad max fans outside the U.S. will need ALL REGIONS player
Definitely time to upgrade get this new shout/scream factory blu-ray, not the old MGM blu-ray
5 stars for the film, 5 stars for this blu-ray",1431388800,18,3675,4.905144694533762

674855,4,6303471501,"I've seen ""The Road Warrior"" countless times, but have only watched ""Mad Max"" once before, and if this is any indicator, ""Mad Max"" was one of the first films we rented when we got our new VHS player. With ""Fury Road"" coming out in a few days, I wanted to re-visit the whole series, but I have to admit I wasn't really looking forward to revisiting ""Mad Max"". My memory of this installment was that is was a bit slow and dull, and that Max was a very different character from what I had seen in the sequels. (Of course I was probably 11 o 12 when I did originally watch this?)

In the near future in the Australian outback, Max is a cop working on the fringes of whatever society remains. He and the other members of the MFP spend their days patrolling the roads, and as the film opens we see that several members of the MFP are in hot pursuit of a cop killer called the NIght Rider. Night Rider and his girlfriend have stolen a police interceptor vehicle and are raising havoc on the highways. Several attempts to stop the Night Rider by the members of the MFP fail, and as each cop is put out of commission it's becoming clear that the only person that can stop Night Rider is Max. But when Max finally does bring down the Night Rider he becomes the target of Night Rider's Ggang, a motorcycle gang lead by a lunatic called Toe Cutter. Toe Cutter swears to avenge Night Rider's death by taking out the MFP.

With this viewing I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed Mad Max"". The story is your simplye revenge based action film, but the style of the movie is off the charts. Aamazing stunt work, kinetic caction, the camera never sits still and there is alwasy something visually eye-catching about th""Mad Max"". I was kind of surprised at just how small a role Mel Gibson has in this first film. Max is a background character for a good portion of this movie, and really doesn't grow ino the title character until the last 20 minutes or so.

There is a fun energy to this movie, and you can't help but get caught up in the frantic acticion.",1430870400,2,2037,4.31331592689295

674974,4,6303471501,"Please Note: This review is for the Scream Factory reissue of ""Mad Max"". If you order this directly from Shout Factory, you can get it before release date by nearly a month.

""Mad Max"" has been released on DVD and Blu-ray numerous times over the years. Scream Factory's (a division of Shout Factory) latest edition takes the previous special features from the MGM release and combines them with some new special features.

SPOILERS:

Set in a brutal postapocalpytic future where motorcycle gangs terrorize those on the road, Gibson plays Max a police officer who patrols the wide open roads protecting the innocent. Max faces his most difficult foe Toecutter (where do they come up with these names?)who ends up attacking Max's family.

END OF SPOILERS:

Mel Gibson got his first major notice in the U.S. due to ""Mad Max"" as did director George Miller who went on to make three sequels as well as ""The Witches of Eastwick"" and produce ""Babe"" (and directing the sequel himself). Miller's film influenced an entire genre (including influencing John Carpenter who wrote and directed ""Escape From New York"" when he caught an early screening of ""Mad Max"")

The transfer appears to be from th same source (but has been cleaned up considersbly)from the  previous MGM and Warner release on Blu-ray but this reissue has its own issues and does appear smoother looking with less grain visible than the MGM.  The transfer also has some issues with compression including digital noise (which can appear as clumps of excessive grain).  It's cleaner looking with the damage evident with the MGM largely taken care of as well. Speckles and dirt hwve all been digitally removed. The MGM has a higher bit rate (which also might explain the lack of digital noise that crops up from time to time on this release) but, as was evident in the Blu of ""Sorcerer"", when transferred with care that shouldn't have been an issue here.

It's not a huge difference one way or the other. While it isn't perfect, it looks pretty good (although with a little more care, it could have been a perfect transfer). There are some minor issues that crop up from time to time and, while a fresh, restored 4K transfer would have been nice, this edition looks as good as the previous ones but with different strengths and weaknesses. The problem is that the original negative is missing so all editions are pulled from existing prints with digital restoration done to them.

So which looks better? It's honestly a trade off with both have different strengths and weaknesses evident.

The audio, as with the MGM, includes both the original soundtrack with all the actors voices as well as the Americanized version with a really bad dubbing job. The Scream Factory edition features the Australian English soundtrack in a lossless 5.1 mix as well as a the U.S. English dubbed track as a DTS-HD master mono presentation (which, again, mimics the MGM Blu-ray).

Imported over from the original Blu-ray are the commentary trck with art director Jon Dowding, DP David Eggby, special effects artists Chris Murray and Tim Ridge. ""Mad Max: The Film Phenomenon"" is also carried over. It's a solid documentary that runs around 25 minutes.

We get new interviews with actors Mel Gibson, Joanne Samuel and DP David Eggby.  The clips in the interview segments are oddly transferred and don't look as good as they could. ""Mel Gibson: The Birth of a Superstar"" is also new to this set (it has some jitter issues thst occurred during the authoring process that Shout should have corrected or caught during the QC phase) as are the photo galleries. Theatrical and TV spots are also included.

I'd still give this set 4 stars for the exceptional special features and, while the transfer isn't perfect, it's pretty good.

So should you upgrade to the new Blu-ray if you have the MGM? Not unless you have to have the new special features.",1429401600,6,3874,4.827794561933535

The continual horrors that happen to max, his friend and finally his family are good reasons to do what he did in a vigilante way.  His anarchy is the result of anarchists who ruin his life and that of so many others in their destructive path.  The action is primarily the road and dealing with cars and motorbikes not anything special or unique beyond what is usually shown in such movies. in fact, I've seen TV series with better action, like Knight Rider.  LOL  The acting is great, the villains make you want to hate them(for a B flick not half bad) and Gibson's emotion to the horrors of his best friend and family is gripping, I would probably do the same thing if given those circumstances.

675691,5,6303471501,"The first Mad Max movie is a total classic, with so many amazing shots, great stunts, larger-than-life posing, and some horrible ultraviolence. It has plenty of cheezy bits, but keep in mind that even those are still way superior to the they-should-have-known better bits of the third film (and possibly also our deepest fears of the Gibson-less fourth film out next years after 25 years in studio hell - never a good thing). Plus, it's nice to hear Max talk from time to time, rather than the ""strong, silent type"" thang that he does in the next two films.

Unfortunately, this edition is fairly hit-and-miss in terms of its bonus features. ""Mel Gibson: the high octane birth of a superstar"", while it may be true, rings a bit tragi-comic after his recent high octane Hollywood explosion and other controversies; this featurette is 16 minutes and 40 seconds of pure Hollywood tripe, purple praise of the mega-star narrated in the type of excited, gravelly voice that is more suitable to a monster truck rally (and, as such, is regularly made fun of on The Simpsons - really, who made the decisions on this one?). In case we didn't know it, we also get background on the young actor's training, highlighting his charisma, acting talent, enthusiasm and dedication for such projects as Summer City and Tim. The narrator runs through a description of the movie, quite unnecessarily (didn't we just watch it again?), cuts to his agent Faith Martin, then his Summer City co-star Piper Laurie (of Twin Peaks fame), before battering us over the head with such lines as ""the breadth and variety of his work has made Mel Gibson one of the most popular and enduring movie stars of all time!"" Yuck!! There's also comparisons to Mel Gibson being the original action hero in Mad Max, with the Terminator, Die Hard, and Rambo all coming afterwards, endearing him to American audiences who needed to be reminded what their own films were like before they got all pretentious in the 1970s, cough, cough!!

But it gets a bit better - there's a whole section of film posters from various countries, and ""The Mad Max Phenomenon"" talks about how the film was made, including the Toecutter's bulging eyeballs prop. The original car was apparently found by collectors, and now goes 80 km/hr. There's the original Australian trailer, ""his only weapon: 600 horses of fuel-injected vengeance"", (1:58). Included are also a bunch of TV spots: ""The only law"", 0:31, ""Law and order"", 0:31, ""Hope and civilisation"", 0:31, ""Fuel-injected vengeance,"" 0:31. ""Mad Mac - the maximum force of the future! Rated R!!""

The film also comes with the American English dubbed version (if you want it), and a full commentary by several of the key figures who made the film (which, sadly, doesn't include its director, George Miller, and its star). But you still get great commentary, and learn that Miller had been a medical doctor, and thus also had a sense of how to direct hospital scenes and other gore. Original leading lady Rosie Bailey broke her leg four days before start of filming in a motorcycle accident (how ironic), and Joanne Samuel got the part of Max's wife by default, coming in at the last moment. The beach house that Max and his family lived in is still there on the outskirts of Melbourne, and can be rented for holidays. Halls of Justice is an old sewage station, Toecutter's right eyebrow had been shaved off. Ravina Chaffey, the singer - wow!!

For all their flaws, at least bonus features ARE available on this special - neither The Road Warrior nor Beyond Thunderdome discs that are currently available have this much stuff, boo!!",1416960000,,3614,4.824193548387097

There does not exist a plot within this film.  Its just some douche named Max and supposedly hes badass...although he never really does anything in the movie except have a girlfriend(possibly wife) and maybe that's his kid in that one scene...but who really knows...the film never reveals.

It was not until I resumed the film and saw Mel Gibson that I accepted that this was in fact the original.

Unfortunate that many of those late-70s and 80s flicks look so primitive compared to today's blockbusters.  Sometimes it's best to move on to the new releases, the Mad Max series was a good concept but seriously dated.",1410393600,,611,4.380530973451328

The script is pretty predictable throughout with very over-the-top over-acting with cartoon-like villains.  In fact, no one in the movie is a particularly good actor; very amateurish. Mad Max is still very watchable in it's own goofy, nostalgic way, but it's very far from the better movie that I once thought it was.",1409961600,,488,4.7176470588235295

I began to watch this one because I didn't recognize the ad poster and thought it'd be a different version, I didn't remember any of the scenes and so I decided to stick to the end in search and hope of a cinematographic morsel which never developed, same old, same old.

I owned an early DVD of this movie with the dubbed ""english"" sound track.
I have to say the version with the original Australian sound track is definitely better.
The scene in the garage where the mechanic shows Max THE CAR for the first time is my all time favorite bit

677594,4,6303471501,"Before watching this, I was aware of Mad Max as a character and that this was the role that made Mel Gibson a star. However, I wasn't completely expecting what I got here. It wasn't bad by any means, but MAD MAX is a bit more low-key than I expected. I'm guessing that the reputation was built off of the sequels. Still, what George Miller came up with for this first entry was pretty spectacular.

 The story takes place in Australia a few years in the future (which would have been around 1982 at the time of release). Society hasn't completely gone to hell yet, but it's clearly on the precipice. Biker gangs and marauders roam the countryside, attack random people and cops, do a lot of road-racing and are a general menace. They are pursued by the Main Force Police, who although tasked with managing the biker gangs and trying to keep order, are barely distinguishable from the people they're pursuing. It isn't a point that's particularly labored in the movie, but society has devolved to the point where the only difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" is a badge. This minor, but a core, aspect is what I liked the most about the film: the idea that there aren't any heroes. There is right and wrong, but the lines are often blurred.

 Anyway, among these cops is Max Rockatansky, the guy they call when the other cops get into a snafu. He's the guy that gets the job done. He's also a family man, with a wife and young child. Despite the post-apocalyptic setting, this is actually the main drive for the story, which is more of a revenge picture than a straight action movie. Yes, there is plenty of action, but the film is equally about Max's transformation into the badass we know and love, as it is about the overall look and feel and the superbly choreographed chase sequences. More fickle viewers might get a little bored with the lull in the middle, but there should be enough action to satisfy genre fans.

 And speaking of action, the opening sequence is probably the best out of them, although the final one is very well-executed in its own right. The first one, for me, is the best because it set the tone of the movie, quickly established Max as a character (as well as his role/reputation) and featured some amazing car and motorcycle stunts which, given when this was made, were all done practically. All of the action sequences were well-done in fact, but the first one sticks out in particular to me because of the way it opens the film. There was also a sequence late into the film where some bikers are pursuing a gasoline truck, and one of them pole vaults onto the top of it. I do have a little prior knowledge of the sequels, and this was a great way to establish that aspect as well as add more detail to the world that George Miller created.

 Overall, this is a well-made, engaging film with some great action and a minimal, but effective, performance by Mel Gibson. Highly recommended.",1406764800,,2915,4.52851711026616

677721,1,6303471501,"THIS FILM IS TERRIBLE ... unless you have alcohol, in which case it's tolerable (sorta).

Let me break it down for you.
1. The plot sucks.  You don't get a revenge movie until it's more than half way through.  The first half is supposed to explain back story, but it's just painful--and it doesn't explain anything!  After you get there, you don't really care.
2. You don't care about any of the characters apart from Max -- and even he's rather superficial (Mel did a great job getting what he could out of the character).  Yes, the child and wife are cute, but they are 2D characters even with a good scene or two.
3. Unless you already know from elsewhere, the film never explains that it's a post-apocalyptic world.  You don't get any explanation of how it happened or why.  Nor does it feel very post-apocalyptic-y (to coin a horribly hyphenated word).

My guess is that people like this film for nostalgic reasons...?  I'm too young for that.  So is my wife.  She described it as Logan's Run - the weird society + cars.  At least you know (or should know) that Logan's Run is a cult hit -- this is pretty much the same thing.  I suppose if you're prepared for that, then you might be alright with the film.

Here's how to make it better if you get stuck watching this film: ALCOHOL.  We drank every time something was unbearably 70s or melodramatic.  Make sure you have lots of alcohol though.  In which case, cheers!",1401753600,,1423,4.453488372093023
677722,4,6303471501,"A classic of sorts, this low budget affair offers fantastic action sequences but an undernourished plot that relies too heavily on coincidence and a small world view of life in the middle of nowhere during an unspecified time in the future.  Unfortunately, this film looks retro rather than futuristic.  It feels like something out of the far distant past rather than a sad commentary on supposed future events.

Mad Max won 3 Australian film awards for the editing, sound, and a truly abysmal-intrusive score by Brian May (who was hired to score the film A la Bernard Herrmann).  This film was banned in Sweden until 2005.

The best way to describe George Miller's approach to this movie is to say that it is primal, visceral.  The landscape is desolate and barren.  Much of the story takes place on the open road.  Most of the characters represented are archetypes: glaring, grinning, cackling loonies terrorizing what remains of humanity.  It's difficult to connect to anyone present as none of them are fully realized as people.  Most are, as Mad Max observes, terminally crazy.  In the end, it's just another vigilante revenge flick, satisfying on some levels (raw and ragged action), disappointing on others (no character development, no story development...........).  It definitely has a great `look.'  I love the camerawork.  I love the way everything was cropped and composed into a very careful selection of imagery.  On that level, it's brilliant.

678261,3,6303471501,"So let me set the record straight about this version of the movie from Amazon's Instant Video. It is the original Aussie soundtrack, not an English dubbed version. Between all the different DVDs and downloads, if you are interested in downloading this one, be assured that it is not dubbed. It is however, pan and scan. What that means for those of you who have never watched movies on VHS tape is that the screen is formatted for a squarish cathode ray television with a 4:3 aspect ratio, instead of the standard 16:9 ratio for widescreen HDTVs. So when you watch this, you're going to get the black bars on both sides of the screen. Yes, at first it is ""widescreen"" for a few seconds, but then it changes for the rest of the movie. In my opinion, this doesn't hurt the presentation.

The movie itself is a victim of the storytelling of the late 70s and obvious budgetary constraints. That's not to say that this is a bad film, but it doesn't really hold up today, even against your typical B-movie actioner. Some of the acting is way over the top to the point of being ridiculous. I'm thinking of the barechested police chief in the black leather pants and black silk scarf smoking a cigar and watering his plants and yelling at Max down the stairs while still holding his orange watering can. But I guess in Australia in the  late 70s, this was pretty normal. I will say that the climax of the movie shows admirable restraint and I thought it was well-executed. The real draws here are Mel Gibson and the fact that this is the movie that sets the stage for The Road Warrior. That the Road Warrior came out of this movie is amazing. The quality of filmmaking rose proportional to the budget and what comes out of it is nothing less than a masterpiece. This movie, at the very least, has really awesome box art.",1343260800,,1812,4.454819277108434

This is what causes Max to be Mad Max. I will also say that this movie is so good,that one of my dogs is named Max,after the character from this film. Now I don't know if you want a special edition of this movie,but I have seen the original Aussie release before,and glad I have it now on DVD.So if your a fan of Mel Gibson,but your worried about this being a low budget movie,rest assured that this is a very good low budget movie.

to have the English dubbed version, just so you can remember what it was like being little and watching this on TV for the first time.  Plenty of

Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as ""The Road Warrior.""  And ""The Road Warrior"" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.

Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today.

""Mad Max"" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today.

S., screened.  While that movie was a clichd game changer, the original has its charm as well.  Produced on a non-existent budget, this Australian film is set in a futuristic style of dust, poverty, lawlessness that we have now come to expect.  The bad guys are just road marauders who exist to create havoc.  The good guys are the cops (Mel) who are out to bring peace to the countryside.  The movie is beautifully shot and directed, especially given the money they clearly didn't have.  There's no CGI here.  All the stunts are real stunt men and the driving sequences are first rate.

678324,5,6303471501,"Before The Fast and The Furious, Speed Racer, and all of today's hybrid human/cgi rendered cars and blue screen chase sequences, there were films with real cars, real stuntmen, and Detroit gas guzzlers with Holly carburetors that made a lot of noise. Of these films, Mad Max and its follow-up, The Road Warrior, exemplifies the extinct breed known as muscle cars, or, in this instance, Australian muscle, mate!

As a kid growing up, there was always something about the look of this film that turned me off: the desert, the dust, the solitary road, the mohawked freaks, the little ugly wild boy. But when I got older and a little more open minded, especially during a period when I became obsessed with car movies, I decided to give Mad Max, the so-called ""classic,"" a test drive and all I can say is WOW!!! There's something about the post apocalyptic setting of this film that makes those big muscular 70's cars look right at home, almost mythical. If you like the type of medieval hot rods that are primered, stripped down to the bone essentials--motors, tires, steering wheels, gear-shifters--then this is your kind of film.

In a nutshell, Mad Max concerns a good cop (Gibson), member of the MFP (Main Force Police  who surrenders to the dark side of his soul following a tragic incident. And if I add more to this I'll spoil the fun for those who haven't seen it. Can't say enough about this baby. Action, scary, prophetic, poignant, and beautiful can't begin to describe this film experience.

This one is low-budget filmmaking at its best.

Two points:

1.  For some absurd reason those who put out this DVD decided to dub the original ""Australian"" into American English.  What an insult.  Really, how dumb do they think we are?

2.  Interesting that while in the popular imagination the Mad Max paradigm has come to mean post-Apocalyptic chaos, in this first one, the world is more or less as normal as the Apocalypse hasn't occurred yet.

I predicted that something would happen to the Goose(a friend of Max) and his family. So maybe therefore. Also I know that it should have been in the movie as it was necessary to depict, but I didn't like what savages did to women, or men they've found. So to be short it was okay to see.

678329,4,6303471501,"Let's go back....way,way back. Back before the Jew-hating rants,the philandering,the ugly divorce and the numerous drunk driving charges. Back before the ugly ticking time bomb that star Mel Gibson has become now. Mad Max is Mel Gibson in his acting infancy and while it is very difficult at times to separate the actor and his career from the films,separate we must.
Trained in the more traditional classical style of stage acting(Shakespeare,etc)Gibson had debuted in films in just one role in /77 in Australia when he was offered the title role in Mad Max shortly after. Continuing working on the stage before,during and after shooting Max,Gibson,like everyone involved with the film including writer/director George Miller,were gobsmacked at the films impact. For just around a cool $1/2 million dollars,Millers' independent film company produced what would become an extremely profitable product way beyond their expectations. In fact it has pulled in to date over a $100,000,000! Gibson's career slowly lifted off the runway of mere acting mortals as he would go on to star in Gallipoli,The Year of Living Dangerously,the two sequels to Mad Max and then onto his Lethal Weapon series. And Gibson hasn't seen ground since,although some say his recent ""problems"" have crash landed him unceremoniously back to terra firma permanently. We shall see.
Mad Max's premise may be a simple one but it has a certain je nais sais quoi,that draws you into the story and keeps you watching. Set in a future which is decidedly bleak(""dystopian"" being the word often used),the film opens with an escaping convict and cop-killer called Night Rider,that is being doggedly pursued by the constabulary,this being the MFP(Main Force Patrol).Two MFP cars  can't get the job done so it is up to their leather clad top pursuit man Max to get their man. And get him he does which ends with the convicts death in a fiery crash.
The scene switches to a motorcycle gang which the now deceased Nightrider was a member of. The body of their former comrade is at a train station in a small town,which they are there to collect. However a young couple watching some of the mayhem some of the gang members are unleashing decide to make a run for it in their car. The gang's boss man Toecutter(played delicously by Hugh Keays Burn)sees them and order all bodies to hunt them down. They easily overwhelm the couple and one member decides to stay behind and have some fun with the female of the two. He is caught later at the scene by Max and his partner Jim,alias The Goose(Steve Bisley)and taken to be arraigned on charges. No sooner have they got their man than they have to let him go;no one turns out as a witness.
The gang has a long memory and they eventually take out The Goose while he is trapped upside down in his vehicle as the result of a crash. Max is beside himself and he decides to retire. He turns in his resignation but his boss tells him to take some time off and then come back to reconsider. This he does with his wife and baby who go on an extended car trip around the countryside. While getting a tire fixed his wife goes to a nearby store to get some ice cream but its molested by none other than Toe Cutter and his gang. She barely escapes and they flee the area. They end up at a relatives farm but the gang has followed them there. While coming back from the beach through some woods Max's wife is being chased and he hears her screams. She manages to reach Max who whisks her into the house while he goes in search of the perps. However they have done a runaround and are waiting at the farmhouse. Wifey flees but her car has been tampered with and as she runs away from her broken down vehicle,baby in arms,the motorcycle gang run her down in the middle of the road. Arriving at the scene too late Max is filled with rage. He returns home with one thing on his mind;vengeance. He re-suits up,gets an even more jacked-up pursuit car and heads out to get his pound of flesh. He dispatches the gang members first in a group then he goes after the two important ones;Toecutter and the guy who killed his partner;in that order. Toecutter gets his kissing the front grill of a semi,while Max hand cuffs the other one to an overturned truck,dripping petrol. He rigs a little something up set to explode in a short time and gives him a hack saw. He tells him he can either cut through the hand cuffs in about ten minutes or saw his handcuffed ankle off,which should take about five(shades of ""Saw""!).The last shot of the movie is from the front hood of the car looking back at Max and the scene behind as he drives away. Of course the inevitable explosion occurs with the audience yelling an in-tandem""Yesss!"".But Max's face is not smiling;it's full of angst,pain and the memories of the past 24 hours as he drives off to......who knows where? Fade out.
As I mentioned before while this story may be simplistic at times,and while there are many moments that reveal its' low budget roots,this a movie you just cannot stop watching. Just when other lesser films would fade into some irrelevant love scene or other padding,this one has that hook that just won't let you walk away. You often wonder what is going to happen after such and such a moment and you may even KNOW what is going to happen,but it makes no difference. The film's rawness and punch always keeps itself on track. There are no apologies here and some of the more violent scenes are what they are because they BELONG there.
This DVD set comes packaged with the Blue Ray disc also. The Blue Ray is a single sided disc while the DVD version is a dreaded two-sided double disc,and is on the bottom holder of the two. One side contains the film,in TWO versions:widescreen(2:35:1) and full screen. The other side is devoted to features only. Specials include:commentary,a special Max Facts track,photo gallery,TV spots,original trailers and two featurettes,one on Gibson career and the other about the Mad Max phenomenon itself. The Blu Ray disc has only the film,commentary and the Mad max phenom featurette.
The film itself has restored Gibsons voice which was dubbed over in later versions and some cut footage. It now runs closer to 91 minutes than the previous 88. The transfer is beautiful and the print they use here is pristine. This is Mad Max they way it was always intended to be shown.
In short this career starting,adrenaline pumping Mel Gibson vehicle from /79 is a winner all the way.

678393,4,6303471501,"1 DVD Disc & 1 Blu-ray Disc, released October 5, 2010

""Mad Max"" was one of the first movies to come out of Australia that got huge attention around the world and began the career of a star, Mel Gibson. It is the story of Max, a police officer in a time where bandits and lawlessness runs rampant who tries to get away from it all after something happens to his partner only to have more bad guys go after his wife and child leaving him only one choice -- get bad ass and take them all out in a big car action scene.

Now it has come to Blu-ray with a DVD combo. The DVD has two featurettes - one on Mel Gibson as the ""Birth of a Superstar"" and one on ""Mad Max: The Film Phenonmenon"". When the film first came to the States, for some reason all the Australian voices were dubbed in American English! Are you for real, America??? Come on! It's not a different language, it's English for crying out loud! It's not like you can't understand their accent so even the great Mel Gibson superstar was dubbed over, geez. If you want to hear that version though, it is an audio option to switch to English dub. *smacks forehead*

On the DVD is commentary with Jon Dowding, David Eggby, Chris Murray, and Tim Ridge where they go into detail about how certain stunts were performed and how they could only afford to put Gibson in actual leather clothes while everyone else was sporting vinyl. The DVD also has trailers, a Road Rants trivia and fun track, TV spots, and a photo gallery. The Blu-ray disc also has the ""Mad Max: The Film Phenonmenon"" and commentary with a clearer picture and sound.

The difficult thing about a release like this now is that in all the bonus features talking about what a star he is, how beautiful, how talented, how much money he has made, it is all tainted with the reality of the public's current view of him after too many incidents have occurred that have tarnished his reputation as an actor, director, and producer. Mel Gibson was the first Australian actor to be paid a million dollars for a movie and the first actor ever from any country to be paid $25 million for a movie. It is true that ""Mad Max"" is a classic for high octane adrenaline action movies and was a forerunner for every ""Fast & the Furious"", ""Transporter"", and other crazy car movies. Not only did it reinvent action and the chase scene, it was one of the first apocalyptic movies which led the way for every other interpretation of what happens after....fill in the blank of a major event here as in ""The Book of Eli"" earlier this year.

If you dig this classic, it's not a bad deal at all for all the stuff you get and you just have to listen to them raving about Gibson with an open mind if you aren't a big fan of his shenanigans right now. It was released both in DVD packaging (the one I was sent) and in Blu-ray packaging (which is the better deal).",1288483200,,2851,4.311567164179104

I watched a few times through with the sub-titles on just to catch some of their slang/colloquialism's. I really didn't notice any issues with color or noise in the movie.

720p Comments:

Overall it looks very dark. They didn't digitally correct any of the color errors (that is, spots in the movie where the film has color damage--it's really obvious after Max drags himself back to the car). The color is richer than on the DVD; skin tones look accurate, but the clouds look pinkish. And it's grainy, but still clearer than ever. You can actually read the graffiti on the high-fatality road sign, and read all the port rules on the beach sign. It's going to be a treasure trove for costumers and prop makers! The BD is definitely an improvement over the DVD in terms of clarity, but the price of that clarity seems to be all the visual noise that's now visible. (In many of the scenes where open blue sky is the backdrop, the sky tends to flicker.) I checked some scenes on the DVD and the color shifting and noise are there, too--it's just not as noticeable as on the BD. I suspect it's the very same source print.

1080p Comments:

Before I owned the 1080p plasma, I thought that having all that additional resolution would just make the bad qualities of the transfer that much more obvious. I was wrong. Frankly, it looks pretty amazing. There was less flickering of the sky, and print damage was much less obvious. The film still appears grainy, and overall the color is somewhat dull, but it IS a 30-year-old low-budget movie--a lot of which seems to have been shot on overcast days.

Additional Disc Comments:

The disc menu is odd: The footage is from the movie but the sound is sourced from who-knows-where (most of it is not from the movie, and doesn't even really match the visuals). And would someone tell me why they insist on including the abominable American dub in every release? (The only redeeming feature of the American dub--aside from its comedy value--is that some engine sounds were beefed up, and the characters' voices don't get lost in the mix as they do in the original.) The default audio is the original Australian track in 5.1 DTS HD. There's also a mono mix for you traditionalists.

The DVD included in the set is the exact same one from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Max-Special-Edition-DVD/dp/B00005R2IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Max (Special Edition) DVD</a>. (I compared them and the markings/numbers are identical.) Compared to the BD, it now looks a little washed-out. The chapter breaks appear to be the same for both discs.

Conclusion:

The question is, is this BD release worth the money? Well, if you're a die-hard completist or a hard-core fan like I am, the answer is yes. If you have a 1080p TV, then the answer is YES! If you're looking for the definitive Blu-ray release of Mad Max that's the best it's ever going to get, I'd say wait (or buy used). Maybe someday we'll get a loving, caring, comprehensive digital restoration by someone who doesn't care just about the sales numbers. But who knows how long that might take?",1286236800,78,3874,5.61986301369863
678397,5,6303471501,"Mel Gibson has made a career of playing Angry Mel--an initially decent man who, having suddenly and violently lost what he holds most dear, gets royally pissed and goes on a vicious, vengeful rampage--in movies from Lethal Weapon to Payback to The Patriot to Braveheart, but it all started with this one.

Mad Max takes place in a dystopic future. Not the postapocalyptic wasteland of the later Mad Max movies, but a decaying, semiliterate society frighteningly close to our own. In this time motorcycle gangs, led by the sadistic, maniacal Toecutter, have taken over the roads of Australia, and the government (or what passes for the government) can barely manage to keep things just shy of anarchy.

Only the Main Force Patrol (MFP), the police force, stands in the way of the gangs. However, they aren't much better, for in their mad pursuit of their quarry, they tend to leave a trail of civilian casualties in their wake, and they seem far more concerned with the thrill of the chase than maintaining the peace.

In this world the only things that matter are speed and quick reflexes. Whoever has those rules the roads. Those who have neither, on the other hand, usually end up as flaming wrecks on the side of the highway.

Into this state of affairs enters Gibson as Max Rockatansky, the top Interceptor on the MFP, who, with his fun-loving partner Goose, daily takes to the roads to pursue the Toecutter's gang. He seems to be a more decent sort than his fellow officers, hence more sensitive to the endless parade of horrors he sees on the job, but manages to hang on to his sanity thanks to his loving wife and young son. Of course this happy (?) situation can't last, otherwise we wouldn't have a movie...and you can guess what happens next.

There are so many things to love about this movie: the brutal, suspenseful car chases (done on a shoestring budget and, even so, more inventive than what you'll see in most Hollywood action movies), the bizarre slangy, gabbly Aussie futurespeak, the crazed gangsters with their scruffy, outlandish punk costumes, and the garish, Wild-West-through-a-funhouse-mirror universe it all takes place in. As for Mel Gibson: if you ever harbored doubts the man could act, this movie should put them to rest forever, because he turns in a superb, fully-rounded performance here. But don't worry, for those who crave Angry Mel, he shows up too.

Highly recommended.",1285027200,,2408,4.846715328467154
678398,5,6303471501,"In the not-too-distant future, the roads are ruled by anarchy. Gangs control the streets, destroying anything in their path and killing as they please. A rouge cop sets off on a suicide mission to take out these ruthless thugs after his wife and child are murdered out of spite by the gang leaders. As opposed to the over-the-top action that drove THE ROAD WARRIOR in the years to follow, MAD MAX is a much more character driven film, with all of the heart and soul that was missing from the subsequent sequels. Mel Gibson provides a powerful breakthrough performance as Max, a man pushed over the edge by hatred and grief. Director George Miller creates a series of dynamic chase sequences filled with incredible stunts and heart-racing suspense. While the film appears to be extremely graphic and violent, Miller tastefully implies the most horrific moments off-screen. In the most devastating sequence where Max's family is run down by Toecutter and his gang, the camera focuses on the road just past the action, as the bikers speed past and a small shoe and ball sprawl across the pavement. The combined effect of George Miller's fast-paced action, beautiful cinematography, and timeless revenge plot make MAD MAX one of the most exhilarating post-apocalyptic thrillers in the genre.

When reading through some of the other reviews for the newest Special Edition Mad Max DVD, there were some confusing complaints that I came across, many of which were complaining that the DVD was badly formatted and that the voices had been dubbed over by American actors.  After some further pondering, I realized that the reviewers were commenting on a different DVD release that came out prior to the Special Edition, as well as prior to this Decades Collection Edition.

To put it plainly, this is a retouched version of the theatrical release as far as picture and sound quality.  The sound is in very nice stereo, and the picture has been digitally restored and is in Wide Screen format.  There are NO American voice overs added.  There are a few extras on the DVD, including poster art, two documentaries, and a few trailers.  All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase. It was extremely cheap for the quality.  If you want a low-cost, good version of Mad Max and are not too interested in a bunch of DVD extras, this is a no brainer.

678457,4,6303471501,"For more than 20 years, American audiences were saddled with an inferior version of the 1979 action-thriller from Down Under. A  worldwide hit upon its initial release, director George Miller's ""Mad Max"" had the misfortune of receiving U.S. distribution from American-International Pictures (AIP), which trimmed five minutes and redubbed the film with American voices - thus eliminating its Australian flavor. Adding insult to injury, AIP buried the movie in drive-ins and grindhouses as a second feature. Happily, the original 95-minute version can be found on this DVD release. Fueled by Mel Gibson's effective performance as a vengeful highway cop and David Eggby's stunning photography, the futuristic ""Mad Max""  boasts some extraordinary stunt work and offbeat characterizations.  Miller gains tremendous mileage from his limited budget and the Australian locations provide an ideal visual counterpart to the desolate cops-vs.-bikers atmosphere. Not surprisingly, this independent cult classic helped put Australia on the cinematic map.",1255564800,2,1041,5.880794701986755
678458,3,6303471501,"""Mad Max"" is one of those films that is on everyone's top film lists. Not only did it introduce us to Australian cinema, but also a young 21-year old newbie named Mel Gibson. ""Mad Max"" was dark, it was brooding, it was destructive, and it never gave us that glimmer of hope for humanity, but now - nearly 20 years later - does it still remain the classic that it started? Sure, it was impressive to watch the crash scenes, it was powerful to see the world through Mr. Miller's disturbed eyes, but is it re-watchable? Does it have the appeal to see new things throughout if watched and watched again? For me, the answer seemed to float near ""no"". While I loved what ""Mad Max"" represented, what it was - a full body of color and action - it wasn't something to be watched again and again. Gibson does a great job as Max, a man torn between the evils of the road and his personal philosophies. He begins as an ominous optimist, able to stop crime as it occurs on the streets, but then as his sense of normality is turned upside down, his ability to react and adapt is seen. The final moments, he has transformed from the man we were first introduced to into something quite terrifying. One could also compliment Mr. Miller's directorial outing, at times it felt a bit episodic with tough edits placed, but for the majority he told a deathly story with great ease and excitement. So, again, there is no arguing that ""Mad Max"" is an important film, one that I am glad to have finally seen, but once was enough. It seems to be lacking that re-watch excitement.

But why has that conclusion been made? What makes ""Mad Max"" mediocre instead of powerful? It is hard to pinpoint the exact scene, but the sense of ""alright, I've seen it - now what"" was definitely present by the end. Yet, there were points that I just loved. Gibson was perfect. He was incredible as Max, and the world that Mr. Miller created was intense. The opening scene, the car crashes as our bearded villain just yelled ""Toecutter"" was fantastic. ""Mad Max"" has one of those openings that just pulls you in, that makes you excited to watch a film of this intensity, but then where do you go? Miller seemed to indicate that more car crashes, more violence, more cliche family drama would indicate a stronger film. At times he was right, his ability to create different scenes set across the same backdrop demonstrated his originality, but then there were times where it just felt recycled. One scene that stands out, is where our gang of bikers track down a couple that happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, they chase them down and demoralize them as Max and his partner find them - then, almost repetitively, it happens with Max and his girl later in the film. In this post-apocalyptic world, there seems to be no problem finding someone. Space seems to not be a problem. This was another unexplained moment - where the coincidence of discovering Max or finding the biker gang should have been more difficult. These repetitive, essentially simplistic scenes seemed to detract from the power of what Max represented. One also needs to ask about the story, the unknown of what time or place we are following Max - would this have strengthened the story knowing what world we lived in? The understanding that this was a low-budget film was rooted in my mind, the techniques provided were impressive, but should that have been neglected for mediocre storytelling? Perhaps I misread this film, perhaps I missed the joy of why this is hailed as such a cult success.

Another weakness against ""Mad Max"" has to be the relationship between his wife/girlfriend and child. Again, the lacking story helped confuse this viewer as to what dynamic they had, but when we have scenes in which the child is completely forgotten about - it just decimates the reasons behind Max's anger and utter breakdown. There were several scenes in which I yelled at the screen, ""What about the child"", then finally they would remember - he seemed to fade in and out of existence too often for one film. Then, when disaster strikes, we are forced to believe that suddenly Gibson would release his inner rage? It just didn't work. The same can be said for his wife/girlfriend. A stronger definition of character, and even more lines spoken would have helped me see the relationship. She seemed angry at first, the product of a failed marriage forced by this post-apocalyptic world to stay together, then we were introduced to love, then suddenly, she moved to idiocrity. Who would believe that running down a road, when there are open fields around, is the better option? It was these small inconsistencies that forced ""Mad Max"" from greatness to just another average action film. Two-plus hour sweeping epics aren't always needed, but stronger characters do help in creating the world that we, as viewers, are to inhabit for 90-ish minutes.

Finally, applause are in order for the villain in this film. The portrayal of Toecutter by Hugh Keays-Byrne was outstanding. The small attention to detail as well as his ability to make you feel like he would do anything to get his way - similar to the portrayal of Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" - was an up moment for this film. Like a roller coaster, ""Mad Max"" had these ups and downs, curves and jerks, and when it was all said and done, you really had to question whether you were going to ride it again. ""Mad Max"" is an important film, there is no question in my mind about that. The door that this film opened for future cinema in America couldn't have been done by a better group of filmmakers, but it isn't a promising classic. I could not watch this film again. The sequels I am ready for, but this ride is over - and the park is closing. I realize that I am in the minority, but ""Mad Max"" is a low-budget film that uses repetitive filmmaking as its staple - originality is present, but you must search to find it.

When Max goes mad at the end of this first film, director George Miller doesn't set the action sequences up very well or provide much of a payoff.  The most exciting set pieces actually come much earlier in the movie.  However, his next film will prove that he can be a master of action.",1245369600,,779,4.768656716417911
678516,5,6303471501,"Personally I loved Mad Max. To me and more than a few of my friends who were into bikes back then (79 to 85) Mad max along with Quadrophenia made us feel like we were badguys (hey we were young). After watching Max and co young bikers across the UK attempted to emulate Max, Goose, Toecutter by being mean moody and more than a bit sad just as their predecessors had tried to emulate Marlon Brando (The Wild One) and Peter Fonda (Easy Rider) years before.

The film although low budget is none the worse for that as it takes away some of the glitz that hollywood loves to throw into films and sometimes ruins by doing so (e.g. Thunderdsome Mad Max 3).

The stunts are terific and the use of outback shots enhances the desolation the film seeks to portray. The acting is weak in some respects but the actors who portray 'the Goose' and 'the Toecutter' stand out even above Mel Gibson with performances that while believable are just the right side of over the top.

The sound is excellent with good mood music work by Brian May. However in some places the speeded up driving and riding shots fail to work as well as they might. But in other areas the feel is just right e.g. Goose's ride out the morning after his night of passion with the nightclub singer.

Overall a real groundbreaker which has rarely been beaten and which will still be remembered in years to come as a classic of Aussie cinema.",1243728000,,1398,4.406976744186046

678521,3,6303471501,"""Mad Max"" is the first of a trilogy, followed by ""The Road Warrior"" (1981) and ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985). Very few people in the States saw ""Mad Max"" when it was released in 1979 because it only had a limited run here. Most Americans were introduced to the dystopian world of Mad Max with the release of ""The Road Warrior"" a couple years later.

THE STORY: Ambiguously set in the near future after some sort of Apocalypse or social-economic breakdown, ""Mad Max"" focuses on the desolate regions of Australia wherein the police force, called The Bronze, try to protect what remains of society from a wild outlaw bike gang.

""Mad Max"" is perhaps the definitive cult film -- it's weird, raw, primal, ugly, low-budget and shuns explanation. Star Mel Gibson was a complete unknown at this point.

WHAT WORKS:

-- Director George Miller is imaginative with his unusual use of camera angles. I usually don't take note of such things so it has to be exceptional for me to notice.
-- The costuming and locations are great, shot in the desolate areas of Victoria, Australia, including along the ocean shore.
-- Although a bit cartooney, the filmmakers and actors successfully capture the utterly wild, looney and lawless nature of the bike gang, sort of reminiscent of, say, ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and ""The Warriors (1979).
-- The girls are fetching in a girl-next-door type of way.
-- The scene where a mother and child are run over by the outlaw bikers is creative and memorable.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:

-- The film has a really dated, low-budget vibe, especially the horrible score. One might argue that this is natural since it's from the late 70s, but that's not what I'm talking about. A film can obviously be from a certain period without being dated in the negative sense. Take, for instance, ""The Exorcist"" (1973), ""Jaws"" (1975), ""Suspiria"" (1977), ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) and ""The Warriors,"" they're all plainly from that 70s era but they also transcend it. They're timeless films, pure and simple. Not so with ""Mad Max.""
-- My main problem with the film is its aloof air. As noted above, the story shuns explanation -- which is great -- but it does it at the expense of truly captivating the audience. The film's only 95 minutes long but I always have a hard time sitting through it; the story is good but it's presented in such a way that it fails to truly pull the viewer in.
-- The vibe is often too over-the-top cartooney; I would have preferred a more realistic air. It's too obvious the filmmakers were shooting for an Australian ""A Clockwork Orange.""

This is not a negative point to me but it may be to some viewers -- there's not nearly as much action as rumored; there are many long, dramatic parts. In addition, what action is there is good but it's no more spectacular than pretty much any other 70's road/car flick or TV series.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Mad Max"" is definitely worthwhile since it's the beginning of the popular trilogy and a definitive cult film, not to mention one of Mel Gibson's earliest performances. But, despite the many positives, don't expect to be blown away. It's decent but low-budget fare with a dated, aloof vibe.

Being nine years wiser since my original review posting to this website, I still can't understand why some one (perhaps George Miller himself) doesn't produce an uncut, definitive version of this film on DVD.  However, since we're talking about a 30 year old film, personal priorities and what's happening in the world itself, perhaps there's no interest anymore in classic cult cinema.  I sit here typing this message today while watching my DVD version of the film knowing that filmmakers are bound by certain rules when putting stories to film.

Set in a dystopian future (not really post apocalyptic as many reviews claim - there is no evidence of a humanitarian crisis preceding the action), it features a wild and desolate Australian outback with feral kill hungry violent gangs of motorcycles taking on a quirky, underfunded police force. Max, played by Mel Gibson, is an old fashioned road to calvary type hero. A police officer who becomes disillusioned after the savage burning of one of his colleagues, he quits, but finds the gang have not left him. In horrific scenes, the gang hunts down his family, and Gibson returns to extract revenge, a necessarily determined and scarred loner.

Max Max does not stretch out into many dimensions, but it contains a raw savage power and exposes something of the nub of the innate violence at the heart of man.

678525,4,6303471501,"In spite of the fact that the 1981 film The Road Warrior--the second influential cinematic work of writer/director George Miller's Dystopian vision of the near future trilogy--leads to receive the anti-hero Max, released two years earlier, is where it all started... For it was here that Miller first brought to the screen his hellish vision, where civil society is under siege by crime and disorder, with the strength and charisma of a new young, tough, good looking actor by the name of Mel Gibson...

Gibson was just 23 years old when he took the role of Max Rockatansky--a young hotshot cop so emotionally wounded--and was such an unknown star that when the film was hitting the screens in the States, the preview trailers didn't even mentioned him but instead focused on the movie's coolest and most original car action ever filmed... In retrospect, of course, Gibson's portrayal of a relentless vigilante is an essential element of the picture...

In the Australian outback, Rockatansky is a motorcycle cop trying to keep order in a quickly disintegrating society... Vicious lawless bikers and road-raging psychopaths race up and down the forbidden territories, raping and pillaging the peaceful towns, and one such bunch ends up at the door of Max's wife (Joanne Samuel), and their 2-year old son... When they are both lying dead in middle of the road, Max is all driven over the edge, and so starts a high-speed pursuit involving wild rides, chilling fights, and memorable fast-motion suspenseful scenes rarely equaled in cinema...",1217980800,,1539,5.103174603174603

678605,4,6303471501,"... and I don't just mean the Mad Max saga but the Mel Gibson story. I'd heard this movie got Mel Gibson noticed among the big players - seeing it today made me believe it.

The movie begins with a car chase, with some really gutsy destruction sequences, somewhere amongst which, Gibson makes his entry as an ""Interceptor"", a cop from the near future - where this story is based - trying to make order in this ""Anarchie"" (no kidding! that's the name of the Ln mentioned in the first few shots of the film!). The government is pretty much non-existent in this futuristic flick, and gangs of roadies have taken up terrorizing and literally ruling the outlands.

Max, along with his partner - Office Jim Goose, takes his work seriously, and intends to clean the scrounge of the town, before his partner becomes a casualty of the war. Max suddeny is afraid for his family, and realizes he's not ready to take this war to its bitter end, and decides to take a break from his cop-career.

What follows is an eerie rendition, out on the Australian outback, of the origins of the character of Mad Max, before it got the adjective Mad; with some really slick editing and heart-pumping action. The chase sequences are simply great and the lack of dialogues makes it that much more watchable. Not much to speak - if you're into killing amd ambushing for a living.

This movie is the first of the trilogy of Mad Max, and is a good one at that. You get to see where Gibson learnt the conviction and grittyness that has since marked so many of his roles, notably Lethal Weapon, Conspiracy Theory, and The Patriot.

Must see - for Gibson and Mad Max fans!",1217030400,,1640,4.489932885906041
678606,3,6303471501,"This is an interesting film, which if occasionally a bit wooden, virtually created its own genre overnight, and made Mel Gibson a star.

Perhaps its most noteable feature was George Miller's use of unusual camera angles, which created one or two iconic images. Sometimes it has the feeling of an exploitation film, but it never develops in that way and by today's standards it seems rather tame.

It looks as though it was made on a pretty low budget, and I prefer the brasher sequels where a little more polish was added. It remains a film curiosity, but really not much more than that.",1213747200,,587,4.634615384615385
678607,4,6303471501,"At this point Mad Max is simply a post apocalyptic classic film.  While some people may not enjoy the movie through and through, I don't think that statement is very much contested.  Don't get me wrong, it's a fairly old film from today's perspective and its filming style shows that.  I think in perspective this movie was pretty on point for what people were thinking about at that time.  I mean when you think about it, the Cold War was still going strong and each country was trying to out power the other in terms of military might.  So the greatest concern at that time was a nuclear war and ""Mad Max's"" setting takes place shortly after such a catastrophic event.

It's pretty interesting to watch because it gives a pretty interesting ""what if"" scenario if technology and development stopped in the late 1970's.  So you never had the internet boom and the age of the computer in the 90's.  It's kind of cool when you try to picture this scenario.  The places it's most apparently are in the hospital and the kinds of cars they are using.  Despite this downfall it seems like everyone has custom vehicles and most are designed with a sports car in mind.  In the hospital scenes it reminds me of the film version of ""Johnny Got His Gun"" because the hospital areas just seemed too archaic by today's standards.

In Mad Max the world is still trying to hold on to the small vestiges of society that it can.  Lawlessness is at a whole new level and it seems that the court systems run amok similar to our current ones.  Basically the main premise for the film is that Mel Gibson plays a cop named Max who is effectively terrorized by a biker gang indirectly at first, but then very directly as the movie moves on.  The gang has this bizarre spiritually violent ethos, where the main member Nightrider was a key messenger of this philosophy... or at least that's how I'm interpreting his role.  The police sort of have a hand in this man's death so another member of the gang, Toecutter, comes after them.  Nightrider's death is what sparks the turmoil and brings the gang into town to wreak their havoc.

It's really kind of a tragic tale when you think of it as a whole, but that's kind of the point.  Max is a tragic character that gets pushed to the absolute extreme on every end.  However, I think during this film they didn't truly know what direction they wanted to bring Mel's character and I feel that direction was finally found in ""The Road Warrior.""  However, ""Mad Max"" is still fairly essential in order to get into Max's background and why he is so angry.  There is a slight discontinuity between the two films though, because at the end of this one he still has contact with some semblance of civilization and in ""Road Warrior"" it's all wastelands.

While ""Mad Max"" can seem a bit dry at times because it's mostly cars racing around on highways, it does set the stage for a very influential film (I feel at least) in the future.  While authors were setting the stage for post apocalyptic worlds, ""Mad Max"" set the stage for a lawless and harsh reality, unlike ""1984"" where the war pushed society to much stricter controls.  I think this is the type of movie people should at least see once, at the very least for nostalgic purposes, because it does not have nearly the same re-watch value as the sequel.",1204502400,,3320,4.502504173622705

WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!

The film is about Austraila in the outback perhaps.  It's in the Post-Nuclear future, a town is being threatened by a ruthless bicker gang lead by the infamous Toecutter.  It's up to what's left of the police to stop them!

Our hero Max Rockatansky (Played brilliently by Mel Gibson), pursues the Nightrider, a member of Toecutter's gang, on a high speed chase.  When Nightcutter dies, the outraged Toecutter plans his revenge on Max and the entire police elite.  He starts off by picking off Jim Goose, a fellow officer and friend of Max's.  Johnny, a young lacky of Toecutter's, sets a trap for Jim.  Jim gets very wounded when they set him on fire.  Max visits Jim in the hospital and is angered and horrified at what the evil biker gang has done to his friend.  Max then does the wrong thing by resigning from the force and decides to spend some time with his wife and young son where the bikers are nowhere to be found.

But no, that doesn't stop Toecutter from wanting revenge, it wasn't enough to burn Jim, he had to pick on Max too!  But this time he does something almost worst then the last time.  This time these victims were innocent.  He runs down Max's wife and infent son, and kills his son while his wife suffers massive injuries to her internal organs and has to have both of her legs and arms amputated.  God hasn't Max suffered enough already?!

Now Max is clearly pissed off and gets out his police uniform and starts his vengence spree.

We're not talking Oscar caliber, of course, but strong enough to be believable and keep the viewer caught up in the story.

It's rather humorous that a film that seems so low budget to us today can be as entertaining and riveting as this one is. Watching this now, for the fourth or fifth time, I have to say that this very young Mel Gibson, did he not already possess a legitimate level of talent, would not have been so believable in this role due to his physical appearance. His polish and chiseled features really don't fit in amid the band of miscreants that is the cast, but we soon forget our initial impressions due to his performance. The people in Mad Max are far closer to man's actual state than most of us care to admit.

In spite of all, we have grown into that kind of frantic frenzy, criminally biased and with no one to stop them. We are today speaking, and have been for a while, of a new criminal organization, a new mafia, a new gangsterism and it has come not to the desert but to our cities, to our suburban areas. These new criminals do not want power, control, or even influence. They just want to make money and to get the thrill of absolute fear around them, no matter what thrill actually, but the thrill of robbing, killing, blowing up. They have no political motivations like in the late 60s and early 70s. They just want to feel blood on their hands and smell powder in their nostrils. They are not even well organized as money making criminals. They take tremendous risks and don't even hide their tracks. Being run after by the cops is fun and they can kill one from time to time, a pregnant young female cop if possible. We have fully entered the modern criminal urban civil war and we better move our heads and rake our brains if we do not want them to take over whole neighborhoods where the law is going to be their law. That's exactly what Mad Max is showing and demonstrating. That's our future, that's already our present. If you don't believe it just check with Grenoble in the Alps or wherever there has been an ""incident"" (it should be called an ambush or a battle) of that type. What's more Mel Gibson had seen that the good ones in our society, those who have authority will most of them decide that it is going against the human rights of these new criminals if we want to shoot them when they have a bullet proof vest on and a heavy automatic gun in their hands. Some in the press even believe you must - not should, mind you - ask them for permission before shooting at them, and they no longer use light guns. They use heavy military weapons. Some even call themselves the barbarians of the latter days and one of these gangs (all the members are in prison right now) tortured a young Jew to death over several days just because he was a Jew, and the leader of the gang managed to go back to his homeland in Africa to find refuge, which he luckily did not find because he was extradited back to France and what tried for his crime. There is only one way with these: get the wolf out of the wood and declare the hunting season open and that species of wolves no longer protected except if they surrender and put their weapons down BEFORE killing, or even wounding, anyone. That sounds harsh but I have lived through the end of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a piece of the end, and I can tell you there is nothing else to do because anyone of them who will manage to get out of the final stand in which they are trapped will start shooting again tomorrow morning as soon as they walk free on parole. France has had its batch of terrorism in the late 80s and early 90s but Mesrine was not tried and a few others were not either. I regret Carlos was. That kind of an outlaw does not really deserve a trial. I am told we must respect the human rights of these criminals. I could if their crimes were crimes of passion. But their crimes are crimes of blood, of greed, of absolute destruction. Mad Max got them all. Good. Unluckily that will not bring the victims of these barbarians back to life, will it?

678729,3,6303471501,"It's not altogether surprising that Mad Max got such short shrift when it came out Stateside with an unfortunate dubbing job to eliminate the `Strine accents so American International could pretend it was an American film (Mel Gibson suffered perhaps a worse indignity with his screen credit moved to last position, just before the lab credit on the trailers). Much of what people remember and love about Max is delivered in the sequel rather than this first outing. Indeed, at times it feels more like a blueprint than a proper movie and Gibson barely registers in the surprisingly little screen time he has - the villains, who all seem to be doing either premature Danny Huston impersonations or somewhat more timely German New Romantic turns make much more of an impression. Not only do huge sections of the film keep him offscreen, but he makes little impact in his underwritten role when he is on. In many ways, this is just a first low-budget draft of Max's world - civilization hasn't entirely crumbled yet and the precious juice is still flowing even if parts are getting hard to find. Still, the car stunts are good, if somewhat thin on the ground, but this is one case where the sequels are definitely better.

MGM/UA's special edition offers reasonable extras, but they are limited by the non-involvement of George Miller and Mel Gibson and the unavailability of any archive footage.

678732,4,6303471501,"Anyone intelligent enough to ""get"" this movie is capable of understanding the Austrailian version. We have moved beyond the need for Americanizing films, which tend to water-down the original intent and flavor of the director/creators vision. This movie, for me, is more relevent today than it was when it was filmed. In this part of America, especially in small town rural areas, you can almost get the feeling that we are living in this future. Many people in the midwest scrounge and save their meager earnings to be able to afford to fill their gas tanks just so they can drive to their jobsite. The desolation of the area in which the movie was filmed makes this movie eerily believable and I often am reminded of the look and feel of the film when driving through some small midwest American ""ghost-towns"". In spite of the realism this motion picture is still high escapism, which for me is the point of watching movies. I'll watch this one over and over.",1162857600,,961,4.6923076923076925
678796,4,6303471501,"In the dystopian world of the future as seen through MAD MAX, the tough and crazy world we live in has become a lot rougher. Bandit gangs of motorcycle riders rule the roadways. They claim that anarchy and bedlam are the way to go. They steal cars, run over people, and rape women. The only thing stopping them from completely having their way is the Main Force Patrol (MFP), the last embodiment of law and order in the land. Driving vehicles full of swift and speed the MFP is the last line of defense in a world gone mad. The best member of the MFP is one Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) a cool officer with nerves of steel, a heart of gold, and a jewel of a sense of humor. Max succeeds in killing more thugs and bringing in more criminals than anyone else on the patrol. But even Max has his limits. After the death of a notorious criminal known as the Nightrider (Vincent Gil), his second-in-command takes over, Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and vows revenge. First they kill Max's partner and then they come for Max but kill his family instead. That puts Max over the edge and he doesn't just get even, he gets mad. At the end he drives away in his Interceptor and the legend of the Road Warrior begins.

MAD MAX will always be known as the film that made Mel Gibson an international star. Until THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT it was also known as the motion picture with the highest cost-to-profit ration: the movie was made for less than $400,000 and earned well over $100 million. The shoe-string budget was even throughout the filming. For instance many of the cars used as police interceptors were constantly repainted for different scenes to pass as other cars and the blue van that is smashed in the opening car chase was writer and director George Miller's personal vehicle.

The style of MAD MAX feels like BLADE RUNNER, but without all the cool gadgets. The world has fallen apart and each man must defend his own, but it's never explained why things are the way they are. Outside communication with the rest of the world has been completely cut off and though there are pockets of happiness to be discovered, one has to brave the roads and the roads are a dangerous and many times lethal place.

The acting in MAD MAX isn't anything extraordinary, but it doesn't have to be. The movie has a solid script with several impressive car chases. The cheap budget helped grand the film in the bleak atmosphere it is portraying and gives it a grainy quality that is lacking in the other Mad Max films.

I enjoyed MAD MAX and was quite impressed by how much the filmmakers were able to accomplish with so little. I think that ROAD WARRIOR (aka MAD MAX 2) is a better movie, but MAD MAX isn't a film to be messed with either.",1158883200,,2721,4.468812877263582

Forget Mel Gibson is in it - watch this film for its own brand of drama , revenge , thrills , action and good old fashioned mean-heartedness .

If you think about it , the plot for this film was recycled for 'Gladiator' , which was another breakthrough film for an actor from the Aussie part of the world .

Or how about the childish drawl of Forrest Gump or Brando's slurred rasps in ""The Godfather?""  Of course not!  They were integral parts of the characters, the settings, and the times of those films.  So why, WHY were the distinctive, wonderful accents and slang of the Australian characters in the U.S. version of ""Mad Max"" dubbed over with, apparently, the voices of bland, Midwestern newscasters? Did the film's U.S. distributors think they'd fool us?  That American audiences would hear Matt Lauer's voice coming out of Mel Gibson as he raced across the deserts of the Australian outback and not think, ""Hey! Those 'Americans' are driving on the wrong side of the road . . . and their steering wheels are on the wrong side, too!?""

Fortunately, this DVD resurrects the outstanding, original voices of the Australian actors and actresses, coming through, crisp and clear, in stereo, rather than the ""Hercules-in-New-York""-ish mono of the American dubbing.

If you've seen ""Mad Max"" before, and hated it or even just thought it was so-so, take a chance on this DVD and see it again in ""Australian-English.""  It's an almost totally different movie.  Believe me -- I didn't particularly like it the first time I saw the dubbed, U.S. version, either.  If you loved it, (pardon the cliche) see it again for the first time. You'll be transported into the surreal world of Australian outback biker slang that George Miller intended.

There's Mel: a good cop in a place where that means being the law more than upholding what's left of it.

From that moment the thirst of vengeance will assume human form. And the visual sequences of high level physical and visual violence will burn at your eyes.

Many movies have tried to copy this film, but they failed.  The main reason, I think, is because they focused on the violence part of it and forgot about writing thier films so people can agree with the feelings expressed by the main charictor.

678909,5,6303471501,"For those NaySayers that give this movie anything less than 4 stars, are you off your rocker?  This movie was put together for $100,000, by ametuer actors and directors.  It grossed $100 million worldwide in the last 30 years.  It did this with few special effects, no computer graphics, no high paid superstar actors... It did it with a compelling plot, convincing acting, great character development, we can identify with the characters and their motivations, awesome vehicles, car chases (some of the best ever on the big screen) and stunts and it scores and A for creativity, especially the ending!  Just thinking about it there are at least a few of the most amazing car chases ever, only to be outdone by RW.  Aside from its sequel, The Road Warrior (which I would give 6 stars if possible), it's difficult to think of better post apocolypic or car chase movies that also have good acting and a real plot and character development.  Can you even think of a cooler car than Max's V8?  The other yellow and blue police cars are also so sweet.

As for this one and RW, they were copied countless times which is impressive to say the least.  For the movies weaknesses: RW avoided ""dating"" itself by disguising the cars and clothing so it couldn't be pinned on any specific date whereas Mad Max falls into the trap of appearing to take place in the 70's due to the clothing and autos and bikes.  Some have complained about the dubbing.  I have both versions, which are on this DVD, and actually prefer the American version over the Australian version.  Either is fine though, honestly.  Some say the movie is slow.  In rebuttal, the slowness occurs in the middle and is character development, showing the bond between Max and his wife before she is murdered, to further explain why he goes after the biker gang to extract revenge and also to help the viewer like Jessie as a charater.  If you took that out the viewer wouldn't be able to identify with the young mom, his love for her, and her brutal murder wouldn't be as powerful.  I think the film wouldn't be as solid if you took that part out.  Others have complained that the 'post apocolypic' world isn't nearly barren enough.  To rebut that, it's very realistic and hints at the gradual downfall of man. We're witnesses the progression.  Maybe some bombs have fallen somewhere else, maybe not.  It's never explained but it's clear that there is alot  of chaos.  The fact that the viewer has to ""think"" for a moment, rather than being spoonfed exactly what happened, it an asset to this movie.  The movie leaves it open to your imagination to tie it with the current world.  Maybe it's nukes elsewhere, maybe oil shocks have tightened the grip of oil and has ruined the economy, maybe it's a global war not directly affecting this region and most able bodied men have enlisted, maybe it's biological weapons elsewhere... we just don't know, nor is it important to the storyline.  Things are just really bad and society has decayed and that's all that's important. Civilization is in the process of decay.  There are few cops left (presumably they've been killed or quit and not replaced, or left to fight a war and Max stayed because of his family), the highways are dangerous and overrun with gangs most people stay off the roads, the police station is in ruins and a state of disarray inside, etc.  As for the viewer that said this movie was pointless, I don't understand his comment... This movie has as much ""point"" as any other movie.  It's entertaining and thought provoking. And, unlike so many others, it's got a good plot, good acting, and phenominal stunts and car chases.  An all time great made 30 years ago.",1125446400,2,3677,4.648606811145511
678910,4,6303471501,"Mad Max is a interesting little piece of movie history. While the script isn't all that compelling and the movie itself is obviously in the low budget arena Mad Max still stands out. Why? Because the movie for one doesn't try to be more than what it is. It's about fast moving vehicles and the heroes/villians who ride them. Move just a step above that and you get character development from both sides. Not much beyond that, but again the movie doesn't pretend to have more.

This is Mel Gibson's first starring movie role and he took the world by storm. This movie was a perfect vehicle to launch Mel's career. It gave him a chance to play the hansome hero with a full range of emotions (which he pulls off quite well). If it weren't for Gibson this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as good. Sure you get some good supporting actors, but lets face it. This movie is about Max, and Max has to carry the story.

The supporting cast for Mel isn't just the actors, but the vehicles as well. The police in this destopic future ride in fast interceptor cars. The bad guys are a nomad bike gang riding in various motor bikes. Max gets a really sweet car that becomes his trademark in not just this movie but the sequel as well. The cars definitely have character and the way they are filmed shows it. The chase scenes are fast and furious. No speeding up the cameras  to make it look fast here. This is the sort of excitement the movie excels at.

My only complaint is that Mad Max ends up just being a series of events that happen one after the other. The tie ins are sparse and the script is weak because of it. Then again this isn't Gone with the Wind. Still I have to at least mention it.

This DVD is a must have for any MM fans. Not only do you get the American released english version, but you also get the original Australian dub. Of the two the original comes out on top. Not because the ""American"" dub is bad. It's actually pretty good in the sense that the voice actors did a good job of it. The problem is the American version was done in mono and you don't get nearly as much environmental sounds and background noises as you do in the original. Also the Aussie dub is in stereo, which beats out mono anyday.

The DVD also comes with a couple featurettes that really hit home for the fans. One is more about Gibson and one is more about the movie. Both are very informative documentaries. I think even longstanding fans of Mad Max would find some new info in these.

To be honest Mad Max is not for everyone. If you demand blockbuster budget Hollywood style movies this isn't it. If you demand high art or deep stories you won't get it here either. However if you can get into a low budget movie that did one heck of a job in the car chasing department or are a fan of Mel Gibson then this is the movie for you.",1123459200,2,2819,4.248134328358209
678911,5,6303471501,"`Mad Max', an Australian flick and one of the very first movies to feature Mel Gibson has probably been seen by most people after they saw the two sequels, `The Road Warrior' and `Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome'. This circumstance has probably lead to a lot of misunderstandings about the circumstances of the original `Mad Max' plot.

Basicly, the story is about the failure of an organized system of justice, leading to a downward spiral of individual, outlaw revenge and retribution. Unlike the relatively new post-apocalyptic genres exemplified by the latter two movies, the issues of revenge are as old as the classic Greek playwrights, all the way up through Eugene O'Neill's take on the old Greek story of revenge in `Mourning Becomes Electra'.

There is but one little clue that this is a post nuclear war scenario. This is when we see a rusty and delapidated sign warning of a `Forbidden Area'. The only corroboration is the relatively poor condition of the sign over the entrance to the police station. Balanced against these minor visual clues is the spanking new sign over the door to the service station indicating that this is a licensed auto mechanic and the very clean and efficient looking hospital room and building.

So, if there is any failure of civilization, it is largely metaphorical and seen in the failure of the constraints of lawful behavior to prevent a series of events based on unbridled libido and revenge.

Of the `Mad Max' trilogy, the second, `The Road Warrior' is probably the best for many reasons, and it's connection to our current subject is loose at best and it's production values are far superior, but our original has an odd rawness about it which should not be confused with poor quality. TV stations would not be running this flick regularly if it did not have something special to offer.

By far the most valuable currency offered up by `Mad Max' is the anxiety created for Max's wife and child in the last third of the movie. The fear is about as raw as it comes, with an odd similarity, based on the crude cinematic technique all the way around, with the terror of the original `Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. The horror movie is much less artfully done and draws a lot of it's impact from pure quantity of gore, but there is a strong sense that both movies gain from a lack of polish.

Oddly, I think most of the juice in this movie comes less from Gibson's performance as that of the heavies. Unlike Harrison Ford's early appearances in `Star Wars', for example, I see little of the promise which Gibson shows in the second and third films in this series.

I will go out of my way to watch the second and third movies, but the first, this `Mad Max' is really something of a guilty pleasure which survives rewatching and grows in stature as time goes by.",1123372800,2,2797,4.661257606490873
679011,4,6303471501,"""Mad Max"" (1979) is a remarkable sci-fi actioner starring Mel Gibson, fresh from Sydney's National Institute of Dramatic Arts, and directed by George Miller, a film buff with film school training. Gibson plays Max Rockatansky, a loner cop patrolling a post-apocalyptic Australia. The highways have become the arena for death games between nomad bikers and cops like Max, along with his partner, Goose (Steve Bisely). Enter the Nightrider (Vince Gil), a vicious biker escaping custody. He has just stolen a car from the Main Force Patrol (MFP) headquarters. A road chase between Max and the Nightrider results in the death of the latter. Unbeknownst to Max, Nightrider's buddys come to town to seek revenge. They are headed by a demented lunatic named Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne). His followers are the mysterious Bubba Zanetti, the drug-addled Johnny the Boy (Nightrider's replacement; not yet a full member), and psychopathic rapists/homosexuals Mudguts, Cundalini, Starbuck, and Diabando. Whilst seeking vengeance upon Max, they wreak much havok along the way. This includes an assault on a young couple, and the slaying of Goose. A horrified Max quits the force, and takes his wife, Jessie (Joanne Samuel), and their baby Sprog, on a much-needed vacation. Unfortunately, Jessie is almost raped by the Toecutter and his gang, but she doesn't tell Max what happened. Rather, the Toecutter gang catches up with them and viciously murders Jessie and Sprog, leaving Max with no choice but to embark on an explosive path of vengeance upon his tormentors. The biker gang is completely without empathy, except for Johnny the Boy, who became a full gang member only after reluctantly setting Goose on fire. The Toecutter is perhaps the creepiest, nastiest villain to ever grace the screen, while Bubba Zanetti epitomizes the ruthless killing-machine whose mission to destroy Max. The other bikers are no less sadistic than the Toecutter. The movie works mostly because of Gibson's performance as the damaged hero, Max. It also features great effects and remarkable stunts, and spawned an even more successful sequel, The Road Warrior (1981). Overall, a very good action film. Only quibble: actors' voices were re-dubbed with American voices, out of fear that audiences wouldn't comprehend the Australians' accent.",1118275200,,2308,5.343406593406593

Parts tend to drag near the end, but only for a few minutes, and its right back to the action. It is basically a revenge story, but its quirks really make it work.

679017,5,6303471501,"Mel Gibson was originally dubbed over, as mostly all the other actors where also, to create an ""English Language"" soundtrack version of Mad Max for its worldwide distribution. Thus pre-DVD the only way to hear Mel's original voice (the one he had when he turned up with bandages across his face with blood under the patches and the casting agents knew they had found Mad Max, an outback young lad with some good looks and a penchant for licking out of the bottle all day long) was to get the Australian version of the film on video tape. Now on ""Special Edition!! (Check to make sure this review is for that version as Amazon sometimes changes products and moves reviews!)"" DVD you can hear Mad Max the way it was meant to sound - 1 track Australian mono audio - but to be honest why brother with any 5:1 digital upgrade or a 2:1 English track?... unless you can't understand the original audio, in which case just turn to the subtitles.

1979 Mad Max made its break onto the scene for one reason and one reason alone - the dawn of ""Ultraviolence"", Mad Max was instantly slapped with an X rating in Europe and was heavily criticised for being bloody graphic and too obscene for most viewers, George Miller had in fact delivered on very little blood on the screen, creating instead intensive bullying and quick flash cuts, probably dummies going under trucks or the jump cut subliminal frames of eyes jumping out of their sockets before a crash, people had never seen this kind of violence on the screen before, George Miller having himself already produced a violent twenty minute test film ""Violence in Cinema Pt 1"" (1971), knew there was a market for this thing, and there was, Mad Max produced several memorable posters for the first movie, each one either a cartoon or a still of anything other than Mad Max, the artwork always seemed to make people believe they where walking in on some sort of high budget Australian sci-fi violent action film, when in fact they where just viewing a bunch of guys with a 35mm camera, sticky tape and no fear of the brand new superbikes that could do 200 mph on the back roads of Oz. Peter Jackson obviously watched re-runs of this while making his Bad Taste. Low budget film makers know that Mad Max is probably just as important as Evil Dead that came out two years after it, in terms of how to make a low budget film that works. Just look at Mad Max, no one had two coins to rub together, yet they have a movie that spawned no less than two sequels and made an A-list Hollywood actor out of the lead, that is not bad going at all.

The result is a very mish-mash of acting inabilities, poorly directed non-violent stuff, wonderful atmosphere, nice amateur camerawork, film speed ups to create the illusion of faster motion, that mostly actually work,  but it is long and drawn out, taking well over an hour for Max Rockatanski to loose some loved ones, going after the ""Toecutter"" a biker and his crew for a bit of road rage and revenge, this is the first film in which children are murdered (all suggestive; like a ball and shoe rolling down the road) because of bad driving, people visibly go under trucks and some `burnings alive' but nothing that is graphic (the most graphic scene being a severed hand hanging from a chain) it was the illusion of manic bikers going psycho on the streets that was so easy for everybody at the end of the 1970s and start of the 1980s to believe, so naturally they bought into all the stuff because aristocratic systems had man blaming each other for their own problems and not bad management of government, the ""Halls of Justice"" scenes in which arrested druggie bikers who kill are set free because of a technicality, all of this to people was very real at the time, a real fear, then suddenly a victim hero emerges from the rubble to clean up the mess himself, Mad Max is a bit of a defining moment in the genre, generated a better sequel in terms of budget and action, but this original is still very much the more important offering because of what it is. The Original Ultraviolent Action Film that Played on people's Belief's Systems of What a Criminal Was. It was as good then as say making a film about Mid-Eastern terrorists going on a rampage across America <--- take note all you budding young film makers.",1110758400,4,4295,4.510911424903723
679018,5,6303471501,"I remember seeing ""Mad Max"" in the spring of 1980.  Now this was the days before multiplexes.  ""Mad Max"" was distributed by American International Pictures, Samuel Z. Arkoff's outfit whose forte was drive-in fare i.e. Grade B action and horror films.  I was seventeen at the time and the way this film was promoted was appealing to me.  The TV commercials were full of car chases and fast action.  When I saw the film naturally it was a real rush.  It didn't disappoint in the action department and the good guys were good and the bad guys were vile.  Something seemed a little off to me, though.  The landscape didn't look like anything that I was familiar with in America.  The speaking parts seemed a little off even though they were distinguishable American accents.  One of actresses in a minor role, Sheila Florence(May) was familiar to me from a popular Australian women's prison soap-opera from that time,""Prisoners of Cell-Block H"". Never mind.  If this film was reviewed at all it was generally dismissed as exploitation trash.  I forgot about this film completely until I read a review of it in ""Time"" magazine, I think it was Richard Schickel, a couple months later extolling the virtues of this high-octane action thrill-ride.  The next I heard of Mel Gibson he was appearing in the highly praised ""Gallipoli"" this time speaking in an Australian accent.  Summer of 1982, ""The Road Warrior""(or ""Mad Max 2"" as it was known overseas) was released to better box office and critical acceptance.  Home video was breaking at that time and both ""Road Warrior"" and it's lesser received original were released around the same time.  The legend continued to grow.  I watched ""Mad Max"" numerous times over the years and always enjoyed it but those bogus accents were always a detriment even as Mel Gibson's celebrity continued to grow.  I'd watch it and try to imagine what it should sound like by inserting in my mind Mel Gibson's actual voice instead of that lame dubbed voice.  Now,finally, we have the version that should have been available all along, ""Mad Max"" in all it's down-under glory.  For those who don't remember the original ""American-version"" of ""Mad Max"" don't even bother to seek it out.  I don't feel the least bit nostalgic for it.  This is the ""Mad Max"" that should have been available all along and we can leave the old ""Max"" to the garbage heap.",1104624000,8,2369,4.7690417690417695
679019,4,6303471501,"George Miller launched Mel Gibson's career in this low-budget film about a solo cop who's out for justice after his partner and family are killed by ruffians.  Although the film doens't have the explicit apocalyptic theme and plot of its sequel, this film has plenty of high-speed chases and tension to keep the audience entertained.

Mad Max (Gibson) is one of a few cops in a small town being ravaged by a motorcyle gang.  After several tragedies, Mad Max is left alone is swears to exact vengeance on the gang of outlaws.

Again, the film isn't too clear about its setting: there's no express indication that this is in a post-apocalyptic future as with the film's sequels.  The theme and plot is more along the lines of a standard 'Dirty Harry' or 'Death Wish' film.  Despite these differences, the film is still a great film to watch with plenty of suspense and action.  A great film to watch many times.",1092009600,,909,4.64375
679020,5,6303471501,"Mel Gibson has a history of playing borderline psychotic, revenge-driven loners from contemporary actioner Martin Riggs (""Lethal Weapon"") to widescreen epic hero William Wallace (""Braveheart"") to hard-boiled noir tough guy Porter (""Payback"") to historical fiction family-man-pushed-too-far Benjamin Martin (""The Patriot"") to the classic Shakespearean originator of the mold Prince Hamlet (""Hamlet"").  You could almost say it's his niche.

And in all fairness, he started young.  Mel Gibson was an impossible 21 years old when he starred in this 1979 throwback to 1960's biker thrillers produced by the then-unknown team of George Miller and Byron Kennedy.  A huge hit in Australia, it was limited to small theatres, drive-ins, and arthouse runs in the United States...where, despite a dubbed dialogue track that would make most kung fu movies seem Academy Award-worthy, it picked up a loyal cult following and enabled a small group of would-be hipsters to be able to say ""Mel Gibson?  Oscars? P'shaw...he'll always be 'Max Rockitansky' to me.""

The movie is not exactly original...it's a redux of the American western with elements of the aforementioned biker flicks, but it is VERY original in its use of some very innovative cinematography (cameras mounted at fender-level on fast-moving cars...I'm not certain it had ever been done before) and some of the more unbelievable stunts ever filmed, the like of which would not be seen again until the sequel's release in 1982 (""Mad Max 2"" or ""The Road Warrior"", depending on your location).  The action is more personal because it is REAL.

Mel Gibson's performance might not seem on par with his better roles since, but the role he was playing was that of someone much older than himself at the time...and it can't be denied that even at 21 he had a command of the camera he has never relinquished; you can't take your eyes off him.  Of his earlier roles Gibson is rather self-conscious of his performance in ""Mad Max""; he refers to himself as ""Mr. Porkchop"" in this movie, somehow under the impression that he must have been overweight at the time...but fans of his will want to see this movie to see how he looked before his days as a household name and to chart his development as an actor.

Fans of action movies will want to see how movies of this nature looked in the ""old skool"" days before high-budget special effects when the level of action in your movie was dictated by how far your stuntment were willing to push the envelope of sanity.  In Australia during the making of this movie and ""The Road Warrior"", it fast became evident that no such envelope even existed.  The result is a piece of hand-made brilliance of guerilla filmmaking that would inspire latter day innovators such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez into accomplishing so much with so little.

And of course the fact that this DVD is equipped with the Australian dialogue track is a selling point unto itself (it also  shows exactly why a dub track was used for US distribution; it's not that we can't understand the accent, mates...we just have no idea what the slang means).  That and the commentary track by the production team make well-received treats for those of us who are old enough to have loved this film since its original release.  A retrospective on Mel Gibson's career and its beginnings is also a nice addition.  I can only hope that ""The Road Warrior"" gets a similar treatment (and soon).

In short you have a great movie with a a great DVD extras package at a VERY reasonable price...I don't know what more a movie buff could ask.  This is definitely a ""must-own"" for your collection.",1091836800,,3637,4.8845528455284555

679144,3,6303471501,"Who wouldn't watch a movie that had Mel Gibson wearing obscenely tight leather trousers, and looking scarily young?
Before The Passion was brought to the attention of film buffs, and the press, there was Lethal Weapon. And before that, Mel Gibson made his name in the Mad Max movies.
There's nothing on the DVD I got for my birthday, not even a trailer. And I hate watching DVDs with no trailers. I'm fussy me. So I wasn't sure what to expect, or what the film was exactly about. All I knew was that my mum couldn't wait to watch it, and was drooling (along with me) when Mel Gibson appeared shirtless.
Before the amount of money that was spent in the car chase along a freeway in Matrix Reloaded, there was this. A simple, but still effective car chase, which introduces you very briefly to Max. I don't see the point in spending loads of money, when all you need is a bunch of cars that can be trashed, and a camera.
Then you get to see that Max has a pretty young wife and a young child. You can almost see how the rest of the movie pans out after that. It's pretty obvious, he's not mad until something really traumatic happens. I was expecting the whole growling, throwing stuff, but instead, he seemed relatively calm - except for the sweat on his face.
It's NOT obvious that this movie could get another two sequels out of it. Maybe one sequel, but two? And the latter featuring Tina Turner of all people. And there's rumoured to be a fourth, along with a fourth Die Hard, and god knows what else. Something tells me Mel Gibson won't fit into those trousers!
If you think this is going to be a movie based on revenge, you're wrong. The revenge part doesn't start until about half an hour before the end.
It will be interesting to see the sequels. To be honest, this film did nothing for me - unless you count the tight trousers! Very easy on the eyes, if you know what I mean.",1084320000,,1883,4.322033898305085

679146,4,6303471501,"I like the _Mad Max_ series, but I think the two sequels are better movies than this one.
It's not that it's _bad_. It's just that it consists mostly of an hour and a half of atmosphere. Another film would have had this entire plot take place in the first half-hour and gone on from there.
The idea -- a postapocalyptic mood piece set in the Australian Outback -- is wonderful, and naturally enough the scenery is gorgeous. And considering the shoestring the movie must have been made on, it's very good. It's just not much fun to watch twice, because it takes so bleedin' long for anything to _happen_.
The best thing about it is the young Mel Gibson, who perfected the likeable-handsome-lug persona a generation ahead of George Clooney and who plays Max with just the right combination of rogueish charm and leonine ferocity. When he finally _does_ go 'mad', his puckish humor evaporates and he burns like a slow and deadly fire.
The rest of the cast does well too -- and having previously owned this film on VHS, I'm glad that the DVD special edition includes the original voices. The thick Strine may be a little hard for U.S. audiences to follow at first, but once you pick up the wavelength you won't have any trouble. (Besides, the old U.S. dubbed version is available as an option.)
Anyway, as a longtime SF geek and an avid devourer of postapocalytpic films and novels, I really like the atmosphere and the concept of this movie. I just have a hard time watching it too many times close together. For that, I prefer the two sequels.
But this one is still worth watching, and owning, for the story it tells -- the mythical tale of the birth of one of modern cinematography's great heroes/antiheroes.",1072569600,5,1707,4.6

If you're a fan of The Road Warrior then You owe it to yourself to see the original Max Rockatansky before he became a shell of a man. Officer Rockatansky was a great cop, husband and father in a time when morals and quality of life were on the decline.
Some reviewers have mentioned this movie was not so ""Post Apocalyptic"" or high tech. I must remind you this story is set before ""the world went to war"", you have to pay attention to really appreciate this movie, if you do, you'll notice the Main Force (police) has only 5 or 6 cars for a whole county, a police station with giant holes on the roof, and gangs of men who have realized there is more gain by going out on the roads/towns and pillaging than in searching for non-available jobs. This is, quite simply, the beginning of the end.
I gave this one 5 Stars as this DVD has changed the way I judge other movies on DVD. The remastering process was done so well, it looks like a movie filmed in the 90's! It actually looks better/newer than my Batman and Matrix DVD's. Lots of trivia too. Something else you should know is that this movie was put together with a budget of $200k odd US dollars, volunteer riders and many rookie actors, and it still managed to become an inspiring cult classic. This was a great low budget film brought to life by the talented George Miller/Byron Kennedy team.
Watch this movie along with it's sequel The Road Warrior and you will not be disapointed, you may skip ""Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome"" because by the time this movie was made, Byron Kennedy, the producer to whom its dedicated, had died and Hollywood's save the -lil' childrens- big budget hype ruined the rest.

Mel Gibson plays the title character, ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky, a cop in a postapocalyptic future (when exactly isn't specified).  He's the best cop around, patroling the highways for speed-hungry gang members.  Well, after his best friend is killed and Max steps in, the gang gets a little mad.  In the end, Max (now gone a little beyond Mad) sets out to avenge the death of his wife and infant child, both killed by the gang.
MAD MAX is a sci-fi classic that spawned one of the best-loved sci-fi series of all-time.  Miller's directing style brings the needed impact to the seemingly dead futuristic earth.  Gibson is also good in his star-making role (look at how young he is...wow!) - plus Brian May (not the Queen Brian May) contributes a good score.

679235,5,6303471501,"As an Aussie who saw this as a boy way back in 1980 I am saddened and dumbfounded to find that this was ever the victim of pathetic overdubs into US speak from the original Australian, as though this helped the film in any way? Was the premise that Americans are so jingoistic that they aren't capable of understanding English spoken by Australians, or simply that Americans only want to hear themselves? In any case this is a classic Aussie film back in the days when Mel Gibson considered himself an Aussie and was seen by Aussies to be an Australian.
I won't harp on about the plot because other reviewers have done the plot to death. This film was shot in South Australia and the many brilliant and genius techniques for filming the amazing road scenes were developed by the Australian Director of this movie, later to be adopted by film makers the world over. Anybody who doesn't understand that this movie is the BEST of the series has missed the point of MAD MAX as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure Aussies and Kiwi's alike understand the superb grittyness which has the stamp of Australian and New Zealand (Once Were Warriors) film making all over it without losing all the best features of great film making to HOLLYWOODISM...
MAD MAX 2 was also a good film but Thunderdome became too Hollywood for my money and sadly doesn't do justice to the series like the original.

The action scenes are fantastic, but one difference between this and your average action film is the character Max, and his futuristic environment.

679346,5,6303471501,"Mel Gibson is without a doubt one of Hollywood's greatest actors, Mad Max was one of Gibson's first movies, & you can tell by watching it that his success since(20 years to be exact) has not spoiled him, In this he is Max, a cop of the future where society has broken down, & he is one of the last remaining cops patroling the savage streets, we learn that Max has a family & tries for the most part to be normal in a burnt out wasteland, the film begins with an outlaw named Knightrider who has broken loose & has killed a fellow officer, he is pursued by two cop cars, & is being chased, Max's partner Jim Goose soon joins the pursuit, but he & the two cars end up wrecking thus knocking them out of the pursuit, Goose then radios Max who the Knightrider will soon be approaching, to begin pursuit, which he does...with intensity, causing the Knightrider to crash & burn, he is killed as Max watches from a distance, what makes this film good is its direction, we see the friendship between Goose & Max that is as good as any friendship, Max's boss is interesting to watch as you can see he cares about his men, we are then introduced to the Knightrider's motorcycle buddies who have come to get revenge on those responsible, mostly the cops & Max himself, Toecutter, the gang's leader is fun to watch, he is without a doubt a humorous villian, you almost can't help but like him, as he talks poetically about the Knightrider, his loyalty to his fallen comrade is deep as he & his men soon terrorize anyone & everyone, thus bringing the attention of Max & Goose who soon arrest Johnny, the inexperienced member of the group, it is clear that a woman has been raped & Johnny has stayed behind awaiting capture, or has he, it never becomes clear, the rape has a vengeful effect on Goose who refuses to release Johnny after his bail has been set & he is to be released, Goose is soon restrained as Johnny agitates him, promising revenge, Goose is soon set up & is burned beyond recognition, Max feeling the loss takes time off with his wife & child, but soon he & his family are stalked by the group & his wife is soon confronted alone & intimidated, she escapes but she along with their child is run down, with the loss of his family & friend, Max becomes a lost soul & lone vigilante, who uses his wit & skill to exact revenge in his new Interceptor Police car, that has a turbo blast that creates unbelieveable speed, when Toecutter, Bubba, & Johnny are the only ones left, they set up Max & gun him down, Bubba soon attempts to finish him, but is killed instead, Johnny then flees the scene, as does Toecutter, Max then goes after Toecutter in a rather satisfying scene in which Max uses his Turbo power to pursue Toecutter in a tense scene that has Max with nothing but vengence in his eyes, Toecutter is soon killed as is Johnny, & has Max fleeing into the wasteland that would continue in ""The Road Warrior"" a great follow-up, this film had a cult following & it is a true gem, movies like this just don't get made anymore, & the original Aussie dialogue is much more surreal than the dubbed version, & Mel Gibson proved in this film the star he would later become, this new DVD is sharp & clear, & is definately a must for any Mel Gibson fan!!!!!",1030665600,5,3253,4.334426229508197
679347,5,6303471501,"It actually isn't Gibson's first movie, he had a small role in one before Mad Max, but this is his first starring role, and the one that began his ascent into fame. Mad Max is set in Australia, in the near future. It hasn't gotten as post-apocalyptic as Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, but you get a definite feel of bleakness and of the apocalypse. What Mad Max is, is basically a car movie. But what a car movie. The cinematography is great (and at times dangerous for the camera operator).
As a dvd, the Special Edition is great (the reason I haven't bought Road Warrior is that I'm hoping they'll be releasing a special edition with the extras like contained on Mad Max). The commentary track doesn't have the director or Gibson, but it does have the DOP, Art Director, a film historian, and so on. They give a lot of great insight into the making of this film. There is also a 'trivia track' which flashes up trivia during the film. It also will point out every continuity error in the film. One of the great highlights of the dvd is that it is the original Australian recording (though you can access the American dubbing, but I think that is more for showing what dubbing does rather than to watch). There are a couple of featurettes and trailers. It's really a good dvd. And a great movie.",1030233600,,1302,4.451882845188284

679349,5,6303471501,"As Bob Denver, for all practical purposes, became ""Gilligan,"" in real life -- as Frances Bouvier became ""Aunt Bea,"" and Bob Keeshan ""Captain Kangaroo"" -- the young and beautiful Melvin Gibson, in this earliest of roles, was incredibly, unbelievably fortunate to avoid career-long typecasting as nothing but a cheesecake, eye-candy, silver-screen pretty-boy.
This fine debut film, in which Melvin Gibson had to do little more than look extremely nice, exude male lusciousness and wear tight leather pants, came dangerously close to relegating him to Fabio status, committing him to a relatively brief film future of appearance-only, stand-and-model roles in subsequent movies.  However, the overwhelming power of Melvin's acting talent (facial expressions, talking, walking, and driving vehicles) -- the raw guts of thespian talent and drive -- managed to save him from a perpetuation of calendar pin-up roles, catapulting him to an infinitely higher plane of cinematic accomplishment than is accessible by a mere male model (see Bird On A Wire, The River, Lethal Weapon VII, etc, Melvin's list is literally endless).
It was that determination which wrenched Melvin Gibson out of the male-model mold and elevated him to Oscar quality.  Think of Gomer and Goober Pyle, of Herman Munster, Dan Rather and Sheila Jackson Lee... and see how intertwined, how enmeshed, how tied up those actors became with their roles.  Melvin Gibson was lucky to avoid the same sort of typecasting that severely restricted the careers of these unfortunate folks, and would have condemned him to being known for the rest of his life as nothing but a darn good looking hunk of meat (as they say).
We all knew Goober Pyle -- and we can all say for a definite fact that Melvin Gibson (Mad Max) is no Goober Pyle.",1024531200,,1785,5.1271477663230245

Mad Max is a superb blend of good acting and great cinematography that produce a movie which is far more credible as a depiction of a decaying world that most Hollywood productions.

The DVD I have has heightend this,particulaly in widescreen.
Mel Gibson likened the character of Max to that of a card-board cut-out. I never looked at Mad Max like that. What i saw was a guy who was desperatly hanging onto the shreds of civility in a society that was becoming debased and uncivilised (one could liken it to living in Germany before the holocaust and coming out the other end) where security was insecure. Even Max wanted to quit Main Force Patrol because he likend himself to that of the gangs, where it was becoming increasingly impossible to distinquish between that which was good or bad. After Jim Goose and Max's family have perished you see a side to him that many of us can relate to - vengence. When he confronts the murderers in the closing scenes it is not with joy that retribution is extracted but with a righteous anger against that which is evil. All in all Mad Max is the original. The Road Warrior and Beyond (eek !!) Thunderdoom become over-shadowed by the fact that Mad Max leaves them for dead in the smoke from His Interceptor.",1021507200,,1184,4.435779816513762

Man was I blown away. This was one of my favorite movies. Now it is my favorite! How they could have released this movie with the overdub is insane. It's like watching a brand new movie.

679354,4,6303471501,"Y'know, when I'm in the mood to watch a good post-apocalypse movie with lotsa high-speed cars & `cycles, and plenty of collisions & explosions, I just gotta turn to the original `Mad Max' to satiate my needs! And the new DVD presentation of `Mad Max' does just that! Not only do I get both the original Australian AND US-dub voice tracks, I also get a better picture than what I used to see on my now-well-worn VHS tape of the flick! The picture isn't absolutely perfect, though, but this is more likely due to the quality of the original print than the quality of the transfer to DVD.
Although I'm happy to finally be able to view and hear `Mad Max' in its original Australian dialogue, I have a certain sense of nostalgia for the American dub as well, as it gives the flick more of a weird Godzilla-like style & cheesiness to it! But if I had my `druthers, I'd take the original voice track. Why, you ask? Well, there's just something not quite right about an American-accented voice-over uttering ""strewth!"", you know? But never the less, I have fun switching back and forth between the two tracks as I'm watching. I'm amazed by how well-synchronized they are-- I click from Aussie to Yankee & back, and I miss narry a word of the dialogue! And yes, people, this IS my idea of a good time. Pretty sad, huh?
Anyway, on to the special features. The commentary track contains the usual mix of anecdotes and behind-the-scenes memories that one has come to expect from movie commentary tracks. I was somewhat disappointed none of the four contributors was co-writer/director George Miller, but I guess I'll just have to deal with it. Then there's the trivia feature, which works somewhat like VH1's Pop-Up music video in that it comes on the screen every several seconds with a new factoid about the flick. Many of the trivia tidbits cover the make & model of the various cars, trucks, and motorcycles that appear here, as well as letting the non-Aussie viewer in on some of the native lingo that's heard here. Also mentioned are some of the technical aspects of particular scenes, as well as revealing where certain scenes were shot. Unfortunately, I've read that some of the lingo & location trivia bits are incorrect. Which is something of a letdown, but at least I've been given fair warning...
Also included are a couple of documentaries which cover the making of `Mad Max' as well as taking a look at the early days of Mel Gibson's acting career. Like the commentary track, there's plenty of amusing anecdotes and details about the more technical parts of the movie, especially the great crash & collision stunts that one sees throughout the flick. One of the BTS doc's interviewees even refers to `Mad Max' as being ""porn for people who like fast cars"" because of all the high-velocity vehicles and stunts! Now that's a most unusual analogy if ever I saw (or, rather, heard) one! Other neat momes include the fanboy who bought and restored Mad Max's MFP Interceptor, and the prop that helped make the Toecutter's eye-popping demise so memorable!

With its dark tone and brutal violence, this is probably the first movie of its kind to de-glamorize car chases.  Several such sequences are thrilling (Particularly the opening car chase, one of the better ones in film history) but well-crafted as it often is, the pace is snail-like, and the dialogue and scene transitions are sometimes rather silly.

After Mel Gibson's wife is killed, he just goes after her murderers and is total merciless!  The most memorable scene, to me, is the one where Max handcuffs one of the killers to a car, rigs it to explode, and then gives the guy a hacksaw, saying something like ""You've got five minutes to live.  You could cut threw the handcuffs in ten.  You could probably cut threw your wrist in 4.""  That is such a cool scene!

This latest offering is by far the best, and the film is presented the way the director intended.  This film is non stop action, and makes the move to DVD very well.  Picture and sound 100%.  BUT for a US audience, it may be a bit hard to follow, from the perspective of different accent and Australian slang that are common in the movie.  The provision of subtitles does assist the US viewer.  The Trivia track certainly does not, it is rather an insult to the intelligence of any viewer, I'm at a loss to know why it was included.  For example: a conversation between Max and Goose - Goose - ""Hey Max, he looks....."" indicating a man running away, ('he looks'..... like he is in trouble etc. etc.)  The trivia track helpfully states that Goose is saying ""SEELOOKS"" i.e. Australian ""slang"" for a 'look see'.  Being an Australian, and having never heard of this ANYWHERE, EVER, I wondered what fool made this up and INCLUDED it on the trivia track!!!  Especially as the english subtitles show Goose as saying the correct line (as verified from original script) line ""Hey Max, he looks...."". Another example was the Trivia track nominates the location of Max's beach house as ""Fairhaven, West Australia"" WRONG, Its' Fairhaven , Victoria.  (If you are not familiar with Australian geography - they didn't miss by much, just the OTHER SIDE  of the continent.  Similar to New York/California).  On and on it goes.

Traditionally, MGM has released bare-bones, movie-only DVDs with bad transfers and horrid sound - but, thankfully, tradition seems to be losing out to what consumers want.  Mad Max: Special Edition is the latest offering from MGM's film vaults to make its way onto DVD in a restored, high-performance disc, and it's about time, too.
Mad Max will probably go down in history as the film that made Mel Gibson a star, but that would gloss over the film's many other virtues.  A post-apocalyptic tale of good vs. evil, Mad Max features the title character, Max Rockatansky, in his job as an ""Interceptor,"" a kind of cop struggling to maintain order in a world where the government has all but collapsed and ruthless biker thugs and warlords have made normal life impossible.  When Max kills a member of the gang, their leader, the Toecutter, turns around and butcher's Max's family.  As a result, Max gets very mad and goes straight to kick-ass mode.  The story is slick and well-told, with enough fast cars, gun battles, and extreme chases to keep you tied to your chair.  It's basically a Western set in a decaying Australia, and it's a welcome change of pace for action fans, too.
MGM presented us with a two-sided, dual-layer DVD that has two versions of the film: a gorgeous 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen transfer, and a full-screen copy on the same side for those who don't like to see the whole movie.  For the first time, American audiences get to watch the film with the original Australian dialogue (it was dubbed with American actors for the US and never released with the original accents before now), either in the old-school mono mix or a completely redone, deep and dynamic DD 5.1 remix.  On the other side you get two mini-documentaries, one about the Mad Max series and how the crews made the films (informative), and one about Mel Gibson's rise to stardom (blah).  Round that out with a pop-up video style ""trivia track"" (really just a subtitle option), and you've got a great disc.
The pop-up video track is one of the best and most innovative new features in a long time; I hope other DVD companies take note, because it's fun, informative, and you can watch it again and again, unlike most commentary tracks and other ""extras.""

Print damage still appears in places, but given the fact that the movie is twenty three years old, that's expected. But what blew me away is the sound of the 5.1 Aussie English Audio track(that's right, the original soundtrack). Unlike the local video release, the audio is as clear as a bell. Low sounding dialogue is understandable, clear and crisp. The dispatchers voice isn't muffled, and Brian May's musical composition plays more powerfully, while mixing effortlessly and complimenting the action sequences more effectively than ever.

679599,5,6303471501,"For fans of George Miller's first ""Mad Max"" movie, this is the version for which we've been waiting more than 20 years for . . . the original Australian dialogue version.  While the American voice actors tried to do their best to capture the characters and the synchronization was generally good, the dubbing, on the whole, lacks the subtleties that the original actors, speaking in their natural dialect, brought to the screen.  Further, in the U.S. dubbed version, there was no appreciable attempt to change the Australian slang used thoughout the film, making the dubbing even more pointless than it already was.
Beyond the new audio track, there is much more on this DVD to merit inclusion in your collection.  The DVD presents the film in both anamorphic widescreen and full-frame formats.  Now why anyone would want to watch ""Mad Max"" in full-frame is beyond me, but you can effectively recreate the VHS viewing experience of the last 15 plus years by selecting the full-frame video and U.S. dub audio options.  There are also two newly produced, informative documentaries included, one on the making of the film and the other on the early Australian (pre-1980) film career of Mel Gibson.  There's also a terrific audio commentary with several of the behind-the-scenes film crew members, including the Director of Photography, David Eggby.  In one telling sequence, Eggby mentions that he had no idea how fast and dangerous the filming actually was while seated on the back seat of a motorcycle for a POV shot.  It was only after he saw the daily rushes one day, that he noticed that the speedometer of the bike appeared in the shot and that it registered 180 kilometers per hour (approximately 110 mph)!
The DVD also includes the usual trailer and TV spots, a photo gallery of international posters and lobby cards, and even a hidden, but not too difficult to find ""Easter Egg.""  All in all, MGM has done a superlative job on this ""Special Edition"" DVD, easily exceeding, by a far margin, the two sequel DVDs released by Warner's (""The Road Warrior"" and ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"").",1010448000,14,2091,4.8841807909604515
679600,4,6303471501,"""Mad Max"" is a pretty simple revenge tale, a rousing sci-fi biker and car-crash-a-thon. Mel Gibson plays Max, a police pursuit driver in an unspecified future where roadgangs terrorize the innocent. Evidently road rage is way out of hand! When motorcycle thugs kill Max's best friend Goose (amiable Steve Bisley), his wife (Joanne Samuel) and son Sprog (!), Max gets mad... and gets even. What elevates this drive-in flick to cult classic status is director George Miller's use of low-riding, wide-angled shots to give the chase scenes an intensity never before seen. And Mel's presence, too, I suppose. Mel looks awful young, but flashes the charm and charisma that keeps him atop the box office charts all these years later.

Like all cult movies, ""Mad Max"" has its cheesy moments. Max's scenes with his wife feature some goofy dialogue, and there's a very cheap-looking nightclub set at one point. But Hugh Keays-Byrne, as the reprehensible Toecutter, and Tim Burns (an Adam Ant lookalike) as the psychotic Johnny, provide ample menace. Plus, Miller and company throw in some very unusual-looking supporting players. And then there are the spectacular stunts and kinetic camerawork; they've been ripped-off a thousand times since!

This ""Special Edition"" features a crisp, widescreen print (ooh!) and, even better, the original Australian vocal track (ahh!). Finally, someone wised up and banished the cartoon voices. The original actors perform solidly throughout, even subtly in places. At last, you can see why Samuel Z. Arkoff would bother to import this movie. But why'd he mangle it with bad overdubbing? No matter. The sequel (""Road Warrior"") remains the superior film, but this new-to-the-U.S. version of the first movie provides some adrenaline-inducing adventure. Includes some nice commentary with plenty of inside trivia on the stuntwork and how they risked their lives just filming it! Truly death-defying work.

First off, get this DVD. If all you have ever seen is the USA version with the awful dubbed American voices, then you have not seen the true Mad Max movie.
Let me say something about dubbing: it normally doesn't come off well, especially when you redub English with English, as is the case with Mad Max. You lose ALL the emotions that the actors had originally portrayed in the movie. With Mad Max, this is entirely true. In fact, the actors that did the dubbed voices completely carried their emotions over the edge to the point of campiness. In no WAY did they portray the real emotions of the characters and it ruined the movie. It actually made excellent actors look bad and made the entire movie campy, which it isn't. It has it's moments of humor that actually fill in nicely with the Aussie voices, but is pushed over the edge in campiness with the American dubbing. It really is that bad, especially now that I've seen it with the Aussie voices.
Once I saw this movie with the original Aussie voices, my opinion changed. I may be so bold as to say that this movie is possibly better than Mad Max 2 - The Road Warrior (and let's get that changed to Mad Max 2 now since everyone knows about Mad Max). What really upset me was that in the American version, they even ADDED dialogue that was SO unnecessary! I didn't realise this until I saw the Aussie version.
This is not only a great action movie, but a wonderful drama as well. It has so many elements from different genres: action, suspense, horror, drama. George Miller put together an excellent movie on such a low budget.
A lot of the elements were lost due to the dubbing but have now been brought back to life with this DVD release. One case is when Mel is talking to Jessie after Goose buys the farm. In the American dubbed version, Max doesn't seem that broken up about it. However, hearing Mel's voice, you can hear how Max is near tears, upset and sad that his best friend is dead. It really brings you closer to the characters to the point that you feel for them as real people. This was driven home to me even more during the scene when Jessie and Sprog are about to be mowed down by the Toecutter and his band of seedy thugs. When Jessie was running away, my mood turned to sadness, knowing what was about to happen. Once it happened, that sadness turned to extreme anger. When Max finally extracts his revenge, I was cheering. That NEVER happened with the American dubbed version.
The DVD has two excellent documentories: one on how the movie was made and the other about Mel Gibson's rise to fame. There are also trailers, TV spots and posters available as well as the original American dubbed (mono) track, a commentary track, and a trivia track that pops up cool trivia bits while you watch the movie.
At the price they have listed, this is a steal!...No true Mad Max fan would be without this movie. It was SO excellent that I watched it twice the day I bought it.

The best part about the DVD is the ability to either watch the American dubbed version(ick) or the Aussie version.

The violence is this film is rather tame, often cutting away to show something that may be not as gory, but is just as shocking.  The chases in this film are incredible (and the more surprising since this was made before the advent of CGI).  The new DVD release has some rather interesting treats, such as the original Australian audio, as opposed to the dubbed version that floats around on television (the fact there doesn't seem to be a problem with understanding the dialogue in the original track makes me wonder why it hasn't been released like this in the U.S. for so long), plus you can pick between seeing the film in Widescreen or Pan&Scan (widescreen...no contest on how I watch it), a documentary on the film's influence, and a commentary by members of the crew (who explain some of the more startling sequences in the movie).

While the film is still the same, the atmosphere is far different because since the voice aren't as over the top as the dubbed version. The nomad bikers are far more menacing, ""the Goose"" is more charasmatic and Mel himself more believable. Unfortunately nothing can save that painful ""brown shoes"" scene, but, hey, that's what the ""fast forward"" is for.
If I had any problem with this version at all it would be that, since they moved it to 5:1 sound, sometimes the voices get lost in the background over music swells. It's one thing when dialog is drowned out by a roaring motor (that happens in real life), but when the actors are lost to an orchestral punch, it can be annoying.

This soon turns into irritation as you try to marry the characters with the new 'foreign' voices, and try to spot dubbing errors (lips moving but no sound & vice versa),and deliberate substitution of words (there R some of these as well), AND, try to watch the story, for the rest of the film.
I knew there was a dubbed version, but i thought it was called 'Road Warrior' or something.
The sad thing is, for me to return it will cost more than the video is worth (had i only been informed in the synopsis)

It was a great hit and had two sequels follow it. Only difference about them was that they were during a post-apocalyptic period. But this one is the best one of all in the entire trilogy. It is a pretty normal movie with regular things happening most of the time. The action doesn't start until the end when Max Rockatanski seeks revenge on a nomad biker gang for the murder of his wife and infant son. Max starts out as a kind loving man. But once everything in his life falls apart and he loses the people who are most important to him, he no longer sees the need to care for the lives of others. The evil bikers led by the Toecutter all suffer painful and terrible deaths for what they had done to Max's family. He starts out as a regular man with a job who has a family and a best friend. But sometime in the movie, Jim Goose, his best friend, is murdered as well. Then Max decides to quit his job due to that one event. He just happens to lose everything he had. All you see of him in the end is Max driving a Canyonero and armed with a shotgun while wearing his police uniform. A courageous hero doing what he can to rid the scum of the area.

A dark vision of the near future, the film's low budget works in its favour: it feels real, props look suitably well-worn and there are no unbelievable settings or overblown special effects. The world the film is set in, with industrial decay, vast empty motorways and gangs of low-life bikers terrorising the remaining decent people left, is a deeply disturbing proposition. Mel Gibson, who looks remarkably young (he was 22) plays the title role - police officer Max Rockatansky of the Main Force Patrol, a specialised unit whose task is to rid the roads of the biker gangs who have brought anarchy to the cultural wasteland that they roam. Gibson's character has a wife and young son. They, like his colleague and friend, MFP Officer Jim Goose, are eventually hunted down and brutally murdered by the psychotic gang leader Toecutter, who holds Max responsible for the death of a gang member. The film moves towards its inevitable conclusion - Max is without all that was important in his life, so takes to the road once more in vigilante mode. This is a very unsettling film, devoid of Hollywood sensationalism. Two sequels followed, but the original movie, for me, has the greatest impact: a stark and gritty nightmare in a barbaric world that seems all too close to home.",996192000,3,1345,4.8268398268398265

679764,5,6303471501,"Before I wrote a review for this film I had to get my hands on a version with the original Aussie dialogue to see if it truly mattered.  Well the answer is, yes it does.  Other reviewers are correct when saying the dubbed version (in American English) makes the actors come off campy and it hurts the film a great deal.  And yes, dialogue is even changed slightly, some more than others, like when the one kid and his girlfriend leave town in his hotrod with the biker gang hot on their trail.  In the American version he says ""Don't worry"" to his girlfriend, but in the Aussie version he says ""No worries"".  I don't really think a dubbed English version was necessary.  I could understand what they were saying even with the Australian accents.  I mean imagine network TV dubbing Crocodile Hunter every week with an American accent...BAD IDEA!  Now that the DVD is out of print (because ORION Pictures is out of business) let's hope Warner Brothers obtains the rights to this masterpiece, digitally remasters it (Dolby Digital 5.1 or better) and gives us the Aussie Soundtrack.  Japan released this film on DVD with both Audio tracks (But in Region Code 2 only), so it's about time we got the same thing.  In fact, Warner should re-release all three films in a nice box set and make them all special editions.  The latest VHS version of The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2) included a retrospective documentary that was never included on the DVD.  To me, this is a great film that deserves the S.E. treatment.  It's hard to believe it was only Mel Gibson's 3rd film (After Summer City & Tim).  This movie is set during the decline of civilization and Mad Max 2 is set shortly after that when civilization is all but destroyed and scattered.  Mad Max sets the standard for the sequals and truly gives us a man gone mad by the loss of loved ones at the hands of not just the bikers, but the decay of life as we know it.  I love the trilogy...rare that each one is uniquely special in it's own right, yet still propells the character forward.

Even when arrested the law is virtually powerless to contain the thugs and they are generally released without charge.  Super-cop Max keeps his cool, even when his best friend is murdered, but when they see off his wife and child Max decides enough is enough, heads out in his super-charged V8 Interceptor (one of the coolest cars in cinema history), and embarks on a zero-tolerance one man campaign to wipe out the mad criminals.  It's this finale that is the films main asset - Max is mesmerising as he relentlessly mows down all the bikers without giving them any chance of redemption.  But the entire film is a real treat, with a weird atmosphere and some truly bizarre scenes, most of which involve the crazy bad guys, especially hilarious main baddie Toecutter.  Unfortunately though this terrible American print which I recently had the misfortune of seeing - or more appropriately, hearing - ruins the film.  The dubbing is truly awful, turning the whole cast into ham actors, altering parts of the script and even in occasional instances, bizarrely, omitting some of the sound effects.

In fact, _Mad Max_ is so overshadowed by the  second film in the series that it is sometimes difficult to see it as more  than a prequel.
This film does, however, stand by itself.  The villains  are actually far more sinister and psychotic than those in _The Road  Warrior_, and the disintegration of society is more appalling.  Here, Max  is still striving to uphold law and order but is pushed into vigilantism as  a part of the same inexorable decay.

But surprisingly  enough, I found myself drawn in, mostly because the dubbed dialogue is the  same as the original script, with maybe some Australian terminology removed  in a few spots, plus changes and additions of new dialogue when the face or  mouth of characters are not in the camera shot. So mouth flap is well  accounted for, but the dub occasionally stands out like a sore thumb. An  example is when Jim Goose(Steve Bisley) is in the cafe at the start,  speaking with his mouth full.  About 98% of the dialogue is still there,  which leads me to ask, ""Why did they dub it?"". And more  importantly, ""Why have they not released a DVD version with the  original actors voices, given the success of one particular actor?"".  In any event, the movie, dubbed or otherwise, is still a top actioner. I  give a full five stars to the original version.",957830400,9,1500,4.571428571428571
679945,4,6303471501,"Mad Max was Mel Gibson's breakthough film back in 1979. This low budget film really packs a whallop and set new standards in filming breathtaking car chases. It's essentially a pulp comic book brought to life. A raw and exciting film that set the stage for two powerful sequels.
The police,  sporting black leather uniforms and driving colorful high speed cruisers  that are stationed at the Halls of Justice and are constantly under siege.  The bad guys are a malicious motorcycle gang led by a crazed and  psychopathic goon named Toecutter.  After one of Toecutter's cronies is  killed by Max, Toecutter is looking for some serious payback, but he's  messing with the wrong cop...you don't wanna get Max mad.
The production  design coveys a world that's gone to hell and captures the grim atmosphere  perfectly. Brian May's (not the guitarist from Queen) exciting music score  gives the film a larger than life quality. Director George Miller makes the  most of his small budget. The chase sequences and editing is terrific.
This DVD edition is taken from the original video release.",957139200,3,1085,4.972222222222222
679946,5,6303471501,I own the original Mad Max the way it was released in Australia and i have to say that it is a brilliant movie (although not as good as its sequel). I have never had the oppertunity to see the U.S version but would love to own  it one day...The exellent chase scenes and crashes are now part of Aussie  film history.

The dubbed American version has however grown on many of us and is  certainly an excellent action/horror/western/biker movie.  This version  will probably always be available but if you ever have a chance to see the  original or even own it, you are in for a true delight.  The Aussie  dialogue is not as difficult as ""A Clockwork Orange"" but can be  hard to understand at times but you get what they are saying.  Also, there  are several key sequences that were edited that adds to the tension (hence  forth the horror genre).  Although, some would disagree, a director's cut  is certainly deserved to this cult classic, one that restores the the  original sounds and lost(?) edited scenes.  MAD MAX is definitely a high  energy movie that every guy should own.

679948,5,6303471501,"For 1978/79, Miller's debut feature is tightly directed and highly engaging thanks almost to the constraints that had to be imposed because of the films amateuresque style. Gibson breaks out of his screen starting gate  like a racehorse, the villain gang is well (and humourously) put together  and the plot is as souped-up and humming with power as practically all the  vehicles shown therein (remember that post-apocalyptic sci-fi thrillers  only became well and truly cliched after the third installment of this  series). Still, the real stars of the show in this picture are the cars  themselves. Those Interceptors painted yellow and marked 'Pursuit' are the  best thing to happen to a Datsun since the invention of the 454hp engine  and scoop. Miller directs the road sequences with zest and conviction - so  much so that the frenzy of the death highway comes out to stab the viewer  in the eyeballs at times. There are a few funny bits with deaths etc. Most  are well executed [except for the Edwin Nealesque (he's the guy who gets  smushed under the wheels of that truck at the end of 'The Texas Chainsaw  Massacre') demise of the ludicrously camp biker leader, 'The Toecutter']  but watch out for the sequence where Max runs the bikers off the bridge  right after his wife and kid get splattered. Look for the guy in the red  helmet and brown jacket (I think he's also wearing a white aviation scarf)  who falls on the road (most of the bikers being catapulted over the  railings). Found him? Okay, good. Now wait until you see the front wheel of  the bike to the left of him smash him in the head and jerk his neck  forward. That actor must have died! No way could anyone have lived through  that without serious hospitalisation. Hmmm.... was George Miller trying to  get too opportunistic with that? Anyway - it's a damned fine film given its  unripe origins so go see it whether you're familiar with the trilogy or  not. Scholastic work for sure.",951523200,,1958,4.707964601769912

679951,4,6303471501,"When this movie came out, it became the biggest Australian movie ever. It won awards all over the world, and was given an ""X"" rating for violence in France. Its American releasing company, American International,  was concerned that American audiences would not understand the Australian  accents and slang, so they dubbed it with English voices. Then the company  folded and in the fallout, the movie wound up being released only as the  bottom half of a double bill on 42nd st. in New York City. This dubbed  version is what most Americans are familiar with and what is contained on  this video.
The story involves a highway cop in a world ""a few years  from now..."" where the roads have become dangerously violent. He  worries that he is beginning to like the ""rat circus"" that the  highways have become and goes on a vacation with his wife and baby. When  his baby is killed and his wife turned into a vegetable by a biker attack,  he puts his leathers back on and gets even, becomming...Mad Max.
On a  symbolic level, this movie can be seen as saying today's society is  collapsing into a new dark age, much like the Roman Empire. The cops have  become as violent as the outlaws: one shot of a cop shooting a road sign  during a chase can be seen as symbolizing how the enforcers of the law are  destroying the law; The chief lives at the top of a spiral stair, like a  tower, much like ancient Emperors who were said to likve in tall towers,  cut off from the chaos below. The collapse is accellerated (pun  intentional) by man's relationship to machines, that man is becoming as  unfeeling as machines. The cops shout to be heard over their engines; the  bikers all wear helmets and gear that makes them look a part of their  bikes; one cop, after an injury, speaks with a throat mike (the only voice  not dubbed); even the slang: ""is she salvageable?"" ""stick to  me like a tire on a licorice road,"" refers to automobiles.  Interestingly, the black leather outfits of the cops, on character's ripped  t-shirt, and various short haircuts and bleached hair represent one of the  first examples of punk style used in a movie.
The techniques for showing  the chase and scenes were nigh revolutionary. Cameras were bolted to the  fenders of the cars giving a ""wheel's eye view"" of the action.  Quick cuts and close-ups are used a lot giving a hightened feeling of  agitation and simultaneity. When a chase scene stops, you feel like you've  been in it. Mush of the rest of the movie effectively uses techniques form  other genres, such as horror, biker, cop, and western. Most of the most  horrible violence is not actually seen, but rather implied by quick cuts,  close-ups, and music. In a few key scenes horror movie techniques are  skillfully used to heighten the mood of certain sequences, especially  during Max's vacation on Aunt May's farm. The entrance of the Nightriders  into the small town echoes ""The Wild Bunch,"" ""The Wild  Ones,"" and ""These Are The Damned.""
I have seen this film  in the theater, on video, on TV, and an Australian-language widescreen  video. Of course the theater is the best place to see it. Commercial TV  edits a piece or two here and there. The video that I saw had the box  illustrated on Amazon. I got it second hand, but there were some quality  problems with it that I can't be sure were not from the producer of the  video (does anyone else have bad experiences with ""Goodtimes""  videos?). The Australian version said it had some footage not in the  American version, but I couldn't find it. I did notice several things,  however: There was a difference in some of the lines. The American version  had cut some Australian slang out; The sound quality was better in the  American version. The lines could be heard better; There were some  additional sound effects in the American version that made the chase scenes  more exciting; Though the bit parts in the American version were  nortoriouly badly played, the main characters were (in my opinion) better  played. The line readings were more interesting, having more character (or  maybe I'm just used to them and was thrown when I tried to say the American  lines along with the Australian actors).
Footnote: In my high school  Shakespeare class, I wrote a prequel to ""Mad Max"" using  ""Richard III"" as the plot. The Nightrider was Richard.",948153600,5,4334,4.664900662251656

680021,5,6303471501,"This DVD is like watching a brand new version of the film with crisp imagery in letterbox format. For those who haven't seen this movie, it's the original story of Max and how he eventually becomes the ""Road Warrior"" as portrayed in the sequel. The film was done on a lower budget than its successor, but contains great action with some terrific stunts. The main attraction of the movie is his work as a pursuit officer on the highways where outlaws are running havoc over an understrength police force. Max and his peers are almost as rough as the outlaws, creating a gray area between justice and crime. The story centers around Max's aggressive pursuit of an escapee named the Knightrider, resulting in the outlaw's death in a violent car crash. The Knightrider's motorcycle gang then come looking for Max in retaliation, and Max's family suffer the consequences. Max then transitions from police officer to vigilante, going after the bike gang on his own terms.
The movie is high-energy with souped-up Australian Fords and Kawasaki motorcycles screaming across barren landscapes in lethal chases. Max and his car, an evil-looking black supercharged coupe, wreak destruction on the outlaw bikers near the end and it's pure adrenaline by this point. The film may not be as polished or as wild as the ""Road Warrior,"" but it has cult appeal with the same flavor.
This edition of Mad Max features the original voice tracks of the Australian actors that was never before available in the U.S. This surprisingly quite changes the atmosphere of the movie, making the characters more realistic in a sense, and far less animated when compared to the American dubbed version that feels more like an imported martial arts flick. I personally prefer this version.

Although the present era is less friendly towards this move, just look at how a crock of dung like 'The  Blair Witch Project' managed to make it to the cinema. This first  installment in the Max trilogy finds a very young Gibson beginning with  perfunctory zest, but soon becoming beset with rage at the loss of his  friends and family. While the acting is above-board all right, the real  stars of the show are the automotives themselves. With the Pursuit  Interceptors running as thinly-veiled Datsun heaps, who could have thought  that so much hps could have been squeezed out of every car in this picture?  Extra kudos go to Toecutter's gang. If you look very carefully at the bit  where Max, fresh out of the hospital where's he learnt that his wife is in  critical and his son dead, charges the bikers on the overcross bridge, you  will see that the biker with the red helmet gets his neck broken by the  distended front wheel of his or a comrade's cycle! Ouch. I wonder if he  died in real life. There's so much in here that is amateur pulling through  as professional-looking, who knows how Miller was able to direct it. At any  rate, the choreographer must have been ripping hairs. The movie itself is  just the right length and the ending is bleak and suggestive for a sequel.

He doesn't live for anyone but that of revenge, and afterwards searching for a purpose. You can see in later Mel Gibson movies he tries to amend this point where the man fights for his country in both Braveheart, and in The Patriot.

Come my early 20's when I saw this movie on a movie channel for the first time in nearly a decade and watched it 3 more times to be safe, I was decidedly blown away by this movie and I also developed a new found appreciation for all that made this movie one truly great and epic winner on a great many levels to be held.

This movie was actually Mel Gibson's second Australian movie from the 70's, that he appeared 2 years after he appeared in Summer City with the same co-star of Steve Biseley.  As great a a movie as that was and as competent an actor as Mel proved himself to be then to say nothing of the clear and present dynamic and believable chemistry that Mel showed between himself and Steve Biseley, Mel and Steve getting a second go of it was a wonderful idea for sure.

Even as this movie wasn't made on a major budget, the action sequences and stunts still managed to prove remarkably well done, pretty unique, and no slouch in considerably realistic looking all the same.  As of late, I will always see this movie as playing no small role in inspiring countless action flicks to soon follow.

Some Facts About The Film:

This movie was: Directed by George Miller, Produced by Byron Kennedy, the story was also by Miller and Kennedy, and the Screenplay was by George Kennedy along with James McCausland. Musical Score was by Queen's Brian May.  Cinematography by David Eggby.  Production company was Kennedy Miller Productions Crossroads Mad Max Films.  Distributed by Roadshow Film Distributors.

Much of the characters are quite interesting as well.  Max Rockatansky aka Mad Max was a highway patrol cop, loving husband, loving father and loyal friend until his whole world is shattered for him when The Toecutter and his men murder his partner Jim ""The Goose' Goose, his lovely wife Jessie, and his baby daughter, Sprog.

Jim Goose aka The Goose was Max's wild, high-strung and fun-loving highway patrol partner and good friend.

Jessie Rockatansky: Max's pretty and loving wife of whom takes care of the house and their baby daughter while Max is at work.

Johnny the Boy: The Toecutter's youngest and most inept/stupid of biker gang members.

Bubba Zannetti: The Toecutter's bleach blonde, silver helmet wearing, second in command.

Crawford Montazano aka The Nightrider: Another member of The Toecutters gang that doesn't make it far from the cops when the highway patrolman all cause him and his beautiful girlfriend to crash and burn then die.

The Toecutter: A ruthless, sadistic, charismatic, and power mad biker gang leader of whom takes everyone important to Max from him so he becomes Max's number one nemesis.

Besides great action and mayhem, this movie also presents some really beautiful cinematography showcasing things like lovely wooded land and a beautiful beach and it's community.

There's not much else that I can think to go on about to do this movie any more justice as it speaks in volumes for itself upon viewing it.

In the end, If you have a facination with Australia as I do, love any of Mel Gibson's movies, love great action at any budget, enjoy a movie with interesting heroes and villains, love an epic story of revenge, a gripping script, and if you love Western cliche's made new again, then this movie is definitely for you.
