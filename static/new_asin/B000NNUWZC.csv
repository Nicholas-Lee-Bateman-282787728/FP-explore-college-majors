2772538,5,B000NNUWZC,"For those wondering, I can confirm that Hellfighters, War Wagon, and Rooster Cogburn are all presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  That makes this collection a nice improvement over the previous non-anamorphic standalone versions of those DVDs.  The other features (Reap the Wild Wind and The Spoilers) are in full-frame (1.33:1) format, which I believe was their original theatrical format.

The five films come on three disks:
1.  Reap the Wild Wind
2.  The Spoilers and The War Wagon (both on side A)
3.  Hellfighters (side A) and Rooster Cogburn (side B)

The only extras are trailers (except for Hellfighters) and some John Wayne trivia on the inside of the packaging.",1184025600,110,679,5.118181818181818

2772647,5,B000NNUWZC,"My only complaint on this is: although it is supposted to hav 5 films in it - IT ONLY CONTAINED 4. Reap the Wikd Wind - which is well worth the purchase, Rooster Cogburn, another goody, The Spoilers, and Hellfighters. The War Wagib was not on any of the discs, I was a bit disappointed as I had never seen the particular film.; enough said about that. As I said before Reap the Wild Wind is really an excellent movie, it has action, adventure, romance, what more can you ask for. Raymond Massey was really good in this, he always made a good villiam, remember Arsenic and Old Lace, but he outdid himself in this film.l ,",1398729600,3,620,4.3076923076923075

Keep in mind they are DVD's and thus standard definition, but still very watchable.  The War Wagon, The Hellfighters and Rooster Cogburn are also anamorphic and fill widescreen TV's as opposed to the old versions which were letterboxed. Reap the Wild Wind and The Spoilers were made in the '40's and are fullscreen as they should be.

The older 30's and 40's films are slightly grainy black-n-white, but its just like watching from the tube when I was a younger man.

2772667,5,B000NNUWZC,"I bought this for my husband because he loves ""Hellfighters"".  I looked at the CD for the film by itself, but all the reviews said that this collection was better for the remastered pictures and widescreen display.  This was about the same price, but had other films in it, so I bit.  The husband was thrilled with finally owning ""Hellfighters"" and I could watch it for the groovy late 60s sets alone.",1360022400,,401,4.541666666666667

2772676,5,B000NNUWZC,I mainly purchased this colllection because Hellfighters was included.  this is one of my mom's favorite movies and she never tires of watching it.

Although I'm not a fan of Kurt Douglas, this movie and Reap the Wild Wind showed Wayne as bad man-turn-reformed, or almost-reformed. And, of course, Rooster Cogburn,...what more do I need to say?",1325116800,,303,4.735849056603773

The Hellfighters is one of our favorite movies. My husband and sons can relate to it as they have careers in the gas industry working with dangerously high pressures. The War Wagon and Rooster Cogburn have been on my list to buy forever....

2772696,5,B000NNUWZC,"There's only one thing you need to know to understand how awesome John Wayne is: there are not one, but TWO different movies where he fights a giant octopus.  One of them is in this set--Reap the Wild Wind (the other is Wake of the Red Witch, another great movie, however not included in this set).  And one of my all time favorite movie fist-fights is in The Spoilers, between Wayne & Randolph Scott.  The War Wagon is also a very underrated action western--Wayne & Kirk Douglas in a fun heist movie with plenty of action and fun dialogue.

2772699,5,B000NNUWZC,"The movies in this collection are top notch.  I watched all of them the first three days I had the set.  The video and audio quality is excellent.  The DVD is restored video which I am coming to expect now. I like to watch the unrestored trailers to see how good the movies look after they are restored.  Sometimes technology is wonderful! It wasn't too long ago that we were in danger of losing some of these old films. Of course, the Duke is the Duke, that is why I bought the set.  The set appears to have been done by or for TCM which is first rate, too.  If you love John Wayne, as I do, you'll have to have this set.

2772701,5,B000NNUWZC,These DVD's arrived in a fairly timely manner considering that they were traveling up to Alaska.

The quality of the movies is very good otherwise.,1202688000,4,282,4.549019607843137
2772702,5,B000NNUWZC,"I'm glad I listened to the other reviews that touted the great transfer quality of these movies. Thank you. They didn't exagerate. So far the best of them is The War Wagon. The picture quality is so good you think your'e looking out your window to a beautiful panoramic view of the West. I suppose this also requires a good quality set to view it on, 36"" sony Wega. Can't wait to some day see it on a 60"" Hi-Def system. One can only dream. Anyway, this is a great set to own. And at $20 how can you say no?",1200700800,12,506,4.01980198019802
2772703,5,B000NNUWZC,"What I love about this collection is not just the selection of his movies over the years of his career but also the different characters he gets to play.
Reap The Wild is set in the 1840s Key West and John Wayne plays a sea captain.  And he's not even the main character!
The Spoilers is set in Alaska 1890s during a gold rush.  Along side Marlene Dietrich and Randolph Scott this film really shines bright with great acting.
The War Wagon is a good, old fashion action film with lots of action and Kirk Douglas to boot!
Hellfighters is about firefighters and how they handle the job and their lives, trying to balance the two together.  Lots of action, romance and gritty reality.
Rooster Cogburn, named after the character John Wayne played in True Grit, brings that character back to match him up with Katharine Hepburn to bring justice to the West.
Outside of Rooster Cogburn I have never seen any of this films and it really allowed me to enjoy and come to respect the many skills and sides of John Wayne.  I look forward to buying up more and more of his films in the future.  The inside of the collection's box folds out and has information about John Wayne and the films in the set.",1200441600,19,1190,4.415525114155251
2772704,5,B000NNUWZC,"Not a dud film here. Includes a good share of my favorite Wayne films(even if he didn't get top billing in the two from 1942) All are in color except for ""The Spoilers"", which should have been, to show off Marlene Dietrich's outfits, if for no other reason. No other woman, given the opportunity, came close as the ultimate dancehall queen(I'm sure Wayne would agree). ""Reap the Wild Wind"" and ""Rooster Cogburn"", made 33 years apart, are two of my favorite Wayne movies. Wayne seemed way too old and slow to be playing his character in ""The War Wagon"" This was after his one lung had been removed. But, Kirk Douglas, no spring chicken himself, helped make up for the Duke's relative lethargy. I found it an entertaining film. ""Hellfighters"" brought home the dangers and challenges of putting out oilwell fires, which became very relevant during the first Gulf War. Sure burned up a lot of fuel in that one! The  DVD quality of all was excellent. My only regret is the lack of commentary features, but I can't really quibble for the price.",1189209600,43,1038,4.641304347826087
2772705,5,B000NNUWZC,"Hello Folks,

This is a collection of films that have been out on  DVD...being  a fan of the Duke ..I  just bought it anyway.  I can say I am  glad already because although Universal  doesn't tout this...the print  of ROOSTER COGBURN is a revelation compared to the previous available editions!  The previously available DVD of that fine  film had noticable grain , color  problems,  and annoying  dirt etc.  The transfer/print of Rooster Cogburn  on this  collection is striking  in  its improved look ( a tribute to legendary Cinematographer Harry Stradling Jr who photographed this splendid movie). I haven't  compared  The War Wagon and others yet but I wouldn't  be surprised if they also  were an improvement.  I picked  this up for under $20...and 5 John Wayne  films for $4 each is a no  brainer...
Happy 100th Duke ..long  may you ride!!
Yeeehaaaaa
UPDATE:  I just compared the War Wagon with the previously available edition and like Rooster..its a HUGE upgrade in picture quality...this set gets better and better...snap it up!",1184112000,64,1038,4.947058823529412
