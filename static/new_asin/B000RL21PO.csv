2868721,1,B000RL21PO,"This is one of the episodes from season 2 of ""Masters of Horror."" Years ago a bunch of kids played a prank on a good-natured but mentally-challenged ice cream truck driver, which resulted in his accidental death. Now the kids are grown up, and the driver is back for revenge with his killer ice cream.

All I can say is, stock, stock, stock. I know killer clowns long fell into the campy horror category, but nothing about this show seems inspired or original. The most obvious rip-off would be Stephen King's ""It,"" but name anything with mind-controlled children, childhood friends confronting evil, or spirits back for revenge, and you'll find something much more compelling than this. Some of the effects are decent, such as when a victim dies in a tub, but there are no scares and there's little tension. The acting is about average.

Maybe I'm missing the point. Not all Masters of Horror stories are meant to be scary, and some are deliberately campy (season 1's Deer Woman). But this one just seems to subscribe to the worst of the genre without offering any cleverness. Avoid.",1182038400,16,1084,4.76063829787234
2868730,2,B000RL21PO,"Mildly entertaining but also very bland 95% of the time.  The ice cream man was more comical than scary.  The ice cream man was killed at the end of the movie, yet, he comes back amazingly and looks at the audience and says [we all scream] ""FOR ICE CREAM"" and then the film ends.  Nice way to say ""screw you"" to the audience.  What a joke.",1251676800,,339,4.090909090909091
2868731,3,B000RL21PO,"Directed by Tom Holland (Fright Night, Child's Play), We All Scream for Ice Cream is a more funny than frightening episode from the second season of Showtime's Masters of Horror, but it still manages to entertain regardless.  Lee Tergesen (HBO's Oz) stars as a family man whose old pals start dying off, which leads him to believe that a clown-clad ice cream man (William Forsythe) accidentally killed years before is back from the dead and looking for revenge.  While there's some bad dialogue and occasional crud acting, We All Scream for Ice Cream delivers a good amount of laughs and shocks, and Forsythe is a treat (no pun intended) as Buster the clown.  All in all, We All Scream for Ice Cream isn't anything special, but it isn't as bad as other reviews here may lead you to believe, and it isn't half as bad as some of the other episodes you'll come across in the Masters of Horror series (Chocolate or Valerie on the Stairs anyone?).",1229817600,,942,4.62874251497006
2868732,1,B000RL21PO,"The best part of this movie is the picture on the cover, it makes the film look scary, i mean how can you go wrong with a killer clown?

Easy, you make this film. This movie is not in the slightest way scary and I would find it hard for someone to tell me it's anything but a kids PG rated goosebumps episode.

Masters Of Horror? pffftt... There is nothing scary about a direct knock off of Stephen Kings IT.... the only plot change is that years ago the kids picked on the clown and un-intentionally killed him, now the clowns back for revenge by giving there kids ice creams that when they eat them there parents melt into a puddle of ice cream.

I don't even wanna think about the things that did not make sense, just avoid the movie, it is 55 minutes of boredom and not one single scare.",1228694400,3,791,4.190789473684211

2868734,1,B000RL21PO,"Neither scary nor fun.  What a waste of my time.  This is a pretty darn pitiful entry into the series.  Probably one of the main reasons that Showtime did not pick it up for a third season.  If you rent this, make sure it's cheap.",1195516800,,230,4.044444444444444
2868735,3,B000RL21PO,"We All Scream for Ice Cream is a campy revenge tale bordering around a childhood secret, with an ice cream seller turned ghoulish burning bridges in the midst of the night because of something that went wrong once upon an ago. It all starts to fall into place when a group of the old crew, now a grown man, moves back into the neighborhood of his youth and brings his family back with him, discovering in the process that something else has returned and is bringing revenge with it.
It was funny, to say the least.

One of the flaws in the Masters of Horror series is that they rely on old stories, older storytellers, and on small budgets that would beguile the world of horror if they had to revolve on such strict guidelines. Some of them are intentional laughs, making the mind laugh and play, and some are too gimmicky and don't do the idea justice. We All Scream for Ice Cream could have been a lot better if it wouldn't have taken the gimmick too far, but the end product reminds me of something from the 80s when ""Stephen King adaptation"" all over it. Despite that I still thought that this part of the show was good, with the kids all seemingly hateful in their own ways. Equally as good were some of the campy special effects when revenge is taken; you have people turning into little blobettes because of revenge and the blobettes - they look pretty nasty. They were pretty funny, and the campiness of the movie reflects the turn that the series has taken.
The problem is that the ending was a bit too long, the ""We all scream for ice cream"" mantra was a bit too unbridled for the brain to handle, and some of the motions seem forced and contrived. Of the adult actors only one of them was entertainingly bizarre, and the kids in the middle of the night seemed more like they were missing acting lessons than missing out on sleep.
If only...

If you want campy and maybe a small amount of creepy, then you might enjoy this. I can't say I didn't enjoy it myself at any level but I can say that this was more of a Sci-Fi channel film than a Masters of Horror outing. Perhaps that was the point of it, wanting to laugh a bit and mock the staples that tormented the genre for such a long time. Regardless, I have to say ""steer clear unless you want it campy.""
If only the Titanic would have had such sound advice.",1194048000,3,2320,4.318807339449541
2868736,3,B000RL21PO,"Yes fellow horror fans ""We All Scream For Ice Cream"" is on the cheesy side of horror(although Forsythe is excellent as both good guy/bad guy versions of Buster the clown). The film is just littered with bad dialog oozing from the mouths of the other players, but when you mix it in with the creepy story and the goofy tongue & cheek way that buster kills off his victims you can't help but be reminded of another fun 80's clown flick loaded with cheese in ""Killer Clowns From Outer Space"". Speaking of the 80's, if this film was made back then it would have fit in perfect with the times and something tells me it would be one of those fun cult classic movies from the 80's that horror fans(like myself) would be eagerly waiting on it's dvd release. Could have been much better but I enjoyed it for what it was...fun,creepy & stupid!",1187308800,4,833,4.415584415584416
2868737,3,B000RL21PO,"I didn't think this was too bad of a movie. It was definitely entertaining. It wasn't petrifying but most of the newer Masters of Horror movies aren't really scary.

Personally, I like ""b"" killer-clown horror movies so that's probably why I thought this movie was entertaining. This movie is more of a renter, I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you want to buy the whole collection.",1187222400,,385,4.833333333333333
2868738,2,B000RL21PO,"This actually wasn't all that bad.  It wasn't scary but it did have an interesting story line somewhat similar to Stephen Kings ""IT"".  It may be worth checking out if you aren't expecting too much in the way of horror, and it's only 57 minutes long.",1184371200,,249,4.391304347826087
2868739,4,B000RL21PO,"Ok, to begin with... this is probably the most wholeheartedly fun episode of them all for season 2!  Granted, if you ge this expecting horror and terror, its not there (well... some parts are creepy), but really.. this is just good ole fashioned entertaining.  I mean, come on... William Forsythe plays a semi retarded clown ghost out for revenge!  Thats a selling point right there!

I'm not going to go into the plot very much, but this episode is VERY cheesy - but also VERY entertaining.  I liked it, and I recommended it to anyone who enjoys the MOH series.

Overall, its just a good way to spend 55 mins.  Its hilarious, fun, creepy, and amusing.  Its a good time throughout ... without the calories.",1182124800,4,706,4.592

8201183,5,B000RL21PO,"I was pleasantly surprised that in the previews at the beginning of the film that the film I was currently watching was coming soon to DVD. And the movie is as amazing as the trailer I watched for it in the beginning of the film suggested it would be. The film is about a group of kids who jovially murdered a mentally challenged clown who sold ice cream and years later as adults the crimes of their past come back to haunt them in the form of the ghost of the mentally challenged ice cream man killing them off one by one by turning them into ice cream by feeding ice cream voodoo dolls to their children. Yup, couldn't make this schlock up if I tried. I was mostly surprised to see an actual actor in this film. It stars TV actor Lee Tergesen as Layne, one of dumb murder kids all grown up. Hard to think of him as a family man and not in make up and a wig performing sex acts on white supremacists.",1426291200,,902,4.101694915254237
8201184,3,B000RL21PO,I like William Forsythe but this movie could have used a little work. The sheer weirdness of it saved it from getting 2 stars from me.,1422144000,,134,4.1923076923076925
8201185,3,B000RL21PO,"We All Scream For Ice Cream is a cheesy revenge story that tells the tale of an ice cream clown man named Buster. Buster was a mentally challenged ice cream man who dressed as a clown and made weekly trips through the neighborhood in his Cheery Time Ice Cream Truck to entertain the kids and serve them ice cream. Unfortunately, Buster was loathed by the neighborhood bully, Virgil, who decided to get his friends to play a prank on Buster one day, which lead to the accidental death of Buster.

A generation later, the young boys are now grown men with families but the crime of their past may be strolling close for their children. Buster and his ice cream truck have returned in the form of a vengeful spirit to get vengeance on those responsible for his death. Now in most horror clown movies, clowns have a dangerous weapon or some cool supernatural powers to attack their victims. Buster's weapon? Ice cream. Ridiculous right? I said the same thing. Every frozen treat will bring it's own taste of death.

Now I'm a big fan of clown horror movies. I love evil clowns, I love clown horror movies but this may have to be an exception. This movie is very 80s cheesy like and almost seems like a sister film to the 1980s Killer Klowns From Outer Space film. Heck, when I first saw the cover for this, I thought it was made in the 80s or 90s. The producers of this movie try to mix horror and comedy at some points but unfortunately they don't do too well at it. The clown is not even scary! Horror movie clowns are supposed to be scary! He may pass off as being somewhat of a creep but even those who fear clowns would probably laugh in his face. Overall this is an okay movie but nothing special. I'd pass on it unless you're really crazy about clown movies",1392336000,,1760,4.379204892966361
8201186,4,B000RL21PO,"This movie is unrealized. William Forsythe is an incredible actor, and brought this character to life with ease. The one and only thing wrong with this movie is the special effects (CGI).. period. If you're an 80's horror fan like myself and grew up with this specific genre, then you will ""get"" this movie. William Forsythe carried this movie on his back and made up for the horrible special effects. If make-up masters like Tom Savini or Greg Nicotero handeled the gore and magic that they brought us for decades, then this movie I believe, would bring sequels to the table. Cudos to you Mr. Forsythe! 80'S Horror fans..give it a shot!",1297555200,3,637,4.696428571428571
8201187,3,B000RL21PO,"Residents of a small town are dropping like flies and the deaths are linked to the return of a former Ice Cream Vendor, a clown named Buster (William Forsythe). The problem is that Buster is dead and he has returned to seek vengeance on those who, years prior, played a cruel and fatal prank on him.

Judging by the reviews, this episode from season 2 of ""Masters of Horror"" doesn't have many fans and although this is clearly not the best of the bunch, it was able to hold my attention and entertain me up until the lame climax.  Now I have to frankly state this is due largely because I read these negative reviews beforehand, therefore my expectations were firmly set low and what I got was better than what was expected. Gore hounds and hard-core fans of the series will most definitely be disappointed since this episode has no gore (unless the sight of melting ice cream makes you nauseous), no sex, no nudity and the film actually takes itself seriously (I was surprised the actors were able to keep a straight face while reciting their lines) and judging by the subject matter, that is a big no-no. Some of the quirkier past episodes of the series clearly played it for laughs and threw in some explicit gore for good measure unlike this installment. With that said, this film does have some creepy scenes and one heck of a villain. We should remember that horror doesn't necessarily mean buckets of blood and guts. If done well, a film can be scary without the gore. Ever since I saw ""Poltergeist"" as a child, I have been untrusting of clowns and this ghostly freak was a sight to behold and well played out by Forsythe. There are also some genuinely creepy scenes depicting Busters ghostly ice cream truck surrounded by frozen mist and ghostly whispers slowly traveling down the dark neighborhood streets and equally eerie are the scenes of hypnotized children clutching their change & waiting for Buster and his ice cream truck during the midnight hour. However I am not so sure the good out weighs the bad and the film makers had a lot of opportunities here to make an excellent ghost story featuring a character many children and adults are fearful of but somehow they were unable to pull it off successfully. This is a shame since the ghostly villian had so much potential. It's not a complete loss since this is one of the very few episodes of the MOH series you can watch with some of your older teens with the only questionable scene being the rather enjoyable demise of the town bully in his hot tub.

""We All Scream for Ice Cream"" will not please those looking for a blood soaked thrill ride. If you can get past this and can put up with a silly tale of supernatural vengeance, a creepy killer and (for the most part) a chilling atmosphere, you may find this peculiar installment an entertaining watch.
