8443857,2,B004VR4AT0,"This video is terribly dated and is not an accurate account of the life of Tony Fontane - even though he was  directly involved in the making of it!! If you want to know the real story, there's a terrific bio on Amazon called ""A Bargain With God: The Tony Fontane Story,"" which I suggest you read. It's far more revealing and accurate than this film, which took huge liberties with the facts in order to make a movie. Fontane's life was actually far more interesting and inspiring than this film gives credit for.",1420329600,,513,4.457446808510638
