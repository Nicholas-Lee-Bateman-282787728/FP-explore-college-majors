8446844,3,B004XE0964,"It's beautifully filmed and there are parts that are funny in a surreal way; like the part of the tank coming into a neighborhood, but I really had a hard time trying to figure out what was going on in the film.",1489622400,,211,4.0476190476190474

8446846,5,B004XE0964,"I feel like you'd have to be in denial of your humanity to not appreciate this movie. As a part of the disenfranchised Palestinian diaspora this film gets me--laughed, cried, etc.--but it'd probably also resonate with fans of mid century European film and continental philosophy (sry, went there) and really anybody with open eyes and an open mind.",1466726400,,348,5.017241379310345

8446848,5,B004XE0964,Great absurdist film that captures a humanist narrative of the 1948 war and the consequences on people's daily lives thereafter. Incredible.,1439683200,,140,5.714285714285714
8446849,4,B004XE0964,"Let me state upfront that I have an affinity for Israel the country. There is something about it that appeals to me greatly (and I've had the good fortune of visiting Israel in 2010). It always amazes me when I read thatn about 15-20% of the Israeli population is in fact Arab, a tremendous number. I was browsing the foreign movie section of my local library the other day and stumbled upon this. I knew nothing about the movie as such going in, other than that it deal with the Arab-Israeli perspective within Isreal, and that was good enough for me.

""The Time That Remains"" (2009 release; 109 min.) starts off somewhat confusingly (for me anyway), as we see a driver pick up someone at modern-day Tel Aviv's airport, and subsequently getting lost, without any explanation given what we just watched. That is the pre-opening credits scene. After that we shift to 1948, where we see the Israeli Defense Army occupy/liberate (depending on your perspective) the town of Nazareth (yes, that Narareth), causing lots of inhabitants to flee. The movie shifts back and forth between different stories that are all somehow interwoven, and that works fine. Not so good in my opinion is that the film shifts tones too often, hesitating between sometimes comedy, other times drama, and at other times striking an outright absurdist tone. But I must also admit that the film carried my attention from start to finish.

In all, I quite like this movie. AFter watching the movie, I read on the box of the DVD that the movie is semibiographical, in that it is based in part on director's Elia Suleiman's own family's experiences. If you are in the mood for a good quality foreign movie, I encourage you to check this out.",1343865600,3,1708,4.728187919463087
8446850,3,B004XE0964,"The historical potrayal of the 1948 War is well-done and realistic for the most part. Subsequently the film feels too ""artsy/poetic""--over-endowed with metaphors, symbols and absurdist episodes. This would have been a much better film without the surreal quality.",1338854400,2,263,5.769230769230769
8446851,5,B004XE0964,This film ranks in the top 10 films I've ever seen. I saw it at the Arab Film Festival in Minneapolis Minnesota. My wife and I were riveted. Beautifully filmed. Intense irony. Timeless themes. What else could you ask for. This film is a masterpiece. I will watch it again and again. L.,1321574400,3,285,4.39622641509434
8446852,5,B004XE0964,"Elia Suleiman's film The Time That Remains is a masterly drawing from his father's memoirs,sketching out in fragmented vignettes of brilliantly composed tableaux and dead-pan episodes of humour the pain of Palestinians(here""Arab-Israeli's"")living under occupation in Nazareth, from 1948 to the present. The spirit of Tati and Keaton reign supreme. This is not a blow-by-blow account but a microcosm of noises-off,of mini-theatrical happenings, especially in the personal slant on his family. Scenes have been shot where events took place.

We rarely think about ordinary life under occupation or the culture shock of suddenly finding yourself living in an Israeli-conquered town for Palestinian Arabs. With the precision and verve of silent comedy,Suleiman rearranges the chaos of reality into aesthetic order,patterns of inter-related harmonies, through translation into cinematic moments,language. The film is structured into 4 parts after a prologue of Suleiman's visitation of his widowed mother, the drive from airport to Nazareth,an existential void,following the fall-out of 1948,hence'getting lost'.

1948 is the Big Bang for the Palestinian people. The Mayor of Nazareth signs an unconditional surrender of Nazareth to the Israeli troops. Palestinian soldiers flee throwing off their keffiyehs. This historic starting point allows Suleiman to voyage around his father,Fuad's(Saleh Bakri) life. One very powerful scene when after capture,he is blind-folded and made to kneel in an olive grove full of other detainees. We get rustling leaves,crickets,birdsong, breezes,the beauty of Palestine's landscape,but a gun to his head and a count to ten. The title is a warning.

Many of his family have departed for Amman. In the 1970s Fuad has high blood pressure,a bad chest,Elia at school, being chastised for calling the Americans `imperialists'.A mad neighbour continually douses himself with petrol to protest the hard conditions of life to be rescued by Fuad. Israeli children sing colonialist songs. Israeli patrols question Fuad's night-fishing,repeatedly,until they arrest him at home for `smuggling arms'.There are tender family memories,a communicating neighbourhood,full of anecdotes,collections of stories,images of feelings.

In the 80s after open-heart surgery Fuad is off hunting and playing back-gammon. Refuge is piling up through strikes,auntie Olga's sight is deteriorating to comic effect. Prostitutes dress as Israeli soldiers to pullclients. Elia sits around with his mates in cafes when not being threatened with deportation. Protests by Palestinians vs. Israel's annexation of land in Nazareth are met by being shot at by Israeli soldiers. Soldiers tug trolleys in hospital from medics to get wounded people who they suspect. And to the present day,Suleiman is the silent

narrator,the insider-outsider,the `present absentee',sitting around cafes with his old mates. His father is dead. His mum is diabetic and secretly eats ice-cream at night,told off by her home nurse. Elia watches fighting in the streets below between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians. A big tank's turret follows a neighbour's movements as he empties his rubbish. A peaceful disco is met by loudspeaker curfews. The insanity of existence is impeccably framed. The most moving scene is when he tends his hospitalized mother. Using humour to hint at the buried stories

that the powerful control with their narrative, to keep that history untold:the displaced,the refugees, the annexations,the settlements. This is better than his last film'Divine Intervention',because it uses the anguish of oppressed people everywhere using ghetto humour,to dislodge the mask of injustice,to make the viewer feel with all senses the powerful tool that cinema is to forge new identities,through pleasure and coherence. We are not just telling history,but from the stones up we are reliving the tragedy of a people. Cinema of eloquent humanity. This
DVD is done by New Wave films in an English subtitled version.",1312848000,11,3993,5.736486486486487
