6760797,5,B00OU0IRUG,"While it did get a bit confusing at times, the movie clearly portrayed the pressure points that led to the disaster- the multinational corporations need for profits above all and the local communities need to feed their families. The movie clearly showed how the community's poverty worked for Union Carbide and how easy it was to exploit. It is unfathomable that they did little more then walk away from the devastation they caused. For their bottom line, the people were (are) disposable. Union Carbide was never held accountable and never will be. It's an important lessen to learn for without checks and balances, if these corporations are left to their own devises, when it comes to profits we all are disposable.  Whether it be the air we breath, the food we eat or the water we drink it is only when a disaster represent a cost to them that they can not incur or bear they will use their best efforts and all available means to avoid them. In other words, they do a very poor job at self regulating.",1424995200,2,1006,4.588888888888889
6760798,4,B00OU0IRUG,"This is really a story that needs to be told and this movie does just that.  I will prepare you for the fact that this movie is very slow and occasionally dry, only picking up close to the end. The actors do a wonderful job of portraying what is one of the worst industrial disasters of all time that only few have heard of.
I gave this 4 stars and not 5 because it was occasionally hard to focus, but 4 stars and not 3 or less because of how important I think it is that people watch this and of how great the story is told in all.",1424649600,,532,3.8807339449541285

6760800,5,B00OU0IRUG,"What a Movie, soo many things they could have done to prevent it but only Indians died so they didn't care.  The biggest natural disaster ever and I never heard of it till looking at Kal Penn's Wiki Page a year and a half ago!  MUST WATCH!",1423267200,5,239,4.0638297872340425
6760801,5,B00OU0IRUG,"I strongly believe that this is one of the most important films that was released in 2014 - and there were a fair share, including SELMA and CITIZEN FOUR.

The film is ambitious in scope for a first-time feature director, and it's hard not to tear up during the devastating climax.

I'm someone who was born after the BHOPAL disaster happened, and I'm just glad that this movie was made so I could become aware of this tragedy and realize that the same mistakes are being made by corporations and governments today more than 30 years later.",1423180800,2,540,4.556701030927835
6760802,5,B00OU0IRUG,"This film has done a great job of telling the true story of what happened 30 years ago when an American company went and set up shop in Bhopal, India on the cheap and the devastating effects that followed due to the cost cutting and the lack of care and safety. Over 10,000 people died that night and most people in America don't even know about the Bhopal disaster. The worst industrial disaster of our time. No compensation has ever really been paid out to the victims of Bhopal by Union Carbide the gas company involved. Please watch this film. Tell your friends and let's try and get some justice for the victims of Bhopal.",1423180800,6,627,4.460869565217391
6760803,3,B00OU0IRUG,"The 1984 Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal, Madhya Pradhesh, India, is considered the worst industrial disaster in world history. Yet, because it happened in ""some"" city in India, the world doesn't know about it compared to the Chernobyl disaster that also happened near ""some"" city (Pripyat), but the whole world remembers. Why? Europe, thats why. The Union Carbide disaster is proof how lives in developing countries simply matter less than lives in the first world do. Everything that followed the disaster is even more appalling - Union Carbide putting the blame on its Indian branch; these people saying they weren't briefed about safety or trained properly by the higher ups, and once Union Carbide conveniently sold off its subsidaries and got taken over by Dow Chemical, this company not assuming any reponsiblity, and above all, the Indian government of all people refusing to clean up the mess when in fact people CONTINUE TO DIE in Bhopal on a daily basis due to the chemicals having contaminated the ground water.

I am glad this film was made, more people must be made aware of what happened in Bhopal in 1984. 3,787 people dead and at least 40,000 disabled that followed in the years after that, and with human exposures to the poisonous gas numbering in the six figures. My only gripe with this film is that it is rather short and a bit too light hearted, given its subject. Anderson's character being portrayed as a guy with good intentions is also questionable, given how he lay low and the US government refused to extradite him to India until his death in Florida this year. Also, I wish this movie was made available in more regions and retailers. Amazon uk for example doesnt even have it available although it is listed. Nevertheless, for a first attempt at bringing this industrial disaster that cost untold amounts of lives to the big screen for future generations to remember, definitely worth watching.

A 3, out of 5.",1419120000,11,1943,4.849397590361446

6760805,4,B00OU0IRUG,"Worth seeing for both Martin Sheen's performance and to remind oneself that, thirty-one years later as I write this 2015, the victims of the 1984 Bhopal, India, tragedy still await justice, the 2014 film BHOPAL: A PRAYER FOR RAIN tells the personal stories of a handful of the 10,000 people who would lose their lives in the Union Carbide chemical plant disaster.  Most interesting is Sheen's take on Union Carbide chief executive Warren Anderson, whom he portrays as the kind of guy for whom you'd like to work.  How accurate that is, I don't know, but it seems to underscore the emphasis on image over substance that took greater root in those days of the Reagan years.  It costs less to appear good than it does to do good, and the families of Bhopal paid the difference.",1437091200,2,774,4.635036496350365

6760807,5,B00OU0IRUG,Bhopal is a heartbreaking movie which `portrays a true story based in the  world's worst industrial disaster that ocurred in India in 1984. The photography is amazing and the director did a very good job exposing this castastrophe that most people don't know ocurred. I highly recommend this movie.,1429747200,,298,5.081632653061225

6760811,5,B00OU0IRUG,"If you have always wondered what really happened in Bhopal, besides memories of the news headlines of the past, this is a ""must-see"" for anyone who is the least bit interested in humanity and the human condition. It is difficult even now to imagine the magnitude of the death and suffering and was equally difficult to understand back in the 1980s when it was ""newsworthy"" and destined to be old news before the dead were even buried. Although not entertaining in the traditional sense, this movie was compelling and clearly illustrates how an industry's cultural awareness and accountability are practically non-existent. Sure, there is an ""agenda"" woven carefully into the fiber of this production, but in this case, it doesn't seem to annoy me as much as usual. This movie is long overdue. People forget too quickly.",1428451200,,819,4.985401459854015
