It turns out that either this version isn't remastered, or the copy I originally had was the best quality there was. Nevertheless, it's a classic film and still totally watchable.",1459555200,,279,4.6

7952399,3,B00005RJ12,"The film starts with a comic scene in a bookstore. Two men offer $1,000 for a map in the book ""Dark Safari"". A woman offers $2,500 for the same map. Stanley Livington remembers that detail very well (too good to be true?). [The story and its subject are certainly dated.] Clyde Beatty plays himself. Shemp Howard plays another near-sighted character (like his role in a ""Blondie"" movie). There are plenty of gags to amuse the viewers. Buzz overhears Diana talking about the real purpose of the expedition - its not for a giant orangutan. Frank Buck plays himself. There are comic situations, most are still funny. There is a very comic scene with a lion skin and a real lion. Clyde Beatty does his lion taming act.

After this the boys find diamonds just laying on the ground. They follow the trail to where it leads. The natives have them over for dinner. A secret friend unties them. There is more intrigue and comic chases. More fun results from a failure to communicate. The natives are appalled by a giant gorilla, and flee. Buzz takes off down the river on a raft. What will happen to poor Stanley now?

Back in Manhattan Stanley is living large in a big building with his name on it. Then we see his partner and the cause of his wealth. [Is there a moral here?] This film is not as funny as earlier films.",1184544000,,1312,4.4625

After encounters with lion tamers, giant apes and a wild river, Buzz returns to America. Stanley finds diamonds and buys the store they once worked for, hiring Buzz as its elevator operator.

  ROUTINES & HILARIOUS MOMENTS:

  Lou fears gorilla while eating

  Glasses of water for tent fire

  Bud in lion skin

  Lou's thought dead.

  Trivia (from imdb.com): There is a scene where Bud Abbott & Lou Costello are talking in their tent and Joe Besser dashes into the tent, grabs a glass of water and dashes out again. He repeats this several times until Bud Abbott stops him and asks why he's so thirsty. Joe Besser replies that he's not thirsty, it's that his tent is on fire. That was based on an incident in Lou Costello's childhood, when he accidentally set some clothes in his bedroom on fire. His father was in the living room, which was between the kitchen and Lou Costello's bedroom. Lou Costello, not wanting to let his father know that he had set his room on fire, dashed back and forth between the kitchen and his bedroom with glasses of water until his father finally asked what he was doing, whereupon Lou Costello was forced to tell what he had done.",946857600,3,2479,5.288
