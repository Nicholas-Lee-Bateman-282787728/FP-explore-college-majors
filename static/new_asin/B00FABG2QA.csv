5973032,5,B00FABG2QA,"Heggie's new opera, ""Moby Dick"" has proven to be an instant American operatic classic.  The production, filmed live from the San Francisco Opera features state-of-the-art technology (lighting, projections, etc.) to seamlessly move the opera's scenes deftly and, not infrequently, adding a little ""awe"" power for the audience.  But the show is not about effects, but rather about epic storytelling through music and the effects and stage designs are simply the platform for an overwhelming operatic treatment of one of our great, classic tales.

Heggie's score has moments that recall Britten (strongly) as well as other composers, yet, having heard most of his music to this point, stands on its own with a stamp of recognizable individuality.  There were snippets and melodies of things that I ""thought"" I knew, but were (much like Humperdinck with his Hansel und Gretel) wholly original - yet undeniably familiar.  That's a nice gift.

The individual performances are, to a one, exemplary and the commitment each singer gives to his or her role is commendable and clear.  Jay Hunter Morris stepped into some big shoes (Ben Heppner was the celebrated original Ahab) and does so admirably.  With a more pointed sound and less sweetness of tone than Heppner, Morris presents a different Ahab, but no less formidable and his madness is, at times, appropriately unnerving.

Each of Ahab's crew members are immediately likable, each earning the audiences sympathies, none, so much (for this viewer) as Stephen Costello's Greenhorn.  Costello's attractive if tightly wound vibrato imbues Greenhorn with the innocent melancholy of an orphan loner, and his growing attachment to the ""savage"" Queequeg and the friendship that ensues between the pair of loners is infinitely touching, their duet at the opening of the second act, an emotional and musical highlight.  As Queequeg, baritone Jonathan Lemalu is going to be a tough act to follow for anyone replacing him.  Of Polynesian island physicality, and elaborately tattooed from the face down, Lemalu's ""savage"" is noble, and in many ways, the most thoughtful and honest shipmate.

Talise Trevigne's clear, high flying soprano and impish size make her perfect as Pip the cabin boy (and she gets to fly!)  Morgan Smith's Starbuck is likewise perfect, his great aria that closes Act 1 revealing his torturous moral dilemma of how to save his shipmates from Ahab the Mad.

Patrick Summers, a Heggie favorite, leads the San Francisco forces with assurance, driving the music furiously in its storm scenes while allowing his singers plenty of room for lyrical expansion - which Heggie gives his characters plenty of.

I was happy to learn that after 5 or 6 productions so far, ""Moby Dick"" will be playing at even more companies in the upcoming years - a promising sign.",1383264000,28,2809,5.154185022026431
5973033,5,B00FABG2QA,"Stunning work, so true to the novel.  Melville would be proud.  Lemalu is especially impressive as Queequeg, but the entire cast is superb.  The visual effects are amazing.  Every modern visual technique is used to create the world of a 19th-century whaling vessel.  I am puzzled by one commenter's statement on subtitles -- there IS a subtitles menu.  I put the subtitles on, although English is my native language, because sometimes the music and sound effects can muddle the words.",1439942400,,484,4.9875
5973034,5,B00FABG2QA,"Just like Puccini's or Rossini's work was once ""new"", this opera will become a standard of the operatic repertoire. The production is extremely clever and technologically rich, making difficult scenes develop and evolve in a clear yet artistic way that supported the story without overshadowing the piece.

The score is simply marvelous.  Heggie was capable of delivering fresh melodic lines that made the entire opera fresh, enjoyable and plays with the audience's expectations.  The sensitivity that is delivered is far beyond what I anticipated, and the rich colors and subtleties in the orchestration a truly work of art.
Although I enjoyed Scheer's libretto (outstanding in the way he reduced such massive work of literature to a 3hr piece keeping if truthful to the original story), there were only a few instances where I was surprised by his choice of words in relation to the music.  But overall, a masterpiece!

Vocally, this production also benefited from having a very strong cast.  The nuances and sensitivity of Stephen Costello's Greenhorn, and the wide range of emotions portrayed by Morgan Smith's Starbuck are standouts. The orchestra and chorus also take center stage with their beautiful playing/singing.  Once again, Patrick Summers delivers a wonderful read of the difficult score to perform but one that is easy to enjoy.",1433030400,3,1344,5.252336448598131
5973035,1,B00FABG2QA,"With no subtitles it is very hard to understand the singers. there are several options such as Chapters, Audio, etc. but none of them work.",1429142400,,139,4.6
5973036,4,B00FABG2QA,"I saw the world premier of this opera in Dallas, and was mesmerized by it from beginning to end. The Ahab of that production was one the day's great tenors, Ben Heppner, who was magnificent. This version of Ahab in the same production in San Francisco is FAR inferior as a singer but has some acting chops worth seeing. The rest of the cast was superb, many of whom I saw in Dallas. I think the piece has every chance to be one that stays in the repertory or at least on the inner fringe of it. Well worth exploring. All production values of the DVD are first rate.",1420416000,4,565,4.192660550458716
5973037,5,B00FABG2QA,"As in Melvilles novel, this opera is not as much about the white whale as it is about his hunters: Ahabs obsession, Starbucks pragmatism, Greenhorns and Queequegs friendship, the crew's behavior during the long and seemingly unworthy voyage, and some very deep personal feelings beautifully portrayed by the lyrics and the music.
This recently composed opera, which debuted in 2010, is a perfect example that modern music and lyrics can be appreciated by many opera-goers (and watchers). At some points, the music sounds familiar, although it is a totally new score - one which successfully reminds us of the oceanic setting of the story.  The music and the production overall allow us to understand this whaling related story, which is not part of our present times, without the need to transpose it to modern times
This San Francisco production is excellent in all aspects. The singers are one by one to be commended for great acting and singing -- you can feel their total commitment to their roles.  The light projections are a very clever way to trigger our imagination to the point where we see ourselves at sea with the crew without being overwhelmed and distracted from the lyrics and music. The interviews on the Bonus tab are worth watching, in large part to witness the excitement of all involved in the creation and production of Moby Dick  the Opera.
The sound and images are of very high quality, including the light projections on stage.
This Blu-Ray disc will be watched and enjoyed many times.",1419724800,,1510,4.890625

5973041,5,B00FABG2QA,"Herman Melville's novel ""Moby-Dick"" has fascinated composers, resulting in a number of large orchestral and vocal settings. This grand opera by the American composer Jake Heggie with libretto by Gene Scheer is the most recent attempt to transform Melville's profoundly tumultuous work into music. The opera premiered in Dallas in 2010 and has since already been performed in several venues. The San Francisco Opera directed by Patrick Summers presented the opera in 2012 and produced this DVD version. In addition to this DVD, I had the opportunity to see a stunning live performance of ""Moby-Dick"" by the Washington Opera in its east coast premiere early this year.

The opera and production are stunning in every way. Heggie's music is both declamatory and lyrical. It is distinctly modern but accessible while capturing the varied aspects of life at sea. The music is passionate and tragic with moments of tenderness and playfulness. The crew dances. In one of the best scenes of the opera, Captain Ahab and his mate Starbuck reminisce about life at home. The music for this moment has a nostalgic quality. In other scenes Heggie captures Ahab's madness and obsession with the destruction it brings in its wake.

Gene Scheer's libretto condenses Melville's 600 page novel into about two and one-half hours of music. The opera is well-paced and captures the spirit of Melville's masterpiece. The large opening section of ""Moby-Dick"" which takes place on land is omitted entirely as are the long passages in the novel on whaling and whales. The opera takes place entirely at sea with much of the action telescoped and condensed. Melville's famous opening sentence ""Call me Ishmael"" is transformed to the final sentence of the opera.

The staging of this opera presented a task. The setting captures the large, foreboding quality of the Pequod replete with the whaler's three tall masts. There are also scenes in the whaling boats with their harpooners and, of course, the large scene of destruction at the end. The settings were presented convincingly.

The vocal lines in this opera are difficult in range and mirror the speech patterns of the characters. Tenor Jay Hunter Morris rants and raves as Captain Ahab. In addition to his singing, Morris acts his role convincingly with his movements, gestures, and with the glints in his eye. Jonathan Lemalau offers a sympathetic portrayal of the harpooner Queequeg, his face and body replete with tattoos while Steven Costello plays ""Greenhorn"" or Ishmael, the lonely new crew member. Ismael's role in the opera is reduced from his central role as the narrator in Melville's novel. Morgan Smith portrays the anguished Starbuck and captures the first mate's moral dilemma when he is presented with the opportunity to kill his mad captain. The opera includes an expanded role for the cabinboy Pip, performed by the only female member of the cast, Talise Trevigne. With tambourine, ""flying"", and subtle commentary on the action Trevigne's Pip is a highlight of the production.

This set presents the entire opera on a single disk. The second disk consists of interviews with the composer, librettist, and several of the singers.

Heggie's ""Moby-Dick"" joins a growing list of American operas, including Joplin's ""Treemonisha"", Gershwin's ""Porgy and Bess"", and Copland's ""The Tender Land"", among others. It is the second opera in recent years setting an American classic, following Robert Aldridge's 2007 ""Elmer Gantry"" with libretto by Herschel Garfein. Heggie's ""Moby-Dick"" is a grand accomplishment in American opera.",1401321600,,3563,5.209424083769633
5973042,5,B00FABG2QA,"I saw this opera live and while there are surely things to dislike about it, I highly recommend it. The incidental (or you might well call it the score as this is more of a live cinema than an opera ) is so wonderfully melancholic and beautiful, that anything you might dislike about the opera (I am not a fan of the singing in English) seems small in comparison.

Worth purchasing!",1400889600,2,382,4.380281690140845
5973043,5,B00FABG2QA,"this is an opera adaptation of Moby Dick and, like in all operas, it requires a lot of cutting, so it can fit into a reasonable amount of time. It ends like the book with the destruction of the boat and only the narrator survives. The music by Heggie is not accepted by modern critics, because they are avant-garde, and the funny thing is that avant-garde for them is at least 100 years old, and I cannot understand why a 100-year-old thing can still be considered avant-garde. But, Heggie is more accepted by modern critics, like Adams or Benjamin or Puts, and we have to be grateful for it, otherwise we would be seeing all over the grand macabre. At any rate, Heggie's music is OK, it has essentially abolished melody and is based on more modern approaches. I enjoyed it, and many of you will.",1396915200,,796,4.458904109589041
5973044,5,B00FABG2QA,"Composer Jack Heggie and librettist Gene Scheer have successfully created an excellent opera ""Moby Dick"" based on Herman Melville's monumental American novel based on 19th century New England whaling adventures. The libretto is tight, direct and fully functional. It is laced with couplets as""tough, rare and bloody""and interlaced by musical modules of rhythmic devices the sum of which makes this a fast moving, action packed opera with no longueurs.
This production from San Francisco Opera Company, 2012, is of a commission from five opera companies: Dallas Opera, San Diago Opera, Calgary Opera and the State Opera of South Australia. Director Leonard Foglia has assembled a top-notch cast for this state-of-the-art production. The Captain Ahab is Jay Hunter Morris who will be familiar to opera-goers as the last minute addition to the Met's ""Siegfried"" of a few seasons past that saved the day. Here he demonstrates his dramatic verve in a challenging and harrowing delivery of Ahab's obsession and growing madness. From his opening soliloquy "" I leave a white and turbid wake"" (from the novel) to the crew rousing ""Death to Moby Dick"" to the final tragic end, Morris is master of the full dimensions of dramatic vocal intensity. It is an exhausting trip for him and the audience he carries with him on his relentless decent to death.
As noted before the cast is studded with star performances. Morgan Smith in his role as first mate Starbuck is forever seeing the hand of God in all the events and only dreams of the house on the hill in Nantucket. His scene with the loaded gun and the sleeping Ahab is most tense. A terrific performance as the lonely new crew member Greenhorn is presented by Stephen Costello. He is befriended by the Samoan decorated ""Prince"" now harpooner Queequeg played by the noted bass Jonathan Lemalu, who is Samoan.  It is he that names his new friend Greenhorn as ""Ishmael"" only revealed at the end of the opera. Of special note to me was seeing the Second Mate, Mr. Stubbs, played well by Robert Orth. I remember him from years back of association with Chicago Opera Theater of which I was then a board member.
As an opera, the music and text are quite approachable and though no match for sea-going operas a ""Billy Budd"" or ""Peter Grimes"" should be a popular opera with new as well as experienced opera audiences.",1396051200,,2350,4.860349127182045

Those who feel 21st-century music should be atonal and alienating will be disappointed by the appealing score. The work does, however, go its own way, not treading in the footsteps of tonal writers such as Philip Glass and John Adams. Jake Heggie's score may represent a form of neo-romanticism.

There may be some disappointments (""A Streetcar Named Desire"" comes to mind), but generally, from ""Il Postino to ""Little Women"" I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I have watched.  This production is, as they French would say, hors de concours.  I was quite curious to see how a sea epic in which the sea is actually a protagonist would translate into the visuals required of a stage presentation.  I needn't have feared.  The singers are simply fantastic.  It is also a quintessentially American theme: war on Nature (the Greeks called it Hubris, overreaching) with its predictable results.

The music is the most heartrending modern music I've ever heard, and gives the feel of the sea and whaling in the 19th century so very well. The principal performers all seem to have gone beyond their normal excellence (and they all are indeed excellent) and put their very souls into their performances.

Jay Hunter Morris, particularly his eyes paired with his lyrical voice, is as powerful and demonic as Melville's Ahab himself. Maybe more, because it happens so quickly - - I can't read the text of Moby Dick in 150 minutes! Morris, Costello, and M. Smith are absolutely compelling in Heggie's brilliant rendering of this epic saga.",1383609600,9,422,4.794520547945205
5973062,5,B00FABG2QA,"Heggie's new opera, ""Moby Dick"" has proven to be an instant American operatic classic. The production, filmed live from the San Francisco Opera features state-of-the-art technology (lighting, projections, etc.) to seamlessly move the opera's scenes deftly and, not infrequently, adding a little ""awe"" power for the audience. But the show is not about effects, but rather about epic storytelling through music and the effects and stage designs are simply the platform for an overwhelming operatic treatment of one of our great, classic tales.

Heggie's score has moments that recall Britten (strongly) as well as other composers, yet, having heard most of his music to this point, stands on its own with a stamp of recognizable individuality. There were snippets and melodies of things that I ""thought"" I knew, but were (much like Humperdinck with his Hansel und Gretel) wholly original - yet undeniably familiar. That's a nice gift.

The individual performances are, to a one, exemplary and the commitment each singer gives to his or her role is commendable and clear. Jay Hunter Morris stepped into some big shoes (Ben Heppner was the celebrated original Ahab) and does so admirably. With a more pointed sound and less sweetness of tone than Heppner, Morris presents a different Ahab, but no less formidable and his madness is, at times, appropriately unnerving.

Each of Ahab's crew members are immediately likable, each earning the audiences sympathies, none, so much (for this viewer) as Stephen Costello's Greenhorn. Costello's attractive if tightly wound vibrato imbues Greenhorn with the innocent melancholy of an orphan loner, and his growing attachment to the ""savage"" Queequeg and the friendship that ensues between the pair of loners is infinitely touching, their duet at the opening of the second act, an emotional and musical highlight. As Queequeg, baritone Jonathan Lemalu is going to be a tough act to follow for anyone replacing him. Of Polynesian island physicality, and elaborately tattooed from the face down, Lemalu's ""savage"" is noble, and in many ways, the most thoughtful and honest shipmate.

Talise Trevigne's clear, high flying soprano and impish size make her perfect as Pip the cabin boy (and she gets to fly!) Morgan Smith's Starbuck is likewise perfect, his great aria that closes Act 1 revealing his torturous moral dilemma of how to save his shipmates from Ahab the Mad.

Patrick Summers, a Heggie favorite, leads the San Francisco forces with assurance, driving the music furiously in its storm scenes while allowing his singers plenty of room for lyrical expansion - which Heggie gives his characters plenty of.

I was happy to learn that after 5 or 6 productions so far, ""Moby Dick"" will be playing at even more companies in the upcoming years - a promising sign.",1383350400,11,2799,5.154185022026431

8613774,5,B00FABG2QA,"I had never heard of  this composer and could not imagine an opera on Moby Dick.
Wow! What a revelation. Tuneful, dramatic captures the essence of Melville's tome.",1445904000,,163,4.821428571428571
8613775,5,B00FABG2QA,"The opera is a brilliant adaptation of the book, concluding with the book's famous first line.  The music blends modern orchestral technique with great musical emotion.  It is entirely approachable, often hummable.  The production, a joint effort of multiple opera companies, includes incredible video backdrops.  The singing is splendid, as other reviews have well documented.  Of all my opera videos, this currently gets the most play, often just to show a friend the magnificent overture graphics.  Warning, some of the tunes are so catchy, you'll have a hard time clearing them from your head.",1440892800,,597,5.297872340425532
