""Natural Selection"" (2011 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Linda (played by Rachael Harris), who lives within a closed Christian comunity in suburban Houston. Linda finds out that her husband Abe has a 23 yr. old son, now living in Florida, the result of Abe's frequent visits (unbeknownst to Linda) to the local sperm donor bank. Abe suffers a stroke and may be in his last days, and as a last wish, he asks Linda to look up his son and bring him back for one final visit. Linda obliges and finds Raymond (played by Matt O'Leary). Raymong couldn't be more different from Linda ans his only motivation to join Linda for the drive back is that he seems to be in trouble with the law. What we get next is a road movie that chronicles the ups and downs of Linda and Raymond. To tell you more about the plot would surely ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: it takes the movie a while to hit its stride. As the stage-setting scenes play out in the beginning, I found it all to be quite unnatural and even a bit forced. But then a magical thing happens: the Linda and Raymond characters are played perfectly against each other, and simply create something specical on the screen. The pivotal moment in the movie comes about half-way, when one evening Linda and Raymond break into a closed restaurant as they are desparate for food, and then start telling deep personal secrets about themselves to the other. Prepare to be surprised and moved! Kudos to writer-director Robbie Pickering for bringing us a different slice of life. And the acting awards that Racheal Harris won for this movie are absolutely deserved, she carries this movie on her shoulders from start to finish. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a quality indie movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywwod fare and in fact is slightly left-of-center in the best possible way, you cannot go wrong with ""Natural Selection""!",1368921600,3,2199,4.564556962025317

8530073,4,B008RN5S1I,"After watching this, one realizes that Rachel Harris is woefully underused in drama. Comedy comes easy for her, but rare is the actor that can do both so extremely well. Looking forward to more drama roles.",1458259200,,206,4.75

8530077,5,B008RN5S1I,"Loved the story and loved the actors.  It''s a comedy and yet so serious.  Stuck to my head for months.  I also loved the ending, I saw it more than once.",1383609600,,154,3.903225806451613
8530078,4,B008RN5S1I,"I was not expecting the story that was presented in this film. From the outset, thought the script was something different and amusing. Even if it is a bit of a ""dark comedy"", it is somewhat a lesson on life. Acting was great. Enjoyed the twists and turns. This kind of film gives Indies a real place in entertainment.",1374105600,,318,4.406779661016949
8530079,3,B008RN5S1I,"Well acted. Beautifully filmed. But this movie just did't work for me. It's a dark comedy, for sure, and maybe it was just my mood that day.",1370736000,,140,4.222222222222222
8530080,5,B008RN5S1I,"I really like this movie, it's sad that such well made films will never make it to the main stream.  Great story, kept me interested, even made me get in touch with my sappy romantic side which I didn't know I had, would recommend it.  Not that it's a romance, more of a few statements about life, made me laugh out loud at times, tugged at my heart strings at others, made me even think a bit about my own life.  and all that in less than 2 hours",1369612800,,447,4.0
