4404247,5,B004LSJJRM,"With this video, WhistleFritz continues their Spanish for Kids series with all the excellence we have come to expect.  We have all their DVDs and music CDs; my kids LOVE them ALL!

What makes WhistleFritz different? Real people AND cartoon characters.  My kids can *see* the mouth and face of the instructor and the kids saying and singing each and every words.  This makes a huge difference in their ability to pronounce the Spanish words correctly.  The teacher is a native speaker and that makes a huge difference as well.  When my kids say a Spanish word they say it with the proper inflection and accent.

The cartoon characters make the DVDs fun, bright and engaging.  The use of songs, matching movements and dance bring all the sensorial elements (except smell of course but a creative parent can fix that)into the learning scene.  Even when we are in the car I can extend our learning time there with the music CDs.

On top of all of that, they now offer lesson plans to extend the learning experience and deepen the immersion.

The only thing better than WhistleFritz is an instructor in your home with her own set of happing teaching kids she would bring to each lesson.  Lol! When I showed these vidoes to my daughter's Montessori school Spanish instructor, she was thrilled. She laughed and said, ""There goes my job.""  Clearly, she thinks they are excellent.

Keep them coming WhistleFritz!  Ms rpido, por favor!",1297641600,8,1425,4.759183673469388

4404262,4,B004LSJJRM,"I'd ""love"" it if it didn't have a significant amount of Halloween content in the Fall section.  We don't celebrate Halloween so I either have to skip over that part or explain the whole issue to my daughter.  Otherwise, it's well-done, fun, and interesting.",1416355200,,257,4.818181818181818
4404263,5,B004LSJJRM,My 2 year old loves these videos and has already picked up many Spanish words which we repeat during our daily routines. He can't sit still when they start singing and I have to admit I have a hard time myself:),1409356800,,211,4.170731707317073
4404264,5,B004LSJJRM,What a fun CD. I'll be using it with the other Whistlefritz materials for teaching my classes with ages 5-9,1400544000,,107,4.4

4404266,5,B004LSJJRM,"My child LOVES the Fritzy series. We have several of these and are great. As a native-Spanish speaker, I am glad my child gets a quality DVD perfect for acquiring the language. I wish this company made more, and I also hope they make digital copies that can be downloaded to an iPad!!",1388275200,,284,4.377358490566038
4404267,5,B004LSJJRM,"These are well made, entertaining and easy to follow.  My daughter watches these instead of TV.  She also likes to listen to the songs from these videos on CD.",1369526400,,159,4.448275862068965
4404268,5,B004LSJJRM,"The video is well develop and have real examples of the day to day vocabulary in Spanish my kids love it, I speak to them in Spanish all the time but they respond in English, this video is helping them to talk back to me in Spanish more often.",1359331200,,243,3.979591836734694
4404269,5,B004LSJJRM,"This is a very good DVD, as are the other ones in this series.

My kids are 4 and 6 years old, and when we began this series of DVDs and CDs eight months ago, they knew only three words of Spanish. Now, I would say that they recognize at least 200 words, probably close to 250 words.  My kids like to watch these DVDs and then try to recreate/act out  their favorite singing scenes from the DVDs.

The CDs in this series are also excellent and reinforce and add to the vocabulary in DVDs.

My kids have learned enough Spanish from this series that they now understand most of the vocabulary in Spanish books for babies and very young kids. For example, we read the book ""Goodnight Moon"" in Spanish recently, and my kids recognized almost every word, thanks to this DVD and CD series.

The Whistlefritz series has been fantastic for my kids for starting them off in Spanish.  A big thank you to the people who put this series together.",1356134400,,934,4.364161849710983
4404270,5,B004LSJJRM,"I bought this DVD for my son as a way to introduce him to and familiarize him with Spanish. It's filled with fun sing-alongs that incorporate vocabulary and conjugation that young children can enjoy. I have several of the other DVD's in the series as well and they are fantastic! The little mouse, Fritzi, is my son's favorite. He's a cute little animated mouse that interacts with the other characters in the movie.",1346025600,,416,4.712328767123288
4404271,4,B004LSJJRM,"Good articulation.  This keeps the attention of my 18 month old daughter.  Video is expensive for the short length but what's there is good.  The cover says ""Shot in HD"" which seems like a duplicitous marketing scheme since it does not come on HD media.  At least this one has the appropriate widescreen format.  Some others in the same series have a 4:3 aspect ratio.",1343952000,,368,4.6
4404272,5,B004LSJJRM,"I wanted to get my 2.5 year old son learning another language as early as possible, but without knowing any Spanish myself, I went the DVD route.  I researched a number of different Spanish for kids educational movies before selecting this one, and I have not been disappointed.  This uses immersion as opposed to translation, meaning the entire movie is in Spanish.

""The Seasons"" DVD is the first one we have purchased and after watching it 3 or 4 times already my 2.5 year old is picking up on some of the language.  The main character is a lady who narrates by speaking only in Spanish.  Images of the seasons, clips of children playing in the different types of weather, and catchy songs are used as an interactive, fun way to get kids involved in what's going on.  For example, in winter kids are shown having a great time sledding down a hill and there's a song to go with it.  In fall, the leaves fall and kids are jumping in them, while someone's singing a song about fall.  The movie connects with kids by introducing a mouse named Fritzi who does not talk, but nods or shakes his head.

A very entertaining way to introduce a new language.",1332979200,2,1150,4.464114832535885
4404273,5,B004LSJJRM,I agree with other commenters on this book...the translation flows perfectly. The book is simple enough for a 13 month old. Each page has about a sentence worth nd great pictures which allow you to come up with your own story if you really want to. What 1 yr old doesnt know a doggie? This is perfect because they see something they recognize on every page.,1330992000,,357,4.424242424242424
4404274,5,B004LSJJRM,"We purchased this video for our two-and-a-half-year-old twins, and they love it. One of them asked for it at least 20 times in a row every time it was his turn to choose a video, and he is now correcting my Spanish grammar at times. (I am not fluent but speak some.) The best thing about this series is that it strikes an excellent balance between complete immersion and speaking slowly enough (with enough visual cues) that it is very obvious what is meant. So even though there are no distracting English translations to slow you down, you can follow the Spanish because they speak slowly, repeat important phrases, and use visual cues like pointing and pictures. This is the way we learn our primary language, so it makes sense for kids to learn their secondary language the same way. This is by far the best series available if you want to introduce your children to Spanish...don't waste any time on the (lame) videos by OTHER companies that use only a few words of Spanish here and there with mostly English throughout. Get all the Whistlefritz stuff right away and your kids will thank you...in Spanish.",1309478400,3,1110,4.668367346938775
4404275,4,B004LSJJRM,"My son enjoys the DVD, he's not trying to speak Spanish, but that's fine.  It's educational without being overbearing.",1307404800,,118,5.2105263157894735
4404276,3,B004LSJJRM,"This Spanish video is OK, and studies do show that immersion in the best way to learn a language, but my kids just don't seem to pick it up this way, they seem to do much better with Spanish/Engish translation videos. Don't think I would buy another immersion video.",1303344000,,266,4.448979591836735
4404277,4,B004LSJJRM,"The DVD ""Spanish for Kids: Las Estaciones"" is all in Spanish and has a woman who is the main speaker.  She speaks slowly and does repeat her Spanish words.  She is also very happy and friendly.  She also uses animation and real life shots to display what the Spanish words mean.  For example, a pic of snow and winter is shown and then real life kids sledding is shown along with the Spanish word shown and sang about.  The DVD is very fun and uses a lot to display the words.  I put this on for my 2 year old and he watched it in silence just trying to soak it in.  He doesn't talk yet so I didn't expect him to start repeating the words, but it doesn't hurt to hear them and hopefully retain them.  I have seen other foreign language DVDs and they use both English and the other language, this DVD is strictly foreign language so make sure that is what your looking for.

I really like too the booklet that comes inside the DVD box.  It contains a whole bunch of words and phrases in English/Spanish and it contains the songs lyrics from the DVD in Spanish.  This is a great reference for parents to use to help out kids, and learn themselves!",1298937600,3,1145,4.206422018348624
8434750,5,B004LSJJRM,My 20 month old daughter attends Spanish school and they watch Fritzi. This video is super expensive for 30 minutes but my daughter loves it and requests to watch it on repeat. My 4 & 6 year old have also enjoyed.,1515456000,,213,4.219512195121951
8434751,5,B004LSJJRM,This is excellent for all ages!,1486598400,,31,4.333333333333333
8434752,5,B004LSJJRM,"Spanish for Kids: Las Estaciones is an excellent language resource.  I have found that my four and a half year old is most attentive, if I allow him to watch 15-20 minutes of the DVD at one sitting.  I attempt to review some of the vocabulary words two or three times a day.  If my son works with the DVD (and me) for four days (""because he is four years old""), then we will go to the store and he may choose a small toy; it is a reward for his efforts ; )  Enjoy!",1466726400,,464,3.8526315789473684
8434753,3,B004LSJJRM,"We have been enjoying this series, but wasn't crazy about the ghost in this one. For those of you who don't celebrate Halloween, you may want to skip that part.",1464307200,,160,4.366666666666666
8434754,5,B004LSJJRM,These Whistlefritz series are phenomenal for learning Spanish!! Not only are they great for kids but even I am learning a lot from them. The immersion teaching technique (all characters only speaking Spanish in the video the entire time) is really the best way to learn a language. It's how we all learned to speak as babies after all. We have all of them and I wish they would make a bunch more!,1464048000,,396,4.438356164383562
8434755,5,B004LSJJRM,This is a show I enjoy watching with my daughter. I learn Spanish with her and it's entertaining to watch. Wish there were more Whitlsefritz videos. The videos are safe to watch in case you're a parent who is trying to be conscientious about what your children view. Nothing to worry about. This is truly a fun learning video for kids. My daughter learns and loves to sign along.,1463616000,,379,4.507246376811594
8434756,4,B004LSJJRM,"This is a very good series. I'm actually a senior adult who has traveled in several Latin countries and speak a bit of ""broken"" traveler's Spanish. I started watching this series in order to hear Spanish spoken by a native speaker. Listening to Americans speak Spanish is not too helpful, in my opinion. You need to hear how it's spoken by people who actually use the language. I find this series helpful for that. I can't really tell how a child would react, but I'm sure they would get some of the concepts. It would probably be good to have an adult help them point out some of the words and concepts, but for elementary age children I'm sure they would pick up quite a bit. I have watched this video and others in the series several times and every time I watch I learn more. It might even be a ""5"" but I seldom rate anything that high. Enjoy!",1454544000,,847,4.3
8434757,5,B004LSJJRM,These videos are sheer brilliance.  I have my daughter watch a video every morning.  Then we speak a little bit every day while driving around in the car.  She is learning phrases instead of just vocabulary.  I love these videos and hope that there are more to come.,1437264000,,266,4.479166666666667
8434758,5,B004LSJJRM,Arrived on time. In excellent condition. My 1 year old loves it. Easy to follow.,1435795200,,80,4.4
8434759,2,B004LSJJRM,"Super short - even shorter than the other 2 we have. NOT worth $20!
They should have combined this one and Fritzi's birthday one - then it MIGHT be worth the price.
""Vamos a Jugar"" is my - and my kids' - favorite of their productions.
The kids don't really like watching this one.",1433808000,,280,4.203703703703703
