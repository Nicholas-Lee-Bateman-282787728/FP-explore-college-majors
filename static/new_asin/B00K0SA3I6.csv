8654951,2,B00K0SA3I6,"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events with each one having a special theme. The second edition of ""Knockouts Knockdown"" was the theme based around the Knockouts division hosted by Ethan Carter III & Rockstar Spud where the current knockouts faced off against other women from the independent scene in matches with the winners advancing to a gauntlet battle royal for the crown of ""Queen Of The Knockouts"" with Mike Tenay & Taz doing commentary on this show. It should be noted that they had a highlight package on each TNA Knockout before their match along each independent woman being introduced at the beginning of the show with a few comedic interactions including EC3 & a woman he knew from a past life along with Spud having some major chemistry with one of the girls.

Gail Kim vs. Veda Scott - This match started off with one person playing possum in order to gain the early advantage only for her opponent to quickly recover as both girls traded some of the same offense including moves from springboard positions & attempting aerial offense off the top rope in what was an solid match.

Angelina Love vs. Scarlett - Velvet Sky was a ringside with Love talking about the obvious comparisons between the them only to use it as a distraction while taunting her on the microphone beating her down & keeping her down with Velvet coming into play on more than one occasion as Scarlett was only able to get in a small amount of offense with this pretty much being an exhibition match for Love.

Velvet Sky vs. Reby - ""Sky vs. Sky"" here as Love returned the favor being in Sky's match for this match as Reby was able to work over Sky including getting a slap where every man wished his hand was & able to get both Beautiful People in one move while Velvet was able to get some momentum that almost split Reby in half as Love made her presence known more than once during this match in what was watchable but never left first gear.

Madison Rayne vs. Havok - It should be noted that this event was taped earlier in the year before Havok was officially a member of the roster as she was dominate using her power to catch Rayne & maneuver her into the ringside environment on the outside along with various power moves & submissions with Madison taking advantage of any mistake made by Havok using the strategy of ""hit & move"" trying to take out the size & power advantage either on the mat or in the air what left a strong impression for Havoc but also telling the story of Madison fighting from behind.

Taryn Terrell vs, Karlee Perez - Perez called out Taryn before the match about being ""fake"" with Taryn giving a response that only fired up Perez with repeated punches working over Taryn on the mat with such offense as a unique drop toehold & moves like a full nelson & crucifix while Taryn having offense from a running position & coming off the top rope in what was an average match but also a nice showing from Karlee Perez.

Brittany vs. Mia Yim - As Yim & the announcers noted before & during this match, Yim was the only non-Knockout from the previous event who returned this year and showcased some moves early that we're used to seeing from X division star Manic as both girls traded momentum executing offense on the outside of the ring & various submission attempts along with both women fighting on the top rope at one point in what was definitely the most competitive match of the night.

Brooke Tessmacher vs. Deonna - Despite her no longer being in her ""Aces & Eights"" gimmick, Brooke was still in heel mode as he was taking pages from Jerry Lawler's old playbook by continuing to taunt & insult her with the microphone while beating her down allowing Deonna to keep catching her off guard with quick roll-ups & series of offense causing Brooke to keep going to the outside in what was another average match.

O.D.B. vs. Marti Belle - Based off their interaction earlier in the night, Rockstar Spud was in Belle's corner for this match with O.D.B. using her power & size advantage working her over before Spud allowed for the advantage to get back to Belle only for O.D.B. to regain it back as this match was more about the interaction between Spud & Belle more than anything else leading to a special bonus match afterwords where one person got the clothes beat off them...literally.

Gauntlet Match - This was held under ""Royal Rumble"" rules held between all the winners of the previous matches throughout the night that went close to twenty minutes that was just an average battle royal that didn't have any interesting highlights until it came down to the final two with karma coming back to one of the competitors for what happened earlier in the night.

This event overall was a step down from the previous year as some of the non-Knockouts had an impressive showing such as Havok (who would go on to be not only signed but become Knockouts Champion by the time this show aired) & Mia Yim but most of the matches never left first gear or just didn't click here so it says something when EC3 & Spud were two of the most entertaining things on the show so I would just recommend the Brittany/Yim match for viewing but skipping the rest of the card.",1428019200,2,5244,4.510526315789473
8654952,3,B00K0SA3I6,"The Eddie Edwards-James Storm match was not great but pretty good. The Gail Kim-Madison Rayne match while not as good as their bouts,it was still fun to watch. The The BroMans (Jessie Godderz and Robbie E)-Mr. Anderson-Sanada-tag team match was short but sweet. The Eric Young-Robert Roode match was solid to say the least. The Kurt Angle-Magnus match was also solid but it felt more like a opening free tv bout then everything else. The Angelina Love-ODB match was so-so at best. The EC3-Davey Richards match was a good back and forth match with with the ending. The Bully Ray/Gunner-Samuel Shaw/Kenny King-tag team match was an average, throw away free TV match. The Team Young-Team EC3-Elimination Tag match was also not great but pretty good. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1425686400,,777,4.8059701492537314
8654953,3,B00K0SA3I6,"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme.  The second edition of ""World Cup"" was the theme of this event however the international teams were abandoned for four captains drafting 3 males & 1 female onto their team to compete in a single & a tag team & a knockouts match for points with the two teams with the highest amount of points competing at the end of the night to win the trophy.  The four teams include Team Young (Eric Young, Bully Ray, Eddie Edwards, Gunner, O.D.B.), Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Davey Richards, Mr. Anderson, Sanada, Madison Rayne), Team EC3 (Ethan Carter III, Jessie Godderz, Robbie E, Magnus, Gail Kim), and Team Roode (Bobby Rodde, James Storm, Kenny King, Samuel Shaw, Angelina Love).

Eddie Edwards vs. James Storm - Eddie took control early send Storm to the outside & working him over on the floor before Storm regained control working over the throat area as they traded momentum trading kicks on the apron along with each man catching their opponent coming off the top rope with a move of their own in a nice match.

Madison Rayne vs. Gail Kim - Both women had stalemates early with Madison getting the upper hand with various takeovers & quick pin attempts before Gail was able to work her over including a unique head scissors submission putting her leg over Madison's head along with dropping all over weight across the back as both men fought hard against each other going back & forth as it came down to one woman being able to take advantage of a mistiming by the other.

Mr. Anderson & Sanada vs. BroMans - Anderson & Sanada had some fun with the ring entrances & at the expense of their opponents throughout the match while showing some strong teamwork with repeated quick tags to keep a fresh man in while either working over a body part or repeating his partners offense to the point where it took the numbers game for the BroMans to gain control singling out one man & keeping him grounded in a match that was entertaining with it's comedic moments.

Eric Young vs. Bobby Roode - The former Team Canada members started out with Young in control being able to keep staying one step ahead of Roode by reversing his offense & keeping a fast pace while constantly going back to working an armbar before Roode was eventually able to slow the pace down keeping Young grounded working his neck as they went back & forth resulting in a solid encounter.

Kurt Angle vs. Magnus - Former Main Event Mafia members started out with Magnus being able to gain the early upper hand working over Angle's neck with a strong side headlock from both a standing & grounded position holding on to it while also working over Angle's back area with his power & own body weight before Angle was able to come back with some big offensive moves including his trademark triple german suplexes & running top rope superplex & anklelock while Magnus was able to have some counters for Angle's offense along with hitting his signature moves as well in a match that was good considering how it happened right before Angle was scheduled to have knee surgery so they never left first gear & kept the same pace throughout the entire match.

O.D.B. vs. Angelina Love - O.D.B. showcased her superior strength advantage early on causing Velvet Sky to get involved to the point where the most unlikely person was showing the effects of their involvement in the match before Love kept trying to neutralize O.D.B.'s power while using Velvet to her advantage whenever possible as this was another match that was more entertaining for the interaction with EVERYONE involved in during & after the match more than anything else.

Davey Richards vs. Ethan Carter III - Davey started out in control in & outside of the ring with his various kicks before EC3 responded overpowering Davey heavily working over the midsection with bear hugs & abdominal stretches as both men went back & forth with Davey delivering a series of offense consisting of various kicks & aerial offense before both men went into a series of executing one big move or submission after another in what turned out to be the best match of the night.

Bully Ray & Gunner vs. Kenny King & Samuel Shaw - ""Calf-zilla & Quad-zilla"" were dominate early taking advantage of King trying to show up his opponents early causing King & Shaw to resort to illegal tactics to gain & keep the momentum in their favor working over the neck & throat area while Gunner & Bully continued to some good teamwork together in an average match.

Elimination Match - Team Young vs. Team Roode: Team Young (Eric Young, Bully Ray, Eddie Edwards, Gunner, O.D.B.) vs. Team Roode (Bobby Rodde, James Storm, Kenny King, Samuel Shaw, Angelina Love) - This was under inter-gender rules meaning that the women & men were allowed in the ring at the same time leading to various highlights such as DJ Zema Ion getting involved & Bully Ray giving a response that only a ""bully"" would do while later Bully had a response after Gail Kim dared to chopped her, the teamwork with Team EC3 from double to 4 on 1 teaming, surprising eliminations, Rockstar Spud involvement in the match, issues between certain teammates, and when it gets down to the final two.  A fun match.

This was one of those events that didn't have a bad unwatchable match on it as there was some average & solid wrestling along with comedic & entertaining moments but didn't have a match that was very memorable or worth going out of your way to watch.",1424390400,,5638,4.642928786359077
8654954,3,B00K0SA3I6,"The Magnus-Mr Anderson match was a solid and entertaining bout. The Kenny King-Sonjay Dutt match while not a traditional high-energy X-Division style match,it was still good in it's own right. The Lei'D Tapa-Hannah Blossom match was so-so at best. The DOC/Knux-Sho Funkaki/Petey Williams tag team match was fun little tag bout,nothing great but enjoyable. The Wes Brisco-Rockstar Spud match was mediocre. The Bad Influence(Daniels & Kazarian)-Douglas Williams/Rob Terry tag team match was clean and simple in a good way. The Ivelisse Velez-Mickie James match was also a good,clean and simple bout. The James Storm-Judas Mesias match was a solid TV style bout. The 5-on-5 World Cup Elimination Finals match between Team USA & Aces & Eights was predictable but still a solid and fun bout. I give this PPV a 6 out fo 10.",1408233600,,817,5.104477611940299
8654955,3,B00K0SA3I6,"With all of the talk of the 2014 World Cup I couldn't help but get this DVD. It's a rather interesting concept. Four Teams of 5 compete in matches and the 2 teams with the most wins compete in a 10-man Survivor Series type elimination Match. Team USA vs. Team UK vs. Team International vs. Team Aces & 8s (...really?).

The concept I actually kind of like and the matches are not bad themselves. None of the matches particularly stand out except the main event. I call this more of a ""Relaxing"" TNA ppv when you just want to have some good ol' wrestling on without any crazy storylines or drama.

Try to get this a little cheap, but overall not bad.",1404432000,,649,4.311475409836065
8654956,3,B00K0SA3I6,"This PPV is part of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme.  This edition is based off a special ""World Cup"" tournament featuring current & past TNA superstars forming international based teams (one heavyweight, one tag team, one X division, one knockout) competing for points to win the trophy at the end of the night.  The four teams include Team International (Petey Williams, Sonjay Dutt, Funaki, Judias Mecias, Lei'D Tapa), Team U.K. (Douglas Williams, Rob Terry, Magnus, Rockstar Spud, Hannah Blossom), Team U.S.A. (Kazarian, Christopher Daniels, James Storm, Kenny King, Mickie James), and Team Aces & Eights (D.O.C., Knux, Wes Brisco, Mr. Anderson, and honorary member Ivelisse).

Magnus vs. Mr. Anderson - Both men started out trading momentum early before Anderson was able to target & heavily work over the arm with various stretches & stomps such as the flying armbar & hammerlock while also using the ropes to his advantage resulting in what was a short but average match telling a good story of working over the arm.

Sonjay Dutt vs. Kenny King - They match started out with both men trading armdrags with Sonjay doing fast paced offense using a head scissors takeover & cannonball off the apron while King grounded Dutt with various side headlocks & chinlocks as they traded momentum as Dutt continued to deliver fast paced high flying offense off a springboard or top rope position while King resorted to various kicks.  This was a good match.

Hannah Blossom vs. Lei'D Tapa - Tapa used his superior size & strength advantage to dominate easily tossing her around the ring & strong whips in the corner resulting in Blossom trying to ""hit & run"" taking Tapa down with low dropkicks & going aerial with a crossbody.  This match was pretty short & sweet telling a ""David vs. Goliath"" story.

Petey Williams & Funaki vs. D.O.C. & Knux - Aces & Eights jumped both competitors from behind & singled out one member of the team with brawling tactics & power moves while using illegal tactics behind the referee before a tag was made to the fresh partner who able to pick up the pace & take out both members at once causing Aces & Eights to resort to desperate tactics.  This was just a basic tag team match.

Rockstar Spud vs. Wes Brisco - Brisco used his superior size & power advantage keeping Spud grounded working over the midsection while Spud attempted to pick up the pace with his speed advantage with dropkicks & various dives off & over the top rope in another match that was just average as I was more entertained by Taz on commentary being unable to get Rockstar Spud's name right than the match itself.

Douglas Williams & Rob Terry vs. Bad Influence - Rob Terry showcased his superior power advantage to the point where both Kaz & Daniels were arguing over who was going to be legal man to face him while Williams grounded & stretched both men causing Bad Influence to resort to tactics of double teaming & blind tags while singling out one member away from the other keeping him grounded as both teams traded momentum throughout the contest & even using that same tactics against each other.  A good tag match.

Mickie James vs. Ivelisse - It should be noted that this event was filmed months before Brooke Tessmacher joined Aces & Eights so Ivelisse was chosen as an honorary member for this event as her & Mickie were evenly matched early on with Mickie gaining control causing Ivelisse to keep going to the floor before she caught a break working over Mickie's arm to the point where she choked his own arm.  This was an impressive showcasing for Ivelisse as her & Mickie had good chemistry & were evenly matched throughout the contest.

James Storm vs. Judias Mesias - Storm started out in control of the match both in & outside of the ring with punches & kicks along with brawling on the outside using the steel steps & guardrails plus having some fan interaction on the outside before Judas was able to catch Storm dropping him on his head & continuing to work over it with moves like a reverse DDT.  This was a nice match.

Elimination Match - Team U.S.A. vs. Aces & Eights: Kazarian, Christopher Daniels, James Storm, Kenny King, Mickie James vs. D.O.C., Knux, Wes Brisco, Mr. Anderson, Ivelisse - This was under inter-gender rules meaning that the women & men were allowed in the ring at the same time leading to various highlights such as what Mickie gave D.O.C. when he wanted a kiss, all of Team U.S.A. working together with various multi-man teaming including Mickie getting in on the action with all the action, the tactics Aces & Eights resorted to regain control, Mickie looking for payback for what happened earlier in the night, miscommunications between both teams, and the various series of eliminations.  This was a fun match.

While this was a nice concept of team competition utilizing every different division of TNA, all the matches on here were just watchable to average at best with the only match that made a lasting impression once the event was over as Mickie James vs. Ivelisse to the point where they showed the Ultimate X finals of the 2008 World Cup on the PPV broadcast just to fill time so this is an event I would watch on a stream/rental at best.",1398902400,,5358,4.711229946524064
