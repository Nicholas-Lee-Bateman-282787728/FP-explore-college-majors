8550065,4,B00ADEEGIK,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase. The image on this makes it look like it would be 7 individual volumes. But, it is really 1 box set with all of the dvds in a small booklet of double-sided sleeves.

The dvds play just fine on my PS3. Each episode is its own title, and there are no chapters to skip to within the episodes. Personally, After watching the opening and closing a couple of times after they change, I tend to skip over them. Having chapter marks to do so would have been nice, but fast forwarding is easy enough.

The episodes are in Japanese, but have the option of English subtitles. This is where it loses a star to me. The English Subtitles are not really that great. They pass along the general idea of things. But, having first seen a fan subbed version years ago, I know that things are not right. Names are not spelled, or sometimes even listed, correctly. And, while many of the special techniques are spoken in English, like ""Twist Serve"", the subtitles list a translated technique, like ""Spinning Serve"". There are typos in the sub titles and incorrect pronouns. But, overall if you listen to what is being said, since the tennis terms are spoken in English (love - fifteen, change court, service, etc.), and who is saying it, you can usually get a decent idea of what is going on.

I am not sure how these subtitles compare to others, but I would not recommend this to someone who is not used to reading inaccurate subtitles while listening to what is being spoken in another language.",1443139200,3,1515,4.501818181818182
