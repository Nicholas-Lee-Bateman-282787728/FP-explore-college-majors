And this DVD is just another wonderful piece of information to help me grow as a ""business person!"" While I understood how important perception was in the industry I hadn't really understood how to convey how I am perceived through writing! Finally, I found a place to understand how to show the world how unique and special I am! Thanks Lisa, this DVD is GOLD!",1465776000,,468,4.517647058823529

Lisa Gold packs lots of great information into 2 hours, you need to watch it a few times, digest it in sections as it really makes you think about your current system. I wish I had this when I was at drama school, I'd be much better at starting and building relationships with industry professionals.

She shares her understanding of the industry which really empowered me as an actress. I've learnt a lot and was equiped with a 6 step process which is not just for the U.S market but I can apply to the UK market. One of the things that stood out to me was ways to follow-up. I feel much more confident about writing to people I the industry.",1465171200,,761,4.277777777777778
8749235,5,B01B3O5FHY,"This was given to me by Lisa Gold for my professional opinion.

At last a clear and thorough step-by-step guide to writing actor cover notes!  The course is extremely useful as well as informative and entertaining.  Lisa Gold, in her inimitable way, takes the mystery out of the process and actually makes it fun!  The quality of the video is excellent.  A super added bonus is that the workbook for the course is downloadable as well.  Loved this course -- it's the next best thing to being in the room!!
