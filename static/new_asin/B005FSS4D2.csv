8470632,5,B005FSS4D2,"Interesting program about the prostate and the problems which effect its performance. Symptoms of prostate enlargement are: difficulty emptying the bladder, dripping after urination, and having to get up many times per night to use the bathroom. A male's sexual performance is also effected by prostate problems due to the fact of the sheer tiredness experienced from getting up so many times during the night to empty the bladder.

The prostate surrounds the urethra tube like a chestnut, and when it becomes enlarged, it cuts off the flow of urine from the urethra, compressing the urethra tube like a collar.

Prostate surgery is usually performed on an 'out patient' basis. A fiber optic tube filled with jelly is passed through the opening of the penis, and threaded through the urethra to where the prostate is located. This procedure is done under a general anesthetic or a spinal anesthetic (where you feel no pain from the waist down). The procedure is referred to as: TURP, meaning Trans-Urethra Resection Prostate. Once the prostate is examined under fiber optics, the surgeon works to remove chippings or enlarged pieces of the prostate gland, itself. This decreases the enlargement of the prostate, and opens up the urethra channel so that urine can flow freely once more.

There are other procedures to perform prostate surgery including, laser, microwave, and radio frequency to make the channel larger, but the usual fiber optics method is generally the method of surgery utilized to correct the problem.

Once the size of an enlarged prostate gland has been reduced, urinating freely is no longer a problem, although, sometimes the gland will once again enlarge over time, and the procedure may have to be performed again. However, this is rare in most men who have already had the surgery.

Very insightful program about a common male problem. Very well presented so that anyone can understand what the prostate is and how a procedure is performed to decrease an enlarged prostate gland.

Well worth the watch for anyone who is experiencing this problem, or simply wants to know more about the human body and its functions. I highly recommend this program. It is a must watch, especially for men!

Do you have varicose veins? Well, a lot of us do, especially women. This program delves into the problem of varicose veins and their causes, and the operation which can be performed to remove these troublesome veins.

Well presented and interesting program. The medical professional makes it easy to understand the causes and complications resulting from varicose veins. I highly recommend this program to anyone suffering from this condition, or for those who just want to learn more about our bodies and what problems may arise within us. You'll enjoy this program. Watch it to learn more.

Great panel discussion about the gall bladder and gall stones. One panelist in particular, who is facing gall stone surgery herself, actually went to see a fortune teller. The fortune teller told her that she had had gall stone surgery, and advised this lady to do the same. What great advice from a fortune teller!

The gall bladder is a pear-shaped organ which sits directly behind the liver. It stores the bile which is produced by the liver. Bile is the chemical in our bodies which breaks down fats and cholesterol. When too much cholesterol (fatty deposits) build up in the gall bladder you experience symptoms of sharp pain, indigestion, and gas. Gall stones are created when the cholesterol forms crystals, much like grains of sand. These crystals can form into stones which get trapped when the gall bladder is pushing out bile. Sometimes, the stones can even become infected.

The surgeon in this program explains in great detail how the gall bladder works, and how the surgery to remove gall stones is accomplished. There are three ways in which gall stones may be removed: Surgically remove the gall bladder itself, break up the gall stones with ultrasound, or take medication to dissolve the stones.

This program is exceptional in explaining gall stones and how to remove them surgically. Very understandable to the lay person and medical person, alike. So, if your fortune teller advises you to have a gall bladder operation, you'd better listen and do as she says. This program is a great watch - highly educational about a medical problem many people face. It was very informative, and I learned a great deal - watch it, you won't regret it!!!",1379030400,,4469,4.975871313672922
