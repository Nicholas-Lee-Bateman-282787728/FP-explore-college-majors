5263319,5,B0095HHLMO,"Despite getting these movies out of order what Jackson and his Wingnut team have pulled is the stuff of cinema legend.  The quality and themes remain true to Tolkien throughout the 6 picture epic.  In 40 fps 3D this is one magnificent theatrical experience.  The performances from Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman are stupendous and the FX are simply astounding.  I could feel that a little may have been trimmed from Smaug's Laketown rampage (it ends a little quickly) and their might be a little much of the bureacratic Alfred character, this film wraps things up brilliantly with a near perfect ending.  Making one want to go back to the start and watch FOTR again immediately.  For my money this is the greatest action movie ever made by one of the sharpest, wittiest and best directors ever, I suspect A. Sirkis is a budding talent from his 2nd unit work as well.  They explore the themes of technology, power, and greed and the impact they have on humanity in a poetic and thoughtful way, all within a grand entertainment.",1418774400,8,1031,4.726256983240224

______________________________________________

Its the third and last entry in The Hobbit series with The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies. The film is directed by Peter Jackson whos responsible for the original Lord Of The Rings series starting back in 2001. This time around we find Bilbo Baggins and his companions watch in horror as Smaug is awakened and is searching out to destroy Lake-town in the distance. But as terrifying as that seems their biggest battle lies ahead as news of Smaugs demise gets out leads to battles on four fronts as Ori and his army march towards the live mountain. And with Thorin not cooperating with Bilbo as armies march onwards to the gold held by Smaug, decisions must be made and lives will be lost.

Weve seen with the Lord Of The Rings series that things build up to the climactic ending or last film in the trilogy. Its seen here as a large majority of the movie is a battle that takes place as the dwarfs army stands up against a formidable opponent. The battle sequences were fun to watch even though it lasted for a good 90 minutes with a 220 minute runtime. You get to see so many aspects of the war by Bilbo, Thorin, Bard, Ori, and others. So much is riding on this war after the death of Smaug and personal interests get in the way of some of these characters that spells doom for some down the stretch.

From a technical standpoint the film was amazing to watch and was full of color that brought out even the simplest details on the castle and landscapes. The opening of the film as Smaug demolishes the Lake-town was gorgeous to watch and may have been the best looking scene in the movie. One of the best action sequences would have to have been the Orc army marching from the wormholes as they descended upon Thorin and the other armies. When the battle begins you couldn't help but think anyone would be outnumbered by the army forces. These films have never brought down the quality in how their films look and is no different with The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies.

As entertaining and fun the movie can be, there were times that I checked my watch on occasion as the non-stop battle began to wear on me. Its not to say I don't like a good action film but sometimes I felt the movie could have ended 30 minutes sooner. For a movie to stretch 2 and a half hours with just a large battle to anticipate your wondering what else can we expect? Or is that pretty much it? Again, it was entertaining to watch and had your attention but couldve added more story in the process. With so much material introduced in An Unexpected Journey many had wondered how the studio could stretch the series another two films. And as a result, you see that there was hardly much to cover left as were bombarded with countless action and less story.

Director Peter Jackson concludes his series with a satisfying end but not promising there could be more entries down the road. More surprising is how unfamiliar an audience can be with the Lord Of The Rings trilogy to understand and enjoy The Hobbit series even more. Jackson has been flawless in his work with his work and continues to amaze movie-goers into watching a fun and engaging experience.",1418774400,,3252,4.514431239388794
5263321,5,B0095HHLMO,"Just saw the movie last night, was beyond epic!!!  Tolkien purists turn up their noses at Jackson's expansion of the story from the original book, but isn't art about the artist interpreting life and yes other's art the way they see it?  Jackson has proven himself to be a master story teller and this final installment of his Hobbit trilogy only further reinforces his ability in that area. The movie oozes with meaning on many levels, just keep an open mind and rather than criticizing the liberties Jackson takes in expanding on the original book, simply enjoy his creation.
I won't be ordering this version, will wait until the 3D version is available, own the first two and they showcase the full potential of 3D, well worth what I paid for them!",1418774400,5,751,4.681818181818182
5263322,5,B0095HHLMO,"As it was the only time I have this week (opening week for The Battle of The Five Armies), on Monday I attended a Hobbit Marathon at the local cinema.  There were perhaps 2 dozen of us intrepid souls spending half of our day to watch the three Hobbit movies back to back.  Whereas the intended release date for the third installment is two days later, and then there were two nearby theaters which offered a single advance showing on the preceding Tuesday night.  As one of the couples nearby remarked, ""Aren't we privileged?""

Because J.R.R. Tolkien experienced the the repercussions of WWI and WWII during his lifetime, there is a sense of 'his' story which can't be separated from the Hobbit narrative, and also the Lord of the Rings.  I think this comes into play where Bilbo is sometimes overwhelmed with confusion at how to respond to the chaos erupting round about him.  Bilbo's disposition of the Arkenstone is a key factor in the plot of the book, and accordingly a crucial element of theatrical crisis resolution for the mental health of Thorin Oakenshield.  Thorin would have tossed Bilbo over the ramparts were it not for Gandalf's intervention.

As Bilbo is chronicled to be the only bearer of the one ring to ever walk away from it willingly, so his use of the evil talisman is of such an innocent nature as to win over even the wisest.  Which brings us to The White Witch of Caras Galathad (a.k.a. Lothlorien, the hidden land between the rivers Celebrant and Anduin), Galadriel, Lady of Light.  We can't really escape the internet chatter of the battle between the white council and the Dark Lord Sauron.  Not much of a spoiler here, yes, it's a big part of the rescue of Gandalf.  Remember, we left him hanging around in an iron cage at Dol Guldur in the second movie?

Instead of ruining it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, I'd rather share some background about Galadriel, the oldest of the Noldor elves still residing in Middle Earth.  Tolkien once described the elves as living simultaneously in two different realms.  To explore this idea in depth, you'd have to delve into the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silmarillion/dp/0618391118/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silmarillion</a>.  She's probably the only elf in Middle Earth who actually could remember walking with the Valar (creators) back in Valinor.  Valinor might loosely correspond to a dictionary definition of Aelfhiem in the Saxon mythology.  But the point of mentioning it here is prime the reader with the anticipation that, like the healing methods of the elves, Galadriel's 'magic' is also an extra-dimensional incursion of sorts.

To bring Tolkien's allegory down to the storybook level, his own  (Fellowship of the Ring) narrative on the encounter between Frodo and the Ring Wraiths at Weathertop doesn't include a timid Elisha Wood dropping his sword on the ground and fainting.  In the book, Frodo shouts aloud the Valar names, O' Elbereth, Glithoniel! and rushes the Nazgul, stabbing one of them in the foot.  He still has to be rescued.  But Gandalf later confides with him that invoking Elbereth (the Lady who places the stars), probably did greater damage than did Frodo's sword thrust.

The battles of ""Five Armies"" don't disappoint as a visual spectacle.  Because I watched an advance premier, there were greetings from Peter Jackson and the actor's team, which I mention because I really appreciate how this director and his writers have made the story their own as the video spectacle we get to watch.  A purist Hobbit movie wouldn't afford us the additional drama of Tauriel and the Elven King learning lessons on becoming 'human'.  It is only with greatest reluctance that Thranduil the King is dragged into being a friend of humans today.

A purist Hobbit movie wouldn't feature the epic battles with boss monsters Azog the Defiler, or Bolg the Orc champion.  They aren't Tolkien's creations.  But they add an iconic contrast to the heros of the story line.  They allow a passive viewer the opportunity to become much more involved in the crisis action entailed with Sauron and with the oath of Azog to destroy the line of Durin.  For those of us who are old enough to have watched the original animated Lord of the Rings (directed by Ralph Bakshi, produced by Saul Zaentz) You'll find a compelling facsimile of his Ring Wraiths making a dramatic CGI comeback for this concluding Hobbit movie.  Inveterate fan that I am, I thought it was pretty awesome.  Like each of it's prequels, The Battle of the Five Armies features ample surprises for viewers to enjoy over and over again. --BRAVO!!!",1418688000,31,4644,4.9650711513583445
5263363,2,B0095HHLMO,"A lot of people criticize the Hobbit trilogy for not being faithful to the book.  And, that's true.  A lot of people also use the quote from the Fellowship of the Rings that it's like ""sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.""  That's also true.  But there's a worse sin about this movie.

It's too long.  After hour two, I was losing interest.
Peter Jackson is the master of showing, not telling, things.  That doesn't happen here.  Thorin is supposedly being driven mad by the treasure; and it's not subtle in the least.  It's blatant, beat-you-over-the-head moments.

I truly enjoyed both Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the original Hobbit book.  But I haven't enjoyed ""The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies"", sad to say.",1528761600,,759,4.7615384615384615

5263383,2,B0095HHLMO,"If you are a fan of the original book The Hobbit, this is probably the best of the trillogy (of movies, not books). But its still not true to the original book. There are characters, events, and entire plot lines that do not exist in the book. Also, the original book would translate well into a movie with some action. But its not meant to be an action movie. This movie is obviously another tired example of the new genre of movies whos real purpose is to sell the video games to be released under the same name. If you want to see a movie thst takes the classic book and turns it into an action film where every character is a martial arts swordmaster like in a video game, changes the plot, and adds characters, then this is your movie.",1526688000,,740,4.25531914893617

I think the actors in this movie spent more time in audio booths recording voice overs than on a sound stage or on location interacting with one another. In addition, the story is garbled, the dialogue is forced, and the characters are flat and poorly developed. It feels like the director and producers of this film didn't care about it and phoned it in, knowing that Tolkien and the prior success of the LOTR trilogy would draw an audience despite the poor product.",1516492800,,531,4.6

5263613,4,B0095HHLMO,"Since first being released in the 1950s, books have been filled with how these stories and characters have influenced and reflected the culture. Bilbo Baggins and his plight, although timeless remains poignant to the state of the current world in his confusion at the cause of war. In the last 13 years, the globe has continued to watch violence sporadically spread through governments in the Middle East, attack parts of Europe, and inspire random killings in the United States. Mere months after the 9/11 attacks, the release of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring presented a clear moral tale of good vs. evil. Yet now at the finale of the saga (despite it being a prequel), do we not share in the bewilderment and plea along with Bilbo to avoid violence? An evil rises only for the conquest of domination - an ironic similarity to the current out-pour of violence. Will there ever be a united effort between the Elves and Dwarfs? Despite the overt use of CGI, in all fairness the merit of the sixth installment rides in on the power of the previous five films; it's what fans asked for since 2003.",1514419200,,1115,4.636363636363637

5263673,4,B0095HHLMO,"Surprisingly so I enjoyed ""The Battle of The Five Mountain."" I must say after seeing the first of this overly long Trilogy and them purchasing the second of the three, it has only been now that I have seen the third. The delay being primarily because of my disappointment with the first two. In Peter Jackson's endeavor to turn ""The Hobbit"" into an overly long 9 hour Trilogy,  so much extraneous blather had been added that I was so very much disappointed. Disappointed at the the flippant disrespect of Tolkien's work. After having read The Hobbit"" and the Lord Of The Rings""  more times that I can count in over the last half century, there were parts throughout these three movies that were spot on, right from the book. There was also so very, very many parts including those ridiculous amusement park ride chase scenes that were as I said, ridiculous.
I understand that such silly stuff was added for those who have never read the books and those who never will,  at the expense of the stories.

The good thing is that the books won't be effected by the films.

I have read that there have been private endeavors to edit, to rid the three movies of the added blather, the inane ballast that have come out with an excellent four hour movie.",1511136000,,1245,4.540178571428571

5263781,1,B0095HHLMO,"I haven't watched the movie, but this review is geared toward Amazon's ridiculous (new) policy of restricting downloads.  We just moved to a new house with no internet yet, and wanted to watch this movie.  So i purchased it on amazon thinking I could download it and watch it offline (since I theoretically owned it)... NOPE!  Can't download it to a PC, Amazon killed unbox, and unless my wife and I want to huddle around my phone for nearly 3 hours, surrounded by a quiet surround sound system that cannot interface with my tiny phone screen, I cannot watch the movie.  I will never buy an Amazon digital movie again.",1503360000,,618,4.590909090909091

5263783,3,B0095HHLMO,"a little too cheesy and centered around the  battles of  greed instead of freedom; heroism seems to only appear when there's money involved.  Though the special effects were phenomenal, i personally  would have liked to see more of the story's focus gone to the freedom lost, for example, the sorrow of the skin  changers, rather than the majority of it being everybody fighting over  stupid pieces of metal and stone.",1503187200,,418,4.9

5263790,3,B0095HHLMO,"Over all a ok movie. It has entertainment value, however as a person who has read the book and seen the three Hobbit movies they should have been one movie. So many extras and fillers with gross creative license to stretch this one small book into three movie epics is too much! So many extra scenes in this that are way beyond the story giving to much connection to the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. It's silly. The only connection intended between the two is the ring, and part of the mystery that is spoiled is that the mystery of the ring is blatantly revealed in the Hobbit movies. The whole point of the Next stories is to learn about the ring, and how it is the thing that everything centers on. The whole idea and point of the Hobbit is the discovery and mystery of the ring. That was Tolkien's intention. The director, producers, and scrip writer's completely blew it. That being said, if you are new to these stories you will enjoy it.",1502409600,,942,4.388571428571429

I honestly didn't think they were going to be as good as Lord of the Rings, but obviously, I was mistaken. I've always admired how realistic and captivating Peter Jackson displays his battle scenes in these movies, and The Battle of the Five Armies was an amazing portrayal of war. I usually don't do well with gore, but I was fine with this kind of action. The emotion and passion in this movie was outstanding.

5264071,4,B0095HHLMO,"After a long, tedious and not-so-unexpected journey, we have finally reached the end destination. The Battle of the Five Armies is the concluding film in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy. It's the most LOTR-like of the three Bilbo flicks, LOTR as in Jackson's interpretation of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

It has all the ingredients which made some of us like LOTR back in the days: monsters, Orc armies, amazing special effects, yuge battles and one Gandalf. Essentially, it's LOTR all over again, while the two previous films in the Bilbo cycle felt more like a prologue to the inevitable Battle to End All Battles. The biggest disappointment was that Sauron was dispensed with pretty quickly by Wizards & Elves United in a single scene.

We also learn that Thandruil rides an Irish Elk, that Hobbits auction off the belongings of somebody who has been missing more than six months, and that Azog the Defiler (the Orc leader) is White! Still, that *is* logical, since at least one faction of the Orcs in Tolkien's original story symbolizes the SS Once again, the Ents have been excluded from the drama, thank Illvatar.

I'm not really sure how to rate this Jacksonite extravaganza, but in the end, I will graciously give it four stars  in return for *my* part of the treasure, of course!",1487721600,,1297,4.802690582959642
5264082,3,B0095HHLMO,"Goblins, dwarves, men, elves, and others converge on the Lonely Mountain to make war, with the hobbit Bilbo Baggins caught in the middle.

Peter Jackson and company really should have stuck with their original plan to make two movies from The Hobbit.  I loved The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but the source material was so rich and lengthy that even the extended version felt justified.  Not so this time.  This trilogy is full of action scenes that have been inflated to bloat the running time, and the final film is the most egregious example.  The fall of Smaug and the final battle would have made a fine climax to a film, but they account for nearly the entire running time here.  Still, terrific moments occur throughout.  Ian McKellen is always wonderful as Gandalf, and Martin Freeman was the ideal choice for Bilbo.  His farewell to the dwarves is quite a touching scene.  I would like to see Jackson go the opposite route from his extended edition of the Rings trilogy and whittle the Hobbit down to a leaner, more focused version.  That could be a very good movie.",1487548800,,1074,4.634920634920635

5264120,4,B0095HHLMO,"We have finally reached the end of the journey to the cinematic Middle Earth. While this second trilogy came with a lot of controversy (particularly the three film split), I for one was happy with the outcome. The Hobbit is my favorite book of all time and for the purposes of film making I was happy with how this was represented. While I do agree that splitting such a small book into three films with some added fan fiction was a bit long winded. I feel that this shouldn't have been done any other way.

In 'The Battle of The Five Armies' we get to see more of the detail of the battle which we really don't tackle much in the book itself as well as some of the back story into Angmar which I enjoyed. I also loved seeing Billy Connolly as Dane. I thought he was very funny. The film also had a lot more emotion than I thought it would and I loved how the ending takes us right into the The Lord of The Rings. With the style that this new trilogy was done, it actually makes more sense to watch The Lord of The Rings before you tackle The Hobbit.

Peter Jackson truly did this legendary work justice. Tolkien's work was a true labor of love for the material and cinema and I am very happy to have experienced it all.",1486598400,,1220,4.165254237288136

5264207,5,B0095HHLMO,"Professor Tolkien wrote that one of the greatest problems with drama critics is they are so dramatic.  Many critics approached the three 'Hobbit' movies by assessing how they stacked up against 'The Lord of the Rings' movie trilogy, rather than how effectively they present the story of 'The Hobbit'.  Reviews of 'An Unexpected Journey' commented on the return to Bag End or the visit to Rivendell or the appearance of Sting as some obligatory nod to the 'Rings' trilogy instead of a filming of an incident from the pages of 'The Hobbit'.  I was rather frustrated at the observations about Sting because its appearance is one of my favorite scenes from the book, and I thought the event was presented beautifully in the movie.  In his essay, 'On Fairy-Stories', Professor Tolkien has now explained to me that those who observe and critique drama probably are not the people who read and enjoy books, so now the remarks of the critics makes perfect sense: they would be comparing the movies rather than wasting their time reading the dull book.  Such is to be expected.

Many flaws are pointed out in the development of the 'Hobbit' trilogy as stated by a variety of critics.  There is too much cgi work in the films.  I wouldnt notice if you didn't point that fact out.  The scene of the dwarves visit with Bilbo at Bag End was much too long.  It is a long and detailed scene, one of the most detailed in the book.  I cant believe the hobbit fell forever in the goblin cave and was unhurt.  That simply defies physics and ruined the entire story for me.  This is a tale about three-foot-tall hobbits and four-foot-tall dwarves and a wizard and some elves, with orcs, trolls and a dragon tossed in and you're going to cite the laws of physics as a requirement for the story?  Perhaps you should read Tolkeins remarks on the relationship of science to fairy stories.  The little thin childrens book did not need to be stretched into three LONG films.  At nearly 300 pages with action occurring over a 14-month period, and with very little conversation between characters to pad out the story, it is not such a thin book and just what scenes should be cut?  Legolas was not in The Hobbit.  He wasn't in 'The Hobbit' but he must have been somewhere in Mirkwood at the time.  There was no female elf in The Hobbit.  That is a good point.

We come then to 'The Battle of the Five Armies' which seemed to draw a thumbs-down from critics across the board.  Why?  Were the storytellers supposed to simply kill off the dragon at the end of 'The Desolation of Smaug' and end the story?  Ah, but the little childrens book does not end with the death of the dragon.  In fact, Smaugs death is more of a secondary detail of the story.  The dwarves do enjoy a few days of peace after the dragon disappears and then those who hope to gain a share of the great treasure said to be buried under the mountain start to gather.  And they don't simply gather to bring food or to collect family heirlooms or to demand an owed debt.  The peoples in the book are not so noble.  They're ultimately on a treasure hunt.

The battle itself is disjointed in the film because it is a massive battle, covering lots of terrain, several armies and several characters.  Tolkien handles much of the battle by having his observer, Bilbo Baggins, pass out and once he recovers the highlights of the battle are told to him and to the reader.  Thereby, Tolkien simply passes over this great battle without bogging himself down in the telling.  That same device in used in the movie and may be part of the disappointment for viewers because we don't really see the tide turn in the battle to the favor of the dwarves and their allies.  'The Battle of the Five Armies' dwindles into single combat, after which Bilbo passes out and does not see the turning of the battle, because he has lost his friend and for him the battle has ended and he can see no victory.

A large portion of this third movie is indeed owned by the character of Thorin Oakenshield.  Tolkien is said to have watched Shakespeares 'Macbeth' when a boy and came away greatly disappointed by the dramatist and his play.  The idea of an entire wood moving inspired Tolkiens imagination and he was dissatisfied to learn it was an illusion.  (So was I.)  At the end of the play MacBeth sits on his throne with all of his goals and ambitions achieved, his friends destroyed, and his one desire is to hold on to what he has accomplished.  Thorin Oakenshield is a heroic MacBeth in this movie, and very much so in the book.  Like Macbeth, Thorin only enjoys his crown briefly before he is confronted by an army on his doorstep.  Such a swift approach by an army demanding immediate rewards from the new dwarf king was not the best approach of the local welcoming committee.  Like MacBeth, Thorins victory is soon tarnished by the cares of the everyday world, and like any warrior king his heroic exploits are soon forgotten by those who demand simple things like food and shelter, or critics who want either another 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy or an animated Seven Dwarfs without Snow White and her whiny step-mother story.  Spoiler alert for the book: the story of the Hobbit is not another 'Lord of the Rings' or a Frog Prince story.  Its more of a heroic MacBeth than anything else.  Even as Thorin struggles to come to terms with the changes that have come to his life there is a call to battle again, and he must decide if he will sit by unmoved or if he will stand to fight a battle that could magnify his greatness as a king.

'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' are two volumes written by the same author but as works of literature they are very different.  'The Lord of the Rings' centers on the activities of nine different characters who are all motivated by the same goal: they need to take the ring to Mount Doom and throw it into the fire.  No matter what each character is doing in the story or what hardships they face, they are all pursuing that common goal even if their efforts take them along different paths.  'The Hobbit' follows the adventures of fifteen different characters who need to take a fortune in gold which belonged to the forefathers of the dwarves away from a very big and very nasty dragon.  To do this the group must work together as a team as much as possible.  Tossing a ring into a lava flow is not the same as taking a treasure away from a possessive fire-breathing dragon.  How could one story be expected to reflect the other in any way, either in a book or a movie?

The only characters central to both books are Bilbo the hobbit, Gandalf the wizard and Elrond the elf.  In The 'Lord of the Rings' Frodo takes Bilbos place, in part because Tolkiens publishers were asking for a sequel to 'The Hobbit'.  Gandalf and Elrond appear in both stories as themselves.  The son of the elf-king and a son of the dwarves are included in 'Rings' to represent those two peoples in the Fellowship.  Gandalf explained he could not find a Warrior-Hero to go on the quest for the dragon, but two Warrior-Heros appear in The 'Lord of the Rings', in the persons of Aragorn and Boromir.  While Aragorn becomes the Warrior-Hero of 'Lord of the Rings' he is not in any way reflective of Bilbo or Thorin.  Aragorn has promised to help destroy the ring.  His ascension as King of Gondor comes as a result of his effort.  Thorin is striving to recover his crown as King Under the Mountain by destroying the dragon.  That Thorin makes one of the greatest sacrifices in the quest to destroy the ring is no part of his goal or efforts.

The character who most echoes Aragorn in 'The Hobbit' is Bard, but Bard does not appear in the book until he shoots the dragon, and that fame leads him to take part in the advance of Men and Elves on the newly crowned King Under the Mountain.  The movies have him appears a little earlier in the story erasing the vague entrance he makes in the book.

Elronds counterpart is the King of the Woodland realm and no matter what any critic thinks, the elf-king is perfect in this movie.  He is just as cold and unforgiving as the elf-king can be, and the complete opposite of Lord Elrond.  He does not appear in the first chapters of the book but interferes with the quest of the dwarves later in the story.

And no, the story is not always told from Bilbos viewpoint.  Unlike the movie version, Bilbo and the dwarves do not know Smaugs dreadful fate for several days.  A narrator steps forward to explain to the reader the details of what happened to Smaug and the residents of Laketown.
The movies generally follow the plot of the book and part of the reason critics find flaws in the movie is because there are flaws in the book itself.  From the first appearance of 'The Hobbit' the major criticism was the fact the story is an array of short stories loosely strung together in a vague plot.  The dinner table scene at Bag End does go on for a long time.  Gollum does make only one appearance in the story and then vanishes.  Maybe the story should have ended with the death of the dragon, but then the death of the dragon really is not the climax of the story.  The climax of the story is Bilbos parting from his friend, Thorin.  Maybe critics need to stop being critical and just enjoy the story.

However, there is that problem with the elves in these movies, and its a big one.  The script writers seem to have taken every detail they knew about Tolkiens elven race, locked it in a small chest and put that chest deep in the pot under the goblin-kings throne.  The elves are described by Tolkien as enjoying music, poetry and feasting.  In 'The Hobbit', Bilbo and his companions first become aware of the Wood Elves when they hear the music of their gathering and smell the food they are preparing.  It is such a beautiful image in the book and I was looking forward to how this scene would be presented.  It would seem the beauty of elvish custom was tossed into the chest.  They did not appear as a people enjoying a nice woodland picnic; instead they enter like some sort of ninja warriors with plenty of arrows to waste.  They don't enjoy music and poetry, they enjoy fighting.

The elf-king is not angry that his feast has been interrupted.  Hes just angry.  And there's no nod given to his history, his origins.  Most blogs and notes on the Internet state he proclaimed himself king of the Wood Elves.  He did not proclaim himself.  He was chosen and he was chosen for a reason.  The qualities that brought about that choice are not brought to light in these movies.  Somehow this elfin-king is an isolationist who is only concerned with events in his own realm.  One is left to wonder: what realm is he supposed to concern himself with?  His son appears, not as the adventurous elf of the Ring movies, but a mirror image of his father, without glee or charm.  He might be Legolas sixty years after the events of The Ring and not sixty years before.

Then we have Tauriel, an elf who must be a part of the Kings household guard.  Just what her role in the court of the elf-king might be is never clearly established.  She is there after all to appeal to young girls in the audience, or maybe young boys.  Supposedly a woodland elf who has never venture outside her kings realm, she is wise and all-knowing about events beyond her experience and is so much wiser than her king whom we know to be a veteran of at least a couple of major battles in the Wars against the Dark Lord and therefore quite knowledgeable about Sauron and his powers.

Tauriel, our elf-maiden, hears that the cute dwarf, Kili, has been stabbed by a morgul blade and she dashes out of the court to follow him.  Just how she would know what a morgul blade would be is a matter for Tolkien to decipher, however when she does arrive at the house where Kili lies ill, she seems confused that he is hurt and has brought no medicine to cure him.  Not a very organized elf-maiden, I fear.

Then, when she cures him, she quotes the same chant that Arwen used as first-aid for Frodo in 'The Fellowship'.  How does a woodland elf know a chant used by a highborn lady of the Noldor?  And Arwens chant only served as a quick fix.  Frodo had to be treated by the skills of Lord Elrond in order to survive.  In 'The Fellowship' this seemed to be quite a feat but it must have been no big deal because a wood elf could perform both parts of the treatment herself to astounding success.  It is simply laziness on the part of the writers.  Arwen did give her grace to Frodo, as she states later in the book, 'The Return of the King'.  Tauriel has wasted her skills on the doomed Kili, a fact one would think she would have realized if she had indeed gone out of the realm of Middle-Earth and into the Light while bringing about his care.

The writers seem to have forgotten another important point about the elves: they can be killed by weapons or grief.  They really cant be moping about the cave, sulking over lost love or a difficult parent.  They love poetry and music.  Heavy emotions weigh them down.  The wife of the elven-king is not mentioned in 'The Hobbit' but she would probably not make an appearance to greet lowly dwarf prisoners of her husband-king.  If she did appear, she would be demanding the head of the dwarf because he ruined her woodland dinner party on three different occasions.  The fact she is not mentioned indicates she is there around the cave somewhere.

The history of Middle Earth contains the story of Lord Elronds wife and her fate explained.  Elrond does not speak of her or dwell on her loss because he knows where she is.  The writers seem to have taken her fate and somehow set it on the unmentioned wife of the elven-king.  If there was a gift of jewelry for his lady in the dragons horde, the elven-king would be going after it to give to her and not sitting around brooding because shes dead.  Elves are immortal.  Even if they die in Middle-Earth, they do not die a mortal death.  Therefore, the elf-king would not be mopping over her death.

Then there is the final scene of the three of them on the hill after the battle.  The King Under the Mountain has just given the greatest sacrifice any king could make for his allies, but we have to cut away from his great tragedy to view the elfin trio in a charming little scene which could have been lifted from the television series, 'Dynasty'.  Tauriel is sobbing with heartbroken grief.  OK, just hold that shot.  From what we know about Tolkiens elves she will now succumb to grief and go oversea.  The burden will be too great for her and she cannot remain in Middle-Earth.  (It would have been better for their plot if she had been killed in battle.)  The elf-king realizes he has been grief-stricken and so caught up in his own worries that he has been a poor father-figure to his son.  Hold that shot.  Maybe this could be a back-story for Dain or the Mayor of the Town.  It will not work for the elfin-king because if he was so burdened he would have one choice.  See above for that choice.

And then there is Legolas, pouting about like the scorned lover.  If he is such a great warrior shouldnt he be honoring the great warrior-king, or does elf-respect look like pouting? The story of how Legolas got to Rivendell where he happened to arrive for the Council of Elrond is completely ignored in these movies and yet it is vital to the destruction of the Ring.  If Legolas goes wandering off into the wilds now in search of a ten-year-old Aragorn who is in fact at this point living in the house of Lord Elrond (and young Aragorn was not brought out to meet the visiting dwarves, or at least we are not told if he was), then Legolas will not be in Mirkwood later on to accomplish certain tasks and the Ring will not be destroyed yet again.  This entire elf tale was poorly visualized and distracts from the greater story instead of enhancing it.  A few tweaks could have made Tauriel a wonderful and viable part of the movie, but instead she is a terrible distraction to the story and to the personality of the elves.

I had read the book, watch the theatrical versions of the movies, the extended versions, and all the hours and hours of appendices material, yet it was after all of that and when I was reading a blog on a website that I finally understood that Fili and Kili were Thorins sister-sons and that Fili was the heir.  While Tolkien describes the pair as always together, he does not mention until the closing paragraphs of the book that they are indeed Thorins nephews, and regarded by him as his heirs.  The relationship is revealed a little earlier in 'The Desolation of Smaug', rescuing the detail from being an Oh, by the way point at the end of the story.  Not in any of these movies is there any hint that Fili is the elder (even Tolkien describes him as the younger several times in the book and only explains that he is indeed the elder of the brothers in the appendices of 'The Lord of the Rings').  In fact, all indications in the movies seem to be that Fili is the younger.  Thorin never speaks to him, never notices him.  All his attention, all of his remarks are directed to Kili.  Even when they are caught in the battle of the thunder giants and Fili is separated from them, Thorin screams for Kili when it is clearly Fili who is among the dwarves who crashed on the mountainside.  Only when they are in the house of Beron do we see the pair seated together and looking at each other with any understanding.  And when they come into the treasure cave, Thorin tosses a piece of the gold to Fili, but it might have only been a lucky catch on Filis part.  A study of their dress indicates Fili has a fur collar on his jacket to match Thorins but other of the dwarves wear fur collars so this is not any distinction, and it is canceled out by the fact that Kilis jacket matches Thorins in color.

As they are preparing to leave Laketown, Fili wants to stay with his wounded brother and Thorin says to him, You cant stay here.  You could be king.  Since there is no criteria to establish Fili as the heir, what could have been a monumental scene between the two is simply annoying.  Thorin sounds as if he is saying, Well, your brothers going to die and you had better just come on with us as this means you're going to be king, suggesting that Thorin thinks Kilis condition is hopeless and he'll now have to made do with Fili as an heir.  Therefore, we instantly agree with Fili that his place is with his brother, and not with his moody uncle.  (The writers of movie scripts do see moody as adding depth in a character, don't they?)  In truth, Thorin is saying to Fili, I could die and then you would have to step up and take my place.  I could die is quite a different statement from Your brother is dying anyway and now we realize Fili is here all in a moment faced with choosing between the two of them.  He owes allegiance to his uncle and king, but he is also bound to his brother and when he chooses one he may never see the other again.  It is an emotional moment for the three of them and its totally wasted because there is no clear relationship established among the three.  Surely, in this jewel-conscious world, there was some token, a ring or a brooch given to Fili to show his status.  Would his culture not have expected that?

Perhaps a weakness of these movies is that Thorins company is presented too perfectly.  They function as a wonderful group for the first two movies, therefore when they are separated by circumstances at the end of the second move, there is a mood and a tempo that is never regained throughout the rest of the story.  In the book Kili is not wounded by an arrow, and he and Fili have an active part of the adventures at the hidden door.  After the dragon disappears there is a lull in the action of the story as the group of dwarves, along with Bilbo, explore Erebor together.  In the movie, 'The Desolation of Smaug', when part of the group is left behind at Lake Town the viewer is too overwhelmed with anger at Thorin for his choice, resentful at Tauriel for interrupting the flow of the story and annoyed at the other dwarves for carrying on as if all is normal.  This anger robs the impact of the events at the secret door, dims the interest in the exchange with the dragon and causes us to lose faith and concern for Thorin.  When he falls into his malaise in the third movie the viewer feels its only his just reward and there is not enough time for us to gain back our faith and trust for him to care about what happens to him.  The Fellowship of the dwarves, if you will, falls apart and the viewer is lost and wandering on a bleak landscape where random scenes are playing on the screen and they make little sense because we have lost the main plot of our story.  Again the writers are too lazy to maintain their plot and the viewer is served a number of easy clichs instead of a continuation of the mood and tempo created in earlier scenes.

In the book Thorin and his followers make a supreme effort to drive the dragon away and take back the Lonely Mountain but neither Thorin nor his followers enjoy any reward for their efforts.  Tolkien introduces the characters of Bard and Dain in the last few pages of the book and in a matter of a couple sentences makes them the main characters of the tale.  Bard is the descendent of the king of Dale but do we know or care that Dale had a king?  Dain was king of the dwarves in the Iron Hills.  While at the beginning of 'An Unexpected Journey' we are told his ambassador refused to take any part in the march to Erebor, now suddenly Dain is moving to the Lonely Mountain and taking over the place.  What about the dwarves who came on the journey with Thorin?  They simply get written out of the story after all their efforts. In the book Balin does visit Bilbo years later and Bilbo does notice that he is richly dressed but his dress could be because he is a relative of the king, and not a sign of his status as one of the Heroes of Erebor.  If each of Thorins companions received one fourteenth of the treasure in the Mountain, did each one get to keep his share after Dain ascended the throne?  Did Dain receive the shares belonging to Fili and Kili since he was their close relative?  Bilbo took the Arkenstone as his share and gave it to the people of Laketown.  After the battle the people of the town returned the stone to Thorin and received Bilbos share of the gold.  That detail would suggest the other dwarves received their just share of the wealth but it is another detail we are left to ponder over because there is no indication of how the matter was settled within the pages of the book, making that omittance another flaw in the source story.

Again, this plot device of suddenly removing the characters of the story and replacing them in the last few scenes of the book and the movie is similar to the ending of 'Macbeth'.  Characters who made a brief appearance at the start of the story return as the victors in the end, displacing the cruel MacBeth and his wife as the major characters in the story.  As MacBeth is a tragic hero his displacement is applauded.  As Thorin in a heroic hero we are displeased at his removal and resent the new hero, Dain.  Perhaps such a reaction is why there are fewer heroic heroes than tragic ones.
.
Many of the so-called flaws of these movies are in fact details that are lifted right out of what is called a simple little childrens book.  In the end what Bilbo is really telling is the story of Thorin and Thorins quest to be a good king to his followers.  Thorin pays a great price to stop Saurons growing powers and deals the Dark Lord a blow from which he will not recover, but that sacrifice is not completely understood until the end of 'The Lord of the Rings'.  Somehow that sacrifice is lost in these movies.  In the theatrical cut of 'The Battle of the Five Armies', Thorins body is left on the battlefield and there is little bother of any kind of a ceremony.  That omittance just goes to show that a dead hero is a forgotten hero.

Two minor details in the plotting of these movies bother me.  First, Tolkien describes Thorin as dignified.  Why would a dignified and kingly dwarf allow and even encourage his followers to indulge in a food fight while guests at Lord Elronds table after Elrond had just allowed Thorin to retain Orcrist, the sword of the king of Gondolin?  Surely Elrond could have laid claim to his own grandfathers sword and Thorin would have had to agree.  Second, in the confrontation between Thorin and Thranduil, Thranduil implies he was in battles with the Balrogs by suddenly displaying burned flesh on his face.  Yet if details of the 'Lost Tales' are considered, it is Legalos and not Thranduil who is named as being in the final battle of Gondolin when the balrogs attack.  The Legolas of the Tales, who shares some traits with the Prince of Mirkwood, comes forward to aid the escape of women and children from the destroyed city and are soon pursued by balrogs.  Legolas leaves the party after the threat of the balrogs pass and fades into the forest.

There is an underlying disrespect for warriors and for those who fall in defense of their homes and followers in these 'Hobbit' movies that cannot be explained away with the excuse this is a childrens story.  A major part of the plot of this story has to do with a warrior who along with his close family members, falls in defense of his people.  Indeed, that is a great part of the appeal of the story for young audiences.  Yet this sacrifice is lost in the worrisome details of a dysfunctional elf family's emoting.

We are left with a king who came into his power on the first days of winter, a Winter King if you will, who dies a few days later and is left slumbering under the mountain with the light of promise in his hands.  The new year will come with all its potential and promise.  In the book Thorin remarks that he would like to take on the Necromancer, and Gandalf replies that he should concentrate on reaching the Lonely Mountain for he is not strong enough to win against the Necromancer, and yet events will prove otherwise.  The best line in 'The Battle of the Five Armies' comes when Bilbo explains Thorin was his friend.  He is a powerful friend to have.  When you watch these 'Hobbit' movies, remember, this is really Thorins storyBilbo is the narratorso ignore the Dynasty scenes and other distractions and listen to Thorins story.  It is the one Tolkien wanted to tell.

In the book, 'The Hobbit', when the company arrives at Rivendell Tolkien as narrator comments: things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway.  He more than any other viewer might understand why the evenings camping quietly on the western slopes of the Misty Mountains, the gentle days resting in Rivendell, the feasting of the elves in the Woodland realm, has been replaced by those endless chase scenes and running battles.  At least in these movies they only lose one set of ponies and notis it four sets?---I always lose count.  So, a note to critics: if you cant stand these movies, you probably don't want to read the book.  The law of physics is not the decree of the land there either.",1485302400,,27387,4.41195219123506

5264209,5,B0095HHLMO,"Ah, the final part of the Hobbit trilogy. It is also the shortest Extended version of the three movies (An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug) but the 20 minutes extra running time are once again edited so perfectly into the movie that you sometimes notice that something has been added.

The Battle of the Five Armies again takes a lot of liberty in the adaptation of the book to the screen. Which - once again - might upset the story purists but that has been done well. The story-line wraps up nicely and by the end of the 2 hours and 43 minutes you can roll right on through watching all the Lord of the Rings movies.

But, there is also a little bit of the problem that I had with this movie. There clearly has been the idea with the studios to outdo the Lord of the Ring in scale. Which makes no real sense. The Lord of the Rings is the build-up to where the world goes to war. But somehow, the war that we get in The Battle of the Five Armies features armies that look larger than even the battle at Gondor, and they dwarf the armies of the Orcs and the Uruks for Helm's Deep in The Two Towers.
And it does look awesome once again, but because of this, I would advise for a week or so between to sit-throughs of both trilogy; simply not to compare them to each other in too much detail.

Just like the book, this final part of the trilogy is far less a fantasy movie but rather a war movie. It is a great movie, but - just like the book (again) - it feels a bit like an sequel-story building upon the fantasy story that covers the first two movies. I think Peter Jackson did very well to have ended the 'Desolation of Smaug' where it did, and bring the rest of that part of the book to this last movie to not make it a huge difference in movie styles.

The acting is great again, the action sequences are beautifully filmed, and there is again a lot of stunning scenery to be enjoyed. The extra 20 minutes exists mainly of a lot of extra - fantastic - gorey shots during the war. You want to know the 10 best ways to kill an Orc? Well, this is the movie for you.

5264268,1,B0095HHLMO,"Appallingly bad and tedious. Each Hobbit film has gotten worse, and the first one was mediocre at best, charitably. The second seemed interminable but there is a new champ here, the Battle of the Five Hours (or so it seems).  There's precious little of Tolkien in it, Bilbo himself is a bit player, and the battle hijinks run the gamut of savage bloodthirstiness to terribly unfunny comic relief to ever-more physics-defying CGI work (especially whenever Legolas is onscreen) that goes on and on and on and on....  the R rating for ""some violence"" is the understatement of the year, this movie is practically non-stop  carnage in various cartoonishly over-the-top varieties.

Does anyone know how to craft an action sequence anymore, or a major battle, that doesn't  have the look and feel of a video game? They aren't even assembled very well. Jackson has wholly lost his way as an action choreographer and the constant cuts and jumps between sequences and locations destroy any sense of rhythm or plot.  You always know when something portentous is about to occur because the music goes into hyper-drama mode and events slow down and the old slo-mo camera holds the shot so every last-minute rescue can be savored and every anguished ""NNNoooooOOOOOoooooo!!!!"" can be admired.  Seldom has dialogue as trite and pretentious as in this movie been offered up in seriousness.  Could the Elves speak any slower on Prozac?

Smaug is wonderful, and the great dragon is finally free of the asinine Rube Goldberg/Wil. E. Coyote gags he was subjected to in the second film of this sad-sack trilogy,  but he's killed within minutes of the start and that only leaves 2 1/2 hours as filler. A few good minutes of Galadriel showing her moxie at Dol Guldur is the only time I cared about any of this mess except the final end credits, I was even gladder to see those.

I can't believe anyone could spend so much money and effort and make Tolkien's classic adventure story so dull and take it so far from what the author wrote and intended.  Shameful.  Pete Jackson obviously and sadly succumbed to his own Dragon-Sickness long ago, or his Precious has eaten away his mind.

5264445,5,B0095HHLMO,"I really enjoyed this! Having read other reviews, I was expecting something that was overly long, boring, and over-dramatized. But I actually really appreciated pretty much everything. It's been a while since I read The Hobbit, so I was rusty on the details (this may have helped me enjoy the movie more), but I have also read The Silmarillion, and it was great to see a little of that here. I also appreciate the stuff they added to the Elven storylines that tie in with The Lord of the Rings, even though that was pretty much surmised/invented rather than coming from any of the books directly. Maybe purists don't like that, but as a fan of the Peter Jackson movies, I thought it was great in and of itself, regardless of what the books say.

At the end, I was left wanting to watch The Lord of the Rings again, but wishing that I could see this Bilbo again. Martin Freeman's Bilbo has such an honesty and levity about him that that this movie (and The Hobbit trilogy overall) helps to show how a simple folk could be so difficult to corrupt as to be the only ones truly capable of taking on the task in the LOTR trilogy.

Did we need 7 full hours of movie to tell the story of The Hobbit? Maybe not, but I personally would have loved even more.",1483315200,,1248,4.329059829059829

5264462,2,B0095HHLMO,"This movie can't stop being aware that it's a movie long enough to be good.  I'm glad I didn't watch it in theaters; I would have felt like a captive audience to this seemingly endless mess.  Since I'm watching it at home, I can turn it off 2/3's of the way through and leave.  I'm not sure making the trilogy into just one or two movies would have fixed this, but it would have at least made it less painful to sit through.

The problem with this movie is that it knows it's a movie, and who the main characters are.  It's like movies where the main character runs through a crowd of fleeing, panicky people searching for their loved ones (and yes, that happens here, at least twice) and no one ever knocks them down, answers their call because they have the same name, or shouts over them for their loved ones, like would happen in real life.  But in movies these scenes happen too fast for you to realize no panicked crowd has ever acted like that.  This move does that sort of thing for its entire runtime.  I kid you not, there is a scene in the chaotic battle where two dwarves run to each other, screaming, then spend several seconds hugging and making jokes, and you can see they are in the center of a clear space that the rampaging orcs are politely keeping free for them so they don't interfere with the witty banter.  And later, when one of the main dwarves dies, it's this long, drawn-out scene where the killer makes a speech to drive home that this death is important, unlike all those side characters we just saw die much braver deaths. That was when I got tired and turned the movie off.  And when Thorin fights with the dragon-sickness in his heart, and it shows him drowning in gold?  It's okay, movie, we didn't need the symbolism, we kinda realized he was losing it when he threatened all his friends.

It's sad because I loved reading The Hobbit, I actually liked that book much better than The Lord of the Rings books.  The Hobbit was charming and folksy, especially because it was told through the viewpoint of a soft-hearted, lazy, but ultimately very kind hobbit.  This movie dropped all the charm and tried to fill it with over-the-top cgi that was actually pretty terrible, and made sure to pause the action whenever something, gasp, important was happening.  At least the characterizations were right, we just needed the movie itself to relax and let us watch them instead of screaming 'Notice this!' every five minutes.",1483228800,4,2449,4.509049773755656

5264772,3,B0095HHLMO,"The most positive comment that can be made is that this is the version of The Battle of the Five Armies to watch. Unfortunately, the movie itself does not meet the high quality of the first two Hobbit movies. I'm not a Tolkien purist or a hardcore fan of fantasy. My criticisms of the film are mostly poor choices in general categories:

1. Overloaded story.

Too many characters with too many subplots weakening the main plot and in fact leaving it incomplete. Each subplot could have been made into a movie. Each subplot had to be compromised and failed to integrate with the main plot.

Suggested fix:
Instead of six movies (beginning with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) the story could have been delivered in about 10. This last installment begged to be split into 2 or 3 movies--all would still be able to push run time maximums. Jackson should have pushed for. Surely by this point in his career and the Tolkien franchise, Peter Jackson could have pushed for a change in how the story was delivered.

2. Undue emphasis on ""dragon sickness""

In an attempt to force a main plot into existence, the writers amplified the runaway greed and hording afflicting Thror aka ""Dragon Sickness"". It is a strange, poorly developed characteristic that exceeds the ability of the viewer to relate with. The demise of Thror could have been the same with far less focus on the cause.

Fix: Instead of several long interactions with multiple characters where Thror's dragon sickness turns him on everyone, a couple short scenes would have sufficed. The time saved could then have been put into say, Dain coming in and taking over the throne with protections against falling prey to dragon sickness. This would have also completed one of the incomplete subplots of the Iron Hills dwarves.

3. CGI battle scenes ad nauseam lacking any plot contribution

The battle was like watching a fireworks show that consists of equally spectacular finales in succession without a break, transition, crescendo or any other contrasting dynamic. Twenty minutes after seeing the movie, 90% of the audience will not be able to name the five armies who were battling, why they were battling, who won, who lost or what became of most of the characters who survived the battle. Unlike the paced, well-planned and methodical introduction of each innovation in weaponry and animals in Return of the King (e.g. the arrival of the oliphaunts) The Battle of the Five Armies presents buckets of new and interesting weapons, animals and tactics in every scene without giving more than glancing attention to any of them making all of them unremarkable and difficult recall.

Fix: Visually thin out the battle scenes and add ordinary presentation dynamics like lulls, pauses, slowdowns and speedups. Focusing on two or three creative innovations such as the interesting tunnels that were introduced and then merely mentioned. Audience anticipations such as Beorn tearing into divisions of orcs could have replaced umpteen minutes of blurry sword clashing.

This movie is worth watching mostly to complete the trilogy and the extended edition is significantly better than the theatrical version (which I would give no more than a 1-star rating). On it's own merits, it's a stinker.

P.S. My final epilogue on the missing elements of Tolkien's writing

Peter Jackson and the other writers who assisted him failed throughout all six of the movies to grasp Tolkien's supernal messages like his representations of immortality and omniscience. This shows up in the audience always walking away saying, ""If the eagles had just showed up earlier, the plot would have been moot."" and ""I thought elves were immortal. What's with them dying like mortals in the big battles?"". Gandalf and the other wizards seem to be omnipotent but only at certain times. And this is not explained at all by Peter Jackson et al.

Tolkien explains that the eagles don't just fix things all the time because they represent something like gods who let people learn lessons through suffering and the consequences of choices but who step in when Evil and Injustice overwhelm Good and Right. And the immortality of Tolkien's elves is subject to the Higher Power that rules Middle Earth as is the transient omnipotence of wizards.

Tolkien didn't call eagles gods, elves angels and wizards prophets but that's what they are. Publicly, Tolkien resisted any comparisons to real world analogs of any of his characters but privately admitted doing as much. Tolkien was not a political or religious commentator like his peer C.S. Lewis and insisted his books were not driven by any agenda. But he could not deny that he represented Good and Evil essentially as God versus the Devil. And he showed that weak character (greed, avarice, hatred, revenge) was the cause of people doing deliberate harm to others i.e. making wars.

Peter Jackson made a terrible mistake in letting Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens insert girly romances that Tolkien did not include and never intended. The Harlequin romances dilute the broader and deeper messages of human character that Tolkien communicated. The non-Tolkien characters and subplots distract disastrously from Tolkien's decidedly macroscopic view of the human condition. The cheap attempt to pull in female viewers fails miserably to do so because intelligible woman--young and old--can appreciate a wider view of relationships than the soap operettas insinuated into Tolkien's Biblical epic by Philippa Boyens (who I understand is the culprit responsible for the soap opera romances).",1476230400,7,5545,5.071350164654226

There is more dialogue that make the scenes flow much better. Fight scenes are extended and show that much more of Heroes and Villians. Making the overall movie more enjoyable !

I will say even with 3 films the movie does its own account of events and does not follow the book as closely as this fan of the series would, but they are still great films in theit own right.
This movie is excellent. The imagery, the characters, and the battles are top notch. I would have liked to see more natural beauty of New Zealand like in the original LOR trilogy.  Overall this is still a great movie and I love it.",1473984000,,611,4.126050420168068

You can tell a lot of love was put into this movie by the actors and others despite the fact that it has flaws.

There are still a couple of things in the books that he omitted, but I guess he's proven by now that he knows what he's doing.

I liked the movie in the first place, but the extended scenes that were added were not only brilliant, but fit in so well. It also includes certain scenes that would be considered plot holes. Also, there is much more battle scenes between the dwarves and elves, and the company of Thorin Oakenshield against Azog's army. The only reason why it's rating changed from PG-13 to R is because of the added battle scenes. All in all, even if I wasn't a complete LOTR and Hobbit fan, I would highly recommend this film to many.

A couple of criticisms:
Alfred was meant to be comic relief, I suppose. Boring, cliche-ridden story, could have left him out and the movie would not have suffered. Same with Stephen Fry as the ruler of the city -- boring, cliche-ridden and predictable.
The scenes with Galadriel, Elrond and Christopher Lee came out of nowhere, didn't fit in smoothly with the story line and could have had more explanation or perhaps could have been left out entirely. If you have the dragon and orcs or whatever they are, you don't really need a poorly explained necromancer too. Quite a few baddies in this movie as it is.
Legolas's storyline is wrapped up satisfactorily, he is all set to become part of the Lord of the Rings adventures. Bilbo's storyline is wrapped up too. And you see where the dwarves and men are going next, too. But Thranduil's and Tauriel's stories could have had some hint of what happens next for them. I guess he goes back to his kingdom and she does too, captain of the guards again?",1468281600,,1234,4.660550458715596

5265313,5,B0095HHLMO,"I'm that guy.  The one who'll shell out another $10 for an ""Extended Edition"" or a ""Director's Cut"" of a movie.  I'm the guy who'll sit and watch a 2 hour movie, and then sit and watch another hour or two of special features.  I not only enjoy movies, but the work that goes into making them.  The technology and mostly the hard work.  Now, a lot of times, an ""Extended Edition"" will have a few minutes of scenes that were cut out due to ""time constraints"" or they didn't ""help the story along"", and after seeing these, I would agree, but I still enjoy seeing them.  Makes me feel like I'm seeing the ""whole thing"", the movie as it was intended.  Now, I know that you'll never see a movie as it was intended, especially one based on a book, because that movie would be 8 hours long, but I still get a feeling of completeness by seeing those deleted scenes.  In the case of the extra scenes in this movie, yes, they do not really progress the story much, but they are oh so good to watch.  Especially the scene that was added during the final battle at Erebor.  It filled in some gaps that, honestly, I didn't know were there until I saw it, and it had me on the edge of my seat cheering and laughing at the same time (you'll know it when you see it).  I know people have given Peter Jackson crap about stretching the book into 3 movies and how people say it's a slog to watch all 3, but I really enjoy The Hobbit Trilogy movies, more so than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, actually.  And this one is no exception.  The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies Extended Edition is well worth the price I paid to purchase it and is definitely worth the price of rental.  I would suggest, if you rent/purchase it, you do so when you can sit down and watch all 3 together.  Everything ties together much better and that feeling of ""completeness"" I got at the end of it all was just a nice warm fuzzy.",1468022400,6,1893,4.176308539944904

5265375,5,B0095HHLMO,"I know this should have been one movie, but... I can't help but enjoy these movies and say what you will, but so much work and effort went into these films, and I feel as if that is often forgotten.  also for me to hate these films is for me to be a bit of a hypocrite, bc people get mad about what was put in, but they forget that the LOTR movies had stuff put in it from appendices and other books of Tolkien's as well.  the hobbit movies just wished to include a lot of other stuff from Tolkien's other works, and it gave background.  for example, i'm not ashamed to admit this, but the first hobbit movie helped me put into perspective and comprehension the council of Elrond chapter in the Fellowship of the ring book.  there was so much in that chapter that it is hard to put into perspective, but an unexpected journey really helped me understand it all better. also there was a lot of good acting, some great scenes and some lovely directing in a great deal of places.  and that stuff that was added do not at all ruin the movie for me.  people get angry about legolas being there, but he did technically exist in mirkwood at the time of the hobbit, and the hobbit book was Tolkien's first outing when it came to publishing and he was still building his world.  he came up with legolas after he published the hobbit, but he did exist in that time frame.  as for tauriel, like with legolas, people are spending too much energy with their hate on that, for when they entered mirkwood, they were taken prisoner by elves, and all those elves were individuals who just go unnamed.  in writing, that is called a blindspot, where you can take a character that goes nameless, give them a name and give them a more prominent place for development.  also, this was done in LOTR films, where characters were taken from the multitude, given a name and given a cool role, i.e. Lurtz, who was the uruk-hai who led the force that attacked borimor at the end of LOTR.  He's not really in the books, but since there was an uruk-hai host that attacked the company, there easily could have been a leader who was like lurtz.  blindspots have the right to be filled in sometimes for dynamic storytelling purposes.  if you hate tauriel and legolas being there, then cool, but you can't hate them and then say its ok in LOTR, bc that's a double standard.  I know these films are not as good as the LOTR movies, but there is something really fun and enjoyable about them!  I know people hate them, but I admit that I cannot be one of them.  while I wish the cgi was better handled and man I hate 48 fps, I still find a lot of good elements to these films and think they are still great.",1466640000,6,2670,4.288844621513944

5265763,1,B0095HHLMO,"While I adore the book and was entertained by the first film, I found this last installment to what I felt was an unnecessary trilogy (it could easily have been told in one movie, at most two) to be very weak and drawn out.  ""Like butter scraped across too much bread.""  There was too much filler put in, drawing away from what should have been Bilbo's story into implausible and clunky side plots that didn't need to be there.

I must say, while I give this movie only one star, there were some stellar performances.  Martin Freeman, for one, was spectacular.  Sir Ian McKellan, as always, was awesome.  Luke Evans did a really good job.  Manu Bennett did a fantastic job playing Azog the defiler, one change from the book that I thought was a good move. There were others who did well, also.  I won't mention the specifics of what I didn't like, because I would prefer not to do so.  It would be too emotionally exhausting.",1461801600,2,925,4.458333333333333

5265804,2,B0095HHLMO,"The LOTR trilogy is a masterpiece and IMHO sets a bar that is nearly unattainable for other films in the genre.  Even a good adaptation of The Hobbit would've faced an uphill battle trying to match LOTR.  But instead of a good, single (maybe two parts would've been OK) film adaptation that builds off the things that made LOTR so great, we get a trilogy where more than half of the run time is devoted to filler material that was taken from other books and/or made up for the screen.

I had high hopes for the extended edition of BOFA after seeing the rather disappointing theatrical cut.  Here was an opportunity to tie off this already bloated trilogy with a rousing adventure and some nice bits for fans who want to see how they bridge the screen ending of this story to LOTR.  Instead, they were brutally dashed by the incomprehensible mess this film is.  It's actually worse than the theatrical cut.

Some of the extended and added scenes bring some decent eye candy but no real substance.  The titular battle is still terribly shot and edited.  The arrival of the fifth army is handled like an afterthought, even in the extended edition.  The resolution of the filler material we've seen for two movies adds to the confusion (especially the resolution of the awkward and unnecessary elven-dwarven love triangle).  And then there's Saruman.  If you're going to include a character who had such an influence on events in LOTR, you might want to make his appearance count. Especially when, after he's involved in freeing Gandalf and driving Sauron out of Dol Guldur, his last line is the rather ominous, ""Leave Sauron to me.""  Indeed.  But instead of that encounter getting worked into the final act, we get extended and added scenes of......Alfrid.  Sigh.  More scenes along the lines of Thranduil and Legolas' farewell (""Go to the North. Meet with the Dunedain. There is a young Ranger among them. His father, Arathorn, was a good man. His son may grow to be a great one."") might have helped to redeem the preceding three hours.  Maybe.

One of the two stars I gave this movie is for the gift set.  The statue of Gandalf and Bilbo sitting together as the former lights his pipe is a pleasant surprise.  It's the same size as the statue of Bilbo and Gollum created for the first movie.  Be aware that it isn't at all large, like the pricier and more detailed Weta collectibles on the market, but it's really well done for what it is.",1461110400,10,2438,4.623255813953488

5265879,2,B0095HHLMO,"I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's books, and I thoroughly enjoyed Peter Jackson's adaptation of LOTR. I've been disappointed by the Hobbit films though; so much so that I only just got around to watching this third one, and I'm afraid in my view it stumbles as well.

The original sin here is greed, in Thorin's case his obsession with not only the Arkenstone but all the dragon hoard, and in Jackson's the decision to try to squeeze three movies out of a book that would better have been covered in one or two.  There are some good scenes and great acting in this film, but there's too much filler, too many repetitive battle scenes, and way too much mawkish sentimentality.  Wasn't it exciting enough in the books when Bard the Bowman spent his last black arrow killing the great Smaug?  Did we really have to have Bard's child come running to him, ending up pinned between him and the dragon and used essentially as a crossbow to guide the last arrow (spear, rather, as everything in the film apparently must be bigger)?  And then of course the boy and his adorable moppet siblings are once again in harm's way during the battle of the five armies, because Bard clearly needs to gaze into their eyes in the midst of battle to be motivated to fight.  Then Legolas has to be shoehorned into the film, running an essentially useless errand to Gondabad in order to deliver some exposition regarding his mother. And don't even get me started on the Kili and Tauriel romance...",1460332800,,1468,4.562737642585551

5265881,4,B0095HHLMO,"I really enjoyed the last video of the Hobbit series.  I had rated the first two at three stars each.  My biggest quibble all along has been that there wasn't nearly enough material for three movies that are each over two hours in length.

This movie is an ending.  If you haven't watched the previous two Hobbit movies, it is pointless to even begin watching here.  It is assumed that everyone knows the main characters -- the dwarves, Bard, Thranduil, Tauriel -- and so no introductions will be made.  The film begins with the death of Smaug and then goes through a bit of a hard patch when Thorin begins to be afflicted by Dragon Fever, or some such thing.  This was more than a little over the top and goes on for longer than maybe it should, but it does give time for the elves to arrive and sets up a final redemption for Thorin.  In the background, the White Council dukes it out with Sauron and the Nazgul.

The last hour and a chunk of this movie is devoted to the battle of five armies (hence the title).  This really turns into a grind, as everyone knows how it will end, but the process of getting there is pretty rough.  There are lots of scenes with people in helmets decapitating orcs or spearing orcs or stabbing vile creatures in the head.  The CGI is really over the top and feels very video game like.  Main characters are invincible -- up till the point at which they aren't, which is telegraphed pretty clearly ahead of time.  At one point, a couple of dwarves (and Legolas in the background) nonchalantly take on ""about a hundred Gundabad orcs.""  Apparently the orc armies have to have a huge size advantage, considering it is no big deal for one dwarf to take out about thirty of them by himself.

The ending is weak.  Pretty clearly Peter Jackson didn't know how to end things after the death of Thorin.  Everything else seems sort of wasted and designed more to tie the end of this film with the Lord of the Ring series.

The actors really did an excellent job in this film.  Richard Armitage, Martin Freeman, Luke Evans and the rest make the most of the scenes in which they can breathe life into their characters.  We finally get to see one of the main themes of the Hobbit, which is the corruption of wealth and of its unimportance in the whole scheme of things.  To quote from the book, Thorin says ""...Child of the kindly west, I have come to know, if more of us valued your ways -- food and cheer above hoarded gold -- it would be a merrier world.  But sad or merry, I must leave it now.  Farewell.""

Biggest quibbles with whole series have to do with the changing of certain characters.  It really bothers me that Thranduil is changed into a jewel chasing fiend who cares nothing for men and ends up leaving the field of battle when his army has suffered too many losses.  Thranduil is in general a sympathetic character in the books who comes to the aid of the people of Esgaroth and fights to the bitter end with them.  Beorn is such a weird tack on job here.  Either he needed more screen time or less.  I suppose he was included in the second movie because they didn't have enough stuff for the dwarves to do and in this movie, they couldn't really figure out what his purpose was and so they left him out for the most part.  I wish there was more Bilbo in this last movie.  I understand that this movie is about a battle and that hobbits aren't warriors, but Bilbo is central to the movies and his character brings a certain kindness to the scenes he is in that is not present when Thorin and the elf king and Bard are yelling at each other.  The battle scene could have been shorter anyway and more time spent with the after math.  It only gets a chapter in the book, while here it is most of the movie.

It may sound like I didn't like the movie, but I really did.  I felt by the end of it that I had come to know the characters.  I did care when Thorin turned into a gold hoarding fool and I cared when he met his end against Azog.  Little people can do great things in this world when they have big hearts and a little courage.  And that's a good message to think about in this dark world.",1460246400,,4130,4.2664092664092665

And the romance between Tariel and Kili is just so, so stupid. Please stop. Also I really wanted the Eagles to have a better part.

5266097,2,B0095HHLMO,"I really liked the first two Hobbit movies and had high hopes for the third.  Unfortunately the story line is gone.  The primary focus of the movie is a battle and an attempt to link the Hobbit to LOTR.  Because this movie was not based on any particular story many aspects end without resolution.

The battle is epic, the special effects were great - though we've seen them all before, seeing the conclusion of the second movie was worthwhile, but that is over in the first 30 min.  After that the storyline really falls apart.",1457481600,,528,4.515789473684211

I liked the extra Bard, Beorn, and dwarf scenes, although at least one of the new dwarf segments did seem to alter the movie noticeably to me.  I especially liked the funeral scene at the end, but did miss the hoped-for troll chest bit.

I will still maintain that this trilogy should have only been one three-hour movie, maybe with a 3.5 or 4 hour extended DVD/Bluray.  I loved The Lord of the Rings movies, hated these.  Most of the content was made up by the movie creators and did not stick to the Tolkein version.  All in an attempt to milk fans of their hard earned cash.  This trilogy completely missed out on the silly, light-hearted nature of the book.  Made up characters, made up plot lines, made up battle.  Usually film adaptations of books have to cut a significant amount of content due to time constraints.  Peter Jackson and crew went the other direction.  Not recommended, unless you're a movie collector like me.  I would say wait til the price drops, but it seems that doesn't happen with these films.

I hope they do another movie that tells or fills in the cap between the years of the hoobit and lord of the rings.  Peter Jackson did say he wanted to show us a young Aragorn, Thangal, Little Frodo and his adventures with Uncle bilbo and other things that was in the books, but just couldn't find a place for that content.  I do wish they could of shown how Sarumon first  allies himself with Sauron.  I would of loved to see Evil Saurumon getting the palantia or the all seeing eye thingy that he uses to talk to Sauron in lord of the rings for the first time.

5266334,3,B0095HHLMO,"Oh, I want to like this.  It felt like these films were leading up to something great, and there are moments that are wonderful, but...

First, the title character gets sidelined, and Martin Freeman's Bilbo is, without a doubt, the best part of this series.  With him playing a smaller role (and actually knocked out for a portion of the film), the best, most empathetic character is too often missing.

Second - numbingly long battle sequences. Many spectacular scenes, when taken individually, but damn...that battle just goes on..and on...and on...and on...and I'm just not personally invested in most of these characters for me to care enough for the battles to work as drama and narrative (as opposed to just showing off CGI effects).

Third - the extra scenes in the Extended Edition do very little to deepen the story and flesh out the characters. Mostly we're treated to yet MORE action sequences and - unfortunately - a lot of horrific gore, including a deeply unpleasant ""battle monster"" which I shudder to think about (my empathy for the poor tortured creature made me seriously question Peter Jackson's judgment). I can be OK with gore, and Peter Jackson of course has a long history with splatter-flicks, but the gore here was tonally off.

But the moments that shine still shine.  Freeman as Bilbo, McKellan as Gandalf, and Blanchett as Galadriel make every second they're on screen count. There are some moments of terrific beauty the remind you of how good Jackson's Middle-Earth films can be. But this is a pretty disappointing way to go out.",1455408000,3,1559,4.904942965779468

5266593,5,B0095HHLMO,This review is for 3D effects. not the cast or how the movie does not follow the book..There are not many out of screen effects in this movie(which im old school and love the most) except when bard is shooting the black arrow at smaug..but the depth and clarity and high frame rate of this picture is the most clear and by far the most beautiful I have seen..absolutely no ghosting on my equipment which includes a samsung 80 inch suhd curved 4k 3D led tv with Active glasses sitting dead center from 9 ft away and a sony 4k up converting blu-ray  player and paradigm 12 inch sub with paradigm surround speakers with sony reviewer ..once again pop out effects are less than a handful. .but clarity and depth are excellent...if you enjoy the beauty of the 3D world like my family ..it is some nice eye candy..,1453420800,,808,4.422818791946309

5266670,5,B0095HHLMO,"If you loved Lord of the Rings, you liked the Hobbit, and you have to own them all. I re-watch these all the time. Hobbit movies weren't as strong as Lord of the Rings -- which is epic and one of the best movie trilogies ever made -- but the characters of Bilbo, Thorin, Thranduil and Bard especially stand out, and Gandalf, Galadriel, Elrond and Sauraman are always good; same actors as LOTR. Very well cast. And Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing as Smaug. The Master of Laketown and his sidekick Alfrid do a great job being smarmy and loathsome. Some of the dwarves are a bit overly goofy, Legolas has put on weight and doesn't look as elfy as he did  when he was younger and skinnier in LOTR, and the love story between Tauriel, an elf, and Kili, a dwarf, is a bit of a stretch but fun to watch if you suspend disbelief and pretend you didn't read the books. Most of us DID read the Hobbit in school, so it's wonderful to see this classic on the big screen.",1452988800,,958,4.263736263736264

5266676,5,B0095HHLMO,"Extended Editions allow directors like Peter Jackson to tell the story the way he wants to without having to worry about theater-goers getting restless.  In this case, there's a great deal of material that didn't make it into the theatrical release.  In addition, you get almost nine *hours* of behind-the-scenes documentary material which we find every bit as interesting as the movie itself.  Well worth the wait.",1452988800,,415,5.164179104477612

Splitting it into 3 movies was an advantage to get closer to the book's origins even though the book was quite smaller than even one book in The Lord of The Rings trilogy.

Sure, there was a lot missing from the books but what movie doesn't? The only thing I really disliked about this movie (this trilogy) is that the Orc are all animated rather than using FX makeup like they did in the LotR. You'd think that after 10 years, FX makeup would have come a long way... but instead digital animation seems to be the way to go. However, it's awful to see that the orcs in Lord of the Rings look more realistic than the orcs in The Hobbit. That's my only disappointment. It doesn't take away from the fact that I still absolutely love these movies.",1452729600,,707,4.323308270676692

Instead of purchasing the initial releases for Lord of the Rings, we waited and bought them in sets like this on DVD.

Since then, Blu-Ray has come out and we were worried that we'd have to buy them in Blu-Ray format and have mismatched cases.

Definitely not my favorite of the trilogy but totally worth getting.  The best new scene includes Gandalf trying with much frustration to use a new staff that Ratagast gave him.  Only it works about as well and as often as the Millennium Falcon.  And the way the Dwarves counter the Elves initial arrow strike is really cool and unexpected.

They cover casting, costuming, and more importantly, backstory and character development. I was completely blown away with the insight into Lee Pace's work and dedication to the project, and I think you will be, too. Love the story about his sword.

The R rating is because of extra Orc blood and deaths, but also because of one scene between Bolg and Legolas that was added. Bolg's hand gets impaled with Legolas's knife and doesn't really bat an eye, which is dangerous for children to see (they might try it themselves if it looks unpainful).",1451001600,,763,4.9609375

5266849,5,B0095HHLMO,"Most people reading reviews for this movie have probably seen it at least once at a cinema, and/or have read Tolkien's novel, so I won't go into a lot of detail about the content. Passions are so inflamed about Peter Jackson's treatment of J.R.R.Tolkien's works, both of The Hobbit and LOTR, that I also don't want to throw any more fuel on that fire, either. Either you liked these movies and simply accepted them for their own merits, or you didn't. So I want to focus my contribution on the specifics of this Extended version vs. the Theatrical version that we saw at the cinema two years ago. First off, I measured the run time of the actual movie, minus the beginning and ending credits, as 2 hours, 29 minutes, 51 seconds. I don't know exactly how much additional run time this represents, compared to the theater version, but it felt like a LOT, as if every scene had been expanded significantly. In short, this Extended version felt like a completely new movie. Without any reservations, my opinion is that this version is worth the purchase price, whether you already own a DVD or BD of the theatrical version or not. One thing I have to point out is that the violence of the battle scenes is much more graphic, with lots of decapitations and sword thrusts, although the level of gore isn't as horrifying as it might have been in terms of spraying blood and disembowelment. But the film is rated ""R"" for violence and I wouldn't let kids younger than maybe 12 see it without discussing this with them. It's way, way more violent than the book, which does let you know that some of the main characters die, but doesn't go overboard with describing every bloody detail of how they got killed. It was a children's book, after all.

Warning - Spoilers:

The characters in the film are mostly drawn directly from the novel, like Beorn, Bard, and Dain, with a few exceptions like Legolas, Tauriel, and Galadriel, who are either additions fabricated by Jackson, or characters who were there behind the scenes in the novel, like Galadriel, Radagast, and Saruman, but who aren't actually mentioned in The Hobbit; these characters appear later in LOTR, mostly during depictions of The White Council and the ejection of The Necromancer from Dol Guldur. Many characters from the novel, like Dain and Elrond, who are only mentioned in passing and don't have any actual ""speaking part"" in the book, have quite a bit of dialog in this movie and we actually get to meet them ""in person"", so to speak. The cast in this film was uniformly excellent. When I first saw Part 1 of The Hobbit, I had a little resistance at first to accepting Martin Freeman replacing Ian Holm as the younger Bilbo, but he has since grown on me, and has ""become"" Bilbo Baggins for me, just as Ian McKellan, Cate Blanchet, Hugo Weaving, and Christopher Lee will forever be Gandalf, Galadriel, Elrond, and Saruman.

In summation, this film adds a lot of detail that is not in the novel, with some characters like Tauriel that are not mentioned anywhere in any of Tolkien's written works, but as pure storytelling in it's own right, it's really good. It follows the main plot elements of Tolkien's novel reasonably well, and if you keep an open mind about Jackson's deviations from the strict letter of Tolkien's novel, and the graphic violence doesn't bother you, I think it's a good value for the price. This extended version BD is only a few dollars more than the theatrical version DVD was a year ago, and it for-sure includes a lot of extra footage, none of which is irrelevant fluff, or at least not much. I was glad I waited for this Extended version to be released and didn't buy the theatrical version a year ago. NOTE: I have not looked at any of the Bonus material yet, and might never actually get around to sitting through it all. I am assuming it's pretty much similar to the bonus stuff that was in the LOTR extended versions.",1450656000,2,3905,4.615827338129496
5266850,1,B0095HHLMO,Because it shares the same name as the book you'd think they would be similar. It's like they skimmed through the book and made up the rest. I was looking forward to a video version of the book. This doesn't come close.,1450569600,,219,4.238095238095238

5266853,5,B0095HHLMO,"My favorite all time movie is the Lord Of The Rings.  Its only natural that I would love the Hobbit movies also.  This Battle of Five Armies has a lot of non stop action in it.  I also had a lot of mixed emotions watching this, as there is a lot of people who you want to be good, turn bad, then back to good again, along with the sad ending for some of the characters.

The death of Thorin brought back awful memories of my dad who died in front of me in real life, it was very traumatizing to me at the time, and still is.

I love the story-line of this movie, the acting and even the fighting scenes.  To ME they are very well done.  I have always like the dwarves in these movies, as Gimli was always my favorite in the Lord Of The Rings.  In this movie I got the impression that dwarf king that came to help Thorin was a much better fighter than Thorin was.

I'm glad I purchased this, and waited for this extended version to come out.  I just wish there would be more ""middle earth"" movies.

5266930,4,B0095HHLMO,"Its been 12 years since Peter Jackson finished the masterpiece Lord of the Rings trilogy. Every human on earth (it seems) has seen those films and been awestruck by the harsh beauty and realism of those films. We were moved by the plight of the characters and saddened by their losses. Middle Earth became a place we all wanted to see, before it passed away forever.

So with anticipation we all looked forward to The Hobbit making its film appearance, but that enthusiasm was pretty short lived after the first bloated entry into a trilogy of films based on a short novel intended for young readers.

I guess at this point the question is, how is the final entry, Battle of Five Armies with an additional 20 minutes of new and expanded scenes.

The expanded edition benefits somewhat from the (relatively) truncated running time of the original theatrical release which clocks in at 144 minutes  the shortest running time in the series. I mean, at least you could sit and watch it in one sitting. The expanded edition running time is 164 min.

In a first for the series, The Battle of Five Armies Extended edition carries an MPAA R rating for Some Violence. I guess by that they mean that some cartoons get theirs heads cut off and there is some CGI orc blood. Since the action is for the most part like watching a cartoon, Im not sure the R rating is really justified for this film. The action happens quickly, its mostly CGI and cartoony and what blood or gore there is leaves the screen practically before you know you have seen it.

Battle of Five Armies feels like the last act of a larger film. It lacks really any real story arc of its own. It opens with the dragon Smaug laying waste to the inhabitants of Laketown. Its an exciting sequence but stretches credulity at times. The people of Laketown seek recompense from the dwarves (Thorin and company) who have established themselves at their ancestral home under the mountain, Erebor. The dwarves soon find angry woodland elves at their door as well. The elves want ancient jewels belonging to their ancestors which are part of the dragons hoard at Erebor. Thorin is in no mood to be generous however as greed (Dragon sickness) has made him suspicious and closed off. Before long, Thorins kin arrive led by Dain in an almost intolerable performance by the otherwise likeable Billy Connolly. Connolly appears to have been CGd into existence rather than brought to life by make up and performance resulting in a grating presence  like Spongebob Squarepants wandered onto the set or something.

Visually, Battle of Five Armies is quite beautiful. Every frame looks like a painting from any Middle Earth or Fantasy calendar from the 80s. There are lots of saturated colors and an abundance of ethereal lighting over bleak landscapes. It is this vivid intensity that makes the whole Hobbit series less realistic that Lord of the Rings. While LOTR had orcs which looked visceral and real, The Hobbit films have CGI orc characters and I didn't for one second believe I was actually watching a real preformance. Too bad, because Manu Bennett who portrays Azog is actually a pretty fine actor. I wish I could have seen a real performance from him, bolstered by great make-up rather than the giddy over the top cartoon Azog presented in the film.

In spite of the glaring weaknesses on display, Battle of Five Armies is more watchable than the previous Hobbit entries. Of the 3 films, it is the only one that succeeds on any level to bring meaningful characterization and emotional context to the series, and for that I can forgive some of the other faults. It is also more exciting than the previous entries although the CGI and live action do not mesh well together to create a seamless transition from live action to animation. It looks more like The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe during the action sequences that it does the previous Lord of the Rings series, but the action is fun and inventive.

The ending is suitably somber and fairly satisfying. Billy Boyd (Pippin from LOTR) sings over the closing credits in a mournful tenor  this was worth watching all the way through.",1449792000,,4134,4.71191135734072

Alot of the new scenes go into detail of current scenes which clears up some question you may have. Of course some scenes are completely pointless but for the most part the extended scenes are good. I have all 3 extended and I can say I can't watch the regular ones anymore. Of course they aren't better then the Lord of the rings extended but they are still well put together and is worth the extra money if you are a avid LOTR/hobbit fan.,1449705600,,777,4.256756756756757

it's saving grace is a few moments that are really good and touching, and a very solid cast.  Watch all three parts (this is the third) with your finger on the fast forward button. There is about an hour or so of good movie in the set.  I wish Peter Jackson had trimmed some of the fat, because this could have been really excellent.

There were perhaps 2 dozen of us intrepid souls spending half of our day to watch the three Hobbit movies back to back. Whereas the intended release date for the third installment is two days later, and then there were two nearby theaters which offered a single advance showing on the preceding Tuesday night. As one of the couples nearby remarked, ""Aren't we privileged?""

Because J.R.R. Tolkien experienced the the repercussions of WWI and WWII during his lifetime, there is a sense of 'his' story which can't be separated from the Hobbit narrative, and also the Lord of the Rings. I think this comes into play where Bilbo is sometimes overwhelmed with confusion at how to respond to the chaos erupting round about him.

As for the Statue it looks to be OK. Mine seems to have great detail and good paint work. I have not taken it completely out of the packaging though so I can not tell how well the Staff fits behind Gandaf's arm as it is a separate piece and not shipped in place. I sort of keep my Statues in the packaging on my display shelf for my media area.

I will say that I was disappointed in the fact that Amazon changed my ship date as they ran out at first. So I did not get mine on release day. But it did come about a week later and way before the new expected arrival date that Amazon changed it to.

5267051,4,B0095HHLMO,"I thought Battle of Five armies was the worse of the 3 hobbit movies, especially when I saw it in theaters. The CG overkill, missing scenes, really bothered me. The extended edition helped fill in those missing scenes, we get more Beorn, Bombur finally speaks, the funeral scene, and a decent dwarf vs elf fight. The chariot scene is once again CG fueled, videogamey Peter Jackson overkill, sigh. Another unneeded scene was Bigfur losing his axe. The comedy vs all the seriousness really does not mix well, or at least was not done well.

An Unexpected Journey was my favorite Hobbit movie as it felt most like the book and more like the LOTR films. Desolation had good parts but the Smaug scene was overdone. BoFA I have warmed up to a bit with this extended edition with the new scenes, and all the extras are good. Plus the video quality is outstanding, it looked great on my TV.

I'm glad the Hobbit movies got made but they did not quite turn out how I thought, the LOTR films remain supreme and some of my favorite films ever made. Thanks PJ and crew!",1449100800,,1057,4.471502590673575

5267061,4,B0095HHLMO,"In his preface to The Gunslinger, Stephen King wrote that LotR was the inspiration behind his Dark Tower series.  Problem was, King didn't give two sh-s about Hobbits.  I'm the same way.  I love middle earth, but I really dislike Shire-folk.  I'm also not crazy about dwarves.  So there was really no way I was gonna like this second trilogy more than the first.  Perhaps Peter Jackson didn't think dwarves were all that interesting either, which was why he decided to include a romance between an elf and a tall and beardless dwarf.  I haven't read the Hobbit, but apparently there was no elf/dwarf romance in the source material, so its inclusion was all Peter Jackson.  I thought it was pretty stupid to include a lovesick dwarf who looks nothing like a dwarf.  But hey, at least he wasn't played by Johnny Depp!  I did think the elf chick was pretty hot, until I realized it was Kate from Lost.  That realization scared my testicles back into my abdomen!  Sorry to go on about the romance crap, but it seriously felt like half the movie..

I liked the visuals, but Ian McKellen's age really showed and it was kind of a bummer.  The cliched writing and acting caught me by surprise- I didn't expect that from Peter Jackson.  ""Those bats were bred for one purpose.. For war.""  ""This is madness!""  And likewise the coward who acted as comic relief was just  way too over the top.  But again, I think I coulda looked past all that stuff if it wasn't for the dwarves.  Watching them fight reminded me of Yoda's lightsaber scenes, but not in a good way.  And how could there be so many decapitations?!?  You'd think they'd try and hack off legs, not heads!

spoilers...

Okay, in a battle involving tens of thousands of combatants, why is it that everyone is obsessed with a dozen dwarves joining in?  Sure, if it was a dozen elves I could understand it.  One elf at three hundred yards could fire fifty arrows and knock out sixty targets (don't check my figures-- I ran the numbers twice!)  And what's with all the obsession over kings?  Is that Tolkien or is that Peter Jackson?  In terms of my own enjoyment, I'd give Five Armies less than 3 stars.  But visually it's so good that I gotta give it a very unenthusiastic four stars.",1449014400,,2231,4.505

I understand that the word ""battle"" is in the title, but it is battle, battle, battle, battle, battle. . . and then another orc army arrives, and etc. There were some really good moments until the battles starts. Thorin's conflict with overwhelming greed is a welcome break once the blood starts to fly (and fly it does with much more explicit gore than in the other films). The scene with the confrontation with Sauron seems forced as if they were eager to get back to the more explicit mayhem. Although it directly set up the treachery of Saruman, I was hoping for a little more ambiguity (as in the book) as to what enemy they were actually dealing with.

Rewatching ""Lord of the Rings"" is a yearly tradition in our household. Unfortunately, the ""Hobbit"" series will not be. I may try the shorter, theatrical-length, versions sometime in the future, but I will not watch this movie again.",1448755200,10,942,4.640718562874252

I own all the Extended Editions of both LOTR and The Hobbit, and feel that the additional scenes within Battle of the Five Armies made it a much better movie.

My favorite scene was the battle scene between the dwarves and elves. This should have been in the original movie because it made that whole scene much better!

My least favorite was Alfred's death. It was a bit drawn out, and that precious time could have been given to Bilbo or the dwarves.

Overall, the BotFA extended edition is well worth the money. The additional material adds a lot of depth to the film, and considering that this was the shorter of the three movies, I feel these scenes should've been kept in the original film because they round the movie out and give more time to the dwarves, which was lacking in the theatrical release.",1448496000,2,1103,4.505

The Blu-Ray is amazing and it completes the nearly 30 hour trip through the making of these three films - that footage along with the director's commentary almost make for a class in how a modern film such as this is put together as the commentaries on the first LotR EE's were a class in how to craft a screenplay out of a ""unfilmable"" book.

In addition to this the extended scenes that were long were the battle scenes and kept getting more and more ridiculous as the movie went on, not to mention the horrible CGI that is so outdated in only two years that it shows how little effort they put into this film.",1448236800,6,657,4.39344262295082

  When I received the extended edition of The Battle of the Five Armies, I opened it, threw away the packaging, and put it on the shelf until I had time to watch it.  Today, as I was straightening the crooked paper on the jacket and was about to watch it, I noticed that this version of the movie is rated R.  I don't buy R rated movies, for a lot of reasons. Thinking I must have missed the change in the rating somewhere in the description of the Blu-ray, I checked again.  If this information is there, I can't find it.
  I can't send it back.  The digital code has already been redeemed, and I have thrown away the wrapping.

5267156,5,B0095HHLMO,"I have already given the film itself a five-star rating and written a review of it elsewhere, so let's talk about the statuette that's included with this package.

After some delays in getting them delivered on time and predicted delivery a month late, it showed up via Federal Express just 4 days after the original promised delivery date of November 17, 2015.  Impressive performance by Amazon in meeting the commitment for preordered items.

The statuette is entitled ""Silent Reflection.""  Sculpture by Lindsey Crummett & Gary Hunt, Weta Workshop.  Figurine made in China.

Love this li'l statue!  It captures one of the finest moments in cinema, where through the incredible acting talent of Martin Freeman and Ian McKellan and the directorial genius of Peter Jackson, we can see Bilbo and Gandalf sitting together quietly just after the death of Thorin Oakenshield, silently reflecting on all that has occurred on their quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain.

The quality and detail are incredible.  Maybe you can see in the photo that with sidelighting, the characters' faces much more closely resemble Bilbo and Frodo as portrayed by Martin Freeman and Ian McKellan in the Hobbit films.

You can get an idea of the size of the statuette by comparing it to the DVD boxes on the same shelf.  The publicity photo makes it appear a bit larger than the actual product, but since it's close to the same height (to the top of Gandalf's staff) as a DVD box, it's perfect for what I wanted.  The packaging for the Blu-ray DVD matches up with previously published Blu-ray editions of An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug, so it looks nice with the rest of the shelf.  (In the picture, The Battle of Five Armies Blu-ray is the one immediately next to the gold box for the 3-film Lord of the Rings collection.)

The material is primarily polystone (it's heavy) with some small parts made of plastic; polystyrene is my guess.  Gandalf's staff (the one he got from Radagast) is packaged as separate object that you can add to the statue.  It was a little tricky to get the staff cradled under Gandalf's arm--it took more force than I expected and a bit of fiddling--but obviously I was successful; and it adds a lot to the composition.",1448064000,21,2240,4.794270833333333
5267157,5,B0095HHLMO,Great Movie!!!,1448064000,,14,6.5
5267158,5,B0095HHLMO,"By now anyone getting the extended edition of the movie knows what they are getting.  Chances are most who are going to be interested in this version will be those who have the extended editions of the other movies, and the Lord of the Rings movies.  This set is very similar to what you get with the other extended editions of the Hobbit movies.  The first disc has the movie (as opposed to being split up onto two discs like the Lord of the Rings extended blu rays were), then two blu ray appendices discs with all the behind the scenes and making of features.  If you are not interested in watching the bonus material this version is probably overkill, unless you really want to see the additional footage added to the movie (mostly in the final battle sequence).

One of the interesting things you get in watching the bonus material is Peter Jackson and the other film-makers admitting just how flawed the making of the Hobbit movies were, mostly because of the very rushed timeline when Peter Jackson went from producer to director, and how a lot of the three films (aside from the actual battle of the 5 armies) were shot totally on the fly with no real plan ahead of time.  It also fleshed out a lot of how a 300 page book ended up getting turned into three movies, and trying to stay true to the Hobbit story, but fleshing out other events that were only referenced in the book and making it into a prequel to the Lord of the Rings much more than the novel itself was.

The extended version of the movie clocks in at about 3.5 hrs, 3hrs and 44 minutes including the massive credit sequence.  The bonus materials all total about 11.5 hrs between the two appendices discs and the bonus features on the movie disc.  The first bonus disc focuses mainly on the filming of the movie(s), the locations, the actors, etc.  The second disc has more about the overall story and how they changed/added to the story from the book when making the movie and a lot about the special effects.

As for the movie itself, it picks up right after the events of The Desolation of Smaug, and launches into a big action sequence with the dragon attacking the town.  The battle at the end of the movie is bigger and longer than any of the prior battle sequences in any of the prior movies.  There is also a sequence that was added to the movie showing where Gandalf went when he parted ways with the group.  That is a direct tie in and set up to the Lord of the Rings story.  I think the movie kept a good pace, and it did not take forever to end, which is saying something given how long it is.  Unlike Return of the King where it went on and on after the final battles, they ended this movie in a concise and perfect way.  The acting was again top notch, and the visuals, both real and computer generated were great.

It is definitely not a movie for everyone.  Die hard fans of the book that do not like the fact that the story was altered so much will still not like that about this movie.  If you can accept that and see the movie (and the others in the trilogy) as their own things using the book as source material but not following it exactly, or you  liked the theatrical version, and love to go through tons of bonus material you will be very satisfied by this set.",1448064000,,3258,4.316912972085386

5267174,3,B0095HHLMO,"This is a review of the extended edition.

Spoiler alert: I reveal details about the story.

First off, more than in any of the 3 Hobbit movies, the extended edition adds really great stuff to the story, and if it were up to me, I'd have probably left nearly every frame in. Particularly important to the story is the extended sequence when the Dwarves are driving that ridiculous cart to get themselves up on the mountain to kill Azog. But the other little details always add to the story. The timely death of Alfrid is a detail that was woefully missing in the movie. The added moments in the battle between Galadriel (along with Elrond and Saruman) and Sauron are also particularly great, as are some more details of Bilbo's deeply felt grief at the loss of Thorin.

That said, I would give this edition 5 stars except for the ridiculous R-rated gore that has been added, which means I can't, in good conscience, allow my young teenage son to see this until he's a bit older. I think the movie could have been extended in such a way that the scenes which obviously garnered the R-rating could have been edited differently, or the special effects handled in a more PG-13 fashion. I mean... come on, Mr. Jackson & co., this was a movie based on a CHILDREN'S book!

So, not for the kids, but great stuff here.",1447977600,7,1309,4.487394957983193
5267175,4,B0095HHLMO,"So, the extended version is rated R. And it definitely earns the rating. They have a lot more gore just for the sake of gore. It does not add to the story one bit.

The only added scene I didn't particularly like was the demise of Alfred.  I liked his demise.  It was just that it kind of seemed thrown in.  It lacked continuity.  Also, the color palette seemed a bit off to me.  Nonetheless, I like it more than the theatrical.  Very happy to finally have the complete Hobbit extended trilogy.

I cannot praise Jackson and his team enough for digging deeper into the lore of Tolkien and extracting all the good story lines not otherwise seen in the main body of the text of The Hobbit and LOTR, adding them into this movie.  It really sets the stage for the epic first trilogy of LOTR, and the tie-ins are seamless and beautifully placed.  Several jaw dropping scenes will definitely keep you watching these film time and again for years to come.  I cannot, and refuse to believe, that this is the end of Middle-earth for now.  I hope another director, or Jackson himself, takes up the tales of this precious land filled with hobbits, dwarves, elves, humans, and yes, even orcs...and gives us fans another round of good, solid, heart-warming movies!

5267201,5,B0095HHLMO,"I'm writing this just after watching the Extended version of TBOTFA. Peter Jackson has once again not let his diehard fans down. I say diehard in the sense of the fans that aren't asking the question of whether they are going to be purchasing the Extended versions of the films. They are the fans that start counting the days until the extended version is going to be released while they are walking out of the theater the night it first hit theaters.  I truly believe that when PJ thinks about what he is going to add to the extended versions of these incredible films, Lord of the Rings included, It is not just him digging through the best of what ended up on the cutting room floor. It is done with the utmost care and purpose. A gift to rock the worlds of all the diehard fans. Adding so much incredible epic scenes that the theatricals pale in comparison. If you loved the theatrical and want to go for an even more intense ride keeping you on the edge of your seat, heart pounding, and eyes glued then don't waste a second. Buy the extended version and enjoy. You certainly will not be disappointed. It may only be 20 minutes but it's gold...Cheers!",1447804800,,1156,4.427230046948357

""Why don't you take the cover off?"" my wife says. Huh! Why even buy the special edition if I'm not gonna use the cover. On the flip side (when I flipped it) there is a nice picture of a little glop haired guy, monsters and some long, white-haired woman whom I think is Glenn Close - she's great in everything she does.

5267217,1,B0095HHLMO,"While I enjoyed the theatrical version of the third installment of the Hobbit trilogy, I was really looking forward to the extended edition because I know that Peter Jackson filmed so much more than we got to see.  I was also looking forward to this final exclusive too, thinking that since it's the most action packed of the trilogy, surely the scene depicted will be either Smaug attacking Lake Town.  Or Bard shooting Smaug out of the sky with his black arrow, or any number of battle sequences in the film.  But of all the sequences to choose from in 'The Battle of Five Armies', they decided that the best depiction of this film in figural form was Frodo & Gandalf sitting???  How uncreative can you get?  And besides, Amazon totally dropped the ball in their release of this & didn't even have the professional courtesy to let their customers know until the day of release that there was a shipping delay ...and not just a little delay either.  AN ENTIRE MONTH delay.  I preordered this the very first week it was available back in September & was hoping to watch it tonight since I couldn't attend the 1 showing of the extended edition in Nashville.

5267258,3,B0095HHLMO,"I watched this a few time because the first pass I fell asleep.

First off - New Zealand is the most beautiful place on Earth and when you realise how little CGI was used on the landscape you will quit your job and move. Plus - seriously - The All Blacks!

So, Sherlock Holmes, I mean Smaug dies in like the first 10m (literally 10:42m) from a father/son bonding moment involving an specific arrow.  The town in in flames and most people scatter to shore.  Love-sick dwarf decides that girl from Lost, who is now a middle-class elf, is not worth it and leaves her on the shore. More on the 'Republican' sickness that is eating away at Thorin (lust for money and power). The girl from Lost is banished and Orlando-Dreamy-Bloom defies his father for love. Cate-Breathtaking-Blanchett, Queen of the Elves, can do no wrong and conquers evil and rescues Gandalf (oh Ian, how you make me swoon). Watson, I mean Bilbo, reveals he has the King's Jewel, conundrum abounds. Then we have like 10 hours of everyone trying to convince each other to work together to fight the REAL enemy and not each other (if only people could realise this). Long pauses of thought... hard decisions, overcome petty justifications to NOT help each other... blah. Over an hour in, the 'battle' actually starts. MASS amounts of CGI. The elves are quite shiny. Thorin is still being a hassle. Fight Fight Fight.

Oh wait, let's stop here, in the middle of a freaking battle, and catch up on each others lives. While arrows are flying all around us. Because this is logical. Why not some tea and biscuits?

at 1h 24m, Thorin realizes he's not a Republican and says sorry. Another 6 hours of fighting and CGI. Watson wants to fight. The girl from Lost goes against totally hot Lee Pace for the honour of the dwarf who left her on the shore 10 years ago. More fighting. blah.

Saddest moment in the film - Dwarf and Lost girl reunite, as he dies. This pissed me off. I mean come on... This is Romeo and Juliet stuff we have here. They love each other. They overcame centuries of animosity between the races to find love. The he dies. I call BS!

Half the cast dies. Then - seriously - Watson and Ian toke up like nothing happened and decide it's time to go home. really?

And the tie-in to The Lord of the Rings.

End Credits song - Billy Boyd - this man in amazing.

I love Tolkien. I love fantasy. I love how Peter Jackson brought these books to the screen - gathering up the original illustrators, Alan Lee and John Howe (such respect). The actors, locations, music... movies you can get lost in and believe all of this actually happened. Leaning that life is a struggle, and we befriend people along the way would have never thought we'd meet. We win and we lose, we find love and our heart are broken. People leave us while we find commonalities with those we never imagined.

but, these movies go on... and on... and then some. That said, I will still watch them over and over!!",1447027200,,2949,4.471135940409684

5267339,1,B0095HHLMO,"When the Hobbit movies were released to theaters, I half-boycotted them, just because I found it offensive that Peter Jackson and the corporation he had made a billion dollars for with the Lord Of The Rings trilogy had decided to ""expand"" the Hobbit into a trilogy of its own. Seriously? ""The Hobbit""?  That slender little novel?  On its own, it would have made a fine single prequel film, but a trilogy was obviously an act of corporate greed. Besides, it probably meant that it wouldn't be very good, either.

But, oh, I was so unprepared for just how preposterously bad it would be in the end.

When the first film came out on DVD, I tried watching it, and it was too leaden and dull to finish... and something seemed a little bit off with the half of the film I made it through. Years later, I came across the second and third films together on a library shelf, and thought, oh what the heck? I took them home and made a go of it. The second film was disappointingly bad -- the bare skeleton of the original story lay there, somewhere under the CGI-swaddled fictions of the bloated new script. New characters appeared, old characters became distorted and unrecognizable, the film was overrun with scenes and scenarios that didn't exist in Tolkien's world, and the dialog was atrocious. It soon became clear that the corporate cash-in was far worse than even the most nervous Middle Earth fan could have ever imagined.

Did you think Legolas was a cool badass in the LOTR triology? Wanted to see more of him in action? Well, in H2, you get so much of him zapping orcs with arrows, you start to get sick of it. The big river barrel battle scene is just a video game sequence writ large, soon to be transferred directly to PlayStation, or whatever. No alterations necessary. It was already that bad and that devoid of any tangible emotional core. The scenes of Smaug the dragon are cool, but like everything else, they drag on too long and even the most devoted viewer will be bored by the spectacle onscreen.

H3 is worse. Way worse. There is nothing recognizable from the original book at all in this film. This isn't a mere distortion or padding-out of  Tolkien's work, it is a pure desecration and an absolute obscenity. The simplicity of ""The Hobbit"" isn't merely lost, it is spat upon and mocked as unsalable and naive. This is a loud crude, poorly written, painfully melodramatic mess in which the dwarvish party that Bilbo joined is torn apart and decimated, not by the greed of Thorin Oakenshield (as they would have you believe) but by the avarice of Peter Jackson.

In a near-cosmic irony, all the pompous speechifying in the film -- about lost honor, broken promises and the corrosive power of greed -- is reflected back with venomous fury upon the makers of this film, those weak, heartless fools who were seduced by the hundreds of millions of dollars they could make into utterly destroying the artistic vision of J. R. R. Tolkien, sacrificing his creations on an altar of pure greed. Blinded, they made themselves believe that the ""epic"" battles they computer-generated into existence had meaning and emotional heft, and that the damage they had done by offering this travesty to the world as an ""interpretation"" of Tolkien's work was worth it because, really, they were telling the story so much better than he ever could have. Surely, if Tolkien could have made a film where Legolas shoots arrows at orcs while standing on the on the heads of two dwarves while they were stuck in barrels rushing down a river, he would have. Surely, if Tolkien had computer animation at his command, he would have envisioned Legolas running in slow motion up a pile of crumbling bricks as the bridge he stood on fell into the abyss, defying gravity ala Wiley Coyote. Surely, if Tolkien could have made all these marvels appear onscreen, he would have written dialog as badly as the writers of this film: why bother with art, when you can have more money and riches than even Smaug himself could imagine?

These movies are so bad -- indeed so warped and evil -- I would argue that Peter Jackson should promise to never make another film again. As penance, all of the good movies he made when he was still human should also be burned, destroyed, buried in hidden caves in the mountains of New Zealand, or thrown into Mount Doom itself, if only we could find one person in all the world pure enough of heart to carry the burden. But, alas, I myself was seduced into watching them, and have been befouled, like so many others. It may be many, bleak, countless years before we can find the champion who will rid the world of these dark tales. It will be a long, dark, saddened era, but one day, the stench will be lifted. But I beseech you, all of you who have not seen these blasphemous abominations: do not listen to the whispers and lies. They are evil. Peter Jackson has lost his soul, and may never regain his honor. We will weep for the man that once was. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1445385600,4,4997,4.5867861142217246

5267360,5,B0095HHLMO,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies was claimed to be the defining chapter of Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth saga, and, in my opinion, it very well proves to be.  It definitely caps off the Hobbit trilogy in a performance that exceeds expectations.  The film is basically nonstop, intense action, with little time for a breather.  The battle sequences push you to the edge of your seat and take your breath away, while the dramatic sequences are so well written, filmed, and acted, that it's not hard to imagine that these events really occurred!  The Battle of the Five Armies might be the best of the Hobbit trilogy, though The Desolation of Smaug cuts it close.

I'm not a purist by any form of the word, even though I am a HUGE fan of Tolkien's works.  All of the changes made in this film (and changes continued from The Desolation of Smaug) didn't detract from the story even one bit.  While the Hobbit book and the Hobbit movies are both not near as good as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, they are still some of the highest achievements in literature and filmmaking alike.  The acting (notably Richard Armitage's stellar performance as the disillusioned King Thorin Oakenshield) is magnificent, the cinematography is powerful, the dialogue is moving, and the music by Howard Shore is amazing.  Yet one of the best aspects of this film--and of all of Jackson's other Middle-Earth films--is the overall design and look of the movie.  The battles are epic, made so by the skillful design of weapons, armor, etc., and the landscape chosen for the film almost tells a story in itself, whether harsh, beautiful, or mysterious.  And, as always, the special effects are neither overdone nor cheesy.

***Spoiler Alert***

The Desolation of Smaug left us off with a cliffhanger, and the opening scene picks up right where it left off.  When the dragon Smaug is killed by Bard, the people of Laketown are left with no home.  Coming to the Mountain for shelter, they find that Thorin and his companions are still alive--yet unwilling to share their treasure.  The Elves meet the men and women of Laketown in Dale, there to offer them their aid.  Thranduil, the Elf-king, is wanting a part in the treasure, and is willing to fight the stubborn dwarves for it.  And to add to the confusion, the orcs of Dol Guldur--led by Azog--are marching towards the Mountain in hopes of securing its strategic position for the Kingdom of Gundabad.  This results in the climactic Battle of Five Armies with the dwarves, the elves, the people of Laketown, the orcs, and...not sure...in the book, the Wargs were the fifth army, yet there are no Wargs in this film. :( Anyway, these armies converge in a massive 45-minute battle which I am sure you will enjoy.

The only scene I was disappointed with was the one where the White Council drives Sauron from Dol Guldur.  Sure, the videogame-style Nazgul zipping among the stones was an eye-pleasing addition, but a little weird for me.  And then the final showdown between the witch-like Galadriel and the not-creepy-enough Sauron was, to me, a little repulsive.  Not horrible, though.

***End of Spoilers***

All in all, I feel that The Battle of the Five Armies was an awe-inspiring ending to the story of Middle-Earth, and I am disappointed that it really is the ending.

Nevertheless, I do suppose that the Road goes on and on...",1444867200,,3361,4.771626297577854

Tolkien's story is warped to a perverse degree in order to create a bombastic Hollywood violence-fest.  Tolkien was a wonderful story-teller, and ""The Hobbit"" needed none of the garbage that's in these three films.  There are so many ridiculous, completely unbelievable scenes that any viewer who's able to think even slightly critically will be appalled at the stupidity of some of the scenes.  To mention just one, the tower that's toppled and used as a battle scene never would have stayed in one piece, and Legolas' ""climbing"" the falling stones is about as stupid a scene as I've ever seen in any film.  And there are many, many such scenes in this trilogy.  The fact that they use the Orcs as one of the armies, though, is simply insulting to the viewer--it's saying that we won't understand what's going on unless they tie it in to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Other reviewers have hit upon the other shortcomings very well, so I don't need to go into great detail--just avoid these films unless you know nothing about the book and really love stupid Hollywood excess.",1444521600,2,1153,4.763819095477387

5267443,4,B0095HHLMO,"I am a very big fan of JRR Tolkien. I have read all of the books many times and watched the Lord of the Rings (LOR) movies many times as well. The first two Hobbit movies were great. The third movie was great as well. However, I think that the director went to far this time in going away from the real story line in the book. Also, some of the characters looked somewhat computer game like to me. The Hobbit movie overall doesn't have that buildup of suspense that the LOR has. It just has many battle scenes and lots of characters running around after each other. It doesn't have the glue that builds up the story to the great battle at the end. But overall it is hard to put these movies down. I love them all. It is great to have them on screen. One thing I do like is the director made the movie into a serious movie instead of a children's book. Despite the criticism Bilbo's character was played well and although Legolas was not in the Hobbit at all it was fun to see his character again. ... Read more",1442534400,,1010,4.158163265306122

5267449,3,B0095HHLMO,"Rather than begin with a rant about all the things I didn't care for, I'll start with the fact that this is a beautiful movie, and the cast does a wonderful job. There are a couple of scenes in here that gave me goosebumps. It's visually stunning, and worth watching.
But, the writing was not up to the level of LotRs. I'm very sensitive to writing/dialogue issues, so that kept me from giving this the five stars it should have had. I have no issues with whether or not things did or didn't happen in the book or whether certain characters do or do not get mentioned in Tolkien's large body of work. The awkwardness arises solely from timing, dialogue and plot issues. Also, as wonderful as they are, the special effects had a game platform look to them that I found distracting. I much preferred the makeup artist/costume focus in LotRs.
Despite these issues, I still watch it from time to time. Worth owning as part of the set.",1442448000,,930,4.476470588235294

I give it 3 stars because it's well made, the acting is good, etc. But the focus on Alfrid and Bard's family was tedious bloat. The humor crossed the campy lines and didn't work in this movie. It wasn't levity... it was just camp. (Alfrid with loot boobs. Seriously?)  I hate it because it should have been 5 stars, and I know Mr. Jackson was capable of doing a five star movie. Could have been two movies. Just too much bloat. The battle was a paragraph in the book. Didn't need 3 hours of expansion on it.",1442275200,,598,4.245614035087719

I love all of them but feel that the emotions displayed in this third movie put it a bit above the other  two. I had been unsure as to why Peter Jackson chose the actor he did to play Thorin. But in this third movie I saw why. He really excelled himself in showing the range of emotions that he went through in the course of the story. As to the other actors they all did really well, but my hat goes off to Legolas and all the years he has put in to playing this role in Peter Jacksons six movies. As to Weta workshop, they are as always  just out standing. A movie and series not to be missed, weather or not you have read the books.",1441584000,,798,3.98125

5267552,2,B0095HHLMO,"I'll not waste more time on this movie other than to give a brief opinion. Dissertations are in abundance all 'round. First, I've never read Tolkien. I did LOVE all 3 movies in the LOTR series. The first Hobbit wasn't as good, but still enjoyable. The second made it halfway toward jumping the shark. This one jumped the whale. I think P Jackson and Thorin have the same curse. One of greed. Don't you EVER have enough money? This ""movie"" should never have been made. I have to think Jackson knows it. But, he made it. Had to be for the dough. Holes are rampant in the ""story,"" if one can even call it a story. *It's basically one long fight scene of ridiculous proportions. I'm no fan of old martial arts flicks, but those absurd jumps and kicks are way more believable than what is presented here. Frankly, the only reason I continued watching was the love story between the dwarf and female elf.

SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Once the dwarf (can't recall his name) died with 40 minutes left on the dvd, I didn't give a hoot what happened.

I'm a firm believer in ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder,"" but I STILL have to say that anyone giving this mess 5 stars... well, I won't say that. I suppose some folks l8ike endless phony-looking CGI and constant fighting.",1440806400,,1291,4.584415584415584

5267581,5,B0095HHLMO,"Addendum (11/17/2015):  Since I first wrote the text below, I've been to see the film in the theater and received the DVD version of the extended edition.  The film in the theater exceeded even my high expectations, as did the beautiful packaging for the 5-disc DVD set.  It is definitely a grand finale for Peter Jackson's six-film Lord of the Rings series.

Below is what I had to say about it before the film was released:

I've been eagerly waiting for this!  It's sad to think that it will probably be the last major release of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings movies, but exhilarating to anticipate the extended edition of the final installment (albeit not the final chapter) of this epic six-film story.

I've already bought my tickets or the October 13, 2015 theater release of this same film, too.  Hooray!

Of all the material, what I'm most looking forward to is Appendices 11 and 12, where we will once again see Peter Jackson and all the Kiwi crew working on the film.  I've found that I enjoy those extras on the DVD's as much as watching the actual films.",1440547200,15,1070,4.526041666666667
5267582,5,B0095HHLMO,"Yeah I know this is not out yet but I loved the theatrical release (even if it was a bit shorter than I would have liked) and loved the previous extended versions of the hobbit films and eagerly await this one. Yes you may have heard that is version is rated R, but I honestly believe they gave it that rating due to the amount of warfare (but that remains to be seen). I seriously doubt they added game of thrones or Conan the barbarian (pick a version) levels of debauchery or violence.  Anyway, I don't trust the MPAA. They have made bone headed decisions when it comes to ratings and their value systems don't make sense. Anyway... I love this trilogy and can't wait to own this.",1440547200,3,683,4.3359375
5267583,5,B0095HHLMO,"Great movie, prompt delivery",1440547200,,28,6.25
5267584,3,B0095HHLMO,"Let's keep things in perspective.  J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' is a lighthearted, whimsical, 275-page fantasy novel for children, ages 9 to 12.  It is anything but a dark, brooding, sinister epic requiring mining plot lines (and characters) from the appendices of Tolkien's sequel 'The Lord of the Rings'. . .or pulling new characters directly out of writer/director/producer Peter Jackson's creative posterior.  Yet with the third--and, we hope, final--installment of THE HOBBIT:  THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES, Jackson has created a whopping 9 hours of cinema.  All of it is a stunning visual feast, full of heart-pounding action, haunting music, and amazing visuals--but most of it is forced and contrived.  It's akin to ordering a hamburger and receiving an entire cow; to fans of the novel, these three films are the culmination of over-the-top.

But again, Jackson knows how to make a movie, and FIVE ARMIES is quite a movie.  Here we find the original 13 dwarfs, and Bilbo (Martin Freeman), entrenched in Erebor, where Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) has succumbed to the same destructive greed that affected his grandfather.  Meanwhile, the nearby humans of Laketown claim they're entitled to a portion of Erebor's treasure, as do the elves of Mirkwood, led by the mysterious Thranduil (Lee Pace).  And of course, Sauron has dispatched an army of evil orcs to invade the region, and, not to be outdone, an army of dwarves, led by Thorin's cousin Dain (Billy Connolly is terrific), sweeps in to defend the fortress.  And through it all, there persists the non-believable romance between an elf and a dwarf (Evangeline Lilly and Aidan Turner); plus no Hobbit movie is complete without the fantastic Gandalf (Ian McKellen).  Throw all of these elements together, and the viewer is overwhelmed by a non-stop battle, but to his credit, Jackson pulls no punches; several characters, as in the book, are ultimately killed.  It's all masterfully crafted, with incredible special effects and furious action, yet THE HOBBIT:  THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES proves to be too filling.  This quarter pounder has too many toppings.

5267638,4,B0095HHLMO,"*** This review may contain spoilers***
The title of this review, of course, paraphrases probably the most important quote of either the Hobbit novel or movie trilogy.  Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) regretfully utters the important quote when he finally realizes what devastation his quest for his mountain home of Erebor has wrought.  That regret gives the final movie of the Hobbit Trilogy, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (hereafter Five Armies) its sad, emotional weight. Five Armies delivers the sword/axe/spear wielding and battling excitement of its two predecessors, but this time the mind-spinning, heart-pumping action is tempered by a sobering thought: much of the fighting and devastation was a shameful waste.

Why? Well, with Bards slaying of the rampaging dragon Smaug (mellifluous voice of Benedict Cumberbatch) with the Black Arrow that finds his Achilles heel (an unprotected opening in his neck), Thorin, the thirteen dwarves, and Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) have cemented their claim on Erebor and the ocean of gold and other treasures within.  However, Smaugs attack on Laketown and his death throes after the arrow pierces him have effectively obliterated the town.  All Laketowners, including the devious, pompous Master (Stephen Fry) and his sniveling toady (i.e. kissass) Alfrid Lickspittle (Ryan Gage), are now homeless refugees.  After the Masters shocking but funny death, Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) becomes de facto town leader.  Bard goes to the Erebor stronghold to not only provide food and shelter for his people, but also to claim the towns rightful share of the dwarves treasure.

But some insidious sickness has altered Thorins normally sensible and noble nature.  He has contracted the dragons ailment: acute gold fever.  In fact, Thorins mad thirst and greed for gold surpasses even Smaugs.  Despite the pleas of the dwarves, and especially Bilbo, Thorin refuses to negotiate at all with either the Laketowners or the elven army led by the imperious Thranduil (Lee Pace) who have come for THEIR rightful share.  Men, elves, and dwarves settle in for a long siege.  Bilbo attempts to broker a peace with all three forces by offering the priceless dwarf jewel the Arkenstone (which he DID recover from Smaug) as a bargaining chip.  Of course, this infuriates Thorin and leads to Bilbos banishment from the dwarves.  Battle becomes dangerously imminent when Thorin manages to contact the Iron Dwarf Dain (Billy Connolly) and his mighty hordes to even the odds.  Before long, though, the squabble over the gold escalates to fighting for sheer survival as the brutal, relentless, Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennett), Bolg (John Tui), and his deformed bunch of warriors, giants, and overall freaks catch up to Thorin and company.  Needless to say, war breaks out.

As with the previous two movies, and despite purists groans of protest, Five Armies largely adheres to the novels structure.  Two deviations, the turbulent confrontation of the wizards Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), and Saruman the White (dearly departed Christopher Lee) against the personification of darkness Sauron (Benedict Cumberbatch) and the still-baffling but tender relationship between female elf warrior Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and the dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner), continue from the previous movie.  There are two others.  One, Bard, on his own, discovers Smaugs weakness without Bilbos help. In the previous movie, Bilbo spotted the dragons weakness earlier.  However, unlike in the novel, there is no thrush or any other messenger, human or animal, to convey that knowledge from Bilbo to Bard.  Why the omission?  Im not really sure.  It seems to deny Bilbos instrumental part in getting rid of the dragon.  The second deviation is the long-awaited, final showdown between Thorin and his relentless pursuer Azog, who whale on each other over a frozen river.  Oh, yes, there is a third; the kryptonian fighting machine elf Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) defies gravity to mix it up with Bolg.  As with the previous two movies, the deviations mostly did not bother me, except, yes, not giving Bilbo credit for finding Smaugs crack in his scaly armor.  Come to think of it, why didn't he tell Thorin and the dwarves in the second movie about the weakness, to give them the chance to kill the dragon before he left for Laketown?

No matter; Bilbo acquits himself in other ways.  Although many moviegoers felt Bilbo was marginalized, all three movies, including Five Armies demonstrate that he made a difference, even though in the novel, Bilbos participation in the final battle was rather unimportant.  As already mentioned, he tried to broker a peace.  Second, he does not desert his dwarf companions even after gold-mad Thorin tries to toss him off the ramparts. Third, his rock-throwing abilities, referenced in the novel, come in handy as he beans Azogs orc warriors like David slaying Goliath.  Using his invisibility ring, Bilbo accompanies Legolas and Tauriel to warn the dwarves about Bolgs army. Finally, his loyalty to and friendship with Thorin give him comfort after his recovery from gold fever and battle with Azog.

Five Armies paradoxically shows the cruel uselessness of war, especially for inherently useless gold.  Evil beings might be vanquished, but good beings can also lose everything, including relationships and even lives, unnecessarily.  However, as in the novel, Five Armies suggests that the only good war is one where evil IS vanquished or at least kept at bay.  Through Bilbos mere presence, Five Armies reveals that the way to a better, happier world is steadfast loyalty, friendship, and a desire for peace.  Oh, good food and drink don't hurt either.",1439856000,,5736,5.240963855421687
5267639,1,B0095HHLMO,"I finally got around to watching the Hobbit trilogy. I had put off seeing it because I had a feeling I would be thoroughly disappointed, and I was. LoTR was a great trilogy. It mostly followed the book, but the liberties it took were well-placed and entertaining.

 The Hobbit on the other hand, should have been one long movie. They stretched it out to three with tedious combat filler so unlikely it might as well take place in the matrix, silly characters that didn't appear in the book, and generally drawn out scenes that lack any real point.

I don't know how much the once irreproachable Peter Jackson is to blameI have a feeling the producers insisted on getting their money's worth. In the end it is just another insipid CG-fest that not only fails to entertain, but cheapens the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well.",1439856000,14,824,4.591836734693878

5267649,4,B0095HHLMO,"Of all the LotR films, this was probably my least favorite, not owing to the fact it was the ending, but it just didn't seem to have that magic ""something"" the other films had.

As a movie, it was fine.  You could tell it was well acted, well edited, well produced, well directed, and well though out.  But it was simply missing something.  I know the book and movie differs and that's always going to be a point between purists and movie goers.  Some go because they want to escape.  Some go because they think Peter Jackson is everything.  Some go because they believe LotR is THE pinnacle of art.  I go for entertainment - plain and simple.  (Yes, I've read the books, more than once and seen each movie, more than once.)  Battle of Five Armies was a let down to me.  It was nowhere near a flop, it just didn't have a spark.

I WILL watch the movie several more times, I'm sure.  I won't see that it's anything different than it is.  It's good, but it's not phenomenal.",1439683200,,972,4.298342541436464

Lots of pointlessly long sword fights, a hobbit who is a tedious prig (I loved  Martin Freeman in The Office, but here he is a total bore), and lots of scenes, characters, and camera angles designed to call back to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. After watching the first two installments, I decided that another would not be worth the cost of Redbox, so I waited until my library could provide a copy. Part 3 is worth what it cost me.
BTW, I'm someone who's read both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings multiple times, and own three different sets of The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, so I wanted The Hobbit movie to be a worth addition to the canon. But it isn't.",1439251200,,733,4.42962962962963

Don't get me wrong, parts of this were very well done and it is still worth the watch. I will even watch it again sometime, more than once. I was just expecting so much more than what I got. I would have much rather have Peter Jackson made this in two movies or even one very epic one, then to churn out work which is not the best quality.

You took a 350'ish page book and broke it into three parts each pushing 3 hours in length? As much as I love the story, there just isn't that much to it.

The first two were mediocre at best, but this one... my God dude could you have screwed this up any worse? I know you all made money on this, and that's good for you, but at what cost?

5267768,1,B0095HHLMO,"Love the movie - but if you want it on iTunes, you'll have to go somewhere else.

In spite of claims that you can ""add it to your digital collection and watch it anywhere,"" apparently Warner Brothers is still caught up in the world of DRM. If you want to download your digital copy to iTunes (like the solution offered by most other Blu-Ray providers), you'll be out of luck. Instead, you'll be expected to create both an Ultraviolet account and an account on Flixster, then download separate apps. None of which work on AppleTV or other SmartTV solutions.

Additionally, each website had performance issues which initially prevented me from signing up. After 5 days of them being down, once I was signed up, I began receiving numerous unsolicited spam emails from both organizations.

Finally, when I reached out to Support to inquire if iTunes support was available, I received the attached email, containing not 1, but 4 form responses (the delivery of which annoyed me enough to write a review).

Jumping through Warner Bros.' hoops is a frustrating, clunky experience. They don't seem to understand that people want portable digital media - not to download another app just to view the digital content they purchased. (And we also prefer support emails written by real humans.) As such, I'll be avoiding Warner Bros. DVDs in the future.",1438387200,,1341,4.894273127753304

5267844,2,B0095HHLMO,"It's clear Peter Jackson doesn't really care about preserving J.R.R. Tolkien's work in his films. With ""The Lord of the Rings,"" some of the changes were due to a change in format from book to big screen, while others were from a clear lack of understanding Tolkien's point. With all three of The Hobbit movies, and especially The Battle of The Five Armies, any allegiance to Tolkien's story goes right out the window.

As pretty much everyone who grew up reading Tolkien knows, The Hobbit was the first, very small glimpse into an impossibly large and complex world that Tolkien spent decades creating and filling. The Hobbit was quaint. It was a story for children. Even the scary parts weren't all that scary. Sure, there were battles. Sure, there were dragons. Sure, there were orcs. But there weren't musical numbers clearly designed for awards show seasons, and there weren't brave elf maidens falling in love with streamlined and sexy dwarfs.

While the central story resembles Tolkien's classic, there is so much filler and additive it hardly matters. There are characters whose sole presence is to recreate the romantic angst felt by Arwen and Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings movies. Hell, Legolas even gets another chance to slide on his shield. It's embarrassing.

Jackson cares nothing for Tolkien, but only for making a huge Hollywood blockbuster. He used to be better than that. I'm sure that the millions he made off these movies is comforting, but I sure won't ever allow a young person in my care to view them until they are old enough to understand how Hollywood ruins stories.

I'm reminded of that Seinfeld episode where George Costanza is supposed to read Truman Capote's ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", and then rents the movie instead.

I'll give this film two stars because it still contains some good cinematography and some great effects. And because there is the story in there somewhere. But as a faithful adaptation of a beloved literary classic, this is probably the most offensive film I've ever seen.",1437696000,2,2026,4.912280701754386

5267850,4,B0095HHLMO,"Director Peter Jackson pulls no punches in a worthy, if not spectacular, finale. The endless marching and journeying is over and our dwarves are holed up in the Lonely Mountain, watching their leader, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage in a stoically driven performance), fall victim to the madness of his wealth. He turns his back on the decimated people of Laketown and refuses to reason with an army of Elves knocking on his door.
The action picks up right from the end of The Desolation of Smaug, with the gilded dragon (a terrifically menacing Benedict Cumberbatch) laying waste to the shacks of Laketown and the heroic human boatman Bard (Luke Evans) desperately trying to escape his cell to take a crack at firing the arrow he was destined to shoot. Its no secret Smaug is slain, and his death scene is a highlight; but then the plots converge as do the minions of orcs, elves, men, and wizards, all wanting a piece of the treasure the meager band of dwarves are defending.

Lord of the Rings purists may rightly carp about the addition of female elf Tauriel (a she-elf, or are they called shelves?) who steals a little too much story-time in the final moments of an audaciously staged battle. The Tolkien estate may grumble (as they have for every adaptation of the work that has made them wealthy) about, well, everything. And average critics may carp about each films long running time (this one is comparatively brief, clocking in at about 2 hours, 30 minutes). But I don't know of a film world so immaculately, lovingly crafted over so long a period of time, with such mastery. Jackson stretches the material out for both dramatic and commercial structure and does it well; he has always been a fan creating for other fans, with just enough nods to the uninitiated to keep things generally understandable and enjoyable.

Probably the greatest fabrication here outside of Tauriel (though shes played with fiery verve by Evangeline Lilly) is the smackdown between ethereal Elven Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett, perfectly cast), Riverdells Elven King Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and an emerging Sauron (the big fiery eye in LOTR). If all battles opened with Galadriels power, these movies would last about 20 minutes. Why do the elves and wizards fight with swords and arrows when they can wave their arms and lay entire rows of enemies to waste? This scene is meant to set up the LOTR trilogy, which it effectively does with a bit of a wink.

Future LOTR plugs dispensed with, the films last half concentrates intensely on the battle for the Lonely Mountain, and sets up its armies with a foreboding bravura. Our out-manned, out-gunned little band of dwarves look already beaten until Bilbo (Martin Freeman has found a perfect embodiment of Hobbitness throughout the whole series) snaps Thorin out of his madness and they rally for a wildly choreographed battle sequence. But in the last act, we steer away from the epic armies and follow a handful of the dwarves, Bilbo, Tauriel, and Legolas (Orlando Bloom, eerily CGId so smoothly that he resembles a beautiful mannequin) on a side quest to take out the white orc (Manu Bennett). This extra trek becomes a bit of a mess of tying up emotional loose ends via a series of dramatic deaths, though the final one-on-one battle between Thorin and Azog is inventive and eerie. And for those who couldn't get enough of Legolas acrobatic ninja warrior moves, Jackson lays it on triply thick here.

I calculated that, with the release of the 3 Hobbit films, the 3 Lord of the Rings films, and all the subsequent extended edition discs, Ive invested about a weeks time in Peter Jacksons completely immersive world; and Im not even a huge fan of the whole Lord of the Rings legacy. Im not sure how many more years Id like to see a new LOTR installmentI think Tolkiens liner notes and addenda have been exhaustedbut Peter Jackson could make a 3-movie epic from a napkin scribble, and it would very likely be exhaustively entertaining.

CLICHES: War. Talk of war. More talk of war coming. RUN!

SURPRISES: thats Billy Boyd (Pippin the hobbit from the original LOTR films) singing the lovely finale ballad. Look for Hobbit superfan Stephen Colbert in a quick cameo as a Laketown spy.

YOU ALSO LIKEY: just pony up for the extended editions of each of these Jackson films; there are about 20 to 30 minutes of extended scenes in each",1437609600,,4375,4.802124833997344

Add to it that the villain scenes of Alfrid were ridiculous. I enjoyed the scenes in LoTR with Grimma much better. A more believable character. They didn't need to waste so much footage of him stealing things, hiding out. The movie is about a Hobbit in the midst of turmoil and frankly he got far less footage than he deserves. I felt like he was just a sideshow to the movie at most points.

Bottom line: LoTR did well so Peter Jackson is milking the customers for more money. I will not be buying these movies for that and other reasons alone.

I enjoy Middle Earth. This is the epic closure of the trilogy that was one book and Peter Jacksoon made it into three and I'm glad he did as it gave us more. I can't imagine anyone doing the ""Hobbit"" or the ""Lord of the Rings"" better than was given to us. I've already watched it three times at the theaters with other folks who hadn't seen it as there's so much to see one can't take it all in, in one take. Too, when I want to shut the world out I'll put the trilogy on and live the day in Middle Earth as I'm going about my days as one doesn't have to physically see it to enjoy it. One can see it in one's mind  as it's going along, as one does remembering the book story line. Highly recommend the purchasing. You can't just ""rent"" this film, as the trilogy's have to be owned. One wishes to have the courage and love for life as a Hobbit. God bless and enjoy the film. You'll be glad you did. :-)",1437004800,2,1055,3.9764150943396226

Maybe taken from background stories of the Second Age in ""The Silmarillion"" or ""Unfinished Tales.""  However, the storyline all fit nicely in the telling.  The acting was superb as usual in Peter Jackson movies.  I really can't imagine anyone else bringing the Tolkien books to film than Peter Jackson.  Well, I can, but I'll stick with Jackson.  Martin Freeman was without a doubt the standout actor in the film.  Of course as Bilbo, he had a large share of the picture to carry.  Richard Armitage was so, so, at least in my view, as Thorin Oakenshield, who also had a large share of the picture to carry. Visually the movie was excellent.

5267995,1,B0095HHLMO,"How do I get in touch with Peter Jackson to get those three hours of my life back?  If you love ""The Hobbit,"" forget this installment of the movie.  It has very little to do with the original plot - it's simply Jackson indulging his love of massive, complicated battle scenes.  Clearly, he wanted to revisit his ""glory days"" with LOTR, and clearly as well he didn't feel that the original plot was ""dramatic"" enough - so he has invented lots of plot elements of his own that, taken together, actually make no sense whatsoever!  For example, we have this additional orc army coming that is presumably going to crush our intrepid warriors, but... after the eagles show up, this army just completely disappears.  It never arrives, there is no reason whatsoever for it to be turned back.  It just... vanishes.

Of course, the thread of the original story was hopelessly lost in the second movie (which makes the first feel a lot like ""bait and switch"").  Chasing Smaug around with molten gold was... ridiculous.  Now the story focuses more on Laketown and the noble Bard (and his son), vs. a completely pointless new character - the town leader's slimy, groveling sidekick.  Perhaps Jackson wanted to bring us a new version of Wormtongue here, but the character has no purpose.  He's not funny enough to be comic relief, and he doesn't actually bring about any complications or contributions to the plot, so, again... Peter, what were you THINKING???

As for the great clash of armies, it's impossible to tell orcs from dwarves in the great battle scenes (at least elves are tall), so you can't even really figure out who is fighting whom, let alone who is winning.  And why are there TWO identical bridges from the (not so) ruined town of Dale to the mountain?  An entrance and an exit?  The second one seems to exist solely so that we can have a dramatic scene of Gandalf riding into Dale while the other bridge is full of elves or whatever.  And don't get me started on the elf-king's giant moose...

The special effects and action sequences are epic, as all Peter Jackson movies are, but this movie lacked the magic that made Return of the King one of my favorite all time movies.

Ultimately I think this is just a consequence of taking one book and making a trilogy out of it where the story didn't merit it. While Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman and Ken Stott (Balin) were great performances as well, they were hardly career defining and the action sequences tended to linger and had me checking my watch to see how much longer until the movie was over.

That being said, this does a solid job of setting the foundation for the LOTR trilogy, which is, for whatever reason, significantly better.",1436400000,,805,4.506849315068493

5268060,1,B0095HHLMO,"The pacing of this movie, and in fact the whole Hobbit trilogy, is really bad, which upsets the storytelling so profoundly that it is near unwatchable.  I've never known a movie with so much action and cinematography to be so outright boring.  So how could a film by Peter Jackson, who is attributed to the Lord of the Rings films, fall so far from grace?  Well to be blunt, he and the rest of the production team sold out.

Consider this--The Lord of the Rings movies, which are masterpieces, had three installments based on three books--one a piece.  The Hobbit is only one book, and markedly shorter than any of the LotR novels, yet it spans three films.  How is this possible?  To extend the life of the franchise, Jackson blatantly re-wrote whole parts of the story to implant characters who should not appear in the Hobbit, make unnecessary and unscrupulous tie-ins to the LotR movies, and fabricate entirely new characters and events that do not exist within the Tolkien mythology.  All this was done for the sole purpose of generating more movies and more sales with little regard for storytelling and the viewers' actual enjoyment.  It's blatant corporate greed and it should not be supported.

The producers really took advantage of the fans.  The people behind the scenes knew they had a strong lure from the LotR franchise and could trust people to come out in droves to see the Hobbit regardless of its quality.  So they milked the movies for every dollar they could get and didn't care what they had to sacrifice.  It's quite disappointing because, in my view, the story of The Hobbit resonates much more strongly with the average person than The Lord of the Rings, but sadly, we didn't get to see that on the big screen and who knows if we ever will.",1436140800,8,1765,4.65483870967742

5268097,2,B0095HHLMO,"Rotten way to end a poorly executed trilogy. If you watch it knowing it's going to stink then you can probably enjoy it. What killed it for me...
1. Legolas - why is he there again? soaking up screen time, doing things so beyond superhuman abilities he's invincible; firing arrows at a mile's distance and hitting his target, jumping and catching ledges and branches from hundreds of feet

2. Minor characters with too much screen time. Someone thought it was time for Alfrid to be the comedic center in the film. He shouldn't have even been there at all.

3. Computer graphics that suck: it's the poorly made film where the designers don't know when to add CGI and when not to; ex. a rolling cart nearly kills Bards family but the cart is so easily noticed as CGI it takes you out of the tension; also, plenty more battlefield CGI so dwarves can ride hogs, elves who spear five orcs on the horns of their moose mounts, really stupid looking stuff that again undercuts the attempt to immerse the viewer

4. Bilbo? the book's called ""The Hobbit,"" but B is an afterthought, walking around as the moral and ethical center of the violence he sees, grimacing and fighting, running and pondering, but never truly being the front of the film

5. Far too much of the book was changed to fit Hollywood's need to turn classics (like Disney does to classics) into marketable, mindless crap, insulting Hobbit fans' intelligence and pissing on Tolkien's grave all to make a video game type movie in time to capitalize on the holiday movie run

Sum: a bad ending for a fairly weak series. The one good point is a well done fight scene between Sauron and the council members.",1435968000,3,1660,4.575757575757576

5268125,3,B0095HHLMO,"Most of the time, I love Peter Jackson's detailed, obsessive approach to moviemaking. It worked very well (mostly) for the first three ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, which were detail-driven and had the built in too-muchness that characterizes Jackson's directing.

I don't mind that ""The Hobbit"" was turned into three films, because I love being in the Tolkien world as much as possible. It's just that in this case, with this final ""Hobbit"" movie, things soured for me. I think the writing and characterization got too predictable and mechanical -- I think the weight of the entire enterprise finally managed to fatigue Jackson and his writing team.

The main dwarf character who becomes selfish....it's a difficult character to portray, admittedly, but after a while he ends up seeming like such a jerk, instead of some Shakespearean tragic figure. Worse yet, Jackson and the writers (Walsh, Boyens, etc.) give him too many hacky lines of dialogue, such as ""We will live to fight another day,"" or ""We've got company."" There's too much speechifying before battles, too many last-minute saves by giant eagles, just too much uninspired, repetitive stuff going on. The story also suffers from not enough female characters....it's kind of a big sausage fest, really. There's nothing on the level of Eowyn saying, ""I am no man!"" at the end of ""Return of the King.""

Still, this is a large-scale, action-filled piece of fantasy filmmaking on a level few other films have approached.",1435536000,,1475,5.061728395061729

5268142,4,B0095HHLMO,"I know, I know, the last thing we need is another review to go along with the 100s or 1000s already posted, but in reality large numbers are what make reviews useful and more statistically meaningflul (sorry, that's the scientist in me talking).

Peter Jackson pulls off Part III of the Hobbit trilogy in high style.  The opening scenes provide a dramatic framework needed to establish an extreme feeling of hopelessness useful in setting the stage for the conflict to follow.

OK, before I go on, I have to say it...how did anyone convince the producers of the Hobbit trilogy that they could make three solid, popular, marketable films from a 300 page book written primarily for children?  Oh, yeah, Peter Jackson was involved.  Still, I have to say that while I am not a major fan of the book, the movies are much better.

Jackon was able to continue to develop the characters in a way that does Tolkien proud.  The casting, costuming, soundtrack, CGI (though sometimes too much in IMO) and other aspects of the film work together extremely well.  Character development is IMO particularly good for a handful of characters, especially Bilbo, Thorin, Kili, Bard, Tauriel (not in the book as I recall), and Alfrid (also not in the book?), among others.

This movie presents a lot of epic grandeur and scope, yet it lacks the depth and richness of the LOTR trilogy to which it will almost always be compared.  After all, The Hobbit is about lost legacies and the quest to regain them, combined with a healthy dose of greed, while the LOTR is a classic tale of good in a hopelessly desperate fight against evil, combined with a healthy dose of honor, courage, and devotion to principles and friendship.

This final installment of The Hobbit trilogy is primarily one epic battle, maybe it was just too much fighting.  Well, it seemed that way to me.

It is this lack of richness of story line in The Hobbit compared to the LOTR that leads me to award it 4 stars.

Did I like it?  Yes.  Will I watch it again?  Yes, but IMO it's still a 4-star film.",1435363200,,2045,4.589531680440771

It was great seeing Legolas, Gandar, and many favorites from the LOTR trilogy, but really missed seeing Aragon and Gimli, though they were mentioned in the Hobbit trilogy.
The only reason that I gave this movie four stars is because of the deaths of some of my favorite characters. I won't say who for the benefit of those who haven't watched the movie, but it upset me to see them die as I know they won't be resurrected in the LOTR trilogy. Bummer!!!

Remember the Battle of the Pelennor Fields from ""The Return of the King?""  Imagine that, only with a dwarf riding a battle pig, fighting on ice and a LOT more eagles.

5268249,4,B0095HHLMO,"Ever since the first Hobbit movie came out, I knew that it was going to be one of my favorite series. The previous two Hobbit films had five stars for me, so it is sad for me to say that I am only giving this movie four stars. I know that many people think that the Hobbit films should have only been two in number, but I find that them making the Hobbit films into three films worked better. Unfortunately, this film seems too short, like some things that could have been added are missing. I am not going to spoil the end too much, but I must say that this movie seems to be great, and then after the battle is over, the pace suddenly stops, and leaves a few of gaps, like they had a good time making it until the battle was over, and then suddenly became despite to finish the movie, making it seem like they could have done more. Another problem I felt with this movie is how it played out as a prequel. In the end of the second Hobbit, it made it feel that there would be a huge climax, leading into Lord of the Rings, but here, it just seems like they are delaying Lord of the Rings, instead of leading into it.
 Now, I must say that this is still a very good movie in my opinion, and so I'm giving it four stars, what I stated above is just how I felt it didn't live up to the previous movies, and not how much I dislike it.
 UPDATE: I saw the clip for Thorin's funeral from the Extended Version, and think that it should have been on this version too. It would have greatly improved my opinion.",1434585600,,1502,4.053872053872054

5268300,5,B0095HHLMO,"The Hobbit Battle of the Five Armies Blu Ray/3-D

Like Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings series came out over a long period of time and not exactly in sequence.  For example the Star Wars films, in story-chronology, released as films 4, 5, 6 then 1, 2, 3 and the latest is film 7, to be followed by 8 and 9.  The Tolkien stories came out as films 4, 5 and 6 [Lord of the Rings 1 2 and 3] followed by 1, 2 and 3 [The Hobbit 1, 2, 3].  So this final Hobbit film was also a goodbye to Tolkiens universe by Peter Jackson and a cast of hundreds [actors, special effects geniuses, designers , cinematographers etc.]  A good number of these people had been working on films from Tolkiens stories for 18 years together, so saying goodbye became hard.

When I first heard The Hobbit would be a trilogy of movies my reaction was, Thats ABSURD!  Theres NO WAY you can make three films from such a simple story!  Lord of the Rings was a three volume story, and three films based on it seemed about right.
After watching the first Hobbit film, Jackson had made a believer out of me.  I could see how his telling the tale could easily span 3 films.  And one virtue of taking the time in telling was he didn't have to leave anything from the book out of the movie the way he did of necessity with Lord of the Rings.

This final film as its name indicates, is heavy with battle sequences.  At one point in the special features, one of the principles in production expressed some confusion about exactly what the five armies were.  OK let me explain it then!  Its dwarves, elves, and men versus orcs and goblins.  The fact that there are also wargs [wolves almost the size of horses], giant eagles, huge bats and several other critters is a distraction, as they are accessories.

This film has roughly a 50:50 balance between character development/dialog and action scenes.  Its as far as you can push it without sacrificing story to pure action.  It also pushes PG-13 to theahembleeding edge bordering on R.  [Instead of decapitation, why couldn't we have had a semi-nude scene with Tauriel and Kili?  OK, never mind]

The film didn't score quite as highly as others in this series, getting 7.5 in IMDB.  However it received 45 nominations and five awards.
Do you want to know whats most impressive about this film?  Yes Ill tell you.  Its managing such a large cast and making all of those characters individual and interesting.  Im hard pressed at the moment to think of another movie with so many important characters, all of whom are so engaging.  Lets run through some principal cast names:

Thorin Oakenshield, center to this story, is the leader of a band of 12 dwarves plus Bilbo Baggins the hobbit, on a highly dubious quest to take back their ancestral mountain stronghold from the fiery clutches of the dragon, Smaug.  Richard Armitage played Thorin and was excellent in this role.  He makes it believable.
Ian McKellen once again is Gandalf the wizard, who put Bilbo and the dwarves together [Bilbo cant quite believe hes doing this].  Despite all McKellens other roles in a long career, Im afraid McKellen will always be Gandalf for me, rather like George Scott is Patton.
Martin Freeman plays Bilbo and, needless to say, his acting is superb.
Ken Stott from Scotland plays Balin, one of the 13 dwarves.  He does a credible job, hidden behind a huge white beard.  Balin, the oldest, is the most thoughtful and the voice of caution in the party.  His eyes, the one genuine part you see, positively sparkle.
Graham McTavish from Scotland plays Dwalin, brother to Balin.  Probably best known to an American audience prior to this as a mercenary in the film Rambo.  McTavish is a large strong man, a physical fitness buff, quite suited to the role of best fighter among this band of dwarves.  It does not stretch credibility that he would be intimidating on a battle field.  Hes also pretty funny, too.
William Kircher from New Zealand is Bifur, another dwarf.  OK I cant think of anything exceptional about his part either, but he acts it well.
James Nesbitt from Ireland is Bofur, brother to Bifur.  This guy is a born comedian.  Extremely funny.
Stephen Hunter from Wellington, New Zealand is Bombur, memorable because he was the largest [and by that I mean the FATTEST] of the dwarves.  They wanted a heavy set actor for the role.  Hunter makes no pretense that he does like to eat.  But for this part, they at least double his actual size.  Watching Bombur run is in itself a comedy routine.  And Hunter has a good sense of humor too.
Dean OGorman from New Zealand is Fili.  Naturally rather charismatic, he has the misfortune of being brother to Kili.
Aidan Turner from Dublin, Ireland is Kili.  A major deviation from the book, invented by Peter Jackson and company, is the elven woman Tauriel, and a love story between her and Kili.  Aidan is<sigh> what every woman wants, and every guy wishes he was.  Bastard.
John Callen from New Zealand has a 40 year career in movies and TV.  He plays Oin, not a large role, brother to Gloin.
Peter Hambleton from New Zealand plays Gloin, memorable to Tolkien fans because hes father to Gimli, a major character in The Lord of the Rings.  Peter Jackson made Gimli a comic relief figure in the LOTR trilogy, which wasn't quite fair to the character from the book.  The character Gloin looks credibly like father to Gimli and is not made a buffoon thank heavens.
Jed Brophy from New Zealand plays Nori.  He turns Nori into a professional thief [somewhat upstages what was supposed to be Bilbos role in this party].  Another actor with a good sense of humor.
Mark Hadlow, a prominent actor in New Zealand, plays Dori, a brother to Nori.  Hes a tall man with a large stage presence, which enhances Doris character in the film.  Very amusing in the special features.
Adam Brown from Berkshire, England as Ori was the most surprising actor in this cast.  He was internationally unknown when he got this part.  His star has definitely risen since.  The furthest one can imagine from a fighter, hes clearly in this adventure from a sense of duty to his kinsmen.  Every one will remember Ori.
Orlando Bloom, once again, is Legolas.  What more need be said?  Amazing, he manages to look the same as he did 18 years ago.
Evangeline Lilly from Canada plays the new character Tauriel, a captain among the elven warriors from Mirkwood.  Theres actually a love triangle here: it appears Legolas, son of the King Thranduil, has the hots for Tauriel, but daddy would never approve of his marrying a commoner.  Unclear if she would have fallen for him, had it not meant incurring the Kings displeasure, but uexpectedly she falls for the dwarf Kili.  Her hair being red in this film is like Milla Jovovichs red hair in Fifth Element: one does not forget this character.
Lee Pace from the USA plays Thranduil the elf King, and he really brings this character to life.
Cate Blanchett from Australia of course plays Galadriel.  Again what more need be said?  One scene with her and McKellen in this film, even though a side story, becomes one of the most memorable scenes in the movie.
Hugo Weaving again is Elrond, and like Blanchett and McKellen, he completely disappears as an actor into his character.
Christopher Lee again plays Saruman.  One can never say Christopher Lee as an actor disappears into anything.  Fortunately the character of Saruman completely suits him as an actor, and this was the greatest role of his very long career.
Ian Holm briefly appears to reprise his role as older Bilbo.  Fond memories.
Benedict Cumberbatch does the voices of both Smaug the dragon and the Necromancer [Sauron].  Some of this voice work was really difficult, but he makes it seem effortless.  He needs to be in the next film that only I know about [see below]
Mikael Persbrand from Sweden plays Beorn.  Beorn is a huge strong fellow & so is Mikael.  His time on screen is brief but he is well cast, looks and sounds different from anyone else, as he should.
Sylvester McCoy, previously known to some as a time-lord in the series Dr. Who, plays Rhadagast.  I did not know McCoy before these films.  Hes a completely engaging, quirky fellow.  So much so that I had to go take a look at Dr. Who, which I had never done before.
Luke Evans plays Bard, the guy who.  Wellshoots the arrow.  Earnest, brave, good-guy role.  Seems unambiguously good, which can get boring to play if you aren't talented.  He doesn't get boring.
Stephen Fry from London plays the greedy Master of Lake Town.  A nice guy in real life, hes one of those villains that you just love to hate.
Ryan Gage, an English actor, plays the Masters assistant and right-hand man Alfrid.  If you love to hate Fry, you simply cannot help laughing at Gages Alfrid.  One of the funniest villains around.  Some dissed this role; I LOVED it!  Gimme MORE!  Yeah I grant, having him watch the kids, or ""take night watch"" seems implausible.  Minor quibbling, for me.
Billy Connelly from Scotland plays Dain, a dwarven King who comes to the rescue of Thorin and company with his army [one of those 5 armies, you see].  If anyone in the film irked me, it would be him.  Not his performance, but in the specials he makes clear his disdain for Tolkiens writings.  Perhaps they could have found an actor who actually appreciated the story.
Howard Shore provides continuity of musical score and his usual A-job.

Putting out a trilogy like this, especially pressed for time [for reasons which weren't clear to me, Guillermo Del Toro unexpectedly bowed out as director and Peter Jackson picked it up a year behind schedule as a resulton top of that, more time was lost as Jackson developed a bleeding ulcer with the stress] truly is like the job of a general in a war.  One has to juggle locations, logistics, props, costume design, musical score, budget, script, photography, stunts, extras, and oh, of course, work with the main actors too.  Jackson always manages to look laid back, but hes a perfectionist and he obviously likes challenges.  He succeeded in juggling all these pieces and creating a great film, even if it does seem action-heavy at times.  Let's not forget: Jackson loves fight scenes, and this movie allowed him to fully indulge himself.
Oh and the specials.  As with Lord of the Rings, Jackson milks maximum dollars out of his productions: movie release, followed by the basic film release with interesting special features, followed later by an Extended Version of the film with still more special features, all of them different from the previous special features.  This set came with two full Blu-Ray discs of special features.  I think each one must have been 4 hours or longer.  No way I was going to watch all of that.  ExceptI couldn't stop.  The only thing I haven't watched yet is the on location section showing scenery from locations where they did the filming.  Yes I already know now: New Zealand is beautiful.

Peter Jackson doesnt know it yet, but I already have plans for him to make another trilogy set in Tolkiens universe.  This filmuh, I guess Ill give it a B+++.  Acting is superb, visuals are superb, props superb, casting superb, cinematography superb, musical scoring superb.  I do feel its a bit combat-heavy, and that detracts a little from the potential emotion of the film.  Had the extra year been available for directing, this probably would be an A-rated film.  As it is, perhaps it's the worst of one of the finest trilogies around.  I don't think I've ever watched DVD's or Blu-Rays with more, and more interesting, special features than Peter Jackson adds.  Yeah, it's so bad that I'd like MORE, please.",1434326400,2,11618,4.643943109367337

5268308,5,B0095HHLMO,This movie was the perfect way to end the trilogy. It was action packed and tied itself very well to the  LOTR series. Makes me want to go and watch that one over again as well.,1434326400,,177,3.9166666666666665
5268309,5,B0095HHLMO,I loved it and the entire series.  I love the CG and just the story in itself.  Peter Jackson has an awesome mind!!!,1434326400,,116,4.0

5268317,2,B0095HHLMO,The first series were so good and followed the books well ..... the last three are basically a money grab and nowhere near as good; and very far from the book.  Just sad when an epic movie series gets taken too far.,1434240000,,215,4.119047619047619
5268318,5,B0095HHLMO,Got all 3 Hobbit movies and honestly haven't watched them yet but loved all Lord of the Ring movies so will probably like these too.  Probably wait for really crappy day and just movie marathon through all of them,1434240000,,213,4.461538461538462

5268321,4,B0095HHLMO,"Better than most critical reviews, but I did see the filler scenes which just detracted from the overall plot.
I thought the early plot was diluted to the point that I gave up trying to understand it all. Maybe I'm not a deep LOTR fan IDK.
Overall this movie got better towards the end and I enjoyed it overall.",1434240000,,311,4.288135593220339

5268328,3,B0095HHLMO,Lots of action as with all the series. Very little to to do with the book.  OK entertainment to watch once.,1434153600,,107,4.095238095238095

5268330,5,B0095HHLMO,"If you are a Tolkien Fan & have seen all of the other movies that Peter Jackson has done  (Lord of the Rings & the other Hobbit movies), then you'll definitely want to see the last Hobbit movie. Die hard fans of Tolkien will see that Peter Jackson made some changes to the actual book, but the movie is still a MUST SEE if you are a fan of these movies! I, for one, am sorry that this completes these movies. If you REALLY want to have fun (& have TONS of time on your hands), you need to have a Hobbit/Lord of the Rings Marathon! It will take you about 18 hours (plus or minus depending on if you have the ""extended"" versions)! We did it & it was amazing how  well they all fit together!",1434153600,,688,4.014598540145985

5268347,5,B0095HHLMO,Way better than what I felt was an over-criticized movie.  The filler scenes as I call them added enough substance this time around with out feeling forced that I enjoyed most if not all of the film.  It is not the Hobbit you know but what it does well is to take possible stories that were never mention and bring them into the timeline nicely and give the entire story a boost .  It is a different hobbit but its one worth its wait in gold,1434067200,,441,4.104651162790698

5268349,3,B0095HHLMO,"I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy, not having read any of the books, and so was naturally interested in the Hobbit.  I liked this series but not as much.  I can't compare it to the book, The Hobbit, but as a movie it seemed pretty bland compared to the Lord of the Rings.  This film had the most action, being as the title states, ""The Battle of the Five Armies,""  but I just didn't come away with the same feeling as I did with the Lord of the Rings movie, specifically, Return of the King.  Perhaps it'd have been different had it come out 10 years ago.  The Lord of the Rings is a hard act to follow.  But even that may not be so special to some 10 years from now.",1434067200,,671,3.962686567164179

5268352,3,B0095HHLMO,"It was like watching a pirated movie because the lo def image was terrible.  Someone should give Peter Jackson a lifetime of shock therapy for crapping on The Hobbit.

5268358,5,B0095HHLMO,rounds out our collection for the 3 Hobbit movies and the 3 LOTR movies.  All of them are better on a movie screen but they are fun to watch at home.  someday we may do an 18 hour marathon starting with The hobbit series and working our way to the Return of the King. We'll miss not having another Tolkien movie in the future.,1433980800,,326,4.078125
5268359,3,B0095HHLMO,The end of the first trilogy seemed anti-climatic.  The ending was a band aid fix to cross over to the Lord of the Rings series.,1433980800,,128,4.12

It was exactly as the title says, a battle, from start to finish.  No character development, no side stories, just various battle scenes.  I guess what I am most disappointed by, is that this is the last of the series, and it ended on such a sour note.",1433980800,,394,4.226666666666667

Tolkien wrote is just a story, so what does it matter if someone makes a movie version in which the story is quite different?  Well, to me, the movie version of The Hobbit that Fred Jackson made stinks.  It is vastly more violent than the novel and it turns the main plot of the book into a struggle between the dwarf Thorien Oakshield and a ork super monster. And do not forget the cheesy romance between one of the wood elves and the one of Bilbo's dwarf companions.....",1433721600,,588,4.2792792792792795

5268428,3,B0095HHLMO,"THE HOBBIT was, first and foremost, a children's book. I don't mean by that that it was a book ""dumbed down"" for children I mean that it was a book that children could relate to AS a  child...filled with that special magic and innocence and the sense of wonder that children see the world with. This is a Point of View we lose as we get older (although by dipping into those books that were written with this in mind we can sometimes recapture it for a time).

But look at the books that evoke this magic:
The Wind in The Willows by Kenneth Grahame&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wind-in-the-Willows-Classic-Illustrated-Edition/dp/B00KFHM52E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wind in the Willows (Classic Illustrated Edition)</a>

The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia-Complete-7-Book-Collection-with-Bonus-Book-Boxen/dp/B008LUYSAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia Complete 7-Book Collection with Bonus Book: Boxen</a>&nbsp;(Yes, these books HAVE the magic...but parents who are of other faiths should know that Lewis was a Christian and these books are, basically, a Christian Fable...which becomes very clear in the last book in the series: THE LAST BATTLE which is the Narnian Version of the Battle of Armageddon but even in this Lewis is more INCLUSIVE of other faiths than exclusive. Note Aslan's acceptance of the Calormene Officer Emeth as one of his own. So Lewis's fable is not about the doctrinal points that divide us but about the love that should UNITE us. (But all that is for us grown-ups who worry ourselves with such things. All any child needs to know is that Aslan loves everybody).

Eleanor Cameron's delightful book The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-Flight-to-the-Mushroom-Planet/dp/0316125407/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet</a>&nbsp;has this special magic as does Ruthven Todd's SPACE CAT series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-Cat/dp/B0007EDZA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space Cat</a>&nbsp;but these are sadly out of print. You can get them but it'll cost a bit. (ALL OF THEM NEED TO BE REPUBLISHED FOR KINDLE DAMMIT!!!)

And there are more. Too many to list, really.

Look Jackson's Hobbit Trilogy is like taking THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS and adding plot lines from ANIMAL FARM to it. They've taken what was a simple children's tale and ADDED all the stuff from the LOTR Appendices and THE SILMARILLON and so on that do not belong IN it. Yes, it refers to them (slightly) but it was never intended to FOCUS on them. When you become old enough for LOTR (somewhere between 13 and 15 for the BOOKS) then you are ready for the background stuff and the other books are there so that you can delve as deeply as you like into Tolkien's Universe.

I'm sure this is a delight for all the Tolkien Aficionados out there because I'm one of you and in some ways it is for me. But it isn't the Child's Introduction to Middle-Earth that Professor Tolkien designed it to be when he was writing it for his son, Christopher all those years ago.

And maybe THAT is where the magic comes in. From Alice in Wonderland to The Wind in the Willows to The Chronicles of Narnia and Winnie the Pooh&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Winnie-The-Pooh-Collection-First-Edition/dp/B00VKALSPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Winnie The Pooh Collection: First Edition</a>&nbsp;to A Wrinkle in Time and all the others these books were ALL written with ""a"" child or a couple of children known to the author, in MIND. And BECAUSE they knew THAT child they were able to access a child's world and write these wonderful stories. Stories in which adult cynicism and adult insecurity and adult failings have no place.

(For Harry Potter fans, I am not so familiar with those books but I have read the first one and seen the first movie...yeah, I know, ""Where have I BEEN"" right? Getting old, that's where. But yeah, Rowling's got the magic and I'm glad your generation HAS her as mine had Professor Tolkien).

To sum up...if you want an excellent dramatic adaptation of this book aimed at the CHILDREN then get the BBC Radio Version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hobbit-BBC-Dramatization/dp/1602834547/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hobbit (BBC Dramatization)</a>",1433635200,,5243,6.451566951566951

5268453,5,B0095HHLMO,"Another magnificent film from the very talented Peter Jackson - and a dazzling conclusion to the long, action and humor filled prequel to the original Hobbit trio of movies. My suggestion, however, for any one interested in the subject and has yet to see Jackson's efforts is to first watch these prequel films in order - An Unexpected Journey, Smaug, and Five Armies and then tackle The Lord of The Rings trilogy. But unless you are a truly dedicated binge viewer, don't try them back to back. Each film is quite long and packed to the brim with story points and more characters with odd names than you could keep track of without a score card. Each film is spectacularly produced on the grandest scale imaginable. If you are a movie lover you will need time to digest all you see in the individual episodes. The prequel stories will give you a much better appreciation of Bilbo Baggins who in his dotage (if Hobbits have such) passes along ""the ring"" to nephew Frodo Baggins to set him off on adventure in the original trilogy. So collect all six, get comfortable and enjoy the ride.",1433462400,,1085,4.597938144329897

Among the dwarves James Nesbitt & Adam Brown were standouts. Heck, I'd need to mention the whole cast!

Nope, nothing to really commend itself as great entertainment; possibly just OK entertainment.  Considering Five Armies as (I hope) the last of its lot, it could have been much better.  It's as if Jackson, the actors, and everyone else agreed to just get the damned thing over with and move on to their next gig.

Just two nights ago, I was watching a segment of Sherlock Holmes and seeing Martin Freeman as someone other than Bilbo freaked me out.  Ah, well!

I viewed Five Armies streamed through Verizon FIOS to a Samsung UN65HU9000 curved screen HDTV, suffering through numerous video and audio drop-outs.  Difficult to say whether the problem lay with Verizon or Amazon streaming.  Ah, well!",1433376000,,804,4.947761194029851

It is sad to see a generation that is losing its attention span.  If you want to read the real story grab the book, You will find it much better then the movie.  Having read LOTR's and The Hobbit, many times. I was disappointed by all the movies when they left the story line and went off into their own world.  I do not think I reviewed the other movies on here since I did not buy them off amazon. Like Harry Potter by the 4th movie the only reason it was Harry Potter was they said his name!

Actually his version of the War for the Mountain has a lot more feeling of ""real history"" than the book which is totally lacking in motivation for the various events; and he spells out the ""Business away South"" that took Gandalf away from the dwarves with real finesse.",1433203200,,682,4.644628099173554

5268517,1,B0095HHLMO,I actually loved the movie but could hardly watch it because after PAYING for the HD version I could barely watch it in SD because I was going from my computer to my TV via an HDMI cord.

5268551,5,B0095HHLMO,"I didn't even realize this movie was out as I got the wrong title when adding it to my wish list. Turns out waiting a bit longer was OK. This movie very nicely rounds out the second Lord Of The Rings set of movies. It gives you a bit of background that you didn't get in the first set as to where and how the main characters came to be together a bit. Also you get a bit of history as to how things got to where they were when the Lord Of The Rings started. I found this one about like Return Of The King. (Although I had wished for a bit more of the ""side stories"" had been told there.) It gets you back from the adventure but with a twist....a hint that's all not well as the story ends. A perfect way for it to conclude I think. This movie is a ""must have"" if you like Lord Of The Rings movies and I highly recommend it!",1432944000,,823,3.847058823529412
5268552,3,B0095HHLMO,"The Hobbit should have never been made into a trilogy of films because the story gets stretched too thin. That, and Peter Jackson didn't really want to make these movies and it shows. He was more or less forced into it making them when the original director, Guillermo del Toro, bowed out while the film languished in development hell and lawsuits (it will remain a mystery what del Toro's vision of Middle Earth might have looked like, and if his version would have reached his artistic height of Pan's Labyrinth, or scraped the bottom of the barrel like Pacific Rim). These films don't have the heart and spirit of the Lord of the Rings films, and I wound up caring very little for most of the characters in The Hobbit. I actually like the first one, with it's songs and slow pace, and it has a clear character arc for Bilbo. The second one has no story structure whatsoever, and is just a bunch of stuff that happens (to paraphrase Homer Simpson). It needlessly brings in characters like Legolas or Kate from Lost, and creates useless moments for them that bog down the overall narrative. The highlight is Bilbo confronting Smaug, but that gets interrupted by a stretch of pointless action followed by an infuriating cliffhanger. The best part of the third one is the beginning with Smaug's attack on Laketown, which really should have been the end of the last movie. All that being said, this third and final part of The Hobbit isn't bad. It is more tightly paced and shorter than the previous two, and follows Thorin on his arc from greed and distrust to redemption and ultimate sacrifice, plus Bilbo plays a bigger part in affecting the outcome of events in this film than the others. None of The Hobbit movies are anywhere nearly as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but Battle of the Five Armies does a decent enough job of wrapping things up if you can get past some of its clunky moments. Now just wait another 10-20 years when Hollywood does a reboot on The Hobbit/LOTR, and that might make this look like brilliant film making.",1432944000,2,2044,4.587431693989071

There aren't many pages in this book devoted to this section of the story, but it's a shame that the filmmakers decided to interject their own crap into it. This movie is an incredible disservice to Tolkien, and it seems clear that crowd-pleasing and revenue are becoming greater motivation for Jackson's film making than his supposed love of the stories. If you loved this book and love everything else Tolkien, you may be able to enjoy this movie depending on how easily entertained you are. But if you have moderate to high standards based on the first trilogy or simply because of your disposition, prepare for a two hour slap in the face.

They wanted to write very good storybooks for children. So began ' The Hobbit '. But Prof. Tolkien (who taught ancient language at University) had survived BOTH world wars. So, what began as a children's book about little, country folk became something much, MUCH larger and more complicated as the author poured~out his wounded heart and shaken soul into the story that began so simply...
  I confess to you that i read his books as a boy (four of them) and altogether it would be like reading all of a King James Bible just to see what
happens...The Hobbit leaves his quiet, happy home to go with a group of dwarfs to get their mountain of gold from the dragon that took it.

Let's face it, it's the third movie so if you enjoyed the other two you're likely going to enjoy this also.  Even if you don't you'll probably want to watch it just to have the ""End"" of it all.

I'm still thinking I may need to have ""just one more"" stretch to completely be off the LOTR movies :)  Maybe watch the hobbit series back to back and then the LOTR - I'm sure that'll be a weekend well spent...",1432684800,,684,4.059701492537314

Those changes were necessary to make those stories filmable and bring characters to the screen.  The ridiculous changes made to the Hobbit were an assault to the sensitivity of any Tolkien fan.  No need for a new elf character.  A love interest for the dwarf.  REALLY!!!  Why were any dwarves left behind instead of going to the mountain?  Why the prolonged, agonizing and distorted battle with the dragon.  The original story was superior the what Peter Jackson concocted.  I used to be a Jackson fan.",1432598400,2,675,4.842105263157895

5268664,2,B0095HHLMO,"Peter Jackson absolutely mutilated the works of JRR Tolkien.  He did it in the Lord of the Rings, and he's done it again with The Hobbit.  The Hobbit is not a long book.  It's just over 300 pages.  How Jackson convinced anyone to turn this into a trilogy is a mystery to me.

Anyway, I thought the acting was superb.  The story was told well.  Special effects were quite over the top.  But, that's to be expected, I guess.  Still, I don't understand how Legolas and that Azog character even made it into any of the films.  I've read all the Lord of the Rings books, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion and I've never heard that either character was in The Hobbit.  Anyway, I'm not a huge nerd, but definitely I enjoy Tolkien's works.  I hate what Peter Jackson did to them.

However, If you're looking for outrageous story lines that sort of interconnect, and sort of don't; if you're looking for strange love triangles between two elves and one dwarf; and if you're looking for endless gratuitous violence then this is the film for you.",1432512000,,1034,4.494623655913978

While there was some holes in the end in regards to a lack of closure in my opinion, the story itself was sound and tied up the movies themselves. The movie was filled with amazing action, monsters and more. I know that with all of the action I was wondering how they would finish up this trilogy. Also, you wonder how the main villain will be taken care of...but you have to bide your time to wait and see what happens! In the end, this is a great movie that you will love watching! Also, get ready to turn up the surround sound as this movie has some amazing sound effects too!

As a purist and Tolkien enthusiast, Jackson's departure from the original Hobbit is almost inexcusable.  I did not enjoy the 3rd installment.  It left me unsatisfied and frustrated with a feeling I had been manipulated into spending $. In fact, since the story line of the 3rd installment was principally and solely the creation of the movie makers, it was unnecessarily superfluous to the events in the book.

Jackson took way too much time dealing with Dwarf King Thorin's ""dragon's gold sickness,""  and a ""new"" romance, (not in Tolkein's original story), between an elf and a dwarf, as ""filler"" material, to compensate for the lack of novel story line left in the poorly split up ""The Hobbit"" story.",1431907200,3,505,4.674157303370786

Some characters are very, VERY clearly CGI animated completely, and the ultimate battle scene was a jumbled mess, which is a shame, considering we waited the entirety of the first two movies to see it.

5268858,2,B0095HHLMO,"If you have never read The Hobbit, then please revel in the fact you don't know how inaccurate this movie is.  The movies on their own are very good, but are rife with inaccurate plots, characters that don't exist, are are missing sometimes pivotal parts of the original storyline.

Much like Peter Jackson's other interpretations of Tolkien's books, the most accurate part of the movie is at the end where you see ""Based on the book(s) of J.R.R. Tolkien"".  Mr. Jackson has homogenized Tolkien's books for mass consumption, and as a result ruined them.

I really wanted to like this movie.  I really wanted to like them all.  But with each movie he takes artistic license to a new level.  How disappointing.",1431561600,3,707,4.745901639344262

There was no real intimacy with the characters, so it was a strain to feel that anything, ultimately, was at stake (even the ""love story"" was handled at a remove, which should have been mush more compelling).So bored, it was fast approaching ""Man of Steel"" territory. Bored, bored, bored, yet still I buy the Blu-ray because of my absurd ""completist"" tendencies.

5268882,1,B0095HHLMO,"What an epic...waste of money. Peter Jackson really dropped the ball on the Hobbit trilogy, and this was the worst of them all. The acting was something you'd expect from a made-for-TV movie (think SciFi channel), the only exceptions being Martin Freeman and Ian McKellan, who are excellent.

The attempts at humor are infantile.

I felt no sorrow when any of the characters died, in fact I was pleased that I wouldn't have to watch them act any longer.

I get that Thorin loves the treasure and he's stubborn and wants it all to himself...you don't need to spend 45 minutes of the movie, in 27 different scenes, getting that point across. Kill him off already, and get the movie over with.

How the hell did the Orcs set up a giant windmill at the top of the mountain without anyone noticing?

The CGI sucked. Bring back the real live Orcs...these ones looked like something off a Sega Saturn Tomb Raider game.

I don't get sick of watching the Lord of the Rings movies, they're fantastic. I will never watch these movies again, they're pathetic.

Well done, Peter Jackson, you made your billions hocking crap this time.",1431475200,21,1121,4.659898477157361

I fell asleep during the Lord of the Rings movies my first go 'round, but did eventually finish them, and they were well done. And soooo long. The Hobbit series just seemed more like a story I could get into. This particular movie (Battle of the Five Armies) was well done. It was nice to not have Frodo and his awkward creepy smile not present in any of it. If I were to make suggestions on improving it, perhaps adding in a shield-weilding super soldier, a tech-genius iron-suited hero, or a gigantic hulk would add that finishing touch.

The Hobbit is the point of entry for most into Tolkien's universe and as such, is perfect in tone and length. The book tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, reluctant burglar. The movies tell the story of Thorin Oakenshield, dwarf king. The parts of the actual novel that are left, are pretty good, the parts that tell Thorin's story, while not made up from whole cloth (they are from The Silmarillion) don't add anything to the story. The Battle of Five Armies is literally a couple of hours of padding for the CGI contractors. I didn't see the first two in the theatre and had to view them at home in a kind of two day marathon to get ready for this one. I went and saw it suffering from Hobbit fatigue, and needless to say, didn't enjoy.

(Spoiler Alert)  I don't understand why Beorn the shape-shifter was so minimized.  In the film, he is shown on screen all of 3 seconds.  (End Spoiler Alert)  All in all I must say that I am not a fan of how the trilogy ended.

5269053,5,B0095HHLMO,"While I bought a pre-sold version of this video, I am quite satisfied with it.  It arrived on a very timely basis, and the DVDs are in excellent condition, in the original case. There is nothing at all wrong with the way the DVDs play, and I  believe that the price I paid was fair enough.

Regarding the film, I'm a fan of Peter Jackson's directing, and I loved all 3 movies in The Hobbit Series.  The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies was amazingly well done.  I am NOT the least bit disappointed with the fact that Jackson altered  the tale just a little bit to include a believable relationship between a dwarf and a female high elf warrior.  It was the one piece that I felt was missing from Tolkien's original tale.  The Battle of Five Armies is a grim tale with a tragic ending for the Dwarven Prince Thorin Oakenshield.  This was a more satisfying version of it, because it brought a little light into the darkness of the original tale.  Also, I think Peter Jackson added one other elucidating element to the original tale by adding in Galadriel's part in rescuing Gandalf from Sauron's keep.  I've always felt that J.R.R. Tolkien left out something there.  Gandalf needed help to get away from Sauron.  I don't care that purists would say Jackson toyed with the Grand Master's telling of the story of the Ring.  The Ring Mythology is the grandest of all our modern mythologies, but it is, after all, still a story.  It's not  The Bible (even if Tolkien DID base his storyline on the greater ancient Christian stories because he was a devout Catholic.  The Battle of Five Armies was marvelous to behold on the Big Screen (yes, I saw it there), but wonderful to view on my computer screen also.  Great video. Worth every penny I paid for it.",1430956800,,1744,4.5

Telling the story of the Necromancer sounded interesting but it was confusing and nothing was explained - it was just a quick CGI fight between people who suddenly showed up in the movie with no explanation.  The battle scenes were okay but they looked pretty fake after a while.  If you read the wonderful books spare yourself the pain of watching this movie. It's not like the LOTR movies where they generally followed the book and when they didn't it made sense why. In this movie you keep asking yourself ""why"".  Acting was just okay and the plot did not hold together well at all.  If I didn't pay $6 to watch I would have stopped half way through and wish that I did.",1430870400,3,801,4.496551724137931

5269083,4,B0095HHLMO,"Better than the second film of the series.  Some deviation from the book, but not as jarring as the changes in ""Desolation of Smaug"".  Tie ins to LOTR were done well without hurting the original story.",1430784000,,201,4.555555555555555

5269085,3,B0095HHLMO,"It may have made a lot of money, but I was honestly disappointed and expected more.  If you want to make a good series, how about ""The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant The Unbeliever or The Dragon Riders of Pern.",1430784000,,209,4.358974358974359
5269086,4,B0095HHLMO,"I am a very big fan of JRR Tolkien. I have read all of the books many times and watched the Lord of the Rings (LOR) movies many times as well. The first two Hobbit movies were great. The third movie was great as well. However, I think that the director went to far this time in going away from the real story line in the book. Also, some of the characters looked somewhat computer game like to me. The Hobbit movie overall doesn't have that buildup of suspense that the LOR has. It just has many battle scenes and lots of characters running around after each other. It doesn't have the glue that builds up the story to the great battle at the end. But overall it is hard to put these movies down. I love them all. It is great to have them on screen. One thing I do like is the director made the movie into a serious movie instead of a children's book. Despite the criticism Bilbo's character was played well and although Legolas was not in the Hobbit at all it was fun to see his character again. I do think the battle of Five Armies at the end could have been a little more solidified. Overall, a very good movie as usual. Not nearly as great as the LOR.",1430784000,2,1155,4.137777777777778

5269101,3,B0095HHLMO,"After being so disappointed in the second one, I forced myself to look at this one SOLELY as a generic fantasy movie, not part of the Lord of the Rings story.  It wasn't just the liberties that were taken with the story -- that second movie was just horrid.  But this review is not about that one.  Taken as a standard fantasy, this movie delivered a fun, action packed story with wizards, dragons, magic, and drawn out sword fights!  What's not to like?  I just cannot rate it very high because of the stupid factor (like the completely unnecessary love story inserted for who knows what reason) and how disappointing it was as a lifelong fan of the book.  I know even the Lord of the Rings trilogy departed some from the books, but the Hobbit movies just threw the book in the mud and stomped all over it.  Not bad if you force yourself to forget it is adapted from a book and just enjoy the fantasy action, though.",1430697600,,917,4.358823529411764

5269106,3,B0095HHLMO,"Aside from Peter Jackson milking the much shorter story into three major productions and copycatting TLOR beyond the point of being ludicrous, it is an extremely well made and visually stunning flick with acts of over the top action and heroic deeds, worth seeing merely for that.",1430697600,,280,4.9787234042553195

5269111,1,B0095HHLMO,"Really horrible.  The dragon dies immediately, then the rest of the ' plot' is a series of battles that have no logical flow or focal point.  Not based on the book in any way.  The cgi is even phoned in, and lacks the attention to realism of the lord of the rings series.  The use of war ram by the dwarves is a clear ripoff of blizzard's warcraft universe.

It was a big disappointment.",1430697600,13,387,4.175675675675675

5269125,3,B0095HHLMO,"Well, it's better than the other Hobbit movies. Is that saying much?

Now, the Lord of The Rings trilogy are going to be timeless classics, like The Ten Commandments, or Casablanca. The Hobbit movies have just fallen short. The book was so good. As usual, too much CGI. Unfortunately, Orlando Bloom's face is noticeably older in this story, which takes place many years before the LoTR. Sometimes things like that can't be helped, but it's quite noticeable.

This installment has less CGI, or it has less of a feel of it, than the first two. I, therefore, give it three stars, as opposed to the two I gave the other two.

They set the bar for quality too high in the LoTR trilogy, and these Hobbit movies just don't live up to it. The story, acting, and casting are all excellent, however.",1430611200,,789,4.542253521126761

I always purchase the extended version, preferably, over the ""special edition"" because of the uncut content.  I don't use or have  Blue Ray and hoped I wouldn't be forced to buy more equipment just to see my uncut movie. It sounds like the decision was made for the benefit of the video manufacturer rather than the loyal consumer. There's a lot of that thinking going around these days...

5269151,2,B0095HHLMO,"Argh!  I'm a big fan of the most of the Tolkein movies that Jackson has directed but I have to say this was a really disappointing experience.  He had a real opportunity to find a new angle on many of the dynamics that have been presented MANY times over in the first trilogy: huge battles, treachery, the eagles as Deus Ex Machina saving the day at the last minute.  The choreography of the battles in a lot of places just really come off as mechanical.  The master's stooge is a weak character who gets way too much attention. His incompetence and buffoonery as well as the seeming hope that he provides comic relief ala Pythonesque drag at the end just miss the mark completely.  The worms and big horn sheep...ugh.? The dwarf elf love story?  Unsatisfying.  Why didn't the dwarf confront Thorin with the fact that an elf saved his life? I actually don't have a problem, like a lot of people, who seem to fundamentally think that this should never have been stretched to a trilogy.  The back stories from the Silmarillion hold enough material.  I liked the first two Hobbit movies but this just really seems like mess because Jackson took his minds eye off of the humanity and acting necessary to provoke emotion, such as Serkis' performance as Gollum.  Like George Lucas, he had to ""outdo"" himself and he suffers the same consequence by not finding a fundamentally different perspective that would enlighten rather than bore.",1430611200,,1429,4.7028112449799195

5269169,1,B0095HHLMO,"After faithfully buying a ticket for the past 2 years, my friends and I wrapped up the Hobbit Trilogy this past December with ""The Battle of the Five Armies."" The original subtitle was ""There and Back Again,"" and I should have realized how significant the change was.  Almost 3 hours of battle sequences designed for the ADD 3-D popcorn movie goers. Very little characterization and plot; and why should there be? It was all used up in the last 2 films. Anyone who's read ""The Hobbit"" knows there's nothing left after Smaug is defeated, and that happens within the first 20 minutes of this film. The rest is deals with Thorin's obsession with the Arkenstone and--you guessed it--the battle of five armies over the Dwarves' treasure horde.

No amount of Silmarillion padding can save this film. And please don't get me wrong, I like the stuff Peter Jackson added. But if you're going to bring in new characters that go nowhere, what is the point? Why create Tauriel as a love interest for Kili when we know Kili is going to die? And what about Radagast? Great development in the first film, but he just fizzles out here. Everything takes a backseat to the battle sequences. But unlike ""Return of the King"" where we knew the battles would eventually lead to a solid resolution, there is no such thing here. Oh sure, Bilbo will go back home and horde the ring, but there is no real closure since this film is meant to loop back to ""Fellowship of the Ring"" anyway. They even recycled the credit sequence from ""Return of the King."" Only differences is the ending to The Hobbit did not have the same song or emotional impact.

Ideally, The Hobbit should have been 2 films, or at the most 2 and a half (Half would have a cute joke since we're talking about Hobbits). As it stands I feel like Jackson should owe an apology to Tolkien fans. All this time Jackson claimed to love the material, yet he sells out with a mindless sword and sorcery ""epic."" Considering Peter's track record as a director, this is likely the last time he'll bamboozle the public into forking over so much cash.",1430524800,44,2078,4.565683646112601

I haven't read The Hobbit since I was a kid, so my review of the movie isn't based on how faithfully it follows the book, but solely on its qualities as a film.  It was certainly fast paced for the most part, but it never rose to a level of suspense or intensity that put me on the edge of my seat, nor did it drive me to care very deeply about any of its characters.  I can't put my finger on what was specifically lacking, but it just seemed entirely superficial ... like I was watching from a distance, detached from the action and indifferent to the fates of the characters instead of being drawn in and emotionally involved.  I also felt that the CGI effects were glaringly obvious, and perhaps it was this artificiality that kept me feeling disconnected throughout most of the film.",1430524800,,1002,4.336898395721925

When I received this I was happily supriesed their were three discs.  With one whole disc for special features.  Now I base special features on the extended version discs of the first three movies.  And what can you say about thsoe?  They were the best bonus features of any movie Ive ever seen  only surpassed by the bonus features on the Young Indiana Jones box sets.  So was expecting  the same quality and quanity... Nope  maybe half and hour  and another half hour of billy boyd and his stupid song.  Now come to find out  there will be extended versions come out later in the year.  What really bothered me was the first two movies had fairly good special features  not on same level as first trilogy  but comparable.  This third movies special features is  subpar.  The movie its self  I would have to say  was not nearly as good as I would have hoped  a bit to much CGI  especially  Billy Conaly looked really fake.  And the fact that he had to have a boss fight for each main character  bothered me.  And never really expains some of the decesions of the charcters at the end.

Amazon Prime's sub par streaming service which inexplicably downgrades your viewing experience to SD, really makes Jackson's bloated use of CGI effects pop out as a blocky, blotchy abomination which no fan of cinema or Tolkien should be forced to endure. I don't understand why Amazon Prime's video service does not allow downloading or at least buffering but their technical decisions to save a few dollars have made their service worthless and unusable.",1430524800,5,580,5.052083333333333

That being said, it's a good movie that sums up a great story. As a long time LOTR and Hobbit fan, in a way this was like an end to years of a much enjoyed period of my life and it was bittersweet.

5269191,1,B0095HHLMO,"In summary...this movie has very little to do with the fictional occurences in the book and as usual with Peter Jackson there is far too much emphasis on violence and not enough on the charaters. The addition to the absurd character of Alfred was almost unbearable - why Peter WHY?!  We don't see Thorin buried or see Dain crowned the new king!  But we do get an idiotic, poorly acted love seen between a female elf (never in the book) and a dwarf!  Again...why Peter Jackson?!!  In addition you get to watch Lagolas defy gravity again and again and again.  The ""stair case"" scene was utterly stupid...did Jackson mean to make a comedy?
So this last movie in Jackson's, already obscenely long trilogy  about one book(?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), was by far the worst.  What a pathetic money grab this trilogy has turned out to be.  Lousy business practice...I'm voting with my wallet and never seeing a Peter Jackson movie again.

Like the Lord of the Rings films, he has touched on some key thematic aspects of Tolkein's books.  This, despite the obvious departures and increased action scenes, the essence of Tolkein's Hobbit remains.

Special effects were great! Although the size of the armies was WAY overblown and there was an exhausting amount of fighting. Saug's death was well done!

To me, the highlight of the film was the battle of the White Council with Sauron and the Ring Wraiths. Althougth, I do not agree with the statement made in the extra features that Galadriel ""lost much of her power"" in that encounter with Sauron. In the Fellowship of the Ring, she was still capable of taking the One Ring for herself. It was her CHOICE to not take the ring, not a loss of power.

Those kinds of reviews I usually just pass on by.  I prefer to just read whether someone liked the movie or not... and I liked this installment the best out of the three Hobbit movies.  The 3D effects were pretty good too (mostly arrows and spears being shot at your eyes).  The acting was as expected along with the directing etc.

5269356,1,B0095HHLMO,"Honestly I enjoyed the first Hobbit film (with a few reservations) and hated the sequel, and I was hoping the third and final film wasn't going to be a decent conclusion to the series... and yeah, it was an epic disappointment. The biggest problem with the Battle of Five Armies is just how BORING so much of it is. There are too many characters, too many convoluted and watery sub-plots and just far too much CGI mess to really make this all that interesting. It seemed like there was more of elf leader Thranduil in the film than there was of Bilbo! And Gandalf is absent or incapacitated through most of the film too, other than a brief appearance swinging his useless magic staff around, then he, too, disappears for huge sections of the movie. Meanwhile mostly useless characters like Beorn and Radagast just drop out of the sky (literally) with no further character development, just as special effect extras.

And speaking of special effects, Five Armies had to be the single worst of the CGI of the Hobbit films (if not the 6 Tolkien films) with far too many scenes of digital armies in CTL+C CTL+V perfection. It was about as convincing as the CG battle sequences from the equally awful Star Wars trilogy prequels (part of me thinks that Jackson was aiming a little too closely at copying George Lucas' by taking a beloved original series and subsequently ruining it with three breath-takingly bad prequels. He definitely followed suit with this.)

There's far too much moodly lingering, dour music and gloomy dialog, such as with gold-obsessed Thorin occupying far too much of the film, and yet we get goofy, ever-so-brief character expositions of Legolas (guess things worked out with him, Dad and Mom, huh?) - and seriously, Orlando Bloom can apply as much foundation and cover-up as he likes, but the honest truth is that he looks like he's in his 40's now and considerably more aged than the spritely youth he depicted in the original LOTR. I'll say it again, I loved the original films, but bringing all these characters back again was just silly - especially the goofy battle royale with Gandalf, Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman. Seriously, you could have pumped in the Mortal Kombat techno music for that scene and it would have been equally as ridiculous (""Fight!"" da-da-da-da duh-da da-da-da...)

Finally a note on the music: nothing really notable here. Occasional hints of the ""Shire music/This is my fathers world"" were appreciated, but the rest of the music just seemed cold and depressing (plus the sad violin music when humans return to a desolated city has been done already with Rohan and now it just seems cheesy. Part of me thinks that if you looked through all of Howard Shore's sheet music you wouldn't find many pages, if any, described as being played ""light and airy"". Maybe more scenes like that, and more music, would have given a little more life this this cold and boring turkey.

Terrible ending to the series, but one good thing is the incredibly hilarion ""How it Should Have Ended"" video that captures many of my thyoughts perfectly, including Legolas and his physics-defying ""Super Mario"" antics at the end of the film. If you hated the film as much as I did, look that video up.",1430006400,2,3219,4.773788150807899

The best parts of the films; Freeman's Bilbo, Cumberbatch's Smaug, the desperation in Bard's futile attempts to bring Smaug down as he incinerates Laketown. Unfortunately not enough to recommend the whole series.

First, the decision to expand the book into a trilogy was a huge misstep. There are so many unnecessary scenes and characters in these movies! The decision to divide the film into a trilogy ultimately victimizes this film the most. This ""film"" is basically just a bunch of actors fighting digital orcs. There is no structure at all really. This should have been the third act of a single three-hour movie, Peter Jackson is so easily distracted he seems to completely miss the point of the Hobbit. Martin Freeman is probably the most perfectly cast Bilbo that any of us could hope for, but by the time Bilbo says goodbye to the surviving company at the end, it feels completely false because Peter Jackson didn't invest enough time with the dwarves that don't die. It's such a pity because Martin Freeman is so great. Honestly, we don't need to check in with Gandalf every five minutes. We don't need Alfrid Lickspittle at all. We don't need to make every single connection we possibly can to LOTR. We don't need Elrond, Galadriel, Legolas, Saruman, Ratagast, or even Sauron in this film! We don't need to spend that much time on Bard's honor because we got it already! There is so much drag. We could be spending more time with Bilbo and the Dwarves! Peter Jackson created so much filler for this trilogy that it, unbelievably, feels somewhat incomplete because he didn't stay focused on what was really important in The Hobbit. Just a huge, disappointing, expensive, and badly aimed effort.",1430006400,,1569,4.709090909090909

5269385,4,B0095HHLMO,"Good movie; both the Battle sequence and the opening dragon sequence are excellent in 3D.  In between those high points the film is effectively character driven with Martin Freeman (again) providing an exceptional performance.  I highly recommend the 3D version for this; effects are a bit subtle but more sophisticated than in the previous films. Oddly this film does't seem as painfully long as the other two parts, or as ""LotR"" either. The BluRay itself includes a couple of short documentaries about the 6 films and the 17 (?) years of filming, both of which are superficial but fun; interviews with cast members from both trilogies. Enough to make we want to watch ""LotR"" again? Almost.",1430006400,4,691,4.948275862068965

5269391,4,B0095HHLMO,"I have been a fan of the LOR series and the Hobbit series but I do think that The Hobbit movies have been stretched a bit too long with its series of movies and should have been consolidated.  As with all the movies, the special effects and scenery are brilliantly done.  The actors do well in their roles that they have been long comfortable with.  I enjoyed watching the movie but do feel that the climactic scene was near the beginning of the movie with the dragon and that the rest of the battle was a bit anticlimactic with a sort of ho-hum kind of ending.  If you are a fan of the series, then you will enjoy it but this final installation is not as strong of a finish as I would have liked.

The action sequences are fantastic, especially the battle formations for the elf and the dwarf armies. Also the ending lays the ground work for the Lord of the Rings especially for anyone who has not read the books. I can hardly wait for my youngest grandchildren to get a bit older  because so many valuable life lessons can be to learned from these films. This film produces enjoyment on so many levels for people of all ages, there is romance, there is comedy, there is drama and of course my favorite there is action.

5269466,3,B0095HHLMO,"The original book never portrayed the ring as evil, nor did it foreshadow the connection that it had to the Dark Lord.
That was because it never in "" The Hobbit"" had any relevance to the plot. Tolkien never imagined that the ring would be so important before he went on to write The Lord of the Rings.

The Desolation of Smaug is constantly tormenting us with the Rings corrupting influence on Bilbo Baggins, while never once making mention of how useful the power was to him. The Ring is made so important that it threatens to overshadow Smaug as the real villain.

We are given to believe that Sauron is hoping to make a bargain with the dragon, like this simple story about adventure is subtly hinting at war and political tensions. All of that chemistry is supposed to be left in The Lord of the Rings where it belongs.

""The Hobbit"" is supposed to be a simple story about Bilbos quest to recover Thorins lost birthright without all this foreshadowing. These are 3 mediocre Warner Brothers Movies disguised with massive amounts of eye candy from a 995 million dollar production cost.

Worse is the Directors Peter Jackson's love of seamless violence... the beheadings, arrows through the head and out another, the balletic throat slashing like a sick video game.

The violence is horrid. Think about how many millions of little kids and pre-teens see these movies and just get numb to the violence. It is sad.

What was a innocent children's book by J.R.R.Tolkien; Peter Jackson has turned into a R-rated meaningless exercise in senseless violence with very little story line.

The Director Peter Jackson took a lovely children's book ""The Hobbit"" and drug it out into 3 horrifying long action films of meaningless violence.

One important complaint is the crude references in these Hobbit movies such as Bofur's ' have the balls for it' reference to croquet in AUJ and Tauriel's finding 'nothing' comment to Kili about searching down his trousers. In this case I also find it disrespectful to the author J.R.R.Tolkien who lived a clean and respectful life and wrote ""The Hobbit"" as a book for children.

I am saddened that anyone would do this to such a fine book. Along the way the hobbit lost its Magic.",1429833600,8,2210,4.749347258485639

All the loose ends tied up nicely with some subtle tie-ins to the future LOTR story.  I'll admit though, I'm a little confused on which army is the fifth one but that didn't stop me from enjoying the show.  Waiting now for the Blu-ray extended version box set.",1429747200,,418,4.32051282051282
5269521,4,B0095HHLMO,"This trilogy finishes on a reasonable high. I found the first two films frustrating and ponderous. Here at last the climax brings action and drama. It opens with the riled Smaug attacking Rivertown and concludes with the epic battle for the dragon/dwarf hoard under the mountain. Aside from the combat action, there is also Thorins battle to retain his sanity in the face of the stunning but tainted wealth he has gained. I thought this was conveyed fairly well. Martin Freeman as Bilbo is the standout again, being courageous and decent amidst the greed and danger. Some scenes are still bloated or overlong but at least theres some interesting battle action with a few surprises. The dwarves are finally able to show some deadly fighting skills and I liked the look of the elves too. I wouldnt be alone in thinking the three films made would be better condensed into two but it is what it is. Recommended 3.5 stars",1429747200,,916,4.73125

I honestly just didn't really CARE about any of the characters, didn't particularly feel afraid if they were in danger, etc. For the visual appeal, there was a lot of pretty scenes, but during the battles, I had a hard time keeping dwarf armor distinct from Orc, because it was a huge mass of confusion.

Lots of predictable plot holes and the worst dialogue ever in a Tolkien fantasy movie. I am so disappointed. Not even the very cool Legolas stunts at the end could save this clunker.

5269674,2,B0095HHLMO,"The last time I wrote a review, it ended up getting trolled, because someone had a problem that my opinion was not the same as his. So before reading this understand this is one man's opinion. The first two Hobbit movies were done well, this last one felt rushed, and unfinished. Many questions were not answered. Now image Return of the King with Frodo, and Sam sitting their talking, and then imagine the movie just ending. I am pretty sure the response to that movie would not have been positive. This is what happened with this film, they ended it without a proper wrap. First things first, you are introduced to a new character called Dain, the complete meaning, of what it is to be a dwarf. They show him, then at the end of the battle, they do not tell you what happened to him during the last section of the battle. I also read the book and the battle scene felt like something taken out of the Heart of swarm Starcraft 2, rather then what was in the book. If I remember correctly it was a frontal assault, with Humans, Dwarfs, and elfs fighting up hill. Also if I remember correctly the reason why they were having such a tough battle was because the Orcs used warg Riders during the battle, and allot of them. So watching this understand this was one of Hollywoods normal blunders rush things, and don't hold true to form. Also they ever explain in the movie why these orcs were deadly and organized, compared to the orcs you see in lord of the rings. Those orcs were horde like but not organized, they just mowed everything down by sheer numbers. To top it off they completely changed the Nine compared to the ones you see in Lord of the rings, and give no real explanation. Another loose end never tied up they mention Gondor soldiers on the Mordor wall, and your left with the question wait whats the Mordor wall? Not to mention they never show them being warned by Saruman. Something else that bothered me too. In lord of the rings the impression you get is the Elves are a strong, disciplined race, and are not known for running away from Orcs. Yet in this film the Elf King tries to retreat.  I have to say too many strings left unfinished, too many questions not answered. This film reminded me of someone making a movie not to hold true to form but rather score a quick buck with what may be popular. Badly done plain and simple. This is again the opinion of one man.",1429488000,2,2385,4.383747178329571
5269675,4,B0095HHLMO,Good movie,1429401600,,10,4.5
5269676,1,B0095HHLMO,"I was eager to see the third movie in the series, and I planned to buy the extended version of all three as soon as they became available.

On the plus side, there's at least one good scene. Also, when the actors are allowed to act, they are excellent. Quite a lot of the material was based on Tolkien. And even some of the departures from Tolkien had potential for being very good.

Unfortunately, the movie doesn't work. The pacing is bad, the timing is off, the special effects are silly, and although a few of the departures from the book are enriching, most add nothing and are so pointless or unbelievable that they seem like slapstick.

The Battle of the Five Armies made the story so overblown, trite, and silly that I won't be buying the set. And that makes me sad.",1429401600,3,774,4.398601398601398
5269677,2,B0095HHLMO,"There were a few moments in this movie that actually worked, but overall, it was terrible.  The great battle which is the focus of this movie does not even have a definable end.  I have no idea what caused it to end.  The side plot with the White Council felt like a cheap 80s action flick--complete with one-liners.  This movie was definitely more composed than the previous one, at very least.  Needless to say, no care was taken to represent any of Tolkien's world build or his characters.  This, however, continues from the previous films.  Overall, though, it failed to deliver in the dramatic moments, it had virtually no closure, and it was a sloppy world build.  As a book-to-movie adaption, it was a desecration.  Nothing Tolkien considered important or emphasized is present in this film.  This would include the focus being on Bilbo's development as a person.  Tolkien's world is unrecognizable in this besides a few standards and the same names and terms.  The characters are completely changed from his as well.  This is the conclusion of a poorly done trilogy, better than the other two films, but still quite painful.  It is good for a laugh, should you want to watch a movie for that.",1429401600,2,1200,4.734299516908212

The back stories were expanded in a way that, to me, enhanced the experience over the books.  Anyone who enjoys a good story and a good movie should, if they haven't already, should watch them all.  I read all of the books long before they decided to make into a movie and I was a little doubtful of how well they could adapt them.  By expanding to three films they were able to capture the stories much better than trying to get it all in 2 or 3 hours.  You should watch all three in the Hobbit series to really understand the story.  You will not be disappointed.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I.",1429401600,,714,4.086330935251799

Don't worry, there's no plot in this movie to spoil because there is no plot to the movie (or very little).  Basically, the entire 2 1/2 hour movie is war, destruction, and killing, with no plot behind it.  If that's your cup of tea, then go ahead and rent it.  (But do yourself a favor and wait until the movie has been out for a while and rent it for a lower price).

Even though this movie has received quite a few positive reviews, I suspect the reviews are only from people who regularly attend Hobbit parties, conventions, or other social gatherings.

But I became hopeful about Peter Jackson's success in bringing them to life in a medium for all to really see.  We can revisit these trilogies over and over.  Tolkien, an Oxford aristocrat, used fantasy to tell a story rich in references to social history that with greater experience and maturity of a nation, its citizens come to identify with.  The scene of Lady Galadriel vs. Saruman, of this particular motion picture is a metaphor for my actual experience in our larger, contemporary world.  This is great.

5269831,5,B0095HHLMO,"J.R.R. Tolkien adapted into a series of Sci_Fi films about the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, is going to be tough to hate, but needs to be quite well done and consistent excellence through story flow, editing, cast, performances, scenery, costuming, special effects and keep fans willing to remain loyal while the years pass while we wait for the next film release on DVD; to get me to give a 5 star review.  ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" scores a home run in all categories required for me to give a 5 star review, right down to being a little clich and predictable.  I enjoy films and character performances that let me hate the bad guy and cheer for the good guy.  I am hard of hearing these days, and also appreciate DVD versions that include subtitles.",1429142400,,770,4.446808510638298
5269832,5,B0095HHLMO,"Much, much better than the second installment. Story is better developed with more complexity and genuine suspense. Gives you everything you would want in a Tolkein story: Bravery, epic battles with evil opponents, a love story, the great Gandolph rising to the occasion with his large, heroic heart--very moving and just a great story. The elves--their leaders and the elf army--are highlighted and just awesome; and Legolos is thrilling and inspiring---his bravery and love and fighting skills in an EPIC battle he has with the evil troll leader will leave you speechless. A female elf plays a strong role here and does a fantastic job--she is another great, heroic character. Bilbo has almost a secondary part, but that was okay with me--he shines when needed. I thought the acting was excellent throughout and the CGI effect that people didn't like is not that apparent if you watch on TV. I read some very negative reviews and didn't love the first Hobbit installment and especially not the second movie, but this one is way better, believe me. I think it begins to approach the Lord Of the Rings movies in scope (almost), suspense, rich cinematography and heroism and just the plain old good over evil metaphors that inspired us all years ago.",1429056000,,1249,4.924170616113744

This was a bit slow getting going, but it literally had me jerking around in my chair  with a pulse rate of someone working out like mad.  Full of morals and scruples and endearing moments.  I loved it if only because it FULLY entertained me. Something difficult to do with today's half hearted Sci-fi films.  In the end, I was fully satisfied with no questions or contemplations.  The kind of movie to watch if you want great, fabulous special effects and to have nothing else in your mind the entire time.  True HD and surround sound does help as well.  The soundtrack was terrific, no trouble hearing the speech audio. Good family film if the battle scenes are not an issue, and I wouldn't think they would be for all those that play video games that show more violence than this does.",1429056000,,897,4.355421686746988

5269848,3,B0095HHLMO,"The entire ""Hobbit"" series. My biggest problem was the attempted linkage of ""The Hobbit"" films to ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. It wasn't in the book, ""The Hobbit"" was much lighter in tone than ""LotR"".

But the thing I hated the most was the dwarves, with their Disneyfied make-up and costumes. It was stupid and ugly.",1429056000,2,321,4.631578947368421
5269849,3,B0095HHLMO,"Id have to say over all I did like the movie but with some complaints.  They took a section of the book that is only about 20 pages and turned it into a two hour movie.  How did they do this?  By creating a ridiculous love interest between one of the dwarves and an elf princess, and they dragged out the battle sequences to a pretty outlandish degree.  Another small criticism I have of Peter Jacksons versions of all the Tolkien books is he takes away the nobility of all the characters.  Example, in the Hobbit, Bard is the descendent of a line of kings and leaders, he knows it, and he acts and leads like a king of old.  But in the movie, they turn him into a vagabond outcast who unwittingly and somewhat unwillingly falls into a hero's role.
He did the same thing with Aragorn in the lord of the rings.  He also does it with the King of the elves of Mirkwood.  He makes him a weird angry petty leader who just wants some famous necklace from Smaug's hoard.  Lastly, he makes the people of lake town into a bunch of really useless helpless whiners, rather than the strong hard working descendants of a once great kingdom as they are portrayed in the book.  All of these subtle changes in the characters to me, cheapens the characters and the story and turns a great book into just a simple action movie.",1429056000,,1309,4.3061224489795915

It was truly good, and if you've watched the others, then you have to watch this to feel complete in Mr. Jackson's world of Middle Earth, but he went a bit off course overall in his Hobbit series , adding things that weren't even in the book, and also subtracting other elements that should have been included.

5269982,5,B0095HHLMO,"The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies concludes the epic journey of Bilbo Baggins of the Shire and his legion of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield, under the guidance of Gandalf the Wizard, with a powerful, emotional finish. It begins right where part II left off, and wastes little time building towards the incredible war that is about to take place for the treasures of the Lonely Mountain.
Thorin must decide if he should live in his Grandfather's footsteps and horde all of the gold that is rightfully his, or listen to his solemn friends at the end of their dangerous journey to reclaim their home. The Bard and his townsfolk want only enough of the treasure to rebuild their fire scorned town, while the Elves want their cut of the diamonds, and yet the Orcs and Goblins, led by Azog the Defiler, wish to claim this Mountain fortress for its strategic position in the land, under their master Sauron, who is confronted by Galadriel, Gandalf, Elrond and Saruman. When the Dwarf army enters the fray, war becomes inevitable despite the pleas of the burglar Hobbit, Bilbo and his golden ring of invisibility. Tamriel (smoothly weaved into the story and an original character not in the J.R.R. Tolkien Book) lends her support along with the expert marksman Legolas, as she must decide if Kili, the Dwarf she is taken with, will be worth pursuing during this great war.
The expertly filmed battle endures through most of the film, yet keeps the audience compelled as we fight alongside our heroes and villains, while their stories unfold one last time.",1428796800,,1554,4.802238805970149
5269983,1,B0095HHLMO,"Simple story stretched out into too long of a movie series.

The movie at times was plodding and drawn-out for me. One minute the battle is in front of the mountain. Next minute its up on the hill where Azog is. How did Thorin get there? Why all of a sudden there are these ram-like animals that suddenly appeared in the middle of the battle that carried him there!  I will quote the reviewer Archangel: ""Too many disconnected battle scenes at the expense of real story telling.""

The Kili-Tauriel storyline to me detracted from other parts of the movie, such as the Dwarves themselves. Sure we see a lot of Thorin and Kili but not much of the rest of the company that set out to Erebor. Dain reminded me of the Scotsman from Samurai Jack.

The movie at times was predictable. Legolas fighting on the crumbling fallen tower/bridge reminded me of the Goblin fight in the Goblin caves in the first Hobbit movie and also reminded me of the crumbling stairs in Moria in The Fellowship of the Ring. Legolas jumping on a troll to collapse the tower was similar to Legolas jumping on the troll and the Oliphant in the Lord of the Rings movies. The death scene between Thorin and Bilbo was too similar to Boromir and Aragorn. An Orc lifts his weapon up to deal a seemingly final blow to Tauriel yet is intercepted before the blow is struck. Gee, didn't see that coming. As the Orcs are heading toward the line of Dwarves a recalcitrant Thranduil doesn't send his troops forward. Yet just before the Orcs hit the Dwarve line the Elves jump in at the last second. Gee, didn't see that coming either. Azog is floating under the ice apparently dead yet fights back. Gee, REALLY didn't see that coming.

Last I saw of the Arkenstone it was in Bard's hand. What happened to it? How was the treasure finally settled? Why was Beorn dropped into the fight almost like someone said ""Ooops, we forgot him. Let's just stick him somewhere"".

The part where Thranduil told Legolas to seek out Arathorn and Strider was sooooooo redundant. With Gollum, Bilbo, Gandolf, the Ring, etc. we really needed yet another reminder that this story is connected to The Lord of the Rings?

Glad this series is over.",1428796800,10,2179,4.557544757033248

5269988,1,B0095HHLMO,"Like the other Hobbit movies, this is a total embarrassment and denigration of the brilliant imagination and literary prowess of the genius that was JRR Tolkien. These film makers should be ashamed at how they have mutilated a work of such great intelligence and erudition, and turned it into nothing but cheap dumbed down pulp imagery and inane savagery for the brainless and thoughtless masses of the 21st century. Someone one-day may do justice to the great book, but this movie and the other two should never have been allowed to happen. The bottom line for these movies was not the story line, or even respect for JRR Tolkien, it was simply to make money... money... and more money... for a movie production company - full stop. And as such, these movies are nothing more than a tribute to mammon, rather than to a great man.

It's not damaged it just fell out of its holder. Many of these cases do this, so i have just saved another 100 ""idiots"" from writing the same incorrect review. The movie is stellar in my opinion, if you hold it to the book then yeah you will be disjointed. So think of it as a movie and not the book you read. Now i'm going to compare it to RoTK which in my mind held thee most epic battle at the citadel. Unfortunately this movie is based too much around the dwarven city, which i will not spoiler if some are reading this even-though its been known since the first movie. If it spanned away from that a little more i'd give it a 6/5. Also watch the special features, some amazing things in it! Peace!",1428796800,,899,4.172413793103448

OK for action (not in the book), OK for elf-dwarf relations (not in the book). It was basically a 2 1/2 hour long battle scene. Honest Trailers called it ""The Bloating of the Five Pages"" which is how many pages of the story this covers, and it's true. It's bloated, unimaginative, and removes any trace of the magic of the book.

5270025,2,B0095HHLMO,"The movie is pretty bad.

All three of the Hobbit movies are pretty bad, though.

The storyline itself is weak.  The characters are weak.  The CGI and action sequences are strong, but as we have seen so often - effects and action aren't any substitute for a weak story and character development.

A coworker of mine said ""no, I thought the movie was *awesome*"".  I asked her to name some of the main characters.  Other than those who were in LOTR, she couldn't really remember any.  Me either... character development was incredibly weak.  I had no personal connection to any of them, whereas in LOTR, who could forget Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn, Boromir, Smeagol, Sam, Frodo, Bilbo... the character development was strong and you felt you knew the characters.

It's largely Tolkien's fault, that's why The Hobbit was never 1/100th as popular as LOTR was.  But Jackson and the writers sure didn't fix the problem - not by a long shot.

Enjoyed the music, the Dwarves escapade, the Trolls, the Orcs and Wargs, the elegance of the Elfish army with their precision movements, the battle with the dragon, and the masterful way in which the story moved forward. Although the female elf was not in The Hobbit as written by Tolkien, it did add another element of interest (the forbidden love between elf and dwarf) to the story. And it gave an explanation for why Legolas left his home to seek out Aragorn. This leads perfectly into the Fellowship of the Ring.
One thing about the story is that though Gandalf is supposed to be a great wizard, he never (or rarely) uses his magic. Why does a wizard need a sword when he can hurl fireballs and magical incantations at them using his staff? I never understood that aspect.

We watched the 3D Blu ray, and as I've stated it was impressive. Both the visuals and the sound is top quality.

Story-wise, I think all three movies drag a bit, and would be a better viewer experience if they had been cut down to two movies. But that's a quibble. The movies do hit all the high points of the original story, and the acting is top notch.

Certain battle scenes are far better choreographed than in LOTR and it's a real pleasure seeing Legolas as a far more commanding and imposing character.

Galadriel is finally a fully developed character whose true nature and prowess were only hinted at in LOTR, echoing her link to the First Age stories in The Silmarillion. frankly I like this Bilbo far better than the big doe eyed Frodo of LOTR.
Honestly, with all due respect, I think Martin Freeman (Bilbo) is a more gifted actor who delivers a far more captivating and insightful performance than Elijah Wood.

This closing of the story of Thorin Oakenshield and the Arkenstione has a depth and dimension I never expected and the battle scenes are tighter as well and evoke more genuine passion and emotional involvement than those of LOTR.

The interpersonal relationships are also well developed and portrayed with a great deal more subtlety and depth than I found in LOTR.
It was very clever device the in way we see how Saruman finally succumbs to his own ambitions.

Overall this is a cinematic masterpiece that skillfully managed very difficult and intricate details and in Jackson's own way and vision, managed to give us a satisfying and brilliant production of a literary epic.",1428537600,,1329,4.941704035874439

Look, I understand most of Peter Jackson's decisions. Most people watching THE HOBBIT have never read the book, so, OK, THE HOBBIT uses the same authorial voice as Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS. It would startle most viewers if THE HOBBIT used the cheerful voice of the novel.

I understand Jackson's desire to inject more female roles into the story (Tauriel and Galadriel). Yes, the original story is mostly ""boys go camping."" (Although, I've argued, we don't really know that all of Thorin's company are male. It's the beards, you see.)

But the heart of the story is Bilbo's transformation from a useless country squire to an actual hero and I felt this got lost in the movie. A shorter, more personal film, that focused on Bilbo rather than big set-piece battles, would have told his story better.",1428364800,6,811,4.7785714285714285

5270189,1,B0095HHLMO,"The Hobbit: The Battle of Five armies is the most unfortunate installment in the Hobbit trilogy because its an all around bad movie but there is no disguising it behind its fancy CGI. The simple problem with this movie is taking the final climatic battle of the original book and trying to stretch out the events until it feels like a complete story with a solid beginning, middle and end. This movie has fallen short in all three areas.

This is first and foremost because the first ten minutes of the movie resolves the cliffhanger created by the last Hobbit movie. Smaug has descended upon Lake Town and is now burning everything in his path. Only Bard stands a chance against the beast. Unfortunately for both Benedict Cumberbatch and Steven Fry, both of their characters are killed off before the title of the movie is even revealed. It is hardly worth listing them as main characters in this installment, I am forced to think.

But of course, the real story of the third Hobbit movie is about everything that happens after Smaug is defeated. Thorin and his company of dwarfs have finally reclaimed their home under the mountain. Bilbo is happy for them but has yet to reveal that hes found the Arkan Stone, which is the symbol of Thorins divine right to rule as king. And seeing as the people of Lake Town have lost their homes, and the Mirkwook elves have a score to settle with those dwarves, both inhabitants march upon the Lonely Mountain to settle debts with them.

Meanwhile, Gandalf is set free from his brief imprisonment by Sauron just in time to warn the armies that the orc chief Azog is planning an assault of his own. The Battle of Five Armies then goes on to reveal how the adventures of Bilbo and the 13 dwarves have effected the many people they have come in contact with. This ultimately concludes the adventure, giving Bilbo a remarkable story to tell on his trip home. Unfortunately... the movie isn't quite that good.

The amount of foreshadowing the entire trilogy has given to The Lord of the Rings is something thats continually been ruining the magic of the story being told in the present. The second Hobbit movie brought a lot of attention to the corrupting influence of the ring Bilbo found in Gollums cave. In the third Hobbit movie, this same role is played by the Arkan Stone instead. This goes to prove that all the foreshadowing in the second movie could have been replaced with present-tense story telling. Just one of the many examples of how poorly constructed this trilogy is.

Thorins desire to get the Arkan Stone back to prove his divine leadership eventually drives him insane. His unwillingness to help even his own company drives Bilbo to give the Arkan Stone to the Human and the Elven army so there may be a chance they can negotiate without bloodshed. For the most part, this is very faithful to the book. The rest of the movie is drowned with trivial plot details that didn't happen in the book. Legolas goes to scout the orc army before they make their attack, and then Alfrid is given a lot of screen time. Who is Alfrid? Hes hardly an important character, but he is given an awful lot of screen time without contributing anything to the actual battle.

The Battle of Five Armies immediately after all this build up is a shockingly brain-dead experience. There is nothing but non-stop violence. And seeing as this is the subject of the movie, the movie tries extremely hard to tell a compelling story while all this fighting is happening at the same time. But this was believable in The Lord of the Rings because that was a larger story that dealt with larger issues. The Hobbit tosses the battle in many different directions and drags out every fight scene as long as it possibly can. And since we all known the arrival of the eagles is the big reveal, the movie decides to have the emotional and climatic ending before the arrival of the eagles is even going to matter.

This movie also suffers from a problem that is impossible to argue against. It has Disappearing Plot Syndrome. Our attention is momentarily drawn to a creature the orcs are using called Earth Eaters. They resemble giant worm like from the book Dune. After they make their brief two second appearance... thats it. They disappear. No sense in burrowing underground and taking the dwarfs mountain from underneath. Alfrids character is also given a lot of screen time, and towards the middle of the battle he is allowed to get up and walk away without revealing how much his character has contributed (which isn't much). Then after the battle the complete lack of epilogue is also discouraging. Nothing feels accomplished by the great battle, except a lot of death and destruction and sad faces. There is no peaceful resolution or any mention of what happened to the five armies after it is all over.

Maybe I will give the plot some credit because Bilbos character doesnt take any wrong turns as far as I know. He is the one character who is true to himself. I couldn't say the same about Thorin because the movie keeps emphasizing the chief dwarfs growing insanity to the point of exaggeration. The Battle of Five armies is a weak story because we know all the predictable plot twists but theres too much melodramatic build up trying to force the story on us, rather than letting it unfold naturally.

The Battle of Five armies is the worst Middle-Earth movie because Peter Jackson and his creative team believed one battle from the book had enough content to make a two and a half hour movie. Tolkien never even drew attention to the violence, quite as much as the intriguing set up and the motives behind the characters. But since there was nothing else to make a film-worthy epic, it is a real disappointing movie and one that shouldnt be compared to the majesty of The Lord of the Rings.",1428364800,7,5816,4.63883495145631

5270193,3,B0095HHLMO,"As much as I've enjoyed ""The Hobbit"" movies, the third movie was a bit let-down. Probably for two reasons: The first is that there was such a length of time between the second one and the release of the third one that any dramatic build-up from the end of the second one had long since dissipated. And the way the whole battle of Smaug versus Lake Town was just kind of off-handedly thrown in there as a sort of obligatory opener. So they dealt with it in a cursory way-- bing, bang the dragon's dead. Ho-hum, big deal. Okay, now moving on. And while the action was great, and the acting pretty good, and the cinematography was just fine, it would have been much better overall if the story had been told in two parts instead of three. The length of all three parts was fine. It was just the long waits in-between the movies that kinda blew it in my book.

In its supposed representation of a JRR Tolkien work, this is a travesty. Only in the names of its characters does this movie begin resemble Tolkien's Hobbit. Given the positive reviews shown here, it's obvious that we're in the minority. If you liked what Jackson did with the first two Hobbit movies, you'll probably like this one. If not, don't bother. We only watched it because of our kids, and even THEY thought it had serious issues.

Shame on Jackson for pumping this fun children's story as an EPIC trilogy. It should have been a single film about a scared/funny little hobbit trying to survive a journey. Instead it was mostly poor fan-fiction that culminated in a dreadful finale.

If you've never read the book, aren't too bothered about Tolkien's world, and don't mind whether or not the disjointed plot makes sense you may enjoy this for the stunning scenery, music and special effects.

Consequently, I wasn't disappointed.  There were scenes I liked.  Bilbo was well played, as well as Thorin and Balin.  The rest was okay.  I would agree with one comment I heard:  There was too much CGI and too little storyline.  Being a fan of the book, however, I was able to bring the story to mind where the movie was lacking.  Kept me entertained as I did the weekly ironing, so it was worth the rental. The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy was so good.  It is too bad they didn't do as well with The Hobbit.",1428278400,4,669,4.288
5270287,2,B0095HHLMO,"Taken as a whole, the Hobbit is less than half the film it could have been if it had been half the film that it was. I have watched the Lord of the Rings almost as many times as I've read the books, but I doubt I will sit through the Hobbit again. No doubt there will be an extended edition released on dvd (if there isn't already), but I think that this trilogy would benefit more from a condensed version. Trimming off the fat and the silliness, one could possibly cobble together a reasonable adaptation of Tolkien's tale.
The Battle of the Five Armies itself is not a bad movie. The actors do their jobs well, the special effects are as good as expected. Children will enjoy it, and in that respect Jackson's Hobbit is true to the spirit of book.",1428278400,7,750,4.288732394366197
5270288,3,B0095HHLMO,"Ok, I know I am not alone when I say that the Hobbit, should have been two movies (at most) and that's it. Let me start with what I didn't like, then Ill move in too what I did...
First off, what I didn't care for, was the beginning, There is no reason why the story arch of smaug being killed by Bard couldn't have been in the ending of the second movie, actually, there was such a space between the second film and this one coming to theaters that when I finally did see his demise, the emotional and suspense buildup of the end of the second movie was completely lost on me, and the death of smaug did not have the impact it should have. This should have been put in the end of the second movie, now this won't be the case if you are watching them back to back now that they are all available. But obviously the film makes didn't care to do this for those that would pay to see it in theaters....
Secondly, although the fight scenes were a lot fun, and delivered to us in the epic scale that they were in the LOTR movie trilogy. I have to agree with ""Screen Junkies: Honest Trailer"" (check YouTube) of this film. Its basically five pages stretched into almost a three hour film.
Lastly, Overall, this film just wasn't needed, I know, being a fan of the book, there was not a lot of detail as to what was taking place especially action wise in the book, and they obviously exploited this, otherwise they wouldnt have been able to stretch it into three lengthy movies. But they could have left out a lot of the crap pointing to stuff that was coming in LOTR, and made two movies.... plus a lot more liberties they took that they could have left out of the films.
So now to what I liked....
I greatly enjoyed the special effects... This is kind of a no brainer.
I felt that the depiction of the dwarves fighting, both as individuals and in battles, was a lot of fun, as we didn't get any of this in the LOTR trilogy.
It was nice to finally see the movie come to its conclusion....
I know, not much that I liked.
Conclusion....
If you are going to take the time to watch the first two, then, obviously you need to watch the third, it just makes since, but as I mentioned above, it obvious that they were milking this cash cow from the start, and stretching this into not only two, but three movies.... it just became too much... way too much.... after the third, slow motion scene, of a character being killed, and an onlooker, we watch for 3 minutes be surprised... and horror struck.... it just WAY to much dramatization, which I was tired of, by the end of ""the return of the king"" let alone not one, or two, but THREE! more hobbit movies.
In order to complete the series, watch this, even watch it just to fast forward to the battles if you want.... but this third film, just wasn't needed. Heck, its a stretch to say, more than one film was really needed at all.",1428278400,6,2866,4.231751824817518

5270293,3,B0095HHLMO,"I am not a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit episodes, but I do enjoy watching these 2-3 hour long movies.  The acting has always been good, so it makes the movies worth my time.  The movie starts out with sit-on-the-edge action and maintains that action, in different guises, throughout.  What bothered me about this episode was the epic battle that left many questions unanswered until the battle ends.  We watch the dwarfs fight, the elves fight, the towns people fight, and then it is just the battle between the main characters of the dwarfs and elves...the towns people are left abandoned on the screen.  Initially, it started out with scenes from all fronts of the battlefield, but it seemed like a part of the action was cut (for sake of time?).  If time was the issue, I suggest cutting the 30 minute ending and reduce them to something more manageable (just like the third episode of the Lord of the Rings - the ending lasted way too long!).  That time could properly fill in the missing pieces.
Overall, the action was good.  The acting was great. The story was almost thorough, though it surprised me with a few shocking twists, but it kept me wanting more.  Panning back to the towns people and the other warriors in the town and on the battlefield would have made this movie closer to a five-star film.  It is still worth a watch.",1428192000,,1359,4.510204081632653

I have yet to see the extended version, but as the book goes, each movie fits into place just as JRR Tolkien had meant for it to be ( naturally he wasn't a movie maker, a literary writer extraordinaire!!!  ) ...3D is exceptional, I don't have a 4K set, but my TV displays this movie amazingly...An easy 5+ star rating, this movie is AWESOME!!!!!",1428192000,,650,4.6521739130434785

The dialogue sounds like it was made up on the spot by actors who had a vague understanding of the plot.  The only character I wanted to survive this mess was the dragon, he was at least interesting.  All the characters were so aggravating with the idiotic decisions they made every 3 seconds.  Why didn't the Orc army just wait for the elves and dwarves army to destroy each other and then wipe up whatever was left?  The entire movie was so, so dumb.  Not even in an enjoyable way.  I HATED the way that Galadriel was portrayed as a swooning little weakling woman.  None of the male characters laid around during the battles.  Also, Bard's kid only has to hold out a sword and suddenly he's an expert at killing orcs, and all the girls can do is scream really loud?  Fork you Peter Jackson.

80% of this movie is battle scenes that are completely disengaged from the laws of matter and physics, and another 10% is Thorin having really long and annoying episodes of ""dragon fever"", and it's really a cheap ripoff of the powers of Sauron's ring in LOTR.  The battles last so long that nothing is really wrapped up in the end in a way that makes sense.

Tolkien has so many volumes containing interesting stories that could actually add content and depth to this series, and this is all they could fart out?  SKIP.",1428105600,5,1394,4.437007874015748

5270356,5,B0095HHLMO,"The beautiful scenes and haunting music are captivating.  I loved watching this stunningly beautiful conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy that Mr. Jackson has both created and adapted from the J. R. R. Tolkien works.

The acting was wonderful.  I think that Thorin's character achieved epic stature - no easy feat when we consider that the dwarves do not typically seem to concern themselves with the stuff of legend. At his passing, it could truly be said that he, Thorin, was a king.

My only complaint is that I think it might have been better if Kili had not been killed or if Tauriel had loved a surviving dwarf.  I am not very fond of the long battles scenes in Mr. Jackson's Tolkien productions, and I think that the romance between major characters adds a lot of interest to the plot.  If we've gone so far as to introduce Tauriel, why not match her to a surviving dwarf?  I guess, however, if we are to consider this tale in the style of Homer's epics or Shakespeare's tragedies, we might say that the tragic quest here affects all of the House of Durin and anyone who loved them.

Thank goodness for the resilience of Gandalf and Legolas, both of whom hint at the promise that a new light may shine even over the darkling world of this last chapter of the The Hobbit.",1428105600,,1273,4.48051948051948

To be sure there were exciting scenes especially of Smaug wiping out Laketown even though I thought his demise was sort of brusque and without much fanfare for someone of his powers. And I did like the battle scene with Elrond, Galadriel and the shadows. Then there was Gandalf (and a short appearance by Christopher Lee) , a wizard to be sure but not using his powers once (unless I was dozing when he did). Additionally, some of the acting seemed to be a bit off. Maybe it had to do with the final cutting of the film and the Extended Edition will be better.  Like many others have said I really loved actor who played the role of Bilbo in these Hobbit movies. I really wanted to like this movie more and was looking forward to it but from my perspective there was definitely something missing. I sometimes think Mr. Jackson should have started with the Hobbit and worked his way up to the Return of the King. But in the end it was his vision and his movie.

Battle shares its biggest issue with its two mediocre predecessors: The Hobbit is not The Lord of the Rings, and should never have been allowed to become three movies.

But it's here that this misbegotten plan does the most damage. By this point, there simply wasn't enough book left to turn into a movie. So director Jackson and his co-writers abandon all but the rough framework of  Tolkiens masterful epic -- I recognized exactly one line from the book -- and bulk it up with cliches, useless footage and characters, video-game style fights and improbable scene after improbable scene. Its lavish in its cumbersome way, but ultimately never rises above the junk cinema in which Hollywood specializes -- far beneath both the very real talents of the director and the splendid novel he shepherded to wreck and ruin.",1428105600,14,862,4.850340136054422

5270395,2,B0095HHLMO,"Let' be honest here.  We all know what we are getting into here.  The whole series has been really just a nice reminder of how much we loved Lord of The Rings, and hey that's okay.  The character depth is lacking.  The fight scenes look like a medieval/fantasy version of the terrible mess in Transformers.  The computer graphics hit you over the head instead of complimenting the strong plot and characters.  The ""fellowship"" in this movie all look alike (not to sound like a racist but a pointy hat doesn't help me tell one dwarf from the other). Just like the previous movies there is so much dead time.  If you forced us to do 3 movies, you didn't have to make them all 2.5 hours + long.  There is little more boring than watching the people for 20 minutes climb out of the water after the town burns (except of course that long meal from the first hobbit movie).

DON'T LISTEN TO PEOPLE TELLING YOU THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE.  What they mean to say is ""this movie is better than the other two Hobbit's which were terrible"".  Not even Gandalf can wizard this one up.  And wait till you see the big All-Star fight scene where everyone saves Gandalf.  I have not read the Hobbit in a long time, but I'm some how doubting it played out in a perfect way to highlight fun LOTR characters!  Having said that, it was actually a great scene because it lasted the right amount of time and because we knew the characters, unlike the rest of this mess.

And wait till you see the orcs.  Because they are supposed to seem special and like neat bad bosses, but they all blend in and there is nothing to like or dislike about them because they are shallow and blah.

I get the feeling they are just done with this series of movies.  All the actors seemed bored and uninspired.  The only character with believable emotion was Bilbo, everyone else looked like they were tired of doing the movies.  They tried to make up for the lack of acting with the action sequences with ridiculous results.  Every movie in this series has had the ""oh come on"" moments, but this one made up for lost time.  There were so many physically impossible things going on that it constantly kicked you out of the movie, it was worse than watching a cartoon.  For example, running up falling blocks like they are stairs, the wagon scene, and so many more that I would have to write an article.  Oh, and the fighting scenes; were they even trying?  I realize that this is a fictional fantasy story, but you have to be anchored in reality.  I usually like fantasy movies, but these kind of things are why a lot of people don't.  The only interesting thing in the movie was Smaug, which honestly should have been concluded in the last movie.  Especially because he was only in it for like ten minutes.  But, I guess they needed something to get you to watch this one.

the acting is masterful.. Shakespearian.. mixed with just enough contemporary that it reminds you that this is a saga of British mythology being told in the present.. being passed down so to speak.. which is the real beauty of all the middle earth movies.. they aren't trying to be movies based on J.R.R Tolkien books.. they are movies about the stories told in those books",1427932800,,1165,4.574162679425838

5270615,3,B0095HHLMO,"After just seeing the final installment of the Hobbit trilogy.  I was kind of unsure how to rate this film.  It is a good movie but the trilogy itself is not as good as LOTR as many other reviewers have pointed out.  I would rate this film as a 3 to 3 1/2 stars.  There are several sequences I really enjoyed in the movie.  But I kept thinking to myself that so much of the story was geared toward Thorin and not Bilbo.  Bilbo to me does not seem to do much of anything.  In the Hobbit book I always imagined Bilbo as kind of an Uncle Scrooge type of character.  Kind of a cantankerous kind of fellow, a loner and by the end of the story the ring seemed to bring out the courage within him.  But by the end of the Battle of the Five Armies, Bilbo just kind of bumbles around not as the central character in the story.  He does not really even use the ring during the battle to play any significant role.

From the way Thorin was acting you would assume that he would have been the one to find the ring of power and not Bilbo.  He only just found the gold and hardly had any time to be so seduced by its luster.  I also thought it was strange that the Lonely mountain keep would not have any defenses to help the dwarves like white castle in the LOTR ROTK, I/E catapults, large weapons etc etc.

The greedy human character Alfrid also gets old quickly.  A lot of time seems wasted on this small insignificant man that could have been better used on a stronger character more central to the story itself.  We get it that his greed and cowardice will lead to a bad end just like ""Wormtongue"" in the LOTR movies.  But it was not really needed in this film, the human struggle could have been accomplished better from a different character.

This is something I think George Lucas never learned while making the Star Wars prequel trilogy.  That you don't have to repeat the same characters in another trilogy.  It is better to come up with something new and fresh unlike what has already been done.  Peter Jackson's Hobbit Trilogy is very good and watchable and besides the ""Alfrid"" character I thought the films stood on their own feet different from the LOTR movies.  Whereas all 3 Star Wars prequels were dreadful and not worth rewatching any of them, just bad repeats of the first 3 films.

I found it funny that Bilbo is trying to quietly sneak away from the Lonely Mountain to barter with the humans and elves to avoid a battle.  All he would have had to do is just put on the ring and walk right over there, no need to sneak at all.  The falling steps scene where Legolas seems to be defying gravity did not seem very realistic.

Towards the final battle between Thorin and the White Orc.  I thought for sure Bilbo would use the ring in some way to sneak up and cripple the Orc leader in some way like Merry did to the Witch King of Agmar in the LOTR ROTK.

Finally the way the movie ends is more sad than melancholy.  in the LOTR the old Bilbo seems to have such a grand old time looking back on his quest.  But in the Hobbit series it ends on a sad note hardly something to look back on so fondly.

Another loose end I thought was never tied up is why the Elf King Thranduil wanted the precious diamond necklace so badly.  Did it belong to his late wife Legolas mother?  The problem with doing a prequel as well, is that Orlando Bloom seemed to be much older and heavier in the face.  Maybe I am crazy but his face seemed to be much wider like he gained 20 lbs since the filming of the first trilogy.  That is a minor flaw though and it does not detract from a great job he did in both trilogies.  Maybe he went on Slim Fast or Weight Watchers after the events in the Hobbit Films.

What I really enjoyed seeing in all three of the Hobbit films was the interactions from the main players in the LOTR.  Watching Lord Elrod, Saruman, Galadriel, Gandalf and the discovery that it was Sauron behind the whole scheme seemed much more interesting to me than anything Bilbo did in all 3 films. It felt like the viewer is visiting old friends.  I thought for sure the film would close on Sauron's spirit or eye being built on the tower in Mordor.",1427846400,,4142,4.228025477707006

No really I should have loved all of these. I grew up on Tolkien. The first bedtime story my dad read to me was An Unexpected Party. I love Jacksons LotR movies and binge watch them frequently. But as soon as The Hobbit movies leave Bag End it all goes downhill and just keeps accelerating downwards like a bad political campaign. I don't even know what to make of this last movie. A 3+ hour movie from the last 10-12 pages of the book? The Smaug fight should have ended the second film. And after that? I don't know what this is? Goat Charriots? Sand Worms? Weird vengeance fights? Bear Bombs! I got confused and bored. And I thrive on this type of thing. I fear what a non geek will get from it.",1427846400,4,930,4.195530726256983

Peter Jackson did a fine job with Lord of the Rings, but he simply did not do justice to the Hobbit movies. Lord of the Rings is my favorite book (okay, books). When I was ten, I wrote a 38-page book report on the Hobbit. I know Tolkien's world inside and out. The Hobbit movies are over the top in all ways, and worst of all, are simply not believable. I buy into dwarves, hobbits, wizards, and the lot, but not into an elf falling for a dwarf, nor a dwarf with a Scottish accent. All just too much. I can't count how many times I've read Lord of the Rings or watched the movies, but the entire Hobbit series left me unmoved, even bored. Could not wait for this movie to be over in the theater, and can't imagine watching it streaming or on DVD.

Ian McKellen great as Gandalf, and Martin Freeman wonderful as Bilbo. Really great. Otherwise...I can't help thinking what might have been, had del Toro been able to make these.",1427760000,,1153,4.358139534883721

This one has some truly moving moments - Bard is a much more developed character - with lots of character. The scene with his son in the tower, taking on the dragon is powerful.  So many truly hair-raising, emotive moments in this film. Very pleased. Much better than The Desolation of Smaug.  The computerized special effects are much better in this one - very believable, for the most part.  Only one that kind of detracts, between Legolas and Bolg; but, other than that, it's a winner.  I am watching it almost daily.  Even though the brothers die, as does Thorin, it's still powerful - Martin Freeman is impeccable.

5270750,2,B0095HHLMO,"The let down of the 3rd installment of the Hobbit was more epic than the battles within. I never expected the movies to be an exact copy of the books but the general story line and ""feeling"" J.R.R. Tolkien instilled into his writings is missing completely. Peter Jackson obviously never read any of Tolkien's works either that or he has no respect or regard for Tolkiens' thinking or his writing. The subtleties with which Tolkien wrote are admittedly difficult to translate to the Big Screen but Jackson again shows disdain for the story lines as well as the interpersonal relationships other than the one he tries to manufacture. In his first ""interpretation"" of Tolkien's works Jackson decided to leave the Shire untouched and unscathed by a world wide cataclysmic war. The whole point of Tolkien's story was such a war would leave no living being unchanged or untouched by such tragedy. This thought seems to have occurred to Tolkien before or during the 1st World War. Jackson butchers the Hobbit in the third installment. I can only hope a more understanding director take on the challenge of the story again in my lifetime.",1427760000,3,1130,4.860103626943006

5270752,3,B0095HHLMO,"I always like to start my reviews on a postiive note so I will do so here by saying that the third installment of Peter Jackson's trilogy of The Hobbit movies is a spectacular film in many ways: the grandeur of the spectacle of the battle that takes up much of the film is really overwhelming.  I appreciate Jackson's determination to wrap things up with a lead in to the beginning of the Lord of the Rings movies.  Above all, I must say that many of the actors are truly excellent, including of course Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins and  Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey.  Peter Jackson loves the world J.R.R. Tolkien created, and it shows.

Even though Jackson loves Middle-earth, I do not believe he has captured its spirit as successfully as he did in the three Lord of the Rings movies.  Partly due to the decision to stretch what is, after all, a fairly short book into three long movies, there is much too much reliance on battles, fights, and other violence.  Although I recognize that a movie with no female characters would have little chance of success in today's world, I do not care for Jackson's invention of the Elf woman Tauriel, though to give him and Evangeline Lily credit she does display an acceptably Elvish persona at times.

In the end I must say that as a lover of J.R.R. Tolkien's books for many years I find this final movie to be lacking much of what appeals to me and countless others about Middle-earth: the heroism of common, ordinary, folk; the love of nature; and the age old theme of the Quest and the Return. Perhaps the greatest achievement of the three Hobbit films, along with their Lord of the Rings predecessors, is that through them countless people have been introduced to J.R.R. Tolkien and have found within the pages of his books a deeper, longer lasting, beauty.",1427760000,2,1809,4.578947368421052

I know there are those that criticize Peter Jackson for drawingThe Hobbit into three long movies and what not, but If you like this genre of film then I just don't see a reason to be overly critical.  This movie, as well as the others, are entertaining both because of the storyline and the visual expanse this movie covers.  I don't feel like my time was wasted.  I will defintely watch again.  The movie made me want to rewatch the Lord of the Rings trilogy since this is like a prequel.  I love the characters and the battle of good v evil throughout all the movies in this franchise.

5270759,5,B0095HHLMO,"Unlike many fans of 'The Hobbit' and 'Lord of the Rings,' I have never read Tolkien's books.
I did try back when I was in college but, honestly, I found the prose too dense and the narrative unnecessarily complicated: A cross between Tolstoy and Marvel comics, if you will.
That heresy said, I have thoroughly enjoyed Peter Jackson's epic attempt to make Tolkien accessible to those of us who are perhaps not as intellectually gifted as our friends and neighbors who swoon at the mention of Middle Earth and can - and will - quote obscure passages from the books at the drop of a hat. For me, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' was a fitting conclusion to a wonderful six-film set that has made a mostly incomprehensible series of books easily understood by us plebes. It has everything that I look for in a high-quality film: Strong characters, excellent pace, great writing, acting at a very high level, amazing technical wizardry and action.
Loads and loads of action.
Beyond that, all of the movies in this thoroughly enjoyable series give us a look inside the value system that existed in upper-class Great Britain during the twilight of the Empire. Tolkien was a product of his class and, because that is so, we see how he incorporated its values into his books: Honor is important, as is loyalty and fidelity to duty regardless of the odds stacked against you, for example. A man gives his word, he is expected to live up to it and the willingness to die in support of a great cause is not only worthy but also expected.
Tolkien, who was born in South Africa and later became a professor at Oxford, is also convinced that mixing the races is, if not wrong, at least distasteful. When an Elf falls in love with a Dwarf in 'Battle of the Five Armies,' for example, we are pretty sure that one of them will have to die. When, in the 'Lord of the Rings' an Elfin princess falls in love with a human she must make a terrible sacrifice in order to be with him.
This is not meant, however, to be a dissection of British values in that tumultuous period from 1937 through the mid-Fifties but a review of this sixth and final movie in the series that began with 'The Fellowship of the Ring.'
That said, while I enjoyed all the performances I especially liked Richard Armitage's portrayal of Thorin Oakenshield, the Dwarf who would be King; Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins, and Lee Pace as Thranduil, the leader of the Elvish army. Pace, who I first saw in the American television light comedy 'Pushing Daisies,' brings a cold intensity to his role that perfectly balances the emotional outbursts that Armitage brings to his.
All in all, an excellent six-film series that is capped off with this final installment in fine form.
I highly recommend it.",1427760000,,2756,4.592292089249493

I don't think movies need to religiously stick to books, but this was just too over the top - an elf and dwarf falling in love, the creation of multiple characters, the sappy love stuff. The charming tale of The Hobbit became completely lost in this over-the-top slop. I only hope the estate of J.R.R. Tolkien doesn't let any more Tolkien material get into the hands of Hollywood.

And in saying, though I have not read the stories... I somehow knew there were some continuity issues. Some things just didn't match up. Some of the effects were impressive... BUT, some of it was not, you could tell it was CGI as opposed to LOTR. And what really bothered me... Disappointed me... Some of the Clich dialogue or coincidental actions. If not the Pace.... Many scenes were RUSHED. And when you rush a movie sequence, it sucks. Whatever happened to taking one's time? I don't mean full slow motion shots, I mean, taking time to show us a scene and the reactions. This did not.
Oh... And the amount of Extras used, and their own reactions. That was annoying In itself. We weren't given a hint of their anguish and cheer, whatever it may be, there were too many shots of them. I was trying to focus on the main characters.

5270892,2,B0095HHLMO,"*********SPOILERS AHEAD*****

I hadn't seen the preceding movie for a year, so when this movie just picks up without any recap, I was lost for a moment. It took a while for me to get back into the story and also into that emotion and headspace. Recall that the second movie ends with Smaug unleashing on Lake-Town. If you haven't seen the other two, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This prelude that tells of Smaug's demise lasts about fifteen minutes and then we leave that action packed adventure and move on to the battle for the mountain. It feels disjointed. It's like that first part doesn't even belong.

Then you have the lack of character development. Again, if you haven't seen the previous movies, you will be completely lost. There is no way to know who these people/creatures are, what their relationships are, what they are fighting for, or why you should care. It's all action, no plot, and probably only ten pages of dialog for the entire movie. Nothing holds these people together. The elements that *could* have been used to enhance interest: love, revenge, power, honor, growth, are all given a passing nod then forgotten. Sad choice.

My opinion is that if you are going to make three movies, they should be stand alone movies. No, you don't have to retell the story each time, but give us enough to be able to quickly get up to speed and to care. This doesn't do that. It inserts this sweeping, emotional music to invoke feeling for you and assumes you know what's going on. It's not great storytelling. This really should have been cut, cut, cut and kept to two movies.

Another point of ridiculousness is the nonsensical, fantastic (meaning not based in reality) fight scenes. About two hours of the two and a half hours is spent in this mode. Creatures suffer incredible injury that would fell any normal person, yet they continue to stand and fight. Meanwhile other creatures beside them get glancing blows and are out for the count. A tower falls intact between two mountains, yet crumbles when it is hit with a sword. I know Legolas is an elf, but even elves obey the laws of gravity in most worlds. Here he practically flies through and walks on air. Some of the imagination is inspired, but most of it just lands with a sigh and rolled eyes, leaving me wishing for the end already.

But, no, I have to see if Thorin actually dies as he's supposed to or will Jackson pull a rabbit out of his hat. And if he does die, how does he do it? Once we finally get there, it's quite anticlimactic. It takes too long to arrive and any emotion I may have had has been wrung out of me long before now (not to mention that the Thorin in THIS movie doesn't give you much to love. If you don't already have a relationship with him, you won't gain it here).

The timing of scenes was off too. Some things went on way too long (like the whole movie), then things that should have had at least thirty more seconds of air time, like the arrival of the bats bred for war, the were-worms, the arrival of Beorn and the eagles, were given short shrift. Either they are a big deal or they are not. Why mention it if it's not a big deal? If it is a big deal, why not give it the attention it deserves? The arrival of the eagles and Beorn turned the tide and won the war, but it doesn't look that way in this version. It's quite incidental.

The conclusion isn't much of a finale. Bilbo just goes home. That's it. End of story. You don't know what happened to anyone except Legolas and Bilbo. Why did we go all this way only to abandon all our peeps? Search me.

But it's not a complete bomb. Once again the landscape is spectacular. The score is still good (although after three years it feels stale). The costumes, prosthetics, and all the supporting things that create and prop up the story are great. The scene where Thorin and his band of hairy men charge out of Erebor was a visual delight that made me squeak out a ""Huzzah!"" Richard Armitage as Guy of Gisbourne in Robin Hood is my favorite tv death scene. I thought Armitage did a great job here as well despite the less than fabulous writing. I could watch those two scenes over and over. I may be in the minority on this one, but I also got a chuckle out of seeing the dwarves on goatback scampering up the side of the mountain into battle. Silly, but no sillier than watching a giant Orc crush his way through the ice after he should have suffered from hypothermia.

In a nutshell, this is a movie about different groups of creatures doing mostly horrible stuff that looks visually impressive in the name of wealth and power. You finish it not knowing who they are (if you are viewing it as a stand alone movie) or whether the good guys won. If that sounds good to you and action and special effects are high on your list of things that make movie viewing fun, give a shot. If watching dwarves run into battle and seeing Thorin Oakenshield die are good enough reasons to watch it, you'll enjoy it. If you want more from a film, you may well skip it. If you do watch it, do it on a big screen. The impact is completely lost on a small one.",1427587200,5,5109,4.369473684210527

5270896,3,B0095HHLMO,"The movie's many strengths come in relatively trivial aspects of the film, while its weaknesses fall in what should have been the heart of the tale. Martin Freeman, alone, saves the film from disaster by providing a believable, deep, affecting characterization of Bilbo. Ian McKellan is again believable as Gandalf, though relegated to the role of a sort of magical Jeeves. Though criticized as written in as ""something for the girls,"" Evangeline Lilly does a good job, too. The rest -- the characters, the storyline -- is all middle-schoolish baggage. The different dwarves (with a couple of exceptions) are basically interchangeable Smurfs. As far as characters, Freeman has to carry the whole movie, and even with astonishingly lame dialogue, he does. Whew! As important as characterization, and as weakly done, is setting. For what is supposed to be a believable, whole new and other world, scene after scene looks like either the painting it is, or a Lego project (which I assume will be on the market). I assume this visible fakery was done deliberately, both to mimic the fake reality of video games and to provide visual continuity with games derived from this movie. But the clunky settings, combined with the godawful Brothers Hildebrandt meet Thomas Kinkade lighting come close to ruining any believability at all. Ditto for most of the CGI. Viewing the elven army is about as interesting as trying to read graph paper. I know those guys are precise, but I haven't seen anything look so mass-produced since those awful Gungan army battle scenes in the Star Wars prequels. The effects nearly sink the film, but, ultimately, there are plenty of enthralling, beautiful, and surprising images that save the day. But wow -- what a hefty load of junk as well. Many of us don't want Jackson to be a strict constructionist with Tolkien, but to do as he has sometimes done and make the works anew, as film. So adding characters, expanding stories and details -- fine. But as has been the case for this whole series, Jackson has lost his way. It's no even close to the story of Bilbo Baggins, or some other kinds of story. It's just a load of stuff strung together by a sequence of events that we don't really care about, happening to people we don't even like (with a few exceptions). It is essentially Super Mario Brothers 3 (the old NES game) in both plot and presentation -- right down to the jumping block-to-block sequences, right, Legolas... again? -- though with somewhat less spirit and far, far less charm. But I suspect that's the idea. Peter Jackson and his mature, adult friends making something for ""the kids."" But while Tolkien elevated the reader, and worked from a basic concept of what is noble, deep, best (and also worst) about people, Jackson is just selling stuff.

For those of us who grew up reading these books the movies will always be held in contempt.

5270909,2,B0095HHLMO,"I first read the Tolkien books in high school, decadess ago.  I've always been a fan, even though I'm not a fantasy/scifi fan.  I eagerly anticipated the movies when Fellowship first came out.  I've now watched them all, including the extended versions of the original LOTR trilogy.  BOFA is by far the worst of the lot.  I watched the previous 5 movies straight through without stopping.  I even watched each of them multiple times when I first bought them.  I still go back and watch them.  I couldn't even watch BOFA to the end without quitting.  And after leaving it partially watched for two days, still didn't have the urge to complete it.  I finally watched it to the ending last night, a movie I eagerly anticipated for a year, and I have no desire to watch it again.  That's how bad this movie is.

The inaccuracies with the book are numerous.  It's as much Jackson's creation than it is Tolkien's writings. It's as if Jackson decided to write a story, and use Tolkien's characters and title, because he couldn't think them up for himself.  The battle scenes are waaaaayyyy tooooo looooong.  The dragon/gold disease Thorin is suffering from is overplayed.  You could cut half of that out and nobody would've noticed.  The story seems very disjointed.  It seems to jump from scene to scene with no relevancy to each other.  Some scenes seem totally pointless...Gandalf and Bilbo in the Gandalf cleaning out his pipe scene.  There is no Thorin, Fili, Kili, funeral scene.  There is no real wrapping up of the movie.  It was as if Jackson was planning a fourth movie to tie it all together.  I get the feeling that the Alfrid, Tuariel, and Radagast actors must be favorites or friends of Jackson's.  I can't think of any other reason why he included so much of them in the movie's.  (I think Jackson must have a thing for Evangeline Lilly)

When I purchased the previous 5 movies, I watched them over and over and over.  I have no wish to ever see this movie again.  That alone should tell you how bad I think it is.  I gave it 2 stars, instead of 1, only because there are a few saving scenes.",1427587200,7,2100,4.525333333333333

I can see how Peter Jackson uses it for motivation for certain scenes to take place, but it does not really make a lot of sense to me for a nearly immortal being engaging in a romantic relationship with one with such a short lifespan.  Can elves and dwarfs breed together?  Ick, I don't even want to think about that!

The Battle of the Five Armies ranks up there as one of the better Peter Jackson movies. As usual, everything takes far too long. When you think the movie is really over, it goes on for another 15 minutes. However given that this is the last in the Hobbit series they wanted to wrap up all the details and say goodbye to the characters we have come to love. I have no problem with that.

Let me start off first with something I was pretty happy with, which is the vulnerability of the elves. One thing that bothered me in the LotR films was the seemingly complete invulnerability of Legolas. If I recall, I don't think he ever actually takes any injury in those films, and he is rarely even dirty from his battles. This doesn't make for very much dramatic tension. In the second Hobbit film, he takes on Bolg and at least gets a bloody nose for his trouble. And then here in Five Armies, he seems to be in some genuine peril in his final battles. To my mind, LotR would have benefitted from a Legolas we believe could actually have died or been harmed at some point. And being about 2,500 years old as he is, it's not as if his combat skills would have improved appreciably in the 77 years between the setting in this film and the War of the Ring. Tauriel also takes something of a beating in this final film too.

Another positive aspect here is that Jackson, wisely, I think, paralleled themes from LotR of how desire can warp your understanding of things. For the Dwarves (well, Thorin, anyway), it's the gold and jewels that hold such allure (of course, that was Tolkien's theme, not Jackson's), in LotR, obviously, it's the desire for power, represented by the ring. It's fitting, since in Tolkien's works, the Dwarves actually have a pretty strong resistance to the power of the seven rings given to them by Sauron (the Silmarillion explains that they were purposely made stubborn so as to resist the temptations of Melkor). Their desire is for gold. The six-film arc shows us two iterations of the power of temptation and this theme dovetails with the theme of the passing on of responsibility from one generation to the next between The Hobbit and LotR (Gloin passes it to his son Gimli, Bilbo to Frodo, Thranduil to Legolas, etc...) similar to the way the veterans of WWI (like Tolkien) passed responsibility to those who would fight WWII (Tolkien's son Christopher). By the way, Jackson went through a lot of trouble to parallel parts of the two trilogies; it's curious, then, that Gloin wasn't given more significance in the movies since he is Gimli's father, after all.

A couple of things that disappointed me in FotR, during the council of Elrond, are that nobody speaks except the principle actors (wouldn't having some other characters speak up open up the world a little, and show that there are really a lot of people involved? I'm digressing, but a similar issue caused the battle of Pellennor fields and its aftermath to feel a little empty. Where are the captains and lieutenants in charge of the regiments and such, particularly prince Imrahil?) At the council of Elrond, it is Gloin who speaks on behalf of the dwarves, which would have been proper. Gimli would have respected his father's paternal authority and not spoken. I realize there are already a lot of characters, but when you've got 10 hours of film time, there is PLENTY of time to go around. The result is that we have a few principle characters who me we know and a bunch of anonymous people fighting around them. At times, the character development is a little tortured when the writers could have made more space for secondary characters to open this epic up a bit. Ironically, I think Jackson accomplishes this a little better in the Hobbit trilogy. Part of it was because he had no other option, since he chose to include all 13 dwarves (even though he did awful things to them to make sure young kids would be able to differentiate them--which I can't really blame him for when so much money is on the line).

Oh, one more bit of praise. You hardly have to see any of Radagast's poop hair. Jackson needs to reign in his puckish and adolescent urge to include puerile, particularly scatalogical, humor. His poor comic sense also brought down King Kong to a degree.

I do think this film was the best of the trilogy, not necessarily because it was so much better, but because it had many fewer bad parts, and it was far less often hampered by puerile comic relief and astonishingly implausible sequences with the Dwarves. I think it was a poor decision to make the dwarves as miraculously agile and, well, lucky as the elves for the sake of zippy action sequences. The dwarves and the elves are basically antithetical races, and yet the dwarves jump, flip, and pull off absurdly graceful combat sequences, very much in the style of the elves. The sequences of the Dwarves in action are simply cartoonish. I would direct you to the chase through Goblin Town, the encounter with the trolls and with the rock Giants, the escape from the Thranduil, and their encounter with Smaug. You would think they were all part of a circus high-wire act. Compare this to the way Gimli was something of a clumsy fool in LotR.

My main complaint about the film is shared by many of the reviewers of the film. There really was very little plot in Five Armies. In one way, this wasn't such a bad thing because Peter, and Phillipa, and Fran overestimate their ability to write convincing drama and they are particularly poor with dialogue (consider that for all the many Oscars won by Return of the King, there was not even a single nomination for any acting awards, despite the fine actors in the film--they simply weren't given a good script to work with). The main reason the Hobbit trilogy--in my opinion--are a group of typical so-so blockbusters instead of transcendent film like the LotR trilogy is that Jackson just couldn't make lightning strike twice. Of course, if you are one of the greats, then you don't need lightning. In all honesty, Jackson doesn't make a lot of ""great"" films. He will always be a director who created something spectacular, but I don't think, in the future, he'll ever be considered one of the greats. King Kong and The Lovely Bones were both mediocre, but I will always maintain that he directed one of Hollywood's greatest films--Fellowship of the Ring.

Ps. One thing I've wondered-- Ian McClellan was Jackson's greatest commodity as an actor, and Gandalf MAY be his greatest commodity as a character and yet, through all six films, particularly this last, he doesn't use him as much as he might've. I wonder why.",1427414400,2,6472,4.66783523225241

5271025,2,B0095HHLMO,"First let me say that being able to watch this trilogy in 3D in the comfort of my living room was amazing.
I had never read the book, so it was all new to me. Parts I and 2 were outstanding.
 Sadly the same can not be said for the third part. Yes I understand that it was all
about battling armies but it was a shame that it had to be at the expense of interaction
between the actors who barely seemed to have any dialogue.
It reminded me of the Matrix trilogy that really shouldn't have been a trilogy. The entire
second disc The Matrix reloaded was totally unnecessary. It was just repeated fight scenes
ad nauseaam. The same is true of The Battle of the Five Armies. It simply got boring
and confusing. They went overboard with the cgi affects. It also got boring to watch
take after take of Thorin having gold lust.
Now about the ending, Bilbo goes through hell and back with the dwarves and it's a one minute goodbye? What about a burial scene for Thorin? That would have been so touching and heartfelt.
Do you really believe that Bard would have handed his children's safety over to the movie's biggest coward? NOT !
I could go on and on about the deficiencies of this third part of the trilogy, but I wouldn't want to bore you.
The one shining example throughout this trilogy is Sir Ian McKellen. What ever character he plays, in whatever
movie he is in, you can count on a bravura performance. I wish the rest of the cast had the superb diction that
he displays.
All in all, if you have watched the first two parts of the trilogy, you do have to watch the third, but be prepared
to be disappointed.",1427414400,,1606,4.282894736842105

The best that I can figure is Tolkein took aspects from the first trilogy and played mix and match in the prequel. And he used humor to cover the lack of coherent plot. The ending, which fit in a lot of ways, was disappointing.

For Lord of the Rings fans, it will explain a lot. Like me, you'll probably watch it once and go back to Lord of the Rings. Its worth it for the explanation only.",1427414400,2,689,4.21969696969697

The movie- honestly, I can't think of a way to adequately frame my disappointment in this preposterously fabricated mess of artificially-inseminated characters and arrestingly turgid dialog.  I first read The Hobbit and LOTR back in the 1970s, and have re-read them cover-to-cover at least a half-dozen times since (and The Silmarillion, and other posthumousTolkien works)...

After being gullible enough to pay theater prices for the first two heinous entries in this laughably over-inflated cartoon, I waited for Battle of the Five Armies to come to on-demand... at that, I'm still plenty disappointed in having paid four-ninety-nine.

5271054,2,B0095HHLMO,"Okay, this isn't (quite) a franchise embarrassment. It's no ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"", for example. But I honestly don't see how even the most wide-eyed fan boy could give this one 5 stars. The first two Hobbit movies were good- not LOTR good - but good just the same. But this? What could have easily been the best movie of the trilogy, somehow ended up the worst. How did this happen? It started out fine, but then steadily went down hill. Spoilers follow....

If you watched the special features on the first two Hobbit movies, you know that Peter Jackson and crew went out of their way to make each dwarf a unique character with a distinctive personality - as opposed to the vague descriptions offered in the book (e.g. ""Balin is the one in the red hood""). This was one of the great elements of the first two movies: getting to know these characters and watch them interact and grow. So why throw all of this effort out the window for the last movie? Other than Thorin and Kili, I don't think the remaining dwarves had 2 pages of dialogue between them. The others might as well have been played by extras.

Other disappointing elements...

1) Lack of epilogue. The battle ends, Bilbo basically just says ""bye"", and goes back to the Shire to interrupt his estate sale. What about the impact of winning the battle? Does Bard become King of Dale? Does Dain become King of Erebor? Is Erebor rebuilt to its former glory? Is there a new era of peace, prosperity and cooperation for Erebor, Dale, and the Woodland elves? The viewers will never know (unless they read the book).

2) Silly fight scenes. One example: a troll knocking down a tower to form a bridge. The tower survives that incredible impact but starts to fall apart if Legolas or Bolg accidentally elbow its walls? Speaking of which, was Bolg even a necessary character? And Legolas violating the laws of physics by walking up free-falling rocks? I can only suspend my disbelief so far.

3) Too much Thorin ""dragon sickness"".

4) Way too much Alfrid. (And Bard actually trusting him to get his children to safety? Please.)

5) Too many disconnected battle scenes at the expense of real story telling.

6) Missed opportunities. The bats? Yet another ""army bred for a single purpose"". That purpose must be to be killed by eagles, because that's all we see them doing on the screen. And Beorn? He is supposed to be this Orc-killing machine. We see him fight for about 5 seconds... right after his laugh-inducing airdrop from an eagle.

7) Way too much CGI. During the battle sequences, the film often looks more like animation than live-action.

8) More missed opportunities. Wouldn't it have been a powerful scene to show the surviving dwarves laying Thorin to rest in his tomb, Arkenstone glittering on his chest, while singing a reprise of ""Misty Mountains Cold""? Instead, we get that weird scene after the battle of Bilbo watching Gandalf fiddle with his pipe. Really? That's what makes it into the final cut? I shudder to think of the scenes they chose to edit out.

By the end of the film, I seriously had to check the credits to see if Peter Jackson was actually involved, because his usual deft touch went missing somewhere along the way. So much so, that in a way the other 2 movies are now diminished for me. I don't want to sit down and watch them knowing that their overall story does not have a satisfying conclusion.

I had a horrible feeling when heads were rolling and why the sword through the top of the head?  Horrid scene.
Guess I've become very sensitive to what ISIS is doing.  Pure evil in every sense of the word.  I'm not sure at this point that I will view it again.

For those of you who like J.R.R. Tolkien you will like this movie. I enjoyed ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies and yes there was violence in them also.
It's a battle between good and evil and this movie is too.  I'm sick to death of violence and have to turn the news off at times to clear my mind.

Overall, it one more piece to complete my Middle-earth series of DVDs.  I'm looking forward to the extended version.

5271094,1,B0095HHLMO,"UPDATE: Thought that you'd like to see an explanation which we received, from a fellow Tolkien fan on another site. Hope this helps you make an educated decision. We're looking into a PS3 for Blu-rays, before we buy anymore Hobbit movies. We watched the DVD again and were as disappointed as ever with the poor quality of it.

""DVDs came out in 1995. Marking the 20 year anniversary, UHD (4K) Blu-rays will be released later this year in an attempt to compete with digital streaming and downloads. Because of this, less money is going into DVDs, and this means a drop in quality and content for the format and that there will be no more special/limited/collector's edition DVDs.

""So there's a very real and unfortunate possibility that the Extended Edition will not be released on DVD at all - as is being discussed in a few home-cinema forums. If it is released, it'll likely be the last special edition DVD to be produced. The format doesn't have much time left, and distributors don't want to waste money on a format that will be obsolete in 5 years. Just a heads-up!""

This is a review of the disc which was sent to us for a pre-order Hobbit DVD. This is NOT a movie, book or Amazon review. This is NOT a Blu-Ray review. We are reviewing the quality of this DVD 2-disc Special Edition for $14.96.

We are LOTR & HOBBIT fanatics. Truly. A whole family, various ages, that's crazy about these films. We've been in this since the beginning. We have viewed nearly every pressing of the DVDs which have ever been released. In fact, LOTR is the reason for our purchasing our first DVD player---the VHS tape didn't last long or look very nice! So, we're clear here, I hope --- we LOVE this series of six films!

This DVD arrived yesterday, after months of anxious anticipation. We watched it last night. Within five minutes, we'd already stopped it twice, thinking that something was wrong with our set-up (a quite nice up-convert DVD player and wide plasma screen). Having to stop this movie is not good, because it's high-paced from the beginning. After trying every setting we have, several times, we finally just decided to let it run and write this review.

What a lousy DVD! WAY too bright. WAY too much contrast with nothing outside the black and white end of things. VERY desaturated. Grainy. TOTAL lack of detail. NO reds and blues (even the grass in the shire, at the end, had only a yellow cast). The people look like they haven't seen the sun in a lifetime. Even the elves look pasty, instead of just beautifully fair. The sound was horrible--WAY too loud on the music, and the voices were often so low below the background noises/music that we were glad we'd seen it multiple times in the theatre and knew what they were saying. You don't get to see the beautiful detail of the clothes and props, and that's half of why you re-watch these movies!

We own many hundreds of DVDs. MANY hundreds. This is comparable to some of the 1980s TV shows which we bought. The un-remastered ones, that is. We have a few of those dollar-bin DVDs, and you could probably say this was about as good as those. I don't know how to say it any clearer. Do NOT buy this DVD. We'll wait for a later release and try again. We strongly advise you to wait, until they give us something better than this.

What a lousy way for these people to exit this series. Their fans deserve better. Shame on you, Warner Brothers and New Line.",1427328000,,3419,4.519417475728155

Believe the other reviews, I didn't and wish I had. There are to many CGI's and a very convoluted and unclear story. I grew up on Tolkein but can't remember any of his stories resembling this disaster. I give it 2 stars for Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen's acting skills.",1427328000,3,440,4.432098765432099

5271100,3,B0095HHLMO,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the third in a series of films adapting J.R.R. Tolkiens 78-year-old The Hobbit. After reclaiming their homeland from the Dragon Smaug (voice of Benedict Cumberbatch), the Company of Dwarves has unleashed  unbeknownst to them  a deadly force into the world. Smaug lets loose his fiery wrath on the inhabitants of Laketown in a quarter-hour sequence that ranks with a final hour-long battle in flair and excitement. Its one thing to dazzle viewers with special effects wizardry, but quite another to deaden the senses by too much.

 Audiences love action, of course, but when director Peter Jackson abandons a sense of restraint and halts dramatic narrative with overly long scenes that make their point and then go on and on and on, the film suffers. Its fun to re-visit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and all the other colorful Tolkien characters, but after the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, one feels like shouting Enough already! Time to move on.

A deluxe 5-disc edition contains Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital versions of the film. Bonus features include the featurettes Recruiting the Five Armies, Completing Middle-Earth, New Zealand: Home of Middle-Earth, Part 3; and the music video The Last Goodbye.

5271101,1,B0095HHLMO,"Tolkien's Hobbit was the first fantasy novel I read, and it has a special place in my heart. I know other people feel the same way. But this one isn't worth watching folks.

The Hobbit movies were riding on the wave of fan enthusiasm from the start, but Peter Jackson was probably thinking about his next movie. I want a refund. It broke canon over and over again, sure, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, and it was partly inevitable given that the Hobbit was made into a trilogy. The way he broke cannon though, was completely unnecessary and uninteresting. The plot often doesn't make sense, and some of that can be overlooked if you just stop thinking about it, so that's OK too. But the story was illogical in the most predictable ways. Actually, everything about the movie except for the graphics were bland. No humor, no surprises, no nothing! And that made it feel so painfully slow. You could tell exactly what was going to happen next, and it would take 30 minutes for it to happen. And sure, the effects were flashy, but they didn't make sense either. And the lines! The conversations are so pedantic and delivered over-dramatically. It was basically a stereotyping of an opera done in prose. Drama without subtlety or any level of complexity. Action without the suspense. One dimensional characters in overused one dimension plot lines. That pretty much sums it up.",1427241600,10,1382,4.734439834024896

5271108,5,B0095HHLMO,"THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR--(personally, the only movie I bothered to go to the theatre to watch on the big screen, everything else was awful!  This past year was a desert wasteland for movie entertainment--a point driven solidly home by the contrast of the Sound of Music special at the Oscars--compared to that God-awful ""American Sniper.""  The Golden Age of Movies, contrasted with Sniper, makes most of this past year's movies seem like so much rust!  No, I did not even bother to watch Sniper in the movies, nor do I intend to watch it for free on television--I have better things to do with my valuable time, like reread Tolkien or Baum or Beagle or Weis.)

As others have said, this movie was faithful to the legendary novel by the wondrous J.R.R. Tolkien we all grew up reading!  I'm glad Smaug didn't die so easily, and appreciated his conniving evil, demoralizing his foes who were quite obviously out to kill him.  (""Is that your child?  He will DIE while you watch...Bow-MAN!"")  Smaug coated briefly in molden gold was a marvelous idea and a spectacular special effect.  I'm also glad Jackson decided to make the ""black arrow"" an oversized iron projectile meant to  be fired from a windlass, instead of the puny looking thing in the cartoon of my childhood.  Obviously, Bard had to improvise, and lure Smaug into firing range--far too close for comfort--when he used his hastily rebuilt longbow, although I was looking forward to him using the windlass.

 The one or two mistakes I noticed would be nitpicking.  But, I suppose I should mention them: in the second movie, a big deal was made of using Kingsfoil, which had been done before, in Lord of the Rings.  Far better would've been the female elf ranger using elf-magic to cure Killi instead.  Also, in the movie, the small thrush had a larger role.  It was supposedly a magical creature, that could speak a language Bard could understand; in the cartoon, it carried a message from Bilbo to Bard: ""Aim for the missing scale in Smaug's chest!""  The other item is that these movies never should've  been made into three movies; two long ones would've been just fine!

When--not if, but when--Spielberg or Jackson decide to make the Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, and Dragons of Spring Dawning--I hope that it's half as well done as the Hobbit!  Other movies I'd love to see made into live versions: The Last Unicorn, Ariel, Elminster and Drizzt.  (If you don't know these books and characters, shame on you!  Go to your library or buy them on Amazon, and READ!)",1427241600,,2548,4.714932126696833

5271130,2,B0095HHLMO,"Tolkien briefly mentions a battle at the end of The Hobbit he calls the battle of the five armies.  Jackson decided to turn this footnote into a 2-hour epic slugfest.  He forgot, however, to make a movie in the process.  A film must have three acts - beginning, middle and end.  This film attempts instead to be all climax.  Unfortunately, the exact opposite occurs as there can be no crescendo without the requisite lulls.  Every one of the five previous Tolkien adaptations involved both collective and introspective journeys; the team would bond, the individuals would grow and their mettle would be tested in a battle or skirmish.  There is none of that here.  There is no more journey.  Characters stop evolving toward the end of Desolation of Smaug.  All that's left is a big interspecies battle that becomes desensitizing.  The action itself migrates from grand to hoakey as the filmmakers try desperately to invent new and creative ways for the waring factions to annihilate each other.  The fact of the matter is that there is not enough material in Tolkien's book to warrant three movies, two would have sufficed.  And, The Battle of the Five Armies should have been the 30-minute climax of the sequel.",1427241600,17,1212,4.853658536585366

Saw in the movies,  bought the dvds, blu ray trilogy,digital extensions. I watch one of the movies as background noise almost everyday.  I finally started the books. .. you get the point.

Well,  I was disappointed that I didn't experience this in the movies.  I waited for 3D blu ray to be released, even though digital copies were available. Do you know how much restraint was needed to stop myself from getting it sooner? I'm a digital junkie. Then after waiting for the kids to go to bed,  I got my white cheddar popcorn (on a diet)and 3D glasses and was ready. Boom! Action! Pandemonium... all to make the opening scene anti-climactic. I figured, they needed to save some room for the war! Although, I couldn't understand why they wouldn't just end Smaug with this scene and start off 5 Armies off with the dwarves fiasco.
Welp, all hands still in.  I waited... and.. waited... then it was over.
Finite.....
30 dollars down, 860 empty calories and a dead dragon later it was over.  I'm  asking myself what did I just see? Not even a little a capella for our fallen comrades? The only thing entertaining about this situation was how cool I still managed to look in 3D shades, face masque and head scarf.
I'm still wondering what just happened and who reviewed this thinking it was good.  Pick a 4 letter profanity on what a way to end this trilogy and its fitting.
I won't even get on Legolas' dull highlights.. no flare on one of my favorite characters.",1427241600,4,1621,4.57439446366782
5271133,2,B0095HHLMO,"Personally, I think these Hobbit movies got successively worse with each segment, meaning that the ""Battle of the Five Armies"" was the worst of the bunch. Or maybe I just had had enough after the disappointment of the previous two! This is so sad because the LOTR's movies were so very well done and while I will admit that the tone of the LOTR's is a bit darker than ""The Hobbit"", this is no way serves as a excuse to make a cartoonishly stupid, clich ridden and utterly CGI vomit-filled depiction of this classic story. But this is how they make action movies these days, dumbed down to the lowest common denominator and super hyped-up to sell all the ancillary merchandise that goes along with creating a multi-movie franchise. I actually felt sad for Martin Freeman in this movie because his character (Bilbo) was largely regulated to the background and any scenes with emotion came across as shallow and forced. The only thing I really liked about this movie was the closing song, ""The Last Goodbye"". At least it had some genuine emotion and it made me feel something for Tolkien's Middle Earth, which is something these Hobbit movies just didn't succeed in.",1427241600,5,1163,4.733990147783251
5271134,3,B0095HHLMO,"This movie is a shameless attempt to stretch out material. Period. I did the same thing in high school when I would write papers - use extra big font, double space everything, and increase the margins. Ha ha ha!

Just way too much CGI in this sucker, too. At some point all the special effects distract from the movie. Do we really need Legolas, who isn't even in the book, ""air walking"" up falling stone blocks? Remember, just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD.

And the whole girl-elf-loves-a-dwarf thing? Why? Oh, I get it, so your Wife has something to watch. The relationship was totally unbelievable, too, because they spent practically no time together. Man, I wish it were that easy in real life. Ha ha ha!

The one bright spot for me was the actor who plays Bilbo. He does a fantastic job!

I was angry with Jackson when he messed with the LOTR. His work on The Hobbit takes it to a whole new level. The Hobbit is one of the best fantasy books of all time for a reason - it's good! You don't have to change anything.",1427241600,9,1044,4.365979381443299

If you have kids and don't mind them watching senseless absurd violence where their favorite characters always win and come out unscathed then yeah, this movie is 5 stars.

Characters that didn't need to be CGIed were. Swords swinging but no blood, hit an orc on their heavy plate armored heads with a stick and they die. Orcs are black peopled in the LOTR movies. They get no love. lol  Another thing I learned is if you're white, you're automatically good and if you're a main character all you have to do is spin in circles with your wooded staff and short sword and you'll immediately vanquish 500 enemies.

2 and half hour movie and I knew the outcome every scene as it started.

I would have liked to have PJ sort of do an ""epilogue"" to follow how the fortune was divided between the elves, men and dwarves and what became of the company of dwarves. There could have been a ""funeral"" scene for Oakenshield which would have ended the movie well rather than that useless part where Bilbo' comes home to discover his housewares being auctioned-off.

Of course, I am hoping when the ""extended version"" of ""The Hobbitt: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is released that it will perhaps have some scenes that will help fill-in-the gaps of what became of the Lonely Mountain now that Smaug was destroyed.",1427155200,2,871,4.730263157894737

The sad deaths of three of the protagonists, and the broken heart suffered by Tauriel did take away from the film's ending - I am a sucker for a happy ending. However it was of high enough quality that it certainly was not a disappointment.

The pictorial effects were all quite good - the sound, CGI effects, and details paid to elements like costume and weaponry were above industry standard. The story was almost entirely the brainchild of the modern writers and the film producer. However, it did provide enough links to the first three films that it could be said that this did serve its purpose - an explanation of many of the initial events of the initial Lord of the Rings trilogy.

5271217,4,B0095HHLMO,"I get the impression that a lot of reviewers are jaded or jealous.  This movie is a very good fantasy.  Epic in scale.  Visuals that leave you in awe.  A moving soundtrack.  Acting of the highest order.  You really could not ask for a better quality fantasy movie.  We have been spoiled a bit by Jackson's previous films, a few of which are better than this one.  But this film, on its own merit, is a classic worth owning.

It follows the book well, but it also improves upon the book a thousand fold.

Weak Spots:

1) CGI that is too fake at times (e.g. Thorin's cousin Dain on his boar)
2) Gandalf is useless in this film.  How about some magic?
3) Bilbo does a few key things, but largely he is not the protagonist, which causes the movie to lose a lot of its heart.
4) You will hate a few of the dwarves you have come to love in the last two movies.
5) The evil army brings a few gargantuan beings to the party, but fails to use them.  Not the trolls.
6) The stupid eagles come to save the day--a deus ex machina which the book uses as well.
7) War without blood.  How stupid is that?  Heads get chopped off, people get slashed, creatures fall great distances, etc. but no blood!?!  Big mistake.  Big turn-off.  Just because it is labelled ""fantasy"" does not mean it does not need to be realistic!

Strong Points:

1) The action scenes, ESPECIALLY in the last third of the film, are amazing.  Expendables: Middle Earth
2) The characters we do root for are excellent--Tauriel, Legolas, Bard.
3) The slimy assistant to the former Lord is quite funny and unpredictable.
4) Some great characters die.  Gives the movie its proper tension and suspense.
5) The orc army is a frightening force of monstrous beings put to good use.  Inventive siege engines and a motley crew of scary warriors who act more intelligently than you'd expect.
6) Interesting camera angles and beautiful settings abound in this movie.

Top notch effects, a lot of action, and beautiful visuals make this a keeper.  What it lacks in story it makes up for in pure fantasy goodness.",1426982400,2,2053,4.439678284182306

5271222,5,B0095HHLMO,"Couple giant holes in this interpretation. Golem is one of the human riverfolk and in fact not a hobbit. Hobbits don't go fishing and are immune to the power draw of the ring. Golem and his buddy fought over the ring because of its power and were fishing when it happened. Next, Sauron had no idea what hobbits were when he sent the dark riders to find them, yet Golem had worn the ring so long that Sauron had intimate knowledge of Golem and had even captured Golem at one point, but had no idea what hobbits are. This leads straight back to really Golem was a human riverfolk and was fishing on the river when he found the ring and lived off fish his entire like just like good human riverfolk do. Smaug didn't know what a hobbit is either, yet he knew what that ring is. How is it that Smaug didn't know a hobbit held the one ring all this time, because it was a human riverfolk named Golem that held the ring. This surprised Smaug because he didn't know what a hobbit is and that Bilbo was now the owner. There are many more misguided clues that point out Golem was not a hobbit because Sauron had no idea what hobbits were. Having said all that, this collective interpretation of a movie is not what the original books portrayed as a story, yet it does get close enough to many of the important parts to make it thoroughly enjoyable to watch. I would however highly recommend reading the books sometime to find out what the real story is.",1426896000,2,1443,4.3088235294117645
5271223,5,B0095HHLMO,"One of the most hilariously bad movies I've ever seen.  Completely convinced Jackson was well aware of what he was making and just went for it.  Watch it with friends prone to riffing, especially if they are sci-fi/fantasy fans.",1426896000,,228,4.82051282051282
5271224,4,B0095HHLMO,"The last installment of the ""Hobbit"" adventure series through the vision of Peter Jackson.  The Hobbit character himself has a strong transformation, & really becomes a noble, likable, and charismatic individual who in some ways also transforms himself from a follower to a leader.

 Ian McKellen's Gandoff is also very good, a strong and wise character who's intellect and morality build the foundation of the ""good guy"" cause together trying to sustain some form of alliance between these hostile and at odds allies.  We see a very good ""final bout"" act between the sinister leader of the Orchs take on Oakenshield hand to hand to the death.  We also see Oakenshield's own inner development and soul transformation maturing from a greedy self absorbed, power hungry bully and jerk, to that of a better man in the end and true friend to Bilbo the Hobbit.

 The only big problems I had with this movie had been the start of the film we are brought back to the horrific ""other worldly"" battle with Smaug the Dragon, (who talks WAY too much in both films), where the hero pretty much immediately kills him off before this adventure gets started.  This is Peter Jackson's method of breaking up both films and his choice and taste is in stark contradiction to anything I would have done.

 I would have ""Smaug"" & the treasure hunt be the focus of the second film, where the heroes get attacked by him, fight him, have a duel of wits, have the dragon kill lots of people, and ultimately kill him in the end, & that is where the second film should have ended allowing the third film to start with the plot and newer focus.  Dragging the second film's climax into the first five minutes of the third film, where hours were devoted toward that character, only to kill him off quickly and jump into the final act's plot is absolutely bad editing.

 Second, how can we call the human Army of peasants a real Army???  That group represents a military force?  Bad example and not believable and for these two reasons I have to give this other wise awesome and very fun movie for most ages a B+ instead of an A, with four instead of five stars.  Two thumbs up for the final act of ""The Hobbit"".",1426896000,,2181,4.553846153846154

5271240,3,B0095HHLMO,"enjoyable but I really wish there had been only 2 movies and not 3. This last installment really felt like they (the producers and writers) were creating filler scenes just to stretch the movie out to maintain the 2 hr plus length we've come to expect from the Tolkien movie remakes from Jackson. After enduring an entire second film covering the walk from the wood elves' home to the 'lonely mountain,' and the hour or so of smaug and Bilbo talking, the 2 or 3 minutes spent on the death of smaug in the third seemed like a cheat. It literally was...shoot the arrow -and in true Jackson style, no regular ballista would do- and then seeing smaug get hit, fly up, and then die. The end. Even smaug's last moments seemed cheap. His 'glowing' eye really reminded of a piece of cheap plastic being back lit, and when it flickered out (to signal him dying, of course) it really did seem like a light bulb flicker out. I rented the film first, and then decided to buy it. I ONLY bought it because I had bought every other Tolkien film. What can I say? I'll take any of Tolkien's work and characters any what I can find them. I can never get enough of that world Mr. Tolkien created. His story-craft is what got me started on my path as a true book lover.

5271362,4,B0095HHLMO,"The subtitle says it all. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is pretty much non-stop battle action, from an impressive opening sequence when the dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) torches a city, until the converging armies battle and the final arrow is shot. So yes, this 144-minute film is rated PG-13 because of extended sequences of intense fantasy action violence and frightening images. Theres no sex, no bad language, and no adult situations to speak of, except for warfare.

The philosopher Bertrand Russell once remarked, War does not determine who is rightonly who is left. That wordplay aptly describes the third film in the Hobbit trilogy. With so much fighting and no build-up to speak of, the main suspense comes from seeing who will be the last ones standing and whether any major characters in J.R.R. Tolkiens Middle-earth will die.

Of course, if you can keep all the characters straight and remember who appears in The Lord of the Rings, youll have more emotional investment in what happens and have more of a clue, since the book that inspired the film series was written as a prequel. Given the three Lord of the Rings and three Hobbit films that Jackson has made, its strange to think that Tolkiens books are considered classics of childrens literature. But when you read of battles, the violence is whatever a young reader can imagine. Thats not the case with film, hence the PG-13 rating.

For his last foray into Middle-earth, Jackson broke up a single book into three film installments, so the third film functions as a third actmeaning, unlike some trilogies or sequels, The Battle of the Five Armies will seem impossibly confusing to anyone who hasn't seen (or remembered) the first two installments. It will seem like what it is:  all climax and no plot development or complications. Yes, five armies are converging, but if you're approaching this cold or have forgotten the first two films, whats missing is why we should care. The only takeaway in this case is that old motivating force, greedgreed for power, greed for goldand a genocidal undercurrent.

In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012), the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) convinces the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) to journey with Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) and 13 dwarves on a quest to reclaim their ancestral Arkenstone from the Lonely Mountain, which is guarded by the talking, flying, fire-breathing dragon Smaug.

In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013), the questers reach the mountain, but their mortal enemies, the Orcs, and their crazed leader Azog are in pursuit, seeking to defeat all other races and rule the Middle-earth. Meanwhile, Gandalf the Grey travels to the ruins of Dol Guldur, the wizard Saurons stronghold, to investigate another emerging evil.

The Battle of the Five Armies ends where the second installment left off, with Smaug attacking Laketown and Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) still imprisoned because his fellow men people blamed him for awakening Smaug. Meanwhile, Thorin and the Dwarves prepare to defend the mountain they occupy, while Azog and one army approaches, and another Orc army with Goblins and giant bats led by Bolg also approaches. So does the Dwarf army, and the Elf army.

What redeems The Battle of the Five Armies for the merely confused is the incredible art design and special effects that Jackson has employed to bring Middle-earth and all its denizens to life. The action is superbly realistic, and the set decoration sometimes makes you believe that Middle-earth exists. A terrific transfer to Blu-ray disc brings everything to life in amazing fashion, and with a fully immersive DTS-HD MA 7.1 soundtrack.

I watched with my 17-year-old son, and the two of us kept remarking on how spectacular everything looked and sounded. He liked it better than the first installment but not as much as the second; I liked it as part of a series that, overall, Id rate an A-. But its as hard (and unfair) to rate this single film as it would be to rate a film that consisted only of the big fight scene in Rocky, without the benefit of seeing any of his training or backstory. Count me among those who think that the first and third films in the trilogy would have become stronger had Jackson split the material into two films, as he originally thought to do. That said, fans of fantasy and action films may like The Battle of the Five Armies as is, since theres probably no less character or plot development here than there is in a genre blockbuster like The Expendables.

Language:  N/A
Sex:  N/A
Violence:  Nonstop, with one beheading but at least no blood spurting
Adult situations: Warfare only
Takeaway:  Greed and intolerance are the banes of existence

No need to double dip (seriously why do they do this to us?) Anyway, don't listen to the naysayers who claim Peter Jackson went all George Lucas on us with these films. The Hobbit Trilogy as a whole is visually gorgeous with excellent storytelling (I actually don't mind that they split this into three movies and added a lot of stuff from other Tolkien works that relate to the hobbit. Let's face it, if Jackson and company didn't make those additions fan boys would still be angry). I have read all of Tolkien's works (granted it has been awhile) and really don't see any betrayal here. There were a great number of liberties taken with The Lord of the Rings films and yet nobody complains about those. No matter. The Hobbit Trilogy is amazing.

5271409,5,B0095HHLMO,"First, I would like to talk about the package. The design could not have been better this time around. There is a terrific painting of Bilbo returning to The Shire as well as a portray of the map of Erebor that made me gasp when I saw it. Then, the amazing concept art printed on each of the five discs are an absolute joy to watch. The only thing that is missing is a booklet, but at least each disc tells you exactly what part of the movie or the extras you are playing.

Regarding the extras, the 9 + hours of content make this the best one in the series. There is just so many things to watch: from how the production played, how each of the actors felt when they were closing in the production deadline, loads of interesting artistic decisions, creative differences with Del Toro, a great overview on the use of locations, and many, many more things. Trust me, as far as extras is concerned, this is one of the most complete DVDs you will find. Now, let's continue with the movie review.

As far as The Hobbit's movies go, I would say this movie is by much the best one in the series. Not only it managed to catch the essence of Tolkien's most personal thoughts --the certainty of death and the pain that comes by watching a friend as he/she dies--, but also introduced some lasting innovations that were not seen in the Lord of The Rings saga. I do not mean by this that Peter Jackson has in any way surpassed his previous take on Tolkien, being that the Lord of The Rings trilogy is my all-time favorite trilogy -and the same goes for many people-, but I do mean he has allowed his cast to express certain emotions and desires in ways that he could not achieve in the Rings' movies.

The first novelty would no doubt be the madness and ill-thoughts that overwhelm Thorin's mind. The close up to a sick man's thoughts and desires that are to his mind entirely reasonable --because of his being astray, of course- permits us to delve into that realm of fear, passion and anger. We constantly play sane. We feel we can control our lives and emotions, but more often than not we just lose it and become controlled by our own thoughts. Thorin's ""dragon sickness"" is nothing more than a depiction of one of those instances in which we shouldn't called ourselves ""sane"" or ""reasonable"", but one that has been constructed so perfectly that his reminiscence has come to last.

The second one would be the manner in which Peter Jackson portrayed Elves this time around. In The Ring's trilogy we saw them as guardians of the forest, as caring, loving protectors which, although they could be deadly if they felt threatened, as soon as that barrier was taken down they became pleasant folk. In Tolkien's books, this could certainly be said about Rivendell Elves and perhaps about most of Lothlorien's, but never about Mirkwood Elves. Never before were Elves represented best than in this movie. Tolkien always though of them as haughty, greedy, selfish and unforgiving folk, and Peter Jackson nailed it with Lee Pace's depiction of Thranduil. At the start of the movie, he does not care about matters involving other races -especially Dwarfs-, so he shows his worst face. But after the tragic events that follow he becomes somewhat reasonable, growing above his own true-self.

Last but not least, there is the character of Bilbo. At the beginning of the first movie, he was a shy ""forgive me"" and ""sorry"" hobbit who thought adventures were of very bad taste and never had dreamed about becoming an adventurer himself. This time around, and for the joy of those of us who love ""The Hobbit"" book, Martin Freeman has made a progression in his representation of Bilbo exactly in the way that Tolkien tells us in the book. He goes from shy to brave, and from asking permission to taking the initiative. Overall, he becomes the hero of the story, for the joy of Thorin's company and ours alike.

In a sense, almost every part of this movie felt exactly right --unless you prefer a word by word representation of the book, which frankly, it is not my taste- while bringing innovation at the same time. The terrifying spirit of Sauron, the most feared foe of Middle-earth, vanishing from the reach of Gandalf, Elrond and Galadriel and giving rise to a new era of chaos is one of those jewels the movie gives us for our own delight. And I only just revealed a glimpse of what the movie offers. By all accounts, if you are an all-time Tolkien fan or even if you are not, but you loved the Lord of The Rings trilogy, this is a movie you shouldn't miss. This is a movie that will make you watch The Ring's saga again because it constantly remembers us of whence it came. And that's just a joy to experience. Believe me, watch the movie and you will not be disappointed.",1426118400,19,4753,4.52093023255814

5271414,4,B0095HHLMO,"For the last decade and a half, Peter Jackson has been bringing audiences to the legendary world of JRR Tolkien's Middle-Earth.

And for the moment, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies"" is the final piece in this cinematic tapestry -- the big action-packed climax to the first half of this story. While it has some weak spots (such as the whole awkward subplot involving Tauriel), it packs a devastating wallop to anyone who has come to love the characters over the past two movies, from the stubborn Dwarf king Thorin to the doughty little Hobbit.

Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) is only barely stopped by Bard (Luke Evans), who manages to take down the dragon with his black arrow... but not before Smaug destroys Laketown. Bard becomes the de facto leader of the refugees, who find themselves starving and homeless as winter approaches. Thranduil (Lee Pace) comes to help them with food and other supplies, but he's also there to back up Bard's claim on a share of the Dwarvish gold, and reclaim a certain item from Erebor.

Meanwhile, the White Council comes to Dol Guldur to rescue Gandalf from the mysterious Necromancer. And they soon find that he was right about the Necromancer's true identity, and the horrifying spectres that are rising to menace the world. And Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) head to the fortress of Gundabad to figure out what is going on with the orcs.

And back at the Lonely Mountain, Thorin (Richard Armitage) is seized by ""dragon sickness,"" a lust for treasure that makes him a paranoid wreck unmoved by the two armies massing on his doorstep. Bilbo must take desperate measures to keep Thorin's mad greed from starting a war -- but when Dwarf and Orc armies arrive, war between the armies becomes an inevitability.

""The Battle of Five Armies"" is best appreciated as the final part of one very, very long movie. ""An Unexpected Journey"" set the scene and began the journey slowly, and ""The Desolation of Smaug"" was an increasingly tense build to the climax. This movie IS that climax -- at least half of it is an epic battle between multiple armies, swinging between different characters in a multilayered battle royale.

Expect lots of bloody duels on the ice, elven acrobatics, and a ragged army of angry fishermen running through a ruined city. Just as it seems that the good guys are about to win, they're suddenly bludgeoned by a new attack that leaves them crippled and desperate. And the bloody consequences of the battle isn't limited just to nameless extras -- some characters whom viewers will have grown to love will die, and Jackson gives their deaths the painful pathos they deserve.

But Jackson hasn't lost his touch for the quieter moments. The aftermath of Smaug's death has a haunting quality as the Dwarves wander their ruined halls, and the audience sees Thorin growing progressively more detached from reality. And the movie's final scenes are bittersweet ones -- the everyday world seemed stained with blood and shadowed by the presence of Sauron. Things suddenly feel unbalanced and uneasy, even if the sun is shining and spring has come again.

But there are some things that really should have been cut, such as the rather silly romance subplot -- it feels like the studio decided, ""Female viewers won't watch unless there's romance!"" and demanded one that makes little sense. And with the Master gone, the character of Alfred becomes less villainous sidekick and more annoyance.

But one thing nobody can complain about is the acting. Martin Freeman's Bilbo is sometimes eclipsed by the dark, brooding, hubris-crippled Thorin, but he remains the amiable heart of a big, splashy, action-packed movie. Armitage is the other half of the movie's soul, slowly twisted by his decades-long obsession with regaining Erebor, and his increasingly mad lust for its gold. His final gut-wrenching scene with Freeman is absolutely perfect, bringing their troubled friendship -- and Thorin's classic hubris -- to its inevitable conclusion.

There are also excellent smaller performances by Ken Stott as the grandfatherly Balin, McKellen as a rather battered, desperate Gandalf, John Bell as Bard's tough teen son, and Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee in one brief, intense scene at Dol Guldur. Lilly and Bloom are a bit wasted, though -- they don't have a lot to do, plotwise.

Two particular scene-stealers are Evans and Pace, as the two kings -- one old and one new -- who butt heads with Thorin. Evans brings a passionate, desperate energy to Bard's role as a loving father, and easily extends that same protective care to all the people from Laketown. And we see a bit of Thranduil's raw pain and grief under his haughty smirk, when he wanders past the bloodied bodies of slain Elves.

""The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies"" is top-heavy on action and tragedy both, filling in the last gap in the saga of the hobbits and the One Ring. It has some missteps, but the passion and grief make it a powerful experience. And all the brilliant, epic action scenes don't hurt either.",1426032000,5,5065,4.911111111111111

This movie is very entertaining and has fantastic effects and great acting, but I have to say that I felt something was ""missing"" after it was over.

And when Elrond says to the ""Nine"" you should have stayed dead, was a nice touch that I imagine even J.R.R. would enjoyed.  Peter Jackson's imagery of Middle Earth no matter how bad he strayed from the books was just about flawless.

If you liked any of the first two, I'm most sure you'll enjoy this one a lot, but I'm a movie watcher that likes closure even though I know a trilogy or series continues on to the final so that may be another reason I favor this one. Again all IMO (In My Opinion).",1425945600,,310,3.859375

Bilbo rarely had any lines in this movie. Almost non existent.

But all in all, an ok movie.

5271492,3,B0095HHLMO,"This movie, like the others in the Hobbit trilogy, felt forced and rushed. Which is probably exactly what Peter Jackson felt to even create the movies in the first place. The passion and the magic of the LOTR trilogy was just simply not the same here, yet again. Cinematography, costumes, special effects...all great. Script was oftentimes predictable, boring, unnecessary and even groan-worthy at certain parts. I actually got up to do other things about half-way through it.
I bought it strictly out of loyalty for what was created in the LOTR movies.",1425945600,,553,5.021739130434782

5271495,3,B0095HHLMO,"No details or spoilers here (you know how it ends anyway).  Just a bit disappointing.  The romance triangle was unnecessary and, frankly ridiculous. True love after 5 lines of dialogue.  Oh well, that's Hollywood (and a criticism of many other films).  Maybe I'm simply spoiled from other films in  this and the previous series but the story and set pieces seemed hollow or underdeveloped.  I think it's difficult material to translate and I believe the director/cast did an admirable job overall.  But ... *whine* you only see Beorne for 10 seconds (okay a bit of a detail, there).  Anyway, it's a 4 star review compared to most movies but a 3-star review compared to other LOTR and Hobbit films.",1425945600,2,697,4.798319327731092

5271501,3,B0095HHLMO,"I missed this in the theater so was pretty excited to see it on Kindle HD. Boy was I disappointed. The emotional depth present most of Peter Jackson's other films was practically nonexistent here. Basically it was just an all out slugfest between CGI armies. Which, in this day and time, is pretty darn boring. The entire Hobbit series, in fact, was a step in the wrong direction. The deep characterization and solid acting and compelling storyline present in the LOTR series was almost entirely absent from the Hobbit films. Reminds me in many ways of the Star Wars series, with Lucas' disastrous handling of what had originally been quite brilliant (though the new Star Wars series admittedly was MUCH worse than the Hobbit trilogy). All in all I am very disappointed. Instead of feeling sadness at the series' conclusion, I feel relief.",1425945600,11,839,4.874125874125874

5271510,4,B0095HHLMO,"I am a fan of the entire series and watched each intently.  The buildup is made much better by this the final closing act.  My biggest complaint is that it feels like the normal progression this series has always had seemed to deal with the characters and following up.  I am absolutely shocked that the closing act did not have more follow up to their individual later lives and I hoped it would be here however there has to be some deleted scenes or something because it seems abnormally ""chopped"".  It has all that is necessary to make it great but not to make it a legacy type movie as it should have been.  I loved it is is good, just missing a few final moments that in my opinion would have made it great and unforgettable.  The acting in this series was superb even better than the LOTR series in my opinion and if you are a fan then it is a must buy however I should have waited for the extended version or the missing scenes version.  Maybe someone has something other than the digital copy could remark if this was available on blu ray or DVD.

It stays close enough to the book that readers will enjoy it while adding just the right amount of cinematic magic to really bring the story to life.

5271586,3,B0095HHLMO,"As are all Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptions, this movie looks as great as the previous. The Hobbit trilogy was pretty well cast. Especially Martin Freeman's Bilbo. The problem I have with the adaptions is the changing of the history of the characters. Or the addition of characters or incidences that didn't exist in the book. To make one book into 3 movies is okay if you actually stay faithful to the story and history of Middle Earth. Which it hasn't.  ( The Hobbit is a smaller story than any three of the LOTR trilogy books)
Now, I wish PJ would of done the Lord of the Rings in 6 movies. Which would make sense. Each book of the Lord of the Rings is actually two books. And perhaps the LOTR movies could of been done more like the books. I'll go step further and now say I wish all the Tolkien books were adapted as a mini series on HBO or Showtime. ala Game of Thrones.
I'm not sure why PJ changed the storylines or history in his film versions? Does he think his story is better than the Masters? (Tolkien) I love all the movies Jackson has done but they sorely disappoint me with changes he made that make no sense. It's one thing to condense a book somewhat for the film adaption. But , a whole other thing when he adds scenes and characters that were not even in the book.",1425945600,,1284,4.283950617283951

5271591,1,B0095HHLMO,"Capping an unnecessary trilogy is the by far worst entry into Middle Earth with the Battle of the Five Armies. A horrific screenplay on top of cliche cinematography creates boredom and nearly laughter. If I didn't love the original trilogy so much, I may have written off Peter Jackson as a bloated amateur. It's simply stunning how far the hobbit is in quality compared to LOTR. And for all the film buffs out there, its not just the change in frame rate. This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched and its because of the poor writing. I am most adamently disappointed.",1425945600,8,579,4.523809523809524

I agree that some parts are really stretched a bit and with mediocre actors these look really boring.

It did not live up to expectations, and I went to see the film for a second time I hoping that I would enjoy it more after another try. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy made me feel something when I walked out of the theater, especially at the conclusion of the Return of the King. The Battle of the Five Armies however, left me feeling a resounding nothing. Peter Jackson took an amazing book and stretched it, added things from the appendices, added his own ideas, and created a film that was nothing but mediocre at best. While the Lord of the Rings was an epic film trilogy I can't help but feel Peter Jackson's Hobbit Trilogy was more of an epic failure.",1425945600,18,767,4.370629370629371

Where in the LOTR he simplified the story and characters to make the story run smoother and enable character development, in this and the previous installment of the Hobbit he creates his own ""OCs (other characters)"" to sidetrack the story and pull from the real character development of Thorin and Bilbo.  Honestly, this story belongs on a fanfiction site titled, ""An Elf Gets a Crush on a Dwarf"" or ""Legalos--Before LOTR.""",1425772800,5,588,4.979591836734694
5271680,2,B0095HHLMO,"Yes, Were-worms, right there in Middle-Earth...
That shows how far the movie is from the letter and  -- worse -- the spirit of the book.

It is clear what happened: Hobbit should have been a single, stand-alone movie.
But then the studio realized they can make several 100 million extra by producing a trilogy.

So yet another movie had to be filled up with enough stuff somehow -- and so we get endless fight scenes that are just laugh-out-loud silly.

Think of an early cartoon movie, something like Mickey, Goofy and Donald Duck against Peg-Leg Pete.

We also get more cringe-inducing dwarf-on-elf loving, more of the really annoying brood of Bard the Bowman (who for some reason scream ""DA'd"" every time they see him), more of Legolas (Legolas ?!?) working through his daddy issues and acting up against gravity, Thorin going psychotic over his gold (""the dragon in my head is telling me to do bad things...""), there are war pigs and commando mountain goats and Beorn is making a combat air-drop. And were-worms, of course.
As a side show there are Gandalf And The Gang battling Sauron (featuring Kung-Fu Saruman and Blue-Face Galadriel), oh, and more of what The White Orc has been up to (Peter Jackson's Moby Dick ?).

All the while the pacing of the whole thing is so poorly done that it is never clear when and how the battle, after which the movie is named, actually ended.
The last thing we hear of the battle as such is when the elven king decides to cut and run from it (which he, of course, didn't do in the book).
Then everything devolves even further into the above-mentioned cartoonish one-on-one slapstick fights.

There is also nothing of the important concluding parts of the book, things such as Thorin being buried with the Arkenstone and Kili and Fili by his sides, Dain becoming King Under the Mountain, Dale being rebuilt with Bard as King and elves, humans and dwarves reconciling.
Instead Bilbo just kind of shuffles off after inviting the dwarves for tea in Bags-End.

It makes you wonder if somewhere around the middle of the movie the production team themselves lost track and also didn't care or maybe couldn't take it any longer (or all of the above) and just wanted to be done with it.

There are some nice landscape shots and costumes and most of the actors can be seen to struggle valiantly against this dud of a script, so it's 2 Stars instead of just 1.",1425772800,44,2389,4.64218009478673

5271683,2,B0095HHLMO,"A movie that could have been much better.  The actor's did their jobs splendidly unfortunately they could not save the script.  Never has so much talent been so wasted by the writers.  The source material is vast for this movie, more than twenty books, letters and essays.  The script written is lazy and shows a lack of respect for the World Tolkien created, filled with overused tropes and cliches, the acting is professional the script amateur hour.  Good god they borrow from Dune or is it Tremors.  Nothing like that existed in Tolkien's universe.  The drama of the battle is lost in the sheer length of it.  The crowning of Dain, the establishment of Dale under Bard and the honor given Thorin, Fili and Kili ignored.  It is a long battle piece based on the work of an author that hated War, a man who had been there and done that in the trenches of WW1.  The Battle of Five Armies is a remarkably short chapter in the book which explains the weakness of the movie, they were creating on their own  The best parts of all the Movies is where they stick to the source, it became rarer and rare as time went by through six movies.

I can only hope that Jackson never gets rights to the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales or the HOME series.  I shudder to think what they would do to Beren and Luthien.  Probably an idiot  love triangle in a story of love that broke the boundaries of death.",1425772800,8,1389,4.413385826771654

There is no nudity and foul language. They are the remaining good things.

There is very little character development except the one that deals with greed. It shows gold does change people. However, the development is too brief to make a long lasting impression. So, this picture is not as deep as Lord of the Rings.

Wow! It took in more than 950 million dollars! Very few movies did that.

According to slashfilm dot com/the-hobbit-budget/ posted on Wednesday, October 22nd, 2014 by Germain Lussier,
the budget for The Hobbit Trilogy was probably around 800 million dollars.

Based on that figure, this last Hobbit film took in more than 3 times its costs. What an investment!

5271735,2,B0095HHLMO,"This movie was simply awful.  When the LoTR trilogy was completed and I had seen all three films I very much believed that Peter Jackson and the rest of the crew had done their absolute best to stay true to Tolkien's work.  Yes some things were omitted and others were added but some of that is necessary when adapting literature to cinema.  What works on the page doesn't always work on film.  The changes that were made were all (or nearly all) necessary and everyone worked hard to maintain their artistic integrity.  Then we are all glove slapped in the face with the collective pile of cinematic emesis that is the Hobbit trilogy.  From beginning to end all three movies felt incredibly over done.  Extra action sequences that weren't in the novel, extra characters that weren't in the novel, a romantic love triangle sub-plot that completely muddied the story.  The Hobbit movies did not make me feel like I had been magically transported to Middle-Earth, instead they constantly reminded me that I paid $20 to let Hollywood barf in my eyes and ears.

That doesn't mean the movie was *all* bad however.  The actors all did amazing work.  The CGI was cutting edge (though I've long ceased to be impressed by good CGI, instead now I've rather come to expect it).  Really the films only major problem is it's director's and producer's inability exercise a little self restraint and their willingness to sacrifice the integrity of both the book and the film in order to make money.  Oh, speaking of money I'm pretty sure they are going to end up owing the estate of Frank Herbert some a bit, because those ""Earth-Eaters"" or wtfever they were sure looked alot like an Arakan sand worm.

5271740,5,B0095HHLMO,"The movie that close the curtain on the second trilogy inspired by Tolkien works.

Among the 3, is probably the best one; the most emotional too.
After watching the LOTR trilogy, this movie offer very little surprises; mostly it is like watching any movie from Michael Bay...you know what you will find, you know the kind of shots that you will see, and you know that there will be explosion, plenty of them.

With Jackson,you know that there will be gore, there will be Legolas doing stunts (even if he was not even supposed to be here), there will be a strong female character (in this case 2 of them, one of the 2 did not even exist in the lore), and of course, you will have plenty of battles among a ton of people.

But this does not mean that is necessarily a bad thing after all. The movie is paced very well; it does not take you to the tedious of the first, nor to the extreme action of the second, where things never slow down. Here you get a good mix between action, slow moments and most of all, you get good development of the characters, which is another trademark of the works of PJ based on Tolkien.

The action sequences are marvelous; you can get lost on the big screen, at the orgy of gorgeous visuals; but watch it in SD, and the movie show all its limits and CG mashup. In some cases the difference is pretty pronounced, but considering the amount of work done, it can be forgiven. The novelty of the first trilogy just went away, so now the viewer look at things and is able to see the difference. Can't compare it with one single movie, since the work needed to make 3 is much more, but that goes to the nitpick.

The emotional parts are in between and very touching; I was not the only one to shed tears when it came out, and watching it again moves me in the same way. There is friendship and other feelings that we often forget about, there is loyalty and respect; and the movies build up the friendship between Bilbo and the rest of the company, to the point where he is respected and treated as equal, in comparison to the first movie, where he was basically a liability. The ending is touching, and is different from the movie, but I really enjoyed it, because it add something to the story that we all know. The romantic story, didn't have the same impact; was mostly put there because FW need to have this stuff in the movie; she need to put the pink ribbon in a product that otherwise is 99% dominated by male, violence and such. I was OK even without the romance, although it saved itself in the end, when we see how Thranduil in fact, show how he really is, while talking with Tauriel. Love cause suffering at times, and people try to fix it, forgetting how to love, to not suffer again.

One thing that was not in the book, but that I enjoyed, was the battle between the white council and the nine at the fortress; pure fiction galore there; but it was done with such taste that it fits perfectly; and it is a pleasure to see how Galadriel help Gandalf (revealing also their mutual feelings for each other), and how Saruman and Elrond put a fight against the ring wraits (obviously it was not CL that dd the fight scene, but it was a great way to show how powerful the white Maiar was, before getting corrupted). This is the only time that something was made out of the blue, and I really enjoyed it.

The Smaug fight was disappointing, but considering that Smaug had most of his time in the second movie, it is understandable.

In the end, the movie is a great piece of work; it put a sad end on the trilogy, but it is most likely the best of the 3.
I suggest it if you like PJ works; I may not suggest it if you are a purist of Tolkien, since this is loosely based on the original story; I heard people bashed it badly for all the changes made, but you must look at it for what it is, not for what you were hoping that it would be.

5 stars more than deserved; now I wait patiently for the release of the extended edition trilogy, so it can take place beside the first extended edition trilogy, and be passed on to future generations.",1425600000,6,4071,4.249354005167959

5271747,4,B0095HHLMO,"For the last decade and a half, Peter Jackson has been bringing audiences to the legendary world of JRR Tolkien's Middle-Earth.

And for the moment, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies"" is the final piece in this cinematic tapestry -- the big action-packed climax to the first half of this story. While it has some weak spots (such as the whole awkward subplot involving Tauriel), it packs a devastating wallop to anyone who has come to love the characters over the past two movies, from the stubborn Dwarf king Thorin to the doughty little Hobbit.

Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) is only barely stopped by Bard (Luke Evans), who manages to take down the dragon with his black arrow... but not before Smaug destroys Laketown. Bard becomes the de facto leader of the refugees, who find themselves starving and homeless as winter approaches. Thranduil (Lee Pace) comes to help them with food and other supplies, but he's also there to back up Bard's claim on a share of the Dwarvish gold, and reclaim a certain item from Erebor.

Meanwhile, the White Council comes to Dol Guldur to rescue Gandalf from the mysterious Necromancer. And they soon find that he was right about the Necromancer's true identity, and the horrifying spectres that are rising to menace the world. And Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) head to the fortress of Gundabad to figure out what is going on with the orcs.

And back at the Lonely Mountain, Thorin (Richard Armitage) is seized by ""dragon sickness,"" a lust for treasure that makes him a paranoid wreck unmoved by the two armies massing on his doorstep. Bilbo must take desperate measures to keep Thorin's mad greed from starting a war -- but when Dwarf and Orc armies arrive, war between the armies becomes an inevitability.

""The Battle of Five Armies"" is best appreciated as the final part of one very, very long movie. ""An Unexpected Journey"" set the scene and began the journey slowly, and ""The Desolation of Smaug"" was an increasingly tense build to the climax. This movie IS that climax -- at least half of it is an epic battle between multiple armies, swinging between different characters in a multilayered battle royale.

Expect lots of bloody duels on the ice, elven acrobatics, and a ragged army of angry fishermen running through a ruined city. Just as it seems that the good guys are about to win, they're suddenly bludgeoned by a new attack that leaves them crippled and desperate. And the bloody consequences of the battle isn't limited just to nameless extras -- some characters whom viewers will have grown to love will die, and Jackson gives their deaths the painful pathos they deserve.

But Jackson hasn't lost his touch for the quieter moments. The aftermath of Smaug's death has a haunting quality as the Dwarves wander their ruined halls, and the audience sees Thorin growing progressively more detached from reality. And the movie's final scenes are bittersweet ones -- the everyday world seemed stained with blood and shadowed by the presence of Sauron. Things suddenly feel unbalanced and uneasy, even if the sun is shining and spring has come again.

But there are some things that really should have been cut, such as the rather silly romance subplot -- it feels like the studio decided, ""Female viewers won't watch unless there's romance!"" and demanded one that makes little sense. And with the Master gone, the character of Alfred becomes less villainous sidekick and more annoyance.

But one thing nobody can complain about is the acting. Martin Freeman's Bilbo is sometimes eclipsed by the dark, brooding, hubris-crippled Thorin, but he remains the amiable heart of a big, splashy, action-packed movie. Armitage is the other half of the movie's soul, slowly twisted by his decades-long obsession with regaining Erebor, and his increasingly mad lust for its gold. His final gut-wrenching scene with Freeman is absolutely perfect, bringing their troubled friendship -- and Thorin's classic hubris -- to its inevitable conclusion.

There are also excellent smaller performances by Ken Stott as the grandfatherly Balin, McKellen as a rather battered, desperate Gandalf, John Bell as Bard's tough teen son, and Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee in one brief, intense scene at Dol Guldur. Lilly and Bloom are a bit wasted, though -- they don't have a lot to do, plotwise.

Two particular scene-stealers are Evans and Pace, as the two kings -- one old and one new -- who butt heads with Thorin. Evans brings a passionate, desperate energy to Bard's role as a loving father, and easily extends that same protective care to all the people from Laketown. And we see a bit of Thranduil's raw pain and grief under his haughty smirk, when he wanders past the bloodied bodies of slain Elves.

""The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies"" is top-heavy on action and tragedy both, filling in the last gap in the saga of the hobbits and the One Ring. It has some missteps, but the passion and grief make it a powerful experience. And all the brilliant, epic action scenes don't hurt either.",1425427200,4,5065,4.911111111111111

5271752,5,B0095HHLMO,"As an avid Tolkien fan at first I was a lil miffed with this trilogy. They put in characters that never existed in the books and added certain things that just didn't fit. When this movie was released I was apprehensive about it. I was delightfully surprised with this movie though. Did they put in things that didn't actually happen in the books again? yes. But at least they were things that made sense to the story line such as the white counsel. The graphics in this movie are amazing. It kept us on our toes the whole movie long. It has everything you want in a movie. The moments of triumph, despair, sorrow and laughter. The story line flows nicely and the changes from the book to the movie in this installment are much more sensible. Bilbo is played very true to the books as well the dwarves. I even like that legolas and the girl elf ( Turiel - who was never in any books or even created by Tolkien) are in this movie they add to the story line in a way that I didn't think they would when they first were introduced into this trilogy. I have never had a problem streaming from amazon onto my devices and am sorry to hear others say they have. All in all I would HIGHLY recommend watching this movie, for 20 dollars (less than the price of movie tickets to see it once in theaters) you can buy this movie and watch it comfortably at home weeks before you can buy it in stores.

The fact is( and many fans are apparently unaware )that all of Jackson's ""expansion"" of The Hobbit is drawn from Tolkien's own work--from additional material that Tolkien wrote which turned up as appendices to later editions, as well as various backstories that can be found in The Silmarillion. In other words, Peter Jackson did not personally manufacture apocryphal material for the sake of padding out a film trilogy. In fact, following the publication of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien himself wanted to rewrite parts of The Hobbit to bring it more in accord with the trilogy, both in tone and subject matter, but he was basically forbidden to do so by his publisher. I feel strongly that this is something that needs to be made clear. Jackson's films can be legitimately critiqued in many areas, but this is not one of them.",1425340800,53,1077,4.923076923076923

5271762,4,B0095HHLMO,"First of all, let me just say, when I first heard that Guillermo Del Toro had left The Hobbit and that Peter Jackson was going to direct it himself, I couldn't hold my excitement. As of 2011, I started watching every video blog from the set, countless times, and reading every article containing every bit of information about the films. Lord of the Rings was a milestone in my adolescence and remains a vital part of my being to this day. ( as will continue to be for as long as I live)So, naturally, I was expecting The Hobbit films to be on par with Rings, I was expecting them to be cinematic masterpieces, however when I first saw An Unexpected Journey, I realized that was not the case, but still, as a true fan I absolutely loved it, I have a strong emotional connection with that first film in the trilogy, there are moments in it that makes me tear up ( like the second prologue with Ian Holm's Bilbo and Frodo, a scene between Galadriel and Gandalf when we hear a small segment of The Breaking of the Fellowship playing and a moment between Thorin and Bilbo at the end).

That being said, I was mildly disappointed with the second installment, The Desolation of Smaug, don't get me wrong, the movie was incredibly entertaining and had great spectacle, ( and good pacing) the barrels sequence, for one was brilliantly executed. But somehow I felt ( again, this is entirely subjective on my part) the film lacked the heart and character driven moments from the first film. ( not to mention the bad CGI and the absurd over the top finale at Erebor)So, after that film, I was worried that the third film would also be something of a let down, I could not be more wrong, The heart, emotion and character driven drama from the first film are not only present but they are heightened in The Battle of the Five Armies, while watching the film I felt that Jackson was channeling, well, himself, in the LOTR days, creating a huge battle with the focus on the characters personal dramas, in a way, I think he was aiming for this film to be this trilogy's Return of the King, with is both a bad and a good thing, it's bad because this trilogy doesn't have the same caliber as LOTR, and will always exist on its shadow, but at the same time is good, because it brought up the best that Jackson has to offer as director this time around, which makes BOTFA the best film of this trilogy ( once again, this is just my opinion).

The death of some of the main characters is done beautifully, in an extremely emotional way, each character has its moment in the film, but it's Bilbo and Thorin's relationship that is the emotional core of the film, both Freeman and especially Armitage do their best work in this third chapter. Thorin must be the most morally ambiguous character in Tolkiens lore ( even more than Boromir in LOTR) Which also makes him one of the most human (and interesting) characters Tolkien ever created. By this third film, its clear why Jackson chose Armitage for the role, I cannot imagine anyone else doing more justice to the part.  There are also some very emotionally charged character arcs, like Tauriel and Kili's, after watching the second film I never thought their romance was going to be treated in such a profound and beautiful way as it is in the third film, It was a very pleasant surprise and it gave Tauriel so much more depth. A similar thing happens with Bard in the film, we get to see a much more human side of him with his children. I also thought that the visual effects in this film were possibly the best of the trilogy,( I was shocked by the Oscars snub) I always disliked Jackson's decision to not use those beautiful miniature models like in LOTR, and instead creating some of the locations digitally, strangely I felt that the locations, especially Erebor and Dale, didn't look as artificial as in the first films, from some angles, Dale in this film reminded me a little of Minas Tirith. There is also a scene when Legolas and Tauriel arrive at Gundabad, an evil fortress, just in time to see a large army of orcs march from inside the fortress towards Erebor, accompanied by a huge flock of giant monstrous bats, that scene reminded me of when Frodo, Sam and Gollum arrive at Minas Morgul in ROTK, and witness the Witch king of Angmar leading an army towards Gondor. Speaking of the Witch King, being a die hard fan I could not help but have a major geek moment in the first hour of the film, when Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman face off against the Nine, the Ringwraiths, and Galadriel single handedly faces off against Sauron himself, I had goosebumps.

There is much to love in BOTFA, especially if you are a fan, the final framing device with old Bilbo in the Shire felt wonderfully nostalgic, it makes one want to watch Fellowship of the Ring right afterwards. I believe Jackson has achieved what he was aiming at, creating a trilogy that is a fitting prelude to LOTR and at the same time a compelling story on its own.",1425340800,5,4966,4.483977900552486

For me, the first movie introduced the characters and set them on a journey.

Visually pleasing.  But that's all.  Otherwise a terrible movie.  A movie in which important characters, concepts, and points zoom by with little or no development; in which the main character, the Hobbit himself, is barely on screen while plenty of screen time is given to characters and relationships that didn't even exist in the books but were fabricated by the juvenile Peter Jackson; in which filler scenes like those of poor homeless people walking around en masse or of sniveling two-faced second-in-commands doubling as comic relief are painfully added here and there in order to stretch a tiny amount of pages into an unjustifiably long movie (as was the case with the whole series).

5271776,1,B0095HHLMO,"First off, I am a Tolkien Fan, and these 3 films are a disgrace.  If you are a fan boy who is unwilling to see reason, and read the book for yourself, then don't bother reading my criticisms and praises.  You are blind and will not see reason nor understand.

Let me list the main problems with this trilogy, and what should have been either removed or changed.

Azog - this character is indeed in Tolkien lore, but he isn't in the book (as many of you have already heard.)  In the first movie he was used appropriately by having him present at the battle for Moria (at which Azog was killed by Dain.) If anything Azog should have been killed in that scene by Thorin, and then perhaps Bolg (who is the offspring of Azog) could have been the one chasing after Thorin (as Azog did in this trilogy.)

Tauriel - I liked this character, and I think the Hobbit needed a good, strong, entertaining female role, but sadly, this was diminished because of the love triangle and romance.  Good character, bad implementation of her role.

Legolas - I am fine with this character being in the film, but the amount of screen time he gets is INSANE.  And, the fact that he kills Bolg and not Beorn that kills Bolg, is a disgrace and it cheapened his death.  You could of had this same fight but with a different antagonist. You could have just invented an Orc commander or something for him to fight, Peter.  Stupid Decision.

The Wilhelm Scream - it may be silly that I am mentioning this, but with all seriousness; this scream takes me and many I know out of the experience and immersion.  It isn't amusing at all, and sound designers need to find a new ""sound"" to use in movies over and over again.

Smaug - This is simple.  The beginning of the Battle of the Five Armies (Smaug's Death) should have been at the end of the Desolation of Smaug.  It would have made that film much more conclusive and a film of its own.

And that's about it.

Peter, I trusted you with this, and I really wish now that you didn't direct the films at all, because you deviated so far from the book that it...it's just saddening.  Yes, some deviation is fine, like with Tauriel and Legolas (not all of him; his character should not of had so much screen time) and also other things, but the point is that you ruined these movies.  You did a fantastic job (mostly) with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but for some reason you chose to create new characters and overall basically give all the fans of the book a nice big middle finger.  It really is a shame, and anyone who read the book (before the films) would understand how big of a mistake you made.

It is because of what you did with these three films why the Tolkien Estate will not sell the rights for other Tolkien material.

I still get some enjoyment out of the films (the ending scene with Azog and Thorin in the Unexpected Journey was really epic, despite it not ever happening), but overall I have this big empty feeling inside.

You had a great Cast. Great Material to work with. Hundreds of millions of dollars (presumably) at your disposal  And, instead of staying truthful to the book with perhaps slight deviation...you decided to do it your own way, and well, you did an awful job of it.

No wonder the film is subtitled The Battle of the Five Armies, but the problem is I really don't care who they are or who will win. Dont get me wrong, because I enjoyed watching the grand-scale fight scenes, but to be honest I wasn't thrilled as much as I did when I first saw the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

The reason for my disenchantment is obvious. Yes, the film has spectacular battle scenes, but I think I have seen them somewhere before (and you know where). Another and more important reason is that we don't know whose story it is. Bilbo Baggins? Martin Freeman is as fine as before, amusing and charming, but he has little to do in the story. Gandalf? I don't think so. Bard the Bowman? Thorin?

After all, as the title suggests, The Battle of the Five Armies is all about battles that go on and on. The designs are gorgeous; the visuals are grand, and the ending is well done, but as to the characters there is no one to root for.",1423612800,6,1021,4.284974093264249
5271786,4,B0095HHLMO,"Now his cinematic adventure comes to an end in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. I thought that I would make the best of an embarrassing termination from seasonal job and join Jason at the theater in the next town for a deluxe HFR-3D screening with a premium sound system. That was my familys holiday present for him.

Writing about the story can be a bit of a challenge, since almost the entire movie is about titular Battle. Even there, though, there is enough high drama in and around the Battleon top of the raw spectacle, of courseto hold ones interest. I never really felt that the other two movies in this series were overly padded and I barely felt that effect here. The movie was serviceable in wrapping up the hobbits story. However, considering that this trilogy tried to bridge the gap between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the ending did feel rushed and there is a sense of a few loose ends, as if the director was ordered to simply be done with it.

Many of the things that I said about Desolation of Smaug last year would also apply to Battle of the Five Armies. The actors do well. Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Ian McKellen, and even Evangeline Lilly are the highlights here. The special effects look greatespecially with the higher frame rate, which still seems to make CGI look better-integrated with the live actors and sets. Some of the action gets sillysome of Legolass stunts seem out of place and more suited to a Super Sentai/Power Rangers series or the Marvel Cinematic Universebut it does get genuinely intense too.

If Wikipedia is accurate, JRR Tolkien considered rewriting The Hobbit when its follow-up ballooned into a complex, mature epic. If he did, it might have looked Actually, it might not have looked like Peter Jacksons movies as Christopher Tolkien reportedly actively dislikes all of them. Taken separately as a set of movies, the Hobbit trilogy is solid and complements the already-classic Lord of the Rings series.",1423526400,24,1978,4.744186046511628
5271787,1,B0095HHLMO,"This movie is the perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood.

Top with an abundance of special effects and hope nobody pays attention to the ""storyline"" and just ooohs and aaahs over the special effects.

It's almost inconceivable that the director of LOTR could produce such a bad movie.  I left the screening with the overwhelming impression that everyone involved in this bloated, over-wrought production simply gave up after ""The Desolation of Smaug"" and kicked it out the door with a cynical shrug that it'll still make a profit.  I left the theater feeling not only that this was a totally cynical shot at taking my money, but that it totally wasted my time in the process.

I have zero interest in watching this dud ever again.  Shame on Peter Jackson for this epic fail.",1423440000,18,972,4.890243902439025

Some people were disappointed with this movie because it had so much action. That is true, but this movie was really only meant to be 1 or 2 movies. So with this you have it spread out as far as you can go. If you think about it this way...lets say you take the first LOTR movie the fellowship of the ring and cut it up into 3 movies...You are going to get the same effect...interesting in the 1st part lots of dialogue and few action moments...the second will be okay....and in the third you will get nothing but the battle with the Urakai.

5271792,2,B0095HHLMO,"I do not really have much of a problem with certain liberties being taken of the book (i have read it twice, once in the 90s and once in 2014).  I can accept Legolas being present and even get over the elf/dwarf romance (even if it cheapens the human/elf love in LOTR).  But there are way too many things going on in this movie that were not necessary.  The following is a list of my problems (there are spoilers).

1) Unnecessary fantastic moments.  I won't even get into the parts with Legolas, he gets his own section below.  But there some really exaggerated things that ruined the movie for me.  Bard has kids in this movie, don't recall them coming up in the book but fine I guess we need him to be a family man to like him (really, we can't just like him cause he has had a hard life?)?  His bow breaks in the movie (not in the book) and he uses his son's shoulders to help him aim the arrow that kills Smaug.  UGGGGGH, it reminds me of Jurassic Park 2 when a kid kicked a velociraptor.  Hope the kids in the audience really appreciated that moment where they could imagine helping the hero stop the bad guy.

2) Legolas:  That is in the movies doesn't bother me.  That he plays a ""Superman"" like role does.  He is quite possibly the most dangerous person in this movie by far.  He can not lose.  There is a scene where he is on a bridge that's falling apart and he runs from falling stone to falling stone like he is Super Mario or something!  Yeah, I know he is an elf and they are light and nimble and all that . . . but this is too much.  There is also a scene where he is on a flying bat, rolls around on it during flight, fires arrows (and hits), etc.  It's really baffling because it makes one wonder . . . what happened to him by the time of LOTR cause sure he kicked butt in LOTR but not on this scale.  He is a shadow of his ""former"" self.

There is even a contrived part about him seeking Strider which makes me shudder . . . do they have the audacity to try and make movies of that?

2) Unnecessary fluff monsters.  There are so many monsters added in like huge bats & gigantic earth eating worms.  Sure, they could be fun but it's like . . . . ""where were these in LOTR?""  The dark armies just decided to not use them?  And the earth eating worms weren't even really used.  I'd assume they could get into the mountain, right?  But they didn't.  They weren't monsters, but the seemingly enchanted mountain goats that the dwarves ride up a mountain, it takes them seconds to scale it, were a bit much.  Picture Super Mario riding Yoshi from the Nintendo games and you kind of get the picture.

We also get at least one cave troll, or something, that had lost limbs in battles (i assume) and was walking around with a peg leg and a hook for a hand (or things along those lines).  Why?  It just seems goofy!  Is it there as comedy to make us laugh?

3) The use of the dwarves.  Jackson must have it written as law that in his Middle Earth movies the dwarves must serve as comedic characters.  He did it with Gimili in the LOTR and it was ok.  Here is a story where there should be much more effort in promoting how cool the dwarven culture is.  But anytime we start thinking a dwarf is impressive, they do something silly or an elf literally walks on top of them and makes them into a joke.

We have a dwarven army appear in force, looking really cool and tough only to learn the leader is played by Billy Connolly (apparently a well regarded actor that I only think of as ""the replacement teacher for Head of the Class in 1990.""  The guy is a comedian for pete's sake!  This should have been a character played by someone more warrior like, not a clown.

Then, the dwarven army starts fighting the orcs and what do the elves do?  The elves, without planning this ahead of time with anyone, run as a united army and step over the dwarves that have formed a phalanx and kick more butt than the dwarves do.  It's a wonder the dwarves didn't think the elves were attacking them!  They had been getting ready to fight after all.

4) Tauriel doesn't die.  What?  This seemed a given that her and Kili would die and her absence in LOTR seems more appropriate.  The only reason I can suspect she is kept alive is in case they do make the ""Legolas Chronicles.""",1422662400,11,4268,4.183046683046683

While it is true that most of this movie involves battle (it is called Battle of the Five Armies for a reason, you know), it kept me, at least, glued to my seat and despite having very little sleep the night before, not once did I doze. Too much going on. I can't wait to see it again to see what I missed the first go round but I will wait for the extended version. Wish I had waited on the extended versions of the first two.

One thing I have to mention is how the movie ended with, basically, the beginning of the first LOTR movie but from Bilbo's perspective - loved that, in fact. If I hadn't already watched the extended versions of all three LOTR, I would just go right to the next one and keep going to the end.

5271795,5,B0095HHLMO,"The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies has brought a satisfying conclusion to a very iconic franchise. With the enormous success of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, this prequel series was naturally raised in expectation. Sometimes it can be very difficult to live up to these high (and often impossible) expectations. Peter Jackson, however, has made it close; if not succeeded. Peter Jackson has had to create a lot from scratch, considering the film takes place on a section of the book where not many details are given. That being said, this third installment was both visually Compelling and engaging. The special effects by Weta Digital were Impressive, and not overloading. Although, be warned this film revolves around a battle of epic proportions, and thus has very intense action sequences. This is the major reason for the PG-13 rating and it shows very strongly at certain points. For the intended audience (teens-adults) this is not a big problem. There are also some scenes that some people may think of as strange, or maybe unnecessary. Despite this the Battle of the Five Armies finishes strongly and keeps the heart and soul of J.R.R. Tolkien's work in upmost importance. Fans will recognize an abundance of Items drawn from Tolkien's ""The Silmarillion"", and newcomers to the series will be just as satisfied. The latest film not only flows well with the previous installments, but even connects strongly to the original Lord of the Rings series which continues its story. The performances are quite believable and engaging. Even With the least important characters. Lee Pace brings more depth to Thranduil, While Ian Mckellen once again shines as Gandalf the Grey. The main characters also finish the trilogy with amazing skill. Martin Freeman (Bilbo) reminds us why we all fell in love with hobbits in the first place, and Richard Armitage portrays Thorin superbly as a living legend. All in all The Battle of the Five armies is a well done and well thought out film.",1422057600,41,1988,4.972972972972973

Fundamentally I just didn't make a personal and genuine connection with the movie. All in all a very fine movie but unfortunate that the last installment wasn't the best.

One inherent problem is in the book the focus is... the Hobbit. Granted in the book Bilbo gets knocked out early on in the battle and only becomes conscious at or near the end of the battle. Of course to create an epic movie centered on the Hobbit would be problematic.

Anyway, a huge hats off to Peter Jackson for his amazing work turning Tolkien's Hobbit and Lord of the Rings into incredibly wonderful and epic movies.",1422057600,5,704,4.535433070866142

5271798,2,B0095HHLMO,"Peter Jackson finishes with Middle Earth, again, six films and well over a thousand minutes of screen time after he began. It should go without saying that Bilbo's last fight is over-extended, indulgent and often very slow - at this point, those have become LOTR calling cards - but even amidst such expectations, this is a pretty big stretch. There's just so little real substance here, especially after the ferocious dragon Smaug is dismissed very early in the first act, that it feels like we're watching a medieval war reenactment and not a polished bit of Hollywood storytelling. The cast gets plenty of linguistic work, with lots of tongue-twisting names and locations to murmur in a foreboding tone, and the screen dances with all manner of wild paperback-cover visuals, but it deeply hurts that there's so little plot. Even the battle scenes, large and loud as they are, suffer from a bad case of the Rambos. That was a problem I could generally overlook in The Two Towers, even when Legolas was single-handedly taking down herds of war elephants, but now by comparison that seems almost quaint. It doesn't matter how outnumbered our heroes may be, if they're involved in a fight you'd better believe a couple hundred baddies are about to lose their heads. Believability is already a tall ask here, and those fight scenes scrap any shred of disbelief that may have remained somewhat suspended. It's a pantomime, a hopeless exaggeration that rambles on without point or purpose like a drunken Granddad after Thanksgiving dinner. There really, really didn't need to be three of these.",1421625600,23,1590,4.9588014981273405
5271799,2,B0095HHLMO,"I think Jackson fell under the Lucas spell here -  we get fantastic special effects that seem to serve no purpose but rather represent an end in themselves, substituting for lack of authenticity and creative integrity. I did not mind that Jackson partially rewrote Tolkien's story- The Hobbit after all is a minor work written for kids. Sometimes, rewriting works (as in, for example, Cloud Atlas).  However, Jackson manages to make a simple fairy tale into a giant emotional and narrative cliche that is psychologically draining, even humiliating to the spectator forced to watch this exercise in cynicism and opportunism. I was not moved by the ostensibly dangerous or sad situations and not elated by the feats of the heroes - as in the Star Wars prequel disasters, they seemed virtual, condescending and unreal.

Amongst the few good scenes were the initial ones with Smaug; the defeat of Sauron; the defeat of the orc chieftan. Other scenes were not credible (the resistance of humans in Dale). The battle - ostensibly the subject topic - was never resolved, and featured a deus-ex-machina entry of the ""Eagles"". The Tauriel saga was weak. Thorin's 'dilemma' excruciatingly cloying. Mostly, the film was chaotically scripted and produced, with a phenomenal waste of money and talent. The sense I got is that Jackson did not really care about the project.

5271801,3,B0095HHLMO,"Left watching the movie disappointed and feeling like to much was missing.  I'm not talking about missing vs the book, but just how the movie seemed to focus on all the little battles going on and the big battle was almost like a sidebar.  The Eagles coming was really disappointing, I think they had a whole 60 seconds it seemed.  The Orcs invading the old city of Dale would have made mincemeat of the ragtag remaining men there, it seemed they just kept a small group fighting a few orcs at a time.  And the elf army only seemed to be only partially involved.  The Dwarf army at least looked like an army and they were doing the most fighting. They focused a lot on Thorin and a few dwarves trying to get Azog, Some of that was pretty good but what happened to all the other Orcs he had with him?  So overall the LOTR battles seemed just so much better done than what they did in the Hobbit.  The battles in the Hobbit were less realistic and just felt more fake.  Now to be fair, I think they did as well as they could with Thorin having his own internal battle going on, his greed and wanting to be king and his paranoia.  Overall though the Hobbit movies were just somewhat disappointing to me.  Less entertaining, less gripping and suspenseful than the LOTR movies.",1421452800,12,1272,4.351694915254237

5271805,5,B0095HHLMO,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the final installment of The Hobbit trilogy. Bilbo and his company of Dwarves have just unleashed the Dragon Smaug upon a small lakeside village and chaos breaks loose. Once word is out that the dragon has been driven from the mountain, armies froActionm all over the land come to battle for the treasures that lie inside. It is a fight unlike any before and Bilbo must find a way to make peace before it is too late.

I really enjoyed this film. From the very beginning it is full of action, epic battles and suspense. The graphics in this entire series are stunning. The Hobbit never fails to impress me with its immaculate visuals and special effects. The soundtrack to this film is beautiful, as expected, since the rest of the series is filled with wonderful music. I think that this film is the perfect closure to the series that so many have fallen in love with and been loyal fans of over the years.

Im also very impressed with the fact that this trilogy of films is adapted from one, relatively short novel and every film is so packed full of action and adventure, there is never a dull moment.

The cast is marvelous as usual. Martin Freeman is the perfect actor to play Bilbo Baggins because he embodies his personality so well. Its been wonderful to watch Bilbos character develop over the course of these films. He starts off very timid and unsure of himself, but by the end of the final film he has so much new found confidence from all hes been through and is a completely different hobbit than he was at the beginning of the journey.

Im very sad that the series has come to an end and that the journey is over, but Im glad for the closure and amazed at how well this film turned out. Lord of the Rings fans will clearly love this film, but I think anyone who enjoys action, adventure and fantasy will love this film as well. There is a considerable amount of violence since the majority of the movie is an epic battle, so I suggest this film be viewed by ages 13 to 18-year-olds. If you have seen any of the previous films from The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings series, then this film should be suitable for you.

It seemed that Jackson treated nearly every scene in LOTR that Gimli was in with humor, which I found annoying at times (not that it wasn't funny), but I personally would have preferred a darker mood throughout, more in line with the books.

Beorn did not have a large enough role. Azog should have been dead since before the first movie (DAIN KILLED HIM IN THE BATTLE OF AZANULBIZAR in the lore). There was no battle on Ravenhill in the book. There were no ""earth eaters"" in the book, nor have I heard of them in any other Tolkien book.
Aside from that large list of cons, it did do well in other aspects. Everything leading up to the battle was almost spot on to the book. Thorin's descent into madness was very well orchestrated. The Battle of Dol Guldor was very entertaining. Dain Ironfoot was perfect (thank you Billy Connoly!). The deaths of the three (if you get what I mean) were very emotional. Bilbo's character also developed very well throughout the movie. I also appreciated how Bard killed Smaug.

5271812,4,B0095HHLMO,"The decision by Peter Jackson to expand JRR Tolkien's slim, trim novel The Hobbit into three movies was met with derision, and for very good reason. They all but guaranteed an extensive amount of filler and more of this new fellowship walking through grassy plains than ever. The first film was a crashing bore, the second film a marked improvement, and now with The Battle of the Five Armies we are treated to the final chapter of the trilogy and the first to meet the high quality standards of The Lord of the Rings. While the series as a whole doesn't quite measure up, Jackson deserves credit for wrapping up this massive fantasy epic on an incredibly high note.

Easily the best of the trilogy, Battle of the Five Armies is exactly what it promises to be: one mammoth war fought between every faction in Middle Earth. Picking up right where the last film left off with Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) setting Laketown ablaze, the heroic Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) races to find a way to ground the armored dragon.  If there was too much drag on the first two movies, 'Armies' is all gorgeously detailed action. Would it have been cool to see what another director could do with this world visually? Absolutely, but there's a comfort in the beautiful familiarity he brings to Middle Earth, and his ability to choreograph multiple battle sequences at a time is stunning.

While Laketown burns, what seems like a dozen other plots are playing out at elsewhere. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) has discovered the dooming arrival of a darker evil threatening the land; while Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), and the company of dwarves are holed up in the Lonely Mountain reclaiming their lost treasure. True character arcs are few but Oakenshield gets the best one as he's torn between greed and leading his people. Bilbo's arc was completed mostly in the second film as he became more than just burglar, but he's important here as Oakenshield's conscience. With so many characters wrapped in prosthetics and make-up it's easy to take the acting for granted, but Armitage and Freeman are both excellent. Meanwhile, the other dwarves remain mostly interchangeable and indistinguishable, with the exception of Kili (Aidan Turner) who is memorable only for his romance with the elf, Turiel (Evangeline Lilly). Even that is handled with efficiency and a little bit of sweetness which shines through in the midst of the raging war surrounding it.

And let's talk about that war because it encompasses almost 60% of the movie, if not more. Jackson has never spared any expense in crafting his special effects budget but he really outdid himself this time.  Again pushing the limits of CGI technology, every disgusting orc, mountain range, and glittery elf looks exquisite. Tolkien himself would be in awe of what Jackson has been able to accomplish. With so many characters and plot threads weaving in and out of the fighting, there's also the need to connect with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. While that connection is definitely forced on occasion, we don't see a bunch of characters from the other films shoe-horned in where they don't belong, a problem faced by predecessors. Running at only 2 hours and about 20 minutes, this is the shortest and briskly-packed film of the bunch. There's simply not a lot of standing around this time, and even if the final battle stretches on a bit too long it never gets boring.  The humor doesn't always work, like with the aggravatingly duplicitous ""Alfrid"" character, but it's a welcome presence in what is basically a fantastical war movie.  That we care so much about these characters and their connections to one another speaks to the richness of Tolkien's vision but also Jackson's ability to fully realize it.

Now that it's all said and done, The Hobbit will certainly go down as inferior to The Lord of the Rings by comparison, but so what? They should be taken as a complete whole, one that reaches incredible heights of imagination and technical precision. Jackson will probably never do anything as big as this again (although we've said that before!), but he's left a mark with these films that can never be erased.",1420675200,6,4202,4.8835904628331
5271813,4,B0095HHLMO,"I have read both the Hobbit and LOTR. I enjoyed the Hobbit better as as story so I was excited to see this movie being made, especially since LOTR was very well done. I did like the two previous Hobbit movies a little more than the final one but I still enjoyed The Battle of  the Five Armies. My main problem with it is that it wasn't long enough or padded enough. Which is the opposite of most opinions. Reading the appendices from the LOTR was tedious for me so I was thrilled when they started to pull in other Tolkien works to tie the trilogies together. Where I think they screwed up was they didn't go that route from the beginning. I also think that Peter Jackson gave in to pressure about the movies being long and having too much other storyline so he scaled this one down. I am really hoping that the extended edition puts back in all the little details that I have come to adore from the other films.

I think the main thing it to realize this movie is not going to be exactly like the book. I mean, what movie based on a book is? The people making the movie are going to put in their own creative spin on it. How boring would it be to just remake a story exactly as it was! I can't imagine anyone really wanting to do that. It is either a good interpretation of the book or it isn't. I felt that overall the Hobbit movies were enjoyable. I felt invested in the story and the characters. To me they were really brought to life. As well as Middle Earth. I feel like it is a real  place I can visit someday. Because it is! I think it was really clever to use so much of New Zealand to make the movie. I would love to see Hobbiton.

A few of the things I wish had been done differently are:

1) I felt that Alfrid ended up being a little over played in this movie. I preferred his underhanded nastiness in the previous film to the overt character he ended up with in the third one. He was perfectly awful before and that didn't seem to carry through, well, he just kind of lost it after the dragon attack. But who wouldn't I guess.

2) Thranduil's character seemed over played as well to me. Again, what I saw of him in the previous film was so good that in this round I thought the ""bad dad"" angle ended up being too much.

3) Tauriel. I liked that they added a female character in the films. I even liked the romance between her and Kili...IF it had been done a little less intensely. I would have gone along with it much better if they had been just beginning to fall for each other but ended up both tragically dieing in battle together. Their bodies could have fallen close by with their hands almost touching so I never know if they really did or really didn't. Leaving her alive and pining in the end just added drama that the movie probably didn't need and even felt a little silly.

4) The wrap-up. It was so abrupt! I wanted to see what happened after the battle and I really thought this part was rushed or something. It just wasn't as satisfying. Please be there in the extended edition! I want more!!",1420588800,5,3022,4.180412371134021
5271814,3,B0095HHLMO,"I can defend this franchise no more, as the steady drop in quality through this trilogy hits rock-bottom with this final installment. All the critics of the series are gifted ample fodder in this bloated mess, as Bilbo barely surfaces in the narrative while the movie wastes ample screentime with unnecessary and uninteresting subplots.

I thought the first Hobbit film successfully captured the heart of the plucky underdog story. But now the titular hero is pushed off the stage as apparently incomplete appendixes from ""The Silmarillion"" are now unceremoniously shoehorned into the story. Even the main characters beyond Bilbo are not treated properly, as the pacing and timing of the entire film is off. So any thematic threads and character growth from the first two films are squandered for the sake of stuffing a third film with content. Seriously, the ""unscrupulous bureaucrat"" gets maybe twice as much play in his scheming and irrelevant misadventures as Bilbo does.

If there's any one thing the film excels at is its epic battles. With confrontations featuring dragons, dwarves and elves excelling in near-super-powered combat, at least the movie stages several superb showdowns. Regretfully, the hobbit isn't in any of them.

This film is hardly bad or unwatchable, but it is grossly inferior to all the others in this series. While the first ""Lord of the Rings"" ended with a bang, ""The Hobbit"" dies with a whimper.",1420502400,7,1427,5.115879828326181

The vision and some of the characters are awesome, but he stoops to predictable plots and action devices. You would think having a book that indicates what will happen would be enough, but he super sized that seemingly without reason or benefit into stupidity.

5271817,5,B0095HHLMO,"'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' is a great and fitting end to director Peter Jackson's prequel trilogy. Though it isn't a perfect film, it is my favorite of the three because it is the most exciting, thrilling, and emotional. The cast did a great job at performing their roles: strong performances from Martin Freeman (the hobbit Bilbo) and Richard Armitage (dwarf leader Thorin Oakenshield). Ian Mckellen offers as fine a role as ever as Gandalf the wizard and Luke Evans' performance as Bard the Bowman also stands out in this film. The musical (score) by composer Howard Shore further enhances this film and outdoes the previous two film scores. Though the stretched plot of 'Battle of the Five Armies' isn't completely faithful to the source material of author J.R.R. Tolkien's 1937 novel, it does work well for a thrilling end to a fantasy/adventure trilogy. This film picks up right where the last movie, 'Desolation of Smaug', ended and doesn't let up. It has that go, go, go plot and is very intense from the start of the movie to the ending of the great battle that takes place. While I would've liked to see less of it, the cgi in this film is very well done and, like the other two 'Hobbit' movies, it plays a huge role. Another triumph by Weta Digital at bringing Tolkien's world to life by using well done special fx. That being said, one thing I really enjoyed about 'The Lord of the Rings' movie trilogy was how the orcs were played out by actors in full makeup, costume design, and real body armour. That is hard to be found in the three 'Hobbit' films. It is what makes the 'Rings' trilogy feel more organic and believable than 'The Hobbit' trilogy (along with the bigatures, which was doubtfully used in this tilogy as well). In 'The Hobbit' films, the orcs are 70 to 100 percent cgi. It works well, but feels less real because you know its cgi when you see it. I agree 'Lord of the Rings' had its fair share of cgi moments. But it seemed only to have been used by the filmmakers when necessary and was still totally belieavable. All griping aside, in my opinion 'The Battle of the Five Armies' is a fitting close to Jackson's prequel trilogy. It offers the most action of the three films and is the shortest out of all six of Peter Jackson's Middle-earth based movies. There is also a lot of great scenery of Middle-earth/New Zealand as we saw in all the previous released five films. Though it is fair to say that 'The Hobbit' trilogy is not as good as the epic 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy (and how could it be when the actual story of 'The Hobbit' is more light hearted and a bit less epic), it still offers a lot of excitement and is a fun thrill ride through Tolkien's Middle-earth in Jackson's point of view. For a fantasy/adventure film, 'Battle of the Five Armies' is really impressive and will not dissapoint if you enjoy a lot of intense sword fighting, stellar acting, and gorgeous scenery. Though Tolkien purists will most likely be disappointed with this film (as they were with the other two being that the source material was stretched from a 320 page book into a trilogy) fans of the series will really enjoy what this movie has to offer. And as a fan of Tolkien's world (who is pleased with 'The Hobbit' trilogy overrall, but would not consider any of the three films perfect or being nearly as good as any of 'The Lord of the Rings' movies), I will say that 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' is a satisfying conclusion, or beginning if you like. The film ties in so well with 'Rings', especially at the end which is practically the beginning of 'Fellowship of the Ring', that it's hard not to give the movie applause. In fact, that's probably the best thing about 'Battle of the Five Armies'. It is a geat film! More darker in tone than the previous two movies. I look forward for the extended edition of 'Battle': rumoured to have 30 minutes of extra footage. More of Dain Ironfoot, and especially Beorn, must be shown!",1420329600,2,3978,4.526388888888889
5271818,2,B0095HHLMO,"The message the actors conveyed was great, specially on Thorin's reawakening from his madness and what he tells Bilbo upon his death. The sparse personal character development is the only thing that makes this worth it. Perhaps it should have been released as a mini series instead.

 On the other hand the fighting sequences were lackluster when compared to previous movies. The part when the Orcs take the city seems straight out of a B movie with people running around randomly and bad shots.
They missed a great opportunity with Beorn and the Eagles to be creative and avoid repeating themselves, which I was looking forward since I read the book over 12 times as a child. This was THE OPPORTUNITY to have at least as much battle sequences as one on one fights but I'm sure some director or producer decided they couldn't induce enough drama in the actual battle sequences which was just a sign of fatigue. Probably they know something I don't.
After all this movie didn't stimulate my imagination, it didn't even come close. It seemed to have been made with leftover from the rest of the movies blended together with a nice message as a topping.

5271822,2,B0095HHLMO,"After five three-hour films, thirteen years, hundreds of millions of dollars spent and earned, seventeen Academy Awards, and thousands of miles traversed on-screen, director Peter Jackson's iconic, J. R. R. Tolkien-derived Middle-earth saga comes to a decidedly uneven end with The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, the third and final prequel to The Lord of the Rings.  There is no way around the truth, cold and hard as it is:  this is the worst of the six films.  In fact, as a fan (though not a particularly ardent one), it is the only entry in the series I do not rate as a satisfying picture.  So much goes wrong.  One flaw is predictable:  to the give the second film, The Desolation of Smaug, a grim, dramatic, and abrupt to-be-continued ending, the start of this film was sacrificed a year ago.  So, it begins.  Infuriated dragon Smaug is laying waste to a town of men.  We as an audience are disconnected, disoriented.  The dragon dies and becomes an almost instant afterthought.  The desolation of Smaug is over.  Shrug.  Also becoming an afterthought here, sadly, is title character Bilbo Baggins, Shire-born master burglar.  The wonderful Martin Freeman is still a charismatic, grounded, slightly mischievous, and ultimately noble presence in the role, but he is often crowded to the edge of the frame and the story.  The Hobbit now has to remind itself to include the hobbit.

In his stead are vast, brutal, ambitious, and interminable sequences of combat:  elf versus dwarf, dwarf versus goblin, man versus orc, and so on and so forth times infinity.  It becomes an exhausting spectacle, and moments of genuine excitement and ferocity are too infrequent.  The limited scope is also dispiriting.  The armies fight outside the Lonely Mountain.  They fight in the town a mile from the Lonely Mountain.  They fight on a glacier a mile from the town near the Lonely Mountain.  There is the dampening sense here of a film racing and screaming and starting fires, but never moving anywhere particularly fast despite the outward pomp and instances of indulgent fan service, including absurd, please-cheer displays of aerobatic daring by Orlando Bloom's returning Legolas, no longer as sexy and dynamic as he used to be.  The film is also curiously disinterested in resolving certain subplots (despite a scenery-devouring cameo by Cate Blanchett, the confirmation of Sauron's impending return to power plays more as a rushed obligation than a foreboding revelation) or saying a proper farewell to a catalog of characters unique to the prequels, such as barely-glimpsed shape-shifter Beorn.",1420156800,30,2600,5.049295774647887

Many major characters were given extremely short screen-time (literally seconds in some cases) while other characters had far too much screen time (Alfrid!).  The bats were introduced as a major threat, but were barely shown in the battle.  I still enjoyed the movie, but when compared to everything that had come before it, I left a bit disappointed.

5271827,3,B0095HHLMO,"***Contains spoilers, so read at your own discretion***

My wife and I watched this last night in IMAX 3D.  First the positivies...The cinematography was top-notch, just like the rest of the LotR movies.  The action was fun, and in your face.  The 3D was very well done, and had me ducking in my seat a few times when characters buzzed by the screen.  Now for the negatives...The story was just ok...I feel like it was a major step-down from the first and second Hobbit movies.  The film focused on Thorin's descent into madness, and the armies that form in order to lay claim on the gold in the Lonely Mountain.  There is a MASSIVE battle that takes place near the end of the movie between all 5 armies, but I felt it hard to really care which side won, other than wanting the main characters (basically the main dwarves, elves, Gandalf and Bilbo) to live.  Another gripe of mine is that Smaug was killed about 15 minutes into the movie, and I think he was the best villain in the whole Hobbit series.  Also, Gollum wasn't even in the movie, and he was the best part of the first Hobbit film.

Despite all the negatives, I'm still glad I saw the film.  It's nice to have closure for the trilogy, and the director did a nice job in the final scene tying it to the LotR trilogy.  But in my opinion The Hobbit trilogy is not even close to the level of the original LotR trilogy.  It is, however, a nice supplement to the saga of Middle Earth.",1419984000,2,1440,4.3283582089552235
5271828,5,B0095HHLMO,"I was not thrilled by the first Hobbit movie.  It was way too Jackson and not enough Tolkien.  The second movie was much better with less Jackson and more Tolkien (for those who have read the book many times, you know what I am talking about). So, here comes the last movie which is like 80% Jackson and 20% Tolkien by necessity (after Smaug attacked the town, there were only a few chapters of book left).  Anyway, I was shocked by how good this last movie was.  Jackson made a very wise decision by adding time and making the battle of five armies so much more than what it was in the book.  I really enjoyed this last installment and have to give a lot of credit to Jackson in having given us a most excellent tour through the Tolkien universe.",1419897600,4,747,4.2695035460992905

5271830,3,B0095HHLMO,"I loved the LOTR movies, and have watched them multiple times.  When the Hobbit films were announced, I wondered how Jackson would spread a 300 page book over three movies,

Here's the answer - he made stuff up.  The first movie, An Unexpected Journey, was actually quite good, and reasonably faithful to the book.  The Desolation of Smaug strayed from the book in significant ways, but was still recognizable.  Not for for The Battle of the Five Armies.  About 20 minutes of this is actually based on the book.  The rest of it comes from Jackson's imagination.

It's an enjoyable film - Freeman's performance alone is worth three stars, as is Armitage's (at least when he's talking, rather than that ridiculously drawn out fight scene), but don't expect the same quality as LOTR, or even the first two Hobbit movies.",1419811200,12,817,4.785714285714286
5271831,3,B0095HHLMO,"As a huge Tolkien fan and lover of the original trilogy, I walked away from this film having been entertained but disappointed. As a general rule of thumb, I don't complain about deviations from source material, but I can't help but complain about some of the directions Peter Jackson took in this film.

For one, the epic and terrific buildup to Smaug in the 2nd film is abruptly and clumsily brought to a close before the opening title even appears, which really highlights how splitting and extending this story into a trilogy has been a detriment to the narrative flow and focus. It feels anti-climactic to say the least. The first 20 minutes or so in this film are the worst 20 minutes in Jackson's entire 6-film saga. Stilted dialogue, awkward exposition, choppy editing and several poor choices with the story.

The emphasis on the unibrowed comic relief sidekick character, who single-handedly derails the tone and pacing of huge chunks of the film, is mind-boggling. Here you have a movie overrun with underdeveloped characters, and instead of focusing on some emotional payoff with your already bloated cast, you decide to invent a juvenile slapstick sidekick and force them into every other scene. There is a particularly embarrassing sequence where he is dressed in drag and pretends to be a woman so he doesn't have to fight in the battle. Scenes like this should have never, ever made it past the 1st or 2nd draft. This would be at least a little salvageable if the character reached some sort of redemption or had some semblance of a character arc, but alas, he's just a stupid Jar Jar Binks-esque failed comedic distraction.

Once you slog through the bumbling first half, the action sequences themselves are just as slick and riveting as anything Jackson has produced. The difference here is that the dramatic weight that elevates his work above your typical shallow Hollywood spectacle is sorely missing. Jackson tries so hard to stuff these films full of side quests and B and C stories that none of them are given enough time to develop and deliver the dramatic payoff they've been building towards. Every character gets one short, rushed last scene, yet the action scenes drag on for twice as long as they should have. What you essentially end up with is the final arc of a story sectioned off into its own film, with a little story stuffed into the beginning and end to feel more complete. It doesn't work.

There is certainly an appeal to just having more minutes of Middle Earth on the screen, as Jackson has been wildly successful at bringing Tolkien's world to life, but some serious editing to turn this into two if not one well-paced, focused film would have really improved The Hobbit. As it is, this last film in Jackson's 2nd trilogy is a visually impressive but sloppy, unfocused, mostly empty spectacle.",1419811200,15,2836,4.8172484599589325
5271832,4,B0095HHLMO,"We've finally come to the end we've all been waiting for, the one section of The Hobbit novel that really did merit a movie, ""The Battle of Five Armies."" It's all come down to this: Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) seeks revenge for the theft of his treasure by attacking the townsfolk of Laketown. Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), incumbent king of the dwarves,  succumbs to dragon sickness. And Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) uses the Arkenstone, the crowning jewel of the dwarves, as a bargaining chip between the elves, dwarves, and men.  A dark army is coming to take the dwarven stronghold, and if the free peoples are to survive they will need to put aside their petty grievances and work together. If there was ever a time and place for a spectacle on the big screen, ""The Battle of Five Armies"" is it.

Smaug, who was the best part of the second film (SPOILER ALERT) meets his end in this one.  It feels a bit anticlimactic.  Smaug could have just as easily succumbed at the end of the second film, leaving it a more satisfying chapter.  But the showdown between Bard (Luke Evans) and Smaug is thrilling nonetheless as Peter Jackson contrasts family values against that of the rapacious greed.

In stark relief is the real and petty grievances that move the various factions to war. Be it Tauriel's (Evangeline Lilly, an elf in real life) love for Kili (Aidan Turner), Legolas Greenleaf's (Orlando Bloom) rebellion against his king Thranduil (Lee Pace), or Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) attempts to convince mortals of the true threat of Sauron, the familiar characters in this prequel to the ""Lord of the Rings"" films all make an appearance.  We witness the terrifying might of Galadriel glimpsed in the later film, Elrond wield a sword, and even Saruman kicks some Nazgul butt. It's a joy to watch these powerful beings who stood around giving advice in the later movies really cut loose in this one.

There are also visual flourishes that tie all the films together.  The more humanoid trolls from the first film stand beside the larger trolls of the ""Lord of the Rings."" Goblins and orcs work together. Legolas, Tauriel, and even Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) show up to do battle.  We even get an explanation for what a were-worm is. Purists may be disappointed by how much Jackson veers from the original story, but the choices made to bolster the narrative are easy to forgive.

There are two scenes where the film drags, both of them involving a character's mental state.  There's also the awful Alfrid (Ryan Gage), who is a lot like Grima Wormtongue but with no character development and played for laughs.  He's not funny, but it's clear Jackson felt that the tone of the film was so grim it had to be lightened by a cowardly buffoon.

The one character who has little to do in this third chapter is the titular Hobbit himself, Bilbo.  J.R.R. Tolkien's narrative didn't thrust hobbits into war until The Lord of the Rings, so Bilbo sits most of the battle out.  His actions have far-reaching effects on the war itself, but mostly Bilbo's there to show how incorruptible hobbits really are. Unlike his dwarven compatriots, Bilbo finds no lure in dragon gold.

""The Battle of Five Armies"" isn't perfect, but it's a fitting finale to a six-part franchise.  The real test will be in years to come when future Middle Earth fans view the films collectively.  Will we watch them in chronological order? I look forward to finding out.",1419811200,8,3439,4.777027027027027
5271833,4,B0095HHLMO,"The Battle of the Five Armies brings the Hobbit film trilogy to a solid conclusion. I do wonder why the first ten minutes of this movie weren't the last ten of the last movie, but that's not something I can fault this film for.

The film has some great characters to cheer for particularly Bilbo and Bard.  Martin Freeman is splendid as Bilbo even though his screen time is limited. He manages to convey the ultimate goodness and loyalty of a friend who has to put his friends first, even if angers them.

Thorin being seduced by greed was very well portrayed. with a couple nice of effects including the chilling scene where Thorin speaks in a Smaug-like voice as well as having a nice visual effect. The story's moral core remains well-preserved.

One nice feature of this is how well this film dovetails into the Lord of the Ring Trilogy. It's not just the end of the movie is the beginning of Fellowship of the Ring, but there are a large number of characters who appear in the film who are later in Lord of the Rings and there's nice bits of foreshadowing thrown in. Unlike with Star Wars, where the prequels are mostly disposable, Jackson has managed to complete a seamless series of stories and what will probably make the most sense for viewers wanting to access this series is to watch all 6. They can still be watched Independently but this film had me wanting to rewatch the originals.

On the downside, as with most action movies, the battle scenes crossed the line from epic and amazing to over-indulgent.

 While I think they did a great job establishing Tauriel as a female warrior Elf in the second movie as the Elven women in the movies apparently fight, in this film they crossed the line into pure PC silliness as they have the women of the fishing village deciding to take up arms after being ordered by the Bard to shelter with the children. This was even though they weren't practiced in warfare and also aren't shown making any weapons. They also really aren't shown actually fighting in battle. It's as if Peter Jackson or someone at the studios decided a political message needed to be sent never mind if it actually made any sense.

And there are other minor nitpicks I could make with the movie, some going back to the book, others just to directorial decisions, but overall, this was a good movie.

  What an absolute disgusting piece of work! What would possess Jackson to create this mess. He had a perfectly good script to follow - The BOOK - all he had to do is put the words from the book into images. BUT what did he do ??? He gave us hours of childish, simple minded action scenes - WHAT HAPPENED TO THE STORY?! Where is the story in this movie?
 The other reviewers giving this movie a one star did not exaggerate and are quite accurate in their appraisal.

Yes, I got carried away - clearly negatively affected by this nonsense.

  Jackson why did you do this? You claimed to be a Tolkien loyalist! Is it an insecurity that you refuse to use that wonderful book but instead wrote your own version - frankly - numerous times I turned to my wife and said - it appears Jackson is 'under the influence'.

  By the way Jackson - your interpretational skills need to be improved. Even in the Lord of the Rings - when the 'Fellowship' was in the cave - Frodo tells how He saw some parts of HIS DREAM come to life (some parts) - meaning the back of the cave having a door (NOT a trap door) - seeing them continuously fall through the depths was just so absurd, ridiculous and embarrassing - You really messed that up creating Frodos dream instead of what the book describes actually happened.

5271836,1,B0095HHLMO,"If you watched the first two Hobbit films directed by Jackson, then you know the story arc is on a steep, downward spiral. For example, the previous film was so bad I was actually rooting for the dragon Smaug! I despised the film that much!

But let's talk economics. If you pay to see junk then you, yes you, are encouraging Hollywood to make more junk. It's Economics 101. If you don't spend money on bad films then Hollywood will do a better job. It's that simple. Since the movie-going audience pays the bills, when the movie-going audience stops paying the bills, Hollywood will have a financial incentive to stop making junk!

The movie has little to do with the book except the names are all the same. If you changed every name you would not realize your watching The Hobbit. The film is war porn, plain and simple!

The original Lord Of The Rings film trilogy were masterpieces. But can you imagine what the films would have been like if each book in the trilogy was split up into three films each - for a total of 9 films? Well, that's exactly what Director Jackson did. He took one skinny book and instead of turning it into one or possibly two films, he essentially made-up a different story - from the book - and made three films.

Now if he could have done a better job than Tolkien himself, then Great! But he's not a fantasy writing genius, he's a moneygrubbing moron who wants to maximize profits by using his formerly good name to lure fans of Tolkien to watch his crap. In other words, Jackson does not care one bit that he ruining one of the greatest pieces of literature in the English language. He's making himself and his buddies rich because of you and me!

Every time you spend a dime on something you are voting for that product or service, just like when you vote for a politician at the polls. If you want quality then don't pay for junk! It's that simple!",1419724800,38,1883,4.414985590778098
5271837,5,B0095HHLMO,"Warning: May contain plot spoilers for people unfamiliar with the story.

The version I watched was only 2 hours and 10 minutes, a reprieve from the 3 hour marathons of bladder hell and missed scenes. The film picks up right where the other one leaves off, although it would have been nice to have included the last couple of minutes of the second one. After the defeat of the dragon, the film goes into about 40 minutes of badly scripted drama, which included lines used in previous films, making it a bit trite. I was looking forward to the battle which unfortunately consumed most of the remainder of the film. I reached a point I was wishing the battle scene to end, although the title of the film hints at what to expect.

The use of characters not in the book creates some plot continuity issues as well as creating those that weren't. Peter Jackson creates personal drama in the film which was not in the books. His fight scenes which consume much of the film series are typically one line or paragraph in a four volume series. Clearly some aspects of the books have to go like a chapter dedicated to the care and feeding of Shadowfax. Personally in the middle of battle, I don't think that ring would have left my finger.

As far as purchasing, I am a true fan and will patiently wait for all the series to be out on a special edition extended Blu-ray at an outrageous price I won't think about twice.

5271838,4,B0095HHLMO,"PROS:
* Powerful emotions
* Good cinematography
* Properly connects Smaug with Two Towers
* DRAGON SICKNESS!

CONS:
* Long runtime
* CG is noticeable in the elvish army
* When you start with 200 people, how is it possible for there to be hundreds killed, and still have hundreds left?

Either you know the story, or will watch the story.  Either way, there is no reason to recount what happens.

The production quality is excellent.  The only tapering of quality is with the Elves, lined up for battle, they all have the same CG face in a couple of scenes.  Also, Laketown is small enough that everyone knows each-other.  After multiple attacks from multiple foes, there are still many people, unharmed?  Also, battling for a days, with no food, and people are still standing?  Hrmmm

Aside from that, people behave as expected.  A wonderful story is connected on both ends.  It's definitely better if you can watch the first two Hobbit movies prior to this, but it's not necessary.  It stands alone, connects the prior two, and it connects into the Two Towers.  Very well done.

5271839,1,B0095HHLMO,"Just when I thought the last film hit rock bottom catering to America's shallow taste and low IQ in movie making, this latest XBox 360 movie romp just serves up the biggest slice of movie making garbage in the history of modern film.  Seen the new TMNT movie by Michael Bay?  This thing is the same kind of trash.

*Note* I have read The Hobbit before any of the films.  It is pretty vivid in my memory for being a good book, has great dialogue, builds some nice subtle tension, and is overall a great whimsical romp through a fantasy world.  I wouldn't consider myself a LoTR geekoid though.

Let's break this stinker down.  This is the kind of film that caters to the typical average IQ American who has bought into Hollywood's last 12 year trend of putting nausea inducing video game sequences on a screen.  Character development?  Why bother.  Clever dialogue? Too hard, you'll lose the audience.  They'll have to think a little. I'm sorry if you are offended by this, but it is true.  Movies are little more than CGI thrill rides.

I. Pay $10 to watch video games
I swear that Peter Jackson has caught George Lucas syndrome.  What do I mean by this do you ask?  I eluded to this on my review of the last film ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" where a majority of the film is seriously a CGI video game.  A little bit of plot, followed by hundreds of acts of CGI violence, rinse and repeat.  This movie?  It is even less dialogue and more acts of CGI violence.  It goes on and on and on and on and on.  It is nauseating, it is wearying, it is shallow.  The entirety of this film is a video game.  And I'm reading that people think this was a great movie?  Are you kidding me?  So every time I play a Playstation 4 game, I'm also watching a film masterpiece.  The dialogue in video games is about as clever as Peter Jackson's poorly written drivel and the action in a PS4 game is pretty much the same.

II.  Let's not forget the dialogue again.
Has anyone ever read JRR Tolkien's dialogue?  It is art with the English language.  I would love to see the script from this film.  I don't need to hound on this much more, but when the characters speak, it is laughable.  Speaking scenes involve 3 things to Peter Jackson:  1) Brooding dark orc talk.  2) A brooding dark reveal with a pause.  3) Elves being stoic.
Brooding dark orc talk:  Just listen to Bolg and Azog the whole film.  Every line given to them will involve ""do you crave blood?"" ""after them, bring me the *insert character*"" ""leave none alive.""  Make sure they have dark scary voices.  Jackson is a true Shakespearian with the English language......for 5 year olds.
Brooding dark reveal with a pause:  Oh god, Jackson loves this trick.  It happens quite a few times in the trilogy.
Thorin: Everyone fall back to the keep, everyone fall back its coming!
Dwarf:  What? *pause*
Thorin: Dragon. (in deep scary voice)
Legolas pulls this one off really well in the new movie too.  When he says at Gungabad: ""The bats are bred for one thing"" *pause* ""for war"" (in scary brooding voice)  Anything to do with Sauron's return also uses this stupid dialogue tactic of the dark scary pause reveal.  Good movies have good dialogue.  Don't forget Smaug's stupid monologue before Bard killed him.  Speaking of dialogue...

III.  Warning!
The film during the battle is just a bunch of people running around warning each other of something.  Did anyone else notice this?  The film is such a mess no one knows what is going on.

IV.  Storytelling 101
Peter Jackson doesn't seem to understand how to tell a story.  He makes stuff up as he goes along, forgets about things he inserts and never covers again, and then characters make stupid decisions after it is all said and done.  I will give you a great example.  When the Elf King comes to the aid of the humans, he says he wants a claim made from the mountain.  Some necklace or something, then flash to Thorin with another deep brooding piece of dialogue with the necklace ""An elf king will pay a pretty price for this.""  Ok, that's fine.  But then the necklace is never talked about again.  After, the elf king tries to leave the battle.  Really?  Now?  All your elf armies are dead and now you decide the necklace isn't worth it?  Like I said, this movie was written by a 5 year old.  I give high school composition students more credit than this.  Now I could go on with the side love story or the Galadrial facing Sauron nonsense (just another scene for more violence and video game action for Saruman and Elrond) but I won't because.  Legolas in this movie is also just nonsense.  Again, more chances for video game stuff.

V. Isn't this The Hobbit?
Bilbo has a little more of a role here, but still.  The film should have been focused on one thing, Bilbo Baggins.  It is what made the book so nice.  Even the relationship between Thorin and Bilbo could have been the great focus, I wouldn't have minded that.  This film is such a mess that the only way Jackson tries to save it is with most of the movie being video game violence.  He did this because he knew what his target audience was.  He can distract all the sheep with computer animation so you forget about the nonsense that is this script and movie.  Anyone with half a brain wasn't fooled by ""oh look at the shiny stuff on screen.""

VI.  The ending.
So you have endured 2 straight hours of blood, carnage, stupid dialogue, deus ex machina, constant physics defying video game action, and now the ending is here.  Back to Storytelling 101, Jackson spent all this time about how important it is to reclaim the mountain and the guy didn't even bother to tell you who took over as king (hint: it was the drunk CGI Scottish dwarf on a video game pig).  The ending in the book was happy and pleasurable.  In this film, Bilbo broods, Gandalf broods, and it bridges into LoTR.

What a shame.  What an absolute shame these three movies were.  Did the war really have to be 2 hours?  It would have been equally as powerful if it were 20 minutes because the rest of the film could have made us care about the characters.  Instead we get three films that ended up being 80% video game violence, 15% stupid brooding dialogue, 4% ""oh look, this is going to be in LoTR"", and 1% is dedicated to Bilbo Baggins, the character we actually cared so much about in the book.

There is nothing about this film that is good.  Absolutely nothing.  It isn't faithful to Tolkien and it is just a piece of pop culture.  This is the movie equivalent of cookie cutter pop music that no one will remember in 10 years.

I shouldn't have expected anything different.  Hollywood film making is all about the CGI action and adventure.  This is what is making billions of dollars for the industry.  Imaginative and clever films don't fare so well at the box office because people would have to think and appreciate nuance, figure out little details themselves, and put pieces together without it being shoved in their face.  Or you can watch this.  Have fun.",1419638400,57,6981,4.457210776545167

They are a joy to watch and an excellent way to escape for a while into another world where magic is real and adventure awaits at every turn in the road.

Right from the opening scene, BATTLE draws us into the story with a breathtaking and, at times, tear-jerking scene of Smaug laying waste to the lake village. From there the action continues, with barely a moment for you to catch your breath once the armies go into battle.  The acting is superb, the special effects amazing, the musical score enthralling, and the cinematography excellent.

This a beautiful film and a worthy conclusion to the Middle Earth saga. Billy Boyd provides a fitting and moving tribute with his rendition of ""The Fond Farewell"" during the closing credits.

I love this movie for the same reason Return of the King is one of my favorites; it's a movie of almost pure climax throughout, the culmination of two movies' worth of story build-up. The opening scenes resolving the struggle with Smaug are magnificent. The White Council's battle against the Nine is enthralling. The eventual doomsday showdown between dwarves, men, elves, orcs, eagles, a bear-man, wizards, and a hobbit was nothing short of spectacular. And of course, that last fight between Thorin and Azog....amazing, amazing, amazing! This movie never lags for a moment, and does a great job of setting up Fellowship of the Ring as the next movie in the chronology. I was almost surprised Jackson and crew had the guts to kill off the same characters who died in the book. I half (or more than half) expected them to soften up that part of the story, but they followed through, in brutal fashion, actually. The entire movie is quite a violent affair, but the performances of Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, and Richard Armitage in particular give it all the heart it needs to balance out the violence. Freeman is fantastic, and definitely succeeds in making Bilbo as likable and memorable as he needs to be. Also, it's a nice touch to hear Billy Boyd's voice singing the closing song as the credits roll, and makes me wish there could be more of Middle Earth to find its way to the big screen somehow. Maybe one day, a capable director like Guillermo Del Toro might get his hands on The Silmarillion, which I think would be unbelievable if done right; but I don't really expect it. More than likely, this is our last taste of Tolkien at the movies. I'm sad to see it end, but it was a mindblowing ride while it lasted.",1419465600,,1886,4.649700598802395

A hobbit gets caught up ingods you should know this by now. I feel as if I've been in this cinema for years.

What did I think?

The third and final instalment of The Hobbit films is, rather thankfully, the shortest of the trilogy yet still manages to be too long. It doesnt have as much bloating as its predecessors but there is still too many scenes and an elongated ending.

On the VERY positive side it also features an amazing battle scene that delights in both quality and length and Jackson doesnt beat around the bush too much before getting into it. The plot wraps up nicely and the action abounds in an incredibly entertaining way and while its a shame it wasn't a bit tighter (read: shorter) this was probably the most entertaining of the three comfortably.",1419379200,6,785,4.507042253521127

A top notch fantasy classic to satiate thrill riders like myself who has been reading the best fantasy authors out there for decades. Peter Jackson reigns supreme in getting those fantasy images out of my head and placing them firmly onto film. Even better, in fact!

which was faithful to the Book.  Peter Jackson was more faithful to the Hobbit story than he was with the LOTR trilogy though I loved all four
movies.  He did add some extra story lines such as he mush thing between the elf and the dwarf, as well as adding Legolas who was not in the
book.  But I found the additions harmless to the overall tale..  However, my only critical complaint
was that the whole stories were a bit too long.  The book is quite short and the movie could have been done in one or two films.  Still, 5 stars for
the overall superb production quality. Jackson is an excellent director of action and casting, though sometimes I think he overdoes it a bit such as he did in KING KONG  though the recreation of 1930s NY was excellent.  He added Legolas and his strange Wizard  friend with the poo in his hair
to the script; and also introduced us to Sauron.  My favorite line in the Book and he puts it in the film what I consider the best opening in
any Children's Book and  that is this quote: ""IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND THERE LIVED A HOBBIT""..Magnificent I think and that line is in the
beginning of the movie, though Frodo does not make appearance in the book and the name ""Shire"" also does not appear in the story.

I would be lying if I said The Hobbit trilogy was worthy of the standards set by The Lord of The Rings Trilogy.
But it is still one to remember.
The trick is to watch them and judge them by their own standards, not as prequels.
In the new film, the plot isn't always so sharp, the stakes aren't too high, Alfred's ""comic relief"" was unfunny and extremely repetitive, and most of all, there is just so much going on it gets a bit overwhelming, but when the film overcomes these shortcomings, which it is often able to do, it is pretty epic.
As the final film in the Middle Earth saga, you might wish for something a little bit better, but by it's own standards and by those set by the first two Hobbit films, The Hobbit: The Battle of The Five Armies is a strong film.
Also, extra points for the ""Strider"" reference at the end and for us once again getting to hear a Hobbit say:
""The eagles are coming!""",1419292800,4,930,4.201117318435754
5271847,4,B0095HHLMO,"Theatrical review.  Aside from my bad math (I only counted 4 armies), this final chapter of the ""Hobbit"" trilogy was pretty impressive from a production scale and provided some excellent action and hand-to-hand combat sequences.  The film begins where the last one (""Desolation of Smaug"") left off.  A thoroughly pissed off Smaug the dragon is flying toward nearby Lake-town to breathe down fire and destruction, er...desolation.

This is a pretty strong opening and brings Bard (Luke Evans) further into the story as the town's savior.  The 13 Dwarves led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) have taken over Smaug's mountain and are sitting on enormous wealth made up of gold and other valuable items.  Their companion, Hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) managed to find the one valuable stone that would help Thorin control the vast territory.  He has held back the discovery as Thorin has been acting strangely, attributed to some gold-hording disease.  It's something similar to what happens when you wear the ""ring"" for too long a period.  Thorin refuses to share the wealth with the now homeless people from Lake-town who also have a claim on the mountain.

Then of course there are the always-in-chase-mode, Orcs and the Elves led by Thranduil (Lee Pace).  So where is the 5th army?  Is it the one led by Thorin's Dwarf cousin?  Surely not the war-bats or whatever they are called.  Aren't they part of the Orc army?  So what is the problem with the movie?  Well for one thing, Bilbo isn't much more than a bystander, wringing his hands, trying to convince Thorin to be more generous.  The few dramatic scenes between Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner) and Thorin and anybody are too brief to get us very interested.  I also had a hard time buying into the fact that the 13 Dwarfs are such a fighting force that even if they were to join the battle they would have much of an impact on the many thousands of trained warriors below their mountain perch.

Having said all that, ""Five Armies"" is big.  It is spectacular.  It has humongous CGI effects.  And kudos to the sound department.  It also has a satisfying and unexpected conclusion.  Recommended?  Sure.",1419292800,6,2183,4.866847826086956
5271848,3,B0095HHLMO,"I would have loved to rank this movie by one more star than I did with Desolation of Slog-I mean Smaug, but once again we are served with another missed opportunity. As I left the 2D showing, I kept thinking of the could-have-beens and why-was-that-in-theres more than the actual highlights. (minor spoilers to follow)

Immediate Highlights:
1. Watching Smaug in action. A long awaited scene that needed to be in the story sooner.
2. Viewing Dain Ironfoot, voiced by the always wonderful Billy Connolly, mounted on his battle boar and proclaiming to an army of elves to ""sod off!"" So far, the best sounding Dwarf in live action cinema.
3. Watching Beorn leap off of his eagle mount to transform into his bear form then start crushing orcs.
4. Watching Saruman, Galadriel, and Elrond do battle with the ghosts of a familiar enemy to save Gandalf. This segment was a love letter to Tolkien book and movie fans as a set up for the forth coming Lord of the Rings Trilogy.

Then, Immediate Let downs:
1. Finding out that Dain Ironfoot, Dwarf and all, was complete CGI. I know it would have been hard to get Billy Connolly to put on Dwarf makeup and clothing for very little screen time, but that would have been awesome! When you see the dwarf model interact, it both looks good (like Blizzard Entertainment good) but awkward with real actors.
2. Not seeing Beorn kill Bolg, the spawn of Azog. Instead, we see #&$%ing Legolas steal the show one more time. I don't have particular issues with Legolas, well, being Legolas. But I do have an issue that Peter Jackson HAD to have him included THIS much in the Hobbit trilogy. The bout on the crumbling CGI bridge wasn't as fun to me than imagining watching Beorn crushing Bolg.
3. Random relationships are assumed then cut off like they didn't matter for this ending. Thorin and Bilbo have an amazing ""Broship"" that feels more random than progressed into. So when a certain scene happens, it was hard for me to FEEL the emotional betrayal or loss. Instead I scratched my head feeling perplexed. Tauriel and Kili's love for each other feels even more pointless here. In fact, the idea that Tauriel was brand new and created by Jackson, I honestly was hoping her to die to help personify the tragedy of love for each other...since you know, she was never in the book material. Nope, we see her degraded from the needed strong female character into a stereotypic trope.
There are more I could name off, but here is the number one let down: it's not of this movie in particular, but
4. Realizing that they could EASILY added the Smaug attacking Laketown then dying by Bard's arrow in the second movie instead of waiting till the third. If only, I mean ONLY they had cut out the slog that was in the Desolation of Smaug and added that segment into it, I would  regarded the second Hobbit movie as one of the strongest in the whole franchise. But no, we had to have an unneeded cat and mouse CGI roller coaster ride.

Overall, The Battle of Five Armies, to me, was more entertaining than The Desolation of Smaug.  The main feat that you pay to see is entertaining to watch even though it can get muddled with CGI and over the top fight scenes. And like Peter Jackson, some fights are just too overdrawn. But, portions like the legions of orcs pouring through holes sculpted out by huge rock worms, I'll admit I was purely entertained. You have to prepare yourself that this is called ""the Battle of the Five Armies"" for a reason. Most of the movie literally is a battle...and mini battles that can wear out their welcome. If you have invested this far, and you are an absolute fan of Middle Earth book or movie, then by all means finish this trilogy at the theater.  The ending itself is not as like the infamous ""many endings"" that Return of the King portrayed. This time it was nice and sweet and got to the point as you could truly end this one and dive right into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I just wished there wasn't so much slog to get through though.

** When the inevitable extended edition rolls out, I will probably have a separate review. I'll admit I am hoping there is more added before Bilbo packs up and heads out.**",1419292800,9,4170,4.522546419098143
5271849,5,B0095HHLMO,"The Hobbit-The Battle of the Five Armies

 I can only cry out in anguish that after a truly spectacular run we will have no more Peter Jackson made films based on the immortal J.R.R. Tolkien books.  He has used them up to entertain us, uplift us and massage our sense of wonder.  Some might think that after three heroic Rings movies and now three Hobbit movies the public might be satiated.  Not the public I talk to and not me either.
 The trio of Hobbit films describe events that happen prior to the story of the three Lord of the Rings films.  I think it might be fun to watch the three Hobbit movies followed by the three films in the Rings series in one, long exhausting weekend of Hobbit binging.  As a group these films are among the best ever made and no doubt we and our heirs will watch them as long as we have movies.
 Not all the films are equal however.  This one, perhaps appropriately as the last in the series, has a more somber tone to it than some of the others.  I miss the interplay of the irrepressible hobbits, the grumpy dwarfs and the aloof elves in the other films.  That by play and the asides really made the films for me.  I often quote the hobbit schedule of eating from the first film.  Breakfast, second breakfast, elevenses, luncheon, tea.... and so on.  In this one we get no joking among the dwarf and elven fighters when things look their darkest.  In the final film, business is business.  And there is a lot of business, as might be expected with a battle royal culminating the film with five separate armies contending.
 We have epic, gigantic, non stop action through out the length of the film, beginning with devastation of Laketown by the dragon Smaug.  The special effects/cinematography for this episode in a strange way makes the destruction of the human occupied town beautiful.  The entire film unrolls in the same way.  We have terrible events, fights, battles, death and heroism against long odds shown in the most beautiful possible way against a background of immense natural beauty and man made (or elf made or dwarf made) grandeur.  Many of the outdoor shots Peter Jackson filmed in his native New Zealand, a country with wild and seldom seen vistas.  We even have a final look at the Shire, the little half buried village inhabited by hobbits.  The set of the Shire has become a tourist destination in its own right down there in New Zealand.
 Peter Jackson directed and also wrote the screenplay with helpers that include Guellemo del Toro.  Mexican born del Toro  made his bones as a director with the innovative and well reviewed films Mimic and Pan's Labyrinth.  He also helped in the writing of the other two Hobbit films.  Fran Walsh also helped write.  Walsh helped write the entire six film series.  Pippa Boyens also has a writing credit as she did with the other two Hobbit films.
 Our friends are back again to fill the cast with familiar faces.  Martin Freeman returns as the little hobbit with a brave heart, Bilbo Baggins.  Ian Holm has a cameo as the 111 year old Bilbo.  Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee play the wizards Gandalf the Grey and Saruman the White.  Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Evangeline Lilly, Hugo Weaving and Lee Pace fill the roster of the elven leadership.  Richard Armitage gets to play the heroic, demented Dwarf King Thorin Oakenshield.
 The plumb acting assignments went to Richard Armitage and Evangeline Lilly.  Armitage must show how the immense hoard of dragon gold gradually erodes the Dwarf King's personality and drives him mad with greed.  Lilly has a very few minutes on screen to show the deeply felt but deeply conflicted love between her and one of the Dwarf King's warriors.  Love between a mortal dwarf or human and the more or less immortal Elves always presents an emotional problem and Lilly finesses the dueling emotions efficiently and well.  Most of the other actors have only a few minutes to do their thing quickly.  Even though the film last for two hours and 24 minutes, there are a lot of characters and a lot of action to cover.
 Perhaps too much action and too many characters.  While I enjoy seeing orcs chopped up in any of a dozen ways in car load lots, the non-stop mayhem leaves little room for our character to do much besides fight.  Jackson might have spent more time on cute conversation or on building the love story between the trans-racial couple and cut out ten or 15 minutes of battle.  Just say'in.
 Still, the grand epic fantasy does end the series with finality.  The PG-13 (blood, death, fire, slaughter of a great magnitude-no sex) film has already taken in some $355 million world wide.  The films as a body have garnered nearly FIVE BILLION DOLLARS at the box office and who knows how much more in TV and DVD sales.  Popularity at this level makes the job of critic more or less irrelevant.  Everyone who can will see this movie, by that I mean everybody in the world.  They should see it and so should you.
 Fun Facts-Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchette and Orlando Bloom are the only actors that appeared in all six of the Ring/Hobbit films.  Even though Cate Blanchette appeared in all six films, she worked on set for only eight days.  But every second that she is on screen is something worth seeing.

I'm won't repeat most of what has been said, but I would like to add a few comments

I second the ""Poetic Justice"" of the Master of Laketown.  Can't think of anyone MORE deserving!!!

Many appear to have overlooked the the consequences of Tauriel's situation.  She has lost the love of her life.  What usually happens to elves when that happens?  (remember Arwin?)  Very few elves survive the lost of a loved one.  The Elf King is a rare exception, and look what it cost him?

Mostly, I would like to note how this movie relates to the real world in regards to war.  Note that the only people talking sense are the two socially ""little"" people.  Bilbo may be a country squire at home, but that doesn't mean anything in the outside world.  Bard may be the descendant of Kings, but that was a long time ago.  He is only an (un)common laborer.  One is reminded of a quote from an American Civil War solder who said that ""If it had been up to the common soldier, this War would been over in 5 minutes with a handshake.""

It's the ""important"" people that are causing the problems.  Thorin,  Thranduil, and Sauron are only out for themselves.  The only thing that matters is what THEY want and who cares about the consequences. The greed and stupidity of so called important people are what causes wars. Just look around you in the real world today.

5271852,3,B0095HHLMO,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies""

1. This is the third movie in the series of one children's book.

2. Being the sixth movie about Middle-Earth, it's not really worth describing the plot. You know what's going on, or you don't. But for those that don't know the story, and think this movie is really all about the dragon, you will be disappointed. If you notice, Smaug isn't even in the title of this film.

3. Being the last movie, everything is bigger in this one. The epic-ness is more epic. The melodrama is more melodramatic, and the corny humor is even cornier.

4. Orlando Bloom has either become almost completely computer generated, or has had way too much plastic surgery done. He doesn't look real. He actually looks like a plastic action figure.

5. Some of the battle scenes (and there are quite a few of them) are great, and almost awe-inspiring. Some of them look like amateur rip-offs of ""300"". And speaking of battle scenes, the orcs like to proclaim that ""the fields will run with blood"". But the only blood in the movie come from a few light scratches on cheeks. Nobody bleeds on the battlefield, even if their heads are cut off.

6. I thought I was on acid when I was watching Galadriel banish Sauron.

7. Note to self: If I want to win a war, I need to have the giant bear ride the giant eagles at the beginning of the battle, not the end.

8. For better or worse, Peter Jackson has re-invented Middle Earth, and strayed pretty far from the original book. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but people will forever think this was Tolkien's vision, when it was more Jackson's.

9. There's enough fan service in this movie that Middle-Earth addicts will probably proclaim this is the Best Movie Of The Year. But there are enough problems with it that haters will be justified in hating it even more. Most of the rest of us will just shrug our shoulders and say, ""Meh. It was fine.""",1419206400,21,1940,4.473087818696884
5271853,4,B0095HHLMO,"[Edit 3/24/15: This is a review of both the film itself and the Blu Ray/DVD combo pack, not just a review of the film. Scroll down to the bottom of the review to see my thoughts on the home release. Enjoy!]

THE FILM
Peter Jackson's take on The Hobbit has always felt like ""The Hobbit, as told by The Lord of the Rings."" While the book is a self-contained, episodic adventure, the movies pull the double duty of endeavoring to tell the story while striving to fit into the whole of the Middle Earth world established in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The book came first, and while other events like Gandalf's journeys during this time were retconned into the timeline by the Appendices of Return of the King and other writings, the book was essentially focused solely on Bilbo and anyone around him at any given time, usually the dwarves.

By taking this approach, Peter Jackson undertook the task of ""epicizing,"" as it were, The Hobbit. While the book already had some scenes that could be deemed epic, the bar was set very high in the Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of Pelenor Fields. The Battle of the Five Armies feels similar to those in scope, but different enough to stand alone. The other aspect of Jackson's approach is that rather than serving as a cap to The Hobbit film series, this movie had to set things up for Lord of the Rings to commence. The bookends at the beginning of An Unexpected Journey and Battle of the Five Armies were well-constructed. Indeed, the LotR nerd in me was probably overly excited about the ending of this film, which--and this is not really a major plot spoiler--is the beginning of Fellowship of the Ring with the camera placed inside Bag End with Bilbo rather than outside as Gandalf knocks on the door.

Let me address the good and the bad of this movie. First, the good. Martin Freeman has consistently nailed the role of Bilbo Baggins. He looks enough like Ian Holm to pass for a younger version of the actor, and he is the heart and soul of the films. Ian McKellan has been universally accepted as Gandalf from his debut in Fellowship, so it comes as no surprise that he is again the perfect Gandalf for the Hobbit film series. Props to Richard Armitage who does a very good job as Thorin, portraying the heroic leadership qualities excellently as well as the character's gradual descent into madness and back. Even though Smaug's presence in the film is limited, Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a fantastic performance as the dragon.

Other good components are the general pacing of the film (even at a little under two-and-a-half hours, it feels pretty brisk), the score, which is phenomenal, and the way the battle scenes play out. Peter Jackson knows action scenes, and the thing he does best is he keeps the action focused on named, identifiable characters. It is the same thing he accomplished in the Lord of the Rings, where despite having massive battles going on everywhere, the camera always managed to locate key players the audience came to know prior to the battle beginning and thus with whom audience members had some emotional connection.

This movie basically boils down to two large action sequences. The beginning is like a James Bond film with a huge action sequence that plays out in full before the title even appears on screen. Then the rest of the movie is the buildup to and subsequent payoff from the titular Battle of the Five Armies. The movie presumes its audience saw the two prior installments, so much so that seeing them is a necessary prerequisite to seeing this film. However, there are a few very well-placed reminders from Desolation of Smaug that are plot-centric. The best is the reminder that in a moment that lasted all of 2 seconds in the prior film, Bilbo did, in fact, find and acquire the Arkenstone, the gem sought by Thorin upon reclaiming Erebor. It worked perfectly as a reminder to the audience that Bilbo had it and Thorin was never going to find it because Bilbo finding it in the previous film was more of a footnote when compared to the stories-tall dragon standing next to him.

Now for the criticisms. Even though it has the shortest Middle Earth film runtime, the movie is still a bit too long. That has been my one consistent criticism of The Hobbit movies. The Lord of the Rings films had more material to squeeze into the films. The Hobbit clocks in at roughly 7 chapters per film. What results is a theatrical cut that feels like an extended cut. While some source material is changed, one would be hard-pressed to find anything the writers skipped outright ala Tom Bombadil in Fellowship. The Hobbit trilogy could have been two films: film 1 leading Bilbo from Bag End to the Lonely Mountain, and film 2 leading him into Erebor and including the Battle of the Five Armies. The extra material would have worked better as a home release. Battle of the Five Armies has the benefit of being shorter, but the 45-minute titular battle did not really need to last 45 full minutes, and battle fatigue sets in a little.

My next criticism is that there's still too much CG in these movies. It is better than Unexpected Journey's CG, which, in some cases, looked pretty poor comparatively. The CG work here is decent, but the use of miniatures, prosthetics, and real setpieces in The Lord of the Rings gave those films a timeless quality that The Hobbit movies (save for Gollum and Smaug) will likely never have. While I would not say Peter Jackson got CGI crazy here like George Lucas did in the Star Wars prequels, he did over-rely on it somewhat. WETA Digital consists of a number of talented artists, but WETA's props department is also talented and the movie would have benefited from relying on that team a little more heavily.

Another criticism I have is that while there's a good amount of Bilbo in the movie, there just wasn't enough. Martin Freeman's characterization of Bilbo really grounded the films and gave them their heart. This movie suffered a bit because structurally it lacked that one major scene that each of the two prior films had. This is partially the result of the book structure and partially the result of the three-film decision. To expound on this, the scenes I'm specifically referencing are Riddles in the Dark in Unexpected Journey and the Bilbo-Smaug confrontation in Desolation. Riddles in the Dark is the single most important scene in The Hobbit because it serves to single-handedly set up the Lord of the Rings storyline by showing how the Ring got to Bilbo and subsequently to Frodo. However, from a filmmaking perspective, it was also arguably the best, most well-crafted scene in The Hobbit franchise. Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis delivered a Shakespearean performance that left zero room for improvement (and props to Freeman, who perfectly captured Bilbo on his first week of playing the character). Likewise for the Smaug material in Desolation of Smaug. While there was plenty of action in that scene as well, one of the best parts of that movie was the interaction between Freeman and a giant CG dragon brilliantly portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch, another very strong actor. By contrast, Battle of the Five Armies had the major action scenes, but by virtue of the chapters it adapted from the book, it was left without the intellectual battles depicted in the prior two movies, and that, by extension, meant that Martin Freeman had less opportunity in this film to show what he is so good at than he did in the other two movies.

A final criticism I have is the score, which I already called phenomenal. I stand by that description, so why, then, is the score subject to criticism? Because there are some missed opportunities. Howard Shore is a scoring genius. He crafts excellent themes that carry these movies perfectly. But two of his best themes--the two that are among his most memorable--are constrained to Unexpected Journey and never branch out into the other two movies despite clear areas where they could appear. The themes to which I am referring are the ""Misty Mountains"" theme, also identified as Thorin's Company's Theme, and ""Dreaming of Bag End,"" which is sort of Bilbo's theme in Unexpected Journey. Thorin's Company had a very heroic take during Unexpected Journey, and when Thorin and co. charge out of Erebor into battle, the score, while appropriate, would have benefited from a reprise of that theme. Likewise for the Dreaming of Bag End theme, which would have been wonderful to hear either in certain quiet moments or when Bilbo physically walks back into Bag End. While these themes' absence from both subsequent Hobbit films was disappointing, that is not to say the new themes and reprisals in Battle of the Five Armies were poor. Quite the contrary; the music worked very well, and the Lake Town theme first heard in Desolation of Smaug received excellent treatment here, as did several of the other new themes. While the lack of bookending with the music from the first movie stands as a criticism, my overall positive impression of the score stands as well.

My lengthy review of the film itself can be aptly summarized in this way: Battle of the Five Armies is a satisfying conclusion. If you have not been a fan of Peter Jackson and co.'s treatment of The Hobbit up to this point, this movie will not change your mind. It is stylistically consistent with the other two movies--it is still more LotR than Hobbit in tone. It is also a little longer than it needs to be. Nonetheless, if you've seen the other 5 movies in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth series, this film will leave you satisfied. It wraps up The Hobbit competently enough and sets the stage for Lord of the Rings. It may not have the same universal praise The Lord of the Rings enjoyed, but it is a solid entry in the collective film series as a whole. For all its faults, The Hobbit films are still good in their own right. By virtue of the source material, The Hobbit was never going to trump Lord of the Rings no matter how hard it tried. Its greatest accomplishment is that it fits in well with the sequel series, and the key scenes that it HAD to get right throughout the films--Gollum and Smaug--were perfectly captured.

BLU RAY PACKAGING
As with the other Hobbit films, this is a fairly standard package. The artwork varies depending upon which release you pick up. My personal favorite is the Bilbo cover for the DVD-only release, but the others work as well. They all like nice lined up on a shelf.

VIDEO QUALITY
I did not get the 3D Blu Ray release, so I cannot comment on that. The Blu Ray itself is crisp and beautiful. The colors are all appropriate. Except for the very end of the movie, this film is largely a darker, bleaker affair. The color scheme on all of the various covers accurately captures the look and feel of the movie. Smaug flying over Lake Town in a fiery rampage is the easy highlight, but seeing this film at home, it was noticeable that the CG was much improved over the first Hobbit movie. Things that are CG look and feel better integrated into the live action than in the last couple of movies, with the first one being the bigger offender. Spot-checks of the DVD are exactly what one would expect--excellent for DVD, but not up to Blu Ray standards. If you have not transitioned to Blu Ray yet, this is still a fantastic looking DVD.

AUDIO QUALITY
""Masterpiece"" is not a term I throw around lightly, but this is certainly in that ballpark. Action movies always run this huge risk of improper audio editing, but thankfully, the LotR series as a collective whole has avoided that shortcoming. Everything is easy to hear and very clear and crisp. I have a 5-channel sound system with a subwoofer and everything was just fantastic. This is on par with other LotR movies. It also reminded me of the Star Wars movies which, regardless of anyone's thoughts on the quality of the various movies, had some fantastic audio work on the Blu Ray. The score, the voices, the sound effects, and everything that blends them all together coalesces into a beautiful work here. I gave my thoughts on the score itself above, but in terms of quality, this is top-notch stuff.

EXTRAS
The extras on this set are consistent with the prior two films' theatrical releases. A small sampling of quality bonus features is included here. As movies go, this is actually a pretty solid group of extras. There are the now-standard New Zealand as Middle Earth feature that briefly goes through the various locations used for filming, a look at Billy Boyd's recording of the ending credits song (which is particularly engrossing), a feature about the 6-movie series as a whole, a feature regarding changes from book to screen, and a feature about recruiting cast members for the titular five armies. These are good extras--though not really a full disc's worth of content--but at this point, we all know what's coming. The November 2015 release of the extended cut will have the extras that Peter Jackson has rendered legendary at this point, so these are more of a teaser.

VERDICT
Peter Jackson's Middle Earth series has been consistent in terms of its home video releases since Fellowship of the Ring. This is the theatrical cut release, which means you get the movie as shown in theaters and a sampling of quality extras. The extended cut is a foregone conclusion and it will unquestionably dwarf this release in terms of content. However, if you are a fan of the theatrical release, it is a worthwhile purchase. Some will criticize The Hobbit franchise for being over-long. Some will criticize it for deviating from the source material too much. If you liked the movie, this is a very good home video release, most definitely worth picking up. This is one of the gold standard films for demonstrating what ""Blu Ray quality"" is supposed to mean from a visual and audio standpoint. Recommended.",1419206400,7,13854,4.711927362773421

Breathtaking visuals, beautiful score, spot on casting, characters we've grown to love, action sequences that have you gripping the arm of your chair...what more could you ask for? As usual Peter Jackson masterfully brings Tolkien's vision to life in a way only he can. Pay no attention to the ignorant people complaining they are 'stretching' one book into 3 movies-not so. Jackson incorporates other stories and tales of middle earth as well. A deserving finish to the greatest series ever made.

5271855,3,B0095HHLMO,"Three stars compared to most movies, two stars compared to the five star Fellowship films. This started off fairly promisingly, cutting to the chase by commencing the build up to the war. We see Galadriel encounter Sauron; interesting, except I think scenes of living people fighting ghost enemies are dumb. The dragon attack was fairly good, as was his death. Things progress quite briskly, and the dreaded assault of the orc armies arrives on time after a reasonable retelling of Thorin in the halls of gold.

Alas, the battle disappoints. There are some good enemy fighters, and the special effects start off well, though if you ask me the Elf Army is effete. It was much more realistic at the start of Fellowship. But we don't see the pinpoint slaughter-by-arrows that the elves are so good at. All in all most of the combat is repetitive. Nor are the military skills of the dwarves much in evidence.

Alas again, then all the tedious not-written-by-Tolkien interpersonal scenes, the Agony of Thorin, etc. etc. come along and totally distract from the action. Another orc army is supposedly on the way, but we only ever see a few advance creatures. Usual tragic death scenes, NOT very moving. We see Bilbo back to the Shire - pretty slowly - and bid farewell.

I'm glad I went to see this at the show, since I might never have bothered to rent or buy it. I've read the books many times, and seen the Fellowship movies 15-20 times each. But what it seems to come down to is that Peter J is a good storyteller, but a bad writer, and there was too much money on the table not to drag this out so long.",1419120000,10,1602,4.536332179930795
5271856,5,B0095HHLMO,"If you came to see a battle, a battle you get. All but a very few moments of this movie portray scenes from that war. In some scenes, sprawling vistas show plains blackened with marching warriors. In others, it portrays combat at the personal level, face to face attacks with sword, mace, or war hammer. Yet other images capture the human element: bravery and cowardice, nobility and cupidity, and, always, personal loss. With a CGI budget comparable to some nations' economies, the fights and the fighters themselves, whatever kind of being they might be, come vividly (if almost bloodlessly) to life.

Smaller segments of the movie seem more character-driven, largely by (or around) Thorin or the elves. I haven't read the book in a long time, so I can't vouch for this movie's fidelity to the original. I'm not going to worry about that, though. If you don't mind action replacing plot through much of this (and I don't), there's a lot to enjoy.

5271857,5,B0095HHLMO,"First off, I'm an absolute Middle Earth fanatic, both on the literary page and on the screen (I've seen and read it all, literally). This is my personal perspective on The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. And if you visit the comment section, I'll detail what's in the EXTENDED EDITION. So stick with me, dear reader, because this review could be long and fraught with emotion. Let us begin! IMO, BATTLE might just be the best of the Hobbit trilogy. The fans of the book will get their emotional moments, their classic Tolkien lines, and their respect treated seriously, while Peter Jackson reclaims his throne as the living King of Epic, with the Wagnerian grandeur, big feels, and visual splendor he does so well.

From the opening moments, wherein Smaug the Terrible rains down an unholy blitzkrieg of dragonfire on unsuspecting Laketown, BATTLE sets a snappy pace and only lets up long enough for you to gasp in awe or dab a tear from your eye. BATTLE is at once the most epic and the most personal of the trilogy. The Company of Thorin have now captured Erebor and are sitting upon a massive hoard of dragon gold. Drawn by riches and power, the forces of good and evil converge upon the Lonely Mountain. War between elves, dwarves, men, and orcs looms fell on the horizon even as darkness creeps into the heart of Thorin Oakenshield, and the Dark Lord Sauron looks to make a comeback.

And let's not forget our returning veterans: Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, and Sir Christopher Lee, aka the coolest 92 year old alive!
But the film is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richard-Armitage/dp/B000AYEL6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richard Armitage</a>'s all the way. Armitage portrays the dragon-sick Thorin Oakenshield's descent into madness and ultimate redemption with the charisma and electrifying gravitas of a Shakespearean king. This is a performance for the ages.

Before I talk about what I liked about the movie, I want to (briefly) talk about what I didn't. Yes, I have NO problem admitting the Hobbit films ARE flawed. The dependence on digital imagery, the length, and the rushed or slow pacing all hold The Hobbit back from reaching the great standards of LOTR. But, I personally feel, they don't hold it back from being what it is as well: big, bold, beautiful fantasy made with passion, skill, and love for Tolkien.

Okay, I'll shut up and talk about the film. The centerpiece of the film is a giant battle, so the action needs to deliver. For this guy...heck YES it DID. Peter Jackson has few equals when it comes to epic scope, visual splendour, and spectacle of Kurosawa-esque proportions! In anyone else's hands, a full hour of fantasy battle would get repetitive, but PJ never sacrifices the high-stakes action for compelling storytelling, character or emotion, keeping all but the snootiest viewers enthralled throughout. And the Battle of Five Armies is his best, most restrained action work since that other movie he directed (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Land-of-the-Rings/dp/B007ZQAKHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Land of the...Rings</a>&nbsp;or something?).

An awe-inspiring Dwarven charge from the gates of Erebor had me shaking and crying like a lunatic (*cough* it was the air conditioning), while the real standout is what might be Peter Jackson's best directed sequence since ever, a stunningly beautiful scene in which Thorin and Azog face off mano-a-mano atop a frozen waterfall. (OH THE FEELS!) And I was MIGHTILY impressed with the CGI. It's by far the best in the series, which makes sense: Weta Digital has had the most time to work on it. Adding to that, Jackson is shooting with hundreds of extras and physical orcs, adding that extra tactile something. Once more the love and dedication put into designing the film's look, costumes, and weapons by the crew shows in every scene.

Plus all the other things that you know you're getting from a JRR Tolkien film: the visual splendour of New Zealand, the timeless Howard Shore score, and that magical transport to Middle Earth. In conclusion, I must fittingly award The Battle of the Five Armies with Five Stars. As a fan of epic cinema and fantasy, and most importantly as a Tolkien fan, BATTLE delivered a bold and beautiful send off for the cinematic world of Middle Earth. It makes me sad that the journey has come to an end. But Middle Earth, on the page and screen, will live in my heart and soul forever! I want to thank all those who poured their time, their effort and their love into giving these movies to us, the fans. We appreciate your work and your love of Tolkien. Hantanyel renyallo!

And with this, I take my bow. Thank you for reading.

5271858,5,B0095HHLMO,"What I love most about this, the final Peter Jackson Tolkien movie:  how it transitions smoothly at the end into the setting for The Fellowship of the Ring.  The two things I really didn't like were the pointless romantic subplot that didn't end satisfactorily and the ridiculous implausibility of jumping on collapsing rocks at the ice fight at the climax, like in a corny video game.

Having gotten the really good and really bad out of the way in my discussion, I now focus on the rest of the movie, which I found better than average (even though I still wish Peter Jackson had not messed with the book so much):

I love the total immersion Peter Jackson's Tolkien movies give you into a world resembling pre-Christian northern Europe, with elements of Christendom such as the focus on keeping one's word and protecting the helpless.  I also love the vast landscapes which New Zealand has been perfect for, and the ways this movie finds appropriate points for exciting action without feeling like it's contrived--unlike the first and second Hobbit movies, which took the plot in awkward directions for the purpose of exciting action.  (Big mistakes in #1:  Having Bilbo jump down from the burning tree to do fighting instead of just having the eagles rescue 'em, ruining the poetic power of being rescued when helpless; the collapsing scaffolding that no one gets injured from; no one being harmed as the stone giants fight with each other; and having a constant action-fest of evil creatures chasing after 'em on their journey, while part of the book's appeal is that there are no CONSTANT dangers, but a lot of unexpected ones which happen in incidents along the way.  Big mistakes in #2:  Turning the barrel escape into Legolas acrobatics, which looked both cool and cheesy; having all the dwarves try to stop Smaug in the most unbelievable extended fight, making me stop taking the movie seriously; and complicating the story with an interracial love affair that drives some of the action.)

I was expecting this concluding movie to be as laughable as the end of the second Hobbit movie, The Desolation of Smaug, when Smaug gets less and less scary the more he stares at dwarves in the face and threatens 'em without actually following through--and they're completely unharmed by all his terrifying flames.  I was pleasantly surprised that in this movie (The Battle of the Five Armies) Smaug finally gets to be taken seriously as he sets all of Laketown ablaze in a matter of 5 seconds or so.  I like the Helm's Deep and Gondor battles from the Lord of the Rings trilogy better than this movie's but still found this one a really worthwhile experience.  My favorite action scene was the Smaug one, because it's a lot more of a visual treat than looking at nasty orcs, goblins, trolls, etc.

The movie doesn't show enough of the choreography/individual maneuvers of the elven and dwarven armies and enough geographical orientation to make the battles as thrilling to me as Helm's Deep or Gondor.  But I at least got regular breaks from the typical philosophizing about the evil of gold and how easily corruptible menfolk are (and dwarves and elves) and how evil Sauron is.  I think this is the only Peter Jackson Tolkien movie which didn't start to annoy me with the archaic philosophical dialogue, and that's partly because the plot points happen at such a regular pace that they don't have as much time to ruminate (hooray!).

A word of warning:  The scene where Sauron takes form as an evil fiery eye has very frightening images that were scarier for me than either of the two previous Hobbit movies.  There are some Lord of the Rings trilogy images which are equally scary, but that is the scariest for the Hobbit movies, I feel.

The music, to my relief, didn't get moody and melancholy/gloomy as often as the other Hobbit or Lord of the Rings movies.  I have usually only been halfway pleased with Howard Shore's musical choices for these movies, but this time found it blended into the movie really well.

I am pleased that even though there were a lot of things I disliked in the first two Hobbit movies, I liked The Battle of the Five Armies quite a bit, changing my impression of the earlier ones because of its satisfying conclusion.  There is also a farewell song which has meaning to the Middle Earth characters AND to the audience at the end credits, sung by Billy Boyd who played Pippin in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.",1419033600,7,4441,4.7315175097276265

the second was exciting and fun, four stars, however this hobbit failed in almost every way (side note for what it's worth i rate all three lord of the rings movies an easy five stars. i've read that trilogy, the hobbit and the silmarillion. They all get off the charts ratings beyond five stars).

it became like a looney toons film. absurd characters like the assistant to the lord of lake town, bizarre fight scene physics, hilarious characters with extremely strange movements and physiology in serious roles:

a giant goblin with maces for feet, a giant goblin who hammers down a wall with his head and passes out, a dwarf king who is 100% cg and takes out many enemies by head butting them when everyone else must use swords/hammers, etc.

and these are all during serious war scenes. it ruins the film. i found myself laughing out loud. sincere laughter, no sarcasm or exaggeration, i was just cracking up. and when you're cracking up at scenes that are supposed to be gripping and exciting it ruins the film.

it gets more than one star simply for the scene depicting gandalf, saruman, galadriel and elrond fighting in dol goldur.

other than that this movie has almost nothing to offer. it has made a mockery out of the series, surely indeliberately but still that's the case.

another gripe *begin minor spoiler*:

 thorin for no reason whatsoever is affected by the gold in almost the exact same way that the ring of power affects people. why? i suppose they realized that there is nothing in the hobbit story that is as deep or gripping as the ring twisting the mind of it's owner and wanted to borrow the idea? in the book thorin becomes obsessed with the treasure sure, but he doesn't go completely mad, hallucinate, and have a mental showdown with himself. in the book he is as obsessed as any person could be with a vast treasure, nothing out of the ordinary. in the movie they went nuts with it.

5271862,4,B0095HHLMO,"Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy worked beautifully because it was based on a trilogy of books with the genuine depth of an epic fantasy drama.  Turning the relatively shorter HOBBIT into a trilogy was a much riskier move, however, as the length of the story doesn't really require a nearly nine hour long marathon.  One of the biggest criticisms of this trilogy is that it's slower paced and filled with padding.  Most of it is from footnotes of Tolkien's universe and attempts to tie it to LOTR.  For the most part it works; the casting is uniformly excellent (Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage especially as Bilbo and the moody Thorin), the visuals realize the beauty of Middle Earth to a tee and the action sequences, although bordering on goofiness at times, are nonetheless thrilling.  And as with the cliffhanger DESOLATION OF SMAUG, the titular dragon makes a delightfully splendid villain, as voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch.  There are times, however, when Jackson does take some liberties with Tolkien, and add in scenes that feel more like, well, roller coaster rides and a few new characters who don't really add much to it.  That said I still have enjoyed the first two HOBBIT movies quite unreservedly despite any issues I had, and I was still anticipating this last one.

The first thing I should mention about THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES, is that in order to truly enjoy this film you have to be prepared to come to terms that this is not meant to be a standalone movie, but the final act of a story.  Because each of these movies are meant to be viewed together as a single unit, viewing THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES without seeing the first two parts is not recommended (unlike, say, the STAR WARS prequels where one could disregard Episodes I and II if they choose and go with the superior if not spotless third episode).  As mentioned, Tolkien purists will also find plenty to carp at for the occasional additions and liberties Jackson chooses to take.  If it's a strictly word-for-word approach you want, this isn't it.  If, however, you're prepared to accept all of that, then it's much easier to appreciate the movie at face value.

THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES starts off with a thunderously explosive bang as Smaug takes out his fiery rage on the village of Laketown.  This spectacularly staged sequence is nothing short of visceral as we see buildings topple and others torched by the dragon's fiery breath.  Everything about this scene all the way up to the climactic showdown between heroic Bard (Luke Evans) and Smaug (who gets to have several new lines) is magnificent, and arguably the highlight of the movie.  The story takes a more slower but essentially darker turn, however, as the once proud Thorin Oakshield (Richard Armitage) becomes greedy and refuses to part with any share of the gold in his now reclaimed home.  Naturally, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) doesn't take too kindly to this and, in an act of daring defiance, hands over the Arkenstone to the Elf King in order to prevent a bloodbath.  This and Thorin's paranoia strain their friendship and ultimately build to what Jackson promised to be the longest battle ever committed to screen.  And long the battle of the five armies itself truly is, taking up a good forty-five minutes of the film's 144-minute duration.  (Ironically, this is the shortest of the Middle Earth movies!)

In between that and en route, there are other positives to this final chapter.  The dynamic between Thorin and Bilbo is powerfully presented, with Freeman and Armitage both providing strong, emotionally charged performances.  The chemistry between the two is very powerful, and arguably the real heart of the movie.  Indeed, it makes the final parting scene between them all the more heartbreaking and misty-eyed.  Armitage also does an expert job of portraying Thorin's conversion to an avaricious tyrant -- at some points his voice melds with that of Smaug's, providing for a rather chilling and frightening effect.  This change of character culminates with Thorin having a nightmarish vision of being swallowed by the gold he craves; a somewhat surreal but nonetheless very effective scene.

The performances in THE HOBBIT have always been among the strongest points of this trilogy.  Aside from Freeman and Armitage, Evans is a very charismatic and instantly likable Bard, and the addition of him having a family of similar strength provides the character with an arguably greater dynamic both for taking down the beast.  He is easily another hero to root for, as are returnees Ian MacKellen as the wizard Gandalf, Hugo Weaving as the elvish Lord Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, and Orlando Bloom as Legolas.  Christopher Lee also gets to show off some real fighting stunts in his return as Saruman.  Although his appearance is brief, Saruman's hint of becoming corrupt is also chillingly presented.  Billy Connelly, although mostly seen on a CGI-rendered pig and wielding an unrealistically huge sledgehammer, is a pleasant new addition to the cast as Thorin's uncle.

For all its positives, though, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES isn't without its faults.  Although most of it is just excessive nitpicking on my part, there were several bits that I felt could have been handled differently.  Although the battle between the armies itself is dramatically staged for the most part, there were times when I felt disconnected from it, not necessarily because of the onslaught of CGI characters.  Legolas' heroic action stunts such as catching a ride on the talons of a bat, slaying said bat with his arrow, and dodging falling bricks like Super Mario also border on goofiness.  Even his antics in the LOTR trilogy weren't as ""cartoonish"".  The climactic showdown between Thorin and the nasty Orc Azgog is also too drawn out to have any major emotional impact one way or the other.  (That said, the final parting from Bilbo and Thorin that follows this showdown takes the movie's emotional heart back on track.)  I'm also unclear about the love triangle between the she-elf Tauriel, the young dwarf Kili, and Legolas.  Although all three actors involved play it well, and the resolution is indeed heartbreaking, it doesn't feel very necessary to the momentum of the story and I do question why Jackson thought to include it.  Admittingly, Tauriel is a pretty cool character, but again, her presence feels extraneous at times, as if there needed to be a heroine.  Probably the only really useless character is Alfrid, a corrupt town official who, aside from having a getaway disguised as a woman, is otherwise a fairly forgettable character.  Luckily in the extended edition, he is mercifully bumped off.

Speaking of the Extended Edition, it's clear that Jackson wasn't particularly thrilled about how the theatrical cut turned out for this last chapter, and has stated on record that the extended edition is his preferred version.  That's subjective, of course, but to me the best scene of the extended edition is a funeral scene for Thorin and a few more moments where the other dwarfs get moments to showcase themselves.  However, it's rather curious that this extended edition is the only one of the Middle Earth movies to get an R rating, and most of that applies to one gruesome attack scene.  I don't think such violence for the heck of it makes a story better.

Quibbles aside, everything else about THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES excels; the production values are as top notch as you'd expect from Jackson, Weta, and company, Howard Shore's score is, as usual, magnificent, and as mentioned, the casting and performances are all spot-on.  Aside from the opening and the dynamic between Frodo and Thorin, the other major highlight of this last chapter is the ending.  It is brilliantly done and faithful to the book, concluding with a very clever lead-in to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING as the older Bilbo (Ian Holm) goes to greet Gandalf for the first time in years as the camera slowly trucks in on the map before the closing credits begin.  For all that, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES, although sketchier than one might expect, is still worth a good recommendation and ranks as a solid final chapter overall.

On the whole, if THE HOBBIT trilogy falls in the shadow of TLOTR, despite its sometimes draggy pace and occasional missteps (mostly from additions that sometimes work and sometimes don't), it's still good fantasy fun for adventure lovers at heart, and everyone involved still deserves to be commended for their efforts at bringing this tale to the screen.",1419033600,4,8573,4.91325468424705
5271863,5,B0095HHLMO,"First off, I must add that I feel lucky to have obtained the chance to see each of the Hobbitt films within a month after each of the films were released in the U.S.  People that have followed my online profiles would also confirm that I have enjoyed the previous two films as well as The Hobbit: The Battle of The Five Armies.  Please know that I also acknowledge that there were a number of actors/actresses who contributed to this film; Im just listing the men and women who I felt intuitively guided to discuss. For these reasons, I would prefer to eventually obtain all three dvds when they come out as a three dvd set even if that means I would have to wait longer than those who are waiting for just this film. One of the reasons for my rating is due to the multiple thrilling action scenes and plot twists that are in this movie and tie into the other two movies. For instance, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is up to his usual crafty game of trying to support Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) while discreetly facilitating the safe passage of a rare artifact. Gandalf The Grey (Ian McKellen) ends up with dual role of having to boost morale among his group while simultaneously acting as mediator.  Tauriel (Evangeline Lily) is romantically admired by both Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) and Kili (Aidan Turner). Thranduil (Lee Pace) is still simultaneously coming to terms with accepting his son Greenleafs love for Tauriel and releasing the urge to be overprotective of Legolas Greenleaf. Thranduil is also dealing with the responsibilities of being a leader among the elves.  A huge element of surprise awaits all of these previously mentioned characters as well as members of their tribes due to the five army battle involving the gatherings of humans,elves, dwarves, animals (such as the eagles and bears), and orcs. Stephen Fry, Benedict Cumberbatch, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, and Christopher Lee are also among the multiple celebrities who make appearances in this film which is perfect for many men and women familiar with any of the previous Hobbit films and/or those who like fantasy movies.",1419033600,2,2122,4.869806094182826

The Hobbit film trilogy has quite a flock of haters and understandably so since everyone has a different perspective on the book but as a work of art it has its own merits.

Ian McKellan, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee reprise their roles magnificently as always (we even get to see Galadriel kick some butt which is a real treat) but it is Richard Armitages Thorin Oakenshield who really makes the magic of the film. Why isn't this actor better known? He simply devours the scenery in every scene he is in with his magnificent demeanor, dramatic power and charisma and pulls of the complexities of this eccentric yet fearless character like a walk in the park. Those glittering sea blue eyes, that chocolate voice. And that brown fur cloak and golden crown was simply made for him. What I love best about his performance is that he never makes Thorin look like a victim of insanity. Instead he plays him as someone who has chosen to put his heart in his earthly treasures than his comrades and the helpless peasants he swore an oath to, pretty much the way Humphrey Bogart does in The Treasures of the Sierra Madre. We see his neuroses developing layer by layer until the climatic I will NOTPARTwith ONEPIECEOFIT.  Further proof that his lust for power and wealth is a matter of free will rather than dementia lies in the scene with the smooth golden floor, where he evaluates what Lord Bard, Bilbo, Fili, Kili, Balin and the others have told him over and over and foresees himself sinking into utter depravity, illustrated by the vision of the melting floor with a whirlpool. Realizing what he has become, he casts his crown aside and wears his usual clothes again. Armitage packs yet a further emotional punch at the end when he begs Bilbo to forgive him for being so blind. His last words are perhaps the greatest quote in the whole trilogyand the book for that matterIf more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, what a merry world it would be. I do so hope the Academy includes him on the 2015 Supporting Actor ballot.

Martin Freeman brings an awkward self-consciousness appropriate for Bilbo Baggins; he is after all, an average every day man so it makes sense that he would stammer and have difficulty looking a person in the eyeespecially when that person is of a totally different atmosphere from his dull, quiet, comfortable, uneventful life. Armitage really ran rings around everyone in this film but Freeman was still good.

The only things I have a problem with are:

1. Alfred, the governors son with the rotten teeth and simian demeanor. He comes across as one of those grating, ear splitting, brain dead personas included for comic relief a la Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffanys and Sacha Baran Cohen in Hugo where you wish he would just leave the screen.

2. Legolas climbing up falling bricks on a precipice. That was over the top and unrealistic. I know The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit are fantasy but still

But this third film still gets a solid five stars from me. As for my qualms wellI always know how to hit the fast forward button.",1418947200,11,3236,4.6948853615520285
5271865,4,B0095HHLMO,"Truer in tone and spirit to Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy ( not without a few share of jokes which seemed out of place, forced and which fall flat) takes off like an arrow aimed at a dragon's heart and continues its rapid-fire pacing throughout. At a meager 144 minutes in length, which is 17 to 25 minutes shorter than the two previous Hobbit films, the cinematic affair fittingly cuts much excess and remains the best of the three.

Jackson sets up sweeping action scenes with terrific and breathtaking cinematography, made all the more gorgeous to look at by the movie's intricate costume design,  as he has done in the five previous Middle-Earth features but none of the action is as well done and entertaining as it can be deemed spectacular.  Some of the shots are so bad they look like they come from a video game while many of the others are very competent and appear to be well thought out.  This creates a strange range of effects quality but there are far more hits than misses.

  Woefully the ending comes so quickly and with such little emotional resonance is very off putting but doesn't take too much away from the fact that this is an old- fashioned epic that proves why Jackson is so highly respected by critics and fans alike. With these six Middle- Earth films, the King Kong remake and many of the other mega- budget works in his repertoire he has proven that grand scope, detailed and beautifully designed sets, a good cast giving great performances all around, an assortment of Ray Harryhausenesque monsters and ghouls in the manner of many Hollywood fantasy pictures from the past is a recipe for timelessness that works well with a wide array of audiences.  ""The Hobbit : The Battle of the Five Armies "" is proof of that.

  The end credits are also a nice additive.  We're given storyboard drawings of the Middle- Earth sets before they went into production.  I wish more intimate touches like this went into the story that took place before it as it seems Jackson and his aids on the project were trying to give the film something he knew it lacked.

  This is the best of ""The Hobbit"" films, more in line with "" The Return of the King "" then you might imagine,  even if it does occasionally feel like after six Middle - Earth motion pictures the series is starting to get a been to the well too many times feel. Despite this Jackson still finds ways to keep the narrative rocketing forward, the characters fleshed out well enough to be accessible without hindering the propulsion of cinematic events and keep the proceedings supremely intriguing.  It's a fitting finale that will sit well with fans of the series but probably will not bring in any new ones.",1418947200,5,2699,4.599164926931106
5271866,4,B0095HHLMO,"The final installment of the Hobbit starts off with the sinister Smaug raining down his dragonfire on the helpless inhabitants of Lake Town.  The verbose dragon that greeted and sneered at us in The Desolation of Smaug is a quiet terror here, savaging Lake Town into piles of floating ash and cinder.  While he was formally menacing his penchant for exposition never allowed him to be terrifying but now we feel the terror of his rage and quiet savagery.  Gone are the lighter and frequent humorous touches found in the previous movies; the tone is set, and this movie is about struggle, loss, and what true meanings might be found in life.

The two-and-a-half cinematic hours fly by bringing us to an end that feels a little abrupt.  Along the way the warring factions set up their pieces like pawns on a chess board; Thorin Oakenshield and his company of dwarves have taken back the Lonely Mountain while the broken and cold masses of men from the destroyed Lake Town take up residence at Dale while the wood elves come to collect (by force, if necessary) a treasure that had been lost to them long ago.  Oakenshield refuses to make good on his words to pay out as he is going mad from greed so men and elves prepare to go to battle with Oakenshields ragged company.  Meanwhile, the specialized orcs and goblins gather for their sneak attack to take over the Lonely Mountain and make it their spearhead to launch their ceaseless assaults against the inhabitants of Middle Earth.  And with a few other twists and combatants entering the fray (including elven favorites Legolas and Tauriel) the battle of five armies is enjoined.

At no time does this battle feel as epic (large) as some of the other battle spectaculars seen in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  This surprised me because a movie whose sub-title is The Battle of the Five Armies suggests a truly epic battle in size and style.  It is a pretty grand battle but the scope is much smaller than what we may be used to or expecting.  The pacing of the battle (the arrays, the delays, and then the stages) is actually a strong point for the movie, as is the necessary detailing of smaller but consequential moments within the war such as Oakenshields storming of a high guard or Legolas triumph over a particularly nasty warrior orc.  But when the battle is over and the hordes retreat and the survivors gather their fallen it seems too sudden.  The movie ends on a peaceful and humorous note (which is at odds with the overall tone of the film) and sets up quite naturally for The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

So all in all this is a really enjoyable movie (and in 3D it felt almost real) with great pacing.  It turns Bilbo Baggins and the relationships hes made into the heart of the movie, which makes a great deal of sense, and is heavy on action and much lighter on dialogue throughout.  But it also lacks some of the light touches of humor that the preceding movies possessed and whose ending leaves us wanting a bit (or a lot) more.  4.5 stars.  Worth seeing on the big screen.",1418947200,2,3042,4.538461538461538

5271868,4,B0095HHLMO,"For the last decade and a half, Peter Jackson has been bringing audiences to the legendary world of JRR Tolkien's Middle-Earth.

And for the moment, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies"" is the final piece in this cinematic tapestry -- the big action-packed climax to the first half of this story. While it has some weak spots (such as the whole awkward subplot involving Tauriel), it packs a devastating wallop to anyone who has come to love the characters over the past two movies, from the stubborn Dwarf king Thorin to the doughty little Hobbit.

Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) is only barely stopped by Bard (Luke Evans), who manages to take down the dragon with his black arrow... but not before Smaug destroys Laketown. Bard becomes the de facto leader of the refugees, who find themselves starving and homeless as winter approaches. Thranduil (Lee Pace) comes to help them with food and other supplies, but he's also there to back up Bard's claim on a share of the Dwarvish gold, and reclaim a certain item from Erebor.

Meanwhile, the White Council comes to Dol Guldur to rescue Gandalf from the mysterious Necromancer. And they soon find that he was right about the Necromancer's true identity, and the horrifying spectres that are rising to menace the world. And Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) head to the fortress of Gundabad to figure out what is going on with the orcs.

And back at the Lonely Mountain, Thorin (Richard Armitage) is seized by ""dragon sickness,"" a lust for treasure that makes him a paranoid wreck unmoved by the two armies massing on his doorstep. Bilbo must take desperate measures to keep Thorin's mad greed from starting a war -- but when Dwarf and Orc armies arrive, war between the armies becomes an inevitability.

""The Battle of Five Armies"" is best appreciated as the final part of one very, very long movie. ""An Unexpected Journey"" set the scene and began the journey slowly, and ""The Desolation of Smaug"" was an increasingly tense build to the climax. This movie IS that climax -- at least half of it is an epic battle between multiple armies, swinging between different characters in a multilayered battle royale.

Expect lots of bloody duels on the ice, elven acrobatics, and a ragged army of angry fishermen running through a ruined city. Just as it seems that the good guys are about to win, they're suddenly bludgeoned by a new attack that leaves them crippled and desperate. And the bloody consequences of the battle isn't limited just to nameless extras -- some characters whom viewers will have grown to love will die, and Jackson gives their deaths the painful pathos they deserve.

But Jackson hasn't lost his touch for the quieter moments. The aftermath of Smaug's death has a haunting quality as the Dwarves wander their ruined halls, and the audience sees Thorin growing progressively more detached from reality. And the movie's final scenes are bittersweet ones -- the everyday world seemed stained with blood and shadowed by the presence of Sauron. Things suddenly feel unbalanced and uneasy, even if the sun is shining and spring has come again.

But there are some things that really should have been cut, such as the rather silly romance subplot -- it feels like the studio decided, ""Female viewers won't watch unless there's romance!"" and demanded one that makes little sense. And with the Master gone, the character of Alfred becomes less villainous sidekick and more annoyance.

But one thing nobody can complain about is the acting. Martin Freeman's Bilbo is sometimes eclipsed by the dark, brooding, hubris-crippled Thorin, but he remains the amiable heart of a big, splashy, action-packed movie. Armitage is the other half of the movie's soul, slowly twisted by his decades-long obsession with regaining Erebor, and his increasingly mad lust for its gold. His final gut-wrenching scene with Freeman is absolutely perfect, bringing their troubled friendship -- and Thorin's classic hubris -- to its inevitable conclusion.

There are also excellent smaller performances by Ken Stott as the grandfatherly Balin, McKellen as a rather battered, desperate Gandalf, John Bell as Bard's tough teen son, and Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee in one brief, intense scene at Dol Guldur. Lilly and Bloom are a bit wasted, though -- they don't have a lot to do, plotwise.

Two particular scene-stealers are Evans and Pace, as the two kings -- one old and one new -- who butt heads with Thorin. Evans brings a passionate, desperate energy to Bard's role as a loving father, and easily extends that same protective care to all the people from Laketown. And we see a bit of Thranduil's raw pain and grief under his haughty smirk, when he wanders past the bloodied bodies of slain Elves.

""The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies"" is top-heavy on action and tragedy both, filling in the last gap in the saga of the hobbits and the One Ring. It has some missteps, but the passion and grief make it a powerful experience. And all the brilliant, epic action scenes don't hurt either.",1418860800,5,5065,4.911111111111111
5271869,1,B0095HHLMO,"So I've opted to add this preface to this review since some seem to believe I go too far in depth into the review and grade it unfairly. Since that is the argument then I hope here to offer a much briefer review that will look at this as an independent film that is free from the rest of the Tolkien legacy.
This is not a good movie. The pacing, the character development, the logical errors and plot holes all add to this film being a poor addition to the Hobbit series. Character development for anyone beyond Thorin was pretty much abandoned after the first film. Instead we're left with a cgi video game that is very shallow and seems to cry out against war in it's final moments despite the fact that it is the violence and the war that is glorified throughout the film. This film is an attempt at being a spectacle and a continuation of world building. We're left wanting more from characters that are interesting (Bard) and wanting less of characters who honestly make me wish I was watching anything else (Alfred? Whatever the monobrow guy's name is). And so for these reasons and this film's taking itself far too seriously I award this one star.

If you want more continue here, though apparently some think this review is simply too much or too negative.

On one hand I can genuinely say this is a better film than Desolation, or at least it is genuinely better in a different way, in a different way it is far worse that Desolation. Plot inconsistencies, character arcs that go nowhere, uninteresting love-triangles that still continue, all these things and more you can find in this film. So let's get started then shall we with the review for The Hobbit 3: The Battle of the Boredom.
MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD!
So, I want to begin by listing the few things I did like about this movie, don't worry this list will be very short.
1) The battle flags, these were interesting and created a cool effect.
2) There were a few bits of good acting interspersed throughout.
3) They actually killed the people who were supposed to die.
4) Some of the orcs were people in costume! This was incredible and unexpected.

See? Short. From here let's take a walk through the movie, looking at everything that's wrong with it from the beginning.
The film opens with Smaug flying over Lake Town (Esgaroth) and laying waste. This doesn't look terrible until we see the fire effects, obviously the budget went somewhere else because this looks horrible. As we're running through this bit we're treated to several moments of slapstick involving the horribly fat Master and his Patsie (Arthur? Arnold?) After some moments of seeing Bard locking in jail we see that the Master is riding his boat out of town loaded down with jewels and actively pushing drowning people off the boat, I'd mention the obvious hit on greed and Wall Street that Jackson is commenting on but it's pretty apparent. Well, it seems the boat is too heavy and so the Patsie is pushed overboard while the Master keeps floating away. Bard meanwhile has found a plan and throws a rope out a window, conveniently hooking the Master and using his larynx for leverage to get the bars of the window broken. We then have the shot of Bard running to the top of the bell tower and shooting at Smaug. This goes on long enough for Elf-Girl Kate to remind us his armour can't be pierced, but don't worry, Bard's son is there to save the day. Together they have a brief interaction with Benedict Dragonbatch and Bard successfully shoots and kills him.
What follows is one of the best moments of the movie. Smaug flys into the air screaming before succoming in one of the greatest bits of overacting on Benedict's part I've ever seen. He begins to thrash before issuing a death gurgle and falling right on top of the already asphyxiated Master, presumably killing him.
From here the film takes us to Dol Goldur where Gandalf is still imprisoned (doesn't he have anything better to do?) After the appropriate amount of time we're reminded that Radagast is in this film and Galadriel comes to save Gandalf, deadlifting him and carrying him through the ruins before coming across the Ring Wraiths. A battle ensues and Galadriel whips out the same light of Elenduil that she gives to Frodo in Fellowship and that he uses against Shelob in a much better series. She has a moment where she looks positively silly before Sauron Team Rocket blasts away. This plot point is done, we see the last of Christopher Lee saying he'll take care of Sauron and Gandalf and Radagast ride into the sunset.
From here we're treated to a tedious wait of watching the coming battle. Thranduil arrives, Bard is annoyed by the Patsie, and Thorin goes insane. BIlbo is understandably worried and hides the Arkenstone (it was in his pocket!) This lasts about a half an hour before Bilbo sneaks away, gives the Arkenstone to Bard and returns.
From here we slide into the silliest of dream sequences as Thorin is swallowed by the golden floor of Desolation before coming to his senses. Oh no wait that's not until the battle is almost over.
Actually we're treated to the tidings of a battle between four armies; elves, dwarves, mens, and orcses, the gangs all here and it looks to be even worse odds than the battles in LoTR. There are casualties on all sides and we're treated to shots of such things as super wyrms, super trolls (even biggerer and baderer) as well as a mindless videogame war that makes up the majority of the movie.
Another great moment comes up when we see Dain, Thorin's cousin show up, and he's marvelously... riding a pig... Wait seriously? OK, well he looks pretty cool, he's all gingery and, IS THAT REALLY HIS VOICE?! THAT'S THE DAD FROM BRAVE! Well it's OK because they picked a good actor who looks right and OH GOD WHY IS HE CGI?! That's right, the incredible Dain Ironfoot not only has the most obnoxious Scottish accent this side of Craig Ferguson (He actually sounded like Fat Bastard) but he's a CGI monstrosity who looks wrong. This choice alone is unforgivable and I can't believe it was made. I could stop the review here and give it one star... but I'm not done yet.
Well from here there's nowhere to go but DEATH. That's right we get not one but two massive to-the-death sword fights between Kili (nope he dead) Fili (oh... he dead too) Legolas (no worry here and no tension since we know he's alive 60 years later) Bolg (who?) Azog (who's pulling an Ophelia and floating under the ice all beautiful-like before stabbing Thorin in a surprise foot trap!) and Thorin (who accepts death with open arms). These battles take about 20 minutes and are neat to look at, though in all honesty they look like videogame boss battles, especially Thorin vs Azog.
Well soon Thorin is mortally wounded, his family is dead and Elf-Girl Kate is sad. But don't worry because she has Get this Guy a Zanax Thranduil who tells her it's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. We have Thranduil also tell Legolas to find Strider/Aragorn and we have Gandalf, tapping away at his pipe for... two minutes? Couldn't we have reapportioned this time somewhere else? Like figuring out what happened to the jewels Thranduil wanted or showing Thorin, Fili, and Kili's funerals? Nah, we get Gandalf tapping his pipe and Bilbo going home to Hobbiton.
Well in the end we find it all wrapped up into a nice bow when old-Bilbo meets Gandalf at the beginning of Fellowship and the last 20 seconds are just Fellowship. And all of a sudden it's a far superior film! It's a film that makes me want to watch a better film! I guess I should do that instead.

So let's highlight a few key problems with this shall we?
1) The constant reminders that LoTR comes next. These are two separate stories and they should have been treated as such, instead we get constant winks and nods at the camera when someone says something that directly sets up the events of LoTR. Many of these are unneeded, we can figure it out, we can fill in the gaps ourselves, we don't need you Jackson.
2) The constant ""go girls!"" moments. These happen with Turiel multiple times and they even happen with the women in the village who decide to fight in a rousing speech of ""let's fight with our men!"" This is honestly just a ploy to make it more accessible to women and I find it offensive. It's not that there are women playing key roles, it's just that these are key roles that are shoe-horned in and feel completely forced. It shouldn't feel force.
3)The biggerer and baderer bad guys. This movie just felt like it was trying to outdo LoTR at times, especially in the final battles, and it was bad, especially in the character of Legolas. Legolas obviously has to do bigger and better things with each movie, but with this what they've effectively done is made him do the most outrageous things before LoTR even starts. This creates a plateau, then immediate fall in Fellowship, and it's silly, it damages the character and it damages the story.
4) Turiel. Again with Turiel. I know why she's here. As a way to appeal to women (pt 2) she is a strong female character and she is useless and lore-breaking, especially when she is shoved into a relationship with a dwarf. This is the thing. An elf and a dwarf being together in Tolkien lore is actually incredibly silly. It's more akin to me falling in love with a cat (because they are that separated). In creating this romance they are damaging the relationship between Legolas and Gimli, which was the first elf-dwarf friendship ever. And it was exactly what it needed to be.
5) Bilbo isn't in it enough! It's called the Hobbit remember! For a movie with a book that was very anti-war, this movie was all about the big battle scenes.
6) Sauron looked stupid and his flying away Team Rocket style was ridiculous.
7) It's amazing they could play that complex song with a single horn at the end.
8) The Patsie is a stupid useless butt of a character and removes all tension from every scene he was in. He is pointless and is effectively the JarJar Binks of this film.
9) It's a prequel. Here's the problem with prequels. You have to backtrack characters, you have to put characters in situations of danger. The problem with this, when the characters are ones from movies set in the future, is that you don't feel fear for them. When Legolas is bouncing around or fighting Bolg I feel nothing. No fear, no excitement, only boredom. I know Legolas will survive. I know Bilbo will survive. I know everything I need to about these characters because they were so perfectly summed up in LoTR. What has effectively been done with these movies is that we have had to backtrack characters to a less interesting place and attempt to get them to the place they were in in the original series. Take Legolas, in Fellowship we know he's an elf, we see he can do some cool things with a cave troll and we know he dislikes dwarves. Through the next two movies we see him become more awesome and develop a relationship with Gimli. This is good. This is a good show of character development. However when we play the Hobbit in suddenly we have Legolas as instantly awesome and in Fellowship we're left to wonder why he isn't doing more. It breaks him. Additionally it breaks him because it lessens his relationship with Gimli because they are no longer the first dwarf/elf friendship ever.
10) Fact checking and consistency. Here's the thing, again this is a geeky one. Aragorn is 11 at the time of the Hobbit. He's already in Rivendell at this time and he's been there since he was 8. It makes no sense that a child would be called Strider and that Legolas would be sent to find him, regardless of time switching in the movies. Aragorn said he was 84 or 87 in Two Towers extended and we know the Hobbit is between 60-70 years prior to the events of that book so even in the movie's timeline it is messed up. This is as bad a mistake as Gimli apparently being a child (he's 60).

In closing I want to make one final observation. Greed. It's amazing how this entire story revolves around the problem with greed while it's so apparent that the entire thing is just a cash grab. Thorin's final words of ""if more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world"" don't have the same ring when you consider that Jackson was standing there and that these movies were made by people who had more interest in hoarded gold than creating a good film.

I'm just glad it's over. I only pray that we never have to be subjugated to a movie series based off the Silmarillion. I pray that Christopher Tolkien and his family never sell the rights and it is never made. This is my hope. This is my only respite.",1418860800,52,12669,4.542231947483589
5271870,5,B0095HHLMO,"Story:
The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies concludes the epic journey of Bilbo Baggins of the Shire and his legion of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield, under the guidance of Gandalf the Wizard, with a powerful, emotional finish. It begins right where part II left off, and wastes little time building towards the incredible war that is about to take place for the treasures of the Lonely Mountain.
Thorin must decide if he should live in his Grandfather's footsteps and horde all of the gold that is rightfully his, or listen to his solemn friends at the end of their dangerous journey to reclaim their home. The Bard and his townsfolk want only enough of the treasure to rebuild their fire scorned town, while the Elves want their cut of the diamonds, and yet the Orcs and Goblins, led by Azog the Defiler, wish to claim this Mountain fortress for its strategic position in the land, under their master Sauron, who is confronted by Galadriel, Gandalf, Elrond and Saruman. When the Dwarf army enters the fray, war becomes inevitable despite the pleas of the burglar Hobbit, Bilbo and his golden ring of invisibility. Tamriel (smoothly weaved into the story and an original character not in the J.R.R. Tolkien Book) lends her support along with the expert marksman Legolas, as she must decide if Kili, the Dwarf she is taken with, will be worth pursuing during this great war.
The expertly filmed battle endures through most of the film, yet keeps the audience compelled as we fight alongside our heroes and villains, while their stories unfold one last time.

3D:
The experience of the 3D itself adds to the immersion into the film's world, matched with the high frame rate technology that increases the sense of being there, watching these characters battle for their very lives in smoother real time it seems. Throughout each sequence, the 3D remains consistent, with an average but effective depth of three dimensionality to enhance the spacing between objects beyond what a 2D film can do. There are occasional pop outs that add to the excitement, coupled with key shots of increased 3D depth and form. This is perhaps the most effective use of 3D in the trilogy, thanks largely to the overwhelming battle scenes that takes place, and all the layers of troops involved.",1418860800,204,2276,4.835897435897436
5271871,4,B0095HHLMO,"Spoiler Warning: If the Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies was an adaption of a fantasy video game. Then yes it would be one of the best fantasy movies ever made. Well despite silly moments like Cate Blanchett carrying Ian McKellen around like a bday in one scene. But the film hardly feels like the book at all.
While there's plenty of great action; I couldn't help nitpicking throughout about how many scenes weren't in the book. And rolling my eyes during scenes where there's lectures about love. Since there's no love story in the Hobbit book.
Don't get me wrong Aiden Turner and Evangaline Lilly have great chemistry as a dwarf and elve who found forbidden love. However in the end their romance was kind of pointless. And the forbidden love thing is overdone in movies; especially these days.
  While as I pointed out the film was hardly the book. I was entertained through-out as a fan of fantasy. But there's so much cliches and obvious moments where you know someone will come make the save when anyone was in danger. The positives though are great action sequences, Cate Blancett kicking ass. As well as stand out performance by Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Lee Pace and Cate Blanchett.  And in the end it felt like Peter Jackson's the Hobbit more than ever and not Tolkien's but without Jackson totally at the top of his game.",1418860800,3,1346,4.670886075949367
5271872,5,B0095HHLMO,"Let me preface my review with two points: 1) Since childhood, I've always loved reading the Tolkien's ""Hobbit"" and always will. 2) I am also extremely appreciative of how Jackson expanded the story into a far fuller, richer telling of the embattled dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield.

The Battle of the Five Armies starts-in immediately with action and seldom slows down. If it feels like this is an unusually fast-paced film, it's because it is. However, at no time did I feel overwhelmed in trying to keep track of all the goings-on. And I can also assure you that despite such great battles as Helms Deep and Minas Tirith (Battle of the Pelennor Fields), the Battle For Erebor will show few similarities. Yes, Jackson achieved a uniqueness in all three gigantic pitched battles throughout the entire saga, which I found to be impressive in furtherance of each battle's high entertainment value. This film's central battle won't disappoint.

Alert: Spoilers Ahead!

As much as I was NOT a fan of the focus on Lake Town's political intrigue ""filler"" in The Desolation of Smaug, I found the repeated appearances by the weasel Alfrid in this film to be an eye-rolling opportunity again and again. Moments of levity during an intense battle worked perfectly between Legolas and Gimli at Helms Deep. It didn't work here.

The Battle of the Five Armies takes place at a point in Tolkien's book that was for all intents and purposes, glossed over in a few pages. However, Jackson seized the initiative to bring not only the original greedy orc army into the fold, but the forces of the Angband orcs and the sheer malevolence of Sauron himself who wished to (after winning the battle) use Erebor as a staging point for an invasion of the entirety of the West. This was a plot point I took-to with relish, because it makes complete sense in the expansive conflict that was the Lord of the Rings saga.

In keeping with the use of the appendices to the Lord of the Rings, Jackson included the setting (not explained in Tolkien's ""Hobbit"") of the fortress Dol Guldur and the rescue of Gandalf therefrom by the White Counsel -- Elrond, Galadriel and Saruman. This is a scene in which the extremely formidable talents of those age-old warriors are on display against the Nine Black Riders and eventually, Sauron himself. Visually, it was as hectic as it was triumphant. I have no compunctions in telling you how much of a treat this part was to watch.

Now, back to Erebor... After bravely killing Smaug, Bard is able to marshal the Lake Town folk as he brings them to the steps of the Lonely Mountain itself. This was out of necessity as the town was mostly destroyed in Smaug's rage -- another visually impressive set piece. Unfortunately, elvish King Thranduil has also marched an army on Erebor, not out of friendship towards the dwarves in their time of need, but out of greed. His interests begin and end with a case of bright gems, despite the protests of his son Legolas and fellow elvish warrior Tauriel.

The dominant focus of the film for me, was the magnificent performance of the troubled newly-crowned King Thorin. Alluded to in The Desolation of Smaug, was the often-underestimated effect that such a treasure horde can have on the mind of a mortal. Add to this, the poisonous effect that Smaug's ever-present malice had on the entire realm within the Lonely Mountain. Further compounding the disturbed Thorin, is the sheer weight of the power and influence he suddenly wields. He trusts no one and begins treating his once-friends as nothing more than servants, if not slaves. Richard Armitage will hopefully garner an Oscar nomination for his dizzying and powerful portrayal of a mad king.

In fact, Armitage performed his paranoia and power-madness so well, that when he eventually breaks it and rallies his fellow dwarves head-long into battle, it rivals Gandalf's arrival at the climax of the Battle of Helms Deep in The Two Towers. Simply excellent writing is exemplified when you literally want to cheer for a character's actions on screen. And you'll want to do A LOT of cheering as every individual protagonist gets his and her chance to shine throughout the battle, which was choreographed and balanced beautifully by the film's writers.

Yes, I am a diehard fan of this trilogy, but -- especially owing to how it was expanded beyond the simple lighthearted tale it was -- I don't think you can blame me. I encourage you to read the appendices to the Lord of the Rings and therein, you'll see just how fascinating the dwarvish culture is, as well as how much Tolkien unfortunately neglected enriching their history in his story. I simply have to add what is one of my favorite quotes (okay, paraphrases) from the entire saga: ""if more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."" -- Thorin Oakenshield",1418774400,310,4856,4.792114695340501
5271873,4,B0095HHLMO,"I saw this movie last night. As is to be expected, BOFA was epic and spectacular, a feast for the eyes and ears. Every aspect of the movie was obviously the product of painstaking and loving craftsmanship. I particularly loved the ice/snow setting. Richard Armitage was fabulous and a little scary as the gold-maddened King under the Mountain, and Martin Freeman gave his usual touching performance as the humble Hobbit trying to keep the peace when all around him want war. The scene between Armitage and Freeman at the end of the movie was especially touching. BOFA was a thrilling and sometimes gasp-inducing end to the Hobbit trilogy.

I enjoyed 90-95% of the movie, so why the four-star rating?

SPOILERS AHEAD!!

1. Too much Alfrid. No, he wasn't in every scene, but in a movie with a large cast of characters and many loose ends to be tied up, the inconsequential and very minor character of the assistant to the Master of Laketown was on screen way too much, much more than any Dwarf besides Thorin. Probably more than Legolas who is someone LOTR fans would have loved to see more. I liked Alfrid in the second movie, but enough is enough.

2. Fili and Kili should have died IN BATTLE trying to protect Thorin, their uncle and king. Instead, Fili is captured and murdered before the eyes of his brother and of his uncle, and they have very little reaction to that death. Kili, as I had feared, dies trying to protect the non-canon Elf girl he loves. Thorin, as far as I can remember, doesn't even know he has died. So the end of Durin's line ends up being just a brief throw away.

3. Thorin, instead of dying IN BATTLE, has a one-on-one duel with his arch nemesis, Azog the Defiler. It was a cool battle, tense and exciting and he does have his final talk with Bilbo (as in the book) that makes everything right. It was a touching scene. But I expected there to be mourning for him and for Fili and Kili, heart wrenching and epic, and a grand funeral for the last of Durin's Sons. Instead, nothing. Bilbo tells a teary line of Dwarves goodby and goes home.

4. Instead of reconciling with his father, Legolas says ""I can't stay,"" though never explains why. He has some unrequited love for Tauriel that his father doesn't approve of? What? Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

Sooo . . . perhaps I had unrealistic expectations. Given the tragic and truly touching death this director gave Boromir in LOTR, I was hoping for something even more epic for Thorin and his nephews. Instead, Fili and Kili were little more than collateral damage, quickly passed over. Tauriel's post-mortem kiss on Kili's lips was touching, I admit, but she seemed to be the only one who mourned him.

I just wanted more. I hope in the EE there will be more.

So, definitely don't miss this wonderful movie, especially since it rounds off the wonderful trilogy. Just don't expect tragedy over spectacle (and heartbreak rather than stupid scenes with Alfrid).",1418774400,50,2929,4.649903288201161
