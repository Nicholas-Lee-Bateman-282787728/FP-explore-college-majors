8691615,1,B00QJLVHR4,Bad acting. Bad dialog/writing. Nothing original. Stereotypical.,1514073600,,64,8.285714285714286

8691618,5,B00QJLVHR4,"I always thought of this series to be more of a exploitive bed-hopping narrative.  This was what I saw from a distance(trailers), but never really watched the entire series.  It is more a window into the lives and loves of some very intense and emotional young men.  This series really carries the audience into an emotional level of these young men's lives. This very very difficult to explain verbally and can only be felt emotionally.  The actors in this series have left characterizations that few superlatives could even begin to adequately describe!  NJMJr!
PS:  I feverently wish to see many more seasons of wonderful tome, but alas it not to become a reality!!",1435363200,,668,4.867256637168142

8691620,2,B00QJLVHR4,Not the best acting. Stories were rather superficial as well.,1416960000,,61,5.2
8691621,3,B00QJLVHR4,"Acting could sometimes be better but overall not bad at all, even brilliant moments. Hopefully there will be another season because of the catastrophic end of season one.",1413158400,,170,5.107142857142857
8691622,5,B00QJLVHR4,After purchasing individual episodes they finally released the complete season! Alot of great guest stars. I look forward to Season 2!,1400716800,,134,5.428571428571429
8691623,4,B00QJLVHR4,"I watched this at a friends house...screening party.  Wow so many indie guests pop up, including Ian Roberts and Bruce Hart both who starred in Saltwater (?) I think that's the title.  Also Windham Beacham who was in the film LTR looking quite dapper in his scenes (I thought he had retired).  I am an especial fan of Bruce Hart because he does the evil characters so well--he's also doing a web series about gay characters playing another meany.  Thumbs up to the main cast who seem to gamely handle all of the drama that gets thrown their way--and I do mean ""drama"".  And a shout out to Eric Dean who always is a class act.  LOL.",1399852800,3,631,4.35042735042735
