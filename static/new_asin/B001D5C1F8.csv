3526098,4,B001D5C1F8,"I had not actually watched much of this series, when it was on. I purchased it because the price was right and it's excellent. I do wince, though, at Brian Keiths age; he looks more like the children's grandfather, not their uncle. Nevertheless, the acting and the writing are first rate. Sebastion Cabot is great, I recommend this as a good buy. You will laugh, you will cry, but, you will enjoy it.",1252800000,4,400,4.493150684931507
3526099,4,B001D5C1F8,"I ordered this set as a 'time-filler' for recuperation after surgery. As a child of the 60s, it did not disappoint. Granted, it takes very little to amuse me, but it is a wonderful trip down memory lane! Warning: the theme music might start to drive you crazy....",1252713600,17,263,4.5
3526100,5,B001D5C1F8,"When it comes to old television shows, particularly family comedies, people are quick to jump to generalizations: childish, simple, one-dimensional, unrealistic are terms which come to mind. However, while on it's surface, ""Family Affair"" appears as just another late 60's family sitcom, there are some important distinctions which set it apart it from other family comedies such as ""Leave it to Beaver"", ""Father Knows Best"", ""The Brady Bunch"", etc.  First, of all ""Family Affair"" plays more like a ""dramedy"" (comedy with dramatic elements) than a traditional sitcom. In fact, there are very few comedic elements in some episodes, but always a very clear story arc.  The next issue is the matter of how the twins and Cissy, come to live with Uncle Bill.  The writers make it very clear that both parents were killed in an accident. Unlike ""The Brady Bunch"" where we know both parents are widowed, but there is never any detail regarding how the families actually come together (with all due respect to the theme song); in the first episodes of ""Family Affair"" the writers not only take a surprising amount of time to convey that the parents were killed, but also to share with the audience the difficulty the twins had adjusting to life as they were bounced from one family member to the next, often separated from their older sister, Cissy. In fact, in one early episode, Buffy runs away because she feels that Uncle Bill will also abandon them.  Next, ""Family Affair"" distinguishes itself because of the progressive and sophisticated nature of the main characters who explore relationships with indivdiuals across a diversity of backgrounds. In one episode Uncle Bill helps an African American gentlemen in his gym with the concerns he is having with his young son. In another episode the twins befriend a young girl with a disability who as the storyline implies, dies near the end of the episode. This was pretty daring for a family sitcom.  In another episode, the family hosts the financee of a Chinese gentleman, whose bride-to-be comes from China and speaks little English and knows little about American culture. In a surprising twist, the episode ends with the couple not getting married, and going their separate ways. In another episode, Buffy befriends a young girl from an impoverished background, and as the story goes, we learn that poor people can be also be classist.  ""Family Affair"" is well-written, well produced, and very entertaining. If you remember this show as a child, you should consider seeing it again as you may have missed some of the subtle themes. If you've never seen ""Family Affair"" before you may be surprised at what you're missing.",1242691200,83,2670,4.975336322869955

3526104,5,B001D5C1F8,"And its been a long overdue.  Uncle Bill, Mr. French, Buffy, Jody, Cissy & Mrs. Beasley in crisp, fresh prints & on DVD for those of us who enjoy nostalgia (baby boomers, if you will) & a whole generation of new fans to enjoy.

Why Family Affair never got the exposure the Brady Bunch did & others of this period, will continue to astound me, as this is indeed a classic of its kind & in my opinion far superior to other silly '60s shows like The Brady Bunch & The Partridge Family, which were also family sitcoms of this particular genre.

Overall, Family Affair still holds up well after all these years, so if this isn't a perfect example of a fine classic that stands the test of time, I don't know what is.",1227398400,33,711,4.2518518518518515

3526131,5,B001D5C1F8,"""FAMILY AFFAIR"" was one of the most impressive,warm,and mildly,but heart felt sitcoms of its time,that was truly Family oriented
and powerful,leaving the viewer with a strong sense of value! Brian Keith playing a batchelor,who reluctantly chooses to take care of
three children,including a Teenager (Kathy Garver) gives an extremely superior preformance as a man,who later comes to love and care for these children,and with an adult and inteligent manner,that is just very rare,in sitcoms of its time! the late Anissa Jones,as
""Buffy"",was such a wonderful charecter,that just steals your heart,as with her twin brother ""Jody"",played by Johnnie Whitaker,an outstanding child star of his time,who was the best! ironicly,both Keith and Whitaker also co-starred in ""THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING! THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING!"" in 1966 for Mirisch/United Artists,which was another superb accomplishment! but with
""FAMILY AFFAIR"",the viewers got a strong dose of an involving sitcom,with mild drama,and outstanding preformers! i'd personally recommend this 1966-1971 TV series to really serious TV viewers,who valued what great Family entertainment was all about-and
this former CBS show,just delivers very strongly! acceptional support from the late,great Sabastian Cabot,who played the Butler ""Mr French"",that gave this show the class,that it deserves! another milestone from executive producer Don Fedderson,known for his other TV classic,""MY THREE SONS"".",1412640000,,1442,5.9375

3526146,5,B001D5C1F8,"Family Affair started airing shortly before I was born and stopped airing before my 5th birthday. It was one of the few shows I really liked as a toddler/preschooler: the whole family got along well, even in questionable events, the characters were memorable and well-thought-out. Jody was the kind of boy that other boys could like having around and Buffy was downright adorable (she was my first celebrity crush).

This show was one of the first to touch upon the concept of non-conventional family-units: death of two parents, divided orphans, a socially-keen bachelor uncle who reunited the children at the cost of his own lifestyle and a 'gentleman's gentleman' who added gentility with a touch of culture, which even the three midwestern-born-and-raised kids could embrace. The storyline was of good moral value without getting preachy or sectarian, the humor was clean and the subject matter was never over- or underdriven. Many issues which were taboo for the show's day were tackled with candor, clarity & dignity while still remaining relevant to viewers of all ages.

Would I recommend it? By all means. Family Affair was a pioneering show in the early days of television and few other shows have come close to matching it for all-around effectiveness & appeal, in spite of its 30-minute format.",1381881600,7,1306,5.069767441860465

The e-mail was unsigned except for the signature ""webmaster.""  How unprofessional.  How do I know I will get anything back?

3526152,5,B001D5C1F8,"Watch this and then compare it to today's sitcoms and dramadies and reality shows. As time goes by, the more I question the value of portraying gritty reality. These shows show you a world that you're already thoroughly acquainted with, a world that almost always leaves you feeling frustrated, unsatisfied, and hopeless. And these shows make you feel frustrated, unsatisfied, and hopeless.

What if you were to look at the so-called wholesome shows as a call to hold yourself to higher standards, behavior-wise, attitude-wise, and otherwise? People scoff at stuff like Family Affair. But try and hold yourself to the same standards for more than two or three days. Good luck with it. Is this the real reason why people knock these types of shows? Would it just take too much damn effort? Or are they fearful that it would leave them too vulnerable? People knock Family Affair for having a strong fantasy element. Don't they really mean that they believe the behavioral standards are unattainable?

3526156,5,B001D5C1F8,"Buying the complete series of Family Affair was the best thing I ever did.  I remember watching it as a child but did not remember the episodes and I was very young. I bought the series to relive the memories of a wonderful time. They took me back to a time when things seemed much better in the world and people more civilized. While I am sure there must have been difficulites in the world back then, as well as now, for a while we are transported to a refuge from everything. Though the series opened up with serious issues with the children being orphans and some serious storylines, they really touch the heart. The episodes deal with real isuses and are wonderful for young children to watch. Buffy and Jody are simply adoralble and hillarious! I found myself with pain in my cheeks realizing it was from the constant smile on my face. It is like I am watching them for the first time and as an adult but still with the heart of a child. I truly value this series and realize what an amazing show it was, and is, since it can easily be enjoyed by children and adults today. The emotions are as basic and true today because we all feel the same things inside. What a joy, what a treasure, and what a blessing to have had these shows growing up. They were so well made, simple but classic quality shows. I am so happy I own them. They have brought me tears of heart felt emotions, tears of joy and laughter! I am so happy I bought them. I will treasure them forever!

3526165,5,B001D5C1F8,"I do not hesitate to recommend this complete series to anyone who enjoys classic tv shows.  In the very first two shows, you will fall in love with all five characters:  Uncle Bill, Mr. French, Buffy, Jody and Cissy.  Then you're hooked.  Although they are a non-traditional family, the episodes focus on the love that binds them together through every situation.  Their love and consideration for each other - that's what makes them a family.  More of a family and quality show than so much of the trash that's on tv today.  It's not exactly a comedy.  There is a mix of sad, funny and sweet, so there's drama AND comedy.  Uncle Bill experiences the drama with a teenage niece that parents experience with their children, not to mention the antics of Buffy and Jody and the growing adoration between Mr. French and the children.  There's always a happy ending, but isn't that what we love to see?  After watching the complete series, I am ready to watch it again.  The DVDs are crystal clear, the color is great, and at the end of each season, there is bonus material with Kathy Garver and other actors and actresses who guest-starred on the show.  It's fun to see the furnishings and fashion of the day, not to mention rotary phones and transistor radios!  No cell phones!  Even if you're an adult, as I am, don't hesitate to purchase this wonderful series.  It's great for adults and kids alike.  Very relaxing to watch!",1345852800,5,1423,4.605577689243028

3526173,5,B001D5C1F8,"I remember Family Affair from when I was a child.  Anissa Jones, (Buffy), we are the same age, had she lived.

It does make me sad to think that only Kathy Garver and Johnnie Whitaker are still alive.  The way Brian Keith, Sebastian Cabot, and Aniss Jones died makes me sad.

I do love the simple stories of Family Affair, how close Buffy and Jodie were.  I never had a brother, just 2 older sisters, who I was never close to.

I do have all 5 seasons, and do wish the show wasn't cancelled, because the last show doesn't seem like a last show to me.

I liked how Brian Keith and Sebastian Cabot, how the show showed their evolution from being bachelors to being such great caregivers of 3 children, who really needed a loving family, just like everyone needs and deserves to have.

I find the more stressful my life becomes, the more I gravitate to these kinds of wholesome shows.

Iam just so happy to have them available for purchase on dvd.

I actually started at the beginning, watched the first dvd in order, and went on from there.

Some shows really stuck in my mind from when I was a child, and some I didn't remember, so it was nice to see them for what seemed like for the first time.

I think this would be a great dvd collection for parents and children to watch together, or for people like me who are nostalgic to see a show they remember from when they were a child, and see it from a new perspective.

It's wierd, but I find that as an adult I still like some of the shows I enjoyed as a child.  Maybe people never grow up, totally.  For someone like me who never really had a childhood, I find that refreshing, if a bit odd.

It's kind of sad to me with all the cable channels we have on tv today, that there is really very little great programming on tv, or any original story lines.  I always prefer a good story over anything else.

I hope if you do buy Family Affair on dvd, that you will enjoy it as much as I did, and still do.",1302739200,52,1951,4.1436170212765955

3526182,5,B001D5C1F8,"This is a wonderful trip down memory lane. Uncle Bill, Mr. French, Cissy, Buffy, Jody, and Mrs. Beasley are all there in the 5 season series. What's marvelous is that most of it was filmed on Sound Stage 10 at CSB Studio City. The trick was that some of the insert shots are on-location stock footage to set the place they're supposed to be. Studio backlots provided the settings of Spain and Tahiti. What's also most fascinating are some of the extras on the last disc of each season. Oddly only Part 1 of Johnny Whitaker's interview is part of Season 4. There is no Part 2 on Season 5 disc. Some of the information in the interviews is inaccurate. Sebastian Cabot was born in England and later moved to Canada. Some of the cast seems to think he was actually a Canadian playing a Brit. But these are all minor compared to the heartwarming lessons displayed in the series. You certainly won't be disappointed in owning this set.",1265068800,20,929,4.502958579881657
