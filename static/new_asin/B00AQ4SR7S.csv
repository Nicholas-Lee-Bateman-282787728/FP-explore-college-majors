8555970,5,B00AQ4SR7S,It was a great DVD I especially liked the part where Alina(Masha's voice) was shown singing the songs that were used in the DVD also the Christmas songs. The only problem my DVD player was not compatable with the DVD.,1364256000,,217,4.45
8555971,5,B00AQ4SR7S,We were trying to get several programs form Masha and the Bear and got tired of playing one by one through Youtube. We will be more than happy to keep purshasing more DVD's of this ADORABLE series.  Most importantly if your kids don't know Russian is not even needed... wonderful and unique animation.,1363564800,,301,4.679245283018868
