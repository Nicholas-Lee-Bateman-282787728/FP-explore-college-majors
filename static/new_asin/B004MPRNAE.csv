4432464,5,B004MPRNAE,"OMG! Thank u Lionsgate!! I am forever grateful that ur releasing the rest of the show! This is my fav show in the whole entire world! I was worried that the rest of the seasons would never come out. U have made BMW fans, dreams come true! Some of my fav epsiodes in this season r prom & graduation. I remember when Cory & Shawn begin the 1st day of senior yr. They have a fantasy of what their senior yr will be like. (Pretty girls & massages) I was bummed when Cory & Topanga broke up :( I  when they make up on the jungle gym. I also laughed when Eric & Jack met 4 the 1st time. Eric & Jack: ""Favorite color on 3... 1,2,3 Blue!"" Eric: ""I don't like him."" I laughed when Eric is styding 4 an exam & begins seeing Mr. Feeny everywhere :) This is also the season where Eric convinces Jack 2 start a fake fraternity. I remember when Shawn tells Cory that Topanga went out w/ another guy. Cory says to him ""So, your throwing in the towel?"" Shawn tells him it's over, and Cory says he's the only one who still knows it's not. Cory & Topanga go through their ups and downs this season, but in the end find their way back 2 . U can feel the passion that they have 4 each other. No guy or girl could ever come between them. I was exstatic & a little stunned when Topanga proposes 2 Cory. I guess u could say, I felt a little like Cory did, when he heard the question. I  the addition of new characters like Angela & Jack. I always felt that Shawn needed a love interest 2. I wanted 2 see Shawn happy. I remember he finds a lost bag with items in it. He falls in  w/ the mystery owner of the bag. He is all giddy & can't contain his feelings. This is when he realizes Angela is the one 4 him.

*One request Lionsgate- Can u pls add bonus features! We would love 2 see what the cast is up 2, & relive our fav moments from the show. Maybe u could have another quiz like earlier seasons? Or some sort of game.

Overall, I would like to thank u again Lionsgate 4 brining this show back 2 life, & making our BMW dreams come true. U guys rock!! Maybe u could take over the rights 4 Clarissa Explains it all & release the rest of the seasons, as well as Who's the Boss. I would love 2 own the rest of the seasons :) That would be AMAZING! Could u also see a/b getting rights 2 Salute your Shorts, Hey Dude, & Roundhouse?",1299801600,3,2305,3.9697624190064795
4432465,5,B004MPRNAE,"This is one of my favorite shows  because I have learned so many positive things from mr feeny that what makes Disney channel shows back in those days great and how all of the shows is always at number 1,2 or 3 and not at #4 and below
the sad part is that Disney does not make any shows this no more",1299024000,,299,3.8225806451612905

4432469,5,B004MPRNAE,"I'm so stocked for the upcoming release of season 5!  Thank you Lionsgate!  Keep them coming!

The only thing that would make this (and future BMW) release better is more special features.",1297382400,8,188,4.8125
4432470,5,B004MPRNAE,"Fans rejoice, the fifth season is being released by Lionsgate!!! (Only Two More!!)

This is the last season set in high school and the last season before the show took a far swerve into the silly. Some love the sillier college episodes more for their humor other people liked the younger episodes that spoke more to relatable experiences. As for me, when I was younger I loved the sillier episodes, now that I'm older I love the episodes that remind me of being an adolescent (especially the earlier ones that deal with Corey and Topanga). That's besides the point though.

This season Shawn meets his previously absent half brother Jack (Matt Lawrence joins the cast), Eric finally attends college, Feeny has his hands full preparing Corey, Shawn and Topanga for graduation. Also this season Corey and Topanga face their greatest crisis in the course of the series when Lauren (Linda Cardellini) threatens to come between them and then they break up for several episodes. Then they face what may be their greatest moment when a special question is popped during the graduation ceremony. Then there is the prom episode where Corey and Topanga make a big decision and Amy has big news; Corey helps his heartache with some alcohol; Topanga thinks she may be able to love someone besides Corey; Corey and Eric both want more complete relationships with their father; Shawn gets a longterm girlfriend (and the show finally diversifies its cast) in the form of Angela; Corey tries to stop the world around him from changing when graduation nears.

On the sillier side we have an episode where Eric and Jack meet witches at Penbrook; a World War II flashback caused by Salem the Cat (TGIF fans will remember); the Valentine's Day episode where Shawn's previous girlfriends kidnap him; the horror movie parody guest starring short lived scream queen Jennifer Love-Hewitt; the one where a giant Eskimo gets in Shawn's way; a Real World spoof about Shawn, Jack and Eric living together; Eric goes to Hollywood and we see all the characters if they had very different personalities; the boys temporarily lose their girls to Nunzio and Sergio as we explore the differences (some stereotypical, some not) between men and women.

Other episodes find Shawn attending University classes without being enrolled, Shawn 'breaking up' with Corey when he feels they are headed down different paths and an episode where Topanga takes over Corey's family Christmas.

A bunch of fun episodes this season at any rate. Some tackling more serious issues and some having more over the top fun. Many of the episodes are spent on the Corey-Topanga relationship arc and overall most episodes are geared towards the characters preparing for life after high school.

Depending on what era of the series you enjoy this is either the last great set or the first of the ones you really want to own. Regardless I just wanna thank Lionagate for picking up the slack where Disney completely dropped the ball (Maybe you could try and release the final season and a half of Gargoyles too?). Four stars because I wish theses sets had the fun commentaries/special features that the first two had but Five stars for the series I grew up with.

*Also just wanted to ask what's up with the apparent orange box color? So Glad to have these seasons released but it looks almost the same as the third season box color as shown here. Odd, but no complaints here as long as its released.",1297382400,39,3437,4.844974446337308

4432494,5,B004MPRNAE,"The best season of boy meets world! This is the season were topanga proposed! But also broke up because of another girl named Lauren, it all started when the gang were going to a ski lodge to spend a couple of day, but Cory ended up spraining his ankle, so he told topanga and his friend to along with out him to go ski, he meets this girl named Lauren. Cory and Lauren proceeds to talk all night and even get kissed by her. Shawn wakes up and tell Cory his leg is feeling better and he stood up all night talking to lauren, then lies to topanga about his ankle, just so he can stay at the lodge, and talk to lauren. On departure from the lodge Cory  get a letter from Lauren, telling him how she feels! cory drops it, topanga finds it, next day tells Angela about it! She proceed to open and Topanga reads it and she tell Cory to see if he have feeling for Lauren buy going out with her, but topanga break up with him because he was testing his love for her, to make a long story short! And another thing in this season confused the the hell out of me. The episode were Shawn and Cory weren't friends anymore and they went to see Mr feeny, and they had this flash back were they were kid and Cory and topanga were already dating, and before the flashback Shawn said you guys have been together beford him and Cory were best friends, and they say they been together for 17 years, but in the first two season they weren't dating, knowing that they only been dating for 2 years the didn't become boyfriend and girlfriend until season 3.

4432527,5,B004MPRNAE,"Ive been saying all along that I started Boy Meets World late in its run.  Well, that was almost all of the way through season 5.  Its so much fun to see the episodes I remember again and even get a few jokes in context I missed the first time around.  And the fun is definitely continuing overall even if the show is beginning to get weirder.

Season 5 finds us at the senior year of the main trio of Cory Matthews (Ben Savage), Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong), and Topanga Lawrence (Danielle Fishel).  And what a senior year it turns out to be.  Shawn is reunited with his long lost half-brother Jack (new cast member Matthew Lawrence) and the brothers plus Corys older brother Eric (Will Friedle) get an apartment together.  Meanwhile, Shawn finally gets a steady girlfriend in Angelia (regular guest star Trina McGee).

And on the Cory and Topanga front, the two hit a major rough patch when Cory meets Lauren (guest star Linda Cardellini) while on the senior ski trip.  This is the major storyline of the back half of the season as the two try to figure out what it might mean for their relationship.

And the rest of the cast?  Little sister Morgan (Lindsay Ridgeway) usually just pops in for a few jokes.  Corys parents Amy (Betsy Randle) and Alan (William Russ) make a huge discovery late in the season.  And Mr. Feeny (William Daniels), the only teacher the gang has this season, also has an announcement before the season is over.

Honestly, there are lots of good laughs this season.  The writers are sharp and the cast is in fine form, and they get laughs out of just about any material.  However, as I mentioned earlier, the stories can get a little crazy this year.  Take, for example, the Halloween episode, which finds Jack dating their very possessive new neighbor (guest star Candace Cameron Bure) who may or may not be a witch.  Just about any episode that focuses on Eric gets crazy, like his reaction to Feenys big news at the end of the episode.  On the other hand, his discovery of his Shakespeare acting ability and the resulting trip to Hollywood is very funny.  His word a day calendar episode is a hoot as well.

Then comes the episode that introduced me to the show.  Yes, I have a dark side, and it is for slasher films.  In a spoof on the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer craze, we get And Then There was Shawn, which finds the gang locked in school with a killer on the loose.  Its actually a very funny episode and still one of my favorites of the series.

And thats just it.  While the show may be a bit over the top, the characters are still great and the laughs are still strong.  Thats all Im truly looking for in a sitcom.  About the only episode that truly doesnt work for me is the one that flashes back to the 40s, but Ill forgive the writers for that since it was pretty much forced on them by the time travel cross promotion idea for TGIF.

And yes, the show can also pin point real emotion, like in Torn Between Two Lovers (Feeling Like a Fool).  Even though I knew the outcome of the arc, I still teared up watching it.  And listen for the audience reaction.  It actually adds to the power of the episode.

On the other hand, the show is still willing to mock itself at times.  This is never more obvious than in the season finale.  I enjoyed that episode much more this time around than I did previously because I got all of the jokes.

Like last season, we just get the episodes themselves in this three disc set.  However, all 24 episodes are here in their original full frame and stereo sound.

While the show may be sliding more toward the absurd, Boy Meets World still packs the laughs into season 5.  Whether new to the show or a longtime fan, you're sure to enjoy the episodes presented here.",1441584000,,3750,4.37192474674385

4432546,5,B004MPRNAE,"Season Five of Boy Meets World could be best described as a year of transition. Much of the character and life lessons that made what I consider to be the core of Boy Meets World Seasons 2-4 is still here in such episodes as Corey the Eskimo, Everything Changes, and Raging Cory among others. But we do have some fairly sillier ones such as the teen horror spoof, the Halloween themed witches episode, and that kind of bizarre time traveling one. The silly would seem to be ramped up during the college years, but here I thought it was a nice mix of serious and silly.

I lean more towards the serious episodes that were outlined above because they speak to me in a more meaningful way both as someone having lived through high school and even today in my late twenties is struggling with the idea that the only thing that endures is change and that everything truly is possible. That being said, you need the silly episodes to balance out the thought provoking moments. I think thats where Boy Meets World is different than any show Ive seen recently in that yes you can laugh and be silly, but yet there are also plenty of opportunities to have a deep, meaningful soul-searching moment.

It may be a year of transition for Boy Meets World, but it is still a winner in my eyes.",1431216000,2,1278,4.43404255319149

First off, we get the introduction of Jack- who I absolute LOVE! I love how we get to see more of Shawn's family on a more permanent basis including his father Chet. The season premiere was such an awesome start to the season. Also, we finally get fan's favorite, Shawn and Angela this season. They are so freaking cute together! :) This season we also got the storyline of Lauren. I personally adore her and Cory together and honestly thought that he should have nixed Topanga and gotten with Lauren because they are SO PRECIOUS! together (I love the scene when they're outside and they're fooling around in the rain; and when Lauren kisses him). - Moving on, my fav episode, def in my Top 5, has to be ""And Then There Was Shawn."" - I had never watched this show regularly when it was on cable and so I got caught up on this show on DVD, and OMG! I have never laughed as hard as I did watching this episode. It was hilarious! And I laugh and get the same bellyaches each and every time I watch it.
