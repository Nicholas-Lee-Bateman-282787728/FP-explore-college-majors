8316557,5,B001KZ66DO,"a classic film that i have been searching for some 26 years.

It was produced about the same time as i was a young soldier and the story line has very similar outcomes to my career at the time.

Superb service and delivery thanks for getting me some serious memories

Super service from a very quick seller too as this came from USA in less time than a first class letter in the UK!!!  I would definitely buy from this seller again.
