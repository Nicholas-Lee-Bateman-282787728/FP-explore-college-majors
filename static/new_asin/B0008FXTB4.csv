2258755,4,B0008FXTB4,"John Travolta, Vince Vaughn, Uma Thurman, Cedric the Entertainer, Danny DeVito, and The Rock are just a few of the stars in this comedy sequel to Get Shorty.  This time, gangster Chili Palmer leaves the movie business for the music industry where he ends up promoting a struggling singer, pursued by the Russian mafia.  Uma Thurman and John Travolta's last collaboration (Pulp Fiction) was a great success.  Add music, singing, dancing, gangster, and over-the-top performances from Vince Vaughn and The Rock, then you have a movie that is filled with entertainment, action, and comedy.  With this cast and the right amount of silliness, not too much as in Get Shorty, this might be the blockbuster of the week.  With a cast of action star heavies like Travolta, Thurman, Vaughn, and The Rock, we have a good bet that there will be more action with a good sense of humor.",1104624000,15,870,4.8120805369127515
2258756,5,B0008FXTB4,"Just in case you don't know, Be Cool is the sequel to the 1995 Get Shorty. I just saw the teaser poster, and it looked awesome! Everbody is back! including John Travolta and Danny Devito. I'm gonna see it opening night!; on february 22nd, they'll release a special edition dvd of Get Shorty.

2258759,2,B0008FXTB4,"So many big names! And it has the Russian Mafia! So what's not to like??
Well, the main character (John Travolta) is never truly threatened and never has any sort of interesting hero's crisis.
And without any sort of struggle or difficulty or setback, it sucked all the juice out of watching Travolta float effortlessly through this film that sadly was flat-lining and bed-ridden almost the entire second half.
If you go all starry-eyed seeing a bunch of celebrities all in one film, then you might like this.
If you are looking for a riveting and suspenseful thriller, well there is none. The Thrill has left the building!",1497830400,2,623,4.777777777777778

2258921,3,B0008FXTB4,"The book was much better.  The film lost Elmore Leonard's edge.  I think the reason is that it tried to be politically correct.  Leonard lampooned all the bad guys--which was really every character--and the record industry.  The film makes Chili and Edie good characters, introduces Aerosmith, says nothing about the record industry, and, most importantly, turns the rappers into menacing but ultimately good characters.  It also uses a black character for the aspiring singer.  I think that the film couldn't bring itself to allow black and gay characters to be as evil as Leonard wrote them.

2259007,4,B0008FXTB4,"Be Cool (2005)

 Cool as a cucumber mobster Chili Palmer is back.  In Get Shorty the calm, clever crook took on the movie business and won.  Now he (and actor John Travolta) is back taking a run at the music business.  Thugs, bullies and bad guys beware, Chili Palmer knows what's what and he can dish out what you're cooking faster than you can serve it.
 The fast paced, fast talking script by Peter Steinfeld (who also scripted the very smart, very entertaining 21) follows the original tale by novelist Elmore Leonard, as did Get Shorty.
 Director F. Gary Gray we know from his most excellent The Italian Job of 2003.  He keeps things moving right along without us knowing he is even there.  Not all directors are so generous. Gray just delivers the goods.
 Besides, the famous cast has us in stitches with their bits.  Besides Travolta and the always watchable and enjoyable Uma Thurman we have Vince Vaughn playing someone other than Vince Vaughn, which is as remarkable as it is refreshing.  Cerdric the Entertainer, Andre Benjamin and Steven Tyler-yes that one, Liv Tyler's rocker dad-and Harvey Keitel also appear.  But, wait, that's not all.  Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays a gay guy that will crack you right up.  Danny DeVityo and James Woods have supporting roles.  Gene Simmons (the film is about the music business) and
Anna Nicole Smith are also on board.  Smith died in tragic circumstances two years after the movie opened.  Joe Perry (Aerosmith) and RZA, actor and musician (Wu-Tang Clan) round out the famous folk featured in the film.  Not famous Christina Millian is perky, sexy and sings great as the young entertainer Linda Moon.
 This three and a half saw blade film carries a PG-13 rating but be warned, it is loaded with foul language and adult conversations.  In runs one hour and 18 minutes.  World wide gross was a disappointing $95 million on a budget of $53 million.",1427155200,,1899,4.743119266055046

2259058,4,B0008FXTB4,"With the success of the 1990 Elmore Leonard novel and the 1995 film ""Get Shorty"", there was no doubt that Leonard's sequel would be made.

With many of Leonard's stories being made to films from ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""The Tall T"" and the TV series ""Justified"", the gangster film ""Get Shorty"" was a box office success and also received nominations in the American Film Institute's ""AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs"" but also ""AFI's  10 Top 10'.

To preface a little about what ""Get Shorty"" was all about, the film focused on a Miami Loan Shark named Chili Palmer (played by John Travolta) who clashes with another mobster. In the film, Palmer meets with an actor named Martin Weir (played by Danny DeVito) to star in his life story.  In the film, Palmer is supposed to collect a lot of money but because of his movie ambitions, people want their money back and end up pursuing each other.

This now leads to ""Be Cool"", a comedy film produced by Danny De Vito and directed by F. Gary Gray (""The Italian Job"", ""Law Abiding Citizen"", ""The Negotiator"", ""Friday"") and a loosely based screenplay adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel by Peter Steinfeld (""21', ""Analyze That"", ""Drowning Mona"").

VIDEO:

""Be Cool"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:40:1).  Picture quality for the film is absolutely vibrant.  There are plenty of colors seen through the film but also detail galore.  Skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep.  I didn't notice any blemishes, artifacting or any problems with the film whatsoever.  The film looks great on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Be Cool"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Dolby Surround and French 5.1 DTS HD.  While the film is dialogue-driven, it's also musically driven and from scenes with Linda Moon singing, to ambiance of hip-hop playing in Dabu and friend's Humvee's, Aerosmith playing live in concert to the Black Eyed Peas playing at club, music is what envelops the soundscape and utilizes the surround channels.

There are action sequences with gun shots or an aluminum bat coming into play and other ambiance as Chili and Edie going to a Lakers games but the film will be recognized for its music soundtrack and there is plenty of music being played throughout the film.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Be Cool"" comes with the following special features:

  Be Cool, Very Cool Making-Of Documentary - (21:36) Making of the film and cast talking about the various characters in the film and how cool Chili Palmer is throughout the film.

  John and Uma's Dance Sequence - (3:35) The making of the dance sequence of Chili and Edie.
  Close Up: The Rock - (6:01) Director F. Gary Gray talks about casting The Rock as the gay Elliot Wilhelm.

  Theatrical Trailer - (2:03) The theatrical trailer for ""Be Cool"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

When ""Be Cool"" came out in theaters back  in 2005, I figured that it would be the 10th anniversary of ""Get Shorty"" and it would be a pretty dark, comedy about Chili Palmer and the world he lives in.

""Be Cool"" turned out to be a comedy which features plenty of stars, many cameos and a storyline that is fun but nowhere near the quality of its predecessor.

If there is one thing that the film does right, it's the fact that Chili Palmer retains his cool from beginning to end, he is unfazed.  But then the film tries to incorporate so many stars that it tries to capture the Hollywood and Los Angeles lifestyle and like many other films which tries to incorporate a plethora of stars, it becomes the film's focus and sure, it may work for some people but for those who are familiar with ""Get Shorty"", especially those who are familiar with Elmore Leonard's novel of ""Be Cool"", the film becomes less about Chili Palmer and more about everyone else.

We have Vince Vaughn playing a white guy who talks Black, the Rock playing a gay bodyguard who is sensitive of people calling him a queer and yet singing in a silk cowboy outfit ""You Ain't Woman Enough to Take My Man"", you have the Black Eyed Peas in the film to provide Chili and Edie's dance theme (which does not achieve the same or similar efficacy as their dance scene in ""Pulp Fiction"") and characters after characters that are thrown in to the mix to make the film more appealing and cool to different audiences but in the long run, it just doesn't work.

And now the good news...what I mentioned above, could also be the positive for many viewers.  Forget ""Get Shorty"" and look at this film as a popcorn comedy film with a lot of talent and stars.  Heck, there is so much music being played in the film, the filmmakers even manage to pull of filming scenes during an actual Los Angeles Lakers game.

And for me, compared to other films that try to throw in a lot of stars like ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" or ""Valentine's Day"" that were not that great, ""Be Cool"" is a much more entertaining film.

When you think about it, you Travolta playing a cool character, Uma Thurman looking fantastic, Cedric the Entertainer as bad boy, The Rock as a gay man and Vince Vaughn trying to be Black, that makes for a fun comedy.  Not a great film but a good popcorn comedy film.

And its important to note that anyone who hasn't seen ""Get Shorty"" can easily get into this film.  Watching the original film is not essential but if you do, you'll see how the original is much better than this sequel.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture and audio quality were pretty solid for this catalog release and the film has a good number of special features as well.

Overall, ""Be Cool"" comes nowhere close to the efficacy of ""Get Shorty"" but it does manage to feature plenty of stars, plenty of music and in the end, makes for a fun popcorn comedy film on Blu-ray.",1312243200,3,6508,4.576490924805531

2259064,4,B0008FXTB4,"Does no one get that this move is pure satire?  The filmakers and all the ""gang"" are making pretty good fun of everyone, every type in the movie and music business and it is very funny.  This is an indictment of both the movie industry and the music biz. Satire writ large and in flaming neon letters,towering billboard sized and in your face!

If you are a movie lover and you don't like anything else about this film, you must see it for the performances of Andre Benjamin,Vince Vaughn, and Cederic the Entertainer. My husband thinks I am easily amused but if these performances don't crack you up you are no lover of the ridiculous, of the inventive slapstick tradition of the entertainment world. For example The Rock singing Loreatta Lynn's big hit,  You're Not Woman Enough to Take My Man; Vince Vaughn's ""twinkle, twinkle"" speech by itself is worth buying this movie for; BE COOL should have made Andre Benjamin a BIG star--I fell totally in love with him and wanted to see more of him. Cedrik the Entertainer's speech to the Russian gangster in the office of Carr-o-sell records is totally worth the price of admission as is the scene of Cedric beating a DJ with a pancake turner because the DJ won't play the record he is promoting.

As always Travolta, Thurman and Kietel are great--they are wonderful to watch, as are cameos by Danny DeVito and Robert Pastorelli.  Yes, the plot is a bit out there, but who cares?  This film is fun, it's shot in LA, it's an insiders movie with lots of insider movie and music jokes, and a music cameos by the Black-Eyed Peas and Sergio Mendez,AND Steven Tyler and Aerosmith--good grief, by the DVD!!

From the recording studio to an Aerosmith concert to the MTV Music Awards, he manipulates events to watch them play out the Chili way, using his signature blend of wiseguy skills and negotiation tactics. It's a dangerous business, and everyone's looking for their next big hit. Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy.",1263600000,,616,5.295918367346939

They could have salvaged the flick by having more of sexy Christine Millian as a super hoochie or bitchy vixen in patent leather, at least get a thrill with her.

2259068,2,B0008FXTB4,"This is the first negative review I have ever put up on amazon but when you consider the tremendous acting talent, source material and the excellent first installment of this series it is truly an achievement to come up with such a boring, unfunny movie as Be Cool.

When watching this film I get the feeling that any other director would have done so much better.

Gray seems to have no concept at all of pacing or flow.  Scenes drag on way too long (i.e. the Linda Moon/Aerosmith song..did we REALLY have to see the entire song..how about just a snippet),  unfunny recurring jokes (russian guy getting punched in the eye) are employed and great actors like Harvey Keitel are completely underutilized.]

The Vince Vaughn and Rock characters are unfunny and cringe inducing and Linda Moon's singing is so generic sounding that it is hard to believe that she would ever get a second look much less play on stage with Aerosmith.

If this film reflects Gray's vision then he is  truly a shallow and uninteresting person.

Lousy movie",1256947200,,1030,4.715083798882682
2259069,3,B0008FXTB4,"You know there's something not quite right with a movie when it boasts actors the calibre of John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, James Woods, and Vince Vaughan....yet the most memorable roles are those by ex-wrestler The Rock and singer Andre-3000. Unfortunately, despite its cast, 'Be Cool' ends up being much less than the some of its parts.

In this sort-of-sequel to 'Get Shorty', we follow Chili Palmer moving out of the movie business and into the music industry. What follows is a convoluted plot involving Russian mobsters, a widowed record company owner, try-hard gangstas, a promising young singer, gay bodyguards, and a Vanilla Ice-like white boy who acts black.

Many people bag the performances of the main cast, especailly Travolta and Thurman. It's true they do phone in their efforts for this movie, but the script doesn't really give them alot of material to work with. In fact, despite all the characters and confusion, the central story is quite simple and not really that interesting. It is mostly the side plots and minor characters, not the central players, that are more entertaining.

The bigger problem with this movie is that, for a comedy, it's not really that funny. It relies very heavily on ""irony"" and in-jokes that too often fall flat. For example, Aerosmith singer Steve Tyler (in one of the most cringeworthy cameos ever seen) proclaims ""I'm not one of those singers who appear in movies!"". Geddit??? He's a singer, and he's appearing in a movie, claiming he doesn't appear in movies. Yep, this is the sort of thing you're forced to suffer through in the name of ""humour"".

However, the interactions between Raji (Vaughan) and his gay Samoan bodyguard and wannabe singer (The Rock) are hilarious. The humour here is much more slapstick and off-the-cuff, particularly The Rock's ""monologue"" and his music video. Andre-3000 as a tea-drinking gangsta and Robert Pastoerlli as a bumbling hit-man are other highlights. If only they'd put in a bit more of this sort of stuff rather than the heavy-handed pop culture references, this would have been a better film.",1256169600,,2098,5.0201149425287355
2259070,4,B0008FXTB4,"I usually review movies in a certain way, but for this one, I'm just gonna get right down to why I think this movie is pretty darn good. I was actually shocked to see it rated as low as it is. I know it's a sequel to Get Shorty (which I remember being good...but I just can't remember it), but it honestly feels like its own movie. It feels like it has almost nothing to do with its predecessor. I'm going to actually tell you 10 reasons why I like it.

1. John Travolta plays Chili Palmer perfectly. I love how he's a smooth tough guy with a brain. He gets just about anything he wants, and can totally out play anyone by reading who they are perfectly.
2. Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson is hilarious. I've liked Dwayne since he was The Rock on WWF. He was always funny, even when he was supposed to be on the bad guy side. You couldn't help like his cocky demeanor. Here though, he plays a tough guy (supposedly) body guard for Raji. Oh and he's gay. He loves looking good and loves acting and singing.
3. Vince Vaughn is amazing as the music manager Raji, a white guy who acts and dresses in a black guy pimpish kind of way. Hearing him talk is priceless. I love when he starts talking like he's a bad mutha, but then quickly backs down when confronted.
4. Cedric the Entertainer plays Sin LaSalle, a music recorder/mixer. A very educated black man, that is great at what he does. I love the fact that the first time you see him, he's acting more like some goofy rich white dude. Then you see his crew role up in hummers with spinners and loud music, and guns stuck in their very low riding jeans, and you know how he truly is. He's a gangsta in sheep's clothing.
5. Andre (from the rap group Outkast) is Sin's cousin, Dabu. He's a straight up thug, who always loud and just wants to kill someone and doesn't care who. At first he was kind of annoying, but I was wrong, he's funny.
6. Stereotyping is rampant in this movie. I don't like racism, but I do think jokes about stereotypes are funny. Which is why I think Carlos Mencia can be funny, as well as Dave Chappell who I think is a comedic genius. Even Chris Rock. Those guys know how to spread it around, to make you feel like you are not being singled out. That's kind of how this movie makes me feel.
7. The story itself, even with some definite holes, is a lot of fun. Watching how the back stabbings unfold is great. Especially when Raji gets called out by Sin. Hilarious.
8. Christina Milian is not a great actress, but she sure doesn't hurt my eyes.
9. This list isn't going to make it to 10 things.
10. Did I mention Vince Vaughn and the Rock? Seriously, they were amazing in every scene they were in. I laughed hard a lot when they were on.

Though I really liked Be Cool, it sure wasn't perfect. Probably my biggest gripe was the god awful blatancy of the product placements. I don't know how many times we had to see the Honda Insight car or the T-Mobile Sidekick or all the other name drops in the movie to get it in our heads that they were in there. I laughed one time when the camera was slightly zoomed in on the back of the sidekick while somebody was texting someone. T-MOBILE SIDEKICK. Ugh... it was horrible.

So in the end, I really liked the movie. I don't even think of it as being a sequel to Get Shorty. I laughed a lot and am definitely glad I own this movie. Give it a try.

P.S. - I love when Raji and Elliot (The Rock) are talking about getting some chicken. I don't think they said the whole name, but you can tell they were talking about Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles...hehe. I've always wanted to eat there.",1242604800,,3590,4.213662790697675

2259077,3,B0008FXTB4,"This is the official sequel to the movie Get Shorty. I don't remember seeing it when I was younger, but if it was even a bit popular, I probably just forgot about it. Don't know the premise or anything, but I just finished watching this so I'll get into describing it a bit.

This movie at heart, is a comedy. There are over half a dozen scenes that try and get you to laugh. More or less, they succeed. Especially when Cedric The Entertainer beats a wary opponent with the spatula he just used to cook his lovely daughter some pancakes! There were many serious parts to it to which took me by surprise a little.

Linda Moon (the beautiful and somewhat talented Christina Milian) plays the tried and true starlet trying to make it in the music business. She has the pipes and she writes her own songs. You can't beat it really! John Travolta's character tries to get her signed to Uma Thurman's label. It takes a while (they find a mixer, try to get Linda's contract away from the ""snake"" of the movie and some of the plot takes place in between. Some of it mindless, some of it bearable.

Anyway, there are many, MANY well-known actors that play in this movie. You probably know them already, but I'm gonna regurgitate the main names:

Starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Danny Devito, Christina Milian (she's SOOOO pretty) Andre 3000 from Outkast, The Rock from WWF (right? I don't watch that rubbish. It's fake! >_>), Steven Tyler from Aerosmith (Pink is awesome), Cedric The Entertainer and Debi Mazar (whoever she is >_>).

This movie was directed by F. Gary Gray, who I know absolutely nothing about. But he helped create a mildly enjoyable film that's half comedy and half drama (I guess, not sure what else to call it!).

The white guy trying to be black had his moments, but was probably off-putting to some, hence the low 2.5 star rating the movie has at the moment. I think the movie overall was slightly better than that, but not by much.

Some of the music brought back memories (especially the song that was later ""sampled"" and made into that one song by Mase and others. You know the one! It came out in the mid 90s, I believe).

But the rap music in this movie (which there wasn't much of, Thank Goodness), minus the rap song at the end, was a different story; it royally sucked. There was one song where you just kept hearing the ""B-word"" over and over again, until you were ready to puke. It was very generic (yes, even more pointless than most ""rap"" you hear on the radio stations these days, and that's saying something. *looks at T-Pain* *pulls his own hair out at the travesty of the thought* I am no rap fan in the slightest and it must be said that the rap songs here were terrible. Mindless isn't descriptive enough.

This movie gets 3 stars from me. I can tolerate comedies to a certain point, but that's not all this was and I'm happy things turned out that way! =D

My two favorite scenes are first, where John and Uma's characters dance to the Black Eyed Peas song, which is my favorite by them, and is so underrated, Sexy, from their first CD that had Fergie on it, Elephunk. Fergie had a washboard stomach and made a short cameo with the other group members.

Half-heartedly recommended.

Pros:

John's character was very smooth. People pointed guns at him 2-3 times in the movie, and he managed to talk his way out of the situations all but one time.
Christina Milian sings her heart out. I also think that ""Believer"" was a song she wrote. She also makes for a very charismatic actress. She also sings, ""Crazy"" with Steven Tyler!
It's a comedy that has serious tones to it.
The Rock is SO hot in it! But sometimes he overdoes the gay act. >_>
Mild replayability.

Cons:

It's a comedy. >_>
Most of the rap songs are horrible.
Sometimes it's not all that funny.
The gay guy gets back stabbed. v_v

2259081,2,B0008FXTB4,"...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.

John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.

A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.

It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.

It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.

Watchable, but barely.

2259084,2,B0008FXTB4,"Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.

As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a ""star"" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of ""cool"" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.

The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.

2259086,1,B0008FXTB4,"The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, ""HEY, don't forget the book!""  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  ""Be Cool"" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.

A few laughs are provided.  A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature.  Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved.  Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clich.  The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the  brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot.

Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room.  Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug.  I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director.  Enough said there.

This one seems to be a parody of Hollywood and its fame machine, but is limpid in its portrait of that parody. It is also said to be a comedy but I cannot recall once laughing during this film.

This movie has one thing going for it: it is magnificently shot in wonderful lighting. Every scene makes the actors appear breathlessly beautiful. You can see every hair in its place (none are out of place) and every wrinkle is gone. These people look better than movie people have ever looked.

2259094,2,B0008FXTB4,"You can tell within the first two minutes that Be Cool isn't going to come close to living up to 1995's Get Shorty, which actually embodied the titular sentiment of this limp sequel. Director Gray and screenwriter Paul Steinfeld waste no time in winking at us, joking about how lame sequels are, and stupid compromises made to get a PG-13 rating. But instead of getting us to laugh, it only shows how desperate they are to please.

The plot has Travolta's hustler-turned-movie-producer Chili Palmer getting out of movies and into music when he discovers a talented young singer (Milian), teaming up with Edie (Thurman), a record executive's widow. Chili is beset by a colorful cast of lowlifes: Cedric the Entertainer and the Rock make the most of their roles, but Vince Vaughn is unbelievably grating as the white-guy-who-thinks-he's-black.

While Get Shorty had no trouble selling Chili's love of movies, his love of music comes across as contrived, designed only to pimp the acts (Aerosmith, Black Eyed Peas) who've been paid to show up. Memorable lines from Get Shorty are recycled ad nauseam, and Travolta and Thurman dance and try to re-create Pulp Fiction's magic. There are one or two funny lines and enough stars to guarantee everyone at least a moment of pleasure. But a moment is all you're likely to get.",1139788800,4,1316,4.923423423423423

2259096,3,B0008FXTB4,"It's amazing how, when we are channel-surfing and not finding anything on, just catching a movie right at the beginning is enough to make us stop and watch.  I had that experience with Be Cool the other night, and discovered that the movie wasn't quite as bad as I'd been led to believe.  Yes, I would have felt like I had wasted my money to watch it.  But for free?  It was actually pretty entertaining.

This sequel to Get Shorty (which I've never seen) has its ups and downs and is actually pretty ridiculous.  Writers Elmore Leonard (novel) and Peter Steinfeld (screenplay) add a bunch of silly concepts to enhance the comic factor.  Some of these are quite funny, others not so much.  Linda's current producer is Raji (Vince Vaughn), a white guy who's trying desperately to be black to enhance his street cred.  Vaughn's probably the funniest thing in the film as every word he utters makes him out to be a whiteboy trying to be a homeboy.  He's also a coward at heart, though he's not above a little violence if he thinks it's necessary.  He doesn't like the tables turned on him, though, and the confrontation in Nick Carr's (Harvey Keitel) office between all the various factions is hilarious partially because of Vaughn.

Be Cool coasts along on the charm of its leads, and Travolta tries very hard to deliver.  Unfortunately, often Travolta seems more detached than sure of himself.  It's obvious that Chili knows exactly what he's doing (sometimes being a bit too perfect), but Travolta goes that extra step as if he's a bit above the entire thing instead of immersed in it.  Then he gives that twisted smirk and everything's all right for the moment.  Uma Thurman is gorgeous and flighty, but every time Edie defers to Chili, she puts the lie to her statement at the beginning of the movie that she doesn't need any help.  I wish she would have been a bit stronger herself rather than relying on Chili all the time.

Other acting caveats have to go to Cedric the Entertainer and The Rock.  Cedric was fun to watch, and his reactions to Dabu were hilarious, as Dabu continuously does stupid and silly things.  Evidently, Dabu is his wife's cousin, and he promised her that he'd take care of him, so he has to put up with it.  When Dabu drinks tea at Edie's house, Cedric's reaction is great.  As for The Rock, he is perfectly against type and I thought he did a magnificent job with what he was given.  As Elliot Wilhelm, Raji's bodyguard and henchman, he is a remarkable discovery for those who have only seen him in action films.  And to think of a pro wrestler playing a gay actor trying to make it big with audition monologues from Bring It On is almost unimaginable without actually seeing it.

Unfortunately, there are some things that keep the movie from being a standout.  The musical sequences go on way too long and don't move the plot forward at all.  This is a comic caper flick, not a musical, people!  Three whole songs with not much happening in the background (other than reaction shots) just drag the film to a halt.  Surely they could have just played snippets?  And yes, it was kind of cool to see Aerosmith in concert, but if I really wanted to do that, I could rent one of their DVDs.  (As an aside, I thought Steven Tyler was great in this movie, proving his self-referential statement in the movie that he doesn't just do movies in order to do them.  He's actually pretty substantial.)

What's even worse is the Black-Eyed Peas song.  No, the song is great, but the sequence in the movie stinks.  Rather than being a true homage to Pulp Fiction, Thurman and Travolta dancing in this sequence just screams ""Look at us!  We got Travolta and Thurman to dance again!!  Fans of Pulp Fiction will love us!""  No, not really.  It's pointless and again wastes time.  This movie was almost two hours long, and it didn't need to be. Be Cool has long sequences where nothing much happens and nothing funny is going on.  The dance and the songs are the main culprits here, but there are other small scenes as well that don't move anything forward.

My final criticism is one exceptionally unrealistic turn of events.  Yes, the movie is over the top anyway so believability isn't paramount, but the fate of Nick Carr just screamed ""plot contrivance!""  This is especially true because he tried to pull the same stunt on Chili earlier in the movie.  I sincerely doubt that he's going to fall for it himself at the end.  But he does, and he's taken care of.  Ho hum.

Be Cool is certainly worth taking in at least once.  It's has many funny moments and I was entertained.  Don't expect anything breathtaking, and it may be right up your alley.  Whether my enjoyment of it is heightened because I didn't have Get Shorty to compare it to, I don't know.  But if you catch it on the movie channel, it's worth a watch.

Uma Thurman is beautiful, to be sure, but she's not in her prime like Rene Russo and Gene Hackman were in the original movie.  John Travolta's performance is, of course, spot-on.  It's like Leonard wrote the character of Chili Palmer for him.  No one else could pull of the gangster-smooth charm with old-school movie and music knowledge.

The sequel pays homage to the original in several scenes, namely Chili's renting of the ""Cadillac of hybrids"" and two scenes in which bad guys break in and alert the homeowners to their presence by turning the TV or stereo up.  For hardcore fans of Get Shorty, this is worth a viewing, but it isn't a masterpiece like the original.",1136764800,3,1403,4.620967741935484
2259100,2,B0008FXTB4,"When you have a movie like Get Shorty, base on the book by Elmore Leonard, and it is good, the first thing you want to do is capture the success of that and run with it.  Well...first off all, they took too long, and the zest that was the buzz for Get Shorty had already started to wan.  So they say . . . Hey, let's throw John Travolta & Uma Thurman together and they'll dance and it will be like a f*cking Pulp Fiction reunion and people will dig that.  No.  The problem inherent in Be Cool is that it tries way too hard to be funny.  Where Travolta's original Chilli Palmer was cool and smooth and likable...it's now just really f*cking annoying.  You wanna smash his skull in with Steven Tyler's old shriveled lips!  Could this movie have succeeded five years ago.  Maybe, but the writing is strained and some of the nostalgia has worn off and even Danny DeVito isn't his usual creep-charming self.  Altogether a colossal waste of PG-13 time.  Sequels rarely transcend the brilliance of the original and this one couldn't aspire to lick the its boots.

Cast:  John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, Cedric the Entertainer, Andre Benjamin, Steven Tyler, Robert Pastorelli, Christina Milian, Paul Adelstein, Debi Mazar, The Rock, Harvey Keitel, Danny DeVito, James Woods.

Running Time:  118 minutes

Rated PG-13 for violence, sensuality, and language including sexual references.

After conquering the movie business, Chili Palmer (John Travolta) grows weary of the cinema, and switches over to the music game when he gets a chance to team up with a friend's widow (Uma Thurman, entering the film in a very memorable way) to run a record label. After finding gold in a talented young singer (Christina Milian), Chili must first retrieve her recording contract from her shady manager (Harvey Keitel), outwit a dim, thugged-out-whiteboy wannabe producer (Vince Vaughn) and his homosexual, aspiring actor bodyguard (The Rock), negotiate a settlement of debt with a Suge Knightish producer (Cedric the Entertainer) and his gang (including Outkast's Andre Benjamin), and try to outsmart some Russian gangsters who are hot on his tail. All in a day's work in the record industry.

It has been 10 years since Chili Palmer last graced the big screen (has it been that long?) in the Elmore Leonard adaptation, ""Get Shorty."" Impressed with star John Travolta's performance, novelist Elmore Leonard took it upon himself to write a sequel novel, which is the basis for ""Be Cool."" Chili is arguably Travota's finest role, utilizing the actor's rarely used gifts for deafeningly calm coolness and charm. ""Be Cool"" also reunites Travolta with Uma Thurman, his dance partner in both love and heroin in ""Pulp Fiction."" Their chemistry is terrific, providing the backbone of the film while every other actor gets to run around chewing the scenery. It's tremendous fun to see Travolta in this role again; however, in those 10 years, there have been many personnel changes in front of and behind the camera, which occasionally disrupts the Chili fun of ""Be Cool.""

""Be Cool"", more so than its predecessor, leeches shamelessly and excessively off ""Pulp Fiction"", which by now is as common as imitating bullet-time from ""The Matrix"". What's sad is that ""Be Cool"" depends entirely on leeching off of ""Get Shorty"" while neglecting to develop its own plot; what you get is a short-lived sense of nostalgia sugar coated with some manufactured ""oohs"" and ""ahs"" you get from seeing the Black Eyed Peas and Steven Tyler on screen. While such technique may make for a nice 5-minute music video or Coca Cola promo, it doesn't make for proper storytelling. ""Get Shorty"" created much more tension with a lot less color, with the beef among rival mobsters playing out like a well choreographed dance of opposing chemical elements. ""Be Cool"" is more like a chaotic late afternoon preschool where all the kids are fighting for attention, sacrificing classiness for distracting noise.",1136073600,,2921,5.1847133757961785
2259102,1,B0008FXTB4,"I can't beleive how many blatant rip-offs there were in this film from the legendary ""Get Shorty"".  I bought the special edition of Get Shorty that had the free ticket to Be Cool in it.  I have been a huge Shorty fan for years and have read many Elmo books.  The book ""Be Cool"" was somewhat of a dissappointment, but I figured that Travolta would be able to resurect this in film format.  Wrong!  It felt like he had a gun to his head to do this film.....if I had to hear ""Look at me"" one more time, I was gonna shoot myself!

From character ripoffs to lines, I feel like they should have left Get Shorty alone instead of trying to ""Cookie-cutter"" it into the sequel.  Bad job!  It has actually hurt Get Shorty some!!",1135555200,,717,4.220588235294118

People who gave bad reviews probably did not pick up on the little things throughout the movie that make it hilarious. If you have a sarcastic personality you will enjoy this film even more. I had not seen ""Get Shorty"" prior to watching this sequel, but I quickly went out in rented it. It too deserves five stars, and I now own a copy of both movies. By far two of the best movies. They are entertaining and hilarious, and John T. plays his character exceptionally well. There is no other actor that could have portrayed Chili Palmer the way that Travolta has done.

In fact, the only thing I didn't like is John Travolta smoking endless cigarettes. We don't know how much Philip Morris paid for the hidden advertisement, but Travolta is the only smoking person in the whole movie. Well, Tyler smokes a cigar, but we know cigar smokers gather mostly in their own private clubs and poison each other without going out. That's fine and good. Travolta doesn't need the extra money.

Anyway, seeing John Travolta dance is always a kick. He's really smooth and cool and everything. Good job, except for the uncalled, useless smoking.",1132704000,,736,4.88

2259107,3,B0008FXTB4,"I approached this film verrry cautiously. I'd very much enjoyed GET SHORTY, this films predecessor, and wondered how much damage a sequel could do. Then I read several professional and private reviews of BE COOL which all but beat the film into the ground for poor scripting, poor acting, and in general just being a wreck-of-a-film. So to say I was hesitant to view it would be an understatement.

But I'm glad I did...

Although BE COOL didn't come close to the level of distinction that GET SHORTY did, this film does have its moments.

We're reintroduced to Chilli Palmer (John Travolta, ) as the Bronx shylock who's come west to enjoy the Hollywood film business. But Chilli is a bit burned out on the film industry and sets his sights on the music biz. And he thought getting a movie produced was tough!

Amidst the clamour and glamour of rappers, gay body-guards, Spice Girl lookalikes and Aerosmith, Chilli Palmer inserts himself with his usual maddeningly calm demeanor. And in these shark infested waters Chilli meets up with Tommy Athens (James Woods), an old buddy of his. While they're sipping drinks at a local establishment in L.A., a Russian mob hit takes place on Tommy and Chilli has to find out why.

John Travolta's character is reunited with Edie Athens (Tommy's widow played very well by Uma Thurman). Tommy was a music producer with his own label; a label that is nearly bankrupt. But Chilli and Edie may have found the perfect solution in Linda Moon (Christina Milian), a beautiful and gifted singer who's contracted to another producer. But can Chilli get her out of the contract? You bet he can.

In the end, Linda Moon sings with Aerosmith, the failing record label is saved, and all of Chilli's many enemies have been cowed.

************************************************************************

What stood out for me in this film was Vince Vaughn who played Raji, a white-boy wanting to be a black player. His antics were over-the-top and always hilarious.

Also notable was The Rock, who played a gay bodyguard who likes to sing women's songs and raise only one of his eyebrows. His rendition of ""You Ain't Woman Enough To Take My Man"" is absolutely hysterical.

We're also given the opportunity to see Uma Thurman and John Travolta dance again (hadn't seen that since PULP FICTION) and they both ""bust their moves on the floor"" very well.

So why three stars? Well, Chilli is just Chilli again. He doesn't grow or pull off anything unexpected. The double-and-triple crosses are pretty transparent. And if it weren't for The Rock and Vaughn, this film would have flopped on almost all levels. But they kept it uplifting and entertaining enough to keep me watching until the very end.",1132272000,2,2717,4.8847826086956525
2259108,2,B0008FXTB4,"Be cool proves that a big cast full of big names do not make a good movie. With so many actors, you'd think it would be a good movie. There a very few funny scenes, and the plot is boring and long. It really goes no where in it's 120 minutes. A potential movie turns to mush.",1129852800,2,275,3.8421052631578947
2259109,2,B0008FXTB4,"You get John Travolta and Uma Thurman.  You get a bunch of solid supports like Vince Vaughn, Cedric the Entertainer, Andre Benjamin, Harvey Keitel, James Woods, The Rock, Robert Pastorelli, Christina Milian, and Danny DeVito.  You get amusing cameos by Steven Tyler, Sergio Mendes, and many others.  Plus you get the original book of Elmore Leonard.  And then you get just OK 'Be Cool' unexceptional comedy drama.  In short, you don't have anotherr 'Get Shorty'; you only get short-changed.

Chili Palmer who was seen in 'Get Shorty' comes back, and in this sequel he wants to move into the music industy.  But as you know, finding and promoting talented artists could be a tough job.  Even if you find one, the job could be killing you when your record company is in heavy debt, and some gangsters are after you.  But Chilie would be always cool, no matter what happen.  He could also get gorgeous Edie played by Uma Thurman -- cue to them on the dancing floor ala 'Pulp Fiction' -- and see a basketball game with Steven Tylor, one of the many, many cameos.

In Elmore Leonard characters are everything, not the story, so I can forgive the complicated plot of the film.  I admit some characters are interesting, especially The Rock's Elliot, a thug who wants to be a movie star.  Stragely, the supports like Vince Vaughn and Andre Benjamin are more impressive than the two leading stars.

[OFFBEAT? NO JUST FLAT] There is a fine line between being off-beat and flat, and if 'Get Shorty' belongs to the former, 'Be Cool' is described as the other.  In spite of some funny moments, like The Rock parodying his public image, director F Gary Gray overdoes it.  See how Elliot raises his eyebrow twice, while once is enough.  See a Russian mafioso's wig blown away twice, not once.  See Sin La Salle, the gangster played by Cedric the Entertainer acts before his lovely daughter as a good father ... twice.  No wonder the film runs 120 minutes.

But actually, only one example would suffice to prove that 'Be Cool' needs Tarantino's skills.  There is a scene in which Travolta and Thurman dance together.  When they are in the same frame, everyone expects that, and yes, that happens.  And though the tension is not as high as the now classic Jack Rabbit Slim scene, the chemstry is there.  Sadly, however, the director ruins it with cut, cut, and cut, giving emphasis to God knows what.  That's when I missed the hand of Tarantino, who knows what he is doing, and knows what is going on.",1129593600,3,2484,4.6422018348623855

I much preferred how they wrapped it up in the movie. Anyway, it's great fun, and the cast is terrific.",1129334400,,435,4.190476190476191
2259111,2,B0008FXTB4,"An all star cast, a hip soundtrack and the sequel to Get Shorty, pretty much makes for a hit blockbuster. On the contrary, Be Cool fails to live up to its name and proves to be sooo very NOT COOL.

The plot is tedious to follow and way too complex. Half the time I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Basically, some Chilli Palmer snaps up singing ""diva"" Linda Moon from her ""abusive"" manager. Then three or four groups of people (Russians, black rappers, a rival recording company)start fighting over who actually owns her contract, who owes who money and who killed someone else. Very complciated and very boring. I had to force myself to watch it.

The acting is good in some parts, bad in others. Half the actors are souless and pretty much 1 dimensional. The real standouts, a cut above the rest, are the loveable Rock as the bodyguard and the fat black guy. These two add the humour and life to the movie- they keep the pace up.

This movie is certainly NOT worth renting, let alone buying. Sitting through this so called movie is not worth the 3 laughs you get.

2259113,2,B0008FXTB4,"This is pretty lame movie. I place the blame for it fully on the director's head. Elmore Leonard is a quirky enough writer that he provides a great base for filmmakers to leap from. Soderbergh did so marvelously with Out of Sight. He made the material his own, cast the film well, and infused it with a sexually charged, charismatic relationship between Clooney and Lopez. That's a filmmaker. Also, Sonnenfeld did a good job with Get Shorty. It was slick and original, edgy and engaging.

F Gary Grey, on the other hand, brings nothing but clich to his film. It's full of good actors who did their job, but it wasn't held together with a distinctive directorial vision. It felt a bit like a movie that, with its parodies of mobsters and gangsta rappers, might have done well in the early 1990's. I doubt, however, that that was the director's intention.

By the end it feels a little like Glitter, with its fake diva success and a big award show event. It's really shot as if the director thinks we're going to care, that we're going to be loving the film and cheering on right to the end. Not the case for me. This is bad in a way that I don't even recommend watching it. It's not amusing bad, it's just flat.",1126915200,2,1210,4.42152466367713

Get Shorty was a home run. They put together another great cast for the sequel; they had another great Elmore Leonard story. Then: the adaptation sucked. The direction blew. The actors phoned it in. And the production team couldn't capture that twinkle imperative to an Elmore Leonard story. Your time's better spent re-reading the book.

However, this movie is not nearly as bad as some have claimed.  There are a few really good scenes, a number that really work nicely, and then there is that crummy dance scene.  Without that (or a shorter version of it), this would have been much more likeable.  It just goes on too long and adds nothing much to the film.

The Rock gives a very engaging performance as the bodyguard who is gay, but doesn't quite seem to admit it to himself.  Vince Vaughn does a pretty good job with a despicable character.  When I see Robert Pastorelli on screen I am still upset that he killed himself with an overdose.  Cedric the Entertainer and his Gangsta Crew also add quite a bit to the story as do the Russians.  Harvey Keitel seemed to be phoning it in a bit.  Uma is good, but doesn't glow here.  And Chili Palmer is just fun to watch on the screen, so you gotta like Travolta for giving the character life.

Maybe if I had seen Get Shorty, I would have felt differently about this ""sequel,"" but I really don't think so for the simple reason that funny is funny.  John Travolta is still the coolest cat in town, but it's the entire, star-studded cast that really makes Be Cool something I consider rather special.  I think about half of Hollywood appears somewhere in this film, and no one gets in to the spirit of self-parody and hilarity more than The Rock.  Truly, this is The Rock as you've never seen him before.  Vince Vaughan is just ridiculously funny as a white gangsta music manager sporting Sweet Daddy's hand-me-down threads, but even he can smell the kind of unforgettable comedy The Rock is cooking in his scene-stealing performance.

I'll admit the movie doesn't have a particularly compelling plot, but this is one case in which plot really doesn't matter all that much.  For what it's worth, though, you have Chili Palmer (Travolta) moving into the music business, trying to make a star out of an obviously talented young lady named Linda Moon (Christina Milian).  Chili happens to have a strong connection to Edie Athens (Uma Thurman), and the timing is perfect for putting the moves on Edie because she has recently become a widow (an event for which Chili had a really good seat).  There's a problem, though, because Linda is under contract with a slimeball named Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel).  Vince Vaughan plays her ludicrously pseudo-ghetto manager Raji.  The Rock is Raji's driver, but he's also a singer and an actor looking for stardom.  I'm telling you, you've got to see this movie just for The Rock's performance alone - he's hilarious, and just wait until you see his character's music video.  But I digress.  You also have some Russian mafia guys running around, and Cedric the Entertainer adds even more to the movie as a music producer/gangsta who brings the whole crew when he rolls up to get in somebody's business - including his wife's cousin Dabu (Andre Benjamin), who just doesn't quite fit the role of a young gangsta.

This isn't Pulp Fiction or even Get Shorty.  Don't go looking for Tarantino because you won't find him here.  Be Cool plays solely for laughs, and it got almost two hours out of laughter from me.  It's the kind of movie you can't really describe - it's just too kooky.  I know a lot of viewers hold the movie in low regard, but I would urge you to at least give it a chance.  It really is one of the funniest movies I've seen in some time.  And, for the record, I also thought it was pretty darn cool.",1125273600,3,2648,4.627408993576017

All this movie offers is an allstar cast.  With John Travolta and Uma's dance scene I'm reminded of Pulp Fiction.  The director couldn't even get that right.  At the end when the singer wins the MTV award and the RZA and Fred Durst are shown, i realized the awful ploy of the movie.  Fred Durst was funded and brought up by the same people who own MTV.  This movie is a terrible attempt to appeal to middle schoolers and any other person who relies on MTV to tell them what is hip.",1125187200,,754,4.328571428571428

I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Cedric the Entertainer and Vince Vaughn, but this movie does not work.  At the beginning of the film, there is an inside hollywood joke about sequels- the people who made this film should have listened to their own joke.  James Woods is in the movie until he dies very early- which is the best role for anyone in this film.  The film, which takes Travolta's Chili Palmer character from the movies into the music business feels thrown together, and terribly long.  There are music performances by the Black Eyed Peas and Aerosmith, which sound and look great on the DVD, and Vince Vaughn has his moments as a white guy trying to be black but for the most part- it is just long, silly and pointless.  There is a subplot about Russians who are trying to kill Palmer that does not need to be in there and Thurman, who plays Woods' widow, really does not show the spark that comes out in Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction or any number of her other roles.  One small bright spot is The Rock, who has a nice role as a gay, driver, thug actor wanna-be.  Add this movie to the list of films which prove that sequels are a bad idea.  Although Thurman and Travolta dance together again, skip this one and watch Pulp Fiction again.  F. Gary Gray, who directed this mess, had a good effort with the Italian Job, but he should take note of this film, since he is working on the sequel to that movie as well.",1125187200,2,1515,4.318021201413427

In this movie Chili Palmer (of Get Shorty fame) attempts to segue from the movie business into the music business, with Christina Milian (syrupy teenage hip hop artist) as his protg.

The premise and plot are essentially the same as that of Get Shorty. The script reuses the tricks, gags and one-liners from Get Shorty and any new material is of a distinctly lower caliber, with the one notable exception being the very funny double act played out by Vince Vaughn (a white henchman who wants to be black) and The Rock (a camp bodyguard who wants to be a moviestar).

John Travolta and Uma Thurman attempt to recreate some of their Pulp Fiction chemistry. Whilst that chemistry is still there, we've seen the best of it before, and frankly Tarantino's characters were a lot more interesting than these.

Appearances by Harvey Keitel and Danny DeVito fail to rescue this rather lame attempt at a sequel.

Gary Gray in the director's chair this time around, as Be Cool finds former loan shark turned movie mogul Chili Palmer (John Travolta) looking to leave Hollywood and try his luck in the music industry.  Upon the death of a colleague (James Woods), Chili teams up with the widow (Uma Thurman) to sign a young up and coming songstress (Christina Milian) to their fledgling record label, which owes quite a bit of cash to an Ivy League gangster-rap executive (Cedric the Entertainer).  In the mix of all this is Milian's wanna be black former manager (Vince Vaughn, perfectly cast), his gay bodyguard (The Rock), and Vaughn's sleazy boss (Harvey Keitel); all of whom are soon gunning for Chili.  While Be Cool doesn't aspire to the greatness of Get Shorty (far from it), it's slickly produced Hollwyood entertainment that, for the most part, serves it's purpose.  Travolta is as great as ever, Thurman is wasted, and Vaughn and the Rock are undoubtadly the best things about Be Cool.

While there are good moments, and fun characters (The Rock had me totally cracking up), they don't hang together and there's too much flat time and dead space. One thing that REALLY bothered me was the lack of a soundtrack. In Get Shorty, one of the best elements was the soundtrack. In Be Cool, there are musical performances but no background music and some scenes really screamed for it. In a movie about the music industry, I find this a surprising lack.

* Then a 2'12"" promo for some other movie.

That's THREE MINUTES of ads and promos I'm FORCED to sit through, unable to fast forward or go to the main menu.  In effect, the studio has no compunction about STEALING MY TIME.

If I wanted to waste my time watching advertising and promos, I'd go to the cineplex.

When you think about the 100s of millions of DVDs sold and rented and viewed over the years, I estimate that the studios have STOLEN several MILLIONS OF HOURS from viewers forced to sit through promos and other messages on these DVDs.

Having my time STOLEN by the studio this way only makes me more sympathetic to pirates.  I really wish there was a groundswell of consumer outrage against the studios for STEALING our time.

As for the rest of the movie, well, the original GET SHORTY was excellent.  This BE COOL sequel is okay for one reason alone: John Travolta in the role of Chilli Palmer.  Great actor, great part.  Otherwise, a bland, so-so film.

2259138,4,B0008FXTB4,"I want to begin this review by stating that ""Be Cool"" is based on the novel by Elmore Leonard and is the sequel to ""Get Shorty.""

This movie has all the makings of a bad sequel. Different director, different screenwriter, 98% different cast, take a dialouge driven comedy and make the sequel a comedy. Etcetera, etcetera. Having said that, I did like this movie. I've seen

""Get Shorty"" twice, have read the book and read the book ""Be Cool"" as well. I knew going into this film it wasn't going to be as good as ""Get Shorty"" and it's not. GS was a great movie, with fantastic dialouge and an interesting Elmore Leonard-like story line. This movie has an all around different mood to it and the dialouge isn't bad, but it isn't as good. Be Cool is essentially a comedy, at least that's what it's billed as. Not every joke hits and in fact most fall flat. I liked this movie cause I did laugh a couple of times and seeing John Travolta and Uma Thurman together is great. The two have great screen chemistry that they haven't been able to show off on screen since 1994 when they made ""Pulp Fiction"". Be Cool is about former shylock-turned movie producer Chili Palmer. Chili has been getting sick of the movie business after making a flop sequel to his hit film ""Get Leo."" Chili is at a sidewalk cafe talking to his friend (a music producer) Tommy Athens. Tommy tells Chili about a movie idea and also about a talented young singer named Linda Moon. Tommy is shot and killed by a russian man and Chili goes looking for Linda Moon. Linda (Christina Milian) works at The Viper Room singing in a girl group and is under management by Raji (Vince Vaugn, very funny) a wannabe black man. To top that off Raji has a gay bodygard named Elliot (The Rock) who wants to be an actor.

Chili becomes Linda's new manager and with the help of Edie Athens (Thurman) he gets her to perform at an Aerosmith concert.

Also in the movie is Cedric the Entertainer and Harvey Keitel as

a gangsta rap mogul and Raji's boss. Both characters play fairly funny characters, CTE is better. It's nice to see Harvey Keitel, since he's rarely in a movie nowadays. Now as far as being faithful to the book it's probably 80% the same. The 20% is only minor things like Linda Moon had a band called Odessa in the book. B-.",1121385600,3,2285,4.4052132701421804

Let's say I stopped watching it when Harvey Keitel starts spouting on about the idiocy of hiring a ""faggot"" for a body guard (No, I'm not gay, just a non-bigoted person).  OK, I'm thinking at this point, what's this all about?  What it's a about is Hollywood at it's reckless and despicable worst.

As much as I like all of these actors, it felt like they were just going through the motions on this one.  I also think the movie suffers from an overabundance of bit parts just so they could squeeze in some more recognizable names and faces.  The only bright spot was relative newcomer Christina Milian, who can not only sing but actually looked like she was having fun with it.

Maybe some music exec decided to water down the criticism of the corruption in the music business, but that's what the story was about.

Think of that time you walked into a nicely appointed restaurant, one that you've heard a few good things about, even from friends.  The service is prompt, attentive, and courteous.  The meal is nicely presented in an ample portion, but as you eat your food you realize that you're getting full without getting satisfied.  You keep eating hoping to taste something good, but by the time you're done, you realized that you've emptied your wallet and filled your stomach, but walked away with nothing more than a few exta pounds.

That's exactly the experience that awaits you in this miserable, cynical, money-hungry sequel to a memorable film.  When the director and players get their paychecks before a film even opens, they owe the audience (especially those who loved the first movie) a lot more than they deliver here.  Scenes that are often interesting on their own are poorly strung together in between product placement and shameless self-promotion.

Perhaps the most egregious offense though is FGG's need as a director to explain jokes to the audience.  Whether it's having Chili Palmer explicitly mention movie references, having him tell Elliot why his ""monologue"" doesn't work, or (on the DVD extras) being told that Eliot's video is an example of how not to do it, it's annoying to be treated like someone who isn't smart enough to understand a gag.

2259154,3,B0008FXTB4,"I was intrigued when this movie came out.  For one thing I vaguely remembered watching ""Get Shorty"" and enjoying it.  At the same time I couldn't for the life of me remember what the first movie was about.

Neither could any of my friends.

After we got together and watched Get Shorty again, we all wondered how they were able to market a sequel.  Get Shorty was a good watch, but not very memorable, and I'm not sure why it got a sequel.

While Get Shorty wasn't an excellent or even memorable film, it wasn't a bad one, and I had good expectations for Be Cool.

Despite its name, Be Cool isn't cool because it simply tries too hard to ""be cool"".  A lot of the dialogues are forced and boring.  There are not really any catchy, quotable lines to be found.  There are a lot of lines portrayed as edgy and hooky, but they all seemed to fall flat.

I found the attempts at being hip and ""cool"" to be laborious and mostly missing the mark.  The whole gangster rapper scene has got to be one of todays most overplayed themes today, yet it was a central part of this film.  The American Idol/rising star story was another attempt at being with the times that ends up looking dated.

The cast performed well considering the script.  Travolta was his usual smooth self while Thurman was okay but not at her best.  Vaughn as always was entertaining, even though his character was a very contrived and stupid one.  The actor who I feel did the best job in this film was Cederic the Entertainer, who really played his part exceptionally.  Although I found his speech on African American contributions to society to be very over the top and beside the point, he still did an excellent job at it.

The main problem with this film is that the story doesn't really go anywhere.  Let me rephrase that: the story tried to go a lot of places at once, and didn't do a good job at any of them.  It ended up going everywhere and nowhere at the same time.  The result was an unfocused, unstylized, and often downright uninteresting watch.

The beginning of the film is somewhat entertaining, with the tongue in cheek commentary on the parallels between Travolta's real life and his characters.  I also thought Chili's comment on  1 F-word in a PG-13 movie with him proceeding to use Be Cool's 1 F-word was clever.

After that, the movie pretty much went downhill.

There really isn't a marked climax to the film, or even a buildup.  The story consists of Chili going around doing whatever he wants, despite threats from thugs who are hardly threatening or believable.

The Russians are a joke, despite the fact that they kill someone at the beginning of the film.  The gangster/rapper/thug/producers are a bit more interesting, but I still never believed for a second they would be a threat.  And Vince Vaughn's group is just ridiculous.

A lot of guns are pointed at Chili and a lot of threats are made, but I just didn't buy it.  There was never a situation in which it looked like Chili wouldn't make it.  There were maybe one or two scenes where he smoothly talked his way out of the situation,  and I did like his interaction with Cedric's character, but there was still nothing surprising or ""Edge of your seat"" throughout the whole movie.

While I realize this film is meant to be a light comedy, there should at least be a believable and appealing conflict somewhere in the script, and there just isn't.  The viewer just doesn't feel genuinely concerned over the plight of any of the characters.  Chili can take care of himself and Uma, Linda is unappealing and formulaic, and as for the rest of the good guys - oh wait, there really aren't any more!

Perhaps the biggest detractor from the watchability of this film is the constant barrage of advertising, or ""product placement"".  While supposedly this form is advertising is quiet and unobtrusive, I found it to be glaring and annoying, with the movie feeling at times more like an hour long advertisement than a Movie.  It certainly doesn't make me want to buy an H2, a T-mobile phone, Domino's pizza, or even a Honda Insight any time soon.

While it does have some serious flaws, the movie does have some strong points, such as Travolta and Uma's tango scene and the first interaction between Travolta and Cedric.

Overall I would recommend that you rent this movie before buying it.  Odds are you will have an enjoyable night watching this film, but it probably won't be something you'd want to buy.",1119657600,,4442,4.554292929292929
2259155,2,B0008FXTB4,"Man was I looking forward to watching this movie, and man was I diappointed by the mindless plot, storyline and overall result.

This movie is nothing more than an odd mix of a) an attempt to further popularize Christina Millian, b) too many celebs making banal cameo appearances and c) an odd concoction of mute, funny looking bodybuilders, rappers, comedians and Hollywood A listers vying for attention.

The only saving grace here were the usually comic antics of Cedric the Entertainer. Given the lousy material, he did the best he could to make this crap at least half entertaining and thus, bareable.

Even ole' Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) got lost in the muck of this mess and though entertaining at times, his participation in the film did little to improve the overall train wreck that resulted.

What really got me was the parallel story line...

On one hand you had this whole kill Gilly plot going on, and on the other you have this pseudo Mariah Carey ""Glitter"", struggling girl singer makes it big type thing going on.

What's even worse about it is that, unlike the ""glitter"" disaster, the ""Star"" or Ms. Millian, is a poor singer with a cute but very average and non-descript voice and limited acting ability or appeal. This makes the movie even more disjointed because the story line there is so far fetched that it's beyond reasonable comprehension for anyone over the age of 17.

Anyhow, the two concepts don't mesh in this movie.

Overall, this is one of those movies you kinda watch without actually watching it. You pop it in, and then go cook, do laundry, beat the dog, kick the cat, spank the kids or whatever else is on your to do list around the house.

In addition to being mind-numbingly dull, the movie manages to be supremely vulgar in non-creative ways.  Agree with all comments re the forgettable, endless performances by ""Linda Moon"": emphasis on FORGETTABLE. (Also agree with, why would anyone in this movie be rooting for her?  She comes across about as exciting as jello & completely dime-a-dozen, yet everytime she launches into one of her non-songs, a hush falls over the crowd and in no time flat, she's a superstar. Come on!) In fact, all the performances are endlessly boring due to their one-dimensionality.  Example of what this movie thinks is funny:  recently widowed Uma Thurman's t-shirts with the words ""mourning"" and ""widow"" on them. Just one lame, sophmoric, and oh-so-obvious attempt at humor after another. I really think the movie manages to alienate across generations, too, as I watched it with my 16-year old son and he hated it just as much as I did. The crass factor is off the charts, there's not one fresh, exciting, or likeable character in the entire movie, and the laughs are non-existent.  All attempts to ""be cool"" fall flat and a more appropriate title is ""be lukewarm.""  The PG-13 rating is an affront to my idea of what's okay viewing for thirteen-year olds.

The new actors that they have chosen was also great. Uma Thurman, Andre 3000, The Rock, Vince Vaughn and Cedric The Entertainer are great actors and actress in this movie.

2259178,2,B0008FXTB4,"""Be Cool"" is a disappointing sequel to 1995's ""Get Shorty"", a clever, funny satire of mobsters, mayhem and the movie business. Both movies are based on novels by acclaimed crime author Elmore Leonard.

In ""Get Shorty"" gangster Chili Palmer comes to Hollywood to collect a debt and ends up falling in love with the movies. In ""Be Cool"" he has become a big Hollywood producer who is now bored with it all. After a friend in the music business is murdered, he becomes involved in a war between various factions of hip hop music. Along the way be becomes involved with a beautiful woman and guides to career of a talented young singer.

The movie's big problem is that the satire is not fresh. The jokes about movie sequels, stars and hip hop music aren't that funny. Even the in jokes about Travolta and costar Uma Thurman's movie classics don't work.

Rather than buying or renting ""Be Cool"" [which isn't], I suggest you reach for ""Get Shorty"" [which is].",1118534400,4,953,4.627218934911243
2259179,2,B0008FXTB4,"After watching the first five-ten minutes of this film, I thought I had really found an entertaining flick. John Travolta has returned as the slick Chili Palmer who is tiring of the movie business. While having lunch with a music biz/former felon friend, Tommy Athens (James Woods), he suddenly witnesses Athens' murder. He then adjourns to a club where he stares down a manager-pimp, wrestles a body guard to the floor with one move, and is ready to jump into the music busines to promote an eager and ill-represented female singer, Linda Moon(Christina Milian).  The pace here is good and the lines are witty; but the film quickly goes downhill after that. The remaining hour and 45 minutes are filled with re-run dialogue, clichd plot and celebrity cameo walk-throughs.  There's absolutely nothing that's unpredictable, except for how many different types of low-life, re-tread images can be connected to the empty scenario.

 Vince Vaughn is a tickle the first moments you see him portraying a white music manager trying to be black (as in pimp), but then his bit soon wears thin, and frankly embarrassing. Cedric the Entertainer, an educated black music producer, and his posse of black rappers are supposed to make us laugh with their satirical, over-the-top rendition of gangsta music thugs- but they don't! If it's supposed to be camp, it's not. They're just a mix of not-so-comic stereo-types, most of which have been done before, but not so poorly.  Making their roles all the more ridiculous, out of nowhere the director decides to switch gears on the viewer, suddenly moving uncomfortably from dark comedy to social statement when Cedric issues a lengthy, serious diatribe to a Russian mobster who's just spoken a racial epithet -- a guy he then summarily executes (do we laugh or what?!).

Travolta is good enough in the reprise of his role from ""Get Shorty,"" but he's a prop, not an actor in this, merely an anchor to which all the other meaningless elements can be tethered.  Against him, clearly in a cheap attempt to insert (not gracefully) the magic of Pulp Fiction, Uma Thurman (as James Woods' widow) becomes his music business partner and love interest. Unfortunately she does not distinguish herself with work she appears to have phoned in.  Add to that Harvey Keitel as another gangster-manager, short appearances or celebrity cameos by Danny DeVito and Aerosmith's Steve Tyler- and you've got everything a Hollywood stargazer could want. As if that weren't enough, pro wrestler, the Rock, plays Vaughn's homosexual (again with sterotypical images) bodyguard. Truth be told, though, his self-effacing performance is actually pretty good and about the best thing in the film along with what we get from Milian.

Otherwise this is one disappointing movie. The script is weak, it's not funny, and there aren't enough special effects to make up the difference. I'd say pass it up.",1118534400,4,2899,5.035490605427975
2259180,3,B0008FXTB4,"This is a movie that had so much potential, but sort of squandered  it. It is enjoyable at times, and maybe not worth a purchase but a renting. I personally am glad I bought it just because of how big of a Vince Voughn fan I am. I found that he was funny as always in this film. But the real shock to me, and who stole the film was the rock. And that shocks me to say but he was great in this movie. And probably saved it. Now don't get me wrong I am not some wrestling freak, I actually hate wrestling. But the rock was so out of character in this film, and actually acted so well that he was the best part of the movie.

The problems with this movie are simple, so gay and so boring for huge stretches of time. The whole middle of the film is so boring and leaves you waiting to see vince vaughn and the rock again. But it picks up alittle near the end. It is really only funny from time to time. But overall it is not a bad film, it can be very enjoyable at times. Though those times can be limited.",1118448000,,1002,3.8829268292682926
2259181,5,B0008FXTB4,"In October 1995,John Travolta delighted audiences as Ernest ""Chili"" Palmer in the megahit GET SHORTY. Nearly a decade later,in this film,we see Chili moving from the movie industry to the music industry. The only other GS cast member to appear in this film is Danny DeVito as film actor Martin Weir. The first encounter between Chili and Martin is at a nightclub called the Viper Room. Chili was on his way in and Martin was on his way out. At the club,Chili discovers a singer named Lynda Moon(Christina Milian) with her group called The Chicks. Chili personally appoints himself as Lynda's new business manager. But Lynda's current manager(before Chili's self-appointment) and his bodyguard are at the club also watching The Chicks in action. Lynda is currently under contract which will not expire for another five years. But Chili revokes the contract and has Lynda under a new one. Throughout the film,Chili discovers various R&B,rap and hip-hop artists and manages them. Chili's love interest(Uma Thurman) has an Aerosmith tattoo between her back and buttocks. Vince Vaughn plays Lynda's old business manager. In a later scene,Lynda is singing CRYIN' with Aerosmith(Steven Tyler,Joe Perry,Tom Hamilton,Joey Kramer and Brad Whitford). That song was one of the band's hits in 1993. Thurman's character told Chili in one scene that she once played tennis with Hamilton. She never met the other four Aerosmith members until Lynda's performance with the band. Tyler appeared in several scenes by himself. Previously,Aerosmith appeared as themselves in 1993's WAYNE'S WORLD 2. This movie was filmed over a year before its March 4,2005 theatrical release. The late Robert Pastorelli,late of TV's Murphy Brown,plays some kind of tough guy in this film. Pastorelli committed suicide in early 2004. His previous film credits include BEVERLY HILLS COP 2 and FOLKS!. Also in one of the last scenes,Lynda wins a Grammy for a song she wrote and recorded. Great performances by Cedric The Entertainer and The Rock also. I'm sorry to say that this film unlike GS,was a box office disappointment. I think it's because no one from the first film except DeVito appeared in this film. Gene Hackman,Dennis Farina,Rene Russo and David Paymer,who all appeared in GS,were all written out(their respective characters). There should be another sequel where Chili goes into the television industry. Personally,I enjoyed the film and it deserves another sequel.",1118448000,2,2439,5.272493573264781
2259182,3,B0008FXTB4,"Be Cool opens with ex-mobster Chili Palmer (John Travolta) scorning sequels, as he says ""But sometimes you have to do it the studio way.""  The irony in this scene reflects on the notion that this is the sequel to Get Shorty (1995) where Chili travels to Hollywood in order to collect money and to his amazement discovers that the film industry has close resemblance with the workings of the underworld.  This time the audience quickly learns that Chili has grown tired of the movie industry and wants to revamp his career.  Through an incident where his friend Tommy Athens (James Woods) is shot in broad daylight by the ruthless Russian mafia and an altercation at a nightclub he decides to enter the music industry.  This is a business that unfortunately has claimed several artists' lives such as Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, but in this version the audience will experience a highly amusing gangster tale in the music world.

Chili is the epitome of coolness as he always says and does the right things at the right time.  He never fails for a second, as he continues to stay two steps ahead of those who move in on his turf.  Calmness surrounds his persona that never budges to pressure or threats, as he pursues his new career as a producer in the music industry.  Several characters comment on Chili's aspirations as a new up and coming music producer, and they all say his ideas are too lofty and will never work.  Yet, Chili gains peoples trust and interest through his cool existence, which always remains polite and helpful even at gunpoint.

Through careful management of people, Chili quickly climbs the ranks as a music producer, as he signs his first talent Linda Moon (Christina Milian) who he simply frees from another record company.  This however draws bad blood between him and those who wants to keep Linda under contract.  In particular, there is a minor co-producer with an inferiority complex called Raji (Vince Vaughn) who pulls his self-denying gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock) into a messy situation where he attempts to find a way to get Chili out of his way through any means possible.  To further complicate things Chili also finds himself inheriting Tommy's debt of $300,000 to Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer), a money hungry music mogul, and the Russian mafia wants nothing else than removing Chili from the face of the planet.

In this intriguing jumble of comical side plots, music, and guns it will bring the audience through a guilty pleasure of laughter and amusement that keeps the wink in the eye.  Ultimately, Chili ties it all together with his cool presence, as he continues as if it was business as usual.  Much of the enjoyment rests with in F. Gary Gray's direction that makes another funny and intriguing tale.  Another element that elevates the film's quality is the wide range of music in the film as it uses country, rap, rock, and much more.  The film also offers several interesting cameos that will elevate the film's cool feeling that film tries to induce.  Be Cool might not measure up with his debut film Friday (1995), or The Italian Job (2003) when it comes to action, but he will definitely offer something to laugh about while leave the audience entertained.",1118361600,2,3232,4.790990990990991

2259184,3,B0008FXTB4,"The last two (recent) movies I've watched, via DVD, were Sideways and Be Cool.  In the case of Sideways the prevailing opinions were that it was the best thing since sliced bread.  Roger Ebert gave it four stars.  I watched it and was left scratching my head saying ""huh""?

With ""Be Cool"" it seems to be getting absolutely ripped to shreds by most folks including Ebert.  While I didn't love it, however, it was far better than I expected.  Long story short:  Public opinion and that of Ebert's is usually wrong.

""Be Cool"" isn't as good as its predecessor, ""Get Shorty"" but it's funny.  Both are based on books by Elmore Leonard.  The funniest part of the movie are its puns and ironies, such as Steven Tyler, when he is introduced by Travolta's Chili Palmer character to ""Linda Moon"" played by Christina Milian, misunderstands the motive for the meeting, knowing Palmer as a movie producer, Tyler assumes Chili wants him for a movie part.  ""I've done OK without movies so far"", says Tyler.  The pun is that he is saying this IN a movie.

Vince Vaughan as the white wanna-be homeboy music manager Raj is hilarious, as is The Rock as his gay bodyguard who wants to enter showbiz, while the most disappointing is Uma Thurman as Edie.  Uma, Travolta and another music agent played by Harvey Keitel all seem a bit over-the-hill for this type of R & B but it makes it funny.

Some dislike this because of the ""stunt casting"", several actors from Pulp Fiction ""reunited"" with the assumption it was done so to make a bad movie seem good.

2259186,2,B0008FXTB4,"I don't like giving such a low rating, but I would like to add a half to my 2 stars. The reason it received more than one was because of the Rock and Cedric the Entertainer.

In general, the movie was all over the place. Not in a creative Tarantino way but in a disjointed, several-stories-going-everywhere-way. And what about the characters from Get Shory,  we saw Devito's character, but what about Renee Russo? They had Chili doing too much of the same thing over and over again

(e.g.""Look at me!"") and it just got played out. I don't want to give the movie away, but there were some characters, scenes, and plots they could have seriously cut out.

Lastly, I like some of Christina Milian's music, but the story around her made the movie look like a personal career booster.

Compared to Get Shorty, Be Cool lacks the smoothness, subtlety, and overall coolness that made the story short, sweet , and right to the point.

Chili Palmer was a supercool tough guy in Get Shorty.  All of a sudden Cedric the Entertainer and his ""posse"" of idiots has Chili by the balls?  What gives?  If Chili talked trash in GS he backed it up - now he sells out to this hip hop culture crap. Are you serious??

In a documentary among the special features on the BE COOL DVD, everyone, including Travolta, lauds the fact that the director encouraged them to improvise and ad lib as much as they pleased.

This is why, while a fun film, it falls far short of SHORTY. When you're dealing with source material by Elmore Leonard, you should stick with it, for his dialogue is nonpariel.

The lines from the first film get echoed, not once, but over, and over, and over again.  They recycle all the jokes, and situations, and dialogue from the first movie.  Granted, there are a few new additions to the film: in the book, Linda Moon was in a rock band, but in the movie, she's more of a Beyonce Knowles rip-off.  Vince Vaughn works the hardest at his role as Linda Moon's manager, who thinks he's a pimp.  The Rock stars as the James Gandolfini character in this one.  Of course, the problem with going through all the motions of the first film is that Be Cool suffers by comparison: it seems long and boring.

2259221,3,B0008FXTB4,"""Be Cool"" is unmoored from reality - it envisions the music business as a creation straight out of Wyatt Earp's Tombstone - hired guns, rote murders, amiable cops tossed aside in favor of street enforcers. It is, thankfully, a funny movie in bits and pieces, which is as much a testament to Elmore Leonard's book, upon which the movie is based, than anything the performers or director F. Gary Gray bring to the production.

The movie is a sequel to ""Get Shorty"" and reintroduces us to John Travolta as Chili Palmer, the Brooklyn wiseguy who in the first movie exercised his brute charm and mob connections to a career in the film industry. ""Get Shorty"" was a smarter, dirtier film, with a coherent plot and a director (Barry Sonnenfeld - where'd he go?) wise in the ways of black humor. ""Be Cool"" has been cut off at the knees - PG-13 goes with gangster like Tang accompanies filet mignon - and features one of those detached, bemused Travolta performances where he sags on the couch, squints and lights cigarettes.

Chili is ushered into the tune game rudely - he watches a buddy (James Woods, in cameo) get blasted by a Russian loan shark. Seems the buddy was trying to get cash to buyout the contract of one Linda Moon (Christina Milian), a tiny black diva managed by a giant white fool named Raji (Vince Vaughn). Raji, played with mixture of goof and childlike menace by Vaughn, is one of the chief pleasures of film, a wannabe pimp so far lost in hip-hop lingo and gesture that he seems to forgotten the completely perfect bowl of hair smeared in sweat to his head. So is The Rock as Raji's gay bodyguard, one eye on Linda, one on the kind of showbiz career Chili can promise.

There are at least three other sides to this overstuffed cast: Cedric the Entertainer is is a Suge Knight type with a Harvard degree; Andre 3000 as the Suge-type's bodygurard; Harvey Keitel is a record label owner playing both sides; and Uma Thurman is the dead guy's wife. What an odd role for Thurman to accept - a fraidycat former groupie, opposite completely from her ""Kill Bill"" series. At least she looks fab.

""Be Cool"" knows very little about the real music business. The day will not come when a girl without a single skimps onstage with Aerosmith for a Steven Tyler duet. Dueling record moguls don't stand around on street corners issuing ultamatums for a wad of cash when a lawsuit would suffice. This is the cartoon version, and the cartoon characters - Vaughn, The Rock, Andre 3000, even Steven Tyler - stick out. The mellower gang of Travolta, Thurman and Keitel drag. And Milian, as Linda Moon, can belt a note, all right, but ""Be Cool"" does not reveal her as a movie star.

If this means lowering the film's rating from an `R' to a `PG-13', reducing the script to a minimum level of intelligence and sophistication, and dumping leading actors and actresses then they'll do it for the bottom-line. Thankfully this is often only used as a last ditch effort by studios to make a little extra money on the side with a franchise they feel has the potential to make some money in the market but is not one that they feel they have to throw all their cards into to get it done properly. Unfortunately this is becoming more of a common oddity then in the past, which does not bode well for audiences.

The story once again follows Chili Palmer as he navigates his way through the world of organized crime, Hollywood movie moguls, and music industry competitors. Chili Palmer, once so enthusiastic and engaged with the then-budding film making business, has grown tired of making movies in Hollywood, in not maintaining the proper creative control of the product he had before. Now he wants to take the time to return to the music industry and after a music mogul friend is whacked during the middle of a lunch meeting to discuss a new script, he takes this opportunity to make a career change. Not only does he have to deal with his friend's widow wife now in charge of the independent record label and a young pop-star in training but also a music industry competitor desperately trying to get to her first, an Eminem-esque manager and his queer bodyguard with stars in his eyes, the Russian mafia, and gangster rappers with three-hundred thousand dollars owed to them by the record label. As they say, you never quite know who is attempting to kill you because in the music industry, it could be anyone. The genius of Get Shorty was the concept of the perfect stylized satire to the Hollywood film making business, which is in severe contrast to Be Cool, its long-delayed and vastly inferior sequel, that is truly nothing more then a trumped up gangster flick, not the classic kind, with the occasional medley for filler. One of the script's major flaws, and there were quite a few of them to choose from, was the lack of back-stories included with any of the film's supporting characters, most importantly that of Linda Moon. Any information that the audience receives about her, beyond the clichd ""dead father was a musician too"" excuse, is minimal at best. There is no motivation, for either the audience to root for her or an understanding of the characters actions, in her attempting to make it within the music industry.

Here we have John Travlota in the same tried and true cool, collective character that has been so overdone, with fault falling largely on himself, in the course of the last decade or two which is quite difficult to watch such a sad state of affairs. Where is Quentin Tarantino when an old friend desperately needs him right now? Speaking of Tarantino, Uma Thurman went from Kill Bill to this? True, there are risks taken in the Hollywood business but does it necessarily have to be a suicidal one such as this? Not surprisingly, Vince Vaughn, along with The Rock, easily steal the show in the roles of Raji, Moon's white manager who talks and acts as if he were a black man ala Eminem, and Elliot Wilhelm, Raji's queer bodyguard with aspirations to become an actor, which is a real surprise for everyone in the audience (sarcasm intended). In spite of the fact that their characters and the jokes involving them get quite old by the time the credits begin rolling, the moments that do work are the saving grace of this picture from being an absolute waste of time and money. There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that Christina Milian is quite possibly a sweet girl and honestly has the true motivation to get involved in the motion picture industry as an actress, but history would prove otherwise. If past experience has taught us anything it is that singers should stick to what they do best, singing, while performers should remain with what they are best at, in particular cases this only has to be assumed and not true to fact, with no crisscrossing in between the two separate entities. Why did the screenwriters feel it was their prerogative to have James Woods' character killed off at the beginning of the movie? Did James actually read the script and secretly paid the writers to have him whacked off early enough in the feature that audiences would not recall him? For those who happen to be fans of the actor's respectable career in the movie industry this is an assumption that should be gladly accepted. And why is Danny DeVito features on the film's poster if he only has two, if not unnecessary or unexplained, appearances throughout the film's entire two hour time-length?

Moving on, let us get straight to the heart of the matter which is to discuss the rather insane amount of superfluous cameo appearances in this film. Anybody who is anybody, or perhaps more appropriately anyone who has the connections to spend a day shooting a quick scene in order to keep that limelight bulb flickering for a few years longer, makes an appearance in this disaster. Despite not speaking a single line of dialogue and appearing only briefly, quite possibly by accident, could Fred Durst's cameo have been timed more perfectly with the release of his sex tape? What a marketing genius! Beyond Steven Tyler, the rest of Aerosmith, most notably Joe Perry, cameo in this feature, and even when the material stinks and the dialogue given isn't worth the price of the paper it was written on, they are still the greatest rock band in the world. It would be stating the obvious to say that the Black Eyed Peas are a joke and can not sing worth a lick, but who would have thought that they were even worse when onscreen? Other appearances include Gene Simmons, Rhumba Bums, the Pussycat Dolls, Dub MDs, and Sergio Mendes. And who could forget, in case you missed her, Anna Nicole Smith's memorable kiss with Danny DeVito at the Lakers' game? Honestly, why is she even in this film to begin with? Does she not have a horrendous enough reputation that she need soil it further with a lousy film career, not involving the porn industry that is.

Overall, Be Cool itself may be the true reason as to why Chili Palmer is so vehement in his efforts to get out of the movie business. As he himself said in the film, it has become too commercialized, restrictive, controlling, lacking in proficiency ... the fact that this project got the go-ahead from studio executives proves that they either did not bother to read the script or failed to pick up the writers' hidden message. In any event, who needs satire or parodies when you have a film out there that is willing, intentionally or not, to make fun of itself at the expense of others? The question has to be asked as to how extensive of a production budget this feature had. Why? There's enough glaring product placement in this walking-talking train-wreck to make even Adam Sandler cry. It was once understandable for MGM Studios to do this sort of thing but did they not just get bought out by the Sony Corporation? The average movie-goer does not pay eight bucks per person, along with the ever escalating prices for popcorn and drinks, to have ten to twenty minutes worth of advertising thrown into their face only to have an entire feature film throw around corporate logos like they were out of style. Capitalism is a tremendous valuable endeavor but there comes a time when marketing tends to exceed its `natural' limits, and this may be one of those times where it has to be stopped. As was said before, Get Shorty was the pinnacle of Hollywood satires upon itself but those big-wig executives enacted their revenge with this monstrosity. Okay, perhaps it was not at the level of `Michael Moore'-esque conspiracy theories, but after witnessing such disasters as The Whole Ten Yards, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, and Exorcist: The Beginning you have to wonder why studios would intentionally ruin viable stand-alone films. Sadly, Hollywood is Hell-bent on riding the sequel wagon for all its worth and it is going to take a lot more then a few duds that cost them practically nothing, possibly even gaining a profit thanks to product placement, to deter them.",1113696000,,8699,4.728590250329381
2259224,4,B0008FXTB4,"John Travolta reprises his role as Chilli Palmer in this sequel to his 1995 film Get Shorty. In this go-around, Palmer tackles the tumultuous arena of the music industry.

The movie opens with Tommy Athens played by James Woods , Music Mogul, trying to negotiate an autobiographical movie deal with Palmer (Travolta). While trying to explain the seedy underworld dealings of the music industry, Athens is gunned down by a very unprofessional Russian ""insurance"" hit-man in Palmer's presence. Palmer, tiring from the movie industry and eager to venture into another field of work, quickly seizes the opportunity to jump into the music industry; and therefore, fills the void left vacated by Athens' demise. This, in turn, reunites Palmer (Travolta) with Pulp Fiction co-star Uma Thurman, who plays Edie Athens, Tommy's wife and partner.

Palmer immediately stumbles upon singing sensation Linda Moon played by Christina Milian; however, she is already under contact and managed by wannabe pimp Vince Vaughn. And thus the story begins.....

Much like the previous film, the cavalcade of stars in this film is endless: Cedric the Entertainer, Harvey Keitel, Steven Tyler, Danny DeVito, and even The Rock, who portrays a gay bodyguard to Raji (Vaugh).

If you liked Get Shorty, then you'll probably like this film as well. I found it mildly amusing at most.

2259226,2,B0008FXTB4,"Be Cool is the sequel to the 1995 smash hit Get Shorty. John Travolta (Basic, Pulp Fiction, Grease) reprises his tough guy role as Chili Palmer who wants to quit the movie buisness and go into the music business. His friend Tommy, played by James Woods (Diggstown, Scary Movie 2, Virgin Suicides) gets whacked by the Russians. He wants to make Linda Moon, played by singer Christina Milian (Man Of The House '05) a star. So, Chili visits Woods' now widow Edie, played by Uma Thurman (Kill Bill 1 and 2, Pulp Fiction, Tape) so they join together and make this girl big but she has a contract with the rival Nick Carr, played by Harvey Keitel (National Treasure, U571, Pulp Fiction). Keitel's two henchman are played by The Rock (The Rundown, Walking Tall, The Mummy Returns) and Vince Vaughn (upcoming Wedding Crashers, Made, Swingers).

I didn't like the Music Video awards segment, I thought that was too corny. Vaughn got some of the highlights but he overblows his character way too much. The Rock also had some moments along with Andre Ice Cold 3000 (""Dont give me no gun"").

This is a great film to watch just to pass the time. Overall BE COOL is relaxing entertainment and if I may... cool.

2259229,4,B0008FXTB4,"Ok this movie is low on plot with the little plot it having being lame. Plus basically it just jumps from one thing to another. Still though I don't know how Roger Ebert could just dismiss it with a * 1/2 review. The supporting cast is hilarious and they make the movie very enjoyable. John Travolta and Uma Thurman are just cool in their roles and add some class to the movie. While everyone else is having a good time goofing off and getting paid for it.

  The Rock is great as a bodyguard who wants to be an actor and who's also just a little....fruity. In his movies you just think of him as...The Rock. Here he blends in as an actor with guys like John Travolta and Vince Vaughn. He shows his comic talents and shows he has a much brighter career ahead of him than just being brainless action films. Vince Vaughn is also very funny as a wannabe hip-pop gangster named Raji.

  He's fighting with Travolta over the contract of a new talented singer. So that's what the whole plot is basically. Chili Palmer ""Travolta"" decides he wants to get into making music instead of movies. He finds a new singer and decides to make her a star. I found the movie plot in Get Shorty to be better. Shorty is just a better movie because it's more original and better made. I find most of the music scenes to last too long because they aren't the strong points of the film or what make it good. You feel like saying ok stop singing I  just want to laugh more.

  This movie has a lot of funny and odd ideas and the cast pulls them off great. I mean the Rock has the best and weirdest material I've seen in a movie in years. His character won't admit he's gay yet he does a music video singing a Dolly Pardon song. Also when he auditions in front of Travolta he chooses to reinact a cheerleader scene from Bring It On. The Rock is a gonna be big and he shows that here. I mean Vin Diesel makes a joke out of himself by trying comedy in the Pacifer. While the Rock shows here he can do whatever he chooses to do and he can handle it perfectly.  Plus Travolta is also better than he has been in years here. Is sad though that all him and Uma get to do after awhile is bob there heads to a song they like. So don't see the movie just to see them reunite because you might be disapointed. This is a weak character for Thurman especially after being so damn good as the Bride in the Kill Bill movies. Just go if you want a good laugh from the supporting cast.",1111190400,4,2442,4.141649048625792
2259260,4,B0008FXTB4,"The title Be Cool is ironic because the film isn't as cool as Get Shorty. Be Cool, unlike Get Shorty, takes a while to get going. But when it does, Be Cool is a very funny movie. Being a much bigger film fan than a fan of the music scene, I got more of the jokes in Get Shorty. Still, it's a worthy sequel.

I do miss Rene Russo, Gene Hackman and Dennis Farina from the original. Russo is still sexy at 51. Hackman is one of the finest actors in film history, able to do comedy and drama equally well. And Farina always adds greatly to whatever project he's in. But Uma Thurman, Cedric the Entertainer and Harvey Keitel do an admirable job in essentially the same roles (Thurman's first scene, in a skimpy bikini, is sure to arouse any man with a pulse). Vince Vaughn is pretty funny as a white guy who thinks he's black although the routine gets tired by the end of the movie. And the late Robert Pastorelli, in his last role, is as funny as usual as a mob hitman who makes eating cole slaw one of the most nauseating experiences imaginable.

However, The Rock steals the show from just about everyone as Vaughn's musclebound gay bodyguard. I didn't like The Scorpion King at all and wondered what all the hype regarding The Rock was about. After seeing Be Cool, I understand. The Rock hits all of the right notes in a role that is essentially self-satire, right down to the raised eyebrow. He creates a very likable character without becoming a buffoonish oaf. In fact, a couple of the biggest laughs in the film are The Rock's towards the end of the film.

But of course, the film succeeds primarily because of John Travolta's ultra-cool reprise of Chilli Palmer. Played by a lesser actor, Palmer could come off as cocky and arrogant and immediately lose the audience's sympathy. However Travolta, as he did in Get Shorty, finds just the right tone to project Palmer confidence without sliding into arrogance. My only complaint is that Travolta is still smoking -- something you definitely don't need to do to be cool.

Hopefully, in the next film, Chilli Palmer will take on the television industry. Reality shows alone will provide enough comic material to carry a movie.",1111104000,33,2176,4.543367346938775

With: Vince Vaughn as Raji, a disturbed man who is always just trying to ""Be Cool"", with his helper, who happens to be gay, Elliot Wilhelm(The Roock), who delivers, possibly, the most disturbing performance ever(you know, excluding all of Tom Green's movies), and is not even remotely entertaining, or funny, his performance is just as exciting to watch as to watch paint dry.

What follows is a series of double-crosses that get to be just a bit too over the top.

I really wanted to like ""Be Cool"", and to some extent I did.  ""Get Shorty"" was a great movie, and a sequel was inevitable, especially once Elmore Leonard wrote the sequel novel.  The problem this time around is that the talent of the large cast is less than the sum of its parts.  ""Get Shorty"" had four leads, and they were all on top of their game.  ""Be Cool"" has arguably nine leads, and more does not mean better.  Sure, Cedric the Entertainer and The Rock are the standouts of the group, but Travolta's Chili is just a bit too cool.  We never really believe that he is in any danger.  Thurman's casting is just a stunt to get her and Travolta dancing to recreate their famous ""Pulp Fiction"" scene.  Vaughn is amusing as the white guy who thinks he is black, but that grows tiresome by the time the movie is half over.

All in all, ""Be Cool"" is not a bad movie, but it is not as good as it could be, and never lives up to the standard set by its predecessor.  I would recommend it, but wait for DVD.",1110499200,,1740,4.294478527607362

Gray opts to play the film more like a big-budget Hollywood sequel with tons of big stars and goofy cliches than to give Elmore Leonard's style the attention it deserved. Previous attempts to adapt Leonard's work (Out Of Sight, Jackie Brown) were home runs because they played their humor more smooth and subtle where ""Be Cool"" tries too hard to be a comedy. Travolta doesn't bring anything new to the table in his portrayal of Chili and the script has the usual rehashed material that comes with sequels. If ""Be Cool"" had half of the character and style as ""Get Shorty"", they might have had something but unfortunately, it offers nothing more than a few assorted laughs.",1110326400,,1336,4.8384279475982535
2259265,4,B0008FXTB4,"I remember seeing ""Get Shorty"" when I was in my earlier teens.  I had no idea what the movie was about at the time.  Then I watched it again a few years later and really liking it.  I was hoping that some sort of sequel would be made for this movie.  When I saw the trailer for this movie, I loved the look of the cast that had been assembled.  I also had some concerns because usually a cast that star-studded means a flop.  Luckily I was proven wrong.

The movie takes place years after ""Get Shorty"" ended.  The movie is about Chili Palmer (John Travolta), an ex-mob thug, trying to get out of the movie business and into the music business.  While at a club, he discovers Linda Moon(Christina Millian), a really talented singer and performer who is under contract with Raji (Vince Vaughn).  Chili steals her away from Raji and takes her to record label owner Edie (Uma Thurman).  From there, the movie turns into one group trying to get another group out of the music scene and trying to get Linda to go with there label.

First off, there are some really good performances in this flick.  Travolta is a natural in this role.  Thurman, Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer do what you would expect from them.  I loved Vince Vaughn's character Raji.  He is a white guy who thinks he is black.  Vince does a great job of keeping the character fresh and not too repetitive.  But the highlight character has got to be Elliot, whom is played by The Rock.  This is a gay character who wants to be an actor/country western singer.  I would have never thought that The Rock could pull this character off, but he shows that he really has some acting talent.  Plus, seeing him sing "" You ain't man enough to take my man"" is worth the price of admission.

Overall I would have to say that I enjoyed this movie.  It wasen't the best that I have ever seen, but it kept me entertained and laughing for about two hours.  Most movies that are released with this much star power turn out to be busts.  Usually there is too much talent and not enough time to display it all.  Thats where ""Be Cool"" differs from other movies of this star caliber.  Everyone in this film gets an opportunity to showcase what they have and it results in a successful film.

With three FULL-LENGTH upsettingly generic R&B songs performed by eye-candy nobody Christina Millian, Gray manages to undercut a good eighty percent of what could have been a really fun movie with shameless, obnoxious promotion for Millian, who is frankly worth looking at, but not worth listening to. It's like someone beat Elmore Leonard with a copy of Eight Mile until he agreed to write a D-list pop star's vanity project.

Poor John Travolta has nothing to do except smile beatifically and quote his own microwaved leftover lines from ""Get Shorty,"" which this movie claims to follow. Even Uma Thurman, who still looks like a million bucks tax-free, doesn't get a chance to do anything interesting except wear a number of outfits that look chosen by an oversexed high schooler.

Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, and Vince Vaughan almost save the day. Andre Benjamin (of OutKast fame) is funny in a bit part, and hopefully we'll see more of him in better movies than this. If Gray had half the eye of Sonnenfeld, Tarantino, Soderbergh, or any number of A- (and B-) list directors who have successfully tackled Leonard, he could have shifted the focus to them and made a great popcorn flick.

Instead, he made a two-hour ad for a lousy pop singer and threw away all the interesting characters.

Chili Palmer, having left the Shylock business to produce movies in Get Shorty has...left the movie business to produce music in Be Cool.  However, the music business is just as cut throat as the movie business apparently as Chili finds himself the target of a gang, the Russian mafia, crooked music execs, a gay body guard (the Rock who is probably the only truly funny person in the movie), and a hitman.

If you've seen Get Shorty, this will seem very familiar.  And that's because it is.  The only difference is that instead of being in the movie industry, we're in the music industry and instead of being consistently funny, we are only semi-funny, some of the time.

There are a couple homages to the first movie, bill boards, Danny Devito's character, and similar situations (like Uma and Travolta waking up in the middle of the night because they hear the TV on downstairs), so it was kind of fun to catch those little touches.

I'm really at a loss of what to say, it's kind of like when they made the Whole Ten Yards, they are trying too hard to be just like the original that they fall flat.  For those who haven't seen Get Shorty, it MIGHT be better.  For those who have seen Get Shorty, I wouldn't bother with this movie.  The best way I can describe this movie is that it's Get Shorty if Get Shorty weren't directed or written by the same people.  And the people that wrote it weren't very funny.

There are flashes of brillaince throughout the film.  The Rock manages to generate a few laughs with his role as Elliott the homosexual limo driver/bodyguard.  Christina Milian turns in a decent performance as Linda Moon, but her best scene (and one of the best scenes in the movie) is when she's singing onstage with Steven Tyler of Aerosmith.  And every now and then the terribly overrated Vince Vaughn manages to garner a chuckle or two with his performance as Raji (he thinks he's black and uses ""urban"" dialect throughout the film), but none of these performances is on the level of Travolta's and this lack of skill makes the rest of the movie pretty monotonous.

I expected a little bit more punch from F. Gary Gray, but all I got was some bad editing and a few lame jokes.  The film has its moments where it connects, but those moments are few and far in between.  Be warned, aside from a few moments with The Rock and a great performance by John Travolta, this movie will generate more yawns than laughs.  Be Cool was anything but ""cool"".",1109894400,,1398,4.52988047808765
2259320,2,B0008FXTB4,"Elmore Leonard writes slim, slick little crime novels that are stuffed cover to cover with vivid characters, twisty plots and pitch-perfect dialogue.

So ... why does Hollywood have so much trouble making good movies out of his books?

Quentin Tarantino and the writers of ""The Sopranos"" have made fortunes co-opting Leonard's breezy style on-screen but, with only a few exceptions (""Out of Sight"" and ""Jackie Brown"" being the most notable), the movies made from his books tend to fall short. ""Be Cool,"" the sequel to 1996's ""Get Shorty,"" is no exception.

John Travolta again plays Chili Palmer, a Brooklyn loan shark transplanted to Los Angeles. In ""Shorty"" he applied his snub-nosed mentality to the task of producing a hit movie but, by the time ""Cool"" opens, he's eyeing a shift to the music industry.

""I think movies are too corporate,"" Chili complains. ""They need to be spontaneous and creative.""

They do indeed, but self-conscious jokes like that only highlight how dated and forced the script feels.

Chili hooks up with the widow (Uma Thurman) of a shady record executive and together they hatch a plan: If they can bring fledgling R&B singer Linda Moon (Christina Milian) to the attention of the rock group Aerosmith, the band might let her sing onstage during a concert and they can parlay that attention into big bucks. Seriously.

Meanwhile, they have to contend with a loud-mouthed, velour-draped manager (Vince Vaughn), his sensitive bodyguard (The Rock), two shifty moguls (Cedric the Entertainer and Harvey Keitel) and a small army of hit-men and thugs.

There may be a way to pitch all this activity so that it works, but director F. Gary Gray plays the gags big and broad and the actors seem lost in search of a laugh track. Former wrestler The Rock gamely parodies his own image by playing a gay wanna-be actor, but the movie mocks the character's orientation relentlessly and that's the general, lame level of the humor here.

During the last hour, the film becomes a rotating series of scenes in which characters sit around endlessly plotting against whichever characters aren't in the room. By the time ""Be Cool"" finally does wrap itself up, one thing is certain: Few sights are less amusing than smart actors like Vaughn, Keitel and Cedric standing around pretending to be stupid.",1109894400,2,2307,4.955958549222798
2259321,2,B0008FXTB4,"Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is back after ten years and he is looking sleeker and sharkier than ever in his latest film, ""Be Cool."" Unfortunately, the entire film around him is flat and uninspired, except for a couple of scenes that make you wonder: what happened?
Most of the time, Travolta seems to be acting in a different film than his fellow actors. But when he connects: he connects big time as in his scenes with Edie (the glorious Uma Thurman):  his tango-mambo-Sergio Mendez-cha-cha-cha dancing scene with her is absolutely surreal and beautiful. Why/how did director F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job) go so astray?
Another gorgeous scene is Cristina Milian's (Linda Moon) singing onstage with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler. But other than these two scenes it is dullsville.
There are a couple of chuckles involving The Rock as a gay bodyguard/chauffeur to music mogul Raji (Vince Vaughn) but mostly this film inspires nothing but yawns. The question here is: with this cast how did so much go wrong?
First of all the pace is too slow, the editing is slack and boring and the writing is poor at best. Even Billy Wilder would have trouble putting this lame script across.
""Be Cool"" could have been...but it just isn't.",1109894400,11,1219,4.860576923076923
2259322,5,B0008FXTB4,I really enjoyed this movie tremendously. This is laugh out loud good. The movie about shylock Chili Palmer who's burnout after the sequel to his movie was a bust. Decides to get into the music businesss after discovering Linda Moon played by Christina Milan who is terrific as a actress and singer. The cast of characters in this movie are terrific. But the standouts are Cedric the Enterainer and Andre of the group Outkast. Also the part when Uma Thurman and John Travolta dancing is great as well.,1109894400,,501,4.704545454545454
2259323,4,B0008FXTB4,"When I told friends that I would be attending a sneak preview of the sequel to GET SHORTY, every single one said the same thing (in more or less these words):  ""Was there really any demand for a sequel?""  They had a point, since I must confess that although I remember more or less enjoying GET SHORTY, I can not remember a single thing that happened in the original.  I remember it starred John Travolta, Danny DeVito, and Delroy Lindo, but not much else.  Having said that, I must admit that I enjoyed BE COOL.  It is not a masterpiece, and very likely I won't remember much of it a few months after having seen it, but for the hundred or so minutes that I watched it I found myself laughing much of the time, and all in all having a good time.

Basically, BE COOL sets out to be an enjoyable light comedy, and it succeeds.  It features a large and largely excellent cast having a pretty good time.  The only real returning cast member from GET SHORTY is John Travolta (though Danny DeVito has a few cameos) as Chilli Palmer, former shylock turned movie producer, and who now wants to get into the music business after having become disenchanted with the movies.  He gets his opportunity when a friend (played briefly by James Woods) tells him about a great young musical talent he wants to get into the movies, and who on Woods's death becomes his charge.  Well, more or less, for much of the movie revolves around who is going to be Linda Moon's (played appealing by Christina Milian) manager.  There are additional plot elements involving Russian gangster, the efforts of the Ivy League educated manager of a gangster rap group (played by Cedric the Entertainer) to get the three hundred thousand dollars that Woods owed him, and other odds and ends, the kind of details that tend to fade in the mind after having seen it.

I don't want to pretend that this is anything other than light-handed fun.  It is one of those films that is fairly predictable even if you can't predict what is going to happen.  But I did find it fun.  Vince Vaughan was good for some laughs as a black talking/acting music manager, but I enjoyed even more The Rock, playing his body guard.  I had more or less dismissed The Rock as someone who could ever interest me for more than a nanosecond, based on the utterly dreadful string of previous roles he had undertaken, but I loved how he played against type in this one, showing more of a sense of humor than one might have anticipated.  Though a body guard, he is a gay who will pulverize anyone who calls attention to his sexuality, and is pretty funny in a music video where he performs the Dolly Parton classic ""You Aren't Woman Enough to Take My Man"" and in a scene where he briefly auditions by performing two female roles from the cheerleader pic BRING IT ON.  Mind you, he isn't one of the world's great comedians, but unlike his action films, he was actually fun and his character interesting.  He was, by the way, almost unrecognizable at first, because he actually had hair for a change.  The rest of the cast is solid, though no one produces what could even remotely be considered their best work.  John Travolta and Uma Thurman have a romance of sorts and even have a dance number together, but by and large they fail to reproduce the chemistry they had in PULP FICTION.  I was pleased to see Debi Mazar get a small role, an actress I've always liked, but have never gotten to see in any good roles.

So, I can mildly recommend this if you are looking for a fairly funny flick and go to see it with minimal expectations.  If you are looking for a truly great film, go see SIDEWAYS instead.  I personally have always subscribed to the theory expounded by Harvard philosopher Stanley Cavell that you don't truly love the movies unless you like most movies.  I like this one just fine, though I doubt if in six months I will be able to tell you a single thing that happened in it.",1109808000,43,3921,4.441340782122905

8056070,3,B0008FXTB4,"This review is from: Be Cool [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)

I new this movie was made for TV but I figured that with so many well know actors that it would rival real movies. I was wrong. It was quite formula and many of the actors just walked through their parts.

Chili Palmer (John Travolta ""Grease"" (1978 ex-shylock goes from movie producer to record producer with the discovery of a suppressed singer Linda Moon (Christina Milian.) Naturally, she is under contract to a bad guy. Well so it does not look too simple or like some second rate musical, we through in a black want-to-be, a black gangster singing group, and even the Russian mafia.

One of the main catalysts and the reason to watch this is Uma Thurman who played Irene Cassini in ""GATTACA"" (1997), and has done the impossible by just keeps looking cuter with age.

Danny DeVito must think he is Alfred Hitchcock as he makes his cameo in the movie.

All in all, it is watchable. Buy Blu-ray when you can but do not expect the acting to get any better.",1511222400,,1007,4.48087431693989
