8342100,5,B001TND12Q,"This Stu Hamm course is a very good one that is very complete for the beginner.  It is interesting that someone of Mr. Hamm's reputation would take the effort to create a ""from the very start"" course but here you have it.  If you don't anything about bass and are completely baffled except for the fact that you want to make music - this course is it.

He covers the basics like strings, tuning up and what an amp does for you.  But then he goes into octaves, 5ths, 3rds and arpeggios.  That is the ""bread and butter"" of bass playing.  You would not believe how far you can really go with just that information.  After that he gets a bit out of focus and jumps into scales.  Then he tries to tie all this together into blues, rock, and pop forms and feel.  You're basically playing bass by that time and rockin'.

Once you finished this course Stu Hamm has several intermediate courses that build off this as well as Andrew Ford.  I like Mr. Ford's courses a lot.  All these are available here as well.

Some other reviews said this course had material for advanced players.  That is really not true.  This course is to get you by the first month to six months of playing then you're done with it.  The concepts in this course will build up and become more advanced and those will be your new references.  You don't go back and review your 2nd grade reading book right?",1456099200,,1369,4.326771653543307
8342101,2,B001TND12Q,"It starts out with the sub basement of basics, as in, ""these are the parts of the bass"" and ""turning the peg this way will make tune the string higher"" and moves at warp speed into technique that is not at all basic.  My son bought this and is very disappointed.  I have to agree with him.

Another gripe is that while his personal bass is very cool, my son did not pay to hear him blather on about how cool it is.  Bah.

My husband is a very good bass player and we know Stu Hamm to be one of the best, but this video does not live up to its title.",1452902400,,549,3.8230088495575223

8342104,5,B001TND12Q,"In the days of our grand parents, the books used to teach reading were called ""primers.""  Hamm has produced an excellent primer for the study of bass guitar.  It is a product of [...] and maintains the same high standard of instructional clarity as do their other products.  The downloadable pdf files used with the DVD formated video, combine to help to make this product a very solid resource for the beginning bass player.  The course starts by describing the parts of a bass and includes all the particulars of nomenclature, amp choices, changing strings, and other rudimentary elements.  It progresses through the study of octaves, the major scale, the minor scale, the mixolydian scale, and arpeggios. The course gives a beginner plenty of tools to develope solid skills.  Definitely a ""must have"" for the beginning bassist.",1255824000,5,830,5.021897810218978
