8405363,5,B003TP3V0E,"Great movie that paints a realistic picture of the day-to-day challenges faced by minorities in Martinique (French West Indies) after slavery was abolished: almost everyone works cutting cane, can barely makes ends meet.  This moving story revolves around a smart young boy, Jose, trying to study and be successful in school (the only way out of poverty) as well as the sacrifices his grandmother has to make for him to get ahead (and be the single one in his village to do so).  Movie is in French (and some limited Creole that does not impede understanding if you do not understand Creole).  Highly recommended movie if you understand French.",1433808000,2,644,4.889908256880734
