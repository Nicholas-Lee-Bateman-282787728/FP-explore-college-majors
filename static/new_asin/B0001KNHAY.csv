2009173,1,B0001KNHAY,"Very rarely will I turn a movie off once I have purchased it. So when I brought home ""Savage Island"" I fated myself to an evening of the latest and greatest direct to video had to offer. And when I say video, I mean video. This thing had to have been shot on a Radio Shack quality camcorder! During the daylight scenes, it has all of the quality of your last home movie, during the night scenes though....well it was like watching a movie shot through a camera with sand stuck to the lens. The grainy, color diffused shots help the movie a bit, but not enough, because I was still able to see some of what was happening, and none of it was good. Basically, the filmakers tried to blend ""Deliverance"" with ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and fail BIG! You have the wacky ""city-slickers"" who accidentally run over one of the bumpkins hidin' in the hills, well the hillbillies don't take kindly to that so they go after the city-slickers and thier baby. The same story has worked countless times before, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""Pumpkinhead"" spring to mind, but with no budget, no production values, poor acting, and lousy script, ""Savage Island"" takes even this basic story and screws it up. The not-so special effects are laughable, and if you don't see the ""twist"" ending coming...well you should never be allowed to watch horror films again. Please do not even think of buying this thing, you may encourage these guys to make more movies!!!",1094515200,8,1441,4.610894941634241

2009206,3,B0001KNHAY,"It's gruesome and brutal and not exactly uplifting, but it's a HORROR movie!

Ain't supposed to be sunshine and rainbows :)

You have to suspend belief and common sense here and there, but you might just like it too.

Adds some twist to the usual formulaic hicks vs city folk story.

Or you might hate it :)  That's the problem with rating movies. Everyone has different tastes and no two people see a movie in the same way.",1491264000,4,424,4.384615384615385

This film one a lot of awards at The New York Horror Festival including best actress Kristina Copeland. Don Davis from Stargate took home an award too.

2009209,1,B0001KNHAY,"Despite the reviews of this movie being overwhelmingly bad, I went ahead and took a chance on it much to my chagrin. Savage Island is your standard Redneck Degenerates vs. Progressive Yuppies kind of movie, which has been done almost to death. Indeed, Savage Island adds nothing to this favorite of horror movie themes. However, my one big criticism of the film is that the casting of the the Savage family (the redneck family) seemed all wrong. If they are supposed to exemplify the qualities of barbarity and backwardness then at least use some actors/actresses that appear to be somewhat representative of those qualities. Simply put, the actors portraying the Savage family just seemed to attractive, or at least too normal looking. And the one member of the family, the elder son, come on, he could have doubled as a GQ model. He sure ain't screaming redneck inbred. In fact, none of the actors really are. I suppose the yuppies seem yuppie enough but in fact it would seem that the families could be interchangeable, i.e. either one could play either side. And if the director meant the distinction to be ambiguous I think that he succeeded, however, to the detriment of the movie itself. Other things could be said about the failure of this movie but I'd rather not take the time to dwell on them. simply put, leave this one on the shelf!",1137196800,5,1345,4.727659574468085
2009210,4,B0001KNHAY,"Remember John Boorman's 1972 film ""Deliverance,"" based on the novel by celebrated southern author James Dickey? The picture starred Ronny Cox, Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, and Ned Beatty as four city dwellers who decide to go rafting on the Cahulawassee River before a dam turns it into a lake. The trip rapidly turns into a nightmare when backwood hicks launch a war of vengeance against the outsiders. The film serves primarily as a framework to examine the fragility of civilization, and how four men raised in the city respond when confronted by barbarism. It's a film whose violent themes contrast sharply with the beautiful imagery of the river and the Georgia backcountry. It's also the film in which actor Ned Beatty forever after became associated with the term ""Sooey."" I mention ""Deliverance"" because the low budget, shot on video production ""Savage Island"" borrows many of its most significant plot points from Boorman's masterpiece. This film also introduces us to city folk confronted with tough decisions when a tragedy unleashes violence in the shape of a backwoods clan. And like ""Deliverance,"" civilization must battle barbarity for supremacy. This film, however, ends on a decidedly different note.

""Savage Island"" introduces us to the Harris family, father Steven (Steven Man), mother Julia (Kristina Copeland), and their infant child. The three are heading out to an island somewhere in the Pacific Northwest to meet up with Julia's parents and brother. Keith Young (Don Davis), his wife Beth (Beverley Breuer), and their son Peter (Brendan Beiser) live on Savage Island, as its known, with the hope of building a ritzy resort to lure wealthy vacationers from the coast. Unfortunately, Keith runs into a few snags in his plans due to the presence of a family of ""squatters."" This is the Savage family, consisting of patriarch Eliah Savage (Winston Rekert), wife Mary (Lindsay Jameson), and their kids Joe (Gregg Scott), Lenny (Zoran Vukelic), Rebecca (Nahanni Arntzen), and Jimmy (Kyle Sawyer). That's a big family, isn't it? In fact, there are so many people mooning around on this island that it's difficult in the extreme to keep track of them all. Hopefully I got the genealogy correct. Anyway, Peter Young drives down to the dock to pick his sister's family up and take them back to the house. This guy is such a clown, however, that he accidentally hits little Jimmy Savage with the SUV when he takes his eyes off the road to hassle his sister. Ooops. Needless to say, Eliah and his clan aren't happy this incident occurred.

Shortly after the accident Eliah and his wife show up at Keith Young's house demanding that Julia and Steven hand over their infant child as a replacement for their loss--a straight out trade, in other words, that will stave off confrontation. Keith predictably refuses and orders the Savages off his property at the point of a gun. Big mistake. Peter disappears after mucking around in the forest, captured by a couple of the Savage kids, and a war of attrition soon erupts with horrific ferocity. The Young family suffers most of the casualties, and the Savages kidnap Julia and her child. This bloody turn of events leaves Steven as the sole survivor, meaning he must come up with a way to rescue his family and get off the island. He'll have to hurry, however, as Eliah plans on marrying off Julia to one of his sons. Ugliness follows as Steven locates the Savage cabin and takes his own brand of bloody revenge against the squatters. Will Steven rescue his beloved wife and child? Will the family escape from the island and return to the comforts of civilization? I leave it up to you to discover the answers behind these questions. I will say that before everything is said and done, a couple of twists unfold that fundamentally changes the direction of the narrative.

""Savage Island"" is a decent picture. In fact, compared to most of the shot on video dross I've seen over the past couple of years, director Jeffrey Lando's film is the ""Citizen Kane"" of the camcorder school of filmmaking. He manages to tease out good to great performances from his cast, with notable mention going to the actress who played the nervous and later greatly terrified Julia. Too, he convinced a recognized actor, Don Davis, to star in his film. The atmosphere and locations also work to the film's advantage. Savage Island is a gloomy, heavily forested region that reeks of isolation. When it gets dark on this island at night, it gets DARK. Sort of makes you wonder why someone would plan to build a resort on such a brooding piece of real estate. The film works well overall in spite of a few flaws, such as the totally unbelievable conclusion, and is entertaining enough for a zero budget production. A bit of violence rears its head from time to time too, which always helps a film move along. ""Savage Island"" isn't a gorefest by any stretch of the imagination, but the fate of several characters is grim enough to give the film an even darker edge.

The disc contains a lot of extras. I've discovered that these miniscule budget filmmakers love to pile on the supplements when they finally get a chance at a DVD release, and ""Savage Island"" is no exception to that rule. Trailers for this movie, one for ""Liar's Poker,"" and another for ""Jack Frost"" are here for your perusal. Also on the disc are three separate commentary tracks and interviews with the director and several cast members. There's even a look at the production facilities where the film received its finishing touches. I recommend ""Savage Island"" to those viewers close to losing patience with shot on video turkeys. It's not exactly a diamond in the rough, but it's close.",1120953600,3,5685,4.851699279093718
2009211,1,B0001KNHAY,"Savage Island is a lame movie that was shot on digital video.  No, the movie is not lame becasue it was shot on video.  It's jsut plain dumb.  The nonsensical plot , tedious acting and boring direction is what makes this movie lame.

Nothing worth mentioning about this flick except find something else when you're at the video store.

Not recommended.",1119744000,4,352,4.704918032786885
2009212,4,B0001KNHAY,"Here we go again!  This time the rednecks are squatters who are living on someone's private island.  They feel since they were there first they own the land.  This part of the story really isn't important.  One day the normal family runs over the redneck baby and all heck breaks loose.  Sime real good tension and chills are abound, but this film clearly tries to be ""The Hills Have Eyes"" which it is clearly not.  Still, it is better than Hills 2 (what couldn't be?) and is menacing, graphic, and well paced to keep the viewer interested.  Its kinda like a hybrid of Hills with the new Chainsaw saga.  Not nearly as good, but effective as a low budget shocker.",1103414400,4,662,4.458333333333333
2009213,1,B0001KNHAY,"Jeff Lando's Savage Island was a huge disappointment when i saw it recently in the bargain bin at Blockbusters. This film was shot on DV for around $35,000 and looked as if it was going to be an exciting The Hills Have Eyes / Deliverance style exploitation flick. The film begins well but after ten minutes or so, the image quality becomes terrible and with no real reason other than the camera man got his settings wrong. This was a real shame as if the film had been lensed in a straightforward manner; Savage Island would have been a successful straight to video thriller. However the visual failings make the film look like a grainy home-movie when it shouldn't be. Apparently the film has won some awards. I doubt they were for best cinematography. This was unwatchable.",1101081600,4,775,4.664233576642336
2009214,5,B0001KNHAY,"Savage Island's raw savagery will scare the hell out of you! Trust me.

Also, the below review clearly comes from someone who lacks  proper knowledge of film. The filmmakers chose the lighting and camerawork in order to reflect the dark, murky, and egdy mood of the film.

In fact, the film has won SEVERAL horror film festival awards.",1097971200,3,335,4.741379310344827

8013723,3,B0001KNHAY,"*** 3 Stars ***  This Canadian micro-budget flick is actually a lot of fun - if you're up for a 'murderous in-bred crackers hiding in the hills' kinda story (aka, ""Deliverance"").  But this ain't Southern!  It ain't even American!  It has the vibe of both, but It's really a flick from British Columbia (that would be Canada) made by young folks with links to the pricey international prep school there, Columbia Academy.  So OK, ""Savage Island"" has no serious budget, and the filmmakers might be too young to know who Mr. Rogers was.... it's still a fun flick to watch.

8013724,1,B0001KNHAY,"Bad sound. Bad video. There is no twist at least not one that makes any sense nor is believable. Continuous stupid horror movie decisions. A bit brutal occasionally but not increasingly so. There is a clever idea behind the movie, but it is wasted in execution. I hope the actors had more fun making it than I did watching it, but I doubt that.  They should have used Don Davis as General Hammond retired and dropped in some aliens and killed everybody. Then I would have cheered.",1506988800,,480,4.517241379310345

I thought the movie was great, and I agree wholeheartedly with Jeffrey Leach's review.  Also, I didn't verify Movieman's comment, but it wouldn't surprise me that it won a couple awards at The NYC Horror Film Festival.
