7281176,4,B00ZGIOLUG,"I am a devoted follower of James Spader's work and would pay to see him sit ina chair for an hour and a half but what these three films show is his versitility and talent. Storyville is one of my favorite of his films and feel was neglected when it was released. It is still a really good story. The New Kids is a mean little teen story where James is a town punk, not a good film but he still is all in. Alien Hunter was an interesting take on an alien landing and the consequences of that. James is a brillant, compromised proffessor who is brought in to assess the situation. The ending is surprising. In all it is a good package if you love James Spader. Storyville is the best of the three.",1467676800,2,695,4.117647058823529
7281177,5,B00ZGIOLUG,"I actually ordered this for ""Storyville"" rather than ""The New Kids"" and I am rating ""Storyville"".  I loved this movie.  Spader was outstanding in this New Orleans based story of politics and deception.  It's suspenseful and keeps you guessing.  I had it on video tape and needed to get it on DVD, so this was a great purchase.  So far as ""The New Kids"", I would give that movie about a three.  I thought it was okay, but not one that I particularly want to watch again.",1466467200,,469,4.333333333333333

7281180,1,B00ZGIOLUG,Cheap DVD.  Tried to play it on two different DVD players and the DVD is of such poor quality that it would not play.  Spend the additional money for a legitimate James Spader Alien Hunter DVD.,1462060800,,193,4.333333333333333

8720083,4,B00ZGIOLUG,Worth it just to see evil redneck Spader in The New Kids. Over the top 80's trash.,1495497600,,82,3.8823529411764706

8720085,5,B00ZGIOLUG,"""The New Kids"" is my favorite ""B"" movie of all time.  I am 76, and have watched this film with dozens of friends and family members, probably close to 40 or more times.  It is what I like to call a tit-for-tat action story, where a group of baddies alternate attacks and counterattacks with the good guys.  It is directed by Sean Cunningham, of Friday the 13th fame, and has a very entertaining climactic battle in a renovated neighborhood carnival, where the villains meet their comeuppance, well deserved, Spader being the chief baddie.  Great song played 3 times in the soundtrack.  Clever little '80s kicker at the end.  Lori Laughlin as the heroine is seen in one of her earliest roles.  The good guys are soooo good, and the bad guys soooo bad.  I love it!!!",1486944000,2,764,4.5661764705882355
8720086,5,B00ZGIOLUG,"Made my sister, with her decades long crush on James Spader, very very happy. And the movies are good too, which wasn't particularly necessary for her, but was a nice bonus. I got a ton of good big brother points!",1481846400,,213,4.35
8720087,4,B00ZGIOLUG,perfect for a James Spader fan!,1476144000,,31,4.333333333333333
8720088,4,B00ZGIOLUG,If you haven't seen New kids buy this DVD.  It's deff out dated but it's still an awesome  cheesey 80s horror flick well worth the price.,1475280000,,137,4.230769230769231
