3147456,4,B0015UWYOO,"""Un Secret,"" (""A Secret""), (2007) is a French movie, a dramatic evocation of World War II, and the Holocaust directed at Jews as it was played out in that Gallic country.  It utilizes a flashback technique to tell the story of one particular family, the Grimberts, and, interestingly enough, gives us the scenes of current life in black and white; the WWII scenes in color.  It's apparently based on a true story, by Philippe Grimbert.  Claude Miller directs this engrossing drama about a Jewish boy in post-World War II Paris who stumbles upon a mysterious toy in the attic, exposing his family's secret dark past and how it survived Nazi atrocities. It asks the question: can the young boy grasp the devastating truth, or will it drive him deeper into his personal fantasy world?

It's a thoughtful, meditative film, in which action comes slowly, and many of the more important happenings occur off-screen.  However, it is telling a unique, individual story of people caught up in the war and the Holocaust, just when some of us probably thought there was no more to be said on that subject. The acting is top-rate, with the beauteous Ccile De France as Tania Stirn, champion swimmer/former Chanel model, as the boy's mother; Julie Depardieu, as Louise, family friend and massage specialist; Patrick Bruel as Maxime Nathan Grinberg/Grimbert, a businessman, the boy's father.  Ludivine Sagnier turns in quite a performance as Hannah Golda Stirn / Grinberg , Maxime's first wife.  Mathieu Amalric plays the older Maxime. . There are, in fact, rather a lot of characters, which the film expects us to sort out; I was sometimes a bit confused between them. There is, however, no mistaking the sensuous longing tango that Tania and Maxime dance in the disastrous days of WWII.  I found these scenes among the sexiest I've ever seen in film; and, to me, the movie had great emotional power, but its meditative quality may not suit everyone.",1287187200,3,1936,4.89908256880734
3147457,3,B0015UWYOO,"A much too long film with an interesting premise, but one that has been touched on several times before in French cinema--i.e. someone uncovering, ""What really happened"" to one's family during a period of nationalistic bigotry, collaboration, and deadly religious persecution.  Nonetheless, the acting is fine and the period costumes impeccable.  Go for it if you're specifically interested in this historical era.",1264550400,3,414,5.661290322580645
3147458,5,B0015UWYOO,"I borrow movies from our libraries. They have a good selection of French films. Just finished watching it today. There is a typical French style of storytelling--nothing too direct, always something left unsaid or about to be said. The excellent touch was using color for the past and black and white for the present. Conventional wisdom dictates that color for the present scenes and to signify something of the past/or dream, use black and white. The director/producer sent a subtle message by reversing the order. Also of note the movie's not over using the Jewish issues--rather using Jewish experience as a backdrop to draw a larger sketch of universal human psyche, with color of love, jealousy, envy, romance, hurt feelings of a neglected child, the paradox of love and passion, guilt--a lot of things said in a rather short time, very eloquently. The narrative of the movie was of matter of fact style. I find it amusing how casually, yet necessarily, French movies show the force of eros and sensuality. Look at the massage session when the family friend gives the female main character a massage. Speaking of erotic scence, it was very well-done--not through groins and groping. But through the eyes of a male and female. the longing and surrender, the animal desire in silence, the expression of mutual understanding of two bodies-expressed through minimum of sound and physical actions.
The music was good--nostalgic. I do not understand French, but got the vibe of being in Paris, with cobblestone street and the normal, spontaneous human friction. The movie will also interest psychologists--it shows how a shadow is created in someone's mind through repression and denial. What I find most interesting is that the humanness of each character was the profound theme in every scene. The political and social issues were peripheral--as if it was there and the producer had nothing to do with it, and he did not want to send any socio-political, even cultural message for that matter, through this movie. What he/she wanted is to tell a neat story of few lives centered on few points on the historical canvas. Of course, tragedy of WW-II was unavoidable, but to me, the lives came foremost.
Well, a good show, for a French movie, which to me are often depressive.",1261180800,2,2274,4.971128608923885
3147459,4,B0015UWYOO,"The beauty of this film's tragic story is that it is based on a true story.  Francois, a protagonist of the movie explains his strained relationship with his father by looking back at the family history.  His father and his mother were young and married during WWII.  But the circumstances under which they got together are monumentally tragic.

His father Maxime was married to a young woman Hannah with whom he has a young son Simon.  Simon was liked, strong, athletic, adored by all friends and family.  Hannah's brother Robert is married to a stunningly beautiful and athletic Tania that is the source of Maxime's emotional torment and almost uncontrollable sexual desire.  Maxime is a gymnast and Tania's athleticism in an instant attraction.  But he is also a tomcat, kind of man who likes other women and his attraction to Tania does not go unnoticed.  Through a string of tragic coincidences, Hannah decides to declare to authorities that she is Jewish and before long she and her son are deported to a concentration camp.  As Tania's husband also dies as a prisoner of war while fighting for the French Army, the two are free to finally be together.

It is their union that produces a fragile, young boy who is sensitive, kind and physically fragile which almost seems like a punishment for both Maxime and Tania who are (physically) quite the opposite.  It is a kind of story that would not have a happy ending at any time, but it gives a completely new dimension to it when applied to the anti-semitic times in France during Vichy government rule and another woman's decision to rather die with her child than have her life spared and spent in humiliation and heartache.",1250812800,,1681,4.758620689655173
3147460,4,B0015UWYOO,"Director Claude Miller's memorable film demonstrates the conflicts that develop when people masquerade through their lives. The opening scene, filmed in what is meant to evoke Populuxe-era technicolor, is shot at a swimming pool where whiny little Simon becomes chilled while his spectacular mom Tania (Cecile de France) demonstrates her prowess in the water.

Then we meet Simon's dad, Maxime (Patrick Bruel), who tries to teach the kid elements of gymnastics, to no avail.

Then the kid, poking around in the attic, discovers this toy doggie, and wants to know what it means. Will he find out? Of course!

Eventually, the movie cuts to Simon at 15 (in 1962), and then to 1985 where (in black and white sequences), now played by Mathieu Amalric, he is dispatched to retrieve his dad, who's gone on a walkabout after his dog, who he's let run without a leash, gets killed by a car.

Soon, we learn what part of the secret is: the family's Jewish. Now, in pre-war scenes, we find ourselves at a Jewish wedding where Maxime is marrying Hannah (Ludivine Sagnier). At the wedding, Hannah (Sagnier's hair is red for the part) glows. She has a blissed-out smile on her face. But Maxime already is making eyes at Tania.

When France is occupied, most of the family proudly affirms its Jewishness by donning the yellow star (it actually makes sense to them to do so!), but Maxime refuses.

Eventually, with forged papers, in groups, the family plans an escape from occupied France to Vichy France. Maxime goes first, and is joined by Tania. Still in Paris, waiting for her chance, by this time Hannah has become a total mess. The perpetual smile has been replaced by perpetual sorrow, even as the child they have (also named Simon) develops the athletic prowess the future Simon will not possess. And then as Hannah and Simon arrive near the border, the rest of the secret is revealed. And although by then you'll pretty much have figured it out what will happen, you'll still be overwhelmed when you learn how it happened.

The movie's touching, thoughtful, and well acted: hat tips to de France, Amalric, and Bruel; and props to Sagnier--this hottest of hotties (""The Swimming Pool,"" ""A Girl Cut in Two"") really tones it down and manages to create a character you can believe in.",1239753600,,2273,4.783163265306122
3147461,5,B0015UWYOO,"'A Secret' is a multi-layered movie that deals with myriad themes. The central character is Francois Grimbert  who has always had a rather distant relationship with his father Maxime [Patrick Bruel]. As a young boy, Francois is not keen on sports and appears rather frail [he was a four lb baby] and very unlike his athletic father and swim champion mother Tania [Cecile de france]. His young mind conjures a phantom brother that is very athletic and strong, driving his parents to distraction. When Francois discovers a toy in the family attic, secrets long hidden begin to unravel, thanks mostly to a long-time family friend, Louise [Julie Depardieu] who reveals all that she knows.

Told via a series of flashbacks, the story unfolds. Ironically, the flashbacks to the past are portrayed in color, and the present [where the now mature Francois goes to meet his old dad] is in black and white. This is ideal as in this story, the past is of the most significance. As the 15-year-old Francois learns, his 'imaginary' brother of childhood was very much real, and was called Simon, much beloved by his father Maxime, and his mother Hannah [Maxime's first wife]. As the story progresses, we learn of a complex love triangle, involving Maxime, Hannah, and Tania. Maxime first sets eyes on the gorgeous, blonde Tania at his wedding to Hannah. At the time, Tania is married to Hannah's brother, but when the Nazis begin expanding their power across Europe, Tania's husband becomes a prisoner of war and this brings Tania closer to Maxime and his family, which now includes the young Simon. As the Nazis occupy France, Maxime refuses to wear the yellow star, turning his back on his Jewish identity, much to the chagrin of Hannah, who is proud of her heritage.  Hannah also slowly realizes to her horror that Maxime desires Tania, and this realization later plays a tragic role in shaping the ultimate destiny of Hannah and Simon.

The plot here may come across as incredibly convoluted, yet despite the many layerings to the story, conveyed by the frequent flashbacks, the plot flows well, almost seamless, and I could easily follow the stories of the main characters.

This is a riveting human drama that not only portrays the complexities of love and relationships, but also shows how the French Jews, as portrayed by Maxime, his family and close friends were affected by the Nazi occupation of France, and how the French government basically turned its back on its Jewish citizens. Final verdict:  a well-made Holocaust-themed human drama.",1238630400,32,2538,4.932084309133489
3147462,4,B0015UWYOO,"""A Secret"" (Un Secret) is a World War II drama based on the novel of the same name by Phillipe Grimbert, which has also been published under the title ""Memory"". It has a complex time structure, shifting between 4 different time periods in the life of Francois Grimbert and the earlier lives of his parents during the War. Seven-year-old Francois (Valentin Vigourt) is frail, reclusive boy living in the shadow of his athletic father Maxime (Patrick Bruel) and beautiful mother Tania (Cecile De France) in 1955 Paris. He finds a stuffed animal in the attic one day that elicits strong and inexplicable reactions from his parents. Seven years later, his neighbor and longtime family friend Louise (Julie Depardieu) tells him the long-suppressed story of his parents' past that puts his life in a new context.

A lot of films have been made about the struggles of French Jews during World War II. Every time I see one, I think it's going to be like all the others. But I'm usually wrong. For some reason, this subject has produced great cinema in France. There is always a restraint in how these stories are told, and the characters are strong enough to engage the audience's interest, yet ordinary enough to represent whole communities. ""A Secret"" is no exception. Maxime, Tania, Louise, and, later, Hannah (Ludivine Sagnier) are vibrant, sympathetic people no matter what they do. Sometimes I wondered if the complex structure of this film was necessary or beneficial (it was borrowed from the book). And I would liked to have known more about Francois as an adult. But these characters are captivating and their story is affecting.

The DVD (Strand Releasing 2009): The film is in French with English subtitles that cannot be turned off. The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer.",1237507200,19,1785,4.9072847682119205
3147463,5,B0015UWYOO,"Claude Miller has created one of the more challenging and intensely human dramas about World War II in his film UN SECRET (A SECRET). Though one of many stories about the plight of Jews during the events that led up to and exploded into WW II, Miller's story is less about the cruel destiny of the Jews in Hitler's plundering of Europe than it is a study of a few individuals who struggled with their identity in the face of probable extermination.

Based on a true story in Phillippe Grimbert's novel by the same name, UN SECRET gracefully and artistically draws the viewer into the psyche of the narrator Franois Grimbert (played at ages 7, 14 and 37 by Valentin Vigourt, Quentin Dubuis, and Matthew Almaric) whose relationship to his father Maxime (Patrick Bruel) has always been strained. The story winds from contemporary time, to the period in France before WW II, through the horrors of the Holocaust, and the years of rebuilding following the war.

Maxime `Grinberg' (Patrick Bruel) marries Hannah (Ludvine Sagnier) in a beautiful Jewish wedding. Hannah's brother is married to a brilliant athlete Tania (Cecile De France) and even at the wedding the equally athletic Maxime has eyes for Tania. All possible conflicts seem to diminish when Maxime and Hannah have a son, Simon (Orlando Nicoletti) who develops into a naturally gifted athlete - the joy of Maxime's life. As WW II approaches the Jews of Paris are instructed to wear their yellow Star of David patches, and while Hannah feels pride in her ancestry, Maxime refuses to be `labeled' and defies the ruling. When the SS come to transport Jews out of Paris, Hannah and Simon are removed to a camp while Maxime manages to stay in Paris with a new French name. Popular as a fashion model and designer, Tania is able to stay unnoticed as a Jew also, but her husband is off to war and extermination. Maxime and Tania learn of their families' demise and bond, eventually marrying using French names (Grimberg becomes Grimbert), join the Catholic Church and have a son - Franois - who is nothing like Simon nor does he know of his father's rejection of him as a poor comparison to the perfect Simon But as the years pass Franois discovers his family's past and a reconciliation with his Jewish heritage confronts him. How the maturing Franois ultimately relates to his distant father brings closure to the story.

The cast is excellent, gifted actors all, especially in some of the lesser roles (eg. the ever-present Louise (Julie Depardieu). Claude Miller's recreation of time lapses is successfully highlighted by interchanging black and white with color photography (by cinematographer Grard de Battista) and the changing moods of the story are greatly enhanced by the musical score by Zibigniew Preisner. UN SECRET, then, is a stunning work that explains many aspects of the varying responses of Jews to that horrid period of history designed by Hitler. It is a deeply satisfying and profoundly moving film. In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, March 09",1236902400,14,3045,4.90873786407767

The movie opens on the everyday life of a Parisian couple with a kid (a boy) after World War II. The boy is narrating the story as we move slowly in the plot. He is not that good in sports while both of his parents are really athletic. This is a significant detail. We feel that something is happening or happened in the past because during the first half hour, the whole plot is slow and puts the spectator in such a ""malaise"" that you are tempted to fast forward in order to understand what's going on. Don't do that!! Let the characters develop. You will be rewarded!

I was anxious to see what the role is for Ludivine Sagnier. I personally think that she is one of the best actrice worldwide. Period. Finally she appears half way through the movie and her presence is just overwhelming. She takes over the movie and SHE IS the movie all the way to the end.

3147485,5,B0015UWYOO,"'Un Secret' is a multi-layered movie that deals with myriad themes. The central character is Francois Grimbert who has always had a rather distant relationship with his father Maxime [Patrick Bruel]. As a young boy, Francois is not keen on sports and appears rather frail [he was a four lb baby] and very unlike his athletic father and swim champion mother Tania [Cecile de france]. His young mind conjures a phantom brother that is very athletic and strong, driving his parents to distraction. When Francois discovers a toy in the family attic, secrets long hidden begin to unravel, thanks mostly to a long-time family friend, Louise [Julie Depardieu] who reveals all that she knows.

Told via a series of flashbacks, the story unfolds. Ironically, the flashbacks to the past are portrayed in color, and the present [where the now mature Francois goes to meet his old dad] is in black and white. This is ideal as in this story, the past is of the most significance. As the 15-year-old Francois learns, his 'imaginary' brother of childhood was very much real, and was called Simon, much beloved by his father Maxime, and his mother Hannah [Maxime's first wife]. As the story progresses, we learn of a complex love triangle, involving Maxime, Hannah, and Tania. Maxime first sets eyes on the gorgeous, blonde Tania at his wedding to Hannah. At the time, Tania is married to Hannah's brother, but when the Nazis begin expanding their power across Europe, Tania's husband becomes a prisoner of war and this brings Tania closer to Maxime and his family, which now includes the young Simon. As the Nazis occupy France, Maxime refuses to wear the yellow star, turning his back on his Jewish identity, much to the chagrin of Hannah, who is proud of her heritage. Hannah also slowly realizes to her horror that Maxime desires Tania, and this realization later plays a tragic role in shaping the ultimate destiny of Hannah and Simon.

The plot here may come across as incredibly convoluted, yet despite the many layerings to the story, conveyed by the frequent flashbacks, the plot flows well, almost seamless, and I could easily follow the stories of the main characters.

This is a riveting human drama that not only portrays the complexities of love and relationships, but also shows how the French Jews, as portrayed by Maxime, his family and close friends were affected by the Nazi occupation of France, and how the French government basically turned its back on its Jewish citizens.

3381953,4,B0015UWYOO,"""Un Secret,"" (""A Secret""), (2007) is a French movie, a dramatic evocation of World War II, and the Holocaust directed at Jews as it was played out in that Gallic country.  It utilizes a flashback technique to tell the story of one particular family, the Grimberts, and, interestingly enough, gives us the scenes of current life in black and white; the WWII scenes in color.  It's apparently based on a true story, by Philippe Grimbert.  Claude Miller directs this engrossing drama about a Jewish boy in post-World War II Paris who stumbles upon a mysterious toy in the attic, exposing his family's secret dark past and how it survived Nazi atrocities. It asks the question: can the young boy grasp the devastating truth, or will it drive him deeper into his personal fantasy world?

It's a thoughtful, meditative film, in which action comes slowly, and many of the more important happenings occur off-screen.  However, it is telling a unique, individual story of people caught up in the war and the Holocaust, just when some of us probably thought there was no more to be said on that subject. The acting is top-rate, with the beauteous Ccile De France as Tania Stirn, champion swimmer/former Chanel model, as the boy's mother; Julie Depardieu, as Louise, family friend and massage specialist; Patrick Bruel as Maxime Nathan Grinberg/Grimbert, a businessman, the boy's father.  Ludivine Sagnier turns in quite a performance as Hannah Golda Stirn / Grinberg , Maxime's first wife.  Mathieu Amalric plays the older Maxime. . There are, in fact, rather a lot of characters, which the film expects us to sort out; I was sometimes a bit confused between them. There is, however, no mistaking the sensuous longing tango that Tania and Maxime dance in the disastrous days of WWII.  I found these scenes among the sexiest I've ever seen in film; and, to me, the movie had great emotional power, but its meditative quality may not suit everyone.",1287187200,3,1936,4.89908256880734
3381954,3,B0015UWYOO,"A much too long film with an interesting premise, but one that has been touched on several times before in French cinema--i.e. someone uncovering, ""What really happened"" to one's family during a period of nationalistic bigotry, collaboration, and deadly religious persecution.  Nonetheless, the acting is fine and the period costumes impeccable.  Go for it if you're specifically interested in this historical era.",1264550400,3,414,5.661290322580645
3381955,5,B0015UWYOO,"I borrow movies from our libraries. They have a good selection of French films. Just finished watching it today. There is a typical French style of storytelling--nothing too direct, always something left unsaid or about to be said. The excellent touch was using color for the past and black and white for the present. Conventional wisdom dictates that color for the present scenes and to signify something of the past/or dream, use black and white. The director/producer sent a subtle message by reversing the order. Also of note the movie's not over using the Jewish issues--rather using Jewish experience as a backdrop to draw a larger sketch of universal human psyche, with color of love, jealousy, envy, romance, hurt feelings of a neglected child, the paradox of love and passion, guilt--a lot of things said in a rather short time, very eloquently. The narrative of the movie was of matter of fact style. I find it amusing how casually, yet necessarily, French movies show the force of eros and sensuality. Look at the massage session when the family friend gives the female main character a massage. Speaking of erotic scence, it was very well-done--not through groins and groping. But through the eyes of a male and female. the longing and surrender, the animal desire in silence, the expression of mutual understanding of two bodies-expressed through minimum of sound and physical actions.
The music was good--nostalgic. I do not understand French, but got the vibe of being in Paris, with cobblestone street and the normal, spontaneous human friction. The movie will also interest psychologists--it shows how a shadow is created in someone's mind through repression and denial. What I find most interesting is that the humanness of each character was the profound theme in every scene. The political and social issues were peripheral--as if it was there and the producer had nothing to do with it, and he did not want to send any socio-political, even cultural message for that matter, through this movie. What he/she wanted is to tell a neat story of few lives centered on few points on the historical canvas. Of course, tragedy of WW-II was unavoidable, but to me, the lives came foremost.
Well, a good show, for a French movie, which to me are often depressive.",1261180800,2,2274,4.971128608923885
3381956,4,B0015UWYOO,"The beauty of this film's tragic story is that it is based on a true story.  Francois, a protagonist of the movie explains his strained relationship with his father by looking back at the family history.  His father and his mother were young and married during WWII.  But the circumstances under which they got together are monumentally tragic.

His father Maxime was married to a young woman Hannah with whom he has a young son Simon.  Simon was liked, strong, athletic, adored by all friends and family.  Hannah's brother Robert is married to a stunningly beautiful and athletic Tania that is the source of Maxime's emotional torment and almost uncontrollable sexual desire.  Maxime is a gymnast and Tania's athleticism in an instant attraction.  But he is also a tomcat, kind of man who likes other women and his attraction to Tania does not go unnoticed.  Through a string of tragic coincidences, Hannah decides to declare to authorities that she is Jewish and before long she and her son are deported to a concentration camp.  As Tania's husband also dies as a prisoner of war while fighting for the French Army, the two are free to finally be together.

It is their union that produces a fragile, young boy who is sensitive, kind and physically fragile which almost seems like a punishment for both Maxime and Tania who are (physically) quite the opposite.  It is a kind of story that would not have a happy ending at any time, but it gives a completely new dimension to it when applied to the anti-semitic times in France during Vichy government rule and another woman's decision to rather die with her child than have her life spared and spent in humiliation and heartache.",1250812800,,1681,4.758620689655173
3381957,4,B0015UWYOO,"Director Claude Miller's memorable film demonstrates the conflicts that develop when people masquerade through their lives. The opening scene, filmed in what is meant to evoke Populuxe-era technicolor, is shot at a swimming pool where whiny little Simon becomes chilled while his spectacular mom Tania (Cecile de France) demonstrates her prowess in the water.

Then we meet Simon's dad, Maxime (Patrick Bruel), who tries to teach the kid elements of gymnastics, to no avail.

Then the kid, poking around in the attic, discovers this toy doggie, and wants to know what it means. Will he find out? Of course!

Eventually, the movie cuts to Simon at 15 (in 1962), and then to 1985 where (in black and white sequences), now played by Mathieu Amalric, he is dispatched to retrieve his dad, who's gone on a walkabout after his dog, who he's let run without a leash, gets killed by a car.

Soon, we learn what part of the secret is: the family's Jewish. Now, in pre-war scenes, we find ourselves at a Jewish wedding where Maxime is marrying Hannah (Ludivine Sagnier). At the wedding, Hannah (Sagnier's hair is red for the part) glows. She has a blissed-out smile on her face. But Maxime already is making eyes at Tania.

When France is occupied, most of the family proudly affirms its Jewishness by donning the yellow star (it actually makes sense to them to do so!), but Maxime refuses.

Eventually, with forged papers, in groups, the family plans an escape from occupied France to Vichy France. Maxime goes first, and is joined by Tania. Still in Paris, waiting for her chance, by this time Hannah has become a total mess. The perpetual smile has been replaced by perpetual sorrow, even as the child they have (also named Simon) develops the athletic prowess the future Simon will not possess. And then as Hannah and Simon arrive near the border, the rest of the secret is revealed. And although by then you'll pretty much have figured it out what will happen, you'll still be overwhelmed when you learn how it happened.

The movie's touching, thoughtful, and well acted: hat tips to de France, Amalric, and Bruel; and props to Sagnier--this hottest of hotties (""The Swimming Pool,"" ""A Girl Cut in Two"") really tones it down and manages to create a character you can believe in.",1239753600,,2273,4.783163265306122
3381958,5,B0015UWYOO,"'A Secret' is a multi-layered movie that deals with myriad themes. The central character is Francois Grimbert  who has always had a rather distant relationship with his father Maxime [Patrick Bruel]. As a young boy, Francois is not keen on sports and appears rather frail [he was a four lb baby] and very unlike his athletic father and swim champion mother Tania [Cecile de france]. His young mind conjures a phantom brother that is very athletic and strong, driving his parents to distraction. When Francois discovers a toy in the family attic, secrets long hidden begin to unravel, thanks mostly to a long-time family friend, Louise [Julie Depardieu] who reveals all that she knows.

Told via a series of flashbacks, the story unfolds. Ironically, the flashbacks to the past are portrayed in color, and the present [where the now mature Francois goes to meet his old dad] is in black and white. This is ideal as in this story, the past is of the most significance. As the 15-year-old Francois learns, his 'imaginary' brother of childhood was very much real, and was called Simon, much beloved by his father Maxime, and his mother Hannah [Maxime's first wife]. As the story progresses, we learn of a complex love triangle, involving Maxime, Hannah, and Tania. Maxime first sets eyes on the gorgeous, blonde Tania at his wedding to Hannah. At the time, Tania is married to Hannah's brother, but when the Nazis begin expanding their power across Europe, Tania's husband becomes a prisoner of war and this brings Tania closer to Maxime and his family, which now includes the young Simon. As the Nazis occupy France, Maxime refuses to wear the yellow star, turning his back on his Jewish identity, much to the chagrin of Hannah, who is proud of her heritage.  Hannah also slowly realizes to her horror that Maxime desires Tania, and this realization later plays a tragic role in shaping the ultimate destiny of Hannah and Simon.

The plot here may come across as incredibly convoluted, yet despite the many layerings to the story, conveyed by the frequent flashbacks, the plot flows well, almost seamless, and I could easily follow the stories of the main characters.

This is a riveting human drama that not only portrays the complexities of love and relationships, but also shows how the French Jews, as portrayed by Maxime, his family and close friends were affected by the Nazi occupation of France, and how the French government basically turned its back on its Jewish citizens. Final verdict:  a well-made Holocaust-themed human drama.",1238630400,32,2538,4.932084309133489
3381959,4,B0015UWYOO,"""A Secret"" (Un Secret) is a World War II drama based on the novel of the same name by Phillipe Grimbert, which has also been published under the title ""Memory"". It has a complex time structure, shifting between 4 different time periods in the life of Francois Grimbert and the earlier lives of his parents during the War. Seven-year-old Francois (Valentin Vigourt) is frail, reclusive boy living in the shadow of his athletic father Maxime (Patrick Bruel) and beautiful mother Tania (Cecile De France) in 1955 Paris. He finds a stuffed animal in the attic one day that elicits strong and inexplicable reactions from his parents. Seven years later, his neighbor and longtime family friend Louise (Julie Depardieu) tells him the long-suppressed story of his parents' past that puts his life in a new context.

A lot of films have been made about the struggles of French Jews during World War II. Every time I see one, I think it's going to be like all the others. But I'm usually wrong. For some reason, this subject has produced great cinema in France. There is always a restraint in how these stories are told, and the characters are strong enough to engage the audience's interest, yet ordinary enough to represent whole communities. ""A Secret"" is no exception. Maxime, Tania, Louise, and, later, Hannah (Ludivine Sagnier) are vibrant, sympathetic people no matter what they do. Sometimes I wondered if the complex structure of this film was necessary or beneficial (it was borrowed from the book). And I would liked to have known more about Francois as an adult. But these characters are captivating and their story is affecting.

The DVD (Strand Releasing 2009): The film is in French with English subtitles that cannot be turned off. The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer.",1237507200,19,1785,4.9072847682119205
3381960,5,B0015UWYOO,"Claude Miller has created one of the more challenging and intensely human dramas about World War II in his film UN SECRET (A SECRET). Though one of many stories about the plight of Jews during the events that led up to and exploded into WW II, Miller's story is less about the cruel destiny of the Jews in Hitler's plundering of Europe than it is a study of a few individuals who struggled with their identity in the face of probable extermination.

Based on a true story in Phillippe Grimbert's novel by the same name, UN SECRET gracefully and artistically draws the viewer into the psyche of the narrator Franois Grimbert (played at ages 7, 14 and 37 by Valentin Vigourt, Quentin Dubuis, and Matthew Almaric) whose relationship to his father Maxime (Patrick Bruel) has always been strained. The story winds from contemporary time, to the period in France before WW II, through the horrors of the Holocaust, and the years of rebuilding following the war.

Maxime `Grinberg' (Patrick Bruel) marries Hannah (Ludvine Sagnier) in a beautiful Jewish wedding. Hannah's brother is married to a brilliant athlete Tania (Cecile De France) and even at the wedding the equally athletic Maxime has eyes for Tania. All possible conflicts seem to diminish when Maxime and Hannah have a son, Simon (Orlando Nicoletti) who develops into a naturally gifted athlete - the joy of Maxime's life. As WW II approaches the Jews of Paris are instructed to wear their yellow Star of David patches, and while Hannah feels pride in her ancestry, Maxime refuses to be `labeled' and defies the ruling. When the SS come to transport Jews out of Paris, Hannah and Simon are removed to a camp while Maxime manages to stay in Paris with a new French name. Popular as a fashion model and designer, Tania is able to stay unnoticed as a Jew also, but her husband is off to war and extermination. Maxime and Tania learn of their families' demise and bond, eventually marrying using French names (Grimberg becomes Grimbert), join the Catholic Church and have a son - Franois - who is nothing like Simon nor does he know of his father's rejection of him as a poor comparison to the perfect Simon But as the years pass Franois discovers his family's past and a reconciliation with his Jewish heritage confronts him. How the maturing Franois ultimately relates to his distant father brings closure to the story.

The cast is excellent, gifted actors all, especially in some of the lesser roles (eg. the ever-present Louise (Julie Depardieu). Claude Miller's recreation of time lapses is successfully highlighted by interchanging black and white with color photography (by cinematographer Grard de Battista) and the changing moods of the story are greatly enhanced by the musical score by Zibigniew Preisner. UN SECRET, then, is a stunning work that explains many aspects of the varying responses of Jews to that horrid period of history designed by Hitler. It is a deeply satisfying and profoundly moving film. In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, March 09",1236902400,14,3045,4.90873786407767

The movie opens on the everyday life of a Parisian couple with a kid (a boy) after World War II. The boy is narrating the story as we move slowly in the plot. He is not that good in sports while both of his parents are really athletic. This is a significant detail. We feel that something is happening or happened in the past because during the first half hour, the whole plot is slow and puts the spectator in such a ""malaise"" that you are tempted to fast forward in order to understand what's going on.

I was anxious to see what the role is for Ludivine Sagnier. I personally think that she is one of the best actrice worldwide. Period. Finally she appears half way through the movie and her presence is just overwhelming. She takes over the movie and SHE IS the movie all the way to the end.

3381982,5,B0015UWYOO,"'Un Secret' is a multi-layered movie that deals with myriad themes. The central character is Francois Grimbert who has always had a rather distant relationship with his father Maxime [Patrick Bruel]. As a young boy, Francois is not keen on sports and appears rather frail [he was a four lb baby] and very unlike his athletic father and swim champion mother Tania [Cecile de france]. His young mind conjures a phantom brother that is very athletic and strong, driving his parents to distraction. When Francois discovers a toy in the family attic, secrets long hidden begin to unravel, thanks mostly to a long-time family friend, Louise [Julie Depardieu] who reveals all that she knows.

Told via a series of flashbacks, the story unfolds. Ironically, the flashbacks to the past are portrayed in color, and the present [where the now mature Francois goes to meet his old dad] is in black and white. This is ideal as in this story, the past is of the most significance. As the 15-year-old Francois learns, his 'imaginary' brother of childhood was very much real, and was called Simon, much beloved by his father Maxime, and his mother Hannah [Maxime's first wife]. As the story progresses, we learn of a complex love triangle, involving Maxime, Hannah, and Tania. Maxime first sets eyes on the gorgeous, blonde Tania at his wedding to Hannah. At the time, Tania is married to Hannah's brother, but when the Nazis begin expanding their power across Europe, Tania's husband becomes a prisoner of war and this brings Tania closer to Maxime and his family, which now includes the young Simon. As the Nazis occupy France, Maxime refuses to wear the yellow star, turning his back on his Jewish identity, much to the chagrin of Hannah, who is proud of her heritage. Hannah also slowly realizes to her horror that Maxime desires Tania, and this realization later plays a tragic role in shaping the ultimate destiny of Hannah and Simon.

The plot here may come across as incredibly convoluted, yet despite the many layerings to the story, conveyed by the frequent flashbacks, the plot flows well, almost seamless, and I could easily follow the stories of the main characters.

This is a riveting human drama that not only portrays the complexities of love and relationships, but also shows how the French Jews, as portrayed by Maxime, his family and close friends were affected by the Nazi occupation of France, and how the French government basically turned its back on its Jewish citizens.
