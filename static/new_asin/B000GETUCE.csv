8131030,5,B000GETUCE,Very cool and very rare documentary from the '70's. Highlights is the great footage of both Benny Urquidez and Japanese kickboxing legend Toshio Fujiwara. Old school Puroresu fans will dig the great footage of Antonio Inoki and the behind the scenes training at the old New Japan Dojo. Fans of this documentary would also enjoy Fighting Black Kings- a Kyokushin Kai Karate documentary made by what appears to be the same people.,1324598400,,428,4.958333333333333

This is a look at the men whole made the `square ring' their legacy including Ali,Inoki,Benny the Jet Urquidez,Rikidozan and many more.

This is a japanese piece filmed in the `70's in Japan.

Many fighters travelled there(and still do so today)where the fight game is most respected than anywhere else on earth.

There's a great section on Benny where he takes out guys with a superb spin kick to the liver. One guy gets dusted with a perfectly executed judo throw!

The bonus features are also amazing.

First there's a section with deleted scenes from the japan version of this film. It's got many of the same pieces so you might want to fast forward through this segment as it's rather long.

Next up is a long segment f Inoki fights including one against Oyama Karate fighter Willie Williams where both men wind up fighting outside the ring than in it.

This didn't look staged either. Williams seemed really angry.

There's got to be an hours worth of great fights.

But wait...there's more!!

The ladies get their share of the action too!

Amazons in Wrestling is another `70's docu with asian wrestlers.

Man have we come a long way!

Also included is more recent matches of ladies doing some great moves.

This segment like the mens bonus section is all in Japanese.

It's doubtful you can get through all this in one sitting.

There's about 5-6 hours of materials packed into 2 discs.",1159920000,3,1409,4.662601626016261
