1212484,3,B00000FYPB,"Don't listen to anyone who says the film is too slow.  The slow pace of the film captures the leisurely feel of 18th-century settings just as the slowness of 2001 captures the eeriness of space and prehistory.  Don't  listen to anyone who says the film is too cold.  Great passion lies just  beneath that icy surface, and it sometimes breaks out with great drama.  Don't listen to anyone who says that the film is highly regarded only  because of the director's name.  The film contains real brilliance.  The  final duelling scene deserves to be a cinematic classic, the choice of  music and its synchronicity with the action is sometimes almost  unbelievable -- not to mention perfect acting and stunning visuals.  The  characters are richly drawn.  Near the end of the film I am drawn into  identifying with both Barry and his estranged stepson.  This makes the  final duelling scene all the more tragic.  Well, then is there  anything wrong with this film?  Unfortunately, there is.  Barry Lyndon is  painted on a canvas of epic scale, but the subject matter is the rather  dreary life of an Irishman who made it big despite modest origins only to  fall into obscurity.  In other words, the epic proportions of the film do  not fit the modest subject matter.  If only Kubrick had stayed with his  original intention of making a film about Napoleon -- then we might have  had here the greatest film ever made!  At the very least, we would have had  another epic to place alongside Spartacus and 2001.  Nonetheless, the  brilliance in this film is real, and it is well worth repeated viewing.

**  The above is what I wrote about this film several years ago.  I have a higher opinion of it now.  The film operates at a very subtle level, and it requires the viewer to rise up to that level to appreciate it right.  But I won't change the number of stars, because Amazon's silly star system means nothing anyway.  For a very interesting review of this film, see [...]",936662400,8,1967,4.6209912536443145
1212485,5,B00000FYPB,"Barry Lyndon is Kurick's bleakest movie and one of his best. Although the DVD is better than the film transfer, I would have expected a grand epic like this on stereo surround and 2.35 widescreen, not 1.66 (which isn't too  far from standard, 1.33) Some scenes seem blurred, yet some are incredibly  sharp. These DVDs should have been given to MGM to transfer, because Warner  transfers are most of the time, poor. It's annoying to watch a great movie  like this in this form, because you keep wishing all of Kubrick's DVDs,  including this, were like 2001, which was the best transfer (from MGM)",933724800,2,596,4.6923076923076925
1212486,5,B00000FYPB,"Other writers have commented on the flim's sumptuous gorgeousness, its meticulous production values, its ground-breaking technical achievements in lighting--all true.  What's been almost  completely ignored is the uniform excellence of the supporting performaces  (from many of the same actors who appearred in ""A Clockwork  Orange"").  A chapter of biographical sketches of actors and  technicians would have been greatly appreciated. As for Ryan O'Neal,  well.... he is sort of the black hole at the center of the movie's  universe, but that's the idea, too.  Everyone else does a warm, rich job,  every other performance is as believeable as every shot.  You can  practically smell the scenes, whether they take place on the battlefield,  in the country, or the gambling parlor.
Granted, the movie does begin to  drag a bit near the end--a real problem for a piquaresque tale--but then it  picks up steam again and ironically seems to end too quickly.  One of the  longest scenes (the duel near the end) is absolutley compelling.",931737600,,1031,5.226993865030675
1212487,5,B00000FYPB,"The rise and fall of Redmond Barry (taken from Thackeray's novel) is a slow-paced, but richly detailed period piece.  Over three hours long with an intermission, this movie certainly won't be to everyones' taste, but I  found it mesmerizing.
It was fascinating how Kubrick took our young,  naive hero, and as the film progressed, made him less than likable.  By the  time the film winds down, you actual dislike this unfeeling rogue who is  out only to worm his way up the political ladder and doesn't care who he  steps on or hurts in the process.  Yet, surprisingly, when Barry does fall,  Kubrick allows us to feel the pain, leaving the viewer wishing things had  turned out differently.
Between 1 and 10, this lavish production with  near-perfect cinematography, gets a 9.  This is a Kubrick film.  Nothing  more needs to be said.  It is one-of-a-kind.  Kubrick's cold, dispassionate  filmaking, somehow makes the viewer feel a myriad of emotions, which is the  legacy this great filmaker left behind.",931392000,4,1005,4.916167664670659
1212488,5,B00000FYPB,"A deeply fascinating, though not very comforting period drama, Barry Lyndon is an immensely detailed masterpiece that requires profound attention for all three hours it takes the story to unfold, but also proves  very rewarding and memorable at the end. There are many things in the movie  that look downright unpleasant and even disgusting. The aristocratic  hypocrisy under the mask of good manners, the weakness of character of many  key figures (including the protagonist himself) - all this hardly makes for  a movie which would be entertaining in a conventional sense. On the other  hand, the honesty with which Kubrick transforms this particular adventure  into a period piece of utmost importance is breathtaking, and the visual  style of the film earn it the merit of being one of the most gorgeous  movies ever made. Certainly not a movie to see as a substitute for the  latest romantic comedy that's out of stock, Barry Lyndon is, despite (and  maybe because of) this, one of the most wonderful cinematic experiences one  can imagine. A work like this one gives a good name to cinematography  itself.",929491200,21,1111,5.005464480874317

1212551,4,B00000FYPB,"Wow. Here's the Kubrick movie everybody used to love to hate. All this time later, though, and it stands as one of his best! Lush and beautiful and painterly beyond words. The use of natural light and candle-lit evening scenes is awe-inspiring. And a great story. He even managed to get a strong performance out of Ryan O'Neal.",1507593600,,327,4.655172413793103
1212552,5,B00000FYPB,"My first time to write a review on a movie.  This movie struck many chords in me.  I had just visited a museum to see 18th Century art, and that evening watched Barry Lyndon.  Timing was perfect!  It was like being in a museum where all the art pieces came to life.  Amazing acting, customs, landscape scenes, script.

1212556,3,B00000FYPB,"An odd movie, even for Stanley Kubrick, who I normally love. Kubrick was famous for making his actors do tons of takes I think largely in an effort to get them to distill their performances so as to not disturb the flow of his story. This worked fine in 2001 Space Odyssey but for two not so brilliant actors like O'Neal and Marissa Berenson it rendered their performances as nearly non-existent. And on the rare occasions where they did show some emotion it came out as false either because neither of them is Streep or Duvall or because it just seemed shrill after all of those flat performances. And I guess my problem with the performances of the actors is that for me, the movie needs a bit of a character, especially from O'Neill. One found it hard to care about his life one way or another. Having said all of that, Kubrick at his worst is still interesting and so I'd say it is worth a look. By the way, Barry Lyndon has moved way up in film historians evaluations so take that for what it's worth. I saw the movie when it first came out and felt pretty much the same way as I did all these years later. I was disappointed by that. I was hoping I just didn't get it the first time. Maybe I need to see it a third time?",1496016000,,1226,4.1991525423728815
1212557,5,B00000FYPB,"Barry Lyndon is an excellent film that tells the story of Victorian England through the eyes of an Irish adventurer. The direction by Stanley Kubrick is superb and he even gets a great performance out of Ryan O'Neal, who is a competent but not great movie actor. The costuming is outstanding and great efforts were taken to get the details correct. The set locations are great as well. The viewer of this film is placed in a very believable Europe of the late 18th and early 19th century. The pace is realistic to life in those times, so film goers who thrive on the frantic pace of modern life will probably not enjoy this film. The story is moved along by narration, which is an effective device in the hands of a master like Kubrick. All in all, I would rate this film as one of the best of the 1970's.",1495584000,,805,4.337748344370861

1212560,5,B00000FYPB,"i would like to preface this review with a statement of my bias - Barry Lyndon is the greatest film ever made. I've watched it countless times, it gets better with each viewing, and never fails to bring me to tears. The first time I watched it, I was not impressed. I found it boring and tedious. There were always particular scenes I couldn't get out of my head, and I gave it a second, third, fourth, etc... chance. Fans will tell you that this movie is sumptuously photographed. That's true, but that's not why you should watch it. The production quality is a product of Kubrick's reputation at the time. What makes this film a masterpiece is the story, the acting, and the musical choices. People knock Ryan O'Neal. I'm not too familiar with his other films. Kubrick didn't choose his actors for their strengths, but for their flaws. Barry Lyndon is an extremely flawed character, but he is sincere, and O'Neal pulls it off. Critics complain that Kubrick was cold, and this was his coldest film. They don't get it. Kubrick was a New Yorker, and New Yorkers must shrug off all adversity with a joke. Barry Lyndon is a black - the blackest - of comedies, but you won't pick that up on the first few viewings. It is the brutal story of all men and it ends badly. What's remarkable is, given Kubrick's success as filmmaker - he had final cut and an effectively unlimited budget - he deeply understood losers. Barry Lyndon is a loser, despite all his best efforts. His destiny is written before his story begins. One cannot fault Lyndon for any of his choices. This is a movie about what it means to live a life.",1493856000,7,1611,4.482993197278912

1212603,5,B00000FYPB,"Not much I can add to what has already been said, this is simply a beautiful movie.  It's pace is slow, yes, but that only gives you time to appreciate each scene and the images on screen in the same way you would spend time appreciating a painting.  This is a film to watch when you want to dive in and get lost for a few hours.",1490486400,2,329,3.8955223880597014
1212604,5,B00000FYPB,"You can admire or detest Kubrick's work: He gave us all cause to do both. As a civilian combat photographer in the Korean War, he got to experience the costs of conflict and directly transferred those experiences to much of his output, particularly in Spartacus, Paths of Glory, Doctor Strangelove, and Full Metal Jacket. In Barry Lyndon, conflict and its costs are generally on a less-grand scale, but whether the dueling death of Barry's father, the supposed duelling death of Barry's rival, the slaughters in Europe, or the more intimate battles in his new and fine home, human and inhumane violence, no matter how well accoutered, are the motifs of his existence.
Much has deservedly been made of the visual bravura of the film, especially the candle-lit scenes that are truly candle-lit. As great as Kubrick's  skills in visuals are, his skills in selecting the music -- the heartbeat -- of this work are equal. The Schubert trio might provide a seemingly anachronistic and modern pang, but the Handel sarabande orchestrates the slow, ritualistic, mechanistic, inevitable, late baroque dance of death that is Barry's life. As an aside, the baroque masters -- including Handel -- wrote music far better in character than was the general character of those who would have heard that music.
A few words about the casting of Ryan O'Neal: If Barry is handsome and charming, but consistently outplayed by others around him, who else could better as the occupier of that role than O'Neal?
The chances are slight of Barry Lyndon ever again being seen on theater screens. High definition home screens and high-definition DVD players improve the possibility of seeing and savoring this work.",1489881600,7,1686,5.043010752688172
1212605,5,B00000FYPB,"This is Kubrick's Scarface, his Boogie Nights, his Citizen Kane.

A grand ""rise and fall"" tale, centered on the theme of fathers and sons.  What first struck me about this story on how a boy became a man; he thought he found love but was out matched by someone in the military.  Instead of moping about it, he faced this military man, and eventually took a role in the military himself, leaving behind any romantic aspirations.

I love how the story portrays the importance of knowing yourself.

Another thing, this was like Kubrick's rough draft to a Napoleon film.  Precision in every shot, amazing props and great respect to the source material and its history.

But I just like movies.  I'm not a critic so what do I know.
About this there are some good parts in it.  And as far as acting goes this is probably Ryan O'Neal's best part.  And I think he should have gotten a best actor nomination.  The acting all the way around is good.  At one time O'Neal did some boxing and there is a boxing scene where he pretty much beat's the dog out of somebody.  And the battle scenes are good.

In my humble opinion:
This is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece.
I enjoy it more, and find more to enjoy with each viewing (about 10 times over a 20 year period)
My nomination, as of yet, for most accurate in spirit period-piece film. Which is probably why it wasn't as popular as other period-pieces, its depicts a past that is too strange to connect to for a popular audience.
Timing and score is perfect. I didn't realize that was what was making this slow movie so compelling until maybe the third time I watched it.
The actions, the acting, the camera moves, everything is timed to the score perfectly!
My favorite scenes change each time I see it. I really noticed this most recent viewing the scene where Barry first 'meets' Lady Lyndon across the gambling table. The camera, the production, the acting, the score are all working together to keep me captivated, and no one is talking!
I always say this is one the top three films I've seen, and it always jumps back to number one after I see it again.",1470614400,5,1141,4.653465346534653

This film lurches forward with a methodological determination at its own pace and is exquisitely matched by the astounding musical score.  It seems to move slightly slower than our modern attenuation allows for but it cannot be rushed as art cannot be rushed. This film depicts life in all of its rich, unredeemed and delicious adventurous complexity and contradiction. At points, it is expressive of noble simplicity and quiet grandeur. Contemplation of this film as art offers purgation to the psyche. Our task is to appreciate the beauty, not attempt to make the film conform to the busy world of our own preferences.

This film also conveys a sense of existential loss in a way that only art can express. This film is, in a sense, a mediation on loss just as life itself is a mediation on loss. We are forced to peer into the abyss and the nothing that lies beneath our world and come to face the vanity of existence and conceit of continuance.",1469404800,3,1003,4.725714285714286

1213010,1,B00000FYPB,"A very disappointing film in all major aspects.  It began  the last stage of Kubrick's career which I think was a serious decline.

I reviewed the film once after reading the book.  I really could not understand why he chose that book since most critics consider  it one of Thackeray's weaker efforts.  But if he was going to film it, since its a character driven piece, he needed to have two good actors to play the leads.  Although Kubrick liked saying he chose Ryan O'Neal freely, I have read that he had to take him since he was, at the time, in the top ten box office draws. And the studio would not finance a film this expensive without someone like that.  The only other actor on the list who fit the part was Redford, and he turned it down. I don't blame him since the film took something like 300 days to shoot.

The main criticism of the film is that its not really a film.  Its more like a pageant.  But beyond that, O'Neal and Marisa Berenson cannot make their  characters real or interesting.  Its also  slowly paced.  The film is built around painterly compositions done in close to natural light.  Kubrick got a very fast lens from Zeiss, and tried to shoot as many scenes as he could in natural light. OK, fine.  But there are many directors out there who can shoot pretty, painterly pictures.  That is not what made Kubrick a special director.  What made something like Dr. Strangelove, was the combination of wonderful acting, exceptionally sharp dialogue, striking lighting that was unnatural really, vivid character strokes, and adroit editing for suspense. This film has none of those qualities. Barry Lyndon has none of these.

Its boring.",1455321600,2,1661,4.623287671232877

Marisa Berenson is stunning as the sad Lady Lyndon and a perfect model for those brilliant costumes. And almost every other role, including the children, is played to perfection. (I did not however believe the strong willful older stepson, who wouldn't even cry after being whipped, would have grown into a blubber faced simp who is a coward. But I can forgive that.) Of course it is not for impatient ""bored"" modern audiences. It is chilly and remote intentionally. It plays like a novel from the era unfolding slowly and encompassing every detail along the way. It is close to being a masterpiece and one of my favorite Kubrick films. There is only one serious thing wrong with it and it's a fatal flaw. Ryan O'Neal. Sporadically his performance works, if you are very forgiving, but on the whole, it is a failure. You can see him trying hard which only makes the end result more tragic. Another actor with greater depth could have made something of the role. It's an unforgivable flaw that cannot be ignored.",1455062400,2,1137,4.771573604060913

I remember it as being water torture slow but seeing it again after all these years the picture plays much more quickly than I'd recalled. I think Barry Lyndon has been imitated so often since then that it doesn't seem as special any longer. The photography doesn't seem as striking and the performances seem broader than I recalled.

I believe Ryan O'Neal was miscast as 'Barry Lyndon' but, then again, I'm not a fan of O'Neal and believe he was miscast in almost everything he was in.  The film is deliberately very slow, graceful and pictographic.  The color is sepia tinted to lend to the late 18th Century mood.  The Barry Lyndon character is believable in his stupidity, greed and depravity.  He is so unlikeable that the scene with his dying 9 y.o. son is diminished.  Almost none of the characters are likable and, in that regard, they are more than human.  Still, most of us have at least some likable qualities but, in this film, virtually everyone is a cad or cadess [pardon my word-invention].

His wife is somewhat pitiable but she married an old man for his money and she cuckolded him for the callow Barry.  Therefore the woman is rendered shallow, greedy and immoral.  Her first son by the old man has some questionable qualities.  Scared to death he stands the potential lethal bullet of his rival.  Therefore he has some modicum of courage but he is also unlikeable as anyone can be.",1441238400,,1115,4.690721649484536
1213184,4,B00000FYPB,"Gorgeous costume drama in Ireland, England and Germany in 1770's atmosphere.  It is the time of King George III, second English king of the American colonies, and the colonies are revolting.

Kubrick the director spent two years and about $11 million in 1977 making a 180-minute film about a real Irish upstart, Stoney by name, whom William Makepeace renamed Redman Barry.  This novel was brought to the screen at great expense and great effort although Kubrick's true desire was to make a film about Napoleon. 10,000 soldiers and a thousand horses and all that....moolah was not forthcoming.

Ryan O'Neal is an American heartthrob cast into the role of a conniving and wicked Anglo Irish commoner determined to rise by hook or by crook.  And as a Peussian soldier and then later spy for the Berlin police force, he mixes with the aristocracy easily.  He speaks German and French and these are not subtitled for us as in old books.  You must simply know them, so thank Gof I do.  My French is half guessing but that is exactly what most English speaking audiences would have been doing in the time when french was taught in high schools, Spanish less so.

This is meant to be a morality play about the comeuppance of a man who has the morals of a snake and the manners of a mink.  He rapes the servants when he marries a wealthy widow called Lyndon.  He cheats at cards with an imposter Chevalier and makes huge sums at the game of being a mere servant, when both he and the Chevalier are in cahoots as fellow Irishman on the take.  He nonetheless continues to make regular spy reports on the Chevalier back to the Berlin police chief.  So he plays all sides to great advantage.

Behind Barry is a ferocious and determined Irish mother who wants desperately that her son rise in the world.  She is the true conniver and driving force.  She won't be satisfied until he gains a title to his own name since his fortune came through a widow whose first son hates his stepfather.  Barry gives away huge amounts of his wife's money to impress the right people but to no avail.

The horrible downturn in the last forty five minutes are very emotionally played.  When he loses his only son and child through his own hubris, he cannot console himself.  He becomes a drunk.  Then worse follows.

He and his mother return to Ireland in shame.

His ex wife and stepson take over the estate.

IMHO this morality play is a pleasure to watch.  However almost all in it who are cheated or deceived by Barry the Irishman are themselves complicit and willingly duped, especially his wealthy wife.

The real man Stoney was in fact the son of a Yorkshire man exiled to Ireland.  We true Irish would say the story is therefore s false premise to begin with as such a man would have no allegiance to the Irish or share their identity.

As for cheating at cards and with women, this was done at every social level for sport.  Barry's downfall was also his means to rising.  Had he not been a cheater and a liar, he would have not begun any endeavor of worth and died in poverty in Ireland anyway.

Many would say this film is too slow and dull by today's standards.  It is in its fine slow and stately manner that its charm lies.  The beautiful mansions of Germany and England are wonderful to see and the costumes and coaches gorgeous.

It depends what a viewer wants to see.  Read these reviews and you will know it is a Masterpiece classic.",1441238400,3,3420,4.496753246753247

1213256,4,B00000FYPB,"""Money, well timed and properly applied, can accomplish anything.""

In Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi epic ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" the director strove to tell a story almost entirely with visuals, aided by mostly classical orchestral background music.  I said in my review at the time that you could ""take any frame at random from the movie and hang it on your wall,"" it was that attractive.  In his 1975 historical epic ""Barry Lyndon,"" Kubrick attempts something similar, but with a little more plot, a tad more characterization, and certainly more dialogue.  Yet the underlying concept remains the same:  to create portraits worthy of hanging on the wall.

To the extent that Kubrick succeeds or fails in ""Barry Lyndon"" will depend, no doubt, upon the attitude of the viewer toward film as art.  These days it's hard to find many people willing to walk through a picture gallery with patience enough to look closely at the works on display.  Certainly, a lot of moviegoers would rather watch people shooting and punching one another, with stuff blowing up.  Although there's actually a little of this in ""Barry Lyndon,"" what Kubrick mainly wants to do is recreate the ambience of an eighteenth-century painting, and by filling each shot with a multitude of ravishing details he asks his audience to linger over them, ponder them, and appreciate them for themselves, not necessarily for what they represent.  It makes for a unique, if seemingly slow-paced movie experience.

Kubrick adapted the plot of ""Barry Lyndon"" from William Makepeace Thackeray's early novel ""The Luck of Barry Lyndon,"" 1844, later revised as ""The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon.""  Like Henry Fielding's ""Tom Jones,"" written many years before, Thackeray sets ""Barry Lyndon"" in the mid eighteenth century, beginning during the Seven Years' War when England and Prussia were contesting with France, Austria, Sweden, Russia, and other countries.  And like ""Tom Jones,"" which slightly predated the genre, Thackeray's work is a picaresque adventure, a satire following the exploits of a roguish hero of the common classes.  The difference between the film adaptations of these two books is that while Tony Richardson's ""Tom Jones"" (1963, MGM) is a frisky, rollicking, up-tempo romp, Kubrick's movie is entirely sedate, his intent more to stimulate the eye than the heart.  Moreover, Kubrick designed his characters, especially the protagonist played by Ryan O'Neal, to be more distant, O'Neal hardly registering an expression on his face in some three hours of story line.  This is not to suggest, however, that the film is entirely somber or that there isn't a sly wit present; the film in its subtle way is quite as ironic, quite as caustic, as Thackeray wished, a satire of morals and mores.

O'Neal stars as Redmond Barry, a young Irish commoner in his late teens when the story begins around 1757; he will be in his early fifties by the time the story ends in 1789.  As a youth he falls in love with his cousin, Nora, and becomes jealous when she becomes engaged to a captain in the British army (Leonard Rossiter).  Following a successful duel with the captain, Barry leaves the area for a while, fleeing to Dublin, being robbed by a pair of highwaymen en route, losing his horse and money.  Without a job or any means of sustenance, he does what most young men of his period did--he joins the army and goes to Europe to fight in the war.  There, he distinguishes himself in various ways before deserting, being found out, and eventually joining the Prussian army under a Capt. Potzdorf (Hardy Kruger).  This fellow Barry gets around.  Through a series of political maneuvers, he leaves the army, becomes friends with an important nobleman and gambler cheat (Patrick Magee), moves up in society, rapidly becomes a gentleman of position and means, meets and marries a countess (Marisa Berenson) for advantage, acquires a vast estate, and has a child.  I told you he gets around, and that's just the first half of the movie.  The countess's name is Lyndon, and so Redmond adopts her name.  The second part of the film recounts Redmond's downfall through philandering, gambling, and drink as the years go by.

As always, Kubrick attempts to explore some provocative themes, this time about people being used for selfish reasons and allowing themselves to be used.  Kubrick often exposed the selfish, ulterior motives of Mankind in his movies.  And so Barry the social-climbing fortune hunter becomes the business partner or the trophy husband or whatever else that will advance his own ends.  Most of this, however, unfolds in rather obvious fashion and to much less effect than the director's visual style.

The film is much too long at over three hours, but it may be the most ravishingly beautiful eye pleaser ever made for the screen.  Kubrick's camera leisurely scans an array of palaces, gardens, woods, lakes, streams, fields, lagoons, statuary, grand buildings, manicured lawns, reflecting pools, and opulent rooms covering location shooting in Ireland, England, and Germany.  To ensure that we keep our eyes on the scenery, the director purposely diffuses the individuality of the characters, even to having a continuous voice-over narration (Michael Hordern) to distance us further from any direct involvement with their personalities.  Although in ""2001"" Kubrick kept his audience entertained with a series of fanciful images and fantastical experiences, in ""Barry Lyndon"" he is able only to produce the landscape settings of Europe; and with characters as inaccessible as the friendly but drippy and naive Redmond Barry, it's not always enough to sustain the extreme length of the film.

""Fate had determined that he should leave none of his race behind him, and that he should finish his life poor, lonely and childless.""

Video:
Two minor issues about the appearance of the film first.  Kubrick meant for ""Barry Lyndon"" to communicate the Romantic spirit of Thackeray's novel, to evoke the tone of both the naturalistic and idealized landscape paintings of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and at the same time to look as lifelike as possible and create a series of truly ""moving pictures.""  To this end, the director shot as much of the film as possible under natural lighting conditions, even using special lens to capture the effect of natural light.  WB use a dual-layer BD50 and MPEG-4/AVC encoding to transfer the movie to Blu-ray in high definition, and while it does a good job, the end result may not please every eye.  There is an intentionally mild, moody, misty-eyed quality to the picture, not the bright gloss and glitter we usually observe in a Hollywood movie.

Second, Kubrick shot many of his films in a 1.37:1 aspect ratio, grudgingly matting them for widescreen theatrical release (1.66:1 or 1.77:1 for ""Barry Lyndon,"" the question not quite settled) and requesting that studios restore them to their original camera-negative dimensions when transferred to video.  Warners frame their Blu-ray release of ""Barry Lyndon"" at 1.78:1, which seems to be the Kubrick estate's preference (and despite the keep case listing it at 1.85:1).  Just as important, it fills up a 16x9 television screen, and the studio will not have to answer letters and phone calls from a thousand angry viewers wondering just what the heck those black areas are all about on the sides of their screen.  The movie's various aspect ratios (1.37:1, 1.66:1, 1.77:1, 1.78:1) have driven purists nuts, but the latest 1.78:1 ratio should keep peace in the general disc-buying community.

In any event, the BD picture quality looks fine, quite clean and free of extraneous signs of age in a transfer WB restored and remastered some years ago.  However, although free of age spots, lines, artifacts, and the like, the overall picture quality is, as I say, often intentionally veiled, the hues a bit subdued, the image sometimes very soft, especially long and medium shots, better in close-ups.  Colors look excellent, the greens of the hillsides, the reds of the uniforms, and such quite striking, though never brilliant.  The degree of inherent film grain present would suggest little or no filtering involved, so one has to conclude that the picture's softness is probably attributable to the print itself. Whether this approach works for you is another question.

Audio:
WB engineers use lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 to reproduce the soundtrack, mostly dialogue and prerecorded, commercially available recordings of Baroque and classical music, plus a little traditional Irish music by the Chieftains.  It is realistic, largely free of background noise, but sometimes more richer, warmer, and more robust than at other times, depending on the source; and it is often quite narrow in its stereo spread.  The rear channels, despite the 5.1 remix, see very little action except in delicate whispers of musical ambiance.

Extras:
As for bonus features, there's not much to speak of.  We get English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, and other subtitles; English, German, and Italian captions for the hearing impaired; a healthy forty-six scene selections; and a widescreen theatrical trailer in standard def.  The disc comes housed in a flimsy Eco-case.

Parting Thoughts:
Stanley Kubrick was a man of singular vision, and nowhere did he indulge his fancies more elaborately than in ""Barry Lyndon.""  More so than any of his other films, ""Barry Lyndon"" becomes the canvas for the master painter/director to satisfy illustratively his every artistic whim.  If his characters appear drained of any real blood, it's because Kubrick doesn't want them to get in the way of his visual scheme.  But one must tolerate these ""pictures at an exhibition"" with a certain amount of forbearance if one is to enjoy them.  Otherwise, the whole enterprise will come off as a tedious chore.  It is not a film one might view over and again for its excitement; it's a film one must savor now and again for its craftsmanship, its harmony, its radiance, and its sheer beauty.

1213259,5,B00000FYPB,"Barry Lyndon is Stanley Kubricks most elaborate historical epic, and Ryan ONeals best movie ever. Based on the novel by James Makepeace Thackeray, Barry Lyndon is a lower class rogue who makes his way into the British aristocracy through a series of clever maneuvers and impostures, finally taking the hand of a wealthy widow in marriage, which leads to his, and the familys downfall.

The production values of this film are extraordinary  elaborate costumes, wigs and the gentlemanly makeup of the late 1700s, with many scenes being filmed in natural indoor light, both day and nighteven candlelight, which required some bold cinematic advances to accomplish in 1975, resulting in many scenes that are as beautiful as some paintings of the eighteenth century--eventually resulting in an Oscar for cinematography.

Kubrick was able to capture not only the visual splendor of the time, but the bitter interplay of Thackerays characters as well. It is not a happy story, but a truly great motion picture filmed on a grand scale.",1431820800,2,1026,5.131736526946108
1213270,5,B00000FYPB,"With ornate imagery reminiscent of paintings from the story's 18th century period, Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel depicts the rise and fall of a sensitive rogue in the British aristocracy. Barry Lyndon is a period film starring Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee and Hardy Krger. It was written, produced, and directed by Kubrick. It is based on the novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray which recounts the exploits of a fictional 18th century Irish adventurer.

Young Irishman Redmond Barry leaves home to seek his fortune after apparently killing an English officer in a duel. Through a series of mishaps and accidents, Barry winds up fighting with the Prussian army in the Seven Years' War under the command of Capt. Potzdorf; at war's end, Potzdorf enlists Barry to spy on a shady Chevalier. Instead, Barry joins up with the Irish Chevalier to flee Prussia and live as gamblers among Europe's elite. Wishing to climb even higher, Barry soon meets the beautiful Lady Lyndon, marrying her for her fortune after her older titled husband dies. Her son Lord Bullingdon, however, despises the upstart Barry, and, regardless of how his mother may feel, sees to it that the re-named Barry Lyndon will never be able to stake his claim to the entrenched aristocracy.

In 1975 the world was at Stanley Kubrick's feet. His films Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and A Clockwork Orange, released in the previous dozen years, had provoked rapture and consternation--not merely in the film community, but in the culture at large. On the basis of that smashing hat trick, Kubrick was almost certainly the most famous film director of his generation, and absolutely the one most likely to rewire the collective mind of the movie audience. And what did this radical, at-least-20-years-ahead-of-his-time filmmaker give the world in 1975? A stately, three-hour costume drama that now stands as one of his greatest and most savagely ironic films, not to mention one of the few period pieces on celluloid so transporting that it seems to predate the invention of cameras. In addition to that,Ryan O'Neal's excellent performance captures the shallow opportunism endemic to the title character who is brought down as much by his own flaws as by the mores of the ordered social structure of 18th-century England. All of Kubrick's features look better now than when they were first released, but Barry Lyndon, which fared poorly at the box office in 1975, remains his most underrated. It may also be his greatest.",1430870400,3,2568,5.097387173396674
1213271,5,B00000FYPB,"Barry Lyndon is a true gem of a movie from the mid-seventies, courtesy of the legendary director, Stanley Kubrick. I'm not going to get into the plot here, so feel free to read other reviews. There are other things that are worthy of praise regarding this movie. First of all, the ability of Kubrick to be able to keep a viewer absorbed into an otherwise slow-moving film is a testament to cinematography. There are stunning images and accents with camera angles and lighting which keep the viewer's interest. At 3:03, this movie is quite the marathon, but its gentle and subtle approach, coupled with a nice narration, keep things flowing. Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson give unbelievable performances in their respective roles. Berenson is very believable in her role as an unhappy spouse. This movie is very emotional, and depicts a social climbing, tragic, flawed individual trying to find his way in this world. Another refreshing aspect of this movie is it's very subtle humor in many parts. This movie is very much welcome in my DVD/Blu Ray collection because it's a change of pace. Once in awhile, I need a western movie or something like this that's 18th century. I give Kubrick props for flexing his versatility muscles once again with this high quality classic. I say ""classic"" because it's a bit underrated, and should be given its due, despite winning some academy awards.

1213316,5,B00000FYPB,"In ""Barry Lyndon"" we have echoes of how Stanley Kubrick's great un- made project, a biopic of Napoleon, may have looked and felt. It would have been stately, as ""Barry Lyndon"" is throughout, with perfectly still shots that linger on faces, or very slow pans and zooms of impeccable, symmetrical sets. It would have been steeped in period details, as ""Barry Lyndon"" is with its Georgian turns of phrase (a high-society woman is ""a woman of great fortune and condition""; to sympathize with another's circumstances is to be ""sensible"" of them) and its impressive mounds of powdered hair and layers of makeup on both men and women. Classical music would have abounded, as it does in most Kubrick films and no less so here. There would have been warfare on the continent in which soldiers marched against each other in tight, colorful ranks, and intriguing marital relations. The latter might have demanded more sustained attention in the hypothetical Napoleon film than it receives in ""Barry Lyndon,"" where the wife seems forever on the cusp of transmitting some insightful commentary but remains unsatisfactorily cipherous. Had ""Napoleon"" been made, its lead character would have had a rise-and-fall arc quite similar to Barry's in spite of their very different historical significances (incalculable in Napoleon's case, non-existent in the case of the fictional Lyndon). As it happened, ""Barry Lyndon"" is the movie we have, and it is a very good one. No other Kubrick work received as many Oscars (four), all of these in recognition of the film's technical accomplishments. Yet among the director's many masterpieces it has had a relatively low public profile. Could calling it ""Napoleon"" have elevated it into the top tier of his oeuvre in the minds of many fans? The added aura of historical import would have helped, but probably not enough: though the film is very finely-wrought, it lacks the more obvious eye-popping abstractions of a ""2001"" or the overt improprieties of a ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"" with which the name Kubrick is and was associated.",1423267200,11,2070,5.091176470588235

Johnson this would be censored in Carter's and Ford's time. The music as is customary of any Kubrick's film is extraordinary, whether strictly lights is questionable in certain scenes although great to see, and a free license on a few art scenes. It stuck in my mind as such a commentary on those who deserted for the Prussians calling themselves bluecoats and to me as an American I was more patriotic to bluecoats. At the end, with ""kiss me"" I felt it also served to say Judas maybe someone who worked to get that for his people and maybe took it worse as a traitor than Pedro.

Surprisingly few viewers seem to be conscious of this, a fact that Kubrick may have anticipated. The only positive values of the characters stem from friendship or filial devotion. Thackeray's view of mankind was extremely cynical, and Kubrick seems to have found in this story a partner for his bitterness. The film is, without doubt, incredibly crafted. And it gives us a powerful statement, and something to think about. But it is, at its core, extremely cold-hearted and negative about our race.",1408320000,4,640,5.047169811320755
1213503,5,B00000FYPB,"I read the book many years ago and barely remember the details, but this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting and directing are so incredibly brilliant that I must say it's one of the top 20 films of all time for me. Ryan O'neil is brilliant as a feisty youth who is not always in control of his urges and emotions, which frequently lead him from one misadventure to another. And yet, his character Redmond Barry manages to survive the many ups and downs he is subjected to during the turmoil of Europe's many wars, and he manages to land himself into an entirely new role, that of a gentleman who marries into titled nobility, and from then on, it seems that all of Barry's past ills will be but a bad memory, erased by a brilliant future in high society, with a large state, influential friends, a beautiful noble lady as a wife and large sums of money at his disposal to do with as he wishes. But that is just the start of his downfall for the story relates well at the end, that whatever situation a man finds himself in, from rags to riches or whatever environment, he must first and foremost change himself from within before the rest of his life can change for the better as well.",1408320000,,1202,4.299559471365638

It was a grueling but tremendously satisfying experience and,of course, the results have well stood the test of time. I could rave for several lines about the lighting alone, not to mention the costumes, the stunning locations in Ireland, Germany and England and the soundtrack - but I won't.

1213526,5,B00000FYPB,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time and certainly my favorite Kubrick movie.  One of my pet peeves about some of the recent period movies (Keira Knightly's Pride and Prejudice, Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, etc) is that they purposely dumb down the subject matter in order to appeal to a broad/modern/teenage audience.  I don't expect movies to be accurate historical pieces, but it would be nice to see something that was made for an audience outside the 14 year old male demographic.  I think that this is one of the best (if not the best) movies you will see about the 18th century and one of only a handful that is actually (imo) better than the original source/novel.  Even if you are not aware of the technical achievements, each scene is like a work of fine 18th century art. They are filled with drama, tension, and a hillarious narrator that propels the films forward even if the pacing may seem lethargic. The film moves slowly so that we are able to linger in this magnificent world and marvel at the composition/color/light of each scene; Kubrick never asks the viewer to ""relate"" to Barry or Lady Lyndon - their inner life is for the most part, kept at a cool distance.  While some filmmakers have recently tried to humanize the likes of historical or fictional characters of the past by giving them anachronistic features, Kubrick enchants us into a world that we will NEVER relate to (I could be wrong, but some of these people may have been as wealthy and as powerful as the King himself)- yet  we simply can't stop watching and caring about them.",1398729600,,1577,4.634408602150538

1213570,5,B00000FYPB,"A film that was technically ahead of its time, Barry Lyndon was Stanley Kubricks desire to take the audience back in time to 1700s Britain. He used newly developed camera lenses that were previously used by NASA for space photography that he chose to use for the candle lit scenes. His unique compositions that make it look like you are viewing an 18th century painting and his storytelling sensibilities make this film a timeless masterpiece and one of the most beautiful films ever made.

Released in December of 1975, this is Kubricks most painfully human film with strong emotional power and brilliant performances. Some critics simply called it A boring film. Although it won four Oscars, it was a commercial bomb at the time. Stanley Kubrick was devastated and who could blame him? So much effort went into the making of this movie and for it to be ignored by audiences and hated by critics, one looks back at the film now and wonders, why? Kubrick would next make a more commercial but still personal film, The Shining (1980).

Although Kubrick never got to make his Napoleon film, this is close to what he wanted to achieve with that project. This is still one of my favorite films and I highly recommend it.",1395360000,5,1216,4.704225352112676

In truth, the story line is secondary to the primary purpose--to show off the art of composition, lighting, framing, design, and all the other elements of the visual arts.  Kubrik's deep knowledge of 18th and 19th century painting and of that era's music combine to form a visual and aural delight.

The third time I fell in love with it. Now I watch it at least once every year; this time for the first time in HD. This is as close to being a perfect movie as I can name. It's Tolstoyan in its sweep and character development (even the most minor characters are unforgettable), and Ryan O'Neal is better in this than in any other movie I've ever seen him in. And despite his becoming a rascal and finally, a thorough reprobate, he utterly redeemed himself in my eyes when he fired into the ground rather than shoot (and undoubtedly kill, given his expert marksmanship), his cowardly stepson. Bad as he becomes, he's at his worst only when thoroughly corrupted by the nobility, who are ultimately far more corrupt than he ever could be.",1393200000,5,988,4.651428571428571

I've never see a time period so perfectly evoked on film as Barry Lyndon. 18th century England is brought alive through extraordinary candle-lit cinematography.

The film's long static shots where characters seem poised as if in a painting is obviously intended to show that the wealthy people in Kubrick's film have no more depth than the elegant painting hanging in their mansions.

Lyndon is a rather emotional rip-off and con man who escapes his native Ireland after he ""kills"" a British officer over a woman...his cousin...whom they both love. Barry is partially dominated by his mother and by his own stupidity. He learns nothing about himself, responsibility, women..or horses for that matter! Later he is at considerable odds with his step-son, Lord Bullington, both as a child and later as an adult. Barry comes from poverty, moves into riches, and goes back to poverty once again. Set in the Georgian era of England and the war with Napoleon, Barry travels across war-torn Europe. There are several battle scenes and a great deal of colorful marching. The scenery, both real and recreated, is stunning; the music rousing. It may be a little long in some places (I think I could easily cut 30 minutes from this film with a little creative editing), but it is a real spectacle for the eyes and ears.

1213687,5,B00000FYPB,"Among serious Stanleyphiles the most debated question has to be, ""What's your favorite Kubrick film?"" Barry Lyndon is mine.  I saw the movie when it was first released in theaters and, like my initial reaction to many of SK's films, it took a few years, and many viewings, to fully appreciate its greatness.  Watching Kubrick is not a passive experience; the director demands nearly as much commitment from his audience as he does from himself and his crew. Concerning Barry Lyndon, those less stout are likely to lose interest early on into the proceedings, owing either to the film's picaresque themes or, as in 2001, Kubrick's famously deliberate pacing.  Those patient enough to endure, however, will experience the director at the crest of his career, an artist in full command over every aspect of his craft.  Kubrick arranges each scene like a master painter bent before the canvas. Indeed, a painterly analogy seems particularly apt with Barry Lyndon, as Kubrick composes the first shot of almost every scene to mirror the idyllic stillness of an English landscape by Thomas Gainsborough or Antoine Watteau; it is only after slowly panning in that we are able to bear full witness to the ugly machinations of almost every character we encounter.  Kubrick seduces us with pretty pictures, then slaps us silly as scenes play out.  Wisely exchanging the flippant first-person tone of its source material for the observations  (written by Kubrick himself) of an omniscient narrator, brought to orotund life by the late Michael Hordern, the director still manages to stir our sympathies in favor of his flawed protagonist, delivered in a great, underrated performance by Ryan O'Neal at the peak of his prettiness. Barry manages to build a comfortable life for himself by taking advantage of nearly every person, and opportunity, he meets along the way; his quick wits and overall unscrupulousness give him the necessary means to overcome his humble origins and quickly ascend the social strata of his day.  Sadly, he has no idea what to do when he actually reaches the top, and his roguish nature ultimately betrays him and ensures his abject ruin.

Kubrick is often dismissed by his critics as being technically gifted but emotionally detached.  In some ways, Barry Lyndon epitomizes this familiar grievance; indeed, there are moments when  the constant panning starts to feel too calculated; we may even share the urge to casually reject the film's  deliberate pacing and the relentless coldness of  Kubrick's characters.  To succumb to the brilliance of Barry Lyndon one must come to admire Kubrick's merciless thoroughness moving beyond all the greasepaint and mannered affectations of the era, so that he might return to his favorite existential theme of universal indifference. Barry is not a bad man, in many ways he is much to be admired, but his doom is as certain as George the III's--and ours.  In the realm of King Stanley, we are all equal in the end.

Like all Kubrick films, the overall impact is made considerably greater through his use of a musical score, and Barry Lyndon's soundtrack is arguably the best of all his films.  Lush and elegiac, he uses a combination of well-known classical and baroque pieces to create a soundscape that is almost as vibrant as the images onscreen.  Barry's famously wordless seduction of Lady Lyndon looks nearly choreographed to the slow rhythm of Schubert's Trio in E Major; even more satisfying  is the inclusion of Vivaldi's Cello Concerto in E Minor during the film's more melancholic second half.",1374710400,18,3557,5.039249146757679

I've noticed a consensus among many critics that this film is overly long and ponderous in places; granted, there's three hours of it, but otherwise, I just don't know where these folks are coming from. While BARRY LYNDON is not one of Thackeray's better novels, the film version is one of those rare instances where Hollywood beats a classic author at his own game. This film feeds its audience a huge slice of human comedy/tragedy without ever being preachy or forced in any way.

1213893,5,B00000FYPB,"Even among fans of the late director Stanley Kubrick, ""Barry Lyndon"" can be a divisive subject, with some advocating for the brilliance of the film and others insisting it's the most boring thing Kubrick ever made. Check out this excerpt from an Amazon reviewer who gave it one star: "" ... 'Gone With the Wind' without any of the interesting bits. A boring film about Irish aristocracy, the only people who could possibly enjoy this movie are cinematographers and film snobs.""

Well put, even if he didn't like the film and even though I disagree. Since I'm not a cinematographer, I guess that must mean I'm a film snob. And a really SNOBBY snob, at that, for I absolutely ADORE this movie.

I will, admit, though, that it took a long time to grow on me. The darned thing IS awfully long, about three hours. And Kubrick's pacing, never all that quick (especially by modern standards) is just about glacial here. But this film is not an action flick; it's a study of character and mannerisms and class warfare. In the film, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), hardly an aristocrat, finds himself by virtue of fate cast into their company. He then embarks on a quest for power and riches, but finds it challenging, to say the least, to fit into this highly static, decidedly odd society.

No, the film is not florid; if ""Gone With the Wind"" is your thing, ""Barry Lyndon"" probably isn't. The mood IS quite chilly; this movie is far more observational than participatory -- that is, Kubrick is meticulous in documenting the lives these people lead but stands at a distance from his own material, refusing to offer any real judgement or conclusions regarding the proceedings. People who like Kubrick tend to like that stance, but he does take it to an extreme here, and I've shown this film to some friends only to see, in dismay, that it's driving them absolutely nuts. By the one-hour mark, I can always tell whether the person is enthralled or would rather go and get ice cream.

But the film has some marvelous touches. Marisa Berenson and O'Neal engage in a kiss that has to be one of the most memorable in screen history; Kubrick draws out the moment as if, instead of working with moving-picture frames, he is constructing the whole thing with paintbrushes.

The painting analogy is accurate, by the way, for the whole film. Kubrick wanted to photograph some indoor scenes using only candlelight. He realized this crazy idea partly through the use of one, perhaps two, rather old film cameras sent to him by the film studio. Assuming they were his to keep -- others believed they were lent, not given (!) -- Kubrick proceeded to alter the cameras permanently by having technicians fit them with Zeiss lenses, ultra-high-speed lenses originally developed for NASA! They warned him this would basically wreck the old camera housings, or rather make them useless for any other application -- once the lenses were installed, the cameras could not be restored to their orginal configurations. Kubrick told them to go ahead ... WITHOUT bothering to inform the studio as to what he was doing.

The result was a movie featuring some of the most beautiful images ever captured on film. Even detractors of ""Barry Lyndon"" agree that, visually, this is a landmark in cinema history.

""Lyndon"" also proved, once again, Kubrick's virtuosity; it was preceded by the incredibly violent ""A Clockwork Orange,"" released in 1971, and followed by ""The Shining,"" Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's third novel.

I heartily recommend the film, but only to those who still have not been seduced by the ultra-fast pace of our society now.",1348358400,5,3612,4.814516129032258
1213894,5,B00000FYPB,"Fantastic film devoid of all the rush and clutter of modern day movies. Kubrick knew when to move the camera and when to hold still often creating frames that look like something hanging on the best museum wall. This film also uses zooms---usually something good filmmakers avoid. But Kubrick often uses them to start tight on some object or person and then very slowly pulls back to reveal the larger world. Amazing film.

The story is darkly funny and tragic. Barry gets himself into all kinds of
unpleasant situations but this movie ranks as one of the master's greats. One of many.",1348012800,,585,4.735294117647059

Starring Ryan O'Neal as a lowly-bred Irish lad, whose impudence dares him to attempt sequestering himself into a higher station among the Peerage of England. Can you even begin to imagine such a thing? I wouldn't dream of spoiling this rich period piece which renders all other powder puff costume dramas obsolete. Filmed with a sophisticated lens Kubrick got from NASA, this film features the lowest F-stop in film history, for you photographers out there. It is mostly filmed in natural light, rendering sweeping shots which resemble a renaissance painting. Yet possibly the greatest thing about BARRY LYNDON is the fact that all the actors transcend their craft and present thoroughly realistic characters. I am beginning to suspect that is one of Kubrick's key strengths, his ability to somehow coerce actors into wholly transforming into their characters, lock, stock, and smoking barrel. If you've avoided seeing BARRY LYNDON on the assumption it is just another awful powder wig yawn fest, think again. This is Stanley Kubrick at his very best.",1347408000,5,1218,5.219387755102041

1213898,5,B00000FYPB,"It only dawned on me recently that this auteur's work throughout his life is entirely UNIQUE.......Different from Fellini, and so many other brilliant directors' work (and I confess not to have seen yet his entire oeuvre) EVERY singly movie from this brilliant artist is entirely different from the rest of his work.......This is the opinion of a cinema-dilettante, of course, not a specialist-------I guess that when it comes to ""technicalities"" there is much that is a ""continuity"" but subject matter, mood, historical context, mores--------the whole reason why we see a movie is turned upside down by this MONSTER of Imagination.......
First, the movie, a 3-hour haul, has you hesitating for awhile-------too much historical data, overwhelming you if you are not a history buff, and subtle details that escape a first-time view.......Not to worry, this is a movie to observe and richly discover more and more as you sit down repeatedly with, I am certain.....
A narrator is used, a most SOBER, aristocratic-sounding, deeply balanced and moral narrator that remains detached and does not offer anything but exposition----and yet enlightening words as well......Why a narrator?......I cannot figure it out yet, but the film is so complex at times, what with all its entrances and exits that perhaps Kubrick felt that the audiences' imagination would be advanced by the ""help"" it provides. And yet this is no ""run-of-the-mill"" narrator.....It almost sounds, quietly like the voice of a sage----dare I say the voice of a God....
The story?
Well, of course, the story.....SPOILERS!!!
O'neill plays what is unquestionably a good man from the ""provinces"", Irish, ambitious enough to get his life into such a complicated web of deceit, manipulation, greed, envy, ""megalomania"", social- climbing, so much of all this incremental ""evil"" presented in the most intelligent way so that the question at the end remains whether Lindon is indeed a cold manipulator or still a principled human being.
It is funny, because in many ways nothing has changed-------and nothing will, I dare say.
So much of his downfall comes to issues that are with us as vividly today as in the late 18th century......
SHOPPING (other people's money, that is), egotistical manouvres brought on by social climbing (the plight of the ""Nouveau-riche"") and the eternal issue of the tortured relationship between Fathers-in-law and angry, rightfully so children who stand to inherit while they see a passive mother do nothing, and the new father carrying on wildly, decimating a fortune.
Not to mention a beautiful new heir that is pitted against the previous one in so many subtle ways.
O'Neill is MAGNIFICENT in his role, and in what perhaps is a rather too quiet, inconspicuous part Marisa Berenson shines as well. Why Berenson did not go on to pursue a rich career of roles----the little she did tells you that at least when it came to a soignee woman filled with dignity she was so unforgettable-------is a very mysterious question. Perhaps she did not have to work.
Pictorially RICH, edited magnificently, the whole affair proceeds quietly, destroying ""innocent"" lives along the way in a most sober, cooly-detached way. This is no Hollywood melodrama, of course.
Lives filled with hope for JOY and beauty--------destroyed by the serendipity of chance, place, circumstance, and yes, perhaps to an extent, character.
Everyone is a suffering being, no one is really to blame, and yet DOOM comes to envelop us all......As close to our human existence as an artist can get------methodically, quietly, slightly ambiguously,offering us the whole of human nature in all its hopes and sad, pathetic ways that ""life"" plays on us...............
To be seen multiple times----it shall reward us more as we watch again and again........",1342656000,,3789,5.223316912972085

I've noticed a number of reviews of Kubrick films in general that are displaying both a low opinion of his work, and a complete misunderstanding of it's nature. I suspect a lot of this is simply fallout from the videogame-action-film-influenced crop of people that do the bulk of movie consumption these days, who simply don't appreciate the meticulous and carefully considered film making that Kubrick did. Many films today are about 20% set acting and 80% special effects\post production, in Kubrick's time it was the opposite. That being said, this is one of those films often described as a ""flawed masterpiece"", but there's really nothing flawed about it. Kubrick was a director who put tremendous effort into creating what he thought a film should be, so there are few flaws in his films, unless you consider his vision itself to be flawed. I think Barry Lyndon is one of his most interesting efforts, and probably the most meticulously accurate period film made at the time. The lighting effects are amazing, as is the recreation of not only period settings, costumes, uniforms, but period language and attitudes, something a lot of films get very wrong.

In der Tat, der Film wird in ruhigen Bilder erzhlt - die es aber in sich haben: die wunderbaren Kamera-Einstellung, Farbgestaltung, Landschaft etc aufgefallen.

Interessant ist nmlich, dass fr diesen Film eine neue Kameralinse verwendet wurde, die es erlaubte im natrlich Licht, sowie auch ""fast"" gnzlich mit Kerzenlicht erhellten Raum zu filmen. Dabei durften die Darstelleren wie bei der Szene beim Kartenspielen keine hektische Bewegungen machen, weil sonst die Flammen der Kerzen flackern wrden. Dies ergibt eine ganz neue Atmosphre die man bis dato noch nicht gesehen hat.

Fr die MTV-Generation mag der Film durchaus langweilig sein, aber ich finde, dank dem Drehbuch, den tollen Dialogen/Erzhlweise des Erzhlers und satirischen Zgen sehr gut gelungen und hat mich berraschenderweise, trotz der 180 minuten, kein bischen gelangweilt.

Trivia:

- Kameramann John Alcott hat ein Cameo: er schlft neben Ryan O'Neal und den zwei Girls whrend der Orgie.
- Vivian Kubrick (die Tochter von Stanley Kubrick), das kleine Mdchen, sitzt whrend der Zaubervorfhrung hinter der linken Schulter von Lady Lyndon.
- Der Film verschlang 300 Drehtage whrend einer Zeitspanne von 2 Jahren und das Budget schwoll auf 11 millionen Dollar an.
- der deutsche Wolf Kahler gibt hier sein Debt und war dann spter in ""Indiana Jones - Jger des verlorenen Schatzes"" mit dabei.

Now, I don't expect to find a wilted rose inside the cedar box that houses the disc... But I think displaying the film at its correct aspect ratio is ideal. They could have got some film historian to do the commentary for almost nothing had they tried. and lets not forget that the stanley kubrick archives is probably open to warners had they decided to pop in for twenty minutes and scan 12 or so items for a bonus feature. Its the greatest film kubrick ever made... And it looks like its fresh out of the bargain bin. I throw up in my mouth every time I see the sound of music sell for 80 bucks in a jumbo  set... or yawn inducing sword and sandal epics get the deluxe treatment... WHILE THIS FILM gets passed off as if it were a bonus feature on its OWN disc... But that makes no sense, This film HAS no bonus features. You get the idea. Completely worth the purchase... But shame on them just the same.",1332633600,8,1354,4.351778656126482
1213913,5,B00000FYPB,"I remember reading an article in Time magazine on this movie when it first came out in 1975.  Among the interesting technical aspects of Barry Lyndon was the large aperture lenses that allowed the filming of indoor scenes using only candlelight.  This technique imparted to these scenes an amber ambiance that evokes the Britain of the mid to late 1700's.  Also adding to the unique atmosphere of this film is the music of the traditional Irish instrumental ensemble ""The Chieftans.""  I especially love their piece ""Woman of Ireland.""

Stanley Kubrick tells a story that seems more deeply personal than those usually chosen by this director.  As the young Irishman makes his way in the world, he finds his way into the heart of a young and wealthy widow.  As the veteran of many love affairs, Lyndon does not find himself swayed by the affection of the widow.  Instead, he recognizes a financial and business opportunity and embarks on what might be called a marriage of convenience.  Accordingly, while enjoying the status conferred on him by this advantageous marriage, he does not properly return the genuine affection of his lovely wife, choosing instead to consort with women of low repute.  This treatment of his wife does not go unnoticed by the son of her first marriage, which sets the stage for tragedy.

In time, Lyndon's feelings for his wife change for the better, especially after she bears his child--a boy to whom Lyndon becomes completely devoted.  But the son from the first marriage will not forget Lyndon's early treatment of his mother, leading to a confrontation that provides the climax of this story.

I saw this movie as a graduate student with my best friend.  We often discussed this movie together.  My friend maintained that Lyndon was a ""rotter"" and would always remain such.  I believed that Lyndon had become a better person who developed a genuine love for his wife and child, and that he regretted his earlier misdeeds.  I invite you to see this movie and make your own determination!",1332028800,,2018,4.870967741935484
1213914,4,B00000FYPB,Barry Lyndon represented a huge step forward technically for Kubrick and the film is a masterpiece in many respects. There are scenes in it that are nothing short of majestic in their scope and setting. At times it is like looking at a great painting come to life. The story is a compelling drama based on Thackery's novel. There are moments where the marriage of picture and soundtrack may actually surpass that of any other film I've seen.  Other elements that are superb in this film are the costumes and the supporting cast is a vast and incredibly talented roster of character actors. This is a long film and the pacing may be slow to some but I was completely absorbed watching it recently after a span of almost 35 years since first viewing this when it was released. So why didn't I give this 5 stars ? The acting of the two leads Ryan O'Neil and Maria Berenson was at times quite wooden. They both look great and the period costuming suits each of them perfectly but some of the scenes they share are just a tad flat for me. I understand others will disagree and I don't know who might have been a better choice at the time but if the film has a weakness it is their performances.,1329782400,,1189,4.380090497737557
1213915,5,B00000FYPB,"There's always been something of a fuddle about this movie.  It was not received well by the critics when it was initially released.  The main complaint has been that it's too long and too slow.  But that may have more to do with the time it depicts than the film itself.

Anyone who's read European literature from the mid-18th century, or tried to imagine what it might have been like to live back then, could only love this movie.  Things didn't move so fast in the mid-1700s.  Some complain about the 1% on top now, then it was .25% and very few had the chance to get there.  Many who tried were charlatans like the star in this movie.

So do yourself a favor.  Read Simplicisumus and Vanity Fair before you watch this.  You'll get an idea of what life was like in Europe almost 300 years ago, and you'll be able to savor the gem this movie is.  It's an excellent time machine.",1326672000,5,881,4.310975609756097

It's bull every movie before 2000 was mostly filmed without bars now its understandable you make a movie in a circle frame or any shape technology is that deranged. Even the new Godfathers 1/2 are wrong. Again missing imagery cropped from top and bottom because of tv technology which are all RECTANGLE I don't care what Lord Bullington/Leon says. Look at all the Kubrick 4x3 and compare to the now black framed and you'll see there is top/bottom detail missing. But I have to live with Blue Ray because it's better than all the past 1999 versions and prior since Laser disc quality/old technology couldn't be helped. Still I miss the image that was once there and now gone and to me it is significant like taking a expensive square work of art and cut the top and bottom to make it a rectangle it's insane.

The problem with this particular release is that the bluray version seems to be a terrible transfer.  My real issue here aside from the fact that Warner Brothers continues to foist garbage transfers on an unsuspecting public is that ONCE AGAIN, Amazon.com refuses to separate it's product reviews, so it is simply IMPOSSIBLE for me to ascertain the quality of the DVD RELEASE vs. the BLURAY RELEASE.

They both deserve much more in the way of special features, especially when compared to Kubrick's other films.  Otherwise, pick this film up!  It's worth the price to get the best presentation this film has ever had in a home viewing format.  No noticeable DNR, good grain reproduction, and outstanding audio are huge pluses.

Note on framing: The framing on this BD of Barry Lyndon is not strictly how Kubrick had envisioned it, however, it is VERY close.  So close, that only those with the most discerning eye will notice, let alone be distracted by it.  I'm a huge Kubrick fan, and compared this to my older DVD copy, and although there is a slight difference in composition, you will most likely not notice it.  I feel it does not detract from the film.  If you're a stickler for original framing, you'll likely pass this up, but at this price I'd advise against it.  I do see WB releasing an anniversary edition at some point - and I'll probably get it - where they MIGHT change the aspect ration to the original, but it's not likely.

1213920,5,B00000FYPB,"Stanley Kubrick's brilliant, if odd, overlong, and uncommercial epic finally shows up on blu-ray, looking more ravishing than expected. This troubled  epic has always been a favorite with me, and I wanted a better looking version than the very early, non-anamorphic one that has existed since the dawn of the dvd phenomenon. I even had the laser disc of this.

But, even though the more popular Kubrick films have been released what seems like dozens of times in every format, LYNDON was only available in the basic flat-looking, archaic form. This changes all that. Still, they didn't have enough faith in it to give it commentary or any extras, at all. So, it's still a bare-bones deal, but it looks truly gorgeous.

The film itself is sometimes heavy-going for the uninitiated. The hero is unlikable, the star performance irritating (if correct,) the period somewhat forbidding, and the length pretty overwhelming; but, for my money, it's the director's best film. It is sinful that it's only available if one buys the monster set of all the films, for the fifteenth time. The Amazon exclusive saved the day, so I didn't have to re-buy everything just to get this.

This is one of the most incredible blu-rays, yet. But the movie is not necessarily going to be a favorite of anyone who comes in expecting another CLOCKWORK ORANGE or THE SHINING. It's still Kubrick, intricate, odd, one-of-a-kind filmmaking... but not something for a mass audience. This takes patience, but I've always found it to be wildly rewarding.",1316822400,3,1521,4.952941176470588

1213922,5,B00000FYPB,"I have, for many years, loved and appreciated the work of Stanley Kubrick. I am an unabashed fan of his work (save the appalling Eyes Wide Shut, but thats more the fault of the actors than the film), and have always been drawn to Barry Lyndon. Its genius lies in its cinematography and the use of natural light employed by Kubrick (the story of the camera use and style itself is legendary). This is a film of singular genius and can be watched with the sound off, as the acting of the lead characters (Ryan O.Neal and Marissa Berensen), is wooden and the dialogue is minimal, however, this adds, rather than subtracts, to the story. The acting of the ensemble back up actors however, is splendid, and overwhelms the stilted and vapid personas of the leads.

Anyone who loves cinematography and costume, and nuance in plot and characterization will love this film. Those who focus on the lead acting will be less impressed.",1314489600,,923,4.662576687116564

1213944,5,B00000FYPB,"Very films of great novels have surpassed the original book in quality. I can think of one one--The French Liutenant's Woman"" but I truly think Kubrick's writing of Lyndon captures the elegant sense of what life was like in the mid-eighteenth centure exactly the way Thakaray intended. As a setwork  at a secondary school work of English Literature in South Africa, we studied in great detail Thakaray's ""The Adventures of Henry Esmond"" which captures the very same society and the writing is pretty similar. Havjng studied that Esmond novel in great detail, and then saw the movie of Lyndon, I can with conviction say that Kubrick's take was accurate to the point of obsession in every detail. and in my opinion it EQUALS Thakaray's brilliant and compelling story, both book and film are equally moving, and Kubrick hones in on important pieces with much brilliant editing of plot and character. The pace while slow is easy to follow with flashbacks and is not static.
Portraying two homosexuals holding hands in a pool was photographed  naturally, without concern what the unworldly censors might think (this scene may have contributed to poor box office--the scene is crucial to the plot--but Americans are puritanical, even today (This explains the same luke warm, reaction to Kubrick's materpiece Eyes Wide Shut).One very special kudo to O'Neal who was excellent throughout and had a flawless Irish accent.=--certainly his greatest role. Though anti-hero. at the end one does feel compassion because in climbing the ladder  of success, he was following all the rules scrupulously and this proved his downfall. Like all humans he is flawed and his temper destroyed him. By the way the casting was simply superb, even the smallest roles and the credits note far fewer people than those employed in Avatar for instance. My favourite scene is Berensen who goes to her balcony bathed on incandescent burnished silvery moonlight and waits for this handsome stranger to take the bait of her seduction without one word said at the dinner table. The scene is exquisite and one feels the erotic heart beats of both players. The only words that describe it are monumental, epic, a moving painting.",1312243200,,2191,5.04696132596685
1213945,3,B00000FYPB,"Say that someone decided that the aspect ratio of the Mona Lisa should be tampered with.  Are you going to reward such behavior with money?

I think I'll stand firm on this one and wait for the studio to finally get it right.  The disrespect shown to Kubrick should not be rewarded, on principle.  Kubrick fans should protest this release.

I remember back when MGM did releases of Ingmar Bergman films and for no reason took Persona's 4:3 ratio and changed it to 1.66:1.  After people raised a fuss, they corrected that situation.  The same idea can and should apply here.

They need to go back and put this in 1.66:1 as Kubrick specifically intended, and put the black bars on the sides.  I don't see what's so hard about doing that.  1.78 aspect ratio is catering to philistines.  The picture doesn't need to fill up the whole TV screen.  If that principle applied, then 2001:ASO would have to be cropped to 1.78 to 1, which would be ridiculous.  But this *is* a matter of principle, so the black bars are just gonna have to go on the sides.  This is how the perfectionist, detail-obsessed Kubrick would have wanted it, yes?

1213946,4,B00000FYPB,"Shot in just over 300 days, mostly in Ireland, Stanley Kubrick's 1975 adaptation of William Makepeace Thackery's picaresque 1844 novel is as other-worldly as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSY.  Somewhat dismissed when it was first released, it now holds a far more respected place in the best 100 lists of film critics and film fans.  Martin Scorsese names it as his favorite Kubrick film.  It certainly is mine.  The story is about how Irish lad Redmond Barry became English nobleman Barry Lyndon.  But it's not so much the plot or the episodic adventure as it is the world in which it unfolds.

Kubrick wanted the film to be as perfect a mirror of its 18th century setting as possible.  He studied the landscape paintings of the era, especially those Watteau and Gainsborough.  He is said to have special camera lenses ground that could photograph natural lighting not only on exterior locations but also interior sets lit by candles to better evoke the era.

The resulting film, now transferred to Blu-ray, is exquisite. John Alcott's extraordinary cinematography must be seen on a big hi-def display to fully appreciate this vivid, eerie, ethereal, lucid dream of a movie that only gets better with age and repeated viewings.  The disc has no extras.  It would be nice, but the movie is more than enough.

But when you watch it via Blu-ray, on a decent size screen, the beautifully designed and photographed images of a past long gone spring vividly to life. In fact, it's almost like going back in a time machine. I don't think it's one of Kubrick's best films, but even his lesser works are better than most of the drivel that's shown in the cinemas today.

I know ""Barry Lyndon"" was harder to clean up because every edit on the VHS version had a slightly crooked 1st frame and the isolated dialogue had a lot of hiss, so it had to be faded up and down whenever anyone started and stopped speaking for most scenes, which shows Kubrick was a perfectionist at most things but not all.  These distractions have been fantastically corrected for the Blu-ray version, and since the film is 3 hours long, I'd guess this was one of the main reasons for its delayed release.  The only oddity is Warner Bros. selfishly replaced the VERY dramatic opening red and black animated WB logo with a dull, static black and white one, so they could add ""A Time Warner Company"" at the bottom.",1309132800,2,905,4.539877300613497

What other film has glassware on the lunch table casting serious shadows on the tablecloth from real sunlight coming in from the windows?  Barry Lyndon is full of images that I haven't seen before or since in films.  I suspect it's just too hard to pull off.  It took Kubrick's mania to make this happen, and it's consistent throughout the film.

The transfer is absolutely excellent.  What a delight, after seeing how the current owners of the Warner catalog butchered A Clockwork Orange on their pathetic Blu-ray release.

As I watched this film, it kept coming to my mind that there were no parts that required much acting.  Actors pretty much had to walk through the trite plot, given that good lines were basically absent from the entire three hours.  They were paper dolls. But the costumes were acting up a ferocious storm, as were the camera and the production design (by Ken Adam, no less).  And this was done so incredibly well that I have to give it 5 stars, despite me being a notoriously critical person.

1213965,5,B00000FYPB,"Before there was Peter Greenaway.  Before there were the Coen Brothers, there was Stanley Kubrick, the icy titan of cool cinema.  His heartless, pitiless, inhuman view of humanity was as perfectly matched to his material here as were the Coens with Cormac McCarthy.  And what came out in both cases: masterpieces.

Yes: he drove his crew to insanity in his search for perfection (I've heard the stories from the men themselves).  But perfection is on display here: perfection in the assemblage of a rogue's gallery of tableaux vivantes illustrating the folly of man.

Is it heart warming?  Hardly.  Is it boring?  Depends on you.  Are you boring?  Do you enjoy experiencing great paintings at, say, The Louvre?  How would an afternoon at a Palladian Villa in the Veneto strike you?  Or would you prefer playing Tron, the video game?  (Actually, there might be an overlap, but you get the point).

Was Ryan O'Neal a good actor?  Watch ""Paper Moon"" and you'll have to say he wasn't half bad.  Here, it doesn't matter.  Kubrick doesn't want actors.  He wants flesh he can xray.

And he gets it.  But these are X-rays by candlelight.  And that's magic.

The soundtrack was assembled by James Dean's mentor, Leonard Rosenman.  The two pieces everyone wants to find are the Sarabande by Handel and a Piano Trio by Schubert (I think, perhaps, #1).

Of course Kubrick fans already owned all the previous BR releases so it is nice that this single disc of BARRY LYNDON is available seperately (as is LOLITA).  Warner seems to have done the absolute minimum to get this disc out.  All previous Kubrick BR releases have featured extensive restorations and tons of bonus materials.  This disc gets no bonus features whatsoever aside from a very tired looking trailer.  The packaging is cheap eco case quality typical of budget release titles and to be fair, Warner isn't charging much for this disc.  The picture quality is very good but not the revelation that THE SHINING or 2001 BR releases were.  It looks good and is far better than the previous DVD release with lots of print dirt and scratches being removed.  The new 5.1 soundtrack is okay but nothing really spectacular.  It's an older film shot with lots of soft focus so I guess I shouldn't expect much.  It is still a beautiful and highly entertaining film (I've always considered it one of Kubrick's very best) and I'm thrilled to get this much improved version.  Still, it would have been nice if Warner's had given this great film the same treatment the previous Kubrick releases got.  This one feels a bit lacking.

The Blu-ray transfer looks quite nice with a transfer that improves signficantly on the previous DVDs. This isn't in the 1.66 aspect ratio that Kubrick indicated he wanted it projected at in his letter to projectionists dated 12/8/75 (""Barry Lyndon"" was photographed in 1-1:66 aspect ratio. Please be sure to project it at this ratio and in no event at less than 1-1:75""). This version is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. So this is OUTSIDE of the director's choice. Warner has insisted THIS is the correct aspect ratio based on discussion with Kubrick's long time assistant Leon Vitali.

Keep in mind that Kubrick meant the film to have a slightly soft quality because of the lighting choices and filters used to shoot the film so the look of the movie is inherently somewhat soft to begin with and the depth of field (particularly during the candlelit scenes)is very limited but, again, that's due to an extremely fast lens and the use of the lighting source for those scenes).

We don't get any special features (a commentary track would have been nice)but we do get the original theatrical trailer for the film (unlike ""A Clockwork Orange"" which has all the special features from the previous DVD as well as the documentary on Kubrick that was part of the boxed set of movies).",1307145600,5,1619,4.858695652173913

I was expecting a clumsy and rushed transfer from WB as part of a cash-grab package ( that
included Lolita ) on their just released BR Stanley Kubrick Collection.

I'm happy to report that the PQ on this BR is beautiful.
Be advised that both Barry Lyndon and Lolita BRs were not given the extensive, ground-up full restoration process.
Nevertheless,  I'm more than satisfied with the resulting PQ from the clean and deft transfer into HD.

The images are soft at times ( as intended and faithful to the 1975 release ).
Keep in mind this film was shot primarily with existing light ( using specially made ultra-fast Carl Zeiss lenses )
The details are intact. The black levels are deep, and the flesh tones are vibrant.

Sunlit daylight shots look crisp with bountiful detail, especially the set battles on the green countryside with the British red coats.

The candle-illuminated  night parlor shots are what this movie is about,  wonderful and ghostly scenes represented with ample detail of the actor's
faces and costume.

The PQ  looked equally impressive on a 52"" XBR lcd display  as well as being projected ( 150"" screen using a Sony VPL-VW50 1080P projector ).

SQ fidelity is delivered through  DTS-HD Master audio 5.1 with great results.

I'm not going to join in the correct aspect-ratio debate ( 1.66:1 VS 1.78:1 ) but I'll state that the 1.85:1  printed on
BR box is incorrect,  the film is actually presented at 1.78:1.

CONS:

Shameful that only 1 SD trailer is supplied as the sole supplementary material.
The packaging is the cheapest of all the BRs I've received.  No inside card,  flimsy container with
cutouts in the plastic to shave cost.

Kind of bittersweet,  I've waited so long for Barry Lyndon to arrive on BR,  and although the PQ and SQ are satisfying,
the flimsy packaging with 0 extras is an insult not only to Kubrick fans, but to his work itself.

If disposable, brain-dead features like ""Fast and Furious"" get the royal BR treatment with all the supplementary material
that one could stomach,  how is it that WB treats a historically important feature from Kubrick's canon with such disdain.

5 stars for the film
4 stars for the PQ and SQ
1 star for the packaging
half star for the supplementary material

I'll keep this disc until the Criterion Collection ( hopefully soon ) gives Barry Lyndon
the due respect it so richly deserves on the BR platform with a full restoration.

BTW the last 2 films in Kubrick's body of work will be available on BR Aug 16th! The Killing BR disc will contain Killers Kiss ( both remastered ).",1306800000,13,2596,4.708888888888889

The style and pace of the film are reflective of the style and art of the period.  Violence and lust boiling beneath a manicured facade of dress and manner.  A gem.

But besides all that, this film is a total tour de force and probably the best film ever made on life and times in the 18th Century.",1296691200,3,442,4.188235294117647
1213997,5,B00000FYPB,"Kubrick was a genius of cinema, a master of telling stories with pictures so loaded with meaning that often no dialogue was needed. Nowhere in his canon is that more apparent than in Barry Lyndon. Almost every single shot here looks like an Old Master painting, perfectly composed, a joy for the eyes. Once you let your need for quick narrative movement go by, Barry Lyndon wraps you in its sumptuous embrace and doesn't let up for three hours.

Three hours?! Yes, and there are a few bits where it grinds a bit, but if you're just enjoying the scenery and open to Kubrick's very sly visual wit, this is an episodic treasure. I'm pretty sure Thackery would have loved this version of his novel, though his take on the life of real-life rogue Andrew Stoney is somewhat more openly satirical than Barry Lyndon. Yet there are many very funny if rather quiet bits of humor here. My favorite is the opening of the second part; read the intro and then watch how Kubrick follows it visually. A classic joke, no doubt.

The main thing to remember here is that this is a picaresque film, in the best of ways, and that means long character revelation is the thing. Ryan O'Neal is good, though I might have liked a bit more overt humor from him. But no doubt that was his director's call, as SK's stamp is on every little nuance of this film. All the acting is solid and never detracts from the procession of beauty, while some performances, especially Leon Vitali as the hilariously pouty Lord Bullingdon, are exceedingly excellent. Kubrick knew how to get the best from his actors; few directors are master of so many aspects of filmmaking.

This film is for those who like their stories shown more than told, and the third person narrator, as opposed to Thackery's typically Picaresque unreliable first person narration, sets up the scenes quite nicely, and then Kubrick's insanely crisp visual sense takes over. I'm not sure England has ever looked better on film, nor will it.

Which is why this merely acceptable dvd print is rather a travesty; if ever a film needed a perfect transfer to blu-ray, Barry Lyndon is it. This dvd version has obvious compression in some pastoral shots; I don't want my waving grass pixilating, thanks! The dvd has zero extras, excepting a trailer, and I really wouldn't mind a bare-bones BD either, if it looked as perfect as this film should. PLEASE give this work of art the respectful treatment it deserves, and issue it in full splendor in hi-def, m'lords.

1214002,4,B00000FYPB,"Barry Lyndon is good movie and I'm happy I saw it.  It could be faulted for being occasionally slow by today's standards, but what it does have going for it is a sympathetic and likable main character Redmann Barry, aka Barry Lyndon, who goes from countryboy of no standing to the ranks of nobility (almost) by the twists and turns of fate.  At 184 minutes, it's not a short movie and there are some places in it that are about as interesting as the court music which accompanies it.  But, at the same time, while there are lulls in the story, it mostly tends to keep interest.  Add to that the Kubrick sense of tone and irony, with a narrator stepping in from time to time to give a somewhat amused overview and finally you've got a movie that is quite watchable.  It doesn't take long to get into, the filming is gorgeous and the recognizable touch of the master is unmistakable.  It's a study of character and a study of ""nobility"" perhaps, in both senses of the word.  While nowhere near as intense as say ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""The Shining"" the stealth and pace of the direction and a quiet cosmic irony that is the signature of Kubrick is there.

As to the mastering of this DVD, it's not sure if it wants to be widescreen or full screen - a thin black line on the top and bottom of the screen suggests this (so you get a widescreen that is so wide on the top and bottom it could almost be full).  In fact, I didn't find it overly distracting.  The quality of the transfer was superb in every other regard, and there were English subtitles (yes!).  There are no special features, and the only other drawback to the package is that the case is ""environmentally friendly"" which means half the plastic is taken out and that we are supposed to beleive this is good for the environment.",1279152000,2,1789,4.374622356495468

1214006,5,B00000FYPB,"I have nothing but bright things to say about this 1975 film so where do I begin -- perhaps with the story itself?

THE STORY: [18th Century] Redmond Barry (later, Barry Lyndon played by Ryan O'Neal) starts out as a naive young Irishman with a penchant for both romance and adventure. After being initially defeated in his love for a stunningly beautiful girl, (ultimately through deception by a stogy old English military officer), Barry commences his life sojourn of Europe. He soon finds himself on the continent and right at the heart of period wars. He subsequently links up with an old card sharp who helps to expand his fortunes but Barry wants more... he longs for peerage and the only way he can get it is to cuckold an ailing old nobleman who is married to a beautiful young woman. He thus lets himself in for a financial and an amorous roller-coaster ride. Barry is a sympathetic character from start to finish, albeit he can be a bit of a scoundrel at times.

This artful and darkly humorous film reeks of quality. The locations, the sets, the props, the filmscore, the camera-work... every consideration is of the First Water. Of course such features epitomize what we have come to expect from renowned director Stanley Kubrick.

Prior to viewing this film I was not a previously great fan of Ryan O'Neal (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peyton-Place-Part-One/dp/B001O4KBNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peyton Place: Part One</a>) - but his performance in this film turned me around on both his remarkable skill as an actor as well as his clear adaptability. I was also very pleased to see one of my personal favorite actors, Patrick Magee, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dementia-13/dp/B000286S38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dementia 13</a>&nbsp;) in his flawlessly cast role as ""The Chevalier."" But the hallmark jewel in the crown was another tremendous actor of all too little fame, Frank Middlemass (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-Peace-1972/dp/B000QGE86K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War & Peace (1972)</a>), who played Sir Charles Lyndon - he was perfect!

This 2003 DVD runs for a total of 184 minutes (never boring!) and it is presented in a ""matted widescreen"" format, (which is a sort of ""expanded letterbox"" aspect and which looks great on a widescreen television.) The film is rated PG. It's all just spectacular and it has easily earned my highest rating of five stars.

If you liked this film you will surely also enjoy a more contemporary entry which employs the same sorts of themes:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duchess/dp/B001L57ZZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duchess</a>.",1266537600,3,2773,5.820197044334975
1214007,5,B00000FYPB,"This is one of the most original films that I have ever seen.  It turns so many notions of normal hollywood filmmaking on their head that I think it is great satire based on realism.  Not only do we start off knowing that the principal character that is doomed by his character flaws, but its great beauty/prize - Marisa Berenson in her prime - comes across as dull and plain as a doornail.  THere is not a single redeeming character, and even its climax - the duel with his step son - is a comedy of errors.  Perhaps the funniest moment in the film is a death by heart attack.

The result is a marvelously lush tour of the underbelly of the late 18C British aristocracy in the context of the wider society, with strict attention to period realism.  Virtually all emotion, as witnessed by the viewer, is vapid, self-seeking, deluded, and in the end pathetic.  When action abruptly occurs, and there are plenty of vivid bursts of it, it comes too late to do much good.

The theme, I believe, is decadence, a doomed order just prior to the French and Industrial Revolutions.  Disillusioned at every turn, Redmond Barry is stripped of his dignity and humanity by a trick and then enlistment in the military, reasserts himself as an interloper into the aristocracy, and imposes his cruelty and cynicism on everyone.  His only redeeming features are a few relationships, which invariably are doomed or abandoned, except for his tough mother.  It is truly bleak.

Though completely unsympathetic, the actors are wonderful.  O'Neal is brilliant as a guileful fool.  Berenson, a pampered weakling full of romantic illusion, has nothing whatsoever interesting about her.

As it did 35 years ago, this film utterly rivetted me.  As many reviewers have noted, the print is regrettably mediocre.  But this is a classic.  REcommended.",1264464000,2,1821,4.819354838709677

I remember it as the most realistic movie I've ever seen, and not most of all in the sense of its exquisite mise-en-scene and famed candelit scenes.  So in what way realistic?  We watch a man -- a very ordinary, rather shoddy man -- live his life.  At the end of the movie, he dies.  That's all that happens. What makes the movie almost unbearably powerful is that it has no point and no moral; it might be said to have no point of view.  Even Barry Lyndon has no apparent point of view about his life.  There is no satisfaction at the end.  The only meaning to be found in Barry Lyndon's life is what the viewer imposes on it.  This ethical vacuum creates intense discomfort and a pressing need to fill it with an interpretation.  Therein is the beauty and the satisfaction of it, if any. Some viewers and critics rejected BL as empty and boring; others supplied their own reading of it; for me, and I can't speak for anyone else, the agonizing pleasure of the movie lay in the tension it created between meaning and non-meaning.  For the duration of the movie, I experienced both the shock of the void and the drive to fill it with a narrative; holding my mind in that space, yielding to neither the urge to flee nor the urge to moralize, was mesmerizing and transformative.",1252195200,5,1428,4.367424242424242

You could freeze-frame many of the scenes and swear you were looking at a Gainsborough, a Vermeer, a Hogarth or similar work of art by one the great artists of three to five centuries ago.  It just's beautiful stuff. I hope a Blu-Ray of this is done soon and released as this film is worthy of a great, high-definition disc.

For the visuals, we have Director Stanley Kubrick and Photographer John Alcott to thank. Being a three-hour movie, there are plenty of wonderful shots to admire, too.  In addition, the costumes are lavish and authentic and the scoring is notable. It's no accident that Oscars were garnered for art/set direction, cinematography, costume design and scoring.  Yeah, if you enjoy classical music, you'll really enjoy the soundtrack, toom under the guidance of conductor Leonard Roseman.

Not to be overlooked is the fine acting and the interesting and underrated story.  I say ""underrated"" because this film, from what I've read, bored a lot of people and and it was a box-office flop.  That's too bad because, frankly, I found the story (outside of the first 10--15 minutes) to be fascinating. As I watched, I kept wondering what strange occurrences will happen next to the lead character, ""Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon,"" played beautifully by Ryan O'Neal. (For most of the movie, he's called ""Redmond Barry,"" so I will refer to him as that.)

In the end, this was a low-key adventure story about the rise-and-fall of a ""scoundrel"" back in late 18th century Englishman.  ""Mr. Barry"" is an Irishmen living in England who winds up dealing with a number of people: Irish, English, Prussian, French. His dealings with these people are bizarre at times.  While he mainly is shown doing what he can to promote himself, for either monetary gain and prestige of a name and power, he's not all bad. There is a compassionate side to him, but it only shows itself in small doses. It makes him all the more interesting to watch, because you don't always know how he's going to react to his circumstances, which change radically every few years.

We witness his rise to prominence and then his fall when his ""sins begin to find him out,"" as the Bible would describe.  It's quite a roller coaster ride.

This is an emotional, involving story, and a feast for the eyes and ears.  It's quite different, too, certainly not the average fare from Kubrick.

This film will definitely transport the viewer to a different time in space...Kubrick's specialty.",1237593600,2,545,4.913043478260869
1214046,5,B00000FYPB,"My comments are going to address the film itself (just as my 5-star rating is for the movie, not the DVD transfer), since many other smart and observant reviewers have pointed out the failings of Warner Brothers' shoddy treatment of Barry Lyndon on DVD. I absolutely urge any fan of poetic cinema or Stanley Kubrick to invest in a copy of this movie, but better to wait for a beautiful transfer of one of the most beautifully photographed films ever made.

As for the film... A hipster friend once told me Kubrick was his favorite director. I asked him if he liked ""Barry Lyndon."" ""Barry what?"" was the answer, confirming my suspicion that ""Lyndon"" is an underrated work even among Kubrick devotees. I can understand. Despite being a period-piece based on a picturesque adventure novel, Lyndon is as aggressively experimental as Kubrick's previous film, ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and does not reward the passive or impatient viewer.

Thwarted in his desire to film a Napoleon biopic, Kubrick turned to William Makepeace Thackeray for inspiration and the result is an arrestingly beautiful, strangely haunting, and thoroughly original work of cinematic art. In two parts separated by an intermission, Barry Lyndon follows the rise and fall of one Redmond Barry, an 18th century Irishman whose good looks, ingratiating manners, talent for fighting, and cutthroat ambition mark him for something ""greater"" in life than tending farms. During the course of the narrative, Redmond duels an Englishman, joins the regiment afoot, deserts, gets dragooned into the Prussian army, becomes a Prussian spy, escapes again, takes up the profession of gambling, travels the Continent in the company of a Chevalier, and pursues a nobleman's wife.

And that's just the first part. Sounds like an exciting romp, doesn't it? Er, actually -- it's not. For all its visual pomp and splendor, ""Barry Lyndon"" remains one of the strangest, most idiosyncratic films I've ever seen. Ask almost anyone who has seen the movie (a paltry number to begin with) and most will tell you that ""Barry Lyndon"" is, in a word, boring. I can only account for my own experience, but the effect for me is more mesmerizing than yawn-inducing. Kubrick's mastery of the film medium is such that he recklessly breaks all rules of movie storytelling and yet I'm hypnotized by the painterly images and evocative classical soundtrack.

""Lyndon"" is an embarrassment of visual riches, from the lush green landscape of Ireland to the candle-lit interiors of European courts and palaces. Virtually every shot of the movie could be framed and mounted on the wall. ""Barry Lyndon"" belongs on a shortlist of the most physically ravishing films ever made and is worth seeing for that reason alone. It's pure cinema, distilled to a gorgeous interplay of sight and sound.

Kubrick stretches film time to the breaking point, collapsing months and years into a few shots and then drawing out fleeting moments for a seeming eternity. Redmond's seduction of Lady Lyndon, for example, is a wordless sequence that travels from the gaming table to an outside veranda in a breathtaking ballet of glances, meaningful expressions, unspoken emotions, and quiet gestures. Social ritual fascinates Kubrick, and much of the drama of the story stems from the tension between violent passion and society's restrictive formalities.

Yet it's not all filmic experimentation and weighty themes. ""Barry Lyndon's"" early, Ireland-set scenes feature stunning scenery and a lovely, lilting theme composed by that great Celtic band, the Chieftains. The humor is dry-as-dust and dark-as-midnight, the kind of humor Kubrick specializes in (remember a little satire called Dr. Strangelove?), as in the delightful exchange between Redmond and Captain Feeny, one of the most courtly-mannered robbers one is likely to encounter. As for Kubrick's purportedly ""clinical"" absence of emotion, there's a scene towards the end of the film between Redmond and his ailing young son that is emotionally devastating.

Ryan O'Neal, never known as a great actor (to put it mildly), is nevertheless perfectly suited to the part of the rogue-ish Redmond Barry. As in the aforementioned scene with his son, O'Neal digs deep to give a powerful, convincing performance that maintains a high quality over the course of the movie's 3-hour running time. Though his Lucky Charms Irish accent comes and goes, O'Neal captures an essential innocence and sweetness to the character that allows the audience to keep with him through thick-and-thin. His social climbing doesn't seem so much the result of a Machiavellian plan as the result of spur-of-the-moment opportunism. In the climax of the film, a stunning duel that takes place in an abandoned barn, Redmond makes a choice that demonstrates the distance he's traveled from his first impetuous duel with the Englishman. In that moment, Redmond deserves the name of hero. O'Neal himself must have known Barry Lyndon was a career highlight: he named his son Redmond.

1214047,5,B00000FYPB,"I'm aware of the many criticisms leveled against this film, but I consider it to be one of Kubrick's finest, and it's one of my all-time favorite movies.  Perhaps more than in any  of his other films, he makes effective use of a seemingly endless stream of striking images and gorgeous music to create a highly atmospheric ambience.

Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is substandard, with an apparently non-anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio that stretches out the image horizontally (at least on my LCD HDTV).  The picture quality is not as clear as it should be, even allowing for the deliberately dark scenes shot only by candle-light.  This film would look a lot better with a quality remastering.

The audio is presented in reasonably good Dolby 5.1, but I'm hoping that when this film is remastered for Blu-Ray, it will receive a major improvement in the picture quality as well as a more robust audio track.

People complain that Ryan O'Neal was somehow miscast or did a bad job of acting.  I disagree.  The main character in this film is a highly flawed human being who brings about his own downfall due to his various failings. That's part of the whole story.  O'Neal portrays this character in a direct manner, without any attempts at eliciting false empathy from the audience.

Another criticism some have made is that the film is too long and moves too slowly. The same criticism could be made about most other Kubrick films.  Watching a Kubrick film is not like watching most films.  He took a very long time to shoot his movies, and it seems clear that he expected viewers to be willing to spend time when watching them.  He didn't make popcorn movies (though there's nothing wrong with them;  sometimes you just want 90 minutes of rapid-fire action, appealing characters, and an event-filled plot).

So, the film itself is a masterpiece, the DVD is substandard, and ""Barry Lyndon"" deserves a first-rate Blu-Ray transfer so that we can finally see the movie as it was meant to be seen.",1235260800,5,1997,4.795321637426901

1214050,4,B00000FYPB,"Since I love this movie I'll limit myself to the issue of the aspect ratio.  In summary: Kubrick wanted the film to look this way--a decision he made while preparing the now out-of-print ""Collection"" of his films.

According to an Editor's Note on the 1999 release (found here (Amazon doesn't allow URL-insertion, so you'll have to copy-paste): [...] the Aspect Ratio is exactly the way The Master intended.

According to the WB spokesperson quoted on the above ref'd page, ""In every respect, the films in the Collection remain as Kubrick approved them.""  (who was that decided on these description? 16X9 TVs are more accurately described as full-screen that 4X3 TVs which leave a very large area of the screen unused).

So, while the 4X3 ""full"" screen is annoying for those of us with 16X9 TVs, it they way Kubrick wanted us to see it.  (He also favored mono over stereo because of the vast differences in theatrical audio equipment and quality; e.g. the original cut of ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" had mono (the overwhelming majority of theaters, back then, had one speaker placed behind the screen), 2-channel stereo, and 5 channel stereo mixes for those tiny number of theaters which had them in 1977 (two years AFTER ""Barry Lyndon""!).

Unfortunately, Amazon's product description of this version frustratingly doesn't indicate if it comes with even a 2.1 stereo version, let alone a full 5.1 mix.

Either way, it's still a great movie, gorgeously photographed and including all the hallmarks of his inimitable style.",1227916800,3,1517,4.968379446640316
1214051,5,B00000FYPB,"Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is a spectacle, full of luscious visuals, extraordinary costumes, and a very aggressive underlying theme of cheating, and losing at life.  This is not a contender for Kubrick's top five films of all time, and for good reason, but regardless, this film put me in a trance from beginning to end.  I had not read William Makepeace Thackeray's novel beforehand, so I honestly cannot add to the discussion of whether or not this is a proper adaptation, or if O'Neal's performance was right for the character.  I will however say what I saw, and that is a movie with Kubrick's visual style stamped on every single shot.

The story is a rise to riches tragedy revolving around the life of an Irish lad by the name of Redmond Barry.  As a teen we are first introduced to his character as one who shares a romantic relationship with his cousin, Nora Brady.  When Nora is set to marry British military Captain John Quin, the naive Barry retaliates confronting the captain to a duel, which ultimately drives him away from his town, mother, and Nora.

This starts Barry's long adventure to ""becoming a gentleman"".  Along the way he shall be robbed, enlist in the British army, serve in the Seven Year War, and become a professional gambler.  He'll finally acquire wealth beyond his wildest dreams when he manages to court Lady Lyndon, after her husband, Sir Lyndon, finally dies from years of crippling disease.  This starts a vengeful relationship between him and his acquired stepson, Lord Bullingdon.  From here on out Barry's ultimate demise becomes inevitable as his life falls apart into tragedy, mostly due to his own actions.

As stated earlier by myself, Barry Lyndon is one of the most expertly shot films I have ever seen.  The visuals alone make this one of the best movies I've ever seen, but it is not at all a perfect movie.  Sadly none of Kubrick's films are ""perfect"", but that's intentional by the director, and no one comes closer to making perfect movies than Stanley Kubrick.  Though he's never really made a film with truly captivating human characters, his stories, and underlying messages have always been the strongest aspects of his films.

Kubrick's dislike for humanity is as present as it ever was in his other films, even if not as strong as say `2001 - A Space Odyssey'.  Barry is always displayed as being a character that seems to be...well, he's hollow.  Barry is a man who hardly ever shows emotion, and once he is at the top you can't help but feel as though his mannerisms are that of a spoiled child.  You never really grow attachment to this character, and the narrator makes sure of that, which makes it apparent that Kubrick never intended you to grow truly fond of Barry, so when he ultimately is left poor and crippled you can't truly feel for him.

That being said, Ryan O'Neal's Barry is not to be confused with a ""cardboard character"", like what you see in 80% of summer action films.  He's actually quite complicated, the only thing he ever shows passion for being the well-being of his son, Bryan.  The way he takes everything for granted, from Lady Lyndon, to his wealth, he just seems to not care about anything, other than his young son, who he spoils by treating him to whatever he desires.  This makes it apparent that the thing Barry loves most will be taken away from him in a cruel fashion.

I'm not spoiling anything, because the ultimately, tragic ending of Barry's life is given away by the Narrator's first few comments over the course of the first hour of the film (and if you don't catch it there he'll announce it bluntly in the last forth of the film).

When going into this film you shouldn't expect for something truly compelling, nor should you expect Barry to be an average Joe, whom you can relate to.  The movie is in no way intended for you to leave it with a smile on your face.  Don't go to a Kubrick film and expect a film that's intended to leave you happy (Even Dr. Strangelove, one of the best comedies of all time, had an ending that made you speculate the future of the human race).

If you are new to Kubrick, these negative plot points may drive you away, but if you are familiar with his work Barry Lyndon will not surprise you in its underlying themes.  That being said, for people who are fond of period pieces, there are few movies that I've seen that can match the visual style of Kubrick's film.  While watching it you will feel swept away by the Academy Award winning cinematography of John Alcott and the costumes, which also earned one of the films four Academy Awards.

Leonard Rosenman's winning score must also be acknowledged, for it also makes this film an attention grabber.  The music is never overused, and if feels perfect for the film.  It is full of elegance, something that could stand for the upper class which Barry tries so hard to be a part of, but beneath its beauty you can feel a sense of treachery, and corruption, which perfectly reflects the ruthless behavior Barry tries so hard to conceal beneath a faade of grace, but ultimately fails to keep it suppressed.

The film is a must see for Kubrick, and fans of period pieces, but if you don't fall into one of those two categories Barry Lyndon may be hard for you to stomach, with its running time of about three hours.  You may enjoy this film, but it seriously depends on how you take in Kubrick's other work.  If time's a problem you can watch this film in intervals, because there are plenty of chances throughout to pause and take a break.  If you want to watch Barry Lyndon you'll need to pay it full attention.  It is better to watch it in intervals than watch it straight through while being distracted.  It needs full attention for you to take in its full impact.

Not Kubrick's best, but I give it a solid 9 out of 10.",1224201600,4,5808,4.552454282964389
1214052,5,B00000FYPB,"The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means. ""Barry Lyndon is"", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films and this one is most definitely one of them! It's a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this. Look at the ones he's responsible for: ""Spartacus"" (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) ""2001"" (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and ""Barry Lyndon"".

In the months preceeding the release of Barry Lyndon I read about several aspects of the filmmaking that piqued my anticipation - and ultimately contributed to my lifelong appreciation for this film: 1. The fact that Kubrick assisted in the development of lenses of heretofore unequaled sensitivity in order to film numerous interior scenes by natural or candlelight; 2. That he chose as subject matter a novel (by Thackery), that the author himself had so disliked that he discouraged its publication during his lifetime; and 3. I read that Kubrick had listened to ""every"" extant period composition for quartet to choose the accompanying soundtrack. Sure, I was as skeptical as anyone as to how Ryan O'neill - Mr ""Love Story"" - could possibly have the gravitas for a Kubrickian character, and I knew going in that it was 3+ hours long... but I was hypnotized from the opening frame. The pacing, the sardonic narration, the breathtaking cinematography, the unerring score. Certainly my affinities for photography and art history were thoroughly rewarded, but I also found the storytelling strangely compelling as well. Which is why I sat through the film twice, on the BIG screen, within the first few weeks that it opened. As an insight into my cinematic preferences, the only other film that I recall seeing twice within the first few weeks of release, was ""Natural Born Killers""...

I have no idea why...the film is perfect in every way, from the direction, the acting, the score, and the lighting (yes, the lighting). It's one of the most beautiful films that you will ever see.

Ryan O'Neill is wonderful as Redmond Barry, an Irishman who falls into high society during his life, which ultimately spirals out of control near the end. This film has the feel of a great novel. At three hours, the pacing is brilliant, and you will find that it flies by in no time at all. The story is so engrossing and the characters so well drawn, that I can't imagine anyone having a hard time sitting through it in it's entirety. Most of the criticisms for this film were mostly related to the pacing. This, I do not understand. A film like this needs to be told in three hours.

1214100,4,B00000FYPB,"I have always loved the writings of William Makepeace Thackeray, especially when I am not in a hurry to be rushed through a novel.  I had never watched the film by Stanley Kubrick until this morning, and I had a lot of mixed feelings about it.  Kubrick wrote the screenplay, and it is definitely not the Thackeray novel, especially when it comes to character intent, several plotlines and even the viewpoint, as the novel is first person; so this is Thackeray ala Kubrick first off, and that's okay. Kubrick's take on Barry Lyndon, though, left me very chilled and detached from the character, unlike the book....and Ryan O'Neal's portrayal did nothing but pull me further away.

The film is so beautifully photographed and the set design so amazing, that I was able to endure the 183 minutes of constant brooding looks by Ryan O'Neal as Barry Lyndon.  The film seemed ponderously unbearable at times, because the scenes are so long and drawn out.  The novel is complex, so I can't understand why Kubrick changed it and made it even more so.  For me, personally, I wanted to stop and give up on this film, because the story line is dragged out ad nauseum, and quite honesty, I could not abide Ryan O'Neal's portrayal.  It is pretty tough to watch a film where I feel the lead actor is THAT awful; but, when a film's look and feel is so beautiful, I can overlook some things. I am glad I watched it.  It is memorable, but editing would have been the better piece of valor IMO. Thank Kubrick that he included an Intermission.  I ate and .....well you know!",1209772800,,1554,4.561151079136691
1214101,4,B00000FYPB,"When Stanley Kubrick's film BARRY LYNDON was released at the end of 1975, many people were probably expecting either something along the lines of DR. ZHIVAGO, or a raucous period piece in the manner of TOM JONES.  But giving people what they expect was never the stock-in-trade of this particular director, and instead he delivered a very clinical 18th century period study that, initially, was deemed a failure by critics.  And this being the dawn of the ""Blockbuster"" age in Hollywood, it failed to do particularly well at the box office, either in England or in America (making most of its money in Europe).

But as with so many of Kubrick's films, BARRY LYNDON has, over the years, come to be seen as a striking piece, worthy of the four Oscars it won in 1975 (Set Decoration; Musical Adaptation; Cinematography; Costume Design).  Ryan O'Neal stars as the title character, a charming but scheming kind of rake who goes up the ladder of 18th century society by fighting, lying, cheating, and being more or less a gold digger by the time he marries Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson).  He finds out what the limits are to what he is doing when he is confronted with a stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali), who knows about his stepfather's cruelty.

Based on William Makepeace Thackeray's somewhat obscure 1847 novel, BARRY LYNDON, along with EYES WIDE SHUT, is probably the most misunderstood film in Kubrick's entire oeuvure.  This is perhaps because this study of 18th century manners, complete with jaw-droppingly gorgeous nighttime candelight scenes shot by Kubrick's favorite cinematographer John Alcott, is fused with a deeply clinical, and even cynical, attitude about human nature.  Such was the way with Kubrick, at least in the eyes of the critics, particularly after 1960, when he left America to live and work in England (much of BARRY LYNDON was filmed in Ireland in 1973 and '74).  And as the cold and clinical way Kubrick made this film turned off one too many critics, so too did the extreme length of the film itself turn off audiences.  Even in 1975, attention spans were starting to shorten ever so gradually; and a three hour-plus film like BARRY LYNDON was likely to try even the most patient filmgoers.

But as mentioned before, time has given us a new perspective on this arguably odd duck in the Kubrick canon.  Though the casting of O'Neal in the title role was considered a misjudgment on Kubrick's part, in retrospect it now seems like the right one.  Berenson is also tremendous as Lady Lyndon; and Kubrick regulars Leonard Rossiter and Philip Stone turn in very professional performances as well.  The whole period atmosphere is shot through with a typical Kubrick touch in terms of the music--some of it is by the Chieftains, but most of it is by Baroque and Classical-era composers like Mozart, Vivaldi, Schubert, and Handel.  In particular, the adaptation of the D Minor ""Sarabande"" of Handel is used to grand and sometimes sinister effect.  For this, much of the credit must go to the late and often underrated Leonard Rosenman, who won one of this film's four Oscars for his adaptations.

Four stars may seem curiously low for a Kubrick film, but this is not to imply that BARRY LYNDON is a far lesser piece than 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or THE SHINING.  But it is a vastly different kind of film from this enigmatic and often controversial filmmaker; and like any of his films, it requires repeat viewings--a tall order here, admittedly, given its length.  In the end, though, the rewards are considerable.",1209686400,,3537,4.855241264559068
1214102,5,B00000FYPB,"Perhaps the most underrated film ever made. Barry Lyndon is one the most beautifully crafted films in any genre. The film is set in the 18th century, the Age of Reason. But personal feelings and motivations seeped up through the rationalist surface of that time. Barry Lyndon, more than any other film, captures the essence of the 18th century. The costumes, cinematograghy, and settings are all beautiful. Ryan O'Neal, who plays Barry Lyndon, is quite good in the title role. Some have commented that this Stanley Kubrick's most boring film. Actually, important and interesting things happen in every scene.
There's too many events, surprises, and turns in this film to write about them here, which would ruin it for a first time viewer anyway. Barry Lyndon is an Irish scoundrel who is determined to climb up the ladder of the strict British class system. He's not a perfect scoundrel and gets caught off guard several times in the film. The film has a subtle sense of humor like the duel between Barry and the fearful Capt. Quinn. The seduction of Lady Lyndon by Barry in and outside of a gaming room is wonderfully done. There's no dialogue in that scene at all, but if there was it wouldn't have been as effective. Bryan's (Barry's son) deathbed and funeral scenes accompanied by Sarabande music are powerful. When Barry was in the Royal Army he got into a fistfight with another soldier. His opponet was bigger and had the brut strength that Barry didn't have. But Barry was more cunning and quicker so he won the fight. The scene says a lot about the character and the plot.

I got interested in Kubrick work when I bought 2001 on blu ray, the equisite depiction of space, and shots of the moon surface were captivating, so I started looking at some of his other work, until I stumbled upon this one.
This is by far the best cinematography I have ever seen, as a matter of fact, Kubrick used a special lense built by Carl Ziess for NASA apollo moon exploration program, with the incredible 0.7 F stop, highest ever used in film history ( up until now no film maker has even tried to use that lense). Certain scenes Kubrick uses three candels to light the entire scene, thats it, a perfect work of art.
This movie is like gazing at the monalisa, and then all of the sudden she starts talking an acting. Actors walk out of portraits on the wall to interact and have a dialog. As with all Kubrick movies, you need to watch it more than once to discover it more. first time I rented this, I was bored within 45 minutes ( most of the story is about some british royalty wearing tight pants), Then four months later I re rented it just to look at the candle scene( I muted the sound), I was debating whether I should buy it or wait for the Blu Ray to come out, but finally I said this is something I need in my personal collection.

Coincidentally, this is Ryan O'Neal's best movie though he told an interviewer that Kubrick drove him crazy during the production. Kubrick experimented with cameras to capture the quality of candle light. For the most part, he was able to avoid artificial lighting but not entirely.  Technology has its limits though. Actors were required to keep still during the scenes lit by candles; the cameras needed a narrow focus.

Though Hollywood legend says that all the costumes were antiques, this is not true. However, given Kubrick's nature for exact detail I am sure the copies looked original in every minutia. Supposedly, Kubrick framed scenes in the movie to match paintings by a Gainsborough, who would, perhaps have been a contemporary of Barry Lyndon, had he been real. This movie won a slew of Oscars for cinematography, best music, art direction and costume.

As all good movies, there is some basis in fact. The original story was by William Makepeace Thackeray on one of Queen Elizabeth's ancestors: Mary Eleanor Bowes, the Countess of Strathmore, called ""the unhappy countess"" for her love affair with an Irish rake and fortune hunter Andrew Robinson Stoney. Thackeray is the author of ""Vanity Fair,"" which no doubt was the reason for Kubrick's interest in the film.

This is an excellent film for couples. There is little violence. The pace is slow but this allows the audience to absorb, full measure, the atmosphere this movie attempts to create. Kubrick was successful, I believe.

I had been waiting for a newly mastered version, and when I saw this new artwork (and that all of the other Warner Kubrick titles had been remastered for enhanced 16X9 viewing), I figured that BARRY LYNDON had also been.

Admittedly, some of the situations and clothing are rather comical viewed from the 21st century, and I spent much of the time on the verge of laughing. I enjoyed most of the story. It just keeps getting better and better -- until the intermission. Why does this young man suddenly begin behaving in an utterly atrocious manner? He wasn't a saint to begin with, but I had hoped for some kind of redemption as his life progressed. Guess I should have read the book. I would like to see the whole last part where he becomes a better person. That would be just too Hollywood and not true to the novel. So it should remain as it stands after all.

It is set in beautiful countrysides, with lovely costuming and makeup, as well as fine performances and an appropriate score.  I would nickname it ""The Rise and Fall of Barry,"" since that's exactly what happens:  Ryan O'Neal portrays a poor Irishman who yearns for his cousin's affections but ends up having to leave town, joins the British military, and then becomes a spy when captured by Prussians.  He builds his fortune by gambling and making social connections, but this leads to his downfall, as shown in the second half of the film.
He marries a woman of means and has a son with her, but he does not truly love her or his stepson, whom he treats so badly that he sets in motion a series of events that lead to many misfortunes.  By the end, Barry is a shattered man, having lost his leg after a duel with his stepson and having lost his biological son as well due to an accident.  Needless to say, he loses his wife as well and is sent back to Ireland in disgrace.

1214148,5,B00000FYPB,"In 1975, one European reviewer wrote: ""One collapses in one's seat and is propelled in a state of drunken euphoria.""  That's just how I felt about it, going back to experience ""Barry Lyndon"" over and over again at the Los Angeles Cinerama Dome theater in 1975-76.  So I give the movie 5 stars. But for the standard 3x4 DVD (1:1.33 aspect ratio), only 3.
Having recently watched the 16x9 Hi-Def Blu-Ray discs of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"" (after having watched the old standard DVDs a number of times), I can say that Hi-Def makes an important difference with Kubrick's movies -- not just because they are gorgeously photographed, but because the richness of the images conveys so much essential, visceral meaning that even a slightly degraded picture (i.e., standard DVD) actually impairs the work's emotional fullness, clarity and expressiveness.  So much of ""Barry Lyndon"" consists of pure image and music, and so many of the images are meant to intoxicate, that the film needs to be seen in the best possible technical presentation.
Short of a new 35mm print, a 16x9 Blu-Ray disc displayed on a big 1080 set in the dark, uninterrupted, is the way to watch all of Kubrick, perhaps especially ""Barry Lyndon.""  Now, finally, Warners Brothers Home Entertainment will release ""Barry Lyndon"" in Hi-Def on Blu-Ray disc on May 31, 2011.  Yes, that means you have to buy it again, but if Warners' Hi-Def releases of their other Kubrick films are any indication, it will be worth it.

1214152,5,B00000FYPB,"This is possibly my single favorite film ""of all time"".  Kubrick manages to pull off the seemingly impossible and deranged task of a narrated period film in which 1) every important plot point is given away in advance, and 2) there is no message except something like ""this is life and in the end it doesn't matter what it really is, does it?""  It's just about the sickest, loopiest, best idea ever.  To top it off, the narration is a bit stuffy and droll (not to mention completely literally-minded), and our hero is actually an anti-hero.  But in the end, it's as if everything seemingly negative and vacuous is flipped about and we are able to see it all in one sublime and interconnected moment.  That's a good word for this film: sublime... but perhaps ""strangely sublime"" would be better.  It's not ""overwhelmingly sublime"".  It's not too profound.  It knows that ""too profound"" is not profound enough.  Art that's ""too profound"" just makes you feel all tingly and inspired, or perhaps ""awed"" or ""frightened"" at best... but this is different.  To be really ""sublime"" you've got to say ""screw it"" to the world and all expectations and drive forward with a kind of blind, relentless madness.  It's even madder than it seems because whatever it is you want to be inspire or awed by just isn't there.  This is Barry Lyndon: the relentlessness of looking and looking, seeing everything, but seeing nothing.  Kubrick says ""I know everything... I am God... and the joke's on you.""

There is an undeniable element of fatalism and determinism here: a kind of Spinozistic single-mindedness that transcends all particulars into a united vision that is simultaneously bad and good, ordinary and lofty, meaningless but somehow still something you can't take your eyes away from.  There are so many things going on, so many connections and events and times and places... but somehow they're all the same too.",1190073600,6,1900,4.857142857142857
1214153,5,B00000FYPB,"""Barry was one of those born clever enough in gaining a fortune, but incapable of keeping one, for the qualities and energies which lead a man to achieve the first are often the very cause of his ruin in the latter case.""

This is the theme, spoken by an unseen narrator, which runs through at the very center of Stanley Kubrick's majestic historical epic ""Barry Lyndon."" Following a string of three masterworks, which, conventional wisdom has dictated, represent the creative peak of Kubrick's legendary career as a filmmaker, it was Thackeray's novel about the rise and fall of a young Irish scoundrel who rises the ranks of 18th century English nobility that the enigmatic artist chose to set his sights. Conventional wisdom also tells us that, beginning with ""Barry Lyndon"" in 1975 and as further pronounced in 1980 with the release of his horror opus ""The Shining,"" Kubrick's work began to display a diminished artistic resonance. These films, the feeling goes, lacked the visionary, complex implications of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and the insightful social commentary of ""A Clockwork Orange."" Kubrick must simply be losing his touch, right? Well, not really. Although it may apply to ""The Shining"" and Kubrick's subsequent works, the conventional wisdom, as applied to ""Barry Lyndon,"" is wrong. Or, should I say, it WAS wrong. That is, until time alone was able to be the final judge of the film's legacy. Fortunately, subsequent critical revisiting of the film led many to finally come around to appreciate ""Barry Lyndon"" and regard it as the rich and giant masterpiece that it is.

Kubrick himself was perhaps such a divisive and misunderstood artist due to his desire to tell stories against the grain of the usual approach. Unlike traditional film narratives, which most often focus on human relationships and manipulate our emotions through drama and conflict, Kubrick concerned himself on much larger themes. He was most often interested in man's relationship to his society, and explored themes of broader conflict. His dramas were not sentimentalized and narrowed by character conflicts alone, but always examined the implications of these characters and conflicts to the shaping of the course of society and humanity.

FILM ANALYSIS:

If for nothing else, Kubrick's film cannot be denied as a stunning example of visual achievement. Quite simply, it is one of the most sumptuous, haunting, majestic, and gorgeous cinematic experiences ever realized. Richard Schickel, the highly distinguished TIME magazine film critic, who did a cover story of the film prior to its general release, praised it as ""perhaps the most ravishing set of images ever printed on a single strip of celluloid."" The landscapes are epic and breathtaking, the interiors rich and elegant, and each shot composed with a painter's eye for design and detail. It is no surprise that Kubrick found his visual inspiration in 18th century paintings and even went so far as to pose his actors just as subjects in certain paintings were positioned. Additionally, the costume and sets are impeccably designed (so much so that they garnered Oscar wins, as did the photography and the music), and Kubrick's use of classical music further heightens the sense of high art and elegance. All of these production elements, coupled with a cast of actors who are in tune with the material and who embody the director's keen sense of genuine human qualities, bring to screen life an era in history with an authenticity that is often attempted but rarely ever accomplished so vividly. It is not a dull and ancient past, but a living, breathing present that we are immersed in.

As with most of Kubrick's work, after going through this journey, it is not the triumph of speech or spirit that remains with us, not the wit and wisdom of dialogue nor the emotional connection between people. It is purely the magical, visceral impact of the visuals that remains in our mind, and Kubrick puts great care into making everything count. It is the slow zooms that reveal the larger context, the landscapes, sometimes liberating, often just as oppressive. It is the nuance of a facial expression, the gleem in the eye, the empty gaze, the way that light plays off people and objects. It is the quite moments that reveal so much more than any words could ever justify. It is the music that brings mood and texture to the many varying states of emotion.

Kubrick, as well, is not up to his usual bag of tricks here. In his previous film, ""A Clockwork Orange,"" he utilized a great many devices (i.e. slow motion, fast motion, fantasy, expressionistic acting, outerwordly sound effects) to create a bizzare and nightmarish sense of reality. In this film, however, the cinematic trickery is downplayed, as is necassary for the more elegant feel of the material, and the ever confident master artist takes great care in the more ""pure"" and classical elements of film storytelling that take root in the silent era. Each scene, each shot even, is deliberately executed with precise and flawless use of composition, lighting, sound, editing, and staging. Notice, for example, how the tension of the final climactic duel is so carefully escalated by the use of sound (pigeons in the rafters), music (a subtle underscore), and editing (the careful cuts back and forth between two faces), or how various pieces of music pronounce the transitions in Barry's life throughout the film.

CHARACTER ANALYSIS:

Through the journey of Redmond Barry (played with brilliant subtlety and understated turmoil by Ryan O' Neal), Kubrick is able to communicate themes of moral decay, decadence, and duplicity that exist in the attainment of power and social privilege. As we follow Barry's life, from a nave and idealistic young Irishman, with little money and no prospects, to his rise as the cruel and treacherous Lord of the Lyndon manor, and finally to a beaten and broken man, crushed under the weight of his own inadequacies, we come to understand the dimensions of a man who has the skill and ruthless ambition necessary to use circumstances to his advantage. Ultimately, however, Barry's rise to power and fortune place him in a world this beyond his means, by which his incompetence is displayed in his squandering of the Lyndon fortune and the destruction of his own reputation. In a single moment of explosive rage between stepfather and stepson, a family quarrel that plays itself out in front of horrified spectators of London's high society, Barry begins to feel that weight bear down on him. Kubrick communicates this with a zoom out as Barry stands alone on the grand balcony, a distant figure, weak and vulnerable, overwhelmed by his great castle and by great responsibilities.

It is interesting, though, that Kubrick places judgment not only on Barry, who is admittedly a dishonest rascal, but also upon the society in which his characters exist. ""Gentlemen may talk of the age of chivalry,"" says our omniscient narrator, speaking in a jovial British manner that only faintly masks the sarcastic brand of cynicism hiding just below the surface. Instantly, his point is clear to us. Humanity can be a cruel beast, in any age and under any circumstance, even a chivalrous one. What's more, Barry is a mere product of his age of ""chivalry"" and is not the only scoundrel who is able to cheat his way to the top of the social food chain. The classical scoring also adds an ironic contrast and counterpoint between the faade of nobility and the debauchery that many characters play a role in. Working with this theme, Kubrick, with a distinctive sense of characterization and human behavior, allows us to understand what makes a man (and perhaps mankind itself) proficient enough to acquire power, privilege, and political clout, often through immoral conduct, and how he comes to destroy these institutions and himself.

There is also the question of Barry's underlying motives. What is really behind this obsessive need to become a proper ""gentleman,"" a title which takes on an ambiguous context as we discover certain facts about the inner-workings of the nobility. One gets a sense that there exists a deep rooted inferiority complex with Barry's character. Perhaps due to his underprivileged upbringing, or even due to the envy of not having the distinction of British pedigree (suggested in his joining the British army), Barry seems driven by resentment, self-loathing, and the need for acceptance. There is not one clear conviction that defines his quest, only a need to be perceived as something that he is not: a proper gentleman and dignified member of the privileged class. Our narrator questions the role of fate in Barry's rise to such fortune, but Kubrick ultimately seems to leave doubt to the credence of such ideas. Ultimately, it seems that, even when luck is on our side, when the grand gamble goes our way as it were, and we find ourselves in the favor of fate, there is no guarantee that the natural drives of humanity (in Barry's case, a self-destructive ambition for wealth and status) will favor our ability to maintain our good fortune. Man, after all, by the very flaw of his character, has the ability to be the ruin of his own way of life. Perhaps it can be seen as a warning to the rise to power of those who are incapable of acting with morality and prudence. Perhaps not. As with all of Kubrick's work, it does not lend itself to easy answers, only to immensely rewarding viewing, reviewing, and discussing...",1186963200,4,9483,4.969754253308128
1214173,5,B00000FYPB,"It took a few viewings of Barry Lyndon for me to really grasp it, but then again, this is just like every other Kubrick movie.

By the time I accepted the slow, methodical nature of Kubrick's direction, along with the 3 hour running time, I began to realize what makes this movie arguably Kubrick's finest.

Simply put, Barry Lyndon is the most beautiful film that I know of, and I've seen many films at this point.  No hyperbole, no exaggeration.  This movie is gorgeous, and that is a severe understatement.

There are scenes in this movie that will move you to tears, they are so beautiful.  The stunning lighting (and you can read about how Kubrick managed this elsewhere online), the lavish and overwhelmingly complex sets and costume designs, the use of incredible classical music, the ever-present brilliance of Kubrick's direction: this movie is truly an auteur at his most self-indulgent.  I mean, really, the colors that Kubrick captures are mind-boggling; so many awe-inspiring uses of purple and orange and blue...it left me speechless.  Some may frown upon an artist catering to that kind of self-indulgence, but for those like me, you will welcome an artist who has given full-reign to his/her imagination and has the talent to make it happen.

Of course, it is easy to overlook the many other fabulous aspects of this film.  One thing that is often overlooked in Kubrick films is the phenomenal acting abilities he managed to get out of his actors, and the emotional depth that he captures (while constantly being criticized as cold and unemotional).  To those who hold this opinion, I would ask that you witness Ryan O'Neal's heartbreaking performance as Barry Lyndon.  He is wonderful.

While 2001 and Dr. Strangelove may vie for the best of Kubrick's unmatched career, and while I am partial to 2001's magnificence and inimitability, the objective observer in me must admit that Barry Lyndon, while certainly Kubrick's most underappreciated film, is probably his best.  Stay awake!!, and you'll be treated to some fabulous performances and scene after scene filled with images that will be burned into your brain.",1183852800,4,2131,5.0
1214174,5,B00000FYPB,"The beauty, the depth, and the mystery of this film are unsurpassable - what Kubrick was doing with light is just a miracle. Special lenses were designed to shoot interiors and exteriors in natural light. In one scene Barry (Ryan O'Neil) was having a dinner with a German woman who was feeding her baby and the candle light made the whole scene look like a Caravaggio's painting. This is just one of many scenes. Each of them is perfection and harmony. Costumes and sets were crafted in the era's design. Age of Enlightenment with its gallantry, wars, and duels, had been recreated in the film with the precision of the celebrated landscape and portrait masters of the period such as Thomas Gainsborough; Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy of Arts; George Romney to name just a few. If nothing else, watching ""Barry Lyndon"" is pure aesthetic delight - and there is one man responsible for it, Stanley Kubrick. If ever divine film was made, ""Barry Lyndon"" was it and Kubrick could've quoted the Bible - ""God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good"".

I've read the comments and articles that call ""Barry Lyndon"" cold, slow, boring, ""the collection of pretty pictures', ""flawed"" masterpiece, and the most ridiculous one, ""glittering ornament with a hollow center"". I simply can't understand it. ""Barry Lyndon"" is the most compelling and compassionate realization of the inevitable finality of everything in this world which was presented by the visionary director with elegant sensual melancholy. Stanley Kubrick known for his detached, seemingly remote and non-sentimental style chose to reach out to his viewer directly during the epilogue, ""It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personalities lived and quarreled, good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now"".

1214177,5,B00000FYPB,"This film is seriously neglected in the Kubrick universe (only Eyes Wide Shut is neglected more), and it's a damn shame, as it is not only his most underrated film, it is also a masterpiece.  It is one of the most breathtaking beautiful films ever committed to celluloid.  The photography alone is enough to see it (try to see it in a theater).  As Kubrick afficionados know, the scenes that were lit by candlelight were actually shot with only candlelight.  There were no other lights used.  In these scenes, the actors don't move about too much, as there wasn't much depth of field, because of the special lenses that Kubrick used here.  They were designed specifically for this film.  Christianne Kubrick, Stanley's widow, said this was her favorite film of Stanley's, as the framing is reminiscent of paintings of the period, and Christianne is a renowned painter whose paintings were used in many of her late husband's films (like A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut).  Ryan O'Neal is quite good as Barry, a scoundrel and a cheat who gets his comeuppance by the end of the film.  Leon Vitali (who went on to become Kubrick's personal assistant up until Kubrick died) is astonshingly good as Lord Bullingdon, Barry's stepson and nemesis.  The duel scenes (especially the 2nd one) are small masterpieces of editing, sound, and music design.  Despite the film being 3 hours, it is never boring, and there's so much to take in visually the 3 hours flies by.  It's a pleasure to sit through such a beautiful film such as this.  The film, despite being directed by the American Kubrick, has a uniquely British feel to it, enhanced by the brilliant cast of English actors, many of whom appeared in other Kubrick films (Philip Stone, Godfrey Quigley, Patrick Magee, Anthony Sharp, Steven Berkoff, and Leonard Rossiter).  Kubrick shot almost all of the film on location in castles in England and Ireland.  There were hardly any sets used.  The film won several Academy Awards (though not for Kubrick himself).  It won for cinematography, art direction, and music score.  This film was rarely mentioned by critics and film people (I remember reading about it in the World Book Encyclopedia of all things), but it's getting some long overdue recognition, and hopefully it will continue...",1175558400,5,2284,4.888311688311688
1214178,5,B00000FYPB,"This film is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and one of the top movies of the last 50 years.  It develops out of very unlikely material, and is entirely a product of Kubrick's driving, single minded will and control.

Based on a William Thackery novel, the story is what used to be called in art and literature, ""the rake's progress"" -- take a low born rascal through a series of fortuitous episodes which land him in wealth, then watch his bad character unmake him through another series of episodes.  The set-up reinforced social stereotypes inherent in the British class system; low bred men are inferior.  Thackery was bigger than that, of course, but like all artists was a man of his time and the crack in the product widens with age -- here, the assumed genetic and social inferiority of an Irishman.  Then you have fascinating stuff like decades long European wars, but nobody much is taught about this anymore.  Kubrick picked a deck heavily stacked against him for this tour de force.

And cinematic tour de force it is -- all shot in natural light, narrative (other than adjusting the 1st person voice of the novel to 3rd) straight out of its time.  Nor does Kubrick update moods, dialogue, social assumptions like Amadeus -- he gives you a film that looks like it was actually shot 2 centuries ago, and impresses you with the absolute alienness of many of the characters.  You are hit with how changeable human society is, and yes, very cooly distanced.  Thus the pacing and emotional distance appall many viewers, who think this is because the picture has ""dated""  -- no, it was intended and designed to be exactly the way it is.  To not understand this is to not understand the movie; one's dislike may be very genuine, but Kubrick's intentionality has a grand subtle effect:  the tables are turned on Thackery's social determinism.  And the film is so faithful to Thackery that Kubrick here delivers a major lesson:  the only difference is placing a camera in it.  One must remember that Kubrick started out as a photographer and that art is central to his entire ethos and point of view.  Thus too, the silent but spectacular visual message goes, pictures now make us appalled by the tragedy of war, by the realities of racial and social discrimination -- the camera itself is at  near the root of many modern revolutions.

While the rake remains a rake, O'Neal brings wit to the part under Kubrick's tutelage and a large degree of empathy.  Barry Lyndon -- a character now captured on film, no longer just the page -- is seen caught in an invisible social matrix, not only in the assumed inferiority of his origins.  The camera focuses uncompromisingly on lords, kings, soldiers, ladies, 18th century con men, roadside bandits -- all.  The mercilessness of the whole enterprise would be wholly unpalatable but for the splendour and fullness of life recreated here, and the fire of Kubrick's eccentric passion to portray it.

Memorable scenes are too many to catalogue; every performance is great, some despite the distance of time and vision are absolutely wrenching.  Child actors, a Kubrick specialty, were never used better by him.  If, all said, the film lacks the glow of love and humanism, the compensation is heavy wisdom and a startling piece of learning.  With this film, Kubrick establishes the camera not only as a step forward in technology, but a teacher fit to take its place next to the pen, the violin, the artist's canvas.",1171929600,9,3454,4.782462057335581
1214179,5,B00000FYPB,"I have nothing to add to what most people who reviewed this positively said.  All I would add is that the fencing scene is very well done, and not surprisingly, highly authentic, especially the last move done by O'Neil: the grab / behind the back stab maneuver is right out of contemporary fencing manuals of the time.  What is interesting though, is that they are both fencing left-handed...what are the odds of that happening (makes me wonder if the Pantinkin / Elwes fencing scene in Princess Bride 15 years later was some sort of homage to that?)",1171756800,,550,4.65979381443299
1214180,4,B00000FYPB,"An old film that has aged tremendously. The rhythm is slow, too slow, and it lacks any kind of feeling or sympathy or compassion. It is cold, very cold. This is the portrait of a social climber who is blocked and rejected when he has finally reached the top. Then it becomes the story of his downfall. He has a lot of luck in his life, but he essentially is a coward who uses the army to get out and away, a deserter who shifts from one side to the other, a spy who double-cross everyone, a gambler who cheats all the time, and a gross ruthless and uncouth person who uses every means at his disposal to get to his ends, even women of course. But the film shows how he is then defeated more by misfortune than by any real plan. He is defeated by the young lord whose mother he has conquered, and the details show that this young lord is even worse than the one he gets rid of, his stepfather, a vomiting retching little coward who takes advantage of the very only moment of generosity his stepfather actually demonstrates in his whole life, and this only one time towards him. He surely recovers his estate and gets rid of his stepfather but he recovers no honour, and yet Kubrick does not go that far. He stops short of saying that, though he shows it with the very last images of a sad, selfish, embittered young man who has suddenly gotten older than his age. What could have attracted Kubrick in such a story ? I can only see one answer : the deep cruelty of human beings and the unfathomable inhumanity of human society, aristocratic or not. That may explain the whole career of Stanley Kubrick : human society is nothing but a computer gone berserk.

Even if you start with humble beginnings, you have the opportunity to rise through the ranks and be someone significant. (And in this case, it has to do with entering into nobility--no easy task!)

1214197,5,B00000FYPB,"This neglected Kubrick classic, based on Thackeray's picaresque novel about the rise and fall of a wild Irish boy in 18th-century Europe, is a gorgeous study in the beauties of light and stillness. You could probably say that about all of Kubrick's films but the formal elements stand out especially strongly here, where there's not as tight a narrative---or an actor as charismatic as Jack Nicholson, Malcolm MacDowell, James Mason, or Peter Sellers---to pull you along as there are in some of his other films.

Kubrick resolved to film with exclusively natural light, a challenge for any director but especially tough when you're shooting a period piece by night in grand European castles. Kubrick's devotion (obsession?) was such that he had a special lens created---now known as the Lyndon Lens---for shooting the candlelit night scenes. Many of the exterior shots are set up in deliberate imitation of 18th-century landscape paintings, and at times the film resembles a moving painting more than a talking picture. Seeing a picture shot in natural light, where shadows shift and move at random across the actors' faces, reminds you just how artificial the ""normal"" light in movies really is.

While the visuals are through-the-roof great, and set a new standard for costume dramas, I had a harder time caring about the story. I couldn't figure out what drew Kubrick to Thackeray's novel; it didn't seem to touch on his pet themes as clearly as some of his more famous films. Maybe he was attracted to the duels: there's something about the combination of brutality & violence with the civilized trappings of rules, codes of honor, and glamorous hardware that reminded me a little of ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001."" Ryan O'Neal does a fine job as Barry, but he seemed to disappear once he married the rich widow and the story lost a lot of its interest for me after that. Warts and all, it's a memorable movie by an undisputed genius of film.",1155513600,4,1947,4.914893617021277
1214198,5,B00000FYPB,"Stanley Kubrick's 1975 epic Barry Lyndon was released in the nine years between two of his most well-known films, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining. With the exception of Spartacus, historically the only film he didn't have complete creative control over, Barry Lyndon at 184 minutes is the longest film Stanley Kubrick ever made. Upon its release, Barry Lyndon yielded underwhelming box-office returns and received a cool reception from critics. True of all the films Kubrick released between 1968 and his death in 1999, critics have warmed to the film and what was once considered his most underrated is now considered one of his best. Not bad for a film he only decided to make when he was unable to get his Napoleon film into production. This is a Kubrick film through-and-through, the second and final film he would write solo, although, like most of his films, it has a literary basis. Barry Lyndon is a film of many layers, a sweeping epic that moves in a hypnotic, dream-like way and in unafraid to poke fun at its subjects while taking itself seriously. Due to its length, it's one of the hardest Kubrick films to just sit down and absorb but it proves to be one of the most rewarding.

Barry Lyndon is made up of two parts and an epilogue, the latter consisting of only a title card. Part one, which lasts half of the running time, is sub-titled ""By what means Redmond Barry acquired the style and title of Barry Lyndon."" The film relies heavily on classy, monotonous, omniscient narration performed by Michael Hordern and many events in the film are not even shown onscreen. The film begins in Ireland circa 1750 and introduces protagonist Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), who has fallen in love for the first time with his cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). When the snarling, insufferable John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) appears as Nora's suitor, Redmond challenges him to a duel that forces to him flee to Dublin and lay low for awhile. As the film is an ""epic,"" the viewer is invited to accompany Redmond from this point on through all the peaks and valleys of his life. He joins King George's army, becomes a deserter, and eventually ends up in the Prussian army. After the Prussian army sends Redmond to spy on the Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee), Redmond becomes his aide and confidant and the two begin to build a fortune through gambling. Redmond eventually lays eyes on Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), a countess whom he eventually seduces and marries after her husband's death. This leads to part two, ""Containing an account of the misfortunes and disasters which befell Barry Lyndon,"" in which Redmond, now known as Barry Lyndon, climbs the social ladder and welcomes a son, while feeding the hatred of Lady Lyndon's own son Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali).

It's impossible to summarize Barry Lyndon in only a few sentences, as it tells a rather expansive story over three hours. With all of the story arcs and events within this running time, the film isn't immediately gripping like Kubrick's other work and requires time and patience as it quietly sneaks up on you as it unfolds. It's pacing is elegant, moving with no hurry. The lack of that very specific, yet unexplainable Kubrickian tone sets Barry Lyndon apart from Kubrick's other films made between 1968 and 1999. There are scenes that play in that fascinating, Kubrickian way and scenes that film buffs can immediately identify as Kubrick, yet the absolute presence of the master is not as prominent. I've always found tone and atmosphere to be the most striking aspect of a Kubrick film, but the most striking thing here is the way it looks. Kubrick was always an artist in the way he used images yet this may be his most luxuriously shot, beautiful film. The film won Academy Awards for costume design, art direction, score, and cinematography, making it the Academy's most awarded Kubrick film. Even with his film undervalued, its beauty could not be ignored. Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott worked hard to make sure the film didn't look like the typical lavish costume drama and opted to use as much natural and available light as possible. Not only is this technically innovative, but it's effectively dazzling as well. The lighting, something I rarely put much thought into, is used tremendously and adds in setting this film apart from others like it. Additionally, there is stunning picturesque scenery that never feels superficial or fake.

Due to strenuous shooting schedules (keeping in mind that principal photography for this film alone took 300 days); many actors have told horror stories about working with Kubrick. As a result, his eye for casting and his ability to direct actors to precisely capture the correct tone for their performance is often overlooked. While he was in much higher regard in the 1970s, it must have seemed like an odd choice even then to cast Ryan O'Neal in the title role. Redmond Barry is a fascinating character, the ""hero"" of a historical epic who remains a static character throughout and displays an emotional disconnect and indifference to the events that take place around him. Redmond expresses emotion, but seems so passive; almost mechanical. For all it lacks in emotion and charisma, O'Neal makes up for it with intensity. Vitali gives a marvelously austere and delicate performance that seems to go unmentioned in discussing this film. His character is one of the most dynamic and emotive of the film and many of his scenes are elevated by his performance. Bit parts without much screen time make significant impressions because of the casting, such as Leonard Rossiter as Quin. It would be easy to forget this character who appears so early in the film, but Rossiter's sneer and his aristocratic voice and posture make him unforgettable.

In the hands of another director, Barry Lyndon could be mind-numbingly dull, with style markedly overwhelming substance. That is never the case here. The duel between Barry Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon, for example, is masterful in Kubrick's hands; a clumsier director could have turned it into bloated tedium. Barry Lyndon may not be the most iconic film in his repertoire, but it is a complete treasure. A stunning masterwork that hasn't aged a day, it's such a rich, detached, memorable, and cold film that stands as a true work of art.

1214199,5,B00000FYPB,"Watching this movie was like going back in time 230 years.  Kubrick's cinematography is superb; his use of natural lighting and stunningly beautiful European settings are quite impressive.  Critics of the film will invariably point out the flatness of the characters, slow pace of the film, and the length (3 hours).  There is some truth to these criticisms, but the total experience is well worth the investment of time.  There are so many mediocre films put out nowadays, you might as well watch something intelligent, well-made, and historically instructive versus the same predictable movie template that is made 10 times per year.  Watching this film feels like reading a great classic novel.",1142726400,8,697,5.1875
1214200,5,B00000FYPB,"1 of Kubrick's best.  Incredible dialogue, wonderful story, an even an inspired performance by Ryan O'Neal.",1131148800,2,107,5.6875
1214201,4,B00000FYPB,"If you feel uncomfortable watching this film, it's because it is about you. Barry Lyndon is a film without a hero (you're not a hero, right?).  When first released it alienated audiences  who were expecting the surrogate melodrama usually served up as historical fiction on the screen. Set in the 18th century, with meticulous attention to period detail never seen before or since (one of the many ways Kubrick was a perfectionist), this film has swordfighting without a hint of swashbuckle.

We enter this film through its landscape. What is depicted is a largely rural Irish and English countryside, one that has since been violently raped and murdered. Thanks to pioneering cinematographic techniques we are privledged to see that world much as its contemporaries saw it, and as no other film has shown it. We see and experience life as it once was: and the pace is much slower than we're used to. So MTV doesn't always rule, OK?

Visually enchanting, musically sumptuous (with a little help from the Chieftains) and authentic in its depiction of dress, customs, speech and class distinctions as it is, Barry Lyndon is essentially the story of a life. It is, has to be, a common story, one we know often happened in the period: poor boy marries rich widow and squanders fortune. What Thackeray had in mind in his novel was to transcend period and plot, to show something more eternal about human nature. And if Thackeray knew anything at all, he knew man was bound to fail at anything he attempted, most of all when he thought he was succeeding.

But Thackeray got stuck in the 19th century. His prose has faded, great writer though he still is, and lacks conviction to a 21st century reader looking for relevance to his own story. One genius has handed on the torch to another.

You remember once being a better person. You had ideals. But life got in your way and ever since you've been on the run. So now you're not much better than a grifter. There's so much you want, and you know what will happen if you don't get it. Chances are your parents are good people who didn't get it. All it takes is some glibness, a few risks, a few lies, and keep grabbing those opportunities when they turn up. Sure you feel bad some of the time. In a better world you'd do better. But you always remember what happens to failures: and once you start the climb upward it's hard to stop, no matter how you're compromised.

So we, and Barry Lyndon, feel. Enjoy the 18th century period trappings as you will: don't forget this story.

Kubrick's film  though refrains from sermonising. There are many who find Kubrick's attitude in his films remote, cold, detached. In Barry Lyndon Kubrick monumentally refrains from judgment. The depiction of this average man on the make who succeeds then fails concentrates on his milieu and makes no comments at all on his rights and wrongs. ""No man is a hero to his valet"" said Madame Cornel in the 17th century: Barry Lyndon was no hero to either Thackeray or Kubrick. Just  one of us, mired with the same fate as us all. And from this viewpoint comes a gleam of satire: life really is too tragic to be taken seriously. It takes the perspective the film gives in looking back at the 18th century though to reveal the immense feeling Kubrick has for his characters, and for us all.

Some have taken exception to the acting in the film. In some ways the best acting is on the part of the narrator, who has all the best lines. The film can be viewed as a morality play, whose point is precisely summed up in its epilog: good or bad, rich or poor, beautiful or ugly - they are all equal now.",1130976000,3,3611,4.548536209553158
1214202,3,B00000FYPB,"I have to give credit to Stanley Kubrick for being the only director to never make the same film twice.  If one were to watch all of his movies, one would never know they were made by the same man.  This is incredibly hard to do and very few filmmakers have undertaken that risk.  Even fewer filmmakers have undertaken that risk and were successful at it.  Kubrick was both and that might be one reason why he is loved by so many film lovers all over the world.  Although I can give him credit for that, I also feel his films are deeply flawed and some are quite boring.

'Barry Lyndon' is a lot like many other Kubrick films.  It is directed in stunning fashion, with several brilliant sequences throughout.  It is beautiful to look at and the costumes great.  At the same time, the film fails in creating a character the audience can like watching for over three hours.  I doubt many film lovers can possibly like the main character of this film.  He is a user and an opportunist; he has almost no sympathy for the people he has hurt and used throughout his lifetime.  Something bad happens to him at the end of this story.  Although it is bad, I felt that he deserved much worse than what he got.  He hurt and abandoned too many people in his life to receive something that was the equivalent of a slap on the wrist.",1129852800,,1319,4.308943089430894
1214203,5,B00000FYPB,"Whenever I want to immerse myself in opulence and almost excessive beauty of image I rewatch this supreme accomplishment in movie-making by the late Stanley Kubrick.  It is not for all  tastes and some may find the pace to be too measured, to stately, or just plain plodding.  If one thinks this that viewer is missing the point of Mr. Kubricks magnum opus.

It won four Academy Awards and very rightly so.  The costumes and wigs are exemplary and accurate, almost to a fault.  One can only imagine the cost of replicating them in a similar movie today.  The outdoor settings are breathing and the indoor scenes takes ones breath away with their magnificence and authenticity.

This may be a movie for very particular tastes and will not appeal to all.  By the way, Ryan ONeal and Marissa Berenson (related to the late art scholar Bernard Berenson) are ideally cast and the actor who plays the chaplain Mr. Runt is in many of Ken Russells movies and is a campy, uptight, and sanctimonious English cleric wonderfully played by that gifted actor.

Immerse yourself of an evening in this cinematic excess and revel in the musical adaptations of some of my favourite composer which exactly mirror the action on the screen.

Ryan O'Neil plays Barry Lyndon with very little personality, almost like a zombie.  Lady Lyndon, played by Marisa Berenson, has no personality whatsoever; they could have saved money by using a mannequin for the part.

Based upon the novel of the same title, this Barroque era saga follows the life of Redmond Berry who flees from his small hamlet in Ireland to seek fame and fortune.  I have never seen such a masterpiece of a film.  Don't let the era of this movie prevent you from watching this celluloid gem.  You won't regret it!

1214210,4,B00000FYPB,"In Barry Lyndon, it seems like Stanley Kubrick takes great pains to distance his audience from the drama.  Title cards let us know the ultimate outcome of the film's two sections ahead of time; an omniscient narrator sounds like he himself cares very little about this tale; when Barry is in Prussia speaking German, we are not even provided with subtitles.  Though Barry is clearly the main character, it would be a stretch to say that we experience the film from his point of view.  He is certainly not a likeable protagonist.  And though I felt pity for many of the film's characters, I found it impossible to sympathize with any of them.  I did not feel satisfaction at Barry's rise, or sadness at his fall, nor did I feel like he or I or anyone learned any valuable lesson from his story.  The acting is good enough, though, and the film presents us with characters that are interesting to observe for a time.

Visually, the film is magnificent.  It practically oozes period, every pore saturated with 18th century.  There are gorgeous costumes and sets, as well as photographic lighting and composition that are truly breathtaking.

I guess it would be easy to dismiss Barry Lyndon as film with a glossy exterior but no inner soul, but I don't truly feel like this is the case.  It seems like the Barry and his drama are not the central point of the film, but more an important part of a greater aesthetic whole.  This film has an amazing sense of rhythm, and as the camera moved hypnotically, the scenes played out, the music sounded, and the dramatic motifs recurred, I found myself becoming more and more engrossed in this lush and beautiful work.",1124841600,,1656,4.633561643835616
1214221,4,B00000FYPB,"My first experience with the film Barry Lyndon was in college in 1977.  A fine print was being exhibited by the university at an appropriately large theater auditorium.  Though I had been an avid Kubrick fan for several years, the generally sub-par reviews and unusually brief first run in a limited number of venues dissuaded me from seeing it upon its initial release.  Now was my chance for personal redemption!

For a solid three hours I was transfixed by the images, sounds, and rhythms of another time and place.  Scenes unfolded by way of sequences of slow zooms on static interiors and painterly detailed exteriors, always punctuated by beautifully framed wide landscapes serving as segues.  The characters' expressions, conversations, and speech patterns reflected their time and place; from the farms and fields of Georgian Ireland to continental mansions, estates, and battlefields.  Duels and battle scenes were presented as equivalent parts of a grand tapestry as opposed to high points of action in a screenplay. All were embellished with the languid rhythms of Irish pipes or the slow stately chamber music of late classicism.  Everything moved and transpired at the ""speed of life"" of another time.  It was wonderful!

In this film, plot is almost incidental as any sense of drama or character motivation is telegraphed by the titles and narration.  In fact, what could be called the film's climax is a maddeningly drawn-out duel set in a sequestered haybarn; hardly the stuff of your typical Hollywood epic, but certainly effective in the context of this tableaux of a ""simple Irishman's"" life and escapades.  In fact, the consistent deliberateness with which every movement was staged in the film helped lend a semblance of dramatic cogency.  Any sense of irony is also incidental, but for this viewer, it ultimately made the ""journey"" of experiencing this film that much more worthwhile.

Only one scene left me vexed and irritated: that being where the dying young son of Barry and Lady Lyndon plays ""marriage counselor"" to his parents with the two adults blubbering uncontrollably. Sorry, but this just reeks of incredulous sap!

This is a film to be absorbed and savored in real time, not necessarily contemplated in hindsight. Taken as such, it succeeds marvelously.  At only one point was I made overtly aware that I was watching ""only a movie"": the freeze-frame near the end as Barry descends from the carriage.  That moment was appropriate and well-contrived, and such was this film's grip on me.

If you care to make the journey into the world of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, be certain you have an appropriately large screen, three uninterrupted hours, and had plenty of sleep to perhaps ward off the hypnotically slow rhythms of this historic ""never-never land"" to which you'll be transported.

Kubrick would have done better with an actor Irish in fact and not just in name.  O'Neal is often overwhelmed by the performances around him, and the lack of a good accent is annoying, even to Americans I should think.  That said, there is so much good here that I cannot give it less than five stars.  A couple of scenes bring goosebumps, without any special effects or manipulative music, and this is rare enough in itself to merit any number of stars.  The opening scene at cards is amazing, as is the scene with the German mother and her baby.  The first half of the movie, before Barry becomes a complete cad, is more engaging, but the second half is never boring or hard to watch.  The acting, direction, costumes, lighting, and script are all top-notch.  Kubrick did all he could with the book, I think--except choose a better title actor.  Also, this movie obviously gave the clue to Merchant/Ivory, and we should be grateful for that.  In terms of sympathy, Merchant/Ivory undoubtedly surpassed Kubrick on several occassions, but they never surpassed him in terms of cinematography.

A Clockwork Orange, 2001 Space Odyssey, and Eyes Wide Shut all disappointed me, and I couldn't stand any of them.  Some people ""get"" Kubrick and some don't.  I don't.  I find him ponderous and pointless.

Even so, I think Barry Lyndon is more watchable than the other three.  The story is well told, and despite its unmanageable three hour duration, it rarely drags.

One odd thing about this movie is that there is no one to cheer on.  Not one of the characters is likeable.  When misfortunes happen to the hero, Mr Barry, it's fine with me.  He was a jerk from the start.  He never was portrayed so viciously as to be an actual villain, but he doesn't win much sympathy from me.

His biological son is annoying.  His stepson is annoying.  His rich wife is annoying.  His friends are annoying.

Eyes Wide Shut is paced so slowly that it is more than just surrealistically slow - it is stupidly slow, and the acting by Tom Cruise suffers accordingly, making him look completely inept.  The slow pace is obviously Kubrick's fault.

The pace in Barry Lyndon is also slow, but you might call it measured.  It isn't nearly as intolerable as that horrible movie Eyes Wide Shut.  Perhaps it is because Kubrick went off the deep end near the end of his career, overrating his own ability as a director, thinking he could do no wrong when in fact he was creating a film that was embarrassingly awful and made his actors look like morons.

In 1975 Kubrick hadn't gone quite so far off the deep end, and what we have here is a movie with a lot of strong points, able to sustain our interest, more or less, for three hours, a story well told, with some very interesting scenes.  I can almost give it a thumbs up.  The 3 star rating shows my indecision on whether or not to recommend this very long flick.

There are some picturesque battle scenes from the Seven Years War, featuring the British, French, and Prussian armies.  Most of our time is spent with the upper crust of Europe, a tiresome bunch to begin with.  My God, they were almost as rich as baseball players!",1118620800,,2204,4.456140350877193

Unfortunately, many people with postmodern sensibilities won't ""get"" it: it is slow paced, pensive, and nearly three hours in length. Despite the fame of the director, this gem of a movie remains relatively unknown and very underrated. Its most striking aspect is the cinematography - at times BL feels like a Renaissance painting in motion; but, make no mistake about it, BL is truly remarkable on all levels.",1117756800,4,464,4.886075949367089
1214226,5,B00000FYPB,"The whole film is a work of art. Clich&eacute;d as that sounds, Kubrick (known for his perfectionism) really accomplished a cinematic feat in visually transferring works of art to film. Scenes throughout the film really echo 18th century paintings. The cinematography is some of the most beautiful ever done. New lenses were created for this film so that it could be used to film in candlelight. Kubrick really pushed the costume-drama forward. I have noticed for most of his films from the 60's and 70's, he really pushed the standard for any genre he took on. Just look at Dr. Strangelove, or 2001: Space Odyssey. I will conclude by just saying the obvious, this is a visual masterpiece.",1116374400,4,689,4.8474576271186445

1214228,4,B00000FYPB,"As has been previously pointed out, the music, costumes, and in general, the art direction of this film are impeccable. The film is a joy to behold--and to be hypnotized by. Yet it is still lacking. I can understand when others say that Kubrick cared more about bringing 18th century life to screen even at the expense of developing character. Many interactions in the film are very subtle--for example, when the Countess Lyndon is at the card table, seeing Barry for the first time, her response to his interest is expressed through her eyes, through the light movement of her mouth. It is barely visible, but it is there. Or we can consider the character of Reverend Runt, who is played wonderfully--his character is expressed through his every movement, through the way he turns the pages of the prayer-book during the wedding scene, through the way he looks at people, through the way he holds his hands. The result is that most of the movie advances slowly, meanderingly, via minute detail and creates an overall mood for the entire picture. Consequently where the film really falls short is where Kubrick brings in more traditional action in order to advance the plot. These scenes break the rhythm of the movie. A few examples: first the battle scene near the beginning of the film. It felt entirely unnatural, especially considering that the English regiment was getting shot at, but kept advancing without firing. Barry's loss of his friend in the skirmish seemed too melodramatic; the event also is one of the few times when the actor O'Neal, expresses any emotion. In fact, O'Neal is in two states for most of the movie--expressionless, or crying. His lack of expression is usually not a detriment, but he just does not have the range that the rest of the actors have, he does not seem to pay as much attention to detail of subtle body movement as the rest of the cast. Also, the scenes when Barry is beating his step-son, or the scenes of Brian's death seem very overdone. I suppose where many people complain that this movie is too slow, I wish it were slower yet.

Simply put, don't watch this movie if you want to see action, because most of it consists of slow scenes intermittently broken up with a little bit of ""fast action"". If you do watch it, you'll have to watch it closely because the spoken dialogue is usually subordinated to subtle expression. This is a film more for hard-core Kubrick fans, than for general audiences.",1111622400,6,2446,4.7283372365339575
1214229,5,B00000FYPB,"I am another who considers this film to be perhaps the finest cinematic feature ever produced.  I have a few other contenders in my mind, but ""Barry Lyndon"" continues to grow more and more in my affection and incredulity. I have watched it, I don't know how many times.  The DVD brings out it's sharpness, and I love going straight to my favorite scenes when I need an aesthetic pick-me-up. This is Kubrick at his prime, filmed after the scorching he received from the controversy over ""Clockwork,"" and after the disappointment he suffered from realizing that his dream of ""Napoleon"" would not come to fruition [and oh, what a great loss to all of us it was that he never had the chance to make that movie! One can only imagine how Kubrick would have filled out the character of the Great Provocateur and how that movie would have informed history!]. In ""Barry Lyndon,"" the chastened Kubrick comes roaring back from those two disappointments in all his strength and artistic genius--Kubrick the perfectionist doing the butterfly and backstroke in luscious irony.  Yes it's long, yes it's slow--of course it is, it's as slow as the universe, and equally amazing.  Every moment is fraught with the crispness of life moving forward and the irony of human ambition.  I admit, when I first saw it in 1976 in 70mm at the theater, I was dismayed with it's seeming tediousness, but I was 18 then and I am nearing 50 now, and I think I've learned that the eye and the senses have to look and look and look again--and that's what the eye does with this movie, it looks with Kubrick, and listens with Kubrick, and delights with the master in the presence of his masterpiece.  You stare at this movie, and you wait, and in that time spent waiting you find such incredible pleasure in every detail, watching every stroke of genius, every arranged perfection. This movie is simply abundant deliciousness with the accompaniment of Handel and Schubert and Bach and Irish traditional.  O'Neil is as banal and absurd as his character and his adventures are exquisitely outrageous on the most sublime level.  The cinematography and period reconstruction is pure eye candy.  And the musical score is pure eloquence, enrapturing as it is instructive.  Buy the soundtrack (see my other reviews, and get the CD now while you can), press the headphones against your ear, and relive over and over again that eternity in a moment when Redmond first walks out, oh so slowly and deliberately with the languorous texture of violin and piano and cello, to come close to, and then to accost, and to kiss Lady Lyndon.  The whole movie is the finest minuet moving forward and you only need grasp it's hand and pull it to you and move with it in it's rythm.  It is some of the most richly rewarding cinema you will ever experience if you allow it to be what it is--Kubrick the master, at the pinnacle of his craft.",1111190400,24,2880,4.669960474308301
1214230,4,B00000FYPB,"Slow as molasses in January, and as sweet, while the camera lingers, soulfully kissing and savoring each moment. With immaculate precision of detail, Kubrick constructs his story of the hapless rogue Lyndon, portrayed by that expert at haplessness, Ryan O'Neal. Being no heavyweight in the acting department (but being cute enough to not have to be), the lengthy script about the rogue's success has been tailored in such a way that it flatters O'Neal's meager abilities. By method of Michael Hordem's sonorous narration, much of what O'Neal has to do is look handsome in his 18th century wardrobe. And that he does. The same is virtually true of co-star Marisa Berenson, who also co-starred in *Cabaret*. She is not an incredibly gifted actress, but she is indeed, an incredibly gifted beauty. So, she, too, must rely on her attractiveness. This is a time-honored Hollywood tradition that still lives and breathes today. If they gave Oscars for being attractive (and they do, don't they, Gwyneth?), this movie would have raked in the awards. It won four, anyway - Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Musical Adaptation. Clocking in at 3 hours and 3 minutes, Kubrick fans are deeply conflicted over whether or not this is a masterpiece.",1106352000,3,1285,5.0947867298578196

I can't even begin to imagine how Kubrick directed some of the scenes in this movie. They seem so real and intense, I forgot on several occasions that this was simply fiction.

The lighting, which is some technology I don't quite understand, is all natural. I loved this. Every scene glows with warmth and beauty, and the characters look even more fine in their finery.

And I seem to be one of the only reviewers that finds no fault with Ryan O'Neal as Barry Lyndon! The first few scenes I was not impressed so much, but the movie is very lengthy and there was plenty of time for O'Neal to prove himself apt and perfect for the part. I think some people are mistaking the trueness of a sometimes bland character for a bland actor.

One of the things I loved best about this movie was the fact that the protagonist, if you can call him that, isn't someone you can always sympathise with. Barry is the central character, and you begin to feel like you understand him, but you definently don't always like him.

And I won't even start on the music, except to say that while in the beginning I found the contrast between beautiful soft music and violent scenes somewhat jarring, it evolved into an art. The music was playing in my head for days after I watched this. Exquisite.

1214242,5,B00000FYPB,"Contrary to other reviewers here, I believe Ryan O'Neal played just the kind of character that Thackeray intended -- someone who is smart but not too smart. Indeed, he has to rely on the position and cleverness of others to succeed. His saving grace is that even in his worst moments, he is insufficently introspective to stop loving himself, and the good feelings he can't repress are something others cannot fail to respond positively to, despite their better judgement. [Dare I say, not unlike our current President!?!] O'Neal effortlessly conveys this, and yet when his character is called upon to be ruthless and physically violent, he does so with satisfying abandon. The narration is perfectly done - i felt as though I were reading the novel myself. One last thing -- the photography is overwhelmingly beautiful.

1214243,3,B00000FYPB,"Here is Stanley Kubrick's most beautiful and eloquent film, taken from the novel by Thackery, of an 18th century slacker turned hustler turned wealthy denizen who ends up the same way he started -- poor, uneducated and living in squalor. It is a morality tale to compete with those of that other great English novelist, Dickens.

The story involves Barry's attempts at romance, which tend to backfire, his departure from home, travels, involvement in European wars, involvement with a thief and, finally, his marriage to the Duchess of Lyndon, from whom he gets his name. This is where his life begins to go backward in a never ending spiral of betrayal, promiscuity, brutality and overspending.

Filmed in natural lighting in fine European settings, this is Kubrick's most opulent and staggeringly beautiful film. Its story is so eloquently told it is difficult to find fault. Two things, in my mind, separate this film from a typically great film: casting and the use of music.

To this day I still don't understand why Kubrick cast Ryan O'Neal in the lead. Here is a one-dimensional actor that could not find a second dimiension even with this wonderful script and when being directed by the world's greatest filmmaking genius. Even though I enjoy this flim enormously, I always wonder what it could have been had an actor the stature of Jack Nicholson or Robert DeNiro played Barry.

My second complaint is the way the music is done in this film. People that have seen ""Dr Strangelove"", ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"" know Kubrick has an odd sense of humor with music in his films. Until this movie, he used this music in natural arrangements.

However, in ""Barry Lyndon"", Kubrick allowed a music producer to rearrange the music as a way to affect the on screen action. In particular, Schubert's andante theme from his Piano Trio No. 2 was used as Barry's theme of failure in the latter portions of the movie.

The music was performed in trio form for the movie but taken at a slower pace than was prevailing at the time. The effect was to deaden the film. It added futility, not drama or despair. Kubrick understands music and its effects and still allowed this to happen thoroughout this otherwise splendid movie.

I will never be long between viewings of this movie, for it is a work of art rare in moviemaking. But I also will never forgive the two major shortcomings that keep it from ascending to the summit of Kubrick films. Instead, this one is grounded in the middle drawer of his movie cabinet.",1097971200,,2524,4.762013729977117

1214248,5,B00000FYPB,"Jack Warner is said to have once told an underling not to bring him any movies about people who write with feather pens. The mogul believed that costume epics were dull and plodding, guaranteed to test the patience of most audiences.

When Stanley Kubrick delivered his film ""Barry Lyndon"" to Warner Bros. in 1975, the studio's namesake was long gone, and that was probably for the best since he may have chosen not to release what is the ultimate feather pen movie and also Kubrick's greatest masterpiece. If asked to do the impossible and name the best film ever made, I wouldn't hesitate to give my vote to ""Barry Lyndon.""

Plodding? Yes. Dull? To those who demand rapid fire editing, it may be the dullest movie ever. For those who appreciate fine literature and fine art, ""Barry Lyndon"" is an absolute feast, visually, aurally, and dramatically. Based on an obscure novel by William Thackeray, it's the story of an Irish lad climbing the ranks of English society, alienating everyone in his path.

As Redmond Barry, Ryan O' Neal's Irish brogue comes and goes, but despite that inconsistency, he acquits himself well. Also worth noting is Michael Hordern's narrator, often seeming to express disapproval for the main character as he perceptively surveys his exploits.

The real star of the film is Kubrick and his production team who recreate the 17th century in a way that makes the viewer truly appreciate what life must have been like at the time. Watching the women, most notably the beautiful Marisa Berenson, sashaying about in glamourous dresses, one wonders how they could endure the apparent discomfort of such cumbersome clothing. It's no wonder they took so many baths. And watching Barry rise in society, one is aware that the society is ultimately every bit as superficial and uncouth as the rogue ""hero"" himself.

The movie is slow, very slow, but so was life in the era depicted, and the achievement of ""Barry Lyndon"" is that it transports the viewer to an earlier but far from simpler time in a way that no other film has done. The cinematography and art direction are peerless, as is Leonard Rosenman's score which adapts the work of some of the greatest classical composers.

Most movies, even the good ones, are as light as popcorn, easily forgotten when the lights come back on. The patient viewer who gives ""Barry Lyndon"" a chance to work its magic will be rewarded with a true cinematic experience.

Why is it that ""Barry Lyndon"" has in my mind surpassed other more revered works.  You can cite the magnificent technical attributes of the film(cinematography,art direction, costume design,music), however, a technically proficient movie is not necessarily a moving experience.  I would have to say that what elevates this movie is the screenplay and the acting.  Kubrick does a great job moving the story from Redmond Barry's youth to his downfall among the English aristocracy.  Kubrick has also gathered a great cast of actors here in supporting roles(Parick Magee, Leonard Rossiter, Marie Kean, Godfrey Quigley, Steven Berkof, etc.).  What cannot be overlooked is the performance of Ryan O'Neal.  If some find him wooden or off-putting should consider that he is essentially playing an unsympathetic rogue.  It is a daring performance and O'Neal is utterly convincing whether playing a headstrong teenager or a cold manipulator.  One gripe about the DVDs in the Kubrick Collection: with the exception of ""The Shining"", the only extras on these discs are trailers.",1091836800,117,1190,5.21578947368421
1214250,4,B00000FYPB,"Stanley Kubrick's 1975 film adaptation of Thackeray's novel by the same title.  It is a narrative epic of an empvorsished Irish upstart (Ryan O'Neil) whose ostracism sets him off on adventurous journeys into the high and low society of 18th century Europe. Although the acting is somewhat uneven, the force of the narrative is brought through more by Kubrick's brilliant stylized sceneries and moving music than acting talent.

 Ryan O'Neil as the lead character is probably the weakest part of the film. His acting skills aren't really suited for a period film such as this one. His Irish accent starts sounding more and more American as the film progresses. His expressions also tend to be more reserved than they should be in certain scenes. The screenplay is well paced and the cinematography is impeccable. Shot in natural light, Kubrick gives the audience a lush sequence of images that capture the individual themes of the story. One minor flaw is some of the music selections. Although the use of Schubert's chamber works are well suited to the scenes and their themes, the music is out of context for a film dealing with 18th century Europe. Schubert was a romantic composer in the 19th century. The romantic movement in music came over 30-40 years after the setting of this story through the work of Ludwig Van Beethoven. In contrast, the film is set in the late 18th century during which the musical styles were Baroque (Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, etc.) and Roccocco (Mozart, Haydn, etc.) The film's choice of music would therefore be equivalent to including music by Van Halen in a drama set during the early 1950s.

 Apart from these minor details, the film is a masterpiece of directing and cinematography. I strongly recommend it. If you like this film, I would also recommend Riddley Scott's first feature film, ""The Duellists"", with Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel. Scott uses similar montages and cinematographic styles as Kubrick for this film which is set in Napoleanic France.",1090368000,3,1995,4.978978978978979
1214251,5,B00000FYPB,"Barry Lyndon is traditionally seen as Stanley Kubrick's weakest film. Yet a certain number of newer reviewers - and Martin Scorsese - are only now beginning to see that this film has been terribly underrated.
When I first saw this movie I sided very much with those who believed the film to be pointless eye candy. I couldn't see any point to this movie, which seemed to consist of more or less random events with no real beginning or end, and nothing worth remarking on in between.
Of course, years later I began having flashbacks of this movie, and was sorely tempted to buy the DVD, a purchase I finally made (the DVD is very good).
""Barry Lyndon"" is as much a Greek tragedy as Godfather Part II or the second half of Gone with the Wind. Here Barry Lyndon is trapped by fate, after a series of events set off by aspects of his own character. His very attempts to make himself still richer, towards the end of the film results in an awful mess that is suspiciously reminiscent of Gone with the Wind. I think Margaret Mitchell may possibly have read the novel.(*spoiler!* Hmm, where have I seen a child falling off a horse before?)
Barry Lyndon, as a nouveau riche social climber desperately trying to find what we would call ""the American Dream"" is strangely modern as a figure. The story of his rise and fall is like that of any modern, money-hungry social climber, and is quite relevant to our present world.
At any rate, the film is also a masterpiece of atmosphere and style. The care with which the film was made was clearly excruciating, with scenes as carefully plotted out and filmed as any oil painting. Despite Kubrick's reputation as a rather emotionless director, there are plenty of funny scenes. My favourite scenes in this regard are the scenes showing the Chevalier de Balibari playiong cards - the innocent look on his face as he cheats his opponents gets funnier every time you see it.
Of course, there is the famous Schubert Trio scene, where Redmond Barry seduces Lady Lyndon in an incredibly long, slow, but well-timed scene. The movements of eighteenth century aristocrats through their ritualised world is truly as absorbing to watch, as the incredibly slow space pod scenes in Space Odyssey.
Of course, there is no Star Gate here; no profundity of theme or mysticism; no deep truths. Barry Lyndon does not try to be as deep as Clockwork Orange, in the same way that Scorsese's Age of Innocence did not aspire to the depth of Taxi Driver. That is not the point. The film could be said to be more style than substance; but in that case it could be said to join Citizen Kane and Blade Runner. It's still damn fine filmmaking.
The original novel frankly bears little resemblance to the finished film. (I am reading it now). The novel Barry Lyndon is truly a picaresque novel with a rascally, lively narrator far removed from Ryan O'Neal's very understated portrayal; and in fact the general atmosphere of the book reminded me much more of Oliver Twist or Gulliver's travels than the stately and classy environment of the film. In this respect Kubrick has taken the skeleton of plot from the novel, and laced it with copious amounts of Kubrickian flesh.",1088553600,9,3174,4.659536541889483
1214252,5,B00000FYPB,"When director Stanley Kubrick lensed a film based on William Makepeace Thackeray's novel ""Barry Lyndon,"" many fans wondered why. Why would a man who made the science fiction classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" a film set in the future about man's move into outer space, go so far into the past to film a story about a guy social climbing his way through the nineteenth century English aristocracy? Good question. Fortunately, the answer, if there is one, isn't nearly as important as the fact that Kubrick made the film. ""Barry Lyndon"" may well rank as the finest piece of cinematic art made in the last thirty years. I personally love watching period piece films, and this movie ranks at the very apogee of the pictures from the genre that are often made but rarely successful. The only other film I have seen that matches Kubrick's eye for detail and flair for style is Eric Rohmer's ""The Marquise of O,"" another film lifted from the pages of an early nineteenth century writer. Both of these men, but especially Kubrick, seemed to realize that the only way we can understand the distant past is to look closely at the things they left behind. Therefore, ""Barry Lyndon"" borrows heavily from paintings, letters, and accounts of the era. It's very difficult to spot an anachronism in this film. The movie has a timeless, ageless feel most other period pictures fail to capture.
The story follows the trials and travails of an Irishman named Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal). Born into poverty on a small farm, Barry first runs into trouble during his teens when he falls in love with his cousin. The family seeks to remove young Redmond from the picture because an English officer, a Captain Quinn, has taken a shine to the girl. If they allow the cousins to marry, the family will not take part in the officer's considerable wealth. Barry refuses to play along, challenging the Englishman to a duel whereupon he promptly puts a bullet through the officer's chest. Whisked away from the scene by family members concerned about the duel, our hero joins the English army as a way to escape from his bleak future. Then comes war, with England fighting nearly everyone else on the continent. Barry, unimpressed with the idea of dying for his king, deserts but soon falls into the hands of the enemy. Faced with the threat of execution, Redmond agrees to join the Prussian Army, which turns out to be worse than his stint with the English. Fortune smiles when the Irishman saves the life of an officer, an officer with connections to the ministry of information. A plot is hatched whereby Redmond Barry will act as a confidante of the Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee), a French diplomat suspected of espionage.
De Balibari is actually an Irishman living in exile, a fact that causes Redmond Barry to confess his true identity to the man. The Chevalier, impressed with such honesty, promptly takes his fellow countryman into his confidence. The two form a plan that allows them both to sneak out of the country, whereupon they take up lives as confidence men and swindlers on the continent. It is during his tenure as a card shark that Barry meets Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), a beautiful and extremely wealthy woman married to the ancient, crotchety Sir Charles Lyndon (Frank Middlemass). Redmond ingratiates himself into Lady Lyndon's graces to the point that when her husband dies, the good lady marries our hero. Redmond Barry disappears, replaced by Barry Lyndon, a wealthy man with property, money, and connections. Lyndon knows his success depends on his wife, so he spends enormous sums to curry favor with the court. He hopes to acquire his own title, which would translate into his own property and money deeded him by the Crown. Life isn't all roses, as Barry Lyndon must cope with Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali), Lady Lyndon's sullen and hateful son as well as his wife's suspicious assistant Reverend Samuel Runt. Lyndon thinks he's got it made when his wife gives birth to a child, Bryan, who carries the precious noble blood. What goes up must invariably come down, however, as a series of massive tragedies rock the Lyndon household.
""Barry Lyndon"" is an intriguing film. One wonders why Kubrick made it. Perhaps the director liked the idea of an underclass individual scheming his way into the rigid upper classes of the time. Perhaps the movie is a morality tale about a ruthless scalawag eventually getting what he deserves. If the answer is the latter, I don't think it works. If Barry Lyndon were truly ruthless, he would have seen to it that Lord Bullingdon pulled a disappearing act. Doing so would have assured his child's role as heir of the Lyndon title. Whatever the reasons behind this film, you don't have to worry about it too much to enjoy Kubrick's work. The set pieces and costumes are phenomenal, the acting wonderful, the photography breathtaking. Especially developed for this film was a special camera lens that could work by candlelight. The musical score consists of Mozart, Vivaldi, Bach, Schubert, and Handel.
Arguably the best element of the film is the way Kubrick places his characters in a way that resemble paintings of the period. Pay attention to the scenes that take place in the garden where Barry meets Lady Lyndon or the confrontation between Bullingdon and Barry at the gentleman's club. You can literally see characters move into position and pose as though for a portrait. And that final duel! I could watch that scene a million times-and probably have. A wonderful film, ""Barry Lyndon"" on DVD contains only a trailer as an extra. I'm not complaining too much, though. The movie is more than enough reason to buy the DVD. Watch it and wonder.",1086739200,7,5689,4.835897435897436
1214253,4,B00000FYPB,"_Barry Lyndon_ is absolutely stunning to watch.  Kubrick's masterful hand at orchestrating sweeping views of naturally lit countryside transports the audience into the 18th century and alongside our characters.  Some complain that Kubrick, while commanding the visual aspects of the film, allows the acting to fall by the wayside.  Ryan O'Neill does not do an adequate job as Lyndon, it is claimed, failing to capture the character's motivation and nature.  I disagree most strongly on this point.  Kubrick and O'Neill have managed to capture a human being, one who defies the trend of most Hollywood films and popular fiction.  Lyndon is not the loveable character-his rise to power is not paved with nobility and honor, nor is his downfall laced with a deep sense of tragedy.  Yet, I still feel for Lyndon's character in the declining stages of his life.  Just as he is not completely approachable, he is not repulsive either.  By allowing this level of subtlety to emerge from the character, Kubrick and O'Neill have managed to create a tragedy more along the lines of Shakespeare's _Coriolanus_ than some sentimental special on the Hallmark channel.
_Barry Lyndon_ clocks in at just over three hours, breaking once in the middle for an intermission.  For its visual appeal, it is worthy every penny, though it may leave some members of the audience wishing for quicker pacing and a plotline that is easier to digest.  If you have the time and are a fan of Kubrick's masterpieces, I could not recommend this film more highly-just make some popcorn during the intermission and stretch your legs.",1086134400,,1597,5.011363636363637
1214254,5,B00000FYPB,"If you appreciate good filmmaking you must watch this film! This is an artistic masterpiece for those who appreciation the visual arts. Some reviewers might complain as to the lack of character development, which I agree with, but I don't think it was in Kubrick's interest to have the viewer identify with Ryan O'neal, that focus would do a disservice to the viewer in that it would make him ignore the films more aesthetic qualities. Like a great masterpiece Barry Lyndon's magic does not lie with a single character but with the work itself. Barry Lyndon's strengths lie in the totality of the film and in the immense beauty that is found in every scene. This film is grandeur immortalized, a picturesque view of 18th century Europe. This is a delightful film, and cannot be measured in terms of success and mass appeal, this film is well beyond that.",1081641600,3,854,4.738255033557047
1214255,4,B00000FYPB,"""Barry Lyndon"" is Stanley Kubrick's forgotten ""masterpiece"".  Sandwiched chronologically between ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971)  and ""The Shining"" (1980), it has received less adulation from the press and public than some of Kubrick's other triumphs (""Dr. Strangelove"";  ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"") and did poorly at the box office upon its initial release in 1975.
Based on the 1844 William Makepeace Thackeray novel ""The Luck of Barry Lyndon"" (with some of the usual artistic liberties that Kubrick often took with his adaptations of books) this film follows the travails of Redmond Barry, an 18th century, hot-headed, charmingly unscrupulous Irish rapscallion who will stop at nothing to join the ranks of the British aristocracy.
Through a series of mishaps and misadventures, we follow Barry from his native Ireland through the Seven Years' War (1756-63), through the grand gambling palaces of Europe where he eventually woos and marries the beautiful and wealthy Lady Lyndon and adopts her name, much to the chagrin of her son Lord Bullingdon, who vows never to let Barry achieve his dream of joining the gentry.
Kubrick's ace-in-the-hole is his D.P. John Alcott who deservedly won an Oscar for Best Cinematography.  Shot in Ireland, Germany and England, the viewer constantly gets the feeling of viewing a classic 18th century painting.  It never gets dull watching the absolute beauty of this film, and I personally marvelled at all the hard work that must have gone into making it.
The music is also wonderful, as Kubrick once again shows excellent taste in which music fits a particular scene.  The film's opening scenes have gorgeous Irish folk music from The Chieftains, and its later passages are eloquently followed by the works of J.S. Bach and Vivaldi...and are repeated so often it's impossible for their concertos not to get stuck in your head!
The acting itself is above average, but somewhat mixed.  Ryan O'Neal is adequate as Barry Lyndon, although his attempts at an Irish accent are so-so at best.  He frequently fades into his SoCal drawl during the film.  He manages to hold the film together, but he is not its strongest performer.  Marisa Berenson (Lady Lyndon) isn't given much to do here, but she makes the most of her isolation and melancholy.  The true stars are Leon Vitali (disgustingly weasely and sadly sympathetic as the adult Lord Bullingdon) and Murray Melvin (the cold, restrained Reverand Runt).  Both actors steal every scene which features them.  I got the feeling that Kubrick focused so much on the photography of ""Barry Lyndon"" that the film's acting suffered as a result.  Maybe Kubrick wanted to illustrate the coldness of the British upper classes.  If so, then mission accomplished.
Much has been noted of this film's ""coldness"" and much of it is deserved.  Michael Hordern's narration helps explain the historical context to the viewer and gives a human perspective to things, but sometimes takes away from some of the film's drama.  Despite the valid accusations of coldness, it should be noted that there is restrained passion here in certain scenes (especially between the young Redmond Barry and his first love, his cousin Nora Brady) and that you'll be hard-pressed to find ANY Kubrick film with large amounts of emotional warmth.
Another thing that merits mentioning is the film's pacing and length.  It clocks in at 3 hours and 4 minutes, and the final climax between Barry Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon is UNBELIEVEABLY slow.  I highly recommend taking a snack break or a quick walk during the film's intermission.  If you're looking for fast-paced action, this is not the place to find it.  However, if you are willing to be challenged and allow yourself to slowly follow the 18th century aristocratic pace of life, you will enjoy this film.
Perhaps ironically for such an ornate film, the DVD itself does not come with many frills aside from a theatrical trailer.  No commentaries, no behind-the-scenes documentaries, no cast biographies.
Overall, ""Barry Lyndon"" is definitely quality viewing for the Stanley Kubrick enthusiast.  This movie is decidedly NOT mainstream Hollywood fare, and is a challenging and beautiful examination of the mores and prejudices of 18th century European high society.",1080432000,5,4250,5.1438953488372094
1214256,5,B00000FYPB,"Fascinating:
I'm presently fascinated by the harsh critical evaluation of this movie. Typically the criticism is focused on the ""Pace"" or boring lack of forward motion exhibited by the director. I agree, if after 30 minutes (right about the duel scene) you aren't 100% enthralled, you need to bag-out and turn off. By that critical moment if the pace is disturbing you, the remaining 3 hours will bring you to complete distraction.
However, if after this first 30 or so minutes you are still tuned in, you are fully prepped for an engrossing and completely artistic experience of absolute joy. Really, that's the breaking point 30 minutes. Kubrick takes his time to make his points. God bless the man. You either get it or you don't have the time. As my film critic friend put it, ""Hey, at that point, go watch Bad boys or Scream 5"". The point being, it's not pop culture, it's a piece of work (art work) and it required some development.
It's Okay if you have other things to do, simply go do them. This movie however should not be judged by Quick edit points and chop/chop depictions of every moment. All things are given their proper width and space.
Perhaps if you've ever read a book, this is a similar experience. It takes time. Characters are developed and moments unfold as though reality had a place in the thing. If you choose to review this film in a critical manner, do so on it's faults, not it's pace. I will leave the faults for you to discover, frankly they are few.
Enjoy.
Relax, have some tea. But for the sake of us all don't complain that this movie does not fit into your fast food world.",1078531200,5,1609,4.513698630136986
1214257,5,B00000FYPB,"Often underrated, this is Kubrick at his best. The cinematography is, of course, breathtaking, lavish and restrained at the same time. The Movie is a kind of orchestrated satire of the western formal rituals of violence and war, from the personal duel to the international battleground, where human beings are parading as cannon fodder. It's terribly appalling and terribly funny. Together with Paths of Glory (1957) and Full Metal Jacket (1987) it makes a monumental Kubrickesque War-trilogy.",1076371200,2,493,5.415584415584416

The gorgeous cinematography and the impeccable lighting that capture the lush greens & castles of Britain are a sight to behold.  He places the viewer *into* the eighteenth century. You are living it.
The pace of the film may be somewhat sluggish, it's a 3-hour piece, and several scenes offer the viewer no dialogue at all because this was a time when the gesture, the look, the subtle formality communicated far more than the spoken word. A sharp contrast to today's ""fast and furious"" approach to film-making. But that's Kubrick for you -- much more to savour than to devour. A spectacle in a class by itself. Must-watch if you can lay your hands on it.",1071360000,2,758,4.8307692307692305
1214260,2,B00000FYPB,"This film is a biography in the most straightforward sense: It simply recounts the events of this historical person's extrordinary life. Kubrick's goal, one supposes, was to bring this character to life, for us to bear witness to his troubled heart. Unfortunately, by focusing his efforts on the period sets and costumes, he misses the mark, and leaves us struggling to truly connect with or understand who Redmond Barry really was or how any of his myriad life-decisions were made. I suppose all those details were lost to the filter of History, and Kubrick does not exert his license to flesh out his historical protagonist with human characteristics. Redmond Barry's life involved many dramatic changes of circumstance and character, perhaps too many for even for a 3-hour movie to pull off convincingly. Also, contrary to other reviewers, I felt that casting all-American pretty boy Ryan O'Neal as the Irish-commoner-turned-English-nobleman was a poor choice. In other words, it's not all Kubrick's fault that we can't relate to the protagonist. Beautifully filmed eye-candy, but missing the emotional hook.",1069632000,5,1111,5.318181818181818

I've read Thackeray's novel, and I really think that Kubrick was true to the story, almost to the letter of the book.  Even though the movie was long, it was so beautiful to look at, that I found it to be a pleasure, and the 3 plus hours just flew by.
I especially loved the use of all natural light, including filming in candelight, and like other folks who have reviewed this movie, the frames were like pictures that had come to life.  Lady Lyndon looked just like one of Gainsborough's peaches & cream wind-blown beauties, it was breathtaking.
The worst part of the movie was Ryan O'Neill,  he's a rotten actor, really wooden, and his frat boy looks were not consistent with my mind's picture of Redmond Barry.
But even he did ok under Kubrick's guidance.  I wonder how this movie would have turned out if there had been a really good young actor in the lead role.
In any event, Barry Lyndon is a masterpeice, and should not be missed.",1064448000,7,1143,4.297674418604651

Title character is 18th century Irish rogue eventually finding his way into aristocratic English society. He is a stranger in a strange land(at one point dons Prussian Army officers uniform that leads to one of my favorite scenes with Hardy Kruger), and once Lyndon finds himself in new setting he must figure out what is the ""right"" behaviour. The story is actually a tragedy. All glory is fleeting applies here.
  DVD transfer is as beautiful as the costumes, camerawork, music, and lighting(famous indoor candle-lit scenes are amazing).
Stanley Kubrick wanted originally to make a period film about Napoleon, but when ""Waterloo"" failed at the box office he abandoned it. Lyndon, I guess, became his period piece gem. He would not make another film until 5 years later with 1980's The Shining.",1061078400,,871,5.083916083916084

While the acting is restrained (but still very good), it is not devoid of passion, it is merely reflecting society at the time.
The real star of the show here is the cinematography, the set designs and the costumes.  The film looks so real that it seems that the viewer has stepped into an 18th century painting.
While Barry Lyndon isn't as shocking as Full Metal Jacket or Clockwork Orange or as funny as Dr. Strangelove or as weird as 2001; it is still a great, if delibrately paced film with excellent cinematography and sets.",1055376000,,753,4.481751824817518
1214274,4,B00000FYPB,"I just revisited Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon several years after my first viewing. I can remember not enjoying it so well the first time around, however, the second time I really did like it. It really doesn't feel like a three-hour film. When I first saw it, around the age of 18 or so, I was expecting something closer to the Kubrick films that I knew and loved like 2001, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining. I did not expect a rather straight-forward period costume epic. I thought there would be something out of the ordinary about it. Some bizarre characters, wicked twists, graphic violence, dreamlike scenes. Yet Barry Lyndon contains none of this.
It's an epic drama about the rise and fall of an Irish rogue in the late 18th century. Lavishly photographed, using only natural light, real costumes, good acting (with possible exception of Ryan O'Neal), but somehow lacking the Kubrick feel. It's a pretty conventional film. There's nothing really outlandish about it. However, being written (based on a 19th century novel), produced and directed by the man, it is undeniably a Stanley Kubrick film and deserves attention as such. Perhaps the most Kubrickian (if I may use the term) thing about Barry Lyndon is how un-Kubrick-like it is. Audiences had come to expect the unexpected from Kubrick, and what would be more unpredictable than to follow-up a film like A Clockwork Orange with a costume epic set in the 18th century? That's the way he was. Always taking the divergent path.
Now, regarding the film itself, it's very well made, not surprising considering its creator. The story of Redmond Barry is interesting, particularly in its historical context. Several wonderful scenes alone make the film worth watching. A small battle scene during the Seven Years War, the card-playing scenes, and the duel between Barry and his stepson near the end. There are some sporadic scenes with dazzling camera work and Kubrick manages to sneak in a couple of his tracking shots. The film is leisurely paced, as nearly all Kubrick films, but interest is always maintained.
I don't think that anyone would claim Barry Lyndon Kubrick's greatest achievement, but it is a remarkable achievement nonetheless. Perhaps more accessible to mainstream audiences than his typical work, Barry Lyndon is definitely an enjoyable experience for fans of Kubrick, but perhaps more so for fans of lavish costume epics. So enjoy it for what it is, just don't expect any of the old ultraviolence.",1050537600,6,2479,5.004842615012106
1214275,5,B00000FYPB,"The late 18th century United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland was a great time to be a gentleman. One young, romantic, rakish man named Redmond Barry wishes to rise to this distinguished title: to have land, status, money, beautiful women, and to hobnob with the elite of the age. After losing the hand of his first love, Nora, to a captain in the army, Redmond resolves to make it his life's goal to gain rank, first in the army, then among Europe's aristocracy. He is not the most scrupulous of social climbers and lies, cheats, and fakes his way up. But there is misfortune awaiting him after he makes his way to the top . . .
Inspired by Kubrick's favorite 18th century paintings more than the Thacakaray novel of the title, this film could not be more different from Kubrick's previous film, A Clockwork Orange--it is almost free from blood, sex, and random brutality (and was accordingly rated PG). Many have accused this film of being lifeless and boring, but I beg to differ: while indeed the cinematography, the use of all natural lighting, authentic costumes, and realism are its most outstanding features, Barry Lyndon is emotionally restrained, but it is not underacted or devoid of passion. Emotions are there, but it's kept just under the surface, as etiquette demanded for people of Barry's rank at the time. The admittedly slow pace of the film reflects the slower pace of life of the age and also allows the viewer to take in the atmosphere much better than quick cuts and loud action allows. (It really is not a film suited for modern attention spans in that regard.) This is a historical film in the best sense--the point is to immerse yourself in a reimagining of the past than to follow a plot. The only thing, for me, that breaks that illusion is that some of the music is not quite of its period; Schubert's piano trio does not belong in the 18th century, but the 19th. It does fit the mood, though. (More Bach would have been appreciated instead.) Barry Lyndon is probably a film best seen on video, and absorbed in the comfort of one's home--it's a very leisurely film that probably would try the patience of a theater audience, but I can't imagine a better way to spend three hours on a lazy afternoon. This is, by far, Kubrick's most underrated film and a masterpiece of historical filmmaking.",1047600000,6,2336,4.658595641646489

First off, Kubrick never made a flawed film. Secondly, I would rank Barry Lyndon one of his best works. The cinematography by John Alcott is absolutly superb. Barry Lyndon is definitely one of the best photographed films of all time. Now, I do agree that the film is very long and fairly slow but if you keep with it and don't give up on it, you will be rewarded for your efforts. It is an artistic masterpiece created so perfectly. One reason being that Kubrick is a control-freak and a perfectionist. The music is synchronized wonderfully with the actor movement, the camera movement and the narrator. Anyone who says it is inferior to Kubrick favorites such as Dr. Strangelove or 2001 or Clockwork Orange hasn't really looked underneath the surface enough (the surface being how slow it is)and can't recognize good art when they see it. Sure there isn't a car explosion every 13 seconds or a robotic grenade launcher roaming the streets of LA, but all the elements of cinema and art are beautifully assembled.

This movie sounds beautiful.  Music by classical composers of the highest calibre and incidental traditional music by The Chieftans is staggering.  There is never the jarring feel of non-period music or sounds, no cars, no synthesizers.
This movie is boring.  Ryan O'Neal looks as if he is made out of a very fine quality of wax -- he never emotes, never even appears to stir.  Nothing touches him physically or emotionally.  The plot is dull, the acting duller.  There is no point in the movie where I give a damn about any of the characters, least of all our titular hero.  No passion, no interest, no involvement; everything is poor affectation, as if the tale is taking place at two or three removes from the characters supposedly involved.

Cinematography is brilliant, and the costumes and makeup are top notch, but the screenplay failed to meet my expecatations. This film has no Kubrickian twists, images or characters, that probably being because it was based on W.M. Thackery's novel. The character of Barry Lyndon is quite easily a deplorable one and that adds to why I didn't enjoy this film. In the begining you like Mr. Barry but in the end you can't help but despise him. Since he is the main character, it has a toll on the over-all film. The most Kubrickian scene in this film is the horse scene and the scenes worth watching are the card games. The card game scenes really give one a sense of life during the 16th Century, not to mention the impeccable cinematography and costumes showcased in the scene. On the negative side, this film is too long and needed editing. If you are a fan of costume dramas, you will adore this film much more than I. Kubrick fans: you will be disappointed.

There were no artificial lights used in this movie.  It was all done with a newly developed lense and candle light.  Innovative and spectacular.  A true work of art.  There is something about Stanely's movies where once you see a moment of his film, you can't turn away until it is over.

But that doesn't mean that every movie he made was great (anyone see Eyes Wide Shut?). Barry Lyndon is not a great movie. It's a period piece, and it seems well researched. The costumes are great. The sets are magnificant. And the photography is beautiful. I heard somewhere that it was like watching a painting move. And that is pretty accurate. Kubrick paid very close attention to detail, and it is a very beautiful picture to watch. The problem is that the characters are one dimensional, Lord Bullingdon being the one exception. The acting is wooden. The story moves at such a slow pace. The movie feels like it goes on for hours and hours. It's hard to believe that the same guy who made A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket is the same filmmaker who made this movie. It's just plain boring.

That is unfortunate because I believe this an excellent film  in just about every respect:  a compelling and witty story (it's really a comedy more than anything else), beautiful sets and locations, costumes and lush cinematography  are among its many delights. Despite the three hour length and relaxed pacing Kubrick's assured direction and the strong performances preclude any sense of boredom. I saw and enjoyed this film when it was released in 1975 and enjoyed it even more in 2002. I'm only sorry I waited so long to see it again. The DVD remastering is superb-everything looks clear and vibrant. My only quibble is with the score which won an Oscar for ""best adapted score"". Kubrick's one great weakness IMO is that he seemed to think that his recurrent practice of  stitching together bits of classical music (i.e. ""2001"" et al)  was superior to hiring a professional composer to produce  tailor made scores-  and this already great film could have been greater still, had he hired John Williams, Alex North, Jerry Goldsmith or any number of other fine composers to enhance ""Barry Lyndon"".

1214296,5,B00000FYPB,"This is another Kubrick movie that I have changed my mind about over the years.  I found it too slow and dull when I saw it on release.  But now, with time and perspective, and with the luxury of DVD & home theatre I find it a beautiful and satisfying experience.

First, of course, is its gorgeous look which won deserved Oscars for the Cinematographer & others.  It is fanatically correct as to the period look & details.  Much of the photography resembles the great paintings of English life in the 18th Century and the look & manner of everything has a complete authenticity.  The story of Kubrick making his own cameras & lenses to photograph candlelit scenes naturally is well known.  But it remains impressive, being the first and best approximation of what life must have looked like and been lived prior to electricity.

Next the pace.  It is slow.  Actually, today I would say it is stately, matching the slow rhythms of the minuet and the accompanying music.  I believe Kubrick intended to take us back to a time before speed, before haste, before life ruled by the nano second.  People moved slowly, travel was slow, battles were fought in slow movements.  The speed of life was bracketed by the footstep and the horse's gallop.  There was no way or reason to move faster.  Perhaps this is a failing in a modern motion picture, but it was a courageous and daring decision to pace your film to these unhurried beats.

The performances are fine.  They are strict in manner, formal, and precisely politely constrained to superficiality and rigidly controlled emotion.  Barry undoes all his work at attempting to break into fine society when he lets loose an unbridled rage and attacks his stepson.  It simply isn't done, dear boy.

That the voice-over narration is wry and offers often acidly arch observations of the story and characters is Kubrickian and certainly welcome.

So, this story of a rake's progress in attempting to climb and break into the world of aristocratic privelege and power has much to offer.  It certainly has an undeniable grandeur in its composition and  look and it does offer us as good a glimpse into what life in the long ago past might have been like as any movie is likely to achieve.

I once, by happenstance,  had a long conversation with Leon Vitali (Lord Bullingdon) on an Air India flight to London, discussing why Barry Lyndon didn't do well in America while it was a huge hit in Europe.  It boiled down to length, slowness & no Intermission.  Well, Leon, I was full of it!  It's a great film.

As I said at the outset, I have changed my mind about this film and now I give it 5 stars.  With some patience, it is a worthwhile journey.  But, if you're in a hurry, give it a pass.",1015891200,6,2725,4.579710144927536
1214297,5,B00000FYPB,"Stanley Kubrick's beautifully opulent production takes many liberties with William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque romance, The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq (1843), narrated in the first person depicting events from the eighteenth century.  In particular, Redmond Barry who becomes Barry Lyndon, is something of an admirable rake, whereas in Thackeray's novel he is a braggart, a bully and a scoundrel.  No matter.  Kubrick, in keeping with a long-standing filmland tradition, certainly has license, and Thackeray won't mind.

Ryan O'Neal is the unlikely star, and he does a good job, rising from humble Irish origins to the decadence of titled wealth, employing a two-fisted competence in the manly arts, including some soldiering, some thievery at cards and a presumed consummate skill in the bedroom.  Marisa Berenson plays Lady Lyndon, whom Barry has managed to seduce; and when her elderly husband dies, she marries Barry thus elevating his social and economic station in life.  But Barry is rather clumsy at playing at peerage, and bit by bit manages to squander most of the Lyndon fortune until his stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) grows old enough to do something about it.

This really is a gorgeous movie thanks to the exquisite sets and costumes and especially to John Alcott's dreamy cinematography and a fine score by Leonard Rosenman.  The 184 minutes go by almost without notice as we are engrossed in the rise and fall of Barry's fortunes.  There is fine acting support from Patrick Magee as the Chevalier de Balibari and Leonard Rossiter as Captain Quinn, and a number of lesser players, who through Kubrick's direction bring to life Europe around the time of the Seven Years War (1754-1763) when decadence and aristocratic privilege were still in full flower.

The script features two dueling scenes, the first showing the combatants firing at one another simultaneously at the drop of a white kerchief, the second has Barry and his stepson face each other ten paces apart, but due to the flip of a coin, the stepson fires first.  Both scenes are engrossing as we see the loading of the pistols with powder, ball and ramrod, and we are able to note how heavy the pistols are and how difficult it must be to hit a silhouette at even a short distance.  It is this kind of careful attention to directional detail that absorbs us in the action and makes veracious the story.  Notice too the way the British soldiers march directly en mass toward the French guns.  They actually used to fight battles that way!  Also note the incredible pile of hair atop Lady Lyndon's head.  Surely this is some kind of cinematic record.

Bottom line: one of Kubrick's best, certainly his most beautiful film.

The Film is Winner of Four Adacemy Awards-Including:Best Art Direction-Set Direction, Best Cineamtography, Best Costume Design and Best Score. The Film was also Nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture all by Stanley Kybrick.

1214299,1,B00000FYPB,"After the success of A Clockwork Orange Kubrick made this dud. It is based on a minor Thackery novel about a man who aquires wealth but is not accepted by the landed gentry. He spends huge amounts of money trying to get a title, and in the end loses everthing including a leg. Yes it has no contemporary relevance to anything.
The strong point of the film is the photography. The sets, the costumes are all great. However it is like a slow moving tableau rather than a film. The things which make films interesting are some plot, a bit of pace and maybee some issues which are interesting.
This film seems to go for at least three hours, maybee it goes for two. It is hard to work up any enthusiasm for the hero as he is such a groveller to the upper class. I mean other people did different things in the time it was set. They could enter politics, go to India or write small satyrical journals. Lyndon just slobs around and gets upset about his non acceptance.
The humour is also dreadful. As a service to humanity all existing copies of the DVD should be destroyed.",1011744000,6,1068,4.345
1214300,5,B00000FYPB,"I love this film because it is like watching several films at one time. There is the picaresque story of Barry Lyndon, full of love, duels, highway robbery, war, card sharping, and swindling the rich. But while Barry is busy being victim to roguery and then becoming one himself Kubrick also sets out to study society which in his view is completely corrupt from top to bottom. So there is a kind of comedy and tragedy going on simultaneously. Its brilliantly well blended. You find yourself laughing at Barrys antics one minute and then that famous Kubrick camera will pull back and show you the rest of the larger picture quite literally. It is about as unsentimental a potrait of society and human nature as exists on film. Perhaps Kubrick is saying that it is the society we are born into that does the corrupting or perhaps he is saying we are all by nature corrupt, you can make up you own mind. You will have plenty of time to decide(3+ hours) but you will not be bored. As costume epics go this one has plenty of adventure, from battlefield scenes to drawing room intrigue, and all takes place in a period detail rich atmosphere. Most period dramas feel like they over romanticize the epoch they are recreating this does just the opposite. Kubrick shows the literal dirt as well as the dirty underside of his characters. The music is perfect too, as it always is in Kubrick works. Schuberts Trio in E-flat has been used in other movies but I believe nowhere has it been used more appropriately, here it is the sound of life naturally and inevitably following its predetermined course.  A predictable course is the human course in this film because human nature is without fail drawn away from light and into dark deceit. Barry begins so innocently and in the beginning he is so easily duped but by the end he has learned that there are only two kinds of humans, those who deceive and those who are deceived. Not my world view but it does make for an intensely enjoyable few hours. One of those movies that are so good you want to compare the experience to reading but of course Kubrick says as much with the way he frames his shots as many novelists do with words. Great cinema.  Ryan Oneal doesn't seem the obvious choice for this role but its hard to think of someone who could have done it better. You can't help but like him because you believe he does what he does and becomes what he becomes because he just doesn't know any better. Ryan Oneal has that kind of untouched by the world innocence, and also a very good confused and hopelessly lost look. Both are crucial for the role. Each character actor, and there are many, is better than the last. And Marisa Berenson a very memorable beauty.",1007424000,2,2707,4.522448979591837
1214306,4,B00000FYPB,"I was curious to see ""Barry Lyndon"" because it was accorded a rare one-week run at Film Forum in Manhattan; I wasn't able to see it at that time, but I rented it soon after, in spite of the fact that I remember it's being something of a failure at the time of its initial release.
Well! I was quite blown away by the beautiful photography and sensitive handling of every scene in the first half of this film. It's everything the other reviewers have said of its remarkable evocation of bygone era. I was enthusiastic about it, and so were my fellows watching it with me, all the way up through the intermission period. Then, I put in the second half.
Although it is true that we always know Barry to be a rogue, I did not dislike him through that first half. However, his character deteriorated sharply in the second half, and I for one could not trace a logical evolution for this. Yes, I understand the IDEA that he let it go all to his head and became too much of an overreacher. But it seemed too much of an on off switch--first he was a nice rascal, then he was a mean one. So the second half seemed unmotivated for me, and I was sad to see that happen.
Be that as it may, I would certainly recommend anyone with an interest in period furniture, art, history, whatever to see ""Barry Lyndon"". It is a painting come to life, and I only wish I had been able to enjoy the second half as much as I had the first.",1006646400,,1412,4.175824175824176

Besides, it is a sensitive, excellently told, touching story....the rise and fall of Redmond Barry(-Lyndon). Ryan O'Neal has never been better, I wouldn't have dared to thought he could be so effective in a film role. Marisa Berenson, designer Elsa Schiapparelli's grandadughter and former model, is like a living-suffering vision, she looks stunning, and she's perfectly directed by the master Kubrick; her role requires almost nothing of dialogue, only the transmission of her emotions and feelings to the public without saying a word!! And really, she does an excellent job. The rest of the cast is very good. Although it may seem slow-paced to some viewers, the story never, never gets boring, because the film is so perfectly edited. I can't say enough about this film. All period films I've seen, really can't compare to this work of art.",1005868800,6,1212,5.126262626262626
1214308,3,B00000FYPB,"""Barry Lyndon"" is a handsomely-produced, stunningly photographed movie that ranks among Kubrick's best-looking films.  This film cost $11 million to make (a huge budget for a 1975 film), and you can see exactly how the money was spent.  Kubrick, a photagrapher himself, used natural lighting when shooting interiors, and you can see the attention to detail from the first frame to the last.  But while it may be Kubrick's most visually stunning film, it's also among his weakest.  Ryan O'Neil is miscast as Redmond Barry, the Irishman who manipulates his way from poverty to wealth during this 3 hour film.  His performance has a few bright spots but is otherwise blank in expression.  The rest of the supporting cast fares much better.  But don't let its flaws or its length discourage you.  While this film pales in comparison to his classics like ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Barry Lyndon"" has virtues of its own to make it watchable.

Of course, I'm biased because I love Kubrick's work, but anyone who enjoys great storytelling, fine performances and flawless direction will be more than amply fed with several viewings of ""Barry Lyndon"". Part of Kubrick's genius and the finely understated acting of Ryan O'Neal is how we feel sorry for Redmond at the start of the film, but loathe him by the end.

1214311,4,B00000FYPB,Stanley Kubricks's long picturesque saga of an Irish rogue in 18th Century Europe is certainly the most entertaining costume drama ever made. Each frame of the film is filled with visual splendor as meticulous as a classic painting. Panoramic battle scenes and richly detailed costume and set designs come alive as from an artist's palette. Ryan O'Neal's bogus Irish accent is easily forgiven as he seems merely a prop in the center of Kubrick's vision of European aristocracy in conflict with an Irishman's independence. The pistol dueling scenes are outstanding.,999820800,,564,5.277777777777778
1214312,3,B00000FYPB,"Firstly, I would like to say that I recognize Kubrick as a director with an amazing vision of how films should look, and he certainly portrays Redmond Barry's world with extreme beauty and an attention to detail never since achieved in any costume drama.
However, I must say that this is probably one of the most self-indulgent films I have ever seen. Kubrick films exude his unique style, however that is all there is to this film, Kubrick style. That is why I have given this film 3 stars. His talent for cinematography is unrivalled, and just for that this picture is worth three stars.
Films, however, need more than just a great score and cinematic artistry.  They also need interesting(not necessarily likebale) characters whom engage the audience.  I was at odds to find a character who earned my sympathy at all, even Barry's wife, whom is treated so abysmally by the protagonist, fails to gain any sympathy at all.
The character of Barry is unlikebale at best, and throughout the film, his success and rise into the upper echelons of society is given to the fact that he is full of energy and determination. However O'Neal exhibits such a minute range of emotions that his energy is just non-existent. It's as if Kubrick told O'Neal just to make sure he looked gormless for three hours in order to repulse the audience.
This film is watchable because of Kubrick's talent, and unfortunately that is not quite enough for a film to hold one's attention for three hours. The story is so deliberately paced that I would only recommend this film to Kubrick fans interested in viewing his ability to create the world of Redmond Barry, albeit a very dull one.",999734400,2,1660,4.720689655172414
1214313,5,B00000FYPB,"'Barry Lyndon' is that rare work of art, one which achieves what Walter Pater suggested all art aspired to: the condition of music.  Its thematic development is in counterpoint - the opening sequences announce the themes (fathers, duels, money/gambling, women, war etc.) that will be subjected to variations throughout.  The narrative movement is as hypnotic and static and abstract as its Baroque score.  The film is not just visual music, but a conflation of all the arts - cinema, literature, painting, pantomime, architecture etc. - creating one spellbinding Uber-artwork.
This is the ultimate Kubrick movie, the one where all his concerns coalesce and reach perfection - the rise and fall of a hubristic masculine hero; the conflict between a criminal outsider and a society that will legitimate criminality to defend itself; the need for the individual to wear masks to play society at its own game, and the profound loss of identity this entails; the farce of war; the tension between historical time, in which society and Great Events function, and a circular, Purgatorial time, where the hero is doomed to repeat his mistakes; the failure of the Enlightenment, the impossibility of change and the regression to tribalism and barbaric rituals; the possibility of salvation and redemption.
All Kubrick films are schizophrenic, sometimes to their detriment.  Here, he manages to pull off a film that is at once philosophically serious and an emotional and hilarious character study.  'Barry Lyndon' is also one of the few historical films that represents its world on its own cultural terms - the inertia, the tableaux, the pageantry are all true to the 18th century.
A final word of praise for Ryan O'Neal.  There is a mistaken belief that great acting consists in excesses of emotion and grotesque gestures.  Rather, it lies in formal subservience to a film's mise-en-scene.  O'Neal does this generously and brilliantly, and rewards Kubrick with one of the finest performances in the cinema, one that always has me blubbing like a big baby.",998438400,9,2048,5.147590361445783

This is a powerful film and easily the most beautiful as for costumes and scenery, but it wasn't his best.  This to me was great and meaningful but it doesn't really qualify of Kubrick films.  When I think of Kubrick I think of THE SHINING or A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  Not BARRY LYNDON.  Although I really liked this film, it doesn't have the Kubrick touch that DR. STRANGELOVE, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, THE SHINING, FULL METAL JACKET, EYES WIDE SHUT, or LOLITA brings to the screen.  Don't get me wrong, this was an excellent film, but very unlike Kubrick films. This in a way falls in the catagory of 1956's THE KILLING and 1960's Spartacus.  Those were both great films but they didn't feel like Kubrick.  But do see this movie!  I liked the first video better than the second (BARRY LYNDON had two tapes because it's a little over 3 hours).  But if you enjoy good cinema, rent or buy this!",996278400,2,961,4.434285714285714
1214325,2,B00000FYPB,"Ever so often one discovers a movie that, although not well known, has a credible pedigree and an enthusiastic fan base. Barry Lyndon is not one of those movies. And, unlike many of these hidden treasures that I have found throughout the years, BL was the diamond in the rough that I had hoped (and so many had said it was).
It is a VERY pretty movie. The sets, costumes, scenery, music, and horses are all breathtaking; if gazing at beautiful but inanimate objects is your idea of a good film, this is your Citizen Kane. I applaud the rigorous use of only period music and costumes for an authentic look, but superficial beauty cannot carry a film alone. The music, though, can stand by itself, and is more worth the price than the movie itself is. Revel in it...
I am sure that Kubrick was very aware of the awe-inspiring authenticity and prettiness of this picture, and unfortunately, this comes across very strongly. It seems that the idea was something along the lines of ""heck, even if the actors can't act, who cares? The audience will just be looking at the scenery anyway."" This leaves the driving force of the film, the actors, as merely icing on a frivolous cake.
A good actor can make even the most gratituous role into a stunner; Ryan O'Neal is not that kind of actor. When in the role of Redmond Barry, a cad and social climber, O'Neal is asked to be devious, calculating, and grief-stricken - all the audience sees is a face devoid of emotion. A vacant stare does not a thespian make. I feel that Kubrick cast O'Neal to attract viewers with his star power, much like Jean Jaques Annaud did with Brad Pitt in Seven Years in Tibet. It is a pity that such a great director failed to elict a competitive performance out of his star.
The rest of the cast aquits themselves very nicely, though, with the exception of the man who plays Barry's step-son, who overacts most egregiously.
The script. Ah, the fans and the critics are already queueing up, ready to give their opinions. Is it a deep psychological rendering of society and it's follies, or is it a tedious too-literal adaptation of a classic novel? I think it is a mish-mash of both, with the master of psychological movies fighting the bonds that come with adapting someone else's thoughts. My only large complaint is with the epilogue. The message of the movie itself seemed to be that one will get one's just desserts, but the epilogue's message is that it does not matter what one does in life, for all will be equal after death. These two ideas seem to conflict strongly - heightening my feeling that two minds were in opposition here - Thackeray and Kubrick.
The editing also leaves something to be desired. Yes, as was already stated, the views are pretty, but many of the scenes could have been drastically cut without damaging the movie or the aesthetic pleasure of viewing it. See especially the card game at the beginning, and the endless shots of Ryan O'Neal looking blankly into space.
All in all, this is a gorgeous movie with some very rousing battle scenes (albeit bloodless), but not much in the way of acting, drama, or substance.",995673600,10,3116,4.596050269299821
1214326,5,B00000FYPB,"When Barry Lyndon was released, it was roundly panned by most of the critics, who called it slow and tedious. Yet I found it to be elegant, almost poetic in its pacing. I found my attention so riveted to the screen that I barely noticed the passage of time.
For any fan of Kubrick, all the qualities that characterize his best films can be found in Barry Lydon. The characters are drawn with great precision, and portrayed vividly. Each image, each scene is painted in crystal clear detail. There are no wasted scenes, no throwaway shots, not a bit of wasted dialogue. Everything there is there for a purpose.

1214328,5,B00000FYPB,"Let us dispense with the phrase ""period piece"" that inevitably pops up in most reviews of Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"". If there is any common thread that runs through all Kubrick films, it is the essential timelessness of the human comedy, whether the protaganists are fighting sabretooth tigers, Romans, Napoleon, in WW 1, in the Cold War, in Vietnam, evil computers in outer space, or thier own sexual urges. ""Barry Lyndon"" just happens to peek in on the silly earthlings while they are struggling through the 18th century. Kubrick coaxes a career-best performance from Ryan O'Neal, who is perfectly appointed as the handsome, ""rougeish"" opportunist of the movie title. The film is peppered with memorable supporting performances and lorded over by a wonderfully droll  voiceover ""narrator"" (a Kubrick trademark!). The jaw-dropping, ""oil painting coming to life"" visuals alone are worth the price of admission. History buffs will probably observe that Kubrick's trademark use of classical music is ""era appropriate"" for once!

1214329,4,B00000FYPB,"I bought this DVD as part of the Stanley Kubrick Collection (from Amazon, no less).  The film would get five stars; the DVD quality 3, so this averages out to 4. Technically it is an undistinguished disc, excellent color fidelity offset by distracting digital noise.  The sound is no better.  Subjectively, it's like high-quality AM radio reception. As for the film itself...
Critics and fans often marvel at Stanley Kubrick's versatility - how he paradoxically made films of such diverse subject matter that all, nonetheless, bore his uniquely identifiable stamp.  No other director's films look or feel like his.  I think Kubrick was, in part, a detached experimenter.  As fans would wonder what a Stanley Kubrick costume drama would look like, so did he. Barry Lyndon is the answer.
Deeply pessimistic, Barry Lyndon is full of the usual Kubrick satire and sardonic wit.  This wit extended off screen to the casting of Ryan O'Neil (a much criticized choice then as now) in the title role.  But O'Neil had the right qualities - he seemed like a charming bad-boy with a soft, naive center. He also seemed to not quite fit among the fine European actors that surrounded him - as his character did not quite fit among the aristocracy to which he aspired. O'Neil was also bankable, which made it easier to secure financing after the shocking A Clockwork Orange (which was full of unknowns).
Often when the film seems to be straying into earnest mawkishness (Barry bursting into tears at the drop of a hat, his friend Grogan spouting clichs about virtue), it is really indulging in deadpan satire.  Just look a few minutes later for the droll punch line.
Like Hitchcock's similar manipulations in Psycho, Kubrick is setting us up.  Just when we are comfortable that we can let down our emotional guard, Barry's life takes its inevitable downturn.  Here Kubrick's immense skill as a film-maker becomes readily apparent as the same kind of material plays out with a shockingly different tone.  The 18th-century-costume-drama-isms that Kubrick had fun with earlier serve as the bars of Barry's opulent cage - and the genuinely tragic instruments of his fall from grace.  Barry Lyndon has gone from icily observant to emotionally shattering in just over three hours.
If you have the patience, it's a journey worth taking.  Barry Lyndon lingers in the mind for years.",975715200,8,2358,4.951776649746193

Obviously it isn't a film that will suit all tastes, and one which many will admire for Kubricks attention to detail rather than the enjoyment they may get from the story.  The highly interesting first half, which details Barry Lyndons experiences and encounters when travelling Europe, does make the second part (where he settles) seem slightly less interesting and disrupts the overall momentum a little but the cinematography is nevertheless perfect all the way through and is enough alone to maintain interest.  Ryan O'Neal is also extremely well cast and the music score is perfect, though the uneven picture quality on the disc doesn't do this gorgeous film justice at times.",974592000,2,821,4.934782608695652

I recommend buying the soundtrack album as a complement. In fact, the soundtrack is one of the finest instances of just how complementary a score makes a movie a MOVIE.  Ryan O'Neal has and never will be noted as a great actor, but he fits the part distinctly. As a reference, you should watch Kubrick's films ""The Killing"" or ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to see just how a director's influence over 2nd rate actors/actresses can make them shine.",973382400,,561,4.724489795918367
1214332,4,B00000FYPB,"The great Stanley Kubrick was a bit of a cinematic chameleon.  None of his films looked anything like the next one.  For the most part, they were all of different film genres and generally set a standard for that particular genre.  Barry Lyndon, then, is Stanley Kubrick's take on the historical costume genre.  Over the years, unfortunately, people have come to regard this film as lesser Kubrick, not up to par with 2001 or Dr. Strangelove.
 When I first saw Barry Lyndon in college, I must admit I thought the film was a little long and somewhat boring.  But something about the film nevertheless fascinated me.  A year back, I decided, on a whim, to purchase the Barry Lyndon DVD and re-watch this film.  I'm glad I did.
 Yes, Barry Lyndon is almost 3 hours long, and Kubrick's deliberate, methodical pacing will dearly try the patience of those of us weaned on fast MTV-style editing.  Yet, the film is glorious to watch.  The cinematography of the film is absolutely breath-taking.  In countless scene after scene, Kubrick has created images that, if paused on your DVD player, could easily pass for a period painting of the era.  The film is *that* beautiful.  And he created a special lens that was able to photograph in natural light and candle light - not a great feat nowadays but an astounding achievement 25 years ago when this film was created.  The film won a well-deserved Oscar for cinematography, as well as for costume design and art direction and musical scoring.  As far as the Academy Awards are concerned, this is probably Kubrick's most decorated film.
 The plot follows the rise and fall of one Redmond Barry and how he achieves great wealth and power only to lose it all by the end of the film.  Ryan O'Neil is Redmond Barry, and while some people may scoff at this casting choice, he does a decent job in the role.  Marisa Berenson, regarded in the 1970s as an international beauty, portrayed the Countess Lyndon whom Redmond Barry marries for wealth.
 There are numerous stand-out scenes in the film, thanks to Kubrick's perfectionist strive.  The gun-duels, especially the last one, are suspenseful and superbly filmed.  The battle scenes, while sterile and blood-less in comparison to recent films like The Patriot or Braveheart, are well-done.  And the romance scenes (in a Kubrick film? But yes!) are sweet or amusing or lustful, depending on Kubrick's intentions.  The great thing about a DVD is that it allows you to watch your favorite scene over and over again, and Barry Lyndon is a film filled with scenes that can be appreciated in such a fashion.
 Now...a word about the Warner Brothers DVD.  Warner Brothers has gotten a lot of grief about the haste with which they produced these Kubrick DVDs in the wake of the director's death.  Most are bare-bones and don't have the best transfers, to be polite.  Such is the case with the Barry Lyndon DVD.  The DVD includes only from production notes, a trailer, subtitles, and a list of awards.  That's about it.  And the image quality, while certainly better than VHS, is not as good as it could have been.  In other words, Warner Brothers transfered a decent print but made NO effort to restore it.  The DVD still looks good, but it could have looked a LOT better, too.  The sound is monophonic, as Kubrick usually preferred, so that's what you get on the DVD.  Still, I think Warner Brothers could have put in some effort, like was done with the restoration for Vertigo DVD for example, and produced a really high quality DVD.  Kubrick is one of our greatest directors; he deserved better treatment.
 Anyways, so the film is great, but the DVD is so-so.  At least it's a budget DVD.  If you enjoy this film, you may either purchase it cheaply now....or wait indefinitely until Warner Brothers decides to produce a special edition of Barry Lyndon in the inconceivable future.",970704000,14,3859,4.737237237237237
1214333,5,B00000FYPB,"Some people may complain about the slower pacing of ""Barry Lyndon"". They are missing the point : this film is not about moving from plot point A to plot point B in the most efficient way possible - you want that, go see a Ron Bass movie.
""Barry Lyndon"", unlike many movies which trip all over themselves to twist the audiences expectations, does take it's time; but it is for the journey that we must embark. Every character, every set, every line of dialogue, every frame has been touched by a craftman unequaled in his lifetime. From the highly detailed production design to the flowery, and at times, comical dialogue Kubrick has created a true vision of life in aristocratic Europe.
But instead of celebrating the chivalry and heroism of the period Kubrick peels away the layers of legend to reveal the true nature of kings and generals. He satirically castigating royalty and soldiers alike as petty and decadant rogues, who pay lip service to honor while stealing all they can to support their lifestyle (or ""the manner with which they'd become accustomed""). And Barry, being from humble roots, is all too eager to play the game in exchange for a place at the table.
The film is both a literary and visual masterpiece. The former is likely due to the abilities of W.M. Thacker who wrote the book upon which the movie was based. Only a novel could be so rich in detail while mantaining it's overall theme. The latter, is all Kubrick - always a visual genius, the man invented a new lens system so he could film the whole thing with natural light. Amazing. At certain points in the movie, you will be wondering if that river or meadow in the background is a matte painting or if, in fact, a place that scenic does indeed exist.
I've seen the movie three or four times, I watch key scenes over and over again. To me, it's one of the funniest movies ever made. The fact that Kubrick made it also makes it one of the best.",970531200,4,1923,4.512893982808023
1214344,5,B00000FYPB,"I recall seeing Barry Lyndon when it was first released, and having very mixed emotions about it. Visually stunning - an expected strength of a  Kubrick film which even the most unsymapthetic viewer couldn't deny - it  struck me that one could not have full sympathy for any character in the  story, even the protagonist.
What I missed originally, and later  appreciated (I've watched the film many times now), is that this is in fact  the point.  Kubrick was impeccably honest in protraying the full spectrum  of the civilized corruption of an age of remarkable contradictions.  The  manners and civility counterpointed by betrayals, base motives, and  brutality. The seemingly gleaming and disciplined armies of the Age of  Enlightenment, concealing a rotten system and a mindlessly sacrificial way  of waging war.
Kubrick carefully, meticululously crafts this age, and  conveys it to the viewer in a way which makes one feel that a series of  beautiful 18th century paintings have been brought to life, revealing the  entire story, only hinted at through static art.  Assisting this is the  voice-over of some of the Thackeray narrative, which is particularly  effective at completing and fleshing out selected scenes. It's the  resulting fullness and honest balance of the story which unnerves at first,  but rewards when less casually considered.
To make this all happen, the  film is necessarily long, but without a wasted moment.  Don't rent or buy  this one if you're looking for fluff.  And give it another chance if you're  not convinced at first.  It is a film masterpiece of the first order.",966384000,3,1603,5.069230769230769
1214345,5,B00000FYPB,"Stanley Kubrick did an excellent job recreating the 1700's in style, costume and scenery.  Ryan O'Neal portrays a rogue excellently and he is  captivating in the role of Barry Lyndon who is a dashing and charming ""gentleman of distinction"".  The movie starts when Lyndon is  exiled from his home and made to join the British Army, there Lyndon's life  story takes various twists and turns.  O'Neal and the rest of the cast make  this an entertaining movie to watch. Another great movie by the late Stanley Kubrick.  The cinematography is outstanding.  A critic described the unique locations and lighting, and overall photography of the movie as high renaissance art on film.  I definitely agree.

But later on it began to grow on me.  I've watched it  five times now and I love this film more than ever.  The magestic beauty of  every single shot in the film ranks with Remington masterpieces.  The  authenticity, pacing and brilliant arangement of score create an auditory  and visual symphony perfecty coreographed to draw in a careful veiwer.  Kubrick always keeps his story the first priority however.  Thackery wrote  Lyndon as an adventure.  But Kubrick moderizes the theme to display the  absolute decadedence of an era.

1214347,4,B00000FYPB,"This is a very unusual film for me to write about. I'm not really sure about my feelings for this film. When I watch a movie I like to be able to identify with the characters within the film. I like to be able to  understand what they are going through,to be able to feel their happiness  and sadness as well. This is one of the many things that movies are capable  of being able to do. To have the viewer actually feel for the characters  involved. But this film didn't seem to do that. You never really get to  know the characters,not even the title character. Instead of feeling as if  we are actually ""with"" the characters,the viewer feels like he's  an outside person looking in. We can't identify with anyone. Now,does this  mean the movie is bad? I think not. Even though we can't feel for the  characters,I found the movie to be intriguing. As your watching the  film,you just know that your watching ""art"". The wonderful sets  and costumes really grab your attention. O'Neal's acting doesn't hurt the  film either. I do have a problem with Kubrick's screenplay. As I said,I  only wish he would of went more inside the characters. As for his  directing,well there's a reason he's seen as one of the best,he clearly WAS  one of the best. This film should be viewed if only for the sets and  costumes,O'Neal's performance,and Kubrick's masterful directing. This is a  movie you can appreciate even if you don't enjoy it.

I  found it extremely distracting to hear familiar music coming out of my  high-end speakers sounding so dead. Otherwise...The most beautiful woman  I've ever, ever seen is Marisa Berenson in this movie, and the clarity of  the DVD presents the visual beauty of this film better than ever.",959299200,,583,4.969072164948454

And the only thing that came across my mind was the music, the Haendel suite accompanying the english soldiers while  marching against the french army.
No need for me to glorify once again  the sumptuous images nor Kubrick's meticulosity in the recreation of the  european XVIIIth century. Other customers have done it a lot better than I  ever could. What I would like to point out here is the extreme accuracy of  BARRY LYNDON's musical score. Just think that Stanley Kubrick, during the  first scene involving Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson, around a game table,  has given us one of the first video-clips ever filmed. The images fit so  well with the Franz Schubert's trio that one is led to believe that Kubrick  wanted to illustrate here a piece of music he liked and that what we see on  the screen was inspired by Schubert's music. And not the contrary.

1214351,4,B00000FYPB,"Kubrick dares to risk pretension here by taking the obscure Thackeray novel at face value.  Eschewing a modern sensibility which almost always mars period movies  (the very recent  ""Mansfield Park"", with its  wacky feminist sensibilities, comes glaringly to mind), the director makes  the people in this world move like the marionettes we always imagined them  to be.  They stand like portraits of themselves; they glide across rooms  beautifully.  The score behind these painted dolls consists of the archest  classical composers, i.e., Handel and Bach, along with others slightly less  arch.  Further, most of the movie looks like a Gainsborough or a Watteau  landscape.  And in case that's not enough high-art for you, Kubrick uses a  narrator  (a great old Shakespearean actor named Michael Hordern)  who, for  all we know, IS Thackeray himself -- he certainly sounds archly Victorian  enough.
Perhaps only Kubrick was egomaniacal enough to attempt all this.  The movie has moments of intense beauty, and you have to admire Kubrick's  determination in realizing those moments.  On the other hand, what works is  also what occasionally hampers the movie:  the scenic composition can get  too static  (to say nothing of the dialog!).  One ends up wishing that  Kubrick wasn't so convinced that his film was so lovely.
The only actor  Kubrick apparently respected was Peter Sellers, which is a roundabout way  of saying that it hardly matters which actor portrays the titular hero of  this movie.  Ryan O'Neal suffices.  In fact, his bland good looks and  roughneck frame suit the character perfectly, which is undoubtedly why  Kubrick cast him in the role.  (O'Neal was also a star in 1975 -- indeed,  he was 1975's Matthew McConaughey.)  Not a Method Actor, he simply speaks  the lines and looks handsome, which is all that's required.  If you imagine  De Niro in this role, you'll soon agree with me, I think, that O'Neal is  great casting.
All in all, a  (mostly)  absorbing rise-and-fall story,  executed with much more attention to detail than you're probably accustomed  to.  I recommend it.",955324800,4,2099,5.091988130563799
1214352,5,B00000FYPB,"Visually stunning, deliberately paced story of a man who, despite his rise to riches and success,  finds himself rejected by the highest strata of society.  I suspect Kubrick was attracted to the story because of the  parallels to his own life.  Redmond Barry's story is much Kubrick's story.  After a initially brutal slap by the real world, the formally idealistic  young man becomes cynical and self serving, turning briefly to his own  tribe so far as he is 'helped' by them, but quickly rejecting them as soon  as becomes feasible to do so.  Taking a trophy wife from what he perceives  as the superior ruling class, he seeks acceptance in it, but soon realizes  the hopelessness of his ambition, and instead settles willingly to the  terms life offers.  He maintains his individual sense of honor in the face  of brutal bigotry and hollow hypocrisy, suspecting in himself a justified  self-worth, but always and forever doubting, seeing that his natural  tendencies are, in the end, inescapable.  The sets, costumes and cast are  excellent, but the real star is the film itself.  The film is long, but not  over long.  The viewer should give himself the time to absorb it; not only  does the film richly deserve it, but the viewer will be richly rewarded.",955324800,,1261,4.821596244131455

It has astark realism from the period; the actors did not use costumes, butactual antique clothes and Kubrick did not use any lighting other than natural light. Gorgeous cinematography captures the beauty of the English landscapes, beautiful sets and a nice score and screenplay (by Kubrick). The story follows the adventures of an Irish rogue who is prepared to do anything to build his way up in life. Kubricks' film seems like a painting; Kubrick found inspiration in the era's painters.  While long it is never boring and the actors shine, but the genius behind it is Kubrick. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!",953769600,3,676,4.680672268907563
1214355,5,B00000FYPB,"Arguably the least accessible of Kubrick's major releases, this film still remains the single greatest example of his recurring themes, ideas, and overall style. In addition to the revolutionary (and still, 25 years later,  never surpassed) use of camera and lighting, Kubrick reinvents a genre  often bloated with inaccuracy. Because he insists on a deliberate pace and  stifled emotions, Kubrick captures the lifestyle of the 18th century better  than any previous filmmaker. In other words, this is a film literally  taking place in a specific era rather than remaining a typically modern  interpretation of past events. And the story itself? A deceptively simple  tale of an opportunistic cad who seeks (and loses) fortune and distinction.  Yet, Kubrick is after much more here. As he examines dehumanization and the  ritualization of human behavior, he subverts the genre by presenting  unattractive, aloof, self-serving characters, most prominently in the lead  role. Using narration, he mocks the ambitions of his characters, revealing  information that would remain hidden if not for the omniscient voice. There  is little doubt that the film is slow, but the glacial pace allows for  contemplation and involvement in ways few films do. Underrated,  underappreciated, and ripe for revisiting.",953251200,5,1300,5.494949494949495
1214356,5,B00000FYPB,"I noticed that one reviewer felt Barry Lyndon was unsuccessful as a film because he thought Kubrick should have chosen a more regal personna for the lead character. He felt Napolean would have made a better subject for the  drama! This is ludicrous, it goes against both the intention of the film  and of Kubrick himself. The very drama that makes the film interesting--  and compelling-- is based upon the concept of a humble and not-too- worldly  Irishman who rises to extraodinary heights by taking advantage of a series  of unusual  circumstances that place themselves before him.  In turn, his  eventual fall from grace provides the film with the kind of intense emotion  that transcends his humble origins. Replacing Barry Lyndon with Napolean or  any other historical figure would not in itself make Barry Lyndon a better  film, I believe the fim's success lies in the extraordinary events that  take place in a rather ordinary man's life. With the superb camera work,  marvelous period settings, breathtaking scenery and costumes, and music of  the period, the viewer is transfixed, given a glimpse into the excesses of  the 18th century in a way that no film since has been able to do.

Thankfully, my  fears were unfounded. While the 3 hour running time is staggering when  read, I was pleased by how smoothly and swiftly the time passed while  watching the film. It felt like Tape 1 was done in 5 minutes.

(The  fact that Mr. O'Neal was willing to turn in such an innocuous performance  at the pinnacle of his career speaks volumes for the star's  character.)
As with all of Kubrick's films, don't expect entertainment.  This is art.  That is why it gets such wildly mixed reviews. Where most of  today's filmed  entertainment is the cinematic equivalent of rock-n-roll,  Kubrick's films  are mostly waltzes.

As the film  turns though, we are left with less adventure and more humanity.  True  sadness and an unpleasant ending for a character you never really get to  like.

7908559,5,B00000FYPB,"Stanley Kubrick never made a more perfect movie than Barry Lyndon (1975), possibly the most audacious work in the history of American film. Thats a mighty claim and I hope my review here will back it up, particularly as unlike films such as Murnaus Sunrise (1927) and Welles Citizen Kane (1941) the film has never received universal acclaim from either critics or the general public. Many notable critics have craftily snuck the film onto their Best Of lists within the last decade, but the truth is nobody knew what to make of Barry Lyndon when it was first released, particularly in America. After hitting on social concerns so cannily in his previous 4 films (sexual liberation in Lolita [1960]; the fear of nuclear holocaust in Dr. Strangelove [1964]; the Cold War space race in 2001: A Space Odyssey [1968]; and the rise of inner city youth violence in A Clockwork Orange [1971]) in a way that cast Kubrick as some kind of seer with a hotwire to the cortex of the 20th century human condition, he made an 18th century costume drama which nobody wanted to see based on a Thackeray novel virtually nobody had read (The Luck of Barry Lyndon [1844]). Moreover, contrary to the hyper-kinetic entertaining style seen in A Clockwork Orange Kubrick adopted a cinematic approach which defied the very way American films were supposed to be made. Long, slow, devoid of narrative complexity, empty of character psychology, unremittingly sad and irredeemably riddled with both misogyny and misanthropy, people just didn't know how to respond to it. What has become apparent over time though is that these criticisms can be levelled at any Kubrick film (I except Spartacus [1960] because Kubrick did). The difference is that while the other films had been similarly dismal and negative, Kubrick had always been careful to code his darkness behind a very attractive commercial surface. Dr. Strangelove was about nuclear apocalypse but presented as a knock-about anarchic farce, 2001 is a hefty metaphysical investigation into the nature of Man cast as a Boys Own acid trip to Jupiter and into the infinite and A Clockwork Orange is a despairing unveiling of the clockwork nature of western civilization cast as an exploitative romp full of fashionable sex and violence. In Barry Lyndon Kubrick offers no commercial attractions at all. Everyone admired the beauty of John Alcotts cinematography, but instead of inspiring warmth and love the painterly compositions convey icy coldness and an overwhelming sadness. It is Kubrick pure and undiluted, a film of radical intelligence which most perfectly puts across his fundamentally despicable worldview  that man sets about constructing mechanisms through which he thinks he can control the world, but which end up controlling him. As the central text is historical Kubrick could show one complete dismal cycle, one complete world (the world of 18th century European high society) whose destruction lies in the very method and nature of its creation. As the narrator (Michael Hordern) says early in Part 2 about Barry (Ryan ONeal), The very qualities that led to his success led to his eventual destruction. Kubrick very probably knew what he was doing. He no doubt realized his film wouldnt be popular and calculated that this was the time when he could cash in on the reliable commercial reputation earned in his previous 3 blockbusters and at last make something from the heart without having to qualify it by pandering to commercial necessity. He had originally wanted to make a film on Napoleon and then considered Vanity Fair, but settled on The Luck of Barry Lyndon as less of a financial hazard than either. It is revealing that the films lack of commercial success was one of the main reasons for Kubricks return back to coding his misanthropy behind a commercial screen in his next film  the horror of The Shining. Dr. Strangelove, 2001 and The Shining are all masterpieces to be sure, but they don't have the artistic purity of Barry Lyndon which I think can only be seen in one other Kubrick film  Paths of Glory, a film which relates to it not least by being set mainly in an 18th century French chateau.

All Kubrick films have strong narrative structures and Barry Lyndon has the simplest and most effective in terms of providing a framework for him to get across what he wants to say. He uses Thackerays picaresque structure to provide the narrative events which are strung together by an off-screen narrator rather than related in the first person as had been the case in Lolita and A Clockwork Orange. Kubrick uses a narrator in all his films except for 2001, The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut, and in the first two the narrator is replaced by inter-title chapter headings. In Barry Lyndon there are 3 chapter headings to denote the two parts and the epilogue. The films rise and fall narrative is spelt out simply, Part 1 titled By What Means Redmond Barry Acquired the Style and Title of Barry Lyndon, and Part 2 titled, Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon with the epilogue simply an epitaph: It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarreled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now. The narrator is often unreliable and comes from outside the film, commenting ironically on events and often giving information which we don't see and at first doesnt seem at all relevant. This is one of Kubricks distancing devices which operates to keep us away from characters and events, casting us as uninvolved spectators. Its this distancing that most confounded people on the films first release. This almost Brechtian disposition was the province of the European art film and had no place in American commercial cinema. Id argue that the distancing deployed on every level (narrative construction, acting, cinematography, editing, music) is precisely what makes Barry Lyndon so audacious, Kubrick crafting something that was utterly unique in its context with consummate skill.

We notice both parts are scrupulously balanced with formal regard for symmetry. Part I begins and ends with death, Barrys fathers demise in a duel over the purchase of some horses and Lord Lyndons death which paves the way for Barry to marry Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) and reach his social zenith. The tone of Part 1 is jocular as we follow Barrys initial ruin at the hands of his cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton) whose family conspire to get rid of him by faking a duel in which an English army Captain named Quin (Leonard Rossiter) fakes his own death so that he can marry Nora and bring 1,500 a year into the family. Barrys wandering takes him first to Captain Feeney (Arthur OSullivan), a highway robber who takes everything from him forcing him into joining the English army to fight in the Seven Years War where he loses his first and only friend Captain Grogan (Godfrey Quigley) in battle before deserting. After a brief romantic interlude with a German farm girl named Lischen (Diana Krner) he is arrested and abducted into the Prussian army by Captain Potzdorf (Hardy Krger) whose life he saves in battle and whose friendship results in him being sent to work as a spy in Berlin to work for an imposter/libertine, the Chevalier du Balibari (Patrick Magee). Changing horses to side with his own fellow Irishman, the pair conspire to have themselves deported from Prussia and pursue lives as professional gamblers in the highest courts of Europe. This is where Barry first meets Lady Lyndon whom he begins courting under the eyes of her crippled soon to die husband Lord Lyndon (Frank Middlemass). His death would appear to ensure Barrys fortune is made as the narrator reads his obituary.

Part 2 begins and ends with dates. In 1773 Barry marries Lady Lyndon, takes up the name Barry Lyndon and lives for a decade in the lap of luxury. In 1789 (the year of the French Revolution of course) Lady Lyndon signs an annuity check of 500 guineas, the amount Barry (now disgraced and returned to plain Redmond Barry) has agreed to receive on condition he never return to England. Part 2 also begins and ends in church, in 1773 Barry marries Lady Lyndon and in a date not specified Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) shoots Barry in a duel which takes place in an abandoned church, an event which signals the end of Barrys prosperity. The tone of Part 2 is as sad as Part 1 is jocular as we follow Barrys marriage and the birth of their son Brian. We also follow Barrys continuing infidelities, his overspending and the growing contempt held toward him by Bullingdon, the heir to the family estate and fortune. Barrys scheming mother (Marie Kean) makes clear Barry has no money at all without Lady Lyndons signature and once she dies he will be at the mercy of Bullingdon. He therefore determines to win a peerage through buying friendships with Lords Hallam (Anthony Sharp) and Wendover (Andr Morell) and supplying bribes in other high places. The inevitable happens when Bullingdon causes a scene in front of high society which causes Barry to attack him and then to fall out of favor with all his rich friends. Bullingdons self-exile is followed by the death of Brian, the depression of Lady Lyndon and the return of Bullingdon to claim his title, protect his mother and expel Barry by way of beating him in a duel.

This cascade of narrative events should make for a rollicking picaresque yarn in the manner of Tom Jones (1963), but there is nothing rollicking in Kubricks beady-eyed analytical examination of a corrupt and corrupting 18th century society which he reveals as a human construct of monstrously self-destructive intent for everyone enclosed in it. It will be noted that Barrys humanism (his good qualities) lies at the base of his undoing and as his early navet leads him astray from the beginning (his love for Nora leading to him throwing wine in Quins face), his later sentimental indulging of his son Brian seals his fate. The final duel is notable for Barry waiving his right to fire on the cowardly Bullingdon, but being shot and losing his leg in any case. Throughout the film Kubrick makes it clear that money (not love) lies at the base of human discourse for the society which he presents with no room for the kind of nave sentimentality we see shared by Barry with Colonel Dax (in Paths of Glory). Money is the reason Barry is sent from his home, money is the reason why he is robbed, why he joins the army, why he deserts, why he ingratiates himself with Potzdorf, betrays him in favor of the Chevalier and eventually marries Lady Lyndon. Barry starts Part 1 a nave romantic, but ends it a hardened cynic who has learned from bitter experience what it takes to rise in a society which prizes murky values of self-preservation above clean honorable living. Once at the peak he continues the cynicism but is softened again by love for his son and a failure to realize that his pushy upward mobility doesnt wash with the society he tries at all costs to enter. His big mistake is not minding Bullingdon, especially by ignoring the boys mother and like many a brash nouveau riche millionaire his lack of class bars him from real acceptance into the social elite. The best he can do is squander a family fortune which isn't his and the way the Lyndon family is diminished is symptomatic of a whole class about to be dethroned in the century to come after the French Revolution (surely the reason why the date is quoted at the end). This point is made clear if we focus on the sad fate of Lady Lyndon. When Barry first sees her we hear the slow movement of Schuberts Piano Trio No. 2 which continues through his courtship of her (6 hours after they met her ladyship was in love, intones the narrator drily). Then at the end of Part 2 as she signs Barrys check we hear the music again and indeed the music concludes the film. In between the ruin of a Lady represents the ruin of a whole class as she is frozen out by Barry, suffers humiliation at him carrying on with her servants before effecting a reconciliation which reignites their love and a moral awakening for Barry. She struggles to control her older son as they dote on Brian and after Brians death she is reduced to a vaporish shell of a woman clinging on to religion out of desperation. Her only function is to sign checks to pay off debts. Like Barry, she is chewed up and spat out by society and is finally insulted by her son taking over her affairs and enforcing the separation from her husband who we assume she still loves. The mechanics of society which she cannot control demands she sacrifice everything for her spineless mollicoddled son who we see is equally trapped. Social coercion forces him into having to defend his family honor at the last minute when his mother almost kills herself, but even then he makes a pathetic sight throwing up as he faces Barry in the fuel and firing before the count of 3 is up. In this society according to Kubrick everyone is trapped into performing roles determined by a deadly mechanism of their own creation.

Kubrick presents this deadly mechanism by dwelling at length on the ritual activities which power it. He explores four rituals in particular  dueling, wooing, card-playing and debt-paying. The film incorporates 5 duels, the opening shooting contest in which Barrys father dies, the duel between Barry and Quin which Barry wins but later finds to have been rigged, the sword fight duel between Barry and Lord Ludd (Steven Berkoff) over an outstanding gambling debt, the play-sword fight duel between Barry and his son Brian and the final 9 minute shooting duel between Barry and Bullingdon which Barry loses. In addition there is a fistfight between Barry and a soldier named Tool (a formal square) and a battle scene which has English soldiers advancing on French lines to a ritualistic slaughter. Whenever there are confrontations between characters the meanness of the deed is off-set by ritualistic overly polite language  Feeneys polite robbing of Barry; Potzdorfs polite unmasking of Barrys desertion; the Prince of Tbingens polite refusal to pay a debt leading to the Chevaliers polite deportation; and Barrys mothers polite dismissal of Reverend Runt (Murray Melvin) which echoes Captain Feeneys genteel nastiness at the opposite end of the narrative. Kubrick delights in gentlemanly words masking base if not murderous intentions. Wooing rituals are kept to Part 1 (Barry/Nora, Nora/Quin, Barry/Lischen, Barry/Lady Lyndon) while card playing is present throughout. Barry playing with Nora in the films third scene is balanced by Barry playing with his mother in the films third from last scene. The activity is presented as the central ritual which binds all members of European high society together in the grand game of life, especially in the scenes involving Barry and the Chevalier fleecing various royals by carefully rehearsed cheating. Card playing is combined with wooing in the scene where Barry attracts Lady Lyndon and forms the frozen background for the scene where Bullingdon challenges Barry to his final duel. Debt-paying is mentioned by name from the beginning, especially with Quin agreeing to pay off Noras family debts and then Barrys debt recovery effected through dueling, and in Part 2 debt-paying becomes an omnipresent ritual as the accounts table is set up in Castle Hackton and the family (in various combinations involving Graham [Philip Stone], Lady Lyndon, sometimes Reverend Runt, Barry or Barrys mother) sign endless checks and money orders on it. These scenes give a hard shape to the ruining of a family fortune and emphasize more than anything money as being the most important motivator of social discourse. Lady Lyndons marriage begins by meeting Barry over the gaming table, but finishes with paying him off in absentia over the accounts table.

These rituals take up substantial space in the films running time, space which in a normal commercial costume drama would be devoted to character psychology. But Kubrick isn't interested in his characters other than their role in the social mechanism which he is so focused on depicting. The rituals are ritualized even further by Kubricks stunning visual treatment which displays them as the very means by which society moves. He deploys a series of lengthy extraordinarily detailed slow reverse zooms which function to isolate the drama of a given scene, but then to suck away any means of connecting with characters by emphasizing the social context of which they are a part. Kubrick plays with audience expectation. The spectator expects to get to know the characters, to empathize or sympathize with them, but he is frustrated as Kubrick repeatedly, rhythmically, ritualistically distances us to a contemplation of a society in motion in which characters are a part, but in which they are also trapped and denied individuality. The duel between Barry and Quin for example starts on a close-up of the pistols being prepared but slowly zooms out to place the pistols in the hands of people who are in turn framed by trees and the river which runs behind. Kubrick shows Quin wooing Nora close-up but zooms out to place them on a hillside with other people in a charming balanced portrait of nature. The intent is constantly to present the action in painterly compositions (the film is heavily indebted to Thomas Gainsborough, John Constable, William Hogarth and Adolf Menzel among others) which are outstandingly beautiful to look at, but cold as ice in that any audience identification with characters is withheld. Character psychology as normally understood in Hollywood films is discarded. We are forced time and again in a regular rhythm to regard the action whilst being denied the usual way we would interact with the film. The spectator is forced simply to observe 18th century society and the rituals which define it with characters forever entrapped within a suffocating beauty which prevents them from having a life of their own. This is an excellent way of showing Barrys passion running contrary to the strict rituals which surround him which he has to master to advance. The way that he learns how to fit into these rituals is shown by the way Kubrick deploys candle-lit interior shots which function in a similar way to the numerous reverse zooms in that they at first promise hot blooded drama, but eventually incarcerate characters within rituals which remove their humanity and turn them into mere cogs in a social machine. Early on in encounters between Barry and Grogan in the tent, between Barry and Lischen in her house and then much later in a brief intimate bedside encounter between Barry, his mother and Brian the candlelight pours human warmth over everything and presents characters as sympathetic human beings, but in central scenes of the film where whole halls and groups of people are candlelit, the eerie softness casts a spectral light as if the figures are all dead, an effect exaggerated by their invariably garish make-up. The gambling sessions are made into ghoulish games devoid of life. Barry first meets Lady Lyndon in such a hall and his skill in wooing her over cards and then outside as he follows her illustrates that Barry has mastered the art of advancing in this society by containing his youthful ardor within the prescribed strict mastery of rituals. By the end of Part 1 Barry has mastered 3 of these rituals. Hes adept at dueling, good with the cards and with Lady Lyndon proves himself a peerless wooer. The only ritual he is not master of is debt-paying and that will be his downfall in Part 2, a downfall marked most of all by a series of slow reverse zooms showing Barry in all his opulence at Castle Hackton, only for the camera to pull back and show him trapped in make believe for he has not a penny to his name and is merely awaiting Bullingdons return to claim what is rightfully his.

Kubricks emphasis on the depiction of rituals at great length leads to a soundtrack which is almost wholly void of normal conversation, something that we only hear in snatches between Barry and Grogan, Barry and Lischen and later Barry and Brian. Notably Barry and Lady Lyndon never have a conversation. The most personal they get is when Barry blows smoke in her face and then when he apologizes for his infidelities as she lies in her bath. The most dominant voice in the film is the narrator whose constant ironic comments on society and Barrys progress within it usually contradict what we see with our eyes. Most of the dialogue is less conversation and more speeches made on special occasions to accompany social rituals, especially dueling, wooing, engagement announcing, award receiving, army recruiting, a wedding, a birthday magic show and grand announcements following or interrupting a ritual like concert attending, especially Bullingdon insulting Barry and his mother in front of high society before his departure. On almost all occasions conversation is formalized to fit whatever social ritual is being enacted. The one exception (and the only time Kubrick allows real human emotion to really burst open) is the scene of Brians death and the funeral that follows, the deathbed scene in particular with both parents breaking down into tears possibly the most sentimental thing Kubrick ever shot, but it achieves its power precisely through being so exceptional.

An important element conveying the power of Brians death is the use of music which we recognize as the same ritualistic dirge-like Handel sarabande (orchestrated Romantically from the Keyboard Suite in D minor, HWV 437) that we first heard after the credits accompanying Barrys duel with Quin and which we hear play at great length through the climactic duel between Barry and Bullingdon. With ritualistic speech and a verbose unreliable narrator replacing natural dialogue, music becomes an important element of Kubricks total conception and he uses it to highlight the rituals just as he uses the cinematography to do the same. Brians deathbed scene is the most human scene in the whole film (in the whole Kubrick uvre!), yet the sarabande playing softly throughout emphasizes that even this is a ritual to match the funeral procession where we hear the same music played in the fortissimo register. Elsewhere we notice charming folk airs like Women of Ireland, Lilliburlero and British Grenadiers backing the wooing scenes between Barry and Nora, Quin and Nora and then Barry and Lischen, the first two shot as slow reverse zooms. And we notice the formality of concertos by Bach and Vivaldi in concert settings at Castle Hackton as well as the military formality of pieces like Mozarts march from Idomeneo (for the Berlin sequences) and Frederick the Greats Hohenfriedberger March used ironically to accompany Barrys desertion as he rides through Prussian lines. Along with the Handel though, the music that most stays with us is the Schubert piano trio which accompanies Barrys elaborate year-long courtship of Lady Lyndon. The andante has a beauty and yet other-worldly ceremonial sadness which makes it perfect to counterpoint Barrys cynical wooing with the Ladys vulnerable acquiescence. It also superbly bookends their relationship as she signs Barrys check in the final scene in a way which links the twin rituals of wooing and debt-paying as two sides of the same coin.

So what do we make of Kubricks monomaniacal determination to distance us from his film, to deny us from interacting with the text in the usual Hollywood way? The short answer to that is that Kubrick puts us in exactly the same situation as Barry. We yearn to enter the beautiful world lovingly put in front of us, but we are denied, distanced, rendered a spectator just as Barry is also denied, distanced and eventually ruined. The method of this distancing is the nature of society itself which Kubrick echoes in the nature of the method with which he presents it. We understand Kubricks film when we identify with Barrys frustration, his unfulfilled emotional longing to enter high society on his own merit. Kubrick denies the audience complete emotional entry and so makes us understand Barry and the social mechanism that denies him. We are pushed away from an emotional understanding of the film (as per the Hollywood tradition) towards an intellectual one in a manner which is indeed close to Brecht. Instead of another Tom Jones Kubrick gives us something much closer to Alain Resnais Last Year in Marienbad (1960). For an American audience this perception was audacious.

The long answer lies in Kubrick at last utilizing the chance to state on screen clearly and unequivocably his idea of Man being defeated by mechanisms of his own making (the very society he constructs). In Barry Lyndon that mechanism is the 18th century European class system which reduces human behavior down to mechanical rituals structured around the pursuit/retention of money and power. Old money stays in the hands of established families like the Lyndons, the Hallams or the Wendovers, but the rot has set in with the French Revolution due to change the face of a whole civilization. Pretenders like Barry are agents of destruction set to ruin family fortunes, but are also doomed to forever being left outside (and crushed by) the highest society into which they aspire to enter. In other words, part of the system or aspirant to the system, the system is set to collapse and crush everyone associated with it. Kubricks basic conception is misanthropic and can be applied to all his films, but in Barry Lyndon he is dealing with history and the knowledge that everything changed in 1789. He is thus able to close his film on a downer, present his main character as completely ruined and the society he aspires to enter in terminal decline, all of which without having to construct an attractive commercial surface to sweeten the overwhelming sourness.

Finally, Barry Lyndon is very interesting for bringing to a climax Kubricks fascination with the 18th century and clarifying what exactly this has meant in his uvre. Just to recap, most of Paths of Glory is set in an 18th century French chateau with numerous period works of art on show. Then theres Quiltys classical mansion and Humbert shooting him through a Gainsborough portrait in Lolita. Both Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange are heavily indebted to Jonathan Swifts 18th century notion of satire with the latter film featuring 18th century images (a painting in the derelict casino and a tapestry in Alexanders house) which offset violence. 2001s Jupiter Room is a deliberate parody of the chateau setting in Paths of Glory and both are tied into Barry Lyndon in the sequence where Barry is introduced to the Chevalier in a huge room echoing both as the Chevalier sits eating at a table, back to the camera in the manner of Bowman. Watching these 18th century references we may be tempted to read them as an ironic comment, the innocence of a bygone age contrasting with the violence of the 20th century. Barry Lyndons presentation of the 18th century society as a deadly mechanism for those trapped in it makes it clear that for Kubrick the era doesnt serve as ironic counterpoint at all. Indeed the violence of the 20th century is shown to have been initiated by the enlightenment and as 2001 makes clear, violence as the main ingredient in 'Man's advancement' really started back in the Dawn of Man. The enlightenment saw the birth of Modern Man which Kubrick certainly does not see as a good thing. He called any utopian view of Mans goodness a dangerous fallacy, a view which every Kubrick film goes to great pains to point out, but Barry Lyndon and (to a slightly lesser extent) Paths of Glory are the only two to give full vent to this Kubrickian misanthropy without qualifying it by feeling the need to please the audience. In this sense they represent the director at his most uncompromising, his purist and his greatest. Barry Lyndon in particular stands as a magnificent achievement unparalleled in the American commercial mainstream and fully deserving of the closest examination.",1517356800,,28121,4.9083455959638425
7908560,3,B00000FYPB,"I thought it moved too slow and the main character was kind of despicable, as well as man others in the film. But it was a tour de force of cinematography. But to me that is similar to CGI where people view a movie for it's visual appeal instead of story line. Good acting, gorgeous photography and scenes, but pacing is everything. I suppose almost all period pieces like this tend to be slow, but this borders on bombastic. Beautiful movie but he probably should have chopped it down to two hours. I would much rather watch HBOs Sam Adams or The Advocate, which are great period pieces. This was more like a travel ad with acting. Kubrick was too in love with the scenery to ask if it was worth 3 hours of hillsides and colonial architecture.",1516579200,,744,4.398550724637682

7908562,5,B00000FYPB,"A great, classical Kubrick masterpiece Barry Lyndon is a magnificent, sweeping epic, a haunting tale woven beautifully into a rich and almost static and slow moving tapestry. Made after the infamous Clockwork Orange has heart rending scenes of human frailty and opportunism gone wrong. Tracing an Irish adventurers progress across  a dead 18th century Europe torn by war, who is determined to make for himself the life of a nobleman through seduction, gambling and dueling, it is a roller coaster ride, full of action. The fall of the old aristocracy and the rise of a problematic middle class where money is the only measure of power and the only cultural, social and political value, where opportunism reigns supreme, leaves the spectator with a taste of bitterness. Incredibly lyrical and verdant the film is almost 3 hours long but it is an astonishingly beautiful and haunting. Director Stanley Kubrick brings his usual eye for detail to this underrated drama, which boasts some very spectacular locations and great cinematography by John Alcott who won an Oscar for his work. Quite touching in parts the film features a great performance from Ryan O'Neil who is at his most 'beautiful' and soulful and as some have thought perhaps Kubrick's most humane and perfect vision. The photography is exquisite and it is a visual treat. The costumes, settings and atmosphere created by the movie are superb, as is the classical soundtrack where Hendels Sarabande and Schuberts Trio op 100 are simply stunning. Barry Lyndon still deserves all the plaudits after so many years. It is far more exciting than most costume dramas screened on terrestrial TV.

I haven't read the novel, but I believe this is the most perfect adaptation and presentation of a Picaresque to the silver screen, and any perceived major faults with the story can be attributed to a misunderstanding of the genre.

In story telling I have a personal preference. Actually I'm not sure that it is considered preference but maybe a ""right"" way of telling a story. If the way I prefer is indeed the correct way of telling a story then Kubrick can work wonders. His approach to ""Barry Lyndon"" was not uncommon. In fact it is a style that is used in a very popular contemporary show called ""The Walking Dead."" The style of which I speak I call ""reactionary."" That is that the main character(s) overcome a series of, commonly unfortunate, events until they can no longer endure or ""arrive"" at some conclusions for good or for ill. The opposite of this would be a pro active character(s) that set out to accomplish a goal. It seems like a slight difference but it's actually quite important to making a point in a film. The person that uses the later method the best is Roman Polanski. If you look at his films the main protagonist is not facing a series of challenges that come to him or her. Rather they are seeking something quite aggressively. Whether it is a man authenticating a book or a Detective getting to the bottom of an artificial drought his characters gather no moss and are seeking something out. This is not the way ""Barry Lyndon"" plays out. It is, mostly, a series of events that happen to the main character. When something isn't happening to him, like thieves on the highway, he is getting lucky, like meeting the right woman at the right time. The worst part of this methodology is that one can't tell what the main point is typically. It's merely a series of events strung together. As a result the audience is left looking into the rear view mirror as it were and the ending just sort of happens. It may be a very good ending that even dovetails, like ""Barry Lyndon"" but they are usually left asking what the point was. Theme is much easier to come by, in fact almost mandatory in a proactive style. ""Barry Lyndon"" is mostly reactionary and does suffer in terms of theme. That said I would be a fool to not recognize its greatness. This was a very well told story and I loved it. I was skeptical when I read about it because every description kept saying it was beautifully shot and was an authentic period piece. I expected to be bored. Well it was all of those things except I was rarely bored, it was a great story. I was aware of its reactionary nature from the get go but it never bothered me because it was just compelling. I imagine only Kubrick could pull something like that off. I want to be clear that I have seen as much Kubrick that I can get my hands on so part of me was rooting for him but I don't believe I'm biased here. It's a unique and well told story albeit in an inferior style in my opinion.
Pros
-perfect music (typical Kubrick)
-great acting
-authentic period displayed in costumes, hair, environment, language, and everything
-that great Kubrick style on full display
-a great story told by an expert
Cons
-I prefer proactive story telling
-occasional slow pacing, but with purpose
-lacking in a larger point beyond what is staged

Well 1975 is off to an incredible start! Two amazing works of art from the get go. Can it keep it up?",1508025600,,3236,4.427852348993288
