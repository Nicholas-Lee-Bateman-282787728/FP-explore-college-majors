8382861,2,B002W650H8,The narration is poorly written and even more poorly executed.  The narrator lacks the necessary cultural background for the job and mispronounces words constantly.,1476921600,,164,5.833333333333333

8382863,1,B002W650H8,"In seeking info about Italy, I saw this and started to watch.  Although, there is interesting data within, before long, I was totally bored! Literally, I was falling asleep. I STRONGLY recommend they find another narrator for future programs!  (Contact me!)",1466380800,,257,5.2439024390243905
8382864,5,B002W650H8,"Enjoyed information about small towns in Tuscany, a couple of which we've added to our itinerary.  The video gave us information about Tuscany beyond Florence and hill towns that are included in many organized tours.",1464048000,,216,5.171428571428572
8382865,5,B002W650H8,I am a mental traveler. This is a trip thru an ancient and historical part of Italy that is rich in art and architecture. I enjoy the stories of the small towns and the beginnings of our greatest artists. It's very well done. I have watched it several times and will again.,1453766400,,273,4.269230769230769
8382866,5,B002W650H8,"Interesting video of one of the most spectacular, cultural filled region of the world.

In addition to the mainland Tuscany region, this travel documentary also shows the island off of the Tuscan region, especially Elba, where Napoleon was held captive.

Upon seeing this travel video, I couldn't help but notice how the style of streets and buildings in Tuscany resembled other parts of Europe. Certain narrow streets in the small cities and towns in this region looked very similar to certain streets in France, Spain, and Belgium. Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I would guess the planners of small towns and cities in this picturesque region did something correctly.",1444435200,,689,5.088495575221239
8382867,3,B002W650H8,Informative but not terribly exciting.,1425340800,,38,6.8
8382868,1,B002W650H8,It has terrible resolution even for a 13 inch screen.,1420934400,,53,4.4
8382869,2,B002W650H8,"I have enjoyed several Cities of the World travel DVDs distributed by Travel Video Store prior to this one and Egypt.  While the photography remains quite good and the sites presented well balanced, in both these the narrator seems to think more is better.  In both the narration is a rapid-fire sing-song delivery which to me and my wife quickly detracts from the enjoyment of the video.  Reducing the narrative to one half or preferably one third of what is given would allow a more measured pleasant delivery and avoid the relentless drone with which the viewer is barraged!",1297123200,,577,4.808080808080808
