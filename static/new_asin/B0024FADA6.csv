3846203,5,B0024FADA6,"I believe the reason all of us Law and Order fans are not getting the DVD's to come out in the fashion we would like is because; WOLF PRODUCTIONS is making more money selling the franchises to TNT, Bravo, etc. If you could buy the DVD's, why would anyone want to watch the episodes on television with commercials? These DVD's we are so dearly awaiting to be sold on Amazon will come out after all the reruns have been shown so many times, the maximum profits will already be made. Even the Actors are making money each time they are on TV. Sales of DVD's are just a drop in the bucket compared to the money being made shown on all the television channels.

3846207,2,B0024FADA6,"Will someone please tell the Emperor that he has no clothes?  Vincent D'Onofrio probably got this role for his extraordinary performance in an episode of the late-lamented ""Homicide:  Life on the Streets"", the one in which the entire hour is devoted to an attempt to extricate him from between a subway car and the platform.  But D'Onofrio's portrayal of Goran in this series is so far over the top as to be almost laughable.  For me, as for any lawyer who watches his performances, his blatant disregard of the rights of the accused under the U.S. Constitution is just too, too ludicrous.  Even the most novice of rookie detectives knows that you can not, without a warrant, go into someone's house or apartment and pick up objects and photographs at will.  And it is not as if the people being investigated by D'Onofrio and Erbe (whose disregard of proper procedure is just a bit less outrageous than that of her partner) are from Papua New Guinea;  they are often doctors, educators, and others who presumably would throw the pair out of the place unless they had a warrant.  Just watch a few of the episodes with Chris Noth and Julianne Nicholson playing the D'Onofrio and Erbe parts to see how good this version of Law and Order can be.",1239494400,10,1241,4.634703196347032

I love L&O: CI the best.  You can't beat the teaming of Vincent, Kathryn, Courtney and Jamey -- and the episode lineup -- ""Beast,"" ""The Good Child,"" ""The View From Up Here,"" and ""Inert Dwarf"" -- to name a few.

Not to mention I was excited to find the alternate ending to the episode ""The Great Barrier"" in as a bonus feature. Some people have heard that Chris Noth is in this season. That is true, but he's only in one episode, ""Stress Position"", ALONGSIDE Goren and Eames. The fourth season contains some of the best episodes. Only one of them was slightly off kilter and that was ""Semi-Detached"". However, all the other episodes are awesome.",1458604800,5,513,4.468085106382978

How can such a man be so smart to be able to comprehend how a criminal will think or react.  will never stop seeing this show.  I love this show and love the way that the characters solve the puzzles and problems.  The characters also have their own issues and problems and hence it does not get mundane watching it.,1376438400,,395,4.36986301369863

3846335,5,B0024FADA6,"The DVD was delivered in a timely manner and has exceeded my expectations.  I've only watched two discs of this particular set and it has turned out to be highly entertaining.  The actors, the plots of the long-running TV show have been highly entertaining and the quality of the DVD is very high.  A definite must-have for ""Law and Order:  Criminal Intent"" fans.

In addition, the price was very reasonable.",1352592000,,408,4.771428571428571
3846336,5,B0024FADA6,You can never go wrong with this series.  It's always riveting & Goren is always amusing with his eccentricities.  You'll want to have the complete series after viewing just one. This is a keeper!,1347580800,,196,4.735294117647059
3846337,5,B0024FADA6,"I have two things I would like to point out to previous reviewers. One concerns lack of 'bonus' material, and the other concerns Chris Noth's addition as the HUGELY popular Mike Logan from the mothership series after a decade of 'Exile' (pun intended) to Staten Island.

One previous review raves about the episode titled 'Great Barrier', which features the (nearly) fatal face to face confrontation between Goren and his nemesis Nicole Wallace, but fails to mention the fact that there were TWO different endings broadcast by NBC, depending on where you lived.
The 'bonus' material is the 'second' ending to 'Great Barrier', which is very thoughtfully located on the same disk as the entire episode for ease of comparing.
The first ending was broadcast for everywhere EAST of the Mississippi River (Nicole escapes and lives on).
The second ending was broadcast for everywhere WEST of the Mississippi River (Nicole is shot and killed by Goren).
The neat thing was that viewers got to vote as to which ending would become the official outcome of Nicole's character. (The first ending, Nicole escapes and lives on, was the winner).
(Ironically, in our area, right on the west side of the river, our local station was given the option of which to show, and they chose the East version, so I had never seen the second ending)!

My second item is the puzzling (to me) attacks on Chris Noth and his character Mike Logan. While I am a big fan of Goren and Eames, and agree that Goren's character is the face of the show, the fact is that Vincent had a major issue with his health due to the ultra-demanding workload of being in about 90% of the scenes, and he was either going to have to quit, or possibly be totally replaced if they didn't find a way to lower his workload.
Hence, Dick Wolf swallowed some of his pride and brought Chris Noth's character (Mike Logan) back on board to lighten the load.
All the longtime fans of the 'mothersip' know that Det. Logan was the most popular character by far for those first five seasons of L&O and were delighted to see him return!
The only problem was the producers just couldn't settle on who to partner him with.
My personal opinion was that his first partner was the best (Det. Barek), but his pairing with Det. Fallaci was hugely entertaining due to her getting into Capt. Ross' face, thereby forcing Logan to be the 'voice of reason' between them. The irony was not lost on Logan or the audience.
My least favorite partner for Logan was Det. Wheeler. I just never found her character that convincing. She was too young to be up at Major Case, and she was only there because Ross was her 'rabbi'. She ultimately stayed, I believe, because she was a personal favorite of Dick Wolf. Again, that is just my opinion. Previous opinions have varied, but any weakness of Logan/Noth can be attributed to the writing, as he can only perform to what is written.

And contrary to one previous reviewer, NO actor, including Jack Nicholson can overcome bad writing on an episode, PERIOD!
P.S. I edited this review as I had it wrong on who shot Nicole in the second ending. I originally thought I saw Eames shoot her, but it was definitely Goren, which would have made the most sense when you think about it.",1332892800,19,3237,4.63588850174216
3846338,5,B0024FADA6,"Loved this show,,This was the last season i liked before they diluted it with Chris Noth.
 My favorite episode was about the DJ who supposedly kills himself. To bad this show had to end it deserved a much better sendoff then it got!!",1320796800,,233,4.4186046511627906
3846339,5,B0024FADA6,"We love this series, and have all of the existing available season boxed sets. Amazon prices are worth comparing with other sources, even the auction sites. These are full-quality, studio-released sets. No cheap, foreign, pirated stuff here! They recently released Season Six, and we bought it from Amazon, too. Shipping is reasonable.",1314576000,,335,5.461538461538462
3846340,5,B0024FADA6,"With Law & Order: Criminal Intent ending its final season earlier this summer, I've always enjoyed watching the cast members in this show.  Makes for good suspense.  You would enjoy it as well, especially if you also like Sherlock Holmes.",1313712000,,238,4.925
3846341,5,B0024FADA6,"So far I've really enjoyed each season of this Law & Order spinoff. Detective Goren is the perfect Sherlock Holmes/Columbo combination, with Detective Eames around to keep Goren grounded. Love the twisted plots too! What's not to like??",1296172800,4,236,5.2368421052631575
3846362,5,B0024FADA6,"I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd. Vincent D'onfrio and kathyrn erbe do a fantastic job. i am particularly excited by kathryn's development of character Eames, as she becomes the feisty partner to D'onfrio's Goren. She can hold her own now and she adds a wonderful edge to the episodes. Vincent D'onfrio continues to shine as always in these episodes. I particularly enjoy how Goren and Eames make the perps literally unravel in the interrogation room. I also enjoyed the episode 'Stress Position' which introduces Chris Noth to the audience. I like the initial tensions that are set up between the two male detectives; it makes me quite excited about the 5th season!",1292630400,2,663,4.981981981981982

3846365,5,B0024FADA6,"""Law And Order: Criminal Intent"" is back...and so is Nicole Wallace. Goren's wily nemesis resurfaces in the episode
""Great Barrier."" That alone is worth getting Season 4 of this excellent show. Nicole's return, and watching Goren trick the culprit into identifying himself (or herself) is marvelous to watch. I HATE the episode ""Semi-Detached,"" but other than that, I enjoyed Season 4 immensely. My favourite episode is ""Great Barrier."" Kathryn Erbe, Courtney B. Vance & Jamey Sheridan also return, but it's all about the Goren. It's a treat watching him go like Sir Arthur's Sherlock Holmes and nab the least person you'd suspect as the culprit. Nicole Wallace WILL be back...",1285459200,6,677,5.163636363636364
3846366,5,B0024FADA6,"Season Four is a continuation of the greatest crime/drama on TV ever. Although all the Law & Orders are great...Criminal Intent surpasses them. Needless to say, i am a great fan of Goren & Eames. I would rank this series up there with some of the greatest British Crime/Dramas (which many are awesome). If you don't have this series...BUY IT NOW. I can watch these over and over, each time I see details either in the background or foreground that I missed before...it never gets boring or dry.

They are as good as usual.
Actors and Scripts, excellent!

3846369,5,B0024FADA6,Law & Order CI Is one of the Best series produced. The character of Goran is SUPERB and what I like is the very human qualities he has. Wish all the seasons were available. Vincent D'Onofrio will be greatly missed in the current season!,1264982400,,236,4.386363636363637
3846370,4,B0024FADA6,"As I write this, my husband is watching it streaming from online via netflix.  I already viewed it that way.  It seems streaming is the default way for viewing L&O of almost any of its infinite variations.  This L&O CI still has our original detectives.  This is the show at its best.  That will change in later seasons where we see our original two only on alternate weeks. In any event, for THIS SEASON you get ONLY Eames and Bobby (Erbe and D'Onforio).

The use of the law on this show is pretty good.  Yes, there is artistic license but turn on court tv and watch a real case proceed and you'll see why artistic license is so important for entertainment! I think the thing that is the most far fetched on the show is how easily both detectives are able to get admissions from suspects when the suspect has the choice to not say anything.  It seems that only psychopaths represented by counsel exercise the right to remain silent on this show.  They strain artistic license to the breaking point when smart, educated and/or affluent people cave in to them.  That is the only real flaw.

The stories are well written and interesting. Each case is followed from the point of the crime's commission to the two detectives solving the case.  Unlike the other two L&O's, there is usually not a trying of the case in this L&O.  The ending is solving the case, not winning it. This is a good evening's entertainment.  I recommend it and intend on giving Jeff Goldblum and Erbe a try when they go solo in 2010. Goldblum was very good in the 2009 incarnation of the show.

All of L&O, in any guise, is available online at Amazon Instant, itunes, Netflix Instant, etc.,  It is very behind on DVD releases.
