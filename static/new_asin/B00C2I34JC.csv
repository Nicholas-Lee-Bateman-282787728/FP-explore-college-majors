8576529,5,B00C2I34JC,"A great movie. Wonderful acting, complex story. It is not a ""happy"" story, but if you liked movies such as Norwegian Wood, this would be a though provoking film. It is set in the turmoil of the 60s, and follows the characters as their lives are shaped by the choices they make. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys learning recent history, or just wants a good serious film.",1391817600,,380,4.442857142857143
