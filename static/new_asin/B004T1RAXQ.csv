8440435,3,B004T1RAXQ,"Three couples go on a weekend getaway to a house on Lake Whisper. Twenty one minutes into the film we have out first killing. The film captured the low budget 70's gore feel down to the bad sound track. Also, the sound was noticeably bad in a talking scene between Talina (Raine Brown) and Laura (Vanelle) where Talina sounded normal and Laura was a faint whisper. (Hey! Move the boom mike near the person who is talking!)

On the plus side of the film is the acting and dialouge are above the cheese grade independent film level. Unfortunately it isn't that much above to where we stand up and take notice. The special effects are 70's grade. There were scenes which reminded me of ""Last House on the Left,"" but not enough of them.

The radio in the car on the way up to the lake includes a preacher who talks about placing meat on the porch, but not blaming the cats for eating it as it is too tempting. It also has a song whose lyrics include, ""I want to die a white man."" I wish they had developed this theme and the characters better instead on concentrating on the Wisconsin cheese.

The DVD has plenty of needless extras. Soft 3 star slasher film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Fake male organ. Clothed rape scenes.",1382054400,2,1217,4.419642857142857
8440436,2,B004T1RAXQ,"A pregnant woman (Raine Brown from 100 TEARS), her husband, and their four friends venture deep into the woods in order to be hacked, bludgeoned, and chainsawed to death by crazy hillbillies, including a masked, chainsaw-wielding maniac (zzzzz). If you are a fan of Ms. Brown , then I recommend sticking w/ the aforementioned 100 TEARS, as this movie is dull and not well realised. It's only slightly better than the godawful WOODS OF EVIL, also starring Brown. Yeeech!...",1313884800,3,472,4.987341772151899
