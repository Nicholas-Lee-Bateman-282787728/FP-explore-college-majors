3092725,4,B0012OTRTI,"I adore the movie Elizabeth. I thought it was a good showing for Elizabeth's ascent to the throne.

I ended up buying this blu-ray double movie pack because my DVD of Elizabeth was dying. Since the double feature wasn't that expensive, I decided to get that.

Elizabeth was great to watch on blu-ray.

Elizabeth: the Golden Age. Visually, I loved it. The movie itself? It didn't gel as a movie.

It didn't have the tension needed for the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

So, Elizabeth, I give 5 stars, and Elizabeth: the Golden Age I give 3 stars.

Which is why the double feature has 4 stars.",1332115200,,591,4.4766355140186915
3092726,5,B0012OTRTI,it's amazing to have this edition. combo 2 title in 1 case. perhaps not collectible but it's cheap when i get this edition. Transfer picture is very amazing .. so great and sound looks good because this a drama you don't need big volume to shake your room. And it's great story too .. must have it if the lowers prices,1331424000,9,318,4.229508196721311

3092728,4,B0012OTRTI,"Great historical movies of England and European politics and machination, which truly fascinates me, not the least are the juicy tidbits of their intermarriages, collusion and espionage. Elizabeth should be seen first then Elizabeth: The Golden Year, this way the viewer will have better chronological grasp and understanding of the narrative as events are unfolded. Good acting and colorful recreation of the period, setting and wardrobe. Although the faked English accent does detract somewhat from its authenticity. I'm happy to have learned more about the details of England's first queen Elizabeth, her wit and fortitude, aside from the expected dramatization of this obscure period in history. This is best viewed in a good surround 5.1 home theater setting to fully benefit from the Blue Ray cinematography and its great sound.",1325203200,,834,5.423076923076923
3092729,5,B0012OTRTI,"WOW!  Two of the best movies made for a terrific price.  These, in my opinion, are Cate Blanchett's best acting performances to date.  Amazon' offer of this double feature made for a nice stocking stuffer.",1324425600,,205,4.8
3092730,5,B0012OTRTI,"I know these movies aren't historically correct but who cares?
Cate Blanchett has to be one of the greatest actors of all time.

I already own these movies on standard definition and was wondering how much difference there would be between SD, and BD.
I noticed things in these movies I had never noticed in the SD versions, and everything was so vivid and colorful it seemed like a new experience!
The blu ray conversion was some of the best I've seen.

I absolutely love these movies and will watch them over and over.
I'm glad I bought them.",1312675200,13,544,4.484848484848484

3092747,5,B0012OTRTI,"Both films feature perfect roles for Cate Blanchett and Indian Director Shekhar Kapur has the perfect eye for delivering the story line.  For Elizabeth I'd recommend Roger Ebert's review from 11/1998 and for The Golden Age his 10/2007 review.  Both spot on.

Both movies are visual feasts and Blu Ray is a must.  The edge goes to the first movie which, script wise, has much more to feast on.",1453075200,,392,4.63768115942029

However...I do love a good story and these two show us a story of a virgin queen who, against the odds, becomes a great and powerful ruler.  I do not consider these movies to be action, romance, or comedy.  You may find these movie characteristics from time to time, but all in all, this movie is a drama.  A good drama movie that may or may not be historically correct.  I am sure some elements to the story are historically correct, but I am sure not all of them are as this is a work of fiction and not a documentary.",1416355200,,585,4.0964912280701755

3092787,4,B0012OTRTI,"Thoroughly enjoyed both! Brought the opulence .... and the incredible intrigue and dangers rulers faced daily, into clear focus. The historical accuracy was moderately ""fudged"" (according to Luminarium & Britannia) but generally faithful to actual events. Very pleased with the presentation of the life of Elizabeth and now have a far better understanding of the transitional times she navigated so successfully. Bravo to the actors and their portrayals of the principle charectors.",1399161600,,482,5.708333333333333

3092801,5,B0012OTRTI,"These two movies go in tandem with each other. Besides being a great story, I believe she captures the Elizabeth of History. The movies shortcut some of the history and does some blending of characters as all historical fiction does. This does not diminish or take away from the main line of the story. Also it is more about capturing Elizabeth's character and soul, and thus the soul of the nation in these times. I think it shows that she represented and embodied the nation in her time in history.

3092804,5,B0012OTRTI,"Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush are amazing!

The movies are wonderful, the performances excellent - you'd think the characters were channeling these people from lives past! - and the history is pretty much spot on.

It just isn't history.  It resembles history, and it has many similarities to what was recorded as happening, but it is missing a few important details.

3092819,5,B0012OTRTI,"To all those reviewers who feel this film is in some way anti-Catholic, portraying historical truth does not make the ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" prejudiced. The Inquisition, Spanish, and otherwise, lasted for SEVERAL CENTURIES! All those nice people we watched in this movie would have been at best imprisoned, and at worst, put to death because of the Roman Catholic Church - and it's allies in the Spanish government - had the Spanish armada succeeded in it's mission.

I enjoyed this film so much I actually watched it twice on the big screen! Something I have not done in a very long time. The acting, costumes, screenplay, cinematography and soundtrack are all fantastic! And, since this magnificent film is based on a true story it makes it all the more gripping!

If the Spanish Armada had been successful the United States would probably not exist! England would of ended up a Spanish colony like the Netherlands eventually did! And all of history would have been radically changed for the worse. At least in England they had the Magna Charter! Spain's legal system, on-the-other-hand, was an absolute dictatorship. A legacy that did not end until 1975 with the death of the dictator Fransisco Franco!!

Quite simply, being Protestant made you a member of a minority religion in Queen Elizabeth's day! Thankfully, in most parts of the world we have now grown-up and accept minority religions as a fact of life. But during Elizabeth's reign you were literally putting your life on the line. Something this brilliant film makes crystal clear, regardless if Queen Elizabeth was no saint!",1354320000,4,1594,4.984962406015038

I ended up buying this blu-ray double movie pack because my DVD of Elizabeth was dying. Since the double feature wasn't that expensive, I decided to get that.

Elizabeth was great to watch on blu-ray.

Elizabeth: the Golden Age. Visually, I loved it. The movie itself? It didn't gel as a movie.

It didn't have the tension needed for the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

3327225,4,B0012OTRTI,"Great historical movies of England and European politics and machination, which truly fascinates me, not the least are the juicy tidbits of their intermarriages, collusion and espionage. Elizabeth should be seen first then Elizabeth: The Golden Year, this way the viewer will have better chronological grasp and understanding of the narrative as events are unfolded. Good acting and colorful recreation of the period, setting and wardrobe. Although the faked English accent does detract somewhat from its authenticity. I'm happy to have learned more about the details of England's first queen Elizabeth, her wit and fortitude, aside from the expected dramatization of this obscure period in history. This is best viewed in a good surround 5.1 home theater setting to fully benefit from the Blue Ray cinematography and its great sound.",1325203200,,834,5.423076923076923

Cate Blanchett has to be one of the greatest actors of all time.

I already own these movies on standard definition and was wondering how much difference there would be between SD, and BD.
I noticed things in these movies I had never noticed in the SD versions, and everything was so vivid and colorful it seemed like a new experience!
The blu ray conversion was some of the best I've seen.

I do not consider these movies to be action, romance, or comedy.  You may find these movie characteristics from time to time, but all in all, this movie is a drama.  A good drama movie that may or may not be historically correct.

The movies shortcut some of the history and does some blending of characters as all historical fiction does. This does not diminish or take away from the main line of the story.

3327316,5,B0012OTRTI,"To all those reviewers who feel this film is in some way anti-Catholic, portraying historical truth does not make the ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" prejudiced. The Inquisition, Spanish, and otherwise, lasted for SEVERAL CENTURIES! All those nice people we watched in this movie would have been at best imprisoned, and at worst, put to death because of the Roman Catholic Church - and it's allies in the Spanish government - had the Spanish armada succeeded in it's mission.

I enjoyed this film so much I actually watched it twice on the big screen! Something I have not done in a very long time. The acting, costumes, screenplay, cinematography and soundtrack are all fantastic! And, since this magnificent film is based on a true story it makes it all the more gripping!

If the Spanish Armada had been successful the United States would probably not exist! England would of ended up a Spanish colony like the Netherlands eventually did! And all of history would have been radically changed for the worse. At least in England they had the Magna Charter! Spain's legal system, on-the-other-hand, was an absolute dictatorship. A legacy that did not end until 1975 with the death of the dictator Fransisco Franco!!

Quite simply, being Protestant made you a member of a minority religion in Queen Elizabeth's day! Thankfully, in most parts of the world we have now grown-up and accept minority religions as a fact of life. But during Elizabeth's reign you were literally putting your life on the line.
