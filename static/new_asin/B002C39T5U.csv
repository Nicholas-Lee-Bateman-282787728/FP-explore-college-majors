3902915,5,B002C39T5U,"I very rarely write reviews but I had to chime in on this one. I originally purchased this film for the sole purpose of supporting independent film. I saw the commercial on Logo and was intrigued but didn't actually buy this one until I read a review. The acting, music and over-all production was amazing, not to mention the story kept me on the edge of my seat. In the review I read, I learned that one woman actually put all of this together. She wrote, produced, directed and stars in the film. I wanted to see how someone could possibly pull all of that off and was pleasantly surprised. Although this is an indie film, the quality is great and the movie is extremely well done! All of the cast are attractive- both the female leads and male lead are sexxxy too. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FILM!",1257465600,2,796,4.385135135135135
3902916,1,B002C39T5U,"This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever viewed. This movie had the worst acting, plot, directing, ect. Some direct to DVD Movies are good, this should of been regulated to the trash bin after the last take. Don't waste your hard earned money.",1256601600,3,250,4.5777777777777775
3902917,5,B002C39T5U,Saw the movie and it was nice to see' black intelligent women portrayed in another light than pole dancers and hoochies. Very well directed and very entertaining... I recommend this movie to all who enjoy dramatic comedy...,1254873600,3,223,5.054054054054054
3902918,5,B002C39T5U,THE MOVIE IS BASED ON FRIENDS FROM COLLEGE AND THEY REUNITE FOR A WEDDING AND HERE COMES THE SERCETS AND THE DRAMA THAT WE ALL HAVE. THE MOVIE IS REALLY GOOD AND ITS WORTH BUYING .,1254614400,9,180,4.027777777777778
3902919,4,B002C39T5U,I loved the realness of this film. We all have skeletons in our closet and this film exposes what really happens with certain friendships. I would encourage people to purchase this film and reflect upon your own relationships. This movie will open your eyes in a lot of ways. The cast did a great job too!,1253836800,8,305,4.464285714285714
3902920,5,B002C39T5U,"I  saw a preview for this on BET and thought I would check it out. I always love independent films, but have seen some really poor ones with horrible writing and rushed plots and horrible lighting, Truth Hall is not one of those. It is an exceptionally good film and very well written. This film touches on some really deep topics but manage to keep the humor alive as well. The ensemble cast is surprisingly great and I expect to see many of them doing major pictures soon. I read that one of the main characters, Jade Jenise Dixon, wrote and directed the film- she seems to really be in touch with the deep topics so many major films shy away from. The secrets that come out kept me enthralled in the film, though I we got to see more of what these women were like in college- it is clear that there were a lot of secrets and like they tend to do in real life, they are coming out at the wrong time. All in all I found the film to be refreshingly good and actually feel it should have been released in the theatres.",1253145600,12,1017,4.16243654822335
3902921,4,B002C39T5U,"If your a fan of films such as ""Two Can Play That Game"" & ""The Best Man"" then you will certainly like this movie. The cast is smart, sexy, sophisticated and most importantly honest! I had my doubts about in the beginning but the story progressed beautifully and the plot thickened each passing minute. The director is hailed as the next Tyler Perry so I think this is the beginning of more to come.",1252972800,2,398,4.391891891891892
3902922,5,B002C39T5U,"Where to start?! Lots of DRAMA ladies! Without giving away too much this is a really juicy movie about girlfriends and love and deception. A group of college friends get together for the wedding of a mutual friend, then ALL of their secrets, and lies, come out at THE WORST possible time. I've read great things online about the writer/director/actor Jade Jenise Dixon, I hope to see many more drama-packed films from her soon!",1252886400,4,427,4.783783783783784

3902977,1,B002C39T5U,"This movie is just not good. I don't like to criticize another film maker's work but to prevent anyone else from wasting time and money, I have to let you know don't rent or buy this film. They say don't judge a book by it's cover, well the same goes for this film. The cover for the film, is 10 times better than the movie. The acting is horrible, which means there was no direction. The lines are no good, and to keep from butchering this film up anymore, it's better to just leave it at DON'T BUY OR RENT!!! NOT A GOOD MOVIE AT ALL!!",1367366400,,536,4.066037735849057
3902988,3,B002C39T5U,"This film was okay, but lacked a certain how do you say, production value. The plot was good just needed more.",1359244800,,110,4.285714285714286

3902990,4,B002C39T5U,"I love black beautiful women! Hell, I just like women!  Throw in a lesbian scene and I'm sold. I purchased it to add to my lesbian features. As it turned out, it was everything but a lesbian flick. However, the girl on girl scene was lovely. The boy-girl scene was hotter. The acting wasn't bad either.

It held my attention throughout. I'm not sure was it because I was waiting on the girl on girl action or just the suspense of history behind the women.  I would recommend watching it. If for no other reason than to promote it's producer for his attempt.

I enjoyed the music as well.",1351123200,,587,4.3577981651376145
3902991,1,B002C39T5U,"Not very entertaining or realistic. Superficial predictable storyline with sucky acting. Characters depicted selfish catty woman. Main character a wimpy fish. And the dialogue, aargh!  Dont waste your money.",1343174400,2,207,6.137931034482759
3902992,5,B002C39T5U,"This film has a great story line. Sometimes the acting may have not been the best but it was utterly entertaining. I think the main characters really committed to their roles and it made the scenarios seem so real. I wouldn't be surprised if more people relate to this film than we could imagine. Great film that tells a story of self-discovery, friendship, and sisterhood.",1338595200,,373,4.753846153846154
3902993,5,B002C39T5U,"The title for this makes sense because it tells the truth about life and friendship. Writer director, Jade Jenise Dixon doesn't hold back or gloss over some serious issues while keeping it light and comedic. If you think you have friends, watch this movie, you may think differently! And even more, if you think you know your friends ad lovers, this movie really makes you think! Great film!",1323820800,,391,4.764705882352941

3902996,4,B002C39T5U,A lot of drama and truths are being told. There were some parts that seemed unreal and kind of silly. For instance: the wedding was unheard of among other things. This movie did touch on real-life drama and that it is why I gave it 4 stars. The drama that each woman had was relate able.,1301184000,,287,4.142857142857143
3902997,5,B002C39T5U,This was an excellent movie about four very good friends in college whose lives went in different direction after graduating from college. Excellent,1295222400,,148,5.478260869565218
3902998,5,B002C39T5U,"""Truth Hall"" is the perfect name because we get the ""truth"" about real life issues whether we want to hear it or even whether or not we agree! I appreciated the approach to sensitive issues. I mean, this film took some twists and turns that I had not expected. I saw an edited version on the BET network and loved that. But I wanted to see it unedited and liked it even more. The acting is excellent, it's good quality, the story kept my attention, and there are lots of comical moments too. I highly recommend it!",1292025600,,514,4.309278350515464
3902999,1,B002C39T5U,This movie was horrible. I threw the movie in the trash I would not even sell this garbage to anyone.,1284681600,2,101,4.1
3903000,4,B002C39T5U,"Some have said this movie is terrible, that's not the case, and it is not the same old story, at least not told the same old way. The movie kept my attention, but from the start, as someone else stated, there was no chemistry between the actresses from a collective friendship perspective. One on one, the acting was ok, and I really enjoyed how the story was presented. This is not some blockbuster production, with mega dollars, but as an independent film, my hats off to Ms. Dixon for a job well done. I would recommend this movie to others and will definetly rewatch it.",1279670400,,574,4.476190476190476
3903001,4,B002C39T5U,"I recommend this movie. It has just enough drama, just enough light heartedness to keep your interest going the entire time. If this is the director/producer's first feature film, then I say she did an excellent job. I commend her for the chances she took in one of the major revelations of the movie (those who have seen it know what i'm talking about) as it is something that's not hardly seen in ""black"" movies. Jada Jenise (director) took a chance with this movie and I think she did an outstanding job. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you haven't gotten it for your library, get it.",1274313600,,590,4.422018348623853
3903002,5,B002C39T5U,ITS THE TRUTH IN MAJORITY OF SITUATIONS. WOMEN ARE USUALLY MORE FORGIVING THAN MEN. WOMEN USUALLY FORGIVE MEN FOR CHEATING ON US. MOVIE EXPLAINS WHY SOME ARE ALWAYS DRINKING ALCOHOL.,1270857600,,182,5.1
3903003,1,B002C39T5U,"This movie from the beginning to the end, was straight garbage and un-realistic period. The bride's so called wedding day, was an absolute/complete & utter joke lol. Even this cast of so called best/college friend's wasn't even believable,they had no friendship chemistry whatsoever. I personally don't/won't recommend this to movie, to anyone I do & or don't know. There are far better and more sensible/likable b-rate movies, available to checkout than this trash. Quite frankly they should've kept this junk/mess of a movie to themselves in my opinion!................",1268006400,2,571,5.5
3903004,5,B002C39T5U,This movie is EXPLOSIVE!! It is a MUST HAVE! I enjoyed ALL the DRAMA in this movie. Sometimes life is unexpected and these friends give you the low down on their secret lives. IT KEPT MY ATTENTION ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!!,1266364800,,219,4.365853658536586

3903006,3,B002C39T5U,"Unfortunately, I ordered this movie here on Amazon and did not receive it. Because I order so much between Amazon products and other website orders, I did not even notice. I did contact the seller a few days ago and received a very mean comment about me having to trace it myself along with a note stating that I was basically not telling the truth and to remove my review from her page because of her perfect rating here on Amazon. But because of her poor customer service skills and handling of the matter and I, never having had this issue before on Amazon,went out and made another purchase at the mall because I really wanted this movie.
After watching this movie, I really would not advise buying it. It has a plot however for me, it had so many parts to each female's story that it does not make you want more but more of you just wanting to know when it will end. The build up was one story on top of another and only if you enjoy gossip will you truly enjoy it. I personally saw no substance and everybody in the end loss.",1263081600,,1031,4.238578680203045
3903007,1,B002C39T5U,"This movie was a bomb!  I was so excited when I first read about it, I thought I would fall in love with the movie but the actors were horrible, the plot was horrible and the writing was just, well, horrible!  I need her to come look me up for her next movie because I sure as hell could compose better scripts.",1258588800,,311,4.0
