Those basic values. It also shows how the magic of a place can get into your soul and never leave you... The soundtrack only adds to this...,971913600,9,319,4.079365079365079
4856333,4,B005P2BLC4,"""Steam"" is yet another film (""American Beauty"" and ""Fight Club"") which examines our lack of fulfillment in conventional society.  ""Steam"" sets itself apart by being life-affirming; though not a ""happy"" film in the American sense, it shows that happiness through pursuit of one's desires is possible.

Whoever  reviewed the movie can't have seen what I watched.  As other reviewers have  said, there is nothing seductive about this movie, and how these dull  uninterested characters can be life affirming escapes me.

""Steam"" makes this happen, and actually it never gets overdosed.  The film is about missing and finding identities, cross-culture exchanges,  finding love and affection as part of a cultural expedition.  It will be  too much underestimation if we talk only about the gay part of it, because  it presents way too much more than we can possibly bargain for.  This is a  social tale of individual lives.

4856336,4,B005P2BLC4,"This was one of my favorite films of last year, about an impatient yuppie with all the modern conveniences in Rome that becomes intoxicated by  timeless Istanbul, Turkey.  This is a very subtle, magical film that was a  fairly mainstream success in Italy.  If you are looking for the american  gay-styled  ""porn with great locations"" you will be very  disappointed.  Ancient sexuality, wafting from young women to young men in  their sexual prime, is too complex for our very modern, narrow perceptions  of gay and straight.  It is more about feeling overwhelmed in the modern  world and wanting to be taken away.  The acting is sexy in a very  sophisticated way that will be completely lost on all but the most seasoned  American film viewer.  Treat yourself.",967334400,34,760,4.866141732283465
4856337,1,B005P2BLC4,"I've read several reviews of this film and it sounds great, a happy, romantic movie that, according to Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times and  the DVD packaging  ""affirms that happiness is possible in this  life.""
When I read one reviewer's comment that the film was well  received in Turkey a nagging question began to grow in my mind and should  have warned me.  How could an openly gay film be well received in an  Islamic country where the official penalty for homosexuality is  death?
Now that I've seen the movie, I know.  There is nothing happy in  it.  Nothing romantic.  And certainly nothing life affirming about it.  It  is a hate-filled message suitable for neo-nazis that tries to masquerade as  a 'slice of life'  The message is clear; it's okay to kill people if  they're gay.  Am I the only one who watched the whole movie, or did all the  other reviewers walk out before the end.
The video transfer to DVD is  dismal;  I had to adjust my tv's brightness and contrast to maximum to get  a viewable picture and it was transferred cockeyed so that you have to tilt  your head constantly to view the movie straight on.  There needs to be a  zero stars rating option here.  What I wouldn't give for my money back and  never to have been subjected to this trash.",967248000,6,1276,4.458515283842795

Absolutely no chemistry exists between drop dead gorgeous Allessandro Gassman and Francesca D'Aloja the stoic wife, but the conflicted husband and handsome young Turk make a lovely couple. Beautiful shots of the love-struck pair (and solo Francesca) against a background of passing boats in the Bosporus harbor are breathtaking.

The Turkish family (and old Istanbul neighborhood) is warm, raucous and real.

The only bad thing about this DVD is the ugly box cover. The sensual shot of the two men in the Turkish bath has been replaced by a hodgepodge of crappy unsexy images.",1381276800,3,665,5.148148148148148

Here's the short version - it's marketed in the USA as ""gay movie"" - in fact although it is a movie about seduction, it is the seductive nature of Istanbul itself which is explored. Yes, there is gay element - a whole 5 seconds of footage is devoted to 2 men kissing in a Hamam (Turkish Steam Bath).

The original DVD image was very dark in places, making it difficult to see details. This version is referred to as an HD transfer, and is much brighter, but there is no Blu-ray disc of this release.

Francesco (Alessandro Gassman) and wife Marta (Francesca d'Aloja) are running an interior design firm in Rome when his estranged Aunt Anita dies in Istanbul. Francesco, an abrupt, no nonsense man, travels there with the intent to settle her estate quickly. He is welcomed into the home of his low-keyed, hospitable, gracious relatives who cared for his aunt. Finding some old correspondence from his aunt to his mother, which had never been sent, he learns of his aunt's passion for Istanbul. Day by day, Francesco slows his pace and enjoys the warmth found in the old section of Istanbul which, it turns out, is ripe for redevelopment. By chance he encounters a hamam, an old Turkish bath, and then is more surprised to learn that the house he is living in sits above a hamam that his Aunt Anita had operated but which had closed. Although an agent pressures him to sell his aunt's property, and warns him that the buyer is ruthless, Francesco surprises all by announcing his intent to refurbish and reopen the hamam. All this time he has been stalling his sister back in Rome as he extend his trip from days to weeks to months.

***SPOILER ALERT***

Eventually Marta, who has been having an affair with a colleague, and is planning to ask Francesco for a divorce, flies to Istanbul to confront him, and does, but she soon discovers the joys of Istanbul herself, reading the aunt's letters, and even claiming the aunt's cigarette holder. When she awakes to find her husband gone from their bed, she instinctively enters a hidden passage to the upper level of the almost restored hamam where she sees Francesco and the young man of the house, Mehmet (Mehmet G&uuml;ns&uuml;n), in an embrace. (Viewers are not surprised by this because Francesco's glances towards Mehmet have progressed to looks of longing.) Things then take a nasty, unexpected turn. But the viewer will leave the film with the urge to book the next flight to Istanbul, to search for an old hamam.",1334793600,,2415,5.07808564231738
4856346,4,B005P2BLC4,"Suggestions in some commentaries that Steam is a ""gay"" movie are based on one very short scene. This Turkish film,  originally titled ""Hamami"" (The Bathouse) but retitled for thre English-speaking market, is essentailly a study of personal vanity and discovery.

Francesco, a successful Roman designer has been left a bathhouse in Istanbul by an aunt. In order to save it and the neighbourhood from an avaricious property developer, he decides to restore the property and re-open it in the splendour his aunt envisaged. He lives with a Turkish family who sheltered the aunt in her final year and discovers the peace and friendship he had not known in Rome, only to be murdered - we assume by an assassin employed by the developer.

The atmosphere and ambience of Istanbul give the film a suitably exotic nature, while Francesco's relationships with the inhabitants is sensitively depicted.

Those who buy this for its homoerotic content will be sadly disappointed while those who enjoy sensitive studies of human frailty and strength will enjoy a thorughly well-directed and presented movie.
Just ignore the rather tacky quote from the New York Post on the dvd box cover

4856347,5,B005P2BLC4,"Haunting, intensely moving drama about an overworked Italian architect, Francesco (Alessandro Gassman), who inherits a hamam (traditional Turkish bath) from an aunt he never knew.  Traveling to Istanbul to arrange for its sale, he is welcomed by the caretakers of the hamam.  Falling in love with the family and the simpler, quieter traditional Turkish way of life, he decides to keep and restore the hamam.

Gassmann is terrific as he portrays his character changing from a bitter, unhappy man to someone at peace with himself and the world.  The rest of the cast is fine.  Istanbul is beautifully photographed.  The writing and directing are top-notch.

The conclusion is shocking, although not entirely unexpected given events that happen early in the film.

This is marketed as a gay-themed movie, but the love affair, although crucial to one of the storylines, is of far less important than the love affair between Francesco and the Turkish culture.

So in a way I feel it was misrepresented. Foreign films aren't usually conservative when nudity is concerned. I'm not saying I was watching it to see nudity, but it was about a steam bath after all.

He decides to restore the bath after meeting Mehmet and his family. Francesco's wife Marta from Rome makes a sudden appearance in Istanbul where she finds his husband ""changed"" as she relates to her lover Paolo when she telephones him. Then the plot takes a strange twist indeed.

What this film has going for it: Interesting shots of Istanbul and appealing soundtrack. The letters Francesco discovers of his Aunt Anita are moving.

What is wrong with this film: The plot meanders, much of the scenes are shot in practically total darkness; the movie cries out for a good editor. Finally, if you are expecting orgies in the steam bath in the tradition of Roman baths, look somewhere else. The photograph on the DVD is just a teaser.",1178755200,,848,4.761904761904762

4856356,3,B005P2BLC4,"To those of you who are here, reading reviews of this film, you'll find my particular review ""method"" involves listing some of the common reactions this film might produce in its viewers and, THEN, responding to them with my own comments (which follow the words:  I WOULD HAVE TO SAY:).  Perhaps you should also note that I am doing this after years of the film's residing in my DVD library and following time-to-time viewings. I'm not a 'newbie' to this film.  So, here goes nothing.

In searching for the major theme(s) of this work, should you have found the film to be as much about wife Marta's awakening as it is about her husband, Francesco's (with his being healed and transformed by both Mehmet's love and his adoption of his Aunt's 'vision of life'); and should you see that Marta is, in fact, almost the central character since she basically becomes transformed into the reincarnation of Francesco's dead Aunt (whose letters set the whole plot in motion, transforming both her nephew's life and the lives of all around him), AND should you further feel that this is a film about the 'search for happiness'---that it's not about sex (while that physical act figures into his 'life-change', what Francesco was truly looking for was a loving and meaningful relationship), I WOULD HAVE TO SAY:  I agree with all these themes concerning this visual art work, and there's only one other I could add----though this movie does concern an adulterous married couple, it is first and foremost about Finding Love, about Finding Peace, and about Healing.  Also, folks, here's a Big Plus:  If you will only carefully(!) watch this film, you'll find something almost magically atmospheric, something of an almost mystical aura which surrounds and arises from it.

From here on, the following provides comment on this film's lesser themes/plots:

Should you think it's clear the director meant the gay plot twist to be as much a 'surprise' to the audience as it was to the film's leading lady (because there was little hint of this change in the leading man's interests until a particular scene near film end involving persons in a steam room), I WOULD HAVE TO SAY:  ""Surprise"" has nothing to do with it; all you have to do is watch the looks that Francesco, in time, comes to give Mehmet to know that something of a romantic/sexual nature is going to raise its head, as it certainly does.  Likewise, should you pose the related question:  if Francesco respects and loves this family so much, why is he having an affair with their son behind their backs, under their own roof, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY:  It seems obvious to me that this Turkish family is well aware of their son, Mehmet's, 'sexual leaning' and they are comfortable with it.  I also believe they've become 'wise' to the relationship between these two men---Francesco & Mehmet's close dinner seating arrangement and happiness with one another being only a couple of tip-offs.

Should you wonder how, since the story opens with Marta verbally trashing Francesco with malignant contempt and his responding with a blend of belligerence and frustration, we could arrive at film's end with a moment of caring between the two, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY:  Marta (and we) have arrived at this point because Turkey has been ""casting its spell"" on her, as it did earlier on Francesco......and as it did years before that on F's Aunt. Marta's time in Turkey has brought her to the realization that: a Place, an Atmosphere, a Family and, more specifically a Son, have changed Francesco, making of him a happy and different man.  This is something that she, as his wife, had never been able to do. And now, we begin to see Marta, herself, falling under many of these same influences.

Lastly, should the ending arrive and you feel that it's message was only one about the hopelessness and futility of gay life, that it's a style of behavior leading to gory death, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY:  Isn't it possible you may have misinterpreted the basis for the death which occurs (other reviewers have already disclosed that death), one which may have had nothing to do with being gay?  Rather might it not have had to do with 'murderous commerce'?  Yes, perhaps many viewers fail to see the possibility that it was cold, uncaring commercialism and accumulation of wealth which were being shown to us as becoming too all-important in modern day life.  For in an ancient civilization, such as Turkey's, these were new trends working in opposite ways from such older and gentler traditions as the Hamams. Can't you now possibly see that, for good reason, the director earlier gave us a scene between Francesco and a 'let-nothing-stand-in-her-way' Turkish business woman wanting to buy his Hamam (a woman who Francesco's realty agent warned him against, time and again, as being dangerous)?  So, viewers, do you any longer wonder why the startling ending occurred and, perhaps, ""whodunit""?

PS--All in all, while not amongst that top level of films containing a gay love theme, this work is nevertheless a worthy effort.

****",1167091200,2,5048,4.835075493612079
4856357,2,B005P2BLC4,"I believe that European cinema has a unique culture of its own (which is very different from that of Hollywood), and therefore, should be evaluated within the boundaries and aroma of that culture.  Steam The Turkish Bath successfully conveys universal themes like love and eroticism in very subtle ways; in fact, the messages are so dispersed in the atmosphere that you cannot even notice their presence in the movie.  This is just like a fine mist, or rather, steam in the air, trying to block your view, or worse yet, block your way of thinking about the plot.

If you think that you can really ""see beyond"" the mist in the air, you might very well enjoy Steam The Turkish Bath.  I would rather have a clear view of the sky, free of steam and fog, so that I get to enjoy a movie.  The characters are too shallow to allow one to connect with.  The language used in the movie changes back and forth between Italian and Turkish, with forced subtitles further blocking your view of the picture.

Best foreign European film yet for me.",1144713600,2,337,4.616666666666666
4856360,2,B005P2BLC4,"They botched the recipe on this movie, trying to tell a story about love -- several loves, in fact -- while omitting passion, longing, and fulfillment. It's as unsatisfying as... well, I'd better not say just at the moment.

I recommend you see ""HIS SECRET LIFE"" rather than ""Steam"", which is a bad version of ""HSL"". See ""Latter Days"", ""Nico & Dani"", ""Come Undone"" or ""Making Love"", all very good movies, available from Amazon, and I've reviewed them all on Amazon.

If you watch ""Steam"", you will feel like a four year old: You will have many many questions, but nobody will answer them. Like, why does some unknown guy stab Franscesco at the end? What was that? Fishing for an exit strategy? They should have used it an hour earlier and saved me the frustration. The ending was incredulous, just as everything that preceded it. Don't worry, I haven't ruined the movie for you by telling you then end. First, somebody ruined this movie long before I saw it. Second, the end has precisely no relevance to any part of the story to that point.

Again, if you want to see the exact same plot done well, see ""His Secret Life"". Want to see a GOOD movie about a married man falling in love with a man? See ""MAKING LOVE"", starring Michael Keaton, Harry Hamlin & Kate Jackson. In fact, I think I'll watch them again right now myself. The better to help me forget the turkey, Steam.

For example, only at the very end of the story is there any indication of caring between Francesco and Marta, his wife. Problem is that we have absolutely no idea what this sudden moment of conciliation is based on, even though the show's about done. Until now, all we've seen is mutual hostility between the two -- also without explanation. The story opened with Marta verbally thrashing him with malignant contempt. Fransesco, for his part, responded with a blend of beligerrance and frustration, tinged with a dash of sarcasm. We will never know how they arrived at this state of affairs. Were not this relationship a major element of the main storyline, that wouldn't matter. As it happens, the ommision is as stark as watching someone trying to erect a four story building without anything between the ground and the second floor, not a pier, beam, post nor column, just empty space.

That was how every important factor of the story was treated. Always, we find ourselves arriving at point C without ever having seen or heard of points A and B. What was the seed or basis in the relationship between Marta and Francesco for the small fruit of understanding to be borne at the end?

One promised subplot involving Paolo and Marta never happened. It wasn't glossed over, it simply wasn't there. Maybe they edited it out after releasing their synopsis. At the very beginning of the story, he was in a scene or two, peripherally, like a creepy old man walking slowly through the playground. Then at the end, Marta makes out like he's had a huge role in things. Where was it. Why bother?

The subplot concerning Fusun was even more invisible in that we neither see nor hear anything of it. If she had a crush on Francesco, somebody forgot to tell her about it because she gave us no cause to suspect it whatsoever. Again, perhaps it was edited out after the synopsis was published. The fact that I have to guess tells you all you need to know.

Which brings us to Mehmet, who is, we are led to believe by the movie's description on the back of the box, Francesco's great love. What we get is one very brief scene of two adult men fumbling about like thirteen year olds on the floor for two to three seconds with their tighty-whities on. What was that for? If there was going to be a love scene or even a sex scene, they really blew it. BUT if the message was that such a scene was unnecessary, then what was THAT for?

Mehmet is supposedly the central bullseye for the attentions of Francesco, character numero UNO. But we know nothing of Mehmet. Who IS he? Why is he available to Franscesco? Why does Francesco find him appealing?

Now that motivation is our concern, what of Francesco himself? How does he get from one (emotional) place to another in this story? Has he loved another man before his marriage to Marta? Is this something new and strange to him? Is he cautionary or troubled in any way about his feelings toward Mehmet? Especially in Turkey, where they supposedly deliver capital punishment for gay sex. What precisely ARE his feelings for Mehmet?

The letters from Francesco's dead aunt seemed more interesting and coherent than the plot of the movie, though it was used as mere filler.

Let's pretend someone gets stabbed at this point, so I can end this review like they did the movie.",1129766400,4,4680,4.571599045346062
4856361,5,B005P2BLC4,"This 1997 Italian film has an interesting theme.  It's about a successful young Italian architect who inherits some property in Turkey from his aunt.  He and his wife have a brittle, caustic marriage and it is obvious that they are unhappy.

Turkey isn't that far from Italy but yet it is a world away.  Here the pace of life is quiet and the people are friendly.  He's soon living with the family who has run his aunt's property for many years.  He absorbs some of the culture and visits a Turkish bath.  This is something new for him and he soon understands the joys of this ancient custom of steam baths that is gradually disappearing in modern Turkey.

When he discovers that his aunt's property is indeed a Turkish bath, he decides to restore it to its former grandeur and soon is totally involved in his project. Suddenly, his Italian wife comes for a visit. She has a hidden agenda, which is to end their marriage and have him sign divorce papers.  But in a interesting twist to the story, including a secret she discovers about her husband, we see her gradually change her personality.

Then tragedy strikes.  The ending is sad but satisfactory.

The best part of this film is the way it depicted Turkey.  It brought me right there and gave me insights into the ancient culture and traditions.  Acting was fine as well, especially Francesca d'Aloja cast as the wife.  She is a striking beauty which has not been tampered with by an American-style nose job or silicone curves.  Whenever she was on-screen however, her presence dominated every scene.  The plot was interesting, but some of the details remained confused throughout, especially when it came to the deceased-aunt's background. I think this was by design however. It added to the sense of mystery surrounding the central story.

Those who are interesting in exploring the contrasting cultures in Turkey today will especially enjoy this film.  Recommended.",1107129600,7,1924,4.810975609756097
4856362,5,B005P2BLC4,"What a remarkable film is Steam.  Beautiful to watch, thought provoking and gently paced.  Francesco's journey of the soul removes him from a marriage on the rocks in Italy, and places him in Istanbul, where he goes about settling his deceased aunt's properties left to him, including a long neglected Hamam - a Turkish Bath he tries to sell.  Francesco resists spending time with his extended Istanbul family, until he stumbles upon a pile of letters from his aunt to his mother, marked ""return to sender. ""  The cause of the riff between sisters is never revealed (but the story offers plenty of fodder for guessing).  When Francesco learns of a plan to level the community to make way for an enormous billion dollar commerce center he decides to remain in Istanbul and he and the family begin painstakingly restoring the Hamam.

A love story ensues (as may be garnered from the cover) as the marriage between Francesco and Marta dissolves.  Marta could easily have been left ""as is"" but halfway through the film we get to see a little from her side and realize she and Francesco are on separate journeys.

Too much hype and sensationalism has been made over the gay angle of the film (there is but a single kiss and no real nudity save Francesco's peak at a couple of beautiful women in an adjoining Hamam).  The love story is tasteful and seems like a natural course for Francesco's life to take as he enters a new world, why not a new life?

The film doesn't offer much preparation for its shocking finale, which comes rather abrubtly and unapologetically, but director Ferzan Ozpetekt makes sense of it all.

Steam film moves at a wonderful pace and is a glorious piece of filmmaking.  Highly recommended.",1106179200,7,1711,4.704697986577181

His own perspectives on his life, Istanbul, the hamam, and the family with whom he is staying are highlighted by his aunt's words which we hear throughout the movie as he reads her returned letters.
Istanbul is somewhat romanticized, with old and new customs side by side, sometimes competing and other times in harmony.  All in all, it's a lovely film in Italian with English subtitles.",1083801600,3,646,4.699115044247788

It can be recognized as a gay movie. But in fact, elements of gay life in this movie is little. The most important subject of this movie is about discovering your true self (no matter male or female). Many metaphors appeared in this movie.

4856372,3,B005P2BLC4,"""Steam"" is a leisurely sort of film as, I suppose, befits a story about a hamam or Turkish bath.  It's about a retreat from the expectations of the world.  The erotic elements of the film only underscore this retreat, so when Francesco discovers his bi/homosexuality, it's not so much a revelation about his true nature, as just another stop on his journey to self-discovery.
If I have a problem with the film, it's that the focus seems uncertain.  So much of it is about Francesco, and yet, at the end, it's clear that the truest connection exists between his dead aunt and his wife.  They are the kindred spirits, and he is ultimately the agent that brought them together.  And because so much of the film is focused on Francesco, I felt a little cheated by this, not only for his sake, but for the sake of his wife, Marta, who seems particularly unsympathetic almost to the end of the film.  And that ending seems rushed to me, as if suddenly the director had run out of film and he still had this whole story to tell about Marta and her experience of the hamam and life in Istanbul.
That said, I'd still recommend the film.  It's lovely to watch, and a thoughtful story about what's important in life.",987811200,8,1205,4.474885844748859

I cannot reccomend this film highly enough, not only to gay viewers,especially younger people who should see that there is more to life than cheap sex and dancemusic, but to straight people as well. The film is as much the tale of Marta's awakeing as it is about Francesco's. He is healed and transformed by Mehmet's love and his adoption of his Aunt's vision of life. Marta in fact is really almost the central character as she is almost transformed into the reincarnation  of Francesco's dead Aunt (whose letters set the whole plot in motion and transform both her nephew's life and the lives of all around him: Marta, Mehmet)The soundtrack is one of the most sensual and evocative to come round in ages and is a must have!

4856375,5,B005P2BLC4,"Once again, I'm a bit taken aback so many reviewers did not understand this film.  My advice is this: if you're a Hollywood or porn fan, you'll probably feel the same as the viewers here who offered negative reviews.  But if you're up for experiencing an intelligent and aesthetically beautiful film, you will enjoy this one.

This film is so many things, but summarized it's a piece of exotica (the East as seen through the eyes of foreigners) which takes advantage of its distant locale to peer back and dissect the social flaws of the West, and the forgotten humanity of the East as well.  It accomplishes as much through a deceased main character, an Italian who late in life discovered her place and contentment in Turkey.  Through the living characters, we discover her tale and journey.

I say this is an intelligent film as there are no black or white characters here; every character is multi-dimensional.  No one character is portrayed as more valid than another.  Nowhere else is this more evident than in the character of wife, who to the astonishment of the lovers shows up in Turkey unannounced.  And in a brilliant twist, it is this character who is the hereoine of the film.

This a peek into a strangely beautiful place.  It profoundly moved me.",975715200,63,1262,4.71689497716895

This movie beautifully portrays the many forms that love can take, including the possibility that a place can also fall in love with a person.  (I like this idea a lot.)  The character Mehmet talks about the 'way of the hamam - where you learn the love for all things'.
This movie also shows a way of life in Turkey that is perhaps disappearing; an old style of architecture that is perhaps endangered there, as in the whole world, by developers. And this movie shows the wonderful ways of the Turkish people -they wrote the book on hospitality, and so many of them are totally psychic - if you travel to Turkey, someone somewhere will read your palm or your coffee grounds and will be amazingly accurate.  They seem to be able to see right into your soul.
This is a wonderful movie.",973987200,15,842,4.519736842105263

What I enjoyed most about STEAM was glimpsing into a depiction of native life in a typical Turkish neighborhood. I was absorbed in the dynamics that propelled this typical Turkish family and appreciated the sense of community they established with the people around them inside and outside their front door, often using food and the rituals surrounding it as a bridge for communication. Music, vocal and instrumental, also features in this story. All in all, I found the story to be enticingly exotic.
Clearly, the main theme of the film has little to do with the Americanized, romanticized, eroticized idea of bath houses. Rather, it's all about how a change of scenery (more specifically, a cultural transplant) can spark personal understanding and change. The main couple, Francesco and Marta, bring home the bacon by working as architects and interior designers. They make things look nice. Their lives are largely superficial, including how they interact with one another in Italy. Francesco is physically beautiful, but Turkey and learning more about his late aunt proves him to be kind and painfully sentimental, too. Marta is thoroughly modern, but she eventually proves that she's nowhere near as shallow as she appears at first flush.
My favorite scenes are those that occur between Marta and her husband's lover. They barely speak a word to each other, but there's no question of what each is thinking.
I admit that I didn't adore this film, but I think it's redeeming qualities far outnumber its faults. In fact, its only glaring fault is a plot twist involving Francesco near the end of the film.
STEAM is a softly drawn, sometimes abstract story. If you don't enjoy filling in some of the blanks for yourself or if you equate the word ""sensual"" with ""sexy,"", then you should probably avoid STEAM and seek out lighter fare that requires less work or thought from the viewer.",972432000,9,1891,4.968454258675079
