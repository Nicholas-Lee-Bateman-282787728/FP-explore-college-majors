7633347,4,B01BEDN08U,"The Haunting of Alice D is a really nice little ghost story that manages to manages to marry its sleazy backdrop to a feminist message and still come across sexy at all the right moments, that takes time to build up its story and characters before hammering home the shocks with quite a bit of panache, and that's really high on atmosphere, thanks to an elegant directorial effort and camerawork, and also a simply great location and art direction. And add to that a very solid ensemble cast, and you've got yourself a pretty good spooker!",1462665600,2,539,4.625

7633349,1,B01BEDN08U,"I wish I had the choice of giving this movie no stars as it does not deserve even one star.  This is one of the lamest ""B"" movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching.  A total waste of my money and time.  The movie is definitely a low budget, amateur production.  Not suspenseful or scary at all.  A very boring movie with poor acting and ""scary"" scenes that are predictable.  The trailer gives one the impression of suspense throughout the movie when in actuality most of the movie is borderline, lame,  ""PG"" porn with the last part of the movie having any ""suspense"" (I use the word jokingly).",1462579200,3,603,4.427272727272728
7633350,5,B01BEDN08U,"I waited a long time for ""The Haunting of Alice D"" to be released on DVD. And it was well worth the wait. Kane Hodder was awesome as usual. WWE Lgend Al Snow was creepy. The stars bring us a twired tale for the ages. Brilliantly written and directed by Jessica Sonneborn. I hated to see the movie end.",1462579200,,301,4.11864406779661
7633351,2,B01BEDN08U,"Decent production values. The plot could have been interesting but as it is, it's utterly predictable. No surprises and no scares. The movie was slow but that's understandable because not much happened. I gave it 2 stars because I felt bad for the cast.",1462492800,,253,4.7727272727272725
7633352,1,B01BEDN08U,"Acting was mediocre at best. The forced make-out scene was stupid not even shocking , just awkwardly acted out. It was like, I'm going to kiss you like a twelve year old while I clumsily rube my hand on your face.  I appreciate the message, don't objectify women, but the movie is like Barney the dinosaur meets ""I spit on your grave"", and Barney plays the bad guy and victim.  In this case artsy means amateurish, with a writer/directory, trying to be clever, ""I'm going to teach a social lesson through horror"".  Sure almost every movie has some kind of message, but it was 80% message.",1462406400,,588,4.528301886792453
7633353,5,B01BEDN08U,"Horror is not my choice genre. Several unique aspects made The Haunting of Alice as enjoyable as a nostalgic ride on The Rocky Point House of Horrors.  Its an artfully-shot, titilating movie. The shooting accentuated the sexiness of the film's characters and the cool features of the house in which the entire movie was filmed.  Its  well-shot and well-acted horror eye-candy.  The Haunting of Alice D won't be the scariest or most technologically-advanced horror movie youll see. As eighty-minute horror art rides go, I would take the uniqueness, the sexiness, and the performed-at-the-theater feel this movie has over most other horror movies Ive seen.  Sonneborns theatrical horror porn is a worthwhile scary escape. Jason from Friday the 13th thinks so - hes one of the stars who make The Haunting of Alice D worthwhile.",1462320000,5,824,5.119402985074627
7633354,2,B01BEDN08U,Plueaseeeeee!! 3 stars for a soft pron movie with soft porn actors? I gave it 2 stars only because it could have been a much better movie with more money put into actors and directors.,1463616000,,184,4.285714285714286
7633355,2,B01BEDN08U,"This could have been a really good movie. The underlying story of Alice and her sister was what made me want to rent it, but fell short with no heart. The character development of the people at the party was not there so I found them boring and while the house was beautiful; the fact that there was a party going on with absolutely no music playing was actually funny. The preview was the best part....",1463616000,,403,4.315789473684211

7633357,3,B01BEDN08U,"This is a plot explanation spoiler review in case you haven't figured things out from the early clues, but not plot spoiler per se.

A large brothel was home to Alice a rebellious prostitute who committed suicide. Four generations later the family still owns the house and a party ensues of four guys and prostitutes. One woman supplies the party with LSD, which is delivered through the whisky which has a note ""see you on the other side"" some buzz words for acid users, i.e. Doors ""Break on Through to the Other Side."" A story is then planted in everyone's mind about Alice D which sounds a lot like LSD, get it...which unfortunately they couldn't create a decent movie around the pun no better than Joan of Arcadia.

The question as to how real is the ghost they briefly see or is it hallucination.

On a side note about LSD: placing it in a bottle is bad business as there is no way to measure dosage which is tough enough to begin with. The second aspect is that anyone who has done LSD, knows what the onset feels like (tingling at base of skull) and also know when they are on it. You just don't suddenly start to ""see things."" In fact most of the time you don't see things, you just think everything is funny...especially MST 3000 designed for acid users. I hate it when people who have heard one Grateful Dead song, think they know all about acid trips.

Guide: sex, brief rape, nudity. 2 1/2 stars for trying",1463097600,3,1418,4.421455938697318
7633358,4,B01BEDN08U,"Enjoyed it, it delivers an intriguing story, and despite some of the reviews to the contrary, I thought the acting was pretty good.  So many low budget horror movies out there and this one did a lot with what they had y work with, compared with other movies who may have had more $ to work with and still fail to feel authentic.

Would like to see more from Ms. Sonneborn in this genre.  Possible prequel could be set entirely in the 1800's when the ""house of pleasure"" was created maybe?  Ending when Alice arrives, already at the mercy of some malevolent supernatural force created by or attracted to, the collective nastiness that would certainly take place there, during that time.  Just throwing that out there ;)",1463097600,2,718,4.622047244094488

7633360,5,B01BEDN08U,"Wow, this movie is a whole other level of scary! The story alone is enough to make you scream or hide behind a pillow! The actors take this suspenseful horror film to a thrillingly unconformable level. The guy who played Michael and girl who played Natasha are crazy awesome!",1462924800,,275,4.63265306122449
7633361,2,B01BEDN08U,"I love horror movies, I work as a comic book artist- slow build suspenseful horror with strong visuals give me life. This movie doesn't. It has moments, certain shots, where you can see some talent real good lines strong composition good lighting. However most of this movie suffers from over blown whites, horrific room audio, and exceedingly awkward acting in body language. Did I also mention that almost the whole movie is mid shots with wonky there and then not focusing? Center framed shots with clipped heads do not interesting visuals make. Why does all of the audio in this sound like its from on camera mic but sometimes it's well controlled (leaking unnecessary ambient audio). All in all I found the haunting of Alice d boring, it reminded me of grading student films at George mason.",1462838400,3,796,4.817518248175182
7633362,4,B01BEDN08U,"[SPOILER ALERT] When an old brothel with a dark history becomes the site of a bacchanalian party complete with studs and hookers, one expects plenty of sex and horror. To that extent, Alice disappoints somewhat. Although there is plenty of skin, the sex scenes are not completely developed and the scenes of horror moves in - which creates suspense - but fails to sharply scare the viewer.  I could not anticipate whether Alice was against all Davenports, all males, or all occupants of the house being a dissatisfied soul taking her own life.  However, once you take the movie as NOT a horror movie, but as a movie where - the past misdeeds will come around  - you settle back somewhat and enjoy the goofs and romantic interlude.
However, had the movie contained more intense sexual scenes (rouses interest), subtle demonic possessions affecting the innocent minds of occupants and cajoling them to commit heinous acts (if Natasha had attempted violent bondage/torture on Adam, or sweet Jenny wanting to injure Michael, with some sharper edits, the movie would have a much darker overtone and become a real horror. However, as an Indie film, I quite enjoyed the movie as a casual view.",1462752000,6,1186,4.890547263681592

8749960,2,B01BEDN08U,"Kane Hodder is why I gave this crapfest 2 stars instead of 1.  I adore him.  Bonus--a scene w/ his shirt undone showing his chest.  That is the ONLY reason to watch this abyssmal mess.  And he's only in it maybe 5 mins at most (in flashbacks).  Unattractive young cast going around making loud breathing, smacking, and kissing noises.  Story goes absolutely nowhere.  All you get is a series of ppl going into bedrooms to make out. Can't even tell who's who because they all look the same.  No scares whatsoever.  And wtf is up w/ the ending?  Skip it.  You can probably find the Kane bits on YT.",1486512000,,596,4.376146788990826

8749964,1,B01BEDN08U,"Bad acting, bad plot, bad sound, bad camera angles. Just bad all the way around. It's abundantly obvious this was a low-budget film that bordered on really, really bad soft core porn. I kept waiting for the movie to have some redeeming quality and for the story line to pick up, but it never did, and by the time the movie ended, I just stared at the screen thinking, WTF did I just waste my time watching. It was so mind-numbing awful, that it's actually hard for me to describe. But, hey, if you like it when film audio is so bad that it sounds like the actors are stomping through all the scenes or you like the sound of slurp-kissing, then you might just like this movie.
