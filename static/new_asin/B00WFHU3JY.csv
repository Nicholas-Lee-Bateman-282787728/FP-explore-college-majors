7131734,4,B00WFHU3JY,"What an absolutely, laugh out, hysterical, film brought out on DVD by Brinkvision. This is truly a one of a kind film. Total original and is something you won't forget. I don't think I have ever really seen anything like this before. This is a comedy-drama that takes the bounds and steps into a subject not often explored by the female reality. This changes the buttons of modern day reality. Men are the ones that usually demoralize, and sexually categorize the female. In this film, a female named Phoebe takes over the reins of the dog style male persona, and leaps into the realm of sexualizing men.

A very unique film. Wonderful characters. A plot that is brilliant. Directed and written by Jiyoung Lee. Lee created a fresh film that stands out. Lee is also in the film as the character Amy. This stars as your main lead, the wonderful Jennifer Kim as Phoebe. Kim aces the part, and creates a truly memorable performance. Kim has been acting for many years now and her ability, and expertise in creating her characters, shine on screen, and Phoebe is no different.

Brinkvision yet again has brought out on DVD another film that is truly a gem, and a one of a kind experience. An independent comedy that many won't get, and many might put down, but for those who love original cinema, and not the rehashed world of just about everything that comes out of Hollywood, I think will take to this film.

The plot is very simple. Phoebe is a videogame designer. She cant find Mr. Right, and more or less the reasons are, she is openly sexual, and wild in the ideas of sexuality, and exploring that means by weird, and eccentric means. From wanting to cut a mans public hair, to all kinds of odd actions. But that also plays with the idea of the subject of the film. Why is everyone so stuck up about sex? What cant two persons explore sexually in every way? That is what Phoebe wants. She wants to find someone that understands her extreme sexual adventure. Mix in a very odd therapist, and also Phoebes extreme explorative nature, and in my viewpoint you have a wild film that lingers.

What I like about this is it turns realities. If the man talks sexual or explores his sexual side society just goes about it as normal, men are dogs, or become the Male Pervert, but when a woman wants to experience, and explore sexual means through being frank, and descriptive, a female becomes a whore, or how could she. In this the man is not the pervert, the female is, hint the title of the film.

An absolutely funny, interesting exploration of the Female Pervert. Brilliant.

8713227,1,B00WFHU3JY,"This movie is bad. There is a lot of white backgrounds, which is a beginner mistake. I can remake the entire movie just by using my white room. The movie starts to jump everywhere, this is going to cause the viewer to get lost. There is no plot or story, it was not even funny just awkward situations. Those situations will make you cringe. The only good thing this movie had was Jennifer Kim's acting. I hope this review helps the director if she reads it.",1497052800,,457,4.325581395348837

8713229,5,B00WFHU3JY,"I'll be 100% honest. It's an indie film. If you don't like indie films, you probably won't enjoy this.

However, if you are okay with a film that is more about character development, then this is a pretty cute film. It's just the story of a woman who has very strong sexual urges and has a few odd kinks involved. Her major problem is that she is a little socially awkward, especially in intimate situations. The film really highlights her struggles in trying to get guys to like her.

It's funny, quirky, and you will definitely laugh. There are plenty of awkward social situations and strange moments of questionable intentions. But the film does a great job of being cute, funny, and still maintaining a rather serious storyline.

Be advised, spoilers:

Probably the most charming aspect of the film is its underlying issues. There are several scenes in which the main character is seeing a therapist, implying that she really struggles with some sort of disorder. It's not clear why exactly she is there, other than getting advice on socializing, but it was an extra layer of depth that made me truly sympathize with the main character, and root for her to succeed, (despite her having some rather poor choices in potential mates and methods for seducing them). By the end, I felt like she was just another person struggling with problems connecting to the rest of the world.",1459209600,,1379,4.7573221757322175

8713233,4,B00WFHU3JY,"This is a very unique film that is easily overlooked by the simple cover art and the fact that the excellent female lead, Jennifer Kim, is not yet a household name.

This story of an honest and quirky attractive woman that spans from work, to dating, to developing a different video game, to wondering where all this is all headed.

If you enjoyed the 90s MTV animated series, Daria, you will love this film. The scene with the masseuse was hilarious.

While not slapstick slap your thigh funny,  this movie is pretty consistently funny.

Do yourself a favor and do not overlook this gem of a movie! Different!

Enjoy!",1454371200,,618,4.623853211009174

8713236,5,B00WFHU3JY,"This movie is unusual.  It's unpredictable.  I wish I knew someone who is like the main character and that I was close friends with her.  She's great.  Why can't I ever meet anyone like that?  There's not really a plot with a beginning, middle and an end.  It's more of a ""slice of life"" look at her.  We see her hanging out with friends, at meetings with her therapist, at work, and on a couple of dates.  She develops a video game involving the removal of men's body hair.  She works on a campaign to improve some company's image with the involvement of female refugees from Iraq who have moved to Sweden (because Americans like Sweden).  This also somehow involves Japan (because we also like Japan).  It's very funny.

So far as the DVD is concerned, there are no subtitles in any language, and the only special feature is the trailer.",1443312000,,839,4.483443708609271
