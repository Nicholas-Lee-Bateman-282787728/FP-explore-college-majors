8242977,4,B0011Z1SP4,I love the cardio core. It does intervals. You really get a good workout in a short amount of time and then finish it up with some pilates mat work. Great product.,1343433600,,163,4.125
8242978,2,B0011Z1SP4,I was a little disappointed in the intensity of the cardio workout with this DVD.  The pilates is pretty good.,1334188800,,110,4.5
