8262446,3,B0016GOM24,"Hum Tum is a romantic comedy based on the classic ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and I mean BASED ON not remake. So don't be afraid of it ruining another movie for you. The major similarities between this and ""When Harry Met Sally,"" is the relationship developes over many years, they are radically different people in thier opinions and tastes, and end up much better people in the end because of the relationship they have formed. The Film was really insparation for Hum Tum.

The story starts with Karan and Rhea meeting on a plane (both around college age, early 20s) where Karan tries to flirt with Rhea and gets no where. They part ways in Amsterdam vowing to hate each other and never wanting to see the other. But fate is tricky and has it's own idea of fun. They meet a few months later, then three years later at Rhea's wedding, later again in Europe, and eventually become friends and fall in love (with losts of misunderstandings). Each time they meet they're relationship changes: hate, respect, friendship and eventually love. While all this is happening the audience experiences thier family troubles, whether or not they are successful in thier careers and thier growth from young and idealistic (sometimes lazy and unmotivated) individuals to adults who are wiser and ready for the love that has developed between them (in fact by the end of the film they are both at least in thier mid thirties and anything but silly lovers).

It is a sweet film that is rather low key in the song/dance department, and really works because of the acting. Not a single character was badly acted (even the best friend and parent roles were well done), and the leads had good chemistry. It isn't flashy, and not all of the movie is memorable because its understated and more subtle. Ironically the thing i didn't like the most, which was supposed to be a really creative aspect of the movie, was the little animated character bits that represent the battle of the sexes and changing relationship between the leads. I just didn't like those bits and they weren't funny when they felt like they should be (maybe stuff got lost in translation). Good film, fluffy, worth the watch because of the acting.",1306281600,,2192,4.7206266318537855
