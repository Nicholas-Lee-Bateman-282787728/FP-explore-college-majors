8674113,3,B00MQVSEBI,"The audio is in Spanish and the closed captions are also. So this was a good way for me to check how well I comprehend the language after many years not speaking it. The movie itself was strange and even kind of scary in places. Things that bothered me: Okay, I get that she doesn't like this stepdaughter, but how can she pay almost no attention to her for days? The father keeps calling with lame excuses for not showing up, but why wouldn't he want to speak to his kid? I just don't get the significance of the doll. The ending makes absolutely no sense. I'm sure at least part of this is because of my poor Spanish comprehension, but I think a lot of it is just the movie.",1501372800,,676,4.1679389312977095

8674117,3,B00MQVSEBI,"I find that Spanish ghost stories are usually very well done, and this one is passable.  It has good atmosphere, set in a decaying old mansion, and a  good twist at the end.  Unfortunately, there is about 30 minutes of material here, but it is drawn out to 1 1/2 hours.  It is way too repetitious and I found my attention wandering.  There are no subtitles, except for Spanish closed-captioning.  Unfortunately, these are out of synch, so if your Spanish isn't too strong, you have to listen carefully and catch up with the captioning while listening for the next bit of dialogue.  The story description given here is in Spanish and translates that 'Luis has financial difficulties and inherits a house from his mother.  He sends his family on ahead.  They find a doll hidden in the house that disturbs the spiritual peace.  The family doesn't believe in ghosts, but echoes of the past change their opinion.'  This is worth watching if you have Amazon Prime and it is included (as it is currently).",1480809600,,998,4.67816091954023

8674119,3,B00MQVSEBI,"Entertain mexican suspense movie; but the script is not very solid and some performances are weak, specially the main character Andrea. The photography is good and the music is excellent; for this first work of director Sam Reyes it is remarkable the use of the camera language with the limitations of the budget. If you want to watch a new independent mexican cinema you should give it an opportunity.",1416960000,,402,4.840579710144928
