You rarely find awesome things on tv these days but this episode has got to be the most awesome episode from outter limits. It basically is about these soldiers who come back from war and begin building things that they have no knowledge as to why hey were building them, it's a 2 part episode and in the, the reason why is revealed to them and also the reason why and for whom  they were building for. I mean, I cant tell you.... just watch it for yourself, you will agree and even feel good for the rest of your day about it.... this rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1276387200,,694,4.338461538461538
