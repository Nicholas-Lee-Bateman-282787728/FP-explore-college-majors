6131752,4,B00H4GESV0,It was great to visit other families of children with autism. It was great showing how different the kids are based on place on spectrum.,1393545600,2,137,4.52
6131753,5,B00H4GESV0,"I really liked this film.  It's a heartfelt look at how autism affects lives in the US.  There were 20 families from all over the nation included, all from different ethnic backgrounds, religions, and all with different opinions.  It was nice to see them not push a specific agenda, but to allow everyone of the people in the film to share their own individual thoughts, regardless of what everyone else thought.

I wish I could have seen more from each of the families, but this Extended Edition provides more footage and behind-the-scenes that is really fun to watch!  I'm SO glad I got the extended version!",1390435200,3,610,4.716981132075472
6131754,5,B00H4GESV0,"This is the set to get!  So much more is added that you don't get to see in just the film version.  Don't get me wrong the film itself it wonderful.  It gives you more perspective about what the film crew went through to make the film.  You get a better idea how much work it is to put together a film.  It is amazing all they did and quickly they pulled together to do this.  I especially love the crazy pictures from behind the scenes.
  The extended interviews are great!  I love hear more from each of these families.  You have to check this set out!",1390435200,3,554,4.093457943925234
6131755,5,B00H4GESV0,"This is a lovely unbiased look at autism. The topic is shown and discussed from a variety of perspectives (through interviews with families, doctors, individuals on the spectrum, etc) without feeling like an agenda is being pushed on you. I'd definitely recommend it, especially this version because of the great bonus features.",1390435200,2,328,5.326923076923077
6131756,5,B00H4GESV0,"Richard Everts, himself the parent of a child with Autism, traveled the United States in an effort to examine the Autism experience in families representing a cross section in the United States. Everts offers views of families of all types, spanning religions, ethnicities, etc., and in doing so he allows the audience to see themselves reflected in the film.

Another gift Everts bestows upon the viewer is that he removes himself from the families' opinions about cures, treatments and even the politics of Autism, and allows each family the opportunity to speak its personal truth, leaving the audience to make up its mind.

Far from the ""woe is me"" perspective that an organization like Autism Speaks uses as a scare tactic, The United States of Autism allows those watching to see that for many, Autism is neither a curse nor a life sentence that forever damns those with the diagnosis to a life of dependency or unproductive existence. On the contrary, we see, specifically in Alex Plank, a man of value and contribution who, quite articulately, exemplifies how much someone with Autism can contribute to society; and in Robyn Neibauer, a little girl who sees herself not as a victim but as a proud Autistic who embraces the challenges of having Autism rather than viewing herself as flawed, deficient or damaged. There are a vast number of lessons to be learned from these beautiful, loving families, not the least of which is that love is universal, and Autism is not symbolized by Rain Main any longer.

The extended version offers additional footage not in the original release, an in depth look at the making of this labor of pure love, and interviews previously unseen.

This film, crafted by the father (and mother) of a boy with Autism, is a testament to the strength, the power, and the unconditional love that EVERY parent has for their child, whether or not that child has Autism, and it provides an extremely necessary alternative to the frequently frightening and even hopeless portrayals of Autism that have been prevalent for far too long.",1390435200,10,2060,4.910919540229885
6131757,5,B00H4GESV0,A great program that offers everything it's viewers could ask for. All around excellent! I would highly recommend this to anyone.,1452211200,,129,5.190476190476191
6131758,4,B00H4GESV0,"This was a good, all round peek into lots of different families and how they cope with a diagnosis of autism. I believe it's worth seeing, but if you choose only one to see, watch Neurotypical.",1445472000,,193,4.388888888888889
6131759,5,B00H4GESV0,"For years I have felt so alone with this Autism thing, not anymore. I knew I wasn't completely alone but this just hit home in so many ways. I hope everyone, around the world can see this because it gives light to a subject that is needing more attention everyday.",1440979200,,264,4.3
6131760,2,B00H4GESV0,"Speaking as someone on the Autism Spectrum with two autistic daughters to advocate for, I liked the view of the entire spectrum, high to low functioning, but I disliked the continued blame of vaccines as the cause of Autism. I hope it is just that this movie is outdated, but it still taints the view of people who do not know better.",1438732800,17,334,4.403225806451613
6131761,5,B00H4GESV0,As a teacher of students with autism this helped give me some much needed perspective.,1438214400,,86,4.8
6131762,5,B00H4GESV0,This an uplifting movie showing the broad spectrum of autism and how families handle the challenges. I found it inspiring.,1435363200,,122,5.15
6131763,1,B00H4GESV0,"Beginning of it started with a disclaimer that the thoughts/opinions expressed were not their own, blah blah... and yet...curious that no fewer than FOUR different families were wearing Age of Autism t-shirts. For those who don't know, AoA is the most bogus advocacy organization I know of. I was willing to let the people who made the vaccination comments slide...but what a curious sample of people...so many AoA t-shirts. I can't chalk that one up to coincidence. From where must they have selected their sample families?

On top of that they made sure to quote a professor who claimed that ""his"" evaluation of the evidence indicated a 5 fold increase in autism outside of diagnostic/surveillance measures. Let's just say there isn't exactly scientific agreement on that, but I suppose I can't expect scientific literacy from a film maker. It was a moving film though; it takes all kinds of minds. :D",1412899200,7,903,4.9801324503311255
6131764,3,B00H4GESV0,"This was okay to watch one time, but I wouldn't watch it again.  I bought it with hopes that it would help show my students some different looks at autism, but it seems like all of the families had the same things to say and there wasn't much interaction with the kids that have autism.",1402358400,,286,4.2
6131765,3,B00H4GESV0,"It might be because I subscribe to autism pages, or that I am active in the autism community, but I found this movie to be full of information that most autism families will already know.  There were quite a few families interviewed, which is good in that you see a broad spectrum represented, but time was restricted due to the number of families, so each interview was too brief, and I felt like we only brushed the surface for most of them.  I would have preferred less - but longer and more in-depth - interviews.

I also found the film very depressing.  A lot of crying.  I had made the mistake of inviting my 12 year old son, who has high-functioning autism, to watch it with me.  I had him stop after the first few interviews.  I know that autism is difficult, and I agree with most of the families represented that it is the result of an assault on these children's fragile bodies, but I would have liked to see more of the triumphs in these children, rather than just their difficulties.

One thing that I found refreshing however, is that several of the families were not afraid to mention that their children were developing typically, and regressed only after vaccination.  I also appreciated that he included an interview with a senator who had the same thing happen to his grandson.",1398729600,9,1296,4.551724137931035
6131766,5,B00H4GESV0,This is a really great movie.  Job well done!  For anyone with a child on the spectrum or are in close contact with someone else on the spectrum this is worth watching.  It really gives a great insight as to how different autism can be not only the disease itself but the the way others handle/view it.,1394496000,3,302,4.2631578947368425
8629852,2,B00H4GESV0,The writing was awful.  Seems to try too hard.  This may have been therapy for film maker but was nothing for me the viewer.,1498780800,,124,4.125
8629853,5,B00H4GESV0,Being a grandmother raising a grandson with autism I found this an uplifting movie.  Thank you!,1485820800,,95,4.9375
8629854,4,B00H4GESV0,Very informative! Watch with family who you are trying to explain what Autism is and how they can be a support going forward.,1481328000,,125,4.478260869565218
8629855,5,B00H4GESV0,A great perspective on all families affected by autism.,1479772800,,55,5.222222222222222
8629856,3,B00H4GESV0,I think the documentary would have more value if more time was spent with few families.,1473638400,2,87,4.5
8629857,5,B00H4GESV0,A good review of various forms  and activities going on with respect to autism.,1466726400,,79,4.642857142857143
8629858,5,B00H4GESV0,"I like the way they portrayed each family in their own surrounding with their own views untouched. I planned to watch just a little of it but ended up watching the whole movie. Points I left thinking of:
Health Insurance needs to provide more coverage
More support for the other siblings as well as their parents
The public still not nearly informed enough",1465516800,3,356,4.666666666666667
8629859,2,B00H4GESV0,"Wasn't what I had expected. Many stories, however, the person starring said he was trying to find something to help his son. There were really no treatments discussed.",1464825600,2,167,5.0
8629860,5,B00H4GESV0,excellent,1462406400,,9,9.0
