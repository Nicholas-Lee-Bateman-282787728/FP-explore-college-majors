3908397,2,B002CZBOMY,We were disappointed in this DVD.  The pictures and colors are beautiful.  But the speaking voices have such thick accents that we could not understand what they were saying.  We would have been pleased if the DVD had closed caption words embedded in it.,1348531200,3,254,4.7272727272727275
3908398,1,B002CZBOMY,"Buyer Beware: The only clear images are the photos on the DVD box! The first two DVDs featuring castles inflict viewers with grainy old footage from the 1990s and earlier. The history consists of dull narration ""enhanced"" by the worst synthesizer elevator muzak I've heard in decades. If you're into fake flutes, don't buy this boxed set, read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elevator-Music-A-Surreal-History-of-Muzak-Easy-Listening-and-Other-Moodsong-Revised-and-Expanded-Edition/dp/0472089420/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elevator Music: A Surreal History of Muzak, Easy-Listening, and Other Moodsong; Revised and Expanded Edition</a>&nbsp;instead. It's like Ma and Pa went on a cheap vacation tour package back in the day, prior to being completely hobbled. They return with this film to bore their relatives. Shots linger on dusty housewares in castles that have been turned into hotels or museums. Catch the glassy eye of yet another stuffed deer, or explore another wobbly close-up of faded carpet. The narrator drones while fake drums bleat vague New-Age tunes. The mind numbs. I'm falling asleep. Oh no! I don't want to dream of faded chintz . . .

Only the last DVD in the set, on Clans, is passable, at least it provides more recent film and narration, and the soundtrack attempts ""Scottishness"" at times, but the muzak lingers.

3908401,3,B002CZBOMY,"Didn't live up to the title. Two discs of old castle videos, which I already had on DVDs entitled ""Castles of Scotland"" and a disc on the Clans of Scotland, which was new and interesting. I guess it was too  much to expect that there was enough new material to make three new discs. Ah well, live and learn.",1293926400,6,307,4.203389830508475

8364659,5,B002CZBOMY,"The DVD arrived to me in good condition just like the seller described on the internet and in the amount of time it said it would be here. The history is great to find out about but the background music is HORRIBLE. The quality of the music is good but the track that they picked just plays over and over and over during the entire movie and it gets pretty annoying. Overall, great product but whoever made this program should've picked another song or songs to put on the DVD.",1377648000,3,477,4.311111111111111
8364660,3,B002CZBOMY,There was a lot of buildings / castles shown with mention of what one was looking at (no names or locations),1377129600,,108,4.190476190476191
