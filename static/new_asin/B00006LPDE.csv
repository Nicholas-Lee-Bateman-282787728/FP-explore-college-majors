1786223,5,B00006LPDE,"This 100 year overview of Latinos as viewed by Hollywood is a great blend of entertainment and education, with enlightening commentary. We used it recently in a conference about Latinos and it was a great way to stimulate disucssion about how to evaluate and improve images of various minorities in the media. Agree that there should be a version with Spanish subtitles. It was fasinating to learn that Spanish language versions of Hollywood films used to be shot at night, using same sets etc.",1150416000,8,494,4.892857142857143
1786224,5,B00006LPDE,"A lot of people don't know that film has been around for a century and they REALLY don't know that Latinos have been depicted in them since the beginning.  Defeating notions that Latinos have only been in Hollywood since they were about to become the largest minority group, this documentary is a brilliant investigation of both Latinos and Hollywood.  This is strong cultural studies in which the interviewees make clear why the analysis of race and representation is so crucial to academics, politics, and modern life in general.
This film should be applauded for its gender-inclusivity.  Not only are Latino and Latina interviewees featured, but the depictions of Latino masculinity and Latina femininity are examined as shown in film.  Further, the narrator is a woman (Wanda de Jesus) at a time when most narrators are male (think of the narrator for VH-1's ""Behind the Music"", for instance).  However, Ramon Novarro is mentioned as the first Latino Hollywood star, yet it's never mentioned that he was openly gay.
While most of the film characters are Chicano, the interviewees range the gamut in terms of Latin American ancestry.  The film not only features actors and actresses; it includes Latino directors, producers, set designers, and others.  For readers of Latino film studies, it is great to see the faces behind prolific academics such as Noriega and Ramirez-Berg.
This documentary is excellent in terms of covering film issues, but also Latino issues generally.  The film mentions that Mexico banned American movies for a long time due to their negative depictions of Mexicans.  Thus, politically-correct readings and protests are nothing new.  The NAACP's boycott of ""Birth of a Nation"" was not the only time in which people of color fought Hollywood racism.  The film mentions the civil rights movement, the Monroe doctrine, the bracero program and other events that affected Latinos inside and out of Hollywood.
Latino actors talk about others encouraging them to change their names or dye their hair:  issues that Latino non-actors face too.  Further, the actors complain of Latino character roles going to white actors when perfectly good Latino actors are available.  Thus, the controversy over the first film about Frida Kahlo is nothing new.  Additionally, Latino actors talk about the crummy jobs they had to take to first break into film:  matters that all actors face.
The documentary is not perfect.  The chronology falls about at places.  There are two sections on the 1960s for no reason.  There is a discussion about gang films from the 1980s and 90s before they even discuss Latino films from the 1970s.  In order to get Latino actors to talk about their experiences, they have to avoid being critical of their work.  For example, Ricardo Montalban defends the Latin lover type even though many would have problems with it.  Elizabeth Pena is feature frequently, even though she has played highly degrading depictions of Latinas.  Moreover, it must be noted that A-list actors are missing from this work (Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek, Benicio del Toro).  One wonders if they can't expose and critique the Hollywood that has made them so rich and famous.
The sections of this documentary are written in grainy chalk writing for some reason.  Additionally, this DVD had no Spanish subtitles or dubbing.  In the US, the majority of Latinos are still foreign-born and many have difficulties speaking and reading English.  I understand that documentaries don't have big budgets to include cool extra features.  Nevertheless, the lack of a Spanish translation of this work will leave many viewers who would love this piece out of the loop.  It's a true shame.
Despite my critiques, this was the best thing I have ever rented in a while.  I think this film says so much about Latinos in general, not just in Hollywood.  I applaud everyone who was a part in its production.  This will be worth everyone's time.  It's an eye opener and nourishment for the brain.",1043020800,17,3985,5.04434250764526

7972063,1,B00006LPDE,"It's really nauseating to listen to celebrities such as Rita Moreno complain about how difficult is was for them to become movie stars because they were Hispanic or latino, and treated with so much prejudice!  It makes them sound ungrateful, like Leonardo DiCaprio's response to ""finally"" receiving an Oscar.

Hispanics have been received with open arms and hearts, in spite of their faults since the days of black and white.  Take the world famous, philanderer Desi Arnaz, for example.

Who is more to blame for any negative, Hispanic stereotypes Hollywood promoted, than Hispanics themselves.  If it meant so much to Hispanics not to be portrayed in a negative light, why did they accept such adverse roles?  Perhaps because wealth and fame means more to them than their heritage.

This DVD went into the ""for sale"" pile before I could finish watching it, although I doubt anyone will buy it.",1468540800,,894,4.959731543624161

I can't help but imagine the many contributions that have been lost because of the intense level of racism in the movie industry and the role it plays in perpetuating stereo-types.
