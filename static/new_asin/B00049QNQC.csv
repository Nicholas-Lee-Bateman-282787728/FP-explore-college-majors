8036028,4,B00049QNQC,This DVD is not bad but there no fights. Yusuke is having some problems with him self and wants to go to demon world lookin for Raizen. There is more talking in this episodes. Not bad though.,1138406400,,191,4.1891891891891895
8036029,3,B00049QNQC,"Don't expect this DVD to have any cool fight scenes. It pretty much has to do only with Yusuke talking to the first Spirit Detective, Kuroko. The First 2 episodes were basically Yusuke's time spent with Kuroko. Kuwabara and Kayko popped up a few times but only a few. Basically, some minions of one of the Kings wanted to make Yusuke the new leader so they want him to go to the Demon Realm to train. The last episode was the best out of all of them since Yusuke FINALLY confessed his love for Kayko. Also, Hiei and Kurama finally appear with strange messages from 2 of the other kings of Makai too.",1111449600,3,599,4.3097345132743365
