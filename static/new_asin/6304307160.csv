836901,5,6304307160,"The realism of the gunfights in this movie is amazing. It clearly demonstrates what a high caliber gunfighter is capable of doing. The scene where Morgan shoots a stick in the air and keeps it up with multiple shots is one of my favorites. The revolver shots are loud and thunderous.and very realistic. The guns used in many western movies sound like popguns. The weapon Morgan uses can do a lot of damage to anyone he shoots at. This is Lance Henriksen at his best in a gritty tale of an aging, weary gunfighter who cannot escape his reputation. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it. I have occasionally rewatched it over the past few years.",1434412800,,682,4.464

Lost my copy to Katrina and unfortunately he's a collector, but he does let me borrow it when I need to see ""Bishop"" every now and then.  Also, check out ""Profile for Murder"", another good Henricksen flick.  Side note* Henricksen, Popeye and Jabba the Hutt have a single tattoo on their left forearm.  Wicked classic!",1434326400,,627,4.715596330275229
836903,5,6304307160,"A very under-rated western, don't understand why it didn't do better at the box office. Although the cast (except for Lance and Kay) are unknowns to me, they all do a very good job. Lance's dog is just a hoot, and Nikki DeLoach gives a fine first performance. Brent Stait makes a fine villain, wish there had been a bit more of him before the final show down.

For this movie, Lance bought his own 14"" barrel Colts, custom holsters, boots, a period saddle, and a re-blued Henry rifle (that last courtesy of Thell Reed, just about the best armorer around.) He also paid (out of his own pocket) for Rex Rossi to come on board as production wrangler and stunt man. Rex was the one who taught him the knife tricks for Aliens and this was his last work before retiring.

I won't add any more to what has been said by the other reviewers who have rated this one highly, but I do want to comment on a remark made in a less favorable review that seemed to hinge on one thing.  There is a scene where Frank has ridden off with Kristen, and toward the end of it she goads him into showing her how fast he is - he draws his gun, shooting off a tree branch and then hitting it a number of times as it falls towards the water. There are many gunshots, all of them very loud.  This is a universally accepted movie convention, just like explosions where multiple angles are replayed. In this case, is was being used to show subjectively how terrified Kristen is at the sudden violence - something that reviewer didn't seem to understand.",1424044800,,1522,4.329824561403509

It only lasted 3 years on the Fox network but it was great.  It was a spinoff of the X-Files with Lance as it's star.  He was given many critically rave reviews for it and was even nominated for the best actor Emmy award.

One has to admire Henriksen's deep commitment to a role; and in Gunfighter's Moon, Henriksen's Frank Morgan is no exception. As I discovered in his autobiography, LH had spurs, hat, and probably more custom made for him. He went around the set (and apparently off the set too) living the role of a gunfighter. His stance, his look, his entire demeanor personifies the old west tough guy. But this tough guy has a soft spot for his former lover. And when she telegraphs him to come and save her now husband, Frank discovers that he has a sixteen year old daughter, who is unaware of his existence.

Now to my opinion. Some scenes are very well done, while others are uncomfortably weak. There is a scene with Frank and Linda that works on all levels. There is a scene in the bar with the bartender pushing around his hired help that is sadly weak. It seems that in Lance Henriksen's long career, he was slave to his screenwriters and directors. When paired with a quality script, talented co-stars and a director with talent, Henriksen could contribute on all levels. Sadly, that wasn't always the case. No actor can carry a film on his own. Nobody.
In the end I enjoyed Gunfighter's Moon and if you are a fan of Lance Henriksen, I would give it a try. Unfortunately, being out of print, there is a stiff premium on this DVD. If you find it for $20 or less, I would snap it up as I don't see this being remastered on blu-ray anytime soon. Probably never.

I was from the opening scenes, pleased with this movie.  It was good to see a western where the lead character is gritty, not ' politically correct ', and is his own man. In a bio on Lance, I read where he really put himself into this role, and was able to handle his own stunts and revolver work.  The results being a good old fashioned western where a dark hero comes to the aid of someone from his past, and no matter what the odds, he prevails.  One can also note themes taken from other westerns like High Noon, when the townsfolks refuse to assist their local stand in law man.  But it is Frank Morgan's story, and Lance makes Frank come alive and he steals every scene he's in.  The closing scene seems to be a fitting end for such a good film.

  I rate this as about half as good---but the 4th best best western I have seen.
  Lance Hendrickson is terrific as he gives off the sympathetic persona of a sad, resigned, top level professional (gunfighter) who is true to his calling, whether he chooses the situations he finds himself in or not.  The picnic scene with his daughter (who doesn't know he is her father) as she chatters on about her father--how she would have liked so much to have known him---how (she was told) he was killed in the war----is wrenching.  The contrast between the innocent, chattering young girl and the grizzled, weatherbeaten-by-life, but tough as nails aging gunfighter is brought home strongly.

  The final scene is the best gunfight in any movie (I realize the finale of Shane is tops too).
  The bad guy here is absolutely terrific----one of the best , scummiest, slimiest badguys ever.  The guy deserves an oscar for what he did there (He has one from ME).  The long,drawn-out prelude to the actual gunfight---- where the head bad guy talks and talks and talks to give his two fellow hoods time to manuever into positions that makes it look impossible for the hero to come out alive--- is the highlight of the movie.
  The very ending, where the daughter finally gets an inkling of who the stranger might be, is wrenchingly effective.

7867401,5,6304307160,"I WATCHED THIS MOVIE YEARS AGO, LANCE HENRIKSEN IS A EXCELLENT ACTOR WHO I THOUGHT NEVER GET THE DUE CREDIT HE HAS DESERVED. IN THIS CLASSIC WESTERN HE PLAYS A GUNFIGHTER NAMED FRANK MORGAN, WHEN THE WOMAN HE LOVED, AND STILL DOES CALL FOR HIS HELP HE DOES WHAT ANY MAN IN LOVE WOULD DO. HAVING A DAUGHTER AND NOT KNOWING ABOUT IT JUST STRENGHTEN THE PLOT. AND AS IN ALL GOOD WESTERNS, WITH HIM BEING WHO HE IS, AND DOING WHAT HE DOES WHICH BY THE WAY HES VERY GOOD AT, THERES A LOT OF ACTION IN THIS FILM. ALL IN ALL ITS ONE OF THE BEST WESTERS IVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF WATCHING, ITS A VERY HARD MOVIE TO FIND ON DVD, SO IF YOURE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND IT, AND FIND IT AT A DESCENT PRICE I WOULD ABSOULUTELY PURCHASE THIS MOVIE. I GIVE IT 5 STARS, IF I COULD RATE IT ANY HIGHER I WOULD. A MUST SEE FOR ANY WESTERN FAN. THANK YOU AMAZON, IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS MOVIE FOR A WHILE NOW.",1510790400,2,883,3.9385474860335195
7867402,5,6304307160,"I really liked this movie! One of best modern era westerns since Silverado, Pale Rider, etc.. A true western made in the classic mold. It is well done, has a very good, solid supporting cast and nice attention to detail. Classic (old school) plot but done very well. Some will say it's very clichd but it was obliviously done as tribute to classic westerns and it pays homage to the 1st and still one of the best westerns of all time ""Shane"" (as did Pale Rider among others)... As the main character, Lance Henriksen does an excellent job in the anti-hero role as well. Better than just about every new age gunslinger since the glory days of westerns. Good all around quality production too. The DVD I bought was also top quality and had no issues at all.",1504828800,,755,4.478260869565218

7867408,4,6304307160,This was very good for a television movie. It rates a little better than average as a western gunfighter movie. The acting and the plot were better then I expected. It was relatively fast-moving. The plot was a bit hackneyed in places.,1475107200,,235,4.619047619047619
