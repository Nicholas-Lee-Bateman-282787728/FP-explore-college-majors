4441962,5,B004OWQTPU,This show has become one of my all time favorites. Highly recommend anyone to buy and watch. Penn and Teller really help open up your eyes.,1388707200,,139,4.384615384615385
4441963,5,B004OWQTPU,"I'm only into Season 3, but I already know that I am thoroughly entertained with this show, both in its presentation and intellectually.

Most of the episodes have interesting and entertaining tricks and gags that at least let Teller be doing something while Penn is talking (and he loves talking).  A lot of his commentary during the interviews is hilarious.  I find myself laughing out loud, which I usually don't do as much when other people aren't around.  The best thing though is that they provide you a perspective on lots of issues that you aren't necessarily going to have neatly proselytized to you by anyone else, like you do with recycling, yoga, and other BS.  And, there are also lots of naked people!

A few gripes:  I will admit that they do try to keep people that they are interviewing in context, and basically give them enough rope to hang themselves.  But, I think they choose more extreme cases of whatever it is that they are debunking.  In other words, it's hard to not think the people that they are showing are spouting BS.  If they showed more moderate people who still held x or y belief, it wouldn't be as convincing.

I also think it's clear what they think about a topic prior to the ""evidence"" presented during the show.  I believe they admit as much, and granted, most of it would not convince a reasonable person.  Something that bothers me about this though is that they will (sometimes) use these preconceived conclusions they've reached as filters in assessing the evidence.  For instance, if you already think yoga is ""just stretching"", you won't accept that it could be something more.  Perhaps it's not.

I'm also not sure why they trust the ""facts"" from one expert with whom they agree more than the ""facts"" from one with whom they disagree.  There are instances where you have dueling scientific studies...  who is correct?  I guess I'd like more exhaustive evidence that the wrong guy's ""facts"" are BS besides them just sounding plain stupid.  But, I also get it that this is a TV show, not a science documentary.

""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.""  Michael Shermer (and many a skeptic) says that this is not how science is done.  I agree with him in the context of someone else trying to prove that their belief is *true*.  But the point I want him to understand from this quote is that lack of proof doesn't mean that something isn't *possible*.  Is it true?  Maybe, maybe not.  If it's unproven, then it's possible.  This is why I think that the only rational position one can take is agnosticism.  This, combined with the preconceived notions that filter reality, is what makes me think that atheism (""explicit"" atheism I guess) is a belief system not based in science.  I know some will disagree about that.

My gripes are mostly those I have with strong skeptics in general, and aren't specific to this show.  That's why I give this show 5 stars.  It's thoroughly entertaining and gives me new things to consider.  Also, I'd venture a guess that there isn't a single person that agrees 100% with them on everything, including myself.  But, I am glad this show was made, because it provides an awesome and different perspective on things that many people either ignore or just accept.  I want to know the truth, and I think this show takes me a couple steps closer.",1385769600,3,3329,4.65979381443299
4441964,4,B004OWQTPU,"An awesome show that deserved better. It annoys me a little that the seasons have widely differing packaging.

Also the Vatican episode is still absent. **** censorship!",1384560000,8,169,5.2592592592592595
4441965,5,B004OWQTPU,"I love this show. Got these in the mail quickly. Note they don't mention the exclusion of the vatican episode, which i believe is pretty important for anyone interested in the atrocities of the catholic church.",1437955200,2,210,4.861111111111111

4441969,4,B004OWQTPU,"Excellent series! Hilarious and very interesting. I think Penn and Teller make compelling arguments against each subject they tackle.

The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is the packaging. Since the show is over, I wish they would issue a ""complete series"" package rather than individual sets. Also, Season 2 of the sets is bigger/bulkier than the rest (3 normal size DVD cases). Anyway, it's a minor complaint, the show is what's important.",1415664000,,450,4.8441558441558445
4441970,5,B004OWQTPU,"This is a great series that goes over a bunch of difference topics. It looks at a how we view different topics and how they are ""Bullshit"".

Interesting to see if you have never watched any episodes.",1415577600,,199,4.378378378378378
4441971,5,B004OWQTPU,"One may not agree with everything these guys say, but they did open my eyes to changes that have occurred since I participated in some of the activities they highlight.  Personally, my eyes were really opened to how the Boy Scouts and universities are being run now compared to when I took part decades ago.  Also, as noted in other reviews, the show about the Catholic church is absent from its respective season, and is noted on the retail box.",1409097600,2,446,4.5625
4441972,4,B004OWQTPU,"This is a Penn & Teller Showtime original where the duo explores the more humorous side of several controversial subjects from The Apocalypse, Having a perfect body, Cheerleaders, Perfect lawns, etc. They really make you think about these subjects in different ways. Its always funny and always witty and always pretty crude and rude, which I love. Since its on Showtime they can show nudity to prove a point and theres plenty of expletives. Its half-hour long, so its a nice quickie and you may learn something. Its educational and fun. Even if you don't agree with them on everything, I think you will still get a kick out of it.",1406937600,3,631,4.693693693693693
4441973,5,B004OWQTPU,"A fantastic series that makes my libertarian heart sing with joy. I don't always agree, but I'm always challenged to think in a different way.",1406764800,2,142,4.72

8437350,5,B004OWQTPU,I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he loves it. He loves this show and was so upset when it went off the air. Now he can have it forever and watch it whenever.,1525132800,,167,3.6666666666666665
8437351,1,B004OWQTPU,"I'm sure if it would play on our Australian DVD/blue ray player we would be happy with it, however we have to buy a DVD player that will allow us to change the country code to watch it. Will review it when we can do this.",1497139200,,221,3.8260869565217392
8437352,4,B004OWQTPU,"Thank you to everyone who mentioned the missing Vatican episode. It was very easy to find online. I would not have known it existed, and that was my favorite one.

The nudity was excessive, which was a turnoff for me. However, I enjoyed the topics they discussed and how they made you examine your views. I still disagree with them on some things, but I am more open-minded now on others.",1492905600,,388,4.464788732394366
8437353,5,B004OWQTPU,My favorite series associated with Penn & Teller. Perfect sense of humor and very entertaining.,1480636800,,95,5.4
8437354,4,B004OWQTPU,"Although I still haven't watched all of the DVDs, so far so good. I would have rated it at five stars, but it's missing the Vatican episode from season seven. That episode I was fortunate enough to find a download for, but even Penn Jillette himself wasn't happy about that episode being omitted. Only other issue was that one of the seasons wouldn't play on my PC, but worked in the DVD player.",1474934400,2,395,4.424657534246576
8437355,5,B004OWQTPU,"I love this show. Penn and Teller expose the ""Bulls*it"" behind many topics, such as: PETA, Environmentalism, Religious Hysteria, etc. Very funny and entertaining.",1474156800,,162,5.791666666666667
