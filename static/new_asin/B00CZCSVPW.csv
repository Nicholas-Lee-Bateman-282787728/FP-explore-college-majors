8587897,3,B00CZCSVPW,"HASTA LA VISTA's subject-matter is a familiar one: three teenagers decide to go to Spain to lose their virginity and hire a mini-bus to do so.  When they eventually get there, they find the experience not quite what they anticipated.  The major difference between Geoffrey Enthoven's film and other examples of the genre is that the three protagonists (Robrecht Vanden Thoren, Tom Audenaert, and Kimke Desart) and all disabled: one of them is paralyzed from the neck downwards and confined to a wheelchair;  another is blind; while the third suffers from terminal cancer and is also confined to a wheelchair.

The film is as much about how the protagonists negotiate their disabilities as the road-trip itself.  All of them are heavily dependent on their parents; but for this road-trip only, they decide to branch out on their own.  They engage the services of a taciturn bus-driver-cum-nurse (Isabelle de Hertogh) who appears to resent their presence, even while looking after them.  As the trip unfolds, however, so she loosens up; and eventually becomes their protector, even though she has a shady past.

The film has some sentimental, not to say implausible elements; given the parents' concern for their siblings' welfare, it seems highly unlikely that they would permit the ambitious road-trip to go ahead, especially when they eventually catch up with their offspring at an anonymous gray concrete hotel.  The ending is also a little predictable, as one of the three protagonists, after having achieved his dream of losing his virginity, passes away, DEATH IN VENICE-style in his wheelchair by the sea.  Nonetheless there are some highly humorous moments along the way, no more so than when the three friends try to manage for themselves in a hotel room without the nurse's help, and end up spending an uncomfortable night together.

HASTA LA VISTA contains some remarkable performances by the protagonists, who refuse to let their disabilities get them down; like most teenagers, they are alternately irritating, attractive yet lovable.  When they eventually get to the specially appointed brothel, catering especially for disabled clients, their reactions are definitely worth remembering.",1436054400,,2200,5.2722063037249285
8587898,4,B00CZCSVPW,"Three disabled Flemish boys, Lars, Philip and Jozef are virgins. Philip is a paraplegic, but makes the most out of his mouth. Lars is suffering from a tumour, and he doesn't know how long he has left to live. Jozef is almost completely blind. These three friends embark on a road trip to lose their virginity, with the usual bumps and twists along the way. Whilst the suggestive cover may suggest a comedy film, Come as You Are has all the laughs you expect from the subject matter of three disabled men questing to lose their virginity, and it also has all the drama one would assume would arise from three disabled men bumbling their way to a Spanish brothel.

Even though it's a foreign film, the humour is not lost on an English-speaking audience. The jokes are tight and funny, and you'll find yourself laughing along, not laughing at, the trio. It's highly sensitive to the subject matter, and it never feels uncomfortable, making you empathise with their disabilities. It's not a laugh out loud comedy, at least it wasn't for me, but I found plenty of moments to chuckle along, and there are a few moments of comedic genius.

What makes it such a good comedy, is that it plays out more like a drama, with humour interspersed within it. Come as You Are never feels forced in its humour. The scenes don't feel contrived to make a joke, the jokes fit the scene rather than the scene fitting the joke. However, the dramatic aspects, which feel like the main focus of the film, sometimes fall flat. There are the obligatory moments of misunderstanding and makeups and some of the tension felt forced. Mainly, as a whole, the story is touching and the characters are all well-defined with their personalities, some more likeable than others. Like with the scenes, the characters make the jokes, not the jokes making them. They are funny in their own ways; Jozef, awkward, bumbling, and Philip, brash and mean. I was pleasantly surprised with the ending, and the events that happen show that drama takes precedence over comedy.

The script is well-written, and the cinematography and shooting is polished. It's more than serviceable, and there a few moments of beautiful shots, one in particular of them washing in a stream, which looks like something out of a nature magazine.

As with any road-trip, it's not the beginning or the destination that matters, it's the journey in between, and there is enough conflict and drama and humour to fuel the car you're in for the one hour and forty minutes. Come as You Are is a highly enjoyable foreign film, which tickles you and your heartstrings, never playing you, but guiding you into feeling the right emotions. It's not a film about three disabled men journeying to lose their virginity. It's about three men that are disabled who want to lose their virginity for their own varied reasons. It's cliche on a road-trip film for them to find out who they are at the end, but Come as You Are, whilst adhering to the ideas of a road-trip film, is very far from the norm. It's more dramatic than comedic, and its merits make it more than worth a watch.",1416441600,,3095,4.663003663003663
