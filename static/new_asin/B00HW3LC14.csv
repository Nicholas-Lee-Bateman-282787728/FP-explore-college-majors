8636794,5,B00HW3LC14,"As a huge B.A.P fan, I must say these dvds are the Best, Absolute, Perfect! The quality and angles of the cameras are fantastic (not like some other I have seen where the cameras change angles every 5 seconds..) I also really like the packaging/box design; it's sturdy, very creative, and very shiny! Definitely would recommend this product!",1468713600,,341,4.896551724137931
8636795,4,B00HW3LC14,"I love B.A.P (they're my bias group), and their live performances are amazing (I went to LOE Chicago, and trust me, it was fantastic). I purchased this DVD because it goes with my B.A.P collection, and I wasn't disappointed. The concert footage and sound were great for the concert DVD. With the bonus DVDs-- the making of the show and documentary-- content was fun, funny, and thoroughly enjoyable. The photobook has great pictures that will make any B.A.P fan drool at our gorgeous boys. Any Baby/Warrior should have this in their collection.

Now, I did purchase the DVD here since I didn't want to wait a few weeks for a DVD to come from Korea, but this DVD is at least $20-$30 less at other K-Pop retailers if you don't mind paying for shipping (even then, it's still cheaper elsewhere). Amazon should be ashamed for jacking the price up this much.

Five stars for the DVD; one star for Amazon, and that was earned because I received my DVD a day prior to the actual arrival date. :\",1400371200,6,988,4.544943820224719
