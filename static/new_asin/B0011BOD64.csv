3064391,5,B0011BOD64,"I ordered this because I was very satisfied with the calculus 1 tutor. This 2nd tutor is very helpful and it explains concepts in a simple and clear way.

This tutor isn't made for people who already ""get it"". People who want to take their knowledge to the next level. This tutor is actually great if you want to understand a topic and its concepts; which is explained in an excellent way, a way where none of my Calculus teachers could so far.

Now it doesn't cover every single topic you may encounter in class, things you may not even need to know, but it does cover what's extremely important to know for calculus 3.",1216252800,3,620,4.3826086956521735
3064392,5,B0011BOD64,"Jason Gibson can teach anyone any kind of math.
I had been out of school for 20 years when I returned to college. My first idea was that I would try it out and see how far I could get with math. I really started to struggle when I got to calculus. This is when I started looking for outside help. I found Jason's dvd's and thought I would give them a try, and just hope they were more detailed than my instructor.

See when you tottle along in your math sequence. You have this idea that you have achieved this or that, and you are on to the next thing. It turns out we don't remember all those little things we learned on the way.  These ""little"" things you learn in algebra and trig will literally save your life in calculus. I found that calculus in and of itself is not difficult to grasp. It is all those little things ""magic tricks"" or tools that you had once and forgot. You get to this place of what am I going to do with this?

 When Jason would be solving a problem, I would literally think ""how is he going to get himself out of this one? Then he would say ""remember...."" Say law of exponents or something like that. Jason reminds you of previous tools, that make the solving so simple.

I would suggest that you read his resume on the mathdvd website if you lack any confidence in his credentials. What Jason is doing is a painstaking amazing thing to take such complicated material and make it so simplistic. I highly recommend his dvd's to everyone. Jason Gibson will teach you math in a way that empowers you and makes it your for life . Giving you the confidence to accomplish goals that you never thought possible.

3064393,5,B0011BOD64,"I have purchased the following dvd's from Jason:

1) Calculus 1 & 2 Help
2) Advanced Calculus 2 Help
3) Calculus 3 Vol. 1 Help
4) Calculus 3 Vol. 2 Help

Let me start by saying that these videos are FANTASTIC!  I am a ""non-traditional"" engineering student in my 30's.  I was in the military for 11 years and am now back in school.  With this large a gap inbetween school classes, I was bound to forget some topics. First day of calculus 1 class I was lost.  That night I scoured the internet for tutorials etc and found Jason's site. I am so THANKFUL that I did.

Jason, just has a way with his teaching.  He never rushes through topics, only gives you information that is the most important, and I think most importantly shows you how to work problems step by tedious step.  With his dvd's and some practice I was able to get an A in calc 1 & 2, and am on my way to one in calc 3.

Calculus 2 is a real bear for a lot of students.  Its just filled with a ton of topics that don't seem to relate to each other in any special way.
This dvd helps solve the mystery for you.

Certain sections are especially well done in my opinion:  partial fractions, arc length and surface area, and sequences and series.  Without the videos I honestly am not sure I would've gotten through these sections.

All I can say, is if you are having issues with your calculus classes, do not hesitate to purchase these videos, they are a LIFESAVER!

Thanks Jason!",1209513600,11,1440,4.21978021978022
3064394,5,B0011BOD64,"Jason Gibson's DVD Tutorials are an excellent source for those interested in higher level Math and Calculus courses. The Advanced Calculus 2 Tutorial covers the entire syllabus of a college Calculus 2 course and is presented in a very clear, engaging, and concise format...

There are various topics in Calculus 2 where the material becomes tedious and quite complicated. The Tutorials help you get through the core of the material, with very good analysis of the concepts, followed by 5-8 examples that utilize the concepts just taught..

For those having difficulty  understanding Integration by Parts; Trigonometric Substitution; Partial Fractions; Sequences; and Series....these DVDs are a must! Jason Gibson nails the subject matter and breezes through these difficult material with ease....

It is obvious that he has a solid understanding of what is important in the material and thus, he gets straight to the point. He doesn't spend time with long explanations of proofs and other supplementary material that all textbooks cover..He is most interested in helping you solve the problems you will see in your homework and exams.

I have picked up several of his other videos and plan to buy more. It is obvious that Jason Gibson loves teaching and is very good at it. From my review of other tutorial DVDs on calculus, I am convinced that his Math Tutor DVD courses are by far the best tutorials in the market...Highly recommended...A gift for students taking math courses!!!",1209168000,2,1481,5.154166666666667
3064395,5,B0011BOD64,"I just finished second semester calculus at my school (Calc II) and used this extensively before and throughout the semester as a study aid.  I will tell you that Calc II is hard, and very involved.  There is some overlap between what is in Jason's Calc 1 & 2 tutor and this one.  Some of the integration techniques that you will need to know are on that set.  Different schools will present the ""first year"" calculus curriculum in different order.  In my calc I class we got to anti-differentiation/integration at the very end, then in Calc II picked up with applications of integration like area and volume (which is on this set) and then went to techniques of integration (like u-substitution, partial fractions, trig substitution, trig integration, etc) some of which is on this set and some on the previous DVD.  So you really want to get both of those to catch everything.

As I have said in other reviews, this is a compliment, not a substitute for class and homework.  For two reasons.  First, as Jason states, he does not cover everything you will be exposed to in class.  He hits the areas that he feels are the most important.  Second, Jason is not picking test and homework problems, and the only way to get an idea of what your instructor is going to focus heavily on is to go.  For example when Jason teaches improper integrals he takes what I would describe as a less formal approach which will give you the correct answer.  The technical way to do the problems however is the convert the problem to a limit introducing another variable like t and plugging that in as one of the limits of integration.  If your teacher is a stickler for the ""formal"" approach you may get points taken off for omitting that step. An example of something you will spend some time on that Jason does not cover here is approximate integration which involve different rules for getting a decimal approximation.  In my class we also spent a chapter on differential equations, getting an introduction to them and how to approach solving some of the more basic ones.

If you learn all the material on this DVD set well, you will have about 75-85% of what you will need for the final exam.  These are great to look over before you start class to get an idea of what you will be doing, during the semester if you don't fully understand a concept from the lecture or how the book explains it, and as a final review.  Jason selects problems as examples that range in difficulty level, but are usually not as difficult as the hardest problems in the book (usually the even numbered problems from the end of the problem sets).  The examples you get here are most likely the types of problems you will see on a quiz or exam because they generally do not take a lot of time to solve.  Whereas some of the homework problems you may come across could be the one and only exam problem (if your teacher really wanted to be mean) because it would take the entire time to solve it. If your learning style is conducive to being able to learn from taking notes off a DVD presentation, then this will be a great investment.",1305072000,,3096,4.494642857142857

Yes, theory is important, but to gain confidence and a fast start problem solving is the best way to go.  This DVD set does just that.

To get the most out of this set I would recommend Adrian Banner's ""The Calculus Lifesaver"" and REA's ""The Calculus Problem Solver"" as auxillary texts to hone in concepts.  Of course using Simons' ""Calculus with Analytic Geometry"" simultaneously is an added bonus.

8241362,3,B0011BOD64,"I own 16 of the engineering and math tutors in this series. One of them is The Advanced Calculus 2 Tutor. This Tutor would be helpful as a review and a source of worked problems while taking a math based course. However, you will need to work many additional problems other than those covered in The Advanced Calculus 2 Tutor - 4 DVD Set. Jason Gibson informs the student that the Tutors assume that he/she has some background in the indicated topics and/or is taking a course requiring the said math background. He also suggests that one should work additional problems and/or understand the ones he works.

In general I find all of the DVD Tutors I own to be helpful as quick refreshers. They would also be helpful to students who are taking engineering courses(especially electrical engineering) and are not accustomed to applying math to the solutions of technical problems in general. The author is earnest in stating that he in general doesn't provide proofs for much of the math he uses in solving the problems. If you are a student who is uncomfortable in using results without ""proofs"" you may be uncomfortable with some of the Tutors.

The strong points of the Tutors are the detailed solutions of the problems that are solved on the DVDs. Beginning students should find this helpful. However, they should find other related problems to do immediately. Otherwise a student may not be exposed to a sufficient mix of variety in the types and difficulties of problems that can be encountered when viewing other sources( or doing homework and exams).

The Advanced Calculus 2 Tutor covers most of the classic math topics. As such, students in STEM disciplines other than engineering may find this Tutor useful. This Tutor doesn't include the math topic, Probability & Statistics. However, there is a separate Probability & Statistics Tutor in the DVD Tutor series. It is included in the 16 Tutors that I own.

I gave the Tutor 3 stars because since it deals exclusively with mathematics topics, more justification of some of the results would be appropriate.
