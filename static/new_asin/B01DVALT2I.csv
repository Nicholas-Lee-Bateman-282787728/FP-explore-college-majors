7724869,5,B01DVALT2I,"Great set of the first four Jason Borne movies. Be advised, this set does NOT include the most recent movie ""Borne"" but it does have a slot in the case for the movie. I was confused at first because I purchased the newest movie separately. When I opened this DVD set it had a slot for the newest movie but inside is a cardboard cutout the shape of a DVD that says""coming soon to blu ray"" So I simply threw out the cardboard disc and put the newest movie in the slot. Now I have all 5 of the Borne movies in the same set for a complete collection all in one spot.",1515456000,2,562,3.982300884955752

7724875,5,B01DVALT2I,"I'm a Bourne fan from when the original ""Bourne Identiry"" was released. I already owned all these Blu Rays individually. I bought these because at the time it was on sale or a Gold Box Deal or something and, each film had a digital download code. I find streaming to be preferable to using a DVD so much of my existing library I update, when the price is right, and buy digital copies of all new films. If a DVD comes with it, it's a plus simply because I also get to grow my DVD library; kind of like books, which I prefer over digital (e.g. Kindle books).",1512259200,,557,4.166666666666667

7724908,3,B01DVALT2I,"ok, robert ludlam would probably turn over in his grave if he were alive to see these, since the only similarities between the books and the movies are character names.  i was impressed with matt damons performance in this movie, even if the story line was somewhere out around mars.  ludlum had a believable story line, this one was pure fantasy and hard to follow, probably because it was modeled similarly to a rambo movie.  guess they thought rambo as a spy would do well, and they weren't wrong it looks like.

all the bourne books, that were able to stand alone, had story lines that were influenced by the events of the time they were written and published.

examples:
 the book ""the borne identity"", jason borne was ""created"" to find and destroy a specific assassin.  the born character was also written with multiple personality disorders as well as having amnesia.

the book ""the bourne supremecy"" was influenced by britain handing over china

the book ""the borne ultimatum"" was the assassin that created jasons amnesia comes back to finish the job.

""the borne legacy"" written by van lustbader, was annoying to me because the bourne character was written similarly to the movies borne character.  legacies are usually about what's left behind, in this books case it involves a son.  guess i can understand the change of script, since damon chose not to do the movie.",1490313600,2,1377,4.812765957446809

7724912,5,B01DVALT2I,"Intended or not, but the consequence is as intriguing as the story line is as of itself. James Bond vs Jason Bourne. Decide for yourself as you immerse yourself with this four movie sequel. After you have viewed this great & smart collection, purchase the last title ""Jason Bourne"" to add to this set ; which has a sleeve to store this last Blu-ray in. Then you have a complete series to enjoy over & over again. I sincerely hope you enjoy your collection as I do. Bond or Bourne, I love them both.

I tested my Blu-Ray player to ensure that the problem was not on my end but the first two discs would not play.  Started the replacement process, which is an annoyance and inconvenience.  No indication if this is a regional coding issue although I doubt that as there were no errors or messages.

My player would display its normal reading and playing messages (both on the player display and on TV screen) and I would get a very short duration pop-up from the disc showing loading on my TV but after going through this process the player would then stop.  Cleaning the discs did not help and I tried each of the first two discs.  I did not bother with rest of discs as I will have to return the entire set.",1481932800,,1118,6.0

7725129,5,B01DVALT2I,"The best-selling suspense novel by late author Robert Ludlum comes to the screen for a second time, following a 1988 made-for-TV movie. Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a barely alive amnesiac with a pair of bullet wounds in his back, pulled from the Mediterranean by Italian fishermen. Bourne's only clue to his own identity is a bank account number etched on a capsule implanted in his body. He quickly finds the Zurich bank where money, a gun, and a few identification documents await, but after he's pursued by security goons at the American consulate, Bourne realizes he can trust no one and offers a German gypsy

The Bourne series is a well-written action spy film that stays true to its espionage thriller genre while inflicting flinch-inducing moments of pure cinematic action.",1470787200,,787,4.962121212121212

The digital copy was easy to download - but what's more is that you can get BOTH the iTunes AND the Ultraviolet (you can choose Flikster, Vudu, and other Ultraviolet compatible affiliates) digital copies. That's right, BOTH! I was impressed with this, because this is a rare thing in my experience. It's a little awkward going through the menus, but it was relatively straight forward - just follow the directions. I'm very pleased!",1470355200,2,465,4.9743589743589745
7725140,5,B01DVALT2I,"Leaving a review on a purchased move always seems a bit odd to me -- either you like the movie already (which is why you're considering buying it) or you don't (in which case my review isn't going to change your mind!)  That said, this package earned my time reviewing it for one reason:
This is a collection of all the Jason Bourne movies on Blue Ray....except there's a brand new Bourne movie in theaters right now, so I'm going to have to buy ANOTHER collection next year some time - or have an extra single movie hanging out beside it.  WRONG!  The designers of this package deal deserve a big pat on the back!  As you flip through the nice, solid, well designed envelope pages designed for every movie -- you come to an envelope for....wait...what is this?  A page marked for the new Bourne movie!?  With a cute little cardboard Blue Ray disk marked ""Place holder for movie to be released in 2016!""  What great planning!  When the new movie comes out, I can buy it, slip it in here and have a perfectly matched set!",1470268800,6,1020,4.388297872340425

The weirdest thing is that The Bourne Trilogy had disc art when it was first released. The Bourne Legacy however didn't. So what happened here? They used the ""new"" bland design for the old films and new artwork for the new film. It's very, very odd.",1470268800,,392,4.535211267605634

Regardless if you like Jeremy Renner playing Alex Cross or not, it's a Bourne movie and that's that. When I saw this collection, I immediately purchased it. It is a book-style case with 5 slots, one for each movie and a fifth for the upcoming reboot/sequel ""Jason Bourne."" At the time of writing this is $24, and with discs and digital copies it comes out to the fantastic price of $3 per copy. I am a huge fan of the franchise and would absolutely recommend this collection as opposed to buying the discs individually. Will edit with photos soon.",1466121600,32,679,4.528455284552845
