8112673,2,B000EQ5QDQ,"What an oddball collection of movies. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. But between the poor quality presentation of the films, and the extra features that don't come close to being called ""bonus"" items, this is a set that you should pass by.

While I have had decent luck with other St. Clair DVD collections, this one is below standard and not even worth it even if you find it severely discounted from the $20 it is selling for right now. This set isn't a bargain at any price.

Two of the discs contain three movies and the quality of these films is unacceptably poor (unless, perhaps, if you are watching on a small screen, like a phone or maybe an older laptop). I think prior St. Clair collections I have own have been limited to two movies per disc (and the one disc in this set with only two movies on it does have better picture quality). Squeezing a third movie on, along with a ""bonus feature"" (that was best left off anyway), has brought the video quality of these films down to an unwatchable level.

The extra features are laughably bad. Some of them appear to be public domain items lifted off the internet (posters, photos, and stills).

The assortment of movies is an unusual combination of sound and silent feature films. First there's four classic silent swashbucklers starring Douglas Fairbanks. Then we have Leslie Howard as the Scarlet Pimpernel (incorrectly listed as a 1950's film on the back of the case). The set is filled out by the grab bag combination of Son of Monte Cristo, The Beloved Rogue, and East of Borneo.

But if you think that combo is odd, wait until you see the trailers included as extras on one of the discs. Hint: the trailers are not for any of the films included in the collection, and from the quality these trailers look like they could have been copied from old videotapes.

Again, be advised that if you are watching these movies on a large screen, you will need to be prepared for overall blurriness and a lot of digital artifacts. On account of these issues, you should not be tempted by the bargain price -- you'll just be left looking for better quality transfers of these films...",1477180800,,2145,4.544041450777202
8112674,3,B000EQ5QDQ,"The major attraction of this pack is the chance to see Douglas Fairbanks in his prime and to compare 3 of his biggest movies - Robin Hood-Three Musketeers-Thief of Baghdad. He is at his slimmest and most athletic in Thief with wonderful special effects. At his stoutest and most long winded in Robin Hood. The films cost a fortune and it shows with spectacular special effects, well staged fights and massive scenery. The women tend to be rather dumpy or suprisingly plain and of course the acting is flowery and extravagant but this is all part of the charm. Robin Hood is a long, long movie and Robin as such does not appear until halfway through but the knights jousting and the crowd scenes are impressive! The written captions are often flowery in the extreme and occassionally hilarious but Fairbanks is tremendous and one can see why he was so popular. Terrific value, well worth the price.",1209859200,5,897,4.719745222929936
8112675,4,B000EQ5QDQ,"The majority of CLASSIC TALES OF ADVENTURE 8 Movie Pack consists of highly regarded silent films that star John Barrymore, Douglas Fairbanks, and others. There's plenty of swordplay here, as well as some legends of antiquity. Ideal for fans of early motion pictures. Provided extras include movie trailers, posters, photos and a radio show episode.

NOTABLES:

Eugene Pallette (""Aramis"" in THE THREE MUSKETEERS) made a successful transition to sound film as a heavyset foghorn-voiced character actor.

THE IRON MASK, the last of the silent-era swashbucklers, was released two years into the ""talkie"" era. This literary sequel to ""The Three Musketeers"" has several actors reprising their roles of eight years earlier (Fairbanks, Bary, De Brulier, Poff, Stevens and De La Motte). Most versions of this 1929  picture include a modern voiceover by Douglas Fairbanks Jr.

Watch for future Lone Ranger Clayton Moore's brief balcony scene appearance in THE SON OF MONTE CRISTO. Ralph Byrd (""Dick Tracy"" in movies and on TV) also has a small role.

Slim Summerville and Mack Swain (supporting actors in THE BELOVED ROGUE) were both original members of the Keystone Kops.

Alan Hale (""Little John"" in ROBIN HOOD) was the father of ""The Skipper"" on TV's ""Gilligan's Island.""

""The Persian Prince"" in THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD was portrayed by Mathilde Comont, who was given screen credit as M. Comont in an attempt to obscure her gender.

Charles Bickford (EAST OF BORNEO) fought so often with Louis B. Mayer he was blacklisted for a while among all the major studios.
