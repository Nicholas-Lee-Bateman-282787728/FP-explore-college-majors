8355123,5,B0027VD3OU,"I am so glad I purchases this DVD.  I have heard so much about pygmy elephants that I had a
very different picture in my head about them.. I thought they would be little bitty elephants.  Wrong.  What a wonderful story.  There is a young man who is the nain character and he was raised in Borneo.  He  took the job of looking for these animals.  Found them
and went on to learn all about them and they also took to him.  A wonderful story for all ages.  I will be watching it again and again.  Thanks Amazon for a great DVD on Elephants.",1368144000,,537,4.076923076923077
