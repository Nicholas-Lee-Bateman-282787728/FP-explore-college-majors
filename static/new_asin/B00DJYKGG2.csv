5821255,4,B00DJYKGG2,"I gave it four stares because some of the events that happened were not in the right order that it played out in real life.  Although, I love the real clips they used from the actual case.  Overall, I will watch this again.",1390780800,,223,4.162790697674419
5821256,5,B00DJYKGG2,Very interesting... lots of insight into information that was prior not available to the public.  I highly recommend  this movie.,1390262400,,129,5.4
5821257,1,B00DJYKGG2,"This movie was done like an outline but without anything of value under the outline heading.  Rob Lowe, flat, boring and unconvincing as an actor.  I refuse to believe that this trial was as depicted in this movie.  Tiny snippets of information were mentioned with nothing to back them up.  No explanation of this ""fictional?"" nanny, was she real?  It made no sense and I guess I am glad I rented it if only to serve as a springboard for what not to watch.  Wow, amazingly bad.  I gave it two stars but I am taking one back.",1389830400,3,524,4.285714285714286
5821258,4,B00DJYKGG2,"Told from prosecutor, Jeff Ashton's, point of view, this film captures the frustration behind the state of Florida's monumental challenge in the Casey Anthony case: convincing a jury that a mother can indeed murder her child and then cover it up.  The performances are spot-on, low key and convincing; Rob Lowe acquits himself perfectly and Virginia Welch manages to convey the creepy, detached personae of Casey Anthony.

This is a good depiction of the case that held worldwide attention for so long, however, as it is based upon Mr. Ashton's book, it is necessarily limited in scope.  There is no psychological insight, no explanation, no understanding, no closure.  We are left with all the same questions we started with...i.e., how could a mother murder her child and then blithely go out partying?  What mechanism in the human psyche allows for such behavior?

These questions were not within the scope of Mr. Ashton's role as prosecutor, nor the filmmakers, for that matter.  I enjoyed this film and applaud the efforts it took to bring this story to television.  But, there will never be closure on this subject until the nature of psychopathy is brought to light in a way the public...and juries...can truly grasp.",1383004800,,1224,4.995073891625616
5821259,3,B00DJYKGG2,"Good movie to watch. I did learn a few more details about the prosecution's evidence than what was apparent at trial. However, overall the movie didn't leave me with too much more than I got from watching the actual trial. The movie is worth watching though.",1377475200,3,258,4.630434782608695
5821260,4,B00DJYKGG2,"It was very good if you are only interested in watching the trail. For me, I thought they will show us a little bit about Casey and her daughter's life but they did not.",1375660800,,169,4.0
5821261,4,B00DJYKGG2,Rob Lowe was brilliant as Jeff Ashton and gave a real human take on what it's like to throw your heart and soul into getting justice for a murdered child.,1374537600,9,154,4.166666666666667

5821309,5,B00DJYKGG2,"I watched the trial
Read the book
Then watched the movie
She got away with murder
Love to hear why the jury set her free
They are the only people who did not find her guilty
Very sad
Jeff Ashton hit the head on the nail
They forgot about poor caylee",1435968000,,249,3.9019607843137254

5821332,1,B00DJYKGG2,"Rob Lowe is very versatile and the best investment LMN has made. But again, why can't LMN produce films of little known cases as many of the networks USED to produced and ended up on LMN. Again, this one is too new to purchase just yet. It will be on again and it just isn't worth paying for this at this time. Personally, I am tired of cases that have been tried by the public and made as an over glorified re-enactment. There are better true story cases to invest in through out Amazon. Great for younger viewers who know NOTHING about this case. Again, cannot agree to purchase a DVD that is covered plenty of times on You Tube and will be shown again on LMN. It isn't as if this were made 15 or 20 years ago and they will only cover the same ground that most Americans should know by now. It just wasn't THAT interesting of an re-enactment of the facts. Too much of it is about how ""bad"" Casey is and not how others contributed into this mess.",1431734400,,947,4.180327868852459
5821333,3,B00DJYKGG2,okay movie.. most of what we saw on TV news..,1430524800,,45,3.6
5821334,5,B00DJYKGG2,"Excellent!!! I followed this case so closely, OCD closely. This was so on to what actually happened, bazz playing up to the media, Jeff Ashton (played perfectly by Lowe) the HERO CRUSADER FOR CAYLEE, and the pathetic jurors who got it so very WRONG!",1429747200,,249,4.681818181818182
5821335,5,B00DJYKGG2,Rob Lowe is great as Jeff Ashton.  Almost forgot it was just a movie.. Fun to watch.,1429488000,,84,3.9411764705882355
5821336,1,B00DJYKGG2,"Lifetime movies are often great and generally at least good; not the case here.  While Dirty Little Secret was phenomenal and produced by Lifetime telling the Jodi Arias story they had a great actress playing Jodi and an almost uncanny actor playing Travis and they proceeded to tell the story of what led up to the murder.  Had they made a Lifetime event where they actually had an amazing cast and somebody great playing Casey and they told the story of her life leading up to the event of Caylee's death it could have been extremely interesting.  Instead Casey is barely on and not well cast plus it's all about the court case which everybody already knows that followed this so it needed some red meat and instead we got burnt toast.  I could not in good conscience recommend this to anybody even though the actual case was fascinating and I followed it from beginning to end and watched the entire trial on television..this could not compare.  If you want to see a great LIfetime reenactment watch Dirty Little Secrets about the DISGUSTING Jodi Arias; it was pretty true to life, as gruesome as that crime was. Oh, and I did fall asleep at some point before this was over but I am certain I didn't miss much.",1426896000,,1213,4.545871559633028

5821340,1,B00DJYKGG2,"not what i expected.  wanted it to include more of casey and how they feel she behaved and what she did while the investigation was progressing.  thought it would start with the actors calling 911..
didnt even finish watching it...",1423872000,3,231,4.75

5821366,5,B00DJYKGG2,Loved the movie. I thought Rob Lowe did a wonderful job as Jeff Ashton. I watched / listened to the trial and was totally captivated by it. Jeff Ashton's book was wonderful as well (Imperfect Justice: Prosecuting Casey Anthony)!,1410393600,,228,4.871794871794871

5821368,3,B00DJYKGG2,"Typical made-for-TV drama. Story was engaging but the flatness of the acting and the narrow focus of the film kept it from being compelling. The action centered around the courtroom proceedings and the prosecution's preparation of the case. The defense team had some verve and surprises. Nevertheless, I was looking forward to closing arguments just to get movie over with. Had I been watching it alone, I would have shut it off well before the end.",1404950400,,449,4.921052631578948
5821369,4,B00DJYKGG2,"For a Lifetime movie, this film was surprisingly good. The acting was well done, and the non-linear format of the film was refreshing. It was also nice to see that the movie didn't always show Jeff Ashton as a flawless hero, which is partly what I feared would happen before I watched the film. However, the portrayal of Mr. Ashton as a well-intentioned prosecutor with considerable flaws rang true with what I saw when I watched the full trial. The main flaw demonstrated in the film is arrogance and makes for an interesting theory: Perhaps if Mr. Ashton had been less arrogant and more concerned in finding clear, undeniable evidence to provide a cause of death and stronger links to Ms. Anthony as the perpetrator of that cause of death, they could have gotten a verdict of guilty, which is probably true but within the realm of reasonable doubt.",1401148800,,850,4.7114093959731544
5821370,4,B00DJYKGG2,Very accurate with the trust story. I kept up with the case for months and the movie is almost dead on,1393545600,,102,3.9047619047619047
5821371,5,B00DJYKGG2,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH. I AM INTO HISTORICAL AND TRUE LAW CASES A LOT. ROB LOW IS A GREAT ACTOR.,1391558400,,111,3.869565217391304
8594005,3,B00DJYKGG2,"Hats off to the jury for intelligently delivering the correct verdict based on the facts presented. Very few times in American history this is the case. Emotional people do what emotional people do, judge based on their emotions instead of facts. The jurors went above and beyond the average folk level of reasoning. Regarding the film, unfortunately, there's nothing new that hasn't been said on the media/trial. It would have been nice if some new material was introduced. The portrayal of the real-life individuals was weak. A decent watch if you like the case. If you are looking for anything new, this is not the place.",1518912000,,624,4.89622641509434

8594008,4,B00DJYKGG2,If your into true crime you will enjoy this movie. I wouldn't watch more then once but I would definitely recommend watching once.,1494374400,,130,4.695652173913044

I successfully watch everything else including other streaming services purchased both through and outside of Amazon Prime but this video does not play. I have been unsuccessful in finding any way to contact Amazon other than here about this issue. This video plays fine on my desktop pc, however that is not where I want to watch this. Hoping someone from Amazon can advise and fix. If not, how do I get a refund for a movie purchase that I am not able to watch?",1491696000,,584,4.416666666666667
8594010,5,B00DJYKGG2,"One of the weirdest true crime stories ever. How the jury came up with an acquittal is beyond me. I bought both the prosecutor's book ""Imperfect Justice"" and the defense attorney's book ""Presumed Guilty"" to try and make some sense out of it. I haven't finished reading the books yet, i'll update this if something changes my opinion but as it stands i'm flabbergasted by the unanimous ""not guilty"" verdict on the murder charges.

This movie is based on the prosecutor's viewpoint, it is very well done.",1485388800,,502,4.7701149425287355
8594011,3,B00DJYKGG2,Rob Lowe is amazing in this. If you didn't follow the Casey Anthony trial it's not very clear. I watched it with a friend and bless her heart she had no idea what was happening bc she had no idea who Casey Anthony was. It doesn't have smooth transitions and they gloss over everything like a really long preview before the actual movie started.,1482796800,3,344,4.390625
