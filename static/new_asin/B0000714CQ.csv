It gets only 4 stars because the only complaint I have about the movie is how the plot of the movie is the same from one of the Episodes, Mighty Pete. Big Corporation tries to wreck the neighborhood in the name of progress. Otherwise this is a great movie, and imo a must have for any HA! collection. Just remember Hey Arnold: The Jungle Movie is finally on the way, after all these years to finally tie everything together, and this movie will likely get mentioned for reasons.",1463616000,2,641,4.394957983193278

1798146,3,B0000714CQ,I love the series.  Too bad they messed up the movie.  It's painful to watch such beloved characters ruined so much. If they pasted a different villian voice  in and cut out most of the first half of the film (and all of Big Bob) it could be redeemed.  But the movie just makes a strong case that gee it would be better for everyone if the villian had won.  Because that neighborhood is the underworld.  It almost leaves me haunted.,1453507200,,432,4.271604938271605

1798154,5,B0000714CQ,"If you like the series of Hey Arnold, you might also like this theatrical movie; even more than ever, now that the whole TV series is in 1 DVD set. Paramount still owns the movie, but you're getting this single DVD, now in eco-cut packaging, for under $5 now! The price keeps shrinking every time I look at it here, at least a penny at a time. It was $4.84 when I got mine AND my sister's copies not too long ago, and when I wrote this review, only $4.79, if not lower. Don't let the mislabeled online links fool you; this movie can be seen in Fullscreen AND Widescreen on the same single-sided disc. Saving an entire neighborhood from total destruction, and construction for a new mega-mall, is no easy task, even with an important historic document in tow to make the town a national landmark; just ask Arnold, Gerald, and Helga! In this movie, Helga finally admits her feelings to Arnold himself, in all the chaos going on. The only bonus features in here are an original theatrical commercial for this very movie, or ""trailer"" if you will, and a very short game about the characters of Charlotte's Web 2, which was made by Nick and released by Paramount too; as the original was made by Hanna-Barbera and released by Paramount over 30 years before that! What a bargain you'll be getting for under 5 bucks, whether or not you have the whole TV series as season sets or the whole enchilada box set, or at all! If Doug and Rugrats could have theatrical movies (still on DVD by their original companies), so could Arnold, and eventually The Wild Thornberrys, with their own movie and later their crossover with Rugrats, Rugrats Go Wild.

1798233,5,B0000714CQ,"This movie was released 12 years ago.  For nostalgia reasons I decided to watch it because I never watched it as a kid.  I'm glad I did.  One scene in particular finally gave me what I always wanted to happen in the TV series.  For being a 12 year old movie, I loved it.  Story line does seem like one big episode, but it's a great finale.",1403481600,,339,4.0
1798234,4,B0000714CQ,"While not in the same league as The Wild Thornberrys or first two Rugrats films, this is a film that, in my opinion, didn't deserve all the negative feedback it got.  It told a good story while staying true to the spirit of the show, which was always one of my favorites.  Sure, this could have just as easily been a Hey Arnold! special like the one about his parents' journal, but this big-screen feature wasn't bad as is.  Arnold is faced with having to save his neighborhood from a CEO named Scheck, voiced by Paul Sorvino, who wants to tear it down and build a shopping center.  I do wonder if something like that could happen in real life.  I mean, imminent domain is one thing, but this seems way over that.  Oh well, it still makes for a plot that Hey Arnold! has done so well over the years.  I did find the girl dispensing the spy gadgets pretty funny...apart from the regular cast, she was my favorite with that bus driver being a close second.  Overall, everything and everyone came together in the end and the solid story had a solid conclusion.  I do wish they had made another movie to follow up on the journal and the map inside as they had planned, but this film is still good.  Enjoy.",1403049600,,1201,4.321428571428571

1798236,5,B0000714CQ,"Hey Arnold! was probably my absolute favorite cartoon as a kid, but for some reason I never got around to seeing the movie. In a fit of nostalgia I purchased the DVD and I was not disappointed! If you're looking for realism, this is not the movie for you. Sure it seems far-fetched, but it's a cartoon! Fans of the show will find all the same humor and heart here. I absolutely loved it!",1392508800,,387,4.243243243243243

1798248,3,B0000714CQ,"I really can't fault this movie for being bad, but it is really predictable and the animation is basically the same as the television show. It has a larger plot and tries to continue the show's only storyline, which is Helga's affection for Arnold. It is a fine movie, just not anything special. I'd rather watch several of the tv episodes instead.",1390953600,,348,4.629032258064516
1798249,4,B0000714CQ,Childhood memories at its best! One of the best cartoons from the 90s. Must watch! They don't make em like this anymore.,1390953600,,120,4.5
1798250,1,B0000714CQ,"Lately, I've been exploring films from my past out of nostalgia. I only saw this film once growing up and thought it was pretty good. Now, I realize how poor this film really is. First off, the animation is horrid. I noticed many instances where parts of a character's body looked like a poor PhotoShop or MS Paint job. The colors are ugly as well. The writing just seems like the creators only went through one draft and didn't look back to make it any better.

The writing isn't too bad, but it seems basic and unoriginal.  The story is very over the top, which isn't bad for a kid's animated film, but here, it REALLY isn't given enough time to be what it should have been. The plot is constantly shoved down your throat, making you believe you should be getting into it, but the story isn't fleshed out enough besides ""Oh no, they're destroying the town!"". The pacing of off as well. It just seems rushed and unprofessional. There is only ONE AMAZING THING in this movie: The soundtrack is fantastic! Every time a song came on, I loved every second of it. It makes me want to see if the soundtrack was released, it's that good!

Overall, I shouldn't be knocking a kid's film,  but this is just bad. It may keep a child entertained, but if you want to look back on a movie you watched in the past, this is not a good choice.",1389225600,2,1327,4.317269076305221
1798251,5,B0000714CQ,This movie was fun to watch with my 6 year old who is a fan of the Hey Arnold! show. It is true to the characters of the show and also provides a story with heart. Spoiler: You will finally get resolution on the Helga-Arnold relationship!,1389225600,,238,4.195652173913044

1798254,2,B0000714CQ,"I didn't grow up watching the show. It was on when I was a child, but the only episode I really watched was ""Monkey Business"" when I was seven. However, after I found Arnold and Helga listed on a YouTube video as Number 3 on a countdown of cartoon couples (""We all knew this one would pop up on here sooner or later""), I decided to take another look at the show (being a hopeless romantic), and I was pleasantly surprised. I had heard negative feedback on the movie, so I initially stayed away from it. But since the same person had given a negative review on ""Recess: School's Out"" which I enjoyed, I gave the movie a try, and I was underwhelmed.
The movie starts out very slow, most of the characters disappear after the first half-hour, and while the storyline isn't bad, it's just not that interesting. I don't really want to explain it.
However, there is one scene that I think is stellar, and that is the scene when Arnold and Helga are on the rooftop and Helga confesses to Arnold that she's been stalking him and that she's loved him ever since they met. Of course, at the end of the film, she claims that she didn't really mean all that, but it's still a nice touch for people who are fans of the relationship.
So for first-timers, watch the show before you think about watching the movie. For people who know the show well, the film is worth one watch, but that's it.",1379462400,,1377,4.341085271317829

It follows the TV show, and acts like the show did, although there are admittedly some revelations that kind of move the story forward, though that felt like kind of a tease since there wasn't any more shows or movies that followed this one.

Helga is still Helga and still loves Arnold, and Arnold still needs to save the world and/or help out someone else. Only this time, there is actually a pressing event that makes it so that his attitude and actions are definitely needed when a corporate man wants to buy out the entire town.

Very sweet, funny, and cool movie.",1296345600,,733,4.184397163120567
1798309,2,B0000714CQ,"Being a 90's child, I was always watching Nickelodeon every day after school. And 'Hey Arnold!' was probably my favorite show back then. It was clever, emotional and didn't rely too heavily on the gross-out humor like so many childrens shows do. This film, however, never really emphasized the qualities that made the show so memorable.

Apparently, 'Hey Arnold: The Movie' wasn't intended to be released in theaters at all. Originally titled 'Arnold Saves the Neighborhood', it was going to be a ""made-for-TV"" movie. Nick originally had planned to make 'Hey Arnold: The Jungle Movie' as the theatrical release, but converted 'Arnold Saves the Neighborhood' into this film when production of the other film was slow.

Anyway, this movies plot is about a greedy corporation called 'FTI', who want to tear down Arnolds Neighborhood so they can build a futuristic mall. Meanwhile, Arnold and Gerald are busy looking for a document which will prove their homes are historical landmarks and prevent the bad guys from taking over.

The story is painfully bland. And despite a couple of good gags (""Block Power"" made me laugh), this movie just isn't worth your time. Even if you're a nostalgic 90's person like me. Also, this movie flopped big-time when it was released and was the cause of this TV series getting taken off the air only 2 years later. 'The Jungle Movie' was also taken out of production, which was a shame.

It's pretty ironic that this movies plot demonized greed and avarice, yet it was those very qualities which gave this movie a hasty release, resulting in the shows demise.  I give 'Hey Arnold: The Movie' a three out of ten rating.",1292976000,,1648,4.871428571428571

1798311,4,B0000714CQ,"If you like the cartoon ""Hey Arnold"" how can you not enjoy this episode?  As is the case with most Nickelodeon films this movie is basically a long episode of the TV show.  The characters are the same, the plot is similar and it is quite enjoyable.  I think children or adults would like this movie.

4 Out Of 5 Stars.",1202169600,,318,4.163934426229508
1798312,3,B0000714CQ,"This movie wasn't bad. It was a typical Hey, Arnold! affair:

-Arnold uses his usual level-headed point of view
-Helga teases Arnold about how ""pathetic"" he is (but we all know how that *really* goes)!
-Gerald assists Arnold in almost whatever he does, but doesn't stand by as an empty tool

But the movie has a premise: Arnold and his friends have to protect the city from losing a big part of itself because ATi, a new and big corporation wants to come in and tear it down; the flower shop, the meat shop, etc, etc.

It has all that you have come to expect, with a small twist at the end. One of my favorite characters (besides Arnold, of course) was the quirky mortician towards the end, he was creepy but in a very nice way.

Do Arnold and friends save the day? Well, I'm sure most of you saw this back in 2002 or have seen it since, but if not, then rent it from somewhere and watch it. Worth a look.

I have posters of it all in my room, I even have a Hey Arnold lamp and chair. They came together, as a box set. Then I have a Hey Arnold sticker. I got that at the doctors. I had a boo-boo. Anyways, I have a Hey Arnold ringtone. Its the best thing I have ever spent money on (besides the DVD that is). When some one calls, my phone goes ""Hey Arnold"". Some people don't get it, cause my name is Doug, and not Arnold, but I tell them about them movie, and they get it. Sometimes, when Im tired and they ask me, I just say, I don't know, the phone doesnt know my name. I like cheese. Exspecailly the round kind. I don't know why, I just do. Like a mouse, but not really. That made no sence. Anways, I have to go, my Honey Combs are getting soggy. I love the movie, buy it, now. Now now now, now now now, now now now now now. Ok, have a good day, eat some cheese. And Honey Combs, if you can get to your local general store. But eat cheese first, Arnold would be proud of you.

1798325,4,B0000714CQ,"I've been watching Hey Arnold since I was 9 myself. I must say that Helga confessing her love to Arnold was something all hardcore HA! fans have been looking forward too for a long time.

Also the residents of the boarding house are hilliarous!

It stays true to the show as far as the characters additudes. Arnold is still Mr. goody-to-shoes and looks on the brightside. Gerald is still sarcasic and loyal to his best friend.

Helga is still obsessive about Arnold, sneeks around, and puts up her bully defense.

I think the saving the neighborhood thing was immpossible for a bunch of 9 year old to acomlish. But then again ""Hey Arnold!"" creator, Criag Barlett, said the Hey Arnold is like a world were kids can do anything, every fourth graders dream.",1115251200,3,754,4.646616541353383

Aside from that and Helga sighing blissfully about bulldozers at the end when she confesses her love to Arnold this movie sucked.

1798327,3,B0000714CQ,"Yes, I will admit it, I am 20 and Hey Arnold is one of my all time favorite shows :) It is practically the only good cartoon Nickelodeon still has- they could take away Ren & Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Life, but they're not gonna take away THIS one :)
Believe it or not, this actually IS a really good show- unlike all other crap on Nick these days, this show actually DOES have some meaning behind it- This isn't about a talking sponge or a cat & a dog stuck together,, this show has real-life 4th graders with the type of problems that high school kids have, ie: family problems, relationship problems, problems fitting it,, yep, every episode seems to have a little lesson behind it-and not only that, but the show is also very funny- Being a fan of Family Guy and Clerks you'd think that a Nick cartoon would be the last thing to make me laugh,, well let me tell you,, seeing Euguene fall into a hole and then be well enough to yell out ""I'M OK!"" is just as funny as Stewie yelling ""DAMN YOU ALL! VICTORY IS MINE!"" :)
Anyway on to the movie- This basically was the same thing as the ""Save Mighty Pete"" episode- big corporation wants to tear down the neighborhood, and of course Helga's dad, that arrogant jerk ""Big Bob Pataki"" joins in... and then Arnold & etc do everything they can to stop it... Yea, u can kinda tell what was gonna happen easily...
Also, Euguene wasn't in the movie enough(He's my all time favorite character,, but well his little ""singing"" part WAS hillarious :), and Curly wasn't in it, my other favorite character, or Chocolate Boy, haha :)
All in all not a bad movie,, but I'll definitley take the show over it anyday
Give Hey Arnold a shot if you've never watched it- It's a very funny and realistic show, and well it's really not part of all the ""new nicktoons""- it's been on since like 1997",1071273600,16,1820,4.355882352941176

Arnold is a funny looking kid with a big football shaped head, his eyes are on his forehead and his mouth is on his cheeks (it switches from right to left cheek).. it's all part of his character. He's also got a heart of gold, and always looks on the bright side. That's why he makes it his job to save his land marked neighborhood, and with the help of his best friend(s) Gerald and split personality Helga the 3 assure a happy ending for fans of the show. The movie uses skits from films like ""Speed"", ""Men in Black"", ""Shawshank Redemption"" (to name a few) to move things along and keep it exciting.",1065657600,,764,4.239726027397261

1798330,2,B0000714CQ,"yea yea I'll admit it, I'm 18 & I'll admit that I like Hey Arnold- this isn't like any other stupid shows on Nickelodeon these days(can someone please explain ""The Fairly OddParents""?????) (well i guess u cant really mix this show in with the recent additions- its been around since like 1997 or so)- this show is actually very REALISTIC. Arnold & co. might only be in 4th grade but they face things that high schoolers face. and on top of that, this show is just,, funny. For someone who watches South Park, Crank Yankers, and The Dave Chapelle Show you're probably thinking that a Nickelodeon cartoon would be the last thing I'd get a kick out of, but well, I do :)
Ok ok onto the movie- I never saw it in theaters, so I watched it on On-Demand: ehh, it was, ok, nothing that great. Curly wasn't in it(u won't know who he is unless ur a big fan), hes my favorite, and Euguene wasn't in it enough!!(my other favorite). and, i didn't like how Helga said that she didn't really mean it after she really told Arnold that she loves him- ??? and I just found Helga's dad to be, annoying. and yes i cant disagree that the plot was predictable, but well, its a Nickelodeon show, how unpredictable can they make it?
so overall, if u really like Hey Arnold its worth at least giving a watch and u can decide for yourself- This movie wasn't HORRIBLE,, but I'd definitley prefer watching the show over this.
If you're reading this and you've never watched Hey Arnold before, I think you should really give it a shot- its not like any other stupid Nick shows- It's really funny and realistic.",1057017600,2,1581,4.399317406143345
1798331,3,B0000714CQ,"Hey Arnold!:The Movie is rather disappointing considering it is nothing like the TV series itself. The TV series was successful in many ways, one of the most important being its realism unlike other shows where characters and fictional people are able to achieve phenomenal, humanly impossible tasks. Unlike the series, such things as these occur in the movie, whereas basically three 9 year old fourth graders drive a bus, jump an opening in a concrete overpass, and save a neighborhood from destruction, among other things. Besides this, many of the other lesser-known characters by people not too familiar with the show, but who play a major role in the plot (especially for the show's bigger fans) have no role in the movie at all. They may appear in a seen or two, maybe even get lucky enough to have a line or two said.
 Last but definitely not least, the main theme of the story since the episode first aired 7+ years ago was Helga's secret, obsessive love for Arnold. I, among others, feel that the confession of her love to Arnold in the movie was not only in the wrong place at the wrong time, but also the reaction of Arnold at the end of the movie (as well as his immediate reaction) and how they both pretend nothing happened was not really how many of the fans of the show really wanted to see it turn out, after some had been waiting seven years to be able to witness Helga's confession to Arnold. Despite all this, I cannot give this movie a review of less than 3 stars, as I still love Hey Arnold! deeply and could never rate anything from both the show or even the movie less than that.",1056067200,3,1604,4.474402730375426

Like alot of the movies that I look forward to they mostly end up bad but not Hey Arnold. Hey Arnold was as charming as it looked like it was gonna be. The plot was engrossing and even the animation looked as if it were an old cartoon classic.
The Plot:When a bigshot corprate agent buys the neighborhood to want to knock it down to make a big mall it's up to Arnold the saw the neighborhood and the people who live in it. Helga who has had a love for Arnold ever since she first met him decides to secretly help him out as Deep Voice. She becomes Deep Voice after learning that the town is a national landmark but there is a lost document that declares it a landmark. She learns it is locked in a safe deposit box and gives Arnold anonymous infomation. Will Arnold and Gerald find the document and save the neighborhood?

1798367,4,B0000714CQ,"As has been noted, this isn't a bad flick at all - if you're a fan, that is.
Yes, the movie's animation needed work, but until Nickelodeon flip-flopped mid project and shifted what was intended to be a 'Nick Flick' television premiere into a theatrical release everything was sailing along quite nicely.
Given, a lot of reviewers have shown a bit of distaste, to put it mildly, for the manner in which the film evolved, and the fact that the characters were underdeveloped. But the truth is this was a movie made for those of us who were all ready familiar with the show's workings and the character's motivations.
Having originally been designed as a TV Movie it was probably intended to run during, or at the end of, a marathon of the show's more noteworthy episodes, which would have brought any latecomers up to speed.
All in all, even for those who haven't seen the show, the plot was decent, the animation was okay, and the voice actors, as usual, did a very good job - nothing great though, right?
That is, unless you, like myself, are a fan of the show because of the righteous jazz music, wacky local scenery (a juxtaposition of Seattle [skyline], New York [P.S.*** school system] Chicago [old brownstones], etc.), and the instances of magic realism evidenced throughout the series.
It's great the way Bartlett and the rest of the writers/artists on the show managed to draw out and make wonderful again those things we, as adults, often take for granted.
Like urban legends, school plays, holidays - even the local lunatic who, upon close inspection, isn't quite so much creepy as interesting and mysterious.
Basically, it's not perfect, but yeah, I dig.",1027209600,2,1664,4.7612456747404845

1798369,4,B0000714CQ,"I am on 21 years old and don't watch very much TV, let alone Nickelodean but there are a few shows on Nick that I do regularly watch. The ones shows that I watch are: Wild ThornBerries, Spongebob & Hey Arnold!. These are the few that I actually like. Out of all 3,  Hey Arnold! is probably my favorite.
  When I heard about the movie a few months back I very stoked about it, but also afraid that I would be dissapointed since the vast majority of cartoons that become movies, usually are not very good.
So I steeled myself and went to see the movie and I was only slightly dissapointed.
The basic plot of the movie is this:  A big time corporation is trying to bulldoze Arnold's entire neighborhood to build a giant shopping mall.  Arnold not standing for this does whatever he can ( along with his friend Gerald.)  to keep Sheck the leader of the corp from bulldozing their neighborhood.
The movie starts out kind of slow, but once it gets past the first half hour, the movie begins to really pick up & doesn't slow down until the movie is over.
There is plenty of humor in it and some of the funniest parts are when it's ripping on other movies as well as other things.  Some of the younger audiences might not get some of them but since I'm 21 years old I was able to understand most of them.
My personal favorite part had to be when they rip on the Incredible Hulk.  I laughed harder at that part more than any other point in the movie.
the only real problem with this movie is that people that haven't ever watched the TV show probably won't know who most of the characters are.

For one, Arnold is always the optimist, showing kids to look on the bright side because ""Somebody has to.""  The kids all band together despite differences for a common cause.  Despite almost impossible odds, Arnold, Gerald and even, yes, Helga do their best to persevere and save their neighborhood.
