I recommend this movie.",1090022400,7,176,4.205882352941177
789003,5,6304089112,"My kids and I thought this movie was fantastic.  We watched it right after watching the first movie.  After viewing this film my and 8 & 6 year olds were pretending to be the characters in the film, playing with our own dogs and cats.  Wholesome family movie. Highly recommended.",1076803200,4,279,4.54
789004,5,6304089112,"I loved the video.  it was great, not as warm as HB1 but still good.  Chance as usual not willing to follow orders and stay in his traveling box to Canada, runs out of the plane, forcing Sassie and Shadow to chase after him.  They all wind up in San Francisco.  They get rescued by some feral dogs from a couple of mean dogs.  Chance falls in love with a dog.  2 dirtylooking mean guys roam around in a red truck catching animals until near the end when the ferals and the trio swamp them.  One funny scene had Chance trapped in the red van with other dogs and Sassie on the outside telling him to admit ""Cats Rule"" in order to be freed.  There was a scene where the 2 guys accidentally throw a cigarette at a house which causes a fire and so Shadow goes in to save a little boy and Sassie goes in to save the boy's kitten--this is the same boy that Sassie had tried to beg some food from earlier but Chance had ruined her chances by showing up. funny.  It was a really funny, nice, fast video.  Shadow as usual was his old and wise self.",1076803200,12,1038,4.068965517241379
789005,4,6304089112,"My kids have watched this one a lot, but they seem to ask for the first more often.  If you are only buying one today, go with the first movie.",1055980800,,143,3.7666666666666666
789006,4,6304089112,"Once again a sequel to cash in on the fame of its predecessor.  Although entertaining I found this film lacked a valid story line.  It seemed like they made up the story as they went along.
It took me awhile to get used to Ralph Waite as the voice of the older dog Shadow who replaced the late Don Ameche from the first film.
However, my 7 year old daughter enjoyed this film more than the two before it (the original and the remake).  Go figure.  She probably would of rated this a 5 and I would give it a 3, hence the 4 star rating.
It is a good family film, one that you can let your children watch if you can't be in the same room with them.",1043712000,2,645,3.9384615384615387
789007,5,6304089112,"This one is quite similar to the first. The owners go on a camping trip to Canada and they are gonna take the animals with them, so they are going to fly them there. The animals get loose in the middle of the city. They end up meeting up with a group of stray dogs Chance falls in love with one of them. Will they be able to survive the city?",984096000,4,342,3.8309859154929575

789227,1,6304089112,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

789926,4,6304089112,"This movie is the third movie that Disney has made using the same theme.  The first was 1963's ""The Incredible Journey.""  The second was essentially a remake of the first, ""Homeward Bound.""  In the remake the animals talked rather than having a narration.  This movie capitalizes on the success of the original with a variation on the theme of the original.

This time our three friends, Shadow, a golden retriever, Sassy, a Himalayan cat, and Chance, an American bulldog escape from their cages at San Francisco International Airport, thinking they are going to ""the bad place,"" though they are actually heading for a vacation.  Once their family arrives at their destination, they learn the animals have escaped and arrange to return home to find them.  We see very little of the family after that except to see their concern and a few moments at the end of the movie.

The focus is on the antics of the three critters.  Chance, voiced by Ralph Waite, is always focused on getting home and being safe.  Sassy, voiced by Sally Field, is aloof and sarcastic, taking every advantage of spitting out a one-liner about any particular situation, most especially anything involving Chance.  Chance, voiced by Michael J. Fox, is the oblivious goofball who attempts to interpret everything he sees in his own bizarre, usually wrong, way.  Chance makes a perfect target for Sassy's barbed comments.

We follow the three animals, who really are friends, as they journey through San Francisco, trying to locate the Golden Gate Bridge and the way home.  Along the way they encounter dog thieves looking for laboratory dogs, a fire, mean dogs and friendly dogs who do not understand how these three could want to go back to humans because of the experiences these strays have had with humans.

This story has everything you could want in an adventure story about dogs.  There is love, humor, and a happy, nearly hilarious ending.  While this story is not quite up to par with the original or the remake, it is readily worth watching with the kids more than once, especially if you are looking for an easy laugh.  Even the youngest children in the family will enjoy this one, especially after the brief moments when things look dark for the animals.  Just be prepared to say no when your little ones ask for a puppy or a kitten.  Enjoy!",1151884800,,2323,4.774436090225564
