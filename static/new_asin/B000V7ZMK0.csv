2932814,5,B000V7ZMK0,"The Hogfather, on the Discworld, is what Santa Claus is in the United States. Except it's called ""Hogwatch"" rather than Christmas. All the way back to that red and white, the colors of blood on snow.

The Discworld has Auditors, creatures who loath humanity and all the things that make us human. The Auditors engage the Guild of Assassins to whack the Hogfather, and the Guild designates the very spooky Jonathan Teatime (it's pronounced ""tee-ah-tim-eh""), who hires a gang and methodically sets about this task. It takes Death; Death's granddaughter, Susan; Bilious, the Oh God of Hangovers; most of the wizardly faculty of Unseen University; and the Tooth Fairy to defeat Teatime, his gang and the Auditors.

Because more is at stake than Father Christmas. Belief is what makes us human, where the rising angel meets the falling ape. And if we can't practice on little lies - the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy and the like - we won't be ready for the big lies - that there are such things as truth and justice, and that the sun will rise tomorrow.

The movie is brilliantly cast and acted. The difficult task of turning a Pratchett novel into a screenplay is generally successful, and the sets are simply terrific. Watch for Pratchett himself in a cameo. To paraphrase Pratchett, ""They actually got it right.""

Very highly recommended, and not just for hard core fans of Terry Pratchett.",1199145600,63,1386,4.8354430379746836
2932815,5,B000V7ZMK0,My husband and I stumbled across Hogfather playing on our ION TV station.  We loved it so much I promptly bought it. It looks even better in on DVD. The film is a wonderful adaptation of the book and if you have an attention span longer than a housefly the story is not hard to follow even if you are unfamiliar with the disc world. My husband never read any of the stories and had no problem. Hogfather is truly a departure from the average TV holiday drivel. Terry Pratchett is an original. I'd recommend you read his books also.,1198800000,5,531,4.31
2932816,4,B000V7ZMK0,"While awaiting the release of the Hogfather movie on DVD, I was amazed to run across the movie on the ION cable TV network on 12/23/07.  I too expect that for those not familiar with the Discworld, it may be a little mystifying, but for those of us that are, the little details were wonderful.  I particularly liked the rendition of HEX, complete with the ""Anthill Inside"" sticker and the little hourglass which popped out when it was processing.  Getting a look at actual actors in costume playing Constable Visit and Nobby Nobbs, however briefly, was a treat--in fact, all the costuming and casting was very reminiscent of the way the Discworld is pictured in the Paul Kidby illustrations.  The rendition of Susan and Bilious the Oh God inside the child's painting on their way to the Tooth Fairy's domain was excellent and very much as I had imagined it.  Finally, Terry Pratchett himself makes a cameo appearance as the proprietor of the toy store where Death purchases the wooden horse to give to the young Albert.  This movie really gives me hope for the ""Light Fantastic/Color of Magic"" movie which I understand is in the works--it shows that the Discworld CAN be translated to the live screen.  My only negative criticism is that every time Mr. Teatime spoke with that weird voice of his, I was reminded of the Church Lady on Saturday Night Live--it may be that the actor just didn't understand how this would sound to an American ear.  However, all in all it was a really great effort and no Discworld fan should pass it by.",1198454400,48,1533,4.651851851851852
2932817,4,B000V7ZMK0,"After much hunting I found this DVD in the US... I wasn't sure what to expect from a live action Discworld movie, I just couldn't imagine that the humor could translate properly.  In the end, it did and it didn't.

A short Summary:

In the fantasy world of Discworld, their winter festival is called Hogswatch, which is ruled over by the Hogfather... a fat jolly man with tusks who doles out gifts to nice little children.  An Assassin is hired to ""take care of"" the Hogfather, and he goes about it by invading the lair of the Toothfairy.  To try to keep the world in order, Death puts on the Hogfather Costume and tries to sub in for the evening... meanwhile, Death's grandaughter, Susan is off to figure out what happened to the Hogfather.

If you have read the book, then you know that you probably laughed so hard you cried.  Though the movie is funny, it is not nearly so as the book.  They remain fairly faithful to the book, cutting only where necessary.  But if you have not read the book... then you will watch this film in puzzlement.  There is a great deal of assumption by the filmmakers that the viewer is already aware of Discworld and how it works.  The opening shot of Great A'tuin with the four elephants is shown but never explained.  The Unseen university is baffling if you don't already know about the wizards, and the Death of Rats makes no sense at all.

But if you HAVE read the book, you will be able to follow quite happily seeing the characters from your head pop into life.

The acting, though theatrical, is wonderful.  The costuming is brilliant and the sets are strange and beautiful.  Susan is a powerful yet likeable character. Death, though his mouth never moves, is one of the most human creatures in the film.  Albert is a scream... you can't help but love him.

Final summary:  If you have read and enjoyed the book, this film is a must-see.  If you have not read the book, then you might enjoy the movie... but you won't ""get"" most of it because of the level of discworld knowledge you are assumed to already have.

Kiddie Rating - I will probably let my kids watch this (ages 6 and 10) there are a few murders but very little blood, and they are not overly graphic.  I didn't catch any profanity on my first watch through, there is of course no nudity.  I would be more concerned of their lack of interest because I'm not sure if they are old enough to comprehend the humor of Death delivering presents dressed as a jolly fat man.",1197417600,147,2469,4.413716814159292

2932862,5,B000V7ZMK0,I've read the book and watched the movie and this is a very good adaption of the book. I love Terry Pratchett's tongue in cheek sense of humor.,1462838400,,143,4.142857142857143
2932863,4,B000V7ZMK0,"I think that most people who watch this will have read the book, and much of their reason for watching will be to see how the actors portrayed their characters.  Michelle Dockery, as Susan, and Mark Warren, as Teatime,  were perfect choices.  Mr. Warren was able to convey the insanity and near invincibility of Teatime, to the point where he was as fearsome a character as he was in the book.  David Jason's performance of Albert is much like I've always pictured the character.

While those three stood out to me, the other characters were also quite good--I want to say I think I would have preferred Christopher Lee as Death, he was so good in the Colour of Magic live action one, as well as the Soul Music animated one, but Ian Richardson's voice was also almost perfect for the part.

To me, the highlights, and what made it worthwhile, were the performances of Ms. Dockery and Mr. Warren. Teatime is one of Sir Terry's more frightening characters, and I thought it would be very hard to do it well, but Mr. Warren succeeded beyond my expectations.

If you aren't familiar with the story, it can be slow moving at times. (Or so it seems to me--having read the book, I can't be sure of that.)  :)

For those who have read the book, it's a pretty faithful adaptation--there are various slight changes, that may have helped it move along a bit more.  There wasn't much laughing out loud for me, (nor was there with the book), but it is Sir Terry Pratchett, so there are always a few brilliant lines.  (And Sir Terry has a cameo).",1460419200,,1532,4.474820143884892

One scene,  I think, was added in, because I didn't care for it, and don't remember it being in the book.  I might have read past it every time; reading Hogfather is one of my Christmas traditions. Watching this may become another.

I would definitely read the book before watching.  I tried explaining much of it to some of my family, who have never read a Discworld story as far as I know, and I don't think they got half of it.

Great casting.  Most of the actresses/actors matched the pictures in my head, especially Banquo.

2932878,5,B000V7ZMK0,"""Hogfather"" is near the top of my list of all-time favorite Discworld novels by the late Terry Pratchett, and this made-for-TV version (2006) leaves out very little (the Good King Wenceslas scene, the Cheerful Fairy and her bluebird (really a chicken) of happiness)).  I watch it every Christmas season.  All of Pratchett's characters are marvelously played.  My favorites are Joss Ackland as Mustrum Ridcully, David Warner as Lord Downey, Peter Guiness as Medium Dave, David Jason as Albert, and Michelle Dockery as Susan.  Terry Pratchett himself makes a cameo appearance as the Toymaker.  Well-known Shakespearean actor, Ian Richardson is the voice of Death (I was sorry to learn he died shortly after ""Hogfather"" was filmed.)

You should probably read the novel before watching the DVD, although the script writers did a good job of drawing the viewers into Discworld, starting with a shot of  Great A'Tuin travelling through space, carrying four giant elephants with the Discworld on their backs.  We are quickly introduced to the meaning of Hogswatch (a holiday very like our own Christmas), and then it's into Lord Downey's office at the Assassin's Guild, where the life-hating Auditors offer the current Master of the Assassins' Guild three million dollars to inhume the Hogfather.

What??? Why would anyone want to kill the Discworld equivalent of Santa Claus???

Read the book and watch this very special adaptation to find out.  The sets of a very Victorian-looking Ankh-Morpork alone are worth the price of the DVD.",1452470400,13,1527,5.191836734693878

The movie is devoid of the clever humor and wonder created by Terry Pratchett, is replaced by a grisly pseudo-terror world that was unpleasent, and even painful to view.  If your a true Pratchett you'll be much better off with ""Going Postal"" which is much more faithful to the book and the Diskworld in general.",1451347200,,453,4.6375

2932882,5,B000V7ZMK0,"There are lots of other reviews that give much of the story in brief. I will just say that this is a great movie. So many movies are wildly untrue to their books and authors - this one is not. It is depicted wonderfully. If you read the book and enjoyed it you will enjoy, and understand, the movie. If you have read other Discworld books but not Hogfather you will enjoy the movie, but the story may be a little hard to follow. If you have never read any Discworld books, the movie may be challenging. But then again, reading the books for the first time is challenging, plotwise. But whatever the case may be, I wholeheartedly recommend the movie for The Holidays. Note that Hogswatch falls on December 32, so that you have an extra week to buy a copy.

 It's a shame when you have to do a lot of work just to try to enjoy a movie!! It really pains me when a DVD company has zero consideration for the people who need CC or Subtitles for various reasons.

2932937,3,B000V7ZMK0,"The most important thing you must know before watching ""Hogfather"" is that if you haven't read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-book-by-Terry-Pratchett/dp/006227628X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the book by Terry Pratchett</a>, you'll be utterly and hopelessly lost. That's what happened to me, and though I managed to grasp some of the basics by the halfway mark, I was still left scratching my head over some of the more quirky aspects of the storyline.

I know that the immediate rebuttal to this is to ""read the book!"" but I don't think that familiarity with source material should be a factor when it comes to watching adaptations. They should be able to stand on their own. I hadn't read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000YMKBWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;when I watched Peter Jackson's film for the first time, but I not only understood exactly what was happening, but enjoyed it immensely. This on the other hand... not so much.

So consider this a review by a non-Pratchett fan, for fellow non-Pratchett fans. Maybe you'll chose to watch it anyway, maybe you'll seek out the book instead, maybe you'll give it a miss. But at least trust me on this: that without foreknowledge of the original novel, you'll probably be as bewildered as I was.

The alternative world known as Discworld, which floats through space on the back of a giant turtle, has several profound differences from our reality - but also a few familiar echoes. Every year the people of the world celebrate Hogswatch, a festival in which a large jolly man delivers presents during the night to children everywhere. Only this year, a group of hooded specters have approached the Guild of Assassins with a new commission: to kill the Hogfather.

The plot that follows - at least from what I could fathom - involves the job being handed over to a creepy glass-eyed assassin known as Mr Teatime (pronounced te-a-time-ee) who decides that the best way to kill the Hogfather is to break into the castle of the Tooth Fairy, using all the teeth that are stored there to perform a spell that tampers with the minds of the children that they once belonged to. If they don't believe in the Hogfather, then he loses all his power.

But with the Hogfather unable to perform his annual duties, a very unexpected substitute takes his place: none other than Death himself. With a fake beard over his skeletal face and a pillow stuffed up under his robes, he actually does a fairly decent job, satirizing some of the most saccharine Christmas platitudes along the way. Stopping Mr Teatime is a task that falls to Death's grand-daughter Susan, posing as a governess but possessing a few magical gifts of her own.

As it stands, I've no idea why the cloaked specters wanted the Hogfather dead in the first place, or what the point of several befuddled wizards in a lengthy subplot was all about. And before you give me the answers in the comment box - I'm sure the book had very good reasons for the existence of all these things. My problem is that the miniseries doesn't.

But the biggest problem was pacing. For a miniseries that's made up of two one-and-a-half hour episodes (which encompass the course of a single night), things move *achingly* slowly, with scenes that seem to drag on forever. One scene has Susan watching over the two young children in her care - she enters the room, kisses each of them in turn, and then leaves again. It takes forty-three seconds to depict what decent editing could have conveyed in just five, and it's one example of the achingly tedious string of scenes that show characters walking to and fro, looking at things, staring thoughtfully into the middle-distance, or doing banal everyday things that any sensible director would have cut out completely. There's simply no energy or urgency at all.

Among the actors are a few familiar faces. Michelle Dockery (in a pre-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B0047H7QD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>&nbsp;role) plays the droll Susan, whilst Marc Warren is the creepy antagonist Teatime. Ian Richardson lends his voice in a surprisingly fitting portrayal of Death, with David Jason as his assistant Alfred (complete with fake pointy ears). David Warner and Tony Robinson have roles which barely warrant cameos, but make the most of them.

In a nutshell, it's the talent of the actors versus the uninspiring direction and sluggish pacing. They recite their lines with as much gusto as they're able, but they've seemingly been given no direction at all. For example, Marc Warren plays Teatime with a spooky childish lilt, but the direction fails to convey him with any sort of menace. When he kills people, it's so predictable and perfunctory that it saps all the suspense out of it.

So there you have it non-book readers: it's confusing. After doing a bit of research, I learnt that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hogfather/dp/006227628X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hogfather</a>&nbsp;is actually the twentieth book in the Discworld series, and the fourth one that has Death in a central role, so there's a good chance that even if I *had* sought out the book first, I may not have understood that either. It was always going to be a difficult story to adapt, but if anything, at least it was sufficiently intriguing that I'm now inclined to seek out Terry Pratchett's work. Having done that, I may be able to return to ""Hogfather"" with renewed appreciation.",1394582400,,5653,5.299107142857143

Disc set, on the other hand is a generous 3/5 stars. Set includes film on two discs rather than one, which means there's an annoying disc change period when playing as one movie.

Those who are familiar with Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels will already know about this, as well as the wizards of Unseen University, and Death and his granddaughter, Susan.  A great cast was assemble for the movie, including Michelle Dockery of ""Downtown Abbey"" and Ian Richardson of ""House of Cards"" as the voice of Death.

Based on the book of the same name by Terry Pratchett in his iconic Discworld this story has great heart and humor (which is witty and subtle so if you don't like that kind of humor, move along) but has important messages about faith and family. This movie, along with Neil Gaiman's Death graphic novels, changed my opinion on the subject of Death. Here, Death is, literally and figuratively, a grandfather figure who shows more humanity than some of the other living characters in the story. Quite frankly, if the real Death is anything like the stern but caring and unknowingly funny Terry Pratchett version or gothically-dressed but eternally perky and optimistic young woman as envisioned by Neil Gaiman then when it's my time to go I won't feel so bad. :-)",1360886400,,943,4.585798816568047

2932987,2,B000V7ZMK0,"This came up on Netflix as something I might like, so I watched it. I had no idea it was after a book.

If you like Steampunk, you will love Discworld, the country in which the story takes place, sort of a late 19th century place with a computer that writes with a pen and ink. The basic story is that a bunch of ""universe auditors"" decide that human beings have too many fantasies and false beliefs, and so Hogfather--a Santa Claus type character--has to go. A weird assassin goes after him by trying to destroy all the belief in him.

However, in steps Death (I kid you not) and his granddaughter, played by Michelle Dockery (Lady Mary in the Downton Abbey series). She and her grandfather save the day, of course, though there are a lot of weird meandering story lines having to do with the tooth fairy and a bunch of wizards to get through. If you like CGI and special effects, you might love this. The details and the costumes are really quite fantastic.

I wouldn't let young children watch Hogfather; they may be confused about the similarities to Christmas and there is a lot of killing going on. A large swipe is taken at social inequality and the fact that life's not fair; in fact, Death has a short soliloquy on the lack of justice and mercy in the world. If this fits into your views, you may like it more than I did. Oh, and there are a million false endings, too, which became very tedious.

Other reviewers complained about the pacing. I found it very slow, as well. I also got a bit confused when the story jumped around in time. Or so it seemed.

This movie was only ok. Style over substance. Maybe I will read the book!",1356652800,,1638,4.357377049180328

The acting is superb, and features many well-known British character actors. It's a little on the long side, clocking in at slightly less than 3 hours!

The very best thing: Teatime!

No movie adaptation is ever quite as good as the book on which it is based, but this one comes awfully close. If you don't know who (or what) the Auditors are, you probably won't get it here. Their pursuit of the boar, with Death and Susan riding to the rescue didn't have the nail-biting tension of the book. In fact, that whole how-the-legend-grew sequence was a bit flat. I found myself wishing it would hurry up and finish so I could watch Susan throw the poker through Death and into Teatime. And then she did and it was great!

I can't say enough how good of a job they did with this movie and I truly think any fan of Terry Pratchet will be as excited as I am.

I'll try and give a brief synopsis and not ruin any twists.

When the Cosmic Auditors decide that the Disc World would be much better off without all of the messy holidays they hire the Assasins Guild to put the Hogfather on ice permanently.  Death himself steps in to make sure all of the Disc's children still get their presents while his reluctant grand-daughter has to once again step into his duties.  Susan must use all of her skills to save the holidays, and the Disc, and stop the evil plot.

Pratchett's Discworld Santa Claus is a man-pig in a Santa suit, complete with tusks, and he is the target of Rationalist Auditors from outer space who want to destroy everything that people accept on faith, especially the legends that children believe in. Mixed into this plot are Death, who takes the place of the Hogfather, a vicious assassin named Mr. Teatime (Pronounced ""Tay-uh-TIE-me"")and the heroine, Death's granddaughter Susan,(Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery, wielding a big sword). Pratchett himself plays a small part in the goings-on. This is three hours long but filled with the kind of fast-paced throw-away lines and sight gags that make British comedy a joy to watch - it's an SF squivalent of ""A Christmas Story,"" riding the backs of elephants who stand on top of a turtle like Discworld itself.",1326672000,,1013,4.9298245614035086
2933006,4,B000V7ZMK0,"I really need to read the book to see what the problems are that the other reviewers mentioned. To me, if one pays attention, one should have little trouble figuring out the movie.

I enjoyed the portrayal of Death stumbling through the role of 'Santa Claus'.

The actress portraying Death's daughter was a bit flat but passable.

I didn't understand some of Deaths actions in the sand library.

The only real annoyance was Mr. Teatime. Not sure if he was supposed to get on your nerves but he got on mine. The voice acting of Mr. Teatime was dreadful. He sounded like a man from England trying to be American. And maybe it was part of his character in the book but he kept correcting people with different pronunciations of his name ""tee-uh-tar-may"", ""tee-uh-tie-may"", ""tee-uh-tar-mee"", ""tee-uh-tie-mee"".

The movie did feel rushed (which would make sense if things were indeed left out from the book) but I still liked it enough to watch it twice this Christmas.",1325721600,,964,4.783132530120482

Adults can find the underlying themes in everything from the tooth fairy's castle to the way wizards climb the corporate tree of wizardry.

Children will enjoy the victories against the monsters under the bed.

Then of course there's death, complete with scythe, and an unbelievably dry but spectacular sense of humor coupled to a very soft spot for his rather nice grandaughter.

A movie from a book that contains almost every nuance you might care to look for, or one that can simply be enjoyed as an alternative christmas story that's no more fundamentally frightening for the little ones than ""a christmas carol"".

As near as I can tell, without rereading the book, its as close as you can get to that as possible. Fools in the good old US should take a clue from the Brits on this stuff, and stop mangling other people's good works.

Mind.. nothing in the US is ever exact anyway. Ever hear of, ""based on a true story"", here is a hint - it means some clown told a short, information free, story over a cup of tea, some other clown, that specializes in that sort of stuff, wrote a book on it, embellishing it out of all sense of the original, then Hollywood got hold of it, and promptly mangled it so badly that even the people that told the original wouldn't claim recognition of it, if they where not being payed royalties for both the original, and subsequent manglings of their half a paragraph of made up nonsense.

And this is what happens with ""true stories"", which often never actually happened. When they got hold of something actually honestly labeled fiction...

So, yeah, Hollywood badly needs to look at some of the stuff being done, like Hogfather, and get a clue how to actually write screen plays, based on original works. This DVD edition has all of the fun, satire, etc. of the original, and who wouldn't love mister Tee-ah-tim-ee. lol",1301011200,,1330,4.442622950819672

For the first time since ""Bill and Ted's Totally Bogus Journey,"" Death has a major role in the story and it's not the bad guy's side of the tale.

For Terry Pratchett literary fans, this is a real treat and for non fans this is still a major treat.  To enter into Disc World and learn another culture that has similarities and differences is always entertaining.

While not a ""Fluffy Bunny"" story, I feel comfortable saying that all but the very youngest of children will likely enjoy watching along with the rest of the family.

Admittedly, my sense of humor tends toward silliness with an underlying grain of truth. Hogfather fits my tastes like a glove! It is exceedingly rare that that any author can make me feel that way I did the first time I read Douglas Adams' ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" Terry Pratchett has that power. It is far more rare that this magic can  effectively be brought to the screen. Hogfather does that! I don't disagree with others who feel that the book isn't fully represented... nor in my opinion were Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Roots, or even Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments. In that same way, I highly recommend Hogfather as a shinning star of its genre.

It's the story of Susan Sto Helit, governess to a wealthy family with two youngsters who would make Mary Poppins swear. It's holiday time in the Discworld, where magic is an everyday occurrence and anthropomorphic personifications are real--Death, for example, is a walking, talking 7-foot skeleton with long black cloak, scythe, and a pale horse (Binky is his name).  He happens to be Susan's grandfather, and while he takes the place of the Hogfather (their equivalent to Santa Claus), it's up to Susan to find the Hogfather and rescue him from whatever predicament he has encountered.

2933028,2,B000V7ZMK0,"I've been a huge Terry Pratchett fan for years and was thrilled to realize they'd come out with a live-action film. After the less-than-perfect animations, I'd been hoping actors could put a spin on the material that would not only follow the books faithfully (which all the films, animated and live do) but also capture that strange humor that makes the books so amazing. So I bought Hogfather back when it wasn't yet available for rent on region 2 just to see it. Did it perform as hoped?
Hmm. Not so much. I blame mostly the pacing. For some reason, and this applies to Colour of Magic too (though I'm praying not to the upcoming Going Postal that has a new director) the film just plods along from sequence to sequence with no feeling of continuity or punctuation. Also, Pratchett's hilarious lines and slapstick situations are based on a very solid connection to our own reality and without that recognition and bleed-through, the jokes are not very funny. Since they never explain the details of the Discworld, newcomers are left floating in uncertainty; no connection, no funny. Also, while I felt Susan was very well played and some of the other characters done well enough, the portrayal of Teatime as Johnny Depp's Willie Wonka--almost a direct rip-off--was so distracting and annoying I flinched everytime he was on screen. He's on screen a lot. He's only occasionally menacing and for a lead villian to be annoying instead of dangerous has a way of sapping the urgency out of a film.
That and the pacing. Geez, it dragged on. The sets and costumes are brilliant but many of the FX are super cheesy, reminding us this was made for TV. The slow strange timing of the script and editing made the cheesy extremely obvious as you sat there for a few seconds wondering what came after a line was delivered and nothing did but you staring at something that should've been shaved closer to the action. The action is...not exciting. Editing and pacing. Sucks. Same goes for Colour of Magic, by the way.",1266710400,5,2005,4.715099715099715

Unlike ""Avatar's"" amazing 3-D imagery, but 2-D characters and the same tired old recycled gratuitous cliche lefty plot (that was a mouthful) this movie has amazing 3-D characters coupled with a stupendously funny, yet deeply sublime plot and very top of the line (2-D) CGI effects (this movie would be great even without the ""eye candy"" effects.) Mr. Tea Time oozes evil from every pore, Death's granddaughter displays a quiet and resigned strength that draws the attention, while the skull masked death portrays more depth of character and likability than I've seen in quite a long while.  The premise of Death having to stand in for this world's version of Santa Claus (because there's a hit out on him) in order to save the holiday [Christmas] is absolutely priceless. Don't forget to bring your umbrella for raining ""Tooth Fairy"" castle guard corpses.

Hollyweird take note, this is the future of entertainment: the author, Terry Pratchett is a genius, and I understand that the movie does not stray from the book (I haven't read it yet [note to self: put in cart] but I've read his ""Monstrous Regiment"" and particularly enjoyed it, partly from being an old NCO myself coupled with the wry humor and surprise ending.)",1263513600,,1285,4.863013698630137

The casting was truly awful and the movie had none of the dry humour that is the driving force behind Pratchett's books. Teatime, Susan and Ridcully were portrayed so badly that I only got about 1/2 an hour into before I was forced to turn it off. Why is it that whenever anyone makes a fantasy movie, the acting is always so corny? The humour in the books stands up quite well without the need for overacting. Next time someone makes one of these movies it would be refreshing indeed if they directed it the same way one would direct any modern comedy or even a serious drama and not the way one would direct a high school musical. Obviously I am in a minority and though I am a huge Pratchett fan I can't recommend this movie to anyone.",1259280000,8,830,4.326923076923077
2933035,5,B000V7ZMK0,"If Santa was a Dungeons and Dragons addict, this is what Christmas would be like. ""Hogfather"" is a clever satire that takes place on the parallel planet of Discworld. In Discworld Santa's counterpart is the Hogfather, the porcine gift giver of Hogswatch employing a sleigh pulled by flying boars. To set up the conflict for the film ""The Auditors"" have employed the ultra-creepy Mr. Teatime from the Guild of Assassins to eliminate the Hogfather. The following story involves a truly bizarre cast of characters such as the Tooth Fairy, who proves crucial to the plot, and the Hair Loss Fairy, which will amuse more adults than children. Ultimately Death becomes involved as a fill-in Hogfather, becomes emotionally involved in the Hogswatch concept and has some great lines (""I don't normally care if they've been naughty or nice."") Death is discouraged only by the the waning of belief in the Hogfather, but sets to visit the whole world in one night via a ""special congruent reality"" and in the process undergoes several interesting trials, ultimately becoming a very endearing character.

Along the way there are many great scenes that adults will relish even more than kids, such as the gig as a department store Hogfather (""And what do you want for Hogswatch, small human?"") and the backstory that the job as Hogfather started as an animal sacrifice to make the sun come up, but currently involves giving out presents as a result of industrial retraining. The story makes reference to many human myths (Discworld exists in space atop four giant elephants standing on a giant turtle) and has strange magical and mystical elements that are quite surreal for a movie nominally aimed at children: children's teeth become amazingly powerful and there's a great scene with a wizard in detox (I especially liked the legend ""Born to Rune"" on the back of the wizard's cape).

After discovering that the Tooth Fairy is actually a franchise operation and dealing with a subplot about a creature that removes socks from the laundry, ""an eater of socks"", who looks like a possessed pangolin, we progress to an ever stranger battle for Discworld's future with swordplay and a scissor monster, ultimately dispensing just rewards to Mr. Teatime and righting the world for all. Throughout the film the dialogue is great (""Hi inner child; I'm the inner babysitter."") and enjoyable by kids and adults alike, even though kids will not understand all of the nuances. The conclusion is quite complex and odd, involves a boar and dog chase (the boar is the primeval Hogfather), the Tooth Fairy turns out to be a shapeshifting boogieman, and the Snowman of Death closes the movie out with the quote ""Now there is one final question: have you been naughty or nice?"" Pretty trippy stuff for a kid's Christmas movie: I loved it.

The film features several extras including an interesting but odd interview with author Terry Pratchett who has written over thirty books in the Discworld series. The film has no nudity, I didn't notice any offensive language, but there are several murders (which are largely cartoonish) which makes this better for slightly older children. The other thing that might dissuade parents from showing it to younger kids is the fact that it's three hours long. It actually has an intermission, so viewings on two consecutive nights might work very well. This is a great and very different Christmastime movie, and I recommend it.",1259020800,4,3433,4.977351916376307
2933036,5,B000V7ZMK0,"I am a huge Pratchett fan.  I heard that some of his novels have been made into movies, I orginally reacted with dread.  Most often so much is edited or poorly acted it is not even a shadow of the original, and then a great book becomes something abhorent.
But this movie looses nothing.  They take the rich literary world of the DiscWorld and make it come to life.  It brings the book to life in a wonderful way without loosing any of the flavor and charm of the original.
Pro's.
It is not only well acted, but parts of the book that are purely literary (internal monologues, emotional overplay) are well translated without words.
Death is in it.
Budget is not spared on props and effects, it is easy to believe this is a whole world.
It provides new insight into the book, IE, you see it through another persons interpretation.
It is my new holiday classic.
Oh yeah, it has Death in it...

Con's.
Only two, and I don't even see them that big a deal.  First it is long, over 3 hours.  This is not surprising, because why should a book that takes days to ready only take an hour to act out?
And the other con is that it will be hard not to have your own internal visualizations of each character changed.  It is hard not to see their Nobby Nobbs and not have that actor pop into your head every time you read about him from now on.  But this is part of the ""Seeing another persons interpretation.

2933038,4,B000V7ZMK0,"If this DVD had not included the 20 minute interview with Mr Pratchett I would have rated it 5 Stars.

But the interview is there and cannot understand why the DVD company allowed it.

The lighting and camera work are spot on, but the editing was clearly done by a drunk, the interviewer was not listening to the answers because she was busy trying to think up her next unrelated question, and the sound technician probably only had one ear, and that one badly infected because the sound levels were all over the place.

If this was handed in as a class assignment in a first year journalism course it would result the student transferred over to Plumbing and Sewage Maintenance 101.

There is one section of this interview where for some reason Mr Pratchett is asked to repeat a rather long answer which is a fine and standard video interview technique. But one one ever leaves BOTH versions in the finished product.

There are edits in the middle of questions, bits hacked off the front and rear of questions and answers, wild jump-cut edits of Mr Pratchett, and a complete lack of professionalism by leaving in the bits where Mr Pratchett had to clean his nose.

Normally when someone does a video or film interview, extra shots are taken at different angles of both the interview subject and the interviewer, the room, all sorts of stuff in fact so the editor can work around miscues, mistakes, unflattering images, camera zoom repositions, and generally give the whole thing a decent polish.  None of that was done here.  It was just raw, pants down around the ankles, video interview hoovering.

The only thing that can explain this train wreck of an interview is an incompetent decision by the DVD Producer to cram the thing onto the disc when in fact it wasn't meant to be played in its complete form.

In thinking about it, I believe that the original interview was part of a marketing or promotional session and was meant to be chopped up into sound bites or clips. The interviewer's questions were never designed to be used and that explains the faint, down a tunnel, sound quality of them.

I suspect that the DVD producer, with no knowledge of video editing, came across the chopped up interview in an edit suite and decided to hammer and nail the various sections back together without watching or listening to the resulting horror.

A lot of the humor that I loved in the Hogfather book didn't sit well with me in this movie... mostly came out as cheesy.  If I were a child, it might seem silly and funny, but I found it cheesy.  I might've actually cringed at some scenes.

Another reason I didn't care so much for the movie is that it's over 3 hours long.  I think I read the book faster than that.  If you're getting this movie for your kid, good luck getting them to sit through it.  Parts that I remembered in the book as being very good were transformed in this movie as parts that dragged on and on.  I needed it to be faster paced, I suppose.

I got this movie because I needed my Terry Pratchett ""fix"" until I could get my hands on the next book of his, but this movie version of the Hogfather didn't deliver.

It's remarkably faithful to the book, which is good, but somehow the humor that in reading Pratchett, causes me to periodically have to put the book down and take a belly-laugh break, just doesn't come through on the screen for the most part.

I liked the actress who plays Susan, though I think her performance could have been stronger.  The set design of the movie is beautiful, they obviously went to great expense to get this part of it right.

Ultimately I think where it went awry was with the two strongest supporting characters-- it seemed like they kind of 'cheaped out' on Death.  He looked very much like the kind of cheap plastic skeleton costume you can get for 29.95 at the fly-by-night Halloween costume store.  I realize there are limits to how much expressiveness you can expect from a skeleton, but I just needed to see a little more from Death even if were just in body language, than the ability to wink his blue LED eyes.

And the actor playing the Teatime character-- it was interesting in that descriptively, he was more or less faithful to how the character was written.  But expressively?  Somehow every mannerism that was intended to convey danger and menace in the book translated to whiny and annoying in the movie.  The actor just didn't manage to find what was needed to convey Teatime's essence effectively, and the weird contact lenses just didn't help a bit.

The Auditors were, quite literally, nonentities.  Ultimately what was needed was missing.  This movie needed strong, dynamic, menacing villains and some sense of menace from Death as well.  Instead they were flat, unintimidating and not all that interesting.  Without a real sense of menace and conflict, the movie rested on the backs of the rest of the cast and ultimately it winds up feeling like a poorly done full-dress rehearsal.  They're all dressed up and on the set, and they're reading their lines faithfully, but the feeling and the spirit of the book is completely missing in action.

Discworld is full of rich and colorful characters.  There are the Wizards, the Watch, the Witches, DEATH (DEATH speaks in all capital letters.)and many more.

This story has it's basis in Christmas except that the Hogfather is a wild boar with tusks.  He delivers toys and gifts to children in Discworld on a night called Hogswatch.  When an assassin, by way of the Tooth Fairy, makes the Hogfather mysteriously disappear, DEATH has to take over the job.  Imagine a skeleton dressed up in a Santa suit!  And the hilarity ensues.  DEATH's granddaughter, Susan, takes over his duties and has to track down the Hogfather.  If she doesn't, the entire belief system will be thrown into chaos.

The Hogfather brings to life the Discworld and it's characters.  It is true to the book and how you would imagine the characters.  If you haven't read the series then please do.  You might have a little trouble understanding some of the origins of the story if not. This movie will get you hooked on the series.  I would highly recommend this movie and series to all readers.

How could a film possibly show all the bizarre inventions and characters? I was absolutely delighted with the Hogfather!!! I saw it on TV, and immediately looked for a way to purchase it; and BTW, I purchase  about 1 movie every few years; I'm not a collector of movies. But I found The Hogfather to be extremely true to the book (a rare occurance!); and since there was no way to condense it down to 2 hours, the movie is about 4 hours long. Plan to be entertained, enlightened, delighted, and regaled for a nice long evening.
For those who have not read the book, Pratchett weaves a multi-layered tale with many characters doing seemingly separate things, in a fantasy world, which is remarkably like ours, under the veneer of fantasy. His stories are a tongue in cheek commentary on us, presented in a way that we can see oursleves and laugh.

2933058,1,B000V7ZMK0,"First, let me say I have read and love all the Terry Pratchett books in the Discworld series. They all have a certain `British innocent cadence' to them.

The reviewers who wowed this pig evidently never read the books.

This film does NO justice. The lines are so poorly timed, and so poorly, well, delivered, they absolutely suck. Second graders could have done better. I blame the director for ruining them. The film portrays the story as a serious fantasy. The book is a COMEDIC fantasy, so full of puns and inept characters you wonder how they survive. It has undertones satirizing the British social structure. None of this is in the movie. Hilarious lines from the book are delivered seriously instead of off-handed. Lines that should have been said with humor, are spoken flat and without any sense of TIMING.

The only character that fit was Nigel Planer (watch `The Young Ones DVDs. They are astoundingly hilarious).

Instead of the character `Death' being confused and mystified by the idiosyncrasies of humans (in the books), he is filmed as a serious character with few foibles. In the book, his granddaughter, is constantly flustered by humans, but does her best to fit in. In the film, she is serious, and played without a bit of character. And again, her `comedic' remarks made in the book, are delivered as serious. So her satirical lines are totally lost. This was a worse translation to film than `A Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy' (which actually had a better script).

One of the problems is the book is one of the later in the series. So there were no prior films setting up the viewer for the totally absurd world Pratchett created. And the world he created was hilarious.

The whole point of this book was to satirize Santa Claus and our commercially instilled beliefs in fictional deities. Instead, they are all made out to be a serious characters (a la `Legend' and all the `Frosty The Snowman' tv shows). Hollywood making another Christmas story for the masses...

Jason Warren portrays Mr Teatime (pronounced Tee-a-tim-ee). He is an aspiring Assassins Guild member. In the book, his chosen profession is treated with cynicism. The film makes him a serious villain.

The ONLY redeeming factor in this fiasco, are the Wizards. They are properly shown as inept, and without courage. Their various wacky inventions and spells (which never work), are ALMOST brought out. Unfortunately, their roles were minimized, and acted woodenly, with no inspiration. If they were the best part, imagine how bad the rest is....

Pass on this dog. Read the books PLEASE! Terry Pratchett is a gifted writer. The film needed to be presented in a Monty Pythonesque fashion. `Death' should have been acted like the `Death' in the last scene of Meaning of Life. After all, if you read the books, you would know HE  was written that way.

If you are a Pratchett fan, avoid this like the plague.",1229990400,13,2898,4.82258064516129

2933060,4,B000V7ZMK0,"I haven't yet read any of Terry Pratchett's ""Discworld"" books but this treatment makes me want to.  Based on what I've read on other sites and the interview with Terry Pratchett on the disc, it follows the book very closely.
It's very long and detailed and made in a typical BBC style that may remind you a little bit of Dr. Who or other BBC fantasy series.
The story is very involved and includes: a shadowy group of beings (The Auditors) that monitor humanity and attempt to influence it, an Assasins Guild which employs the creepiest character I have seen in a long time--Mr. Teatime (it's not pronounced the way you think it is), and a Univesity of wizards that provides most of the laughs.  We also meet Death and his granddaughter, Susan; the ""Oh, God"" of Hangovers; Mr. Teatime's gang of thugs with names like ""Banjo"" and ""Medium Dave""; and Violet, a Tooth Fairy (it's a franchise).
There are a good number of laughs but the overall tone is fairly serious and there are some tense moments that are resolved in a satisfying way.
If you watch this, give it your full attention and take a break at the intermission; it's quite long.  Pratchett has something to say about the nature of Belief and provides real food for thought along with engaging drama and some good laughs.
The only criticism I have is that captions would have been nice; it would help us Americans understand when the accents get a little thick.",1229558400,,1418,4.596837944664031
2933061,5,B000V7ZMK0,"This film is based on a novel of the same title by Terry Pratchett as part of his ongoing Discworld series. I've read the novel, along with a fair number of other Discworld books, so I might have some trouble addressing those who haven't.

The movie concerns Santa---excuse me---the Hogfather and the mid-winter celebration he is a symbol of. More specifically, it's about a strange group out to kill San---the Hogfather and an even stranger group determined to keep him alive. You see, if the Hogfather dies, the morning of Chris---Hogswatch, the sun will not rise.

Out to kill the Hogfather is a mysterious (literally) shadowy group known only as the Auditors, their hired assassin Jonathan Teatime (pronounced ""Teh-ah-tih-meh"" . . . sometimes) as well as a band of misfits in Teatime's pay, 3 thieves, one locksmith and a student wizard.

Out to save the Hogfather's life and the world as we humans know it is Death (a.k.a. the Grim Reaper), his assistant/housekeeper Albert and his (mostly) human grand-daughter Susan (it's a long story).

The main villain, Teatime, is more unsettling than actually frightening. His warped logic is effective in this equally bizarre situation. He is not so much bloodthirsty as utterly indifferent to human life, instantly ready to dispatch anyone no longer of use to him, including his followers. I won't go into detail concerning his plan, but will only describe it as both circuitous and ingenious.

Death, in order to save the Hogfather, temporarily takes over his job. His utter unfitness for the role and his growing enthusiasm for it are both comical and endearing. As his housekeeper and temporary elf advises, ""Ho ho ho will suffice. You don't need to add, COWER BRIEF MORTALS.""

The real hero, however, is Susan, a no-nonsense governess of the children of a middling-wealthy family. She is equally prepared for bed-time stories and basement monsters (which she thoroughly thrashes with a poker before kicking them out of the house.) Her calm, methodical determination to protect the Hogfather, and humanity into the bargain, is a perfect contrast to Teatime's lethally bent logic.

Overall, this is a wonderfully funny fantasy film about Christmas, with a fair bit of philosophical fiber smuggled in through the side door. Past fans of Pratchett's books, rest easy; it's a scrupulously faithful adaptation of the novel. Future fans, this is a great introduction to Pratchett's world; be sure to go on to read the books as well, though.",1229472000,3,2484,5.058679706601467

2933063,5,B000V7ZMK0,"Twas the night before Hogwatch, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring... because the only person stirring was Death in a Hogsfather costume.

And fortunately the BBC's first live-action adventure in Terry Pratchett's Discworld is a brilliant affair -- faithful, hilarious, and full of intricate plotting and gutsplitting satire. It also manages to mingle the unsentimental observations about human nature with a feel-good message -- not an easy thing to do, especially in a Christmas-related movie.

On the night before Hogswatch, the Auditors enlist the Assassins' Guild for a very special job: ""delete"" the Hogfather. For this, Lord Downey calls on the psychotically childlike Mr. Teatime (Marc Warren), who has already figured out ways to kill the Hogfather, Soulcake Duck, and even Death. Soon Death (Ian Richardson) finds that the Hogfather has vanished --and takes on the Hogfather's duties for the night, much to the disgust of his granddaughter Susan (Michelle Dockery).

But realizing that something is very seriously wrong with the world, Susan begins investigating the origins of the Hogfather, and the terrible reasons that he has vanished. Mr. Teatime and a locksmith, wizard and trio of thieves have infiltrated the Tooth Fairy's castle and have somehow contrived to erase the Hogfather. And the wizards -- after opening a lethal bathroom for the bombastic Ridcully (Joss Ackland) -- learn that strange creatures are coming into existence, such as the Verruca Gnome and the Eater of Socks (not to mention Bilious, the Oh God of Hangovers).

Now Susan must somehow find a way to bring back the Hogfather -- or else despite all Death's best efforts (""And what do you want, small human?"") the world will lose much more than a jolly fat anthropomorphic personification.

Watching ""The Hogfather,"" it's pretty obvious that the people involved loved the the original book It's extremely faithful to the original Terry Pratchett novel (including in-jokes and cameos) and has the same offbeat weirdness (""TO THE LAUNDRY!""). And while the four main subplots seem scattered and sometimes unclear, as the movie goes on they intertwine tightly and suddenly become very relevant to one another.

And since this is based on a Pratchett book, we're graced with some cynical views on humanity and the nature of belief -- and occasionally touching moments, like Death rescuing a little match girl. There's even a bittersweet edge near the end when Susan confronts the core of the Tooth Fairy's castle, and finds something very unexpected there.

But along the way, we're treated to plenty of hilarious dialogue (""Have you been a good l... a good n... a good individual?""), wildly bizarre slapstick moments (Ridcully scalding himself with Old Faithful) and in-jokes (the inventions of Bloody Stupid Johnson). Barely a scene goes by without something to laugh at, whether it's Teatime's hysterically sick behavior or Death's attempts at yuletide jollity (including a list of things to do at each house, ending with a halfhearted ""ho ho ho"").

The brilliant comedy hits a high note when Death invades a shopping mall so he can have the children tell him what they want (""And be good. This is part of the arrangement."" ""All right!"" ""Then we have a contract""), much to the dismay of the store owner (""He's sitting in his grotto, bold as brass... GIVING AWAY PRESENTS!""

Dockery makes a magnificent Susan -- a little chilly, very strong-willed and determined to be as normal as possible. Warren is a delightfully creepy Teatime with his mismatched eyes and childish voice, and the late Ian Richardson was simply great as Death, whether he's being benevolent or sinister (""Have you been naughty... OR NICE?""). In fact all the actors do a brilliant job -- the wizards, the thieves, and the weird little kids that Susan babysits.

""The Hogfather"" is a Christmas movie with a Discworld edge -- meaning it's funny and unique, but also riddled with deeper messages and sharp satire. Definitely a must-see during the holidays.",1228089600,3,4027,5.125
2933064,3,B000V7ZMK0,"Part of the difficulties with translating a book to film is losing much of what the author tries to convey. Books allow the writer to squeeze in much more character information and wit, while films must do so in (usually) under two hours. Thankfully this duology expands that time line a tad to a much needed three hours and nine minutes. I say much needed because author Terry Pratchett's books deserve the full treatment in terms of time. But, unfortunately, even with this extended amount, the story suffers in translation. Although I must give credit to direct Vadim Jean (who also did the screenplay adaption and continues to adapt Mr. Pratchett's excellent Discworld series), it's tough to give a ravingly positive review to something that I enjoyed only marginally as much as the written works.

I remember sitting in a restaurant on a meal break one day and having portions of a ham sandwich fly from my nose while reading Hogfather. Death (in the film voiced very well by Ian Richardson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becoming-Jane/dp/B000ZIZ0RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becoming Jane</a>) is a central character, and both the book and the movie keep it that way. But what is lost is the clever witticisms of the narrator (Pratchett) that often causes the reader to nearly choke with restrained laughter while trying to keep from puking or inhaling food particles. It was, however, pretty funny to see Death cloaked in Santa (i.e., Hogfather) garb while mushing a sleigh towed by heavily-tusked boars.

Marc Warren (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wanted/dp/B001GKJ2FC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wanted</a>) as Mr. Teatime was a good choice, as he had just the right amount of ruthlessness (which was plenty) and naivet&eacute; (toward his fellow Discworld inhabitants) to make him a fearfully funny antagonist.

However, from here things get off-track. Michelle Dockery plays Susan, the main protagonist, but is mostly lost amidst the larger story. Her part was vital in the novel, but here we simply don't see that much of her in terms of character development. Beating up monsters under the bed? Funny, yes. Trying to protect her scythe-wielding relative? Okay, pretty funny. But what of the rest of her development? In truth, there isn't any in the film. She simply rushes off to help save Hogswatch Eve without much knowledge as to why she's so gung-ho to do it.

The remaining characters are also given excessively abbreviated versions, which made the entire film much less laughable. Indeed, I think I only chuckled a few times during the entire three-plus hours, showing just how much was lost in translation.

I will say, again, that I don't blame writer/director Vadim Jean for this. Without a doubt, this is a tough sell. How can you make something so densely funny as one of Mr. Pratchett's wonderful Discworld books into a guffaw-riddled flick? I think the simple answer is that you can't. And I think this adaptation proves it. But I will give Mr. Jean credit for trying. He succeeded on a very small level but I fear those that haven't read the novels might be less-than-impressed.

Sorry guys.",1227657600,,3203,5.3076923076923075

2933066,5,B000V7ZMK0,"I absolutely love anything and everything pertaining to discworld; I have 2 characters on the Discworld online game, one of which is a newbie helper. I've listened to every single one of the discworld books at least twice, and preordered the Colour of Magic DVD from Amazon.uk the very second I possibly could. With all that being said, I simply had to get my hands on this movie as soon as I heard it existed. Fortunately, I have a region free DVD player, so I ended up purchasing the region 2 2 disc edition of Hogfather. I can't say enough about how much I love this movie. It is very faithful to the book; in a lot of cases, dialogue is word for word out of the book, something which, at least in my humble opinion, is all to rare in book to movie adaptations. Another treat for me was that Nigel Planer, the narrator of the first 23 Discworld audio books, played the part of Sidney the wizard in the movie. As if that wasn't awesome enough, David Jason, who is currently one of my two favorite actors along side Hugh Laurie, played the part of Albert brilliantly. I thought that Ian Richardson did a fantastic job as the voice of death; he sounded just like I would imagine Death sounding from the books. Evrything I've already mentioned would be more than enough to earn this movie 5 stars as far as I'm concerned, but the real icing on the cake, for me at least, was when I discovered that the region 2 version of the Hogfather DVD which I had purchased included audio description for visually impaired viewers. As a blind individual, this fact in and of itself immediatley catipolted the Hogfather DVD into my top 10 favorites. It was great to know everything that was going on,
while still watching the movie by myself. Further more, I was able to watch this movie with a blind friend, and even though he knew nothing about discworld, he was still able to follow what was going on and ended up enjoying it almost as much as I did. I'm planning to share this movie with my parents over the Christmas/Hogswatch holiday and hope that they'll enjoy it too. If I were forced to come up with something negative to say about this DVD, the only thing I could possibly consider a flaw, and I'll be the first to admit that it's hardly even worth mentioning, is that I think that Tony Robinson should have played the part of Knobby Knobs; just based on the fact that he played the
part of Baldrick in Black Adder. I could be completely off base on wanting that change, though, so please feel free to take my opinion regarding that issue with a pound or two of salt.
In all seriousness, however, I would most definitely rate this movie adaptation of Hogfather 10 stars. I don't know if audio description is available on the US edition of Hogfather, but I would certainly hope so. In my humble opinion, audio description should be as readily available as closed captioning, but that's not at all relevant to this review. Incidentally, I just got the Region 2 DVD for The Colour of Magic, which is even better than Hogfather,and it also includes audio description.
Bottom line: If you even remotely enjoy good British humor, fantasy, discworld or if you're just in the market for a different kind of Christmas movie, this DVD is an absolute must buy.
In closing, I can't help adding that if you enjoyed this movie and end up becoming a discworld fan, if you're already a discworld fan or even if you just enjoy online gaming, you should come and visit the discworld online game. The address  is discworld.atuin.net port 4242. My characters, Eponine and Ramie would be more than happy to talk with or help out any newcomers to the game.",1225152000,,3630,4.5

2933069,4,B000V7ZMK0,"The Discworld is a planet where magic is not only in existence but more or less commonplace and well known.  It is, as you may guess by the name, a disc-shaped world flying through space on the back of 4 elephants, on the back of a tortoise.  Why?  Because.  If you have trouble accepting this, you may not enjoy Discworld.

I had to buy this movie after watching it, because I enjoyed it a great deal, but also because it seemed worth watching again and I had it as a rental.  I really enjoyed the book this is adapted from, especially because it is one of Pratchett's more complex books.  This, however, is lost a bit in the movie translation.  Because this book is so complex, it makes for a difficult screenplay.  Also, the book really is not as new-reader friendly as others in the series, and requires you to know the characters.  The movie tries to fill in these gaps, for the non-Discworld fan, by having dialogs tossed in, such as Susan repeating many times about her relation, or Quoth (the raven, not sure if he's ever named in the movie) giving an extremely out of character talk about history.

Also, the book itself runs on several different tracks at the same time, gradually letting the reader understand what the full impact is.  Unseen University, for example, has the events sped up quite a bit, and moved out of order for cinematic benefit.  The shower scene for instance, in the book version, is much funnier, longer, and much later.  Also, Ridicully (the head wizard) also has a cloud of swear words flying around him like bats due to the random magic.  Instead of these, you see the spell being cast by the wizard in the Tooth Fairy's castle, which does not happen in the book, nor do you get the long explanation (twice!) of why and what they are doing.

These flaws are like any book to movie translation though - you have to understand that a movie simply moves different, and they did a decent job.  The acting is very true to character, and with a vast majority of the talk being word for word, down to the physical posturing, pulled from the book (the last 10 minutes are a great example of this).  The end of the thieves in the castle was likely cut out due to time, as it's played up much more in the book, however the one thief you do see go panicky, Cheesewire, plays his part excellently.  If they had left in some of Medium Dave's responses to him, it would have been even better.

Susan, Death, and the children (minor roles but exactly as listed in the book) are played very well.  Albert was a bit over the top, but he really does act that way in this book, which is a bit atypical for his character.  Hex is portrayed a bit better in the book, but they were fair to it in the movie.  I would have liked the scene with Death and Hex to have been a bit more true to the book - it was really good.

My final comments are about features - this DVD is sorely lacking in subtitles, which should be a basic feature on every movie.  I enjoy putting them on to read along, as sometimes you may miss or not hear a comment, or perhaps understand the scene more, not to mention the hearing-impaired would of course desire this.  There is no option for this, and I was not able to make my DVD pick any up at all.  Secondly, the interviewer for Mr. Pratchett has very poor interviewing skills.  His answers are well given, with open ends that she completely fails to ask about.  She is obviously reading off a script, and if he is he fakes it well.  She replies ""brilliant."" in a flat tone after every answer, and sounds bored.  This was disappointing.

In summary, I would recommend this for any Discworld fan, as it's a fairly good interpretation of the book.  It is about 90% true to the book, and nothing is far enough off to make you want to turn it off. For the unfamiliar with Discworld, I would suggest picking up a novel first at your local library to see if you like it, as a lack of knowledge of the world may really impact your enjoyment of it.  Think if you picked up the 3rd Harry Potter book as the first one.  Would you understand why these kids are being chased all the time, and the school seems to be inhabited by madmen?  There are something like 30 Discworld books out, with Hogfather being about midway through the run.  A good jumping on book might be ""Guards, Guards"", or perhaps ""Mort"".  The first in the series is ""The Colour of Magic"", but it may be a hard read for the new user.  The follow up, ""The Light Fantastic"" is a much better book.",1222300800,,4492,4.327751196172249

However, the movie is set up to be so newcomer friendly that many such as myself will have no problem getting into the movie & fully enjoying it.

The story surrounds the disappearance & possible demise of the Hogsfather & Death's attempts to keep everything going by taking his place until the rightful entity can re assume the role. Meanwhile, Death's granddaughter Susan is reluctantly brought into the middle of all of this to help discover what has truly befallen the Hogfather & why.

All in all, I loved this movie. I was overjoyed to hear that it was finally coming to the US so I could finally have a real copy of this to watch each christmas as a new classic. I can only hope that the next movie in the series (Colour of Magic/Light Fantastic) will get the same treatment over here!",1218499200,,1036,4.53475935828877

For her birthday, I purchased this DVD and we watched it together.  Now I simply MUST read the books!  Fantastic production values (especially for a made-for-TV movie) and terrific acting made for a good film, but it was the writing that was the highlight for me.  Witty, touching, engrossing storytelling.  This is a must-see movie not just for Discworld fans but for everyone.  Far better than most of the big-budget films we see out of Hollywood.  If you're on the fence, do yourself a favor and see this movie!  You'll thank me later.",1217635200,,681,4.570247933884297

The background music was constant, annoying and made it difficult to hear the dialogue. Somehow the witty dialogue in the book did not come alive
in the movie. I didn't laugh even once! The wizards were thin!

I fell asleep before I saw the whole thing. I will try to watch it again, all the way through, but at this point I cannot recommend it to anyone. That makes me sad.",1217462400,4,556,4.336538461538462
2933078,4,B000V7ZMK0,"This movie has taken on a daunting task: the visual rendering of a much-beloved book - what's worse, the much-beloved characters with lives in many other of Pratchett's books as well. Imaginative readers have already created images of their favorite (and not-so-favorite) characters, so tend towards outrage when the movie-makers ""get it wrong."" Well, poo on them.

The denizens of Pratchett's world have even more improbable character than the Flat Earth on which they reside, and its physics. There's Susan, for example, the governess who'll stare death in the eye, give him a sharp dressing down, and pick the lint off his cowl so he makes a good impression when making his rounds. Then there are the wizards, cloistered in the Unseen University. Think of it as a sheltered workshop for people who might not and dare not find employment elsewhere - if it weren't for five square meals a day and a steady stream of underclassmen to torment, who knows what they might do? Then there's Mr. Teatime (four syllables when you pronounce each vowel), the Assassin that makes the Guildmaster of the Assassins nervous.

I like Pratchett's books enough to know that something lost in the translation to movie format, especially all the asides and groanable cultural references that make each page of his books into such gems. And, I admit, Death never wholly came to life for me. And Nobbs, well, everyone has their own Nobbs, and this wasn't mine. (It wasn't my movie, either.) Look at Leonardo's paintings, though: he left his thumbprint in the paint, for crying out loud, and no one complains. If you want to pick nits, you'll pick them. If you want to enjoy, you'll enjoy.

I adored it.

It is far from perfect.  The plot is kind of hazy, I got tired of the villain's rather mannered performance, the fx are only about B level, etc.  Minor quibbles.

The movie was aired on the BBC. Be aware it is 3 hours long and is a TV movie not a Theatrical released film. Very British humor, but so very clever. Terry Pratchett even makes an appearance.

2933085,5,B000V7ZMK0,"This TV miniseries came out on the Sci-Fi channel in 2007 and is based on a book of the same name.  The book itself is part of a series of books about a fictional world called Discworld which is an amalgamation of Victorian England, a netherworld of mythological beings, an imaginary world brought to life in children's drawings, and a world of wizards that connects all of them.  This world happens to have their equivalent of Christmas, which they call Hogswatch, and instead of Santa Claus, they have the Hogfather.  Certain spirits want the Hogfather dead, and hire a cunning assassin named Teatime to ""inhume"" him, where inhume is the opposite of exhume, and hence means to put into the grave.

There are 3 main plot lines that all converge at the very end.  The first plot line follows Teatime from his acceptance of the ""hit"" on the Hogfather to his final demise.  The second plot line follows Susan, the blonde lady on the DVD cover.  She tries to stop Teatime.  And the final plot line follows Death and his assistant Albert.  Death is represented by a grim reaper, and happens to be the adopted grandfather of Susan.

The movie relies on hilarious dialogue and unbelievable logic to carry forward a story that is short on action.  The special effects are limited, but quite effective.  The musical score is plain, but quite appropriate for a movie built on wit, irony, sarcasm, and unexpected plot turns.  The mood of the movie ranges from macabre to ludicrious to melancholy.  Yet like all good British movies, there are scenes that provide important insights into the human psyche.  Overall, a great movie and worth the time to watch it.

We believe things that have no physical existence because that's who we are. If we truly believe, the sun will come up every morning...not just a hot ball of gas.",1213228800,3,524,4.645161290322581

You can't read the book without tissue to mop up the tears from laughing and maybe a trip to the bathroom. Pratchett is one of the funniest men on this planet.

I think the book translated well to film, although I am wondering if someone who hadn't read the book could follow it as well.  It's the story of Discworld's winter holiday Hogswatch, which is presided over by the Hogfather, something like St. Nick with a sleigh pulled by hogs and his own tusks.

The Auditors, who count everything, decide to do away with the Hogfather.  To do so, they hire the Assassins Guild (in Discworld there is a Guild for everything).  In turn the head of the Assassins Guild hires Teatime, a sociopathic killer.  Death decides to foil the plot and through a series of machinations, gets his granddaughter Susan involved.

The film isn't near as funny as the book. I think the creators did a great job of casting the characters.  Appearances even voices were so on with what I saw and heard in my head when I read the story.

This is billed as a children's movie.  It's not particularly rough, although there are some murders.  Most of the violence is without gore.

I definitely recommend ""Hogfather"" for Pratchett fans and as well for people like my husband and I who don't do traditional Christmas films.  This DVD will reside in my collection next to ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which we have to review every year.

Ian Richardson brought life to the character Death, who wore a simple skull and black robe costume before donning the jolly red suit of the Hogfather, Discworld's answer to Father Christmas.

You'll have to take a bit of a plunge, into a world that is seething with magic, and with satire of English stereotypes. But it's worth it, and you'll be seeing something that Hollywood could never pull off.

If you're a Terry Pratchett fan, do not fear: this is NOT (yet another) insipid rendition of a really funny novel. It's so brilliantly true to the book, you'll be amazed. By instant agreement, the family voted this one to be one of the ""must-watch"" list for the Christmas holidays, along with Christmas Carol, It's a Wonderful Life, and Love Actually.

Turning a novel into a film is hard: any decent novel has just too much material in it for 110 mins. But in this case, the screen writers and director did a damn good job; sometimes pages worth of written dialogue are captured in a fast two-second exchange of looks. The actors and effects rise to all the roles. Ridcully IS Ridcully; Susan IS Susan; you'll have trouble seeing them any other way from now on. And Death is not some cheezy Halloween skeleton costume.

The Auditors have approached the assassin's guild and taken out a contract on the Hogfather (you know, Santa.)  How do you kill a potentially mythological creature?  Well, the guild decides to send their craziest assassin, Teatime (Marc Warren) to do the job.

As Teatime goes about his mission, the body count begins to rise, which catches the attention of Death (a wonderful puppet voiced by Ian Richardson).  Over the years, Death has grown fond of humans, so he sets out to fill in for the suddenly missing Hogfather.

And Death's antics catch the attention of Susan (Michelle Dockery), his granddaughter.  When Susan learns what is happening, she sets out to find the Hogfather and save his life, a mission that takes her to the Tooth Fairy's castle.  Will she be in time?

While I'm not normally a fantasy fan, I had heard of Terry Pratchett's popular Discworld series.  This British TV miniseries is based on one of his stories.  I'm pretty conflicted about it.  On the one hand, there was plenty of fun in the story and setting.  The acting was wonderful.  And the movie looked incredible.  It was very state of the art and has plenty of eye candy.  I especially loved watching the ""computer"" write on parchment with quill and ink.  While there are some discussions about belief that will fly over kids' heads, there's nothing here that should really frighten them.

However, it moved pretty slowly.  It is three hours long and could easily be cut down to two if they wanted to make the effort.  There is a whole sub-plot involving a wizarding college that could have been cut and the needed information worked in some other way.  Really, very little happens there that we need to know, although there are a couple fun scenes set there.

I'm sure the books' many fans will love this movie.  Fantasy fans in general will enjoy it as well.  The rest of us can do worse then this miniseries, but a good editing job would have made things more enjoyable.",1210291200,9,2118,4.768595041322314

To my delight, this is a BRILLIANT rendering of the book. The wit is all there. Susan, Albert, Ridcully, and even Death fit their written characters, bang on. Mr Teatime is perfectly psychopathic. If there was any room to quibble, it would be that Nobby looks more human than one might expect.

The imagery is also vividly done, and a picture being worth a thousand words is probably how the screenplay manages to capture so much of the book in the time available.

I found that the little I had read of Discworld was more than sufficient, and my partner has not read any of them, and he had no questions about it.

This is NOT a children's story - there is no problem with content, but the story is complex and some of the satire is subtle.  The cover is a little misleading in that respect.

The casting was well done, with the notable exception of Mustrum Ridcully, who as you know is a robust outdoorsman in the books, but for some reason is cast in the film as the oldest and fattest wizard, more jolly than gruff. Teatime's character was somewhat effeminate, not as menacing as the book's Teatime. But Susan was perfect, as beautiful as she was serious and deadly. Death and Albert steal the show. The sets were excellent. The great turtle and the elephants carrying the Discworld were very cool. It's really a great first try at a film adaptation of a Discworld book.

Add to that the source material's original genius and you have some serious potential.

While I found Susan's acting just a trifle insipid, Death was straight out of the pages of the many Pratchett novels in which he's put in an appearance: completely deadpan, yet utterly hilarious.  Corporal Nobb's brief appearance was picture perfect as well, and a laugh riot to boot.  I also have to say that Teatime, as a movie character, is in my personal top ten list of Creepiest Movie Villains Ever.

The story is darker than I remembered (I haven't read the book in years), but full of both drama and comedy.

This movie is very good. It is not intended for children, but you could watch it with your older kids without concern about excessive violence. There were some nightmares at our house after watching it, though, so I wouldn't show it to the little guys. (My husband, in case you're wondering...)

2933131,5,B000V7ZMK0,"Terry Pratchett fans long waited for the transformation of Discworld tales into visuals.  Computer games, animations and stage productions were all right in their place, but film adaptations are the mark of success.  Pratchett resisted adaptations because most producers ""didn't get it"".  Vadim Jean ""got it"" and has made the story of ""Hogfather"" into a fine film presentation.  As a TV production, there are limitations and omissions, but these do not detract from the success of Jean's efforts to bring Pratchett's story of intrigue, power and imagination to the small screen.

But what of the newcomer to Pratchett and his Discworld?  Will they gain the same satisfaction from the visual presentation of one of the more compelling [and best-selling] authors of the past generation?  The DVD opens with a Bang.  Not a very Big one, but enough to discharge a wondrous sight - a disc sitting atop four elephants who stand on the carapace [""shell""] of a giant tortoise.  The vision certainly imparts the feeling that something unusual will follow.  Which it does: a young governess is reading ""Jack And The Beanstalk"" to a pair of youngsters on Hogswatch Eve.  Tucking them in, Susan notes: ""If you don't believe in the Hogfather, there won't be any presents.""  It is the film's key statement.

For the Hogfather has gone missing.  This may be because the Auditors of the Universe, who resent life and loathe humans because they're unpredictable, have commissioned Guild of Assassins to have the Hogfather ""brought to an end"".  The Guild's Head assigns the job to a young Assassin, Mister Teatime [""Tee-ah tim-eh, most people get it wrong, Sir.""] who has already devised a plan to accomplish it.  Teatime gathers a team to put his plan into effect.  This scheme starts by kidnapping the Tooth Fairy.  Wot?

Meanwhile, across town, the wizards of the Unseen University are experiencing some bizarre events.  Strange new beings enter their lives - not entirely strange, however, since they all seem to represent tales of their childhood.  Among the wizards is one who has constructed HEX, a ""thinking machine"".  You can tell what it is from the label ""Anthill Inside"" pasted on one side.  Archchancellor Ridcully is suspicious of such devices, but thinks he can make HEX do his bidding by mere shouting.

Throughout these events, an Anthropomorphic Personification, known as Death, feels an imbalance in the universe.  Discovering the Hogfather has failed to go out on his rounds delivering gifts, Death dons a red suit, a false beard and, with his assistant Albert, undertakes the role.  Death is interested in humans, finding their habits and prejudices fascinating, and he wants to know more about them.  The rituals of Hogswatch [Christmas] are but one aspect.  Those rituals extend from deep time and are thereby fundamental.  Resolution of the Hogfather's disappearance and the Teatime Gang's invasion of the Tooth Fairy's castle are gently woven into the film's concluding scene.  There are many threads and the novice Discworld viewer will note there are many levels to the story.  That's what turns the first Discworld encounter into a habit.

There are ""big names"" in this film - listed lead David Jason does a fine job as Albert, while Ian Richardson's voice of Death is peerless.  The surprise here is Michelle Dockery, who picks up this film early and keeps it essentially hers throughout.  She is relatively unknown, but won't be after this.  As a robed ""skellington"", Death is hardly visually appealing, but Richardson's inflections on Pratchett's text keep us smiling.  Unlike many ""fantasy"" or SciFi films, ""Hogfather"" relies on little in the way of ""special effects beyond Death's character.  Some snow stops falling and a few sparkling things are used, but the story is too straightforward to need extra dazzlement.  As with Pratchett's stories it's the characters and what they tell us that counts.  Watch this and see.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",1206057600,10,3974,5.0819165378670785
2933132,3,B000V7ZMK0,"My wife and I watched Hogfather last night. We found it entertaining, very much on a par with Stardust (DeNiro/Pfeiffer) - no better, no worse. I really like the actress who played Susan. Very classy.  However, I was distracted by the constantly shifting production quality, where scenes went from very dark to bleached-out bright. This was sometimes confusing, as they attempted to indicate shifts between locations and story lines by changing the lighting, yet scenes WITHIN the castle near the end varied widely from shot to shot.

I am a casual Terry Pratchett fan, having read a couple of his books, but I'm not a Discworld zealot. My wife has not read any of Pratchett's work. So we did not approach the movie with any expectations. We both felt it is a worthy effort, but a bit long (3+ hours) and wish the production had been a bit better. The Tooth Fairy's castle was so obviously a cheap plywood set!

Overall, I'd give this a mild thumbs up.",1205280000,,952,4.654761904761905

That said, I really, really love Terry Pratchett's novels. I think he's without a doubt one of the best writers working in the English language today, and ""Hogfather"" was always one of my favorite books.

That said, this movie was... well, acceptable. I liked it more than I did the two animated Discworld movies. The casting was pretty spot-on, especially with Teatime (though I think Brian Blessed would've made a better Ridcully. Joss Ackland is just too restrained in the role). The sets were wonderful and the adaptation was decent, even if it did require quite a bit of knowledge about Discworld to get most of the jokes.

But this DVD... ugh.

No subtitles.

No real extras.

The trailer on here was frankly awful. If I had no desire to see the movie because I've enjoyed the books, the trailer wouldn't have done it for me.

The interview with Terry Pratchett was sort-of decent, though the sound quality and editing were miserable. There was just no energy to it, and that's kind of sad, cause I've met Mr Pratchett on a couple occasions and he was always very vibrant and upbeat.

In the end, I recommend the movie and the DVD, though likely you'll get far more enjoyment out of them if you're already a fan of the series than you will if you're just Joe Random looking for something good to watch.",1205193600,4,1390,4.59919028340081

Overall this movie was a very good rendition of the book, and it was amazing seeing such an accurate portrayal.  I rather liked that they didn't bother trying to spend a lot of time explaining the discworld mythos, this was a movie made for the fans.  They knew their target market and catered to them rather then trying to use the movie to generate new fans.

I love the discworld books and happily spend many hours reading each of the books, but the movie seemed to do in 3 hours what it could have done in 2 - 2.5 hours.  I wouldn't want to have the job trying to pick everything that would be cut, but there were times that it just seemed slow.  Other scenes were just fanservice and unnecessary - I think they spent a minute to introduce the death of rats, and never did anything with it again.

Other then the issue with the time, I think this would be a movie any fan of the series would love.  The interview with pratchett was a treat, one of the only times I've actually sat through one of those interviews and had even more respect.",1204934400,,1114,4.271428571428571

I have read the Pratchett books for years and I love his dry humor and satirization of sword and sorcery books and movies, ala Harry Potter,ect. However, something was lost in the transition from the book to the movie here. This probably wasn't the best choice for a first movie using the Pratchett books as anyone who hasn't read the books won't know who all the characters are or how discworld works. I though some of the scenes went on too long and too much of the acting was over the top. I also thought that the humor was too underplayed. When Death took over the Hogfather's role it should have been hilarious. Also, Susan's character could have shown more spunk. I watched Terry Pratchett's interview on this DVD after the movie. I never realized what a downer he is. Apparently, he thinks all life is useless and everything is meaningless and that is the message he transmits in his books. He sounds like a old man who has lost faith in everything and everyone. I'm not talking religion here, I mean he just seems to be saying that everything is hopeless. I was really kind of suprised on his take on things. Also, he uses Death as his mouthpiece to espouse his philosophy which seems to mostly meaningless nonsense. I know a lot of you won't agree with me on this because you are so glad to see one of his books made into a movie at last. I'm not saying I didn't get some enjoyment from it, I just think it could be better.",1204848000,10,1524,4.350877192982456

No, I'm not talking about the content of this movie--as far as I can tell, it is, in fact, rather faithful (almost page by page) in its depiction of the book.

Unfortunately, that ""as far as I can tell"" is precious little, since it's neither subtitled nor closed-captioned--a feature that I would have greatly appreciated as a deaf man and rabid fan of Terry Pratchett's work.

I know it's futile to say anything about it here (especially considering that most other imported British movies--especially made-for-TV productions--have the same failing), but I just wanted to register in some way how let-down I felt.

If you've never read Terry Pratchett - don't worry about it - neither has my husband, and he loved the movie too. If you have read the book - you have got to get this movie!

So - the basic story is that the Hogfather (Santa Claus) is - well - gone. That's the word for it - gone. A rather inappropriate - individual - is filling in for him - not fully understanding the role, because, if the Hogfather remains gone, the Sun will not rise in the morning. Other side effects to the missing Hogfather end up creating a computer asking for a teddy bear, a fairy that brings warts, and a sock eating monster (you've always known that one existed in the dryer, right?). There's a lot of humor, a lot of heart, and a few very good philosophical points - ah I don't know how to describe Pratchett. Just watch it. If you want a good story and a good laugh - it's there. If you want something more, something to make you think - you'll find that too.",1204243200,3,1090,4.1415094339622645
2933138,4,B000V7ZMK0,"What a treat! I found this little gem over the holidays and recorded it, being too busy to watch it during the season. And boy was I so glad that I did.

Anyone familiar with the book knows the basic story - a mysterious group called the Auditors hire the Assassins Guild to terminate the Hogfather, aka the Discworld's version of Santa Claus. Things, of course, are not so simple, because if the Hogfather dies then the first steps would be taken that would ultimately destroy the very thing that makes humans human - the ability to believe. To hope. To dream. To imagine.

Forces are aligned to oppose the Auditors and their plan. Death and his granddaughter Susan (long story, it's best not to inquire too closely, he is Death after all) each use different strategies and tactics to try and save Hogswatch night and the Hogfather himself.

Pratchett's story is a moving one. It's the birth and death of hope, and its rebirth, all wrapped up in the story of Santa Claus' birth and death. What makes a human believe in concepts with no real meaning? Hope, justice, mercy, maybe love. What are these things except concepts we invented in our heads and then tried to make the world conform to our new beliefs? We have to dream first, then try and make that dream reality. But, without the dream, there is no reality.

It really is an excellent story, and the movie version did it true justice, which only we humans can judge and to which I think Death would approve. The only thing which kept it being five stars in my rating is that it wasn't the book. That such a deep and moving concept can be written about and still be incredibly funny speaks volumes about Pratchett's writing ability. The movie is incredibly true to the book. Unfortunately, very, very few movies can compete with the literary medium. This one did its best, but fell just a hair short.

Still, kudos!

As I don't live in England and I don't have any means of viewing anything from England, I was incredibly delighted to see  this dvd on the shelf of a local bookstore.  I bought Hogfather, even though I have never even read the book (shame on me--I have read other Discworld books, but have not come to this one yet).  Two words--LOVE IT!  It's over 180 minutes of viewing-time, so there is plenty of time to unfold Terry Pratchett's weird and wonderful storyline--I only wish it were a little longer.  I hated coming to the end of it.  Loved the music, too.  Too bad it's not on cd (as I can see--drat and tarnation!).

The performances were all very good.  Susan was pretty much how I envisioned she would be.  Mr. Teatime (pronounced TEE-a-time-AY)was on the creepier side of Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka (I don't know how the character was in the book, but the portrayal in the movie was such a sickly creepy one that it sent shivers down my spine--truly a much scarier approach than if he were a hissing sort of assasin with a gravely voice and a five-o'clock shadow).  Death's stint as the Hogfather was absolutely hilarious and tinged with moments of levity that make you nearly want to cry.

Terry Pratchett is a master of both praising and mocking the human condition. This adaptation of Hogfather will not disappoint.  My only wish is for more film adaptations like this one to be made of his wonderful Discworld books.",1200787200,23,1500,4.569288389513108

I really liked ""Hogfather"". They got it right. I was very impressed on the way they stuck to the story. We have seen it twice so far.

I will not repeat the fine comments on the plot from the other reviews, because they do a good job.

You need to look carefully for what happens in the background. These folks put their hearts and souls into this fine movie. It is obvious they are fans.

But if you haven't discovered Discworld, you owe it to yourself to buy the books (Amazon has them), or go to your local public library; they still exist, and are not just for Internet browsing!",1524268800,,531,4.484536082474227

Second... you have to REAAAALLLY like T. Pratchett to like this show. I mean... really, really, really like him. I've read most of the Pratchett Diskworld series (and its various branches), and I completely dig his work. But this show is very poorly made. I've since read in other reviews that the company that made it is known for budget movies and shlocky sets, but this really goes far off the deep end. Visually, the effects are bad and dated, the story (while holding to the book well) makes the mistake of holding TOO much of the book without doing any of its glorious aspects justice. It's not funny. It's not clever. It's a confusing mess with none of the joyful satire and wit of Pratchett. The only reason one might enjoy it is because one is remembering how funny that scene was when one READ it. That means this is only... and I mean ONLY... for someone who's read Hogfather, loved Hogfather, and is overjoyed that Hogfather has been made into a TV show (and doesn't care that the actual show is utterly unwatchable).

 The whole thing is badly based, confusing, rushed, badly executed, badly interpreted for screen, and overall just bad.

Making matters worse, the audio is pretty awful. Dialogue is so garbled and it's so badly mixed that I needed to use the closed captioning  and I'm an audio engineer's wife with perfect hearing!

Just so disappointing if you're a Pratchett fan... unless you know you're going into a truly badly made, badly executed, badly done show.",1524182400,4,1563,4.686131386861314

8217166,5,B000V7ZMK0,"This has the tropes of a ""heroes save Christmas"" made for TV movie but with the Pratchett humor and depth. If you like Discworld, give this one a try. Death (my favorite character) has a wonderfully unexpected role.",1523059200,,215,4.684210526315789
