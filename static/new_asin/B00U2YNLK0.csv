7027987,3,B00U2YNLK0,"The kind of movie that anyone can make fun of.  An old drunk stoner who still hasn't burned all the way out, and is pretty much a dick.  A self absorbed dick that gets nowhere near the subject matter that he had dreamed up at the beginning.  This is the movie you would get back if you gave you're skeeziest uncle a decent video camera and $5000.  So, yeah 3 stars.",1437523200,,365,4.098591549295775

7027989,5,B00U2YNLK0,"I love this movie. It made me laugh. Wayne Dawen is a character who needs to be seen to be believed. I saw this on-line and had to buy the dvd for myself. Darwen is a trailblazer, there is no other pot expert out there quite like him. I learned a lot (though this is NOT a ""how to"" film). ""High There"" is a movie that has to be seen to be believed, describing the plot doesn't really do it justice.",1436486400,2,398,3.925925925925926
7027990,5,B00U2YNLK0,"Very funny and original. Fear and Loathing meets Apocalypse Now meets Hawaii Five 0 and molested by Cheech and Chong. It's not the most sensitive or politically correct movie that you will see this year, but the movie's main character 'Dave' comes across as lovable in the end... even though it sometimes seems as if he has the ethical compass of a honey badger that has raided your grandma's liquor cabinet. Overall I would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor that is not easily offended.",1435881600,3,498,4.670454545454546
7027991,5,B00U2YNLK0,This movie depicts an odd and entertaining character (Dave High) along his journey in Hawaii descovering his own triumphs and trials with marujauana and other drugs. He comes  across equally entertaining and out of the box characters who lead him to more suspicious encounters. This plot has its share of twists and turns as unexpected events come into play and Dave High must make choices amist his foggy perceptions. Defintiely a movie to watch with your friends for a good time or by yourself for some private evalutaion. High There is a unique story telling process that offers a real world look into someones private journey/struggles.,1435708800,5,640,5.037735849056604
7027992,5,B00U2YNLK0,"I really enjoyed this film. Raw. Entertaining. Expect the unexpected. Be prepared for a journey that leads you to laughter and brings you to question how does Dave manage to do it?  He lives life on the edge and seems to get every ounce of pleasure out if it! Along the way you meet a bunch of very interesting characters. It's more than a documentary- it's part adventure film, part reality TV show, comedy/drama/romance all rolled into one!  A crazy ride! No need at all to be high for viewing- you don't wouldn't want to miss a word! There needs to be a Part Two!",1435536000,4,566,4.380952380952381
7027993,5,B00U2YNLK0,"I live in the town where this movie was filmed and have waited nearly 3 years to see it! Now this is not your parents Cheech & Chong type dope movie for kids! This movie is raw and real, scenes like Rosanne's museum are crazy funny and then Roger Christie's story takes a dark look what happen to him and his THC church. A very compelling master piece... Hoping for a sequel.....",1435104000,2,379,4.277777777777778
7027994,1,B00U2YNLK0,to be honest I didn't watch the whole thing... I wasted about 30 minutes so you won't have to :-/,1435017600,,97,3.9
7028015,2,B00U2YNLK0,"Full disclosure, didn't actually finish it. Stopped probably 20 minutes from the end.

""High Dave"" is a clearly washed up tabloid journalist trying to stay viable. He's over-medicated, uneccessarily paranoid, and too horny for his own good. What I was expecting to be a travel-style documentary about weed in Hawaii quickly turned into a drug addled old man trying to make his own personal porn.

Incredibly unimpressed. If you're into aged people getting high and partying, then I suppose you might enjoy this. But it has absolutely no legitimate content.",1462492800,,556,5.166666666666667

7028022,5,B00U2YNLK0,"This film is whacked! If you're lookin for something that's real and something thats funny,rent or buy this movie..its real funny. Darwen is like Cheech and Chong, Hunter S. Thompson and Frank Drebin all rolled into one lovable fuzzball. His laughter is contagious and his self deprecating humor just may atone for his sins. I enjoyed feeling like a fly on the wall as he sinks into a fog of debauchery and paranoia against the wishes of his gas-masked sidekick, whos scenes in the driving rain at the Bates are also hilarious. Groovy soundtrack and there is an underlying theme that may or may not have been intended...we all take ourselves a little too seriously and could benefit  from lightening up a bit. Laughter truly is the best medicine and I got some good medicine by watching this film. Its refreshing to see something thats not hollywood politically correct, staged, polished b.s. this is about as real as it gets,lo-fi down and dirty...more, give me more please....",1446422400,2,978,4.8562874251497
7028023,4,B00U2YNLK0,"Curiosity got the best of me to watch  this one. At the end I asked mysdelf, did I really watch that?  I mean I've known days of hi jinx similar to this (well not that deep) - but this guy is wacked.  For anyone that partakes - maybe - maybe, you will identify with this one.",1446422400,3,275,3.875
7028024,5,B00U2YNLK0,"This is a very interesting and hysterical documentary on the reality of WEED. No, not the things growing out of your flower bed; that is unless you live in Colorado. I think this is a prime example of a perfect Documentary. I was thoroughly entertained. I laughed and was very much educated. I aint going to lie, I have smoked a Joint and ate one hell of a Yummy Brownie before. Weed aint my thing, but for those who love it, smoke it, or use it as a medical means, I am all for it. Its a natural plant. If the government was smart, they would legalize it, tax the crap out of it, and sell it like Cigarettes. Our economy would flourish, plain and simple.

This is an experience to watch. Brink Vision has done it again and brought out a very unique film like they tend to do. I really did not know what to expect going into this but was very satisfied in the end. I think its a perfect example of the art form of film making through a real person, situations, and the exploration of the human species in all its weird HIGH form.

I cant speak highly enough about this odd ball non-fiction comedy. A true eye opening trip, pardon the pun, documentary. Mix in all the weird reality of the government, the marijuana advocate Roger Christie, and his THC Ministry, and you have one wild ride of drugs, sex and yes as you would guess, massive paranoia. Now there are two directors both well educated in the form of cinema. Wayne Darwen and Henry Goren. Wayne is a long time journalist and producer, and Henry is a video-grapher. Now something very interesting and wild for all you movie lovers and Oliver Stone freaks, is that Wayne was the inspiration for the character Wayne Gale in Oliver Stones masterpiece Natural Born Killers. Now both directors appear in the film under different names, Wayne is Dave High and Henry is Roland Jointz.

This is possibly one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time. Its truly original and a perfect example of everything to do in a memorable, wild, over the top and perfect piece of filmed cinema. The reality based ordeal, the characters, the travel log like atmosphere, and the wild comical truths leave a truly lasting impression.

I feel this is a perfect film. There is no flaw with this documentary. I was thoroughly entertained and it gave me a wild ride, simply put, HIGHly recommend.

7028045,1,B00U2YNLK0,"*YAWN* I lived in this town, and unfortunately hung out with this forgettable wretch a little while he was making this trash. If you watch it, keep in mind it's just an old-has-been-wannabe's diary of being where he wasn't welcome, once he was found out..

Not that all this didn't all happen to him, I'm sure it did. Likely because this is what happens when you force yourself into a tight knit community and then lie to everyone about the kind of ""documentary"" they will appear in - promising to portray the incredible spiritual energy they were tuned to but he was completelly oblivious of, and certainly never had intention of exploiting. Case in point: the nude beach he goes to is one where many onlookers leave feeling like they've just been to church but he found only soul less bodies..

He's just an old, broke, wasted shell of what was probably never really all the way human, willing to sell anyone out in his desparate need for attention.

Only a *cock*roach could go to a beautiful spiritual island in Paradise, where Angels are commonly found and find himself in the clutches of demons, trapped in the pits of hell.",1444953600,,1130,4.64
7028046,1,B00U2YNLK0,"This is some hold out hippie who has been hanging onto the summer of love for the last 46 years. Simply put, its his home movie from a Hawaii vacation.",1444521600,,151,4.066666666666666

7028048,5,B00U2YNLK0,"The film is crazy, weird, funny, and very Hunter Thompson. The alternative title could be ""Fear and Loathing on the Big Island,"" with the same proportion of hilarity to weirdness to paranoia to self-loathing. Wayne starts with a plan to make a pilot for a marijuana travelogue show, but on the plane he realizes how ill-conceived his idea is and starts self-medicating before even landing. Then he encounters the pot smokers and growers and...weirdness ensues. He gets ripped off, he gets laid, he suspects he's being trailed by the DEA...all in the beauty of Hawaii. Great editing made this documentary work, since Wayne was high and his camera shooter was angry with him most of the time.",1443744000,,690,4.905982905982906
7028049,5,B00U2YNLK0,"What a HIGHLY entertaining trip this film is. First off, the characters are absolutely hysterical and I frequently found myself laughing out loud and wiping tears from my eyes. These local Hawaiians on a part of the island none of us ever visit are like this bizarro world of the paradise we typically see in any depiction of the islands...toothless potheads and skanky MILF's living life on their own terms and always ready to party and, well, you know. Yet just like the star who lands in their midst and is instantly seduced into their sagging and sensual vortex, these people are not without charm and appeal. Dave High and his reluctant cameraman, a gas-masked Sancho Panza (who was my favorite character of all), set off around the world to make a TV pilot about marijuana cultivators and barely make it out of the first place they land. Which reminds me, I definitely want to see that TV pilot one of these days.",1440374400,2,919,4.644171779141105
7028050,3,B00U2YNLK0,"A fair film made by reasonable artists. Rather fairy tale like, but overall it's watchable and gives a bit of insight into the trade.",1439164800,,133,4.583333333333333

7028053,2,B00U2YNLK0,"Somewhat entertaining at points.  Basically a cobbled together travelogue of a guy on a bender in the Pahoa area of the Big Island.

Kind of sad... you're left with the feeling that following around most anyone else in the film might have been more interesting.",1438214400,,261,4.777777777777778
7028054,2,B00U2YNLK0,Gonzo?  No freaking way. This movie wasn't entertaining nor funny.  The guy comes off like the selfish tabloid reporter jerk he proclaims to be.,1438128000,,144,4.958333333333333

8704119,2,B00U2YNLK0,"Pretty lame. Thought there was going to be kinda like a Cheech and Chong thing. But all it is, is some old dude being followed around getting high and drunk. I could have done that and been funnier by myself.",1477094400,,208,4.225

8704124,1,B00U2YNLK0,This guy Dave is very inconsiderate and didn't do justice to the locals who live in Hawaii. I know several of the folks in the film who were exploited and disrespected by this guy for his own personal gain. I can't believe they agreed to be in this film. The guy is an inconsiderate haole from the mainland and gives mainland haoles a bad name. The only reason why I watched the film was bc I stumbled upon it and realized that it took place where I live and people that are fixtures in the Puna community were in the video.  I hope Dave's liver rots out and that he smokes himself into a lethal heart attack.,1463097600,2,609,4.205128205128205
