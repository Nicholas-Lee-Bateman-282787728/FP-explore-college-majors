5635996,2,B00BKBCLBY,"I haven't looked through this Blu-ray fully and to the best of my ability, but I can assume that it will be the same from what I've seen so far.

It comes with everything labeled on the box, but not much else more. To the side is a sheet that lists the titles of the songs on the soundtrack CDs, with lyrics for the songs with lyrics on the other pages.

As for the English dub, I find it bad and would recommend watching it subtitled, but that's my opinion.

The problem lies with the Japanese commentary for each of the episodes. It's there and subtitled, but it isn't the full commentary. The commentary I watched for the first episode happened to extend for the length of the episode, and it cut off short at the end, which I found odd.
Now, I happen to have the Japanese commentary on my computer, and the length of the one for the first episode happens to be around 33 minutes long. An episode of Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is around 24 minutes long, so for all 13 episodes, there were parts cut out.
This is the reason why this product got the rating it did. Don't get me wrong, I love this series. But getting shafted and not having the full audio commentary doesn't sit well with me.",1370563200,5,1188,4.247787610619469
5635997,5,B00BKBCLBY,"Although the beginning started off slow as ecchi and shoujo about the love between a high school boy and a ghost, the pieces soon began to connect throughout the series and more dark/horrific themes are insinuated. Though the ending was a definite tear-jerker, there seemed to be a happy ending after all. Even though I believed the series would have ended up a lot better if the happy ending was not pursued, it was overall an enjoyable anime to me.",1368230400,6,450,4.6375
5635998,5,B00BKBCLBY,"Overall, I really enjoyed this show. It didn't start off too strong (although the beginning was quite funny), but by the end it was great. I felt a great deal of emotional and really felt for the characters within this show. It reminded me somewhat of Ef: A Tale of Melodies, but wasn't as good. The very ending could have been better, but it is easily ignored.",1364947200,5,361,4.402985074626866
5635999,4,B00BKBCLBY,"At first, I didn't think I'd like Dusk Maiden of Amnesia (Tasogare Otome X Amnesia), but this series pleasantly surprised me.

The story revolves around a first-year middle school student, Teiichi Niiya who had just enrolled at Seikyou Private Academy. When he gets lost in one of the school's old building, he meets a girl named Yuko Kanoe who reveals herself as a ghost with no memories. Teiichi then decides to investigate her death by looking through the school's seven mysteries revolving around her. Throughout the story, Teiichi and Yuko discover the truth about these ghost stories and help those who are troubled.

This series is very unique, combining both horror, mystery, and comedy over the course of 12 exciting episodes. Once you start watching, you'll be hooked. This series would've received 5 stars if not for the high amounts of fanservice. As a female anime fan, fanservice never appealed to me. And, in this show in particular, the fanservice greatly distracted me from the plot. So,overall:

Pros
+Mix of horror/comedy genres
+Fast-paced storyline
+Catchy opening theme
+Great Ending

Cons
-Large amounts of fanservice

Overall, this is a must-buy!

Afternote: I did not review the dub, since it was unreleased. You can view the sub on crunchyroll.com for free (legally, of course).

5636008,5,B00BKBCLBY,"The following review is written fresh from completing this anime in under 24 hours.

However, before we get into it I'd like to make a note about fan service, because some people, including professional reviewers on places like Amazon seem to be slightly confused about what fanservice is. Fan service is nudity, near nudity and other titillation for titillation's sake, simply to give the audience a treat. If any form of sexuality or nudity in the show serves the plot and/or character development then it's not fanservice. So, does Yuuko strip down? Yes. However her lack of concern for her own nudity changes as the story arc progresses. Why? Well watch it and it's rather patently clear. However, if it was completely clear I wouldn't have to be making this note. Let this serve as a warning to pay attention and actually stick your head in the lake and have a look around, as opposed to just watching the surface.

Now then, taking it from the top!

Story - 10/10
The story in Dusk Maiden is absolutely beautiful. There's plenty of plot to enjoy and I didn't find any of it dry, boring or predictable until I finally started putting two and two together. I'm not writing anything about it in the name of avoiding spoiling, but it has a lovely blend of romance, comedy, horror and above all a good ghost story. Now, the story itself is complex, and details are hidden away in the art and even music. This isn't an anime you can't not pay attention to. It also generated a lot of discussion. A friend and I literally had to discuss every episode in detail, and I'm actually doing so as part of a podcast for the Pogcast Network and my non-anime watching guinea pig for the show is as enthralled as the rest of the people I've dragged into this.

As a side note, the story gets a gold star from me for avoiding my greatest anime pet peeve revolving around this concept called ""resolution"" that some anime directors seem to try and ward off like it's well, an evil spirit.

Art - 10/10
This anime is absolutely beautiful in every possible way. The character design is good and the settings and ways the animators show us is absolutely wonderful. The cinematography is not something I often get to compliment in anime, but I have to for Dusk Maiden; angles, color, and an amazing variety of motions and fades create a visually grabbing world that blends beautifully with the art itself. As mentioned, the art hides a lot of really deep and meaningful symbols that contribute to the plot. The duology in particular makes for a gripping sense of atmosphere when it's employed. The opening gets special note for it's beautiful shots, and it's use of one of the symbols, the momiji (maple leaves in their autumn colors) which is a reference to a Noh play Momijigari, and the Kabuki dance drama of the same name. The latter being an expanded version of the former.

Music and Sound Design - 10/10
The music is stunning from start to finish, Choir Jail, the OP is well paced and enjoyable as Suzuki Konomi delivers once again, and Calendrier, sung by the character Yuuko herself for the EP, makes watching through the credits a treat not worth missing. Acquiring the OST is almost as much of a priority as the actual DVDs. Lucky for you dear reader if you do purchase the reasonably priced DVD box set, the OST is included. The music within the anime is excellent and well themed to the various scenes, ranging from upbeat to haunting. I'm honestly not sure what some of the other reviewers were listening to, but this audiophile was extremely pleased, even more pleased, as I am an audiophile, when I ran the OST through my expensive audio gear of course.

Characters - 10/10
Teiichi Niiya - Teiichi seems to be getting a lot of flak for being ""normal"", which I honestly think is a good trait, he might be a regular guy, but he's not weak when the chips are down, and when it comes to Yuuko he faces down some pretty serious stuff with his arms wide open. He's got a lot of courage, and of course gets props for being an anime character who can be open about his emotions before the final episode.

Momoe Okonogi - The comic relief character, Momoe's a very pleasant ditz and scaredy cat who absolutely loves ghost stories and the paranormal, while at the same time having a very, very strong Reality/Someone Else's Problem filter that blocks out all but the most obvious actions of the paranormal.

Kirie Kanoe - The grand niece of Yuuko, Kirie is the only other person who can really ""see"" Yuuko. A complex and conflicted young woman, Kirie is actually one of my favorites in the story because of her arc and how she grows and confronts many of her own issues over the course of the show.

Yuuko Kanoe - That leads us of course, to the center that these three characters rotate around, the mournful beauty that haunts the grounds of Seikyou Academy, with no memory of her death or the life she lost, Yuuko is a surprisingly cheerful character at first blush, ecstatic that Teiichi can not only see her, but is more then happy to interact with her and be kind to her, the only person to likely do so in the sixty odd years since her death in 23 Showa (1948. Which means the show takes place in approximately 2008 if you care.) However her arc is the center of the show and she evolves beautifully as time goes on, revealing more and more shades of the complex, lonely and hurt spirit that lingers in the world of the living.

Enjoyment - 10/10
If you haven't picked up that I really liked this anime by now, I have to question what the hell you've been reading, because it's not this review.

TL:DR; Watch the anime.",1443052800,5,5613,4.52465483234714

5636016,4,B00BKBCLBY,"This anime is quite an impressive approach on Horror/Romance genre.
While the general plot and look is already a bit typical for horror anime, it has some really tense moments, such as when Yuko the heroine is haunted by her dissociative identity, filled with grudge and death. It also has some moments which visually and psychologically resembles some classics like Serial Experiments Lain. The episodes near the ending are actually different from original comic, but they are emotionally grapsing, so I'm sure they won't be so dissapointing.
It is also an interesting fact that this anime does not rely extensively on such factor like the ""name values"" of famous voice actors or creators, which is quite common in today's anime industry.
Other than that, the ED song is also awsome.
If you are satisfied with anime, you really should try reading the original comic version. Too bad there is no English version of that, though.",1432944000,,928,4.993548387096774

5636034,5,B00BKBCLBY,"Sometimes you don't want deep philosophic speculation.  You don't want convoluted storytelling, intense violence, or epic, change-the-world characters.  Sometimes, all you want is a solid love story.

And Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is one of the most beautifully executed love stories I've come across.

Dusk Maiden, first broadcast in 2012, is the story of Teiichi Niiya, a student at Seikyou Academy, who, after getting lost in one of the school's labyrinthine buildings, encounters Yuuko Kanoe, a sweet, charming, vivacious girl... who happens to be a ghost with no memory of her death.  It's not the most original premise, but it's been that there are really only a dozen or so stories--everything else is just a variation on a theme.  Dusk Maiden's success comes from its execution.

On the surface, we have a group of teenagers investigating supernatural occurrences, in particular, the mystery surrounding Yuuko's death.  This provides an opportunity to explore how stories, how fiction, can, over time and through repetition, become a kind of reality.  We might think of history as a collection of stories we accept to be true as a way of explaining the present.  One of my favorite apocryphal historical stories is that the European Renaissance began when the poet Petrarch climbed a mountain in France simply for the view.  Petrarch claimed to be the first person to do this since antiquity, and this is almost certainly inaccurate.  But it makes for a great story and does explain a new mode of thinking that came to typify the Renaissance.

Similar to its exploration of how stories create reality, Dusk Maiden also explores how belief in an idea can create a kind of reality.  Several times throughout the series, Yuuko is seen by secondary characters as a scary, monstrous creature, even though she is, in reality, a beautiful young woman.  They don't see her as a beautiful young woman because they expect to see something scary, and their conviction, their belief, causes them to see exactly that.  Is that real?  Consider a child who is afraid of monsters lurking in a darkened closet.  Are those monsters real?  No, not in any literal sense, but they are real in the sense that the fear they cause in the child is very real.

But as I said earlier, the supernatural investigations are the surface of the series.  At its heart, Dusk Maiden is a love story.  A number of reviews I've read have described Dusk Maiden as a high school romance harem story.  I find that a misleading description for two reasons.  First, although there are three woman who all have eyes for Teiichi, he never has eyes for anyone but Yuuko.  Their relationship is the center of the story, and that never wavers.  So I'm not sure how anyone can say this is harem story.  As for it being a high school romance, that is true to a certain degree.  They are teenagers and there is romance, but high school romance implies a juvenile approach to the material, and while there is a playfulness to the series, Dusk Maiden approaches the romance aspect much more maturely than other high school romance anime.  In one of my favorite scenes, Yuuko and Teiichi are sitting in an empty classroom at night and Yuuko asks Teiichi to hold her hand.  It's an innocent moment, something neither of them really puts too much thought into.  But as soon as their fingers interlace, they both have a startled reaction.  They look at their interlaced hands, they look at each other, they become embarrassed, and they turn away from each other.  It's a beautiful moment, a moving moment, a moment of intimacy that they are in no way prepared for.  They feel a spark, they share a spark, and then realize that simply holding hands is far more significant than they thought.  It's a major moment when two kids stop being kids.  They stop playing at being adults and start actually becoming adults.

And this kind of maturity can be seen throughout the series.  Teiichi does not start out in love with Yuuko.  He does not fall in love with her at first sight.  He actually likes her as a person, as a friend, first.  It's only over time that he realizes she is more than just a friend to him.

One thing that, although not atypical in the anime genre, American audiences will undoubtedly find odd is that this is a love story in which the lovers never consummate their relationship.  They never have sex.  Ordinarily, I would never even think to mention this, but the lack of sexual intimacy underscores one of the most recurrent ideas in the series:  the importance of physical contact, of touching each other.  Yuuko can be viewed as a sexually agressive woman.  She is constantly flirting with Teiichi, referencing her breasts and her physical appearance, always asking to be touched, frequently stripping in Teiichi's presence, and all of this does suggest a willingness to be in a sexual relationship.  But more than that, it reinforces that Yuuko is a woman starved of physical contact.  As she explains, she can only interact with people who are aware of her presence, and most people aren't, so what can be seen as sexual aggression really is a woman being excited at having found a man who can touch her and in not adversed to touching her.  She's on cloud nine because she's no longer alone.

That's not to say that Yuuko is an angel all of the time.  She does display a number of traits typical to young people in love.  She becomes very jealous at the attention given to Teiichi by the other girls of the series.  She can be moody at times, and she frequently worries how Teiichi views her.  All of those are very human characteristics.  Yuuko displays an almost excess of self-confidence but also shares the same doubts as almost anyone else.

The secondary characters deserve mention because they feel like they belong in the series.  Kirie serves as a kind of voice of reason, that friend who always sees and understands more of what's going on than you do and wants you to see it and understand it, too--and then gets frustrated when you don't.  She also has one of my favorite lines:  ""Maybe I'll just go drink some milk.""  Okonogi serves as comic relief.  Her reactions to almost everything are wildly over-the-top, but unlike the over-the-top humor of the servants in Black Butler, which was so annoying and distracting that it actually ruined the viewing experience, Okonogi serves as a pleasant break, a brief reminder to the audience not to take everything so seriously.

The music is wonderful throughout.  The soundtrack is one of my favorite.  The themes and motifs used are simple but effectively used and very fitting.  The opening song is absolutely fantastic, without a doubt my favorite anime theme song.  In addition to it being a great song, it also fits the narrative well, unlike, for example, Ergo Proxy, which had a great song that only fit the narrative if you really stretched your interpretation of the song.

The drawing is bright and vibrant, the animation very clean.

My only real issue with Dusk Maiden is that starting with episode 6, there are post-credits scenes that are significant to the narrative and are easily missed if you're one to skip the ending credits.

Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is my favorite anime.  It's a beautifully told love story and if the climax of episode 12 doesn't have you sobbing, you are one heartless excuse for a human being.",1405036800,7,7363,4.760663507109005

Once I started watching this HD Blu-ray; however I felt something was very wrong. I couldn't figure it out at first, then I watched the net version and compared the two. Bam! It was the speed. The speed of the whole disc was messed up. The voices dragged. All of this dub crew are well known and recognizable to me, so once I listened to their familiar voices on the net version I immediately got it. I also checked the sound on the Japanese language and heard the same tell-tell dragging of vocals and the overly deep tone of the female voice actresses, which let me know for sure just bought a $50 piece of Sentai crap.  Be wary of getting anything from these guys. You will find this warning in many reviews. It really drives me nuts!!, because I really love this anime. I may try the DVD version, or I may just get what I want from Sentai off of the net and hope the company sinks. One thing is for sure.

As for the anime, the change in art styles at certain scenes really worked into the atmosphere well. Contained the macabre expected of it though some of the romance elements were a tad excessive. A good amount of humor to keep things light when they needed to be.",1397865600,,385,4.676470588235294
5636047,5,B00BKBCLBY,"This show is one of my all time favorite animations. The saturation and contrast of the colors are like no other, and the story is beautiful.

  Silver Link may have made some mistakes, both here and on other works, but this production was just breathtaking. The art is amazing, the color palette is just intense, and it is a touching romance with a little supernatural horror thrown in.

  This has fan service, and poor comedic relief, but it's nowhere near overboard. It messes with that line concerning general ecchi antics, but it's a good story and solid animation through and through.

  Look into shows like xxxHolic, Elfen Lied, and Shiki for some more interesting artistic styles, and try more by Silver Link like C3 (cube x cursed x curious), along with their more recent stuff like Non Non Biyori, Strike the Blood, and No-Rin.

*****EDIT*******

The subs are more than a little disappointing, but I won't change my rating. Certain things bothered me like:

 ""Spirited Away""  was changed to mysterious disappearances.

""The Red Man"" was changed to the Japanese pronunciation / American spelling as Akahito, meaning something like copper + man. Copper was the metal mined and Akahito was also referred to as the copper god.

""Hide-the-Demon"" was changed to ""hide-and-seek"" which killed the suspenseful mood.

Other various changes have been made to dialect, somewhat changing the feeling of the overall show, but not necessarily a misinterpretation or mistranslation.

Overall, this show is amazing. I would guess most anime buyers to have seen a fansubbed version online first, so the subs weren't a huge deal depending on which translation you connect with more.",1392768000,,1675,5.073260073260073

5636050,5,B00BKBCLBY,"Lately I have been seeing these horror genre animes and I have to say, This one is amazing! The animation is great, the music score is also breathtaking. Basic premise is a ghost who starts a paranormal club at the school where she died, and there are only two people in the entire school that can see her. Heavy with fanservice and comedy, however the plot is also a very good one. The animation coupled with the good dub and great characters make this a fast favorite of mine. Many of the scenes are filled with unbelievable background art (not typical usually) that make this series stand out among others. The story starts lighthearted and very comedic, however the dark undertones start to unveil themselves midway through and it makes this series impossible to put down. I would recommend this to anyone who is into amazing art, dark storytelling, and fanservice. Not bloody or gory (for the most part, there are some brutal scenes) but this satisfied me on many levels. Great ending too, will bring a tear to your eye!",1387497600,4,1025,4.668508287292818

5636052,5,B00BKBCLBY,"This is an engaging series, a combination mystery, ghost and love story. My GF actually cried towards the end of the series, when they are by the frozen swimming pool and later in the club room. The combination of dark humor, typical uncomfortable boy/girl anime situations make this just that much better. The animation does not have that sometimes annoying CGI feel to it, and is many times quite artistic - especially while they are recalling folk tails.

5636053,5,B00BKBCLBY,"This is a short but substantial anime that mixes supernatural/slightly harem comedy with a beautiful romance story. It is something that you feel compelled to watch in its entirety in one sitting and by the end will certainly be glad to put it on your shelf. This is the kind of anime that people need to see. It's only 12 episodes plus an OVA but it's what anime should be when people think of anime. A lot of first-timers are so off-put by the more well-known niche anime (Pokemon, Dragonball, etc.) that they don't give ones like this an honest chance. This is art to people. You can tell that a lot of thought and time were put into the story, the beautiful animation and the voice acting (Japanese). Give this one a chance and you won't regret your purchase. And if you don't cry your eyes out by episode 12 you're not human. Enjoy!

Similar great anime: Elfen Lied or This Ugly Yet Beautiful World.",1382313600,,904,4.445783132530121
5636054,5,B00BKBCLBY,"Dusk Maiden of Amnesia has amazingly found its way onto my list of all time favorites.
Ghost stories, mystery, comedy and romance all wrapped up in one show is a tricky move, but it is pulled off beautifully in this series. A touch of nudity and low key innuendos nothing nasty and not in every episode.
1) The ghost stories are all great with a bit of a surprise, (I won't spoil anything).
2) Main characters are all likable and have enough development that you find yourself feeling for them.
3) The Horror part is not blood, guts and gore, but the use of dark colors, mental imagery what cant be seen and the mystery of
  each story. The Scare is on the light side.
4) The acting is amazing, even the dubbed version is full of emotional value that just grabs your heart and fills it with what the
  characters are experiencing.
5) Romance is on a new level Boy falls for a ghost, but then I don't know about these things, but when it comes to love it shouldnt
  matter if it is a person or not.
6) Those who like surprise endings will be thrilled, Those who like happy endings will be ecstatic.
I really won't to share more, but there is so many wonderful aspects that are all tied together if you say too much it could prove to be a real spoiler. Dont talk yourself out of this, it is Awesome.",1380758400,9,1297,4.252032520325203

Dusk Maiden of Amnesia ranks as my FAVORITE anime. It is a feel-good story of the old fashioned type, with a bit of ""sexy"" thrown in for good measure.

Sit back and prepare for laughs, tears and the happy ending you've been missing in life and all your other anime. THIS one has it.

Only issue I have is the first episode, starts with the paranormal already in place but they haven't even found the ghost yet who eventually forms the club. Alittle confusing besides that little hiccup it is a excellent series.",1376179200,,387,4.6231884057971016
5636061,5,B00BKBCLBY,"I was a little skeptical to get this, mostly just because I'm not usually a paranormal/ghost story anime kind of guy. I was pleasantly surprised by Dusk Maiden of Amnesia. Enough reviews have given a synopsis of the story so I won't bore everyone with those details and just skipped to what I liked and didn't like about the characters and story line.

Pros:
I really liked the mix of comedy and ghost story, at times there were some intense scenes of ""scary"" things and it was balanced nicely with the comedic moments of the show.

The plot, although short (13 episodes including the OVA which doesn't add to the story really), didn't feel overly rushed.

I liked the twists and turns the plot took, and found myself sucked into the story trying to play detective and solve the cases with the characters.

The animation was amazing in every way, it reminded me a lot of the Ef series animation. It was like art work on the screen.

The main character is pretty lovable but you really end up falling more for Yuuko.

This may or may not be a PRO for some people, but the show does have a good bit of Fan service, no nudity, but certainly a lot of accidental grabs, panty shots, and lots and lots of cleavage to go around. Personally fan service doesn't bother me, so I didn't think it took away from the story, if anything it showed some of the strange and interesting character traits you normally wouldn't have noticed.

Cons:
I didn't really like the opening or ending song at all

The Music fit the scenes okay but could have been better. (probably just nit picking about this though)

Conclusion:
Overall this is a great Anime. The characters are lovable, the animation is amazing, and the plot keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat the whole time. If you like Paranormal Anime with a little lightheartedness you'll love Dusk Maiden of Amnesia.",1375920000,2,1861,4.547904191616767
5636062,4,B00BKBCLBY,"Brought this after reading the reviews, and I must say it was pretty good. I liked the ending and the basic story line. However, after watching all the way thru, I found myself, as with some other anime sets, feeling that it just was one step away from being five stars. The characters are well developed and have depth. They also ""grab"" you and you want to follow them to the end. I'm really not sure what it was that let me down but by the end I felt sort of let down. Anyway, if you like love stories that aren't overly long and have a happy ending, you'll like this series and it's well worth checking out.",1375747200,2,610,4.177966101694915

5636065,4,B00BKBCLBY,"Dusk Maiden of Amnesia ( -- the first two kanji translate as yellow-dark, AKA twilight, the last two as second-place young girl, which for some reason emphasizes her purity, so maiden, rather than just girl. Amnesia is the English loan word. Her name is Kanoe Yuuko, and she's a ghost. She died in the school 60 years ago, and cannot remember her former life or the circumstances of her death. She understands happiness (and maybe a little jealousy), but not loneliness or hate or anger, and there's only two people who can see her. The series is about her and her living friend Taiichi, and their attempts to discover her background. Each episode reveals a little bit more -- sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes scary. It turns out that there's a ""shadow Yuuko"", of evil appearance, onto whom our Yuuko has dumped all her negative emotions, all her hate and anger and loneliness. At the end, Taiichi goes back through the memories of shadow Yuuko to find that Yuuko was left in an underground shrine to die 60 years ago by superstitious villagers trying to fend off a plague. He manages to convince the two Yuuko's to merge, and out comes a well-rounded ghost, capable of a full range of emotions, free to move on to the next plane of existence.

This is a very good anime, with an equal balance of fun and horror. The flashback scenes are particularly well handled -- the viewer is riding in the head of the subject, and can't close his eyes or look away or change anything. While it's a horror anime, Dusk Maiden saves the horror and creepiness for those specific moments when it will do the most good. Yuuko is a ghost, so she has to have died, but you don't figure out until later that her death was painful and alone, and you don't find out until near the end that it was horrific as well.

The ending is romantic and weepy.

The artwork is middling-good, very much a comic-book style. The animators saved money by using a lot of stills, but overall it works well. The American dub crew does an OK job, but come across as trying a little too hard. The DVD includes a commentary version of selected episodes, with the Japanese cast ad-libbing comments (subbed) over top of the sound track. Some people like this, but I rarely find it interesting.

Also included in the American release is a two-CD soundtrack set. The first three tracks on the first CD are various flavors of the ED: long, TV, and instrumental. The rest are one or two minute clips of incidental music. Most of that is horror related, with various combinations of heavy beats of drums, heavy beats of violins in the low register, or heavy beats of violins in high register. At times, it sounds like Shostakovitch. The second CD includes ""Requiem"", the ED for episode 10. The OP, ""Chior Jail"" is represented only by an instrumental track -- last one on CD 2.",1371772800,2,2835,4.574803149606299
5636066,5,B00BKBCLBY,"Several reviews do a good job of outlining the plot, so I will not bother.  What flaws this show has, and they are relatively minor, derive from that plot.  The first episode atarts with an extended scene that ends up being shown twice from two points of view.  Good concept but it goes on too long.  This making scenes too long happens several times.  The flow of the story across episodes falls into a familiar pattern:  first several episodes introduce concepts and characters, and sets up expectations.  Later episodes then surprise you by deviating from those expectations.  Alot of the surpises in the story did not surprise me.  The characters are very much atandard archetypes and mostly 2 dimentional with the possible exception of the ghost, Yuuko Konoe.  While yes these are all flaws, they are very minor flaws, especially since plot is not the best reason to watch this show.

The reason to watch Dusk Maiden is for the art.  It looks simply spectacular.  Every episode had scenes where I just sat back and marveled at the attention to detail, the subtle things hidden in shadows, the dowright brilliant use of colors.  Almost every trick to create mood from art is used, and it almost invariably works.  Scenes will become fuzzy, or pixelated, or the view will become small, or the characters will be standing far away, mostly seen by their vastly elongated shadows.  Shadows and furniture will form kanji.  Symbolism is everywhere.

A decent but unspectacular plot becomes so much more because of all these visual techniques.  You won't notice how the plot does not create mood all that well, because the art carries the load and does create the mood that is so important to any horror story.

The plot is better than most though far from the best, and visually this may be the best I have seen, so giving this a full 5 stars.",1370822400,2,1841,4.7115987460815045
8569908,5,B00BKBCLBY,"As I noted in my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Another/dp/B00C3JUGZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Another</a>, I am not a classic horror fan, but that doesnt mean I dislike horror stories, just that I measure them in different ways, and Im pleased to announce the discovery of an anime horror story that I really DO like: Dusk Maiden of Amnesia.

Like Another, Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is a creepy horror story set in a weird Japanese school, but the biggest difference, besides the existence of some wacky humor utterly absent from Another, is that one of the investigators, in fact the founder and president of the Paranormal Investigation Club, is a ghost, Yuko Kanoe, who has no memory of how her dead body ended up in a hidden basement of the Paranormal Investigative Club office!  However, along with the three living members: Teiichi Niiya and Kirie Kanoe who can see the ghost, and Momoe Okonogi who cannot, the club will investigate any school ghost stories until they uncover the truth.

Some horror fans might dismiss this series because of the humor involved in the love story, the stereotypical harem, and other assorted goofball antics, but there is some seriously scary activity as well; episodes 6 and 10 in particular are some of the most bone chilling and heartrending TV anime episodes Ive ever seen.  Others might criticize the last minute surprise twist ending, but from what Ive read that was also present in the not yet translated manga.  In addition the animation is largely beautiful, haunting, and occasionally horrific, and the music is extraordinary as well.

Bottom line:  If you prefer no humor, a massive body count, and a complicated central premise that makes no damn sense at all, try Another, but if you can stand a little goofiness, in the investigation of a mystery thats actually solvable, try Dusk Maiden of Amnesia.

Note: This is an extraordinarily complete set.  In addition to the 12 regular episodes + 1 OVA for which you have English voice, Japanese voice with English subtitles, and Japanese commentary with English subtitles, you also get an extended version of episode 12 with English voice or Japanese voice with English subtitles, plus 2 soundtrack CDs with 45 music pieces and a folded paper listing the CD contents in English and having the English words to 3 of the songs.
