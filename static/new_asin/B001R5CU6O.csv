3773391,5,B001R5CU6O,This is not a beginner workout. Cathe mixes it up and these are tough exercises. They get deep into your core muscles. She is a master at instruction.,1252800000,5,150,4.392857142857143
3773392,5,B001R5CU6O,"I knew I was in for a good workout when I received this in the mail. Very challenging, but you get a great workout and the price is very affordable! I am working on adding more of Cathe Friedrich DVD's to my collection. If you really want a great ab workout that won't bore you, this is the one to get!",1237766400,3,302,3.9672131147540983
3773393,4,B001R5CU6O,"I have only had the video series for a few days and have only tried about 2/3 of the workout routines, but with that said, I have enjoyed the exercises.  She gives clear explanation and demonstration of the exercises, shows alternative options for varying levels of difficulty, and allows enough time for the learner to actual perform the movement before moving on to the next exercise.  Although I am at an intermediate level, I believe this video provides options for those that are novices to experienced exercisers.  You can also gain ideas to incorporate into your own workout plan.

I also like that the video is broken into segments, which provides the exerciser the option to only do one in the series or multiple, dependent upon time constraints and type of core exercises desired.  There is also a section on the menu that provides a listing of any equipment needed based on the exercise series being perform (e.g., a mat is needed for the Pilates and Yoga core workouts).",1369180800,2,982,4.78698224852071
3773394,5,B001R5CU6O,"Ouch my Abs!! I love this DVD.  There are five sections, but my favorite section is the no equipment abs section.  I cannot believe how effective these simple moves are for toning your abs.  Especially that lower belly pouch that a lot of women get.  A definate must have in any intermediate-advanced exercisers DVD collection!",1343692800,,327,4.890909090909091
3773395,3,B001R5CU6O,"this workout fell short of the intensity I came to know from here. The workout is okay and has a variety of options for time and equipment used. It is still the same Cathe presentation, but the grunt factor from trying to push through wasn't there. I would recommend her Core Max dvd for this one.",1331510400,,297,4.321428571428571
3773396,5,B001R5CU6O,"Comprehensive, difficult ab workout that works!  You can pick from 7 different roughly 20min workouts.  Check out the clips on youtube under ""Cathe Friedrich ab circuits"".  You won't regret this, but you will feel the pain!",1304121600,,223,5.138888888888889
3773397,5,B001R5CU6O,"These are great abs exercises. Weights&plates and no equipment are two most challenging routine, though Pilates and Yoga also have great exercises. On entire DVD, 3 workouts can be done with no equipment (except mat if you have hard floor). The workouts are tough for a beginner, and suitable for advanced level. Even shorter and easier ones like Yoga based workouts have some tough exercises like leg levitation hold (with straight legs). Truly excellent DVD, and I find exercises so enjoyable that I am still not bored with them in spite of doing them regularly for quite a while. And also I like the music, different from usual workouts music, it suits me perfectly and makes the whole experience more enjoyable.",1300665600,,715,4.917355371900826
3773398,4,B001R5CU6O,"this work out is excellent for abs... you will really feel tight around the tummy after doing this. what i like is that you can do 40 mins of abs only combining 2 workouts of yoga + pilates .. or weights + balance ball. There are 6- 7 choices of different workouts (ALL ABS) which you can combine to suit your routine, making it interesting.

my only critique of the dvd (not so much the workout) would be
1. the menu, must have music off option, so that you can exercise with your own music.. i like listening to rap & the background music in most workout dvds is quite monotonous.
2. there must be a timer in the screen, helps to know how much of the workout is left to do.",1297987200,4,675,4.113636363636363
3773399,5,B001R5CU6O,"This DVD has 7 ab routines and is part of Cathe's Shock Training System (STS).  When I used this DVD as part of my first STS rotation, I didn't like it because I didn't think any of the routines were as intense as some of Cathe's other ab workouts.  Well, I have changed my mind!

I am doing a second round of STS and truly following my 1 rep max.  I'm really focusing on good form and engaging my core with every weight routine.  This makes all the difference in the world! As I now do these ab routines, I'm really feeling them.

The 7 ab routines:

*Yoga-inspired abs
*Pilates-inspired abs
*Weights and plates abs
*Stability ball abs
*No-equipment abs
*Medicine ball abs
*Medicine ball abs with a partner.

My favorite routines are the no-equipment and the weights and plates.  They are the toughest routines on this DVD.

My least favorite was the yoga-inspired ab routine.  I thought Cathe did way too many of the side planks in this one; I wished she had included some other yoga-based ab exercises.

I highly recommend this DVD for those wanting some tough ab workouts.  With the different routines you will never get bored!",1292025600,5,1131,4.567164179104478
3773400,5,B001R5CU6O,I really like Cathe's videos and am pleased with the Ab Circuits DVD. I sometimes use one of the ab workouts on the dvd after my upper/lower body workout.  I have a couple friends that come over and workout with me.  We are middle aged but have been working out for about 10 yrs.  The exercises on the dvd are excellent.  I especially like the one with the medicine ball and bonus partner routine.  I struggle with the weights and plates routine as it is very challenging.  I would recommend this video to anyone that is looking for a quick ab routine or one to do at the end of your upper/lower body work out or cardio.  It would have been nice for there to have been a stretch segment on the dvd but since there's not I just stretch on my own.,1288569600,,745,4.1678321678321675
3773401,5,B001R5CU6O,"I have worked out my whole life--since the age of 8 or so, I am going on 45 and it is harder now for me to keep my abs the way I would like them.  With the help of Cathe Friedrich's ab routines you will have the abs of a 20 year old.  It does not take long to be able to do the entire routine.  I saw her routine on Fit TV and kept doing it from my recorded version, it got old stopping to fast forward through the commercials...  I have 2 of her DVDs I bought together, Core Max is my favorite of the 2 DVDs, even though this one is awesome as well.  No excuses ladies--or men, I had a total hysterectomy a few years ago with the huge cut across my lower abs and also have chronic pain and fibromyalgia.  If I can do it, you can too!",1271203200,2,734,3.764705882352941
3773402,5,B001R5CU6O,"I got this DVD when I ordered Cathe F.'s entire STS series -- and it is seriously the hardest ab DVD I have (out of about 125+ workout DVD's that I own).  You definitely want to be a more intermediate or advanced exerciser for this one; if you're just starting out or want something a bit easier, then I'd recommend Cathe's Core Max, which is also great.

That being said, this is an amazing DVD that has a great variety of options.  Just be warned that you will need some equipment if you plan on doing all seven workouts: a stability ball, a medicine ball, some ankle weights, and some Gliding Disks or Val Slides.

Great workouts from Cathe!",1255651200,11,644,4.38655462184874
8337376,5,B001R5CU6O,"I love cathe, what can I say - she is the best in the business and this does not disappoint.  I bought it along with the STS program and I am very happy with it.  It has 5 completely different ab workouts and they are all advanced.  I'm a personal trainer and advanced exerciser and still found some of it a challenge (especially 1 legged pikes on the stability ball.....whattttt? Lol.  Something to work up to).  If you're a beginner you can definitely benefit as well, she does provide modifications and her form is always excellent.",1527120000,,535,4.53125
8337377,5,B001R5CU6O,This has multiple ab workouts utilizing different equipment and principles.  All are very challenging and very effective.  Beginners can start with no equipment abs and move up to plates and weights abs which I believe is the most challenging.,1494115200,,243,5.205128205128205
8337378,4,B001R5CU6O,"I loved the variety on this DVD even though I have mixed feelings about a few segments.  If you are looking for add-on abs this is perfect since it gives you yoga, pilates, discs/weights, a stability ball routine, non-weighted, medicine ball workouts, etc.  The only two I have not tried are the ones incorporating the medicine ball as I don't have the equipment and the other that requires a partner.  Most of Cathe's newest videos include bonus abdominal exercises, however, which to me is adequate.  But for anyone that wants more as far as abs go or a video that is stand alone and specifically targets the abs it's great.

I didn't have the weights for the disc/weights portion but I was still worked and the disc moves were tough.  I did like that Cathe didn't do much that hit the tailbone too hard (a gripe I have in her latest videos) and the discs were definitely a challenge.  The stability ball segment was similar; the first few exercises were relatively easy but once she had you balancing on the ball and trying to pull the ball in and do pikes it was not easy.  I couldn't do the pikes.  The yoga was great but not too intense unless you're new to yoga poses.

I bought this as a supplement to other DVDs if I didn't feel I got enough abdominal work; it's worth it for that alone or for a day that you just want to concentrate on your core without killing your back or tailbone.  As I noted above most of Cathe's newest workouts include a challenging abdominal bonus but a lot of the exercises do cause strain (at least on my part).

All in all I would recommend this highly for anyone who wants semi-intense core work.  After hurting my tailbone and lower back doing Cathe's recent videos I reach for this DVD often.  It's gentler but still gives you results and some of the exercises are something that will take a bit to work up to (i.e. the pikes).",1464048000,,1868,4.408163265306122

This is a rocking awesome workout DVD! The stability ball workout is so hard and AWESOME! :) This DVD does require quite a bit of equipment though, so be sure you are ready to make that investment before you buy it. :) Enjoy.
