8109578,5,B000EGZ1KE,"I used to watch these movies as a kid, I loved them. we had the entire collection. Of course the animation is not to todays standards, but the story and the lesson is still there. I learned a lot and the information came in handy later on in seminary. All 6 of us used to watch these every sunday and enjoy them over and over. MY children now love and watch them it entertains them the whole way through, I now and trying to replace the whole set for my children to enjoy and learn more about The Book of Mormon.",1260057600,,512,4.079207920792079
8109579,1,B000EGZ1KE,"I warn you now, do not buy any of these movies! Of course we all want to teach our kids the right principles, and we read stories to our children from the Book of Mormon and Bible, but these movies are a joke. Whatever you do, do not get sucked in to the Living Scriptures deal. You'll realize very quickly that you will be paying for years for horrible movies. The scripts are not bad, the music is actually pretty good, but the animation... oh, dear, the deplorable animation! It can't keep my 3-year-old son's attention for more than a couple of minutes. DO. NOT. BUY.",1205884800,,571,4.39622641509434
8109580,5,B000EGZ1KE,I remember serving a mission and using these stories as a reference to describe the stories of events in the book of mormon. Entertaining and well animated. Worthy of the money.,1187827200,3,177,4.741935483870968
