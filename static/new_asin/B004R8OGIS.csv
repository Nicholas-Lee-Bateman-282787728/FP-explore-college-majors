This little gem is from Brillante Mendoza (The Masseur, Kintay, Serbis) who teams up with Coco Martin who he worked with on The Masseur and the highly talented Nathan Lopez who starred in `The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blossoming-of-Maximo-Oliveros/dp/B000Q677HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros</a>

The film starts with a police raid on part of the slums and shacks of `Asia's sin city' Manila' as the cover calls it. We are taken on a tour of all the colourful low life who all have something to hide as the police do their round up. The chaos that ensues carries on through out the film.

All of the players in this movie are up to some sort of scam but look out for each other in so many ways. The camera work is that hand held not so steady camcorder feel along with several fixed hidden cameras and this gives it a real feeling of documentary. It was filmed during the Quiapo Feast of San Nazereno, against a backdrop of elections in which all of the candidates are trying to buy votes in any way they can.

There are several characters that run through this but it also has the feeling of a chaotic and frenetic docudrama that catches events as they unfold. This is mixed with a healthy dollop of humour. As an insight into the seedy underbelly of Manila this is an eye opener revelling in life at the wrong end of society yet seeing the positives in petty thugs, robbers, corrupt police, politicians and street chancers. I ruddy well enjoyed every minute, the language is Tagalog with English subtitles, and you will be surprised by the amount of English that Tagalog actually contains. Presented by Peccadillo pictures this is yet another one of their great finds.",1306627200,,1923,4.8567073170731705
