Robert Davi is convincing in his leading role as a tough yet mysterious hero.
Unfortunately, my man Ralph Moeller is not used the way way he should have been. With his height and muscular build, he should have been the lead character. The director placed Robert Davi in the lead. I will admit, Robert Davi is a good actor.

My concern is that Ralph Moeller is not able to show his acting or athletic skills on film because of poor scripts that he is given. Moeller and Piper are very charasmatic and athletic yet they both played minimal, submissive, and under-developed roles which I found dissapointing in this film. Piper and Moeller were not shown enough and neither had good character development or involvement in the main plot of this movie.

Despite this issue, the film is worth watching for Ralph Moeller's fight scene and Roddy Pipper's charisma and sense of humor.
Just be aware that both Piper and Moeller are not used as much as they should have been.
This is a four star movie-",1220313600,,1137,4.596059113300493
