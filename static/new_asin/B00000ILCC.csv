7910716,5,B00000ILCC,"The final ending to Dirty Pair is a great one. It involves a trucking insident. The dub is real good in it. The music is a nice 80's mix. The animation is old-school, but way cool. The action is great. Theres no graphic violence, but it seems every couple of minutes someone gets incinerated. Overall, Dirty Pair is a classic title and I've never seen a greater appreciation for the bazooka since Blue Seed. Get this video and see the original Dirty Pair. You won't be dissapointed.",980380800,,482,4.551724137931035
7910717,4,B00000ILCC,"Breezy action and humor are what draw some people to the Dirty Pair series but the first episode on this tape goes into somewhat somber territory. Trouble Consultants Kei and Yuri are sent to a planet where a long-running civil war seemed like it was starting to come to an end. Hostilites have flared up as five black-clad commandos have been shooting up the rebel faction and blame has been pinned on the government. The same government has called in the two Consultants to prove that the mystery men are not government agents. A shocking discovery is made in the jungle and at the end, Kei and Yuri engage in a rather dark ending.
Episode 10 is more traditional as the duo pose as independent truckers to see if a shipping company is trying to muscle out the independent haulers along a profitable interstellar trade route. A trucker with a secret and his protege help the ladies out while dodging firepower.
More of the same wholesome retro-80's anime goodness found through the preceeding volumes and recommended to anyone up for a little action and humor.",977616000,,1061,4.7405405405405405
