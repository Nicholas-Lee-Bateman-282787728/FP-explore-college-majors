5074281,1,B007BR5SH0,"What is going on in Bollywood these past few years that they are turning out Western influenced rom-com junk for their impoverished Indian masses. Yet another copycat of many recent Bolly scripts where Indian actors come to the USA (sometimes it's Canada) and almost always showcasing NY, LA or Las Vegas. The usual dysfunctional romantic-comedy trysts while pursuing the American success dream of materialism, glamor, selfish or self-centered ostentatious wealth display, etc. Of course, always blended in is a bit of ""finding yourself"" escapism. The usual stereotypes (although, not that untrue) of American infatuation with fast food & junk food; shopping; buying bigger cars, houses, .etc than are really needed; an obsessed Indian interpretation of American need of grooming and pimping for attention. They seem enamored with our ""Mall of America"" mentality and, appropriately, the 20 tons per day of waste it generates. They've even adopted the money making movie hook of more sex innuendo (although tamer than even prime time TV) to their scripts despite Indian censorship.

Acting was nearly non-existent and even the Bolly staple of music dance interludes was of fast forward quickly quality.",1346630400,5,1201,5.422459893048129
