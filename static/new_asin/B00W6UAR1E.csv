8712370,3,B00W6UAR1E,"I might have bought this box set, but the first reviewer gave all George Raft fans an important clue as to the source by mentioning the Spanish subtitles on ""Nob Hill."" A little research turned up the fact that all of the movies included in this set are on YouTube.com, where they can be watched at no cost. It doesn't take a genius to figure out they were downloaded from that site. For shame!",1522713600,,394,4.337837837837838
8712371,3,B00W6UAR1E,"This set while cheaper than buying the films separately was disappointing. The subtitles could not be removed on four of the five films.  The only exception was Race Street.  On Whistle Stop you could not get English at all.  On nocturne, the volume was extremely low.  There were slight flaws in some of the films.  Unless you speak Spanish,  I advise skipping this set.  All films can be purchased on Warner Archives separately which of course would be more expensive but with better quality and  in  English.  I would return it for refund, but there could be a problem since it comes from Spain.",1469059200,,598,4.663461538461538
