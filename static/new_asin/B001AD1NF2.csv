8277161,4,B001AD1NF2,"(LABYRINTH - 1959 - Nadja Tiller, Peter Van Eyck, Hannah Wieder Nicole Badal, Amedeo Nazarri.) Apparently a German production, this one's an odd, bizarre and near-brilliant film about a collection of mental misfits in an otherworldly sanitarium. Nadja Tiller (whose performance is great and is quite the looker) is an alcoholic poet battling past trauma and amnesia, heading for the express lane to madness. Peter Van Eyck, also an alcoholic, is the handsome, affluent artist and socialite who befriends her, though she's suspicious of his motives, ties and seemingly free-reign within the sanitarium. Hannah Wieder, however, almost steals the show as the petite blonde sex kitten nymphomaniac who's constantly attempting suicide. There are many bits of brilliance in this outstanding film, from the German expressionistic, almost Fritz Lang-like set construction and visuals, to the Fellini-esque characters and their aberrant behavior. It wouldn't benefit anyone to reveal more details than this, but if you're a cult cinephile of any kind, you should give this one a try. The only thing prohibiting me from giving this flick five stars is the commonplace finale - after all the weird goings-on, the last thing I expected was a routine ending. (But it was still the 50's; if this was made a few years later, I'm wagering the outcome would have been dramatically different. Regardless of this criticism, give this one a shot when you're feeling adventurous and desiring something different).",1303776000,7,1492,5.326271186440678
