969172,4,6305127654,"This boxoffice failure is actually quite a good mystery thriller. I'd say it was doomed to fail for a number of reasons. Considering the median age of the principle players, the title ""Twilight"" may have given it an unintended negative connotation. It was oddly refreshing to see that the veteran cast and its director, Robert Benton, can make an R rated film with as much gusto as the younger generation. Still, young filmgoers are often turned off by movies starring anyone older than Leonardo DiCaprio, who is 22. Older audiences may have been unprepared for its graphic nature.
Also, this type of picture is no longer vogue. While it is suspenseful and deals in a mystery, the subplot is the subject of how people handle their emotions when caught in a moral dilemma. Such kinds of films have been popular off and on since Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" [1943]. That's the classic in which poor, dimwitted insurance salesman Fred McMurray is seduced by the inimitable Barbara Stanwyck into killing her husband for the life insurance policy McMurray sold him. His infatuation with Stanwyck does not prevent him from knowing that his actions are totally immoral.
Paul Newman plays a down on his luck private eye who is shot in the leg while retrieving a runaway, underaged daughter from a Caribbean island. As a result, he is invited to live on the estate of the girl's parents, two over the hill movie stars played by Susan Saradon and Gene Hackman.
For the first couple of years he is there, things run fairly well. He becomes a close friend to both stars. Of course, his relationship with the daughter is pretty chilly. Even though it was an accident, she was the who shot him.
Then, certain things happen which are cause for alarm. As the events unfold, Sarandon and Hackman begin to appear in a different light. Did they really do what we begin to suspect they did? If so, are they truly that evil? How does Newman react when the goings on involve his best friends, people who have been extraordinarily gracious and helpful towards him?
I was fascinated when I watched the interaction between these and other characters. Between them, the three stars have made 199 movies. They can tell us more in a shifting of the eyes or a slight change in facial expression than stars in training can do in two minutes of screen time. By in training, I mean that, at the very beginning of their careers, these three were no different from the newest stars of today.
Robert Benton is an extraordinary writer and director. As I have stated before, producer Scott Rudin has an exceptional pattern of alternating between small films like this one and big budget ones. The one he produced right after this one was ""The Truman Show"".
Since this is such and extraordinary cast, with an equally brilliant director, I made a list of some of their best movies:
ROBERT BENTON [wrote and/or directed] - Places in the Heart [1984], Kramer vs. Kramer [1979], What's up, Doc? [1972], The Late Show [1977], Bonnie and Clyde [1967].
PAUL NEWMAN - Mr. and Mrs. Bridge [1990], The Color of Money [1986], The Sting [1973], Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid [1969], Cool Hand Luke [1967], Hud [1963], The Hustler [1962].
SUSAN SARANDON - Bob Roberts [1992], Thelma and Louise [1991], White Palace [1991], Bull Durham [1988], The Witches of Eastwick [1987].
GENE HACKMAN - Get Shorty [1995], Crimson Tide [1995], Unforgiven [1992], No Way Out [1987], Reds [1981], The Conversation [1974], The French Connection [1971].",1017273600,2,3494,4.815307820299501
969173,5,6305127654,"Once again, director Robert Benton and novelist & screenwriter Richard Russo (who previously collaborated on the equally wonderful Nobody's Fool, based on Russo's novel) team up, this time for a mystery about the past coming back to haunt you.
They don't make 'em like this anymore, but they should. Benton and Russo show up all the flashy, MTV and explosion-obsessed directors and in the process prove that good storytelling and good acting can still win out.
And you don't have to take my word for it--John Simon, former film critic for National Review, waxed rhapsodic over this & he never likes *anything*.
This film has a once-in-a-lifetime cast--naturally, Newman, Sarandon, and Hackman are of course brilliant, but so are James Garner, Reese Witherspoon, Stockard Channing, and Giancarlo Esposito as a nervous cop. Add in the rich photography and you've a mystery as twisted as San Francisco's back streets. This is one old-fashioned, new-fangled noir you don't want to miss.",1014681600,3,982,5.182389937106918
969174,4,6305127654,This is a return to the old style detective story of the 40s and 50s.  Paul Newman is a down-and-out ex-police officer/ex-private investigator who is asked by his best friend to delivery a package for him.  What ensues is a fairly predictable but none-the-less fun movie.,975196800,,271,4.869565217391305
969175,4,6305127654,"Twilight is basically a tribute to Ross MacDonald, with Newman playing an older version of the world weary private eye he portrayed in The Drowning Pool. But the script is literate and intelligent, the direction is laudably  straightforward, and the cast -- Newman, Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon,  James Garner, Stockard Channing, Liev Schrieber -- is to die for.
Despite  the star power on display, Garner steals the movie with a wonderfully  understated performance. His last scene with Newman is heart-breaking, and  Garner brings to it a dignity that matches Newman's own.
Not the most  action-packed thriller of the last few years, but one of the best.",961977600,9,656,5.1415094339622645
969176,4,6305127654,"Twilight is like an NBC Sunday Night TV B-movie with marquee, A-list stars.  Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, Stockard Channing, Reese Witherspoon and James Garner to name a few, not to mention the  collaboration of Robert Benton and Richard Russo (who brought Newman's '94  Oscar-nominated Nobody's Fool to screen).
Twilight not only has a  sensational cast of screen legends and actors in the making, although  Witherspoon's performance is not all that grand (despite a nude scene),  still desplays a rich, character-driven murder mystery that keeps you  intrigued until the end.  Twilight is by no means a flawless movie--it's  finale is all-too-convenient, Sarandon's material-possession battery scene  is hokey, etc.  But the old-fashioned feeling the film gives is astounding,  one in which Bogart himself indeed would feel right at home with.  It  allows the viewer with such a dialogue that you don't see often anymore,  for example the difference between what famous quote came from whom and  self-correction.  Newman's character is charming on paper but even at  seventy-five the man brings the words to utter charm, for example a scene  between Sarandon and him.
Sarandon:  Harry, a lot of women wear Bal A  Versailles!
Newman:  Yeah, but it smells different on them.
If you are  a fan of any of the film's lead stars or are in the mood for an  old-fashioned movie, this is a can't miss.  But if you are looking for  edge-of-your-seat suspense, explosions and lots of shoot-outs, you had  better buy ""Heat"" or ""One True Thing.""  The film's DVD  kind-of blows, but the preview is nice and the non-anamorphic 1.85:1  transfer is surprisingly good.",961891200,7,1666,5.131086142322097
969177,4,6305127654,"A fairly short review here. Yes it is a very laid back story and it is an old-fashioned detective story, but what's wrong with that? I rather liked the theme of old skeletons and past mistakes coming back. To be dealt with  once and for all. In contrast to so much of what passes for action movies  today I found this movie very watchable. It reminded me of Newman's other  detective films, Harper and The Drowning Pool. World weary, cynical, but  also hopeful. Pretty good. And what a treat seeing Newman, Garner, Hackman  and Sarandon all in the same movie - wow. Personally I think this movie is a  great way to pass a quiet evening or a lazy Sunday morning.",956620800,4,661,4.421487603305785

969371,3,6305127654,"Usually, my guess as to how a film ends is wrong. But viewing the 1998 detective flick TWILIGHT, I was correct in solving the mystery.  Still, TWILIGHT deserves credit for trying. Director Robert Benton succeeds in creating a 1940s-style feel in what is a modern who-done-it. Unfortunately, the film's awkward pacing occasionally rattles that mood.

You would expect TWILIGHT's climactic moment, where our hero private eye unravels the mystery, to be exciting. Instead, the film ho-hums into the conclusion.

Further distraction: lingering female nudity, namely Reese Witherspoon and what appears to be a body double for Susan Sarandon. Sorry, I just can't pay attention to the story with a fetching lass such as Ms. Witherspoon romping around topless. (Ms. Sarandon sure has done her share of nude scenes without a body double, though. In her 1970 debut movie, JOE, she was completely undressed within two minutes of her first scene. She's worked hard for the money ever since.)

Then there's Paul Newman and James Garner playing retired cops who moonlight as private detectives. If you read the TWILIGHT script, you would expect men in their 50s in the role. But Misters Newman and Garner look their 70 years of age.

Nonetheless, Newman carries TWILIGHT. His famous blue eyes and soft-spoken demeanor command attention. Actress Stockard Channing, strong in a small supporting role, also helps you forget some of TWILIGHT's flaws.

I'd rather recommend TWILIGHT for its effort than knock it for its shortcomings.  It is awkward to rate the arts as the experience is as much what you take to them as what they are, but I give TWILIGHT two and a half stars, rounded off to three.",1468540800,,1679,5.017985611510792

969374,5,6305127654,"So why should you see this?  Because noir has seldom been done at such a high level of skill.  The script is intelligent (where else will you find noir figures debating the specificities of a Samuel Johnson quote?), the acting superb, the faithfulness to genre absolute.

The cast is stellar: Newman, Sarandon, Hackman, Reese Witherspoon, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Giancarlo Esposito (of Homicide), Liev Schreiber, John Spencer, M. Emmet Walsh and last but certainly not least, Margo Martindale (Justifieds Mags).

Newman plays a former cop/former PI who lives with two aging Hollywood stars (Sarandon and Hackman).  Someone is blackmailing Hackmans character and he (Jack Ames) asks Harry Ross (Newman) to be the bagman.  Newman walks into one bloody scene after another and realizes that he is caught within the web of a 20 year-old murder case.  He must solve it in order to demonstrate his own innocence, even though the solution could destroy the set of human relationships which hold his frail life together.

The key to noir is not just the spare dialogue, the presence of a femme fatale or two, the actions of a loner within a larger system; it is the gray morality that leaves us with a bitter taste in our mouth, the hunger for a faint bit of hope in a perhaps-empty universe and the need for human contact in a world of greed, materialism and pitiless violence: tragedy among the false kings and queens.

The story is deliberate (some will say slow) and allows us plenty of time to absorb the dialogue and the performances.  The casting is inspired.  If there is a single element that fails to equal the other dimensions of the film, it is the score, but the score is purposely understated and any attempts to highlight and foreground it would immediately have drawn negative comparisons with The Godfather, Chinatown or other absolute masterpieces.  It would have made this film appear hyperbolic rather than a lovely little gem.

This is an often overlooked film that deserves greater attention.",1442880000,,2015,4.943620178041543

969462,4,6305127654,"The movies and bookstores are filled (and have always been filled) with all kinds of private detectives, hardboiled guys like Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe in the old days, oh yeah, Nick and Nora Charles too, old days that is, fetching female detectives, young guys and gals starting out in the profession, gumshoe types too who spill coffee over themselves on stake-outs and smoke far too many cigarettes. Yeah, a whole litany of types from languid shamuses to keyhole peepers doing the best they can. Harry Ross (played by Paul Newman) in the film under review, Twilight, is one of those guys, one of those PIs, who has lost a step or two, maybe is not as hungry to see the bad guys put down, maybe not as hungry to see himself put them down like in his youth, but when the deal went down all his shattered detective instincts rose to the top, almost. Not bad for a guy who did not even bother to renew his PI license with the Los Angeles police, not bad at all.

Like a lot of guys who turn PI Harry started out as a public cop, did his time, and to help while away the retirement hours went PI, did a few cases and that was that. Well not quite that was that because his last case went awry on him. He was hired by Jack (played by Gene Hackman) and Catherine Ames (played by Susan Sarandon) to find their errant under-aged daughter who had run off with a sleazebag guy to sunny Mexico. Naturally Harry found them shacked up in a resort (hell of course he found them after all he was a good PI in his time and they did leave a trail of bread crumbs behind them). When Harry tried to take her back boyfriend, sleaze or not, seeing his meal ticket go down the tubes threw some fist, and the daughter, Mel (played by a young Reese Witherspoon) shot poor Harry accidently. Not good PR for a PI, no question.

Somehow that blow-out got Harry room and board at the Ames residence, they, Jack and Catherine, maybe you remember them if you are old enough, had lit up the screen in their younger days but now were on cheap street, or heading there what with the big overhead of running a La La house, keeping tabs on that errant teenage daughter and paying out of pocket medical bills for Jack (he had cancer). Of course in the movies you cant just have an old PI retire and sit around the pool all day drinking some guys gin (or ginger ale in Harrys case since he was drying out) so Jack asked Harry run an errand for him, an errand involving sending some hush money to a woman up in the Hollywood hills from the look of it when he got there, straight from cheap street.

See Jack in his vindictive fatherly way had that sleazebag boyfriend of Mels picked up and jailed for transporting a minor, you know the scoop, and he was looking for a payout to keep quiet about things he knew, or thought he knew about the mysterious fate of Catherines ex-husband who got lost in the mist of time some twenty years before. That missing person thing turned out to be very convenient for this pair of movie stars since they could get married once that ex was assumed to have given up the ghost.

Before Harry could do that simple errand though he ran into another PI who had been shot and killed, murdered, in that womans house by a party, or parties, unknown and that set off a whole string of events that led back to that twenty-year old case since that dead PI (an ex-cop too) strongly suspected he had been a victim of foul play. Of course when a dame (or dames) is involved you know, or you should be presumed to know in any noir-ish film, there will be plenty of treachery and a few more off-hand murders (of that boyfriend and his lady-friend parole officer) before the mystery is solved. You also know old dog Harry (after all this is blue-eyed Paul Newman we are talking about even in his twilight) had drawn a bee-line for Catherine. Bee-line or not Harry was determined to solve this one no matter who he went to bed with, whose house he had been staying at and who actually shot that ex-husband in the head and buried him out in the desert. Here though is where the aging PI not so hungry for justice whatever the cost comes in. After a little shoot-out with a co-conspirator of the Ames, an ex-cop Raymond (played by James Garner), everybody walked. Ill bet old Bridget in The Maltese Falcon wished that she had Harry around then to twirl around her finger instead of Sam Spade who turned her over, turned her over even though every part of him did not want to. Yeah, aging PIs work differently, very differently.",1423353600,,4508,4.337677725118484

969529,3,6305127654,"TWILIGHT, 1998, 94 minutes.  A surprisingly little-known and appreciated Los Angeles set film noir, a small tight crime/drama/mystery  that can boast  an all-star cast both before and behind the camera.  And that gave good parts to a lot of good actors in their twilight years.  Harry Ross (Paul Newman) is a retired cop and  private eye who's living out his golden years in the house of two fading movie stars -- Catherine (Susan Sarandon) and Jack Ames (Gene Hackman). But his life gets complicated when he uncovers clues to a long-unsolved murder in this smart and stylish mystery directed by Robert Benton, (KRAMER V. KRAMER, BONNIE AND CLYDE, NOBODYS FOOL); written by Benton and Richard Russo, who also penned EMPIRE FALLS and NOBODYS FOOL for Newman.

The near-legendary, Oscar-winning Newman, (COOL HAND LUKE, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, THE STING) carries the picture as manfully as ever he did in his long career.  And his two-handed scenes with the Oscar-winning Hackman, (UNFORGIVEN, THE FRENCH CONNECTION), and Sarandon, (THELMA AND LOUISE, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, THE LOVELY BONES), should be required viewing in all the worlds acting classes.  Other stars include Reese Witherspoon as Mel Ames, the couples lissome daughter.  Stockard Channing as Lt. Verna Hollander, former colleague  and loverof Rosss.  The recently passed James Garner as Raymond Hope, another former Hollywood cop and fixer to the stars.  Also Giancarlo Esposito as Reuben Escobar, Liev Schreiber as Jeff Willis, Margo Martindale as Gloria Lamar, John Spencer as Capt. Phil Egan and M. Emmet Walsh as another former cop, Lester Ivar.  Thats a lot of firepower for a little-known film, all present occupy their roles fully; and all their two-handed, three-handed scenes are models of witty economy.

Los Angeles looks beautiful and threatening in its fecundity that reminds that every living thing must die, as, indeed, Jack Ames is dying of cancer.  But, before his friend goes, the old cop Ross wants to find out what happened to Sullivan, Catherines former husband, who had simply conveniently disappeared just at the right time twenty years ago.  Rosss investigations uncover a complex, intelligent quiet mystery of the kind you don't often see any more. Not a single car chase, no computer generation.  Well, film critics much more knowledgeable than I say that modern, full-color would-be films noir must be set in L.A.  see CHINATOWNto work.  And heres another L.A. noir to prove them right.

This film is 16 Years old, and half of these actors are near or over the hill. The rest are mature actors today. The real surprise was to find Margo Martindale in a blonde wig playing a mall. Harry, played by Paul Newman , is  a cop,private investigator, drunk, husband, father. He has failed at all of those, and now, sober, broke, single and retired, he lives on the estate of Jack and Catherine Ames, played by Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon. They are movie stars who are old friends.  Harry does errands for Jack and gets into big trouble. The entire film surrounds the death of Catherine's first husband.

Essentially Harry Ross (another H for Newman,in the tradition of Hud,Harper,Cool Hand Luke,The Hustlrt etc) is Lew Harper,only beaten down and worn out. I see the film as a continuation of the story,which makes in more enjoyable. Not to mention the private eyes of both films have a similiar sense of humor. The film by itself has humor,and enough story and atmosphere to be enjoyable,despite an ending that doesnt quite measure up...its like buying store brand cola instead of name brand soda. It works but,its not the best.
If your a Paul Newman fan,or like a good mystery...then you most likely won't regret this purchase. The supporting cast is not only recognizable,but a group of solid actors. The film noir style is brisk,and ill just say it again...take it as Harpers ""Twilight""...and one of Paul Newmans last 'lead' roles.",1350864000,3,1182,5.00507614213198

performance), and his aging friends, lovers and clients (Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon,
James Garner, all doing admirable work) touching, sweet, funny, sad, and an enjoyable
noir mystery to boot.

Its not that the plotting is that brilliant, or the story that novel, but this is really more
about the characters than the mystery anyway.  Its about aging and loss and trying to
hold onto your pride and self-esteem in the face of the indignities later life. In all that
it has much in common with Benton""s earlier, very good ""Late Show"", but for me this had
even more depth and resonance (perhaps reflective of Benton""s own aging?).",1327881600,2,722,4.861788617886178

Mit den blichen Zutaten: entlaufene Tochter des Chefs zurckholen, einen Umschlag abliefern und berall gibt es Leichen. Geheimtreffen, Beobachtungen etc., der Detektiv kriegt auf die Ohren. Es entsteht eine ganz unaufdringliche Spannung. Das liegt vor allem an den vier Altstars: Sarandon, Hackman, Garner und Newman. Die glnzen immer noch und versprhen Witz und Charme. Vor allem aber sind sie supercool.
Paul Newman bildet den Mittelpunkt, um den sich alles dreht. Er lenkt auch die Diskussionen und somit geht Benton einen Schritt weiter als die alten Vorbilder. Er zeigt nicht nur einfach die Guten und die Bsen, sondern er schildert Menschen, die hassen und lieben, tten und rauben. Dieser menschliche Faktor fhrt auch dazu, dass ber Recht und Unrecht, ber Wahrheit und Lge diskutiert wird. So ist es auch ungewhnlich, dass ein Mord aufgeklrt werden soll nur als Wiedergutmachung. Und nachdem fast jede Figur entzaubert worden ist, bis auf den eigentlichen Bsewicht - und das ist Newmans guter alter Freund - gibt es ein Finale mit einer berraschenden Auflsung.

969703,4,6305127654,"When I first saw Twilight in 1998 I knew I was watching a valuable classic. We need a few more like Twilight these days to add intelligence that recent movies with action and adventure lack.  We need less high-tech-special-affects and more intriguing dialogue which includes humor, wit and wisdom that Twilight provides in abundance.
Listing the cast only was enough for me to go see the film : Paul Newman,
Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, Stockard Channing, and with a
supporting cast of not-so-well-known actors who add to Twilight's appeal.
Among them (is/was) the late John Spencer, best known as the president's
secretary or chief aid in the TV series West End. Also, Reese Witherspoon
got an opportunity in this film playing the prodigal daughter of
Hackman/Sarandon. There are a few others who play character parts too.
I like the sophisticated decadence of Hollywood which Twilight so cleverly portrays with its sex, money, murder and cover-ups that are unearthed by Paul Newman, playing an aging ex-cop turned private-eye  which implicate friends and foes alike.
Here is a movie about old friendships, soon to be lost lives, and lost
illusions about life and love, that, in my opinion, make Twilight a modern classic for some soon-to-be ""late"" actors we have learned to love so much over the past fifty years.",1227312000,4,1330,5.040909090909091
969704,5,6305127654,"The plot is a standard one.  Our private detective, Harry Ross, makes a simple delivery for a friend and discovers a murder.  Then he discovers several more.  The police suspect him, but let him go.  He wades through the confusion, taking the occasional beating.  Finally, he solves the mystery.  Then re-solves it.  We've seen the plot before.  But this movie isn't great because of the plot.  It's the characters.

Excepting a very young Reese Witherspoon, the main characters are all...old.  Paul Newman, Gene Hackman, and James Garner are seasoned actors who know their craft and themselves through decades of experience.  They use this knowledge to bring a world-weary, knowing depth to their characters.  Not-so-old Susan Sarandon and Stockard Channing also invest their characters with this depth of years, their beauty undiminished by it.  These people have lived complex lives and learned something from them.  They know who they are.

They know each other, too.  You can hear it in how they talk, the abbreviated references to shared events and sadly remembered friends.  You can hear it in the silences.  There are silences of understanding, when nothing needs saying.  And there are silences of considered restraint, when something is thoughtfully left unsaid.  (""You haven't apologized to me,"" complains Gene Hackman.  ""You haven't been listening,"" Paul Newman chides in return.)

My favorite exchanges between Paul Newman and James Garner occur while they seem to be resting from previous scenes' exertions.  Their words are sometimes blunt, sometimes carefully incomplete, always casual, yet rich with reference and understated implication.  These men understand each other with fewer words than younger men use.  They haven't the energy or the need to say more.

See this movie with someone you think you know well.  It may give you something to talk about.  Or carefully not talk about.",1225411200,4,1903,5.25

This movie deserves to be watched and is a ""fun"" movie as well as an intelligent one. Susan Sarandon shines in this movie and Reese Witherspoon is a hottie in her first adult role and Stockard Channing is delightful in a small role.

Gratuitous?  Anyway, after re-gathering and re-trenching from that, I did indeed settle down into a Humphrey Bogartesque murder mystery.

Maybe the most significant mark of this film is the very heavy-duty cast . . . Paul Newman (aged like fine wine), Gene Hackman (the BEST), Susan Sarandon (hate her politics but enjoy her work, and again, a gratuitous look at her backside), James Garner (fortunately, no skin shots here), Reese Witherspoon (all of her), Stockard Channing (I don't care for her, personally, but she is a NAME).

969774,5,6305127654,"""Twilight"" is an underrated gem, a modern classic that too few people have heard of and fewer seem to have seen. I usually get blank stares when I recommend it, but hear the movie's praises once people have watched it. If you're a fan of film noir, private eyes, mysteries or the trio of lead actors (Paul Newman, Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon), ""Twilight"" should definitely take a spin in your DVD player.

It's the best ""modern-day"" film noir I've seen, and it proudly wears its noir origins on its sleeve. Whether it's Harry Ross' voice-over narration (""The door was unlocked, so I let myself in..."" as he breaks the glass panel), or the cast itself (Newman played a variation of Lew Archer in two films, and James Garner played Rockford, as well as Philip Marlowe). The Amazon.com reviewer is right on the money. ""Twilight"" could have come out of 1940s or 1950s Hollywood.

And that's another ace up its sleeve. The plot is rich, but its themes are very simple. Love, jealousy, betrayal...murder. Such a tale could have been spun by Chandler, Hammett or MacDonald, and it's refreshing in an era of thrillers that love nothing more than to chuck out the plot of the movie in favor of a ""gotcha!"" twist ending. ""Twilight"" builds to its devastating climax, with each step taking us closer to the end, and bringing that ending into focus.

It's a relatively action-lite movie, with a pair of gunfights (and even they aren't all that intense). But the mystery is the draw here...if you want shoot-outs, look elsewhere. Besides, they would only distract from the meat of the movie: the acting and the crackling dialogue. Newman is surrounded by a top-notch cast, and virtually every cast member gets a chance to verbally spar with Harry Ross. Whether it's the dangerously flirtatious midnight conversations with Susan Sarandon, or the wry musings on aging and the past with James Garner and Gene Hackman, everyone shines. Characters who only make a brief appearance (Giancarlo Esposito, the late John Spencer, a young Liev Schrieber) make strong impressions on the viewer, the perfect marriage of a strong script and talented actors.

I'll avoid a plot summary, because I think it's better to go in and watch the mystery unfold around you, but I will say that the story doesn't cheat with you. The characters are real, tangibly real, and it makes what happens to them resonate with the audience. I'd suggest a rental, but with the cheap price on Amazon (and the fact that you'll want to see it again) I recommend a purchase of ""Twilight.""",1176940800,8,2538,4.80091533180778
969775,4,6305127654,"Retired policeman, former P.I., and recovering drunk Harry Ross (Paul Newman), lives above the garage on the sequestered Los Angeles estate of his one-time employers - movie stars Jack and Catherine Ames (Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon). Jack Ames is gravely ill, and Harry is strongly attracted to Jack's immensely sympathetic wife. But matters take a dark turn when Jack asks Harry to deliver a package. Jack is being blackmailed, and Harry soon discovers that his friends' past may be darker than anyone suspects ... This rather melancholy mystery feels like an exercise in nostalgia. There's nothing wrong with that, per se - and it does suit the mortality theme - but it doesn't exactly make for enthralling viewing. Benton relies on power casting, noirish touches and good old-fashioned sensibilities to make this film exude an aura of class it doesn't quite deserve. The plot is thoroughly predictable, so it's really more a tissue of nostalgic suggestions than good storytelling. Similarly, Elmer Bernstein's languorous score deftly evokes Old Hollywood, but it isn't what the film needs (stirring music is used in the trailer to much better effect). What it lacks in narrative gusto, however, it more than makes up for in performances. Newman and Hackman are always good, and are capably supported by James Garner and Stockard Channing in solid minor roles. But Susan Sarandon is the standout as Jack's elegantly manipulative femme-fatale of a wife. She shows that if someone is ever dumb enough to mount a remake of ""Sunset Boulevard"", she's a shoo-in for the Norma Desmond part.",1148688000,5,1590,5.119230769230769
969776,5,6305127654,"Director Robert Benton has crafted a film reminiscent of the 1940's in this complex and character driven film with an ensemble cast of screen veterens and one future star in her first adult role. The mystery is engrossing and the performances are stellar as Benton shows how age and life experience sometimes shades the black and white of right and wrong to gray.

The story revolves around former P.I. Harry Ross (Paul Newman) attempting to do a favor for Jack Ames (Gene Hackman) that leads to blackmail and murder. The favor may involve Jack's beautiful wife Catherine Hayward (Susan Sarandon). A twenty year old murder comes into play as well as Harry slips back into a life he left behind when the Ames' spoiled little brat Mel (Reese Witherspoon) brought him some bad luck a few years prior on a case down in Mexico.

Newman is terrific as he reluctantly tries to fix things for everyone as the bodies pile up. It's a task that gets more difficult as he gets closer to the truth. The unspoken attraction between he and Catherine is cause for concern as well in this character driven mystery. Stockard Channing gives a nice performance as Harry's old flame Lt. Verna Hollander, and Reese Witherspoon acquits herself nicely in her first adult role.

Benton has added enough humor to the story to give it the feel of reality. This film was not designed for the teen driven box office of today but for the rest of us. It has some terrific performances from the entire cast and some true-to-life moments.

It is James Garner who truly shines as the old pal of Harry and Jack, Raymond Hope. Garner always makes it look so natural and easy his performance sometimes gets overlooked. He is really great here and the interplay between he and Newman as they discuss growing older and the events taking place are priceless. It may seem clear what happened twenty years ago but it is the relationships that drive this story and the ones that are shattered forever when Harry finally peels away the gray to reveal the black and white.

This is a fine film that subtly shows what can happen to people who become used to having everything work out for them. As Garner's character Raymond tells Harry: ""There's them, and there's us, Harry."" Benton has crafted an old style film that you won't want to miss if you're tired of the teen box office fare. It is a mature and thoughtful mystery and a meditation on friendship and growing older. This one is worth owning.",1120348800,41,2454,4.645161290322581
969777,3,6305127654,"When I looked at the cast of ""Twilight"" I had to wonder how I had managed to miss this film when it first came out.  Granted, it probably did not make it to the Zenith City when it was first released in 1998 given how few movie screens we had back then, but a movie that has Paul Newman and Gene Hackman in it should justify being rented even before you put Susan Sarandon, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Reese Witherspoon, and Liev Schreiber into the mix.  But this is really Newman's movie and it must have been a disappointment to the others that they only have a couple of scenes in which they get to act toe to toe with Newman.

Newman plays Harry Ross, one of those guys who has failed at everything in his life from husband and father to cop and private investigator, but is showing some success as a drunk, and who might have stumbled on a last chance for a small measure of redemption.  Sent by her movie star parents to retrieve young Mel Ames (Witherspoon) who ran off South of the Border with her boyfriend Jeff Willis (Schreiber), Harry has a slight mishap.  Now, several years later, he is living on the Ames estate, where Jack (Hackman) is seriously ill and Catherine (Susan) is swimming nude in the pool.  From time to time Harry is given a job to do and thinks nothing of delivering a package until somebody starts shooting at him.

The fact that the gunman already has several bullet holes in him makes things even more interesting, but that is just the start of the complications.  The police would be questioning Harry even harder, but old friend Lt. Verna Hollander (Channing) is willing to cut him some slack.  So Harry is off, hot on the trail and trying to put all the pieces together.  Harry calls Jack his best friend, but he really has more in common with Raymond Hope (Garner), who has lived the life Harry has lived but with much better results.  If there is a point where you the film clearly goes off track it is it decides not to pair up Newman with Garner (or any of his other co-stars) and have him spend most time investigating that which needs to be investigated with would be private eye Reuben Escobar (Giancarlo Esposito).

Unfortunately ""Twilight"" does not have a script as good as the cast and I cannot help thinking that they were sold on acting with each other rather than with the quality of the story.  I figured out ""who"" before I figured out ""why"" in this mystery, and you really want it to be the other way around when you are watching this kind of a movie (and becomes the reason I rounded down on the 3.5 stars this one deserves).  It is a shame that when Newman gets his best scene with one of his co-stars he has to pull a gun and shoot them.  Newman is still quite more than a shadow of his former self and the best reason to see the movie, but most fans will be disappointed with the overall quality of this one.",1114041600,4,2868,4.354596622889305

While I have never been a huge fan of detective stories, this one was fairly entertaining.  The narration is much like the famous ones from the 1940s / 1950s era.
This was the first time I've seen James Garner surface in quite awhile.  While he is pretty-much a one dimensional actor, he still possesses a decent screen-presence and keeps up with Newman and Hackman nicely.
For those viewers who would be more interested in Witherspoon, this movie is a can't miss.  To my knowledge, this is the only nude scene she has ever done.  It also happens within the first 5 minutes of the film, so you don't have to wait too long in anticipation.",1070150400,11,892,4.620253164556962
969780,4,6305127654,"Admittedly Robert Benton's neo noir ""Twilight"" suffers from leaden pacing and a script that lacks any real suspense or suprise (two invaluable ingredients in the genre). It also possesses a strange similarity to Arthur Penn's excellent ""Night Moves"" (also starring Gene Hackman).
That said, ""Twilight"" proves a most effective small film that benefits from an excellent cast playing at the top of their game.
Robert Benton has always worked wonders with an ensemble cast and ,in ""Twilight"", he continues his excellent track record as an ""actor's"" director. Benton's willingness to sit back and let some of films' greatest artists work their magic makes much of the aforementioned pacing issues almost a moot point. Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon and the always excellent and grossly underrated James Garner all turn in subtle performances here.  It really is a sheer privilage and joy watching these veteran masters spin their polished craft. A young Reece Witherspoon and Liev Schriebner also turn in fine performances.
Of course at the center of ""Twilight"" stands the beautiful artist Paul Newman. Few actors in Hollywood history have consistently turned in as many excellent peformances. Newman proves yet again that a superb actor can transcend a less than stellar script.
This is an actor's film. Anyone craving watching a concert of well tuned instruments played by masters need to look no further. None of the performances are Oscar worthy, which makes them all the more special. Sometimes the best acting occurs when the audience cannot see the wheels spinning and the strings pulling.

These things alone make TWILIGHT well worth watching if you have a brain, and are over the age of thirty. The film though delivers more than that. The plot had me guessing to the last minute, and saddened me when all was revealed.

969782,2,6305127654,"A retired PI who lives with a wealthy entertainment family finds himself involved in a mystery. A harmless errand turns into a brush with death and reveals clues to an apparent suicide two decades ago. This drama brings an all star cast, including Gene Hackman, Paul Newman, Susam Sarandon and James Garner as leads.
Twilight however, can't live up to the expectation. One of the problems is the cast itself. Of the 9 major speaking roles, 6 are over 50 years of age, making the plot feel downright elderly. The movie is somber and always serious, but the script has the actors saying and doing silly things. One has to believe that Paul Newman (the retired PD/PI) is basically inept and foolish at the beginning, but dominating and in control by the finale. That situation might be more believable in a rookie film.
But muddled characters are at home in this movie. They appear and disappear as needed, withhold information when they have no reason to, do things that defy explanation, change their loyalties with little reason or complaint. Plot devices that might seem cliche in some directors hands, seem heavyhanded or infantile in this movie. The few action sequences are filmed poorly with one notable exception. Some characters seem to have no point at all and should have been written out.  Sarandon, Schreiber and Hackman however, are exceptions and give fine performances. Too bad they had such minor roles.
The plot has major blinders on as well. For instance, Newman is found at multiple crime scenes in comprimising situations. At none of these is he given more than a stern questioning and a nasty look. The motivations of the police are ignored to better serve the mechanations of the plot. For other characters experiences are forgotten, obvious possibilities are ignored, coincidental meetings are commonplace, and the bad guys painstakingly leave a trail back to themselves for Newman. Heck, they may as well have named Reese Witherspoon's character ""Plot Device"" for all the purpose she has in the movie. Although she may have been included to attract the under 70 crowd.
By the end all of the characters are required to be so mallable and shadowy that none of them seem real, none can be trusted and you certainly cant care enough about their welfare to be concerned about the conclusion.",1025913600,,2309,4.90537084398977
