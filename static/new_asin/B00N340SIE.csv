8675915,4,B00N340SIE,"Unlike a lot of recent WM movies, this one reminded me of the original movies (from long, long ago) by Warren himself. The soundtrack was a nice mix of tunes, had a fun mix of silly bits, was a lot about the skiers and not just extreme stunts. Johnny Mosley narrates well, but lacks Warrens humor. All in all much better than the previous half dozen BigCorp WM movies.",1442016000,,368,4.3478260869565215
