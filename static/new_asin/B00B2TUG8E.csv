5553865,4,B00B2TUG8E,"Tomorrow, the rest of the world will be able to experience what I did by watching the new documentary, ""Mother India: Life through theEyes of the Orphan,"" winner of ""Best Short Documentary"" at the 2012 San Diego Christian Film Festival. At just 47 minutes, it isn't a hard film to get through, but it is hard to watch at times. The project is a labor of love from the filmmakers, David Trotter, Shawn Scheinoha and Noah Lamberth. Together, they traveled to Tenali, India in hopes of finding orphan children along the railway. Without a firm plan in place, they immediately found 25 abandoned children living together as a family with no real home. They are just a fraction of the 31 million orphans living in India despite the fact that India has been growing in wealth.

Trotter, (who is a writer, speaker and new filmmaker) Scheinoha (an entrepreneur in communications) and Lamberth (a cinematographer) wanted to tell the story of these orphans from their point of view. Narrated by Grammy Award-winning Christian singer, Rebecca St. James (who proves that she just might have found a new career to fall back on should she need it), viewers will see where these children live, what they eat, where they sleep and how they manage to keep smiles on their faces while they try to survive. Some of their stories are difficult to listen to. Some are missing limbs, some come from homes where they were beaten, and many struggle with ""bad habits"" like smoking, huffing ""white out"" and injecting unknown drugs into their bodies to make the pain go away. Some have HIV.

As depressing as that is, the story has a happy ending. The filmmakers couldn't just leave Tenali without doing something. By the end, you'll see lives changed for the better through the native ministry, Harvest India. While this is a faith-based project, the doesn't preach to the choir. In fact, it isn't preachy at all. It speaks to everyone who has a heart and provides a solution on how others can help reverse the damage that has been done. This film will inspire you and has the potential to change the world for many of these kids.",1373500800,,2104,4.7146739130434785

  Digging through the trash to find food?
  Begging for change just to survive?
  Bathing in water where animals are washed?
  Sleeping by themselves?
  Sold into slavery?

 Mother India, a new documentary narrated by Rebecca St. James, captures the lives of 25 abandoned and orphaned children living on the streets in India.

  Did you know that there are over 31 million orphans in India?

  I had no idea there were that many.  Many of them became orphans after their parents died of AIDS, or the children ran away from home because they were beaten and abused unmercifully by parents or stepparents.

  I wasn't sure what I would be viewing when I agreed to watch and review this film for you.  I knew it was a documentary, but I didn't know how graphic it would be, or how interesting I'd find it.

  I didn't need to wonder.

  Immediately, I was submerged into the daily struggle for life that a group of orphans endures.  25 courageous orphans living together as a family along the railway in Tenali, India.  No one caring about them.  No one guiding them or helping them.

  Two American men wanted to journal the life of a group of orphans, so they become a part of this group for several weeks.  They slept on dirt or concrete floors, covering themselves with filthy rags used as blankets.  They ate with this group, interviewed them and those around them.  It was actually quite fascinating.

  The horrors of what these children face every day just made me so sad.

  I'm thankful that these two gentlemen took it upon themselves to let us know what orphans' needs are in India.  It is such a challenge to rescue the orphans from a lifestyle of begging, addiction, and sexual abuse.

  Is this film appropriate for children?  Yes - older children, that is.  Parents should be aware that the film shows the raw reality of living as an abandoned and orphaned child on the streets of India. Interviews include topics of drug abuse, sexuality, violence, and HIV/AIDS.  Drug use is explicitly shown.",1367193600,,2038,4.677142857142857

5553873,4,B00B2TUG8E,"Global poverty is easy to ignore.

Until you learn its names and faces.

Mother India, a documentary, does just that, introducing viewers to a ""family"" of 25 orphans living near a train station in India. Filmmakers David Trotter and Shawn Scheinoha traveled to India for two weeks last year seeking to tell the story of life as an orphan in a country where an estimated 31 million children are considered orphans.

""Each of these young lives is much more than a statistic,"" Trotter said. ""Every one of them has a name, a face and a story.""

That's what I found valuable about this documentary-the personalization of poverty. Because as Scheinoha added, ""The bottom line is statistics go in one ear and out the other. People need to hear stories and see the reality of what it looks like for millions of Indian children who are orphaned.""

When you hear one girl describe how she was tricked into having sex for money, and you see the tears she sheds over her rescue, you can't ignore the plight of the poor and orphaned.

When you listen as another girl describes how she lost two of her fingers because of her boyfriend's jealousy, and how she still grieves the loss of a baby-""I cut myself when I remember him""-you can't go back to the way things were.

These kids, whose experiences have aged them beyond their years, are escaping the daily pain through drug use, sharing needles and dying of HIV and AIDS. They barely ""earn"" enough money begging and washing the floor of the train to eat each day.

Sometimes, the scenes are too much, and I want to forget.

But how can you look away when you've seen too much?

The filmmakers found themselves faced with this question. Their intent was to document. But when they got to know the youngest members of this group-a 3-year-old and a 7-year-old, siblings-they asked what else they could do.

Mother India is a sobering reminder of how extreme poverty is in many parts of the world. It is also a call to action to provide help for India's orphans.

5553875,4,B00B2TUG8E,"Mother India is an eye opening and heartbreaking account of the many (over 31 million) orphans living in India.  The news of orphans in India is certainly not unheard of but the 25 children living together as a family (ages 3-23) in this movie make the statistics so much more meaningful.  Their individual stories are ones of abuse, neglect, torture and abandonment.  Their days are filled with begging for money and drug use.  It's almost too terrible to imagine.  Thankfully, there is hope for some of the children through a local children's home called Harvest India.  While watching this movie my heart was broken many times.  I was touched by the way that this make-shift family of children cared for each other.  They took the filmmakers, David Trotter and Shawn Scheinoha, into their lives and shared their stories and circumstances.  David and Shawn even spend the night on the dirty streets with them.

Mother India is a short movie- only 49 minutes long.  It gets right to the point- touching your heart.  I loved watching the group of children go to Harvest India in hopes of providing a better life for the two youngest members, Polayya and Koteswari.

India has over 31 million orphans, so this film is just a brief glimpse into the lives of a handful of the orphans. Some of these kids - living in a family-type group - have no parents while others come from abusive families. Many of these children have HIV/Aids. While spending time with these children, David Trotter and Shawn Scheinoha feel lead to try to help two of the younger kids in the group, so they call on Harvest India for some help. They have some hurdles (including getting permission from the older kids in the group) to jump through to allow it to happen.

It was sad to see how these kids were living, but it was even harder seeing the drugs abuse, huffing, and physical abuse they dealt with on a regular basis. I was surprised that they actually showed the exact products and how the kids went about huffing. They also showed the kids shooting up ""something"" as the kids didn't even now what was in the syringes.

MotherIndia is not a light movie due to the topics covered, but it's done well and brings to the forefront the needs of the many orphans in India. It closes with how you can help combat the problems these kids face. If you have younger kids, you may want to preview the movie due to the content.

I was especially touched by their desire to have a normal life, to work for their money instead of begging.

This is a documentary that strikes your soul and helps you see parts of the world in a new light.

Mother India examines the plight of orphaned children in the nation of India.  There are over 31 million orphans in India, which will soon become the world's largest nation.

31 million children have either lost their parents or run away because of abuse and torture.  Their circumstances are certainly heartbreaking.  With drug use, abuse from the police and others, these children have almost no place to turn.  And they have no hope.

When three Americans journey to India to discover more about these orphans, they discover a group, much like a family, of  twenty-five abandoned kids living near the train station, and just outside of their hotel.

Joining them on the streets, these film makers follow their lives, experiencing their hardships with them, and being welcomed by them.

In the process, they discover two young children, Polayya and Koteswari, who have a chance to escape this life and start anew.  Working closely with Harvest India, these film makers succeed in providing these two children with a second chance.

Mother India is a captivating film, partnered with Harvest India and 31million, raising awareness of this crisis of orphaned and abandoned children in India.

I highly recommend that you watch this film.  But be ready for your heart to break for these children.  And after you watch, get involved in helping raise awareness and become a part of the solution.  You can sponsor kids in India, and serve in other ways with groups like 31million.

Jump in.  get involved.  You'll be glad you did.

My family and I were very touched by this eye-opening and inspiring documentary. I was in tears. Mother India was filmed in Southern India during a two-week period in early 2012 when David Trotter and Shawn Scheinoha made friends with 25 orphans who live together (like a family) near a railroad track because they wanted to capture the plight of the orphans through the eyes of the orphans themselves. They interviewed the kids and followed them around with a video camera. It's a very sad reality that these young people are left to fend for themselves, feeling unwanted, unloved, and uncared for.

The train station is their ""home"" and they barely survive by getting on trains to beg passengers for money (1-2 rupees). At night, they sleep on the hard ground, covering themselves with blankets to protect themselves from getting bitten by mosquitoes. Several of them are limbless (resulting from jumping the trains). Most of them are addicted to cigarettes, tobacco, or whiteners. Some even use injections and have no clue what they've been injecting into their bloodstream. They only care about numbing their pain. They have been discarded, abandoned, abused (by their own families), beaten even by the police. When two young siblings (ages 3 and 7) joined the group, David and Shawn asked Harvest India (an orphanage and school) to help these young ones out. It's their hope that viewers will watch this film, realize the desperate need, and then take action to change lives. I highly recommend this powerful DVD and I invite you to check out Mother India's website and Harvest India!

I'm still in a state of pain after watching this DVD.  I cannot imagine giving birth to a child and abandoning them.  I REALLY cannot imagine seeing a child abandoned and not doing everything I can to help them.  Yet, this is the reality these children live in.

Did you know that over 31 million children are Orphans in India?  Did you know that 2 out of 3 children are abused?  Over 50% of those children are also sexually abused?  The statistics make my heart ache.

The stories are haunting.  The boy who lost his family in an accident, the girl who found herself trafficked, the siblings who were sent to beg by their parents, then abandoned, the girl who lost her fingers and a baby ... these stories haunt.

The kids turn to tobacco or white-out to ease their pain.  Pain from hunger, mosquitos or the beatings by the local police.  And I sit here and just hurt.  My momma heart cannot turn away.

In America, we are blessed.  Yet, we are blessed, not for ourselves ... but we are blessed to help others.  The end of the DVD gives the opportunity to help by sponsoring a child for $35/month.

Well Done, Not Overdone

Winner of ""Best Short Documentary"" at the 2012 San Diego Christian Film Festival, Mother India  chronicles the adventure of 25 courageous orphans living as a family along the railway in Tenali, India. While Mother India is not for the faint of heart, it doesn't seek to be intentionally graphic. Maybe it's the occasional narration by the melodic vocal talents of Rebecca St. James that helps diffuse the awful reality of the kids' lives. More likely, it's the story-telling talents of the two men, with a little bit of God's blessing, that captures the heart of the orphans' plight without turning your stomach.

The two travel to India without any real plan in place, except to engage orphans. They soon find themselves drawn into a tight-knit family of orphans, complete with a father-figure named Reddy who has become the leader of the rag-tag band of children.

The film depicts the daily life of these kids - how they find food, where they sleep, their means of staying safe, and the habits they rely on to cope with the pain, both past and present.

One thing I was particularly struck by was the prevalence of serious injuries among the children. Nearly 1 out of 3 orphans in India have some such handicap, often received from trying and failing to board a train car to beg for their daily subsistence.

In fact, their injury is among the first things each child is eager to show outsiders. They display it with some sense of pride, a fact that first puzzled me. But then I realized that their physical handicap was also their meal ticket. Unfortunately. The worse their injury seemed to others, the greater  the chance they might receive a rupee or two from a compassionate train passenger. In a disturbing way, their weakness became their source of strength.

More than Beggars

And yet there remains a code of honor, a cultural allegiance in their begging system. The children would not simply ask for a handout. Instead, they would extand a hand as they went through the motions of cleaning the floors of the train. In this way, they were seen as ""good kids,"" as one child put it, worthy of a few rupees. Over the course of the day, they might beg for up to $1 US. If one child fell short, they all pitched in, like a family, to fill the need.

I couldn't help but note the stark contrast even between the setting in which the men shared their perspectives after their trip and the squalid conditions the kids slept and lived in each day. If the children were lucky, they got to sleep on concrete, covered head to toe with a threadbare blanket to conceal themselves from mosquitoes and other two-footed predators. They brushed their teeth with a finger and brick dust. Many of them have already tested positive for HIV.

Most kids likely contracted HIV through sharing needles, though sexual activity is not at all uncommon. Each of them seemed to have a habit of some sort, a coping mechanism to help numb the pain, both emotional and physical. Some sniffed white-out, some chewed tobacco. Still others shot-up with a watery but mysterious substance which more than one orphan admitted, ""I don't know what it is.""

And yet these kids, for whom no one wants responsibility, don't seem much different than my own. They want to grow up to be ""like regular people."" Their dreams are very humble things. And yet most will not see them realized. Not without help, perhaps from you.

Already Making a Difference

The film ends on a highly positive note as the two men are able to find an adopted home with Harvest India for a three-year-old and seven-year-old deserted by parents who sent them to beg on the streets. From that experience, they discover that the best chance of helping these precious kids is when they are very young.

The longer they are on the streets enjoying ""freedom,"" the harder it is for them learn that the ""freedom"" is holding them back.

Parents who watch this film will likely see their own kids in the eyes of these dear souls - except most likely without a missing hand, foot, or eye. It will break your heart. But it should. Our hearts should break for what breaks the heart of God.

Mother India makes a terrific resource for sharing with a church small-group or in a home-group setting. The 49 minute running time fits neatly into such schedules. But I would also suggest the film as tool for parents, teachers, or for homeschooling groups wishing to share a missional mindset with teenage children. I would not recommend it for anything younger than that age level due, not to graphic pictures, but simply to the nature of the mature content. Be sure to screen it first before sharing with kids of any age.",1366502400,,5534,4.745833333333334
5553883,3,B00B2TUG8E,"This particular documentary shines a whole new light on the life of the orphan in India, specifically the street orphan. David Trotter and Shawn Scheinoha, first-time filmmakers, made this documentary by spending two weeks in India with a small group of street orphans. In India alone there are over 31 million orphans. To bring perspective, a friend of ours pointed out, that's close to as many people there are in  all of Canada.

 As you get to know each of these children and young adults, it is heart breaking to hear their stories. Many of them are abandoned, including the littlest 3 and 5 year olds, and have memories of their parents leaving them. You watch them beg for money on the local train, find ways to laugh together, and use almost any method to numb their pain. It makes you cringe as they tell stories of the violence experienced at the hands of other children on the street.

David and Shawn are able to end on a somewhat hopeful note, but I definitely left feeling emotionally spent. This brings me my only real caution before you watch this: if you have a weak stomach, be forewarned, there are both graphic stories and filming of drug use and injuries that can be overwhelming. These things don't normally bother me, but possibly because the filming is of children, it gets pretty heavy, pretty fast.

Overall, the documentary is educational and interesting. My main reason for giving this only a 3-star rating is this: I left sad, really sad, but kind of hopeless. I don't feel the filmmakers did a thorough job in helping us think together how to truly help the children in India. Maybe there isn't a viable way to help, other than sponsoring a child, but when the only wrap-up message was to sponsor a child it started to feel a little like a World Vision or Compassion International advertisement. I am not saying either of those organizations are unimportant or don't do great things for children worldwide, but for me it wasn't enough to feel a crowd would move to action. To sponsor a child they must be in an orphanage, but these children were not in an orphanage, and were abandoned late enough in life that most orphanages in India would not take them. There must be some other way to help a country that considers millions of children to really not even be human. The documentary will stir your heart, but I just didn't feel satisfied that the solution presented connected with the problem shown throughout the documentary.",1366416000,,2458,4.680555555555555

Remarkably, there are over 31 million orphans in India. Living in conditions that are far beyond anything you would imagine, these orphans often come together as a family. Their parents have either abandon them or died. It is a powerful look into their day to day struggle to survive.

I watched ""Mother India"" with my 12 year old son. At one point I asked him how this made him feel to live where we live and have what we have. These children use needles they find on the street and struggle with other addictions which often lead to Aids and other disease. They literally sniff the office product ""White Out"" because it is cheap and can give them a high. As they explained in the film, they do this to escape the physical and mental pain, even if only for a few minutes.

I highly recommend watching ""Mother India"" if you have the opportunity. The end will leave you with hope that there is something that each of us can do to help. Even if it is just one of the 31 million. ""Mother India"" releases on Tuesday.",1366416000,,1294,4.410041841004184

Set in S.E. India, Tenali is an agricultural center that attracts orphans because of the location of a major railway junction.

As captured by Americans David Trotter and Shawn Scheninoha, they get a first hand, up close feel for this life of desperation when they befriend a group of 25 children living together near the railway.

Walking where the children walk, sleeping where the children sleep, the film makers hear and see how they survive and the realities of their street life.

The groups' ""leader"", Reddy, explains how the kids came to live in the group.  The kids take turns answering questions and sharing their heart breaking stories.

One such story is 2 young siblings, Polayya and Koteswari who were recently abandoned.  Trotter and Scheninoha realize these children don't have to suffer that same bleak future and take steps to try to get them rescued through Harvest India -- a safe haven in the darkness!

The film takes place in a large town in India where 2 men, David Trotter and Shawn Scheinoha, have came to produce a first-time film.  While they are there, they soon find a real reason for the film, the orphans of India.  With more than 31 million children left to die or live off the streets, 25 of these orphans become friends with David and Shawn.

Each orphan has a name and story to tell of how they became orphaned. Some have handicaps and are addicted to cigarettes and inhaling harmful fumes.  These 25 children show the film makers what goes on in their daily lives.  Begging for food from the train stations and the passengers, sleeping in filth ridden areas, and never getting away from this life.
There are 2 small children, a girl -7 and a boy -3 who are part of this group.  David and Shawn try their best to get these 2 into an orphanage, Harvest India.  It is not an easy task to do but by the end of the film it was looking good for the 2 children.
This film will definitely make you want to reach out and help these children.  It made me so sad to know that millions of children live this way.  It also will make you stop and think how lucky your children are to have a good home, parents and food.  These are things that many of the orphans of India will never be able to know.

As you watch the film, you grow to care about these kids--some are adults now, but that makes it more tragic to realize what they have gone through to survive. During the filming of Mother India, the filmmakers were presented an opportunity to a tour of the Harvest India campus and children's home in Tenali. Suresh Kumar and his wife, Christina of Harvest India helped expedite matters, but it further heightened my awareness of the complexities involved in helping these children and the glimmer of hope that can be offered. You feel overwhelmed as you watch at the enormity of it all, but even helping one or two can make an impact on those who will need help in the future. It is always better to do something rather than nothing.

This is not a film for young viewers. Some of the topics are drug abuse, sexuality, violence, and HIV/AIDS. You hear children talk of being used for sex, drug use is shown, and wounds from abuse. Nor is this a film aimed only at a Christian audience, but is intended to bring awareness to all about the plight of these kids. If your family, church, or organization are wanting to be involved with a ministry, watch this film and you will realize the needs to be met.

YOU can...
- Spread the word.
- Sponsor a child.
- Serve with organizations who are helping orphans in India.

5553890,5,B00B2TUG8E,"Enter Andhra Pradesh, India where producers, David Trotter and Shawn Scheinoha, film a family of twenty-five abandoned and orphaned children who live along a Southern Indian railway in Tenali. Their mission: make a documentary to raise awareness to viewers worldwide about the impoverished lifestyle of these injured and starving children living on the streets. Their hopes: to gain aid in this particular area, where thirty-one million orphaned and homeless children struggle just to survive.

  The film is powerful, fixing itself on the stories told by these 25 individuals; the stories about their hardships and their terrible pasts of abandonment and child abuse. As the film progresses, we learn how these youths, from ages anywhere within 3 to 25, struggle day-to-day to make a small amount of money just to feed themselves. They beg on the streets or in the trains for rupees. Some try to garner up currency, by selling odd, assorted items like stickers, key chains, and tobacco. They barely get by; all they can make is enough to eat, and even so, just a little.

  A lot of them sleep outdoors, exposed to the raw, sultry environment with pesky mosquitoes nipping at them night and day. They are dirty, starving---drinking muddy unfiltered water, wearing the only clothes they own, raped by other homeless youths or sold into slavery, trafficking--all the nightmares that anyone could think imaginable is opened to them. They are refused work, because of employers fearing they would steal from them. Then there are the unfortunate who cannot work due to missing body parts. They are disabled and only able to walk with a crutch or a barely usable artificial limb. Some of the kids die on the street, from sickness or the injuries they get from hopping trains. Fifty percent of them are HIV/AID positive and have no clue how they even got it.

  Other than these details above, the documentary also shows how David and Shawn found a way to help two young children, a three year old and a seven year old, get into a children's home called Harvest India.

  Harvest India is an organization that supports, educates, and helps orphans get adopted in their country. It is marvelous what they do! Check out their site here [...] for more information about Harvest India, and gain information about how to donate to this wonderful charity.

 The production team of Mother India would love it if churches and organizations would have a public screening of the documentary. On their site here {...], they mention that either one of the three producers would love to speak at any convention if asked.

The message throughout Mother India is deeply thought-evoking and really hits you in the heart.  I was saddened to hear the stories of these young people. It is utterly unbelievable how things like this go on every moment of the day throughout the world, all of these stories unheard of or untold.

Many of us prefer to seek shelter in the middle where consensus dulls and routine stifles.

It seems understanding life has more to do with understanding others than with understanding ourselves. This possibility requires us to enter into unfamiliar, unsafe, and even unsavory places to meet unknown people; for they too have stories.

I was so  shocked and moved to want to help after seeing David's trip to visit and live with these kids for a bit. He filmed it all and wove it together in an engaging documentary that moves you to want to help and also be so thankful of everything we ofter take for granted!,1364860800,3,383,4.2465753424657535
5553916,5,B00B2TUG8E,This is a very well done documentary on the life of some of the street orphans in India. It doesn't just give you statistics but actually takes you on the streets with the kids so that you feel like you get to know them and what life is actually like for them day to day. Definitely an eye-opener.,1364860800,,297,4.137931034482759
5553917,5,B00B2TUG8E,"I've never been to India. Friends have tried to describe the experience. The colors and pungent odors explode on the senses - they say. But what about how the massive majority of the country live out their lives, specifically the orphan - the abandoned.

This film gives you a chance to meet the amazingly resilient children who must rise out of extreme circumstances to find dignity and hope.  Their story must be told!",1364860800,,420,4.739726027397261
5553918,5,B00B2TUG8E,"Mother India is one of those films that brings you face to face with uncomfortable truth.  30 million orphans in India, many of them living on the streets with no support network or family other than that which they create for themselves.  This documentary highlights one such family of orphans and makes real their names and faces as you meet them vicariously through the eyes of the filmmakers as they themselves experience life among the orphans first hand.  This is no feel-good story that shows how a little money and time makes everything okay for these kids.  The truth is that their lives are filled with challenges that are not easy to overcome; drug addiction, sexual exploitation, systemic institutional corruption...these are just a few of the realities that stand in the way of seeing real change materialize for these kids.  But, as this film shows, there are those in India (and abroad) who have committed their lives to doing what they can for these 30 million orphans, one beautiful child at a time.  While the solutions are neither easy nor guaranteed, the opportunity to partner with those who are willing to do the long hard work of making a difference is there.  By the end of this film, that opportunity will be staring you straight in the eye, compelling you to action!",1364860800,,1292,4.792792792792793

5553920,5,B00B2TUG8E,I thought this film was beautifully shot and really captured the heartbreaking realities of what life is like for the poor and forgotten in India.

8561834,5,B00B2TUG8E,"I spent much of my younger years (college, grad school, law school) involved in social and political issues and causes.  As I grew older (like many others), I grew weary of ""the fight"" for social change, and my focus turned to my family.  For many years now, I have largely avoided any movie (or anything else) that I thought might be trying to ""preach"" to me.  Art that is expressly ""political"" does not generally interest me.

I purchased this film because it was brought to my attention through the American Family Association (my father signed me up as a member, and I get their publications now).  I don't always agree with the views of the organization (some of those views, like their views on gay rights, are directly opposite mine), but they do have a nice focus on family, and I have discovered some truly wonderful movies through the reviews or ads in their publications (The Pledge, Jimmy, Camp).  I learned about this movie that way, as well, and that is why I watched it.

My wife was a little concerned that it might be a bit much for our children (10 and 13), so I ""pre-screened"" it last night.  Although some of it is a bit rough, I do not think it is inappropriate for children that age, and we will watch it as a family (I may add more here after we do that).

Other reviewers have used words that seem right to me -- raw, blunt, direct, honest, simple.  Also, heartbreaking, touching, inspiring.  An almost random story of two American guys who return to India after their initial time there, for the sole purpose of documenting the lives of some of India's countless street orphans, it turns into an advocacy piece when they fall in love with the children they meet.  And so did I, as I watched it.  I like to pretend I'm a tough guy (at least for a balding suburban professional), but I was in tears through most of this film, and literally had to stop it at least four or five times to regain my composure.  It is very nicely done.  I don't know how much footage they must have had, but they edited it artfully, and it never drags.  In the end, it leaves you with a sliver of hope, and the realization that nothing is going to change easily or quickly.

My only criticism -- and I know it is expected, and it does not detract from my ""rating"" at all -- is that at the end it becomes a little more strident than it needed to be.  It would have been enough to simply document what happened; the commentary at the end, urging us to lend a hand, probably could have been skipped (as in Camp, where the filmmakers simply provided contact information for the relevant organization in a screen after the credits).  That said, I appreciate what they are doing, and if this last bit helps, or even has a chance of helping, then I can't argue with putting it in.

This film is an excellent way to spend an hour of your time.  Will do a lot more for you than watching another episode of [fill in your favorite tv drama].",1426723200,3,2932,4.362799263351749

Yet I was so moved by this couple of guys who went with open-hearts to spend time with this abandoned little group.
They discovered a compassionate leader who provided a welcome acceptance for the children for whom despite all manner of horrific backgrounds, that of being rejected was their worst pain.
Listening to their hopes and dreams is well worthwhile.",1393027200,,488,4.891566265060241
