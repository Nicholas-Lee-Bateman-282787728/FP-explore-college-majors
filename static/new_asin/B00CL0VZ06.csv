8582911,3,B00CL0VZ06,"Tokyo Urban Legend is okay. My main problem with the movie is that the episodes are too short. Especially the episode about the man who wins the lottery. The best episode, in my opinion, is the one with the woman with the bandaged face. That one's kind of creepy. This flick is for J-Horror fans only.",1376611200,2,301,4.392857142857143
