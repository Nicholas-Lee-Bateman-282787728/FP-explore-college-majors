8177933,3,B000NIJ8ZC,Too graphic for treatment.  Teens probably not interested in content. Not enough real life portraits of youth that they can relate. .,1397260800,,133,5.045454545454546
8177934,3,B000NIJ8ZC,"It's informative.  My children, all under age 9, thought it was okay and most importantly, they did learn some valuable information.  Just let me say that it's rough to sit through as an adult, though.  Terrible acting.",1369008000,,219,4.864864864864865
8177935,5,B000NIJ8ZC,"This video kept my 9 year old interested. The subject matter was very
basic, informative and age appropriate for young children. A funny video
that is not too in-dept. Even touches on the subject of stranger safety.
I recommend this video for children 8 years and older.",1214006400,5,270,4.76595744680851
8177936,5,B000NIJ8ZC,"After purchasing ""Safety on Wheels"" & ""Fire Safety"" of the CoachColes productions I am amazed he did it again!  My kids just love the humor and creativity of 'Saying ""NO"" to Drugs with the Safety Sarge'.  Drug safety is a very touchy subject and tough to talk to children about but, the Sarge closes that gap between child and parent to open a much needed line of communication!  I recommend this for all ages.",1196899200,5,410,4.513513513513513
