6724954,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"I absolutely LOVED this movie.  I usually like to see movies after I've read the book, but now I need to order the book and devour it.  A well acted, sweet story that, as another reviewer commented, puts the typical Hollywood mediocre romance-comedy to shame.  This is how it should be done.",1423353600,,291,4.5576923076923075
6724955,5,B00O7LYUXQ,I loved it. Its one of my favorite books turned movie adaptions. Super cute. Lily and Sam were perfect as Rosie and Alex. Can't wait to see it again.,1423353600,,149,4.172413793103448
6724956,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"Lily Collins has grown into an amazing actress with great potential. After previewing the film, I thought it's just another teenage flick, but not so at all! she has a very mature way about her. The movie has so many surprising turns and is delivered masterfully by the entire cast. It's a lite film (mood), with some serious notes. Overall, not too heavy, not too lite. Recommend for all ages.",1423267200,30,394,4.642857142857143
6724957,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"love this movie! its super cute, funny as heck, and has an awesome soundtrack!! my new favorite chick flick!!!",1423267200,,110,4.842105263157895
6724958,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"This movie was so good, I was worried at the beginning, it moved a little slow but it really picked up! It was the kind where you smile and laugh and then tear up and get a knot in your throat because you have really connected with the character's story. Really good acting as well!!!",1423180800,3,284,4.181818181818182
6724959,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"Such a wonderful story. I read the book and fell in love with it and when I found out they were making it into a movie, I freaked!!! I loved the way they made this movie. So good!!!!",1423180800,,182,3.8157894736842106
6724960,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"After reading the book, I was very interested to see how the film would be different. The book was exceptionally long, so I knew there would be a lot of detail left out, and I was concerned the same type of message wouldn't be conveyed in the movie.

Normally, I wouldn't rate a movie five stars (I'm told I am a harsh critic) but for someone to turn such a long detailed book into a movie that is able to make the viewer feel the same emotions seems like it would be an impossible task. But it was completed beautifully! The character development was great, and the chemistry between these two was never doubted. The writers did not try to force everything into the movie, making it seem rushed and scattered.

I recommend anyone who has read the book (or anyone in general) to watch this movie. Especially if you're a hopeless romantic like myself, always looking for the next good love story. It tugs at those heart strings! I compare this movie to Like Crazy, just how two people seem destined to be together but always distanced for one reason or another. You won't be disappointed!",1423180800,3,1087,4.5126903553299496
6724961,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"This movie was obviously a must see for me because it has both Lily Collins and Sam Claflin in it.
Love, Rosie was honestly such a great movie. I loved Sam and Lily's chemistry just as much as I loved their characters.
I'm definitely going to watch this move over and over again.

Go see this movie. It's a must see! You won't regret it.",1423180800,,337,4.184615384615385
6724962,4,B00O7LYUXQ,"Whats it about?

Rosie and Alex have been best friends since they were 5, so they couldn't possibly be right for one anotheror could they? When it comes to love, life and making the right choices, these two are their own worst enemies.

What did I think?

Tender, earnest and sweet, Love, Rosie is proof that when it comes to romantic comedies the UK always do it so much better. Even though its hardly perfect it still manages to portray more humanity than the average Hollywood formula. Love, Rosies strength is not the predictable destination but of the almost whimsical journey it takes to get there.

Sam Clafin will inevitably be compared to Hugh Grant (he has many of the mannerisms down pat) but his chemistry with the talented Lily Collins only adds an extra layer to a film that true romantics will not be able to get enough of. It certainly has some weaknesses but the characters and pacing gloss over the cracks and youll find your heartstrings tugged regardless.",1419897600,39,975,4.684210526315789

6724976,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"Theres something super charming about Lily collins in this movie, and she plays a pretty convincing Brit. I felt these two had a lot of chemistry and dug the story.

Sure, they end up together, but it's the between time that makes the movie and the anticipation that keeps you watching. Lily Collins and Sam Claflin are adorable in their own right and have this amazing chemistry together. When you couldn't stream it anymore, I had to purchase it so I can watch it whenever I want now!",1511568000,,493,4.8

6725004,3,B00O7LYUXQ,"I was shocked by how gender-normative this movie was. Like traditional to the point of being outdated. I mean, it's a chick-flick and let's be real: I watched it for the pretty people in it -- but there are far better modern rom-coms out there (see: Man Up, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, Morning Glory) that don't make me roll my eyes and sigh when I watch them. It was legitimately difficult to enjoy in parts because it's just so regressive.

Also, can I get a person of color in this movie? Seriously, just one. A glimmer of melanin, maybe.",1499212800,,536,4.469387755102041

6725014,1,B00O7LYUXQ,Wow! I can't believe I bought this movie. I read the reviews and since there were so many 5 stars and excellent reviews I decided to buy it to add it to my Romantic Movies collection.... what a disappointment! This movie is not funny at all. There's no chemistry between the main characters. The story was terrible and the acting a complete disgrace.  I think Sam Claflin is such a great actor but this was a weak performance. Lily Collins was terrible. What a mediocre movie! Just juvenile and stupid!,1495670400,,502,4.5777777777777775

6725137,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"This movie is a must see! When I first saw the trailer some time ago (closer to when the movie came out) I didn't really want to see it becasue it was presented in a way that made it seem like Rosie was a girl who kind of wanted to ""sow her wild oats,"" for lack of a better term, and then as a last resort realized she was in love with Alex. When I saw the movie was about to leave prime I figured I'd give it a go and boy am I glad I did.

This movie was beautiful. It's about the truest form of love and freindship and how timing is everything. Lily Collins as Rosie was a absolutly wonderful casting decision. She was utterly amazing. And her character was strong, selfless, and remarkable. I will recomend this movie to ANYONE. If you can't decided if you want to see it, just watch it. You won't be dissapointed! Truly one of the most beautiful I've seen in some time.",1485820800,,873,4.075581395348837

It's not often that you watch a movie that you pick at random on Netflix (or anywhere for that matter) and have it move you to tears, and you find yourself thinking about how great it was even days and weeks later.

6725448,4,B00O7LYUXQ,"I thought Sam Claflin and Lily Collins generally did a good job portraying their characters both as teens and into adulthood. Like some other reviewers, the plot issues can become a bit tedious if you are expecting a realistic approach to their relationship issues. I agree that if the two characters had just had a heart to heart about how they felt about each other, then there probably would have been no movie. I recommend going into this movie knowing that it is very definitely romcomedramadey. I haven't read the source material from Cecelia Ahern, but having read her most well known work that was adapted to the screen, P.S. I love you, I am willing to risk the assessment that there were some significant changes from the source material to make it work for a movie translation. That being said, I would say it is slightly more ridiculous in missed opportunities than One Day (screen version only- have not read the book). If you have seen One Day and did not like it for the similar issues, you likely will not enjoy this movie either. Otherwise, go into this film with the knowledge that communication is NOT the strong suit of the two main characters-especially for best friends who supposedly know absolutely everything about each other.",1485302400,2,1251,4.7695852534562215

6725457,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"I've been complaining for a few years about the lack of decent movies available to rent. Aren't many. It's been a while since Hollywood has put out a movie that's captured my attention. Not asking for much, just something other than violence and superheroes. Over it already! (I did go to the movies last night to see La La Land and it was La-la lovely - but, that's for another review.) I just want to watch a pleasant movie with a grown-up theme and great acting. Enter LOVE, ROSIE. Of course, this isn't a Hollywood movie. It's a British dramedy and...IT'S WONDERFUL!! From beginning to rolling credits, I. Loved. This. Movie. Now, please keep in mind that this is a love story. It will not likely appeal to young men but, for a mature guy who loves watching rom-com with his wife, snuggle up and enjoy. So good I watched it twice! I adore British films. Brits have a sense of humor that I can appreciate and they really do this type of film well. You'd be surprised at how many times I've discovered a gem of a movie whilst watching British film. Simple. Entertaining. Real. That's all I'm asking for. LOVE, ROSIE delivers.

Lily Collins, daughter of music legend Phil Collins, gives an outstanding performance as Rosie, a young woman growing up too fast in today's world. One decision will change her life forever. Complete happiness is always an arm's length away but opportunities keep slipping through her fingers. The beautiful Sam Claflin, most recently in ME BEFORE YOU opposite Emilia Clarke, plays Rosie's BFF. They share a loving, close bond that is unshakable. The story progresses quickly through their childhood friendship and focuses on the years between twenty and midlife. I don't really want to give anything away but I will say this, if you've ever had a friendship that was deep and truly meaningful (and most of us have), then you will love this movie as much as I did. It's a love story about friendship, the kind that lasts and lasts. It's a story about missed opportunities and what ifs. Very relatable. Again, VERY real. Just like a true friendship, this movie made my heart smile and hurt.",1485302400,19,2118,4.693548387096774

I know many people have their opinions about this movie, and feels that this movie devalues marriage and everything, and other moral complex issues people deals with every day; but the movie let you see the good and the bad in people, therefore it is things we deal with everyday. Just because it is shared on national TVs and channels, does not mean the issues are not being played out in real life.

The friendship that Rosie (Lily Collins) and Alex (Sam Claflin) have is beautiful, and believable. The main thing to keep in mind is that the story is very real, meaning, this movie is not trying to paint the world and relationships in a bright pink color; some scenes are sad, some are frustrating, other are just straight up funny! Though the relationship between Alex and Rosie can sometimes be frustrating (which is why this movie is probably not for everyone) rest assured, it is not a ""bring a box of tissues"" kind of movie.",1484784000,,642,4.640350877192983

6726174,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"If you look up ""frustration"" in the dictionary, this movie would be right next to the definition. I say this in the greatest way possible. Movies are meant to make you feel, and Love, Rosie did just that. I felt for the characters and their stories, experiencing every emotion they were going through alongside them. From tears and anger to excitement, sadness, happiness, and yes: frustration. Throughout the movie, you'll find yourself rooting on what seems like an impossible romance, one that fate just keeps at bay. The frustration comes in not knowing whether it will ever come to be and it-- well, you'll just have to watch it to know for yourself.",1484352000,6,655,4.8053097345132745

6726616,2,B00O7LYUXQ,"The two stars are for the actors, both of whom are charming. The lack of more stars is for the sloppy plotline. Firstly, I believe the two begin the movie as high school seniors, yet a few movie months later male lead is taking medical classes. Uh, I think you take four years of undergraduate studies before you move on to obstetrics. Both kids come from a modest neighborhood but said young man is soon going to Harvard (I know, scholarship, but...) and living in a series of gorgeous apartments. Oh, and ""girl"" applies to Boston College but gets acceptance letter from Boston University. Ah, two different institutions, English people. Flash forward through multiple setbacks that keep this romance from fruition and young woman's career goals flounder. One is left wondering how she is financially surviving - good will of her parents? And, how are her parents managing with three kids and only dad's salary as a hotel doorman? Plot plods on with occasional fun moments because Lily Collins is very engaging. Finally, story wraps up: spoiler alert - there is enough money in her share of the sale of parents' home for Lily's character to purchase and decorate her dream boutique hotel on the coast.

6726820,4,B00O7LYUXQ,"Lovely movie, but it's more of a romantic drama with some humor than a romantic comedy. Rosie is in love with the best friend she's had since they were both kids, but a misunderstanding leads to him taking someone else to the senior dance, and her losing her virginity and getting knocked up after the dance by a boy she doesn't even like. Missed opportunity is followed by missed opportunity as the two best friends refuse to burden each other with how they really feel and what's going on in their lives. Of course, it all leads to the inevitable happy ending.

The characters are fun and interesting. They aren't perfect, but you do find yourself rooting for them. It's a bittersweet romance with some amusing parts, not great but definitely worth a watch. (This movie is rated-R for sexual situations and language.)",1483315200,,819,4.7272727272727275

6726855,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"Brilliant performance by all of the actors. So much rings true as you watch the characters struggle with choices, consequences, missed opportunities, pursuit of dreams, running from the fear of rejection, rejection of what is, regret from decisions made, concern that one might be too far gone, and navigating the road before us and this four letter word we call LIFE. Get ready for emotional highs and lows as you see pieces of your own life revealed through the story.

ad lib:
What's meant to be will be. When it is true, and when IT is real... LOVE... A DREAM... NOthing, NOone, NOdistance, NOpast, NOchoice can separate it. LIFE LESSON... all of the hard lessons and heartaches we face can typically be avoided when we listen to our gut feeling (that little but loud voice in your head) and respond with a willingness to take a chance, feel a little afraid and walk through discomfort of the unknown in the beginning. QUESTION? Is all of the drama necessary and part of the plan preparing us for the very best and and even better? MULTIPLE REALITY... Love and a dream, given from above in our hearts, always finds a way, even when we run....... all things work together for good when we are willing to learn the lessons, share our experiences with and inspire others, appreciate what is and embrace the dream next time it is in front of us... Timing is everything. AND IT IS NEVER TOO LATE.",1483315200,2,1395,4.625

6726947,4,B00O7LYUXQ,"I was looking for something that would entail a love story while having it's funny aspects to the overall of the film, and this movie 'Love, Rosie' does just that. I have to admit, even though this movie runs short of two hours, I just couldn't watch the entirety until the fourth day! But glad I finished it, as this is a very good movie that deals with a strong friendship from early childhood and goes on into adulthood, all the time wanting to be so much more, but never seems to be the right time, as each side deals with events that sidetrack their lives. I really enjoyed all the actors in this movie and the scenery in Ireland. When all said and done, the story is nothing short of a fairytale ending, along with a few surprises of how life and relationships just seem to be right at first glance. I'm starting to think that watching a movie in it's entirety in one sitting is harder today because our minds are being 'programmed' to reading, watching short snippets throughout our social apps, and to stop everything for a movie of almost two hours, must drive our minds crazy. But well worth watching to the very 'end' which will supply the brain with many endorphins for your staying power.",1482969600,,1201,4.463636363636364

6726954,3,B00O7LYUXQ,Not terrible. The passage of time is handled poorly and the movie gets cartoonish in the middle with the handcuff and the bed frame. Also there's no explanation for how Rosie's share of inheritance can buy a seaside resort. And how is it that everyone in the world seems to know that these two are meant for each other except them?

Yes, you have the unrequited love, the bad choices, and missed opportunities. But isn't that what makes RomCom movies what they are?  This movie has some good acting, some genuine chemistry, a predictable story line, and likable characters.

I guess it's hard to translate everything to the big screen, but the book made me laugh and cry and the movie did not. They left things out that should have been included to make it a better movie.  The actors were great and I'm sure the deleted parts were not their decision.  Great movie about best friends finally realizing they are each other's true love.",1482192000,,467,4.2727272727272725

It leans more towards a possible realistic chain of events, rather than ""magical-everyone gets what they want"" type of a story.

6727644,3,B00O7LYUXQ,"I decided to watch this because it was free with prime membership and had a lot of glowing reviews. I also like both of the actors.  That said. This movie is really not for everyone. It is for people who like romantic dramas.  It is very emotional.  The actors all do a fine job. They are all very convincing and well casted.  The storyline tugs at your heart strings.  However, it is very frustrating and depressing at parts. I can see how some people would enjoy this type of movie a lot. If you like movies that are emotional, you may like this.  If you like movies about missed opportunities and quirky personalities.  I think this movie does have an overall lesson, but it's kind of diluted down. I mean you can take two different kinds of messages from having seen this film. You can either take it to be a lesson that you should seize every opportunity. Or, you can view this as kind of a bunch of contrived circumstances.  I felt like this movie straddled the borderline.  It had good acting but the poor choices that a lot of the characters made made me lose some empathy for them. I felt sad when bad things happened to them a little but not that much because I felt like they caused their own misery.  I guess I thought this movie was just okay because I was hoping it would be more of a romantic comedy and I wanted to see something like hearted. This was darker.  Also, there were a lot of raunchy scenes. I think some people find that humorous but it's not my style.",1480809600,45,1480,4.306859205776173

6727667,1,B00O7LYUXQ,"Heart-warming, the review says.  Huh. I could only stick with this one up to the point where it turned into a sex-fest. The basic idea here is the friendship between these two teens, yet that is blown all to particles within the first half hour when, unmotivated and out of nowhere, they decide to go to bed together.  I could have handled that as a valid plot device, but it is so overdone, so out-of-frame and in the end so unfunny that it ended the incipient charm of this little rom-com REALLY fast. Frankly I couldn't care less what comes after that scene. Shame on you, Lily Collins.  I know you're a Brit and therefore have different views from most of us Yankees, but I think you could have maintained a higher artistic standard than this trash.",1480723200,,753,4.481751824817518

Don't make the mistake of viewing this if you're looking for a romance like I was.
It's just one tragedy after another.
The lead actors are likable and gorgeous but the plot drags on (with sappy and/or inappropriate music) and the lovers keep missing each other until the very end.

In one sense, it's a very sweet story about friends who realize they could be more, but never at the same time. And in another sense, it's a fairly brutal dissection of relationships. The how's and why's of the people we end up with, as well as the seeds of the destruction of those same relationships. It's funny and cute in parts, and it's tragic and heartbreaking in parts, too.

This young couple were never solid, not even in their friendship really.  They skirted around making very bad and immature choices based on who hurt how the most!  Very much like 'nanner, nanner', I got one on you!  They have been stuck at 18, and that's the maturity level they maintained throughout the film.  Emotionally stuck during the greatest time of our lives, and both made wrong choices...it went downward from there.

The primary characters never seemed to age, it was never clear if the primary male character became a doctor except that he had an extremely nice home all the time.  Characters reappeared (brother of pregnant girlfriend) later in the film, and characters disappeared (Rosie's brothers),  I guess the audience was suppose to make assumptions.

Love, Rosie is a very enjoyable film, even though it assiduously avoids being pure fluff--there is some real substance to it. 4 stars",1478131200,,429,5.142857142857143

Lily Collins did an outstanding job as Rosie. I was impressed. The supporting cast were all really good, and funny, as well. Sam Claflin was brilliant, as usual, so I was not disappointed there. Might I add that he looks gorgeous in this film. He deserves more leading roles based solely on his immense talent, but with his combination of talent AND looks, he should be an A-lister, banking at least 7 figure salaries by now. If he chooses his roles right, I could see an Oscar win in his future.

***SPOILERS below for a different movie (maybe?)***

I bought this movie immediately after bawling my eyes out watching Me Before You, because I needed to make my heart feel better after Sam Claflin died in that movie. :'( I just wanted to see him NOT die. Lol I did cry during this movie, even at the end. But that's because it was a happy ending. That's right. He didn't die. He lived happily ever after. YAY! :D",1474588800,39,1054,4.484375

6728233,1,B00O7LYUXQ,"Why can I not find an actual romcom? I decided to try this after watching Me Before You (a totally different movie than what is advertised) because Sam Claflin is charming and I was curious if he could actually be a good leading man with a good story... This movie is even worse than Me Before You. I'm not deciding to watch a romcom in order to be bored and depressed watching someone's life go horribly - I want to see some frickin' romance and adorable fluff. Lily and Sam have 0 chemistry, and weirdly they also have 0 charm individually (Collins is never an engaging actress, but Claflin is usually super endearing so it's odd he's as dull as a piece of recycled paper in this). This movie is a waste of time and money, don't waste yours. The 5 star reviews are very clearly bought, I don't see how anyone could give this movie anything above 3 stars MAX.",1472688000,3,860,4.3478260869565215

The two leads had fantastic on screen chemistry and I cared about both characters. I would recommend this film. It does beg the question of can two people of the opposite sex truly just be friends with neither experiencing any feelings when you spend so much time together over many many years. I do think it is possible, but, rare as well. It is also a lesson in not letting moments or opportunities of honesty get away from you because the consequences can be almost unbearable over time. I did thoroughly enjoy the film and have a new appreciation for Sam Claflin as I just saw him in ""Me Before You"" in which he was fantastic.",1465084800,,745,4.525925925925926

But you keep watching because they're so good together even as friends. And you think it's going to end that way. No chase down an airport security check. No warning at all. And as he enters the Inn, even then you're not sure it's not finally going to happen. I have never agonized so much over a romance. And when they do finally in the last 60 seconds get together, your heart melts as they finally kiss. A real kiss. So worth the journey!",1459296000,,587,4.444444444444445

6728446,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"Love, Rosie is a romantic comedy and dramatic film based on the 2004 novel Where Rainbows End by Cecelia Ahern. It is a story about lifelong friends who have had countless frustrations and hurdles of having a romantic relationship with each other.

This is definitely a charming film. The main characters - Alex and Rosie - are definitely endearing,attractive and full of charisma that the viewer do care for them as they pursue their dreams,careers and one shot at romance. Credit also goes to Lily Collins and Sam Claflin as they gave their all to make characters compelling and interesting enough to make it more than just another predictable,contrived and clichd romantic movie.

It is definitely a joy to watch and entertaining as the audience will definitely feel for both Alex and Rosie from their growth as individuals;to the near misses they have experienced all throughout their lives for love; and when they finally end up with each other at the end.",1435276800,,961,4.925925925925926

Sam Claflin and Lily Collins were so dang perfect for their roles, and they had amazing chemistry. the only problem that I had withr this movie is that I was told that it was a comedy. While there were many hysterical scenes in it, I was sobbing my eyes out more than I was laughing, but that's OK. I mean, who doesn't cry during romance movies? If you don't, you haven't got a heart (either that, or you're a teenage boy). Definitely would watch this one again!",1433980800,,490,4.279569892473118

Lily grew up in California, but spent a lot of time in England. She has the usual American accent, but nailed the British cadence.
 The movie penned in a book by autor Cecelia Ahern, had delightful characters. It was fun watching the journey of the characters over the years. This is not a typical chick-flick. This movie deals with grown-up issues facing some young adults today whether here in the US, Britian or other countries around the globe.",1433030400,,740,4.92

Verdict? Love, Rosie tells of a surprisingly sweet love story between two best friends.

I was completely caught off guard by Rosie's storyline, and really expected something else. I haven't been caught off guard like that in awhile, so I was instantly hooked. Her accent was quite good, too.

Sam Clafin is adorable in this role. I'd love to see his other work now.

The movie itself has some roundabout, repetitive moments (hence the 4 stars) but it's really sweet, funny, and event relatable at times.

6728500,4,B00O7LYUXQ,"Love, Rosie is a British romantic comedy about Rosie Dunne (Lily Collins) and Alex Stewart (Sam Claflin), childhood friends since the age of six. The films romantic story (based on a book by Cecelia Ahern, original writer of P. S. I Love You) covers twelve years of their life, with their friendship slowly turning into something else. Well, in short, will they get together or not?

Claflin and Collins have considerable chemistry on screen, which keeps the films thin story going. The film is most interesting when we watch Rosie and Alex together, even when their romances (with another boy/girl) get complicated in a ridiculous way in the films first half. There are some sexual jokes you may or may not find funny.

The story of Love, Rosie loses momentum in the second half, where Rosie and Alex begin to realize, very slowly, what they should do. I think they could have realized the answer much earlier, but that didn't happen. Anyway, Lily Collins is so charming (even when her character makes terrible mistakes) that it is almost unbelievable Alex seems not to notice that.

Love, Rosie is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on romance. It is deeply flawed, but the charms of the stars almost make up for that.",1427932800,,1221,4.777251184834123

They eventually ended up together after years and years of missing each other. The funny part was how the same is about to happen to Rosie's daughter and her best friend. But the daughter definitely learned her lesson through her mom's experience. It;s a nice mix of drama, comedy. Watch it!",1427846400,,686,4.773109243697479

You wouldn't know it from watching the trailer (which makes it look packed with the usual cliches) but this film has a much better story than 90% of other romantic comedies.

6728525,4,B00O7LYUXQ,"SPOILERS from book and movie.

The key to whether you will enjoy this movie is if you have someone who got away.  If you don't, you'll be annoyed by the random events that keep the two lovers apart.  If you have missed someone because of bad timing you will get this movie.  Not everyone has the opportunity to have the life they want, and this movie will speak to you if you've made choices that precluded being with someone that you still wonder about.

So, as a movie, does it work?  Lily Collins is a great actress for the part.  She carries the movie with her facial expressions.  I can't say enough good things about her performance.  She conveys three or four emotions in one shot.  Sam Claflin, not so much.  He looks older as teenage Alex than he does as thirty year old Alex.  It's really obvious that he's too old.  The script doesn't give him much to do besides make bad choices and we don't really understand why he keeps doing it (except he seems to like tall, thin, rich women...).  Rosie's choices have context and are understandable, but Alex seems to have few redeeming qualities.  It was hard for me to care about him.  When something bad happened to him I didn't feel anything the way I felt for Rosie.  Rosie loves him, they are friends, but... the movie doesn't show enough of why that is.  There is a theme that we shouldn't choose a mate for their looks and money, but Alex keeps doing it even after he realizes he wants something more.  In the book he has children with two wives but these are simply left out of the movie script. These children are what motivate Alex to stay with their mothers instead of being with Rosie, and make him far more sympathetic and human.  In the movie, without this motivation, he's just shallow and unlikable.  ""I love Rosie so much but I can't be with her, so I'll console myself by marrying a model.""  Really, that's what happens.

I confess that I had a personal love story that played out over twenty five years.  Timing and distance kept us apart for decades.  We married different people but ended up together, having been friends the whole time.  It does happen, and if you are open to that the movie will work for you.  If you can't stand the coincidences and bad timing, you won't like it.",1426550400,,2256,4.425790754257908

6728575,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"SIMPLY BRILLIANT AND EARTHY -- ONE OF THE BETTER DRAMAS WITH COMEDY I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG WHILE

Though I would still call this a comedy (a romantic one by design), that is almost doing it an injustice.  It has so much more to offer.  The best of comedies make us both laugh and cry at the same time.  Though the situations can be very dramatic, this slice of life comedy manages to be a little more down to earth while also giving us laugh out loud moments.  If you allow it to develop, it's the drama that draws you in as these two human magnets facing the wrong way go through life trying to get it right.  Then it's the hilarious moments and ridiculously witty lines that bring it all home into a classic.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Rosie (Lily Collins) and Alex (Sam Claflin) have been best friends since childhood.  They do everything together and confide everything.  As they reach the end of high school days it is clear they each have feelings for each other secretly, but cannot risk revealing how each feels.  They help each other win boyfriends or girlfriends, prepare for the school dance, even discuss sex very frankly.  Underneath it all, it's still very clear to the viewer that it's all about them.  A moment of confused rejection for Alex compounds the issue.  However, as they both prepare for college they still plan a future that includes each other.  Sam wishes to go to America and study at Harvard to become a doctor.  He shares that idea with Rosie and explains she could easily go to Boston and study her dream of hotel management.  Rosie's father is a footman at a swanky hotel and they are not wealthy.  However, it is Rosie's dream to one day own and run a great hotel.  As they move forward, life has other ideas as girlfriends and boyfriends seem to complicate the picture.  They are friends above everything, and above everything something more.  Though the premise may sound cheesy and perhaps done a few times, the effort this movie throws into creating somewhat substantial and earthy drama raises it to a whole other level of quality.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  Obviously those who hate romantic or dramatic films are going to have a hard time.  But for those who love the genre, this is a great film.  Lily Collins and Sam Clafln are absolutely brilliant and have great chemistry in every way.  The supporting characters are hilarious and rich.  Though this movie has an R rating that will throw some prospective viewers off, that is mainly for some very frank and hilarious conversations that are somewhat life based, if a little dramatic.  It is not raunchy, but there are moments of intentional crassness (like life).  There is no nudity, though there is some implied sex and sexual situations.  I found the movie tremendously skillful at walking that line between being absolutely funny and yet moving at the same time.  If it sounds remotely interesting to you, I highly recommend giving it a try.",1425081600,60,2929,4.6400778210116735

6728618,5,B00O7LYUXQ,"If there was a 10-star option, I would gladly click all 10 stars! I should probably wait until a few days from now when Amazon asks me if I want to review the movie to actually review the movie because I am feeling so absurdly and deliciously emotional right now I can be nothing but absurdly deliciously biased. I chanced upon this movie tonight, and after watching the trailer decided to rent the movie to de-stress from twilight zone day at work. I agree with the other reviews that Lily Collins continues to mature into an amazing actress. The chemistry between Lily and Sam is fantastic, and duly empowered by a great fantastic storyline. The storyline is not original, but the director, actors, and soundtrack differentiate the movie from others that have traveled the same road. If at 43 years, I'm at the mid-point of my life I am willing to spend the rest of my life believing that love can be true and that neither space nor time can dissuade the perseverance of true love. Maybe the movie caught me at the right moment, but the feeling that pinches in my left chest is sweetly reminiscent of a dimly lit high school dance floor, a nervous hand resting firmly on the small of my  14 year old back, the sound of the 16 year old heart beating beneath my ear as my head lay on his shoulder, Air Supply's ""All Out of Love"" enveloping us as we swayed side to side knowing that everything was possible. What happens that causes us to give in to the vagaries of life and give up on the victories of love? What causes us to deny our hearts while convincing ourselves that what we feel is so natural and powerful it must be wrong? What causes us to stop following our dreams at our own peril? I know a movie is a winner when I feel, and I do so feel after watching this movie. I could blither on, but my point is great movie, great directing, great acting, great message, just freaking great!",1424131200,3,1893,4.3931623931623935
