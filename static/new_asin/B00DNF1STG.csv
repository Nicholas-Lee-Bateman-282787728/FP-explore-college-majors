Intercontiental Championship
Curtis Axel(c) (w/ Paul Heyman) v. Kofi Kingston  2.5/5
- Axel gets the win here. Wasn't booked to defend the belt, but Triple H changed all that.

Fatal 4-Way Match for the Diva's Championship
AJ Lee(c) v. Natalya v. Brie Bella v. Naomi  2.5/5
- AJ gets the win here by making, I belieb Natalya, tapout.

World Heavyweight Championship
Alberto Del Rio(c) v. Rob Van Dam (w/ Ricardo Rodriguez)  3/5
- Del Rio retains the championship, but he got disqualified. So RVD wins, but not the title. But after the match, Rob hitss Del Rio with a Coast to Coast. Never get sick of seeing those moves.

Miz v. Fandango (w/ Summer Rae)  2/5
- Just a filler. Miz gets the win with the Figure Four.

No Disqualification Elimination Handicap Match
CM Punk v. Curtis Axel & Paul Heyman 3/5
- I found this match was entertaining, love Heyman and his facial expressions. Punk eliminates Axel and that leaves himself and Heyman. Ryback appears and puts him threw a table. Kind of a spear. Heyman covers (kind of) and pins CM Punk.

United States Championship
Dean Ambrose(c) v. Dolph Ziggler  3.5/5
- It sucks seeing Ziggler regulated to the midcard, but its better than not seeing him at all. BUT it was a good match, Ambrose gets the win. They should give these guys 20 or so minutes, RAW or PPV, and just tear it down.

Tag Team Championship
""The Shield"" Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns v. ""Prime Time Players"" Darren Young & Titus Oneil  3/5
- Was seeing nice the PTP get a Title shot on a PPV. Shield gets the win, hopefully PTP gets a push cause of there talent, not because of one's sexuality. Its wrestling, I don't care what they are in too, all I care about is that they can go in the ring.

WWE Championship
Randy Orton(c) v. Daniel Bryan  3.88/5
- I liked this match up here, I love both of these guys. Daniel Bryan gets the win after that wicked knee and a 'Quick Count'. Was nice seeing Bryan with the championship belt, even though it wasn't that long. Bryan gets the win and WWE Championship.

NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS 2013

This was the annual night that would see all the titles on the line. I have always

Spoilers

1.[I-C TITLE]CURTIS AXEL VS KOFI KINGSTON-great opening bonus match between these two. Triple h started the night out coming to the ring and was interrupted by Axel and Heyman. This prompted him to make this match right here since it was night of champions. So the US title had to be put on the line. The story here was that Axel now had to compete in two matches as he would face CM Punk later on that night. The action here is really good with Kofi as usual bouncing all over the place showing his athleticism. Axel would ground him though throughout the match like landing that dropkick while Kofi came off the top. Axel keeps the belt here despite some close calls, great opener.

2.[DIVAS TITLE]AJ LEE VS NATALYA VS BRIE BELLA VS NAOMI-this was a better match than we usually get from the Divas. Of course Natalya is always great and even sinks in a double sharpshooter here. But it would be AJ keeping the belt after taking advantage of situations throughout.

3.[WORLD TITLE]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS RVD-this was a good match up with RVD being the home town boy. The action is back and forth with a quick pace. RVD looks really good here with more of the high flying maneuvers. Del Rio works RVD over when he gets the chance and ends up getting DQd giving RVD the win.

4. THE MIZ VS FANDANGO-this was one of those filler matches that most events have now a days but in all honesty I liked it. This match is better than it gets credit for as both men do very well here. Fandango may not have taken off like expected but he is good. As far as Miz I have always been a fan of his and both deliver a good match. Of course Miz wins by figure four like he has been doing lately but prior it was a competitive match.

5.[NO DQ]CM PUNK VS CURTIS AXEL & PAUL HEYMAN-this match was just pure fun. The story was Punk wanted to get his hands of Heyman and had to face both guys to do it. Throughout the match Punk would deal with Axel to then go after Heyman only. This of course lead to Axel always going back to blindside Punk. Eventually though since this was an elimination match Punk was able to get rid of Axel and chase Heyman all over the place. He lit him up with the kendo stick and even cuffed him but Ryback would come from nowhere to save the day. The best thing about this match was Heymans reactions and facial expressions throughout, I loved it.

6.[US TITLE]DEAN AMBROSE VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-two of my favorite wrestlers do battle with each other here and deliver a really good match. There were a lot of high spots here including a top rope x-factor that nearly took Ambrose out. This was a back and forth affair that ended up being one of the best of the night. Dean gets the win here and keeps the belt for The Shield.

7.[TAG TITLE]SETH ROLLINS & ROMAN REIGNS VS THE PRIME TIME PLAYERS-since The Shield was already out there they stayed at ringside to wait for the match to start. The Players won a match earlier in the night to get the title shot so along with Axel they competed twice in one night. This was a really good tag match in which The Players did a great job here. Titus looked like a beast at points and Young is great so they gave The Shield a run for their money. But Rollins and Reigns were too much along with Dean and retain the titles. Still this was a really good tag encounter.

8.[WWE TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS DANIEL BRYAN-possibly the best match of the night with these two going at it. The action is great and the story is fun with Triple H not letting anyone get involved in the match. This rivalry felt real to me so the match seemed important although the next night on Raw was crazy. Bryan of course wins the belt here after a hard fought match. Randy was vicious as always and Bryan just kept on fighting going back and forth. Great match to end the night on.

BONUS

1.[TAG TEAM TURMOIL MATCH]THE USOS VS PRIME TIME PLAYERS VS TONS OF FUNK VS REAL AMERICANS VS 3MB-the match starts out with 3MB against Tons of Funk and it goes well until a big mishap has the fans booing. After 3MB is out the Real Americans get to ring and shortly take the big boys out. This brings out the Usos who do very well at first but they are soon eliminated. Next we get the final team being the Prime Time Players and like the rest it does not take long for them to win this one.",1384905600,2,4414,4.247914183551847
5834833,4,B00DNF1STG,"My son is a huge wrestling fan and I decided to take him to see it live. I you've never been to a live recorded event, it is different than what you experience on television. The crowd, atmosphere, the action makes it worth it. Though this may not have been the best pay per view, I thought it was good.

The matches were entertaining and had a good pace and the WWE title match was great. I would've like to see CM Punk win but... this is the WWE of course. I'll be buying this dvd as a keep sake for my son. I would recommend any WWE fan to see a live event and judge it for yourself.",1381276800,,586,3.9243697478991595
5834834,3,B00DNF1STG,"Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel vs. Kofi Kingston - Due to Axel & Paul Heyman interrupting Triple H at the start of the show, he was put in a last minute title match against the man who holds a non-title win over him.  Kofi started off hot with kicks & punches causing Axel to keep breaking his momentum by either going to the ropes or the outside before eventually mounting some offense with a dropkick & clothesline over the top before Kofi was able to counter his momentum with a top rope spinning crossbody but missed another top rope leap allowing Axel to capitalize with moves like a belly to back suplex that landed Kofi on his head as both men traded momentum with Kofi delivering a DDT & top rope crossbody & S.O.S. while Axel executed a powerful clothesline & catching Kofi in mid-air with a dropkick & one sick looking neck breaker that drilled Kofi into the mat.  This was a good athletic opening match between both men.

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Natayla vs. Brie Bella vs. Naomi - With A.J. being outspoken about the ""Total Divas"" reality show, all of her challengers singled her out from the very beginning working her over & throwing her into the barricade taking her out of the match before it became ""every diva for herself"" with some highlights like Naomi's athleticism with a head scissors takeover & attempted high crossbody and Natayla executing a double sharpshooter while A.J. kept trying to steal the win off other's work & using the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" by keeping the other divas out of the ring while she worked on one individually.  This was a decent match.

World Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Rob Van Dam - RVD took control early on with standing moonsaults both in the ring & off the apron followed by his trademark twisting ledrop onto Del Rio laying on the barricade before Del Rio went on the offensive with his own suicide dive headbutt & various kicks to the head including an enziguri kick to the back of RVD's head on the apron.  Both men continued to trade momentum with RVD going over & off the top rope with legdrops & sidekicks & rolling thunder while Del Rio delivered a tilt-a-wirl back breaker & double stomp to the back & was able to counter a rolling thunder into a backstabber along as they just went back & forth with RVD's leg scissors takeover & split leg moonsault followed by Del Rio's knock out kick & block to the frog splash.  This was a good solid encounter between both men but I felt that their non-title match on SmackDown weeks earlier was a better encounter with the finish not coming off well.

The Miz vs. Fandango - Miz was dominate in the early going while also mocking Fandango causing Summer Rae to cause a distraction for Fandango to gain the advantage as he focused on Miz's midsection kick as to the ribs when Miz was coming off the top rope & sitting bearhug while later being able to deliver his top rope legdrop while Miz was hanging on the ropes but Miz started to focus on the legs with a dropkick to the knee tied in the ropes & taking advantage of a mistake by Fandango with the figure four.  They tried to tell a story by each man working over a body part but let's be honest in that this was a feud that really nobody cared about as the audience was pretty much dead throughout the match & the announcers were more focused about talking about sports teams than the match itself.

No Disqualification/Elimination Match: C.M. Punk vs. Curtis Axel & Paul Heyman - Paul Heyman looked like a defeated man throughout the night with Punk showing that he had a different mindset than usual with his ""It's Clobbering Time"" phrase being replaced with the statement ""TIME TO DIE!""  Both Axel & Punk started out with dueling kendo sticks before Punk was able to take control & go straight for Heyman the first moment his could but Axel took advantage of Punk being focused on Heyman to use the cane himself on Punk's back & head before both men were able to use the steel chair with Axel being sent into it wedged in the corner while Axel used it to block Punk's offense on the outside followed by both men continuing the use the kendo stick.  What everyone knew was going to happen did with the match eventually coming down to Punk vs. Heyman with Paul running through the stage area & crowd the fastest I've ever seen him run before Punk eventually caught him & systematically punished him with the kendo stick & handcuffs before Heyman was saved from ""the bully"" to the point where Punk had a pretty visible cut over this back shoulder.  This match itself was good for what it was designed to be with the use of the weapons between both Punk & Axel while telling the story of Axel being able to take advantage of Punk's attention being split between him & Heyman along with Heyman's facials & reactions throughout the match.

United States Champion Dean Ambrose vs. Dolph Ziggler - Ambrose started out grounding Dolph with the hammerlock & keeping control to the point where he started to mock Dolph causing Dolph to react taking Dean down & delivering a heavy amount of repeated elbow drops but Ambrose was able to make a comeback catching & drilling him into mat followed by using such tactics as running his face in the match & back rake while choking Dolph with his own arms & a double underhook superplex before Dolph took the air himself giving Dean a top rope X-Factor & later his trademark sleeper & famouser as both men back & forth trading close near falls.  This was a solid encounter.

Tag Team Champions The Shield vs. Primetime Players - The Players won a gauntlet match on the pre-show to earn the tag title match here as Seth Rollins tried to show off early only for Titus O'Neal to catch him & easily toss him around the ring following by Young knocking him down with an elbow show while Roman Reigns kept getting knocked to the outside causing The Shield to attempt to work over & double team Young in their corner for a bit before Titus was able to come in & just run through Rollings & briefly dominate with his power as it took tactics from The Shield such as a referee distraction to once again have things work in their favor.  I'll have to give credit here to the Primetime Players as this was the best I can ever recall them working together as a team while this was a rare PPV encounter where The Shield was facing an actual team instead of group of individuals & it showed as it did look like they were in trouble a few times resulting in a solid encounter but missing the drama as I doubt anyone expected anything other than the result we got based off how this match was setup & lack of interaction between the teams leading up to this match.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Daniel Bryan - Triple H made it clear at the beginning of the show that there was to be no outside interference during this match as Bryan started working over Orton's arm with yanks & kicks directly to it only for Orton to catch Bryan with a back breaker on the second rope & grounding him with a chinlock while keeping him with clotheslines & the Garvin Stomp but Bryan kept coming with running dropkicks & flying clothesline while also taking it to the air with a top rope frankensteiner, missle dropkick, and suicide dives whenever Orton rolled to the outside only for Orton to catch Bryan hit some offense like the hanging DDT on the outside & belly to back suplex but Bryan was just unstoppable with his offense like the Yes Lock, flying headbutt, and running knee.  This was a very good match but was just like the World Championship match where they had better matches on free TV a short time earlier along with the fact that the finish ended up hurting the match (although we didn't know about it until the next night) but it was still a very good match overall.

I'll give credit to competitors like Primetime Players for giving what I thought was their best match to date along with Curtis Axel leaving a lasting impression showing heavy work ethic doing double duty in two completely different types of matches but overall this PPV was definitely a step down from the previous SummerSlam & Money In The Bank as there as the matches ranged from good to solid but was a case where either we had better matches from the competitors on free TV or given a real reason to care about the match.  In the end, I would recommend for a rental or stream.",1380499200,,8345,4.469776609724048
5834835,4,B00DNF1STG,"The main event was a back forth soon to be classic.  The undercard was pretty good too.  What makes this PPV so good is the fact that Cena was not at the ppv.  I hope this is a sign of things to come, but I doubt it.  So I'll enjoy the next few weeks without him.",1379289600,2,263,3.642857142857143
5834836,4,B00DNF1STG,"The Tag Team Turmoil match while still fun & exciting,it was also a bit hectic,exhausting and give teams little time to show what they can really do. The Intercontinental title match between Curtis Axel & Kofi Kingston had great chemistry and had lots of great near falls and awareness of timing and psychology to boot. The 4 way Divas title match(AJ Lee-Natalya-Brie Bella-Naomi) felt flat with lots of goofs yet still entertaining and memorable. The Worlds title match between Alberto Del Rio & Rob Van Dam was like MVP's WWE debut:over-promised and under-delivered. The Miz-Fandango match was just filler and nothing more. The NO-DQ Handicap Elimination match between CM Punk against Curtis Axel & Paul Heyman was a hardcore,smash-mouth personal brawl with a twist ending to boot. The United States title match between Dean Ambrose & Dolph Ziggler was short but sweet. The Tag Team title match between The Shield(Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins) & The Prime Time Players(Darren Young & Titus O'Neil) while not bad,it felt rushed at best. The WWE title match between Randy Orton & Daniel Bryan was a back-and-forth,hard-hitting,fun bout. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1379289600,4,1166,5.046632124352332

8594834,2,B00DNF1STG,"The Wwe had a hot commodity when Daniel Bryan, who was already a rising fan favorite, won the WWE title from John Cena and was then swerved by Triple H and the newly christened Authority. This was the first major step in Bryan's journey to revenge, victory and validation; unfortunately, the show as a whole seemed like an afterthought and almost every match felt like it didn't get out of first gear.

Not Worth Watching: Superstars like the Miz, Fandango, RVD, Alberto Del Rio and the divas failed to make the most of their airtime at this show and half the card cell flat. Most of these wrestlers had better encounters on television before and after the event. Specifically disappointing was CM punk's handicap match with Paul Heyman and Curtis Axel that had a good story, but the crowd turned on it when it spun its wheels for 15 minutes until the ending.

Worth Watching: Axel and Kofi Kingston had a solid opener, the Shield were part of two solid (albeit short) matches that got the crowd motivated. None of these were great, but they were sufficient undercard bouts.

Match of the Night: Randy Orton and Daniel Bryan clashed in a good solid main event for the title. It reminded me of a WCW TV Title match from 1997-8 between guys like Benoit and Booker T; it was physical, bruising match but didn't have a ton of chain wrestling or a fluid pace like most WWE matches.

Night of Champions wasn't a very good event, and it's mediocrity was made even worse since SummerSlam was SO good. Because of the storyline that nullified Bryan's title win he next night, there really is t a reason to watch this show at all.",1407542400,,1619,4.553264604810996
