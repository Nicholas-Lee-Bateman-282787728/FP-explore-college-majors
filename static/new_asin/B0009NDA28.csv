8063432,5,B0009NDA28,"From 1975: Two TV comedy veterans, Phil Silvers (""Sgt. Bilko"") & Jean Stapleton (""All in the Family"") are guests (Vicki Lawrence is not on this show; curiously, her absence is never mentioned! This leaves Harvey Korman as the sole regular). Included: Carol opens the show with a hysterical send-up of gal-pal Cher; a terrace sketch has neighboring couples (Carol & Phil, Jean & Harvey) clearly mis-matched to each other; Jean shows her versatility singing ""Am I In Love (Or Am I Losing My Mind?)""; the show's annual montage of commercial parodies; two frumpy women (Carol, Jean) sit on a stoop & talk & sing about ""flings""; Carol & Harvey trade barbs as they reprise ""The Old Folks""; a man (Harvey) graciously opens a door for a woman (Jean) which gets him a lecture on ""feminist rights""; and the finale is a musical-comedy ""battle of the sexes"" in the army. Watch Phil get scandalously naughty with Harvey during the closing credits.
From 1976: The wonderful Dick Van Dyke returns as guest. Included: An inept police detective (Tim, who else?) interrogates a suspected couple (Harvey, Vicki); Carol & Dick in a funny musical-comedy bit that gets messy with paints; two wallflowers (Carol, Dick) ramble on with one another during a dance; and in the finale, Carol does a first-rate Shirley Temple impression in the spoof ""Little Miss Showbiz"" (listen carefully when Dick flubs the word ""broadway"").
Another superior-quality, worthy addition to ""The Carol Burnett Show"" DVD collection!",1265328000,,1484,5.061224489795919
