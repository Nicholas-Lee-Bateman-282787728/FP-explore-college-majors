4693136,5,B005GP7EUI,"This movie won't disappoint you! If you only have time to watch one christmas movie or hallmark movie this year, please watch this one! The women takes her children who the father abandoned them, has no money and has to find a place to live, and finds work in a small town's cafe. This movie shows us the true meaning of Christmas, putting your faith and believing! I loved it!",1322438400,50,377,4.4
4693137,5,B005GP7EUI,"My family and I watched this movie the past week and thoroughly enjoyed it. Many Lifetime and Hallmark movies are either tearjerkers, or have a storyline that is a little hard to swallow. This one had good acting, warm hometown flavor, and moved along at a very good pace. It was over before we knew it, and we were actually wishing it would continue. It had a few tender moments, but they weren't sappy or overdone. The whole cast was excellent and I would recommend this movie to anyone out there.",1322438400,97,499,4.4945054945054945
4693138,3,B005GP7EUI,"While this story is realistic in the broken family, homeless vein, how a whole town instantly falls in love with the main character is a bit of a mystery.  I mean she seems very nice and she has a sad story but she suddenly converts the town grouch, the cop falls for her the instant he sets his eyes on her, and everything falls neatly into place at the end.  I know that Hallmark likes sappy and happy but not a lot of substance here with the ending already predetermined in the first 15 minutes.  Talk about dropping hints - anvils were falling every ten minutes!  You could see the whole root beer storyline coming a mile away.",1322265600,7,631,4.322033898305085
4693139,5,B005GP7EUI,"I watched this movie over the weekend, and I really loved it!  There was a part where I even cried, this movie touches your heart and is something the entire family can watch.  I am pre-purchasing this dvd, so that the whole family can watch it again and again during the Christmas season.  If you like family movies with a good ending, then you won't regret purchasing this DVD.",1321833600,4,379,4.463768115942029
4693140,5,B005GP7EUI,"This is far from the usual simple Christmas fare, much heartier and warmer, with good acting (I hardly recognized Edward Hermann!), a realistic plot (especially in today's hard times), and many wonderful laughs to be enjoyed.  I went right to Amazon to buy a copy for my family. Don't miss this one; it's going to be a Christmas classic.",1321747200,62,337,4.711864406779661
4693141,1,B005GP7EUI,"Just a hokey, bad acting, unrealistic ""movie"" where the script should have been left in the drawer.  Watch ""Christmas in the Heartland"" instead.  Better plotline, moving and with real actors.",1517702400,,191,5.333333333333333

4693186,5,B005GP7EUI,"I usually absolutely despise the type of Christmas movie that typically airs on the Hallmark channel (I am not a fan of sappy romance stories), but I fell in love with this story.  It depicts a struggling, newly-single mother at Christmas time and the way that a community comes together to help her.  There is a small romance side story, but the movie is really about a mother's relationship with her young children.  The child actors in this movie are all outstanding and I'm shocked they have not been seen in much since the movie was made.  Overall this film is a sweet inspiring story and I love to watch it every Christmas!",1484006400,,629,4.539823008849558

Poor Mom does everything she can for her kids (one her own and one her stepson who she loves like he was her very own - a really nice addition to showing how family is more than blood) despite overwhelming odds and desperate times. The local diner people become family. Wonderful family movie. Great ending. Much Tear-jerking. Christie Swanson and the late Edward Herrmann (RIP Richard Gilmore) are superb.,1481932800,2,462,4.7875

4693239,1,B005GP7EUI,"Clearly I am in the minority here but I thought this movie was not even remotely close to being good.

The acting was horrid, parts of the storyline were ridiculous (leaving your husband forever and taking your stepchild with you..um, isn't that called ""kidnapping""?), having a 5th grader watch a 3 year old child overnight with instructions to walk to the motel office - in the middle of the night - to use their phone if anything goes wrong (I think I saw a horror film with that scenario!), the fact that a woman picks up and leaves town with 3 kids because her husband is such a loser but then turns around and falls for the first man she meets...I could go on & on...

I wanted to like this movie. Really I did.  I bought it for my husband because he enjoys Edward Herrmann's work but I couldn't even finish watching this movie, it was so insipid.

I love Christmas. I love movies. I love Hallmark. I love Hallmark Christmas movies. I watch them throughout the year and own at least 25 of them on DVD. This was lousy.  My advice: Don't waste your time on this one.",1451088000,2,1069,4.325

4693247,3,B005GP7EUI,"Sometimes I can't believe what a picky bastard I can be, although there's probably a ton of people out there who think I have low standards for watching Hallmark Channel holiday movies!

At any rate, although I haven't seen a lot of Hallmark holiday movies, aside from ""The Christmas Ornament"" (reviewed herein) this's the only other Hallmark holiday movie that I can get into. These two movies have a couple of things in common. A sense of reality and skillful performances by the lead actresses (Kellie Martin in The Christmas Ornament and Kristy Swanson in A Christmas Wish).

Getting back to what makes me so picky, I felt compelled to dock A Christmas Wish one full star for its final scene, where (just about) the entire cast is walking away from what is to become Kristy Swanson's home toward the church down the road. What bugs the hell out of me about this scene? Everyone is out of character! It's as if the director called cut and everyone put on their ""I'm off to the Craft Services caterer to have lunch"" face, especially Kristy Swanson and the actor who plays her new cop boyfriend. Swanson just completely and totally drops her ""I'm overwhelmed and grateful for all you've done for me and my kids"" demeanor and strides off to the lunch wagon as carefree as could be. I mean, what the hell happened here? Did the director accidentally keep the camera rolling after calling cut and then forget to reshoot the scene and was stuck with this...?

This is a great example and lesson that says ""give people a chance and they will bend over backwards to help you"". I really loved the side of Edward Hermann that I had never seen before. They say he was a lot like his character in the movie, that he was in real life, and I liked him a lot. It made it even more special since he passed away this pass Christmas Season. The children in the cast, I thought, did a very good job given their young age. Especially Miles.

4693310,4,B005GP7EUI,"For some reason, can't remember why, I didn't expect much from this movie, but found it to be surprisingly good.  It's about a Mom with 3 kids:  one her daughter from another marriage, a baby with her current husband and the husband's son from another marriage.  The problem is that Dad just ran off with another woman and took almost everything but the old car and a little money.  Mom takes the kids and the car and leaves.
  She finds a town and a place to stay.  She also takes a job, but that will not be the end of their problems.  But there is always hope and as she warms up to the townsfolk, they too warm up to her.
  The basic premise is nothing new, but I find that the details are always interesting and, in this case, they're interesting and entertaining.",1419120000,3,769,4.277777777777778

I don't know if this is a made-for-TV movie, but it could certainly never have been in a theater.  The little girl who plays the older daughter does a good job of acting, but for the most part this movie is corny and badly acted.

4693331,5,B005GP7EUI,"Martha Evans (Kristy Swanson) abandons her trailer, taking with her, her two daughters, Mel and Lilee, and her step-son, Miles. Marthas husband has left them penniless after taking all their money and leaving nothing but a note. Martha leaves town in hopes of finding a job and a place that she and her family can stay. She finally lands in a small rural town, working at a diner and staying at a motel. Things start to go from bad to worse when her car breaks down, what little money she has going to bills, and the fact that they may soon not even be able to stay at the motel. Fear not, though, as things behind the scenes are working to help Martha and her children during the holiday season.

This was a beautiful, soft paced film that warmed my heart. I loved how Martha tried hard to make things work for her family, even with the odds against her. She loved all her children, including Miles who Marthas step-son and left by his father. Just the same, Martha loves Miles as if he were her own. Its Mel, Marthas daughter, who tries to make everyone remember the spirit of Christmas and believes that God will help them, even as Martha fears that Hes abandoned her as well.

Its not magic that saves Christmas for the Evans, but the kindness and love of the towns residence that theyve come to know and respect. This film does not end with a spectacular finale, rather, just as the rest of the story, its light, loving, and sweet.

Family Friendly: Yes, this is definitely a family friendly, heartwarming tale which is faith based.

Romantic: This was more of a drama focused on family and faith than the romance. There is a start to a romance, though, between Martha and Joe (the local sheriff) that I found to just add more charm to this story.

Holiday-ish: Yes, this movie shows us not the magic of, but the spirit of Christmas for both adults and children.

Rewatch: Yes, Ill be adding this movie to my list of Christmas movies to watch again. Next time, though, Ill have to remember to have Kleenex with me.

4693384,3,B005GP7EUI,"Very simplistic plot and limited character development.  I found that the storyline required a lot of suspending disbelief, particularly at the beginning.  I wondered why this mom took her kids from a roof over their heads to a seemingly random road trip with essentially no money and no plan.  And if you're homeless and nearly penniless, why, when choosing a direction to drive randomly would you choose NORTH?  It was December.  North is cold.  There were many expressions of  religious faith made by the older daughter.  The mother basically professed to being a disbeliever.  Definitely not going on my (long) list of favorite Christmas movies.

The big plus for me in watching this movie was that there was actually a menu including ""set Up"" so I could select the closed captioning and the CC was excellent.",1387584000,2,813,4.911764705882353

4693386,5,B005GP7EUI,"I first saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel.  Christy Swanson was superb as a suddenly single mother with an uncaring, jerk of a husband who actually leaves her with his son, as well as her two kids.  It's a movie about doing what's right, feeling like a total failure and then being validated and redeemed. I tear up just thinking about the scene where she's at the bus stop down on her knees talking to God and pleading.  It's an awesome family movie about loving - no matter what and I would highly recommend it for the holidays",1387238400,,534,4.373737373737374

4693425,4,B005GP7EUI,"So here's another holiday picture that celebrates the values of Smalltown, America, and you can't hate on that. In A CHRISTMAS WISH Kristy Swanson plays the destitute Martha Evans (Kristy Swanson), mother of three, abandoned by her deadbeat husband but not before he'd drained her bank account. Unable to afford their home Martha and the kids drive north, haphazardly. Martha is scared to death and trying to comfort her children and desperately crossing her fingers. In the tiny town of Mapleton she lands a beyond minimum wage job as a waitress at the local diner. This is when their new lives begin.

Some folks may grouch that the narrative plods along and that nothing major happens, and that's fine. A CHRISTMAS WISH, which first aired in 2011 on the Hallmark Channel, relies on its small moments of triumph. If you end up seeing this movie, you may be inspired by Martha's perseverance, given that her world had just crumbled. Kristy Swanson is terrific here. She isn't heroic like when she played Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She's heroic in ways that are more relatable. I love how untiring Martha is in her kind treatment of the children, two of whom aren't biologically her own.

And that's another strength of the film, how good the kid actors are. Kevin Lee Herring III plays the troubled step-son Miles, stricken with a stammer and often bullied in school. The adorable award goes to the three-year-old wrecking ball Lily (Lilee Clyde?). Lily is referred to as ""the ninja baby"" for her knack of wreaking havoc without anyone noticing until it's too late. But if anyone can steal the ninja baby's thunder, it's sweet Mel (Kirstin Dorn), the family's ""little believer."" Maybe the biggest reason I like this film is its sensitive portrayal of a child's enduring faith. Kirstin Dorn is marvelous.

So, no, there aren't sensational, sweeping gestures, not as such. Instead we witness a mother's unflagging love for her children and how, when times were at last at their bleakest, she's rewarded by a community pulling together. The supporting cast is solid, with special mention reserved for Tess Harper as the kindly diner owner who gives Martha a chance and Edward Herrman as the cantankerous old man with, you guessed it, a heart of gold. A CHRISTMAS WISH is a low-key slice of life, given luster by virtue of a sensitive treatment and the cast's grounded performances. I'm a bit bummed that we never do learn the recipe for the perfect root beer.",1360886400,,2456,4.856801909307876

It was about a young mom, Martha Evans (played by Kristy Swanson) with three kids who are abandoned by her sleazy husband who adds insult to injury by cleaning out their savings before he takes off. She packs up the kids in search of a future, landing in a town that lies in the middle of nowhere, unable to afford even the price of a motel room, with barely a few weeks until Christmas.

Martha's luck begins to change ever so slowly when the motel owner (played by Mike Hagerty) let's her have a motel room without cash in advance. Tess Harper (played by Trudy Williams) gives her a job at her diner, where, lo' and behold' she runs into the local police officer K.C. Clyde (played by Joe Hopkins), who can barely order a smittenburger on whiskey to stay. She finds a babysitter, and a local pastor willing to find her a more permanent home. Edward Hermann is the local grouch without a kind word for anyone except the beautiful and vivacious Martha and her step son, the son of the dadgrinch who stole their Christmas. A Christian theme permeates the movie but is not overdone.

Debbie obviously loved the movie, and I bow to her tastes and judgment if I don't want to be denied everything except a bucket of coal this holly, jolly Christmas. I was bored with this by the first 14 minutes. For me, there was no suspense on what the ending would be. I did enjoy seeing Mike Haggerty and Edward Hermann reunited in this film. They did ""Overboard"" together. This is a great film for the ladies especially, and the children who might need a lesson in the true spirit of Christmas. As for me,

Also the 'pastor' in the show is really an LDS bishop, though that cannot be stated in the show. Being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon) that is why I enjoyed this program. The sheriff in the program is a member of the church also.

This film presents a pleasing story of family tragedy and hope.

Martha Evans ( Kristy Swanson) and three children are abandoned by her husband.  This guy is the classic case of irresponsible males.  He empties their bank accounts and leaves with most of their money, deserting his wife, her two daughters and a step son, to survive on their own.  Martha, who is unable to earn enough to support the family, loads up the children and moves north in hope of a better life.
 .
After traveling a log distance, Martha stops at a small town, finds an inexpensive room and secures a job as a waitress in a small 24 hour caf&eacute;.  She struggles for days, cares for the children, and makes friends.  Meanwhile the children grieve the abandonment by their father and wonder if that means they are not loved and not worthy of care.

Slowly the children adjust and become a family.  But their only car breaks down and the innkeeper informs her that she must move as he rented her room to a business.  Desperate and without hope, Martha prays for help.

This is a feel good story.  The townspeople accept Martha and her children and help her survive.

Short summary (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS):
Martha's (Kristy Swanson) husband leaves her and her children (2 daughters and a stepson) two weeks before Christmas. He leaves them with nothing except an old car and a little money that she had hidden. She makes a hard decision to move her family to another town to start over. There are several ""bumps"" along the way but can Martha make this a Christmas that the family will never forget? Watch and find out for yourself.
