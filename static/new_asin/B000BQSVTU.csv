8324047,5,B000BQSVTU,"Also known as BLOOD MONEY, this is one of my all time favourite Spaghetti Westerns. I saw it in the theatre in a double feature way back in the late seventies and managed to pick up the VHS version in the early eighties.
The plot line is really original, the humour is right on the mark, and Lee Van Cleef plays his most likeable rogue character in any of his Westerns I've seen. I'm not too sure whether it's the first Kung Fu western but in my book it's the best.
The ""Blood Money"" VHS copy I have, unfortunately, has a tear in the centre of the picture (original FILM print)that lasts a good 5 -6 minutes into the film but if you can let that slide, as an issue, this is one Spag Western you should add to your collection.
I'm really, really, waiting for the DVD version to come out but in the meantime the VHS copy I have is sharp, and clear, so will suffice till then. It was issued by ""Video Classics"".",1207612800,6,908,4.1647727272727275
