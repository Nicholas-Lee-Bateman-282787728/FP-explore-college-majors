7753547,5,B01G2FHUC2,"Chosen,really surprised me,i seen some of the negative reviews on this movie and positive reviews,so i had to find out for myself. After watching it,i will definitely conclude the positive reviews are right. This is a very good movie about  the struggle of the Jews during world war two. I all so read that it is about real events and that makes it even more positive to me,you will not waste you money if you buy this movie,its really good.",1472515200,4,441,4.5125
7753548,4,B01G2FHUC2,Enjoyed the movie very much.,1472256000,,28,4.8
7753549,5,B01G2FHUC2,"Most of the time we think of the war as an America, England, Germany, and Japan episode, but there were many other countries that took part in the war, and they had many heroes. I had always wondered why the Jewish people did not rise up against the Nazis. This movie shows that there was and uprising. Although over 6 million Jews and other people were exterminated by the Nazi Party, some fought back. Hate is like a bottomless cup, it keeps pouring and pouring.",1471996800,2,464,4.470588235294118

7753552,2,B01G2FHUC2,Haven't even watched 25% of this movie and see Hungarian troops walking around with SKS rifles which were only used by the Soviet army on a limited trial basis during the final months of WWII. Not really hard to get that stuff right.,1471305600,3,233,4.441860465116279
7753553,2,B01G2FHUC2,"Meh.  If you have $3.99 burning a hole in your account or, you're waiting for medical marijuana to take hold, I suppose that this movie may be for you.  Harry Keitel's performance is abysmal as are the special effects.  In fact, there was one explosion near that end that actually had us saying ""Now THAT one looked real.""  If we had known, we wouldn't have chosen... Chosen.",1471219200,2,375,4.552238805970149

7753555,5,B01G2FHUC2,"PLOT SPOILER (?) REVIEW

The film is based on a true story. Pappy (Harvey Keital) tells his grandson Max (Julian Shatkin) the story of a true hero for his school 1,000 word essay. He did not tell him it was his autobiography and the kid didn't take notes.

This is a flashback story of Sonson (Luke Mably), an Hungarian Jewish lawyer who in 1943 had the job of making big stones into small ones. After the German occupation, his wife (Diana Cavallioti) dies because Jews were not allowed medicine, making his life of neutrality difficult. His sister-in-law Judith (Ana Ularu) is placed on a train and sent to Poland. Vowing to rescue her (she was actually doing fine on her own) Sonson walks to Poland, dresses up as an SS general and leads an underground rebellion.

Sonson was a dry reluctant hero who was void of character and voice for much of the film, showing how true heroes are humble and ""just a man."" Harvey Keital, the headliner has a small role as the story teller. Luke Mably was on the screen for most of the film.

Guide: No swearing or nudity. Clothed rape scene. 4 1/2 stars",1469836800,9,1091,4.494949494949495
7753556,1,B01G2FHUC2,"The plot of the film is that a young boy asks his grandpops, played by Harvey Ketiel, who his hero is. Mr Keitel then goes into the past and his experiences in Hungary during World War II. This is some guy called Sonson. So we are transported back to the era and so the story begins. Sonson loses his wife and then must find his sister in law who has been transported to Poland by the brutish gendarmerie of the Hungarian police.

I cant say any more in case I give too much of the plot away so PLOT SPOILERS next****

The acting is woeful in places but I can forgive that but it is the historical errors that I found insulting so I shall list some in no particular order.

 The resistance travel about occupied Poland with no ID cards and the Germans never even ask for Sonsons at a checkpoint to the Warsaw Ghetto for his  oh and hes carrying a stolen Ss uniform too.
 A virtual platoon of SS uniforms left in the open for Sonsosn and co to use and of course they all fit the resisters.
 I spotted AK 47s  there is a clue as to when they were invented in the name (ie the 47 bit) and this is supposed to be 1943 to 1944.
 The Germans speak in English until they get upset and then its all Mein Gott in Himmel etc.
 The Ghetto is in the middle of nowhere not the centre of Warsaw.
 The final battle is in a farmyard.
 The BBC World service seems to be fixated on the movement of Jewish convoys  really!!
 Sonson blows a bag of grenades up on a tank track and is not injured some 5 foot from the blast.
 The Russias actually turn up to save the uprising like the bleedin 7th Cavalry that got me angry when that happened.
 Then the Red Army decorate the Poles and Jews.
Now the mistakes here would be laughable if it were not so insulting to those people who fought and suffered and were let down by the Russians and the rest of Poland who did not join them  oh they do here in case you were wondering.
Any of the good points to this dross like cinematography or SFX are missed in a miasma of made up guff and mawkish sentimentality that had me gagging. The makers should be ashamed of themselves and there have been complaints too about the portrayal of the Hungarian Gendarmerie so quite a few own goals. I have seen better accuracy and honest representation of facts in a Donald Trump interview  avoid like a self immolation contest.",1497052800,2,2335,4.197309417040358
7753557,1,B01G2FHUC2,"I wanna give it two stars for effort, but the end killed that because it left me saying, ""f**** you, old man."" It's plot is a mashup of most WWII occupied territory movies with quite incredibly dumb Germans. We are talking Hogans Heroes levels of dumb. And while all the heroes are amazingly expert marksman, the Nazis' shooting ability is rivaled only by an Imperial Storm Trooper. Don't get me wrong, trashing nazis is great, have at it, but when it comes to producing a docudrama, how about trying to smash Saving Private Ryan, Defiance, and Princess Bride all in one. Effort, but not a lot of thought out into it.",1494460800,,617,4.5675675675675675

7753569,1,B01G2FHUC2,"Perhaps I've watched too many really good movies about WW2 and the Holocaust, because I found ""Chosen"" to be inferior work; and this subject matter deserves better treatment. ""Chosen"" took the cheap and lazy route with loud music attempting to provide suspense and intensity, when the very subject of the film inherently provides these. After watching movies like ""Uprising"";  ""Perlasca"";  ""Korzcak"";  ""Good Evening Mr. Wallenberg"";  and ""Escape from Sorbibor"",  it is difficult to accept the mediocrity of ""Chosen"".",1479600000,8,516,5.564102564102564

7753577,3,B01G2FHUC2,"It was kind of slow but good story line. They could have left the rape scenes out.takes away the educational opportunity for younger kids.
Questions: who was the old lady who reviewed the girls and then whispered something into the Hungarian captains ear, and what did she whisper to have Judith taken away? What were the pills Sonson was taking when he got to the house of the Polish resistance?",1476489600,3,396,4.671428571428572

7753594,4,B01G2FHUC2,"Chosen w/Harvey Keitel  - This was a good independent film about living as a Jew under Nazi rule.

8762124,5,B01G2FHUC2,"Chosen (2016) has the greatest knife justice / revenge scene by four young women after being raped by nazi scum.  The successes of the resistance fighters were uplifting, but only with the acceptable suspension of disbelief necessary as with Tarentinos Inglorious Basterds, a similar movie.  Tarentinos rendition was more glossy Hollywood, but a less compelling movie, though still great as well.",1515974400,,396,5.475409836065574
