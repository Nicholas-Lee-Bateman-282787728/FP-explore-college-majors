1144575,2,788579816X,"This is a sequel to the first ""If you are the One"" - which is a gem.  Since I wanted to find out what happens between the two lovers who found each other through a Chinese dating service, I decided to buy this sequel rather than waiting to rent it on Netflix.

It is a bland movie without much witty dialogues as in the earlier one.  One will not miss anything without seeing the sequel, imho.  They got married and live happily after even though to reach that point, they experienced some challenges.",1348963200,,501,4.354838709677419
1144576,5,788579816X,"First of all, I was lucky to buy this DVD , since I tried to find this out at DVD shops ( internet ) , not so easy ... I saw this DVD on Amazon 1 year ago but no in Nov. time 2011.
However the shop put it back and I could get it with low price ... ( less than 13 us$ )...

The first movie was so popular in W.W. and I could even watch it in Airplane, CX , JL ... ( One World )

The story is you know ... he tried to engage with his girl friend however she hesitated... then ...

Yeah... You must see the movie from the first one, then see the second, as here ...

Good service and Quick Delivery for the merchant !!!",1326758400,,616,3.574626865671642
1144577,5,788579816X,"Once again I see a movie from China that knocks me out and I reflect on how sad it is that so few people will see this. As of today, this will be only the seventh review for a movie that has been out since 2008. On the other hand, there are probably hundreds of reviews for any of a number of retreaded, predictable, juvenile, CGI-driven, product peddling, Pixar'd, cloying, and/or disturbingly violent movies that can't hold a candle to the beauty, emotional power, and sheer loveliness of If You Are the One.

Chinese favorite You Ge and the lovely Qi Shu play the two main characters and imbue their performances with nuance, genuine chemistry, and emotion. Throughout the two hours, I was moved to guffaws of laughter as well as lip-quivering tears. Xioagang Feng's poignant contemplations on love, relationships, marriage, and heartbreak struck nerve after nerve in me.

It saddens me that what passes for wisdom in Hollywood offerings usually reflects not so much our shared global humanity but rather our peculiar self-absorbed ethos and our superficiality. There are movies that are quite good (I just saw The Descendents and it was very good), but the vast majority is the equivalent of fast food - garbage that appeals to the lowest common denominator. Indeed, there might be no better reflection of the decline of our society than the low number of well made movies coming out of Hollywood. How sad that, more often than not, Pixar makes the movies that touch us emotionally.

I apologize for this rant embedded in a review, but when I see such a beautiful motion picture as this one, I think how fortunate I am to have a fianc who is Chinese to even bring this director to my attention. I hope to pass on this rare find to you. Indeed, this is the kind of experience you want to share with your fellow citizens. Isn't that what these reviews are really about? Isn't it about offering your opinion for the benefit of your brothers and sisters so that they might share in what you experienced (or be forewarned)? Highly recommended.",1323907200,2,2042,4.714285714285714
1144578,1,788579816X,Got this but found it's a pirated version. Very blurry. The end of the movie was obviously taken from a camera in a movie theater. Stay away from this product.,1315612800,,159,4.333333333333333
1144579,5,788579816X,"This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  Story of love and regret, and abounding with more love.  Very touching.",1293408000,,129,4.565217391304348
1144580,5,788579816X,"If you are looking for a Hong Kong or Hollywood romantic comedy do not buy this movie.  This is a modern Chinese romantic comedy in the manner of Big Shot's Funeral also by Feng Xiaogang and his favorite male lead, Ge You.  Xiaogang uses outrageous premises that are put into motion in modern China's reality.  The roles of the women Xiaogang puts opposite Ge You are excellent especially if you have seen them in their other bodies of work.  Let me just say the segments of dating are delightfully humorous in the pursuit of a non-perfect mate for our ""hero"".

The dating segments build up what the story is about, finding love with the right person in a country where there are too many choices.  Instead of him finding love he accepts a bargain to settle for someone he rejected.  She has realized that she can never have the person that she loves but knows that life is not complete without a companion.

To start out their new life together they must go to Hokaido, Japan so she can end the old relationship and start their life together.  There is excellent Chinese humor while they are in Japan (you will laugh when he becomes a loyal Yakuza) as we learn his reluctances and it is very serious as we her reluctances.  You might even think it is going to be a Chinese tragedy but it does end up in a Chinese way as a romantic comedy.  Some parents may not want to share this film with their children as some of the conversation are frank and there is one extremely short shot of nudity from behind (so beautifully shot, set and choreographed that it is not gratuitous).

If you want a sappy, happy-go-lucky romantic comedy skip this movie.  If you want a serious yet funny movie about love then do not skip this movie, it is the one.",1280620800,7,1739,4.430817610062893
1144581,4,788579816X,"Chinese film ""If You Are the One"" is a romantic comedy, and a unique one at that. The story is about a forty-something single male Qin Fen (Ge You) looking for his future wife on the internet. One interesting thing about the mild-mannered guy (and very wealthy because of his strange ""invention"") is that he is a very honest person. Qin Fen says he is not handsome; he is not looking for someone like Angelina Jolie. He is just an ordinary man who wants to settle down.

Some of his blind dates turn out to be very unique. One beautiful woman tries to sell something unexpected to him; another is a pregnant girl who wants him to be her baby's father; even a male shows up. During his unsuccessful effort to get married, Qin Fen meets a beautiful flight attendant Smiley (Qi Shu, ""The Transporter""). He at first passes up a chance to date her, but later a strange twist of fate bring them back together, and Smiley, with a little secret of her own, agrees to marry him only on one condition, a condition that few males would feel comfortable with.

The romantic comedy is directed by Xiaogang Feng (""Assembly"" ""Legend of the Black Scorpion""), a renowned director with a string of box office hits in mainland China, and by watching his ""If You Are the One,"" you know why he has been successful. Shot against the backdrop of modern lifestyles of China, the film closely follows the story of two characters you can relate to, played by the talented cast. The story itself is nothing new, even slow-moving to some, but occasional humor (often clever references to modern Chinese society) and the director's authentic touch given to the characters make the entire film believable.

Unanimously well-acted, the film also greatly benefits from the breathtakingly beautiful landscape of Hokkaido, northern island of Japan. One huge disappointment for me is the film's wrap-up part that I think is a bit shorter than it should be, and the role of Vivian Hsu that is smaller than I expected. Still the romantic comedy is worth watching, entertaining, humorous and life-affirming.",1275609600,2,2069,4.773743016759776
1144582,4,788579816X,"This is the highest grossing film of all time in China. Hard to believe, as it's not really a remarkable film, except for Shu Qi, she's remarkable. When she asks her date if he believes in love at first sight he responds ""I loved the first sight of you!"" It's a very pleasant film. Funny, slightly quirky, it's an intimate study of two people's vulnerability, and it's thoroughly Chinese. I'm sure some of the humor was lost on me due to the fact I don't speak Mandarin! And Ge You's Mandarin accent is as thick as syrup. He does a great job playing a forty-something guy who's made his lot in life selling zany inventions and now has a very specific set of criteria he's looking for in a mate to settle down with. He meets Shu Qi and the two of them continue to meet, almost just to spite one another, neither believing there is anything there for the two of them. But love has an odd way of growing just my virtue of time spent together. This is a great 'date' movie.",1250553600,4,969,4.271739130434782
1144583,5,788579816X,"I really enjoy this film.  It has been sitting on my shelf for over a month.  Neither the title nor the cover is attractive enough.  Since my Netflex is late today, I pop this DVD into my machine.  To my surprise, this is a gem!!!!!  A superb film.  I have not seem a film this good since Caution/Lust.

7900629,5,788579816X,"I almost didn't buy this movie due to some bad reviews. Even though it might not be as great as the first one, its still a good movie, good acting, good story line, highly recommend. Received item on time like always, that's why I keep buying from Amazon. Good sound and video even though I did not buy the blu ray version, due to bad reviewers. This is not the first time I hold back due to some dumb comments. Bad reviewers should not post. If I don't like a movie for instance, I would state that the movie was lame, but to criticize it badly, makes other buyers think about it and perhaps not purchase it, like I almost did. Movie does not disappoint at all.",1433376000,,662,4.2204724409448815
