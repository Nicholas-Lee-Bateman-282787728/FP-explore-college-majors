8268994,4,B0018AHIQK,"What I like about this is it does not overcomplicate things. I coach a varsity track team, 2 coaches with 50 kids. Ya, I work for a bunch of cheapskates that really don't care. So for me this really touches on teaching points and fundamentals to build on. The kids work on these things when I can't be right there with them. Good teaching tool and a good bargain.",1463443200,,363,4.27536231884058

8268997,4,B0018AHIQK,I found the DVD very insightful. The techniques and excercises are well explained and the visuals well done.
