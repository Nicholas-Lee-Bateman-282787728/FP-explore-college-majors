7800721,5,1632502550,"I got 4 Patty Lyons DVDs as a gift from my awesome friend.  They are all amazing. I will post individual reviews about the specific content:

Advanced Fixes: This one is tied with Knitting Bag of Tricks for my all time favorite knitting class. I'm pretty good at picking up dropped stitches and other easy fixes, but I had no idea you could put in a cable after you bound off, or how to cut your knitting and replace stitches. The fixes for lace were amazing. I loved knitting the swatches and making the mistakes on purpose. Very empowering. I no longer fear cutting my knitting!!

If you ever see Patty teach live, online or as a DVD get them!!",1429574400,6,646,4.366666666666666
