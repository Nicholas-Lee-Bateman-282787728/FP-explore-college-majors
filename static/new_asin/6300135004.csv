7802891,5,6300135004,"Nathalie Nell is one of those actors that seemed to push the right button at the right time with a movie, but just as soon as they appear they go into the European theater, never to be seen in America except for a casual cameo or walkthru role in some not so important release here. What a shame!!. I have to hunt high and low in three different languages to track down some of her earlier works. And if you want to know why, all you have to do is watch this film. Agreed, that the topic is not pretty, and the rape simulation is believable enough that turns some people's head, but there is a reason why this movie is of award caliber. Simply put, it was well done from the depth of the characters and their treatment to the way the story grows on you, and without revealing the ending you will understand that the conclusion as it should was inevitable. The is another variation of the same theme made here in America under the title of ""I Spit on Your Grave!"" again the heroine is traumatized but the treatment is quite different and certanly more violent. This original play is more of the emancipated tone that reflects what society was like in the 70's in Europe. I like it.",1014940800,9,1180,4.31981981981982
