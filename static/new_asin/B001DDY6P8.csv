Cody quickly learns that Retik (Roy Barcroft), the moon's leader, is the mastermind behind a plot to invade earth, due to his planet's atmosphere deficiency. The malevolent leader enlists the help of his minion, Krog (Peter Brocco), to do his bidding--waging an underhanded war with earth. But what Retik doesn't know, is that Cody has a few tricks up his sleeve of his own.
THE GIANT GILA MONSTER
Another creation hailing from the great state of Texas, The Giant Gila Monster tells the story of a mammoth Gila Monster that terrorizes an unsuspecting town much in the same way that Godzilla did--by stomping through the city streets, crushing buildings and automobiles, knocking things over, and killing at will. When a local sports car aficionado's kid sister is nearly slain by the giant menace, he decides to take matters into his own hands and stop the monster from wreaking any more havoc.

THE PHANTOM FROM 10,000 LEAGUES
After a succession of puzzling deaths occur along the coast, Dr. Ted Stevens (Kent Taylor), a scientist, and detective William Grant (Rodney Bell), dispatched by the government, attempt to uncover who or what is responsible. But when the victims and their property betray evidence of radiation exposure, Grant begins to suspect that the Pacific College of Oceanography is involved. His suspicions are virtually confirmed when he discovers an associate of the college pacing the shore with a spear gun in hand. They then discover the trail of radiation spills from an unknown origin at the ocean's bottom, which the investigators fear is a monstrous sea beast that haunts the beach in search of prey.

THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE
In this 1950's cult classic, Dr. Cortner's (Herb Evers) central interest in medical science could be construed as beneficial to society--but not in an ethical, moralistic capacity. Instead of healing, he is attracted to the reanimation of the dead through electric shock. And when his fiance, Jan Compton (Virginia Leith), is decapitated in an accident that he causes, Dr. Cortner becomes obsessed with the idea of making her whole again. He keeps her head alive in his laboratory, in part, by a serum he has developed. Dr. Cortner searches the streets for an attractive body for Jan, but she begins to resent Bill for not allowing her to perish in the accident. Back at the lab, an embittered Jan begins to plot her revenge...

update : Received set today the transfers / sound and picture are much better than mill creek sets, it looks like they really took their time and did it right, at the start of the disks they say theyve remastered them from the original masters and apologize for any imperfections caused by time degridation. I watched 3 movies in full on a big screen tv with stereo surround and everything looked and sounded great. The packaging is really good with arms inside case for disks, disks are one sided, chapters and menues better than other value sets. One draw back is no titles on most the disks, but there is nice art work. Im happy, for this price to have classics like Aliens from Space, and The brain that wouldnt die with quality good enough I can really enjoy it on my set up is great.",1246665600,151,13895,4.992653414001729
