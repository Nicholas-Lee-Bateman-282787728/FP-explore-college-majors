1665077,5,B00005UF85,"I searched many months before finding the movie. I had rented the film and wanted it for my collection. There are not too many films that I like, but this is one that I waant to keep. I also ordered the sound track. I truly enjoyed this film , and Glenn  Plummer  & Terrance Howard I thought were great.",1049414400,2,303,4.11864406779661
1665078,1,B00005UF85,"I am so confused...first and foremost I have never in all of my years seen such ridiculousness...this is not a film,  it's not even a movie...I have actually been in school/community play productions of better merit...I wish I knew what the directors and actors were thinking.  And, maybe that is the problem they thought that we (the viewer) were in their heads.  I believe I lost a little respect for actors Terrence Howard and Glenn Plummer...I don't understand how they couldn't see the level of this work in the new millennium...considering previous work I've seen them in much longer ago...my friend who purchased the movie actually threw it away...she took it out of the trash long enough for me to view the ""travesty on film"" and mirror her exact seniments...after we viewed it she put it back where it belonged...it was such a horrible experience that she wouldn't even use the tape to tape something else...
{and I will end just like that with no closure no thrill just like the tape did (I can't even call it a movie or film)}",1039564800,3,1037,4.686813186813187
1665079,1,B00005UF85,I was soooo disappointed.  I don't even want this film in my Black DVD collection so to the bin it went.,1036022400,,104,3.9523809523809526
1665080,5,B00005UF85,"depending on where you are in life (mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc.), you will either love or hate this film. well i LOVE it and am HIGHLY recommending it to all (and i have only seen it once - so far)! my personal Lord and Savior, Jesus - the Christ, has allowed me to be so greatly humbled that i can see and appreciate beauty almost anywhere, while others - standing and looking so high - miss it!
...
if you have yet to have some of life's experiences and enrichments that will allow you to appreciate the beauty of this film, then you will miss the messages and loose the lessons. it is not often that a man will open his heart and reveal his innermost self (AND that women are allowed to see it!). this film does that, and very poetically! the words, the poetry, the prose in this film were deep, profound and thought-provoking. granted, i must concede that some things were 'ghetto-fabulous', but this particular aspect represents the other realm of the gamut to appeal to all at various levels. SO WOMEN, if you want to how a man emotes, how he thinks and WHAT he thinks, then this film is a must see! but then again, as i have said before, some people simply can not appreciate the finer things in life.",1026345600,2,1221,4.407079646017699
1665081,1,B00005UF85,"As a viewer from the U.K. it can be quite difficult acquiring African-American films. I really do enjoy watching this type of film, but I can honestly say that watching this could have put me off for life.
All of the men in the film were in serious need of medical attention and all of the women were acting no better than women employed in the oldest profession (only they weren't getting paid for it). The men were suffering from so much fustration, anger and agression that you could not understand what they were saying half of the time.
You had to watch the film about 3 times just to understand it (and that's if you could stay awake for long enough).
It was lucky to even get one star in the rating and I think that I did you all a favour by watching it and reviewing it so you wouldn't have to.
To summarise,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. getting this one.",1023148800,13,864,4.274390243902439
1665082,1,B00005UF85,I'm all about supporting films not necessarily shown in mainstream cinema - but this is utterly ridiculous. This film was truly disappointing (and confusing - it didn't have a plot). While I urge you to support independent films - I strongly suggest that you bypass this one and DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.,1022198400,3,302,4.826923076923077

1665094,1,B00005UF85,"This was the MOST terrible film I have come across in years!!! The plot is highly disorganized and basically all over the place. Here you have four black men playing dominoes talking about their relationship woes. (seems normal right?) Well guess what? It begins to get dry; becoming, long winded, endless,rambling that goes well off into the night. There's practically NO character development and the plot never got closed up at the end. The only redeeming parts of this movie were the steamy romance scenes. Other than that, this movie belongs in the ""free giveaways"" bin at your local yard sale. I'm ashamed that Terrence Howard and Glenn Plummer would make something like this thinking this was okay all while using grand-dads old camcorder and equipment. No wonder BET hasn't aired this low budget movie yet; now I know why too.

Please save your money!!!!!",1362614400,4,863,4.951724137931034
1665095,5,B00005UF85,"I did not have any idea what to expect with this movie, but I have to admit I really really did enjoy it. I've watched it over more than 4 times so far and each time its just as enjoyable.  If women watch this and truly be honest, they would have to say it is truth and enjoyable.",1246838400,,280,3.8275862068965516
1665096,1,B00005UF85,The movie was ok. I didn't enjoyed the movie at all waiting to exhale is a whole lot better that this movie is.,1222905600,,111,3.869565217391304
1665097,5,B00005UF85,"It is somewhat hilarious to read some of the posts/comments made by mostly women about this movie.  Now you know how a lot of black men feel after watching movies like Waiting to Exhale.

Honestly, this movie shows how a lot of us black men kick it when we get together.  If you open your mind instead of taking the movie personal, you will see our pains and issues in our relationships and why we act the way we do.

The movie takes on four different relationships from four different brotha's and their perspectives.  One of the most realistic movies I've seen regarding black men. No sugar coating...Just the real!!",1207094400,6,618,4.581818181818182
1665098,1,B00005UF85,"If someone could explain the purpose of this movie, I would be most appreciative!!  Not only did I waste my hard earned cash on this film, but it was also a gross waste of my valuable time.

Don't get me wrong - Normally, I love Terrence Howard and his preformance, but I have to say...I am truly disappointed with this film (storyline and delivery).

Wouldn't recommend this to N-E-1.",1149811200,,385,4.550724637681159
1665099,1,B00005UF85,"Never wanted to send a movie back to Amazon but this one should go back and in the trash.. slow moving, boring, didn't keep my attention... throwing in a few african americans actors that we know is not going to make the movie... What is this suppose to be the men's version of Waiting to Exhale?  NOT! Terrence you and Glenn aren't ready to be producers yet...keep your day jobs of acting...",1140307200,,392,4.444444444444445
1665100,1,B00005UF85,"Love Beat the Hell Outta Me is a cheesy low budget production.

However, with that said... the best character was Chris played by Terrance Howard.  He drives the movie.  He's the tough bad boy with nothing nice to say, but he keeps the movie one fourth decent and interesting. The other characters are dull and uncomplicated.  They also lack acting ability.

The movie did shed some light and put into SOME perspective on how men think regarding women and relationships.  It seems as though, both men and women think each are just full of it and always have an ulterior motive for wanting to be with one another.  But this movie showed how neither men nor women want to communicate their true feelings or just be honest about what they want from jump street.  In all, unspoken words and misdirected actions help ensued massive amounts of confusion throughout dating and relationships as this movie showed.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to be watched for its production, but if one must watch it...watch it for its message regarding black men and their thought processes.",1138838400,5,1073,4.819672131147541
1665101,1,B00005UF85,"If i could rate this piece at 0 stars, i would.  An absolute catastrophe of money spent producing and supporting independent black film.  Those who rated this movie anywhere above 1 should re-examine why they attend and view movies.

There was no substance to any part of this movie whatsoever.  It was an overall poor portrayal of black relationships and the interactions between both male and female roles.  As if we didn't have enough trouble out here trying to keep each other on the straight and narrow path of positive thinking and hopeful intuition, we have this piece of trash that is not even of the calibre to be called a ""movie"", being supported and produced.  What kind of message are we sending that allows just anything to be representative of black american culture and its development, if this is the ""quality"" that we allow to be its image?

I am beyond upset...I'm livid!",1138752000,,889,4.733766233766234
1665102,5,B00005UF85,"The movie mostly deals with views of a mans thinking about women, whether true or untrue.  Women might not agree with the references made about them. The plot keeps you interested and involved as the story moves along.  Terrance Howard is sure to win multiple academy awards during his acting career.",1124755200,2,300,4.862745098039215
1665103,1,B00005UF85,"Where's a Zero rating when you need one?
This is just ... a mess. Overrun with mean-spiritedness, the vileness of the anti-female ramblings is matched only by the sub-amateur production values.
The writing is awful. The camerawork is headache-inducing. The acting would look bad on the stage of the worst gosapel stage show you ever saw.
Obviously, renting a camcorder and tripod from the local camera store does NOT qualify you as the next Spike Lee. If this is the best you can do, you're not even the next Matty Rich!
How bad is this movie? Take the ""skeletons in the closet"" rant from ""Eddie Murphy: Raw"" and multiply it by 1,000! Every woman these guys know is a ""farm tool,"" ""witch with a B in front"" or worse. There's not one redeeming female character. There's not even one redeeming MALE character!
These are familiar faces, but these actors can do better than this. Based on these performances, they should really reconsider their career goals.
If Winky Dinky Dog won't take them back, there's always work at the post office.",1085616000,5,1035,4.7555555555555555
