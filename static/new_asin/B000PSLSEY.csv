8193092,4,B000PSLSEY,"At under one hour , this film is indeed short , but , to compensate for this , there are two DVDs , with English and Swedish language versions and also many extras.  Although the film's plot centres on the plight of a naked man , it is not pornographic  -  just rather crude at times.  I would recommend it to any broad-minded person with a penchant for nudity.",1364947200,,361,4.188405797101449
