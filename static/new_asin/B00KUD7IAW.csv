6448825,4,B00KUD7IAW,"In all honesty, I have a hard time dealing with my feelings on this film.  The series which the film follows is one of the few series I have gotten into in recent years that has had a lasting effect on me.  It's also one of the rare series to ever make me cry.  So, you would think that a movie based on this series would be a no-brainer and i would love it, right? Yes and no.  The fact is this movie, which is only an hour and a half, is comprised of half new material and the other half comes from clips of the show.  That's the biggest issue I have with the film.

The new material is absolutely fantastic.  Set one year after the events of the series we see how each character has grown from the finale.  The films main plot involves the characters coming up with their own messages for Menma.  The anniversary of her farewell causes each of the main characters to look back on how they've grown and changed as well as their own unique relationship with Menma.  This, if you haven't guessed, is where a number of the clips from the show come in.  While not terrible, it's a little frustrating to think that so much of the movie is dedicated to already seen material.  Of other important notice, among the new material in the movie is footage on how Menma came to be a part of the group before her death.  For me, this may have been the true jewel of the film since Menma's farewell in the series hit me hard, and all over again during this film (stupid emotions...).

Given the quality of the series you can expect the same of the movie in terms of overall picture quality and sound.  The quality is great and while it doesn't exactly improve it is more of the same.  Although the new theme song is utterly fantastic.

So, if you're a fan of the series I would certainly recommend checking out the movie since it does add a bit more to the story.  I personally loved the lesson in recovery from loss which was different from the series that dealt with how damaged people become from a loved one's death.  Since the movie was just released the price of the film is more than I would care for (currently between 40 and 70 dollars).  Unfortunately the movie is an anime, so the likelihood of the price dropping much is unlikely so I would leave it up to your personal discretion on whether to buy it or not.",1406332800,7,2309,4.252293577981652
6448826,5,B00KUD7IAW,i really recommend this anime to all. that being said i see a lot of people trying to sell the premium edition for way to much money i just wanted say if your interested in the anime NIS America is re releasing it in a standard edition with the same features that this has that i recommend you get. it is only $50 dollars which is way cheaper.,1383004800,3,343,4.0588235294117645
6448827,5,B00KUD7IAW,"I ordered the premium edition not because I wanted the book, but rather the premium edition is about the only way to left to get this series unless you can speak Japanese fluently.  I took a risk by ordering it after being drawn into the characters and storyline following the first few episodes on crunchyroll.

The premium edition comes with the series on Blu-ray and DVD.  The series looks very sharp on Blu-ray...the facial expressions, the scenery...impressive.  The book and the thick cardboard box the discs and book come in are icing on the cake.  There are two discs in each plastic case.  The whole packaging is well put together and sturdy.  I suspect that this series will get watched many times over the upcoming years...the characters are developed well, the storyline does not have dead-end tangents, or pieces of the story that simply stop without explanation...the final episodes tie up any loose ends but at the same time leave one wanting more despite that the story has good closure.  Never seen an anime quite like this before...hope it is not the last time I will see another one this good.  THIS is, in my opinion, how good anime can be...should be.",1367107200,2,1172,4.762376237623762
6448828,5,B00KUD7IAW,"I was hesitent spending the money for this premium edition without having ever seen this show before.  It just sounded like a story I would be interseted in.  I was right, I enjoyed this very much and it was worth the money.  One of the best series I've seen lately.  It's very heartfelt and emotional.  There's probably more crying in Anohana than any other anime I've seen.  But that's the kinda show this is, dealing with topics of friendship, loss and regret.  No action, no robots, no fanservice, no magic (well maybe a little bit, depending on how you look at it).  The animation is great and I like the settting for this show; about half the show takes place outdoors at their secret base off in the forest.  There is also a fairly satisfying ending that brings a decent amount of resolution to a great (and did I mention emotional?) show.",1350345600,,846,4.5131578947368425
6448829,5,B00KUD7IAW,"When I first started watching this series, I predicted I would be at least mildly entertained, but somewhat disappointed at some aspects of the story.  What I found surprised me.  This is a compelling and beautifully emotional story.  I truly appreciated that the writers and director did not hyper-dramatize this story with outrageous situations.  Instead, they employed wonderfully delicate narrative, and exercised subtly only seen in the best of live-action dramatic cinema.  The characters have a strong sense of loss, and this is shown with care and precision.  Not once did I think the writer/director missed the mark on the characters - they seem so real, so human.  You may find it very easy to connect with them, as I did.

If you are looking for a well executed story with great character development and excellent animation, then you won't be disappointed.  This is a lovely story that will leave your heart overflowing with sweet yet delicately bitter emotions.  Have some tissue ready for the last few episodes and enjoy!",1347667200,,1035,5.035294117647059
6448830,5,B00KUD7IAW,"This anime is one of my favorites. It has amazing art, story, and is just so much brimming with emotions that you'll just get sucked into the story and get attached to all the characters(or just some depending who you like.) It gets pretty emotional towards the end, not to say all episodes aren't but the last few are just really sad and trust me you will tear up and/or cry at the end. I know I did. It doesn't matter whether you watch it alone or not, you and everyone around will cry. It's unavoidable. Just give in to the sadness and happiness of the ending.",1344902400,3,563,4.271028037383178
6448831,5,B00KUD7IAW,"I bought this anime after seeing the first couple of episodes online, where they had been posted by NIS. This proved to be a good move because I didn't want to wait 10 weeks to see the whole series and so I purchased the disks.

The Premium Edition consists of a heavy slipcase box covered with art of the characters, and a thin, full color hardback book containing a profile of the main characters, spoiler-free descriptions of each episode, production sketches and, humorously, translations for all the odd T-shirts the main character wears in the show. There are also two thin-pack jewel cases, with art, containing both a DVD and a Blu-Ray disk in each case. The disks are the products of NIS America, which means they are fairly expensive compared to other anime companies, but the production quality is excellent.

The artwork in the anime is excellent, with nice character designs (Menma is especially adorable) and beautiful backgrounds and music. And I was happy to see that most of the subtitle errors I saw on the online episodes had been corrected on the disks. The extras on the disks are minimal, consisting of clean openings and closing and previews of other NIS series.

The story itself is excellent too, though it's a bit of a tear-jerker in places. It isn't as maudlin as anime such as Clannad and Grave of the Fireflies, though. There is more than enough humor to balance out the tragic aspects of the story. If you are a fan of anime such as Clannad, I will suggest that you will appreciate ""Anohana"" as well.

The story revolves around five high school students who had known each other since they were young children. As kids, they called their gang of six ""the Super Peace Busters"" and did everything together. However, in the summer of their sixth or seventh year, a tragedy occurred which fractured their group, seemingly forever.  The story begins ten years after the tragic death of one of the kids, when Jintan, the hero of the story and the former leader of the Super Peace Busters, is visited by the spirit of Menma, the sixth member of their group. Once an adventuresome and outgoing leader, often envied by his friends, Jintan has been unable to deal with the death of Menma and has, over the years, become completely withdrawn from society, turning into a full-fledged Hikikomori. When Menma appears to him, he thinks he's just gone off the deep end. He decides to seek out his former friends, in spite of the pain it causes him to do so.

As the episodes unfold, we meet the five surviving members of the group and see how the tragedy impacted their lives. None of the four other members, Anaru, Poppo, Tsuruko and Yukiatsu, really believes that Menma has appeared to Jintan and they set out to humor him. Yet, as they finally begin to face the tragic events of ten years before, they each slowly begin to heal. I cannot discuss the ending without resorting to spoilers, so all I will say is that the series has a satisfyingly happy ending.

There is very little objectionable material in the series except for a bit of cross-dressing by one of the characters and the suggestion, never openly discussed, that the hero's father is gay. The concept of a Hikikomori (a virtual shut-in) may be foreign to most American viewers not familiar with Japanese culture, so the sheer guts shown by Jintan in facing his fears and leaving the house may be lost on most viewers.

Amazon is currently offering the Premium Edition as a substantial discount, but if the price is too steep for you, NIS usually offers a cheaper Standard Edition of its anime once the Premium Edition has sold out. Also, unlike some of the other anime series NIS has produced, Anohana is a complete series. The whole story is told in twelve episodes so you're not left waiting for a second season that may or may not be released in the U.S.

This is a well done anime, and will play your heart-strings like a violin in the hands of a master.",1343779200,15,3939,4.631805157593123

8661773,4,B00KUD7IAW,"The movie is basically an epilogue to the TV series' story: 1 year after the original story has ended, the 5 friends get together to write letters to Menma(Honma Meiko).

If you're already a fan of the series this can be a nice addition to your collection. On the other hand: If this movie is your first exposure to Anohana, you might have a hard time following the story. The story also relies heavily on flashbacks -- which allows the movie to recycle the scenes from the TV series. My recommendation: Since this movie doesn't add much to the story, you would not miss much if you skipped it (unless you're a diehard fan, that is.)

The video and audio quality is excellent.
The bonus material is light.",1454284800,5,705,4.5

8661777,4,B00KUD7IAW,"I really enjoyed all the new content and extra clarification on what happens after the Anime Season of Anohana, but I was extremely disappointed in the writers use in previous episode materials, I feel like the anime's contents were re-used FAR too much.

*Possible spoilers, scroll down at your own risk*

As to be expected of AnoHana since the anime was so cute and a tear fest, expect the same from the movie. Those that have watched the entire anime however may or may not be interested in buying the movie, I would say if you are somebody who was extremely drawn in to the anime and ONLY if you were extremely drawn in and wanted to see more story then pick this up! Even after the movie is over however you will still have some questions that may have been left unanswered, me personally I hope to see more from this series where we get every single answer and outcome without milking the franchise.",1426550400,,905,4.4787878787878785

8661779,4,B00KUD7IAW,"I chose to buy the film because the series was just so good. It does not let down, however since the original series is basically self contained some veterans may not feel this movie is necessary. In my opinion the way they continued the story without jumping the shark is very impressive and a testament to the skills of these writers. There's slight re-treading of already seen material, but it doesn't eat up too much runtime, and it will really help those who haven't yet been able to see see the show. If you are one of those people, get ready for a top notch production the likes of which are rarely seen in anime.",1410566400,2,620,4.4
8661780,5,B00KUD7IAW,"Now I know why it's so difficult to find this set - it's one of the best anime ever produced. The character portrayals are astounding, relationships complex. It's uplifting and insightful, funny and sad. This is a dose of reality tinged with an honesty and awareness that's rare to find in any medium. It's engaging and fun from beginning to end. This is not some toilet humor, fanservice anime that pushes watchers' buttons with pop culture references, nor is it a story that props itself up solely by pulling on our heartstrings. This is storytelling at its finest, a work of art..",1410566400,,583,4.7254901960784315
