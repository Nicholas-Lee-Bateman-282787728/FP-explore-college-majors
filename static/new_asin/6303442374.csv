7848849,3,6303442374,"Well--after 3 decades and countless laughs--the Three Stooges officially wrapped up their film career with ""The Outlaws Is Coming""--and I would say they went out with more of a whimper than a bang.

The idea of a regular 16 to 17 minute stooge western can be arduous--depending on which 3rd stooge you were dealing with. Admittedly--as big as a Shemp fan as I am--generally the Curly Howard westerns were better. But again, those westerns were only 17 minutes.

Now, stretch out those 17 minutes into a 90 minute feature padded with very little stooge slapstick, some very dated humor (some of it even being inside jokes that totally went over my head), a love story and some yawn inducing sidebar about Curly-Joe trying to save the buffalo and you have what seems like a very long time before you get to the closing credits.

It's too bad ""Around the World in A Daze"" couldn't have been the last ""Official"" stooge film. While I'm not wildly enthusiastic about the Curly-Joe era, ""Daze"" was a pretty good film and would have been a much better swan song for the boys--but, as the song goes ""You can't always get what you want.""

7848850,5,6303442374,"THE OUTLAWS IS COMING (1965) is yet another great Three Stooges feature film. It's also their last feature. This one has some great comedy in it. I noticed some similarity for THE THREE STOOGES MEET HERCULES (1962), such as the wagon chase at the end. I didn't know they had pies in the old west. Great movie.

But the real icing on the cake is ""The Stooges""foiling the villians in I a duel that spoofs ""High Noon""and a combination chase and pie fight that tops what the boys,Quinn Redecker , Vicki Trickett&George Neise  endured in""The Three Stooges Meet Hercules!"".And A tough idea of Criminal reform that Moe,Larry and Curly Joe put the nine seven of the nine outlaws thru in ""Rance Rodin's Saloon"".There is also memorable performances from:Nancy Kovacks(Who played Annie Oakley.

7848852,4,6303442374,"I just got done watching this movie about an hour ago. I must say that it's worth you're time and money if you're a stooge fan. Moe ' Larry, and Curly-Joe do a really good job for their final completed movie. Larry Fine would have a stroke on the set of 'Kooks Tour'. Emil Sitka was going to replace Larry but their movie contract fell through the roof and Sitka never got to work as one of the Stooges. Thanks for all the great work you've done for over 30 years guys.",999216000,,469,4.108695652173913
7848853,4,6303442374,"The Outlaws Is Coming, released in 1965. The Stooges head west, along with Adam (Batman) West and take on the most villainous outlaws in history, played by popular local TV kiddie show characters. Annie Oakley (played by cutie Nancy Kovak) falls in love with hapless West, and helps them try to stop the crooks who want to slaughter the buffalo. Look for Henry (Laugh-In) Gibson as a college educated hipster Indian, and Emil Sitka in a dual role, his last. (Incidently, Sitka is actually the last surviving member of the Stooges, not Curly-Joe, since he was hired by Moe to replace Larry for an unmade film ""The Jet Set"" in 1975). In the end, The Three Stooges ride off into the sunset much as they first entered Hollywood, with the rain pouring and Moe whacking his partners over the head! Moe's son-in-law Norman Maurer (producer, director, story writer) finally got it right with complete ending titles and nice script doing justice to the Stooges in their final completed feature film, and their best. The boys went on to do cartoons, then commercials, a US Savings Bond film, and finally their last, Kook's Tour (see my review for that film under ""Jongi""). The Outlaws Is coming is highly recommended to all!",985910400,2,1214,4.785714285714286
7848854,5,6303442374,"""The Outlaws Is Coming!"" is the first film that turned me on to the Stooges. It is also my favorite. I feel sorry for that ""New Yorker"" who is dying to see it. It had been six years since I first  saw it. Then, six years later I too was dying. So I finally went to a video  store and ordered it. I LOVE it!",943833600,,306,3.6923076923076925
