8332825,5,B001P9O0KG,"I take so many work shops only to come home, look at my notes and wonder what it all means. Most of it is forgotten. Those workshops cost a small fortune!
In this video, you get to take it all home, work on it at your own pace, no notes required. In the end, you learn a dance to some great music!
Clearly explained and demonstrated.
Easy stuff made to look great on any dancer.",1264464000,2,378,4.053333333333334
8332826,4,B001P9O0KG,"This dvd is quite enjoyable all the way around. Aela is unassuming, funny and offers a really cute and fun choreography to learn. Not to mention the awesome music track by Corvus Corax which I fell in love with, I went and bought their best of cd and love that to. The castle and studio where its taped doesnt hurt either! Her husbands a smart man for pushing her to do it. Its worth the money. Donna",1254268800,,400,4.207792207792208
8332827,3,B001P9O0KG,"A great DVD for learning tribal, but not the best one I have seen to date.",1245801600,,74,3.6875
8332828,5,B001P9O0KG,I've been dancing for over 3 years and this is one of the best videos I've purchased.  Aela explains and demostrates the moves very well.  I would highly recommend this video to anyone who has a little bit of experience at belly dancing.  Most of the moves she does she assumes you know how to do.,1244678400,,297,4.267857142857143
8332829,5,B001P9O0KG,"I had never heard of Aela Badiana until I found her on Youtube.  I purchased her DVD shortly afterward and have not been disappointed.  A few things to keep in mind while viewing this DVD are:  she recommends that you do a full warmup for 20 minutes prior to watching this (her own warmup is quite a bit shorter than that), and it's a good idea to have an in-the-flesh teacher to check your form and posture while learning the choreography (if at all possible).  The choreography itself is broken down into 5 combinations, all of which are ""doable"" for a beginner with some previous experience.  I hope Aela does more DVDs in the future!",1239148800,6,637,4.504347826086956
8332830,5,B001P9O0KG,I just received my DVD and it's fantastic!! Aela's instructions are easy to follow and the choreography is great. She teaches in front of a mirror so you feel like you're right in the dance studio with her.  It's an energetic dance and loads of fun to do. I highly recommend......,1236211200,2,280,4.490196078431373
8332831,5,B001P9O0KG,"As a bellydancer with 30 years dancing experience,I found this DVD to be clear, concise, and free of distractions. The movements taught are a livelier form of Tribal dancing, which I find to be interesting and enjoyable to watch. Aela is a very technical dancer,well paced as a teacher, and her music and background can't be beat! Every bellydancer should have this in her media library. I can't wait for the next one!",1236038400,10,418,4.739726027397261
8332832,5,B001P9O0KG,"I've heard great things about this DVD...Aela Badiana is one of the best belly dancers out there, I can't wait to have her 'teach' me in my home!",1231977600,,145,4.214285714285714
8332833,5,B001P9O0KG,"This is a great DVD and is a perfect gift for the bellydance or tribal dancer in your life. It is full of great information about how to properly do moves, warmup cool down and is a cool choreography. My favorite is the performance filmed in the castle, too cool!",1231718400,,263,4.28
