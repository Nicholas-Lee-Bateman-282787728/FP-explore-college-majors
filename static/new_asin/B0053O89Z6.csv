4538104,4,B0053O89Z6,"The year is 2030, and you are listening to you father tell you the story of how he met your mother. Over a span of seven seasons with an average of 22 episodes a season, your father retells stories of sitting around the bar with his best friends, describes his various relationships with what seems like hundreds of girls who rarely stick around for long. As soon as you think he's finally at the end of his story, it turns out it's just ""some girl"" and not the conclusion of the TV series. But viewers are content with that. The longer it takes Josh Radnor to find his character's wife in How I Met Your Mother, the more television fans get to watch.
What began as a show loosely based off of the producers' experiences in New York City (Carter Bays and Craig Thomas originally wanted to write a sitcom about ""our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York"") quickly became a successful show receiving high ratings and winning five Emmy awards and a nomination for ""Outstanding Comedy Series"" in 2009. Along with quite a few other awards and nominations, CBS' How I Met Your Mother was rated the top fifth TV series of the last decade (2002-2012).
The show stars Radnor, as Ted Mosby, and his four best friends Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Marshall's wife, Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), and Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris). Other friends come and go through the seasons but none stay as long as those listed above. Even those characters disappear from time to time, but (SPOILER ALERT!) they always find a way to make it back to MacLaren's, the bar where much of the show is set. As the relationships between the main cast members develop, fans can see the strength of the actors who play them.
The diversity of the characters portrayed in the show allows people with varying views on relationships have an interest. Ted, on one hand, has been looking for his soul mate ever since he realized his two best friends found theirs (with each other), Marshall and Lily found true love while dating for ten years, and Robin, while not against dating, is fully convinced she will never get married or have children. Barney is the man-whore of the group. By making up far-fetched stories about his life, he manages to sleep with a new woman each night. Together, the group collaborates to create a nice blend of different views.
Each character has a strong hold on the group dynamic; without him or her, the group could easily fall apart. This is mostly thanks to the strength of the actors themselves (and of course to the writers, producers, directors etc.). Each actor is able to portray their character in the most humourous way. While still carrying some essence of serenity and seriousness, Radnor, Segel, Hannigan, Smulders, and Harris work together to make an award winning show, loved throughout the country.
While all of the main cast is best known for this hilarious show, Radnor is also well-known for his work as producer, director, and writer of various other productions. His movie HappyThankYouMorePlease (which he wrote, directed, and starred in) won ""Audience Award"" before being nominated for ""Grand Jury Prize"" at the 26th Sundance Film Festival in 2010. Within the first five minutes of HappyThankYouMorePlease, Radnor, who sports a scruffy beard, untucked button-up shirt and acts as Sam Wexler, shows similar characteristics to his character on How I Met Your Mother: Stopping mid-stride to gawk at a pretty girl, most likely thinking she's ""the one."" Unfortunately, she probably isn't. Even just having a simple ""Hello, I'm Sam"" conversation is awkward, as are many of the encounters between Ted Mosby and other women on the show. Whether a secret or not, both Wexler and Mosby are looking for true love and the beauty that tags along for the ride.
The movie made a mere $0.2 million in the box office and the reviews seem to reflect the total revenue. The plot is choppy and unorganized, jumping between what seem like three somehow related characters, much like Valentine's Day and Love Actually. However, instead of bringing everyone together in the end to connect all the strings, the stories were left severed and the audience confused. Radnor's writing was poor and his ideas weren't portrayed well through the characters, unlike How I Met Your Mother where his acting, while often juvenile and sarcastic, is effective in creating a character worth listening to.
After about half of HappyThankYouMorePlease, I found myself wondering how I was going to get through the remainder of the movie. In comparison to my beloved TV show, this movie was below my standards. I found myself hoping that I wouldn't find that Radnor is type-casted, something that seems to happen all too often in cultural media. I wanted Radnor to show his versatility through HappyThankYouMorePlease and How I Met Your Mother. No such luck. I was stuck with the horny man searching the streets of New York for love. Radnor may complete the five-way friendship in How I Met Your Mother with his hunky cuteness, but his performance in HappyThankYouMorePlease is inadequate and doesn't show the strength I had hoped to find. Even in the soon-to-be-released Liberal Arts (also written and directed by and starring Radnor) is clearly of the same origin. Lonely, scruffy, 30-something year old  man lives life by finding love. In this case, it's in a 19 year old college student.
How I Met Your Mother is an entirely entertaining show about drunken escapades around New York City, and if you're looking for that, great. If you're looking for Radnor's breakthrough, hoping to find him taking on a new and refreshing role, you won't find it. However, if you're satisfied with the ""mega good-looking,"" sweet, sentimental dude that every girl hopes to marry, you're set for a night in with some chocolate ice cream and a cozy fire.",1329350400,4,5865,4.870870870870871
4538105,5,B0053O89Z6,"One of the best HIMYM episodes of all time.  Definitely Robin's best episode (""Nobody asked you Patrice!!!"").

As being an avid fan of this series (I own all of the seasons), I was very excited to see how it all ended  and how Ted met their mother. However, the season seemed very slow and drawn out in the beginning (the wedding that eventually ends in a divorce goes on for half of the season) and then everything wraps up in two episodes; there's a meet cute, a snapshot of a happy life, a sad death, and a final reunion (oh & don't forget a random baby momma). I wasn't upset just because their was a major death, I was upset with the abruptness of a beauty story. They pushed it a season too long.",1455753600,,634,4.112903225806452

4539934,4,B0053O89Z6,"How can you not love all of these characters??? And, like probably every female on the planet, I'm in love with ""Ted"" or perhaps it's Josh Radnor!

One thing that makes me wonder about the writers (tho' props for being nearly the only sitcom that is generally funny), these people went to a ""Little Ivy"" school...would they really use such poor grammar...I mean Jason Segel's character is an attorney.

Also, toward the end (and I haven't seen season 9) they kinda made a mess of the Marshall and Lily characters...but you still have to love them too. And I'd never watched the seasons until they hit Amazon so I didn't know Cobie Smulders--she's a hoot.

And lastly, it sure makes women out to be empty headed and Barney really awful with all of the slurs and biases against the feminine half of the species. That's why I didn't give it a five...maybe I'm just conservative, and educated...

And...I never knew how amazingly talented Neil Patrick Harris was. The rest of the cast is stellar too...gotta love Jason Segel. I've watched seasons 1-8 twice already! Highly recommend it with the notes mentioned above.",1403568000,,1113,4.78125

4540303,4,B0053O89Z6,"RECAP: The series follows Ted, an architect telling his children the story if how he met their mother. Each season shows Ted and his friends experiencing all of the moments and antics that will eventually/hopefully lead to Ted meeting and falling in love with his future wife. In general, it's probably necessary to have watched the previous seasons before jumping in at Season 6, since there are references to the past and previous character development plays a role. This is a well-written and family appropriate show that keeps fans begging for more.

Season 7 kicked off in the fall of 2011 with main characters:  Josh Radnor as Ted Mosby, Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson, Cobie Smulders as Robin Scherbatsky, Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin, and Jason Segel as Marshall Eriksen. As the series progresses it is also picking up more and more celebrity cameos [ehem, did you know that the voice of ""future Ted"" in the precaps is actually Bob Saget?]; Season 7 features guest appearances from Marshall Manesh as Ranjit, Chris Romano as Punchy, Nazanin Boniadi as Nora, Wayne Brady as James Stinson, Frances Conroy as Loretta Stinson, Alexis Denisof as Sandy Rivers, Kal Penn as Kevin, Becki Newton as Quinn Garvey, Chris Elliott as Mickey Aldrin, Vicki Lewis as Dr. Sonya, Martin Short as Garrison Cootes, Bill Fagerbakke as Marvin Eriksen, Cristine Rose as Virginia Mosby, Ray Wise as Robin Scherbatsky, Sr., Suzie Plakson as Judy Eriksen, Ellen D. Williams as Patrice, Ashley Williams as Victoria, Brendan Robinson as Ned, Conan OBrien as extra, Katie Holmes as Naomi, Weird Al Yankovic as himself, and Ernie Hudson as himself.

SEASON 7:  Season 6 came to a close with the news that Marshall and Lily are expecting a baby.  Ted has broken things off with Zoey, but the return of Victoria this season could mark a change in the way Ted pursues finding the mother of his future children.  Robin and Barney seemed to mature (a little) in the previous season, possibly making Season 7 the prime time for them to find lasting love.

Episode 1:  The Best ManMarshall and Lily try to conceal the news of their pregnancy as the gang attends Punchys wedding in Cleveland.  Just when Robin admits her lingering feelings for Barney, he makes another attempt with Nora; we get a glimpse of Barneys future wedding as well as the idea that he may have had to pick between two eligible brides.

Episode 2:  The Naked TruthBarney stays up all night trying to prove to Nora that hes worth another shot; Ted is torn between two women; Beercules emerges online, threatening Marshalls potential to be hired with an environmental law firm.

Episode 3:  The Ducky TieBarney moves into the reaping phase of a long-term con against Marshall and Lily; after reuniting with Victoria, Ted begins to reevaluate why he hasn't been able to make headway in relationships.

Episode 4:  The Stinson Missile CrisisBarney decides to focus on his A-story with Nora, but has to abort all side-missions.  Robin reveals how she ended up in mandatory therapy for an assault charge.

Episode 5:  Field TripA field trip for Teds architecture class takes a detour.  Marshall begins to think he put his new boss on a pedestal, but refuses complacency; Robin enters a relationship with Kevin.

First, the Slutty Pumpkin storyline is finally reconciled when Ted meets her, albeit nearly a decade later (played by Katie Holmes).  The last five minutes of the episode are awesome, and almost made me a Katie Holmes fan (when she explains their short relationship from her point of view).

Also, Marshall and Lily finally have their baby, a long-awaited moment--and Lily's father finally comes back into the picture.  This is further expanded on in season 8, where he finally redeems himself (as much as possible) after not being there during her childhood.

There are a lot of moments in this season that made me cry! The episode ""Tailgate"" and towards the end of the season, the awkward exchange between Ted and Robin as he finally lets her go (""No Pressure"").

I also wih they wouldn't stray from the traditional personalities they established in all the previous seasons- seems like they keep forgetting what they have established to be the standard Robin, Ted, Barney way of doing things.

While at times I felt like this season was disjointed, and some of the characters didn't grow, or even regressed, they have prepared for the end... IN my opinion next season could be the final hurrah. I love this show to the bottom of my heart, but I don't want this show to turn into the last seasons of ER... They need to end on a high note, and soon. I don't want to lose one of my favorite shows to the demons of poor writing, and lack of ideas.

4541194,3,B0053O89Z6,"The seventh season of How I Met Your Mother finds some major changes going on with the five friends.  Marshall (Jason Segal) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan) are expecting a baby, Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) enters in a ""committed"" relationship, Robin (Colbie Smulders) goes to court mandated therapy and then starts to date her therapist (Kal Penn) and only Ted (Josh Radnor) remains essentially the same, still on the hunt for the elusive wife.  Season seven is called the duckie tie edition because of a bet between Barney & Lily in which they bet that if Barney can recreate the meal at a Benihana style restaurant Lily will let him see and feel her pregnancy boobs and if not he has to wear a duckie tie of Marshall's for one year.  You can guess who wins the bet.  The season also features the return of the Slutty Pumpkin with Katie Holmes as Naomi the Halloween girl of Ted's dreams (who doesn't quite live up to the ten year wait in either people's minds) & Ashley Williams as Victoria.  The season is still funny, but not up to par with past seasons.",1349740800,,1055,4.531578947368421
4541195,4,B0053O89Z6,"I think all shows go through a stage where the original ideas are spent, and so many different story arcs have been tried and it either you wrap it up or try out new ideas that may or may not work.  I don't know why but as soon as Marshall's dad died the show dropped down a few levels in the funny department for me.  I still enjoyed the episodes but I felt some of its magic seemed absent from the party.  So this season I was hopping they could refill the glass as they worked towards the end of the show.  And they somewhat did, with Lily being pregnant it allowed for a new set of challenges for the cast to play off of.  Some of these moments were memorable, some didn't feel like the characters at all.  Depending on the episode I enjoyed the Barney and Quinn story.  I think what hurt the season the most was how many major story arcs were going on at once.  In the past even when Ted and Robin break up the focus is on Lily's wedding.  Kinda like a relay race of sorts in the past, were anything dominating in the story happened one at a time.  This season there is so much character evolution all around the story arcs went back in forth in ways that seemed unfocused and rushed.  I don't think the show was poorly written, but the diversity of characters which has been such a strength in the past has become an impossible task for the writers.  Since viewers love all the characters so much it must be hard as a writer managing all of them at this point of the series.  The first season you mainly had Ted, and every one around him with minor story lines.  The amount of original cometic situations in that formula was amazing.  If they wanted to they really could take a break from the story line and just have really funny and original story lines.  But now all jokes need to fit in between this mad dash to finish everyone off.  I personal couldn't write better episodes myself.  I, like the writers would want to give the viewers closure with every character before ending the show.  Thats what they are doing, and I'm fine with that.  I watched every episode gladly, and will of the next season.  Although not my favorite it was in no ways a disappointment.  If your a fan of the show you must watch this season or you will miss out of many great developments of the show.  Chris Elliott and Martin Short bring there own style to the performances.",1349740800,,2364,4.274774774774775

4541267,5,B0053O89Z6,"I began watching How I Met Your Mother on Netflix late last year and quickly became hooked on it.  The cast is exceptional, and the scripts are generally right on the mark with few exceptions.  Unfortunately, Netflix didn't have Season 7 and I didn't want to start watching in the middle.  I had hoped to get Season 7 on DVD before Season 8 started but it won't be released until October.  I'm not sure what the reasoning behind that is so I bought it digitally and the HD quality from Amazon is very good over my Roku.

I was expecting a lot of misses in Season 8 from some of the other reviews, but as it turned out there was really only two episodes that didn't work for me and were disappointments.  I thought The Slutty Pumpkin episode had so much more potential especially after a big buildup to it in previous seasons.  Also I don't find Chris Elliott as Lily's Dad particularly funny and although I loved the flaming beekeeper episode, 46 minutes was also a miss where much of the episode was devoted to Lily and Marshall trying to get rid of Elliott.  For me, he's always been annoying and the only thing I've ever tolerated him in was Groundhog Day.  I was glad to see him depart after a couple of episodes.

4541448,3,B0053O89Z6,"How I Met Your Mother is my favorite show on television right now, period. So it pains me to be a harsh critic, but this season is deserving of three stars. Whether I look at it as its own entity or in comparison to previous seasons, Season 7 just did not live up to standards. There were some high moments, and there were some episodes that momentarily renewed my faith that the writers were onto something, but ultimately I found myself disappointed in the end result.

The irony is that in most cases the writers will start running out of ideas in latter seasons. In this case, I think the writers have too many fresh ideas and filmed an abundance of stories in Season 7 that either weren't necessary or felt completely rushed. My biggest problem with How I Met Your Mother's seventh season is that the show tried to fit about three seasons of stories into a 24 episode arc.

**Will Contain Spoilers**

The first thing I look at in a season of expedited stories is the relationship aspect of the show. Robin, for example, started dating Kevin in the fifth episode of the season, 'Field Trip.' By the sixteenth episode, 'The Drunk Train', Kevin proposed to Robin. If I am to follow a timeline that runs parallel to the air dates of the episodes, Robin and Kevin dated for just over four months.  Is it impossible? No, not really. Improbable, not impossible.
Barney's story with Quinn, though, just might be too far beyond believable. Noteworthy is the fact that we're talking about the quintessential womanizer for a good portion of the show. I liked the direction Barney's character was headed in. I thought his reconciliation with his father in Season 6 was a good turning point for him and a plausible explanation for his sudden change of lifestyle. However, this Quinn story is simply an overload of absolute silliness and absurdity. Barney met Quinn in 'The Drunk Train', episode 16. She didn't agree to go out with him until the eighteenth episode, 'Karma.' By the season finale, they'd been dating an astoundingly brief 2  months, yet Barney proposes to her and she accepts without so much as a hesitation.  I can't fathom in what walk of life this is realistic, especially given the fact that Barney is just a few months removed from leaving Nora because of his feelings for Robin. Over a season or two, this works. Over half a season this may even be justifiable, but the pace at which this story develops is plainly inconceivable.

The second thing I look at in this season of accelerated story lines is the fact that over the course of an 8 month period, Lily and Marshall called three different places home. Moving is certainly an arduous task for any couple to take on, but we're dealing with two moves in a matter of months by a couple expecting their first child. 'The Slutty Pumpkin Returns' first introduced the house in the suburbs, but it wasn't until Thanksgiving, 'The Rebound Girl' episode, that Marshall and Lily agree to move into her grandparents' old home. While my feelings on the move were lukewarm to begin with, the brevity of their stint on Long Island combined with the lack of funny stories associated with the house pushed me over the edge. I thought it was a fantastic idea for Ted to give Lily and Marshall their old apartment back, but the mess leading up to that moment cast a dark cloud over what should have been a joyous full-circle moment.
*And on the subject, why is Ted subletting someone's apartment when he just as easily could've moved into the house he purchased two years earlier? My only explanation is his desire to stay in the city, but it shocks me what little mention of his house has been made since 'Home Wreckers' aired in Season 5.

All that being said, a formidable season finale could have negated a lot of the wrong turns the show made in Season 7. While I was generally content with most of what went on, I needed time to digest the last 15 minutes or so of the season. The Barney/Quinn/Robin side of the story was utterly predictable and I was ultimately both pleased and slightly relieved with the wedding couple. It should be interesting to see how the writers get from where they are now to where they need to be.
The Ted and Victoria side of the story, however, I'm still feeling some animosity towards. Let me state for the record that Victoria is my favorite recurring character on the show. I thought she was dynamite in Season 1, and her appearance in 'Ducky Tie' not only helped tie up some loose ends but it served as a reminder that some old flames just never burn out. If you had told me at the beginning of the season that Ted and Victoria would wind up back together, I would have been ecstatic. But the way it was done felt over-the-top, rushed, and above all, unrealistic. It didn't have to be Victoria's wedding day, first of all. That served no purpose but to make Ted look like a villain for doing to another what nearly killed him. Second of all, Victoria's dialogue in the bar was very strange and outlandish considering the circumstances. She'd spent one evening with Ted in six years. She had zero contact with him otherwise, and it just felt way too easy for this woman to bail on everything her life had in store to ""ride off into the sunset"" with another man. There needed to be rising action here. The story needed a few episodes to develop, and if Victoria felt this strongly about Ted, she should've been the one to initiate contact with him. It all felt very wrong, and again (to beat a dead horse), implausible. I thought the one saving grace from their resurrected romance was Ted's flashbacks right before he decided to drive past the church. Obviously this is a girl he'd watched walk out on him twice through no fault of his own, and I can understand why Ted could not bear the thought of watching her go again. After all, as Robin put it, this was the one that got away. But as badly as I want to buy into this story, it's just too much of a reach. I hope they clean it up in Season 8.

With all that being said, I thought the show did some good things in Season 7:
- 'Ducky Tie' (7.03) was a great episode, in my opinion. Victoria helped drive the story, but I was more drawn in by the group's interaction at the Japanese restaurant. Very clever, vintage HIMYM
- 'The Slutty Pumpkin Returns' (7.08) was supposed to be an episode seven seasons in the making. I thought Katie Holmes played the character very awkwardly and her story with Ted was weak [not to mention there wasn't much slutty about the pumpkin]. However, everything else about the episode was hilarious, from Barney's revelation to Lily's pregnancy brain, this episode had me laughing the whole way through
- 'Disaster Averted' (7.09) was one of the best episodes of the series, if you ask me. Great usage of Hurricane Irene to build Lily and Marshall's pregnancy story, Marshall's health insurance story was gold and any episode utilizing the slap bet is a winner in my book
- 'Symphony Of Illumination' (7.12) was a dramatic, heartfelt Christmas episode and really displayed a lot of depth for a sitcom. I was very impressed with Cobie Smulders' performance.
- The usage of Lily's doppelganger and the two alternate title sequences were very funny in '46 Minutes' (7.14)
- 'No Pressure' (7.17) was an all around great episode. The last couple minutes of the episode used the song ""Shake It Out"" by Florence + The Machine, and it worked perfectly with the mood the show was trying to convey.
- 'Trilogy Time' (7.20) jumped around in the lives of Ted, Marshall and Barney. I loved the pop cultural references from the various times. Ultimately, this was an episode that could have fit right in to the show at its highest point.
- 'Now We're Even' (7.21) in a way was similar to the show if you look at it collectively. You knew how it was going to end, but you weren't sure how it would get there. That's why I enjoyed it.

Setting aside my problems with the big picture, there were times in Season 7 when the show had a very fundamental problem: it just wasn't all that funny.
- 'Tick Tick Tick...' (7.10) was painfully unfunny, even if Neil Patrick Harris' remarkable acting somewhat saved the episode.
- Though I moderately enjoyed the short-lived ""Puzzles"", Marshall's visit to his father's grave in 'Tailgate' (7.13) was just plain bizarre and anti-climactic.
- While the room-by-room storytelling of 'The Burning Beekeeper' (7.15) was original, the stories themselves were underwhelming. I like Mickey Aldrin's biggest character quirk, which is to invent the next great American board game. I don't like much else about him, and with much of this episode's success riding on his beekeeping story, it crashed and burned.
- 'Field Trip' (7.05), 'The Rebound Girl' (7.11) and 'Karma' (7.18) just felt like lazy episodes, not in terms of the writing or the acting, but just in the overall execution. To me they were the kind of episodes that you wouldn't turn off if they were on TV, but after awhile they'd just be background noise while you did something else. They just didn't draw me in, & as a huge fan of the show I hate admitting to that.

** ** **

I think the show has become victimized by its own success. The premise, the way we knew the ending before the story even began, backed the writers into a corner. Once the show started drawing praise and the network kept renewing it, the writers had to find ways to stall. It worked beautifully for awhile, but now the lack of preparation is beginning to show. It's really no one's fault, either, but this is the kind of story that probably needed to wrap up in five or six seasons before it became absurd. I'm hoping Season 7 as a whole is just an isolated miss. I will continue watching the show, but How I Met Your Mother's best days are almost certainly a thing of the past now.

4541568,2,B0053O89Z6,"I'm a huge fan of HIMYM. The first four seasons are excellent. Season 5 disappointed me with its poor handling of the Robin/Barney relationship, and then a bunch of fillerish episodes. Season 6 redeemed itself right away, setting up a new mystery with the wedding where Ted will meet the mother. The season contained small hints at whose wedding it might be, but there were also a lot of strong arcs involving Marshall and his father, and Barney and his father. There was also Ted, who spent the majority of that season in a relationship with the antagonistic Zoey. The finale revealed to us that one of the people getting married at that wedding ""a little ways down the road"" was none other than Barney!

Season 7 starts off strong with ""The Best Man,"" but quickly falters from there. Much of the first third of the season are lackluster episodes, as we follow Barney pursuing a relationship with Nora, Robin pining after Barney and then presumably giving up in favor of her therapist-turned-boyfriend, Kevin. Ted ties up some loose ends with Victoria, and Marshall and Lily try to figure out where they want to raise their child. The action picks up a bit in 7.9, ""Disaster Averted,"" which is another standout episode in the season, which takes the tension between Barney and Robin up a notch by having them hook up again. That plotline continues in 7.10, where despite having a discussion which may lead to their getting back together, Robin mercilessly rejects Barney in favor of Kevin. 7.11 is nothing special with a very misleading cliffhanger, and 7.12 is a tearjerker of an episode with a very cruel twist.

And from there the season completely sputters. Despite all the build-up between Barney and Robin, long stretches of episodes go by without them addressing anything that's happened. Instead we get a lot of lackluster filler episodes, like ""Tailgate,"" ""The Burning Beekeeper,"" and ""46 Minutes."" Barney gets a new love interest just as Robin and Kevin split, and Ted takes the breakup as an opportunity to once AGAIN tell Robin he loves and and wants to be with her. Mercifully she doesn't reciprocate his feelings, and ends up moving out of the apartment, but that doesn't stop Ted from moping about her for practically the rest of the season. (Hadn't these two already made peace with their past relationship? Like...many times before??) The season ends with the bride reveal, which while not surprising in the least is a step in the right direction, and Ted taking off with Victoria, who has skipped out on her wedding.

There were so many issues with this season. Lack of a real plot for Ted, who spends the majority of the season either playing odd third wheel to Lily and Marshall's pregnancy, or pining after Robin again. He does have a few moments, such as with Victoria and the Slutty Pumpkin, where we remember what the show is actually about, but those are few and far between. Marshall and Lily spend so much time deciding to move out to Long Island ... and then move back a couple episodes later. Talk about going in circles. And Robin's character takes a nosedive into the absurd when she's stripped of just about every quality we ever liked about her. She breaks Barney's heart, accepts a marriage proposal from a man she's only dated a few months, is mopey and whiny and insecure. Not to mention, I'm not sure what was up with the wardrobe this season, but she looked awful. (Which is ridiuclous, since the actress is quite pretty!) Barney breaks a record by having two serious outside love interests in one season.

Overall, this season was extremely disappointing. Here's hoping S8 can pick up the pieces and get back to telling the stories we love about the characters we love. I'll probably be buying this for completions sake, but aside from a couple of standouts, this one is definitely a season to catch on Netflix or in reruns.",1337731200,18,3864,4.745535714285714

4541570,4,B0053O89Z6,"This season wasn't the best of the whole seven years but it was still good. I felt in a way it was a filler. They were trying to fill gaps and end relationships in order for the next season to stand out and move the characters forward.

Lily and Marshall moved from the city to the suburbs then back to the city. I felt for them it was a journey to figuring out where they were going to be parents. Not just who they were going to be as parents but where they were going to be. In the end they went back to where they felt most at home and I think for them that's going to be a great move.

Ted and Robin finally ended their five year relationship. Dont believe me take a look at the amount of times they've either made out or had sex just because they could. They've basically been in a relationship since they go together. It was time for them to let go and it took the words of Victoria to help push Ted to that point and the actions of Robin to finally get him there.

For Robin this year was about finding what she really wants. She found out that she couldn't have children and it finally answered the question of why Robin doesnt have kids in the future. It was sad but I loved that the show went to a place not many other shows go to when it comes to fertility. I really enjoyed that storyline.

For Barney it was realizing that he wants the same things that Ted has wanted for years. He even wants kids which doesnt seem that farfetched for someone like Barney who is finally back in touch with his biological father. Then of course he ends up engaged to the stripper. I'm not sure I like her and it's comforting knowing that they don't end up together because they just seem like they would have too many issues if they got married.

This season wasn't stellar but it closed some doors and gave some answers to a few questions that I've had for years. Though there was one big thing I didn't like. I didn't like that Ted took off with Victoria. He just did to someone else what was done to him. I don't like that at all.

4541572,1,B0053O89Z6,"HIMYM'S season finale was the disatrous end to a disastrous season. Unfunny, implausible, and utterly lacking in the heart that often redeems HIMYM's lesser outings.

Instead we discover that Ted, far from being a romantic with an occasional roguish streak, now looks to be little better than a sleazeball with no conscience about doing unto others what was done unto him.  At a stroke, he is no longer a sympathetic character, but is just a junior league version of Barney.

The two finale episodes were rife with implausible and impossible situations that effectively neutered the humor.  We laugh when we can relate, but Barney's adventures with airport security were so impossible as to drain any empathetic humor - and of course, finding out at the end that it was all for nothing because Barney's intended is destined to get dumped helped matters not at all.  Another pseudo-climactic conclusion that promises much and delivers nothing.

This was compounded by the return of Victoria - in a wedding dress at a bar. Naturally. Oh sigh, here we go again - another recycled romance - and of course, again, not THE ONE.  This pedal on the organ has been pumped way too many times to be even remotely interesting let alone funny.  This is no longer plot twist or even plot tease - it is just tiresome.

As to the birth of Marvin Ericsson - and don't get me started about the absurd middle name - it lacked all emotion.  Marshall's miraculous turn from stone drunk to cold sober just in time for his ""just in time"" appearance in the birthing room, sans sanitized hospital garb, was nonsensical, unrealistic and so lightning fast as to be utterly without warmth or depth.

This was a problem made worse by the fact that, yet again, we are treated to the presence of the whole group gawking at the baby instead of what would have been a far more touching family moment between the parents of the new baby.  I don't know what it is, but whenever the writers of HIMYM attempt a touching moment between Marshall and Lilly, it falls flat - see their wedding as Exhibit A - and about the only thing that can be said about the baby Ericsson birth is that it continued the tradition of failed moments.

This season started awful, improved only slightly in the middle, and now has ended as it began - vapid, stalled, repetitious and unfunny.  Clearly HIMYM has exhausted its premise - even the acting has become formulaic and ""phoned in"" as the stars begin to pursue new projects and are devoting less energy to the show.  It is time to have Ted meet the girl of his dreams and put this show out of its exhausted misery.",1337040000,19,2610,4.606911447084233
