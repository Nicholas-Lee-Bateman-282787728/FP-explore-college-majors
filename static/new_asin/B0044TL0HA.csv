8416319,5,B0044TL0HA,"This is probably an unusual genre for many Americans, especially those mistaking it for porn. It has erotic elements but at least to me its not porn.

I think this movie is best watched alone, in a dark room, late at night when you can concentrate but when your perceptions might be starting to get into dream state. And don't just watch the actors - watch the scenery and camera movements, watch the ordering of the scenes. Think about what is going on. It's obvious to me the director is trying to tell a story with his film, this isn't just erotic entertainment, but at least to me its more like the director bearing part of his soul through this work.",1472083200,,655,4.413223140495868

An erotic, artistic, hypnotically ambient opium dream, Les Gamins (French for ""The Street Urchins""), aims to not only arouse, but also - if one be so inclined - to think.

According to director HCK, Les Gamins main theme is voyeurism, with hints at the reliability of memory as well. Beyond that, the film's intentions are a bit of a mystery; even, one could say, completely subjective to the viewers perception. Some find Les Gamins to be the fantasy (or memory of experience) of a hidden voyeur, witnessed from their point of view. Others have even seen the film as the documentation of the events before a murder. HCK himself certainly seems to have a story to tell, but what that story is, he would prefer you to decide for yourself.

The music and sound also play an important, if not integral, role in the film. The outstanding score by Kevin MacLeod (minus one track from OZU) adds a sense of beauty, dread, surreality and intention to the subtle actions of Naomi and Risa. To describe the music, I would chance to describe it as experimental ambient with hints of modern classical, found sounds and industrial.

Relative newcomer Studio Happy Chicken Pink bring Les Gamins to international audiences in an edited-for-Japan DVD presentation (which is the version I watched) and an extended, uncensored Blu-ray edition. I highly suggest picking up the Blu-ray if you have the means to play it, as it is a higher quality presentation and contains both versions of the film. Unfortunately, I have yet to upgrade my viewing options. As soon as I do, I will update this review to include the additional material cut from my version.

Les Gamins is not only erotic, but also dark and thought-provoking. I look forward to future releases from Studio Happy Chicken Pink, and feel that Les Gamins is a great introduction to gravure film, or a nice addition to any fans collection.
