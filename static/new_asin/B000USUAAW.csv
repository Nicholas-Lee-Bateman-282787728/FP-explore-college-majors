8214639,5,B000USUAAW,"the blue collar comedy tour rides again is just as funny as the fist one. it is fun to hear the fans tell their most favorite you might be a redneck joke, and the way they edit it together with other people telling the same joke. its fun to see the guys at the end of the movie when they are all together and they tell there favorite story or joke on each other. if you own the first one or a fan of any of the four (jeff, larry, bill, or ron) you need to own this movie.",1263686400,,471,3.7676767676767677
