2327648,5,B0009WIDY4,As a teacher it is a welcome to have such an outstanding visual display of correct ballet technique.  I highly recommend this product,1249948800,,133,4.782608695652174
2327649,4,B0009WIDY4,The contents in this visual dictionary are no doubt extremely practical and useful for an adult Ballerina like me. The narrator's voice is soothing and the DVD menu is clear and straight-forward. It serves as great reference tool when I have any doubt of executing certain moves properly.,1229904000,5,288,5.020833333333333
2327650,1,B0009WIDY4,"Although I gleaned one or two nuggets from this DVD... As a dancer and ballet teacher, I was offended by the flawed technique of the demonstration dancers. I was appalled by the exaggerated head positions, turn-out, arms, etc. I was bothered by the tense shoulders which should be relaxed and held so the neck is long and the body line is uninterrupted. At the very least, an instructor should have been present to correct the problems and explain to the viewer the correct way to execute these exercises. I would not recommend this DVD series to my students or anyone wishing to learn proper classical ballet technique.",1218153600,31,620,4.803738317757009
2327651,5,B0009WIDY4,"I found this video very useful in terms of showing how dance steps should be executed.  The children used were all very intense in their performances.  Some of them didn't dance perfectly, but they made honest efforts to strive for the perfection required by ballet.  For students who need to see how dance terminology should look, this is a good reference.  It starts from learning how to stand to actually dancing in groups in center combinations of pirouettes, jetes, developpes, and so on, with some groups being more advanced than others to illustrate how the basics must be learned before more advanced and more lengthly dance combinations are tried.  The film is slow enough to watch the dancers as they cambre, point their toes, do their port de bras and generally move around proportionately in groups, which is important in terms of dancing together with other students.  I especially thought the 2-disk set was very comprehensive and easy to navigate, in order to study various aspects of the process of learning to dance.  Although it only shows young children, and rightly so, because it is necessary to start this type of training from the beginning and young children especially would gain much from these serious examples, I would recommend this video to students of any level and any age who want to improve their knowledge ballet technique in order to dance better.",1139356800,41,1383,4.935344827586207
2327652,5,B0009WIDY4,"I'm an adult ballet dancer, and I loved it. This DVD is perfect for children and adults.",1129593600,16,88,4.235294117647059
8068430,5,B0009WIDY4,"This is a wonderful book.  I thought my granddaughter who has taken ballet for almost 5 years would love it.  Good pictures and step-by-step directions.  She didn't....it was just too many details.  However, it is a great reference book and has tons of information.  So, it didn't work for her but could be useful.",1494201600,,314,4.7407407407407405
8068431,5,B0009WIDY4,"My six year old daughter was fascinated with ballet and wanted to take classes. Before I signed her up and paid the monthly fee, I bought this DVD for her.  She absolutely loved learning ballet from the video.  It was interesting and fun.  She felt like she was really in a ballet class!",1467936000,,287,4.377358490566038

8068433,5,B0009WIDY4,"While I am very far from professional, I have been dancing for a few years and I have to say this DVD helped me a lot. A year or two ago I borrowed this same DVD from my library and I was delighted to find that on the second disc there is a full ballet class that you can follow, the instructor calls out the steps as you go with the music. I always have trouble remembering what I need to do to warm up and practice barre so this was perfect for me. I noticed a comment about the girls' flawed techniques and while this is probably true, someone who already dances and knows (generally) the proper technique could use this DVD without issue. This is perfect to use at home in conjunction with regular dance lessons.",1456444800,,716,4.195652173913044

8068437,5,B0009WIDY4,"This has been great for my daughter, who changed ballet schools and skiped a grade so had to catch up on her ballet theory. This DVD has helped my daughter heaps, she now feels she knows what she is doing and is no longer intimidated by the older girls in her class, as she feels she can keep up with them.",1366070400,2,306,4.032786885245901
