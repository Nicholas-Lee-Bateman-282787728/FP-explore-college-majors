8128730,2,B000G1T4B4,"I've got to say, this dvd was a huge disappointment.  I love everything I've seen by Santerineross and the content on the dvd was cool, but there was just so little.  For one, Amazon says there is about 45 minutes worth of material on the disc...there are literally less than 20.  There was absolutely no historical or biographical material (or interview with the artist).  The film had four short videos and three of which were largely photographs put to an eerie industrial soundtrack (but there was some actual video content in addition to the photographs in the third).  Basically, if you've seen any of his work, you've seen a good chunk of the film's content.  The last and longest of the four videos (6 minutes) was beautifully haunting.  Again, my complaint is not with the content so much as the quantity.  It just seemed lazy to put this out with the amount of content it had.  It felt like the artist needed a few bucks and scraped together some work to put on a dvd.  As a fan of any artist, I want to know about them.  The dvd almost feels like an insult for a fan that is genuinely curious about an artist's work.  I want to hear them talk about their work and influences.  Or maybe their process and how they evolved as an artist.  Here, you get what is largely a powerpoint picture presentation.",1336089600,,1311,4.476793248945148
8128731,3,B000G1T4B4,"First of all let me say I am in no way downplaying John Santerineross' work. 5 stars all the way. Pure beauty in its darkest and most intriguing form.

I gave this presentation only 3 stars since the transfer is bad. His images are grainy, low res. Even though I enjoyed the dvd overall, 3 of the pieces on it seemed like rehashes of one another. Similar clips/stills/materials just rearranged w a different score. Different interpretations of the material, but nothing new overall. Needs more variety exploring his body of work more.

Even the interview was grainy. Moreso, at the beginning of this interview, ""Play"" is visible in the upper right hand corner as if someone was transferring this clip from their vcr. Poor quality.

His work is amazing on many levels and emotions. I am a bit disappointed in the overall technical execution of this title.",1205712000,2,854,4.795918367346939
8128732,5,B000G1T4B4,"I've long been a fan of John Santerineross' evocative artwork.  His images are hauntingly beautiful and thought provoking.  It was exciting to learn he is expanding into the medium of film.  I purchased the DVD for that reason and was not disappointed.  His short film, ""Child, Doll or Bone"", brings a quiet, gentle, beauty to subject matter rarely perceived in that way.  BUT, best of all, the DVD contained an unexpected treat. The slide shows & multimedia presentation are just wonderful.  When I recently hosted a holiday party, I played them to add to the ambiance of the evening.  I feel they really enhanced the feel.  Several of my guests commented that they finally understand what draws me so strongly to Santerineross artwork.  Just get this DVD and you will understand too.",1164672000,2,785,4.886363636363637
8128733,5,B000G1T4B4,"This DVD is the most comprehensive representation of this amazing artist's collection of photographic works as well as his initial foray into film. It is a ""must have"" for fans as well as newcomers.  His unique and hauntingly honest representation of the human condition is both refreshing as well as intensely emotional.

The glimpse into his creative process is also fascinating and inspiring. If you have not experienced his work this is definitely the best way to get an initial taste. You will likely end up thirsting for more.",1164499200,2,532,4.966292134831461
8128734,5,B000G1T4B4,"This Dvd is a beautiful glimpse into the world, and work, of John Santerineross, known as the leader in this genre, of art photography,

he treats us to all the photographs in both of his books, ""Fruit of The Secret God"", and ""Dream"", he includes a montage of film clips taken while he composes his pieces, and a short art film about a shocking subject(cutting), done very tenderly, so as not to shock.

  This little film, in spite of breath taking visuals, is not so much eye candy, as it is mind candy, leaving a hauntingly, bittersweet,  after taste on the tongue.  The images are living assembelages of religio-sensual elements, presented through a dream like filter.  The sepia tone photography, evokes the feeling of, a memory,a strange familiarity, regarding our desires and fears.  His work is a wild roller coaster ride, which, thrills, and at times, terrifies, and leaves you wanting to ""go again"".

  The images of women portrayed in this work,  are a refreshing respite

from the mainstream images of women that, we are bombarded with daily in the media. Like REAL women, each image begs to be studied for content. The film itself is not long but is filled with so much information, so much to process, it is an epic in its own right.

  I highly recommend any of John Santerineross's work, to lovers of neo- symbolist, art, photography, and erotica. To other artists like myself he is truly an inspiration.",1163376000,5,1420,4.758196721311475
8128735,5,B000G1T4B4,"Santerineross' multimedia presentation explores the human experience through a spectrum of ancient and contemporary spiritual, social, and erotic themes. The artist challenges each of us to look deep within one's self and explore the darker aspects of human nature. Darkness is often ill-defined by negative cultural connotations.  However, the essence of our being exists neither in light or darkness, but in the shadows of mystery that is life. The scope of Santerineross' photographic images and alluring short film ""Child, Doll or Bone,"" is a luminous interpretation of myth, beauty, and pain.  This DVD is an enchanting exhibit.",1161561600,,633,5.515463917525773
8128736,2,B000G1T4B4,"This multimedia presentation was nice.  The images where amazing, I would give it a five but, I felt lost.  I didn't know anything about the artist or what neo-symbolist photography was.  I was hoping that there would was background history on the photographer and why he chose to do this. I also wanted maybe a little information of what neo-symbolist photography is.  So if you know who Snterineross is and what neo-symbolist photography is i highly recommend it.  but if you don't, stay away, until you do.",1158537600,,509,4.804597701149425
8128737,5,B000G1T4B4,"This is a MUST have for anyone who appreciates fine art!  The slide shows show ALL of Santerineross' images, the multimedia presentation actually shows footage of some of his photoshoots (which is AMAZING to see!) intermingled with his photographs!  Until now only his models saw this process- now we get to see this intimate glance into his creative process!  And words cannot express how powerful the short film ""Child, Doll or Bone"" is!  Hauntingly beautiful- like one of his images came to life!  (I am sure the bonus postcards are going to become a collector's item, too.)",1151107200,2,577,4.907216494845361
