8536901,3,B000AXTJKY,"The dancing and energy in this movie was amazing. However, the sound, lighting, and even the story line itself was in need of improvement. The story was hard to follow, and I'm sorry, but the narrator just needs to go, and some of the sappy scenes. But, there were some great moments in the film - the comedic tap dancing group was hilarious! (Although why they were in the show was beyond me) Most of the dances were really good, and fun to watch. I would recommend this film with a caution to look beyond it's weaknesses!",1161734400,2,523,4.402061855670103
