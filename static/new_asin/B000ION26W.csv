She loves the songs and dances and always tries to copy the kids in some ways.
She learns a lot of moves",1377561600,,183,3.972972972972973
8146794,5,B000ION26W,I bought several toddler exercise dvds and this one is my kids' favorite! My kids ask to watch it as soon as they wake up and before they go to bed at night.,1352073600,,157,3.787878787878788
8146795,5,B000ION26W,"My two year old daughter loves the Monkeydoos! And I love that they get her up and moving, while building her vocabulary through song and dance!!!",1310774400,3,146,4.653846153846154
8146796,4,B000ION26W,"Oh my goodness - just be ready to watch it about 500 times!  My child absolutley LOVES it and wants to watch it constantly.  Great for him, driving my husband and me CRAZY!!!  Whatever works though, right?!!

It's basically broken down into about 10 segments or so, and children do ""exercises"" to different ""things that go.""  For instance, there's one segment where they are pretending to balance on surf boards, one where they are pretending to soar like airplanes, one where they ride a ""magic bicycle,"" etc.  It's all ""cute"" and is really entertaining for kids.

The one segment we could have done without is ""Whizzy the Helicopter"" where the kids are spinning around in circles with their arms out.  Seems dangerous to me.  I'm just waiting for my kid to knock into the wall or furniture while doing this one.

Oddly enough, the part my kid loves the most and could watch repeatedly is a segement at the end called, ""Plane Delicious"" where a child shows you how to make a snack with graham crackers, bananas, raisins and peanut butter in the shape of a plane.  My two year old just loves watching her put that thing together.  :)",1221350400,5,1133,4.61
8146797,4,B000ION26W,"My daughter loves this DVD.  It encourages exercise and musical creativity.  Ever since she's watched this DVD for the first time, she's been making up songs for everything.

I highly recommend all Monkeydoo DVDs.",1191801600,4,213,5.205882352941177
