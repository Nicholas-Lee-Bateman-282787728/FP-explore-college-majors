3.5 stars

Pros:
-Dark, but light enough to appeal to those that need happy endings
-Past paced (never dragged)
-Acting was passable (especially for a B-movie)

Cons:
-It was a B-movie
-sometimes skirted on the ""feel good"" movie genre (ok, so I like my stuff dark)

This was a good movie with no real surprises, but the acting was much better than most B-movies of the time.  I still can get over Hugh Beaumont as anything but Wally and Theodore's Dad, so I never really saw him as a tough cop.

Sheila Ryans character doesnt recognize a bad character either, namely John Irelands. Hugh Beaumont is solid as a thorough, cool and collected investigator. Ireland loses his cool and with no sanctity for life. Perhaps channeling Widmark's famous debut from 1947. The film adds an extra dose of noir in noir. So dark it is hard to see whats going on at times. Beaumont and Ireland aim guns in cave darkness better than most. This is strictly for noir or pre-Cleaver fans.",1427587200,4,648,4.794642857142857

439027,5,6302247268,"Railroaded has a lot going for it -- the film noir stylish cues, sexy characters, taut storyline, and the sense that you too could easily get set-up (railroaded).  But Railroaded has so much more:  Perfumed bullets!  And a Cat fight that is one of the best ever filmed!

Steve Ireland is excellent as the evil villain Duke, a sexy misogynist obsessed with his gun, so much so that he is constantly stroking it as he eyes his victims and polishes his bullets with perfume. Terse, hotheaded, and violent, Duke is right up there with the best film criminals. Ireland later was nominated for an Academy Award.

Equally great is Jane Randolph as Clara, his blonde moll, a cool, brash, lying girlfriend who runs a salon that is a front for a backroom bookie operation.  She helps Duke rob their boss.  When things go wrong, she helps Duke set up an innocent kid as the thief and cop killer.  When she starts to have doubts, she starts to drink sloppily and lounge around in her feathery negligee in the finest tradition of Hollywood gun molls.

That's when Clara and the innocent kid's sister get into their cat fight, one of the longest and most drawn out I've seen in a film up to this point (1947). They pull hair, slug each other, knock over furniture -- and the whole time Duke is lurking in the shadows watching, following the action with his gun as if he's not sure who he would rather have the pleasure of shooting.

While the ending is also great, with its dark shadows, quick edits, and tension -- for me the cat fight is the greatest scene of the film.

Forget about the plot, which makes little sense. And Hugh Beaumont (Leave it to Beaver's dad) is wooden as the detective, as is Sheila Ryan, the cute brunette who is both his and Duke's love interest (don't ask).  Ed Kelly plays the set up victim, and he's cute and excellent as a genuine innocent -- too bad he didn't make more films.

439030,4,6302247268,"I am, and I am publically on record on this question, very indulgent toward an off-hand femme fatale in a film noir shooting up a guy, even a guy trying to help her, in order to get what she wants, usually the dough. It is a cruel world out there and a girl has got to do what a girl has to do to keep the wolves from the door. So I had no problem, or maybe just a little problem, when Jane Greer in Out Of The Past shot up her fancy man (Kirk Douglas) and ran off with some of his dough and he, just to keep his manhood intact, hired Robert Mitchum to go get her (and the dough). And, of course like with all guys, guys built for heavy lifting like Mitchum or just wimps like me, once old Mitchum got a look at her, or maybe even caught her scent in the Mexican night air he was a goner. So later when they were on the run and she off-handedly put a bullet or six in some new sleuth hired to find her and him I just charged it off to overhead. And even when things got tough and she needed to go back to her sugar daddy Kirk and things didn't work out and she had to blast him, and in the end helpful Mitchum I just chalked it up to circumstances. Even with trigger happy junior league femmes like Irene (played by Helen Walker) in the film noir Impact I could see where her being married to some major league Walter Mitty-type would keep her from full attention to her low-rent boyfriend  and gave her a pass on her plot to murder the guy. That is just the way I am with cinematic femmes.

But I draw the line with stone-cold killer guys, hard boys kept around to do some heavy lifting for an off-hand mobster lets' say, like in the film under review, Railroaded. No dice, no way. They had got to get what is coming to them. Especially when said stone killer, here one Duke Martin, framed an innocent guy in the process. Maybe it is just because in real life I was close, way too close, to some junior league hard boys when I was growing up and they were winning their spurs by some ill-designed caper, like a mom and pop store robbery, or holding up a gas station in the days when they were easy to knock off, or maybe a liquor to get some walking around money. Hell, maybe it goes back before that when they would bonk a guy for his school lunch money or just bonk a guy to do it because they could do it. No indulgences, okay, none this side of heaven.

Duke, well, Duke Martin (played by John Ireland), as the story unfold in Railroaded, wouldn't qualify for indulgences anyway whatever I thought of hard boys, or femmes for that matter. This guy had no manners as he tried to pin a busted bookie joint (his boss' to boot) robbery on a delivery boy (a guy who did some hard war time service while Duke was probably shooting craps with some ""mark""). Worst Duke offs with about as much regret as he would for swapping a fly every person who could, or who might, or maybe who just might think in the deep recesses of his or her mind about turning him in. No, this bad guy had got to fall, and fall hard.

And as is the nature of such film noirs Duke falls due to his own hubris, and his obsessive need to overplay every situation. He gets some help in his downfall by the intrepid work of the deliveryman's fetching and no-nonsenses sister Rosie (played by Shelia Ryan) and tough but good (of course) cop Mickey (played by Hugh Beaumont) who play on his weaknesses for good-looking women (or rather the next best thing that comes along after he finishes with a dame) and a certain need to try to intimidate everybody around him. So he falls, and good riddance. Now if Rita Hayworth in say The Lady From Shang-hai had been in that fix, well, you know where I stand. Got it.",1348358400,,3675,4.142857142857143

439032,5,6302247268,"I am surprised at the negative reviews for this release. Everyone seems to like SUDDEN FEAR and THE LONG NIGHT, but what about HANGMEN ALSO DIE? It has been one of my favorites for years. Whenever I want to see something unrelentingly dark and gloomy with beautiful photography, I watch HANGMEN. It was directed by Fritz Lang, co-written by Bertolt Brecht, and photographed by James Wong Howe. How could it be less than brilliant? Then there's RAILROADED directed by the great Anthoiny Mann. It's a B film, but Mann's B films are better than many A's. RAILROADED isn't as brilliant as T-MEN, but it is still a good watch. BEHIND LOCKED DOORS is the least of the bunch, but even it is fun in a lurid, Samuel Fuller, tabloid kind of way.

Some of the negative comments are about the lack of restoration. Honestly, I get so tired of these people harping on restoration. They act like anyone who releases an unrestored film is callously trying to cheat their customers. They should be glad these films are available at all. There's nothing that says they have to be, and many films never will be. Wouldn't you rather have them than not have them? If kino hadn't released these five films, you wouldn't be able to buy them, period. And the way people whine, you would think that film restoration is a cheap and easy thing that distributors withold out of pure meanness. In reality, restoration is massively expensive. Even minor restoration is beyond the means of most distributors, and a full restoration would bankrupt most companies. To do a good job at restoration requires a huge investment and can only be done on films which will sell enough copies to make that money back. That's the financial reality at this point in the game. So stop whining and be thankfull for what we've got. That said, these films are not in terrible shape at all. There are small issues but certainly nothing that will keep any reasonable person from enjoying them. If you love classic films, especially when they're really dark, you need to have these.

439074,3,6302247268,"RAILROADED! is a good Anthony Mann low-budget noir.  John Ireland is wonderfully villainous in the role of Duke Martin.  Duke is the hired henchman of a local casino, but he has ambitious plans of his own.

The plot involves Duke and a fellow named Kowalski, who rob a hairdressing studio that is also a front for bookmaking activities.  Duke's girlfriend Clara (Jane Randolph) is in on the heist, but things go wrong, as her co-worker Marie's (Peggy Converse) scream is noticed by a policeman, who ends up dead at the scene.

A total innocent, Steve Ryan (Ed Kelly) is framed for the murder.  Police Sgt. Mickey Ferguson (Hugh Beaumont) arrests Steve, and he seems to have an air-tight case.  But Steve's sister Rosie (Sheila Ryan) believes he is innocent, and gets involved with Duke Martin, in an effort to learn the truth.

RAILROADED!, in my opinion, is not as good as RAW DEAL OR T-MEN.  I think the biggest reason for this is Sheila Ryan.  In the scenes she is in, especially the latter ones, she is very wooden.  This reminds you that it is a film, and it dulls the impact; instead of the finale being particularly intense, you marvel at the orchestration of Anthony Mann's adroit direction.

Still, a good noir film, and one to view repeatedly, if only for John Ireland's bravura performance.

The KINO print is fine, and is available for less than half the price, in the 2006 DVD set ""Film Noir - The Dark Side of Hollywood"" collection, along with Sudden Fear, The Long Night, Hangmen Also Die, and Behind Locked Doors.",1273536000,,1529,4.66044776119403

439076,3,6302247268,"For people who grew up watching ""Leave It To Beaver"" on TV, this film offers Hugh Beaumont as a main character. Beaumont is famous for playing Beaver's dad ""Ward.""  In this movie, he's a tough cop, and fun to watch. I also enjoyed ogling a pretty brunette, ""Rosie,"" played by Sheila Ryan.

The climax to this story was good, and it was surprisingly realistic. There was some decent film-noir photography in spots, too. That's no surprise considering Anthony Mann was the director.

The film is okay, but with the high price (VHS, at the time, and now DVD) it tends to give you really high expectations. I found I liked this more on the second viewing when I knew what to expect and my expectations were a bit lower.

In the beginning, the story dwells too long on the innocent man-being arrested theme but after that part is over, it picks up. John Ireland is good as the villain ""Duke.""",1239580800,,887,4.525
439077,4,6302247268,"The collection Film Noir - The Dark Side of Hollywood boasts on the box cover that it features ""Five Classics from the Studio Vaults"".  It may be a little much to call these films ""classics"" (no one will ever mistake these movies for such greats as Out of the Past or The Asphalt Jungle), but they are all okay, or in some cases, even good.

The first in the bunch (chronologically speaking) is Hangmen Also Die, a World War II thriller directed by Fritz Lang and based on real events.  Brian Donlevy plays a member of the Czech resistance who is responsible for the assassination of Heydrich.  Anna Lee gets entangled with him, and soon both are in peril.  The Nazis threaten to execute innocent people till the assassin comes forth, including Lee's father.  This film is only borderline noir, but it is still good.

Railroaded is a rather standard innocent-man-accused mystery, probably most notable for featuring a pre-Leave It To Beaver Hugh Beaumont as the detective in love with Sheila Ryan even as her brother languishes in jail.  John Ireland is effective as the villain in the piece.

The Long Night is the ""big name"" movie in the set.  Directed by Anatole Litvak, it stars Henry Fonda, Barbara Bel Geddes, Vincent Price and a small role for Elisha Cook, Jr.  Fonda is holed up in his apartment, surrounded by cops who want to take him in for a murder.  The bulk of the movie is a long flashback as to how he got into this spot.  Vincent Price is great as a slimy magician, and Bel Geddes is okay in what I believe is her first role (between this movie, Vertigo and 14 Hours - the three movies I've seen her in - I don't think she ever has a normal love relationship with any man).  This film is a remake of a French movie and the only DVD with any sort of special features (a video essay on the making of the movie).

Behind Locked Doors is a short (62 minutes) little private eye story with Richard Carlson as a private detective who is recruited by a beautiful reporter to go undercover in a sanitarium where it is believed a crooked judge is hiding out.  Of course, the doctor and his assistant are in cahoots with the judge and Carlson soon finds himself trapped ""behind locked doors.""  Probably the most interesting thing about this movie is it has Tor Johnson (of Plan 9 From Outer Space fame) in a role that uses all of his limited acting talents.

Finally, there is Sudden Fear which I feel is the best in the bunch.  Joan Crawford is a playwright and heiress who gets actor Jack Palance fired because he doesn't seem like a romantic leading man.  When they meet by chance later, she falls for him and they marry, but it turns out he's a better romantic actor than she ever thought; he is actually scheming with an old girlfriend to kill her and get her money.  When Crawford finds out by accident, she launches her own counter-scheme.  Although this film owes more than a little to Hitchcock's Suspicion, it also goes off in its own direction and does a good job at leaving the viewer guessing about how it all turns out.

As mentioned earlier, there are hardly any extras in this set.  Railroaded and Behind Locked Doors are three-star movies, while the others are four-star flicks.  I will go with the majority and rate it four stars.  These may not be classics, but this set does offer a chance to see some less well-known, decent movies.",1174521600,12,3360,4.485197368421052

This collection includes great titles from great directors (Fritz Lang, Anthony Mann) and they star some of Hollywood's all time greats like Joan Crawford, Henry Fonda, Jack Palance and many more. Here's a little description for each film:

SUDDEN FEAR (1952) - STARRING JOAN CRAWFORD, JACK PALANCE & GLORIA GRAHAME - DIRECTED BY DAVID MILLER - NOMINATED FOR 4 ACADEMY AWARDS - SYNOPSIS: Joan Crawford turns in one of the most emotionally charged performances of her career as a playwright who must use her plotting skills to save her own life, in this beautifully crafted film noir thriller. On a train headed home to California, Myra Hudson (Crawford) falls in love with, and marries, actor Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) whom she has just fired from her most recent New York play. Back on her San Francisco estate, something evil appears to be lurking just beneath the surface of the couple's idyllic life. Enter Gloria Grahame as Palance's girlfriend (in a stunning performance the New York Times called ""hard, brash and sexy.""). Soon it is clear that they are after more than new scripts as they greedily scheme for Myra's money. Director David Miller (Lonely Are The Brave) guides the story with supreme confidence, assisted by gorgeous black and white cinematography and an excellent score by Elmer Bernstein, as Sudden Fear races towards its jolting climax. Nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Actress (Crawford) and Best Supporting Actor (Palance), Sudden Fear is the unbeatable combination of a lushly produced Joan Crawford melodrama and a drop-dead suspense thriller. They just don't make 'em like this anymore!

THE LONG NIGHT (1947) - STARRING HENRY FONDA, BARBARA BEL GEDDES & VINCENT PRICE - DIRECTED BY ANATOLE LITVAK - SYNOPSIS: An exciting rediscovery from the studio vaults, The Long Night is an emotionally gripping, visually dynamic film noir, in which Henry Fonda, at the peak of his career, delivers an unforgettable performance. Presented in an intricate web of flashbacks, The Long Night follows the fractured thoughts of Joe Adams (Henry Fonda), a factory worker pinned inside his third-floor apartment after gunning down a mysterious, dapper gentleman (Vincent Price). Joe's memories, often containing flashbacks within flashbacks, reconstruct the events leading up to the shooting, revealing his romance with a quiet young girl (Barbara Bel Geddes), his less-romantic involvement with a worn-out showgirl (Ann Dvorak) and the varied twists of fate which drove Joe to murder. In staging this remake of Marcel Carn's Le Jour Se Leve (France, 1939), the producers of The Long Night imported not only the story, but the look of poetic realism that made the original so haunting. At once dismal and magical, the world of The Long Night was unlike anything Hollywood had yet imagined, and laid the groundwork for the dark and gritty (but highly stylized) imagery that became the trademark of film noir.

HANGMEN ALSO DIE (1943) - STARRING BRIAN DONLEVY, ANNA LEE & WALTER BRENNAN - DIRECTED BY FRITZ LANG - NOMINATED FOR 2 ACADEMY AWARDS - SYNOPSIS: Pursued by the Germans after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, Dr. Svobonda (Brian Donlevy) enlists the aid of a young woman (Anna Lee) who is oblivious to the lethal crosscurrents that surround her. As she learns more about the mysterious doctor, she grows aware of the involvement of her father (Walter Brennan) and fiance (Dennis O'Keefe) in the resistance, and soon finds herself entangled in the revolution's secret operations. Much of the nightmarish quality of Hangmen Also Die is attributable to playwright Bertolt Brecht, who co-scripted the film with Lang, and legendary cinematographer James Wong Howe (Hud), who cloaks every conrner in shadow and endows the film with an almost tangible sense of claustrophobia.

RAILROADED (1947) - STARRING JOHN IRELAND, SHEILA RYAN & HUGH BEAUMONT - DIRECTED BY ANTHONY MANN - SYNPOSIS: Anthony Mann, who took the suspense of film noir to dizzying heights with his movies T-Men and Raw Deal, brings his talents to the hard-boiled detective thriller with Railroaded. When a policeman is killed attempting to thwart a holdup, Detective Mickey Ferguson is assigned to the case. The case becomes personal, though, when the kid brother of Mickey's sweetheart is named as the gunman. Determined to find the truth, Mickey goes searching for clues and comes up with notorious gangster Duke Martin, played by John Ireland (Spartacus, Gunfight At The OK Corral). What follows is a blood-and-thunder extravaganza filled with betrayal and suspicions, handguns and hostages, and a climactic nightclub showdown. Mann directs Railroaded with a precision and elegance that betrays its low-budget production, and John Ireland's cold-blooded performance is backed up by a talented (if unknown) cast, including Hugh Beaumont (Ward of television's Leave It To Beaver) and Shelia Ryan

BEHIND LOCKED DOORS (1948) - STARRING RICHARD CARLSON, LUCILLE BREMER & TOR JOHNSON - DIRECTED BY BUDD BOETTICHER (SEVEN MEN FROM NOW) - SYNOPSIS: A shadowy sanitarium provides the claustrophobic stage for sadism, paranoia and murder in this classic film noir from director Budd Boetticher (Tall T, Comanche Station). In a plot that clearly foreshadowed Sam Fuller's Shock Corridor, private detective Ross Stewart (Richard Carlson) checks himself into a mental hospital in an attempt to locate a corrupt judge hiding from justice. But before Stewart can reveal the truth, his true identity is discovered and he becomes a victim of his own ruse. With the help of a deranged punch-drunk ex-prizefighter (Tor Johnson of Plan 9 From Outer Space), the doctors at La Siesta Sanitarium concoct a plan to make Stewart a permanent resident. And the only person who shares Stewart's secret, the only one who can rescue him from certain death, is the scheming woman who sent him there (Lucille Bremer). A bare-bones, low-budget B thriller from Hollywood's ""Poverty Row,"" Behind Locked Doors cleverly compensates for its budgetary limitations by bathing its sets in darkness. This visual spareness is perfectly suited to Boetticher's terse, hard-edged style, making the film a nightmarish ride through the halls of insanity and an ingenious, effective example of American film noir.",1153699200,82,6327,5.266600594648167
439080,4,6302247268,"""Railroaded"" is a low-budget film noir from director Anthony Mann that proves -as so many films of the classic noir era did- that you can pack more themes, character writing, and entertainment into a 72-minute B-movie than most modern extravaganzas that run over 2 hours and cost $100 million. ""Railroaded"" takes a direct approach. It's clear who the good guys and bad guys are, but the villains are something to see.

A beauty shop that houses an illegal gambling operation for a man named Jackland Ainsworth (Roy Gordon) is robbed by two men, leaving a police officer dead and one of the culprits critically wounded. The owner of the shop, Clara Calhoun (Jane Randolph), and her thuggish paramour Duke Martin (John Ireland), who committed the robbery, conspire to frame Steve Ryan (Ed Kerry), an innocent whose laundry truck was used in the getaway. Steve is arrested by police detective Mickey Ferguson (Hugh Beaumont), and the authorities are content to pin the job on him. But Steve's sister Rosie (Sheila Ryan) is convinced of his innocence and determined to prove it.

Determined, forthright Rosie and mild mannered detective Ferguson make a pleasant, adversarial, pair of sleuths. But ""Railroaded""'s strength is its villains. John Ireland and Jane Randolph steal the show as amoral antagonists. Duke is a cold-blooded killer who perfumes his bullets. He's not smart, but he's meticulous and obsessive. The shootings are somehow startling, although not graphic. Clara is smarmy, alcoholic, and desperate. ""Railroaded"" is a nice little Freudian film noir. A knock-down drag-out brawl between good girl Rosie and bad girl Clara is a fun bonus.

The DVD (Kino Video 2000 release): This print of the film has some white specks, but no serious flaws. There are no bonus features apart from an awkward scene selection menu. Hit ""menu"" on your remote twice to get to it.",1120348800,8,1870,5.064935064935065
439081,5,6302247268,"Clara and Marie are running a bookie operation for the girls in the back room of Clara's beauty salon.  The owner of the Bombay Club is financing the venture.  Clara's boyfriend Duke manages the club and collects the take from a string of bookie joints.  With Clara in tow he decides to fake a heist.  Marie, not in on the plan, screams when a shotgun in shoved in her face and alerts a nearby police patrolman.  The policeman is shot dead and Duke's partner is fatally wounded, surviving only long enough to implicate innocent Steve Ryan and lead the police away from Duke.

  RAILROADED! is a taut little crime caper, made on the cheap at that cheapest of Poverty Row studios, PRC.  It's probably been spared the lingering obscurity common to most b-movies because of our current fascination with all things noirs and because it's one of the early works of director Anthony Mann, who would soon graduate to the big leagues and collaborate with Jimmy Stewart on some of the best Westerns made in the 1950s.

 John Ireland plays Duke with coiled menace, a killer devoid of humanity, someone who massages his pistol past polishing with a perfumed handkerchief.  Make of that what you will, but it provides the police with a sweet-scented clue when they remove the fatal bullet from the blasted patrolman.  Hugh Beaumont, Beaver's dad, plays the good police detective who slowly realizes that the perfect suspect, the sandy-haired young Steve, may be as guiltless as he professes.  Beaumont played some very strange and twisted characters in his pre-Leave It to Beaver, b-movie career, but he's a reassuringly straight arrow good guy here.  The pivot the Good Guy and the Bad Guy fight over is Steve's pretty sister Rosa (Sheila Ryan), who's convinced of her brother's innocence and is willing to dance with the devil Duke to clear his name.  My favorite character is Ferguson's (Beaumont) sidekick Chubb (Clancy Cooper), a gum-chewing square-jawed cop who glowers at Steve during his interrogation.

 If you're a fan of Mann's Westerns, RAILROADED! should probably satisfy.  It's interesting to see what Mann does with a limited budget in an urban setting.  One of my favorite shots occur early on, when the gun toting thugs seemingly rise out of a dark and dirty alley into the foreground of the scene.  You'll miss the tormented central character and the Technicolor western landscapes, but Mann throws in a trademark Good Girl/Bad Girl fistfight with a gun drawn Duke watching from the shadows.  RAILROADED! is a strong early work from a master director, and good fun to boot.",1091923200,,2578,4.891705069124424
439082,4,6302247268,"Beautiful Clara Calhoun (Jane Randolph) is both a beautician and bookie, so it is not surprising her boyfriend Duke Martin (John Ireland) is involved with the mob.  What is surprising is that he plans on robbing her place.  The ill-fated plan blows up in Duke's face, and both his partner, Cowie, and a cop end up dead.  But before he dies, Cowie points the finger at Steve Ryan (Ed Kelly), who is arrested by Detective Mickey Ferguson (Hugh Beaumont).  This is actually where ""Railroaded!"" becomes interesting, because the detective falls for Ryan's sister, Rosie (Sheila Ryan), who is trying to get the goods on Duke, who has been busy bumping off everybody who might do exactly that.
The script for this 1947 gangster film has some major holes in it, but ""Railroaded!"" is worth watching because of the work of director Anthony Mann on this film noir. The dialogue and the acting match each other, which is not a compliment, but seeing Ward Cleaver as a hard-boiled detective is certainly a treat. However, it is Ireland's performance as the crazed killer who likes to perfume his bullets that you will remember. This is not classic film noir, but Mann's visual style is above average for the genre and fans should give this film the once over because there is more than enough here to make this worth your while.",1053475200,,1315,4.729257641921397
439083,4,6302247268,"The short (73 minutes) of this film is not a problem at all; Anthony Mann's direction is so strong that there's no wasted moment.  While some films noir suffer from being overly stiff (cf. The Big Combo), this one's fluidity is definitely in evidence.  John Ireland is the standout here, but the two female leads--Sheila Ryan and Jane Randolph--are almost as good.  A real plus, plotwise, is the 'good girl' falling (at least temporarily) for the bad guy.
Similarly, the 'bad girl' ultimately turns good.  These reversals, coupled with the bad guy's peculiar behavior (the infamous perfuming of his bullets) and an unusual shoot-out in a long-after-closing bar full of upside-down barstools make for an interesting film.
Hugh Beaumont's good guy cop is a well-matched foil to John Ireland's Duke Martin, whose occasionally drunk girlfriend meets with Beaumont, near the end, to rat out what she thinks is her two-timing boyfriend.
Definitely one of the better films noir on DVD.",1005955200,16,978,5.09375

Superb, but sadly underrated noir thriller by director Anthony Mann.
Decent print for this Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) film, a Poverty Row studio transitioning to become Eagle-Lion Films Inc. in 1947.
Anthony Mann would also soon direct such noir films as ""T-Men"", ""Raw Deal"", and ""He Walked by Night"" (as an uncredited director) for Eagle-Lion. Supporting actor Hugh Beaumont as Police Detective Mickey Ferguson, in one of many film noir appearances in his lengthy career as a familiar character actor.

Lovely chlorine JANE RANDOLPH is part of the scam where her beauty shop and ""bookie joint' in the back room are robbed by her mobster boyfriend bad to the bone~JOHN IRELAND. The robbery turns wrong when a cop is shot and one of the robbers, but not before he fingers an innocent man. Hugh Beaumont (Leave it to Beaver) is very good as the cop who has a good clue....the smell of perfume on the bullets of the victims. AS Killer Ireland bumps off a witness. Randolph drowns her sorrows in booze and becomes convinced Ireland will soon finish her off too. This is well done. Written by John C. Higgins (He Walked by Night)....Ireland is very good as the thug/killer who always has his greed get the best of his common sense. The scene stealer here is lovely Jane Randolph is excellent as the boozy witness and the stunning woman who is finally afraid of the mobster she loves. I give this one 4 STARS~ added bonus is Sheila Ryan.",1480118400,3,983,4.461111111111111
