4320655,3,B004BVS2C2,"Welcome to the tiny town of Point Pleasant, WV, population 5,000, and home to some of the strangest events ever reported. From a curse placed upon the region in 1787 by a Shawnee Chief who was murdered while negotiating a peace treaty, to 100s of reports of UFO activity, to the appearance of a winged man with glowing red eyes known as the Mothman, Point Pleasant is a natural hunting ground for those who delight in the supernatural. And a strange individual who calls himself Indrid Cold haunts the town and its residents; he speaks without moving his mouth and causes night terrors and nosebleeds in those who are unfortunate to meet up with him.

Point Pleasant has also been the site of a number of tragic events. The soil and water is contaminated by the toxic residues from a WW II TNT storage bunker; a bridge collapsed in the 1970s, killing over 40 people. Many of the residents of Point Pleasant think that these tragedies are linked to the supernatural events that have been reported there, and their opinion is shared by many students of the supernatural. But just what is the evidence for or against such a link?

Eyes of the Mothman is a documentary exploring the possible explanations for the supernatural events in Point Pleasant, and their possible link to the tragedies that have occurred there. Over two and a half hours long, the film meticulously details each supernatural report and each tragedy, presenting evidence both for and against a connection.

The content of the documentary will be interesting to any horror fan, but unfortunately, the way it is presented may not please. The film is far too long; each story is told and retold by multiple eyewitnesses and experts, which lends credibility, but also quickly becomes annoyingly repetitive. The filmmakers do a good job of presenting a balanced account of the events, and evidence both for and against supernatural happenings, but in such a dry way that we could have been watching the evening news. There is no suspense and we never got the creeps from what should be very creepy material.

Diehard supernatural buffs will find plenty to ponder and argue about in Eyes of the Mothman, but be expecting an academic treatise rather than a scary movie.",1303084800,8,2231,4.8172323759791125

Myth? Real? I can tell you that this documentary doesn't try to convince you of either or but rather presents eyewitness accounts, scientific explanations, various scenarios and even some slight history lessons( the downside of the documentary I say minus the bridge coverage ) to let the viewer decide for themselves. The director did a great job trying to cover as many angles as possible by getting those involved in some way with the incidents as well as skeptics to weigh in on the events occurring in 1966 and 1967. The document is a whopping 155 minutes which may seem like a lot of information to take in but it goes over very well for informative purposes as well as new knowledge( such and Indrid Cold ) but a lot of the information can get repetitious at times and its quite possible you may already know a lot of it. However, their is a slight downside and a slight misdirection judging by the movie title but it doesn't boggle down the overall delivery of the movie in the end. For a movie about the Mothman, I'd say about a solid 35%-40% of it is actually about the Mothman, maybe less. Narration of the documentary was ""meh"" at best. It seemed like they could have done without it and just stuck to eyewitness interviews. It offered very little in the form of transition or build-up for subject matter which never perked my interest and I often felt a sense of boredom from the narration. On the plus side, its good to put a face on Point Pleasant, WV as this documentary showcases a lot of the town in its shots. Overall:

Pros:

- Great deal of good information regarding the Mothman, UFO's, The Men in Black, Indrid Cold, and the TNT plant.
- Good creep factor to it. I found myself getting chills during the Men in Black scenes and the Indrid Cold ones.
- I, personally, found the best person in this documentary to be Chad Lambert, the author of ""Return to Point Pleasant"". He, above most of the people interviewed, had good insight and opinions on the events that occurred. His depositions made me curious as where he was going with the conversations but no one else really captured that essence.

Cons:
- The history of Chief Cornstalk was greatly unneeded. It really didn't add any depth to the story. If it really was necessary for the director to include it, cut the segment in half honestly. Much too long....
- Doesn't really empower me to do any further research. It doesn't leave the viewer in awe in anyway but that is probably due to the lack of physical evidence like actual photos and such( besides the health related issues ).
- What was with the quotes? (Watch and you'll see)

I would recommend this movie for anyone looking to get a lot of info on the whole Mothman events and surrounding phenomenon. It doesn't give greatly in-depth info most of the time but it will satisfy your curiosity.",1302307200,4,2853,4.564453125
4320657,3,B004BVS2C2,"This rather interesting and well-made documentary on the ironically named town of Pt Pleasant takes a long look at it's strange history and the weirdness of activities the residents seem to have encountered.  From the shame of a native American murder (Chief Cornstalk), the visitations of a huge, demonic, winged, red-eyed creature to the sudden collapse of the ""Silver Bridge"" that killed almost 50 people.  The title of the film is probably a marketing choice as is the cover, it's really the great irony of ""Return to Pt Pleasant.""  Not sure what the previous post about Ivanka Trump stalker is referring to but it would only add to the dark mythic ambiance of the whole enterprise and of course the place itself.

At first, I thought this is a very long (two hours and 35 minutes!) documentary that could benefit from some serious editing, but after a while I began to appreciate the extended nature of all the interviews and historical back story.  I have not seen the 2nd Disc of bonus material yet, but if the real story behind ""The Mothman"" is of any interest, here's a look at the people, the place and the legend.  Something weird happened there and there are rational, normal, God-fearing people that still remember.",1297728000,23,1228,4.796208530805687

4320659,5,B004BVS2C2,"I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed this documentary. I know quite a bit about the range of events that occurred in the area during this time, but I was delighted to find some information I didn't know about. Mostly a few of the personal stories that hadn't appeared in books on the topic. The film was quite long, but the time was used wisely. Nothing seemed to be dragged out. Everything from the ""Curse of Cornstalk to Indrid Cold to the actually bridge collapse are discussed in great detail. The only thing I wished that has been a bit more complete was the Derenberger/Indrid Cold story, but you'll have to read Derenbergers book and other sources for to get all of it.

The film-making itself is also very well done here. Sometimes, these type of documentaries contain some good information, but are difficult to watch due to an overall lack of production quality. Not the case with this film. Just very, very well done. I would recommend it over anything else as the best source of information on the subject, right along up there with John Keel's original book. I would say that my favourite aspect is probably the fact that it is actually well balanced. The entire range of explanations for these phenomena are considered, and the filmmakers don't lean to one single explanation or the other. They just present the information and allow you to decide.",1474329600,,1370,4.6846473029045645

This book is a nice counter point to John Keels ""The Mothman Prophesies"" which also cover these events in detail.

Paranormal investigators?? HAHAHA Oh man, as soon as I saw that, the whole documentary became a mockumentary. Those two clowns aside, this actually did a pretty good job of covering the Mothman issue, but it really seemed more suited as a summary of the history of the town - the Mothman issue was almost an aside to the whole story. But then there were spaceships and abductions and all kinds of crazy. Happily, it's free on NF right now, so I didn't lose a penny on this one. Though there isn't a single scare in the film, it does serve as a very good backgrounder, in my opinion.

You begin to wonder if there are ever going to get to Mothy.

Then we go though the area that is being used by the government for the manufacturer of Trinitrotoluene. We see bunkers designed to hide it from enemy aircraft over Ohio. But where is Mothy?

We see a stranger called Indrid Cold, flying saucers, a silver bridge, and finally some Mothman information tossed in as a secondary thought.

After 155 minutes it is over. We now know that they were trying to say in ""The Mothman Prophecies"" (2002.)",1404259200,,758,4.5588235294117645

This film has many interviews with witnesses about the events in Point Pleasant, WV.  I especially liked the bonus feature disc where a woman (Faye) gave a detailed account of her encounter with the Mothman.  This film is much better than the Hollywood version (Mothman Prophecies).  I like this film because you get to hear directly from people who saw the Mothman.  You also get information about other events (UFO's, Chief Cornstalk, the Silver Bridge collapse).  They give a little too much information about Chief Cornstalk, but it's still a good documentary.  Note:  If you also decide to get the Mothman Prophecies film with Richard Gere, be sure to get the Special Edition with 2 discs (special features) with it because it has interviews with real eyewitnesses on the second disc, which is better than the movie (in my opinion).

I do like how it has all historical points of this town and area. Perhaps the Producers/ Filmmakers could have made an abridged version focusing on the meat of the story (in the menu extra ) of this documentary for the attention deficient viewers. This will definitely complement the John Keel's Mothman book. I do agree with others (a minor negative) the distracting name titles that keep popping on previously tagged interviewees. This is the only type of film out there that covers the Mothman lore completely. End result a film that intrigues, informs, entertains.",1363046400,2,706,4.932773109243698

A bit longer than most (over 2 and 1/2 hours), and more a tour of the town wrapped in the shell of the Mothman tale, it's remarkably well made for an indie production. Personally, I tend  to think the mothman myth is likely a combination of real-life abnormally large or deformed birds associated with contaminant bio accumulation of a couple decades of population renewal vicinity the Magazine dump, mass hysteria, and early government aerospace testing; MIBs match descriptions for 'plainsclothes' Project Blue Book investigators, which was winding down at the time. Still a fun documentary. With a recognizable narrator replacement, a definite contender for History or Sy-fy.",1357862400,,758,5.264462809917355
4320699,5,B004BVS2C2,"I liked the Mothman Prophecies movie with Richard Gere. I happened upon this in Prime and it caught my eye.  I was worried it may be one of those ""cheap"" looking bad documentaries that you can't even sit through, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The first 30 minutes or so are a bit of history involving dealings between a Native American war chief and the white settlers/soldiers who ultimately wronged him, thus leading to a theory by some that the modern day area in West Virginia known as Point Pleasant is cursed.  Having only seen the Hollywood movie and never having actually looked any further into the Mothman legend, this was all new information to me.

After that beginning setup, the movie goes more into parts of the legend I and anyone who saw the other movie would more easily recognize.  This is where I really started to get interested and entertained. It does have many interviews with locals and paranormal investigators and the like, but I did find the historians and authors to be believable and credible, save maybe the 2 paranormal investigator brothers- you'll see. Anyway, it turns out, as is the case with many Hollywood movies,that indeed there was alot of artistic interpretation used in making the scifi movie The Mothman Prophecies.  That movie takes place in modern day times and while interesting- the character of ""Indrid Cold"" being the most creepy in my opinion, there are alot of subtle differences between the movie and the doc- you'll see the actual man who interacted- alot- with this strange Indrid Cold (just the description and recreation they use of this ""guy"" were fascinating to me. The locals tell of how ""men in black"" would show up at the homes of those who claimed to have seen the Mothman and basically threaten them into silence. Supposedly, these people were quite strange in their own ways too- mannerisms, driving very old yet pristine cars, etc.  I think they based Laura Linney's cop character in the film on a reporter who did many stories on the happenings in Point Pleasant and ultimately gained many locals' trust.  She too had a run in with Indrid Cold- or so they say.

Bottom line- if you enjoyed The Mothman Prophecies or enjoy sci fi type mysteries and legends, I think you will find this entertaining. I walked away thinking to myself, ""Why did I never think to look up Mothman online?  I see now that there is much more to the story than just what was depicted in the Richard Gere movie.  Is it true?  I don't know, but the people that lived it (it all happened in the span of exactly 13 months) sure do. So if you have the time, and get past the first 30 minutes(which are not bad,I just like the MM, Indrid Cole, men in black stuff better) to when it really starts to delve into the ""strange and unusual true story"" type of stuff, then I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  It's free with Prime, so what can it hurt?  I guess if you don't have Prime, then I'd still say go ahead and watch it if you don't know all the history and enjoyed the other movie.  If scifi is not your thing, skip it. I would have paid to rent this. Definitely. As a matter of fact, I'm going to go and Google the Mothman legend right now.  Enjoy.",1344384000,,3194,4.547993019197207
4320700,4,B004BVS2C2,"Eyes Of The Mothman succeeds magnificently as a work of investigative reporting and a speculative docudrama. Prior to this film, the most interesting take on the whole Mothman mythos was by the late psi writer, John Keel, whose book, The Mothman Prophecies, was the basis for the Gere film. But this film is far more detailed and comprehensive, and roundly debunks some of the longstanding claims made in Keel's book, as Keel was seemingly hoaxed on multiple occasions, and his book riddled with other inconsistencies. This film will likely become the definitive resource on the Mothman legend for the foreseeable future, for it does not condescend, claim to know what was real and what was not, and has no agenda- political, spiritual, philosophic, nor otherwise: it does not push the psi aspects of the legendry, nor does it ignore them. This is, easily, the finest piece of journalism I have ever read or seen, as it pertains to things deemed paranormal, for it eschews the classic Von Danikenism of earlier psi documentaries, and focuses on history, people, and how they were affected by the oddities, rather than just focusing on the oddities. In this way, Eyes Of The Mothman is not only a great documentary film, but an innovative one.

One of the most admirable elements of this film is that it is entirely objective in its presentation of the material. The makers of this film let the eye witnesses speak for themselves, thereby not insulting the intelligence of those that witnessed the events or those watching the film. You are allowed to judge the events entirely for yourself. That is a highly admirable quality in a documentary.

From an aesthetic point of view, this documentary is also well-done. The cinematography masterfully displays the rugged beauty of West Virginia. You can tell that this film was not hastily thrown together. A lot of time, energy, and thought went into the film.

I didn't have a problem with those, but I am really surprised that no one mentioned the over abundance of the ""who is speaking banners"", as I call them.  How many times do we need to see that banner flash underneath the same person's face with the moth fluttering around telling us who they are?  It got to the point that it was giving me anxiety and distracting me from what the person was saying.  Once is enough!  We don't need to see their name every time they speak, especially when you are showing the same person about 30 times.  It kind of ruined the experience for me.  Just too distracting and unnecessary.  Other than this annoying technicality, it was a very thorough recounting of the Mothman myth.  Great shots of the town in the beginning, it really draw you into the show.  If you are at all interested in the Mothman phenomenon, you will want to see this DVD.",1304035200,2,1059,4.492146596858639
4320707,1,B004BVS2C2,"This doc is such a blatant hack job. It's terribly edited and is at least an hour longer than it could possibly need to be. The narrator has an irritating speech impediment. Sheriously, if you're having shuch a hard time shpeaking properly, hire shomeone else for the narration. The first half is especially abysmal, with no focus as it wanders all over the place: the curse of a Native American chief, the Jersey Devil, pterodactyls?! The eyewitness accounts are given by the most credulous backwoods rednecks you could ever hope to meet. Where an academic has been interviewed, it is painfully obvious that the director has butchered the comments and placed select quotes out of context to support paranormal theories, even when it's clear that the academic's point was the exact opposite.

The movie's ineptitude is just icing on the cake, and the cake, of course, is the fact that the whole Mothman schtick is a big joke. There are a handful of documented sightings. From there, witnesses and authors eager for sensation layered on heaps of UFO sightings, Men in Black, weird otherdimensional beings, prophecies of disaster, eventually trying to link it all to the bridge collapse. It's all hooey that sprang entirely from the imagination of John Keel. Go watch the Mothman Prophecies instead. It's a great, scary movie that makes no bones about what it really is: a work of fiction.",1304035200,4,1387,4.927350427350428
4320708,5,B004BVS2C2,"I liked this DVD much better than the movie Mothman Prophecies because it's videotaped in the actual area in which all of this story took place and I also lived in Pt Pleasant in the early 1960's. My parents use to take my sister and I fishing at the TNT area as it was called, this was before the sightings began. The Silver Bridge we crossed it many times the last time being on Tuesday night Dec. 12,1967 to get a Christmas tree across the river in Ohio and it collapsed on Friday Dec. 15,1967 during rush hour traffic in which 46 people lost their lives! So thats why this video documentary is special to me.",1303344000,11,612,4.2844827586206895

I must say that it remains one of my favorite books I've ever read and this story has fascinated me and snowballed into learning some very, very interesting things. The things that this book (and movie) has lead me into have changed my life forever. If anything... It WILL get you thinking and if it does that then read the book because you will never be the same.",1482105600,2,488,4.49438202247191
