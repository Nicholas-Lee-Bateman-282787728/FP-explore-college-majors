2670504,5,B000JFY05W,"I've been waiting so long for this DVD! Hilary and Haylie Duff are so marvellous! Each one of them is cute - but together they are unbeatable.

""Material Girls"" is my favorit film of the year 2006. It's a funny and nice film for the whole family. Every fan of Hilary and Haylie Duff simply must see that film!

In a word: Hilary and Haylie Duff rocks!!!",1166400000,3,353,4.253731343283582
2670505,5,B000JFY05W,"I am so happy to finally know a release date for this! I went and saw the movie on opening weekend, I was able to talk my dad into going, which was  cool because we used to have a tradition of going to the movies before school started, but we hadn't gone in so long, and actually, most of the movies I like are movies I would not feel comfortable seeing with my dad. This is a family friendly movie, and I think anyone with an open mind would enjoy it. I loved it, I am a 23 year old Hilary Duff fan, and proud, but even my dad enjoyed the movie, then again he always preferred ""clean"" movies to some of the more mainstream inappropriate films. This movie will definitely be in my collection, and when I have kids I will very comfortably watch it with them.

Overall, great movie, funny, inspiring.",1160524800,21,798,4.209150326797386

Not sure about the pg rating...there's an s-word and some pretty sexual stuff, but it's not too inappropriate. Funny and enjoyable the first time, kinda funny and pretty interesting the second, okay the third. Not something I'll be watching over and over again. A good sleepover chick flick for $3. Worth the money, but you might wanna watch it first before letting little girls see.

2670524,5,B000JFY05W,"This movie is hilarious at times. I've watched this movie a few times since it came out. The name Material Girls is the right title for this movie. I'm a huge fan of Hilary Duff's work, and you can see her growth in this movie. It's also great that her sister Haylie is in this movie with her. It wouldn't be Material Girls without the Duff sisters. I think Hilary, and Haylie make a great team in the movie. This movie shows you the ups, and downs to having it all in life, and what can change in a matter of seconds. Don't take life, and what you've for grated, because it could be gone in a flash. You should be grateful for what you have in life, because you couldn't have it at all, because there is a lot of people with nothing in life. In this movie business can be bad sometimes.

2670525,3,B000JFY05W,"Hilary and Haylie Duff play the girls who have everything until Dad's cosmetic company is ruined by a scandal. I once liked director Martha Coolidge for her inventive independent films like Valley Girl and Real Genius, but she's directing a film that's just too safe. The girls lose their mansion to a fire, but stay at the maid's house where she still treats them like royalty. In every crisis a prince charming turns up to help them solve the case and find the files to clear their company's name before a rival takes it over. It makes me wish I could watch Life Stinks again and admire Mel Brooks for showing his main character take a bet that he can live homeless in the streets for a year.. not at the maid's house! He had some guts.  The critics hated it but I still liked the film. (For Coolidge fans, Joanie Baron has a part like one in all her other teen comedies)",1290211200,,873,4.355828220858895
2670526,2,B000JFY05W,"Ladies, young girls, let me point out of a particular movie: it's called ""A Little Princess"".  Taken away the sister aspect, it's essentially the same premise as ""Material Girls"": it's about a rich girl who had it all, but unfortunate circumstances left her to become poor and thus she has to rely on the people she don't know and her own strength to go through the hardship of life.  It's a beautifully-told story with a wonderful cast of gals and heartfelt direction (followed by a contrived ending).  Sure, it's a cast of children, and it's a period piece where Coco was before Chanel and the only known pop song was 'The Star-Spangle Banner', but should anyone really care about the modern stuff?  Should we have to watch girls obsessed with their own fashion sense, catering to their own vanity, and keep tabs on the latest gadgets to make IMs?  Shouldn't the heart be the important factor to a story?

That's what ""Material Girls"" lack: a heart. And common sense, since the Duff sisters spend most of their screen-time saying the most asinine lines I've ever heard (""I'm not interested in Spice Girls.  I don't listen to Classic Rock"") while watching them try to do commoner's things for laughs.  Yea, I know they're suppose to be this clueless as a form of parody, but at least the movie could make them interesting enough to be more than total jokes.  Plus, they don't really develop as characters; they were being catty, materialistic, pompous dramaqueens in the beginning, and they still are in the end.  It's insufferable to watch, and yet it is a step up from ""New York Minute"" in a couple of notices.  It at least has love interests with have SOME kind of personality; at least Haylie Duff's character ends up with a dude that's sorta average-looking than the typical hunk.  But really, nothing else about this movie is substantial, and if Brett Spiner's performance tells me anything, it's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Data-with-a-emotions-chip/dp/B0002HDOB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Data with a emotions chip</a>&nbsp;ALWAYS leads to disaster.",1280448000,,2106,5.179941002949852

2670534,1,B000JFY05W,"I really wanted to like this movie because I think the Duff sisters are cute and actually have some potential.  This movie has nothing about it to offer additional points to that train of thought.  Hilary and Hayley are two spoiled brats who lose all their money, then get it back--an obvious parody of the ditzola factor the Hilton sisters live for real.  About as painful, stupid and empty as My Date with the President's Daughter (UGH!), the only redeeming thing about this vapid little teen chick flick is Anjelica Houston.  For good teen flicks that are thoroughly enjoyable, I highly recommend 10 Things I Hate About You and the old 80s classic hit, John Hughes' Sixteen Candles.  Where this movie is concerned, I wouldn't recommend it to your dog's fleas.",1176508800,3,762,4.786259541984733
2670535,2,B000JFY05W,"While I'm not a teen anymore, I still like to watch the occasional movie in this 'genre' (ones that appeal to the tween market) and I do normally like Hilary Duff but this was NOT GOOD.

Hilary was OK in this, but her sister was annoying.  There were the odd funny moments here and there.  The plot was OK (two rich kids lose their money and become broke, yet bounce back into riches again).  It was mostly unbelievable, yet kind of cute if you are of the age that this was intended for.  I think kids would like this, but I found it to be only average.",1176422400,,553,4.130841121495327

It was still a cute movie.  Suggest you watch, but don't buy.",1176076800,4,269,4.469387755102041
2670537,3,B000JFY05W,"3 stars for effort.

This ALMOST was a good movie. I thought for sure it would be good because usually riches to rags stories are. (Just my luck"" was cute, I thought.)

This went nowhere, then DIED in the middle.

Although the IDEA was good, the story flopped, and this is why.

Whoever edited it did a bad job. It was choppy, and a lot of it seemed FORCED.Certain scenes seemed totally out of synch.

ALSO, It was more Haylie's debut film, and Hillary was sort of just thrown in there...and truth is, I really don't care for Haylie Duff.

But all stars try getting thier sisters in, I guess.

Britney did it with Jamie Lynn, Lindsay Lohan is trying to get her sis Ali in, and so on...

Anyway, had there been better editing, and the focus wasn't so much on Haylie, it could have been a good movie. The IDEA was good, but that is where it ended.

Maybe worth a rental but not a buy.",1174694400,6,882,4.2023809523809526
2670538,3,B000JFY05W,I bought this for my teenage girls and was hoping for a better story line but this movie was ?  I don't even know the word to use but the Material Girls seemed pretty silly and they do not have high goals set for themselves.  At first it was all about money and they somewhat learned a lesson when that money disappeared temporarily but I think the idea of finding happiness without money could have been handled better.  I would not watch this movie again.,1172102400,2,457,4.352941176470588
2670539,5,B000JFY05W,I like this movie because Hilary and Halie duff work good together. I also think that it was a great movie in the sence that sometimes the rich don't always get there way once the rich becomes poor. If you like challenges and romance as well as comedy and sitting with your family. Then this is the film for you. I loved it and I think you will too!,1170028800,,349,4.072463768115942
2670540,3,B000JFY05W,"if you wanted, you could probably pick out a 100 things wrong with this film. or you can just sit back and enjoy it's cheesiness & stupidity! the acting is fine, Hilary is showing some growth as an actress but her fans are mostly little girls meaning she is stuck making these kind of PG rated films for a while so it'll be hard for her to ever showcase her full potential until she gets away from that public. Haylie is a fine cast as well! I think this film is similar to Legally Blonde in ways, you're not supposed to take anything seriously here. though they lack the charisma of Reese Witherspoon, take it on its own and there's element to enjoy with this film! it's entertaining, light-hearted and Hil even gets to be sexy for once! so yah, I'd say it's a good film if you just want to relax & take your mind off of things for a bit! but don't expect much from it.",1168732800,,870,4.184523809523809
2670541,4,B000JFY05W,"I really liked this movie, Hilary and Haylie are great in it!  I don't understand what the reviewers were thinking (with their lower reviews), it's a comedy about two sisters going from riches to rags overnight and kind of learning how to deal with things.

2670542,2,B000JFY05W,"Starts out with a horrible version of the song Material Girl and gets worse and worse.  Lame acting, very lame, nothing is believable, especially the ending which didn't even make sense to me, so how could the two clutzes figure it out?  This movie was a parody of paris hilton's life I assumed.  In the extras the two sisters talked about making the movie fun and zany, but it wasn't at all--let's go people, how hard can it be to make a funny crazy movie - especialy with your own sister.  OH well, it's worth a rent only to laugh hysterically at the bad acting and plot.",1167868800,,573,4.327102803738318
2670543,1,B000JFY05W,"I am a mother of two young girls, therefore, I really appreciate that there are films out there that are suitable for young girls without being cartoons.  We have several Hilary Duff movies in our home, and her CD's for my oldest daughter.  I previewed this movie prior to showing it to my children.  My children did not get the opportunity.  This was by far, the worst Duff movie made.  The acting is more like high school or junior high stage acting, the plot was completely predictable.  Most Duff movies have the ability to give my daughters a message or an aspiration.  I would recommend that the sisters separate their careers.  Hilary, you are better on your own.",1167091200,6,670,4.61864406779661
2670544,2,B000JFY05W,"Wow, sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff co-starring together in the `06 film `Material Girls' [let me catch my breath]! I can almost see their agent shopping this one to MGM. Hilary's a pretty hot commodity right now with a hit television show under her belt and movies galore and Haylie was in that big hit `Napoleon Dynamite.' What could be more perfect?

A lot of things I think. Yes the Duff's are attractive, that I'll admit, but this film is sooo predictable, and clich, spoiled rich kids go from mega wealth, to dirt poor, to wealth again. Gee.. how original is that? I have to wonder why the girls even bothered. The only plausible answer is the Olson twins must have been unavailible.

So, it is satisfactory.  For the acting, this is the best part.  It is because Hilary Duff and Haylie Duff really shine in this movie.  I also think that they are absolutely fitting the roles of Tanzie Marchetta and Ava Marchetta.  For the direction, they are quite logical.  For the visuals, it is perfect.  It is because for the DVD, this movie is made with 2:40.1 widescreen formats, which is a good surprise for me.  Therefore, it is always a good visual effect to see in this kind of widescreen version.  For the music and sound effects, they are good as well.

Heiresses to a family cosmetic fortune.  Who pretty much lose everything in a scandel involving  the company.  They fight back even though they pretty much don't have any skills of their own.
