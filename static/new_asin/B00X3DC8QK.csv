7156694,5,B00X3DC8QK,"I'm so happy these movies are finally available on DVD!

Having Wonderful Crime is a wonderful screwball comedy from 1945. It stars the beautiful actress Carole Landis in one of her best performances. She plays a ditzy newlywed who gets caught up trying to solve a crime on her honeymoon. There are lots of laughs and the entire cast is superb - Pat O'Brien, George Murphy, and Chili Williams (known as the polka-dot girl). If you're a Carole Landis fan you will love Having Wonderful Crime.

Mrs. O'Malley and Mr. Malone is a fun little film too with a completely different cast :-) Marjorie Main gives a great performance :-)",1432425600,12,627,4.6909090909090905
8714900,5,B00X3DC8QK,"First, re the DVD-R thing, yes it is apparently a DVD-R.  However, the video and audio are perfect, I watched parts of ""Mrs. O'Malley and Mr. Malone (and will watch the whole thing later), and watched all of ""Having Wonderful Crime,"" no problems whatsoever.  As for the movies themselves, ""Having Wonderful Crime"" was extremely enjoyable.  It says based on a ""story"" by Craig Rice -- in fact, it's based on one of her (yes, she's a female) comic detective novels about Chicago lawyer John J. Malone and his two madcap friends, rich Helene and her boyfriend and eventual husband Jake.  There's a mysterious murder and a solution, and lots of fast talk and fast action.  I thought Carole Landis was very good as Helene and Pat O'Brien was entertaining and convincing as lawyer Malone.  One thing I found strange, they renamed Malone ""Michael"" instead of ""John,"" but I guess it didn't matter.  I highly recommend it (and you might want to check out some of the Craig Rice novels, too).  I've already watched ""Mrs. O'Malley and Mr. Malone"" numerous times, it's one of my favorites.  Other than the J. J. Malone lawyer character, it bears no real relation to the Craig Rice books, but it's a great movie, with Marjorie Main (who of course was ""Ma Kettle"") as a Ma Kettle-type character who wins a trip to New York City, and on the train finds murder and lawyer Malone (played hilariously by James Whitmore) and lots of laughs.  By the way, this was based on a story by Craig Rice and Stuart Palmer, who wrote ""The Penguin Pool Murder.""  So, 5 stars for both of these, and for the DVD as well.",1516406400,3,1587,4.592198581560283
