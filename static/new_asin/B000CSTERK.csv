2473383,5,B000CSTERK,"I bought this DVD primarily for my children (ages 6 and 4) they love it and have watched it many times already. I too have enjoyed it and found it helpful, even with the basic graphics and slight drawbacks it is highly commendable and I would recommend it wholehearedly.

Bunyans classic goes on and on!

God Bless

2473384,5,B000CSTERK,"I have read the children's version of this classic story with my Sunday School kids (5th graders) and I was excited to see the DVD animated version.  To my disappointment, I thought that the movie was a bit dry and the animation was subpar (but then again, this is not Disney or Pixar).

I was a bit reluctant to share this movie with my new Sunday School class(3rd graders) because I thought that the children would be bored out of their minds.  However, I truly believe that the message in this classic story adopted from Bunyan's original work is timeless, and can serve as a valuable teaching tool for both adults and children.

I prefaced the screening of the movie with a warning that it may become boring at times, but I encouraged the children to pay close attention to the story.  To my surprise, they LOVED it!  They really got into the story, asking questions about the characters and places.  They were really disappointed when I had to stop the film because our class time had run out.  I am definitely looking forward to completing the movie with them and discussing a Christian's pilgrimage through life.

This is a definite must for any Sunday School teacher and Christian family.  As long as my kids enjoyed it, I couldn't be more pleased. A++++++++++",1174953600,27,1268,4.645739910313901
2473385,4,B000CSTERK,"I was very impressed with this video and found it very helpful.  It covers some important topics and delivers some important truths.  It clearly explains some key questions about faith.  It isn't made by a big studio, but clearly by someone who is a talented animator and who wants to use his talents to communicate something worthwhile. It has some beautiful scenes, some interesting characters, and very worthwhile dialog.",1165276800,6,424,5.115942028985507
2473386,1,B000CSTERK,"The Pilgrim's Progress is one of my favorite books. I was excited to see an animated version, and hopeful to share it with the youth group that I lead at church.  I decided to preview the movie at home before showing it to a group of pre-teens. Yes, the message is excellent.  However, the voice-over acting is boring and bland, using the same actor for many characters.  The computer animation looks much like a video game from the late 90's.  When Christian is met by Apollyon, the animation reminded me of meeting a ""boss"" while playing Zelda. I was also disappointed that there wasn't any closed-captioning or subtitle option in the DVD menu.  The idea to produce an animated version of this was good. I regret that it didn't come close to standards that would highlight Bunyan's writing. There must be plenty of Christian actors, directors, and artists in this world who would surely like to put our pilgrim, Christian, on the adventure map with Frodo Baggins, or our friends in Narnia!",1147219200,13,991,4.738372093023256
2473387,5,B000CSTERK,This movie is now one of my favorites! So informative and meaningful and despite it being animation it touched me with it's message! A great revival for a Christian and a great help for a non-believer.,1137715200,11,201,4.611111111111111
2473408,4,B000CSTERK,"My children 6,4 & 21/2 love it. They watched it back to back when it arrived. I found the graphics ok, but the message was another opportunity for us to talk and share about it.",1396310400,,177,4.085714285714285
2473409,5,B000CSTERK,"some of the graphics  are weird but interesting and illustrate the spiritual concepts as  John Bunyan  intended.  However, in my view, the best part is the script.  It has a depth that can be grasped by kids while holding the theological interest of  the parents.",1396137600,,263,4.733333333333333
2473410,5,B000CSTERK,"Great dvd,fast shipping,great price. This is one of the best pilgrims progress dvd's out there. I love it and so do my kids.",1393372800,,124,4.434782608695652
2473411,5,B000CSTERK,My grandchildren enjoy and ask to see this again and again.  Very nicely put together for them to understand a pilgrim's journey in life.,1393286400,,137,4.708333333333333
2473412,4,B000CSTERK,"Pilgrim's progress is a long story and somewhat hard to follow the first time through. I played this movie a couple of times and reviewed it each time with questions. Too long and monotonus for under 7 years old. I also purchased a ""real person"" version which was way too much for children under 11 years old. Comparing the two, this DVD was just right.  I would recommend it for ages 7-11.",1387843200,,390,4.416666666666667
2473413,5,B000CSTERK,This cartoon movie in my opinion was better than the real on screen movies. It really touched me and my children. I think all Christian children should watch this. This is also a great witnessing tool. Love it!!!,1383350400,,212,4.605263157894737
2473414,5,B000CSTERK,This  movie is for kids and adults alike.  The story is awesome and goes with the book for the children.  I would love to see a Christian group really get a better quality of animation but the story holds the kids attention and gets each of us adults a heart check with GOD each time we see it.,1382486400,,294,4.0344827586206895
2473415,2,B000CSTERK,"Seemed to take longer than usual, but I was disappointed with the film, wish I hadn't purchased it,

2473416,5,B000CSTERK,"This is, I think, the best version of this story. Very colorful and vibrant surroundings. It's an awesome story about our Christian walk and what we encounter and indure. Very well done. I recommend this movie!",1375401600,,210,4.861111111111111
2473417,5,B000CSTERK,Animation and voice characters are great.  I wish them the best in making future animations. Arrived in great condition and before specified time.,1371340800,,146,5.3478260869565215
2473433,4,B000CSTERK,The movie is kid approved with mild scary parts during the battle scenes depicted in John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. The movie is fairly true to the book with some missing adventures since the book is too long for the movie to contain everything. Some of the more implied parts of the book are explained more fully so that children and young Christians can understand the hidden meanings within the story. Some of the scary parts of the book are likewise implied in the movie to make it more kid friendly. I highly recommend the movie to anyone looking for a solid Christian cartoon based on a classic piece of Christian literature for the kids that even adults will enjoy.,1370476800,,675,4.680672268907563
2473434,5,B000CSTERK,"I have to say that when I initially saw the illustration on the cover and potentially what looked like a poorly animated movie, I was convinced that this would hold no interest for my 5 year old daughter. Boy was I wrong, she loves it and asks to watch this everyday!

I must admit that I have grown pretty fond of this production as well. Despite the low budget and rather stiff animation and voice overs, this movie has a charm all its own. My daughter has been asking me questions about God and Jesus and actually understands the premise of this allegory far better than I could explain it to her. I highly recommend this DVD! The Pilgrims Progress along with Grace Abounding are my favourite Bunyan books and I am so happy to be able to shere this with my child :)",1365984000,,768,4.333333333333333
2473435,5,B000CSTERK,"While the animation wasn't quite cutting edge, the story is timeless.  The representaion of the characters as true to the book makes this an excellent purchase for both young and old.",1360713600,,183,4.903225806451613
2473436,5,B000CSTERK,"Do you have a burden on your back?

How can one be saved? Saved from what? Do you like living your life your way?  Have you found your ways to be hard?  Did you know that all have sinned and have fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23).  Did you know the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23)?  Would you like to know if you died today how to get into heaven?

Believe unto the Gospel ""Good News"" of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and you shall be saved!""  By faith ALONE that He is who He said He is: I and the Father are One (John 10:30).  Jesus is God, that He died for your sins and rose again defeating death. It is by Christ ALONE one can be saved (John 14:6).

2473437,5,B000CSTERK,Great perspective on the Christian faith geared for kids so they understand. A big hit in our library since it gets checked out all the time.,1358208000,,141,4.461538461538462
2473438,5,B000CSTERK,"I am delighted to have this product.  As another reviewer mentioned, this production *contains the Gospel,* and it does so with great clarity and faithfulness both to Bunyan's work and, more importantly, to the Scriptures themselves.  None of the poetic license taken is a problem for me; one caveat is that it does depict Jesus in a few scenes--I consider that a 2nd Commandment issue, but I recognize most people would be fine with it.  All three of my kids like the DVD.  We've had it for a few years now.  Our 9 year old still enjoys it after countless viewings, and, to my delight, our 5 year old girl asks for it all the time.  Yes, we recognize it is the product of a small budget, and it competes in our house against all the other films Pixar has to offer, but this one ranks right up there in entertainment value.  When you add in the well-articulated Gospel presentation, it ranks right at the top.",1346457600,,909,4.4397590361445785
2473439,5,B000CSTERK,"As usual I had no problems with receiving the DVD in the mail. The DVD was very entertaining and also the story was shown with a more modern situation for children to relate to. With my grandson we read the book and then find out if there is a movie of that same book. Then we watch the movie. If the story seems too hard to understand, sometimes we'll find the movie and then read the book. Then watch the movie again. That's another reason I like to purchase the movies.",1326067200,,472,4.197802197802198
2473440,5,B000CSTERK,"I have used this DVD for the past 2 or 3 years for my fifth grade class.  We typically read excerpts of this from our Reading Curriculum from Bob Jones University...and getting to watch this definitely stands out for our week spent on Pilgrim's Progress! They all love the arrows from Beelzebub part the best! Great graphics there!  The dvd does deviate from the original version where Faithful is a guy, but in this version depicted as a girl.  Thanks for the awesome video!",1296432000,2,475,4.630952380952381
2473441,3,B000CSTERK,"My kids, 5,7 & 9 yrs,  read The Pilgrims Progress book first and then watched this DVD. The were a little disappointed. The animation is a little dated and the acting/reading was a bit too dead pan for their taste. They seemed to just be reading their lines and not acting them out.

The movie follows the book closely but my kids were a little sad that it only included Christian's journey and not Christiana's as well. I had to explain that the movie was already an hour long and that it would take that long again and some to tell the other story as well.

Overall It was fine. My kids watched the whole thing but I don't think it will become a favorite. I was hoping for more but got about what I thought it would be. Perhaps I will try a live action version instead.",1295740800,,771,4.195945945945946
2473442,5,B000CSTERK,The video is a great complement to the book which I read to my children and now my grandchildren. Thanks for you service.,1286496000,,121,4.304347826086956
2473453,5,B000CSTERK,Purchased this for my 4 yro son. Great movie. Me and my wife love it! There are 2 somewhat scary parts for younger kids but you can easily fast foward these 2 scenes. I am amazed of the sound doctrine that is being taught in this animation. Adults can learn from this. I pray more Christian animations and movies would have at least half the sound doctrine that this one has. Congrats to Scott Cawthon on a great job. I hope the rest of his animations are like this.,1284336000,2,466,4.247191011235955
2473454,5,B000CSTERK,"I have recently gone through the felt board set and lessons by Betty Lukens on the broad path and the narrow path. I great christian building series. I want my kids to be really solid Little Christians. In our lessons I came across the children's book of Pilgrim's Progress and I spent a Sunday reading it to my kids. They LOVED it and I had seen this DVD so I bought it also. I previewed it at home and was very pleasently surprised. My 7 and 8 year old daughters watched it with me and demanded to watch it again as soon as it ended the first time. We really enjoyed it. I gave it a 5 Star rating because all of my children church kids loved it. It took two Sundays to watch the whole movie. When we didn't get to finish it the first Sunday (because parents were arriving to take them home) the kids were begging to finish it and wanted their parents to come back when it was over. I have about 20 kids in Children's Church and they come to me from the nursery at age 3 and the oldest children are in 5th grade. So I have a very wide age group but all of them loved the movie.
Now here is the only part that I was not happy with. I have taught my kids over and over that at the narrow gate only one person can go through at a time. That you can't push, pull, rope whatever anyone else through. And nobody, mom, dad, grandparents, siblings can push, pull etc you through. Each person has to make that decision themselves and go through by themselves. When Christian gets to the gate he does ask Goodwill if he can enter and why he wants to enter. Good so far but then Goodwill opens the gate for Christian and yanks him in. What?!!! I paused the movie and asked my kids what was wrong. Actually I didn't really have to ask because they all knew and were shocked and not happy about it. I explained that I thought maybe Goodwill saw the firey arrows coming so he was trying to hurry Christian up so he could close the gate and they would be protected. I also told them that the movie was wrong and they agreed. We talked about how this could be confusing to kids who hadn't already learned about the two paths. They agreed and we moved on.
I still love the movie and of course my kids to do. In fact I have made them costumes and we are going to act it our together this Sunday. (Coustumes are just made from pillowcases not real professional but my kids don't care they just love to dress up and act it out. Give it a try.)
I love the story of Pilgrims Progress and have from a child. I highly recommend it to all adults and children. I have bought my kids the childrens version book to take home. What a great tool to send home with kids who don't have Christian parents!
I just bought each of them this DVD too. That is how much I think of this movie and I know God will use it in these children's homes! After all His Word will not come back void.
It's like my pastor says ""Let's get as many hooks in the water as we can and show people the way to Jesus. Our job is to be a disciple and make disciples.""",1273795200,9,3007,4.072512647554806
2473455,5,B000CSTERK,"This is a terrific little computer-animation movie based on Pilgrim's Progress.  My (now) 4-year old son still enjoys it, and so do I.

I have nothing but admiration for Scott Cawthon who, as far as I can tell, created all the animation and voiced all the male characters by himself.  What a labor of love.

There is one part that's a little scary when Christian is doing battle with Apollyon (which, as another reviewer remarked, kind of reminded me of an old video games)...fair warning.
