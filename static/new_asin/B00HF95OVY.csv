8632219,5,B00HF95OVY,"Great workout to strengthen the back and lower back. Kelly demonstrates each move well. Also like the fact that if short on time, there is a shortened version which is also quite good. Like anything, it works only if you do it faithfully. 2-3 times a week.",1465257600,,256,4.468085106382978
8632220,4,B00HF95OVY,"This is a good, hard workout that you feel after but it does not drain you of energy if you are like me and have chronic fatigue. I really felt it tone my legs and abs.",1462406400,,168,3.6944444444444446
8632221,5,B00HF95OVY,"Very good, very different exercises. Will be good for strengthening my back with continued use.  Be careful if your back is already injured.",1439164800,2,140,5.086956521739131

8632224,5,B00HF95OVY,"This is an AMAZING video for those with back problems. I'm recovering from a back strain and this helped me tremendously! Coffey-Meyer does something that I haven't seen in a video before. She does a warm-up and then the main part of the video consists of doing one exercise, then stretch, then another set of the exercise, quick stretch, next exercise, repeat, then long stretches for the cool down. It really helped! The exercises aren't hard and no equipment is need except a yoga mat for comfort. In the video Coffey is big on only doing what you can, for every exercise there is a modification. I'm now no longer suffering from back pain when I sit and my flexibility in my back and hips has really Improved.",1400284800,11,713,4.578125
