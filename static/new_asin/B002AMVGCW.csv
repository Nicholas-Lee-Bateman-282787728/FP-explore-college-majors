3889734,3,B002AMVGCW,"It's a fine show, and the price is reasonable for the amount of material... but these DVDs lack both closed captions AND subtitles!  In this day and age, I don't think this is an ""optional"" feature for DVD producers of anything but the most cheapjack material.  On a high-quality, high-profile, high-price release like this, there's no excuse.",1257811200,16,343,5.0
3889735,3,B002AMVGCW,Consistently entertaining show with four or five outstanding episodes (Gilda!) and a few engaging commentaries. But this set isn't intended for the hearing impaired (no captions) or the frugal. You've waited 20 years to see the series again--why not wait another six months for the price to drop below $60?,1257552000,4,306,5.14
3889736,5,B002AMVGCW,"We are falling over with excitement! We have waited and hoped for years for this set to come out! Now I have scenes playing in my head, like when Garry and Jeff Goldblum got trapped in Jeff's freezer, or when Garry was so proud of himself for buying a gift and also wrapping it all on the same day.
I have an eye-roll for the people complaining about the price. They apparently don't understand quality, or math.",1257033600,3,412,4.363636363636363
3889737,5,B002AMVGCW,"Having just received this set, I have to say I am very happy with it.  There are a good amount of extras and, as always, Shout! has produced the DVDs and packaging well.  The DVD menus are visually interesting but not overdone to the point of distraction as in the case of some sets.  This ground-breaking series was well overdue, and I think most of us who wished it was available in the past are happy to see the entire series released at once.  It's pretty frustrating and often more expensive to wait and purchase single seasons at a time; and often problems occur along the way that slow or prevent season releases when done individually (think Mary Tyler Moore).  To those of us who had a few surviving VHS episodes, the DVD quality is so refreshing to watch!  If you've not ever been exposed to this show, I don't think you'll be disappointed - it stands up remarkably well given how long ago it aired originally.  A little smart shopping will net you a lower price anyway - so take a moment to check prices amongst the top internet retailers.",1256169600,3,1050,4.465968586387435
3889738,5,B002AMVGCW,"A few misconceptions:
(a) first of all, there are 72 episodes, not 62. Not sure if that makes a difference to those waffling on price, but there are 72 so that makes it less than $2 per episode.
(b) $120 would average individual season sets at $30 each, which is hardly unreasonable.

I did get Good Times for a much cheaper price but there are no extra and the packaging is just a pile of discs on top of one another. This packaging looks much better (we'll see for sure on Oct. 20).

If you're that concerned about price, buy it from Amazon.ca. It's $112 Canadian there.",1255651200,8,572,4.336448598130841
3889739,5,B002AMVGCW,"What's the problem here?

Not sure why anyone could think the listed Amazon price is too high.  Here's the facts:

1) This is a 16 disc complete set loaded with brand new extras.

2) It's from Shout! Factory who always produce high quality box sets.

3) It retains all the guest stars and music.  For every guest star that walks into Garry's home, the producers of this set have to negotiate with them or their estate.  This costs a lot of money.  Now they could have gone the inexpensive way and eliminated scenes, certain music, even entire episodes.  But they didn't.

4) It's a landmark cult TV series that probably wouldn't be seeing the light of day if not for the folks at Shout! Factory.

I agree that it is a lot to shell out.  But as a fan who has very fond memories of this blowing my mind 20+ years ago, it's a small price to pay to have the the entire complete series in one big box with Shandling's participation.  This set is certainly a specialty item and not one to appeal to a mainstream audience.  It's aimed at the serious collector of the offbeat and unusual.

With all that in mind I'm looking forward to this set and have no problem shelling out around $100 to show my support for this wonderfully creative show.  Who knows, maybe good sales will encourage Shout! Factory to tackle 'The Complete Larry Sanders Show' next?",1254960000,54,1344,4.44672131147541
3889740,1,B002AMVGCW,"Perhaps the publicly expressed anticipation of seeing ""It's Garry Shandling's Show"" again has made Shandling a little greedy? $120 for 62 episodes? No thanks! It will be on YouTube and other sites as soon as it is released and we can watch for free.",1251417600,7,249,4.681818181818182
3889741,5,B002AMVGCW,"Obviously this isn't out yet, so this review isn't about the set it's about the show. I remember some of Gary Shandling's standup from specials I had watched on late night tv. So when I heard Fox was gonna run episodes of this after Married With Children I figured I'd see what the show was about. He didn't seem like the perfect choice for a show, he was hilarious in standup but I wasn't sure how an actual show would pan out. I didn't have cable at the time so it wasn't until Fox started showing it that I got my first glance. Some people I had heard talk about it, said it was hilarious, while others said they just didn't get it. Gary's humor can be a bit dry at times, but he's usually pretty funny. So I decided to find out for myself. I'm glad I did. The sitcom within a sitcom idea was a bit quirky but worked.  Generally, though if you watched the series week to week you would be rewarded with more running jokes/gags. Stuff casual watchers may not pick up on. The only other series I ever watched that got rid of the fourth wall was the Monkees and they were funny too. But, this show picks up on that idea where it left off and pushed it to the limits without really being over the top. The jokes were great, the actors were all in on the joke, and gave great performances. There really isn't much to dislike by the show. If you are a fan of comedy, I mean a true fan you will at least enjoy this show if not love it. Gary's jokes, like I said can be a bit dry, but they are clever and hit the mark every time. Usually when a joke doesn't hit it's intentional and watching the reactions of a bad joke can be just as funny as the really good jokes. I do not understand why anyone would say at $2 an episode it's not worth it. Not because of the show itself but because tv shows can be overpriced. Seeing as this is four seasons, a complete series with extras, I can't really say the price is all that bad. i remember when tv shows came out on dvd for the first time, i was just glad they did and had paid way higher prices than I would pay today. I love a good deal too, but one can't complain too much for what you are getting for the price. Besides, without this show shows like Seinfeld never would have been dreamed of. It's the clever little twists on the classic sitcom genre that sells this show the most, it was very inventive, and has been imitated in many ways since it went off the air, so much that you might think this show isn't all that original, but it is THE original. I would highly reccomend this set at any price. You'll be laughing so much you won't remember how much you paid for it",1249430400,22,2617,4.101364522417154
3889742,5,B002AMVGCW,Garry was a gifted comedian/actor as well as a skilled writer/producer. That's why I purchased the videos of all his work.,1462665600,,122,4.857142857142857
3889743,3,B002AMVGCW,"I remember this series being much better.  The first season was weak, but the second season so far is an improvement.  Packaging is crap: the disks don't click into in place and the edges of each 'booklet?' arrived shredded and continue to shred  Some discs look damaged on the shiny side but so far they have played without freezing. Suggest buying individual seasons, maybe even starting with the fourth and working backwards to two.  Skip the first season.",1460073600,,459,4.846153846153846
3889744,3,B002AMVGCW,"When you put this against most of the tripe that was on network TV at the time, it's excellent comedy. But it's also basically just ""Late Night With David Letterman"" in sitcom form.  The constant ""breaking of the fourth wall"", the self-awareness and meta-explanations of everything that's going on (""You have to decide now, there's only 15 minutes left in the show"")...all of which is now a bit hackneyed and dated.  I appreciate it for its semi-groundbreaking sensibilities (though, again, I think it was just riffing on what Letterman was doing much better at thet time), but it's not something I'd need for repeat viewings. ""The Larry Sanders Show"" was much better.",1459641600,,668,4.955357142857143

3889748,5,B002AMVGCW,"Garry Shandling was one of the most mature shows ever, and it was a comedy.  Nonetheless, he would 'break character' and approach the camera, explaining the discontinuity or incongruity of some plot point, such as a character magically appearing.  You got the feeling that you were his professional friend, sitting there on the set, and were respected enough to know what was 'hokey' and didn't work and what was clever.
The comedy was dry and clever, the characters always complex and nuanced, not mere stage props for the next script.  We get the feeling that Shandling was playing a real person(in fact, like Seinfeld, he was basically portraying his life as a LA area comedian.)
Some of the shows were brilliant, some merely well-written and amusing.  Over all, you'll see that this was a mature comedy series head and shoulders above anything on now(except those cartoon shows...)",1419120000,,885,5.0

3889754,4,B002AMVGCW,"I remember watching It's Garry Shandling's Show when I was younger, and while I promise you I didn't get all the jokes when I was a kid, I did get two things: one was the theme song.  The theme song, quite honestly, doesn't stop being funny -- in part because there's not a uniform video sequence running under it; Garry's always doing something different while it plays -- and it integrates itself into the show far better than most, as both the show and the song are both so over-the-top post-modern it hurts.  The other was a very memorable joke (to me, anyway) from the episode ""Garry Acts Like a Moron.""  It featured Dave Coulier (I hadn't yet seen Full House when this aired -- I knew him from Nickelodeon's Out of Control and various stand-up comedy shows) as Garry's voice box, doing a spot-on impression as Garry insisted his voice doesn't sound like that.  Quite honestly, I felt it was brilliant.

That was then.  Now, both of those things are still funny to me, but more of the show is, too.  ""You'll get to meet Pete's wife next week.  She wasn't in this episode because we haven't cast her yet.""  Characters in the show will have been watching the show when they're not onscreen.  Garry will narrate to his audience that time has passed in order to make the transition between events.  In an early episode, Garry leaves his apartment and members of the studio audience take the opportunity to hang out in his place, watch his TV and, if I recall correctly, use his shower.  The show's perspective is such a strange one that it can't help but be unforgettable.

The show does date itself a little heavily, but not so much that one can't enjoy the deconstructive nature of a show about people who know they're in a show.",1274486400,4,1732,4.512820512820513
3889755,5,B002AMVGCW,"Sorry, I just wanted to say that... suckers :)  I bought it at a retail store at my local mall - not dodgy at all

3889756,4,B002AMVGCW,"I caught a few fleeting glimpses of this show in reruns on broadcast TV many years ago.  At the time I was avoiding anything that smacked of ""appointment television"" so I never followed it, but things stuck in my mind for years - in particular, I caught the episode where garry turns on his own show on TV (which is live footage of him watching himself watching himself) and quickly proclaims ""It's just a guy watching TV - who wants to watch that?....Oh, that's me!"" - the sheer meta-ness of that stuck with me.  So I welcomed the chance to see the show from the beginning.

These DVDs are superbly produced and packaged, picture and sound are clear and there are interesting extras (though I'd have loved more - where is the 25th Anniversary Special, the bridge to the Larry Sanders show?).

That said, I do think the price is a bit high.  It's a fun show, but not always great - some episodes are kind of flat and I winder if I'll go back and watch many of them a second or third time.  In contrast, I'd gladly pay these prices for Larry Sanders, but that show was much more densely packed and stands up much better to repeated viewings.

Bottom line:  The show is well worth seeing and these DVDs are superbly produced, but as an investment I think it's really for die-hard fans until/unless the price drops.",1263427200,11,1312,4.4375
3889757,2,B002AMVGCW,"& much to my surprise when I put the disk #1 in I realized it wasn't. Decided to watch a couple of episodes (didn't even know this show existed) to see if it was worth keeping. Watched episode #1 & it seems pretty lame, but will watch a couple more just to make sure. Something that is extremely annoying is the loud, wild cheering & laughter from the audience after every Garry Shandling comment. He'll say something that isn't even remotely funny & the crowd will roar with laughter. I'm not sure how much more of that I can listen to. I'm giving it 2 stars, 1 for the nice packaging and another for sort of tricking me into buying it.

Jan. 8th, 2010:

Watched entire disk 1 & quickly realized I've just wasted 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back. To put it bluntly the show is horrible. Not even mildly amusing. Maybe Gary mugging into the camera 15 times a show was groundbreaking in the 80's (the studio audience sure seemed to think so with their constant wild laughter)but it sure seems lame 25 years later.  Now, I'm sure there are people out there that might like this show but then again there are people out there that enjoy ""professional"" wrestling, daytime talk TV shows & spending weekends with their mother-in-law. Typically I am the type of person that never returns anything I buy no matter how useless it turns out to be...but this one is going back. Now I get to monitor my credit card statement for the next 6 months hoping that by some weird chance the dvd seller actually lives up to its promise & refunds my money.

I have no one to blame but myself.

p.s. was this show really popular in the 80's????

OMG!",1262822400,10,1639,4.375
3889758,4,B002AMVGCW,"This is one of my ATF shows ever!!! And keep in mind I watched this show when it was Fox in 1987 and I was 9. Sure, the adult humor I didn't get, but the audience interaction and the 4th Wall that he broke was something I did get. So when the DVD went on sale, I got it for myself as a gift to myself.

What I liked:
-all the episodes in tact; FOX viewers might remember these were edited, and even during it's 2am run on LIFETIME TV, they were chopped up further. But all episodes are shown since not all of em aired unless you had SHOWTIME.
-semi-decent dvd menu, sound quality is just about average, but loved the features and commentary from the cast.
-great dvd case and covers. Good conversation piece if placed on bookshelf
-the shows!!! groundbreaking. My top three are: Garry and Jeff Goldblum, Grant goes to Hollywood, and when they're waiting for the Schumaker baby to arrive. Great comedy, laughs, and you really get to see the inner workings of a great comedian pre-Larry Sanders. Some great one-liners throughout. When it rains, it pours. Morton Salt, we salute you!!!
-EXCEPTIONAL cast and guest stars: Scott Nemes, cameos from Tom Petty and Rob Reiner, and especially seeing Gilda Radner(bittersweet)

Why no fifth star:
-price!!! still a lot at 100-150+. Maybe divided it up into volumes at $20-40 each.
-would've been great is if they had the GS 25th anniversary special(loved that parody special)
-video-wise, straight from TV, nothing had been upgraded or restored.

So for Garry Shandling or Larry Sanders fans, I'd check it out!!! Although a bit expensive, it's worth it to have the entire series!!!",1260230400,10,1621,4.700704225352113
3889759,5,B002AMVGCW,"I read all the reviews and the DVD price was okay with me--I feel this show is well worth it. It is very seldom that I purchase DVDs of movies or television shows, but when I saw that there would be an IGSS complete series box set available, I hesitated for ten minutes, checked that I had the cash, then pre-ordered it. Having made my way through three seasons so far--I hate to do it all at once, it is so worth savoring--I have had absolutely no regrets. Support these artist's efforts and BUY this series.

Not the first person to break the fourth wall, that goes back to early Groucho Marx in films, and probably well before in theatre.  But it's a good example of a program with self-awareness.  Some of it is laugh out loud funny, some is amusing, and there are a few weak episodes in there as well.  But all in all, it's a fun show if you are a fan of Garry Shandling.  Loaded with guest stars like Tom Petty, Rob Reiner, Bruno Kirby, Martin Mull, and on and on.  The series is co-written by Alan Zweibel and more than half of it is directed by Alan Rafkin.

The premise of the show is that Garry is a stand-up comic with his own television show which takes place largely in his apartment and his friends and neighbors drop in, that's about as deep as it goes.  The studio audience is often seen.  Garry drives around the set in his golf cart car.  They do some great parodies of films, the most famous of which was probably The Graduate.  That episode is perfection, at least as relates to this series format.  If you loved Garry Shandling, this is worth owning.

4 stars because it's not for everyone.  My wife finds it silly and predictable and not very funny.  You be the judge.",1465603200,2,1243,4.343478260869565
