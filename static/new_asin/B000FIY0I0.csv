(Italian, 1992) Director: Aurelio Grimaldi. Cast: Francesco Cusimano, Tony Sperandeo, Luigi Maria Burruano, Lucia Sardo. Color. Running time: 86 minutes. Italian with English subtitles. Letterbox format. Unrated.

Set in Sicily in the 1930s, this haunting motion picture chronicles a major turning point in the life of Acl, a feisty 12-year-old sold by his destitute parents to work in the underground sulfur mines of Floristella. Repeatedly beaten by his brutal ""owner"" and tormented by the ever-present specter of rape and sexual abuse, Acl attempts to escape, with dire consequences for both himself and his family. Hailed by film festival critics throughout Europe and Canada, ACL is an uncompromising indictment of an Italy at once beautiful and spiritually desolate. Nudity, strong language, provocative subject matter.",1155859200,3,857,5.74015748031496
