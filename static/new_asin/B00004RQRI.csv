7921419,4,B00004RQRI,"Because of the lack of attention given to this film by both MGM and Cinerama, I was glad to find a DVD release in Amazon Italy. Both my computer and DVD player are zone-free (plus zone-free softwares are available for downloading), so there was no reason not to buy it for not living in Europe, and the more so since until today (January 22, 2016) there has been no release of a restored version. One has to admit though, that beyond the complaint for the division lines of the Cinerama projection, the full experience of inventor Fred Waller's system could only be achieved in a cinema with curved screen (in opposition to Abel Gance's Polyvision, which can be enjoyed on a straight screen). On a straight screen, no matter if the motion picture has been ""smileboxed"" or not, the Cinerama image is always slightly distorted. So get this film, it is as good as when you saw it in 1962. If you had never seen it, be warned of the slight distortion, the two lines and the lack of restoration. But to my surprise the Italian release had an acceptable image quality. I enjoyed it again very much. I did not know there were many other persons who thought this is a better film than ""How the West Was Won"". I also believe this. There is no propaganda here, no patriotic hymns and the script is tighter: instead of the story of three generations (Karl Malden's, Debbie Reynolds' and George Peppard's, in ""HTWWW""), in ""TWWOTBG"" you only have the life of two brothers with three fairy tales inserted in the famous writers' partial biography. If you expect CGIs from George Pal's animation, see something else, and if not, enjoy his puppets and dragon. The cast, on the other hand, includes various cult players, as Beulah Bondi, Terry-Thomas, Martita Hunt, Ian Wolfe and Oscar Homolka; popular comedians as Jim Backus, Buddy Hackett and Arnold Stang; young stars of the 60s as Russ Tamblyn, Yvette Mimieux and Robert Crawford Jr., and good leads: Laurence Harvey, Karlheinz Bhm, Claire Bloom, Barbara Eden and Walter Slezak. Enjoy it again or discover it.",1453334400,,2046,4.717877094972067
