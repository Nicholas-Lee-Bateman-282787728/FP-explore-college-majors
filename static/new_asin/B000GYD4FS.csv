8135212,5,B000GYD4FS,"As another reviewer has commented, I was also a freshman physics student sitting in Prof Goodstein's lectures. Now, later in life, I can understand how valuable his lectures were, and perhaps even more valuable to aspiring students today at the high school or university level. Dr Goodstein certainly can talk, is very articulate, and perhaps this is his own version of ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics,"" which RPF might have done if he had available the video technology back in his day. The production is unparalleled, and nothing, as far as the introductory world of physics is concerned, comes close to this fine, clear-cut production.

  My only complaint, and the reason that I write this review, is that this DVD version is apparently unavailable anywhere. Wouldn't it be an incredibly valuable tool at both the high school and university level? Next question: ""Why is it unavailable?"" I recall this production as part of a joint effort by the Annenberg Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. I doubt that either of these organizations have run out of money to reissue this masterpiece in DVD format. Who owns the rights? Why don't we see more copies of this fine work, even if only to be used for classroom viewing?

  Such a great effort went into this production only to have it shelved, on the web pages of YouTube, or may spottily be purchased as old VHS tapes for posterity. Dr Goodstein and all those involved and responsible for this great production deserve much better than this.

  Again, I beg the question: ""When will we see a reissue of this fine television production in DVD format, if only for the sake of the next generation of physics students?""

  Whoever owns the rights to this fine work, please consider the above question. Thanks!",1426809600,2,1777,4.886666666666667
8135213,5,B000GYD4FS,"The same way CSI makes forensics sexy, The Mechanical Universe helps us mortal folk see the magic in physics.

The genius of this docu series is really its accessibility. It is science as how it should be taught in schools - with the focus less on formulas and measurements, more on the how the unseen forces work to shape our everyday world. Stripped of all the math, atoms, magnetism, energy transference, capacitance and resistance all get to become characters in inter-related stories that kids can both understand. And even enjoy.

I know this because I was one of those kids.

My dad was a freakish documentary buff, and he used to tape every episode of every documentary for my brother and I to watch on weekends when I was 10 or 11. He did this all throughout our school years, but of the hundreds of hours of (mostly NatGeo) documentaries I consumed growing up, The Mechanical Universe is the only one I actually Watched. And twenty years on, it's the only one I've ever tried to purchase online.

Like squeezing lemon juice on invisible ink, it opened my eyes to an entire hidden world. A mirror world where separate and physically distinct objects, actions and reactions in the everyday world were really actually laced together by invisible forces. Decades before Harry Potter and Twillight, the Mechanical Universe taught me how to discern and recognize pure magic.",1283212800,6,1378,4.826271186440678
8135214,5,B000GYD4FS,"I bought the series as a complete 2 box DVD set with not just one volume.  I wouldn't buy this version.  Anyway, Professor Goodstein has a wonderful presentation style.  I was also a freshman at Caltech and sat in his lectures as a student.  He had the same lecture, live, as he does on the videos.  The graphics of James Blinn on this series was excellent for the 1980s.  If somebody would make this series today, I would hope that they would do at least as good if not better with modern compuuter graphics.",1189468800,5,509,4.361702127659575
