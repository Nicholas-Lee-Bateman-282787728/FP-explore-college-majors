8219733,4,B000VSDNEG,"Una buena pelicula peruana que trata de relaciones de distintas parejas, desde una relacion entre adolescente hasta relaciones en decadencia.",1328400000,,141,6.1
8219734,2,B000VSDNEG,"The introduction of this movie looks interesting: Several couples from different ages want to experience sex. The cast features sexy and beautiful girls. However, at the middle of the picture, gets bored as they talked and talked with no action at all. Nothing happens, and at the end, leaves uncertain: What this movie about?

The best: the title song (sung at the end of the movie), and Carolina Cano (who played Alexa in this movie).",1265414400,,436,4.8133333333333335
8219735,2,B000VSDNEG,"This deals with four Peruvian couples dealing with sexual matters.  The problem is that it's not very sexy at all.  It's boring too.
I love the age and gender diversity here.  However, this movie only uses European-phenotyped actors.  I hear that Peru is full of brown people of Inca and other indigenous descent.  This lack of ethnic diversity frustrated me greatly.
""The Big Chill,"" ""Parenthood,"" ""The Woman's Guide to Adultery,"" and countless other films have ensemble casts dealing with everyone's favorite topic.  And they all do it better than this work.
Don't get me wrong: I didn't hate this work.  It was just mediocre in so many ways.",1262217600,,644,4.907407407407407
