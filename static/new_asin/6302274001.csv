Its a great family film and has about everything you could ever ask for in a film of these genera. Wild Hearts Cant Be Broken is about a true story of a girl who goes blind while performing a horse riding stunt but fights to finish her dreams though shes blind. Why they don't make films like this anymore is beyond me. Excellent in every way, a must see if you have a pounding heart. Gabrielle Anwar is the actress who portrays the horse rider Sonora Webster which dose an outstanding performance in her role. This a beautifully well made film that I guarantee you will always remember after watching. Actor Michael Schoeffling is splendid in this film, he does an outstanding performance.

It is a wonderful story set in the early 1900s about a girl and her horse doing diving contests. It is incredibly emotional as the girl is faced with overcoming her disability in order to continue doing what she loves. This movie is filled with drama and romance that is completely safe for the whole family, something very rare in movies now days. That is why I love it so much. I wish there were more movies like this.",1445644800,2,530,4.205882352941177

447317,5,6302274001,"I remember seeing Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken back when it first came out in the early 90s.  But since I recently learned it stars Gabrielle Anwar who Ive been watching for years now as Fiona, Michaels girlfriend on Burn Notice, I had to watch it again.  And I enjoyed it just as much as I remember enjoying it.

Its 1932, and a recently orphaned Sonora (Gabrielle Anwar) is now living with her aunt in Georgia.  Shes a trouble maker, and when her aunt has had enough, she decides to have the state take care of her.

So Sonora runs away and joins a traveling circus act.  While she answers and ad to be ""Doctor"" Carver's (Cliff Robertson) new diving girl, she instead becomes a stable hand.  But she works with Doc's son Al (Michael Schoeffling) to break a wild horse and prove she can be the new diving girl, much to the dismay of egotistical Marie (Kathleen York), the current diving girl.  But what will happen when tragedy strikes?

This movie is based on a true story, which probably means they kept the names and one or two details the same.  Still, it is an inspiring story of a young woman who does not let obstacles stand in her way.  In fact, its easy to root for her to get a happy ever after ending.

Despite the G rating, there are some more serious moments to the film.  They are handled tastefully and artfully, so they shouldnt be too upsetting to young kids.

The film is predictable, especially if you know the big twist to the story that happens about an hour into the film.  And no, I haven't given it away above, but most of the promotion for the movie at the time did.  And, as others have pointed out, it is on the overly sweet and sentimental side of things.  Again, this is Disney in the early 90s.  What were you expecting?

And yet, I found myself drawn into the story.  I didn't remember most of what happened exactly, so I was captivated again. Sonoras spirit is amazing, and its very easy to use her as a guide into the film.  The rest of the characters grow on you as well.  Maybe not Marie, but shes not supposed to.  There are some humorous moments that will make you chuckle if not laugh out loud.

The acting is amazing.  I kept watching Gabrielle for glimpses of Fiona, and occasionally Id see a facial expression or gesture I knew, but for the most part this is a completely different character.  And the rest of the cast is great at letting you get lost in the story that is unfolding.

And so I recommend Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken.  Its still a charming movie that will keep you entertained for the hour and a half running time.",1433721600,,2570,4.331236897274633
447318,4,6302274001,Good movie. Kids enjoyed it.,1433721600,,28,4.8
447319,5,6302274001,"My #1 favorite movie EVER!  I love this movie so much because not only is it a true story and the girl is from Georgia, like me (:o)), but because in my opinion, it delivers on all fronts: romance, adventure, vendettas and the rightings of those vendettas, and triumph over extreme adversity.  It may not have all the special effects pop and flash that most have to have in order to keep our attention, but that's just another thing that makes it great. A must-see if you haven't already, and a timeless classic.",1433548800,,512,4.494623655913978

In one case, a  diving horse who loved his work far too much decided to sneak out of his stall one evening and run up the diving ramp on his own and without hesitation dove fore feet first into the Pacific Ocean where he was last seen by helpless onlookers to have lost his sense of direction and swim away from shore out to sea where he drowned. So sad was this event to the nation's powers that be, shortly afterward the practice of teaching horses to dive for entertainment was swiftly banned throughout the nation. In this book, the team dove straight down into a tub of water. OMG! Dangerous stuff. Oddly, for some reason it does not seem to be published in DVD format.",1402790400,,836,4.318471337579618

The movie wasn't as great or profound as I had remembered. My daughter liked it but wasn't quite as impressed as I was at her age. The first con, in my opinion, was that it is a Disney movie. I hate Disney and everything they do. I read up on the real story after watching the movie and the woman who it is based on said the only true thing in the movie was that she was a diving girl. Everything else is embellished by Disney, as per usual. I would recommend this to other parents for their little girls but maybe read up on the real story first.",1388188800,,675,4.007407407407407

We owned horses (or I should say that SHE owned horses, which is what she always made sure I was aware of despite the fact that we lived in the same house and I saw her horses daily) and she was always riding them.  Until she got married (and even afterwards) she decorated everything in horses and I was forced to endure horse movies ALL THE TIME.  `Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken' was her favorite, and I think most of that was due to the fantasy daydream of a young horse lover who wanted nothing more than to have that free spirit expressed by the film's protagonist; Sonora Webster.

Based on a true story, this Disney film centers on the young Sonora growing up in the 1930's.  The Great Depression has its own weight, but that is least of Sonora's problems.  Orphaned and alone she runs away to join the circus and soon lands herself a nice little act, riding a horse off a diving board into a pool of water.

Young Gabrielle Anwar is aces in the part; a beautiful star turn by a young talent who never got the real break she deserved (why is she still basically unknown if not for that stunning Tango scene in that god-awful `Scent of a Woman'?).  Here she shines so brightly, and next to Reese Witherspoon's equally blessed moment in `Man in the Moon', 1991 was a great year for welcoming young talent.  Sure, this is sappy and nearly everything that Disney is, which is not always realistic in the most practical of terms, but it is beautifully shot and wonderfully acted.  It holds your interest, even if you aren't a horse love.  Yes, despite loathing the idea of watching this movie growing up, I have found that in my adulthood this is a film I can respect and adore for reasons of my own.",1336003200,,1738,4.383177570093458

I love this movie, and not just because of the nostalgia and the horses.  This film makes you feel for the characters, because of the well-written script and the strength of the performances.  My only complaint is not even about the movie itself.  The film is only available in the US in full screen format, so it's not the ""theater"" version.  But this movie is still worth to buy.

I loved horses as a young girl (and still do) but they are only part of the story. The determination of the orphan Sonora Webster, to achieve her dream, is inspiring and extremely entertaining. This is one of those rare films that effectively captures the era that it is set in, and where everything else seems to merge in harmony. The actors, costumes, scenery, music were all excellent, and the sweet love story between Sonora and Al Carver is subtly and gently captured on film, without relying on melodrama. Kathleen York as the snobby, high-society diving girl Marie, provides tremendous comic relief, along with Gabrielle Anwar and Cliff Robertson as the crusty Dr. Carver. I want to see this movie released on DVD and get all the recognition it deserves. I still enjoy watching it and it only grows more watchable with each viewing. It is a great family film and should be shared with everyone. Michael Schoeffling is so handsome as Al, and it's too bad (for us) that he no longer acts. His other great role was as high school hunk Jake Ryan in the teen cult hit ""Sixteen Candles"". Anwar covers up her British accent so convincingly you actually forget that she is British!!!! I can't stop raving about this movie, so I'll leave off with some of my favorite lines. Sonora: ""The bathing suit doesn't fit! I look like a boy!"" Dr. Carver: ""You'll grow into it.""

First off, I found my UK packaging to be pretty unclear. It mentions that this film is about a diver and pictures indicate that this is a movie about swimming. It isn't.

This film is about a horse diver in a circus act- a person leaps onto a horse and they both dive together off of a diving board into a pool. It was released in 1991 by Walt Disney Pictures and stars the beautiful Gabrielle Anwar and Michael Schoeffling (from ""Mermaids""), and is directed by Steve Miner who would go on help produce and direct ""Dawson's Creek"". Based on a true story, it tells of a very determined orphan girl named Sonora who strives to be a horse diver. Along the way, she is on the brink of stardom, until an accident challenges everything she has been working for.

I generally liked this movie. There's no particular human antagonist- the antagonists here are the depression, and life and death itself. Still, it holds your attention.

For my generation, I found the best of Disney's live action movies to be in the 1990s- eg. the Mighty Ducks trilogy, Hocus Pocus, The Three Musketeers, The Jungle Book, Iron Will- the list goes on. Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken got by me, and I have to be honest I probably wouldn't have missed it, but it does a pretty good job.

I never knew the story behind the diving horse, so I was pleased to find this little gem of a video.  A sweet story even if you never saw the diving horse anywhere.  And, the American Humane Association website says that no animals were in harm's way during the production, and it details how they made that happen...an interesting story by itself.

448428,5,6302274001,"Based on a true story, this film is not only entertaining, but as inspirational as they come; a paean to the indomitability of the human spirit in the face of the kind of adversity that would make most of us simply roll over and quit.  It's the story of the kind of challenges life can throw at anyone at random, and then follow up with yet another curve that seemingly takes it beyond the limits of human endurance.  It's a film that should be required viewing for anyone who has ever cried out that the world owes them a living, because the message of ""Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken,"" directed by Steve Miner, is that ""Life"" isn't fair, but when the worst happens you have to pick yourself up by the bootstraps and get on with it; nobody's going to do it for you.  It has something to do with a little thing called ""pride,"" and everything to do with the courage and tenacity it takes for someone to at least try to stand up when even the very hand of Fate seems bent on keeping them down.  There's a very definite lesson to be learned from this story; a lesson of which many living in the world today would be well advised to take note.
In 1932, the Great Depression is on, but times are even more trying for teenager Sonora Webster (Gabrielle Anwar), who after losing her parents is taken in by her aunt, only to be told that because of financial difficulties besetting her own family, Sonora must be given over to the state.  Undaunted, the head-strong Sonora, even at such a tender age takes it upon herself to set the course of her own life.  She packs a bag and runs off to answer an ad placed in the newspaper by a certain Doctor Carver (Cliff Robertson), a showman looking for able young ladies to train as ""diving girls"" for his show.
As part of a traveling circus, Doctor Carver currently has only one diving girl, Marie (Kathleen York); the act entails diving a horse off a forty foot tower into a pool of water.  Carver is skeptical that the young Sonora can do it, but she is adamant and refuses to leave until he gives her a chance.  And so he does; Carver hires her, but as a stable hand.  What he doesn't know is that he's just hired a girl who refuses to give up on something once she's set her mind to it, and when Sonora takes the job, it puts a hay fork in her hand, but her determined eye is on a horse, as well as that forty foot tower looming above that pool of water, beckoning to her, even as a dream borne on the wings of desire.  And in her heart, Sonora knows that it won't be long before she's up there, herself.  Up on the top of the world.
Working from a screenplay by Matt Williams and Oley Sassone, Miner delivers a poignant film that works at the heart strings, but at the same time circumvents any undo sentimentality.  In light of the tragedy that befalls Sonora, this film could easily have played on sympathy and portrayed her as a victim of happenstance.  But to be known as a victim would have been the last thing in the world the real Sonora Webster would have wanted; indeed, she took the lemons life handed her and made the proverbial lemonade, refusing to be a ""victim"" in any sense of the word.  And that is the Sonora that Miner presents here, as he emphasizes the positive aspects of her life and what she accomplished, rather than dwelling upon the negative.  It's a story of pluck and determination, the message of which is delivered in a straightforward manner by Miner, without resorting to any superfluous action or melodrama to sell it.  This is a story that the filmmakers were wise enough to recognize would stand on it's own, without any attempt at dramatic enhancement.  They have taken some license as far as certain dates and specific lengths of time involved, and certain elements are compacted in order to move the story along; but the important thing is, the essential elements of Sonora's life and her incredible achievements are portrayed accurately.
Young Gabrielle Anwar gives a performance in which she perfectly captures Sonora's spirit and the stubbornness that refused to allow her to give in to any and all of the obstacles life put in her path.  Through Anwar's portrayal, we see a girl who overcomes the most heartbreaking situations by always looking forward; a true individual who always sees the glass as half full rather than half empty, and it's Anwar who makes that vital connection with the audience happen.  It's a solid performance, worthy of the character she so ably brings to the screen.
Cliff Robertson gives a memorable performance, as well, as Doctor Carver.  He affects an outwardly ostentatious look and attitude that marks him as a true showman-- he looks like Buffalo Bill in full regalia-- but he indicates an individual of some complexity residing beneath it all.  And there is a reserve to his performance that contradicts his appearance and effectively points up that intricacy of his nature.  Most importantly, Robertson is convincing, and it makes the flamboyant Doctor Carver very real.
The one weakness of the film is in the performance of Michael Schoeffling as Al, Doctor Carver's son.  He has the chiseled features of a GQ model, and though his portrayal is passable, it lacks the depth that would've made it a bit more believable.  He comes across as something of a ""wooden"" Matt Dillon, and while his performance does not necessarily detract from the film, neither does it add anything.  It's a minor consideration, though, that ""Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken"" manages to transcend quite effectively.  In the end, this film is a thoroughly satisfying and emotional experience.",1030838400,73,5578,4.586519114688128

character, Sonora endures a number of life changing events that to the average person may seem exceptionally dramatic and difficult to overcome. Her strong will to have her dream even when it seemed impossible shows a great example to us all!  Vic tory only comes to those of us who are always willing to try one more time. Overall this video shows us good moral examples. There is no sex or violence to speak of. This is also a true story. It shows our children to have dreams and to go after them. Have integrity, faith, hope, love through the bad times as well as the good. Above all, if you want something out of life be willing to work hard for it. Don't let someone else steal your dreams. I firmly believe we can be or do exactly as we dream. God almighty gives us the freedom to create our own destiny by the building of our own character dispite others opinions.

Michael Schoeffling is SPECTACULAR (and VERY cute ;)), in what is his last film before ""disappearing"" from the show biz to PA. Gabrielle Anwar is strong, determined, and beautiful, and even supresses her British accent for this role.  This movie is, very unfortunately, underrated and unappreciated.
