8757533,5,B01E1JVT5K,I watched this series on Crunchyroll a half dozen times and was interested in buying a hardcopy to watch whenever. The item was in great condition and as described. I just wish they had an English dubbed version instead of subtitled.,1466726400,2,233,4.7073170731707314
8757534,5,B01E1JVT5K,This one is a true sleeper. Great story with several flashbacks (so you have to watch the first six episodes closely). You get drawn into the characters  closely and the ending has several twists and turns with an extreme buildup of suspense. The ending was superb and they took the time to tie in final status of all of the characters that surfaced during the story and avoid the choppy conclusion that seem to occur in many other similar DVD's. Really liked this story and am glad I own a copy...it wasn't easy to track copy down! Definitely a 5-Star!,1461974400,2,553,4.53
