8270613,5,B0018Q7K3K,"I am a fan of these types of box sets. The more unique the better. This one is very cool. Though the inner coffin box that the dvds come in don't house them that snug. They seem to easily fall out when you open them. Overall, I love this set. And the movies that are included are a great watch. Not upgraded, so if you want that classic vhs, drive in feel, then these are way cool. Definitely worth it.",1523750400,,402,4.0375
8270614,2,B0018Q7K3K,"These are all edited films that can be bought in complete versions by other distributors who care about their presentations in their correct OAR. Of course the tin coffin is nice, but what would be really nice is if these films were in their unedited form. SISTERS OF DEATH and THE THIRSTY DEAD were both PG-Rated films to begin with, so nothing should be cut from them. These films in this form are all in the Public Domain. If you want completely unedited versions of them (Dario Argento's DEEP RED-THE HATCHET MURDERS runs about 20 minutes longer in its unedited form and Lucio Fulci's HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY was available on many budget DVDs in a version that is 12 minutes shorter than the original version, just like the one in this set; Screenwriter Philip Yordan's BLOODY WEDNESDAY is missing most of the massacre at the end of the film [The film was based on a true story, but in this version, you could never tell]. This version would be Rated PG if re-submitted to the MPAA), you should avoid this set (unless you just have to have the tin coffin) and spend some money on the authorized versions. They are much better films in their unedited glory. And a lot more gore and nudity-filled. You may have trouble finding an uncut version of BLOODY WEDNESDAY, though, since the notorious cheap Simitar Entertainment released a lousy version of the film on VHS and still seems to own the rights to the film. Try to find the unedited Prism Entertainment VHS of the film as it looks 100% better than the version here or on any Simitar DVD release. Good luck and remember being forewarned is being forearmed.",1423353600,7,1609,4.609756097560975
8270615,3,B0018Q7K3K,"Product wise, the tin case is really cool, but when I opened it a holographic eye that was suppose to open and close fell off. Also the DVDs don't actually fit into their holders. On the box it says that The Hatchet Murders (Deep Red) is wide screen but it is not. There are better versions of both Deep Red and House by the Cemetery available, but these versions are servicable. Overall not a bad value for 5 movies but not the best version of any of the films.",1409356800,2,462,4.202247191011236
8270616,3,B0018Q7K3K,"This set is really nice to have ONLY if you want the tin.  Or maybe if you want to introduce a child to horror films.... seriously.  These movies have been edited so that all of them fit a PG 13 rating.  I cannot say for certain if any footage has been officially cut, but it only took watching 1 movie to realize that any nudity is edited with mosaic.

An awesome tin and nice to have sitting on a shelf, but don't throw your other copies of these movies away these have been edited for a young audience.",1404172800,4,505,4.122448979591836
8270617,5,B0018Q7K3K,"This collectable tin & the Death Scream tin make the perfect complementary pair.  Yes the Movies are low budget, cult classic, B to Z rate films.  But how could one NOT like ""House by the Cemetary""?  Or ""The Hatchet Murders""?  If you are a true Horror afficinado, you have to take the good with the bad.  And these are so bad they are good",1400544000,,339,4.234375
8270618,4,B0018Q7K3K,"awesome tin with fold out coffin shape book inside with film details about each film with the discs in each section, the only problem is  i don't know if the films are cut or not  as the back of the coffin says all films are PG13 and also on the write ups it says PG13, obviously they are not PG13 and most likely unrated can you imagine a PG13 version of a lucio fulci film  it would last 10min i think, anyway what ever the rating the tin is pretty awesome and your getting some cracking films and its cheep too so i say buy it,
[...] for great music and  chat",1347753600,12,562,3.9910714285714284
8270619,3,B0018Q7K3K,"These are some good movies and at a great price... however i wish that more details had been availible in the description... the aspect ratio of these films is odd and tiny so on my tv the movie only appears in a box about the size of a sheet paper... luckily i have a better TV in my living room, but forget watching it on any other TV in the house.  Minor issue... but you want to have a LARGE TV inorder to enjoy these movies.",1347235200,3,429,3.988372093023256
8270620,3,B0018Q7K3K,"I believe the five titles of these movies on this set are, ""House by the Cemetary"", ""The Hatchet Murders"", ""Bloody Wednesday"", ""Sisters of Death"", and ""The Thirsty Dead"".  House by the Cemetary is a good horror movie.  A couple and their son live in a house occupied by ghosts and a goulish monster in the cellar.  Not to tell too much, but its quite bloody if you like this sort of thing.

Sisters of Death involve around a cult member being killed by accident, or so they say, at a ceremony of some sort.  Well, imagine what happened to them later on at a home they were invited to come to.  This movie was pretty good to me.  The Hatchet Murders were a bit much for me.  Pretty bloody and if you like slasher type movies, then this ones for you.

I can't report on the other two movies, since I've never seen them.  Sorry.  Since its kind of expensive for this set, try one of Amazon's third party sellers for a cheaper price. This way, not as much money would have been spent if these movies prove to not be to your liking.  Terrific looking coffin tin though.",1296518400,7,1064,4.291457286432161
