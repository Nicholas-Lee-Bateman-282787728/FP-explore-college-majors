3156176,5,B0016GLYQG,"TELEVISTA's THE GOOSE WOMAN has a fine cast that includes a lady who worked opposite Rudolph Valentino and received one of the first-ever Best Actress Oscar nominations (Dresser), the brother of ""America's Sweetheart"" (Pickford) and a gal who was one of three famous acting sisters (Bennett). Directed by Clarence Brown from a story written by Rex Lease (he was a former Yukon Gold Rusher).

This photoplay was inspired by the Hall-Mills murder case, and like the ""Pig Woman"" of that famous trial, our titled lady is a publicity seeker who claims to be witness to a homicide that happened near her farm. Little does opera singer turned fowl tender Mary Holmes realize however that her son may be the killer!

3156178,5,B0016GLYQG,"I had only heard of the title of the ""Goose Woman"" in books about silent films.  The film is wonderfully transfered.  The story pretty well told by the great director Clarence brown. In spite of being a silent film from 1925, it remains a very exciting and poignant film and tale.  The acting of Louise Dresser ""a revelation"" to me. Definitely a truly American film classic that deserves to be better known and seen. I give it a 5 stars for showing once more the incredible entertaining and seducing power of the silent cinema.",1215216000,5,527,4.585106382978723

3156193,5,B0016GLYQG,"They didn't shy away from sordid in 1925! The manicure that got the black dirt out from under her fingernails. The cop who couldn't stand the smell in her house, until he opened the window and smelled the geese outside. She wasn't only dirty; she was filthy -  got it! Gin and human degradation. Phew! I laughed when she hid her gin in the coffee pot that she'd left on the burner and laughed even harder when she demonstrated that she'd learned her lesson. I liked the way the music changed to a hymn when she confronted herself.

She was a powerful actress, that Louise Dresser. I didn't get away from her to race ahead of the story.",1459468800,3,635,4.372881355932203

3156198,4,B0016GLYQG,Wonderful chance to experience one of the classic silents.  Constance Bennett is so young.  The first time I saw Jack Pickford .  I couldn't see how he could be a matinee idol unless the maternal instinct influenced his fans.  I had never heard of Louise Dresser but now I will look for her movies.  Not too much ham acting I usually associate with silents.,1456617600,,357,4.515625

3156221,5,B0016GLYQG,"What an amazing classic. I've been so impressed long after viewing, the music was exceptional, Mr. Dresser's performance was mesmerizing.

3156223,5,B0016GLYQG,"I've never been into reading and experiencing silent movies, but I couldn't stop reading this one. It had many moments of entertaining plot such as the actress who used a plastic baby doll in her act. She tossed it around and to another actor. I could not stop laughing. Then the star of the show Louise Dresser, the famous singer who disappeared twenty years before and said to be dead was wonderful. Her home on the water was shared with a goose, by day and walking and feeding flocks of them. All in all the plot brought her and her son together. Drama of a murder mystery is melded into the scenes and solved at the film's end. Truly entertaining!",1452902400,,651,4.433333333333334
3156224,5,B0016GLYQG,This was quite an old movie and that was its charm. I was so entertained by the actors and plot that after a while I forgot I was reading the dialogue! I would recommend it to anyone who is in the mood for something different.,1433721600,,226,4.044444444444444

3156226,5,B0016GLYQG,"I think this is the first silent film I've watched. Very different art form than talkies and certainly worth the time invested watching it. The beginning was very grainy, but it improved shortly, so don't let that stop you.  Melodramatic and overacting?

3156228,4,B0016GLYQG,"The Goose Woman is blessed with one of the great unsung performances on film - an extraordinary piece of acting by Louise Dresser in the title role - a drunkard ex-opera singer who sees a chance to return to public attention by concocting a story about a nearby murder that inadvertently throws suspicion on her son. When in Sunset Boulevard Gloria Swanson uttered the immortal lines ""They didn't need sound - they had faces then,"" she could have been referring to Ms Dresser. She displays the gamut of emotions without resorting to the histrionics that were so common in silent melodrama. The film predated the Oscars - one can imagine that Ms Dresser would have won the acting trophy hands down had it been awarded in 1925 (when the film was made). That the print is poor is more than compensated by her wonderful performance and the opportunity for film goers to see this lost classic at all.",1345766400,11,895,4.670886075949367
