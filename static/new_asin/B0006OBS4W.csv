8041976,5,B0006OBS4W,"Dispite the reviews given to this movie, I believe it is truly a wonderful expansion to the series. I mean, come on!!!! Is there anything that you can find anywhere that comes to a story like this? Nothing about this movie is cheesy. Sure the budgeting was not what it should have been, but if it did have the proper backing to support it, this would have been unbelievable in the scenes by the art along with the story telling. I mean, people actually like scooby-doo animation.... It is not nearly as complex in story or art as this!!!!!",1412380800,3,539,4.454545454545454
