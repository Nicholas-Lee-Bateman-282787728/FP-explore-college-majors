3525169,5,B001D40U7A,"The Tudors on Blu-Ray is how it should be. Colors are lush. Costumes are resplendent in all their glory. Skin tones are pure. The story as we all know is loosely, sometimes very loosely based on Henry and his exploits. It is fun, historical, intriguing and entertaining. What more do you want in a mini-series. I watched Rome as well and this one may be a bit better.",1293494400,4,367,4.411764705882353
3525170,5,B001D40U7A,"The complete, uncut (season one and two) set of The Tudors is well worth the purchase price...and who wouldn't want to view this entertaining story again and again...have it at your fingertips, while you wait for the season three set...",1255219200,,236,4.925

8291572,5,B001D40U7A,"Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Natalie Dormer make this such a fun show to watch, their chemistry on screen is just perfect. I don't usually watch shows that are based on history but I couldn't help loving the Tudors!",1394150400,,211,4.578947368421052
8291573,5,B001D40U7A,"Jonathan Rhys Meyers wow what can you not say. He hits the best and worst parts of King Henry the VIII.  He feels and expresses the character to make you hurt and feel what the character is experiencing. He places his full support into the role and leaves nothing undone to make the character his. The supporting cast and crew is well casted. The writing of the series is beyond imaginable. The music enhances the overall experience at the right moment and time. Overall, a fabulous display of talent in many areas coming together to make this an awesome series.",1388448000,,562,4.62

8291577,4,B001D40U7A,"Well, the TV Series are amazing, they get 5 stars all the way, but that's not why I'm writing here today.

I filed a complain because the product description for this bundle says it has Spanish subtitles...not true at all. I bought this as a present for my father, and it was a surprise to find out Season One doesn't have Spanish subtitles. We are native Spanish speakers, and my dad doesn't understand English, so this was a huge downer.
The subtitles you can find for Season One are: English, English SDH, Greek and Hindi.

As for people concerned with the compatibility issue, it played perfectly on my NTSC PlayStation 3. After all, these are Region Free Blu-Rays.",1335657600,,669,4.661016949152542
8291578,5,B001D40U7A,"Bought this box set for my girlfriend for Christmas and she was absolutely ecstatic. She loves the Tudors but had never seen it on anything other than Netflix on her iPhone while working out in the gym. The quality improvement is obviously substantial. I too was really impressed with the quality of the series. Colors were bright and vivid when needed and dark and somber when in the Tower.

I had never really followed English history, more of a Classical guy, but I found myself searching Wikipedia for days after this series. The first couple episodes are difficult to follow if you know little about the period but eventually you get pulled into the series and want more and more. I think we finished the series in about 2 weeks. HIGHLY recommended. Also, I didn't buy the last two seasons from Amazon.com but from Amazon.uk because they ended up being cheaper. Make sure you get ""Region Free"" so you can play it in the States.",1334880000,2,932,4.648484848484848
8291579,5,B001D40U7A,"One of my favorite tv series.  Great acting, costumes, sets, interesting stories and somewhat educational as well.  As for a few historical inaccuracies within The Tudors drama, just keep in mind it's not meant to be a history lesson (you can seek out text books for that) it is meant to entertain and it does that very well.  I just wanted to let customers know you can get The Tudors entire series, seasons 1-4 on blu-ray from  amazon.co.uk for about the same price that you pay for only seasons 1-2 in the US.  I purchased Tudors Season 1, 2, 3 and 4 and with the USD to EUR currency conversion, it was about $75.  The UK dvds are region free and should play on any blu-ray player.  Currently in the US they are selling season 4 for $80 or the entire series for $180 so you could save $105!  Hope this helps.",1333065600,,811,4.2894736842105265
8291580,5,B001D40U7A,"I'm sick of the bad reviews of this TV show. I'm a history buff and when i started watching I never expected it to be 100% accurate. It's TV, its BASED on history. You can't expect it to be a documentary. Now, there were a few details that they left out/completely changed that would have been easier to just leave in, but whatever...it's someone else's artistic take on history. The acting is usually top notch....which shouldn't be confused with the writing. I will say the writing isn't always great, but the actors do the best they can with what they're given. Natalie Dormer is quite easily the best representation of Anne Boleyn we may ever see on the screen. (Aside from Genevive Bujold) After the second season when Anne meets her fate, the show does lose its luster, but the 3rd season is good enough to draw you back in, and amp you up for the 4th season. The first 2 are the best in my opinion. This show should get credit for parts of history that it DOES represent quite well. It gets too much of a bad rap for changing some things, rather than praise for keeping some great details. So keep in mind that this isn't completely accurate, but how many of us expect that from a TV show that isn't a documentary? I don't. I consider myself a Tudors buff as well. If anything this show will make you research the dynasty and learn more!",1318896000,10,1344,4.401606425702811
