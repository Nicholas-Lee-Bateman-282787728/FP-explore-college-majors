8662833,1,B00KZJX80U,Wow. Perhaps the worst singing I've ever heard in a movie. My ears are still ringing. And sooo boring. My 3 year old liked it so there's that I guess ....but If he asks to see it again  it's going to have to mysteriously dissapear.,1488067200,2,231,4.133333333333334

8662837,3,B00KZJX80U,"Before I go on with my thoughts on this film, I would like to make two suggestions (for anyone that plans to buy this film):

1. Watch the first two movies before this one: ""Go Hugo Go"" (Jungledhyret) & ""Hugo The Movie Star"" (Junglehyret 2)
2. Watch it on Netflix first (It's up now).

Just so you know this film (along with the first two films) are danish media which means that they have been English dubbed (would have been nice to have the danish dub with English subs too). The reason I say this is because the English dub doesn't sync very well with the character's mouths (same with the first two films). Anyways, this film wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I kind of had mixed feelings about it. What I like about this film is that there isn't much musical songs in it and the one song I'm actually okay with was the lullaby, when Rita and Hugo (I'm not calling him Jack) try to get a baby wild puppy to sleep.

What I didn't like about the film was that Hugo's name changed to Jack. Since when did they decide to change Hugo's name to Jack? When did that happen? Not sure what made the company who dubbed this in English to change the main character's name, but all I can guess is that it had to be changed due to some copyright issues. Also, the only character that I couldn't stand in this film was the butterfly. Every time he appeared on screen, I wanted to take a fly swatter and smack it! In my opinion, this butterfly wasn't necessary to even make an appearance. The butterfly looked stoned and even sounded like it was on drugs (kind of creepy).

Anyways Hugo is once again captured, but his captivity is in his amazon jungle (where half of it is already destroyed). The only difference in this film is that Rita gets to see Hugo's jungle home. So, is this movie worth watching? I say it's worth looking at once. Is it worth getting for your children? Sure! I'm quite positive that younger viewers will love this. Should older audiences like myself, (that are fans of the first two films) get this one? That really depends on how you feel about it. As I said before, it isn't bad, but some parts weren't good.",1414108800,5,2131,4.333333333333333
