8078637,5,B00007M5H4,"You'll understand the title I put if you've seen the movie.  I'll have to admit something first.  The movie isn't all that great.  It's pretty funny but not like the Disney movies now.  It's mostly just for kids is what I mean.  The only reason I loved this movie is because the last time I saw it was like 12 years ago when I was a kid.  When I bought this all my family remembered it and we enjoyed.  If you have seen this movie before, and you're thinking about buying it, you should.  It is so rare of a movie and it was hard for me to find it on the internet, so I'm happy I bought it.",1290556800,2,590,3.899159663865546
