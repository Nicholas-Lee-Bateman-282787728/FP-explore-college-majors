8669603,1,B00M15EYY0,"This film is a mess. It was one of those movies that was so bad I couldn't stop watching.

The first problem is the subtitles. They are so small and flash on the screen so fast that they are barely visible.

The second problem is lack of a logical story. This film could have been so much better and truly frightening, but the logic just wasn't here.

The third issue was the special effects. At one point I laughed out loud when one of the characters starts pulling long white hair from her mouth. It is obvious that she was actually pulling it from beside her face trying to make it appear like it was coming from her mouth. And then when she ""pulled"" a shrunken old lady's head from her ""mouth"", it was just too much.

The white hair makes further appearances. It trips people. It binds up wheel chair wheels.

At one point, a character wrestles on the floor with a giant rag doll.

Some scenes were a little creepy. The crone rushing down a dark hall was a little creepy. But later in the film, it is obvious that the crone is a poorly made up actor on a skate board.

Avoid this film unless you want a good laugh.",1420588800,2,1118,4.220657276995305

In the film, three teen idols go to an abandoned senior home where they plan to make a promo video about a haunted house. They don't expect to find much there, but their hope is that they'll at least be able to create an interesting video for their fans. Things soon get out of control however when one of the girls comes across angry spirits residing in the building. The event is minimized at first, by her and the filming crew, but it soon becomes clear that things aren't the same once they leave the site.

Everyone who went to the shoot starts to experience paranormal occurrences. The severity ranges from person to person. But it's clear that they disturbed something. We also learn about some behind the scenes rivalries  that exist between the girls. It creates a little more drama for the already exasperated situation. Anyway, the film takes some interesting twists and turns, throwing jump scares at us along with some eerie scenes, until it reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

When I first saw the trailer of this film, it peeked my interest right away. Mainly because it looked like a fresh idea. In a sense, it was. A Crone like lady running around terrorizing her victims was a new take on J-Horror in my book. What the film does correctly is it stays focused on the horror elements. We get plenty of little frights, along with some bigger scares. We even get a little voodoo style action thrown at us.

But the story itself seems like it could have used more development. The film is only about an hour and ten minutes long. A little extra time on character development would have really hit the spot. We do get a look at how  teen pop idol groups in Japan don't always get along. And there was one real telling scene where the girls turned on their pop personas for the camera with all the cutsie charm that only Japanese girls can do. Then the next minute they go back to their normal selves and start checking out their cell phones and ignoring each other. It made me laugh actually because of how true it can be.

But the deeper story needed more work. The whole group of characters were obviously having paranormal occurrences but were still trying to go on with their daily lives. In actuality, they needed to be a lot more concerned with what was happening to them. I guess maybe there was pressure to continue promoting themselves due to deadlines, but it seemed like they were too concerned with trying to do business as usual to an unrealistic level.

In any case, I'm giving the film a three. It had some eerie moments, good scares, and I liked the idea of an old Crone lady running around, terrorizing the characters. The girls were cute and did fairly well with their acting which is a plus. The story should've been flushed out a little more, but overall a decent viewing. Worth a  watch.",1413417600,3,2904,4.505703422053232
