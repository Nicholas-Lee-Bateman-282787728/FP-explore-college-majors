7077274,5,B00V90RZA8,"This DVD makes the training on the exercise bike twice as much fun. Here you can cycle through the beautiful woods of the National Park De Hoge Veluwe without leaving your house. The first path leads to a paved road through a beautiful green forest, from time to time you meet other cyclists and you are always accompanied by pleasant birdsongs. Here the pace is very pleasant for a relaxing ride after a stressful day. The second path is a little faster. You go through a forest where the  red-orange leaves glow gorgeously, it also goes through a sort of grassland, you have a wide view and a beautiful blue sky. On the third path, it goes back to a slower pace, everything is very varied here. You can see the diversity of the forest with its pretty colors and beautiful vegetation and the sun shines through the trees. With this DVD exercising at home is great fun.",1431302400,,869,4.5
7077275,5,B00V90RZA8,"This lovely DVD offers the opportunity to take three great bike rides  all of them through a fabulous forest area with wonderful bird songs in the background.  I think this would also be a good treadmill DVD if you wanted a fast walk or run.

Ride 1 takes off through a beautiful lush green forest at a somewhat leisurely pace.  Loved the bird songs and dove calls as I wound my way down the bike path.  Youll get passed by a few other cyclists, which just adds to the feeling of actually being there.  The variety of trees was amazing and the play of light and shadows through the trees was a visual pleasure!

Ride 2 will give you a workout as you pedal along at a faster clip through a forest dressed for fall.  The colors are absolutely brilliant, and once again the sounds of nature add to the joy of the journey.  I was just waiting to hear the crunch of the leaves!  Also enjoyed coming out of the forest at the end of the ride into a grasslands area.  The change of scenery was great.

Ride 3 starts off in a lush meadow and heads into the trees.  Felt like it was truly a great day for a ride when working out to this segment.  Once again, the bird songs and passing cyclists just added to the realism of the ride.  Some of the forest areas were much denser in this ride, which seemed like a nice change of pace from the previous rides.  Once again, the colors were fabulous  loved the greens and shades of red and gold.  From the forest you head into a grassland area where the bike path runs next to a dirt road then back into a forested area again.  Loved the end of the ride because you come out into a meadow and go by a farmhouse, which to me was very picturesque.

Although all the rides were beautiful (and displayed well on my HDTV), I enjoyed Ride 3 the most because of the variety of scenery included in this segment.  Happy cycling!",1430611200,,1853,4.207386363636363
7077276,5,B00V90RZA8,"These 3 x 20 min. rides are so relaxing!  You ride along dedicated cycle path through different types of forests.  Occasionally you cross path with other cyclists, but there is generally total solitude. The nature ambient sounds contribute to the feeling of really being there!  One of the rides is at a much faster speed through flatlands and you can really push yourself to go faster there.  I also think that Cycle 1 and 3 would be suitable for running on a treadmill.  For variety, I also started the DVD on Cycle 3 and it looped continuously back to the beginning to Cycle 1 and 2, which is a very nice feature!  You can watch a trailer of all these Virtual Cycle Rides and Virtual Walks on the creators website www.worldnaturevideo.com, and if someone prefers to purchase and download digital versions of these rides, you can do so also through their website.  I have played the HD digital version of some Virtual Walks and Virtual Cycle Rides using Apple TV and it works without problems. Highly recommended workout videos!!",1429315200,,1031,4.726256983240224

8709638,4,B00V90RZA8,I was looking for a realistic scenery DVD to enjoy while on my stationary bike. This is perfect! Totally enjoy viewing it and it takes away the monotony of biking indoors!,1470614400,,171,4.548387096774194
8709639,5,B00V90RZA8,"Exercising has become a lot more fun! I have used my stationary bike and my Gazelle for this DVD and both ways work great with it.  My mom has borrowed this dvd and she just walks in place with it.  It makes exercising easier to do when you are enjoying the beautiful scenery ""moving with you."" I really enjoy the cycle dvd's. All 3 fall cycle video paths are so beautiful.  Gorgeous scenery!",1469664000,,392,4.342465753424658
8709640,4,B00V90RZA8,This makes riding my exercise bike more fun. The only downer is the constant birds chirping and singing. It does not seem as realistic as really being outdoors experiencing it first hand. The scenery cuts to the next scene but the birds singing stays constant (even annoying at times) and doesn't fade in and out as you pass the area like it would in real life. Overall a beautiful ride but I guess I'll just have to turn the volume down a bit. Lol,1452124800,,448,4.345238095238095
8709641,5,B00V90RZA8,"I bought this video because I have COPD and needed something to motivate me to get off my butt and walk. The video allows me to keep up, pause to catch my breath or just pause and comeback at it, after a brief rest. The vendor ships fast and very secure shipping. I experienced absolutely no problems with this seller and will happily purchase from this seller again.  This video allows someone like me to have a can do it ""attitude.""",1442188800,,434,4.3580246913580245
8709642,5,B00V90RZA8,"What a great way to add a little something interesting to your exercise routine.  I believe this DVD would be great with a trendmill routine, too...except that the second ride might be a bit too fast.  The second ride was actually my favorite even though it was a bit faster.  I loved the beautiful hues of fall.  I could almost hear the crackling leaves as I ran through the forest.

I think what makes this DVD special besides the high quality of the videography and sound is that each ride actually offers changing scenes as you ride through the forest.  I enjoyed the nature sounds, too.  The birds chirping added to the overall realistic feeling of actual being in a forest.

Great DVD.  It's like a cycle ride through the woods without leaving your home or gym.  For a longer workout the tracks loop for continuous play.",1434585600,,826,4.557823129251701
8709643,5,B00V90RZA8,As it said on the package. Great!,1433030400,,33,3.857142857142857
8709644,5,B00V90RZA8,"I really feel as if I am there  cycling or running through this lovely forest!

I enjoy the variations of the summer and autumn scenes: in one section there are wonderfully green trees, bushes and shrubs; next it is autumn with the trees a vibrant kaleidoscope of copper and orange colours, and the ground is carpeted with bright leaves in the same beautiful hues.  This program is enhanced by the melodic sounds of the birds singing.

In another section I move through wide open spaces of flat grassland, and I see white cloud formations in the blue sky.  At the end of the disc I pass by people who are out walking their dogs; then I go past a traditional thatched roofed farmhouse.  This DVD really brings the forest into the room with me.  While this is advertised as a cycle ride, I find it fine for either a fast walk or run as well.",1432598400,,839,4.374193548387097
