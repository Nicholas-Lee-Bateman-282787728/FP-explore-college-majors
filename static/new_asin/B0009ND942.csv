8063428,5,B0009ND942,"From 1973: The late great Richard Crenna & comically talented Ruth Buzzi are the guests. Included: Cornering a criminal in a warehouse, a husband-and-wife cop team (Carol, Richard) spend most of the time bickering over their marriage; a musical-comedy about an adorable wind-up doll (Ruth); ""Celebrities and Peasants"", a game show hosted by Lyle, pairs a feather-headed star (Ruth) with an ""average nobody"" (Carol); a montage salute to ""bad girl"" movie roles; and a musical-comedy finale about the invention of the mimeo to turn-of-the-century women.
From 1975: The four Pointer Sisters (who would go on to chart-topping success in the 80's) are the guests. Included: A memorably dysfunctional ""family"" sketch has Eunice, Ed, Mama & Mickey (Carol, Harvey, Vicki & Tim) playing charades which spirals hilariously out of control; the Pointers bring some stylish funk with the song ""How Long (Betcha Got a Chick on the Side)""; a woman (Carol) seeking a sympathetic ear gets anything but from a weary bartender (Harvey); a running gag bit with Tim trying to sing a straight rendition of a song; a silent comedy sketch has two hungry bums (Carol, Tim) earning cash for food as they go up against Killer Bronco (Harvey) in the ring; a ""square"" singing group (the Pointers) clash with the sensibilities of a hip, groovy radio DJ (Harvey, cleverly funny here); and Carol & Vicki join the Pointers in a lively comedy-gospel rendition of ""Get Me to the Church on Time"" in the finale.
Once again, this volume demonstrates what a landmark comedy-variety program ""The Carol Burnett Show"" proved to be!",1263340800,,1588,5.064885496183206
8063429,5,B0009ND942,"Carol Burnett can sing, dance, do drama or do comedy. She and her regular co stars are ""the bomb"", especially in the ""Family"" sketch featuring Tim Conway, Vicki Lawrence, Harvey Korman and Carol as a working class southern family trying to play Charades. The fabulous Pointer Sisters (Ruth, Anita, Bonnie & June) sing their #1 R&B hit How Long (Betcha Got A Chick On The Side), play a straight-laced vocal group facing off a super hip radio DJ and join Carol and her female chorus in a rousing gospel version of ""Get Me To The Church On Time"" from the musical ""My Fair Lady"". With Carol and the Pointers, you can't go wrong!!!!",1120003200,4,627,4.557522123893805
