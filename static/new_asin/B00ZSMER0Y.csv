8720835,3,B00ZSMER0Y,"I've taken an adult beginner ballet class. This video says it's for beginners, but if you haven't worked on some fundamental ballet forms/leg positions, it will be difficult to follow along. It also requires a good amount of core stability out of the gate. Perhaps they consider it beginning ballet technique for intermediate athletes. The long routine focuses on ballet, which I appreciate. I've only done one of the shorter routines: almost all yoga. I have plenty of yoga DVDs. I wanted this one specifically for ballet. Bummed about that. Also, the video quality is pretty poor, especially for a Gaiam video. Overall, I'll keep it, but I'll probably only use the long routine and feel lucky I had some ballet technique beforehand.",1479340800,6,734,4.975609756097561
