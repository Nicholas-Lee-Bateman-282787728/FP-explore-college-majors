Suddenly, they jump through a wormhole, which stuns everyone except Data.  When everyone wakes up, he says that they were out for 30 seconds.  However, things are not what they appear to be.  Little clues seem to indicate that Data is hiding the truth.  As investigation goes deeper and deeper, everyone begins to their lose trust in Data.  Picard finally decides to head back the ""scene of the crime"", where the wormhole was first encountered...

Overall, a pretty intriguing episode, with plenty of drama.  While I didn't really like the whole solution to ""Whodunit"", I have to say that it was a pretty good episode on the whole, earning 4 out of 5 stars.",1157673600,,860,4.835616438356165
