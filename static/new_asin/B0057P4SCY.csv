4597679,5,B0057P4SCY,"If you enjoy comedy from the 1950's and want to pay a low price for it, this collection is for you.  There were comedy shows on the DVDs that I had never even known existed.  Hours of clean enjoyment.",1354838400,,200,4.102564102564102
4597680,2,B0057P4SCY,"A interesting purchase for the sake of old time comedy television and some star power , but not nearly as much Johnny Carson as the cover would imply. This is very early Carson, in black and white.",1324944000,6,197,4.351351351351352

The main difference between the two is the addition here of a 22 minute ""documentary"" where a nameless white-haired narrator reels off Johnny's career data in-between clips of shows already in this set.

The four discs are in black paper envelopes that have glassine circles so you can read the DVD labels. I was alarmed to find the interior of this item's plastic storage case has an incredibly foul odor that gave me a headache after I sniffed it.

Before he became the king of late-nite TV, Johnny Carson hosted a self-named summer replacement series. Ten examples of that half-hour program are here, as well as samples of Johnny's quiz show, his morning program and the very early (1953) ""Carson's Cellar.""

NOTABLES--

""The Johnny Carson Show"" aired Thursday nights at 8:30 on CBS from 6/30/55 to 3/1/56. The quiz show, ""Who Do You Trust?"" ran on ABC-TV from 1957 to '63; based on his performance here, Johnny was hired by NBC to replace Jack Paar on ""The Tonight Show.""

""Bobby Darin and Friends"" was a pilot for a variety series the network rejected. It was written by Bud Yorkin and Norman Lear (""All in the Family"").

""Shower of Stars"" aired once a month on CBS-TV. The most frequent host was Jack Benny.

""The Milton Berle Show"" was the Berle variety series that came after ""The Texaco Star Theater.""

""The Colgate Comedy Hour"" had a long run (with rotating hosts) on NBC-TV in the 1950s.

8461067,4,B0057P4SCY,Some really old clips.  Commercials are great.,1483747200,,46,5.571428571428571
8461068,4,B0057P4SCY,Haven't watched it yet but am sure we will love it as Johnny Carson was a favorite of ours.,1472083200,,91,3.8421052631578947
8461069,3,B0057P4SCY,"Only the fist disc was Johnny's early stuff, the other three were old variety shows from others.  Not too bad but the age of the original prints made for lots of lines and a few skips.",1461715200,,184,4.111111111111111
8461070,2,B0057P4SCY,"Very disappointed!  Hardly any Johnny Carson in the dvd's.  If you want to see old tapes, dvd's, of Johnny Carson don't buy this dvd!",1432598400,,133,4.5
8461071,4,B0057P4SCY,"This is a great collection but the film quality is not so great. It looks just like it did when it came on tv in the 50s. But the price makes up for that loss. And I must say that the shows on here are quite humorous and there are some pretty big names including: Sid Caesar, Cesar Romero, Edward G Robinson, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Burt Lancaster, Jack Benny, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and more. So if you're looking for good clean television, look no further than this collection.

8461072,5,B0057P4SCY,"There's many old classic tv shows on these DVDs. This is a great combination of old time shows and specials at such an unbeatable price. If you think you're too young to enjoy this, it's a great gift for mom or dad!!",1404518400,,216,4.166666666666667
8461073,5,B0057P4SCY,I would recommend this DVD to all fans of Johnny Carson and the Tonight Show that was shown on TV,1392422400,,97,3.9
8461074,1,B0057P4SCY,"If I hadn't thrown away the packaging I would return this,  One disc was cracked, one disc stopped half way thru and the rest were of such poor quality that you couldn't even tell who you were watching.  It arrived late and I paid extra to have it by Christmas.  It was supposed to be new but I have a very difficult time believing that.  Very, very disappointed!",1388275200,2,363,4.294117647058823
8461075,2,B0057P4SCY,"I thought the DVD was going to be the early years of Johnny Carson, and there was some.  But there was too many other shows included.  I wish I had had access to the titles on the disks - but that would have asked to much I'm afraid.",1358640000,,233,3.8333333333333335
8461076,2,B0057P4SCY,"The DVD arrived on time and in good shape However let the buyer beware.  Seeing this as it was shown I believed it was All Johnny Carson.  I expected 35 episodes of Carson including the Tonight Show.  The DVD has Some of the first shows done by Johnny Carson, none of the Tonight Show the rest of the 35 episodes were of other old stars.  Maybe my fault for not reading the entire description.  Very Disappointing.",1357430400,9,414,4.394736842105263
