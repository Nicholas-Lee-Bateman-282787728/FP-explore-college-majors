3978381,5,B002SAMME2,It a great story to put to film and I enjoyed completely.,1271203200,,57,3.8333333333333335
3978382,5,B002SAMME2,"This is a cute movie and I always love watching the Hallmark channel movies, this is one of my favorites.",1442534400,,105,4.3
3978383,4,B002SAMME2,"This was a sweet movie.
It held my interest all the way through.
I loved the ending.

I loved the Dahlia character the most, especially at the end, when she showed so much emotion.
She reminded me of a sweeter version of Elizabeth Taylor.

I would have liked the scene where the two brides were shopping for wedding gowns to be longer.
I would have liked to see them try on more gowns.
I absolutely loved the gown that Gwen picked out, it was so gorgeous, I loved everything about it.
But I did not like the gown that Sandra picked out it had a horizontal piece across the stomach that obviously was supposed to be slimming but had the opposite effect because the eye went right to the stomach area.
It was strange to see two brides shop for wedding dresses together, with no one else there with them.

There was a lot of chemistry between Gwen and Jake, but I did not understand what Gwen saw in him because I thought that he was a total loser.
They had a physical attraction, but I did not see anything else between them.
I actually expected a twist that Jake was going to admit that he was gay, which did not happen.

I think that Gwen would have been better off with Mark, they just needed to work some things out.

I would have liked to see a different actress play Gwen, someone more like Rachel McAdams.

The ending left me smiling.",1441065600,,1339,4.2936507936507935

3978387,5,B002SAMME2,This is a very funny movie!  Delta Burke plays an author who writes a book on how to find love and get married.  She has problems with her own love life and tries to help her assistant find love.  It has some really funny situations in it and is an enjoyable movie.,1423526400,,265,4.0576923076923075

3978391,5,B002SAMME2,I only ended up buying this in a set with 3 other movies. I really didn't care for it in the beginning. Now I love it and watch it way too much for my husband's liking,1410566400,2,167,3.6666666666666665
3978392,5,B002SAMME2,Great Movie,1406764800,,11,5.0
3978393,4,B002SAMME2,This is such a cute movie.  I really enjoyed watching it.  The actresses in it were good and loved how they all found love at the end!  Delta Burke's character was interesting and I was glad she finally shared everything about her past in her book.  This would be a good movie for mothers and daughter(s) to watch together!,1399507200,,323,4.423728813559322
3978394,5,B002SAMME2,I really enjoyed this movie I had no idea it would be as entertaining as it was.  Would highly recommend it.,1388275200,,108,4.142857142857143
3978395,5,B002SAMME2,I am a great fan of Andrea Roth and Delta Burke I don't think we see enough of them. Bridal Fever is light and of course romantic it is one I can watch over and over.,1369094400,4,166,3.638888888888889
3978396,5,B002SAMME2,I seen this on TV but didnt' get to see it all ordered it loved it would recommend it to anyone,1367280000,,95,3.5714285714285716
3978397,4,B002SAMME2,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Bridal Fever was pretty good. There were a few utterances of mild crude language, use of alcohol, low cut tops and strapless dresses seen occasionally on women.  There were also suggestive images on several romance novels in the bookstore.  The theme is a little more mature, as it has to do a lot with dating and divorce.  I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again.  There were several parts that I thought could have been better, but all it was entertaining.

I didn't like the fact that everyone seemed to think that getting married was all that mattered.  If you are single and beautiful, then there is no reason on earth why you shouldn't be married.  You don't have have anything in common with the guy or even love him.  All you have to do is ""seal the deal""...luckily Gwen eventually realizes this is wrong and marries the guy of her choice.

I also thought that Gwen's friend, Sandra, was mean at the end.  At the beginning of the movie she is freaking out because she and Gwen are the last two unmarried friends from school.  At each wedding, the brides have had all the single girls stand/sit down in front when the picture was taken.  Because Sandra talked Gwen out of dating the guy of her choice, simply because he wouldn't talk about his views on marriage and children on the first date, Gwen is therefore is the last one to get married.  So at Sandra's wedding she still makes Gwen stand alone in front of all the other Saint Mary's girls.  Some friend.

Despite these two things, as I said, I would watch this movie again.  It was funny and fairly clean.",1360108800,,1638,4.446308724832215
3978398,4,B002SAMME2,"Definitely a chick flick and it has been on TV many times but I bought it anyway so I could watch without commercials.  It's a fun movie but I have to say, Andrea Roth says she was reading Jane Austen at 10 in the movie, yet mispronouces Wuthering Heights by saying Withering Heights.  Sometimes these actors need to have a bit more depth into their parts to come off believable.",1357776000,,379,4.4
3978399,4,B002SAMME2,I love this little Hallmark movie for it's simplicity. Not Delta Burke's best work but she's still playing Suzanne in a way.  Good one for Sunday afternoon.,1350777600,,156,4.777777777777778
3978400,2,B002SAMME2,"'Bridal Fever' offers a very good story.  All actors do a fine job.  What I cannot tolerate is the 'Jake' character, who is an absolute bore, immature, irresponsible, yet 'Gwen' falls for him completely.  The viewer is not given one reason to like him, nor to understand the 'Gwen's attraction to him.  Why was this character written so shallowly?  We're given depth with 'Dahlia' - and a very fine performance by Delta Burke, I must say.

Eh. I just can't watch the movie again, I mean, it has a bookstore, publishing, the foils of celebrity, and the cinematography is great, costumes, lighting, art direction - but so wish I could get past the 'Jake' 'Gwen' relationship - although you cannot call it that at all -- and it's irksome to have an entire movie destroyed by such a throw-in/throw-away character.  Phooey!  You have to wonder how a bunch of people working on a film could not have corrected such a major character problem.",1328659200,,935,4.693251533742331
3978401,5,B002SAMME2,"Ok, so it's definitly a ""chic flick"" but had to own it just the same.  Every year when this comes on, I thought about getting it, so I finally got over the laziness and bought it.  I like just about anything Andrea Roth is in, so I'm very happy with my purchase.  It's kooky and follows the standard rom/com basics.  Only requires a bowl of popcorn and a rootbeer to have a marvelous night.",1286409600,10,390,4.22972972972973
