8555996,5,B00AQ590GE,"Just a silly movie!  We only watch ""It's Pat"".  I know - it received terrible reviews, but I enjoy the ridiculous plot, overly quirky characters, and great, if clich, one-liners.  It makes me laugh and marvel at how simple and fun life can be.  Parental warning - a few of the one-liners are not adolescent appropriate, but nothing that hitting the mute button for 5 seconds cannot fix.  No bad language or overly offensive material.  Just be sure to buy or rent for cheap and prepare for a few goofy laughs.  I do not think you will be disappointed.",1413936000,,550,4.494949494949495
8555997,5,B00AQ590GE,"I just bought it for It's Pat, by it's self it was like $10, the pkg was $5 so I can't complain.",1374105600,,96,3.409090909090909
8555998,2,B00AQ590GE,"these three movies are stupid: star** out *****

It's Pat: is better then the other two, but its still not great with no plot, unlikable main character, and one note joke get old from begin to end. stars ** out *****

Cabin Boy: I did like these movie, sure it has fans but I'm one of them. I like Chris Elliott but he didn't make me laugh at all, the story and humor feel like it came lame episodes of ""The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack"" into a movie, and only good thing in there was shark-man play by un credit Russ Tamblyn. stars *1/2 out *****

Frank McKlusky, C. I.: It's the worst in these collection it plays like the offensive, unfunny spawn of Ace Ventura and Hot Rod but painful. stars 0 out *****

just watch It's Pat and Cabin Boy if you want too, and just skip Frank McKlusky.",1367712000,2,796,4.251655629139073
