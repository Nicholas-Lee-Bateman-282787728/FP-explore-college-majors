1274476,4,B00003CXMY,"The setting of the movie is in the English province of Cornwall, which is the most southwest corner of U.K.  Most of the filming is done in the very small fishing village of Port Isaac.  Having visited Port Isaac I can grandly attest the area is beyond beautiful, unspoiled by progress and the people are just as friendly as the characters in ""Saving Grace.""",978307200,2,358,4.578125
1274477,5,B00003CXMY,"My friend Aleta and I saw this movie together too in the theater and it played to a packed house. We are both middle-aged women so we have become over time big Brenda Blethyn fans. We doubted that any American movie maker would have made this film with a middle-aged woman, Blethyn, as not only the leading character but also the lead ROMANTIC character. This film contains the ultimate dose of charm, humor and whimsy as only the British can show in their own unique fashion.  Admittedly, sometimes I ""get"" their funny movies and sometimes I don't.  This one we both ""got"" and were laughing uproariously throughout it as was our audience.  Yes, it goes a bit over the top at the end but it's a very ""feel good"" ending and this movie was a bit of a fairy tale anyway so it didn't bother us.

The plot involves a newly widowed and thus impoverished Blethyn who is a top gardener in her village.  When her gardener brings her his marijuana stash for rejuvenation, they decide to grow more and sell a big crop of it to a drug dealer so as to solve her money problems. Seeing Blethyn trying to find a drug dealer in London on her own is worth the price of admission alone for outright hilarity. If the film maker had chosen heroin as the drug the movie obviously would not have worked.  However, the use of marijuana in this movie is about as ""serious"" as its use in the old Cheech and Chong movies. I also doubt that English Cornish villages, as shown here, could in real life be this utterly charming and perfect but I sure loved the fantasy of it in the movie.

1274478,5,B00003CXMY,"Saving Grace was nothing less than an explosion of pure English charm twisted into a crime/ Cheech and Chong comedy that produces an infinite number of smiles afterwards. This was probably my favorite film of 2000. Brenda Blethyn is masterful in her role as the innocent-yet-I-have-no-way-to-save-my-manor-but-grow-weed persona. Craig Fergusen proves that he is more than a sitcom boss in his role as this movie's writer and Grace's pothead gardener. He portrays the very human conflict between youthful exuberence and the necessity to mature (hence quit selling the chronic). Working at a small movie theater, I found myself unable to tear myself away from this film, and I still miss it. Hearing the audience explode at the film's funnier moments (which were quite a number in few) was enjoyment enough. It's a shame not enough people picked up on it.",978048000,2,853,5.143884892086331
1274479,4,B00003CXMY,"This movie is quite ""cute."" Lots of chuckles throughout. The premise is wonderful. Characters are very engaging. Unfortunately, I felt that, at the end, the author didn't know where to take it.
I recommend this more as a fun rental than as something to add to a collection.",977616000,2,273,4.708333333333333
1274480,5,B00003CXMY,"I first saw Saving Grace on a Virgin Atlantic flight in July, coming home from Scotland. I never heard of the movie, but was quickly drawn in by the characters setting and plot. When it finally opened in the U.S., I became a one-man PR firm, talking the film up and getting people to go see it. Brenda Blethyn is one of my favorite actresses, back from when she played the mother in ""A River Runs Through It."" She plays Grace with dignity, warmth, and just a touch of desperation. Craig Ferguson is nothing like the character he plays on Drew Carey. His Matthew is sweet, concerned, and a little irresponsible, but trying hard to do the best he can.  The supporting cast is wonderful too, adding a richness to the village in Cornwall that makes you care about what is happening, and believe it to be possible. Martin Clunes as Dr. Bamford, and Valerie Edmond as Matthew's girlfriend, Nicky, provide a sense of whimsy and groundedness to the events that unfold. Combine the performances with a good soundtrack and the beautiful setting on the Cornish coast and you have a great ""little"" film in which you will discover new things with each viewing.",975628800,93,1147,4.622549019607843
1274481,4,B00003CXMY,"If you enjoy the British sense of humor and films with a little slapstick comedy, then you will probably like this film. However, if you're opposed to the buying, selling, and use of Marijuana, then the film may bother you a bit. If you don't want your kid to figure out how to grow MaryJane then you better not buy the DVD. I am a gardener, and believe me I learned a lot!!
Brenda Blythen of SECRETS AND LIES fame and the hapless mother in LITTLE VOICE plays Grace Trevthyn of the film's title role. In this film, Ms. Blethyn isn't slutty or impoverished--well okay, she is impoverished. Her recently deceased spouse has left her in a bit of a pickle. Seems he blew the family fortune and hocked the ancestral dwelling before he died.  Oh what's a poor widow with a greenhouse and passion for gardening to do?? Grow a cash crop of course.  Things come out right in the end, but there's a lot of hanky panky (Grace has a heck of a love affair with a Frenchman--you'll recognize him) before all is said and done.",975196800,2,1011,4.372340425531915
1274482,4,B00003CXMY,"In ""Saving Grace"" we find genuine characters, a real script/storyline, and lots to laugh about. Grace (Brenda Blethyn) is somewhat short of money and decides to grow marijuana to provide an income. . . take it from there. Nothing is wasted in this one, everyone turns in an excellent performance with Ms. Blethyn (who was outstanding in last year's ""Little Voice"") really shining. Don't miss this movie--it's well worth your time.",973900800,2,430,5.070422535211268

1274880,4,B00003CXMY,"Funny, superb acting. Love Brenda Blethyn! The script is a little implausible but not totally. I am what many both negatively and positively call an Anglophile. Don't really know as I am not really moved by labels but love a lot of things British, some like TV because they are funny & good, others like all the aristocracy ish, love of American-bashing, etc, because it is among other things pretty intriguing. This would not work as an American film. All that being said, this is just fun, funny and easy to watch. I would also recommend viewing other Brenda Blethyn work as she is so versatile. She does comedy well, brings humor to more slightly ""serious"" roles such as the mother in ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Little Voice"", as well as serious drama like "" Secrets a& Lies"". And of course there is ""Vera"" which is simply awesome.",1518307200,2,834,4.641891891891892

1274989,4,B00003CXMY,"I saw this movie (made in 2000) on DVD recently on the advice of a friend who has a knack for finding stories that don't sound like much plotwise but turn out to have wonderful characters. Saving Grace perfectly fits that description.

Middle-aged Grace Trevethyn has a beautiful house above a fishing village in Cornwall (lovely scenery), but she becomes in danger of losing it when her husband dies and leaves her with a mountain of debt from bad investments that she didn't know about. She sees a possible way out of her dilemma when her young gardener and friend, Matthew, lets her in on the secret that hes raising a small marijuana crop (still illegal in those days). Matthew isn't a very good gardener, but Grace is, and when Matthew tells her that a larger crop could be worth a lot of money, she goes all in. Humor arises from the idea of a middle-aged, upper-class woman trying to deal with the London drug culture and, later, from the inevitable giggly effects of the weed, mostly consumed unintentionally by a variety of characters.

The main reason for bothering with this film is the outstanding performance of Brenda Blethyn as Grace (though Craig Ferguson as Matthew is also good). She becomes both funny and endearing. Although not particularly a fan of (or even familiar with) stoner movies, I found the post-pot antics great fun, too. (The climactic scene bears a strong resemblance to the finale of Pirates of Penzance.) I agree with one of the other reviewers that the ending is distinctly implausible, but by then I was too fond of the characters and laughing too hard to care. I definitely recommend this lost little gem to anyone who wants an hour or two of funwhether you're stoned (or even like marijuana) or not.",1510444800,3,1739,4.717105263157895

Hardest part was cigarettes he says. Cancer sticks that are fully legal and kill every day along with alcohol.

And full disclosure, I just wanted to spend some visual time in Cornwall. Well after about 30 minutes, all that changed. Yes. Brenda Blethyn and Martin Clunes are fun to watch in their younger states, and even Craig Ferguson is okay, the script is one disappointment after another. I guess if I had smoked as much weed as the characters do, I might have found it funny--then again the plot is one cliche after the next.

Brenda Blethyn is superb, and even the actors with only a few lines and listed at the end of the credits are superb.  How do the British do that?

I finally found it here on Amazon. I got it quickly (thanks Amazon) and watched it last night. It is well-produced and enjoyable. Martin Clunes (the Doc Martin I mentioned above) has a minor role in 'Saving Grace' but this time goes by the name of Dr. Bamford. Craig Ferguson is the star of this along with Brenda Blethyn as the 'Grace' of the title. While it is not 'Doc Martin', it is still a great movie with plenty of laughs. It is shot in the beautiful Cornish town of Port Isaac (Portwenn). I recommend it.",1416355200,,668,4.267716535433071

I still find that even when it is on commercial TV or cable, I watch it again and again. I really got to enjoy these people and the relationships that develop. It is two good people helping each other out when things get difficult, and as the movie moves along, we learn that the whole town is a loving community of odd and funny characters. If I am not  being helpful to you it is because this is a delightful film of surprises and I don't want to give away too much. I will just say that Craig Ferguson  wrote a great script, someone made a good choice of casting some wonderful actors who create a great sense of community in this small English town. That I know of, Ferguson has written two movies, both of which I have enjoyed, but this one is really special and, for me, has withstood the test of time.",1413244800,4,955,4.213114754098361

1277032,4,B00003CXMY,"A light-hearted movie that any Craig Ferguson fan in particular will enjoy. Craig is one of my all-time fav comedians and he does well in this movie role as an eccentric gardener who vows to help ""save Grace"" in a very unusual way.

Yes, as some other reviewers have mentioned here, there are some implausible parts to this film but heh, it IS a comedy, a light comedy at that. Does it always have to add up to be entertaining? I don't think so.

I did agree with one review though about the scenery, would have been SO nice to see more of fabulous Cornwall, instead of so many interior shots. I guess given the story though, much of the action did happen inside.

I also thought the actor who played Craig's love interest was a rather strange choice. Not to be nasty, but Craig was a lot prettier than she was! ;-) Didn't seem like a likely couple.

Overall, a fun film I did enjoy. I hope Craig is planning a lot more movies to come too.",1410566400,,939,4.258426966292135

I loved it so much I bought it 12 yrs ago (2002) on VHS when our local movie store put it on sale. My daughter just gifted me with this on DVD for my birthday, and it arrived today...so, guess what I am watching tonight?

The basic storyline contains circumstances that I believe everyone can find something to relate to, within it.  A woman finds herself a widow without warning, and saddled with a massive amount of debt that her husband had secretely amassed without her knowledge or consent. Her life is turned upside down as she begins to understand a lot of her life was based lie after lie, as she is left to untagle the mess her husband behind.

How she solves her problem is creative, illegal, and LOL funny. Illegal activities not withstanding, this is truly a must see movie!!!",1406592000,,917,4.607361963190184

His character is a lot nicer than than the Doc Martin character, which makes me wonder how they managed to come up with the idea for the character change in the series. At any rate, Craig Ferguson is his usual low-key, likeable self. I think he wrote most of the story, and it shows - sweet, nice, kind of bland.

1278579,4,B00003CXMY,The storyline has much humour in it even though it is a little beyond credibility.  The location shooting in an English(?) coastal fishing village is its best feature to my way of thinking.,1378252800,,189,4.7272727272727275

Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn have great chemistry in the movie.  Martin Clunes also turned in a hilarious performance.  The dialogue clever and intelligent and the action moved at a good pace.  In my mind, the scene when they first light up the greenhouse was the absolute gut-busting funniest.",1377475200,,418,4.671232876712328

1278669,5,B00003CXMY,A wonderful comedy. Must be seen to be appreciated. View Craig Ferguson as a youngster. A newer (rather underground) classic that is certain to amaze and delight the viewers.,1375228800,,174,5.0344827586206895

I have already purchased four DVD's because I let friends borrow my copy--to cheer them up and get them over life's rough spots.  Unfortunately, they always ""forget"" to return them and because I personally watch Saving Grace at least once a month (monthly ratio of rough spots) I have to go to Amazon and buy another copy for myself.  But I adore this film and I know it will make you smile, laugh, giggle, and throughly enjoy yourself.  So why are you waiting?.  Go buy it now.  Have a good laugh. It's the best and probably the cheapest investment you could ever make.

1279274,2,B00003CXMY,"Every so often, Elstree turns out a jewel. Unfortunately this is not one of them. The English like their humour either subtle, or over-the-top farcical, Americans prefer smutty or slapstick (hence the transatlantic popularity of Benny Hill & Fawlty Towers). ""Saving Grace"" has none of the above. Such humour as there is is purely situational, and consists largely of ordinary people doing completely ridiculous things due to the nature of Grace's cash crop. This is the kind of unfunny humour I associate with films from Down Under, where inane offerings like ""The Castle"" have huge success The plot thesis is thin, and its development is non-existent. The main characters are simply not credible, despite superb acting from just about everyone in the cast. In fact, I would suggest that the only really believable roles in the whole film were Matthew Stewart's girlfriend Nicky (Valerie Edmond), the Vicar (Leslie Phillips) and Quentin Rhodes, the London lawyer (Clive Merrison). Everyone else was a cardboard cut-out caricature.

I find, too, a huge wasted opportunity in the failure to exploit the incredible beauty of rural Cornwall to its maximum potential. Far too much of the movie was interior shot, or down in the narrow village lanes where it is impossible to appreciate the surroundings.

All in all, a pleasant enough waste of an hour and a half streaming it on N*tfl*x, but if I'd had to pay to watch it, I'd have been really disappointed.",1322179200,,1452,5.020746887966805

1279276,4,B00003CXMY,"The main reason we watched this comedy was the appearance of Martin Clunes as an older version of the Doc Martin character in a supporting role and the location of what would become, in the later Doc Martin TV series, the fictional village of Port Wenn.

This is a reasonably entertaining movie and does have some really funny moments. The acting all across the board is first rate with both leads doing a fine job. The story takes some rather unexpected turns most of which have an amoral perspective on life. Saving Grace refers to finding a way to keep Grace, a new widow, from financial disaster, including the loss of her house, after her husband's death.

The scenery in Port Isaac, Port Wenn's real name, is charming and one good reason to watch the movie. If you've watched the Doc Martin series you'll probably find this one interesting from that perspective alone.

As a standalone movie it does provide an original storyline with good acting and a surprise ending; most viewers will probably find it fun and entertaining.",1316044800,2,1032,4.754189944134078

It tells the story of Grace, played brilliantly by Brenda Blethyn, her husband has recently committed suicide and left her with no money, Grace then has to find a way to make money to save her home.

As the story unfolds, you realize that widowhood is not all she's facing. Grace is literally about to lose everything due to her former husband's poor financial decisions. It's going to take a miracle to save her home.

Scotsman Matt (Craig Ferguson) could use a miracle, too. With his wage check from Grace bouncing, he's about to have to leave England and go home.  Since Grace owes him, he asks her to help him save a marijuana plant he's been growing to sell.

Grace has more than a green thumb.  A partnership is born and the two have devoted Grace's greenhouse to the illegal plant.  Trouble comes when they have to figure out how to sell it.

Both Grace and Matt are hilarious, but so is the whole small town cast.  If you don't object to drug films, ""Saving Grace"" is definitely a film you're going to get a kick out of.

1279588,4,B00003CXMY,I thought this was a fun film.  Didn't have to concentrate watching the plot unfold.  Scenery lovely and overall good film for a wet day.  Made me feel good.,1211155200,2,157,4.344827586206897
1279589,5,B00003CXMY,"In a quaint Cornish village, local matron and horticulturalist Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) finds herself a new widow with an insurmountable pile of debt.  The whole town commiserates with Grace's predicament, but it is Matthew, her gardener (Craig Ferguson), who comes up with a sure-fire plot to raise money for both of them:  He will take his few, sickly pot plants to her fancy greenhouse, grow the plants with hydroponics, and make a fortune for both of them!

This really sweet and funny comedy was written, produced by, and stars the irrepressible Craig Ferguson, of late night TV fame.  He's quite charming as the gardener who tries to help Grace get back on her feet, financially and emotionally.  Brenda Blethyn is perfect as the respectable lady who's all business when it comes to saving her manor and even goes to a London street market to peddle her wares.

The local folk are delightfully eccentric and there's a lot of homey appeal that makes you root for Grace and Matthew regardless of the legalities.  The pace grows quite chaotic toward the end with sinister drug dealers, bankers, the police, and the entire town converging on Grace's greenhouse, and the ending is odd, but this well-made little gem is full of laughs.",1209772800,4,1243,4.890476190476191

I watched this in 2 sittings, and the first few minutes I found it to be a rather well done mystery/drama where the main character of Grace woke up one morning to find her husband dead, and the estate is in a shambles as her late husband didn't share with her what was going on, so while some might find this creative I found it to be rather stupid. I would have rather seen it kind of like a ""Mrs. Wiggs of The Cabbage Patch"" where her friends and neighbors secretly take care of her needs to get her back on her feet, but what do I get? she begins to grow marijuana in her greenhouse to sell to keep her house. While I didn't like this storyline I do understand that when a man, or woman is suddenly widowed at such a young age they tend to go off in different directions trying to get his/her life back on track. Mind you if there's a divorce the same steps are taken, but different things happen.

1279752,5,B00003CXMY,"This is a fall-off- the-couch funny film, and one you might as well buy, because you are going to watch it again and again for the silliness and comfort.  For Craig Ferguson fans, it's a must -own. Tcheky Karyo fans will chortle as he pops up yet again where least anticipated.

Newly widowed Grace (pertly played by Brenda Blethyn) finds her dissolute husband has left her nothing but debt; creditors and re-possessors now besiege her lovely Cornish seaside home. As she seeks solace in tending her greenhouse orchids, she ponders how to get out of the financial quagmire.  For distraction she charitably tends to her feckless caretaker (Craig Ferguson)'s ailing personal-use cannabis plot, and a joint venture blooms.

As Grace and Matthew modify the greenhouse, cultivate the crop, and go to market, hilarity, as they say, ensues. The villagers - all characters we wish were in our local pub - are perfection as they feign ignorance of the entire enterprise, while quietly lending unseen support to their beloved neighbor. No one is as he or she initially seems, and the various `reveals' in the subplots are charming and delightful. There is much 70's style stoner humor, but with an updated, wonderful, and uniquely British twist.

Obligatory ""locals inadvertently get stoned"" sequences are not only original in their construction but, somehow, innocent and sweet. The ladies and the corn flakes scene is certainly one of the finest pieces of physical comedy ever put on film. And as the story progresses, it evolves from a tale of potentially puerile marijuana mishaps to, instead, one of the power of love and redemption as Grace and Matthew each find their salvation in the unfolding of a future neither of them foresaw. The ending is pure bliss, and an absolute upper.

""Do you have a stock portfolio?"" he asks her ""No, what's that?"" she asks. ""I don't know, I just thought you might have one"" he replies.  Grace, who grows orchids, finds out that her gardener Matthew (Craig Ferguson) grows marijuana, and has the idea of going in for large scale production in her greenhouse.  They go shopping for supplies at the local DIY centre and meet the bank manager with his gorgeous Scandanavian boyfriend. ""He doesn't talk much"" the bank manager explains, ""Does he have to?"" Grace asks.

Soon the marijuana is flourishing, and Grace needs to find a dealer to sell it to.  She insists on going to London to look for one herself, since she has found out that Matthew's girlfriend is pregnant, and she doesn't want him to risk going to jail.  She is hopelessly unsuccesful at finding a dealer, she looks far too respectable.  so she enlists the help of her husband's mistress, a sophisticated Londoner, who puts her in touch with a dealer.  He's not big time enough to buy all Grace's plants, but he finds her someone who can, a rich powerful Frenchman who also happens to be extremely gorgeous.  Meanwhile Matthew and the local doctor (Martin Clunes) have followed Grace to London to try and protect her.  Back in Cornwall, the two innocent old ladies who keep the village shop are drinking what they think is tea that they have taken from Grace's greenhouse and are getting very high.  Soon everyone is heading back to Cornwall for the hilarious climax of the film.

Since Grace has no job skills and no where else to go, she ends up growing and selling marijuana with the help of her gardner (who is a casual marijuana smoker) to pay her bills! I have read of people who lived in costal towns in places like England who would participate in smuggling to avoid tariffs to better themselves and their communities. This film seems to take from that idea since many in the town where Grace lives know about what she is doing. What I loved is the seeming innocence and sweetness on the part of Grace while doing what she does. The whole movie itself is a testament to the idiocy of the war on (some) drugs as well as a hilarious comedy that has an unlikely happy ending.

1279884,2,B00003CXMY,"Saving Grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the 'How to Ruin an Adequate Film in the Final Few Minutes' award.  Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village - largely populated by retired genteel ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of silliness will ensue.  However, the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny.  It is a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998's Waking Ned Devine, which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation.
The protagonist of Saving Grace is middle-aged, recently widowed Grace Trevethyn, whose husband's legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money.  Helped by her gardener, Matthew, she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana.  Unfortunately, this leads her into confrontation with the local police, her husband's creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously.  The relationship and rapport between Grace and Matthew is well-portrayed, and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character - you can really feel what she is going through.
The casting of the minor roles is excellent, even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric.  However, the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all.  And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing?  Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants.",1076803200,7,1802,4.98
1279885,3,B00003CXMY,"The Grace in ""Saving Grace"" is a penniless widow as her scumbag husband commits suicide (bad debts, it is suggested.) She is at her wit's end trying to pony up all the dough needed to settle the string of debts that he has left her with. Middle aged, and her only possible ticket to self-independence her gardening skills, she turns to growing weed to pay the bills.
The theme is promising, the screenplay is gorgeous (although a bit too tinted film in nature scenes, Scotland would've been breathtaking as it is!), the background score is pretty crisp, and the ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn doesn't disappoint. The movie also has a good deal of light-hearted moments, and you can imagine people in a theatre bursting into guffaws quite frequently.
Problem is that the material is sitcom-thin. There's even a doozy scene where Grace asks her young gardener to 'give her one' (.........) which he mistakes as a request for ...... Halfway through the movie you lose a sense of what the movie intended to be -- the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke images of classy noir, and then that whole aura is dropped with a thud amidst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk.
But my biggest gripe with the movie is the absolutely lacklustre denouement, quite clearly a desparate attempt to tug at your heart-strings. Looks like there simply was no way to end the whole charade of ......., so the ""good guys"" moral twist goes up in flames, quite literally.
Definitley worth a watch, heck I even strongly recommend it for the character development and the typical cornwall humor throughout the entire movie, as long as you don't let the last 10 minutes spoil your taste.

He hesitantly comes to her for green thumb advice - and she sees a way out of her debt. The rest? Well, I'm sorry: you'll just have to see the movie. But suffice it to say that you won't regret it.

Her gardener, a nice young man in a shaky relationship, turns to her for her expertise in helping a small plant he has been trying to grow under cover behind the parish.

marihuana in the first place... Also, I know some people (not many, addmitingly) who don't need drugs (or alcohol) to get high. They're craziest
(and funniest) when they're clean (and sober). Therefore, do you REALLY need chemical fuel to get you off the ground? Anyway, the movie is a
relaxed, easy going comedy. Typically and refreshingly British. With some really beautiful shots of North England (or Scotland?) coast and some
romantic scenes of colorful living in a sleepy fishermen village. It was good to see Brenda Blethyn in a good form, she carries the movie on her

Normally I'm the type of movie goer who labors ad infinitum over the implications of each character's actions, and certainly the underlying drug theme might well have brought out that tendency with a vengeance, but in viewing Saving Grace, I was so beguiled by the charm of the village and it's delightful residents that I was able to suspend criticality and just enjoy my ""visit.""
The venue of the story is a colorful coastal village in England.  Though a little bleak, the surrounding country side is open and green, with wonderful vistas of the sea, and the village is a cluster of quaint, old, stone buildings along narrow, little streets.  The title character, Grace, is the lady of the local manor and presides graciously over the social activities of her neighborhood.  Her home is a gorgeous vine covered house in the midst of well kept grounds, a home she loves and which she is unknowingly about to lose due to the capricious financial habits of her philandering and recently deceased spouse.  The story turns on Grace's outrageous plans to save her home and the naivety with which she pursues them, assisted or at least abetted by an assortment of delightful neighbors including her gardener, her doctor and even her husband's former mistress.
Grace is played with great skill by Brenda Blethyn.  She's pretty and perky and just at ""that age"" where a women who had been financially independent for most of her life might find it difficult to start anew.  Even as she starts on her ""life of crime""-""I'm going to be a drugs dealer!""--one can't help but cheer her on for her audacity, just as most of her neighbors come to do.  Beset by collection notices with every post, the intrusion of an assessor who arrives as her door to evaluate her house for auction, and phone calls from a persistent London creditor, Grace takes the bull by the horns and bursts-or more properly blunders--onto the drug scene.  Craig Ferguson as her Scottish gardener Matthew, is the perfect instigator, naive enough himself to be funny but opportunist enough to see their approach to saving the manor as viable.
Even though my husband and I are frequently at odds with respect to our film preferences, we both enjoyed this movie.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable and light hearted way to spend an evening.",1016668800,34,2570,4.703786191536748
1279992,4,B00003CXMY,"Craig Ferguson, one of the stars and co-writers of Saving Grace, recently made some interesting comments about critics and comedies. He claimed that the most scathing reviews were reserved for comedies. His feeling was that, when a reviewer found a comedy to be particularly unfunny, he or she tended to write an opinion which implied that those who did find it amusing were intellectually inferior to the writer. I think his point is well taken, although his comments may have been directed as much towards the TV series The Drew Carey Show, on which he is a regular, as they were to Saving Grace. Whatever the case, the movie, while not breaking new ground, is a winner.
Grace Trevethyn's [Brenda Blethyn] troubles are only just beginning when her husband falls to his death. It seems he has left her high and dry, with no money and a huge mortgage on their house. Grace has never paid attention to the business side of life, preferring to devote her time to the cultivating of orchids in her greenhouse. She has no idea what to do about her situation. It is her gardener, Matthew [Craig Ferguson], who inadvertently shows her a possible solution to her plight. He asks her to figure out what's wrong with some plants he is growing secretly behind the local vicar's house. She quickly recognized them as marijuana, but, seeing herself as a sort of plant doctor, she has Matthew bring them to her greenhouse, where they make a miraculous recovery. After Matthew tells her the street value of the pot, Grace decides they can make enough money for her to save her home. Naturally, such a plan is full of pitfalls.
This is a typically British comedy. The setting is a quaint village in Cornwall. It's populated by delightful eccentrics who usually turn a blind eye to certain goings on that might just be a tad illegal. Cornwall, by the way, has a checkered past, having in the past been the smuggling capital of the British Isles. Looking the other way is a tradition there.
Brenda Blethyn is a joy as Grace. Her matronly appearance is counterbalanced by a quick wit and a devilish glint in her eyes. Hers is a character many of us can relate to. Grace lives a peaceful, normal life, except when her back is against the wall. Then she does whatever must be done. Craig Ferguson plays Matthew as a man who is almost, but not quite, ready to become a responsible adult. His is another character many can feel at home with. Also notable are Jamie Foreman as Matthew's down to earth girlfriend, and Tceky Karyo as Jacques, the real drug dealer Grace finds in London.
Saving Grace is actually a rather old-fashioned movie, which is the source of much of its charm. After all, the very public debate over marijuana usage has been going on and on and on for over thirty years now. The subject matter can hardly be considered shocking.",1016409600,2,2826,4.642714570858283

She takes it home, puts it in her greenhouse, and starts selling marijuana to help pay off the bills! What goes on from there is simply hilarious, and you just have to see it!

So why not join up with the gardener, who is just cheeky enough to grow his behind the parsonage, and get the last laugh?  I loved the scene where the townspeople sit out in lawn chairs at night with sunglasses waiting for the manor house to light up in a blaze of ""grow-lights""!  Okay, so the ending gets a bit muddled (why didn't they just sell it themselves and do away with the middle-man??)  But I just loved seeing these prim and proper people getting stoned and seeing what it's all about.  More tasteful than a Cheech and Chong movie, although I saw them all and loved them, too.  It's just that you expect to see two out-of-work guys in the 70's sitting around getting stoned (been there).  What you don't expect is the Lady of the Manor turning the greenhouse into a pot manufacturing plant!  Lots of laughs, stoned or not!  Don't miss it!",1003795200,5,1004,4.461538461538462
1279997,4,B00003CXMY,"""Saving Grace"" tells the story of a fairly prim British widow (played by Brenda Blethyn) who, after finding that her irresponsible late husband has left her impoverished, decides to grow marijuana to pay off the debts. Much sneakiness and hilarity results as she enters into a partnership with a transplanted Scotsman to pull the caper off.
""Saving Grace"" has its flaws: some of the plot turns are hard to swallow, and the ending sequence feels awkwardly tacked on. But a terrific ensemble cast, led by the wonderful Blethyn, helps make up for any flaws in the script. There is some sparkling dialogue, including a hilarious literary debate on the relative merits of Franz Kafka and Jackie Collins. And one character's pub tirade had me laughing so hard I was literally in tears.
The marijuana-related humor will, I'm sure, not be to everyone's taste. But the film has a good-heartedness and wit that may win over even those with strong ""Just say No!"" tendencies. Give ""Grace"" a try.",1002844800,,983,4.892215568862276
1279998,4,B00003CXMY,"I generally try to avoid movies that want to be the next Full Monty, which this one pretty much does.  That said, this one is good.  Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson  are wonderful actors and the supporting cast is very good as well.  The movie is funny throughout and, though there's an inevitable touch of the ridiculous, it never overbalances into pure farce.  Rather, the characters remain believable enough that even the less believable parts of the plot are pulled off, right up to the end anyway.  I did think the end got to be a little too much, like they'd got themselves into a bind and had to take a slightly cheap way out.",1002672000,2,635,4.478260869565218

Grace is played by Brenda Blethyn, as usual a delight, who is a widow who is about to lose her house.  Until a gardener (Craig Ferguson from the Drew Carey Show, who also co wrote/produced this movie) gets her in a scheme to grow hemp in her greenhouse.  The climax is uproariously funny (the two tea drinking lades steal  they're scene) as well is much of the rest of the film.

Poor Grace was left destitute after the death of her ne'er do well husband. She never suspected that her lovely lifestyle in a Cornwall village was being financed by borrowed money.
How Grace solves her problem, with the help of her faithful gardener and her husband's mistress, keeps you entertained for almost two hours. And you learn something about hydroponic gardening at the same time!

I've recommended it to customers since it has something for everyone-comedy, drama, & just a teensy bit of suspense at the end.

1280085,4,B00003CXMY,"This droll English comedy kept me enchanted and amused throughout.  Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) is widowed by her husband when he takes a flying leap out of an airplane without a parachute.  Upon putting their affairs in order, she discovers that he spent all their money and mortgaged the estate leaving her penniless and steeply in debt.  In a last ditch effort to save the estate, she hits upon the idea of using her hothouse and her considerable skills with plants to grow and sell high quality marijuana.  Thus, the formerly wealthy widow collaborates with her gardener to grow and process the weed and attempt to bring it to market.  The results are often hilarious, especially her negotiations with the drug kingpin and the reactions of the local residents.
The film is well directed and written with numerous funny situations throughout.  Director Nigel Cole keeps the pace brisk and works well with the actors to produce a good deal of physical comedy laced with comical reaction scenes by various characters.  He also treats us to some terrific locations that show off the wonderful English countryside.  The acting is excellent, especially by Brenda Blethyn, who is quite humorous as the fish out of water determined to make her way in the drug culture.  She has a quality that makes her equally believable as a proper English aristocrat and a common conniver.  Craig Ferguson is also good as her partner in crime, a hapless fellow whose harebrained ideas are always getting him into trouble.
The story is not very original, the film having thematic similarities to numerous British comedies of the recent past (""Waking Ned Devine"", ""The Full Monty""), however one can do worse than imitate the success of these films.  I rated it an 8/10.  Overall, it is quaint, entertaining and enjoyable.  For those looking for a light film that will tickle them, this is an excellent choice.",980208000,3,1894,4.936908517350158

The performers are obviously talented, and the story is captivating enough to hold one's interest.  There is a little twist near the end, with the drug dealer, that I didn't see coming.  It was a nice change.  (Is that the same guy who played Meg Ryan's ex-beau in ADDICTED TO LOVE?  Hmm, he looks a lot better in this flick.)
Bottom line:  Looking for funny Brits?  Rent WAKING NED DEVINE.  Looking for quirky Scots?  Get LOCAL HERO.  Both of those already out?  Try SAVING GRACE.",979257600,,646,4.372881355932203
1280087,5,B00003CXMY,"Saving Grace is an old fashioned British romp in the tradition of Faulty Towers or some of the other great British TV imported over the years by PBS. Grace's (Brenda Blethyn) husband has just died in an improbable manner and left her with some improbable problems, viz. a very large house with a very large mortgage and a very beautiful mistress. The very proper Grace has always tended to the house and in particular is known as a champion gardener. She has no idea what to do as she is slowly advised of the depth of her financial problems. But like a proper Brit she doesn't despair and before long her Scottish handyman turns to her for help in improving his meager home-use marijuana crop, and the plot is set.
Grace takes a plant cutting home and soon has it looking green and bountifully budful. She inquires about the price one could get for such a plant and when she hears the answer it seems like gardening could, indeed, be her salvation. You can almost see the gears working in this wonderful actress' head! From initial dawning we go to full scale production while dodging the local constable, the bank owner, the vicar and yet the whole town knows what's going on. Then we move into the distribution phase complete with drug dealers in London, chase scenes and farce. And, should I say, amid much laughter. If you don't laugh at this movie, you best check your pulse. There is a romantic side plot having to do with the handyman's fisherman girlfriend who is pregnant as well as the mystery of the hidden life of the dead husband.
The movie was filmed in the Cornwall area and has some beautiful shots of that part of the world as the land cavorts with the sea. The acting is flawless and rendered with both restraint and energy at the appropriate time. You probably wouldn't need language to ""get"" this movie as much of the humor is physical. However, the actors do all speak English, that language that keeps us separated, and after you get your American ear tuned in you can understand the dialogue without difficulty. There is, of course, a bit of a moral dilemma here, what they are doing is after-all against the law, but that tension is settled in a satisfactory manner leading to an acceptable end just when you though movies could no longer end acceptably.",979084800,16,2279,4.588235294117647
