2307349,5,B0009OUBD8,"ten stars easy.just go to show you again how i agree the ostensible court system for the INNOCENT and for GOOD loving parents works. As for children being falsely accused. as the length some crooked cop to caseworker for cps will go to""win or make a case""is unconstitutional downright CRIMINAL.All should be ARRESTED when such inequities,to the INNOCENT is taken place. The Interview is abhorrent and the officer who conducted such illegality involving the young boy should've been in jail,fired,reprimand,sued everything.
as, here is a distraught beyond hurt in shock,loving mother and dad,yet being treated as a criminal.

I mean just look at the parent...
She literally imploring the police to let her see her surviving kids but yet they are so misleading her,lieing to her,being so offensively intrusive,while the REAL suspect,running out there free. The System from Child Protection Service falsity and utilizing such fraud on court to remove un-abuse children from FIT good homes to the horrid abhorrent police""investigation""as portray in THIS GREAT MOVIE,depict just why so many more innocent loving good americans are going to be more""on guard""of their families,their life when it come to really being able to ""trust our judicial system""
as it has fail this good family in the most abhorrent way. Alley Sheedy Was so great.
such a realistic natural woman portraying the mother,i love her since 80s movies and 90s.love her.great actin overall but she stand out to me,i love her,great movie IMO for all ages to watch and LEARN....

2307350,5,B0009OUBD8,"I had already seen this movie even before buying it. To me this shows how easy it is for anyone with a badge can abuse there power and not have to be
  punished for there actions. There is a few that shouldn't be allowed to wear a badge or work in the legal system because they use there power to bully
anyone they feel like just to close a case that they have now proof to who really did the crime. We need to reform our legal system so that no matter if
  someones child is 18 or younger a parent or lawyer should be there before they can be questioned. And any officer or da that breaks this law should be
  disbarred as soon as proof is there and all interrogations should be video taped.",1295481600,3,692,4.051470588235294
2307351,5,B0009OUBD8,"I recently saw this movie on tv and liked it so much that I ordered a copy from Amazon.  Michael Crowe was questioned by the police in the disappearance of his older sister.  The questioning turned into a marathon ordeal that essentially ""brain washed"" young Michael.  What the police did was absolutely horrible and the officers that did it do not deserve to be police officers. Good acting and the movie holds your interest through out.",1292630400,,438,4.7368421052631575
2307352,5,B0009OUBD8,"I was very pleased with this film it was amazingly done and I would recommend to everyone.
The horrifying true story of the Crowe family whose 12-year-old daughter, Stephanie, is brutally stabled while asleep in her own bedroom. As the family struggled to dissect the painful evidence of their daughter's death, the police pinpoint their prime suspect - her brother, Michael. Every tactic at the police's disposal is used to manipulate and bully Michael into confessing to the gruesome crime. But, is he truly responsible for her vicious death? The Interrogation of Michael Crowe stars Ally Sheedy

An original movie for Court TV, THE INTERROGATION OF MICHAEL CROWE is based on the horrifyingly true story of the Californian Crowe family's double-victimization. When 12-year-old Stephanie is stabbed in her sleep, the police working on the investigation turn to the closest suspect: her 14-year-old brother, Michael. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the policemen are doing whatever they can to cajole a confession from the boy, convinced of his guilt by such peripheral evidence as his interest in Dungeons & Dragons. Starring Ally Sheedy (THE BREAKFAST CLUB, HIGH ART) as mom Cheryl Crowe, this tragic tale of injustice sheds light on some of the faults and holes inherent in the judicial system, among which human infallibility takes its place.",1287446400,,1358,5.200913242009133
2307353,1,B0009OUBD8,"This movie is the worst ""True Crime"" movie I have ever seen. I think more than anything because it is a very disturbing and probably factual movie. Frankly I had to finally stop watching it after about a third of the way through. Even if this was most likely how these monstrous police interrogators were (and I am absolutely sure they probably were worse), I got the point early on that the whole family was being harassed and especially Michael. Maybe I enjoy more of a positive light in a movie, but I didn't need SO much demonstration of how awful the police were and can be. I really did get the point early on that there are police investigators out there who don't seek the truth, but seek an early completion of the investigation so they can file their report and go home to dinner. ""Swift"" justice does not always equal ""true"" justice. It would have been much better if they depicted the police harrassment to a lesser point and then showed the eventual true justice that came to this family and the victim. The movie became too boring to continue to watch. I may try again and fast forward through all the evil cop scenes and watch the vindication of Michael. My heart does go out to this family, though and only shows that there are police who let their power get the most of them.",1282348800,,1292,4.432773109243698
2307354,5,B0009OUBD8,"Having just finished watching this heart-wrenching movie on television, I am now motivated to lobby my state legislature to pass a law requiring video taping of all confessions.  According to the information at the end of the movie, only Alaska and Minnesota require that all confessions be video taped.  To see how police interrogators bullied and coerced 14-year-old Michael into making a false confession of killing his sister is a scene of vicious abuse you will never forget.  Please contact your state legislature and lobby for the passage of a video taping law for confessions.",1199577600,14,584,5.126315789473685
2307355,1,B0009OUBD8,I was extremely disappointed in this film.  It is boring and I never completed the entire movie.  This is the first time I ever saw a true story that I wouldn't finish watching.  If I had seen this film beforehand I never would have purchased it.,1176249600,3,246,4.304347826086956
2307356,5,B0009OUBD8,"I teach an elective Law class to juniors and seniors and this was outstanding for dealing with interrogation, rights, etc. The acting was well done, and my students felt they benefitted greatly from researching the case and then seeing the video.",1169164800,10,246,5.024390243902439
2307357,4,B0009OUBD8,"The movie is really terrible - not by its quality but by its content. A teenage girl is murdered in her room during the night. Next day the parents and their two other kids are taken to the police for interrogation. And 14-year old Michael falls under suspicion. From now on the most horrible begins for the family which already has to deal with desperation and grief after the death of their daughter, separation in the police precinct, multiple interrogations and mistrust. Detectives don't care about the truth - they need only a confession from frightened and coursed boy. And we all know cops can get a confession if they REALLY want to...

The movie demonstrates quite vividly how the juridical system works (and I'm pretty sure not only in the U.S. but in the whole world) and this demonstration frightens. It frightens you a lot. While watching you experience everything that's going on just like it happens to you and feel real pain, anger and despair. Much of it because of a compelling actors' work.

Now we get quite an understandable explanation why most people don't like cops - because those who have power often use it not to help us as they ought to but to make their own work easier. To me the most significant were the father's words in the end of the film: ""What are we supposed to do now if something happens? Call emergency? THOSE cops?""

Looks like our world is the place where you can't expect help from those whose job is to help. We just have to hope nothing bad happens at all. ""The Interrogation of Michael Crowe"" is very truthful and strong piece of work. Don't miss it.",1131062400,20,1599,4.564459930313589
2307358,5,B0009OUBD8,"I watched the Court TV documentary on this case before I watched this movie, and it was CRIMINAL what they did to this young boy.

2307360,3,B0009OUBD8,"A bit boring but at least accurate. I watched a documentary on Youtube that I found to be better called Miscarriages/Travesty of justice ~ Michael Crowe Case - Coerced Confession. I will say one thing, all of the interrogations were pretty much word-for-word the real thing from the police tapes. The more I watched the angrier I became at the way this young boy was abused, and brainwashed into thinking he could have done this to his sister.",1519862400,,443,4.6923076923076925
2307361,5,B0009OUBD8,"In my opinion this case shouldn't happened in the interrogation room. Whoever interrogate Michael Crowe was coursed him with intimidation. They have videotaped it but I think they unplug the camera so they can abuse this child verbally and emotionally. Also they intimidated two other children. Whoever did this should be ashamed of themselves. They should have been in prison. Amazingly Ally Sheedy was in it, she did a marvelous performance. It's a terrific true story. Great acting.",1519171200,,485,5.230769230769231
2307362,5,B0009OUBD8,I can barely stomach watching this.  I'm so ashamed of our justice system.,1519171200,,74,4.6923076923076925
2307363,4,B0009OUBD8,"Very sad the police can lie to the children who we tell' ""the police are there to help you"". Had this been me, an adult I think I would confess also because from pure exhaustion.  This child should have been given rest instead he was kept awake to the point he couldn't think straight.  Our justice system often has no justice. This story has opened my eyes to just how pathetic our police departments are. In my life time of 68 years I have lost respect for the uniform.  Once many years ago my children and I were being terrorized by someone.  I didn't have any idea who it could be. I called the police to my home as soon as it began.  The police told me when I find out who it is to call them back.  I asked if they could drive by a couple of times during the rest of the night and I was told again, when I find out who it is to call them.  They refused to file a report.  Cops seem to be either overzealous or unconcerned and to lazy to write a report.  In this movie you see overzealous in action.",1517356800,,1003,4.0
2307364,5,B0009OUBD8,Parents need to watch this and realize exactly what techniques are used on our children by our police.

2307371,5,B0009OUBD8,"After several reviews of this DVD I have secured more copies and sent them to other professionals because this True Story is an actual example of ""Witch Hunting"" techniques used in the Salem Witch Hunts of 1692, the terror of the McCarthy Hearings during the 1950s and the massacres of innocents  by DAs who allow their Detectives to conquer and subdue with ""Theory"" not ""Fact.""  The murder of any young pre-teen girl is tragic, but equally terrifying is the false accusations of 3 innocent boys on the threshold of puberty?!  In addition due to the raw use of power by law enforcement, 3 families and their young Sons had their lives terrorized by false allegations of domestic violence.  I would dare to challenge Mericopa and San Diego Law Enforcement to realize they committed multiple violations of an International Treaty signed by the USA and 114 Countries known as the Nuremberg Code of 1947.  At those international war crime trials (IWCT) the Code aggressively condemned the SA and SS of Nazi Germany - as well as the German Judges and Authorities for their failure to deliver the order of law based on the Natural Law (Universal Principle of Right and Wrong).  The Nuremberg Code rightly condemned Social Eugenics with a Doctrine of Attrition - a select group set aside to be exterminated despite guilt or innocence.  Michael Crowe and his 2 boyfriends - and their Fathers too - were being condemned by Detectives and the DAs on the theory the boys ""concocted"" the murder because of Dungeon and Dragon games; those penchants of the boys was influenced by negative behaviors of their adult parents and guardians.  The failure to videotape all proceedings - before and after charge a suspect with a crime
gives DAs and their Detectives high octane immunity for low grade theoretical practices in fantasy land?!  The real killer was a mentally ill adult who was reported by the neighbors repeatedly but the Detectives ignored - until the Defense Attorneys demanded DNA tests that forensically proved
blood stains of the victim were found on the sweat shirt of the Perpetrator.  The world should have stood up and applauded the Defense Attorneys who proceeded with litigations for the Defendants when the DAs and Detectives feebly attempted to cover themselves with a ""dismissal without
prejudice""- if allowed to stand, the Defendants could not sue, even though homes were destroyed due to damages caused by Investigators.  The 3 boys - Michael Crowe, Aaron Houser and Josh Treadway - are heroes and their names should be a household word of admiration.  Protection - and exoneration - of the falsely accused from injustice is just as essential as vindication of the victim.  My highest compliments to those families for the courage to go public to bring public attention to the unjust advocacy by law enforcement.  I know people in law enforcement and legal professions who abhor such ""Political Correctness"" advocating a Social Eugenics with a doctrine of attrition!",1432684800,2,2975,4.995951417004049

A sad and shocking look into the minds of some of the low level thinking morons hired by police departments. OMG. Disgraceful. Gives a bad name to the great and intelligent cops out there. This poor family. What hell they went through. Tortured by barbarians with badges who couldn't put the puzzle pieces together and figure out the real killer. Perhaps the saddest part is when the family asks themselves, ""What now? What if we have an emergency and need to call the police? We can't trust them now."" One must wonder how often this happens when injustice is served. How did it go so wrong with Escondido? Were they untrained? Unskilled? Corrupt? Arrogant? Poor leadership? What exactly happened here within Escondido Police Department? Why didn't they pursue the fact the homeless man had been knocking on doors the same night of Stephanie Crowe's murder? Knocking on doors in the same area where she lived? And he was looking for a ""Tracy."" And he had previously stabbed another homeless man? Wow.
