1681933,5,B000060MWT,"In this incredible journey the viewer travels from the outer reaches of space down into the nucleus of a carbon atom.  Cosmic Voyage is able to explain, in layman's terms, the theory of how the universe began - the ""Big Bang"" and how the entire mass of the universe could have been compressed into a space the size of a tennis ball.  Parallel worlds?  Life on other planets?  Cosmic Voyage answers all these questions.  Teachers will rate this film five stars and a must have for the classroom.",989452800,24,494,4.568181818181818
1681974,5,B000060MWT,"First of all, it arrived in excellent condition.  I have watched it multiple times as it provides profound perspective concerning our place in the universe!

1681979,5,B000060MWT,"The script and the music are absolutely phenomenal. Although, the graphics could stand with a bit of an upgrade, I would absolutely recommend this disk for any person interested in astronomy or cosmology. Happy viewing.",1301616000,,219,5.285714285714286
1681980,5,B000060MWT,"Science is about everybody understanding phenomena. It is a tough ask when these range from the smallest objects known to whole the observable universe. The DVD succeeds brilliantly in bringing them all together.

The universe is a big place, of that there is no doubt. If you think of it in terms of distances appropriate to the living room, or even the journeys of the fastest airplanes, you are going to get your mind boggled. But astronomers do not think like that, they think in distances appropriate to the objects they are studying. Now as the distances become bigger you see different objects; close up you see only the trees but further away you see the whole wood. It is an old idea.

The DVD demonstrates how the phenomena unfold as the distances get larger without getting lost in the math. It takes you from a one meter hula hoop ring, to the earth, then onto the solar system, out to the stars, the galaxy, the local group and then onto the large scale structure of the universe. Once you do that you have to get to grips with the expanding universe, and then the inevitable conclusion that it all started very small at the big bang. So now the DVD takes you to the very small and how the latest experiments tie the very small up with the very large.

To present these fundamental scientific ideas, and be entertaining as well, requires all the tricks of theater. Superlative narration by Morgan Freeman, stunning photography from the various space telescopes, never before created special effects and appropriate music to set the mood are but a few of the techniques employed. It is not the only approach. If you want to know about the objects watch ""The Universe"", if you want to be mind boggled look at ""Journey to the Edge of the Universe"" but if you want an accessible and fun explanation of your place in the universe ""Cosmic Voyage"" is far and away the best offering to date. The DVD is great, on IMAX it must have been truly stunning.",1293753600,,1956,4.566951566951567
1681981,5,B000060MWT,"This is a great film to teach all of us about powers of 10--probably one of the best experiential IMAX productions to showcase ""magnitude.""  The best learning is experiential, right?",1281830400,,182,5.066666666666666
1681982,4,B000060MWT,"The classic educational film ""Powers of Ten"" that originated in the astronomy department at Princeton University in the 1960s and which I originally saw in a college English class in the early 1970s, had such a profound impact that it has been remade and updated a number of times since then.  This latest incarnation adds more background about how the mysteries of the universe and our knowledge of all the vastness of creation got discovered, plus updated with 21st century knowledge.  It is an absolutely fascinating exploration of the wonders of the universe both from a macro (galactic) point of view and a micro (cellular) point of view and, given that it's a short film, should be viewed by everyone at least once.",1264291200,,721,4.853658536585366

1682007,2,B000060MWT,"I bought this for a gift for my husband, who loves reading about the universe in all its glory and mystery - the planets, the stars, black holes, galaxies, etc.  However, this short IMAX film has very little to do with the universe!  The title is totally misleading.  It ought to have been titled ""speculation on the origin of man and the universe"" for the vast majority of the time all we heard was ""somehow life developed....blah, blah, blah"".  We didn't want to hear about the big bang theory.  I had hoped the film would deal with facts, not speculation.  I was very disappointed, and so was my husband.
Also, I've seen many IMAX films and this one didn't have the ""wow"" factor that other IMAX films have had.
I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1) because it had good music and Morgan Freeman did a fine job of narrating.
If you want a film about the universe that deals with facts, and shows actual photos, then I would NOT recommend this film.  It proved to be a big disappointment, and I'm glad I didn't pay a lot of money for it (or I'd be even more disappointed).",1230249600,2,1067,4.331658291457287
1682008,1,B000060MWT,"I saw Cosmic Voyage on cable and it was awesome in high def. I received my ordered copy and the IMAX version was not in high def, in fact the quality of the DVD was so poor that I thought maybe this was a counterfitted copy. I did not enjoy it at all and this worthless DVD went to the trash. I think that it was unfair not to disclose the fact that the DVD was not in high def.",1212019200,4,378,3.7375
1682009,5,B000060MWT,If you ever saw the vintage video on the power of ten you will really like this updated version. With updated special effects and great photography this is definitely a voyage. Morgan Freeman as narrator is excellent and provides a lot of awe as you journey from one power of ten to another.,1207785600,,291,4.509433962264151
1682010,5,B000060MWT,"Many years ago I watched a very similar film during an IBM event. During this time I always wanted to have a copy of it. Recently I looked for such a film in Amazon and... I found this one, which is better than the initial!

It is really a super excellent video.",1207353600,,262,4.038461538461538
1682011,5,B000060MWT,I was so surprised at this DVD. Everything about it is topnotch and my jaw dropped several times.  My only gripes are that there are no chapter breaks and little in the way extras.,1194998400,,180,4.294117647058823

1682044,5,B000060MWT,"and that is to whet the viewer's interest reminiscent of a more detailed mini-series like Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" or Neil deGrasse Tyson's ""Origins.""  The video is concise and, very early, provides an excellent point of reference (literally) for those without any background regarding the universal and atomic scale.

Morgan Freeman comes through, as always, with his narration in a manner that provides an even and well paced presentation of the macro- and microscopic world.  And while he doesn't have the trance-inducing voice of James Earl Jones, he skillfully manages to hold your attention even between the segments of the program that are nothing but spellbinding, which brings me to another point.

The images and computer generated sequences are done very well with especial care taken to faithfully represent the true scale and detail of the cosmos.  The music fits well and affords a nice emotional complement to the eye candy.  I'm sure many will agree with me that the best part of the entire program is the ultra quick zoom-in from the superclusters (largest scale of video) to the quarks comprising the neutrons and protons of the atom's nucleus (smallest scale).  My only complaint concerning the zoom-in (and the whole video for that matter) is that the camera seems to ""back up"" during the zooming.  This takes place (33min. 5sec. into program) when the camera comes upon a tree, into its leaves, into a leaf's veins, AND SUDDENLY!!, you're coming upon a creek with reeds, into the reeds, into a drop of water on the reed etc...  An obvious editing mistake.

The mistake notwithstanding, this is an excellent video that quickly, though not rushing-ly, engages its audience---not with the intention to explicity educate on all the details so much as to introduce the viewer (in a very effective way!!) to what big and small really are.

No pretenses.  It is what it says it is.  A Cosmic Voyage.",1152662400,13,1910,4.968553459119497
1682045,2,B000060MWT,"This movie does give viewers a general idea of the universe, in a very conservative sense.  It only contains material and topics based on traditional big bang theory.  Personally, I disagree with alot of ideas presented in the movie.  I think since this movie is relatively new (2002) and not created back in the 70's or 80's, it should atleast contain new discoverys and new theories such as Super String Theory.  Therefore, I do not recommand this movie if you are seeking to learn new knowledge, as far as I can tell, the movie is based on stuff we knew back in the 80's.  However, I would definitely recommand the following: (1)The Elegant Universe (by NOVA,PBS) and (2)Origins (by NOVA,PBS) Both are very very good!!",1137888000,19,721,4.736
1682046,4,B000060MWT,Utilizo este video para que mis alumnos comprendan las dimensiones del Universo y he tenido muy buenos resutados. No se requieren conocimientos amplios de astronoma pues las explicaciones son bastante claras y con muy buen estilo.,1124323200,3,230,5.416666666666667
1682047,3,B000060MWT,"This IMAX offering presents us with not only one but two journeys - one in space (going from the entire universe to quarks) and one in time (going from the first cells to human beings). These are both monumental enterprises, but unfortunately this half-hour movie can only offer us an inkling of either. It presents some beautiful images, although the journeys themselves lose much in the translation to the TV screen. Only recommended for those who want some relaxation.",1117411200,8,471,4.974683544303797
1682048,5,B000060MWT,"I have used this DVD for the past several years in my science classes.  After introducing my students to the metric system, and doing labs to reinforce this new concept, I show COSMIC VOYAGE as a culmination to the metric system, and as an introduction to the Astronomy Unit.  The metric system is based on Powers of Ten.  The scene that starts in Venice and expands outward into space by powers of ten is effective for my students.  Conversely, to watch a water droplet and decrease by powers of ten is also important for students to see.  After watching this, my students are jazzed and can't wait to learn about the universe.  At the end of the school year, many cite COSMIC VOYAGE as one of their favorite DVD's and the Astronomy Unit as one of their favorite units.",1092787200,25,770,4.503597122302159
1682049,2,B000060MWT,"While I realize that this DVD is IMAX and therefore intended for broad audiences who may or may not be familiar with scientific terminology, I do feel this offering has been too dumbed down to be enjoyable for adults. I would recommend it for an elementary or junior high school class-- maybe even an introduction to astronomy class, but for someone who wants to see space, this is not the DVD to buy. ""Cosmic Voyage"" is a misleading title, as there is very little space to be seen and far too much on-the-ground footage. Equally appalling is the 36 minute duration of the video. This is far too short a time in which to adequately cover all the concepts the back of the DVD box promises. All in all, I was bored and frustrated at the amount of money paid for something so short and unimpressive.",1074211200,16,796,4.458904109589041
1682050,1,B000060MWT,"I have seen a number of IMAX pictures and this has got to be one of the worst.  From the cartoon like animation to the lack of information, I would have to suggest that this DVD is a waste of time and money.",1072656000,2,207,3.813953488372093
1682051,3,B000060MWT,"This movie is a brief one, which hurls you from the earth into the universe at the speed of light, then in a millisecond, you are yanked back to the smallest particles on earth.  This movie is too short, and certainly not spectacular enough to make you feel as if it was worth your money.  It doesn't cover enough information about the universe, nor anything else.  It barely spends any time with animations of the universe, and shows too many scenes of regular earth dwelling places and things, such as the scene in Venice, a supposed lead up to nothing, which takes up half of the movie.  And the animations aren't that great, I've seen better on the Discovery channel. This movie gets you thirsty for science, and leaves you uneducated, and longing for more.  If there is another  movie out there, I suggest buying it over this one.",1062460800,13,835,4.570469798657718
1682052,1,B000060MWT,"I thought this DVD was a real BORE! In fact I have watched it twice and dozed off both times. This is a DVD for a classroom (science) at a high school, or junior high level. I was hoping to see some great space footage but instead got second rate animations and graphics. (Although I agree with one of the other reviewers M. Freeman is good narrator)
In the special features area of the DVD, hearing the producers, writers, artists EXTOL what a cutting edge, masterpeice, thrill, etc etc this is ....PLEASE give me a break. SAVE your money...do yourself a favor and purchase IMAX 'Blue Planet' or 'Dream is Alive'!",1059350400,9,614,4.54054054054054
1682083,4,B000060MWT,"What does the universe look like at the scale of atoms, or that of galaxy superclusters?  What did the early universe look like, and how did it evolve into the cosmos we know today?  What other life may have evolved and be wondering about our universe as we do?
These are deep questions, and no short film can possibly do them all complete justice.  Instead, in its 35 minutes, Cosmic Voyage flies through a summary of what we know--just enough to whet your appetite for more.
Starting in Galileo's Venice, with familiar everyday scales of time and space, the IMAX film employs a common technique: expanding our perspective by successive factors of 10, until the screen encompasses the largest structures scientists know of today, and our own Earth is utterly lost in the deep expanse.  A similar voyage takes us from the waterways of the Netherlands down into the nucleus of the atom, where (somewhat paradoxically) our knowledge comes from some of the largest experiments in the world.
The simulation of the early universe and the numerous galactic collisions is especially awe-inspiring.  Usually, documentaries of this sort employ artists to bring the words of astrophysics journals to life; Cosmic Voyage was the first movie to make use of scientific computing and cosmic simulations on such a large scale.  The sequence was computed under the direction of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), which also had an early hand in popularizing the World Wide Web.  The result is an accurate and breathtaking depiction of how the oldest and largest parts of cosmic architecture took shape.
The temptation with any such documentary is to compare it to Cosmos, the PBS documentary hosted by Carl Sagan that ran in 1980.  But the comparison is unfair.  Sagan had 13 hour-long episodes, with a sweep at once broader and deeper than anything since.  With only 5 percent of the length, Cosmis Voyage can't expect to duplicate that sweep, and to its credit, it doesn't try.  It just stuns you with its imagery and inspires you to find out more, and it does so without straying from scientific accuracy.  Provided you keep in mind the length and scope of the film, you won't be disappointed.",1056326400,48,2205,4.92972972972973
1682084,2,B000060MWT,Fails to engage the imagination and has VERY little to offer in terms of physics or otherwise.  Two stars go to Morgan Freeman's soothing narrative.

1682085,2,B000060MWT,"Anyone expecting a ""Cosmos"" type of voyage, like I did, is going to be sadly disapointed.  The actual voyage thru the universe is only about 5 minutes in length, and compared to the fantastic visuals in the movie ""Cosmos"" is like a Saturday morning cartoon.",1047772800,6,257,4.711111111111111
1682086,5,B000060MWT,"I first saw this film in an OMNIMAX theatre at the Vancouver Science centre and was very impressed. When I saw it was available on DVD it was a 'must have' addition to my Home Theatre collection.
OK, so 52 inches of TV isn't quite the 52 FEET of IMAX, but one still gets the sensation of feeling very, very small as you virtually travel to the outer reaches of the known universe and then feeling very, very big compared to the quarks inside an atom's nucleus.
Brilliant special effects and computer simulations, educational and enjoyable.
My only quirk is that the sound track could have made more use of the 5.1 channels, and for a short film, a DTS-track would have fitted on easily.",1047513600,2,686,4.496

This movie is outstanding in showing pictures of the Earth and outer space. It's vision of going from earth up to the outer regions of space and back is an amazing achivement of special effects. This is one of the older IMAX films and even today it is Top-notch in it's picture quality. The absolut best DVD pcture transfer you can get. Those with big widescreen tv's don't be put off by it's 1:33:1 (standard) format. This is the way it was shot preserving the actual way the film was shot and even if watching in ""Full"" or ""Wide Zoom"" the picture is truley awesome and breathtaking. I watch it in ""Full"" making it feel like I'm at the IMAX theatre.

Morgan Freeman narrates with his lovely, deep voice and keeps the film's slow pace at a more interesting flow. The music is also enchanting and helps it be a smoother ride. I never saw this at the IMAX theatre, but at school on a projecter about 10x smaller than the IMAX. But, nevertheless, it still captivated me and took me far, far away. Cosmic Voyage doesn't delve deep into Astronomical findings or anything excitingly new, but it does give us information that we see everyday and puts a spotlight on it- making our world ever more visible than we imagined.",1041984000,16,727,4.777777777777778

This one is no different in the impression department, but I felt that the overall tone of the video was directed much more towards education than the previous videos.  The text or the narration (performed wonderfully by Morgan Freeman) sounds like it was written for one of those old videos we were forced to watch in science class as kids.  While I always found those videos to be so poorly produced they became boring - this film has such amazing video that you become engrossed in the movie, even with the educational tone.  I would have given it 4 stars because of the educational feel, but after thinking about it for a few minutes, I decided that it still deserved 5.  If you have children, I doubt you could find a better movie to inspire them with science.  If I were a science teacher today, I'd start the term with this video to motivate students who might otherwise shy away from sceince.",1027296000,32,990,4.533707865168539
