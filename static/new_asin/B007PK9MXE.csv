Besides the quality of the film the story line is not like that of the classic apocryphal book Judith. The director bowdlerized the book. He placed an overweight woman as the beautiful Judith, added characters and actions and gave people names not in the book. Most distressing is that Judith is depicted as being attracted to the general she planned to kill and agonized over her attraction at the last moment, another invention by the director or writer. The trick she used to persuade Holofernes - that although God protects the Judeans as long as they obey the divine decrees, but they will soon eat forbidden foods and she will tell the general as soon as this occurs so that he can then vanquish the Judeans in the city of Bethulia - is not even hinted in the film. The characters of Uzziah and Achior - central to the plot - are absent. So too the film makers did not include the event that frightened the Assyrians - the hanging of Holofernes' head on the outside wall off the town. Neither did they give Judith any credit for her idea how to frighten the Assyrians by soldiers standing outside the wall as if they were about to attack the Assyrians.

There is much more that one can critique. It is a shame, as it is with most films made about Bible tales that film-makers feel the need to ""improve"" what generations have enjoyed.",1419897600,5,1572,4.417241379310345
8520352,3,B007PK9MXE,"Visual quality is not well preserved and in need of restoration. The plot is simple and predictable from the first.  Acting is adequate, what you would expect from a film of its era, with an interesting cast, actors who went on to greater things in the silent and sound eras.  Sets are rather simple but the costumes are fun, especially Henry B. Walthall's humungous beard and pointy hat.  Judith of Bethulia is not on the same level as Griffith's later Birth of  a Nation, Intolerance, etc., but nevertheless interesting and worth watching for its value as a piece of cinema history.",1406937600,3,584,4.752475247524752
8520353,2,B007PK9MXE,"This review refers only to the Alpha Home Entertainment DVD [ALP 67670].

I don't usually expect much from bargain label DVDs such as Alpha, but they generally put out titles that would not otherwise be available and occasionally have good-condition prints and/or bonus features worth taking a chance on.

This disc of Judith of Bethulia, however, is one of the worst video releases I've seen since the advent of home video on VHS. All the production values and epic scope of a DW Griffith picture lose their impact when presented in a form this shabby. The print condition is substandard at best. To begin with, the image is so poorly framed that title cards are frequently cut off at the sides. The image is dark, grainy and blurry, often to the point of indistinctness. The print used is itself heavily damaged and looks like a 16mm reduction copy several generations removed from anything that could have been considered watchable.

The 13 minute bonus feature, Griffith's 1912 melodrama The Transformation of Mike, is presented from a somewhat better print and although soft, grainy and s bit damaged, is far more watchable. That's where the 2 star rating goes.

The same tracked in music is used for both features and has nothing to do with anything happening onscreen and sounds like it was patched in at random.",1350172800,12,1319,4.848888888888889
