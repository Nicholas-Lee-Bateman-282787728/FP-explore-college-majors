8626342,2,B00GR9EAVI,"Two stars for great acting by the lead actor who played Theo, but other than that the movie progresses so slow that my attention kept drifting. Maybe it's my impatient American brain that's used to fast pasted plots, but this movie was just too slow for me.",1524960000,,257,4.48936170212766
8626343,5,B00GR9EAVI,"This film surpassed my expectations. It is not shallow like many films today. The plot and story line are deep and full of substance. I actually got more out of it after watching it a secret second time. If you like artsy films with deep meaning, I would highly recommend it.",1489795200,,275,4.411764705882353
8626344,5,B00GR9EAVI,"You never know what you will find when you watch a movie that no one has reviewed. I took a chance on ""the hour of living"" because I was intrigued by the title, I found a treasure - a rare gem. The story is interesting and the soundtrack is fantastic. Together they are like winning the lottery. This is one I will watch over and over again. Hope you like it too.",1483660800,,363,4.055555555555555

8626346,4,B00GR9EAVI,"A young man seeks his long estranged father and finds out about why he left, where he went and what his life is like today. The Dad  who is gay went out to find that part of himself and now reunites with his long lost son. Touching, not soapy. Well done. Great acting. I have had a similar experience as a Dad. Late awareness, coming out. I identified with a lot of it. I did not disappear but many of the feelings are the same. This is from the son's side.",1403308800,,457,4.021978021978022
8626347,2,B00GR9EAVI,"Just finished watching ""The Hour of Living"" released by Optimist Creations Limited.
Graduate Thesis Film came into mind while I was watching this movie - which starts out with a well dressed man staring out into the ocean before he starts walking into it.  His body is discovered presumably by his son, Theo - who is nine years old at the time.
Ten years pass and Theo, now around 19, is orpahned again when his mother passes away.  Amongst her belongings, which are kindly given to him by her mother's boyfriend, is a super eight movie of his father dancing and looking like he's in love with the person who shot the film, which gets accidently incinerated - but not before Theo can use his cell phone to snap of shot of his father in love.
Now here's why I say Graduate Thesis Film:  There is a visible-to-the-viewer-only one man guitar player and singer who acts as the Greek Chorus.
Theo wants to find out who the person is his father was so deeply in love with.  None of his deceassed parents' friends will tell him.  So he does a bit of detective work, including having a chat with a hypochondriac, that gives him a name - George Walter.
Don't break out the hankies quiet yet.  George was in love with Theo's Dad; but it was an unconsumated love because Theo's Dad suffered from manic depression and neither he or George had the courage to act on their unspoken, yet acknowledged love.
George, who just happens to be the author of a cult novel, lives by himself in a mountain retreat.  Theo tracks him down and begins the slow process of drawing out the man who his father loved.
Theo doesn't know what to make of George who seems to have given up on living.  George seems to be also in love with Theo.  Together, the two do move on with their lives until it seems that Theo is fed up with George and pushes them both towards a solution where they part while moving forward with their lives - though the ending is a bit muddled.  There is a mystery man George meets at the end.  Is it an older Theo?  Not really sure.
""The Hour of Living"" could have been so much more.  It presents an intriquing mystery - could have done without the Greek Chorus - that gets derailed by dribbling mindless philosophy.  I'm sure Sebastian Michael, who wrote and starred in this movie, got an A from his professor.
I would have given him a C.
Luke Warm Recommendation.
Two Stars.",1392595200,,2367,4.411494252873563
8626348,5,B00GR9EAVI,"An odd little narrative that pulls you in quickly as you follow young Theo who tries to make sense of his circumstances. The music is also a major contribution by a smooth, yet folksy indie artist Pepe Belmonte ( believe me I've already been trying to find a soundtrack.
Has a touch of gay, but never in your face, or preachy, should work well for a wide audience. Give it a chance A+++",1391126400,,386,4.301369863013699
