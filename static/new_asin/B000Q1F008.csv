8194001,5,B000Q1F008,"Rachael has done it again!  Who wants to spend ALL the time in the kitchen when you can be enjoying the holiday yourself?  New twists on old favorites to speed up the process...and why not serve ""Nothin' to fret about apple fritters, Eggnog-Panettone bread pudding, or Gingerbread Waffles with Mulled maple syrup"" for breakfast or brunch?  ""Toffee Hot Chocolate"" would be good at any time.  ""Holiday spiced nuts"" would be a good giveaway.  These DVDs are chocked full of ideas you can make your own.",1387065600,,499,4.823529411764706
