8454821,1,B000FS2WL2,Really Amazon? Footage of Jim Jones mind controlling people in this outdated movie? Too soon!,1514246400,,93,5.266666666666667
8454822,2,B000FS2WL2,"The back cover of this DVD looks as if it was made in 2006, however it contains very, very old fuzzy and blurry sub-standard footage and less than audible audio quality. Although it covers a wide range of topics, it merely skims over most and really shows nothing new. The ancient footage of Jack Palance and Samantha Eggar, and the Reverend Jim Jones (of the Jonestown massacre) give an idea of how ancient the content of this DVD is. Very disappointing.",1206057600,10,455,4.62962962962963
