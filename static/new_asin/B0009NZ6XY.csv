8434980,5,B0009NZ6XY,"These five clips were made during Steve Earle's brief flirtation with major label success, when MCA Records thought highly enough of him to shoot some videos and send 'em out to the TV folks.  It includes one of his biggest hits, ""Guitar Town,"" as well as ""Someday,"" ""Nowhere Road,"" ""Copperhead Road"" and ""I Ain't Never Satisfied,"" which retells the old Robert Johnson legend, of a man who sold his soul ot the devil in order to become a guitar legend.  For the most part, these videos are pretty low-budget and by-the-numbers, but what's cool is seeing Earle as a young Nashville outsider, before he moved into his biker-ish, leather-clad outlaw persona... He's so fresh-faced and earnest... and so young!  Fans will want to watch him back then, to remember when he was bright-eyed and idealistic... This is a modest video package, but the material is really nice.",1123200000,17,865,4.870748299319728
8434981,4,B0009NZ6XY,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE Steve Earle fan and I really loved this DVD. However, I was hoping for a little more. The only the disc contains is five music videos. They're all of supreme quality, though. I guess I was hoping for maybe behind the scenes stuff or maybe some live footage. All-in-all it's worth the buy at $8.",1123200000,7,325,4.258064516129032
8434982,5,B0009NZ6XY,If you're a Steve Earle fan you have to buy this DVD. It's a video progression of Steve from his clean cut days of Guitar Town to the long hair days of Copperhead Road.  These videos are classics.  Shame on country music television for yanking them off the air.  Kudos to Universal Music and VI for packaging them on a DVD.,1122940800,6,323,4.262295081967213
