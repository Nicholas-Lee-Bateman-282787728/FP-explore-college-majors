1673862,5,B00005V9H0,"this is easily the best skating movie of all time(excluding ""thrill of it all, Modus ',atc) with all the wicked skaters, a million dollar budget and everything i think it is bound to be great, because at the time of this birdhouse had the best ever team easily, apart from old plan b, which means this for sure is a garantee to sucess.....",1018483200,2,339,4.396825396825397
1673863,5,B00005V9H0,"What video has exploding vans, beer guzzling chimps, hardcore porn queens, and a gnarly decapitation?  Why, it's THE END from Birdhouse of course!  Yea, this thing is mostly high concept, but there are a few straight forward themes like Bucky The Psycho killing Tony so that he can be #1.  Hey, be sure to catch Tony's varial 720 on that HUGE ramp!
Steve Berra's beheading was ultra cool, but maybe not for the younger crowd.  It was nice of the CIA guys to drive up and put the head in a bag.  No nudity from the porn girls (darn) but plenty of cleavage (yay)!  Heath and Jeremy get all lit up for a flaming shed grind and 50 foot pier ollie.
There are sub-menus for each skater where you can check out pro-model decks and various old clips.  It's amazing to see what these guys were capable of at an early age.  Heath does a backside 360 double kickflip down some steps and a backside shove-it to frontside 360 shove-it down a ledge!  Willy does a triple kickflip, no problem.  Jeremy ollies over his car, no ramp.  Tony launches from one 5-story building to another, no net.  This stuff is SICK SICK SICK!!!  Enjoy.",1015200000,8,1118,4.421568627450981

7956255,1,B00005V9H0,"The End is one of the best skate videos ever released, but the special edition is horrible.  I was excited to find this DVD and jumped at the opportunity to buy it, as soon as I started watching it though I had to turn it off.  This version is unwatchable if you've seen the original release.  They changed almost all the music and the skaters parts are synchronized to the music so it loses all its magic not having that synchronization.  I literally had to turn it off and stop watching.  I wouldn't even pay $1 for this version but would be more than willing to spend $30 or more for a VHS copy of the original.",1216598400,5,614,4.213675213675214
7956256,4,B00005V9H0,"This video is great and its classic, but what happened to the Under Pressure Song and Willy Santo's old song. I don't think they could get permession to use them and the under pressure song went perfect with the part.",1208304000,6,217,4.45
7956257,5,B00005V9H0,"The End is definitley one of the best skateboarding films ever made. It was probably the first skateboarding movie to have 16mm and 35mm film used in it. The skateboarding in this movie is amazing and original. Especially parts like Reynold's, Hawk's, and... the whole team. If you're a true skateboarder, then this is a skate movie you should own. I loved every part. The DVD features are awesome too. There are tons of special features such as: old and new rider footage, behind the scenes, the making of The End, Pics, and lots more. This is definitley worth your $.",1083888000,,569,4.643564356435643
7956258,5,B00005V9H0,"As a skate video alone, I would most likely give the end 5 stars, but the dvd clearly takes it to that great level.  The video itself interweaves individual skaters' footage with more humorous introductions (some very short, some just as long as the footage itself).  When you talk with your friends about the video, you'll probably mention Andrew Reynolds' beer-drinking monkey or Heath and Jeremy's disastrous van ride, but I think what makes it great (and what should make it great) is the skating itself.  The skits can get old over time and will lose their novelty but the skating is ground-breaking enough to stay with you.  In addition, the dvd really includes a ton of extra material (I especially enjoyed the extra footage with each skater's bio and had a laugh at the chaotic team commentary) that clearly makes this an excellent purchase.",1066435200,,849,4.834482758620689
