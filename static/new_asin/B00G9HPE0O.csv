8621459,3,B00G9HPE0O,DVD had issues and got stuck in my computer. I did not contact seller because I put the DVD away and honestly just forgot about it.,1513555200,,131,4.076923076923077
8621460,1,B00G9HPE0O,"Ordered this and a yoga mat for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She was excited to roll out her mat and start exercising as soon as she opened it. The few minutes of the video that we did see was very poor quality, but she was still enjoying following the instructor. Probably less than 10 minutes in, the picture froze. Unable to play the DVD past that point. She moved on to her other gifts quickly, but I was so happy to see her willing and wanting to exercise. Very disappointed.",1483488000,,494,4.32258064516129
8621461,2,B00G9HPE0O,Disappointed in this video. Appears language is dubbed over and creates dissonance for young kids.  Like calming voice but my 2 kids preferred another video that showed poses better and incorporated kid friendly themes like dinosaurs.  Also didn't like how an adult shows most of the poses and then a kid is switched into the video for short period of time. More kid friendly to show adult and kid together.,1481587200,,407,4.8
