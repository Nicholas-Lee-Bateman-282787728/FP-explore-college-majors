7749993,5,B01FH3FDKQ,"This is one of the best films released this year and should be watched by most.  There are many who sacrifice everything for others, and then forgotten as days,weeks, months, and years pass by. I remember this happening all those years ago, and then forgot about it and went on with my everyday life. It was until I saw the trailer that the overwhelming emotions and sadness came pouring in, like it did when it happened.  But the hardest was part was seeing two great actresses give the performances of a life line. I believe that this is the best performance done by Sonam Kapoor. And with Shabana Azmi having player such a strong role similar to Nerrja's mother only made it more believable. The two bonded like the real life Neerja and her mother, and giving us a film that brings you back to what happens  and draw you in by making you feel you were right there with them.",1464566400,7,877,4.434782608695652
7749994,5,B01FH3FDKQ,"This is the true story about a Pan Am 747 that was hijacked at Karachi Airport in 1986 and how Neerja, the chief purser handles the situation with composed professionalism. It is because of her heroism  that more than 350 passengers were saved. The acting is superb, this is a must see movie.",1463788800,7,292,4.509433962264151

7749998,5,B01FH3FDKQ,"A lot of hijacking films have been made, as well as similar genre terrorist (especially recently) type films, but this is hands down in my mind the most disturbingly realistic of the lot (especially given it's real world backstory). Words do not do it justice. Just another depressing event to add to humanity's list. As an aside I sometimes wonder if in the history of humankind more people have died in the name of religion than have been saved (lives).",1468713600,,455,4.7

8760778,5,B01FH3FDKQ,The movie was beautifully produced and acted. It is a true Hollywood level production with great attention to detail for the time it takes place. It's heartbreaking story was very well told and you really feel deeply for the characters and come to hate the villians. After reading about the real events and the fact that three of the four hijackers were released by the Pakistani military and are still at large only added to the pathos of the narrative. All in all an excellent film and one that speaks to the fact that Bollywood films should be taken very seriously by Hollywood and the Academy.  This film should have been given a wide U.S. release. It would have done exceptionally well.  I didn't even know about it until I read about the hijacking it was based on on Wikipedia.,1535155200,,783,4.585714285714285

8760781,5,B01FH3FDKQ,"i bought this movie because I fly for a living.  Flight Attendant.  Many emotions watching this movie.  What a hero, Neerja was on this fateful day.  Her country is so proud of her to this day.  The movie fully portrays her training and why it helped many passengers and crew survive this hijacking.  Well acted.  Emotional.  Touching moments as well.  Is she a true hero to our aviation community.  WATCH THIS!",1504396800,,411,4.661971830985915
8760782,5,B01FH3FDKQ,"By no means, this is NOT a feel good movie and is NOT for EVERYONE!, it flashbacks between current horrifying experience the main lead female character is going through and the abuse she had faced in her failed marriage. The actress played her character well.
The performances stand out the most and are the highlight of the movie. Specially the antagonists in the movie are so convincing, they create in you an ultimate fear of ever stepping foot in a plane.
I highly don't recommend this to be watched with family, children or those with an existing anxiety or fear of flying, as you will not be able to ever board another plane. The horror is unreal, chilling and brutal. You won't be complaining next time when you go through vigorous security checks in an airport, you will have the patience. Watch it if you want to see excellent performances by all cast members. Do expect to cry, a lot, and experience fear.
What made this movie even more nerve racking was the fact that it's based on actual events. The director somehow has managed to masterfully keep your interest until the end, he is organized and has got all the right camera angles. The script is semi flawless, manages to capture your attention and you feel you are one of the passengers on that plane.
I'm glad that I came across this title which was recommended by another friend, not only you get to see outstanding performances, you come to know about the actual doomed flight and the horror these passengers and crew had to go through. Have to admit prior to this movie I had not heard about the heroic young flight attendant and the sacrifices she made on that day.",1501200000,2,1636,4.587030716723549
8760783,5,B01FH3FDKQ,The best movie I've seen in a good while! the characters all fit their parts perfect and the acting was superb. A true story that everyone should see.
