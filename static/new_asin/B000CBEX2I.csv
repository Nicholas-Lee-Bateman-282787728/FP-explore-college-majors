2455154,3,B000CBEX2I,"Fun seeing all the stars and getting some history of the time but don't bother watching for the plot.  Bonita Granville, Beulah Bondi, Billie Burke, Zazu Pitts, Hedda Hopper.  Simple and fun.",1388448000,,191,4.9375
2455155,5,B000CBEX2I,"Great story.  Different enough cast of characters.  Great variety of stories woven into the movie.  Except fot the police pulling the lady off the bus, it was a beleivable story.  Thank you for an enjoyable afternoon.",1387065600,,217,4.944444444444445
2455156,5,B000CBEX2I,I love the older movies.  This one is very enjoyable.  Bonita Granville is one of my favorite stars of long ago.,1360022400,2,112,4.285714285714286
2455157,5,B000CBEX2I,"I wanted to watch this because Bonita Granville ""Nancy Drew"" was in it but I couldn't believe I was seeing Wes Montgomery ""The Thumb"" on guitar with Nat King Cole! He is one of my top favorite guitarist. I have several of his CDs. I could tell it was him just by hearing his style and the way he was playing. I wish I knew who the bass player is. These three guys knock it out! This is priceless. Gold.",1356652800,,402,4.0375
2455158,1,B000CBEX2I,"I bought the DVD and thought that it would be of good quality.  The front of the box says ""digitally restored"" but I think they did a very poor job.  The picture quality is grainy at times, and the sound quality is poor.  At times in the movie, you can't understand what they are saying.

The movie itself is a great film, having an interesting story line and plot.  It has all the old time great Hollywood greats, Beulah Bondi just to name one of them.  The live radio show was a real show on the ABC Radio Network, and watching it was pretty cool.

If I were to purchase this movie again, it would be a copy from Synergy Entertainment.  I am sure they must have done a better job at copying and transferring this movie to DVD than Critic's Choice has.",1344643200,2,753,4.216783216783217
2455159,3,B000CBEX2I,"Pretty gawd awful script and it is in DESPERATE need of a digital remastering BUT it has adorable stars of the era...BILLIE BURKE, ZASU PITTS & SPIKE JONES",1341532800,,155,4.571428571428571
2455160,4,B000CBEX2I,"STOP! LET ME QUALIFY MY 4 STAR RATING. I'VE BEEN A RADIO FAN SINCE I WAS 6 YEARS OLD. (RADIO DRAMA'S,SITCOMS,INTERVIEWS+MY OWN SHOW. I ALSO SUPPLIED KSFO IN THE EARLY 70'S WITH OTR.)
THE AVERAGE PERSON WOULD PROBABLY RATE THIS FILM 1 OR 2 STAR'S. TOM BRENEMAN WAS A RADIO
PERSONALITY. HE AND HIS BUSINESS PARTNER GOT THE IDEA FROM A WAITRESS TO USE HUMOR AND
INTERVIEWS AT A WELL KNOWN RESTAURANT IN THE MORNING. HE DEALT WITH MOSTLY OLDER WOMEN
AND SOME CELEBRITIES. ONE OF THE GIMMICKS WAS HAVING A CONTEST ON WHO WORE  THE MOST
OUTRAGEOUS HAT. THE JOKES ARE AWFUL. BUT, THE MUSIC BRINGS UP THE RATING. THERE IS,NAT
(KING)COLE(2 SONGS.) ANDY (ANDREAS PEREZ)RUSSELL(3 SONGS WHICH INCLUDES HIS BIG HIT,""AMOR"".
ALSO, SPIKE JONES&CITYSLICKERS(2 SONGS???) THERE IS A CUTE/CORNY LOVE STORY + BILLIE BURK'S
HUSBAND HAVING AN AFFAIR. 44 MINUTES INTO THE FILM THE SOUND GETS DISTORTED FOR 20 MINUTES.
BUT, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND 90% OF THE DIALOGUE. LUCKILY THE MUSIC IS UNTOUCHED BY THE OVER
BLOWN SOUND.
TOM BRENEMAN DIED (HEART ATTACK.) ABOUT A YEAR LATER AT THE AGE OF 46.
THIS IS A VERY CORNY MOVIE. BUT, NOSTALGIA FANS  WILL RELIVE WHAT MOST OF US FELT WERE THE
SWEET GOOD OLD DAY'S.
BONUS;""YOU ASKED FOR IT"" WITH HOST ART BAKER. THE TOUR THROUGH HOLLYWOOD IS A  GREAT
SEGMENT. TOTAL TIME; 117 MINUTES.",1224460800,6,1297,4.730088495575221

2455162,5,B000CBEX2I,"Anyone who has ever visited Hollywood and wakled down Vine St will find the ruins of Tom Breneman's famous Hollywood restaurant. (The Parking lot across the street was where the famous Brown Derby stood until 1984). From 1940 until Mr. Breneman's untimely death in 1948 Mr. Breneman hosted inside the restaurant the mega popular morning radio show ""Breakfast in Hollywood"". Often radio listeners would be surprised by Mr. Breneman who  would reveal some major movie star who was in attendence such as Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, or Judy Garland. During WWII Mr. Breneman frequently gave free parties to servicemen on their way to and from the Pacific. This movie was made in 1946. This movie is did not transfer to DVD very well. Sound quality is at times poor and scratchy. Bonita Granville is at her loveliest in the movie and 40's crooner Andy Russell belts out some catchy tunes. You also get an early in his career appearence by Nat King Cole and another musical number by Spike Jones and his City Slickers. The DVD also includes a bonus episode of the  1950's episode of the tv show "" You Asked For it "". On it host Art Baker takes the audience on a tour of 1954 Hollywood including homes of the stars.  This movie is a monument to the great Hollywood , both industry and city, of the 1930's and 40's., it is such a sad and mediocre place today. You can visit Tom Breneman's grave on findagrave(dot.)com",1169856000,9,1407,4.62
2455163,4,B000CBEX2I,"If you're not into classic black and white movies of the fabulous forties, you won't really get this. Otherwise, watch and look for brief appearances of Gary Cooper's mother, Joan Crawford's mother, and Hedda Hopper and Billie Burke in supporting roles. The plot is simple but quite unique, centered around a morning radio show quite popular across the country, as were so many in the days before television. Don Breneman was a funny, charming guy who should have done more films in this genre, as the concept of the film could have become a regular series. Unfortunately, he passed only a few years after filming. But if you like I LOVE LUCY and the episodes that include her and Ricky going on a radio show, you'll love this.",1417564800,,727,4.6875

2455166,4,B000CBEX2I,"If you are of a certain age, or at least old enough to remember growing up when all the movies on TV were black and white, this is definitely a movie worth watching. There are lots of little stories interwoven around the backdrop of the radio show, Breakfast in Hollywood. The only drawback, and it is a large one, is that the quality of the presentation is technically so poor. At the beginning, I came close to just turning it off because the sound was so terrible it came close to being painful! The jokes are lame but cute, there are lots of recognizable old-time celebrities and for a woman like me -- I was delighted by the ladies' clothing!",1412208000,,647,4.4

2455170,4,B000CBEX2I,"Breakfast in Hollywood is indeed based on a radio show of the same name with Tom Breneman as its host. (True, there may have been a little life left in the show after Breneman died all too soon but the show really didn't fare well without him.) When I read the reviews of the film here on Amazon, I was pretty sure I'd find myself watching a real stinker but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there are some qualities of the film that I genuinely like! Don't get me wrong--this is far from the best movie I've ever watched but I enjoyed it anyway even with the poor quality image and the sound quality not being too hot after the first 44 minutes or so at least on my copy of it. The sets are fairly well done with good choreography and cinematography but then again on the other hand there is the embarrassingly dated way of showing The King Cole Trio (with Nat ""King"" Cole) so segregated from the film that if you cut them out you wouldn't notice the difference! Look also for Andy Russell to give some nice performances even if they don't tie into the plot very well either and there's also Spike Jones and His City Slickers. I think the point to keep in mind is that the film is purely light-hearted entertainment that doesn't require you to think hard to enjoy it if you can accept that it truly needs a restoration and that The King Cole trio is remarkably segregated. The film also shows what everyday housewives were listening to on the radio back in the days before television and thus Breakfast in Hollywood actually has a historic quality to it, too!

The bulk of the film centers around Tom Breneman's ""Breakfast in Hollywood"" radio show and we meet quite a cast of characters all wanting to enjoy the show or somehow get into the act! There's Bonita Granville as Dorothy Larson who is engaged--she thinks--to a guy named Jim and how this plays out when she meets a sailor named Ken Smith (Edward Ryan) at the show is interesting to see. We also get a fine performance by Beulah Bondi as Mrs. Annie Reed whose dog Tippy has the croup--she wants to be the oldest woman in the audience to win an orchid given to her by Tom himself! I also liked Zasu Pitts as Elvira Spriggens who wants to win the hat contest at the radio show so Tom will try on her hat (this isn't all that humorous although the way they carry on you'd think it actually was funny).  Elvira does indeed wear the most outrageous hat that looks awful to put it mildly but will she win the contest and have Tom pick out her hat and try it on for fun or will some other woman in the audience win that ""prize"" herself? Look also for Raymond Walburn as Richard Cartwright, the playboy husband of Frances Cartwright (Billie Burke) and Hedda Hopper plays herself! There are some other people you might be surprised to see very briefly on screen as well but I'll let you discover them for yourself.

Some of the songs I enjoyed include ""The Glow Worm"" performed by Spike Jones and His City Slickers; ""Solid Potato Salad"" performed by The King Cole Trio; ""It's Better to Be By Yourself"" also performed by The King Cole Trio and ""Magic Is the Moonlight"" performed by Andy Russell.

There is one bonus feature I should mention: a TV episode of ""You Asked for It"" from 1954 with host Art Baker who gives the audience a tour of Hollywood including some homes of stars.

Overall, if you're a fan of the principal actors in this film you may well want to get this if you don't mind the fact that it needs a restoration. People who like the history of old time radio may also want to get this film.",1396224000,2,3569,4.368975903614458
2455171,3,B000CBEX2I,"The film is nice, cute & funny, with a decent storyline.  The audio/video quality is terrible.  I can't believe the critics choice version of this film says it's restored or remastered, or whatever term they used.  The intro credits are shakey like it's taken from a poor quality video tape, and there are various sections of the film where the audio is so distorted that you can hardly make out what they're saying.  It's really awful.  The movie itself is worth seeing if you're a fan of the lovely Bonita Granville, plus appearances by Nat King Cole among others really make it worth your while.  But personally I'd hold off until they truly and honestly restore this one.  I wouldn't buy this terrible version which is nearly unwatchable with the audio and video problems.  Whoever released this version and claimed it was restored should be fired.  I'd give the film itself 4 stars, but the poor quality brings it down to an overall 3 stars for me.",1395964800,,953,4.658682634730539
2455172,1,B000CBEX2I,"If you like Tom Breneman's style of humor, this dull movie rates, charitably, two stars. If, like me, you find Breneman's style, outdated, crude, and unfunny, this movie is a bomb.",1395446400,,180,4.838709677419355
8096674,5,B000CBEX2I,It's a real rare gem. Great cast and unique piece of vintage film. I recommend!,1513209600,,79,4.333333333333333
8096675,3,B000CBEX2I,"Nice to see early King Cole Trio with Nat King Cole on piano/singing.  Truly, he was a terrific piano player that sort of got lost among his also terrific singing when he went to TV.  And what can I say  - Spike Jones and his City Slickers are delightful as usual.  However, the film itself isn't much.  We do get to see Bonita Granville, Hedda Hopper, Zazu Pitts, Billie Burke, and Beulah Bondi, and briefly, the mothers of Joan Crawford and Gary Cooper.  As for the man of the hour with the ""Breakfast in Hollywood"" radio show, well, if that was his actual on-air personality, he was rather insulting and not funny, even for a fluff film from 1946.  LOL - he's no Don Rickles!",1511395200,,678,4.376
8096676,5,B000CBEX2I,Chance to see a large variety of  lesser known '40s entertainers in their prime.

8096683,3,B000CBEX2I,"This low-budget gem is highly entertaining if you love *any*thing related to Hollywood's ""Golden Era"". Simple poverty row film centered around an actual Radio Show popular in the 1940s that had same title as the film.  Although most of the actin takes place on a setpiece that resembled the actual club on Vine Street, several scenes offer glimpses of Hollywood from a sidewalk view. On the show, the  host visits Hedda Hopper's table with her guests, mothers of Gary Cooper and (!!!) Joan Crawford. You only see Joan's mother for 5 seconds, but I had never seen a photo before. A misfired romance between visitor from Minneapolis and a sailor are the pretense of the plot. You  may have to fast-forward through a dreadful novelty musical number by SPIKE JONES and his ??? Boys (can't remember their name.)",1430697600,,806,4.826086956521739
