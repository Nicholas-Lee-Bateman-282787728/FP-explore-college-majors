516830,5,6302800420,"This movie is the best cross-dressing farce since 'Some Like It Hot'. Dustin Hoffman gives one of his best (certainly his funniest) performances, and is the real star of the picture, the movie's success is largely his.  Jessica Lange and Teri Garr are also great. Bill Murray delivers a very  funny performance.",953078400,4,311,4.961538461538462
516831,5,6302800420,Dustin Hoffman shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all-time in this funny twisted film.he plays his character very well.this film has inspired alot of other Knockoff films but this one stands out.it's as funny  as Some Like it Hot with Jack Lemon.,951609600,,257,4.586956521739131
516832,5,6302800420,"A superlative example of how comedy can be successfully combined with warmth and pathos. The picture succeeeds in its honest depiction of the frustrating world of the unemployed actor and the mistreatment of  professional women by ther male contemporaries. Film has terrific  one-liners - One that is delivered to Hoffman's 'Dorothy is 'Don't you find  being a woman in the '80's complicated?' to which he/she replies  'Extremely'. (We believe him! ), and terrific comic gems, one of the best  being when in an attempt to strengthen his soap opera character Hoffman  spontaneously creates his/her own dialogue. Don't miss the beautiful last  scene. A classic in the sense of 'Some Like It Hot'. See it!",945043200,2,702,5.105263157894737

Horrifying choice on Criterion's part to have a musical menu in the first place, and to have it start playing in between every selection was annoying as heck.

Decides to become a woman (dressed like a woman only)!and truly to take jobs for females.  She immediately lands a job in a hospital daily soap as the new hospital administrator and turns things around with her male attitude coming out of her female persona ""Tootsie"". Multiple funny parts and a love interest that proves troublesome to the woman hes faking and the real man that he is.  I won't go into it further and ruin the story.

516987,2,6302800420,"Thought it was funny years ago but now it wears thin. Michael (Dustin Hoffman) talks feminism but treats the women in his life like objects. He comes off like a self-centered jerk and the only moment of truth is when Julie (Jessica Lange) punches him in the stomach. The forgiving stuff at the end is unbelievable. Bill Murray, however, rules!",1481500800,,343,4.733333333333333
516988,5,6302800420,"Now considering I really didn't like The Graduate, this movie was a blast. It was very funny and moving, with a great script and cast. Dustin Hoffman didn't annoy me in this movie and carried off the role very well. The emotional roller-coaster concerning all the cast's individual crisis and hiccups all round was convincing and hysterical in some cases.
The movie and script is from an era of misogynists and sexism in the workplace (in this case a TV Soap opera set, in front and behind the camera), so if that offends you these days (personally I don't have an opinion in this regards - each to their own, I say)  don't bother but DO watch to enjoy it for what it is which is a very funny movie about sexism and misogynists in the workplace!
Highly recommend especially for a girl's movie night!",1481241600,,799,4.510344827586207

517029,5,6302800420,"Easily one of the Top 10 BEST COMEDIES EVER MADE!! Hoffman is great but so are so many of the other cast members, particularly Bill Murray, Teri Garr, Charles Durning and Sydney Pollack as Hoffman's agent. The scene where Dustin Hoffman tries to explain the farce to his agent towards the end is hilarious.
""Julie thinks you're gay?""
""No, my friend Sandy.""
""Sleep with her, and she'll...""
""I slept with her once, she still thinks I'm gay.""
""Oh...that's not good, Michael.""",1470441600,5,472,4.839506172839506
517030,5,6302800420,"Dustin Hoffman remains popular among movie fans especially when it comes to portraying difficult roles such as the autistic brother of Tom Cruise in the ""Rain Man"" and that being a woman in this film entitled ""Tootsie"".

The late Sydney Pollack directed this film about Michael Dorsey,an unemployed actor who is unable to get a job due to being difficult to work with despite the fact that he is extremely talented. When he could no longer find any work,he decided to disguise as Dorothy Michaels,an actress who lands a role in a popular soap opera. Here is where the fun begins.....

No question that the viewer will definitely be amazed by Hoffman's performance considering anyone who does not know would surely never doubt him at all as a drag. Even his voice which is of a Southern accent is pitch perfect. Aside from it, we also are treated to an intelligent comedic screenplay that revolves around Michael/Dorothy from his relationships with his friends Jeff and Sandy as well as his cast mates Les and April. We also get to see how Dorothy's career takes off and how he finally reveals in the end who he really ends. Finally, the development of the relationship between Michael and April was definitely worth watching.

It was a big hit when it was released back in '82. But despite the fact that a lot of things have changed since then particularly when it comes to many themes it made fun with such as the increase of women in workplace together with the limited acceptance of LGBT's which are no longer issues today,it remains one of the most popular comedies at present. Watching Hoffman alone is a big delight.",1470268800,,1622,4.704225352112676
517031,4,6302800420,"I would have given it 5 stars when it came out, but as throwback video it's a 4 star flick. Hoffman is so cute as Dorothy Michaels.

And it's true, many of the scenes don't play well, they seem forced. Worst of all is Dustin Hoffman pretending to be in love with Teri Garr just because he was trying on one of her dresses. This creates a superfluous subplot which keeps getting in the way of the action throughout the movie.

He becomes very successful as a woman actor, playing a hospital administrator on a daytime soap. Should he quit, or reveal himself, or what?

Michael Dorsey becomes Dorothy Michaels. I forget how wonderful of an actor Dustin Hoffman is. He's not Dustin Hoffman playing Michael who's playing Dorothy. He IS Michael. he IS Dorothy.

Bill Murray, Teri Garr, and the rest of the cast is amazing, well cast. The story is believable.

An out of work actor who doesn't see how difficult he is to work with winds up playing the ultimate character who gives him space to see the world differently.

I won't spoil the twists and turns it makes. It does all this is a way that's genuinely funny.

It was satisfying to watch when it first came out and I was in my late teens. Now, it's even more satisfying having lived some life and seeing Dorothy transforming Michael.",1440633600,,753,4.548148148148148

The film belongs to Hoffman.  but he did not get an Oscar.  I'm betting that, after four years of work and fighting and sweat....and wearing all those prosthetics and heels  and makeup.....Hoffman wanted the award.  The Oscar went to Gandhi.",1437177600,,405,4.7
517508,5,6302800420,Tootsie never ages as a comic masterpiece. This movie represents Dustin Hoffman at the top of his game coupled with superb supporting cast and Sydney Pollack's inspired direction.

Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lang are fantastic in this movie, but there are several stars you would recognize...including Geena Davis, Teri Garr, and of course Bill Murray.

Basically actor Michael Dorsey - who cannot find work because he's too much of a perfectionist- takes a job for a female part out of desperation. He not only fools everyone, but is a smashing hit. He ultimately reveals his secret, in part because they want to sign him to an extended deal which he didn't want, but mainly because he falls in love with his co-star (Jessica Lang).",1431907200,,671,4.775862068965517

Happily, it held its own quite well.  Tootsie is a funny, well acted movie that even manages to inspire some introspection about female stereotypes.  Dustin Hoffman, who received an Academy Award Nomination for his portrayal of Michael Dorsey / Dorothy Michaels, is at his comedic best.  There are also memorable performances by Jessica Lange, Dabney Coleman and Charles Durning.  You won't be moved, or inspired, but you are going to laugh -- a lot.",1426636800,,618,4.847619047619047

Bill Murray as Michael's best friend is at his quirky, wry best.  The scenes from Michael's birthday party with him holding court to an enraptured, if slightly tipsy, audience is hysterical.  Sydney Pollack as director and as Michael's agent in the film is great, too.  The scene in the Russian Tea Room...priceless!!

A well thought out plot and well written without crude jokes to get a cheap laughs. The director Sydney Pollack, kept the plot intact without going off the deep end. It gives some insight to actors and writers struggles to survive in everyday life. The underrated performances by Bill Murray and Terri Garr added comic spontaneity to the film.

518415,5,6302800420,"It started campy - very early 80s New York feel to it.  Then it got funny but uncomfortable a little when the transformation takes place. It had good chuckles but it was something comedies today seldom are: it had a message that didn't feel tacked on.  There was actually development of a character and he changes and changes those around him.  And what's even better is TWO lead characters change in the male and female persuasion.  I think the film is somewhat dated but this may be in part be due to its success in getting its message across. I hope men don't talk to women like they do in the film.  I'm sure it goes on, but I get the sense it was once more rampant.

Good to watch with a family and teenage kids or older... probably wouldn't go younger than that.",1425945600,,768,4.298611111111111

518646,5,6302800420,"Watched this movie for the first time in 30 years (has it really been that long?).  It was a nostalgic look at what was going on in 1982.  It was great to see actors who are currently still active in cinema and television when they were still young and up and coming.  Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lang, and Bill Murray all shine.  Terri Garr plays the neurotic damsel in distress perfectly as usual.  You also have Dabney Coleman playing the same lecherous lout that made him a mainstay in these roles during the 80's.  Geena Davis is also in the movie briefly before she broke out in her own right as a star.  The film ages well because it is a timeless tale with a twist.  Dustin Hoffman, a struggling out of work actor gets a job on a soap opera as a woman.  No one is aware that he is actually a man dressed like a woman.  The movie deals with issues of sexism that still exist today, but not in such an overt or threatening way.  It is more light hearted than serious, but it gets the point across.  Dustin Hoffman opines at one point he is a better man as a woman than he ever was as a man.  The movie is never preachy.  As far as family viewing, there is really nothing that makes the movie unsuitable for kids.  Any adult themes fly by without dwelling on them.  There is no nudity (except for a scene of a woman in her bra and panties standing in front of a mirror).  I don't recall any swearing.  It is a good movie that people of all ages will enjoy.",1424822400,2,1457,4.142857142857143

518650,5,6302800420,"Tootsie has never looked better with a superb Blu-Ray transfer that shows fantastic detail, restores the filmic qualities and looks as good as Im sure it did on opening night.

Ported over from the Criterion Collections 1991 laserdisc is an audio commentary by director Sydney Pollack in which he provides thoughtful observations about the film.

Also included are three trailers for Tootsie.

There are nine deleted scenes that run 11 minutes. They are interesting to watch, especially for fans of the film, but were rightly cut.

Screen and Wardrobe Tests features fascinating archival footage of Hoffman from 1980 when Hal Ashby was the director. This extra offers a brief, tantalizing glimpse at what his vision might have been.

A Better Man: The Making of Tootsie is a retrospective documentary from 2007 that features interviews with Hoffman, Pollack, Garr, Lange and others. It takes us from the screenplay to Pollacks apprehension with the premise to how Hoffman transformed himself into Dorothy. This is very well done with lots of anecdotal information.

The Making of Tootsie is a making of documentary made during the production. It offers intriguing behind the scenes footage of Pollack working with Hoffman and the filming of key scenes.

There is a new interview with Hoffman where he reflects, at times, quite emotionally, about making Tootsie.

Also included is a new interview with writer/producer/actor Phil Rosenthal who talks about his experiences on the film.

Finally, there is unused footage of T.V. film critic Gene Shalit interviewing Dorothy Michaels, which is fun to watch.",1424736000,,1602,5.250980392156863

I really wasn't prepared for how spot on it was concerning swapping gender roles. Obviously the main character isn't actually trans, but it was respectful and just too perfect. It shines a spotlight on all the little things that tend to come up, and I know I ended up projecting a lot of me into it. The acting was PERFECT, and I was hooked into it within the first 5 minutes. Love, love, loved it.

It makes me happy and has put me in an awesome mood, despite my own anxieties about it before watching. If you're trans and you're worried about whatever this is, I think you might be pleasantly surprised. I wicked endorse it.  =D",1424476800,,766,4.425531914893617

His performance is incredibly nuanced as a man/woman looking to make a buck to finance a play about the Love Canal (go figure!). He plays Dorothy Michaels, a soap opera administrator at a hospital. She runs across sexual harassment, boorish males, and male power politics. Not to take abuse lightly she fights back with humor, shrewdness and in-your-face assertiveness. Tootsie falls in love with Jessica Lange who believes (s)he is a lesbian! To complicate matters Jessica's father falls in love with Tootsie. Marvelous! The climatic scene on the grand stairway  has to be seen to believed. This is a feel good movie as expertly done as Mrs Doubtfire.

But it is much more than that.  Gender roles, sexism, women not taken seriously in the workplace or in their personal lives. And all becomes clear through the eyes of Dustin Hoffman, the desperate actor who will do just about anything to raise money to produce his friend's play.

518888,5,6302800420,"[SPOILERS]
Tootsie is a wonderfully told story about Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman), a twenty-year down on his luck perfectionist, self serving, struggling actor who is told in no uncertain terms by his agent that he will never work as an actor in either New York City or in Hollywood again, so he decides to dress up as a woman named Dorothy Michaels and auditions for a hit soap opera and gets the job. Now he must maintain the facade for as long as he is under contract and risk alienating himself from the many friends he has who he must keep the secret from, and the new people he has now developed personal relationships with as Dorothy on the set, including his pretty and talented co-star who he has fallen deeply in love with.

Michael Dorsey is a deeply complex character. To quote him, He busts his ass to get every audition right, but in the process he has become that difficult actor that directors don't wish to work with. Michael hasn't worked on a paid acting gig in a couple years, so to make ends meet he teaches an acting class, waiters at a local restaurant, and does free theater. He has celebrated a birthday and seeing himself get older and not achieve the success he thought he would have attained by now has left him feeling inadequate. He is selfish even if he insists that he never does his acting work for the great reviews. His next great venture is to get his roommates play produced for eight thousand dollars for him and his best friend, Sandy, to star in. Michael is desperate which lends to the credibility that he would go to any lengths to book a gig and make some money. Even so far as to secretly dress up like a woman and work on a soap opera.

The only two people in on Michaels secret are his quirky roommate, Jeff, (Bill Murrary) who prefers people not like his play, but rather question What happened?, and his overworked agent (Sydney Pollack) who insists that Michael seek some therapy. Sandy (Teri Garr) is an actress and Michaels best friend of six years who has her own deep seeded issues of inadequacy and insecurity. All the while longing for acceptance and insisting she receive her pain and rejection from her male lovers upfront rather than prolong the agony over a period of time. Due to some mitigating circumstances that leaves Michael caught red handed trying on some of Sandys dresses, he lies and says he wants her sexually and she agrees. Michael never tells Sandy about him dressing up as a woman to work on a soap opera because she was up for the same exact role and was told she wasn't right for it, thus complicating the lies Michael has to make up to not see her because of his busy soap opera schedule.

Dorothy Michaels is Michaels female alter ego. The talented actor that Michael is allows him to portray Dorothy with a sweet southern charm and personality, but the man that Michael is gives Dorothy a male foundation which comes across as a strong, take no nonsense kind of woman who speaks her mind. To the surprise of everyone, including Michael, Dorothy Michaels becomes a huge soap star that receives thousands of fan mail per week. Dorothys persona positively intrigues Rita, the soaps main executive producer and befuddles Ron (Dabnet Coleman), the shows womanizing director who doesnt understand why Dorothy is not only immune to his charms, but also doesnt like him.

Julie (Jessica Lange) is the talented, gorgeous single mom and the soap operas biggest star who becomes Dorothys best friend and confidant. She is dating Ron much to Michaels dismay, who witnesses how sexist and disrespectful Ron is towards Julie and every woman on set, much like how Michael is in his real life. All Michael/Dorothy can do is be a friend and keep giving good advice to Julie about being a strong woman who stands up for herself, and in the process Michael falls in love with Julie. To further complicate matters, Julies dad, Les, (Charles Durning) has developed an infatuation with Dorothy after a few meetings together and proposes marriage.

During this entire process, Michael has developed a deep level of guilt at the continuous lies he is forced to commit knowing that the truth of who he is will eventually come out hurting a lot of people who trusted and cared for him. He has also learned that the man he once was wasn't always the nicest or best person to be with especially around women. In a rather fortuitous and desperate attempt at making amends, Michael/Dorothy is forced to perform a soap scene live in front of the camera for the world to see and decides to disrobe and let the truth be known to all that he is not a woman, but in fact a man.

In conclusion, Tootsie is one of those laugh out loud, touching, relatable, moving and human films that is easy to connect with and leaves you wanting to know more as the movie progresses. Everyone who got to know and interact with the Dorothy persona has become a better person including Michael. The once sad and selfish character that Michael is in the beginning of the film has become this deeper, likeable and more relatable character by films end. One cant help but feel good that Michael and Julie do wind up together in the end because the Michael of old one would figure would have somehow ruined the relationship, while this new humbled and experienced Michael has the great potential to have a long lasting loving relationship with Julie.

Tootsie was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, as was Dustin Hoffman and Teri Garr for Best Actor and Actress. Jessica Lange won an Oscar for her role as Julie. This film stands the test of time and continues to be relevant and funny today as it was back when it first premiered in the early to mid 1980's. Highly recommend.",1423526400,,5708,4.59568204121688

518940,4,6302800420,"""Tootsie"" is a socially conscious movie, so it requires some realism to engage with and critique. But it's also a comedy, which means that realism is sometimes secondary to laughs. The way ""Tootsie"" manages its dual nature is that the premise provides a platform for commentary, while the way it actually plays out is unbelievable but very funny. Dustin Hoffman is not a believable woman. Maybe he could have been, but his dollar-bin clothes and clownish makeup and mincing voice are all wrong and come off like cosplay or parody. Who could believe that a major actress like Hoffman's character could do four photo shoots for major magazine covers in those clothes and that wig, or that she would be allowed to do her own makeup at home before filming her daily soap, or that as a new and unknown hire she could walk onto an established TV set run by a tyrant director and so thoroughly blow everyone away with one-take improvised line readings that the crew would abandon scripts and camera cues to suit her whims? Nobody, but it's funny to see Hoffman do those things. Sometimes the jokes are found in the likeliest places, like the banter between Hoffman and slovenly roommate Bill Murray about dieting and whether certain clothes make one's ass look big. A lot of the best lines, both the dramatic and the humorous, go to Teri Garr in a supporting role that is more interesting but smaller than Jessica Lange's, and this creates a certain imbalance in the romantic chemistry. But such misses are excusable in a movie with its heart so clearly in the right place. The premise is a broad one to match the occasionally broad humor, and it's really the same one that drove Hoffman's earlier starring vehicle ""Kramer vs. Kramer"": that society's assigned roles for men and women are artificial. ""Tootsie""'s way of saying this is less sharp than ""Kramer""'s, and while the latter is carefully structured so as to leave no room to interpret is as anything but a powerful statement of equality, it is possible to see ""Tootsie"" as a movie that plays with social conventions without fundamentally overturning them. In the final analysis, though, the movie's intent is to challenge the status quo of male privilege. This is made clear in a scene in which Hoffman calls out the sleazy director who's dating and cheating on his leading lady, only to have the director ruefully acknowledge his behavior in a way that highlights how similar it is to Hoffman's. The movie may have its cake and eat it too, mixing comedy and commentary, but it doesn't let its characters get away with inconsistency. That is to say, it's a smart movie and a good movie.",1423180800,,2637,4.747276688453159

518944,5,6302800420,"""Tootsie"" is one of my favorite comedies and a huge hit when it first came out during one of the coldest winters where I live. Yet, I still managed to get to the theater twice in the span of a a two-week period both to packed houses. Although the concept is somewhat old fashioned (a guy dressing up in drag), the execution of the film itself along with the superb script and top-notch acting make it a true classic.

It would not be a fair review on my part to go over the plot and details of the film, so I will focus on the Blu-ray DVD release itself. From the Criterion Collection, it comes with a new 4K Digital transfer while keeping the original monaural soundtrack and the expected number of bells and whistles which includes the following;

- New Interviews with Dustin Hoffman & Phil Rosenthal
- Audio Commentary with Sydney Pollack
- Two Documentaries, ""The Making of Tootsie"" (1982) and ""A Better Man: The Making of Tootsie"" (2007)
- Screen and Wardrobe Tests
- Deleted Scenes and Trailers
- Booklet with Essay by Michael Sragow

Doubtless some of the extras will be familiar since they were released in an earlier DVD version. Everything in the DVD package is well presented and the only notable missing interviews are Charles Durning, Bill Murray and Geena Davis which is understandable in some ways since Durning was really getting up in years by 2007, Davis only has a small role in the film and Bill Murray is notorious for not giving interviews of this type anyway.

The most revealing aspect of the extras is the initial screen, makeup and wardrobe tests that showed the evolution of Hoffman's appearance over time as he evolved into Dorothy Michaels. It is in these scenes that we see just how very wrong this all could have gone if some of the early decisions about the direction of the film were made. It is a testament to the dedication of Hoffman and the inclusion of Sydney Pollack as the director who managed, perhaps by accident, to be so perfect in the treatment and shooting of the film.

Tootsie is a classic film that does not seem dated at all despite obviously being shot in the early 1980s. Hoffman is clearly not all that feminine as Dorothy Michaels, yet he manages to create an unforgettable character that is as real as any ever created. Finally, Pollack's decision (after much urging by Hoffman) to appear as the agent was pure brilliance as he adds an edge that the film really needed to succeed.

Did I say that Tootsie is one of my favorite comedies? It's also one of my favorite DVD releases as well.",1422489600,11,2543,4.565789473684211

He is simply flawless as Michael Dorsey, a temperamental, out-of-work actor whose agent, George Fields (the late director Sydney Pollack in his own fine comedic performance), emphasizes no one will hire. Enter Dorothy Michaels, Dorsey's brash, no-nonsense, alter ego, who auditions, like his girlfriend, Sandy (the wonderful Teri Garr), for a hit soap opera and becomes an instant success.  On the set, Michael Dorsey, as Dorothy, falls for the soap's leading lady, Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange in a funny, beautifully-nuanced, and poignant Oscar win). Trouble ensues with Julie's boyfriend, Ron (the villainous Dabney Coleman), the soap's director who views women as a pursuit where men get more exploited than women, rather than a genuine love.

While making us laugh at the witty dialogue and absurd situations, it also makes us examine the performative nature of gender. How much of being male or female is biological, and how much is constructed through the roles we play? After all, Michael Dorsey is an actor playing an actor, or should we say Dustin Hoffman is an actor playing an actor playing an actor? As Shakespeare says, ""All the world's a stage."" This movie makes a careful viewer realize that we are all actors who to a greater (or lesser) extent can be in control of the parts we play and thus in control of the people we become.

The two characters were both really funny and played beautifully.  I guess the reason that the movie Tootsie suffered by comparison is that the writing was nowhere nearly as funny and the supporting cast was kind of flat.  The supposed connection between Tootsie and the supporting characters in Tootsie was just not believable.

519222,5,6302800420,"This movie seems to have been forgotten in the classic comedies cannon, and while some things about it are certainly now dated (ex. fashions) it stands the test of time as one of the funniest movies ever without being too over the top.

Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a struggling actor in New York City in the early 1980s, who has one of the worst reps in town.  He is temperamental and demanding, refusing to cooperate with direction and will not compromise his art.  When his agent, Sidney Pollack, tells him that he will never be hired for any job, Michael decides to show him.  In a classic ""Say WHAAAA???!""  moment when we see him emerge from a crowd scene dressed as a woman, Michael reinvents himself as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and auditions for a soap.  He gets the part and now has steady work, but he becomes a phenomenon with the public.  She's not afraid to stand up and speak her mind to anyone, especially to her sexist director Dabney Coleman or challenge anyone, she becomes a force to be reconed with.  There are so many screwball comedy antics and hilarious things going on you almost can't name them all.  She becomes so many things you almost can't count them.  Michael is a neurotic guy who can't seem to hold it all together but recovers as best he can here and there.  Terri Garr has a nice role as his all of a sudden girlfriend (in one of the greatest recovery scenes ever when she catches him about to try on her dress), and Bill Murray, the only one who knows the secret, plays his typical exasperation and subtle humor that only he can deliver.  They ever made it a romantic comedy with him falling for Jessica Lange, his costar, who is almost too sweet and simple for words.  And that song ""It Might Be You"" just might be one of the prettiest love songs to this day I have ever heard without being too sappy.  One night he experiences perhaps the craziest of crazy situations when he makes a move on Jessica Lange as Dorothy, is proposed to by her father, rejects the advances of her lecherous costar, and is nearly caught by Terri Garr as Dorothy.

Words of criticism?  There wasn't anything that kind of lead to the decision for Michael to decide to become a woman to get parts.  It just seemed like BANG he decided to do this.  And of course let's not forget the fact that he is intending to get away with the lie the entire time until that climactic revealing on the soap in a live broadcast which is hysterical!  And the special features show Dustin Hoffman's transformation from a scary drag queen to a more believable one which is a must see as they test shots.  Have a good time with this.  It's simple yet so effective.",1403654400,2,2667,4.435318275154004

  Since this movie was produced in 1982, you can't expect wonders in Blu-Ray presentation quality.
Don't expect any DNR or any other slick grain reduction. This movie is in it's original look with the natural grain and an additional layer of
softening from the camera shooting style used. No special attempt seems to have been made to restore or alter the quality, but it is still a worthy upgrade in picture and sound from the DVD. Don't expect a special edition restoration....it wasn't even released on Blu in the US.
  It supposedly supports a lossless DTS 5.0 soundtrack in English (which is the default language on the disc menu). A film this age is usually better sounding with a lossy sound decoder such as ""Multi Channel Stereo"" or Dolby PL II.
  I recommend the M + L sellers that got this disc to me in Florida from Germany in 10 days for a total of $20 for all costs.

519275,4,6302800420,"This movie is incredibly funny, and not in the cheap, gimmicky way one might expect. Michael Dorsey (played by Dustin Hoffman) is an an out-of-work actor who, while very talented, is difficult to work with. This eventually leads to his dressing as a woman to get a role on a popular soap opera. From the get-go, Hoffman's character challenges preconceived notions about gender roles and has an enlightening journey that teaches him about how to treat women.

Rather than go for slapstick comedy, the director challenged the cast to not play their characters as funny but rather as dramatic characters in funny situations. This turns out to work magnificently and also more realistically than say the later movie Mrs. Doubtfire. Here we have adults who behave like adults (cheating, drinking, etc.) and actually learn something about the pressures put on women.

It's funny, it's socially relevant, it's smart, and it's written with characters and dialog that feel real. Everybody should see this movie, although I guess its audience is somewhat limited by the use of language in the film. By today's standards it would get a PG-13 rating for its brief use of  s*** as well as some barely audible mumbles of the f-bomb.

519361,5,6302800420,"Like Billy Wilders Some Like It Hot (1959), Sydney Pollack's Tootsie (1982) uses the fish out of water patina of a man in drag merely as its crutch rather than making it the crux of the story. Therein lays the strength of the movie: also in Dustin Hoffmans monumental performance  playing it straight as it were - as the guy who reaffirms his own manhood by getting in touch with his feminine side. Tootsie is so rife with moments of sheer comedic brilliance it catches the viewer almost by surprise.

Oh sure, were expecting a comedy. But the origin of our laughs is discovered in more unlikely places than under the wig and girdle. What is quite miraculous about Tootsie  especially for someone who has seen the movie now more than twenty times  is Hoffmans ability to so completely immerse us in his character and his alter ego that somewhere along the way we can still forget this is Hoffman playing a part. George Masters impressive makeup can only go so far. The rest of the assimilation from man into woman comes entirely from within Hoffmans ability to get inside Dorothy Michaels; to transfer the best elements of his presence as a star and as an actor into this curious looking glass sense of self re-conceptualized as an unattractive female that most men would find threatening to their own fragile impressions of masculinity.

Indeed, Tootsie aims at loftier ambitions; its social critique of men judging women as sex objects fueled by Hoffmans inspiring and proactive take charge gal with an agenda. At increments the screenplay touches upon issues of gender inequality, mixed messages emanating between the sexes, a near rape situation, transgender confusion and transsexualism; hardly expected fodder from a frothy romantic/comedy. Some thirty plus years after its debut, Tootsies social critique remains fresh and as plainly astute as ever. It really is difficult to critique a film as well-rounded as Tootsie. It's as real and as perfect as movies get; an embarrassment of riches: heart, class and something meaningful to say. Comedies tend to date. But Tootsie remains the gold star standard bearer by which most any other before or since can be judged.

Sony Home Entertainment continues its rather frustrating trend of releasing some of its finest movies in hi-def only overseas.  The Blu-ray marginally bests Sonys North American 25th Anniversary on DVD but its hardly perfect and thats a shame. At some level, the 1080p transfer is at the mercy of less than stellar existing elements. The color, processed at MGMs labs, falters throughout this presentation. While some scenes look remarkably vibrant and exhibit very fine tonality, contrast and a good solid smattering of film grain, others appear with wan colors, heavy grain and even a visible age-related artifact or two. Montages suffer from weak contrast brought on by inferior optical printing methods back then. Sony could have gone back to the drawing board and spent its money correctly on cleaning up and stabilizing these sequences so that they more seamlessly blend with the rest of the movie. They haven't and frankly, it stinks!  The 5.1 DTS audio is a vast improvement over the Dolby Digital tracks on the 25th Anniversary DVD. Occasionally, however, dialogue sounds ever so slightly muffled.

Sonys import jettisons its 25th anniversary DVD audio commentary but retains the making of documentary that offers some fascinating insight from Hoffman and other principle cast and crew. If you don't already own Tootsie then this Blu-ray is the way to go. Its not a reference quality disc, but the movie alone comes very highly recommended. Tootsie is a seminal comedy to be enjoyed and reviewed over and over again.",1387411200,2,3698,5.019575856443719

Beginning with an unknown actor, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, who has difficulty securing parts to play in movies as an actor, thereby, being unable to advance his career, the movie finds Hoffman dressing up as a woman to audition for a role in a television drama featuring, among others, the gorgeous Jessica Lange (who if looks could kill, would knock you dead in a minute), and, hence, securing the leading role in this medical drama series and spawning a huge fan base with women literally going gaga over Tootsie and turning the series into a phenomenal hit. Then, things go screwy as Tootsie, having read wrongly between the lines, feels that Jessica is attracted to him and makes overtures towards her - leading her to reach the conclusion that Tootsie is a lesbian, while Jessica's father falls heads over heels in love with Tootsie and proposes marriage; the lead actor in the drama series finding himself taken with Tootsie and serenades her in front of her apartment, and Dustin's girlfriend reaching the conclusion that he is a homosexual when he presents to her as a gift the strawberry covered chocolates given to him by Jessica's father that bears the inscription, ""Thanks for a wonderful evening,"" bearing his name and signature.

However, soon he gets so caught up in his role as Dorothy, he cannot get himself out. His character is so popular on the soap that she is renewed forcing Dorsey to endure it even longer. Then he finds himself befriending a shy actress on the soap (Lange) while he starts neglecting another actress friend (Garr). Along the way he has many awkward moments and romantic entanglements. The worst of these comes when he must reveal who he is (only his roommate and agent know). At first it causes pain but ultimately honesty is the way to go.

519676,5,6302800420,"We worked our way through all 100 movies of the AFI top 100. Even though Tootsie is #62 on the list, somewhere in the middle, we ended up watching it at the tail end of the process. As part of our AFI watching, for fun we were evaluating each movie on the Bechdel test. The Bechdel test is extremely simple - it really is just trying to see if a movie has two named females who ever talk with each other about something other than a male. The vast majority of AFI movies failed this test. Heck, many of them didn't even have two females with names in them.

So I was fascinated to see how Tootsie would do, and of course to watch the movie. I've seen Tootsie several times in the past, but we were watching them fresh so we could see them all in a row and examine how they compared.

The story here of course is one of gender reversals. Hoffman is a brilliant but tempermental actor that nobody will work with any more. He suddenly gets the idea to disguise himself as a woman so he can get work. I wish they went more into that process. In the movie, he pretty much talks to his agent (an equally brilliant Pollack), is told there's no work, and POOF the next morning he decides to be a middle-aged woman. I would have liked at least a little more insight into the progression there. But in any case, of course, the usual shenanigans erupt with women thinking he's got a strange woman going into his apartment, men being attracted to his ""female self"", and so on.

The acting is brilliant here from all sides. Whether it's Murray, Lange, Garr, Coleman, Durning, Hoffman, they all are spot-on with their emotions and relationships. The dialogue is great as well. It's a joy to watch. I was laughing out loud all through it, even though I knew the story and lines.

But what had me laughing even more was the fact that I kept thinking it was passing the Bechdel test in amazing, flying colors - because I kept getting sucked in and viewing Tootsie as a female! Up until now, pretty much every single AFI movie completely lacked female-female dialogue. Even classic strong-female movies like Annie Hall barely passed - the only time a female talked with another female was in a montage scene where one mom makes a comment and another mom makes a responding comment. It is staggering how rare a female-to-female talk is. So I kept being joyfully staggered at how women were actually TALKING in this movie - only to realize with amusement that it was actually a male-female discussion! That's the only reason it was being shown. A man was involved :).

Still, it's hard to fault Tootsie for something that pretty much every single AFI movie has challenges with. It is sad, through, that with two spectacular actresses in it - Lange and Garr - it could still not manage to have the two have even one talk together. A movie about gender roles and how women aren't appreciated still managed not to appreciate women fully.

So that is definitely something to ponder. But in the meantime, the movie is quite funny, very engaging, and it lifts my spirits to watch it. Well recommended.",1343520000,,3075,4.472370766488414
519677,5,6302800420,I find this movie so satisfying because the movie distracts me from one of my darkest moments and gives me hope. It lightens me up when I'm not feeling well and makes me laugh. Tootsie lightens me up and takes my mind off my problems. The main message of the movie is to BE YOURSELF! Dustin's character begins to realize how tough the struggles of a woman are. Dustin's character becomes aware of what it means to live in a woman's skin. It crosses the boundaries in ways that other movies don't with an old school interpretation. There are some timeless lines in this work of art and what every viewer will see in this movie is the opportunity to see deeper meanings on the nature of love and relationships.,1338076800,,708,4.453846153846154

519772,5,6302800420,"Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor and in ""Tootsie"" he proves how versatile a performer he can be. When you watch this comedy you forget all about ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Marathon Man"", ""The Graduate"", and ""Rain Man"", all films where Dustin proved he is without a doubt the best actor Hollywood has ever had. In ""Tootise"" Dustin shows his comedic chomps and to this day his portrayal as a man who cross dresses as a woman to garner a role on a daytime soap is widely regarged by critics and fans as an intelligent and poignant performance. Dustin plays an out-of-work actor in New York City who cannot find a job as he has become known as ""difficult"" to work with. He eventually dons a wig, dress, and highheels, and tries out for a part on the highly rated serial ""Southwest General"", obviously named after daytime's then #1 rated soap opera ""General Hospital"". He gets the part and what eventaully happens is a series of misunderstandings as everyone believes that the Hoffman character, Dorothy Michaels, is a real person.
 Jessica Lange received the first of her two Oscars playing the co-star in ""Southwest General"", as well as the love interest to the Hoffman character. Big-time Hollywood director Sydney Pollack directed the film.
 ""Tootsie"" has found a niche for itself on the list of the best films ever, and upon its release became a huge boxoffice smash. On a budget of $20,000,000 ""Tootsie"" has grossed nearly $200,000,000 as of 2010.

Playing an actor (or actress!) who is playing another role is never easy, yet he handles the multiple layers brilliantly. The scenes between Hoffman and Sydney Pollack (who also directed) are the best part of the film, probably due in large part to their very real off-camera arguments.  This film also boasts the right amount of Bill Murray (not too much!), allowing him to make the most of his scenes. Jessica Lange won Best Supporting Actress for what was in my opinion a fairly shallow role (Teri Garr deserved it more!), and yet Tootsie lost out on EVERY other Oscar that year, mostly to Ghandi and E.T.

519798,5,6302800420,"TOOTSIE is now well and truly over 25 years old, but still remains as fresh and funny as it was when it first premiered.  A real joy.  Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Bill Murray and Teri Garr star in this keenly observed Sydney Pollack gem with a genuine New York showbusiness background.

Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is New York's most untouchable, unemployable actor.  No one in the business is prepared to work with him, and he's reduced to operating as an acting coach for others who can't seem to land a break in the industry, including painfully awkward Sandy (Teri Garr).  Finally, in a last-ditch bid to find a role - any role - Michael frocks up as ""Dorothy Michaels"" and lands a job on top-rating TV soap ""Southwest General"".

Playing the no-nonsense chief of staff Emily Kimberley, ""Dorothy"" wins thousands of female fans all over the country.  But when Michael starts falling in love with co-star Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange) - who has well and truly taken the endearing ""Dorothy"" to heart as her best friend - how on earth will Michael reveal himself without destroying his/her trust relationship with Julie in the process?...

TOOTSIE is one of those rare films I could sit through several times a week and never get bored with.  This is mainly due to the incredible performances but props must also be given to the outstanding screenplay from Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal.  Dustin Hoffman is so good at playing altar-ego ""Dorothy"" that I STILL sometimes forget that it's not an actual woman!

Composer Dave Grusin and songwriters Alan & Marilyn Bergman supplied the Oscar-nominated soundtrack (""Tootsie"", ""It Might Be You""); Sydney Pollack has a cameo role as Michael's agent.  Also keep your eyes peeled for small appearances from Christine Ebersole, Estelle Getty and Geena Davis.

Helping Hoffman is Jessica Lange in, by far, her most attractive role. I'm not particularly a fan of hers but she looked spectacular in here, almost like Marilyn Monroe.

This was a popular film because the humor was good and the two leads did a nice job, and people like a good romance story, too. Hoffman,  a fabulous actor, has always been  able to play diverse roles. He's an amazing actor.

519816,5,6302800420,"Wonderful little package!

When Tootsie came out on dvd (up to that point I had the video, the soundtrack on cassette and possibly the sheet music) I was bitterly disappointed by the lack of extras..

Or should I say the extra - a trailer for the film..

So I'm pleasantly surprised with the 25th aniversary release of this film (February 2008 released). Ok, the deleted scenes aren't much cop (5 brief scenes - mention of ""Terry Bishop"" but not much else - Terry Bishop we learn is Michael's old roommate who took his role on The Iceman Cometh, which is why Michael was so furious and had to see his agent early on in the movie..

Ok - well, what can you say? One of the best films ever made? with an unbilled Bill Murray (Jeff) (not listed in the credits! what gives?!) I remember reading in one of Roger Ebert's reviews or something how Bill didn't ask for a credit. He very nearly steals the film!

He's kind of a Greek Chorus, commenting on the action here and there, very wittily too I might add: ""You slut!""

It probably is the best film he has ever been in. Rushmore is great but the replay factor isn't so great as Tootsie's.

What I like most about this package is that theres an hour long Making of Tootsie. This is the best bonus feature on this dvd (the deleted scenes are about 10 minutes, not really watching more than once to be honest; and theres a few minutes of Dustin Hoffman's screen tests as Dorothy Michael, fairly early on?)

But quite a lot of interesting stuff gets covered - first, the script.. It went through many different hands, lotta different perspectives. An (uncredited) woman writer fleshed out the female characters (Sandy (Teri Garr), etc))

You get Dabney Coleman, Jessica Lange, Dustin Hoffman, Teri Garr talking about the film, and its clear they absolutely love it, thoroughly enjoyed their time acting in it, that it was just a breeze to do so. Hoffman's talking about his alter ego Dorothy, and you can tell hes very close to her, discussing who she was and what made her tick (and how she would have a difficult time finding a love, in his opinion, cos she really wasn't physically attractive, which upset him when talking it over with his wife)

WELL worth watching, this making of..

Back to Bill Murray - probably his best role. I know its a supporting character, and hes only in it here and there, but hes really quite wonderful. The voice of sanity throughout the film: ""Do not do this!"" he tells Michael at one point when hes about to go away with Julie upstate, eating lemons (a detail which makes for a richer film, though of course it makes no sense, and noone knew Bill would be eating them in that shot.. Murray seems to have had the filmmakers in thrall - at one point its mentioned how Murray was pissed off with his room in the apartment in the film and TRASHED IT!

The apartment is on 17th street, which is an interesting detail - as this is a New York City film. The Russian Tearoom is where Dorothy accosts his agent of course. You get the action of the film ending on a street with passers by, very rich detail. Very moving stuff. You totally buy into the reality of the film because it looks so real. The apartment kitchen is tiny, hardly a mirror to look at yourself into, wonderful improvised scene with Sandy there..

I remember watching this on laserdisc.. I don't still have laserdisc, but I think the picture quality is better than the old video (widescreen of course, with subtitles if you like)

The music is lovely (sadly the soundtrack cd is out of print and only available as a Japanese import). And Dabney Coleman plays a jerk so wonderfully! ""Tootsie take ten!""

A few bits were late additions to the film, curiously: Jeff's rambling on at the party in the beginning (where hes rambling on about wanting to open a play ""only when it rains""); Michael Dorsey's teaching of actors (actually, he was addressing actual acting students.. this undoubtedly adds to the films reality)

The film could've gone wrong so many ways. Dustin could have looked perfectly ridiculous in drag (he does mention Some Like It Hot as reference, another wonderful screwball comedy). But the story if affecting, the support work is wonderful. (Jeff is a GIFT to an actor - rather like Shakespeare's Mercutio)",1242172800,2,4261,4.564875491480996

1) I'd easily watch a complete movie about the Dorothy Michaels character regardless if a man played her or not.
2) If the hospital soap opera shown in the movie (Soutwest General) really existed, I think I would enjoy watching it on a daily basis.
3) If the ""Return to Love Cannal"" play really existed, I think I'd also like to go see it.
4) If the movie's central character was either George the agent, Julie the actress or room-mate played by Bill Murray, it would still be worth watching.
To have all of this things work in a single movie is nothing less than a miracle. Add Dustin Hoffman's performance & Dave Grusin's terrific score and you can understand why this is such a true classic.",1239840000,,803,4.4324324324324325

At 116 minutes Tootsie is simply too long to support its one gag; while the movie offers its share of amusing moments, it eventually wears out its welcome and emerges as a fairly forgettable (albeit Best Picture nominated) film.",1232755200,,246,4.857142857142857
519819,4,6302800420,"I'm not sure which film came out first but the similarities between the two are obvious: Man pretends to be a woman to get a desperately needed job but ends up falling in love with a woman and doesn't know how to tell her resulting in humourous events versus woman pretends to be a man who pretends to be a woman to get a desperately needed job but ends up falling in love with a man and doesn't know how to tell him resulting in humourous events.  The most important similarity though is that both films age pretty well and remains entertaining to this day although ""Victor/Victoria"" in my opinion has the edge in terms of better aging and retention of entertainment value.

I found ""Tootsie"" extremely side-splittingly funny the first time I saw it many years ago but as is to be expected with comedies in general in that they are made for the audiences of that time i.e. 1980s here and there are only so many times you can hear a joke before it becomes cliched and just contempt-inducing which is why ""Tootsie"" is so good in that it is still able to retain much of its humour and entertainment value like all classic films should.  The scenes with Pollack and Hoffman I found to be the most entertaining and humourous and I was impressed at director Pollack's acting skills as I thought he was very, very funny in his role as Michael Dorsey's agent.  The cast in general was also very good which is not surprising when you have Bill Murray, Jessica Lange and Teri Garr on board.

The sound quality of this dvd version is pretty good having been given the 5.1 Surround treatment although the picture quality has not been restored giving it a very good VHS quality feel although thankfully very few imperfections such as white spots are noticeable so that overall the picture quality is acceptable.  There are no special features to mention although the anamorphic widescreen side of the disc is the much better way to view this as the full screen version side of the disc just takes too much of the picture away to the point that whole actors are left out of many frames when you compare it with the widescreen version.

Overall an acceptably good dvd standard format version of a good comedy that ages well although the great Dave Grusin soundtrack does have a downside of dating this film with its 80s sounding theme making sure you know that this is an 80s flick.  Still an amusing and enjoyable film to watch.

519822,5,6302800420,"The first time I watched Tootsie was when I was 12 years old, heard this Stephen Bishop song on the TV, and surprised to see an oldmaid clutching a baby and looking admiringly at the baby's mom. The song seems out of place....  [After I finished that second half of the movie, I rewound the Betamax tape--my brother had already watched it full--and re-play the whole thing just for me.]

But later, how Dustin Hoffman made me believe he was a legitimate old lady in heavy makeup, in love with Jessica Lange but cant express it, was amazing.

This is one of the first movie that demonstrated great acting to me. Even Sydney Pollack's (the director himself) banters with Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels are remarkably funny, something that many other movies has imitated afterwards.

It's a comedy, yes, but it also touched on unemployment, single parenthood, struggling for art and principle, how tv soaps are made,... what more can you ask more of a movie? Strong script, great actors, fantastic direction, good song...

The I Might Be You song has since become one of the quintessential wedding songs ever, but everytime Im hearing it in FM, it always reminds me of a man who cant express his love because he's disguised in drag out of necessity. What a combination, but it worked.

I had forgotten that Teri Garr and Bill Murray were in this film.

519824,5,6302800420,"I adore Dustin Hoffman and count him as one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big screen, and even though his recent choices are less than impressive (what has happened to these acting giants; ala Robert De Niro and Al Pacino?) I am still enamored by just about everything he's done pre-2000.  His comedic performance in `Tootsie' is certainly one of his grandest.

Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a hard to get along with actor who cannot seem to find work because of his reputation.  His talent precedes him but his arrogance and stubbornness have caused him to become unwanted.  With this weighting heavily over his head, and the desire to help his friend launch his own stage-play, Dorsey decides to go undercover (way undercover) to get a job, and so that is how Dorothy Michaels comes about, a hotheaded older woman who nabs the new role on a soap.  Her success is instantaneous, fans flocking to her and costars befriending her, not the least of which is Julie Nichols who also manages to catch Dorsey's eye.

The main plot of Dorsey falling for Nichols but being unable to confess his feelings for her without compromising his paycheck really play second fiddle to the real meat of Dorsey's transformation while disguised as Michaels.  Dorsey is able to separate himself from his actions and view the world through a new set of eyes, waking himself to his own inadequacies, but also giving strength to his female fans, on and off the screen, to fight against the stereotypes that bind them so tightly.

The performances are all outstanding, especially from Hoffman who is not only hilarious but also very connected to the emotional journey both of his characters are going through.  Jessica Lange won an Oscar for her performance, and while I don't consider it `amazing' it was tender and genuine and deserving of admiration (but I'm not so sure of an Oscar).  Actually, second to Hoffman is Charles Durning who really should have nabbed a nomination for his wonderfully complete portrayal of Nichols lonely father Les, who happens to take a liking to Dorothy.  His performance is so sincere and moving that the Academy should be ashamed for passing him over.

The rest of the supporting cast is also wonderful, from the late Sydney Pollack to Teri Garr, Bill Murray and a pre-stardom Geena Davis.

The script is brilliantly crafted to be both comedic and heartwarming, and when the Dorsey/Michaels revelation is finally revealed you will find yourself on the floor in the most painfully side splitting uproarious laughter that you will feel compelled to watch the whole film all over again just so you can see that scene in all its glory (you have to watch the whole film for a proper setup).  Hoffman and company really deliver a film that is more than just a comedy, it is a landmark and one of the most influential and recognizable films to the 80's.",1219881600,,2867,4.777327935222672

However, one thing I have never understood is the way this movie was and was not lauded at the time. It was up against 2 other films at the time. While ""Ghandi"" was certainly a superb epic and probably deserved best picture, I will never understand how Ben Kingsley won for best actor over Hoffman. Kingsley could just look at old newsreels to ""get"" his character right. Hoffman had to literally create the Dorothy Michaels character out of nothing but the written word...a much greater challenge for an actor and frankly a performance more deserving of an Oscar. I should also mention that I thought Julie Andrews's performance in ""Victor/Victoria"" was better than Kingsley's as well.

Secondly, I have also never figured out why Geena Davis got best supporting actress. Did people confuse her with Teri Garr (whose performance was much better, richer, and more developed) because the 2 actresses were in the same movie? I can only think of a couple of scenes in which Davis even appeared in the film and none of the scenes are particularly memorable.

There were also many other actresses up for this award from other films. Leslie Ann Warren's performance as the mobster's girlfriend is the one that most comes to mind. One wonders who was sleeping with who to even consider Davis for the nomination.

Nevertheless, ""Tootsie"" did receive its share of awards (Golden Globe, People's Choice, etc.) It just seems like it was unfairly cheated out of many accolades by the Academy.",1203724800,,1739,4.845117845117845

519853,5,6302800420,"It seems that in ""special"" releases, Columbia and Paramount really trail behind Warner Bros., which is why I hesitated somewhat from upgrading my barebones ""Tootsie"" DVD to this 25th Anniversary Edition. The first extras that I looked at were the deleted scenes; there are quite a few short ones here, none of which really deserved to be inserted. Some are mildly amusing, some shouldn't have even been shot in the first place. OK, one extra down, two to go. Next I looked at Dustin Hoffman's ""screen test."" Source material are original betamax tapes of Dustin first doing the Dorothy Michaels character. Although theses tests are very short, they are extremely relevatory into the talents of Hoffman. Between the time he filmed these initial test and the time that his final character was put on film, Hoffman transitioned from a bad drag queen into a believable female. Truly incredible to compare the two performances which are roughly 3 years apart. 2nd extra down, last one to go: ""The Making Of"" documentary. I had no expectations of this whatsoever; expecting a 20 minute assortment of clips and a little narration, instead, we are treated to about an hour and a half of indepth interviews and insight into the creation of this comedy classic. There are current interviews from Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Terri Garr, and Sydney Pollack. The only major player missing is Murray, but it doesn't detract from the documentary. We learn that this movie is one of those amazing occurrances where the right creative team comes together; Hoffman is a difficult to control idea-man who definitely needs to be steered and somewhat restrained. As the Director, Pollack supplied this excellent guidance, and rather than play the movie for bawdy laughter, he went for honesty and truth. Elaine May also apparently gave the film its momentum and helped build all of the intertwined stories that lead to the exciting conclusion of the live Soap Opera reveal at the climax. Bill Murray and Terri Garr gave many classic improv moments, and Jessica Lange gives a very sweet and honest ""straight"" performance. In the interviews, Dabney Coleman tells how nobody ever laughed on the set; it was the editing of Pollack that made all the humor work, and when looking at the movie after hearing this, it is obvious to see the truth in his statement. This documentary all has many behind-the-scenes clips and confrontations between Pollack and Hoffman, who pushed the director to try every possible route and questioned everything about the movie. Large gripe - why couldn't the theatrical trailer have been put on here? It was on the barebones previous release...surely it could have fit on this DVD, too.

For those not familiar with the plot, here it is: Michael Dorsey is a talented but exasperating NYC actor (much like Hoffman apparently) who nobody wants to work with; he drives up budgets and is difficult to work with. Desperate for money, he disguises himself as a woman to win a role on a soap opera. After he gets the role, he must keep it a secret from his girlfriend (Terri Garr), his costar Julie (Jessica Lange) with whom he has fallen for, and from Julie's dad (Charles Durning) who has fallen for him, thinking he is a woman. The longer it continues, the harder it is to keep juggling his life and secrets, and Michael must figure out a solution.

The film itself looks good for its age in this widescreen 2:40:1 transfer in English 5.0. It is a little surprising that there's no commentary track, however, the documentary covers so much it really isn't all that necessary.

519855,5,6302800420,"Like ""Moonstruck"", ""Some Like it Hot"", and a very small handful of other rare gems in the comedy/satire genre, ""Tootsie"" is a perfect movie from the first frame to the last.  From concept to script to cast to production, the result is a flawless and often hilarious film that (like the aforementioned efforts) you will probably end up watching many times.  Sydney Pollack gets it wrong now and then (ugh, the dreadful remake of ""Sabrina""!) but he often gets it right, and in this instance got it sublimely right - and that includes his own on-the-nose supporting performance as Hoffman's theatrical agent.

Dustin Hoffman, in a brilliant and unforgettable performance, plays Michael Dorsey, the gifted but cranky and out-of-work actor who, in desperation, disguises himself as a mature character actress to land a lucrative role in a television soap opera.  Michael's success and growing nationwide fame in the role, however, generate a host of unforeseen problems, not least his growing passion for the soap opera's leading lady (Jessica Lange), whose father (the inimitable Charles Durning) develops a parallel passion for the ""actress"" he thinks his daughter works with.  Eventually, Michael begins racking his brains for a way to get out of his contract without sending his agent and himself to prison for fraud.  His solution, revealed toward the end of the film, has become a classic scene.  Along the way, gender inequality is slyly and cleverly explored, but the issue is never used to beat the viewer over the head.  The message and the narrative are seamlessly entwined.

A faultless supporting cast, headed by Bill Murray as Hoffman's playwright roommate, Teri Garr as Michael's despairing protegee, and Dabney Coleman as the obnoxious, chauvinist television director, make substantial contributions to the delightful experience that this movie is with performances that could have been two-dimensional, but aren't.

I already owned the video but I recently decided to get the DVD and it is very well done.  Go Tootsie Go!",1151712000,,368,4.27536231884058
519899,1,6302800420,"To begin with the movie Tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic. This movie is produced in New York. The protagonist is Michael Dorsey and he is the most important character in the film. The situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman. For the reason that he cannot continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed  by that time. So there is where Dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous. He gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman. In addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera. Thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing. He has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he didn't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman. The characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing. THe way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear  women's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent. Because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work. The stes in the movie are really well done and I like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man. The lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated. The costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok. Furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting, there were not that much music but it was ok. This movie could be reall in life because  sometimes when people don't have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job.

I will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life.",1151452800,5,2276,4.085011185682327

I do not particularly like Dustin Hoffman - he's a great actor but he just never quite does it for me.  BUT I love him in Tootsie.  Actually, I differentiate between Tootsie and Michael Dorsey.  As Michael Dorsey Hoffman is okay; as Toosie he is superlative.  And I make the distinction because this is the only cross-dressing film where I totally buy into the reality of the character.  The role of Tootsie is the part of lifetime -and Hoffman is outstanding in it.  He has us laughing, crying, cheering, and even producing outrage.  We sympathize with his rejection by Jessica Lange (she's not a lesbian) and wait anxiously for Bill Murray's ""You [...]"" in response to Tootsie's almost rape by her plummy co-star in the soap opera.

Every actor in this film is perfect - from cameos by Sydney Pollack (director) as Michael Dorsey's agent to Terri Garr as the confused and desperate actress/girlfriend to Bill Murray as the slightly spacy roommate.  And there's Dabney Coleman and Charles Durning and Jessica Lange.  And best of all - Dustin Hoffman IS Tootsie, maybe even more than he is Michael Dorsey.",1150761600,,1275,4.719457013574661

Moreover, the movie is far more than just funny - it also explores very worthwhile aspects of gender politics and taboos, and the script is extremely well written and believable (there are no false lines).  Outstanding acting all around, although Dustin Hoffman (one of the premier actors of the 20th and 21st centuries, in the opinion of this reviewer) clearly steals the show in perhaps his greatest, least typical role.  In almost any other year, Hoffman would have won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal, and the movie itself would have won the Best Picture Oscar.  Unfortunately, it was 1982, and Hoffman and ""Tootsie"" were up against Ben Kingsley and ""Gandhi"".

Also, one final correction to a previous review - Teri Garr actually played the confused (actually, misled) girlfriend of Dustin Hoffman's male character, not Jessica Lange.",1149984000,,905,5.040268456375839
519902,5,6302800420,"Dustin Hoffman, arguably one of the most popular actors of the 1980s and 90s, is in top form here -- but this time as a woman.  Sure, there have been other films with similar setups -- ""Victor/Victoria"" with Julie Andrews and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" with Robin Williams, to name just two.  Andrews, however, isn't believable as a man, and while Williams is exceptional in ""Doubtfire,"" that movie seems to lose its ""edge"" near the end.  In ""Tootsie,"" Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, and Dabney Coleman all provide laudable -- even outstanding -- performances.  Lange won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and Garr was nominated in that category.  Dustin Hoffman was nominated for Best Actor, Sidney Pollack for Best Director, and the film for Best Picture.  Why didn't it win any of those three?  One word -- ""Gandhi.""  Nevertheless, ""Tootsie"" looks as though it were fun to make, and it is certainly fun to watch.  This is an absolute must for Dustin Hoffman fans.",1141257600,,955,4.845679012345679
519903,4,6302800420,"The premise of Tootsie is as follows.  Middle-aged actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is having great difficulty finding employment.  Although he is talented at his craft, he is very difficult to work with - he often criticizes and faults the logic of his directors and co-actors, and has acquired a reputation in the theater business and every other acting venue as someone prickly and unpleasant.  Though Michael gets by with his day job as a waiter, he now needs extra money in order to produce a play written by his roommate, Jeff (Bill Murray).  Out of desperation, he finds himself auditioning for a role in a day time soap opera.  The role, however, is meant to be filled by a woman.  Undeterred, Michael disguises himself as a woman, an actress by the name of Dorothy Michaels, and by sheer will and pluck, lands the lucrative role on the show.  Only his roommate and his long-suffering agent know of the scheme.  Soon Michael finds that what he thought would be a temporary supporting role as a firm, no-nonsense hospital administrator has turned into a sensation, his character inspiring millions of people.  He also falls in love with one of his co-workers, the lovely Julie (Jessica Lange).

Material such as this has the potential to be treated in a lame or stupid way, but 'Tootsie' is a smart film; the screenwriter and director obviously understood the characters, and knew what missteps and pitfalls to avoid.  The humor is wonderful, oftentimes relying on subtle timing and inflections of tone, and the way the characters and story evolve is captivating.  Take the relationship between Julie and Michael.  She knows him as her matronly co-worker, and begins to lean upon him as a friend.  He is growing increasingly attracted to her but, in order to keep up his disguise, cannot act on his impulses; instead, he uses his role as a woman to truly listen to Julie and get to know her as a person.  In his disguise of Dorothy Michaels, Michael Dorsey finds himself responding with genuine compassion and understanding to another person.

The performances are wonderful.  Dustin Hoffman plays his role with force, energy, conviction and humor.  Jessica Lange brings warmth and thoughtfulness to her character, and Bill Murray is a riot as the deadpan roommate.  The screenplay gives them intelligent things to talk about, and explores not only what it's like to be a struggling actor, but issues of personal identity and gender politics.  Tootsie is a clever, delightful and thoroughly enjoyable film.",1140739200,,2518,4.935866983372922
519904,5,6302800420,"I rate ""Tootsie"" 5 stars because it's humorous, the music is uplifting and the acting is superb!

""Tootsie"" is about an out-of-work actor played by Dustin Hoffman, who decides that women have it easier when getting movie parts, so he concocts a scheme unbeknowst to his agent. The scheme consists of Dustin Hoffman dressing up as an older woman, who auditions for a soap. Fortunately, for him he gets the soap and that's just the beginning...

I highly recommend this 80's film for anyone who is either a Dustin Hoffman fan, or who likes a light-hearted comedy with an interesting twist to it!

Rent or buy it--you'll be glad you did, I was!

519905,4,6302800420,"Tootsie is a complicated film to say the least. An actor has perhaps too much pride in his art for his own good and subsequently alienates any director he ever could've hoped to work for. He needs to finance his friend's play, but he can't find work. The obvious solution: disguise himself as an actress and get a part on a daytime drama.

In the wrong hands, this could've played out like a daytime drama, but smart dialog, careful direction, and brilliant performances give the film a clever grace that raise it above the trappings of its plot. Watching Dustin Hoffman obliviously speak out against his own discretions force us to somewhat reevaluate our own views about gender. I can't think of another actor who could've pulled off that character, even those who have given great drag performances (I'm not referring to the Wayans brothers, in case you were wondering). Bill Murray also achieved brilliance as the roommate who does his best to take everything in stride but thinks that maybe ""we're going into a weird area here.""

The eighties-ness might be a little much at times (and I was a little dumbfounded hearing my mother sing along to one of the musical interludes from the next room), but this film is as entertaining as it is contrived. It doesn't logically work (and I'm a little curious how they wrote Hoffman's character off the show after his secret was revealed), but in a film this inspired, who cares?",1135987200,2,1424,4.737903225806452
519926,5,6302800420,"Hoffman really shines here as the bitter, tempermental actor who alienates the entire showbiz world.  From the beginning, the audience is shown that his life is empty and he's pursuing something that he can't yet lay his hands on.  Becoming a drag queen allows him to abandon his tarnished image and reinvent himself as a star.  Along the way, the development of his alter ego causes him to see the flaws in his personality that have driven people away.  It sounds very Lifetime Network, but the comedy potential is explored to the fullest as Hoffman really plays up the inevitable uncomfortable moments that arise.

Plus, how can you not love a movie with Bill Murray as a struggling playwright putting on his newest work, ""Return to the Love Canal""?  Genius.",1135814400,,760,4.8076923076923075

I love everything about it-the acting-the comedy,the meaning and THE CAST!!!!!Dustin Hoffman,Jessica Lange,Bill Murry,Teri Garr,Dabney Colman,Charles Durning-all turning in terrific performances. Now to the film itself-'Tootsie' is a hilereous yet sensative portrayal of an arrogent male chauvanist actor named Michael Dorsey (Hoffman) who's agent insists he's unhirable. So he 'invents' a new character for himself in the BEYOND out spoken 'Dorthy' Michaels and lands a job in a soap opera intended for his overly sensative girlfriend Sandy (Garr)'Dorthy's' antics and star power bring fame to her but confusion to Dorsey,who finds himself falling in love with his beautiful co star Julie (Lange) who's kind and lonely dad Les (Durning) wants to marry 'Dorthy'.Even incognito Michael Dorsey learns to see things through a woman's point of few-on the soap opera 'Dorthy' is condecsended to and often taken advantage of by the cast and crew,to the point where she begins improvising her lines-leading to this movie's funniest moments. But sadly 'Dorthy's world falls apart fast due to a series of confusing events-a box of chocolates from Les leads Sandy to think Michael is gay,'Dorthy' nearly locks lips with Julie leading her to think 'Dorthy' is a lesbian and the people at the soap want 'Dorthy' on for another year. So in the end Michael Dorsey invents a bizzare story to explain why his character is in fact 'not Emily Kimberly. IT'S EDWARD KIMBERLY!EDWARD KIMBERLY!!!,leading to one of the most funny scenes in the movie as well as the most shocking. Yes once the deception is revealed Michael's career goes through the roof but he alienates Sandy,earns a belt in the chops from Julie and breaks Les's heart. The movie ends on an open note as he regains speaking terms with Julie and admits he was 'a better woman with her then a man and just needed to do it without the dress'.And as not to offend Julie further he finds a way to maintaina friendship with Les who admits to finding Michael Dorsey to be 'okay company'.I think outside the laugh a minute comedy and the twists and turns this movie has a nice message to it about understanding sexual sensativity and the opposit sex. So even though there's 'drag' involved this is not a gay movie-it has to to with male/female relationships and the resulting twists and turns.

Surprisingly, the jokes, the relationships, and the theme of the movie don't seem dated at all.  That's probably why ""Tootsie"" is the number two comedy of all-time according to the AFI (""Some Like It Hot"" being number one, with a theme not too coincidentally similar to Tootsie's).

Dustin Hoffman turns in one of his best performances as a womanizing, self-centered actor who learns what it's like to be the opposite sex.  After all these years, this movie still makes me laugh out loud.

My only complaint with the DVD is that there are not many features on it.  There was a lot of notoriety surrounding the production of the film, and it seems that there were a countless number of screenwriters who were hired to polish the script.  It would be interesting to hear some interviews with Dustin Hoffman, director Sydney Pollack, and screenwriters Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal, who admitted never having even met one another until after the film was released.

Kingsley went on to win the award for his brilliant performance as the revolutionary Indian peace maker, but, if it hadn't been for that tough shut out in the Oscars race, Hoffman could've taken home the little golden man for himself, that year.  This is a great, great film that I think is enjoyable on many levels.  For starters, Hoffman's comic timing is showcased here, as his character, Michael Dorsey, an unemployed, down-on-his-luck actor takes on an alter ego in Dorothy Michaels.  Michaels is an outspoken, dowdy and very sassy middle aged woman who lands a major part on a daytime soap--launching his/her career.

Not only is the humor fast and furious, in this movie, but it is also a touching portrayal of a man best-described as a chauvinist, who goes through an epiphany when he takes on the identity of a woman.  He has to do some soul searching as to how he relates to women in the world, and the general attitude men in society have toward the ""weaker/second sex.""

His handling of the typical feminine prejudices is wonderful and his suffering in his longing for Jessica Lange (in a deserved supporting actress Oscar role) is touching.  TOOTSIE works on all levels:  as a statement of how women were treated then; as a statement that just because men dress up like women, they aren't gay; and what a brilliant cast that supports Hoffman and Lange:  Syndey Pollack (the movie's director) as Hoffman's agent; Bill Murray in his superbly understated role as Hoffman's roommate and playwright friend; the marvelous Teri Garr (she was also nominated) as his best friend and one time lover; Charles Durning as Lange's father who falls in love with Dorothy; George Gaynes as the sexcrazed daytime drama star; Doris Belack (from ONE LIFE TO LIVE) as the show's producer; and Dabney Coleman as Lange's boyfriend.

 Suffice to say it is a water tight and flawless script, the pace of comedy and emerging anxst is perfectly timed.

 The story involves Hoffman as a good but ""difficult"" actor, struggling to find work and love in the Big Apple. His success rate at both tasks is becoming evermore elusive and impossible. After a disaster of a Birthday Party in which his dilemmas are acutely focussed, he consoles himself by helping a struggling female friend and actor, to prepare for an audition; the part of a hospital soap matriarch.

 When the friend fails to get the part the idea to try himself as herself emerges. Truly brilliant themes are comedically explored, sexual politics, self identity and exploration and the equality of the difficulties of being either male or female emerge. Made all the more powerful by it's lead performances, Hoffman and Lang are outstanding, the film is also strengthened by having being made in the 80's; the ultimate sexual politics era! A must see, you'll miss ""Dorothy"" just like Lang does!",1108339200,4,1115,4.81151832460733
519957,5,6302800420,"This is one of the best and funniest comedies of all time.

I've read the original script and it's brilliant.  The only difference in the film is Bill Murray's character: in the script he's described as the stereotypical New York playwright with a pipe and a tweed jacket with elbow pads, but his lines are the same.  Bill Murray gives the role some of the film's biggest laughs, but it's also fun to picture a droll, academic-looking guy saying his lines.

The casting is wonderful.  It was good to see Jessica Lange win the Best Supporting Oscar but DUSTIN HOFFMAN SHOULD HAVE WON FOR THIS MOVIE!  No, I wouldn't take away his other Oscars--but TOOTSIE is the role where you see a master at work.  There are times I watch this movie simply to watch his expressions.  It's a part that works on numerous levels and Hoffman is funny on every one of them.

Director Sydney Pollack not only flawlessly keeps the timing of the humor going, but he also contributes an authentic performance as Michael Dorsey--er, Dorothy Michael's agent.

My only disappointment was that the DVD does not have a bunch of extras about the film.  Director's commentary, actor's commentary, even the writer's commentary--all would be fascinating, I'm sure.

(One last note: I'm originally from Ohio and, for 20 years, I've had to convince some friends and family to watch this film because they didn't want to watch a ""gay movie.""  Any movie where a guy dresses up like a girl has to be a gay movie.  Don't believe it.

519958,5,6302800420,"I was surprised when ""Tootsie"" made #2 on the American Film Institute's poll of the top 100 comedies of all-time; pretty good for a film that 'doesn't get noticed anymore.' I'm not sure if I'd rank it that high, but I do agree, it's a great, almost perfect comedy. There's a lot of movies built around a similar premise of a man trying to impersonate a female, but what makes ""Tootsie"" stand out is how it never gets too low-brow and how it explores every worthy nuance of that premise.

It's pretty amazing how well this film works as both popcorn entertainment and as a feminist classic. Lots of pictures have tried to be both, like ""What Women Want,"" but fail miserably because they're either not funny/entertaining at all or really shallow or even dumb. The comedy never lets up in ""Tootsie,"" but Michael's (Dustin Hoffman's character) growing sympathy and understanding of what it's like to be a woman is always there. I was pretty surprised at how much this picture meant to Hoffman when he interviewed for it on CBS. A surprisingly emotional interview, he basically said that before the picture, he was 'brainwashed' at how he was supposed to perceive women, and coming out of it, he felt guilty for having ignored/shortchanged/misjudged so many people before because of that mindset he used to have.

I don't want to ruin any jokes, so I'll just repeat that it's a very funny picture. All the performances are excellent, especially Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange. The only real complaint I have is the music, which feels a bit too dated.

As for the DVD, this was released fairly recently, and it seems to be a good transfer from an excellent print. You get an anamorphic picture, which is great if you have a widescreen set, and there's a new 5.1 mix but it's not exactly a sophisticated soundtrack. It's also a two-sided disc, full-frame on one side, widesceen on the other, but each side only has about 4.1 GB of data, meaning the resolution isn't going to be great, and it shows in the long-shots and even medium shots where the facial details don't seem very defined. No real extras, which is unfortunate because even if they can't get Pollack, Hoffman, Lange, Garr, Murray, etc. to do commentary, there's plenty of available material that would've been nice (like Hoffman's emotional interview). Unless there's a 25th anniversary edition in the works for 2007, this is probably your best bet on home video.",1099872000,4,2422,4.761904761904762

I don't know how true this story is, or even how convincing he is as a woman, but thank goodness this movie was made.
I can't think of another movie more perfectly cast except.... maybe... Casablanca?  Jessica Lange is perfect as the beautiful soap actress and love interest.  Charles Durning is perfect as the sweet older man who falls in love with Dustin's ""Dorothy"".  Terri Garr is perfect as the insecure female friend who loses the role on the soap to ""Dorothy"".  Bill Murray is great in his few scenes - this is one of the first movies where we actually got to see him ""act"".  Dabney Coleman is perfect as the arrogant director of the soap who cheats on poor Jessica.  Director Sydney Pollack wisely casts himself perfectly as Dustin's exasperated agent.  (The scene early on where he informs Dustin that NO ONE will hire him because he's too ""difficult"" is fantastic.) Lastly, Dustin Hoffman is perfect as the actor who becomes a better man by pretending to be a woman.

When a failing actor cross dresses to get a job, he also discovers the inconveniences of being a ""woman of the 80s"". Throughout the film, there's always a pleasing sense of cynical humor (e.g., ""I don't believe in hell. I believe in unemployment, but not in hell"") and Hoffman is topnotch in his role.
The from Morricone has a somewhat grating refrain of Stephen Bishop's ""It might be you"" but I guess it perfectly serves its purpose, providing the touching backdrop to the actor's increasing awareness of the strength of feminine qualities -- the touch of the baby to his cheek, the poignant sight of Julie's skirt swishing in the kitchen, the offering to Dorothy of her chocolate-covered finger to suck, etc.
I can see that Hoffman must have committed to this movie bigtime, and I notice that there's a book that describes the making of this film but is currently out of print.

519963,5,6302800420,"Dustin Hoffman is a fantastic character actor, one of the all time greats.  He is superb in this movie.  He is an actor who can't get a job as a man but through circumstances, ends up getting a woman's part in a soap opera.  The cast thinks he is a woman and it really was funny watching Hoffman try to keep them from learning he was a man.  This movie was really funny and yet it had a lot of drama and humanity included.
 I found his portrayal of a woman more interesting and likable than that of the male character, in fact, there were times that I would get so wrapped up in the character, Dorothy, that I would forget that he was a man acting as a woman.  The cast, Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Bill Murray, Charles Durney, Geena Davis, were all great.

In Tootsie, made in the 80s, Hoffman disguises himself as a middle-aged woman to land a part in a TV soap opera. He gets the job, but his biggest reward is getting to see the way the world treats women.
Dabney Coleman plays the laconic roommate with deadpan humor, and Geena Davis, before anyone knew who she was, plays the confused girlfriend.

519986,5,6302800420,"When I first saw this film more than 20 years, I really did not fully appreciate then what director Sydney Pollack, his cast, and his crew had achieved. To be sure, I found the humor hilarious, the cross-dressing and gender-bending clever, and all of the performances first-rate. I have the same opinion today. However, in ways and to an extent no previous film had done, Tootsie makes certain assertions which have serious implications, then and now. For example, that at least some men can more fully develop their masculinity by recognizing their femininity, as indeed Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels (Dustin Hoffman) does. And the same is also true of at least some women. Moreover, this film effectively demonstrates how difficult it can often be to gain and then sustain another's complete trust. To salvage his acting career, Michael repositions himself as Dorothy so he will be hired to play a character in a soap opera. As Dorothy, he establishes an especially close relationship with another cast member, Julie (Jessica Lange), and falls in love with her while continuing to deceive her. Later, her widower father Les (Charles Durning) falls in love with Dorothy and thus becomes another unwitting victim of Michael's deceit. The eventual happy ending does not include Les.
Shakespeare never devised for his Italian comedies a plot as complicated as the one Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal provided for Tootsie. Under Pollack's direction, all of the cast members provide brilliant performances, notably Bill Murray as Michael's friend Jeff and George Gaynes as John Van Horn, another cast member. Jessica Lange was selected to receive an Academy Award as best actress and deserved it. Much of this film is hilarious, it is always entertaining, but as I indicated previously, having seen it again recently, I find it much bolder and more thought-provoking now than I did 21 years ago. To some, perhaps, its serious implications may even seem threatening.",1064188800,13,1965,5.163009404388715
519987,5,6302800420,"In 1982, Dustin Hoffman played one of his most memorable roles as Michael Dorsey in the hilarious comedy, ""Tootsie"".  As an out-of-work actor, Michael teaches acting classes because no director will hire him due to his somewhat peremptory attitude, or so says his agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack, who also directed the film).  Frustrated with being undesirable and wanting to prove himself, Michael dons a dress and high heels so that he can apply for a female role in a television soap opera.  Calling himself Dorothy Michaels, the soap opera director, Ron (Dabney Coleman), thinks that Dorothy is too ugly for the part, but Dorothy's dominance earns 'her' the right to a screen test and 'she' gets hired!  As the film progresses, Michael's pretense as a woman earns him the stardom and recognition that he longed for.  However, it also gets him into trouble not only with a woman that he's dating, Sandy (Teri Garr), but also with two of the regular stars from the soap opera, Julie (Jessica Lange) and John Van Horn (George Gaynes).
With an excellent script, superb acting and a hilarious story, it was completely unsurprising that ""Tootsie"" earned 10 Oscar nominations, including nominations for Best Picture, Best Director (Syndey Pollack), Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay.  Dustin Hoffman was nominated for Best Actor and both Teri Garr and Jessica Lange were nominated for Best Supporting Actress.  Of all the Oscar nominations, only Jessica Lange won the Oscar.  Dustin Hoffman won the Golden Globe for Best Actor, as did Jessica Lange for Best Supporting Actress.  The number of Oscar nominations that the film earned demonstrated the many strengths of the film, not to mention that the film will keep you laughing and fully engaged!
Other very memorable characters in the film include Julie's father Les (Charles Durning), Michael's roommate Jeff (Bill Murray), soap opera producer Rita (Doris Belack) and soap opera nurse April (a young Geena Davis).
If you enjoy films such as ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959) and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" (1993), you will more than likely enjoy ""Tootsie"" equally as well.  I rate ""Tootsie"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and am very pleased to own it on DVD.",1052265600,28,2205,5.016438356164383
519988,3,6302800420,"In 1982s Tootsie, Dustin Hoffman plays actor Michael Dorsey, who through his obnoxious perfectionism has managed to alienate every producer in America.  His agent, George Fields (the films director Sydney Pollack), is exasperated and cant even get Michael work in commercials.  Dorsey learns of an opening on a popular daytime soap opera, but it is for a womans part.  He decides to dress up as a woman and auditions as Miss Dorothy Michaels.  He wins the part and in the process, becomes quite popular in the role.  On the set, he meets castmate Julie (a luminous Jessica Lange) for whom he falls in love with.  Of course, Julie has no idea that Dorothy is a man and she confides many things to him.  Complications ensue when Julies widowed father, Les (Charles Durning), falls in love with Dorothy and pursues her.  In the end, Michael reveals himself to Julie and exclaims that being a woman has made him a better man.  The rest of the supporting cast is quite good in the film especially Bill Murray as Michaels roommate Jeff and Teri Garr as a neurotic actress, Sandy.  Tootsie was co-written by M*A*S*H creator Larry Gelbart and directed by Sydney Pollack and was widely acclaimed upon its release.  The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Actor for Mr. Hoffman, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture and two Best Supporting Actresses, Ms. Garr and Ms. Lange, but Ms. Lange took home the films only Oscar.  While Tootsie is well acted and funny, it is very contrived.  The film relies on most of the same old jokes that have appeared in most other movies or TV episodes where cross-dressing is involved, but instead of giving in to the silliness like a film like Some Like It Hot does, it tries too be highbrow humor.  The film deserves recognition because many of the performances as first rate, but the overall film is highly overrated.

520015,4,6302800420,"If ever a movie got robbed on Oscar night, it was TOOTSIE.  Up against the historical powerhouse GANDHI, it didn't stand much of a chance.  But in any other year, it would clearly have swept the statuettes off the stage.
This sublime comedy is a must for every aspiring actor, not only for the message it delivers about the need for talent to be tempered by professionalism, but also for the sheer quality of the acting on display.  There's not a single actor in the entire piece who fails the script.  The editing is particularly crisp, often adding a comic punctuation of its own.
For me, the standout actor is not Dustin Hoffman but the highly underrated Sydney Pollack.  As Michael Dorsey's frustrated agent, and the only character actually in opposition to Dorsey's impersonation, his sense of frustration and confusion provides, I think, the funniest moments in the film.  What's even more impressive is that his character echoes his behind-the-scenes role.  As the film's director, his principle duty is to make sure that the film coheres into a logical narrative.  Similarly, as Dorsey's agent, he provides a lot of that necessary narration.  Though many of Pollack's lines are not only hilariously funny, they also serve to better define Dorsey and provide answers to fill in potential plot holes.  In the end, the audience is twice served by Pollack.  Not only does he direct with great comic assuredness, his character crucially makes Dorsey's madness believable.
What makes this DVD disappointing is not its film.  No, the woeful lack of any special features is simply inexcusable.  There is really no reason to buy the DVD over the cheaper VHS.

Who out there thinks that TOOTSIE should not only have commentary but also deleted scenes, a gag reel (can you imagine how funny a gag reel would be for this movie?), a nice featurette, and for God's sake, at LEAST a freakin' theatrical trailer!!  That's right, they couldn't even come up with a theatrical trailer.  I know that Columbia had been planning an anniversary special release for Tootsie for about two years now.  This is what they come up with?
I'm sure that what happened was, someone at Columbia noticed how so many DVDs are being rereleased, sometimes only a few months after their initial release.  Hence, making consumers buy the same thing over again.  Ya know, there are a sea of good movies out there and people work hard for their money.  Is there any way that these movie distributors can stop being so selfish and just do it right the first time?

It is a great comedy. This movie has  perfect timing -- just that rhythm that makes you laugh. I won't  overanalyze. But man, it works. Scene after scene just works. You never hit  a false note.
What movie ever kick started more character actors'  careers? Dabney Coleman made hay for about a decade in spinoffs of his  creepy director. Geena Davis had just a few lines, but her career really  only started when Dorothy Michaels gave her some ""tips"" in the  dressing room. Doctor Brewster is a blustery, flustered riot; he got some  TV roles from this movie. Jessica Lange got an Oscar -- maybe the only one  for this movie, which was a travesty. Sidney Pollack, playing Michael  Dorsey's agent while he directed, gets some amazing laughs. And when you  watch the movie, you'll see a bunch more little gems of performances. The  producer of the soap is great. And what about Bill Murray? I almost forgot  him. Somebody really cast this movie incredibly well. Oh, and Charles  Durning. Oh, and Teri Garr is perfect. And... and...
Amazon maybe isn't  the place to pick apart a bunch of serious themes, but Tootsie also packs  some ideological bang. The whole premise is that Dustin Hoffman's actor is  a self centered perfectionist, and that he figures a lot of things out  (about women, about himself) while he's wearing his wig to make a buck.  You're going to laugh when Michael's desperate to do the Eleanor Roosevelt  story, sure, but there's something there, too. If there's another, better  movie about the relationship between the sexes I haven't seen it.
Cutting  it short: Tootsie is the only romantic comedy I can think of that really  deserved a Best Picture award. It doesn't get remembered much, but it's a  five star movie without a doubt, and it really deserves more recognition.",966211200,4,2041,4.6155988857938715

In a desperate act to get work he disguises himself as Dorothy Michaels, an older Southern woman, and lands a job in a soap opera. Soon he finds not only is he a better person as a woman, but he is falling in love with his costar, played by Jessica Lange.
TOOTSIE has a complex and superb script, and great performances all around. Bill Murray is a standout as Hoffman's writer/roomate, as is Sydney Pollack who cast himself as the troublesome actor's agent, who has to cope with his client's antics. Also, surprisingly, TOOTSIE's cinematography is very expressive and of a high quality.
The real highlight of TOOTSIE is not Dustin Hoffman in a dress, but rather the film's complex messages. One thing TOOTSIE comment's on is society's resentment of powerful or assertive women, and how meeker or more submissive women are often times used and taken advantage of. The film also relates how unattractive women are usually overlooked by men, because they are judged physically and not by their personalities.
TOOTSIE is a film that is leaps and bounds ahead of MRS. DOUBTFIRE, highly enjoyable, and very watchable too.  END",965433600,4,1256,4.869158878504673

I must be honest, I am not generally a Dustin Hoffman fan, but if  I had to say, I'd rate this movie as one of his best.  It raises an  interesting question, ""What does a guy do who's down on his luck, does  something desperate and, afterwards, when common sense reigns again, he  finds that he can't back out of the choice he has made without ruining his  life?""  This is basically the idea behind this movie, and Hoffman does  an incredible job as the nervous, slightly overbearing, not-so-slightly  arrogant theater teacher who is forced into an unbelievable set of  circumstances as a result of his rather unorthodox method of finding work.  There is some absolutely priceless interplay between the characters here.  This movie really makes one wonder what one values in a relationship --  platonic or otherwise. Have I intrigued you enough?  Final analysis: Like I  said, this is one of Hoffman's best, and a great suggestion if you wanted  to rent a comedy over the weekend, but unless you enjoy some very  fast-paced, sitcom-like humor in your movies, this is not one to see twice.",965347200,4,1241,4.610091743119266
520049,5,6302800420,"Tootsie succeeds on virtually every level: as an all-out laugh fest; as a moving and tender love story; as a drama about a man coming to grips with what he is all about; and as an entertaining backstage comedy, giving us a  wonderfully detailed view behind the footlights in the world of television.  Capping all of the luminous achievements here is Dustin Hoffman's most  gigantic, wholehearted, and expansive role.  His Tootsie (Dorothy Michaels)  is such a rich-blooded and fully developed character that you would swear  she existed outside the body of Michael Dorsey (Dustin's character in the  film).  The journey of one man, who is passionate about his craft -- acting  -- coming to grips with his often unstable love life, and the reasons for  it, is nuanced, clever, inventive and so very funny, filled with superb  performances.  Jessica Lange provides a mysterious and melancholy allure as  Michael's object of affection; Dabney Coleman is perfectly repulsive as a  chauvinist pig (he plays them so well); Bill Murray has some of the movie's  best lines as Michael's grunge room-mate.  Still, Teri Garr emerges above  nearly everyone with her vulnerable, hilarious and utterly truthful  portrayal of a woman clearly in love with her best friend.  Complications  ensue beyond your wildest imagination, and the comic unfolding -- before  your eyes -- of every plot twist is a wonder to behold.  This movie also  makes a heartfelt and delicate statement about the woman and man in all of  us. Though it clearly is set in the late 70s/early 80s, the story and  characters have simply not aged.  This is a classic movie, one to be  cherished.",962064000,,1648,4.963235294117647
520050,5,6302800420,"Tootsie - where would the film world be without this 1982 comedy?  I  proudly own one of the funniest films, and it is gets watched over and over  - still to this day.  Why?  Dustin Hoffman features as an out of work actor  who takes a up a role as female lead on a TV soap.  Sound easy?  Not at  all.  To achieve this, he has to become a woman and that is where the film  achieves so much magic.  Watching Hoffman play Dorohty is so convincing  that by the end of the movie you forget it's him - Dorothy takes on a life  of her own.  The story is never short of entertaining, and features other  stars such as Jessica Lange, and Dabney Corman.  I must admit, I am not a  big fan of Lange but this movie doesnt let her steal the thunder - that is  for Hoffman and Dorothy.  Without giving too much of the film plot away, I  promise those that have not seen it a fantastic 90+ minutes of film. You'll  understand why they call Hoffman a character actor even more after seeing  it. 5+ stars in fact for this movie !",961459200,3,1013,4.030456852791878
520051,5,6302800420,I thought Mrs Doubtfire was good but then i saw this and discovered Mrs Doubtfire was just repeating every comedic act from this movie. Dustin Hoffman was funnier at doing a lady's voice than Robin Williams.i saw Mrs  D. before i saw Tootsie and i thought this movies funniest part would be  the part where she picks a wedgie which is kind of old but there were even  a lot of parts that weren't even supposed to be funny but were anyway! this  movie could have very well been rated R for plenty of sexuality and tons of  language so this one is not for kids.this movie is still a  must-buy!,961372800,,591,4.2792792792792795
520052,5,6302800420,"Tootsie is one my all time favorite films. It has one of the best actors of all times, Dustin Hoffman playing drag.  I think this is probably his best acting ever.  He is hilarious as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels.
He is playing an out of work actor, a very out of work actor who wants a  job so desperately.  He decides to dress in women's clothes and try to get  a job as a woman.  He does a better job there!  He lands a job on a soap  opera, and his character, Dorothy Michaels is adored by the fans, and one  older doctor on staff, played by Uncle Henry from Punky  Brewster.
Dorothy/Michael takes things in stride and soons learns a great  deal about himself and how he is with women.
I recently viewed Tootsie  again.  I had seen it in the movies when it came out at least twice. This  is one of the best comedies of all time.  The screenplay for this movie is  awesome. Hoffman gets some of the best lines ever heard on film. Bill  Murray gets a couple of good lines too.  He was very good in this movie.  Jessica Lange was outstanding, and very deservant of her Best supporting  Actress award.  She was perfect in this film, not a single flaw.  The  acting from everyone was just great.  When ""Dorothy"" decides to  reveal the real truth on live t.v. is one of the best movie scenes of all  time.  There isn't a scene in this movie I didn't like. This whole movie is  wonderful from start to finish, a truly great comedy that I think everyone  should add to their video collection.",960854400,12,1491,4.281588447653429
520053,5,6302800420,Tootsie is nothing short of amazing. Dustin Hoffman gives on of his funniest and greatest performances ever. A New York actor needs money. But no one in the acting buisness will work with him. So Michael Dorsey(Dustin  Hoffman) disguises himself as a woman and gets highered in America's #1  soap opera. This film is funny and sometimes dramatic. An excellent romp.  Everybody will love it!,958435200,,390,4.969230769230769

7831896,5,6302800420,"I rarely give a five-star review. The bench-mark here is extremely high  (Think: Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane, Platoon...). Yet, here it is: a 1982 comedy (and how many comedies rate 5 stars, say, after three decades?) but I have no problem here.

Hadn't seen this movie in 30 years. I laughed as much today (2018) as I did back in 82 when I saw with a theatre-full of people laughing their heads off. And it's STILL an outstanding piece of collaborative creativity.

This package: In addition to the movie, a series of ""making of"" features. ALSO outstanding. For some reason, the star and director were filmed while making the movie itself, offering an incredible glimpse of what it takes to make a classic movie. Hoffman's vintage screen tests--as much for his wardrobe and make-up as his performance--survived and are used here. Interviews shot 25 years after the fact. The result is sometimes as hilarious and poignant as the movie itself.

You want to know how a movie is made? Don't skip the ""bonus"" material. You'll have a new appreciation of what it takes (Hoffman, two writers and director/actor Sidney Pollack) to simply get a script that all believe can be a good movie: At least years of work, and once the cameras were rolling, it kept evolving, DAILY.

And you learn what this story and its characters meant to all these people. All the principles--men and women--came away different people at the end of it all.

Fabulous.",1526169600,,1441,4.790322580645161
