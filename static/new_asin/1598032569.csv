7799934,5,1598032569,"I am going over these with my 12 and 14 year old children. We home school and it is part of their history. We like them so much that I wish I had them with my older children. There are some paintings which some may have a problem with and it would be good to educate your children in what is a brothel, etc. These promote discussion which needs to happen anyway between parents and children in the home. The professor is very articulate and knowledgeable. He presents in an interesting way and helps you to see design, color, etc.",1370044800,3,530,4.31

William Kloss, the lecturer, is quite knowledgeable, but more than that he loves his topic. As well, as the development of art, he brings the history of the Netherlands into his discussion (he really has to if it's all to come together), as well as the personal history of the artists. His discussion of Rembrandt can be quite moving. Rembrandt's love for his wife, and later after her death, his love for his mistress, and the consequences of that love are touching. The rejection of his painting for the Amsterdam Town Hall moves me to this day. Of course, Rembrandt cut down the painting after that, hoping to find another buyer, so we only have intimations of what he'd originally painted through a drawing he'd sketched on a napkin. Today that painting isn't even in the NL, it's in Sweden, and Rembrandt painted it to represent the Dutch spirit. Actually I could go on about many of the artists, and my first introduction to several of them was this lecture course. For instance, while Vermeer was Catholic in a VERY protestant Netherlands, don't make the mistake of assuming The Pearl is an accurate rendition of his life. :-)

If one has the slightest interest in the history of art, or just a desire to look at beautiful works of art, I can recommend this series with most heartily. It's easy to get caught up in a subject when the speaker is as involved as William Kloss. Also, the photography, that is the display of the works of art, is very good.",1332028800,10,1666,4.534883720930233
