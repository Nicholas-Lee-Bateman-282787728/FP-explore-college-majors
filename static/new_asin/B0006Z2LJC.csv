2197316,5,B0006Z2LJC,"I really enjoyed this movie. I though the acting was great, and the story very touching, exciting, scary, and sad at the same time. The acting is great in my opinion. The story is set mostly in Chicago, and surrounds terrible storms, tornados, hurricanes, and severe thunder storms. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of these types of movies. The only negative thing I can say is they did not do a very good job of piecing together the movie - it was originally a made for TV movie, and that is apparent as the cut-offs to commercials are still there. Regardless, this is a great movie and about a topic that should be on all of our minds.",1130198400,13,664,4.32
2197317,5,B0006Z2LJC,"As a science teacher, a weather enthusiast, and a beginning stormchaser, I am proud to comment on the reality of the implications that were foreshadowed in this made for t.v mini-series.

I know there are pure weather scientists that will turn down this movie because the idea of 2 major weather systems combining to create a Category 6 storm over the city of Chicago is unrealistic.

However, the main point of this movie is that it's goal is to educate people about the potential for the type of problems that can occur if and when, if not already, our weather system starts to change.

The movie did a great job in depicting the role of such weather events on the government, power corporations, individual families, stormchasers, the media, and the meteorology dept.

What makes this movie different, and from my point of view more enjoyable than A Day After Tomorrow, is that it incorporates everyday life and is based on global warming.  It doesn't mention that there is an Ice Age that is just beginning as does a Day After Tomorrow.

This year alone we have seen that there are many more supercells that have formed across the plains and midwest with winds in excess of 74mph, which is hurricane force winds. While some of these storms may not have touched down as a tornado, the main emphasis is that weather is currently becoming more violent than it once has. As a society we really have to start thinking about our actions and what the implications are on our environment.

Is 2006 going to be any different than 2004 or 2005 in terms of hurricane intensity and strength? I have personally survived Hurricane Katrina this year being in Waveland, Mississippi and I can tell you this is a serious issue that is going to affect our country for the next several decades.

Hurricane Rita had at one point pressure under 900mb with sustained winds of 175-185 mph with gusts over 225mph. This is the equivalent to an F3 Tornado the size of Georgia with a tropical storm wrapped around it. Are we going to keep being naive and believing that these storms are not going to start coming inland?  What will happen when sea surface temperatures will rise even more and the storms don't weaken before they hit land? Will there be 60 ft storm surges?

Everyone should start paying attention to such phenomenon and hope that our government starts to take a serious look at how and where our populations are developing within the U.S",1128729600,11,2429,4.68075117370892
2197318,4,B0006Z2LJC,"Keeping in mind that this is a made for television mini-series, DAY OF DESTRUCTION is good entertainment.  While burdened with derivative characters and mediocre acting, the movie sustains interest as the above average effects (for tv of course) carry the weight of the film.  The concept of such a powerful storm hitting a major city like Chicago is well thought out and its ramifications devastating.  Dianne Wiest does well in her role as as congresswoman who is trying to get legislation passed regarding important environmental issues.  Nancy McKeon from tv's FACTS OF LIFE offers a sincere enthusiastic performance in her role as a tv anchorwoman, and Randy Quaid seems to be having fun playing Tornado Tommy, a stormchaser who is enthralled with the force of the storms.  Thomas Gibson is wooden in a leading role, but Ari Cohen as the whistleblower and Andrew Jackson as McKeon's boss redeem themselves noteably.  While its length seems a little stretched out, if you remember it was first shown in two nights, you may not mind..at least you don't have to put up with the commercials!!",1117843200,44,1093,4.978021978021978
2197319,5,B0006Z2LJC,"I figured when I first heard about this movie on TV, that it would just be a cheap rip-off of ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" but I was far from right. OK, so this movie's special effects aren't as good as ones from movies like ""Twister"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (the best one)but I still found myself entertained while watching this on TV.  Very good storyline, and the special effects were at least decent. Bottomline, a suprisingly entertaining movie.

SINCE SUPERCELLS ARE PRIMARILY THE CATALYSTS OF TORNADO ALLEY, AND THE MAIN PRODUCERS OF THE INTENSE VIOLENT TORNADOES THAT HIT THE GREAT PLAINS, MIDWEST AND SOUTH EVERY SPRING; I CAN SEE HOW THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS FILM!!!! THE POWER OUTAGE SEQUENCES COULD ONLY LEAD TO CATASTROPHE!!!! WITHOUT WARNINGS OR SIRENS; CHICAGO WAS A SITTING DUCK!!!! (SIMILAR TO FORT SMITH, ARKANSAS IN 1996 WHEN AN ENORMOUS F-4 TORNADO STRUCK SHORTLY AFTER 1AM, SPAWNED FROM A LONG LIVED TORNADIC SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORM THAT CROSSED THE OKLAHOMA BORDER INTO ARKANSAS!!!!

Nancy McKeon and Dianne Weist stood out in their roles (McKeon was just as great as she was in Lifetime's cop show ""The Division"") and the special effects were amazing! Besides one scene where a windmill falls on a truck that looks animated, they were completely realistic! I didn't realize until now that it was available on DVD and now that I do, I'm definitely going to purchase it. The beginning scene where twin tornados destroy Las Vegas says it all!",1110585600,3,566,4.5588235294117645
2197325,3,B0006Z2LJC,"Yes, this US-Canadian TV movie is a horrible piece of movie making, but it still is a decent film to watch and I do consider it much more entertaining (both as a disaster-drama and cheap comedy) than NBC's ""10.5""

This film is made by the same guys who brought you some other somewhat known TV disaster film from the 1990's like ""The Great Los Angeles Earthquake"" (which is actually quite good) and ""Nowhere to Land.""  In fact much of the special effects shots that were not cheap CG images or news stock footage came from these two films.

The special effects are fairly descent but continuity in the shots are horrible.  For instance, Chicago, for some odd reason, has PALM TREES! Furthermore, after a huge storm system that poured a deluge of rain over the city leaves completely dry streets where fires have started breaking out (which is all footage from ""TGLAE"")!

This film actually seems to be a subtle remake of ""The Great Los Angeles Earthquake"" since it actually some story lines from the original version of the older and much better TV movie.  This film is rather fast-paced and can be enjoyable both as a disaster-drama at times and a horribly cheap, worthy of ""MST3K"" TV movie, it just depends on where you are in the movie and what mood you're in.

That's it for now, I'll have to watch it again to remember just how bad the acting and the characters are, it's just that much of a forgetful movie.",1105488000,4,1413,4.561264822134388

2197391,4,B0006Z2LJC,"I just verified that this was a made for television product and not a theatrical release. Knowing nothing about it before viewing, save that it was a disaster movie, the film itself made its identity clear. Not that I am knocking such films. Many are fine, many are entertaining, but none work with the kind of budget that an expected Hollywood megahit can have behind it. They also have to spread themselves over a wide range of audience types rather than having the chance to build by word of critics and word of mouth so that a specialized audience can be attracted and stimulate others to come later in the picture cycle.
There is also the time factor; very few television productions can take the time that movie-makers can to rehearse, find just the right spot to photograph, polish the dialogue, spend a  day on a 3 minute segment, and other normal film practices. Thus we have in this film the stereotyped relationships which allow the audience to fill  in much of the story with simply a hint from the screen: the husband sleeping with another woman, the self-appointed crusaders for one issue or another, who are thwarted by all the guardians of Corporate Greed (public and private), when they try to pursue the Public Interest as they see it, the teen- daughter going astray problem, and all the rest.
Yes, this film has its full allocation of these human interest short-cuts, but, nonetheless, I found it entertaining,  on the whole, since I did exercise restraint in dealing with the aforementioned stereotypes.  I also took a number of occasions to take a break, walk around,  and, in the usual ways, avoid almost three hours of exposure.
It was good to see Brian Dennehy, then in his mid-sixties, and looking it, who was not allowed to dominate the human element in the film, but was still a  major acting force. One does wish he had more to do and more freedom to cut loose from his supporting role. Others in the cast did about what they were supposed to do with only the news reporter-crusader allowed to give a more than routine performance. The bit part of Washington administrator was also allowed to make an impact in the short time allotted to her.
Insofar as their resources allowed, they give us a good storm, and glance at the damage done. Certainly, they made me happy not to have been caught in a major storm on the lakefront of Chicago, near which I spent a fair amount of time.
All in all, a watchable natural disaster film (and, yes, there is a human factor in the form of a malevolent hacker). It is not in the "" Top Ten of the Year"", but it should provide some satisfaction to others like myself, who like our natural disasters  to be limited to the screen.",1366848000,,2690,4.58004158004158

2197397,4,B0006Z2LJC,"I love disaster movies, and Category 6: Day of Destruction serves up over three hours of death and destruction.  Personally, I would like to have seen more shots of the storms doing their thing - especially during the climactic event - but there is still a lot to like about this two-episode miniseries originally aired on CBS in 2004.  Some of the human interest stories are a little tedious, and the cataclysmic weather plot eventually jumps the shark, but it's still a fun film to watch.

The movie starts out great, with Las Vegas getting slammed by a couple of monster tornadoes.  Then things bog down a bit as we are introduced to the major players in this drama: a hard-nosed and somewhat abrasive reporter (Nancy McKeon) determined to break a big story about the vulnerability of the nation's power grid; the manager of a local power company and his family; the ruthless executives at the largest power supplier in the region; a weather plane pilot and his very pregnant wife; an over-the-top storm chaser (Randy Quaid); the nation's Secretary of Energy; as well as those running the show at the national weather office.  Different characters face a number of issues over the course of the movie, both personal and professional, but there is no point in going into detail about it here.

Here's the problem.  After weeks of record drought and freak killer storms popping up out of nowhere in the most unexpected of places (such as those tornados in Las Vegas), the whole weather system has run amuck.  The weather service can't even predict some major storms until they've already come down in full force.  All of that is just a prelude to what I coming, though.  You've got a major storm heading south from Canada which is expected to grow into a Level 5 (if not higher) hurricane as it moves over Lake Michigan.  It gets worse, as another huge system spawning multiple Level 5 tornados is moving up from the south.  Both systems are set to meet over Chicago, and no one can imagine the death and destruction that will result from this ultimate weather nightmare.  To make matters even worse, a major blackout hits Chicago and the surrounding area, making it all but impossible to warn the millions of people sitting in the path of the converging storms to evacuate.

The vulnerability of the national power grid gets a lot of emphasis here, with the large power suppliers and the men and women who run them coming off rather badly.  There's also some implicit criticism of a federal government unwilling to require the strengthening of the power infrastructure, despite increasingly dangerous outside threats to the whole system.  Strangely enough, however, the Secretary of Energy (Dianne Wiest) emerges as quite a hero whose warnings went unheeded and who - in a time of crisis -actually steps up to the plate to do the right thing.  (You'll be hard pressed to find a government official like that in the real world.)

Some of the special effects are less than spectacular and I could have done without some of the personal plot elements, but Category 6: Day of Disaster is still a pretty good film for the most part.  Thankfully, global warming only gets one quick mention, so this isn't an attempt to beat you over the head with that highly questionable idea.  In other words, you can just sit back and enjoy all of the destructive sights and sounds that come your way.",1346198400,,3383,4.7406143344709895

2197400,5,B0006Z2LJC,"Great movie! So many plots and so much time to put them in as well. I like disaster flicks that tear apart cities, especially the city of sin(Las Vegas)in the beginning. 20 or 30 miles away from Vegas at that time, an old couple is sitting on the steps of their ranch, and to their pure amazement, hundred-dollar bills are being planted on their lawn, courtesy of the high winds that carried them there.
""Wow, Marge, someone probably blew up Vegas!"" That got a big laugh out of me.

This movie goes on for a while about the vulnerability of power companies and what would happen if a computer hacker just happened to shut off the power to an entire city, of which does happen about 24 hours before the approach of the storm. And apparently, one of the main characters, a power company guy, is cheating on his wife with a hot blonde(nice stereotype!), which the wife finds out about. Then you have a news reporter who not only gives headaches to a lot of the people she's interviewing with her incessant nagging, but she also nags at her brother, an Air Force major, that maybe he needs to quit playing ""cowboy"" with his pilot job just because he's going to be a father. I didn't like the reporter much for that. Come on, lady. It's a steady job, and your brother probably gets paid more money as a field-grade ranking pilot than you do pointing microphones at people's faces. Having a steady job is something a new family needs.

Other than that, the movie escalates into action with it's disaster sequences, a punk kid trying to rob a bank out of pure anger just because his girlfriend dumps him, and then the girl gets shot in the shoulder when she's trying to encourage him to let the people go the next day. I liked the thrilling sequence of Randy Quaid playing ""Tornado Tommy"" as he gets sucked into a twister with his SUV. Here we go!!! The movie was brilliant and it also educates you on the comings and goings of power companies as they run our ""third-world grid."" Excellent!",1295395200,2,1983,4.475138121546961

Brian Denehey was good as well. It was interesting to see Diane Wiest play a character that wasn't in a comedy. I love Thomas Gibson in this movie. In the beginning, I wanted to smack his character, but he got better and better as the movie continued.

It's a long movie, but it keeps you interested through the entire movie. The special effect are pretty amazing. I'm not one for disaster movies, but there was more than just the storm story line, there were some great B and C storie lines in this movie. I have seen 10.5 and this is a better quality film then 10.5.

2197404,2,B0006Z2LJC,"This thing just runs way too long. I suspect that one could remove the myriad of unrelated subplots and get the central theme of the movie well within a 90 minute runtime. It has it's moments. Tornado Tommy is fun to watch, and I think if they'd centered the movie around his character it would have been a lot more enjoyable. The special effects range from good to really terrible.
In the end what kept me from being able to watch this thing all the way through was the ridiculous number of unnecessary subplots featuring interpersonal drama among a bunch of unlikable characters.
I want to like an epic length feature with tornadoes, but I really can't recommend it.",1271808000,,668,4.621848739495798

This movie has a lot of action in it and a lot of great actors from the good old days, so if your not afraid to watch lightning,striking,buildings being torn apart I highly recommend this dvd glad I purchase it.",1268265600,,541,4.201923076923077
2197406,4,B0006Z2LJC,"""Category 6 - Day of Destruction"", despite the usual shortcomings of 'Made-for-TV' movies (due to smaller budgets than feature films), is a better-than-average production, thanks to a strong cast and some impressive special effects. If you love the Windy City, however, be warned; Chicago is the epicenter of just about everything bad that can happen, short of an earthquake or alien invasion!

Of course, viewers need a taste of what is to come, so the film opens with a bang, as two twisters level Las Vegas! Now, as a resident of Vegas, I can understand why many visitors who leave with empty pockets might fantasize about such an event, but truthfully, the odds of a supercell forming inside of the mountains that encircle Sin City are even less than your odds at winning at the tables, here. Still, there's a very cool scene from inside a suite, as a twister rushes towards it, that is visually terrific.

While the story runs the usual gamut of subplots (Will the devoted husband admit to an affair with the hot consultant?...Will his teenaged daughter 'wise up' that nice boyfriends don't rob banks?...and several more, equally compelling), there are actually two major storylines; one involves the weather disaster, and is visually stunning, although no real resolution is made (I guess we're left to assume this is just another effect of global warming). This storyline features Brian Dennehey, who is terrific as a world-weary chief of the government's Weather Service, and a funny Randy Quaid, channeling his ""Independence Day"" characterization, as a somewhat unbalanced (but wise) stormchaser named 'Tornado Tommy'. The other storyline involves corruption in the power companies, and features Thomas Gibson, as a dedicated Chicago power company executive, Christopher Shyer, as the sleazy energy conglomerate president, Chandra West, as the sexy liason between the pair, and, in the film's best performance, Dianne Wiest as Washington's Energy Secretary, who offers an intelligent overview of actual issues we face. Linking the two storylines is Nancy McKeon, who is surprisingly good as a struggling TV reporter, who discovers where everything is heading.

While it takes a while to build up to the cataclysmic finale, when it does arrive, it doesn't disappoint. The stock footage hurricane scenes (with palm trees...in Chicago?), are kept to a minimum, and the FX work is quite impressive. The sequence alone is worth the price of the DVD!

So, don't expect the pyrotechnics of ""2012"", but for a pretty entertaining night of destruction, ""Category 6"" does deliver!",1263340800,,2578,5.204819277108434

2197409,3,B0006Z2LJC,"Category 6 - Day of Destruction (2004) was a three to four star disaster film.  Special effects were OK (by CBS Digital), but the story was just too long and went on and on to a well deserved ending. This film was another in a series of disaster movies which I rate at 3 on the Richter scale.",1244419200,,292,4.0344827586206895
2197410,3,B0006Z2LJC,"Try not to buy this stuff on an individual basis because it only promotes Hollywood's specious agendas. Personally, I've never seen ONE film from Hollywood that doesn't indoctrinate in some manner, e.g. global warming, global government, attacks on fathers and families, centralized police forces, abolition of 2nd amendment, etc. Establish a central repository in your neck of the woods and allow locals to rent this stuff for next to nothing, i.e. just enough rent to cover replacement costs. This method will serve to drive a stake through the heart of Hollywood. This particular film promotes the lie that man's actions are a significant part of global warming. Hollywood promotes films such as this one, because Hollywood supports global government. If the lie of man-created atmospheric warming succeeds by ramming carbon taxes down the throats of the world's governments, then the United Nations will finally have a stable source of revenue for creating standing armies, etc....a scary thought indeed in conjunction with a world court. Global warming is overwhelmingly due to solar activity and its interaction with the earth. Man's activities play an insignificant  role in that process. The current warming trend is temporary and once this trend disappears, man will once again look forward to global warming. With that said, this movie is funny in parts despite the improper fear-mongering of global warming. Quaid's part as Tornado Tommy is brilliant. Overall, the acting is solid.

When I first published this review in early 2009, the scandal of Climate-gate (intentionally doctored data on the climate) by ""scientists"" in the employment of the United Nations (UN) had not been exposed yet. Since then, we now know the scam of man-made global warming is being used to ram taxes on carbon emissions down the throats of people everywhere for the sake of creating a standing army at the UN. Just within the past week (~early July 2010), these ""scientists"" involved in the Climate-gate scam have been cleared by an international panel of ""experts"". LOL! Has the reader ever heard of the Warren Commission? When the heat is on criminal behavior, governments simply create an ""independent"" commission to investigate the matter, render a verdict misrepresenting the criminal behavior and ignoring the facts (like 9/11), and let the criminals free. Unfortunately, I've been proven right again.",1234742400,,2398,5.291338582677166
2197411,4,B0006Z2LJC,"Category 6: Day of Destruction is a 2004 TV movie about a series of 'super storms' that strike parts of the US (and Canada).

The movie stars a lot of Hollywood and Canadian stars: Brian Dennehy plays the head of a group of storm experts who (with the help of a young, female analyst), try to prevent the storms from hitting various US states; a storm preventer (Thomas Gibson), who is having an affair with a woman while his marriage and family are put on the backburner; a 'storm chaser' (Randy Quaid) who gives foreign tourists a tour of the storms;  the reporters' sister who is about to give birth while her fiancee is trying to make sure they're getting out of the storms alive; and a woman who is working for the DOJ (Dianne Weist), who is threatening a corrupt power company from blacking out American homes so that they can cut costs and save money.

Director Dick Lowry (""The Gambler series with Kenny Rogers"") does an excellent job, and the acting is good.

The CGI effects are great for a made for TV movie and it recommended family viewing for people who like disaster movies.

Category 6: Day of Destruction gets four stars and is worth the price for three hours of quality viewing.",1222560000,7,1196,4.518518518518518

Now despite what is seen in the Movie ""Twister"" that's NOT how REAL storm chaser act!!
First of all when in comes to professional Storm Chasers, SAFETY is ALWAYS first!!! He took WAT to many risks.  You NEVER let your guard down and you NEVER get that close unless you are sure your location is secure.

Anyways, that's what I wanted to mention.
No--I am not downing the movie or anything.  I really liked the movie....it was just that false Storm Chaser was incredibly insulting to those of us who are actually a part of the official Storm Chaser, and Spotter Networks.

That's all.
But it's still a great movie.  I will watch it again, despite the annoying chaser, the effects were neat.  I LOVED the opening scene of the tornadoes destroying Las Vegas--

2197417,4,B0006Z2LJC,"Yes, another natural disaster movie beginning with a series of intense storms in unexpected places throughout the country and culminating with two big ones colliding to create a super-storm over Chicago.  The acting was absolutely terrific and the film offers the expected line-up of small and large personal dramas, crises, close calls, heroics and rescues.

I do have to air my few gripes about its content.  It seems to drop all reference to the tornado storm while dealing with the hurricane's arrival.  And while most scenes are believably realistic, I had to roll my eyes that the ""good guys"" never faced enough of the storm, while the three dubbed ""villains"" were, of course, killed by it.  The water scenes showed seas not nearly rough enough for a category 5 hurricane, too many people ran around lost in the streets amidst the storm, and are there really that many palm trees in Chicago? <g>  My final gripe ... what began as a series of storms building to these two merging abruptly ends, leaving the movie's entire theme of the overall catastrophic effects of global warming dangling pathetically.  A politician's promises are all we're offered in the end.

Hey, pay no mind to my picking at the small stuff!  Category 6 is decent and engrossing entertainment within the natural disaster genre! :-)",1181606400,2,1310,4.918181818181818

The story line and acting were ok and i liked the fact that there was a build up to the actual disaster which allowed the charcters to become more real. The action was a bit contrived though and while i can see people being so silly, i hardly think that they would be so blase about it all.

Villains because they are opposing the two mentioned females in one way or the other.
