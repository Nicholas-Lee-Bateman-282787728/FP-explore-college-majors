6266690,5,B00IJUIY4C,"If you've never seen this movie, do yourself a favor and buy it now.

This is one of the funniest movies ever and so under-rated and under-known. It has some big names early in their careers, like Bradley Cooper, Molly Shannon, Paul Rudd, and Elizabeth Banks.

The creators are also responsible for the TV series ""The State"" and ""Stella"", and the movies ""Role Models"" and ""Wanderlust"".

A prequel is coming out on Netflix pretty soon and it looks to be just as good.",1436227200,,466,4.590361445783133
6266691,5,B00IJUIY4C,Definitely a great star filled laugh romp featuring many of today's stars!!!,1433721600,,76,5.416666666666667
6266692,3,B00IJUIY4C,"Spoiler alert.  With these teen-camp parodies, an argument could be made that they all poke fun at previous films of the genre. Certainly it's hard to take any seriously. The film made a couple hundred thousand dollars in theaters before going to video but is chock full of actors now on the ""A"" list (Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper, Elizabeth Banks), some TV stars (Amy Poehler, Christopher Meloni, David Hyde Pierce), some comedians (Janeanne Garofalo, Michael Ian Black) and others who seem to have just faded away (Marisa Ryan, Marguerite Moreau). There really is no plot.

It's the last day of summer camp in Maine. The camp director (Garofalo) falls for an astrophysicist (Pierce) who lives next door to the camp. They both aren't good at dating. Other couplings interchange with frequency including the only one whose consummation was actually on the screen (Cooper & Black). The movie is filled with the usual assortment of misfits and fine bodies. Yet something is missing. No bare boobs which is a staple for the genre. Even the bare butts are the dudes.

Admittedly, I did chuckle several times usually with gags that were not easily seen. For example, there is a scene when Prof. Neuman (Pierce) comes running out to his girlfriend (Garofalo) announcing he had won a scientific award, he's actually carrying what appears to be a large bowling trophy. As he continues to talk with Garofalo's character, he hands the trophy off to someone outside the frame. Damn funny. This is a lukewarm skewering of ""Meatballs"" and other similar films. Sometimes it hits, but often it misses.",1428537600,2,1583,4.943609022556391

6266695,5,B00IJUIY4C,"Hilarious movie, and funny to see all these actors before they were really big stars. You'll like it if you have a dry/offbeat/intelligent sense of humor.",1419897600,5,154,4.961538461538462
6266696,1,B00IJUIY4C,"This is by far one of the worst movies I've seen in my adult life. The cast was fantastic, which is why the Casting Director's credits appeared at the beginning of the movie, while everyone else (some recognizable, some not) were left to the guestimation of the audience through this horrible production.

We watched for two reasons -- one, it was about Maine (where we are from) and two, it starred David Hyde Pierce, who has the potential to play some wonderful roles, such as ""The Perfect Host."" Christopher Meloni played a major, over-the-top OZ-like-nutjob ... and didn't even get credit in the HBO summary preview of the flick.  Amy Poehler, Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter, Molly Shannon -- it was almost a typical ""SNL-cast"" movie type ... with some surprise appearances of others.

The movie had absolutely no redeeming value. It barely mentions Maine, and it's a Jewish day camp, on top of things. Why they perform music from ""Godspell"" at their talent show is beyond me.  Named ""Camp Timberwood,"" I can only imagine that it's named after Camp Kingswood, but the location is Waterville rather than ""Southern"" Maine.

We actually needed to calm down/relax after this movie, as we lasted till the end .... just waiting to see the cast list. That was our only goal. Siskel was fortunate enough to miss this production; Ebert gave it one star. If I could give it less, I would do so, happily.",1413936000,3,1403,4.7809917355371905

6266699,5,B00IJUIY4C,This movie is hilarious and I can't wait to listen to the Commentary track with it.  I usually only buy movies that have a commentary.  Came to be such a great price that I had to nab it up.  Very quick shipping and in perfect condition.,1450051200,,237,4.108695652173913

6266702,4,B00IJUIY4C,"Such a quirky little film, made by people who obviously had a fun time during the process. Straddles the line between parody and outright farce, and thus may never reach true cult classic status. Not that it needs to, but it's definitely not for everyone. More of a litmus test movie for those of us who experienced summer camp, for better or worse.",1443398400,,349,4.555555555555555

6266707,1,B00IJUIY4C,"Saw it on Netflix. It was garbage. The casting is the only positive. But even bad camp movies are better than this spoof. From joke to joke, each minute, it fell flat on it face. Even with its intention of ""mimicking"" bad camp movies, it just did not work. But for some reason it has a following of fans. Bradley Cooper making out with Michael Ian Black was disgusting. Christopher Meloni was annoying. Amy Poehler, dull as usual. Janeane Garofalo, Paul Rudd, David Hyde Pearce are meh, as well. So much talent wasted on this movie.",1437609600,,532,4.552083333333333

Let's do it with a lot of very talented actors and actresses (in their 30's and 40's) Let's have some great situations and some really fun over the top segments, Skylab is falling! the kids are great the counselors are great and you really have to keep in mind...satire!

8642686,5,B00IJUIY4C,"If you love bizarre, absurd, off the cuff humor, than check out Wet Hot American Summer.  This movie is an absolute laugh riot.  It is wacky, spontaneous, random, and absolutely hysterical.  On top of all of that, it actually captures some of the truths of going to summer camp (albeit in a very exaggerated way).  So glad this is finally on Blu Ray!  I can watch this movie again and again and again and again!",1468800000,2,411,4.426666666666667

8642689,5,B00IJUIY4C,"I started watching WHAS the TV series on Netflix and I was utterly confused but at the same time, super intrigued.  I looked it up to find out why all these 16 yr old kids were being played by 40 yr old adults and that's when I found this movie.  It's great and such a comedy.  You definitely have to have a different sense of comedy than ROM-COMs, think more along the lines of the comedy in an adult cartoon.  Overall pretty great though!  The extra content is really cool to watch also.",1461456000,,489,4.21505376344086
