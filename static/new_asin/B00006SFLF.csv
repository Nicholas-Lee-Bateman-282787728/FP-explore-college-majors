7973121,3,B00006SFLF,"In this film, the viewer sees the lives and struggles of three young couples:  one Asian, one Black, and one white.  It was great seeing couples of different racial backgrounds getting along.  And there is some interracial sexuality here, so there's no inherent antimiscegenation bias or anything.  It's filmed in video, rather than film.  The acting is bad, but not terrible.  This bordered on soft core pornography to me, so I'm surprised that it was available for renting at a certain ""family friendly"" rental chain.  It wasn't totally heteropatriarchal:  there was more female nudity than male, but there was some male nudity.  The Asian woman in this film was an awful actress.  The white guy in this film looked a lot like the white actor on the television show ""The Fast Lane.""  I loved seeing such a ruggedly masculine Asian-American man in film.  However, the Asian guy and the Black had terrible teeth!  The white couple argues over whether to do a female-dominated menage a trois.  Like in ""What's Cooking?"", homosexuality or bisexuality is relegated to whites only and I find that kinda disturbing and unrealistic.  All the couples live in houses that no young, middle-class couple could ever dream of owning.  Further, the film has these cheesy solo interviews a la MTV's ""Real World"" series that are kinda silly. Was this supposed to be a romantic drama?  A chick flick?  Some ""erotica""? I don't know.  Still, this is a mediocre film which some will enjoy and others will detest.",1037750400,2,1493,4.9
