8258780,3,B0015J591K,"OK - just remember that if your  buying this there is a good chance the person your getting it from didn't pay for it since it was for free on the cover of the December 2006 issue of Metal Hammer (UK). The release consists of 15 DVD tracks with simple and easy navigable menu screens.

The songs are somewhat varied - lots of the growling ""RRRAAAARRRGGGHHH  I'm heavier than everyone else"" vocal styling but some variety is supplied by mobs like techno power metallers Dragonforce, mainstream(ish) black metallers Cradle Of Filth and some female fronted bands like Leaves Eyes and To-Mera. Not to mention the Deathstars with their rather interesting vocalist and stage clobber.

All up while I've given this three stars it's probably not a good buy, if you like the growling that the heavy music scene of the 00's is so enamoured of then you might get more out of it. You'd be better off going to some site and just downloading the few video clips you want.",1224547200,2,957,4.6117647058823525
