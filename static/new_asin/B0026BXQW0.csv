8352477,5,B0026BXQW0,"Another must-have for Saiyuki fans. If you thought seasons 1 and 2 were great and full of action, then you won't want to miss this DVD collection. Next in the series.  More laughs, and more action. And the small parts after each episode are just hilarious. I recommend it. I give it 5 stars. So pick up your copy as soon as you can. You won't regret it.",1376006400,,353,4.1911764705882355
