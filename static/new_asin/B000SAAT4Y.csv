8204917,4,B000SAAT4Y,"Interesting starter's look at the practise of 'Witchcraft'.Where are the real 'Warlocks'? Stage magicians presented from the 'Magic Castle'.The art of hypnosis and love spells are explored and examined. The synergy between Africian 'Vodu' and Creole Cajun Christianity revealed and performed. It seems these various episodes were filmed for Geraldo Rivera's investigation show,during the early 1990s. The DvD is still good for beginner witches,yet it's rather light on wizardy topics. And nowhere,are the heavier and more practical issues such as occultism,stopping environmental ruin,healing the Earth,veganism,home gardening,or even bread baking discussed. It's worth seeing once,yet don't be fooled by the cover. It has nothing to do with the history of the 'Burning Times' or the real modern practise of witchcraft divination.",1302652800,3,830,5.925
