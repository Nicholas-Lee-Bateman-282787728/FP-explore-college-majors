5908445,2,B00EE6IBAW,"I have to agree with G. Elizabeth.  The two boys did very well, but the rest of the movie was pathetic especially when some of the adults entered the picture.  There is some vulgar language not needed at all.  Some scenes seemed to be added just to fill in time.  A complete waste of time.  So many other great movies out there.",1386374400,2,328,4.225806451612903

5908447,1,B00EE6IBAW,"I decided to get this movie based on the reviews I read, I'm not sure what movie others were watching but I had to turn it off it was just that bad! It kind of reminds me of the movie ""A Christmas Story"" which I hated that movie too. I thought (based on reviews) what I was getting was a feel good movie with a nice message. This movie was not that at all in fact the story line was pitiful, and the acting was even worse. If you liked the other movie I mentioned then this movie might work for you, but if you are like me and are looking for a feel good Christmas movie, with good acting and a believable story line then look somewhere else.",1385942400,3,642,3.9844961240310077
5908448,5,B00EE6IBAW,"What a great family movie for the holidays! I originally saw this as part of the Seattle Independent Film Festival last Spring. There's nothing to think about, gather your family and watch it now. You will definitely want to own it, as it's one of those movies you'll want to watch again and again. I went to the film festival to support the local actors but came out with a new appreciation of how talented our community really is. I loved the actors, the characters and the true meaning behind the storyline--we all need love, family and time to enjoy, no matter what you believe!",1384387200,16,582,4.552380952380952
5908449,4,B00EE6IBAW,"Really good Holiday movie with great scenes of the Leavenworth (Christmas Town) in Washington State.

The movie starts out a little slow, but really picks up as soon as the boys meet at the Airport.

From then on it is a fun ride with a great Christmas message for the whole family - regardless of your religious persuasion!!",1384214400,11,325,4.586206896551724

This movie is very entertaining, has a great story line to it and I know it will be one of the movies that we will watch every Christmas season.  Great for the entire family!",1425686400,,285,3.982456140350877

5908486,2,B00EE6IBAW,"The only reason for purchasing this movie was because we visit Leavenworth Washington (a.k.a. ""Christmastown"") yearly and wanted to see our favorite destination on the big screen. It appears that this movie was filmed on a budget, perhaps because they paid well known actors to play some of the parts. In any case, this movie is family friendly, squeaky clean, and c-h-e-e-s-y.  Leavenworth Washington is one of the most scenic and unique places to visit in the country. Knowing and recognizing the town made it more fun to watch, although they didn't seem to take real advantage of the awesome setting the town resides in, or care to accurately highlight the Christmas festivities that take place during the holiday season there. This may have added some much needed depth, as the story drags and feels awkward. If, like us, you are interested in seeing the city of Leavenworth featured on screen, a 9 minute short film produced in 2011 called ""An International Love Story"" is a must see. Check 'Switchmas' out from your local library, or rent it. Not really worthy of being put in your holiday collection of Home Alone's, Santa Clauses, or Elf movies.....",1420502400,,1157,4.903061224489796

5908513,5,B00EE6IBAW,"What a heartwarming Christmas story which will be added to my family's Holiday watching traditions. Switchmas is near and dear to us as it was filmed in our very own ""Christmas town"" (Leavenworth WA) and our friends, school's kids/bands, and our wonderful shops and beautiful scenery are featured and recognized. I remember the day they were filming downtown Leavenworth VERY early in the morning. Some of my students and their families skipped school to be a part of the fun. AND we hadn't had any new snow in a while and that day the parade was filmed we had an incredible show of the white stuff falling from the sky!!
But bottom line the story is a very endearing one especially during the Christmas season.",1391040000,2,711,4.696
5908514,5,B00EE6IBAW,"A fun comedy emphasizing the importance of family, extended family and family traditions.  And they are not perfect!  Even my husband enjoyed this movie and the grandkids have watched it numerous times.",1389052800,2,202,5.28125
5908515,2,B00EE6IBAW,"I watched this movie because I live not very far from  ""Christmas Town"" aka Leavenworth, WA where this was filmed. Was not a fan of a lot of the acting. Some actors are good, and some were just terrible (well their characters were written terribly). I went in going expecting it to be like a parent trap theme with christmas and also not to expect much from this movie. I understand the message at the end, just it was done quick and poorly. The bullies story line made me laugh because while Ira the good jewish boy gets his christmas, the head bully kid who switched to being good in the end still has to go back to his drunken and abusive father. Then Ira's father movie scenes could have been left it, it was painful to watch and to believe that this is how grown ups are (okay I get its a kids movie, however there were some scenes I found maybe inappropriate for a kid, not a prude, just saying). Wished it talked more about what christmas was about, and also what Hanukkah is about as well (I mean I got to learn a little like the gold coin, but I learn more from the Holiday Armadillo then I did with this movie (FRIENDS REFERENCE!)). And they could have had more money if they didn't make a cartoon cgi sequence, it was poor and no point to the story. This is getting a star because of Leavenworth. The other star I am giving it because I had fun with my gal making fun of the film, and also could be fun for a kid maybe. But I wouldn't recommend buying, just watch it on netflix, or redbox. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!",1388966400,,1518,4.216494845360825
5908516,5,B00EE6IBAW,"As a half Jew, I now fully understand that odd yearning I have to leave my chinese food and write the next ecstatic crap-tastical soundtrack for Malls between November 10th and December 25th. I used to live in such isolated confusion, an existential angst that I dreaded each year... but Now, now I can rejoice! Deck the halls! Let it Snow! I know, I know! All I needed to understand this was a well done, pandering little movie that could easily double over as a Jews for Jesus infomercial. Oh, us Jews love writing those christmas songs. And as a boy, all I wanted was to decorate a dead tree in my house for some fat man to give me gifts. This movie is so understanding, and shares so much of the Jewish experience of living in the US... it's so educational, inspirational, and best of all... punny.",1388793600,,802,4.425675675675675

Whoever wrote and made this movie is in the wrong business.  The director, the writers and anyone involved in making this totally stupid movie should go back to cleaning public toilets in Greyhound and Trailways bus stations and in all the local public toilets in the city parks!",1387756800,2,423,4.7534246575342465

5908520,5,B00EE6IBAW,"Switchmas was an exceptional movie for a number of reasons:
It was a caring humorous depiction of acceptance of all faiths and practices
I could show it to my granddaughters; The acting and music were endearing; and It set a wonderful tone for the holidays.

I especially liked the character of Jack the Jerk. He came across as the quintessential bully, but, as Ira came to discover, theres a lot below the surface. The scene with Jack and his father brought in all the teenage angst, and trying to disguise his love for his dog in the face of his fathers bullying. Even outside the Christmas context, having children watch this sends the message that we learn from how we are treated, but with support and friendship, we can overcome those bad examples.  Jacks conversion to the savior of the Christmas pageant showed all he needed were friends and someone to believe in him.",1386460800,3,876,4.681818181818182

8604594,4,B00EE6IBAW,"Here is a cute little film I watched last night.  the film is called ""Switchmas"" .  It is a throwback to old Disney Movies of the 1960's and 1970's.  There is a few things in this film that makes be cringe.  What I like most about this film was how they showed ""Christmas"" through the eyes of a child.  This film is very family safe.  Sullen teens won't like this.  I think if you are a parent to a young child it will be a wonderful viewing experience.

""Switchmas"" is an American musical comedy film directed by Sue Corcoran. It tells the story of a Christmas obsessed Jewish boy on his way to sunny Florida who figures out how to get the Christmas of his dreams by trading airline tickets and places with another boy on his way to snowy Christmas-Town, WA.
