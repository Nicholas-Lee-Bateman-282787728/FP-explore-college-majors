418325,2,6301996100,"Revenge western starring Raquel Welch as the title character, victim of a vicious assault by outlaws led by Ernest Borgnine. All credibilty goes out the window five minutes into the movie when it becomes clear the bad guys are comic relief villains. The ""rape"" sequence, meant to set up the story plays like a rejected scene from an old sitcom, thus the viewer is not given the opportunity to have any emotional involement with Hannie.
For those of you who are still interested, Robert Culp mentors Welch so she can get revenge; and Christopher Lee shows up in yet another movie which wastes his talents. Pretty routine stuff, but at least its better than Welch's MYRA BRECKINRIDGE. (Is it possible for movies to get any WORSE than that?) Welch should have just shot the varmits at the start and mosied off into the sunset. Doesn't evoke fond memories of THE WILD BUNCH or Leone's DOLLARS trilogy.",1043625600,4,897,4.756410256410256
418326,3,6301996100,"The ""rape revenge"" story has been told many times in the past, but I doubt few films have ever portrayed it with comedic elements.
The villainous trio of Ernest Borgnine, Jack Elam, and Strother Martin can never seem to rob banks right. After another failed attempt, they happen upon Raquel Welch after they murder her husband in cold blood. After raping her, they leave her for dead, burning down her home. She escapes wearing just a blanket, and meets up with bounty hunter Robert Culp. He agrees to show her how to shoot, so she can exact her revenge. Her gunfighting technique is tested when she helps Culp fight off bandits while they are visiting Christopher Lee, a gunsmith who fashions Caulder a custom revolver. Eventually, Culp and Welch meet up with the three villains, and a lot of people die.
To highlight the good first, Robert Culp is such a natural actor, it is a shame he has had to resort to trash like the ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" series as of late. His Thomas Price character is sympathetic and tough, without being another superhero cowboy who never gets hurt or never has a feeling. Christopher Lee is a revelation as the gunsmith Bailey. Taken out of his usual horror film, he shows he can really act without having to pop fangs in his mouth or wrap himself in toilet paper and limp after turn of the century archaeologists. His role is brief, but good. Burt Kennedy, a veteran Western director, knows his stuff. The gunfight at Lee's home is as well shot as any action sequence today, without relying on special effects or CGI. The obligatory romance between Welch and Culp is also handled very well, as they tentatively fall for each other.
The three brother rapists, played by the usually reliable Martin, Elam, and Borgnine, are written like they just stepped out of a Marx Brothers or Three Stooges movie. They spend most of their scenes either arguing like five year olds, or blowing innocent people away. As a viewer, you already hate them enough for their crimes without the screenwriter having to resort to weak ""funny"" scenes to show how awful they are. I was not sure if this was a drama, or a weak Western comedy along the lines of ""Dirty Dingus Magee,"" especially when the soundtrack sometimes does the ""funny music,"" accentuating the ""funny"" rapists' actions.
Poor Raquel Welch. She is gorgeous, but the director and writer did not have enough confidence in her to fully write a character for her. In her first few scenes, she does not have any dialogue! Most of her scenes involve a peek-a-boo game of showing various parts of her body without resorting to full nudity. Fine for a comedy, but I did not think we should be ogling a recent rape victim and widow.
The introduction of a mysterious man in black (no, not Johnny Cash) to help Caulder was probably supposed to bathe the film in an air of mysticism, but the stunt feels weak and half thought out. His presence is never explained, as if the writer wanted the viewer to draw their own conclusions. As Welch begins gunning for her prey, she keeps having flashbacks to her rape and hearing Culp's advice in her ears during the gunfights. The screenwriter hits us over the head with this over and over again, but decides we are smart enough to analyze a character who shows up for no other reason than to get Welch out of a jam. Poor judgement on the writer's part.
Due to the aforementioned positives, I do slightly recommend ""Hannie Caulder,"" but do not watch this for a positive Western female role model. This is definitely a chauvinistic idea of a vengeful, beautiful female gunfighter.
This is rated (R) for some physical violence, strong gun violence, strong sexual violence, gore, profanity, very brief female nudity, and sexual references.",1022112000,18,3744,4.708841463414634
418327,4,6301996100,"This western is centered on three outlaws, three brothers who skim the frontier, as much as they can, and they can very little. They kill for pleasure and also to compensate their inability at robbing a bank properly or attacking a stage coach successfully. They are flunkies in the field. They run into a stagecoach station and they kill the station master, rape his wife and burn the station to the earth. Then the wife who wants vengeance runs into a bounty hunter. She will learn the trade and go through with her vengeance. The details create the suspense of the film and give it a real deep emotional value. The film also reveals how these outlaws could survive easily in some western cities because the local sheriff had an agreement with them : no trouble and he would disregard the WANTED notices, till something happens. Raquel Welch embodies her part with conviction.

418328,3,6301996100,"This is NOT simply a movie about a woman who gets raped and turns bitter or who, in the words of Thomas Luther Price, Robert Culp's character, ""wants to be a man."" This is a movie about a woman who is brutally raped all night by the same three men who murdered her husband and who later burn down her home. This seems to be a point that neither Tom Price nor previous reviewers seem to have picked up on though it should be a rather obvious one. Mrs. Caulder does not want to be wooed by Mr. Price or anyone else. She has lost everything in the space of one night and she has absolutely no one who understands or even seems to care or to whom she can turn to talk to about it.
Placed in juxtaposition to this very serious theme is another movie altogether... a movie that does not belong in the same one with Hannie Caulder's rape, the horrifying loss of her husband, and her search for some kind of resolution. It doesn't belong there because it is too much it's own comedy. This is the movie that Ernest Borgnine, Strother Martin, and Jack Elam are in.  These three are in a comedy that, in the opinion of this reviewer, far surpasses anything that The Three Stooges ever did in humor. They are hysterically funny, and this is the problem. While some comic relief might be helpful in a movie that is so serious and horrifying, it should not be allowed to overwhelm the plot. Unfortunately it does and spoils much of the serious tone of the whole film.",974160000,6,1453,4.302919708029197
418329,4,6301996100,"This is one of those sadly forgotten, but should have been remembered  Westerns.

418330,2,6301996100,"To put it nicely, Hannie Caulder is an homage masquerading as a western. It offers nothing new and a lot old. Below its thin veneer of a plot(Raquel  Welch's quest for revenge against the men who brutally raped her)you'll  easily see several rip-offs of prior westerns. The Mexican soliders chasing  the outlaws is obviously from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and the  three-against-twenty gunfight with Hannie, Thomas, and Bailey is reminicent  of that in Magnificent Seven.  Throw in the mysterious, man-in-black  (a.k.a., The Man With No Name from the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns)and  you have a hollow story that relies on the usual shoot'em-up plot devices.  The only difference--and it's a noticable one in Raquel Welch--is that a  woman wears the ten-gallon hat and six-shooter. Too bad she couldn't inject  a fresh, feminine perspective on violence instead of offering the same old  macho mimicry.",965174400,,915,5.23448275862069

this movie is funny at times and seeing Raquel Welch in this kind of character instead of the sex symbol  she was back then

Robert Culp is the bounty hunter that finds her and eventually teachers her to use weapons in a gun fight. Raquel is beautiful in this 1972 film made in England and leans toward the spaghetti westerns of that time.

418556,4,6301996100,"Revenge movies have been a staple for decades now. The story set up is nearly identical in all: someone is wronged and they seek revenge on the person who did wrong against them. While that story can be set up in a single sentence it is the meat of the story wrapped around it that makes either a good film or a bad one. Add to that the performances, direction and technical aspects of a movie and you have more that makes it good or bad. HANNIE CAULDER is a better film than anticipated.

Raquel Welch burst upon the movie scene as a sexy bombshell, a woman known for her looks only. If she could act that was just a plus to most studios. Her back to back hits with 1,000,000 YEARS B.C. and FANTASTIC VOYAGE secured her more mainstream roles than shed had up to that point. While her looks helped her move her career forward they also limited what studios were willing to put her in. But her acting abilities helped her get better roles and more leads such as this one.

The film opens in the old west with Welch as the title character, forced to watch her husband killed by a group of men and raped by all three. The Clemons brothers, Emmett (Ernest Borgnine), Frank (Jack Elam) and Rufus (Strother Martin) burn down her house and head out, leaving her to die but Hannie is tougher than they realized. Setting out to find help she is rescued by a lone rider.

Fortunately for her the man is Thomas Luther Price (Robert Culp), a bounty hunter who knows how to handle a gun. At first Price is unsympathetic to Hannies decision to seek revenge, telling her it will solve nothing. He eventually is persuaded to teach her how to shoot and aids her in her quest for vengeance. As the two pursue the Clemons brothers they begin to feel an attraction to one another, something that may not end well once they catch up to their prey.

The movie offers a nice combination of western and revenge picture with a touch of humor tossed in. Odd that humor would play a part in a movie with the themes of rape and revenge but its there. The humor is found in the characters of the Clemons brothers, a complete bungling trio who end up with more failed plans than you can count. Their constant bickering and failures don't make them sympathetic characters though as Hannie relives the rape over and over in her mind. While this is a disgusting act to deal with in any film here it is shown to be brutal and yet not so revealing as to offend the more sensitive. Director Burt Kennedy takes the high road in not giving us more details than we need.

HANNIE CAULDER doesnt add much new to either the western or rape/revenge genres but it does tell the tale in a well-crafted manner. The script, the photography, the direction, the acting all combine to present us with a movie that is interesting and builds up a sense of anticipation waiting for the final confrontation that is bound to happen. Best of all the movie shows that Welch could actually act. Some may fault her for looking gorgeous in this film but I would say don't fault her, fault a studio system that was bent on making sure that was the focus of the film. Even the original poster shots emphasized that. But Welch does a great job here as does Culp, an often overlooked actor who deserved more credit.

This new blu-ray release comes from Olive Films and is part of their Signature Series. Unlike most Olive releases there are extras included here that are of some interests. They include an audio commentary by western expert and director Alex Cox (WALKER, REPO MAN), Exploitation or Redemption an examination of rape/revenge movies by film scholar Ben Sher, A Very British Horror Studio which is an interview with Sir Christopher Frayling on the history of Tigon Studios and an essay by film critic Kim Morgan.

Well-made with a new high definition digital restoration this is a must have for western fans as well as Welch fans. The movie looks great and aside from the distasteful notion of rape is an entertaining film as well. Olive deserves kudos for the pains they took with this movie. Its worth adding to your collection.",1502323200,,4080,4.490566037735849

418797,3,6301996100,"This is a guilty pleasure Western. Most of the pleasure admittedly comes from seeing Raquel Welch try to convincingly portray a gunslinger. The guilt is from what led her character (Hannie Caulder) to it: A brutal gang rape at the hands of a fugitive outlaw clan (consisting of Ernest Borgnine, Jack Elam, and Strother Martin) that also burns down her ranch. Since Hannie is presumably a run-of-the-mill frontier housewife, the first half of the movie serves to toughen her into a killer. Enter Robert Culp as Thomas Luther Price: A feared, but world weary, bounty hunter who reluctantly teaches her to shoot. The two forge a working relationship that inevitably begins to grow into a romantic one, thus complicating Hannie's quest for revenge. The second half of the movie shows Hannie finally putting Price's training to use.

I was never sure what the producers were thinking when marketing this Western. One publicity still has Welch posing in quite seductive fashion with her attackers! Another realizes the gravity of the plot, and instead has Welch and The Clemmons separated, with her aiming her custom self-cocking revolver for a kill. But, the main problem lies in drawing The Clemmons as laughable buffoons, rather than keeping them consistently despicable. In a tribute to BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, Jack Elam's ""Frank"" comically blows up a safe. Strother Martin's ""Rufus"" has a somewhat effeminate, put upon feel. Ernest Borgnine's eldest brother ""Emmett"" is the closest to being totally ruthless, as he coldly takes out two of the men in Hannie's life. But in most of his interactions, he still comes across as the domineering big brother who scolds his merely ornery siblings.

As for Raquel Welch as a fearsome female gunfighter? The script addresses Hannie's need for a gun that is lighter than the normal ""six-shooter""--a nice nod towards realism, rather than continuing with the trope of one gun fits all. Hannie getting a new gun does allow for a nice cameo by Christopher Lee (as an expatriate ""Rebel"" gunsmith in Mexico).

Hannie does believably struggle into becoming a competent shot--not always hitting her target and getting hit herself, as a result--and retains her vengeful streak, despite Price's warnings against it. So while Welch conveys the malice well enough, her flawless beauty--and the script's exploitation of it at every turn--is Hannie's biggest character flaw. For example, her ever-present, skimpy poncho seems to detract from her seriousness, but probably helped ticket sales (as more publicity stills of her wearing it plaster not just VHS and DVD's, but even music CD covers)!

Despite beautiful Spanish filming (that doubles for the Texas/Mexico Gulf Coast) and a triumphant Ken Thorne score and poignant ending credits ballad, HANNIE CAULDER is watchable, but just too jarring in tone and characterization to consider as one of the ""Best Westerns.",1456099200,,2903,5.183368869936034

Any way, so I did some research about that odd gun she used. Its real, not some weird move prop.  You all who don't know much about guns, the old revolvers were ""single action.""  To shot the the gun, you have to pull back the (cock) hammer, then pull the trigger, to shot it.  ""Double actions"" existed, I learned recently, but cost much more, so most people had what was affordable.  Apparently, the in between, was her gun.  The lower trigger cocked the hammer, the upper trigger, shot the gun - as I understand it.  I'm no expert on old guns, specially revolvers.",1435795200,,770,4.248275862068965

418926,4,6301996100,"This review is for the OLIVE FILMS DVD release-REGION ONE. A beautiful print transfer 2.35:1 ratio (Panavision). Good clear colours tho I did find the sound levels a bit frustrating-Dialogue scenes perfect, then music (Ken Thorne,shades of Elmer B) crashes in requiring me anyway to turn the volume down, otherwise no complaints. No extras or Subtitles. The film itself? Well, I shouldn't like it at all - Graphic rape scenes, random bloody killings and violence, topped off by a ludicrous plot - But I do like it! Probably because Miss Welch looks fantastic. She really doesn't need to act, but she always gives of her best, and this is up there with her best work (Kansas City Bomber/Three Musketeers/Fathom all my own choices you understand). Dressed in a really impossible outfit and always looking gorgeous she is obviously the ""star"". Her Co-stars work hard to steal the film - Borgnine (terrific) Elam (just Elam) and a magnificent OTT performence from Strother Martin, all playing an almost comedic trio of rapists and outlaws (Why did they choose to rob a bank, in itself incongruous in a one horse run down Mexican town, which is right next door to a  Federales post with a dozen slumbering (drunk) soldiers sprawled outside??). Culp is a laid back world weary hero (does he sleep with her?), and Lee has a small but good part a gunsmith. Now, can anyone reading this, if you haven't given up ages ago, help me here. What is Stephen Boyd doing in a tiny unbilled part and what is his character meant to be? Also why did Di Dors take the smallest least important role of her career - talk about a cough and a spit part! Any info welcome. I realize this review is now all over the place...Sorry!

A woman who learned how to survive and seek a revenge at a time when women were expected to stay home, stay quiet and for the most part subservient. Maybe today's woman could not relate to her peril and her plight because we are so much more liberal. But as a woman from the late 1800s, she was strong, determined, dedicated to  her cause and a woman to be admired. I am a writer, myself, and can only imagine where her life's path took her when this particular story of Hannie Caulder ended.

419008,3,6301996100,"This British-American response to the spaghetti western craze holds up surprisingly well, and proves to be somewhat better than its reputation. Director Burt Kennedy (who ultimately disowned the movie, and gave screenplay credit to his dog, Z.X. Jones) gets a great performance out of Robert Culp as a cynical bounty hunter, and a respectable one out of Raquel Welch, as a woman looking to exact revenge on the three lowlifes who raped her and killed her husband. Those lowlifes are played by Ernest Borgnine, Strother Martin and Jack Elam, and therein lies the problem. Director Kennedy, who could never resist a thick slice of ham, allows the trio to chew every piece of scenery in sight, making for an uneven tone that at times threatens to tip the whole picture into surrealism. Still, the final they-get-what's-coming-to-them sequences are satisfying to watch, and the Mexican-shot picture has a terrific look throughout. Best of all is a mid-story idyll at a gulf hideaway, where Culp painstakingly teaches Welch the art of gunslinging. There's an additional pleasure in Christopher Lee's brief role as a master gunsmith.",1408060800,10,1127,5.163934426229508

For those who only know Raquel Welch in movies where she (almost) wears fur bikinis or wetsuits, it may be a surprise to find a nice little movie where she shows she can indeed act. She plays a woman whose husband is murdered by three nasty brothers who then rape her. The brothers are played by Ernest Bognine, Jack Elam and Strother Martin as three very violent but comically inept robbers. She runs into a bounty hunter (Robert Culp in one of his best roles) and convinces him to teach her to shoot so she can hunt and kill the brothers. Christopher Lee has a nice turn as a sympathetic gunsmith. By turns violent, comic and romantic it is not to everyone's taste, as the violence is similar to Peckinpaw's, but while bizarre and mystical it is worth a look.

419169,3,6301996100,"I love the Western movie genre, and the old ""spaghetti"" westerns are ones that I treasure. Hannie Caulder, although not a ""spaghetti"" western, has the same sort of flavor. As a movie, to me, it really fell short of the mark.

The movie is filled with acting talent that appeals to me: Robert Culp, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Elam. With these guys in a film, one would think it's a sure fire winner. However, both the Ernest Borgnine and Jack Elam characters are reduced to clowns, and Robert Culp's character doesn't seem to reach his full potential. What this film does provide is multiple opportunities to view Welch's cleavage (at the beginning of the film), her dental work (as she is ""screaming""), her legs and butt - and the image of her naked under the blanket that she ultimately wears while scramblng around in the desert until she finds Culp. Oh, and her wind-tossled hair blowing seductively around her face. And a shot of her bum in tight, wet pants, that was totally gratuitous. HO-HUM...

I think the idea was to show Ms. Welch as some sort of strong, female character. It just didn't work for me. It was the same as with 10,000 BC. Just as in that movie it was Raquel Welch in a furry bikini, in this movie it was Raquel Welch, topless under a blanket (she never does get a shirt/blouse), running around in the desert. She never looks as though she is IN the 1880's old west. She looks very much as though she is in an early '70s movie.

I suppose this movie will very much appeal to males - what Raquel Welch movie doesn't? But those of us who are looking for substance with our movies will be disappointed with this so-so, mediocre attempt.",1288569600,4,1652,4.5

419210,3,6301996100,"I'd never seen this movie and barely even remembered the title, so as I saw some great reviews I was interested to see what I'd missed. And it wasn't much.

This isn't a bad film (though there is some bad stuff in it) but it just doesn't bring anything new to the genre. It's a revenge flick. Jack Elam, Struther Martin and Ernest Borgnine play outlaw brothers who are inept bank robbers. While being chased by Federales after a bungled bank job they happen upon a ranch where they figure to steal fresh horses. They end up killing the owner and raping his wife, played by Raquel Welch. She comes to, buries her husband and swears revenge.

She meets up with Robert Culp, a bounty hunter, and wants him to teach her the way of the gun. He does, reluctantly, and tries to let her know that it's a bad path she's traveling down.

All of this is OK but it's so middle of the road. We've seen it before many times and seen it better. It's directed OK, it's acted OK (accept for Ernest Borgine who is so terrible you wonder how he ever won an Oscar), it's shot OK, the music is OK. It's just OK.

The 3 Stooges routine between the brothers gets tired fast and, as best I could tell, there is absolutely no reason for the mysterious stranger. The kill scenes aren't particularly clever or exciting, and not that much really happens. The way I see it the only reason for making this film was to put a woman in the revenge seat in general and have her played by Raquel Welch in particular, and she just doesn't have the chops to pull it off.

This is an oddity at best. If you're into that sort of thing then have at it. If not......skip it.",1282348800,6,1633,4.254838709677419
419211,5,6301996100,"Hannie Caulder is a very frustrating film for an Italian western addict.  When it came out Italian westerns were winding down and Italy was trying to find a way to revive them.  Hollywood being slow and stupid decided it was time to make copies of Italian westerns which were copies of U.S. westerns.  We got Hang'em High, A Man Call Sledge, and this one.  Hannie Caulder is best of the American Italian clones.  At the time,  audiences and critics hated it.  Welch was just a body, a beautiful one, and not an actress.  To Italian western fans, this movie didn't have enough blood or guts, no nudity, and was a bust as far as they were concerned.  I found it interesting at the time because of the writing and pacing.  Robert Culp and Christopher Lee were memorable to me.  I have watched this movie several times on tv and I have grown to really like this movie for what it wasn't it, an Italian western.  All you have to do is look at the cast and it is full of talented character actors and each one is given screen time to make their character rich and full.  I found the movie to be thought full in its scenes with Welch and Culp.  The time in Mexico learning to to shoot, is interesting in the methods to shoot.  The details show here with the rock and the string are handle quickly but you remember them.  The quiet scenes at night when Culp talks to Welch about about quiting her idea of revenge are tender and passoinated.  Lee's building of Hannie's pistol is a delight to any gun nut and is spot on.  It is here that one of the stranges scenes takes place, the Preacher. This gunfighter drifts in and has Lee fix his gun.  Culp warns Hannie to stay away from him. The Preacher glances at Hannie and Culp and rides off.  The actor who plays tis part is not listed in credits and for the life of me I can't remember his name, Stephen Boyd?, but I know he made several popular movies in the 70's.  I have not mentioned the demented three stooges Elam, Borgnine, Martin.  These veteran actors are sick, funny, and dangerous.  THe gunfights are a thing of beauty because they are realistic in the action and sans gore.  The ending is the predictable shootout and Hannie wins.  BUT during the shootout the Preacher shows up, but doesn't help Hannie in her fight. When everything is over and Hannie has killed the men who raped her and killed the man she loved, Culp, the Peacher offers his had to her and she rides off with him.  I can't explain it but this ending sort of fits.  I don't know why but I was statisfied with it.  Hannie Caulder is a solid western that deserved more that it got the first time around.

The key to the success of this movie goes to its director Burt Kenndy. During the 50's, 60's and 70's he truned out some of the best under appreciated movies, i.e. The Good Guys and The Bad Guys.",1282262400,6,2818,4.324427480916031

As Thomas Luther Price, his courage, integrity and prowess with a gun are unmatched...as is his compassion. Being a shooter and collector of ""Old West"" firearms, I found that as a teacher, Robert Culp was unbeatable. He showed Hannie the proper form, and approach to shooting a six gun, with a mixture of toughness, understanding, and patience. His advice, at all levels, was both wise and true. Such was Thomas Luther Price's ""presence"", that something about the movie seemed to die with his absence.

She proved this with 'FATHOM', one of the best female secret agent movies ever made and her trio of westerns ,'BANDOLERO' in which she played a grieving widow with teeth, '100 RIFLES' playing Burt Reynolds girlfriend of the Revolution and could handle a gun and Jim Brown as well as her bandit team, and 'HANNIE CAULDER' the best role of her career and one of the most underrated films in the Western genre.  Written and Directed by Burt Kennedy , this was a British, Spanish,co-production which is in the company of Edward Dmytryk's 'SHALAKO' with Sean Connery and Don Medford's 'THE HUNTING PARTY' with Oliver Reed and Gene Hackman and could almost pass as a Spaghetti Western but not quite.  Not only does it give Raquel a pivotol role as the heroine obsessed with revenge but it has a stunning cast.  Robert Culp shines as Thomas Price , a bounty hunter who takes Raquel under his wing and teaches her the way of the gun, Sir Christopher Lee licking his acting chops in the great role of Bailey, a lethal gunsmith who creates the perfect weapon for Raquel's vengeance and the targets of her revenge, three of the greatest character actors : Ernest Borgnine, Strother Martin, and at his leering best, Jack Elam.  Add Stephen Boyd in a special cameo and you have an incredible mix.  A rousing music score by Ken Thorne and beautifully photographed by Edward Scaife , 'HANNIE CAULDER' is a masterpiece and along with 'FATHOM', demonstrates the underrated acting ability of Raquel Welch who deservedly had the mantle as the most beautiful woman ever to grace the screen. Kudos to Olive Films for finally releasing this film for fans and future generations in need of great entertainment, the quality is outstanding.

This movie is a strange bird. I find it a very enjoyable ""revenge"" Western. But there IS something jarring about the slapstick way the gang of rapists (Elam, Martin and Borgnine) are portrayed. There is also something stupid about the way the ""mysterious stranger"" is introduced into the plot towards the end of the movie - I have often wondered if some part of the story line was just left out through bad editing, or if the director was just manifesting contempt for the audience. Maybe this release, if it includes commentary, will clear up the matter.

419256,5,6301996100,"TITLE: HANNIE CAULDER opened in theaters on July 1 1971 and the movie took 85 minutes to watch. Hannie Caulder is a 1971 Western movie starring Raquel Welch Ernest Borgnine, and Robert Culp.

SUMMARY: The movie opens with Clemens Brothers riding into a Mexican Town and riding up to the bank. Across the dirt road is the Mexican Freda's sleeping and taking a break. As the Clemens Brothers are trying to rob, the bank one of the tellers pulls a handle that rings a bell. All hell breaks loose, a gunfight starts, and the Clemens brothers head out of town with the Mexican Army after them. The Clemens Brothers come across Hannie Caulder her husband and their farm. Hannie Husband confronts the Clemens Brothers and he is shot and kill. One of the Clemens goes into the house to fine some food when he comes across Hannie himself. The Clemens Brothers each take their turn with Hannie raping her repeatedly. Then after they have their fun, they torch the place and leave Hannie for dead. Hannie makes it out only to fine her husband dead down by the stable that use to hold their horses. Hannie buries her husband and with only a blanket starts walking. Hannie comes to and old Mexican Farm with a well when a Bounty Hunter confronts her name Thomas Price. Hannie knocks Price out with the barrel of his rifle, starts to leave only to change her mind, and stays with him. Hannie takes Prices revolver and starts practicing to shoot. Hannie ask Price if he would teach her how to use a gun and he says no and leaves. However, Hannie follows him and while she is sleeping, she starts having nightmares about what those three animals did to her. Hannie wakes up in tears and Price asks her how many where there and she tells him 3. What about your husband and Hannie tell him his dead. Therefore, after hearing her story Price agrees to help her and her to see Christopher Lee who is a blacksmith and make Hannie a special gun.

QUESTIONS: Why did the Clemens brothers attack Hannie Caulder? Why did they leave her for dead? How far did Hannie walk before she came across the farm? Who showed up at lee place? What did the person want? Who else showed up at Lee place? What did they want? Where did Price and Hannie go after they were finish at Lee place?

MY THOUGHTS: I thought this movie was fantastic. I thought that the three actors who played the role of the Clemens Brothers did a very good job. Robert Culp also did a good job playing the role of the gunfighter. However, this movie was about one person and one person only. Raquel Welch! Her role as Hannie Caulder was excellent. When she came out of the fire, all she had on was a blanket. Then they turned around and designed the blanket into a Mexican pullover, which made her more beautiful. Raquel Welch displayed her beauty and her talents with any problems what so ever. Based on Raquel Beauty and Talent alone I give this movie the highest amount of weasel stars I can give and that are 5.",1169942400,,2952,4.452865064695009
419257,3,6301996100,"Hannie Caulder is a Western that isn't horrible, but could have been much more than what it is.

Raquel Welch plays a woman whose husband is killed, and the killer rape her and burn down her house. The killers are played by veteran character actors (and perennial Western movie actors)Ernest Borgnine, Strother Martin, and Jack Elam.

Tracking the three men, she crosses paths with a sage bounty hunter, played by Robert Culp, who teaches her how to shoot and the ins and outs of gunfighting. Together, they take off in pursuit of the three men.

This movie had a lot of potential, but wastes it in several ways. The script can't find a balance between her being too hard or two soft, so she seems both, negating the believability of the premise. The three men, as directed by veteran Western director Burt Kennedy, also tries to have it both ways with them being savage and cartoonishly humorous. Culp is fine in his role, but can only do so much when the focus is supposed to be on Welch's character.

This is a film that could be remade and redone better.",1151366400,2,1058,4.552631578947368
419258,3,6301996100,"I caught this on the tube, having not seen it in over 30 years. I was expecting something very campy, in keeping with Raquel Welch's overall film oeuvre and was rather pleasantly surprised. Despite flaws, this is an above average western with the unusual addition of a strong female protagonist.
Hannie Caulder is raped and left for dead by a gang of three outlaws (Strother Martin, Jack Elam and Ernest Borgnine...reprising roles that each of them played over the years many times). She hooks up with a bounty hunter (Robert Culp) who teaches her how to shoot so she can get revenge on the rapists.
Certainly there are some aspects of this film that are severely dated: Raquel Welch hangs around in a poncho for the first half of the film...a kinda mini-dress with apparently nothing underneath, so you find yourself looking salaciously to see some flesh. This is a Playboy magazine-like detail that is more distracting than anything else...it plays off of Ms. Welch's beauty (and she is absolutely at the peak of her loveliness here) and the image of her in nothing-but-a-short-poncho is quite iconic. But it's dumb...how on earth can she ride a horse in the desert with NOTHING on the lower half of her body? Ouch! Later, she acquires a pair of super-tight deerskin slacks, which is equally ridiculous. No woman of the 1800's would have been caught dead in men's clothing. Neither would one have worn her hair long and straight or tons of black mascara. This superimposing of modern styles on a period drama is particularly badly handled and quite unnecessary, as Ms. Welch was more than beautiful enough to handle this role in proper period attire.
Robert Culp is delightful in an unexpected turn as a be-spectacled bounty hunter with a gentlemanly demeanor. The budding romance between his character, Price, and Hannie is nicely handled. This is a good example of how unexpected characters often blend better romantically than ""conventional"" stock characters. Christopher Lee has a nice supporting role as a grisly old gunmaker -- further evidence that he's a fine actor who deserved a lot better than the typical horror movie roles he often got stuck with.
The worst of this film is the comedic treatment of the three gangsters. If they had been treated more seriously, the rape would be more devastating (Price wants Hannie to forget about it and go off with him) adn it's aftermath more understandable. The attitudes about rape here are very simplistic and dated, unfortunately, but if you watch other movies about rape victims from the same era, you will see it was a standard treatment. However, comedic villains are not frightening nor do they warrant being killed off, so the ""Three Stooges"" quality defeats much of the thrust of the plot.
Despite these flaws, ""Hannie Caulder"" is consistently interesting and generally well-acted, with good cinematography. It represents a very rare attempt to show  a western with a female protagonist, let alone an ""action hero"" type who gets to ride and shoot and defend herself! The budding feminism that produced this still had a long way to go in terms of understanding the psychology of rape, but compare ""Hannie Caulder"" to such otherwise excellent modern westerns such as ""Unforgiven"" or ""Open Range"" where the female parts are limited to prostitutes or schoolmarms.
It would be fascinating to see this remade today with some of these elements addressed (the rape, the ""funny"" rapists). However, this is a nicely done and unusual western drama from a period where corny Spaghetti Westerns were the norm. It took some guts and creativity to break that mold and ""Hannie Caulder"" is the interesting result. Hopefully, they will get this out on DVD one of these days...it would be fascinating to hear commentary from the surviving cast members about this film.",1087603200,15,3811,4.964006259780907
419259,4,6301996100,"Hannie Caulder is a surprisingly good western with a very good cast.  After a failed bank robbery, three bumbling brothers come upon a lone house in the desert.  They kill the man of the house and rape his wife, Hannie.  The trio burns the house and leaves her for dead.  However, Hannie survives hoping to one day get her revenge on the three gunmen.  She runs into a bounty hunter who begins to teach her how to handle and fire a gun with some sort of accuracy so she will be able to exact her revenge on the brothers.  In a way, this is the female version of Nevada Smith with Hannie chasing after three gunmen just like Steve McQueen's character, Max, did in Nevada Smith.  The gunfights are well choreographed with blood squibs, ala The Wild Bunch.  Hannie Caulder is a very good revenge western that is well worth a watch.
  Raquel Welch stars as frontier wife turned gunfighter, Hannie Caulder, who teams up with a bounty hunter so she can kill the men who raped her and killed her husband.  She does a lot with so little, and it doesn't help that she never looked better than she did in this movie.  Much of the first half hour has her in a poncho and nothing else.  Robert Culp is also excellent as infamous bounty hunter, Thomas Luther Price, who teaches Hannie how to handle a gun.  The bumbling Clemens brothers, Emmett, Frank, and Rufus, are played by Ernest Borgnine, Jack Elam, and Strother Martin.  For such despicable people, this movie gives them lots of comedic moments.  Christopher Lee stars in a small part as a gunmaker, Bailey, who makes a specialized gun for Hannie.  The movie also stars Stephen Boyd and Aldo Sambrell in uncredited roles.  It is a shame there is no DVD release for Hannie Caulder since it is such a beautifully shot movie.  For a better than average revenge western with the gorgeous Raquel Welch, check out Hannie Caulder!",1086307200,24,1867,4.5359281437125745
