5275560,5,B00979JTWK,"This  show never falters. No doubt series four will be as impressive as the  previous  3. Where else in the world can  you see a television series that  has the very best in writing,acting and direction? One  word of warning  when watching this  Highlands episode: DO NOT  watch the  only extra on the disc  before seeing the  episode. I made that mistake and and was extremely disappointed  to find out  what happens to one of the main characters. the question is - why did they  include a major spoiler  in the  extra.",1357776000,25,520,4.478260869565218
5275561,3,B00979JTWK,"As a self proclaimed Downton Abbey fan I was greatly looking forward to the 2012 Christmas Special, particularly as the 2011 Special was probably the best ever Downton episode.  However, sadly I have to say that compared with what we have become used to this was really rather a disappointment and certainly an anti climax.

The episode is set in September 1922 about eighteen months after the end of Series 3.  The  Crawley family accompanied by a few servants, travel to Scotland to visit their cousins.  Meanwhile the rest of the staff are left at Downton under the watchful eye of Carson.  However, for a large part of the time nothing much of note really occurs and for me the main interest is in the stunning Scottish Highland scenery.  Certainly things happen, but they are not very significant in the greater scheme and 93 minutes was beginning to seem much too long for this episode.

Right at the end there is a very dramatic event.  I will not give out any spoilers on this although at this point it has been quite widely publicized.  This was very hurried so it will be interesting to see how it is picked up in the next series - in the immediate aftermath or after an interval of some months.  In any case I thought it was not handled very well and did not come near to redeeming a below par Christmas Special.  The program certainly did not leave you on a high on the evening of Christmas Day when it was first broadcast.

I am sorry to be writing a less than glowing Downton Abbey review since what has come before has been so good, and it has been amongst my favorite programs.  Series 4 and the 2013 Christmas Special have already been announced so let's hope that these may return to the standard that viewers have enjoyed so much because unless they do, I do not think we will be seeing many more series.

This episode will very likely be included with the Series 3 release in the USA.  Certainly the 2011 Christmas Special was included with the Series 2 DVD in the USA, but not in the UK.  Hence it is not worth ordering this separately.",1356739200,6,2057,4.442666666666667

5275563,4,B00979JTWK,"for me the storyline was far too abrubtly ended, the birth too clinical and detached for such a long awaited and important arrival especially after the protracted romance of arguably theseries two principal characters.

5275568,5,B00979JTWK,Downton Abbey continues to be a spectacular series in every way.  There are many twists and turns but the viewer is kept enthralled throughout,1367625600,,142,4.916666666666667

5275570,4,B00979JTWK,"I see a couple of complaining reviews about the special, (looks as if it was shot last summer- it's ""Christmas"" in broadcast date (UK) only) but I found it to be pretty much up to the usual ""Downton"" standard and an episode worth watching. Dan Stevens three year contract was up and he wanted out- so the writers obliged him, shocked a few p epode with that one.
No need for an American ""Downton Abbey"" fan to buy this stand alone ""special""- just buy the ""Original UK edition"" DVD or Blu ray sets, they include it and they're Region 1 playable on standard players with no problem. I've seen the DVD set and it's as clear, or better, a picture as the TV broadcast.",1362960000,,663,4.354838709677419
5275571,3,B00979JTWK,"Well having watched the series Three Christmas special otherwise titled ""A Journey to the Highlands"" I must report that the title says it all really.
SO little happens.
It's really more like an extended travel commercial for Scotland.

As suggested by the title, almost the entire piece is set in that very country, .....at the ""rellies"" place which of course is this Scottish Baronial monster edifice straight out of Disneyland, and furnished with a fortune in paintings on every wall, ...but of course they're broke. (Rolls eyes!)
The Highland setting means we get an abundance of heather,stags,fishing creels, fly-rods, muddy old tweeds, Norfolk jackets and the obligatory dour and laconic ghillie overseeing a shooting party.
(Strangely enough, we never hear or see even one gunshot, despite a very dead stag being brought home. Might offend the sensitive? The upper class English/Scots LOVED massacre-ing things with guns, ...still do! (Has about the same appeal as schools do in America I presume by all reports...)

So it's pretty picture after VERY pretty pictures as per usual for Downton Abbey, but don't envy them.
 The entire cast spent the time being absolutely eaten alive by very persistent midges, which are in plague proportions thereabouts.

Nothing much at all really happens, ..there's a bit of a marital conflict between the rellies, resulting in their lone daughter coming to live at Downton Abbey NEXT series, ....of course to replace the dead daughter they lost in childbirth.

(Prediction: AND YOU CAN BET YOUR LIFE she'll not only replace Lady Sybil, but she'll MARRY the recently elevated and currently mourning chauffeur too!)

Other than that it's all scotch, picnics by the loch and dancing reels at the ghillies ball, up in ""the big hoose"".

 I must confess to awaiting a tragedy the entire show, ...and it's a LONG one too, or at least it seemed so to me.
Somehow it's got that feeling of impending doom encapsulated within the picturesque.
(Or was I just pre-supposing Fellows' by now predictable writing style?)

Anyway, Fellowes is never one to shy away from writing the bleedin' obvious, but you have to wait right until the very end for tragedy to rear its ugly head, and sure enough, ... right on cue, it does. (All very prettily done though my dears, ...nothing at all visually confronting to put you off your Earl Grey you understand, other than one tastefully presented little trickle.)

Now of course I'm NOT going to spoil it all for you, but if you can't see what's coming a mile before it finally happens on screen then you also were probably taken by surprise at Lady Sybil's death from eclampsia.
The ending has already been widely reported in the media, but as said in a review above, if you wish to maintain your own naivety, DO NOT watch the special features first as it will open your eyes VERY swiftly.

 The whole thing is certainly long and drawn out as far as any plot advancement goes, but if you're content to sit back and watch people in beautiful costumes parade around in front of beautiful interiors and scenery, you'll no doubt love it. (Hmmmm. Seems I'm always writing that exact same thing in every D.A. review now!)
That being so, I'm guessing we can all look forward to more of those gushing reviews here about how clever and wonderful it all is.
People will insist on mistaking prettiness for any substance though, ...or the Khadasians would all be on welfare long ago, eh?

Scotland LOOKS wonderful, ....midges aside, and the castle is an incredible concoction of about six styles and periods that's worth seeing in itself.
Elizabeth McGovern STILL tilts her head and peers through her eyebrows, .....DO count the times she does this! That certainly hasn't changed.
Bates can now manage a smile, but there's a similar plotline brewing between Lady Edith and her eager publisher beau, ...who's trapped in an empty marriage to an insane wife. (Divorce was NOT allowed in such circumstances, ...will she ""die"" unexpectedly in somewhat suspicious circumstances?)

As you can see, you, like me, will no doubt spend more time wondering about what will happen NEXT, rather than pondering what happens in this episode, ...which in truth is so little.

Anyone of the gay persuasion will certainly be up in arms at the way Thomas just meekly settles for so little after he has made a most gallant ""rescue"" at his own personal risk that sees him suffer quite considerably, and all for another thoughtless little twink.

Anyone of the straight persuasion will start to wonder how anyone could have been so much in love with the self-centred and very unemotional Lady Mary?

Everyone will wonder why this instalment contains so little story, ...other than THAT one big ""revelation"", ..which it isn't!

Three stars from me, .....visually entertaining, but definitely no stretch on the powers of comprehension if you like some meat in your stories.

Why am I still watching this far into the series you might be asking?
Well I do enjoy the discussions here, and love it or hate it, you can't take part unless you've seen the material.
(Although I notice elsewhere here on Amazon that never having seen/read it doesn't prevent people giving ratings and meaningless ""reviews"". Anyone else notice that?
Why do people insist on skewing the ratings by giving one star and whining that by now ubiquitous ""doesn't play on my player"" comment?)",1357776000,3,5388,4.9206174200661525
