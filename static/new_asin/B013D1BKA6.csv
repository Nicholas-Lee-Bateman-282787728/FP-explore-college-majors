8727340,3,B013D1BKA6,"The Hound of the Baskervilles, 1959 film

The movie starts with a man being thrown through an expensive glass window! This man objected to the abuse of his daughter by an aristocrat. This girl has escaped from her locked room. She will be hunted down by the pack of dogs. Sir Hugo swears an oath. When the dogs whimper Sir Hugo rides on alone to catch the girl and attack her. But he is attacked by a hound from hell! Dr. Mortimer visits Sherlock Holmes about a problem. Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead in unusual circumstances. His heir arrived in London and may be in danger. Holmes will take this case. Sir Henry Baskerville has lost a single boot at the hotel. [Boots placed outside a hotel room are cleaned and polished in the night.] Holmes cautions Sir Henry. The danger is near at hand.

At Dartmoor they learn of an escaped murderer. One portrait of Sir Hugo was stolen some months earlier. Dr. Watson learns about the circumstances of the death. Bishop Franklin visits Sir Henry and talks about Sir Charles. Watson meets Stapleton, who recently rented a farm. Watson runs after a young woman and falls into the mire, but is rescued by Stapleton and his daughter Cecile. Watson and Sir Henry see a signal light at night from the moor and investigate. They see a man run away and follow. There is a howl in the dark Watson explores the moors and is surprised to see Holmes there! Holmes found Selden and talked to him. They hear a mans screams and a dogs howl. They will return by daylight. At Baskerville Hall they find Sir Henry. The next morning they search for the body, and find it mutilated. Holmes talks to the Barrymores about the escaped convict Selden.

Holmes learns about the local expert entomologist, and asks about a missing tarantula. Who visited him the day the spider went missing? Sir Henry visits the Stapleton home. Cecile talks to him. Sir Henry is like his Uncle Charles! Holmes discusses the facts of the case with Watson. Later he talks to Dr. Mortimer about an old abandoned tin mine. Holmes found an old dagger. Then they visit the old mine on Stapletons land. A loose mine cart causes a cave-in! Is Holmes safe? Back in their room they find something missing. Holmes deduces this is a threat to Sir Henry tonight. He also explains why that portrait was stolen, and who is the guilty party. [No surprise.] After Sir Henry leaves, Holmes and Watson follow. Cecile meets Sir Henry and reminds him of the legend. She shows her true personality and tells the truth. The hound and Stapleton show up for a show down. Holmes shoots the hound, Watson shoots the owner. Cecile runs away and makes a misstep to escape justice. Holmes explains his reasoning.

This is an adaption of Sir Arthur Conan Doyles best known and least controversial of his four long stories. This movie changed some of the details of this classic story. What is new is not good, what is good is not new. The characters of Stapleton and Cecile were altered; the character Laura Lyons, typewriter, was eliminated. This version is not better than the movies that were truer to the original story. Does this version have a new message? The original told of the morals of the hereditary aristocracy, like The List of Adrian Messenger. Selden murdered women of the street (a reference to Jack the Ripper).",1455235200,,3306,4.636518771331058
