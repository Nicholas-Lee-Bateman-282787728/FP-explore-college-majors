247785,5,6300213781,"This is a beautifully interlinked movie.  Searching the world for his longlost father the always independently irreverent (but gentlemanly) Popeye swaggers into our lives with all the glory of his convictions and  his mispronounced words.  Specifically tailored to look just like a cartoon  come to life (not unlike the movie treatment of ""Dick Tracy"" in  this respect) ""Popeye"" is more colourful than life, more  ridiculous than life, larger than life, and contains more coincidences in  the plot than you could ever expect to find in life.  The songs are an  integral part of the plot and the enjoyment of the viewing, many carrying  meanings and underlying strengths that can be applied to any household.  (My personal favourite being the song that starts off with ""It's not  easy being me."")  Throughout the story, tiny details  unimportant to  the plot itself add to the intricate beauty of it.  Look, for instance,  for the brief visual comment on barbershop quartets and the simple elegance  of the gadget that produces it; and the bare effectiveness of the Oyl's  house after Olive has lost favour with the villian, Bluto.  Thank you very  much for showing us where and how Swee'pea entered Popeye's life.  One  question: I understand the word play in the names of Olive, Castor, and  Coal Oyl, but what is Nana Oyl?",931305600,11,1324,4.940639269406392
247786,5,6300213781,"As the before reviewer also said, this was one of my first movies to watch, and after 16 years has become one of my all time favorites. We have rented Popeye more times than any other movie. We couldn't buy it before  now because it is a hard movie to find -  but not any more. Finally I hope  to add this film to our 300 movie collection. AND DONT LISTEN TO THE  CRITIC'S they don't know what they are missing. I guess they have no  ""Imajiganation.""",913075200,3,450,4.126436781609195

248011,5,6300213781,"It got panned by several critics, but I consider this a wonderful movie, accurate to the world conceived in the mind of the ""Popeye"" creator, right down to the speech idiosyncrasies of Popeye and The Commodore: ""fadder to de shark, brudder to de piranhica...!""  Robin Williams, rest his troubled soul, was ideal for the lead role, as was Shelly Long for Olive... and really, every actor/actress for every part in this movie.",1508025600,,424,4.888888888888889

248192,5,6300213781,"One of Robert Altman's least-known masterpieces. Who would have thought that the Popeye property could make such a lovely little operetta? The way that the great Giuseppe Rotunno photographs Sweethaven harbor makes the little boats look like some kind of Venetian regatta. Williams and Duvall could hardly be more charming or delightfully weird as the leads, with an excellent supporting cast. Definitely worth owning as a DVD, since you'll want to go back and watch it again and again, to keep finding more details in the film's rich texture.",1484006400,2,543,5.112359550561798

248397,5,6300213781,"Always one of my favorite movies, I recently showed this to my girlfriend who had an odd fear of the cartoon version of Olive Oyl but quickly got over that with Shelly Duvall's quirky and memorable turn as the character and heroine of this movie. Robin Williams made a great impression on me as Popeye when I was younger and seeing this as a much older man hasn't lost it's charms. Robert Altman went above and beyond when he filmed this movie, creating the entire world that Popeye lived in, rather than just the one note of two adversaries duking it out in what would have been what today's standard adventure faire. There so much to find in this and the backstory to find are just as fascinating. Seriously, find out something about a random character and try not to get lost down the rabbit hole of information. Ham Gravy was just one name that I found and Robert Altman made sure to include him into the story and especially the engagement party too.",1473638400,,955,4.494252873563219

Ray Walston, Paul Dooley, Paul L. Smith, Roberta Maxwell as Nana Oyl, Richard Libertini and Donald Moffatt as the Taxman, musical score by Harry Nilson and you've got a wonderfully entertaining film the entire family can enjoy.  This is my second copy.  I bought my original Popeye DVD when it was first issued many years ago.  I bought this one as a spare copy.  Whenever I'm feeling a bit down or depressed I spend some time in Sweet Haven and all is right with the world again.  All those grumpy critics who panned this delightful movie need a serious attitude adjustment. I'll bet they hate spring flowers, songbirds and puppies too.",1459728000,,792,4.814814814814815

Every unpronounced syllable shows the care and precision that can only come from a strong vision and understanding between actor and director.

Neither totally cartoony nor over-the-top live action laugh fest (a la The Grinch), it ambles its way musically around one of the most delightful set pieces ever constructed from scratch for a moving picture, the seaside village of ""Sweethaven"" on the Isle of Malta. Add the absolute commitment to its main characters, played straight by Robin Williams and Shelley Duval, a brilliant song cycle by the Nilsson at his best, and the talk-over style (complete with barely discernible Popeye mumbling asides) by Robert Altman and it is one fine bit of cinema joy. Let it grow on you and discover its many charms. It gets better with age.",1454544000,5,810,4.869565217391305

Some 35 years or so later, I thought  I'd rewatch it, thinking maybe an older perspective would improve my opinion of it. Turns out, my 10-year-old self got it right. The pace and the editing was a drag. The acting wasn't really all that good (Robin Williams mumbled a bit too much & his acting seemed to subdued. Bad directing?) and the singing was near horrid.

Wow! Bad mistake. Besides being badly dated at this point, it simply isn't any good. Starting from the beginning with the way overlong opening of Popeye rowing in to town in a supposed storm. The soundtrack is full of lightning crashing and the screen is darkened, but the scene was obviously filmed on a placid day. It's laughably bad. And it just gets worse. Robin Williams played Popeye like the old 1920's cartoon Popeye (which I love BTW) where Popeye was constantly muttering under his breath. It was great in the cartoons, but in this expensive, over-the-top musical, the muttering just gets lost. I suppose I liked it when I was a kid partly because I loved the cartoons, which my kids aren't familiar with, but also because production values weren't as slick as they are now. My kids, who are used to more modern fare, gave up on this halfway through. Don't waste your time",1448064000,,1058,4.430769230769231

Do not expect an MGM spectacle of a musical but a bunch of talented actors (many of which don't have great singing voices) having fun making a one of a kind film.

249833,4,6300213781,"All that was missing from this bizarre art house movie was Andy Warhol's Campbell soup can.

Nonetheless, there were cans in this movie, cans filled with spinach to give Popeye secret strength to fight off his number one nemesis, Pluto, to battle for the heart of his affections, Olive Oyl.

To say this 1980 movie is bizarre is an understatement. Let's try hyper-bizarre. This movie is an artistic, avant-garde statement of the highest order. It's so unlike any that I've ever seen before. This movie just makes me think of art like seeing a Picasso.

 By far, the visuals are the most attention-catching, second the customs, third the markups. The visuals from the cliffs to the boats are spectacular and eye-catching.

From the sleepy harbor of Sweethaven, to the buildings and houses on the cliff and hills, this movie has a European art house flair to it. Yet it's based on a classic American cartoon hero: Popeye.

I'm sure when this high-budget film was released thirty-five years ago, the European film makers took notice. Another wave was heading for the shoreline; the wave carried Popeye the Sailor Man. I could see the great European directors, like Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro taking notice, and of course taking notes: a new wave of film making was rolling to the shore.

This film is so unlike Hollywood's typical blockbuster releases. It makes an artistic statement rather than box office drumbeats which millions of fans follow along to the cinema. An art movie for the mainstream, what a concept!",1445126400,3,1519,4.91015625

Makeup, scenery, costuming, storyline, actors, all do well in portraying this cartoon series. It is both strange and yet, in some way, compelling; kind of quirky and yet funny as well.

I first saw this when I was a kid during the 90's. I was somewhere between the ages of 3 and 5, which was between 1992 and 1996. My mom and her brother each had a recorded off tv VHS tape - his was off Comedy Central, which had commercial breaks, and was recorded way back before I can remember ever watching anything on that channel. All I can remember to describe it as, was the channels break interruptions before commercials started playing were cheesy, with what sounded like guys making grunting sounds, and some weird droning musoc playing, almost like alien UFO sci-fi type music.
Anyway, her copy was recorded off HBO, with no commercials. Howevee, both were very identical, in that they were BOTH cut very badly! Many songs were missing, such as Popeye's ""Blow Me Down"" song he sings after first arriving in the port town of Sweet Haven, Bluto's ""I'm mean"" song, and Poopdeck Pappy's song he sang while he, Popeye and the Oyls chased after Bluto, while he was going after Poopdeck Pappy's treasure.
Other songs were shortened, and others remained, such as ""Sweet Haven"", ""Everything Is Food"", Olive Oyl's ""He Needs Me"", and Popeye's song he sang while writing a letter to the kidnapped Swee'Pea.
I first saw the full, uncut version sometime back between 2005 and 2010, and I have to say, it really made the whole film better to know there was more to it. Yes, it is a musical, and the songs are very well done, so much so that the recorded versions that appear in the film are better than the versions on the official soundtrack! Shelley Duvall is great as Olive Oyl, and is another example of an actor or actress who nailed the character, and I could not imagine anyone else being the character. Robin Williams is the same as Popeye, as I said, although every actor in this film was great as the character they played!
The film is comical and full with physical action that is done very similarly to the 1960's Batman film. Usually Popeye might end up in a fight with some other characters. It's very similar to the animated series, which is based off I've only ever seen a handful of those old shows anyway, since I had two VHS collection tapes back in the day with a few on them.
Another great thing about this folm, and probably the best selling point for it, is that it does not utilize any special effects! It is a down to earth basics film, where people, costumes and sets were put on camera! I'm always enjoying films like that more and more than the over-budgeted, over-rated mainstream crap that is spewed out of Hollywood anymore, which is so phony and fake, and relies too heavily on CG! They really don't make real films like they used to anymore, which is a shame, because it is almost an extinct breed of cinema. And any time any kind of indy, or down to earth basics types of films are attempted anymore, they just fall flat because people don't know how to do them anymore. I know of only ONE other film that is newer, and achieved a good down to earth basics feel, and that is Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie.
Anyway, I would nearly recommend this to anyone, but so many people have written such negative reviews for this before me, I get the feeling they're people that enjoy seeing over-blown, over-the-top big budgeted, hoghly rated films that have to rely on CG. They watch this, and IT'S NOT Michael Bay's Transformers, IT'S NOT Michael Bay's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, IT'S NOT Peter Jackson's The Hobbit, etc... Pick any over-rated big budget film that's been made by Michael Bay or Peter Jackson.

So, this film IS NOT for everyone, but people who enjoy genuine, down to earth basics, real film cinema, will enjoy this. My only gripe however, is with Robbin Williams speech in the film. He does mumble when ever he speaks, and honestly it does make it hard to understand some things he says throughout the film. This was never a part of the Popeye character in the old shows I saw as a kid, but other than that, the rest of his performance is great!",1441843200,,4203,4.5013089005235605

250615,4,6300213781,"I still love this film as much as I did when it first came out, when I was ten years old! The sad part is, many people (and a whole lot of critics) just don't seem to get this movie. Simply put, ""Popeye"" is a tribute to Elzie Segar's original comic strip. This is why you have Olive's entire family in it and Popeye doesn't do a whole lot of spinach eating! Legendary cartoonist Jules Feiffer wrote the screenplay and it is quite clear that he wanted to take Popeye back to his roots.

The storyline sort of coasts along much like the daily adventures that Segar involved his characters in throughout the 1930's run of his Thimble Theatre strip. The comic was very popular and a huge influence on several generations of cartoonists. Charles Schulz cited it as a major inspiration for him. Popeye was actually a co star in the strip whose popularity soon eclipsed the main characters and made him the star. That's sort of how Popeye comes into the film, as a kind of awkward outsider who eventually becomes the hero. The film comically integrates several key Popeye stories...meeting the Oyl's, adopting Swee Pea, and finding his long lost ""Pappy"". Olive Oyl's entire clan (Cole, Nana, and Castor) is featured plus other characters not seen a lot since the early Thimble Theatre days, like Olive's ex boyfriend Ham Gravy, and George Geezil. One of the film's highlights is a boxing match with Oxblood Oxheart, another vintage character who got thrashed by Popeye in one of the classic Sunday strips from 1933!

 I think that the casting was simply spot on in this film and one of the best ever for a ""cartoon movie"". Paul Smith (who looks just like Bluto), Paul Dooley as J. Wellington Wimpy, Ray Walston as Poopdeck Pappy, and Shelley Duvall, who was truly born to play Olive Oyl (no disrespect to Shelley). The late, great Robin Williams portrayed the salty little one eyed sailor with a lot of spunky humor and heart. We're pulling for him throughout the entire picture. And, guess what, most of the time he doesn't even need spinach!

Lastly, I have always loved the music in ""Popeye"". I have the original soundtrack on vinyl and still find some of the songs stuck in my head from time to time. The touching ""Swee Pea's Lullaby"" is one of the prettiest little songs ever written! I really think that ""Popeye"" could have been a Broadway musical, in much the same way ""Li'l Abner"" was.

All in all, a favorite from my childhood and a film that still holds a special place in my heart. People who love Elzie Segar's Thimble Theatre will surely get a kick out of it because ""Popeye"" is a loving tribute to a classic comic strip.",1439424000,2,2627,4.580851063829787

250623,5,6300213781,"In honor of what would have been Robin Williams' 64th birthday, I render this review of the only film of his that I ever saw in a theater.
 The date was New Year's Day, 1981, when after several weeks of prodding, my Mom took my sisters and me to see it. Mom noted how after my initial participation in small talk,once  Jack Mercer kicked things off with the  titular character's voice in the animated prologue, I fell silent and gave the images on screen my undivided attention for most of the next hour-and-a-half.
  In this campy  live-action rendering of the Fleischer comic strip, we initially view our hero clad  in a raincoat, rowing ashore in a dinghy during a rainstorm. His destination  is the run-down seaside hamlet of Sweethaven, which, as one of my sisters observed, looked as though it could all collapse if someone sneezed.
  In view as he docks are a few townspeople, including Cindy the Drudge(Williams' then-wife, Valerie Velardi, a dance teacher who choreographed the film's dance routines).
 But almost immediately, the Taxman( Donald Moffat) appears to collect funds from the newcomer, and Popeye manages to oblige him. I took note of 'discovery of his old pipe on the ground, and felt dismayed by his unsanitary habit of putting it in his mouth.
 He becomes a boarder  of the Oyl Family, including Patriarch Cole( McIntyre Dixon), his wife, Nana( Roberta Maxwell), son, Castor(Donovan Scott), and daughter, Olive(accurately portrayed by Shelly Duvall), who is hustling about  in preparation for her engagement party.
 Popeye later sits in a bar and relates his desire to find his long-lost father as toughs laugh at him, led by Rough House( Allan Nicholas), leading to a brawl, involving detractors and innocent alike, which Popeye wins.
  He dines with his hosts, but  is tacitly turned away from Olive's engagement  party.
  The Stinettes--Mina, Mona, Mena, and Blossom(Patty  Katz, Diane Shaffer,  Julie Janney, and Natalie Blossom), complete the sewing of Olive's trousseau as for some mysterious reason, Olive packs her bag and slips out through her bedroom window.
  She meets Popeye outside as he is wandering around town. He wonders why she has fled her engagement party --a motive which will come to light when Bluto's( Paul L. Smith) violent streak is revealed as he  smashes both guests and furniture.
 As Olive and Popeye talk, Olive's basket is mysteriously switched and a baby whose mother is unable to take care of him is revealed to be inside. Via a note, the mother designates Popeye as the child's guardian, and when the two head back to Olive's house with the child in tow, the stood-up Bluto literally sees red, and trounces this new rival for Olive's affections, making  it ironic that Popeye could significantly take on a gang of detractors a day earlier.
  As Bluto works for the mysterious Commodore, the Oyl Family's taxes are hiked up in retaliation for Olive's having spurned Bluto, and as they are unable to pay, they face eviction. Castor offers to  fight the boxing champion, Oxblood Oxheart( Peter Bray) to win prize money to save their home.. But as his proud mother(Linda Hunt, in what was also her first movie) watches, Oxheart crushes his opponent far too easily--A situation redeemed when Popeye replaces Castor in the ring.
  The new couple settle down and put Swea' Pea( Director Robert Altman's grandson, Wesley Ivan Hurt) to bed,  and Olive reveals the infant's gift of clairvoyancy. They sing a gentle song expressing their desired maternal and paternal relationships with the infant--a corny but heartwarming scene that reveals the genuine love of children shared by both the future""Faerie Tale Theatre"" creator and collaborator.
  Uncle Wimpy( Paul Dooley) finagles the infant away from Popeye to use him to predict the outcome of  electronic horseraces. An angry Popeye snatches  him away from the decadent scene although the money-hungry Oyls join Wimpy in betting.
  Back out on the street, Popeye has another confrontation with the Taxman, and becomes the town hero when  he punches him and sends him into the water.
 Crunched in the  cheering crowd, Popeye loses sight of his charge, who is kidnapped and taken to the Commodore's mysterious dwelling.
  There are a few syrupy moments that showcase both the appropriateness of casting Duvall as Olive, and Robin's genuine warmth and sweetness on issues pertaining to children.
  The drama climaxes when Popeye meets Poopdeck Pappy(Ray Walston), whose physical appearance, mumbling, and meandering, are quite similar to our hero's, and there is a final triumphant  confrontation on Scab Island.
  Other characters include Bill Irwin's (who cavorted with Williams and Bobby McFerrin in the video for ""Don't Worry. Be Happy!""  a few years later) Ham Gravy, Richard Libertini's Geezil, Dennis Franz' Spike, and a few other Fleischer favorites.
  Especially in the wake of a childhood favorite's passing, I recount  fond memories of how goofy and endearing Robin was in his first starring big-screen appearance, although I debated with myself about whether the athletic star did his own back flips.
  With memories of how  this film delighted  me as an eleven-year-old, I hope that the image of the perfect live-action Popeye will delight children for many generations yet!",1437436800,,5287,5.0884749708963914

250672,2,6300213781,"So, a couple months back, a friend loaned me Popeye.  I looked at him strangely, but he swore that it had grown on him and actually wasn't that bad.  Since our tastes are pretty similar, I decided to give it a try.  Well, everyone has their off days because I really didn't enjoy this movie.

Our story opens on a dark and stormy night.  No, I'm not kidding.  But that's only for the opening credits.  By the time they are over, Popeye (Robin Williams) is pulling into the port of Sweethaven.  It seems friendly enough except toward new comers.

Eventually, Popeye finds a place to lodge with the Oyl family and meets the lovely Olive Oyl (Shelley Duvall).  Olive is about to become engaged for the fourth time to Bluto (Paul L. Smith).  Popeye is traveling in a quest to find the father who abandoned him when he was two, but what else might he find in this town?

I know next to nothing about Popeye, despite having the Atari 2600 version of the 80's video game, so I came to this movie with pretty much a clean slate.  I've got to admit I was impressed with the casting.  Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall absolutely look their iconic parts.  I know less about the other characters, although I did recognize a few names.  The actors were all great.  It was the material that let them down.

This movie isn't a story; it's a series of vignettes.  I think I would have been okay with that except for one small detail - it tried to pretend it was a story.  So here's this movie that really isn't moving things forward until suddenly things have really moved forward.  Take Olive Oyl, for instance.  She is all set to become engaged to Bluto again.  Okay, so she seems a little hesitant.  But suddenly she sneaks out of her house.  Where did that come from?  All the characters suffer from illogical actions much of the time.

Did I mention it is a musical?  Maybe it slipped my mind because the songs are mostly forgettable.  The melodies aren't catchy, the words are rather stupid, and the little bits of choreography they try aren't all that great.  Not to mention that Shelley Duvall's voice isn't all that great here.

In the first half of the movie, they stick in all kinds of running gags, mostly in the background.  Those where my favorite part of the film.  In the big group numbers near the beginning, there are some very funny moments.  And I loved the Tax Man who would tax every around him for everything.  (He'd probably tax me for mentioning him, then for putting in this parenthesis talking about him taxing me.)

Popeye is another case of looks great, but really doesn't live up to its potential.  With this cast, it should have been better than the mess it turned out to be.",1431129600,,2691,4.4517453798767965

250920,5,6300213781,"""I best one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in every culture, is the story of Popeye."" Jack Handy, Deep Thoughts

I heard somewhere that this is a role which Robin Williams hated in retrospect almost as much as he hated Mork. It's a shame, because to me this is just an ecstatically fine film, evoking all the dingy, maritime flavor of EC Segar's original Thimble Theater  comic strip (in which Popeye was originally intended to make a brief appearance as a supporting character, intended to take the Oyl family and Olive's then flame Ham Gravy from point A to point Bdid I mention that I'm maybe one of the world's most fanatical fans of Popeye lore?) Every scene, ever song, every gesture in this film is a sheer delight. It isn't just Williams, although it is remarkable how well he captures the superb, improvisational, salty spirit of voice actor Jack Mercer's animated Popeye. Shelly Duvall was born to play Olive Oyl, and I just bust a gut every time I think of her swooning over Paul L Smith's Bluto (did you know that in the comic strip his name was Brutus?): ""He's large...*sigh*...so large."" For years I was convinced that Poopdeck Pappy was played by George Carlin, but it was actually the rather incredible Ray Walston who really gets behind his self-pitying jeremiad ""It's Not Easy Being Me"". No, you won't find King Blozo, Dufus or Eugene the Jeep here, but fans of the lesser known Popeye ensemble will jump for joy at the presence of Rough House and George W. Geezil. And at least two supporting roles are played by inveterate clowns: J Wellington Wimpy by Paul Dooley and Ham Gravy by Bill Irwin. And because it's a Robert Altman movie, you know every character is given a chance to sizzle.
This feels like an opportune moment to pitch my own live action Popeye project (starring Joachim Phoenix as the titular sailor man, Angus Sampson as Bluto, Bryan Cranston as Wimpy, Angela Bettis as Olive and Pollyanna Macintosh as the Sea Hag, and directed by Lucky McKee) but that would just be self indulgent, wouldn't it.",1418428800,,2049,4.720670391061453

250922,4,6300213781,"A fun family flick. Don't expect much; it is, after all, an old, classic comic strip given life onscreen. The strip didn't have much depth, and this film only goes surface deep in exploring Popeye's backstory, how a spinach-hater came to appreciate the green stuff. If it has a message, the message is that a family--traditional or not--is built on a foundation of love, and that's worth the watch.",1418169600,,398,4.782608695652174

In an era populated by cheesy live action spoofs of cartoons, od old TV sitcoms, Altman's Popeye stood out as an authentic portrayal of a highly creative cartoon world.

I know the movie has a lot of detractors but if you're at all familiar with the Fleischer shorts and the original comic strip then you'll truly appreciate just how closely this film stuck to those roots. Williams is a pitch-perfect Popeye and, as just about everyone on the planet has written (whether they like the film or not), Shellie Duvall really does seem to have been born to play Olive Oyl. Smith makes a pretty good Bluto but I wish he'd had more deep-voiced grumbling, as he does so often in the early cartoons. Ray Walston makes for a suitably cantankerous Poopdeck Pappy. In short, just about everyone in this film is perfectly cast in their respective roles. The production & set design are terrific and the music, (while not exactly my cup of tea), is well-suited to accompany the cartoonish goings-on.  In fact, the only things missing here are the Sea Hag & Eugene The Jeep. Not sure why they chose not to use Sea Hag. (Maybe saving her as the villainess in a hoped-for but never-to-be sequel?) And honestly, given the FX limitations of the time, Eugene's absence is probably just as well.

This is a bare bones release and it's truly regrettable that the uncaring tightwads at Paramount haven't bothered to spend the time or money to dig deep into their film vaults and come up with a really spectacular Blu-ray with a pristine restored picture & sound and loaded it to the gills with all sorts of extras & behind-the-scenes stuff (posters, production stills, concept art, making of featurettes, interviews and retrospectives from cast & crew) that moviephiles like myself just love. Perhaps with Mr. Williams' tragic passing, they'll smell money to be made and give us something better than this plain jane edition some day. For now... it'll have to do. Farewell Robin. You will be truly & forever missed. At least we have an amazing legacy of incredible film & television performances to cherish and remember you by. 4 STARS",1413763200,5,1994,4.773913043478261

I only kept looking because of the stature of the stars, other supporting cast, director, and producer; so many high quality people, strong production values and such a boring dud of a film.  It beggared the imagination.

There had to be more and so I watched it occasionally and gradually I began to see the subtle beauty in the acting and story.  To go into detail my ruin/spoil it for you. Plus there is the chance that Ive talked myself into it and it is really a beautifully filmed dud that was DOA on the cutting room floor.  Its for you to say.  Me, I think It is a classic or ought to be.  Go ahead have a little faith and take a look. Enjoy.

251258,3,6300213781,"Robert Altman's ""Popeye"" (1980) features Robin Williams in the titular role, Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, Ray Walston as Pappy and others as Bluto, Wimpy and so on. These actors are outstanding as these characters, particularly Williams and Duvall. Unfortunately, I found the story boring and the excellent seaside Malta set too confining and therefore increasingly dull. If Altman would have included a more compelling story it would've worked better for adults. As it is, its appeal is limited to small kids, hardcore Popeye fans and devotees of Williams.

The reason 1994's The Flintstones"" and even the 2000 sequel worked so well (for me anyway) was because they both had interesting and entertaining stories. ""Popeye"" is dull by comparison, although somewhat amusing. If my wife -- who loves the movie -- wasn't with me I would've never gotten through it.

The film runs 114 minutes (too long).

251521,5,6300213781,"I am not a Robins Williams fan, but in the case of this motion picture, I think he was outstanding.  Not only did he play the original
Popeye extremely well, but he even looks like him..Arf, Arf, Arf.  Here he is looking for his Pappy and comes to the villiage of
Sweet Haven (gorgeous set, brilliant!!) to hunt him down.  Blutto has got the town terrified of him and does not like Popeye interfering
with his scam.  Anyhow, he plans to marry Olive Oyl who really doesn't want to marry him and was planning to run away.  Both
these characters (and Blutto) look like they were lifted right out of a Max Fleischer cartoon of the 1940s.  I am not much of a musical
movie fan but this one has some great songs and very funny moments.  All the classic characters are there including Wimpy.  It
seems Blutto has kidnapped Popeye's Pappy though I am not sure why; but it makes for some fun (lots!).  Then theres Sweet Pea.
In the 1950s Paramount would seize the rights to Popeye and put out some awful cartoons that were totally boring and re-cycled
the same plot in every short.  Remember Casper the Friendly Ghost; same thing.  But this film keeps the original ideas alive,
at least for a couple of hours.  Five stars for this one.  I got this from Amazon.  I am one of the few people who have still a
laser disc player with a number of Laserdiscs.  Popeye is one of those though I rarely use the machine anymore.  Enjoy",1410220800,,1415,4.363984674329502

251524,1,6300213781,"Worst Robin Williams movie ever.  I loved the cartoons, but they must have figured save money on dialogue and have Williams mutter and grumble.  Yes I know Popeye mutters and grumbles but silent movies have better flow than this. Then again with Robin Williams' style you need the witty banter and not Popeye's mutterings.

Oh, and the singing?  I think it set the sullen mood for the whole show.  The cartoons I grew up with were lighthearted and up beat.  This one was shot in the foot by the songs and dragged you till the end.

Even the slap stick was depressing,  I was hoping to see good physical comedy not a physical depression.  Yeah you had some poorly timed fight scenes and Bluto's temper tantrums but even they seemed forced and overly deliberate.  Each scene was like walking through a different child's elementary school art collection. I suppose it was to give us a feel of a comic, strip frame by frame we walk through each scene.  But it didn't work or flow.  My children who usually are glued to the tv even when it is on commercial nagged me, why are we watching this?",1409961600,,1088,4.494897959183674

251527,4,6300213781,"THE FILM: POPEYE was Robin Williams' first starring role in a feature film, and he inhabits the character perfectly. This movie, more than any other that I can remember, is the best example of a live action cartoon, in the best sense of the term. Watching it was like a cartoon come to life. It was truly wonderful and extremely funny to watch characters behaving as if they were in one, from their movement to the way they spoke. And none exemplify this better than Robin Williams in the title role, who channels his unbridled comic talent into a completely dedicated performance which is equally hilarious and touching. The story is fairly simple, though. Popeye rows into the town of Sweethaven looking for his 'Pap.' While there, he (and the audience) find out about how messed up that town really is. They have an absurd amount of taxes, and everyone is kept in fear of a mysterious Commodore and Captain Bluto, who run the town. He also meets Olive Oyl, played (at times screechingly) by Shelley Duvall (who also fits her role perfectly). This film is also a musical, and there several catchy numbers which have the capacity to stick in your head if you aren't careful. If I have any complaints, it's that Shelley Duvall isn't as good a singer as she is an actress, but nothing she does really ruins the picture. The biggest flaw in the film is direction the narrative takes about two thirds of the way through. I also thought that Bluto wasn't really given his due as a character. Still, for Robin Williams fans this will be essential viewing. It's a wacky, manic experience that demands to be seen.

THE DISC: This is a barebones release from Paramount, with no special features to speak of. The only thing ""special"" is that you can choose between a 5.1 Surround or Stereo track. The transfer was decent, with no visible damage; and the sound mix was also pretty good, but not really dynamic or spectacular. At some points, the post-production dubbing stuck out more than usual, though. Honestly, this film deserves a better release but with the director and star both passed away, a special release seems unlikely. Maybe one day they'll see fit to release it on Blu-ray.

OVERALL: This is a very unique film that has a lot of elements to recommend it, even if the narrative is a little uneven/messy. The disc presentation isn't the greatest, but it's the best we have at the moment.",1409875200,7,2391,4.6635071090047395

251680,4,6300213781,"I first saw this movie when it was released and I was a young woman. My initial reaction was ""meh"" as were so many reviewers back then. I just watched it again, 34 years later, and believe that it is an impressionist work of art. So often, artistic endeavors within pop culture become recognized for their artistic integrity several decades later. This movie is magical realism at its finest. Altman's casting and choice of Harry Nilsson as song writer were perfect. This may be Robin Williams' finest character portrayal, as he took a cartoon character and gave him heart and soul. Shelly Duvall is perfect Olive Oyl. Swee' Pea's Lullabye and He Needs Me are classic Nilsson beauty.",1408752000,,683,4.796610169491525

251682,2,6300213781,I finally got around to watching this for first time and was bored out of my mind.  The entire first hour contained almost no story whatsoever could have been eliminated to make a much better movie.  The musical numbers ranged from bad to mediocre.  I understand that Olive isn't supposed to be a good singer but why give her two full songs?  That was about 7 minutes of torture I could have done without. The sound 'effects' (Bluto's grunting and Olive's 'o's) were annoying and had the sound quality of a movie made 20 years earlier. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because my 8-yr-old thought it was 'ok'.  I guess you have to be a Popeye fan to like this movie.,1408752000,2,680,4.322834645669292

""Kick them in the butt, Popeye""!

The citizen chasing his hat gag and the piano ""avoidance"" by Popeye were incredible.  Robert Altman was a genius and this movie, when properly perused shows just some of his great talent.

251806,4,6300213781,"Upon learning of the tragic demise of Robin Williams, I decided to spend some time enjoying his art again, and what better way to start than his first full feature movie role as Popeye the Sailor?  The movie sure is quirky, but if you were a fan of the original cartoon, you'll find that William's ""Popeye"" and Duvall's ""Olive Oyl"" were right on target and very faithful to the original.  I've seen a few reviews that says this movie was a flop, but if you look at the numbers, they spent about $20 million to make it and it grossed around $50 million.  In Hollywood terms, that's a success, not a flop

Robin Williams will be sorely missed by many.  I will admit this wasn't my favorite role of his by far, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.",1407801600,,742,4.3478260869565215

Robin Williams mumbling Popeye, Shelly Duval - Olive Oyl incarnate! Ray Walston as a profane Poopdeck Pappy. And what seems like a cast of hundreds. The film is so densely populated that repeated viewings are worth it - catch the cameos: Linda Hunt, Dennis Franz, even (attention Beatles fans) Klaus Voormann. I'm an old so I saw this when it came out in1980. My only complaint is that, from the beginning in the theater this film seemed fuzzy like the camera lens had Vaseline on it, and the stereo sound made Robin Williams's mumblings even more hard to catch. The DVD version that came out awhile ago was a tad better. I hope the HD version (also on Prime!) is an improvement.",1407715200,,833,4.635135135135135

I bought the album (didn't like it, so I recorded the theater version with my Walkman cassette recorder, just for myself), bought the book on the making of, and was inspired. Marine World Africa USA had a ski-boat show in the marina with a Popeye and Bluto and Olive Oyl lookalikes, because of the film, and it was my favorite.
I remember the red carpet coverage of its theater premiere, and Cher was there with her two kids (Chastity/Chaz and Elijah Blue) gushing how she loved it, and Robin Williams, especially.

The film's makeup artist made Shelly Duvall carry parasols to preserve her ""exquisite ivory complexion,"" while Baby Sweet-Pea (Altman's grandson) skin ""was perfection itself.""

The color of the extra's costumes were toned down by dipping them into a cauldron of coffee to dye them down. The thought was that the brightness was just too much.

The film had so many details, like when the Barber shop door opened, you can see the striped barber pole spinning around, and the pharmacy had a mortar and pestle that spun around. I read a book about bashing movies like this which went over-budget, and studio execs bashed Robert Altman for dwelling on small characters, spending ""too much time"" on them; artistically, it pays off; and I always hoped the film would be redeemed by time and posterity, but that may be too much to hope for, unless it gets a proper DVD with tribute by a loving critique.",1402876800,,1489,4.653992395437262

  This is a live-action motion picture based upon the Popeye, the Sailor Man  cartoons (1933-57) shown in the movie houses.
  Popeye first began as a comic strip in newspapers in 1929.
  Twice I have tried to watch this movie and I get sleepy. I just can't get into the movie.
  Robin Williams is wonderful as ""Popeye"", but doing the voice must be hard on his throat. Shelley Duvall fit perfectly as ""Olive Oil"", but too much ""Oh, Oh!""

251993,5,6300213781,"In 1975 maverick director Robert Altman used the city of ""Nashville"" along with 27 lead characters (no fewer) as a microcosm of America and its earnest but misguided dreamers--a critique of tne ""American dream"" that seems no less relevant today than it did in the '70s.  In ""Popeye"" Altman once again succeeds in presenting a dysfunctional community--""Sweetwater""--one that at least succeeds in living up to the world of the original comic strip and the B&W cinematic cartoons bearing the name of its protagonist.

When I saw it in the theater, my only disappointment, I now realize, was the failure of ""Popeye's community of ""Sweetwater"" to grip me like that of ""Nashville.""  But revisiting the film after cinematic fluff like ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and the painfully dumbed down ""Patch Adams"" is to experience a revelation about the genius of Altman in assembling this ""cinematic musical"" into a believable ""criticism of life"" that is at the same time true to the original Popeye of the cartoon.  If your young ones have, like mine, been programmed by the sonic vibrations and broad character painting of a spectacle like ""Frozen,"" you'll admittedly have a task on your hands to get them to sit still through ""Popeye,"" played to perfection by the muttering, double-register (but never over-the-top, never corny or vulgar) Robin Williams.  But preparing them to see the film and to see, moreover, what it says--about individualism and community, family and marriage, friends and strangers, us vs. ""them""--may be well worth the effort.

Altman's medium is the original ""Popeye the Sailor Man,"" a cartoon which has more ""subtones"" issuing from the mouths of its characters than clear and coherent senteneces.  And from the opening scenes of Popeye's arrival in an unstable community, we see much that should (or certainly will) be familiar to viewers of all ages.  Popeye tries to act and talk like a 'free agent"" yet he's beset at every turn by tax collectors, policemen, greedy salesmen-extortionists, and the powers of a community comprising a motley collection of selfish, narcissistic citizens who, just barely, manage to stay on the right side of the law.

In the family table scene there are elements right out of Charles Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"" or of 18th century novelists like Lawrence Sterne and Henry Fielding (""Tom Jones,"" ""Joseph Andrews"").  If you think ""Popeye"" is a hard sell, try getting a teen to read the novel ""Tom Jones"", which once was thought so naughty and ribald it became a box office hit when translated to the screen in the '60s.  Reading the novel today, the grammar, the very syntax of the English sentences, the genial philosophy prefacing each chapter all seem beyond the reach of fthe language-deprived generation of the present millennium.  But if they miss the details and ironic subtleties of Sterne's or Fielding's carefully crafted sentences, they can at least be educated to spot their visual equivalent in the syntax of Altman's clever editing and in the ""diction"" of shots with telling detail.  It all amounts to a carefully constructed, cluttered ""mis en scene"" that could hold its own alongside some of the great painters of the Old Flemish school.

Throughout the film I was acutely conscious of a narrative driven by two considerations: the immediate plot and its complementary archetype. Popeye is on the familiar quest of searching for his father, or ""his pap,"" whom he never knew.  The search is disrupted by his relationship with Olive Oil (played to perfection by Shelly Duval) and their unexpected ""gift"" of an unwanted baby, arguably the cutest infant ever to be seen in a movie (though Robin Williams is one of the few actors who cannot be upstaged by a baby--however cute). The conflicting motives of the masculine and feminine come into sharp view in the in a duet between the two protagonists.  Popeye looks forward to a life of ""sailing,"" while Olive Oil counters with her dream of a life of ""staying""--an opposition that is never resolved in the song--and arguably the story.

Strangely, the last third of the movie feels anticlimactic and unsatisfying.  The problems are twofold: 1. a failure to take more seriously the surprising discovery of Popeye's look-alike, sound-alike father (played by Ray Walston); 2. the lack of adequate closure for the new ""family"" of Popeye--his woman, their child, and his father--as well as some restoration of civility to the dystopia of Sweetwater.  Closure--it's all important, and Altman was no doubt under pressure to get the project over with.

In the end Popeye will get his spinach and defeat his nemesis, Bluto, while acquitting himself with Olive Oil, the woman who had initially seemed too scatterbrained to take serious notice of him.  It's the familiar story of Homer's ""The Odyssey,"" which is primarily about Odysseus ""homecoming"" rather than his sailing to the Trojan war.  And therein lies the second problem with the movie, which feels overly rushed, abrupt, and unsatisfying in its closure.  In the second half of Homer's narrative, Odysseus  alone will survive and will, after 20 years of  adventurous, frequently harrowing, sailing, touch home soil, where he is challenged to win back his Penelope and restore order to the kingdom of Ithaca.  As good as Altman's ""Popeye"" is, he's made a few ""little"" but critical mistakes that very possibly cost the film both with the Academy and at the box office.  There's enough spectacle, Popeye has all the roguish charm of which Robin Williams is capable, Olive Oil is the cartoon character come to life.  But Altman would have done well to take the ending more seriously.

Had Popeye returned with Olive Oil and SweePea to a harmonious, healed, and more civil Sweetwater than the hostile community he finds at the film's beginning, the viewer would have felt a far greater reward for his investment of 2 hours and Altman's film would have received the critical and popular reception it deserves.  The film clearly deserved better, especially given the performances of Robin Williams and Shelly Duval--and the spot-on directing of Altman for all but the last 5-10 minutes of the movie..  After the sudden insertion of Popeye's ""pop"" in the movie, Waltson's continual muttering and complaining sounds to the viewer like an annoying echo of his grumbling son.  Robin Williams doesn't need doubling (besides, no one can do it!).

But make no mistake.  This is a film worthy of its makers.  To award it less than 5 stars would, in effect, give too much credit to the many films that don't deserve their awards from the Hollywood establishment.  Shame on Hollywood.  After ""Patch Adams"" it's small wonder that citizens are irate about paying higher insurance premiums--for what?  Diseases that can be cured by physicians who deliver prescriptions in the form of red rubber balls placed on their noses?  (Say it isn't so, Robin!)

We are ever closer to the time when we'll need realistic, down-to-earth, genuinely individualist and iconoclastic heroes like Robin Williams' Popeye--strong of will and body (but no pin-up physique or magical powers), and especially inventive when it comes to growing spinach through hydroponics.",1400803200,,7168,5.072402044293015

251996,5,6300213781,"Popeye is like a Pontiac Aztec or an oval design Ford Taurus.  You either love it or hate it.  I get it.  It was supposed to be a loving homage to a childhood cartoon and couldn't decide if it wanted to be a musical, plot driven story, or a character study. It decided to be all three and ended up like cold, canned spinach laced with turmeric on unsalted crackers (please don't try to eat this recipe, I just made it up for hyperbolic effect).

Everything about the movie was done competently, but only the set, costumes and characterizations were remarkable.  Too much time is spent with Bluto growling on camera and not enough time is spent getting Swee'Pea and Olive into and out of dangerous situations, which is what the cartoon was all about.  Turn the sound up and listen to background comments from the townspeople and Popeye's mumblings under his breath.

Most of the musical numbers are sweet, but forgettable, unless Shelley Duvall is carrying them.  She does earnest, gangly, awkward characters so well that she takes limp music and uninspired lyrics and makes it all fit.  Of course Olive Oyl would sing the a song like that in that way!

But the real reason I love this film is that it is a breath of fresh air to see something exaggerated and interesting about ordinary (cartoon) people.  There's no sci-fi, no Godzilla sized monsters (only a regular octopus), and no werewolves or vampires.  They aren't perfect.  They aren't beautiful.  And some of them are ... large.

It is a ""musical"" but none of the songs is even vaguely catchy enough to stick in your mind except in an annoying way. And I do mean annoying. In an attempt to catch some of the ambience of the original cartoon series, the director opted to have characters mutter throughout, creating a constant background of white noise that even managed to annoy my children. Added to characters that are hard to care about is a plot that is virtually nonexistent. Don't waste your time. This movie has now become a threat in our home, as in, ""If you keep complaining, we can always watch Popeye again!"" (""No, Mom, no!"")",1398211200,,681,4.5

252141,2,6300213781,I remember how excited I was when I heard they were making a live action version of Popeye especially with Robin Williams playing the title role. But when I realized that it would be Robert Altman directing I was a little concerned. Time has not been kind to this film as I watched it again for the first time in 34 years. I was struck by what seemed to be a very disjointed film. Granted Altman was known for letting his actor riff freely with just an outline for guidance. And while it does indeed capture the essence of the Popeye cartoons it falls short in story line. This from the same genius who gave us MASH. Too bad since I really like Popeye so I will watch the animate verison and hope that maybe someone will attempt again to bring the world of Popeye to life.,1395878400,,772,4.258503401360544

To say that I could feel my brain melting while it was playing would not be putting it harshly enough.  It really is a horrible movie; the plot is stupid, Bluto, is an idiot, Popeye is over the top; with Olive Oyl the vapid insipidity  is horrid.  Scenes go on too long, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , 5 minutes of Olive's nasal whining is too much  The problem with this movie is that they have tried too hard to stay true to the comic strip but the good thing about the coming strip was it only lasts for 30 seconds.

252405,5,6300213781,"Popeye Bowling for Movies Score 300 of 300

Whaaaat???  A perfect score for this quirky, wacky Altman take on the classic cartoon??  Dude, we sat and talked, and thought, and tore the movie apart - we strained and considered - we crunched the numbers (literally) and hey, the bowling score (which isn't literally a bowling score) is what it is.  We are quirky people, it's true.  We love this movie plain and simple.

For those of you NOT in the ""know"" we are big time into movies... I have HUNDREDS on the shelf - and across the formats - 3D, Blu Ray, DVD, Streaming.  One day we sat down and talked it out - we don't know what our favorite movies are because we have so many and an idea was born - BOWLING FOR MOVIES.  Using a mix of modern technology, true grit, equal parts jelly & pinto beans, and genuine quasi-pseudo-science we watch and score movies.  A middle of the road ""ok"" movie would score out at 108, a very good movie would land a 192 - cross 200 and you've got something outstanding.  To date, I have only score two ""300"" perfect movies - they are rare - and frankly they SHOULD be.  Ok Movie-Dude, get on with it... why a perfect movie?

Listen, let me start by saying I understand we are ""not quite right in the head"" - its part of our charm.  Because we think it's a perfect movie doesn't mean everyone else SHOULD think the same but here is what I have found out.  Some people are good with math - others have a real knack for home dcor - while others still, they just ""get it"" when it comes to karaoke.  We here at the Thomason Clan for Cinematic Goodness, well, we just exude quirky behavior.  It comes as natural to us as swimming does to fish.  Need proof?  I can't touch paper when my hands have been wet for at least 5 minutes.  Certain sounds make my daughter's teeth hurt.  Mrs. Movie Dude can send out 25 complaint letters over poor service at a restaurant in less than a half-hour.  Whew... we know QUIRKY.  It's not something you can learn - like having a sixth toe on your right foot, you either got it or you don't.  This movie displays quirky in all its movie forms and does so wonderfully.

What it's about:
Orphaned squinty-eyed sailor rows into town on the hunt for his long-lost Pappy and finds the family he never had.  Robin Williams transforms from Mork and Mindy funny man into a perfect live-action hero in this Robert Altman gem.  Shelley Duvall was seemingly born to play Olive Oyl, fiance to Captain Bluto (Paul L. Smith) - the iron fisted right arm of the mysterious Commodore (Ray Walston).  What follows is 114 minutes of the most visually stunning cartoon-turned-real life musical extravaganza.  Long before computer animation, Altman used old school movie magic to create the town of Sweethaven which needs to be seen to be believed and populates it with pitch perfect funny-papers inspired characters.

What we LOVE about this movie:
1.  Good golly, Robert Altman was able to pull together a silly cartoon village, complete with wildly fantastical players and manages to run you, the audience, thru every real human emotion imaginable - we laughed, we cried, we felt painfully awkward... expect to sing, chuckle, heck - I even let out a little toot toot of my own (but I think I'm just a little lactose intolerant)
2.  Over the top special effects that draw you into complete fantasy - I have watched this movie hundreds of times since I was little and it still sucks me in, from the first song to the giant octopus launched into the air - and Little Ms. Movie Dude says she was completely impressed that everything on screen was REAL and not just green screened
3.  The songs are infectious - they stick in your head for days, weeks, even months and unlike Barry Manilo's ""Copacabana"" - you don't mind.  I Yam What I Yam, Sweethaven - An Anthem, He's Large, and who could forget Shelley Duvalls perfectly strange (and wonderfully so) rendition of He Needs Me - just to name a few.

What we didn't like:
-  That it under-performed at the box-office - they called it a flop, but I want to set the record straight - it made money, just not as much as was expected.  Ah, um... yup - that's it.

So if you find yourself asking serious questions about this movie or even the review we gave you already have made a mistake.  This movie was (in my opinion) never to be taken seriously in the least.  Its simply a good time.  Well-acted, sumptuously scored, wonderfully costumed, and beautifully captured, this movie begs to be ""I Yam what I Yam"" and what this movie Yam is terrific.

I thought maybe after all these years it might seem better as an adult. My wife has a Maltese background, and was happy to watch it to see scenes from Malta in it where they shot the movie. Even that couldn't keep our interest in this film. How is it Robin Williams can star in this, and yet not be funny? His muttering and growling sounds where just plain irritating. Not as irritating as the songs they kept breaking into tho. There is a good reason why you never hear someone singing or humming tunes from this show... least no one would recognize it anyway. This seems to be Paramount's extremely poor attempt to make a Disney style musical. However, no wonderful musicians where hired to write the songs, as everyone of them is instantly forgettable. Shelly Duvall's screen presence as Popeyes love interest is a joke. Heck, she was sexier in Suburban Commando.

Popeye rows into a town full of quirky people who go out of their way to make it clear they don't like strangers.  Scene after scene consisted of Popeye in the company of noisy people with peculiar habits which was confusing.

It seemed like it was filmed in extra wide screen with most shots from a distance, giving you the feeling you were watching the movie from another room.

Audio was not that good.  Popeye was known to mumble, but it still would have been nice to hear what he said.  Some comments brought a smile, but no laughs.

252516,1,6300213781,"Robin Williams is one of those actors who, as a child and even a teenager, I felt was at the top of the pack.  His breed of humor made me happy.  I grew up on reruns of `Mork and Mindy' and so his face alone is a bit of a nostalgic treat for me.  I remember watching this film, `Popeye', while I was a child with my best friend.  We loved this movie.  Part of me wonders if we ever really watched it or if we didn't just wrestle around while it was playing in the background because I tried watching this movie over the weekend with my kids and no one in our house was pleased.

This movie is terrible.

As an adult I'm slowly growing into my adoration of Robert Altman's career.  He had such a varied and yet very specific resume that really showed a distinct point of view and so you can't help but appreciate his approach to topical subjects.  He created a world where he could express himself beautifully.  The idea of Altman taking Popeye and directing him through a musical seemed off to me in conception and yet seemed like it could have been magnificent.  To be honest, I didn't even remember that this was a musical and so I really doubt that I ever truly watched this as a kid.

It was `Popeye'.  He was cool.  I was at my buddy's house.  Of course I loved it.

The musical numbers are a mixed bag.  The production design is outstanding and fun and the makeup department had a great time recreating the look and feel of the comics and cartoon.  Shelley Duvall is also kind of magnificent here; a complete and total fleshly reincarnation of Olive Oyl.  That said, Williams' mumbling is annoying and worse yet, Altman's style is just NOT a good fit for the material.  It comes across as dull and tiresome.  I wanted to love this.  I wanted my kids to love this.  I wanted this to be as good as I remembered it to be but it wasn't; not at all.",1368489600,3,1850,4.2079772079772075

Along the lines of ""Hook"" (starring Robin williams), this movie is a visual comedy/drama. Just an FYI, this movie is part musical, too, for it contains over 6 songs sung by the cast. Paramount did a great job casting the actors for the all too familiar roles of Popeye, Olive Oyl, etc...There are just a few ""harsh"" language words in the movie to be aware of and a few cartoon-style brawls that provide the limited violence in this ""PG"" movie. Pay close attention to the multiple, mumbled quotes by Popeye (Robin Williams) throughout the movie; some of the quotes, which I wouldn't be surprised if they were ""ad-libbed"" are classic! My favorite is, ""Oh what am I? Some kind of barnicle on the dinghy of life?""

252598,5,6300213781,"Popeye is such a strange film, and yet it's one of my family's all time favorites. Critics hated it, but I am very pleased to know that the film has grown into a cult-favorite over the years. I find myself watching this movie over and over again and discovering hilarious new things about it every time. I had an in-law over recently who speaks English as a second language, and just turning the subtitles on made me aware of tons of hilarious new jokes that I had missed before-- particularly the witty political themes of the opening musical number (the Sweethaven National Anthem).

Robin Williams is Popeye. He was hardly a superstar when this film was made, but I consider this to be one of his best roles. Through the magic of makeup he really does look as if Popeye stepped off of an animation cell and into the real world, and his characterization is spot on. He mutters hilarious little comments throughout the film, and every time you watch you'll probably find yourself picking up new ones. He truly brings to life the tough, witty, ruffian sailor who finds himself passing through a secluded and unfriendly island town, and charms his way into the hearts of its citizenry. He's an unlikely hero who spouts the wisdom of the common man, and isn't afraid to use his fists when the time calls for it. I honestly can't think of any other actor who could pull off the role as brilliantly as Williams does here.

The rest of the cast, likewise are picture perfect counterparts to their pen and ink versions, especially Shelly Duvall as Olive Oyle. Like Williams, she is a perfect re-creation of the cartoon version, bringing to life every one of Olive's awkward mannersisms while still managing to be strangely charming, and she also gets in quite a few endearing musical numbers. Pretty much everyone is cast perfectly, and they all manage to make it feel like you are watching the world of the cartoon as it would have existed in real life.

This movie isn't for everyone, but if you are the type who likes quirky comedies, musicals that value humor and wit over grandiose and spectacle, or you're just a huge Popeye fan, this movie will wrestle its way into your heart just like it did mine. It's one of the few cartoon adaptations on film I've seen where I can honestly look at it, and say it does full justice to the source material. This is a great family movie that stands the test of time.",1361232000,,2403,4.5707656612529

Robin Williams has said he didn't care for this roll but I like it as one of his best.  I think these rolls were difficult to play but all the characters ,I thought, brought the cartoon comic strip to life in away that I think is really superior.

252731,3,6300213781,"***This review may contain spoilers**

Paradoxically, many people pan movies because of what they are not rather than what they are.  When Robert Altman's ""Popeye"" was announced back in the late '70s/early '80s, I imagine many people (and many kids) thought, ""Oh, boy, we're gonna get a Popeye adventure like ""Popeye Meets Sinbad the Sailor"" or ""Popeye Meets Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves"". He'll punch out monsters, eat spinach, fight the villain, save Olive (and sometimes Wimpy).  It's gonna be lots of fun."" Therefore, when Altman's ""Popeye"" hit the screen, there was a collective ""Whaaa? Is this a joke?  Where are the freaks and monsters? Where's the escalating Popeye/Bluto rivalry?  Where's the action?  This sucks!""  Altman and his ""Popeye"" version don't quite roll that way.

Instead, the late director of ensemble family drama reached back before the '60s/'70s Popeye cartoons to the Thimble Theatre comic strips, brought THAT Popeye and his grotesque contemporaries to life, and decided to make a choreographed family musical drama revolving around Popeye's (Robin Williams's) search for his peregrinating papa.  His search brings him to the ramshackle seaside village of Sweethaven, where the wacky populace is too distracted to pay too much attention to him.  He takes lodging with the Oyl family, whose gaunt, shrill, ungainly Olive (Shelly Duval) has been betrothed to the imposing village enforcer Bluto (Paul Smith).  Somehow Popeye and Olive cross paths and confide in each other, with Olive confessing she has cold feet about her impending marriage.  They also stumble upon an abandoned baby; the adoring Popeye decides to name him Swee'pea (Wesley Ivan Hurt).  Bluto, along with the nervous townsfolk, await Olive.  When Popeye and Olive return to her home with Swee'pea, the infuriated Bluto sees them together and, misunderstanding, smashes Popeye through a dock and demolishes the Oyl home.

To raise money to restore their home, Olive's chubby brother Castor (Donovan Scott) hesitantly agrees to box the mountainous Oxblood Oxheart (Peter Bray) for the cash prize.  The Oyl family, with Popeye, witness the ""illegal"" fight and Castor's beating. Popeye leaps into the ring, takes care of the bruiser and wins the prize - and the beginning of Olive's affections.  When Popeye shoves the insufferable taxman (Donald Moffat) into the harbor, he wins the whole town's gratitude and Olive's fickle heart at last.

Everything's not hunky-dory yet.  Swee'pea has prognostication skills and can see the future.  Wimpy (Paul Dooley) kidnaps him to help him bet on the horse races.  At length, Bluto hears of the child prodigy and appropriates Swee'pea to bring to the mysterious, reclusive Commodore (Ray Walston), the true village leader.  Incensed at the kidnapping, Popeye follows the trail to the Commodore's boat and happily discovers that the Commodore is Poopdeck Pappy, his long-lost father.  Poopdeck is less than thrilled to see his son, whom he considers a sissy especially since - gasp! - he hates spinach, the vegetable that has kept his family strong for so long.

However, their differences must be set aside as Bluto, along with Swee'pea, absconds with Olive and Poopdeck and sets sail for the open sea, with Popeye in pursuit.  An underwater octopus seizes Olive and allows Popeye to catch up.  After Popeye and Bluto tangle and Bluto force-feeds Popeye the yucky spinach, Popeye knocks out both the octopus and Bluto, with Bluto turning yellow and swimming away for dear life.  Popeye rescues Swee'pea, Olive, and Poopdeck, everyone sings the ""Popeye the Sailor Man"" theme song, and the movie ends.

I, too, must admit that Altman's ""Popeye"" confounded my expectations, too.  But I gradually appreciated the movie's purpose - to provide a mixture of comedy and drama, some musical interludes, some rousing but exaggerated fight scenes, some of William's risque, ad-libbed mutterings for the sailor man, some of Olive's clumsy, willful motivations, and the overall depiction of an outlandish cartoon community come to life.  Is the movie successful?  To a considerable but not complete degree yes, though it has its inert spots and that unforgivable revelation that Popeye hates spinach.  Superman might as well be invulnerable to Kryptonite.  Nevertheless, Altman and Williams should not have disowned their ""Popeye"".  It showcases the sailor man well, especially when it shows that the pugnacious Popeye, through Swee'pea and the search for his father, still has a kind, just, caring heart.

Williams and Duvall are so perfectly cast it's jaw-dropping.  It's a tale of Odyssean proportions, Shakespearean drama, wrapped up in a Jungian pipedream smothered in existentialist sauce...Williams swinging around like a Neandertal Fred Astaire singing ""I am what I am"" at a feaux race-track where they run mechanical horses in a dreamlike stage of a seaside town somewhere in a tropical Mid-Atlantic hallucination is the most perfect three minutes of film since Coppolla's baptism scene in the Godfather.

In playing Popeye, Robin William's manic energy finds a proper outlet in a character who is even more outrageously eccentric and over-the-top than Williams himself!

Robin Williams is great as Popeye and Shelly Duvall is great as Olive Oyl, the whole cast was well done.  I bought the movie itself at Wal-Mart, I think.  But I just purchased the soundtrack from Amazon.  I have been looking for the soundtrack ever since I watched the movie, when I was younger.  The music and the songs are nice to listen to.  Although there is one song on the track that I don't recognize and that I don't remember from the movie.  Robin Williams had Popeye down cold, from his squinky eye to his ""pronunciation"".  I wish there could have been more fight scenes between Bluto and Popeye, but Popeye still gets him at the end.  What do you expect from a cartoon that becomes a full-length feature film?  Nothing will replace the actual cartoon of Popeye, but this movie was fun to watch.  Robin Williams might always be known as Mork, but some people might remember him as Popeye, as well.  With all the cartoons that are turning into movies, today, POPEYE was probably one of the first.  Back when there was no digital effects or computer animation.  A Real Movie!!

252793,2,6300213781,"Ha ha ha ha... another Robert Altman film, this one is another strange departure from a man who has left no genre untouched (McCabe & Mrs Miller was a cowboy film from an unlikely western director, this is an unlikely comic book adaptation). Altman goes for surreality every chance he can get, and has a surreal Sweethaven set built for his grotesque characters. Robin Williams is unrecognizable as Popeye (his first starring role, actually, and he mumbles his way through it), but Shelley Duvall is having the time of her life in the part that she was born to play (someone as skinny as her could not be turned down as Olive Oyl - in fact, you'd think that Altman custom-made the film for her, considering how often he used her in his films). With the hero drifting into town in the opening scenes, the film is reminiscent of many of Altman's most famous films (M*A*S*H, McCabe & Mrs Miller), but it is nowhere near as good. The while film is the colour of mud, and none of the characters are memorable. Bluto is a brute-o, but we've seen that before. The only memorable bit is Popeye at the end of the movie dancing on the water. But it's okay - I've tolerated plenty of slow-moving stylistic films by well-known masters of the film arts.

This individual must not know ANYTHING about filmmaking. First of all, Robert Altman is no amateur, even when he made this film. Secondly, to coordinate and pull off a movie like this is an incredible feat. It's a grand production on every level. And the fact that my girlfriend's 6-year old can appreciate it (and in fact, love it) all these years later is testament to its achievement.

Is it a profound movie? No. My God, man, it's a movie about Popeye the Sailor! But I guarantee you it's the best live action movie about Popeye that could ever be conceived, let alone actually made.

252827,5,6300213781,"I've liked this movie since i was a kid.  My aunt recorded it on VHS in the mid 80s and gave it to me.  I think she and I were the only ones in our family who liked it, until my brother got into it too.  My aunt's favorite scene is Olive singing ""He Needs Me"".  We always got a kick out of this film---there are many funny moments throughout.  It's also sort of touching at times.  I like that it is a musical, live-action cartoon.  It's unusual.  But I grew up with it and I'm used to the oddness of it,  It's based off a cartoon, so, I guess it's to be expected that it would be weird.  There is just something about it that is entertaining.

A lot of people don't like the movie.  My parents never cared for it and still don't.  I think one of the reasons why some people don't care for the movie is that it isn't very pretty visually, except for the water.  The buildings are run down, the clothes are cartoonish, but that's the way it's meant to be.  I've never been a huge Popeye fan, but I did watch the cartoon sometimes as a kid.  The movie is as good of a live-action version as I can imagine one would be.  I actually like the movie a lot more than the cartoons.  Safe for family viewing, too.

Someone in my family must have really liked the songs, because I found the LP in our house years ago though no one will admit to buying it.  My favorite song in the movie, Everything is Food, was actually left off the soundtrack for some inexplicable reason (and a song that was cut from the film was left on the soundtrack).

I really don't know what I would think of this movie if I saw it as an adult for the first time.  But unlike some things from childhood that I outgrew, this still holds up for me as an unusual and entertaining film.  Less than a year ago, I got out the dvd and played it when my aunt was visiting.  We watched the entire thing and liked it.

If you have the older dvd, this one just has a new cover.  There is nothing added to the disc.  I have both.  It would have been nice to have bonus features but certainly not expected given that a lot of people don't care for the movie, including Robin Williams.

If you can find enjoyment in critically panned movies such as The Wiz, you can find corny enjoyment in this relatively same plateau of a production with catchy songs, and memorable characters.
Distance yourself from cartoon which it's based, and think of it as a real life community of oddball people with their own rules for living.
There was a lot of work drawn on this production and it's not second rate including sets, music, costumes, and performance. It actually has tender moments from the transition of Popeye being the lone outcast to olive oyl discovering her love for this man soon after they find sweet pea lost in a basket.
And its that chemistry which pulls the movies weight. Anyone trying to find valid connection between this and animated cartoons will be as lost as precious sweet pea who manages to find a true loving family.",1305676800,,1050,4.774725274725275
252829,4,6300213781,"Maybe it's apt that Robin Williams, himself a real-life cartoon character, for his first film would take on the role of another cartoon figure. POPEYE, Roger Altman's hybrid musical comedy / character indulgence piece, is a weird movie. I could see how viewers could be turned off, because the thing moves at a glacial pace. So, factoring that in, what are the selling points?

For one, Roger Altman treats the source with affection, keeps faith with it, laughs with it, not at it. The production design is fairly stunning. The harbor village of Sweethaven is richly realized, and the first time I saw the movie, I simply had to soak in the curious street angles and the drunkenly tilted edifices and the eccentric characters populating them. You sense an energy in the crowd of folks negotiating these streets, as if each extra has a purpose, as if Altman had gone up to each background actor and given him and her an individual backstory. No wonder Popeye, having just rowed into Sweethaven, has on this bemused expression (and it's hard to express bemusement with one eye in a perpetual wink). There's a lot going on in every scene, not all of it relevant to the plot, except that all this minutiae serves to anchor believability.

The catalyst to the tale hinges on Popeye's many years quest to find his pappy, and from there the film develops in its own leisurely pace. One by one, we meet the main participants: the bullying Captain Bluto (Paul L. Smith), the hamburger savaging Wimpy, the cute abandoned baby Swee' Pea... and somewhere here (or isn't here) is the gent what rules the roost, the mysterious Commodore in whose absence Captain Bluto runs the town. So that's the pecking order. One more key sub-plot is that Bluto fancies Olive Oyl who, in turn, fancies Bluto back to the extent that, on their wedding day, she packs a bag and sneaks out of the casa. It's enough to make steam whistle out a scary sea captain's ears.

If you like cartoon violence, you gots it, pal. When it comes to brawling, Popeye and Bluto are masters of disaster, and Altman revives the over-the-top, gravity defying, literally corkscrewing of fists stuff that you see in the Popeye cartoons. I think Popeye's beating the stuffing out of an octopus monster says it all. Robin Williams, gigged out in corncob pipe and wrists shaped like bowling pin, well inhabits his role. Williams' talent for mimicry is on full display as he does justice to the sailor man's mangled pronunktiation and those muttered asides that you have to rewind a bunch of times to really appreciate.

Equally crucial is Shelley Duvall's performance. Duvall, lanky and ungainly, is tailor made for the part. She brings a certain endearing clumsy grace to Olive Oyl - which is exactly how Olive Oyl should be played.

I like that the songs - remember, this is a musical, as well - serve to advance the plot. Not that I liked all the numbers. I thought the introductory ""Sweethaven"" song is great in establishing the fishing village setting and its peculiar populace. I liked Paul L. Smith's sullen ""I'm Mean"" and Duvall's tongue-in-cheek ode to Bluto, ""He's Large."" And Robin Williams growls out ""I Yam What I Yam"" with a certain conviction. I wasn't feeling the other songs.

Robert Altman navigates to the beat of his own drum, and you either roll with his film-making style or you tune out. There's a self-indulgent element in this movie, and you may wish for things to just get a move on. You have to get in a certain mind-set, allow for patience. There's a reward in it. You see Williams and Duvall sinking even more into character. There's always stuff going on in the corners of the scenes. The film - thru distinctive set design and atmosphere and, yes, pace - establishes its own reality, one in which a one-eyed sailor can perform extraordinary feats by chomping on spinach. Even if, starting out, Popeye professes a distaste for the yucky green leaf. But spinach, like this film, has its benefits.

This DVD is from the ""I Love the 80's"" banner and, as such, offers these following extras: .... friggin' nuthin'! No extras at all. I got steam whistling out my own ears.",1303516800,3,4141,4.719225449515906

Naturally, I (and many others, apparently) love the film for almost the exact same reasons.

With Popeye, Altman successfully interprets a character already done successfully by E.C. Segar (who did the comic strip) and the Fleischer Brothers (who did the cartoon). Robin Williams effortlessly inhabits the iconic role - as do all the other actors! Most cartoon films are hobbled by actors trying too hard to act cartoony (see Looney Tunes: Back in Action), but in this they make walking around as Wimpy and Olive Oyl and Poopdeck Pappy seem entirely natural.",1302393600,2,913,5.120805369127517

So overall I had no memory of the whole film except that Robin Williams played popeye and he fought Bluto. Apparently even at 10 years old I had little tolerance for the rest of the mess, so if I had actually watched the entire movie, I blocked it from memory.

I'll start off with what this movie is not:  the mature comic brilliance of ""MASH"".  Although coming only ten years after Robert Altman's famed antiwar classic, ""Popeye"" is a completely different kind of comedy.

It is one with roots in a 1930's-era comic strip and black-and-white cartoon and director Altman deftly references that heritage through the look and style of this movie.  Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall both superbly play Popeye and Olive Oyl, respectively.  The rest of the cast sparkles, as well.

The casting of Williams and Duvall was good (the only movie I ever thought Shelly Duvall was ever well cast for, FWIW) but that's about the only positive I can think of. Almost EVERY other aspect of this movie STANK. One to be avoided at all costs as far as I'm concerned.",1235001600,,413,4.175
252918,4,6300213781,"This is actually a better musical than we might expect it to be. This musical has the interesting task of introducing us to characters we probably already know from the cartoon, but somehow (probably through the great acting of Williams, Duvall, Dooley, etc), we get the impression that we are just meeting these characters.

Popeye sales into Sweet Haven. He finds the town to be clannish and unfriendly, but he does find a room for rent with the Oyls. We see that Olive's mother is a little nicer than the rest of the people in town. Olive herself comes on the scene, and we see the hilarious love/hate relationship between Popeye and Olive starting up. We then meet Olive's father, and her brother as well as Wimpy. Olive is talking about her engagement to Bluto, but somehow we see that there are problems in their relationship.

Popeye and Olive later chat, and we see that Popeye is looking for his father. We don't know this yet, but we have been hearing about his father, and he has run into a clue of his presence in Sweet Haven. Popeye and Olive run into Sweepea, and Bluto assumes that Popeye and Olive are Sweepea's parents. (This of course breaks Olive's engagement as well as the 'tax breaks' her parents were getting.)

Popeye through a hilarious boxing match offers them some financial relief, but he can not agree to further gambling at the tracks. In a surprisingly well coordinated set of events, he has a falling out with Olive, accidentally goes from being the 'stranger in town' to the newest hero in town, loses Sweepea, and finds his father.

Without going on too much longer, Bluto kidnaps Olive, and there is a hilarious chase as Popeye and his father, along with Olive's family try to save Olive. By the way, Olive is not exactly a silent hostage, and this only adds to the comedy. During the chase, Popeye and his father argue, and we hear a HILARIOUS passage on children. Without ruining the ending, Popeye's father has a part in saving the day, by giving Popeye some 'fatherly advice.'

Overall, it's a great musical with comedy, suspense, some really touching moments, and of course great music.

 I had known of this film for a long time but did not realize it was a musical, nor that it was so entertaining. Most of the music was done in short segments and the songs were decent. None were excellent, but none were awful, either.

Popeye was fun to hear. Robin Williams had the famous sailor's mumbling down to a tee. I suggest you watch this with the English subtitles on so you can get all of what Popeye says, or you'll miss a lot of funny lines. The same can almost be said of Shelly Duvall's impersonation of ""Olive Oyl,"" although you can understand her better. She, too, was fun to watch. I read somewhere that she was very depressed over her performance in this film, but she shouldn't have been. She was perfect for the role.

I didn't think the supporting characters were much, such as Bluto or Wimpy, but Popeye's dad, ""Poopdeck Pappy,"" (Ray Walston) who appears late in the film is a real hoot. ""Pappy"" adds a lot of spark and energy to the film, just when it was really needed.

Overall, it's a nice, pleasing type of film. It's no award-winner, but it's a lot better than what you might have read from national critics. If you like Popeye's cartoons and comics, you should like this film, too. I would gladly watch this again.",1227398400,3,1286,4.390756302521009

But it's the confrontations with the tough Bluto (Paul L. Smith) that will define the life of the Sailor Man.

Staring Robin Williams in his first feature film, ""Popeye"" brings the sailor back to his roots.  Taking place in the fictional town of Sweethaven, Popeye sets out to find is long lost Pappy (Ray Walston).  Along the way he meets Olive, (a very convincing performance given by Shelley Duvall),her family, adopts little Swee'Pee and makes an enemy out of Captain Bluto (Paul L. Smith).

Many critics panned this movie...but by no means was it a ""flop"" as it is claimed to be.  The movie made back double it's money and left an impression on the much younger generation.  Even though the cast and crew may have gone through hell making ""Popeye,"" it has gained a considerable following throughout the years and to some, is a success beyond what any hollywood critic could understand.

Light-hearted and fun...kids are sure to love this movie just as much as they love the cartoons.

The profits were pretty good but poor word of mouth and some savage reviews caused it to vanish from theaters after just a few weeks of its release. It also hurt director Robert Altman's career for several years after. So what went wrong? The movie is Popeye... the Musical. Let that sink in. A musical.... with Popeye. But here's the thing, the movie is extraordinarily well done. In fact it is a near cinematic masterpiece. I'm serious. Don't laugh.

From the casting to the costumes to the set design to the decision to base the movie on the original Thimble Theater comics rather than the cartoon version, this movie nails it. It has all the obscure characters including Rough House, Castor Oil and even super obscure ones like Ham Gravy (although you have to read the closing credits to catch many of them). Popeye was truly a labor of love not just an attempt to cash in. Popeye himself is dramatically toned down from the cartoon version which was already a watered down version of the Thimble Theater Popeye. Robin Williams Popeye is a simple, sweet hearted sailor who just happens to be talented with his fists. The original Popeye was a foul mouthed, gambling addicted, violent brute with a preternatural ability to deliver earth shattering punches. I like the Williams Popeye, I like the Thimble Theater Popeye, they just aren't the same character. This movie is clearly aimed squarely at the pre-teen audience (not that it isn't fun for the rest of us too).

One of the things that people have been critical of this movie for is the music. I couldn't disagree more. I love the songs and I'm no great fan of musicals. The only song that didn't do it for me was a duet between Popeye and Olive over the future of Swee'pea. That one was actually removed for the TV version for good reason but it's here in the DVD. Besides that one clunker the songs are great. ""I'm Mean"", ""I Yam What I Yam"", ""Sweethaven"" and ""Everything is Food"" stand out as my favorite songs.

Popeye's place in the public's collective consciousness has dipped considerably since I was young which is a shame because he is such an interesting and unique character. On the other hand this is a great time for Popeye fans with the release of the original Segar comics by Fantagraphics and the black and white Fleicher cartoons from Warner Home Video. Both of these are well done productions. If I had one complaint about this DVD it would be the anemic extras. There are a bunch of great back-stories to this movie that should have been added as extras including the fact that it's the first film featuring Robin Williams and the mind blowing set built on the island of Malta that exists to this day.

It takes me back like the Superman, Batman, et cetera movies never could. You see, they were made to relate to a modern audience...one who never saw the originals.  Popeye was not meant for the young movie crowd of today, however some of you do ""get it"", but was made for people of my age...to take us back to the 50's and earlier.

We ""get it"".  We understand about the lack of identifiable plot...it perfectly mimics the cartoons of my childhood.  We understand that the songs were only snippets...the short ditties and song snippets were all a young child would sit still for back in those days.

No one but Robin Williams could have played Popeye. No one but Shelley Duvall could have played Olive Oyl.  The entire cast takes me back to a time when life was simple...not perfect, but simple.

Call me an ""old school"" person for I don't care.  I love this movie.  I have it both on VHS (copied from HBO) and on DvD; and whenever it is shown on TV, I watch it.

252985,5,6300213781,"Sure, POPEYE doesn't fulfill conventional expectations, but Altman chose (perhaps as a snarky contrarian to Disney and Paramount, his financiers) to deliberately produce a film that retained the context of the original Segar cartoons and the Dada antics of the Fleischer cartoons at the expense of making a fun, forgetful, and irrelevant cookie-cutter film for the whole family.

Jules Feiffer, the film's screenwriter and one of the great keepers of the Segar/Popeye flame (and someone who understands the iconic value of Popeye better than anyone I can think of), thought Altman restored the spirit of Segar's original strips, saving it, effectively, from the decades of mainstream mediocrity that Popeye suffered from, largely as a result of the patriotic exploitation of the character in the wake of World War II.

I watch and greatly appreciate this film for what Altman is doing with the Popeye ""legend,'"" and not for its (lack of) entertainment value (which, ipso facto, makes me an ""Altman apologist.""  Yeah, right.  Whatever).

Let's put one ignorant myth to rest, shall we?  POPEYE was not a bomb.  This tall tale was promulgated by a few egomaniacs in the industry who wanted to bury both the film and Altman's career.  It did have a problematic production history, as did dozens of films from this era, a time when the studios were going through a major upheaval and wound up playing it extremely safe in the 1980s.  Altman (along with nearly all of the great or at least interesting auteurs of the 1970s) became persona non grata practically overnight.

Some accolades must go to the set designers,costume designers and, of course, Malta for beautiful scenery.

I saw this movie in 1980 with a group of friends, anxious to see the same wit & spirit of MASH applied to the Popeye cartoon world.  I had to argue to everyone to stay for the entire stultifying mess.

I couldn't find anything here to please anyone.

Kids will be bored.  Adults will be frustrated.  Although the cast tries hard and the production values and scenery are topnotch, this movie just LAYS THERE.  By the end, I was wondering, ""What exactly is Altman rubbing our faces in?  Only Ken Russell could gleefully hoodwink the moviegoing public with a lame offering worse than POPEYE.""

I don't believe that it's been a national tragedy that Robert Altman never won the Best Director from the Academy Awards.  For every NASHVILLE, there was a POPEYE.  For every MASH, there was O.C. AND STIGGS (how many of you have even heard of that one?  What does that tell you?).  When I read that Altman openly mocked Louise Fletcher's sign-language acceptance speech at the Oscars to her face (she was signing her love and thanks to her deaf parents after her win for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST), I pretty much thought Altman was just another ego-driven jerk and honestly lost interest in his career.

I remember seeing this film as a kid and LOVING it! I had grown up watching Popeye cartoons and seeing it in live-action was amazing. Even as an adult (27 years later) I still love this movie. I will NEVER understand why it gets bashed by movie-goers AND the people involved in creating it.

Robin Williams IS Popeye in the flesh. If for no other reason, watch this film just for his performance. No other single actor could have portrayed Popeye more perfectly. From the constant muttering and butchering of the English language right down to the squinting eye, Williams had it DOWN PAT.

And why do people bash the soundtrack? The songs, although a bit odd (most of the lyrics don't rhyme, but so what?!?!?!), were extremely memorable. When I was a kid, I had the soundtrack on vinyl and damn near wore it out.

The story is a bit simplistic, but one should not watch this film expecting and earth-shattering plot or Academy-caliber acting. The characters and situations were based on a CARTOON for God's sake! Take this movie for what it is; a live version of a cartoon feature. And don't forget; there's a moral to the story. The moral is:

Kids, eat your green vegetables so you can be big and strong!

Watch this with your kids or watch it alone. It doesn't matter. You'll have fun either way.

In the beginning of this movie, an animated Popeye appears and said "" I think I am in the wrong movie"" I think he is right

Popeye is a yuppie's version Paint Your Wagon, the worst musical ever made. This is Robin Willians's first film. In my opinion, this is  Robert Altman's worst (one would have wished he did a director commentary to give better insight  which he didnt). This so called musical, written by  cartoonist and Popeye fan Jules Feiffer. This lackluster tunes make this live action toon  falls  with sour notes of a bad musical

The harbor town of Sweethaven looks like  a revamped Segarville from Popeye's comics. However the sets looks like sets from Altman's McCabe and Mrs Miller

Williams has his popeye mutter down and loses his Mork from Ork performance, but he cant sing..especially in his Popeye voice. The most perfectly cast in this production is Shelley DuVall as Olive Oil

Altman needed a tighter rein on this film and its cast who crowds into frames of film . It seems more like an overcrowded  carnival atmosphere rather than Popeye's search for his father (Ray Walston).

The two stars areWwilliams who tries and Duvall that becomes Popeye and Olive Oil

253031,4,6300213781,"Opinions are like noses: everyone has one. Some like it, some don't. Let me say this, however, in defense of this 1980 movie starring Robin Williams as Popeye. It is certainly unfair to say, by any stretch, that this is 'the worst movie of all-time', or 'one of the worst...'. It is funny how, at the time of this writing, that the average vote for this film is about 4.5 stars...Actually that is about right. For those who do not know about the wonderful website called The Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com), you really need to check it out. [...] My point is this: There are many opinions. So if you have never seen this movie, decide for yourself. Do you remember the incredible muttering Popeye (done by Jack Mercer on the cartoons)?. I'm talking especially about the early Fleischer Studios Popeye cartoons from the 30's. You know, the ones in black-and-white. That's what I loved the most, the muttering Popeye. Well, Robin Williams does it superbly! Also, Shelly Duvall is excellent as Olive Oyl in this movie. Granted, the story is kind of bland. The music is not always top notch. Yes, it is too long. However, I enjoyed watching Robin Williams' masterful portrayal of everyone's favorite Sailor Man. Sure, Olive can get a little annoying at times, but wasn't she basically that way in the cartoons? So if you loved the muttering Popeye, then you'll love the movie, overall. Never mind the story. The storyline doesn't really matter, I feel. But, alas, you say you cannot really remember those vintage Popeye cartoon shorts too well. Not to worry! They are scheduled to be released on DVD... FULLY RESTORED!!! Volume 1 (1933 - 1938), with a July 2007 scheduled release, will have, in my opinion, the very best of all the 230 total Popeye cartoon shorts. (Incidently, William Costello provided Popeye's voice from 1933 until sometime in 1935. He was very good also, but the really GREAT muttering came when Jack Mercer took over in 1935). By all means, if you are a huge Popeye fan like myself, then you absolutely must get these DVDs. After listening to the great Jack Mercer, and watching the incredible animation in those early years, then compare Popeye to Robin Williams' version. I dare say, you will see the similarity. So, the bottom line is: See for yourself. If you love Popeye, the character, then you will not be disappointed with Robin Williams' performance. The movie itself... well, you be the judge. Likely you have a nose, so without a doubt you, too will have an opinion. It's ALL alright.",1176854400,3,2516,4.772935779816514

253035,4,6300213781,"For Robin Williams first movie, he chose the Iconic character of Popeye The Sailor to portray.  I rememer the hooflaw surrounding this flick when I was a kid (I was like 10 when this came out) and the success of Mork & Mindy had put Williams in the spotlight.  The only problem was that Popeye is not as Iconic a character as the people who made this movie thought.  He isn't Superman.  He isn't Batman.  He isn't Mickey Mouse.  Popeye the cartoon character, though classic and kid-pleasing, just wasn't that popular with the chidren and the fact that they made it into a musical probably didn't help much either.  Though the film was mildly-successful, it never hit as hard as people expected.  The good thing, however, is that Robert Altman (M*A*S*H, Short Cuts) directed, so Popeye as a whole is visually masterful.  The actors were perfect for their parts. Shelley Duvall's Olive Oyl is without a doubt one of the best acting casts in history!  Bluto comes to life as does Wimpy and Popeye's wayward Pappy (Ray Walston).  All in all the shining star is, of course, Williams.  Here he proved that he wasn't just a stand-up comedian turned actor, here he proves that he wasn't just a catch-phrase spewing flash-in-the-pan sensation (Na-Nu Na-Nu!). He shows a depth of character and a sense of timing that actually brings the one-eyed Sailor Man to life.  Filled with grumbling, clever, obiviously improvised quips, Williams becomes Popeye to an alarming degree.

The story line is simple,  Popeye rows into the harbor of Sweethaven looking for his long lost Pappy and is immediately hailed as a stranger and an outcast by the over-the-top weirdos that inhabit the sleepy little seaside villiage.  Taxes in Sweethaven have been imposed on everything by the unseen Commodore, using Captain Bluto as his enforcer.  The Oyl family is spared these crushing taxes because daughter Olive is getting engaged to the overbearing tyrant Bluto.  But Olive despairs and plans to run away on the night of their engagement party.  Popeye, who as been renting a room from the Oyls, runs into the departing Olive on the docks.  After coming to some kind of understanding that life isn't always what we expected, Olive's wicker carryall is replaced with one contining a clairvoyant baby. As the two return to the scene of the destroyed engagement party, Bluto sees Olive and Popeye and Sweatpea and goes beserk! Cartoon-style fighting ensues.

Overall, the movie will entertain you and your kids.  It will probably never be one of your all time favorites, at least I hope not, but it is clever and witty and just fun to watch.  Nonsensical in many ways, Popeye let's us forget about being serious for a while and enjoy the simple pleasures of fantasy movie-making.

The costumes, sets, and props used in the movie were perfect for the slap-stick cartoon feel for which the story was aimed.  The colors were at both vibrant and subdued.  The clothes were bright, bringing the characters to a sort of technicolor life; however, the scenery, the buildings, and the props were austere.  The effect was truly magnificent as it took an unbelievable prop town and made it part of the story to such an extent that you do not notice it until the end.

For anybody that ever watched Popeye the cartoon, Robin Williams did an excellent job in recreating the scruffy and lovable sailor.  Williams was able to project when required by the story, be subtle when need be, and to do slap-stick comedy as if he were born to it.  Shelley Duvall was equally brilliant in bringing Olive Oil to life.  It could not have been easy to recreate the gangly grace displayed in her cartoon counterpart; however, she did so with dignity and a style that befitted the occasion.  And who can forget the singsong lyrics of Paul L. Smith's ""Bluto"": ""I'm mean, I'm mean, I'm mean, I'm so d#@m mean...""  Throw in excellent support from Ray Walston, Linda Hunt, and Paul Dooley and you have a cast that's meant for their roles!

In fact, it is somewhat disorienting at first; as with any genre film that Altman helms, it is a deconstruction of the original. For one, ""Popeye"" doesn't like spinach. Anyway, he has found in Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall the perfect incarnations of Popeye and Olive Oyl. For once Williams's worst traits -- maudlin sentimentality that begs the audience to love him -- is kept in check. And Duvall --whatever happened to her?!!!-- is simply adorable and touching. But as far as I am concerned, the world Altman has created on the island of Malta is amazing. The set decorations and the feel of the photography are like none I have ever seen before or since--a combination of the cartoonish and the natural that really grows on you. Which is much like the film: it grows better as it goes along despite the music, which is not about to leave anyone humming after the lights come up.

So many people I know just don't get it and I can only imagine so many reviewers didn't get it either.  It has nothing to do with intelligence or intellect, it has something to do with the sweet subtleties of the subject.

Popeye is the pinnacle of morality in a cartoon character.  The man is a saint and that's what I have loved about him since when I first watched the cartoons back in the 70's.  I noticed he was one of the few characters that didn't have a large flaw or a kind of a devlish side to him.

253112,4,6300213781,"The last 3 decades of the 20th century and the 1st decade of the 21st century have seen Hollywood convert numerous comic book strips and cartoons into live-action movies.  The list includes Superman, Batman, X-men, Scooby-doo, Spiderman, Avengers, the Hulk, and now Popeye.  Released in the late 1970s by Robert Altman, this is probably one of the least-succesful (commercially) adaptations of a popular comic-strip.  Opening to mixed-reviews, the movie was rumored to have strained the mental state of Shelley Duvall, the lead actress, and of course there was never a sequel.

Given all of its public failings, this is a great movie and a careful watching reveals the care and love that went into making it.  First and foremost, this movie is incredibly true to the comic strip.  The dialogue, the accents, the setting of Sweathaven, the clothings, and the storyline all ring true.  Second, the music is quite unique.  One quite cannot classify the songs.  They are neither dramatic like in Evita, snazzy like in Chicago, romantic like in Lion King, nor pure comedic like Robin William's songs in Aladdin.  Instead, they are some combination of melodrama and comedy, witty but not sarcastic, ironic but not insane.  Third, the choreography is great.  From the boxing scenes with Popeye to the walking styles of the various characters, each movement and motion was nuanced to create a world onto its own.  Fourth, the turn of events throughout the story is quite unpredictable, yet stays true to the comic strip.  For example, Pluto gets the best of Popeye and Olive while working for Popeye's dad until the very end.  The former follows the comic strip and cartoons, while the latter twist is an Altman creation and wholly unforseen.  Last, this movie is an incredible character study by Robin Williams.  Watching this, you realize that only Robin Williams could have pulled of this role, just like Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, Gene Wilder in Willy Wonka, and Eddie Murphy in the Nutty Professor.  Being the first major movie by Robin Williams, this probably proved to the world that he could do any role put before him.

The DVD itself is preferable over watching the movie on TV for one specific reason; the dialogue.  Altman made this movie as true as possible, which means many of the words are quite incomprehensible to many viewers who are not familiar with the Popeye cartoons.  With subtitles possible with a DVD, you can truly understand all the ironies, intricacies, and inanity in the story.  Unfortunately, the DVD does not contain any commentaries on how the movie was made.  For this, I give it 4 out of 5 instead of 5 out of 5 stars.",1148169600,4,2661,4.877505567928731

I get everything, from the latest blockbuster to the obscure flops to the 1950's cinema serials (which means having to buy copies from ebay... hey, it's the only way to get them). So whilst this means having to watch some brilliant films and television, it also means having to watch some right bunk. I'm talking Tank Girl. I'm talking Catwoman. I'm talking Superman IV.

And guess where this is heading? Yup - I'm talking Popeye.

Praise where praise is due first - it looks awesome. Sweethaven is perfect, from the rickety shacks to the look of the characters themselves - if it were based on looks alone, Popeye would be a five star classic.

Now, the decision to make this a musical was something that never really bothered me; the old Fleischer cartoons were so musical in spirit and tone that it kinda makes sense. But here's one of Popeye's major faults - the songs are AWFUL. Not just bad or unmemorable.. not every musical has to be Wizard Of Oz, but they are brutal to listen to. Olive Oyl's ""but he's laaaaaaarrrrge"" song makes me want to hurl kittens at cars. Even talking about it now makes me have violent urges, so we'd best stop there. But someone somewhere in creative control really should have LISTENED to these songs (which are littered all the way through the film) and realised how abysmal and unlikable they were. But, alas, they didn't, so we have a musical with the ability to create mass murderers.

Next up is Popeye himself. Now, he may LOOK the part, but there's just something about watching Robin Williams here that is fairly unnerving - Williams doesn't look at all comfortable in the role. Popeye is supposed to be shy, we get that, but never once does Williams convince as Popeye - we're only ever reminded that its Robin Williams dressed up as Popeye, and looking rather embarrassed about it.

As for the other characters? Well, Wimpy is rubbish, Olive Oyl is as annoying as she should be (Shelly Duvall just has that ""punchable"" quality. Was I the only one cheering on Jack Nicholson in The Shining?) but Bluto is BORING, which is just unacceptable. Who can forget the cackling loudmouth from the cartoons, full of menacing quips and vindictive glee? Here he glowers and looks big. And, uh, that's it.

For a movie aimed at kids, taken from old Segar comicstrips and Fleischer cartoons that were, and here's a good word - F-U-N. The spinach eating finale (Popeye hates spinach in this - whu?!) aside, its very probable kids will be bored out of their minds watching this.

The scenes range from warm and fuzzy to slightly disturbing (like when Brutus tries to sell the baby Sweet Pea). Even the music is different - the lyrics don't rhyme. Altman's improvisational style of letting actors control the scenes adds another level of strangeness to the whole affair.

Maybe that is why this movie endures. It is like other lasting films that just barely rise above the status of ""cult classic"" - like MASH, American Graffiti, or Paper Moon. What saves these films from obscure, cult-classic status is their sentimentality, unique and innovative direction, and ability to elicit themes everyone can relate to.

Today, however, I look at this film, and it actually puts me to sleep.  There is one dull scene after another, and the musical numbers are boring.  Robert Altman didn't seem to know what kind of movie this should be; a comedy or a musical.  It fails on both levels.  And on top of that, ""Popeye"" is a painfully over-long movie with a very thin plot.

The DVD offers only the movie with no bonus features or even a theatrical trailer.  I would have liked to hear commentary by director Altman and cast members, who may have all decided to avoid any further association with this film.

An alleged family film directed by Robert Altman(""M*A*S*H*), scripted by Jules Feiffer(""Carnal Knowledge"") and a song score by Harry Nillson and Van Dyke Parks.  Having initially seen this film when I was seventeen and re-viewing it for the first time since I enjoyed it immensely.  But who in their right mind thought this was a family film?  This is not to say that it contains any off-color humor (well, a couple double- entendres) but the humor is so ironic that I can't see how children, at least a portion of it's intended audience, would understand it.  Altman directs in his usual style(i.e. large ensembles, overlapping dialogue).  The film does not have so much as a story but a series of comic vignettes.  It may go on a little too long.  The production design is ingenious, with the town of Sweethaven looking like it was constructed by driftwood and rusty nails.  The songs, though sweetly performed, are mostly forgettable with one exception.  Olive Oyl's(Shelley Duvall) rendition of ""He Needs Me"".  This song was later used to good effect in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Punch-Drunk Love"", Anderson being a director whose style has more than a passing resemblance to Altman's.  The style of the film is in many ways reminiscent to the old Max Fleischer cartoons.  A young Robin Williams does a good job of mimicry in his portrayal of Popeye. Duvall, on the other hand, is excellent as Olive Oyl.  This is a role that she was born to play having both the physical build and temperment of the character.  The supporting characters are well cast with Paul Dooley(Wimpy),Paul Smith(Bluto), and Ray Walston(Poopdeck Pappy).

253187,5,6300213781,"Harry Nilsson didn't record very much after his contract with RCA expired in 1978, his last album for the Nipper being his own personal favorite album of his career, 'Knnillssonn,' a truly great piece of work, but completely out of step with the Disco and Punk of 1978.  The result: low sales.  His very last album was released in 1980, 'Flash Harry,' produced by ex-M.G. Steve Cropper, using primarily the still intact Blues Brothers Band.  Unfortunately, Cropper could not get a single record company to release it in the U.S.A., and resorted to releasing it on Mercury in the U.K.-only, in 1980.

  Ah, but also in 1980, we have POPEYE!  Harry Nilsson's soundtrack to this musical is phenomenal!  And at least as a movie, it most definitely was released in the U.S.A. in 1980 and is readily available today on both DVD and VHS tape.  With Harry's untimely death to a strange disease in the early 90's, this is the very last mainstream release of new Nilsson compositions.  If you are a Harry Nilsson fan and yearn for yet one more ""new"" album from Harry, here it is - the DVD of this movie, 'Popeye.' And happily, it's a wall-to-wall musical, simply packed with the musical genius of Harry Nilsson!

  Robin Williams' performance as Popeye is equally phenomenal - the mumbling under his breath, the swagger - he IS Popeye; Williams has done here what no one else could do. He is a human cartoon.

253189,4,6300213781,"Robin Williams' Popeye is a riotously funny movie. Williams does a better job than I remembered at bringing Segar's sailor to life. He maintains a steady stream of muttering commentary as he swaggers through Sweet Haven. To tell the truth, that's where all the best lines in the movie are, and they're easy to miss. Shelley Duvall created an impossibly accurate Olive Oyl, with some wild, rubbery moments in her performance. The town of Sweet Haven itself is almost a character, too. Most of it is  cluttered and impossibly lopsided. It's true to old cartoon spirit, and filled with much too much detail to take in all at once.

For some unfathomable reason, this became a musical. The tunes are mostly forgettable, except for Duvall's ""Large"". They just didn't work real well for me. Also, some of the lesser characters (Wimpy, for example), weren't exaggerated as much as Olive Oyl and especially Popeye. A bit more work on some of those characters, Bluto in particular, and this could have been a real classic.

That's OK. It's a fun movie anyway, and good for kids - no hard edges, no serious violence. It never got the best reviews, but it's still worth watching.

And a note to vhspreowner - Disney and Paramount have actually had a pretty good relationship, even after Popeye went bust, (Which actually wasn't as bad as many think - it grossed $50 million domestically, making a $30 million profit.) including Paramount's recent collaboration with Disney (through Miramax) to produce The Hours.",1083888000,,595,5.081632653061225
253226,5,6300213781,"In 2004, Popeye will be celebrating his 75th birthday! The anvil armed spinach eater is an icon to Americans (as well as Europeans) everywhere. And if you are like me, an American of European ancestry...
""Popeye the Sailor"" was created by E.C. Segar as a character in the black & white (later color), Fleischer Brothers newspaper strip ""Thimble Theatre"" (which was a comic about The Oyl Family). He later made his debut with his own cartoon short, seen on movie screens everywhere in 1933.
Walt Disney Pictures teamed with Paramount Pictures to create the 1980 live action movie directed by Robert Altman, bringing the comic character turned cartoon star into a living breathing human. The parts of Popeye and Olive Oyl were originally going to be played by Dustin Hoffman and Lilly Tomlin but ultimately went to Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall in perfect casting roles. The entire gang was aboard for the ride (Bluto, Wimpy, Swee' Pea, and all the rest along with plenty of new friends and foes).
Despite Popeye being a Segar/Fleischer creation as well as having later associations with A.A.P. (Associated Artists Productions), Hanna Barbera, Disney & Paramount, Popeye is best known as being a ""King Features Syndicate"" and will forever be linked to all animators and produces as being King's trademark. In fact, because the exact rights for Popeye were so confusing, he was mysteriously missing from the 1989 cartoon/live action movie ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" as the most notably absent cartoon. Due to fear of being sued, Touchstone Pictures sadly left Popeye out of the film, while every other one of his contemporaries from Mickey Mouse to Bugs Bunny appeared in the famous ""Toon Town"" scenes. Today, Popeye is alive and well with the King Features clan. Sammy Lerner wrote the famous theme song that has been a staple wherever Popeye has appeared.
Although maybe not quite on the scale of ""Pinocchio,"" Popeye is very popular in Italy where he is nicknamed ""Iron Arm."" Bill Costello provided the original voice in the cartoon and later in the 1970s, Hanna Barbera is best credited with bringing Popeye back to life in several new shows including an updated version called ""Popeye & Son,"" where Popeye & Olive are married with their own kid (not Swee' Pea).
Perhaps his popularity in Italy and throughout Europe can be linked not so much for Costello's and Barbera's contributions, but to the filming of the movie in Anchor Bay (near the capital Valletta) in Malta, a small island in the Mediterranean, just 60 miles south of Sicily. After filming, it became a hugely popular tourist attraction, and even today movies are filmed there through MFF-Malta Films Facilities (""Troy"" starring Brad Pitt just wrapped filming in Malta, Greece, Spain and Italy, and Pitt no doubt will be an even huger figure in Europe now).
Many of the ""citizens"" of the created town of Sweethaven, especially those who had to do some physical gags, were recruited from European traveling circuses. Most of the cast and crew (about 60% if you read the credits carefully) had Italian surnames! The following is a list of those credits: Richard Libertini (played ""Geezil""), Larry Pisoni (played ""Chico""), Peggy Pisoni (played ""Pickelina""), Carlo Pellegrini (played ""Swifty""), Noel Parenti (played ""Slick""), Pietro Torrisi (played ""Bolo""), Roberto Dell `Aqua (played ""Chimneysweep""), Valerie Velardi (played ""Cindy""), Roberto Messina (played ""Gozo"" and was head stunt coordinator), Sammy Gemette (sound editor), Giovanni Fiore (camera operator), GianFranco Transunto (camera operator), Luigi Bernardini (camera operator), Mauro Merchetti (camera operator), Gian Maria Magorana (camera operator), Lorenzo Battaglia (underwater camera operator), Rudolfo Bramucci (gaffer), Vladimiro Salvatore (key grip), Alberto Emidi (key grip), Tony Maccario (property manager), Alvaro Belsole (construction manager), GianCarlo Del Brocco (makeup), Alfredo Tiberi (makeup), Gilberto Provenghi (makeup), Alvaro Rossi (makeup), Maria Teresa Corridoni (hairdresser), Aldo Signoretti (hairdresser), Gabriella Borzelli (hairdresser), Rita Innocenzi (hairdresser), Rita Galea (publicity), Paulo Lucidi (unit manager), Luciano Tartaglia (accountant), Gaetano Mirante (carpenter), Gugliemo Modestini (painter), Angelo Marta (sculpter), Angelo Zaccaria (sculpter), and last but not least, Mickey Chono (head caterer). Alitalia Airlines was the air transportation company of choice for all involved in the film.
So as you can see, Popeye can quite possibly be considered a foreign film (although it is in English) and the fact that it's popular from the US to Europe-to everywhere in between-is no surprise. It's amazing how many Italians were involved in the creation of the characters as well as the sets. Like Italy, Malta's official religion is Catholic and it's official languages are Maltese (which is a West Arabic dialect with some Italian words) and English. The country has Maltese and English newspapers and is a huge tourist spot for those visiting nearby Sicily and even stands wonderful on it's own. In fact, tourism is the main business in the country's economy and the mild yearlong weather and beautiful seaside villages (as seen in Popeye) are no doubt it's selling points. Just watching the movie makes me want to travel there someday and the beautiful cinematography bring the sailor to life as well as any of the animators who have tried their hand at drawing the famous sailorman.
Popeye has his own video game, his own stamp, a clothing line (and Halloween costume), not to mention his own real brand of canned spinach, the #2 seller in supermarkets everywhere just behind Del Monte. In fact, he is so famous that he has his own statue in Chester, Illinois-which is the birthplace of E.C. Segar. Today, Popeye can be seen on Cartoon Network and read in papers nationwide as well as on the internet. This year marks the 110th birthday of E.C. Segar as well as the 75th birthday of Popeye, and next year, Popeye the Movie will celebrate it's 25th anniversary with a new DVD.

Robin Williams was great, as was Shelly Duvall and Ray Walston. I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. M'S Duvall is the perfect Olive Oyl, conflicted between the brutish Bluto and the one eyed Popeye. Ray Walston is always terrific in any movie, here he shines as Popeye's pappy.
The dvd has a good transfer, but as the movie involves a lot of people talking at the same time, you may want to try using the subtitles to see what is being said. There's so much humor in Popeye's mutterings, you want to be ble to hear every word.

I still catch myself singing some these tunes every once in a while.
Robin Williams is the only actor in history that could have pulled off the role of Popeye. His comic genius is now a known fact now but back in 1980 this movie proved he could do more than just Mork from Ork. Shelley Duvall, same thing, no one else could have done the Olive Oyle role any better. Had they decided to set the movie in the real world it may not have worked out, however, by creating a mythical island town like Sweethaven, it allowed the movie to feel like you were being transported to a wierd, trippy world where no one is completely normal.
I agree with a previous review that this movie suffered from a bad marketing strategy. It really straddles the fence between being a movie for adults or kids.

But now, I find it more corny than totally enjoyable. I am beginning to think that I should have rented first. Normally one of my main rules. But despite disapppointments, I am going to keep it, because there isn't anything else like it.
I love the opening theme song -- it's wonderful. The town is visually grand -- and on that level, as Amazon says in its review, it works: The characters, town, and all.
Shelly Duvall is wonderful as Olive. Robin Williams is interesting -- but hadn't found his place yet in the movies. I didn't like a lot of his early films as much as I do what he does now. He finally really shines at the end of the film. The Bluto character is interesting -- but not the Bluto I remember from the cartoons: He lacked any true personality; maybe a contrast was needed between the rest of the goofy characters, but he was still goofy.
I like the music -- find it amusing -- but find myself wishing that it was less of a musical, sometimes, and other times, accepting it.
It is not a totally bad film -- although I could see where some children might not like it; I cannot judge it on that level, because I was in my thirties when I first saw it.
My major complaint is what Amazon already said: It doesn't really work as bringing out Popeye as a character. My major compliment: It works as a town and its citizens. -- And I do not think the town looks dirty; it looks visually catching and cartoonish, with those wonderful sight gags starting everything off. Some of Popeye's lines and comebacks are softly-amusing.

The reason you buy a DVD version of a movie (when you already have a VHS copy) is to gain something. Extras like commentaries are fine, but you weren't drawn to the DVD commentary before there was a DVD, were you?
The moment I knew the DVD for Popeye was worth the price was when I heard the 5.1 mix down in the engagement party scene at the Oyl's house. Where once there had been just a uninteligible mumble in the background, there is now clear, crisp dialogue that you can point to as if the actor was right in the room with you.
The final test is whether the release brings something to the production that, while there all the time, creates an experience for the viewer that lets them feel as though they are seeing it (or hearing it) for the first time.
The 6/24/03 DVD release of Popeye is just such a release.",1059177600,2,981,4.0880829015544045

It was a wonderful movie as a child to me who loved Popeye. The characters were great, the music was great and of course I have to say hats off to Altman great vision & Robin Williams superb performance as Popeye. The only disappointment to this classic DVD is that are no extras, behind the scenes, deleted scenes, outtakes or documentaries. Fans pray and if Mr. Altman if you happen to read this, PLEASE, PLEASE, make a special edition Popeye DVD or maybe a director's cut to this cult classic!",1057968000,,638,4.369747899159663
253264,5,6300213781,"E.C. Segar, the creator of Thimble Theater and Popeye, is inarguably one of the greatest cartoonists of all times. His ability to weave crazily compelling stories around a cast of the bizarre and comical was as amazing as his perception of human nature. His art was second-to-none in it's simple and unique expressiveness. He's up there with Herriman and above McCay. Maybe Kurtzman and Cole deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. Maybe. Well, Jules Feiffer did Segar great justice in penning this film, and Altman did the world a favor in creating the world so compellingly, as did the miraculous cast. It is a tribute to the world's best comic strip and to the early, fun Fleischer cartoons. William's first starring role and still one of his finest. The only thing this movie is missing is the Sea Hag. I absolutely loved this movie as a kid, when I knew none of this info (though I'd read and adored a fair amount of the original comic strip), and I love it just as much today. I've been checking regularly for this release on DVD, just like I did with The Hustler, and I'm just as happy to have this classic in widescreen. Get it for your kids, get it for yourself. Suspend adult cynicism at the door and you won't regret it. The film critics who panned it when it was released were braindead and drove Altman to Europe. Lucky for Altman, but unlucky for American film fans.",1057536000,,1384,4.54

Lots of lesser films get the special DVD treatment, so why not this one?  Robert Altman's Popeye is simply one of the most delightful films I've ever seen.  But for full enjoyment, you have to keep your eyes and ears open. There's even more taking place in the background nooks and crannies of ""Popeye"" than there is up front. And all of it is a clever, inventive, respectful homage to a comic strip/cartoon character that has never received his much deserved place of honor alongside Mickey, Bugs and Daffy. And the music is wonderful. It's what grabbed my attention one day when I still mistakenly trusted the critics who panned this film. I was channel surfing and I heard Olive Oyl singing ""He Needs Me,"" and I was hooked. And then there's Popeye singing a glorious, heartbreaking lullaby to Swee'pea.  And then there's Olive singing about Bluto's greatest asset (""He's Large""), accompanied by some ladies who sing impeccably, beautifully, hilariously off-key. ""Everything is Food.""  ""Sweet, Sweethaven.""  All the music is wonderful, and when you add it to everything else, Robert Altman's ""Popeye"" is a jewel.  See this movie.

253266,4,6300213781,"After Hollywood wunderkid producer Robert Evans (see The Kid Stays in the Picture) came out of the life affirming musical Annie, Evans wanted to make it into movie, but couldn't get the rights (it was later bought by someone else) so instead he got the rights to E.C. Segar's Popeye and made that into a musical.  He got Robert Altman to direct with his ensemble cast, even though Altman hadn't had a hit in years (actually, Popeye ended up resembling M.A.S.H., what with its overlapping dialogue, large cast of characters, and self-contained set: instead of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital you have the town of Sweethaven, constructed in Malta).  He got Jules Feiffer to write the script, due to the fact Feiffer was a writer in a similar vein of Segar and loved Popeye as a child (Feiffer also wrote the incredibly cynical screenplay for Mike Nichol's Carnal Knowledge).  Harry Nillson (The Point) wrote the music, with players including Klaus Voorman (a member of the Plastic Ono Band) and Van Dyke Parks.  The cast is impressive as well, featuring Robin Williams in his first starring role.  But the film flopped : those that wanted a life affirming fable were confused by the obvious cynical and confusing storyline.  I, as a child, was completely fascinated by it, as were alot of children of my generation: Popeye was the one valiant character in the whole thing, which makes it resemble more the original Thimble Theatre strip rather that the Fleischer's cartoons.  Looking back at it, it's a great film, one that deserves some special features that are, unfortunately, not on this DVD release.",1056412800,6,1602,4.88929889298893
253267,3,6300213781,"Director Robert Altman, who is best known for his direction of the 1970 film ""MASH"", directed the less successful 1980 film ""Popeye"", so named for the similarly titled comic strip/cartoon created by E. C. Segar (1894-1938).  The characters Olive Oyl, her first boyfriend Ham Gravy, and her family Cole Oyl, Nana Oyl and Castor Oyl first appeared in the 1910's in Segar's comic strip known as the Thimble Theater.  The character Popeye did not appear until 1929, but became extremely popular.  Segar drew Popeye with exaggerated muscles in his forearms and calves, but with skinny upper arms and thighs.  He also drew Popeye with an exaggerated jaw and with a corncob pipe in his mouth.  Popeye became Olive Oyl's boyfriend.  Segar drew her tall and lanky with very thin extremities.  A mutual friend for Popeye and Olive Oyl was Wimpy, a short, fat man who obsessed about eating hamburgers.  Also, there is Bluto: a bearded & physically strong pirate who had an eye for Olive Oyl, but was also Popeye's mortal enemy.
Turning a cartoon into a live-action film is not an easy task, but the set designers, wardrobe designers and make-up artists involved with ""Popeye"" created a very accurate representation of Popeye's world.  Robin Williams was physically transformed into an accurate caricature of Popeye, Shelley Duvall was the ideal candidate to portray the very lanky Olive Oyl, Paul Dooley became the hamburger-infatuated Wimpy and Paul L. Smith becomes the fierce Bluto.  Other characters from the comic strip included Popeye's father (Poopdeck Pappy played by Ray Walston), the baby Swee'pea (Wesley Ivan Hurt), Cole Oyl (MacIntyre Dixon), Nana Oyl (Roberta Maxwell), Castor Oyl (Donovan Scott) and Ham Gravy (Bill Irwin).
Unfortunately, the writers & composers for ""Popeye"" were not as prepared in creating an enjoyable story and musical score for the venerable Popeye character and his friends to match the efforts of the visual teams.  The story begins with Popeye's arrival in the town of Sweet Haven where he meets Wimpy, Olive Oyl and Bluto.  He finds his long lost father, adopts the abandoned Swee'pea, becomes Olive Oyl's boyfriend, fights Bluto and all to the addition of music.  My rating (out of 5 stars) for each of the rather forgettable songs performed in the film are as follows:
* ""Sweet Haven"" (3, sung by the residents of Sweet Haven).
* ""I Am What I Am"" (4, sung by Robin Williams).
* ""He Needs Me"" (3, sung Shelley Duvall).
* ""Everything is Food (2, sung by chorus).
* ""Blow Me Down"" (3, sung by Robin Williams).
* ""I'm Mean"" (2, sung by Paul L. Williams).
* ""He's Large"" (2, sung by Shelley Duvall).
* ""Sail With Me"" (3, sung by Robin Williams & Shelley Duvall).
* ""It's Not Easy Bein' Me"" (2, sung by Ray Walston).
* ""Children"" (2, sung by Ray Walston).
* ""Popeye The Sailor Man"" (3, sung by Robin Williams & chorus).
With his keen ability to do various voices, Robin Williams does make a passable Popeye and Shelley Duvall does a reasonable job as Olive Oyl.  However, Paul L. Smith's portrayal of Bluto was uninspired.  For its visual appeal, but less than memorable story, dialog & music, I rate ""Popeye"" with an overall rating of 3.  My advice to anyone that is considering to purchase the film, but has not yet seen it, should consider renting it first.  Perhaps the writers & composers should have eaten more spinach before undertaking this film project.",1056326400,5,3388,4.854166666666667

The music is not memorable at all.  All I had in my head was the rundundant line from a song that sung by Olive Oil in answer to the question of what she liked about the man she was thinking of marrying...  She sang:  ""He's Large"".

I can't imagine anyone playing these characters other than the people cast.  Robin Williams performance as Popeye is reminiscent of the really old B&W Popeye cartoons where half of the time he's mumbling which adds to the comedy.  Even the costumes in this movie are semi-cartoonish which cleverly adds to the cartoon-to-live-action transition while reminding us that the silliness is part of the reason we loved the cartoons and characters as much as we did, and still do.
Bravo to Paramount for finally releasing this on DVD for the people like me who have been searching for this classic since I bought my DVD player.  I've been checking on a weekly to monthly basis for a long time now, and am estatic to see my searching has paid off.

Segar's weird little world is almost fully represented, with the Oyl family, Popeye, Bluto (not Brutus), Wimpy and the Roughhouse Gang.  Even Geezil is hiding in the background, if you look for him.  The only thing missing is The Seahag and her Goons.
The film has an incredible pedigree.  Directed by Robert Altman (Gosford Park) with music by Harry Nielsen.  Robin Williams is perfect as Popeye, and it is hard to picture anyone other than Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl.  Ray Walston is an equally perfect Poopdeck Pappy.

Plus Shelly Duvall!  WoW!
And it has some of the funniest moments in the world, like when Popeye is trying to convince Poopdeck Pappy that he's the father that Popeye has been searching his whole life for:

It really makes you lose a little more faith in mankind. I'm amazed to hear that Altman is ashamed of this. I looked up his other movies here on Amazon and found that I had never seen, nor had any desire to see any of his other work. It seems to me that Popeye was his one good piece of work, though as I said, I haven't seen the others. As for Robin, this is probably his best piece of work, and anyway, if he's going to be ashamed of some of his films, I can think of others that he SHOULD be ashamed of. This one, along with the two Aladdin movies, he should hail as his greatest work! Anyway, enough ranting, let me get on with the praise! In a movie based on a cartoon, old TV show, comic, or any other previously established piece of work, casting is all important. That's where this movie delivers the strongest! This is PERFECT casting! Nothing more needs to be said about that. And wow, how about Popeye's arms? How'd they do that? Perfect! All the costumes and sets were beautifully done and so true to the cartoons! The lines were endless and wonderful! The songs may have been strange, but thad does not mean they were bad! They were GREAT! They were extremely weird, but GREAT! They're part of what makes the movie so good! Everything about it was absolutely perfect. I heard someone, I think it was Altman, say that one of the big ""flaws"" was the ending. That they ran out of money and didn't get to put on the huge, spectacular finale that was planned on, so they ended up just painting Bluto yellow and having him swim off scared. Well, all I can say is, it may have been spectacular if they had done more with the ending, but it certainly didn't hurt the movie. It was magnificent!

Recommend this movie? You bet!  But I don't think that it's a movie that everyone will enjoy; just those who want a wonderful trip back to their childhood with a living Popeye and Olive Oyl. For those who want to take that trip, I think this movie does a very special job.  One that I'll cherish for years to come!",987120000,,692,4.655737704918033
253333,3,6300213781,"Well, this was never really my favorite movie. But the quality of much recent media has increased my opinion of ""Popeye"" quite a bit. Most people can not seem to make a movie these days without giving us all effects and no story, showering us with blood, sex, or profanity, trying to force feed us what is politically correct, or having someone killed every other minute. The fact that ""Popeye"" does not fall into any of these categories greatly increases my opinion of it. Now it is not the most worthy movie to be sure. HOWEVER, there are many memorable elements. The scenery is simple, but it does carry charm. The songs are cute and memorable. The town's fear of Popeye, and later its acceptance of him is realistic and well done. It is touching how Popeye fights through a difficult journey to find his father, and funny when he gets into different kinds of trouble on the way, and accidentally becomes the town's hero. (When he accidentally pushes the tax man into the water.) Popeye's father is handled well. First we hear of him. (Although we don't know the person everyone is talking about is Popeye's father.) Then we see him, and the resemblance to Popeye makes it obvious that he is Popeye's father; then they meet and discover each other. Popeye's final persuit of Bluto is suspenseful and hilarious. We finally see Popeye and his father together and they get on each other's nerves the whole way. Popeye's father even carries out his role as a father when he pushes Popeye into doing something so he can save the day! So while this is not exactly a smash hit, (in my opinion) it carries many worthy elements; it is worth the time; and while it may not become a classic, it will probably carry a strong cult following. If you have not seen it, do so. You may be pleasantly surprised.",984268800,6,1796,4.563467492260062
253334,5,6300213781,"I can understand why many people don't like this movie. In an era filled with action packed films and realism, this movie looks like a throw back to when Shirley Temple was still a child. But that's what makes this movie so great. It's ""new"" and refreshing! The music is great, Popeye is . . . Popeye and Olive looks exactly the way I envisioned her to look like if she was a real person. The movie follows the traditional story of the Popeye cartoon. It's simple, unadulterated and clean.
It shames me that society is so closed minded that they would much rather embrace a movie like Independence Day (which I'll readily admit that I waited in line on July 3 to watch the movie at 12:01 AM on July 4). While fool hardy mucks attempt to shove a movie of such flavor like Popeye down into the bowels of the bargain bins. Popeye needs to be cherished and not shunned. Why does a movie like the Power Rangers with it's mixed messages and hypocritical theme succeed while Popeye with it's extraordinary humor and innocence is thrashed?",974246400,6,1031,4.48936170212766

The songs are cool (especially the food song and when Popeye  writes to Sweet Pea, sob). This is a movie you can appreciate at 2 in the  morning or when you're fully awake.

I thought I was watching the cartoon at times. Bluto, Olive Oyl and the whole  cast are so great in this movie that they all deserved Oscars. Check out  the opening credits for a 2 second black and white cartoon opening. Made me  hungry for hamburgers too. Popeye shows that it takes heart to overcome  trouble and not muscle. He's the best.

(no seahag or goons.  They are sadly missing. )Great, catchy songs by Harry Nielson really add to  the fun. Who new Robin Williams could do a musical?

But, I gotta tell ya, after several viewings of this film, I have  become convinced that the script (by political cartoonist Jules Feiffer)  makes a comment on the plight of the individual in collectivist society.  When I came to this conclusion, I liked the movie even more, as it really  warmed my old, conservative, semi-libertarian HEART!  Of course, my five  year old just loves it when Bluto sings ""I'm Mean,"" so I could be  waaaaay off base here.
