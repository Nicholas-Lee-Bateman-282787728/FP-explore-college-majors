8356494,4,B0028NSEFK,"Without giving away too much it is about a woman who marries a man who offers her practically everything but keeps her in isolation.  From here the plot thickens and the story begins.  No swearing or gore, filmed in black and white with a good film transfer.  I recommend this film for those who like well acted good story line movies.",1380931200,,335,4.459016393442623
