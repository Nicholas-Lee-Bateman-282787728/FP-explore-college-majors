7713191,1,B01DJQBP1O,"Very disappointed in the lack of quality of the DVD picture. It is NOT High Def.  I can't speak to the BluRay but the DVD, although in fine physical form, has a slightly blurry picture.  I tried the DVD on multiple players and TVs and the clarity was lousy every time.  Basically, it looks like a basketball game in a non-HD broadcast.",1465948800,,335,4.370967741935484

8756075,3,B01DJQBP1O,"2 disks, SD and Blu-Ray, both are fine for what they are, but was disappointed in the ""Special Bonus Features.""  Now I understand that since this was produced so shortly after the game that it wasn't going to have much in the way of extra commentary, but it was basically the game, and the extras were the halftime show or the after-game celebration.  Maybe I am being naive but I was at least hoping for highlights of the tournament of each team up until the championship game.  Oh well, still glad I have it.",1470441600,3,510,4.404255319148936
