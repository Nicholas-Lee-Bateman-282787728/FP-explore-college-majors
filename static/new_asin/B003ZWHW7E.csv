8411152,2,B003ZWHW7E,The reason for giving this item 2 stars rating based on this instructional video was not gear towards individual who have never perform the task of completely done hair weaving. I purchased this item to have understanding of learning to do my own hair weaving but I was mislead.  This item is gear towards personal who have done or at least attempt of weaving hair. The difficulties I have experience with this item was the lack of how to accomplish the task of weaving and different ways of braiding the hair into patterns. I was totally confused and disappointed especially when I waited for weeks to receive such item.,1409443200,,621,4.697247706422019
