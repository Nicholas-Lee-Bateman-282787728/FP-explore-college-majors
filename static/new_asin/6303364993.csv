7847220,5,6303364993,I love this VHS tape. Carol Burnett is super great. I didn't realise Scott Bakula was as talented as he is. Micheal Jeter was a surprise also. Barry Bostwick just added to the fun. Hope this comes out on DVD soon!!,1444608000,,214,4.2439024390243905
7847221,3,6303364993,"This is not the infamous The Carol Burnett Show (CBS,1967-78),  nor the shorter syndicated version Carol Burnett and Friends, but a Carol Burnett special she made for broadcast television on October 24, 1994.  Her guest stars, Scott Bakula, Barry Bostwick and Michael Jeter (recently passed away with HIV/AIDS) who sing and dance and join Carol Burnett in several comedy sketches.  The comedy sketches have do to with Broadway and classic motion pictures.  Tony Bennett also guest stars and offers his fine Italian vocal talent.  Tony and Carol do a duet.
  It is always nice to see a Carol Burnett special.",1084320000,2,607,5.01
7847222,5,6303364993,"Men, movies, and Carol has got to be the finest entertainment I have enjoyed in years!  It is fresh, witty, and displays great range.  It has everything from parodies, great dance numbers, and wonderful music.  It is better than anything I have seen on broadway.  It was great to see Burnett doing what she does best.  An artist and a true genius, she excells in all mediums displayed.  They don't write comedy like this anymore! And Burnett knows how to pick the right males to accompany her.  My favorite parodies were: The Graduate and Remains of the Day.  Barry Bostwick is sexy and debonair, and Scott Bakula shows a flair for comedy - a pleasant surprise!",996019200,13,661,4.637931034482759
