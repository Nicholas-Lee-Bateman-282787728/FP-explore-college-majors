8036346,5,B00061F6T8,With guest star George Hamilton this is another Columbo episode with superb writing and great acting. This one is about a corrupt medical doctor who has an affair with his patient. This is the episode that has the blind eyewitness. It is a very clever script.,1106438400,3,259,4.6521739130434785
