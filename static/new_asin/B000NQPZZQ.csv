8180900,1,B000NQPZZQ,"Pronunciation was not very good, no native speakers at all, a handful of words that my kids pretty much already knew. Cheesey backgrounds, bad music. Unimpressed.",1308960000,,162,5.269230769230769
8180901,1,B000NQPZZQ,"Recommended ages 1-8+? I think not. I got this for my 6-year-old to start learning Spanish from. I thought I'd prescreen it before having him watch it. I'd say this truly is for ages 1- 4 TOPS. And like another review mentioned, the pronunications are questionable, and there are some errors. I'll be looking into other language learning options.",1248739200,,346,4.88135593220339
8180902,1,B000NQPZZQ,"Here's the good news.  This is a professionally edited DVD filled with attractive children posed in natural settings or against interesting cartoon backdrops.  The background music is pleasant, and the participants seem enthusiastic.

Now for the bad news.

First, the opening and closing songs are in English, and the opening song is repeated over the closing credits.  That's a lot of program time spent on music in English!

Second, only eighteen Spanish words are taught: hello, food, water, mother, father, house, dog, cat, baby, good, yes, no (which, in Spanish, is ""no""!), more, friend, ball, car and goodbye.  The DVD costs $20, so the consumer is paying over $1 per word---an expensive way to learn Spanish!

Third, this is not a green company.  The Kids Love Spanish series contains seven volumes, and each volume is only 30 minutes long.  Why waste resources and clutter people's shelves with four DVDs and four DVD cases when you can sell the same amount of information on one disc with one DVD case?

Fourth, because most of the participants are not native speakers, the pronunciation can be iffy.  Everyone on the disc (even the adults!) pronounces the Spanish word for water, agua, as ""ah-wah"" (silent ""g"").  When a couple of kids say perro (dog), it comes out as pero (but).  Carro (car) sometimes sounds like caro (expensive).

Finally, there are some puzzling errors in the DVD.  Why, when the Spanish title is ""Palabras Bsicas"" (Basic Words) does the child accompanying the title just say, ""palabras"" (words)?  Why, when the visuals show that the word for ""friend"" differs according to the gender of the friend (amigo for a male, amiga for a female), does the voice-over during another scene say, ""She's a new amigo!""  Ack!

I know that DVDs are expensive to make and production costs are high, but I do expect more in exchange for my family's hard earned money.  I therefore suggest that if your family really wants to watch this DVD, you save your money and borrow it from your local public library.",1226793600,8,2020,4.868035190615836
8180903,4,B000NQPZZQ,"My son really enjoyed the DVD. He asks to watch it numerous times. I think he enjoys watching the other kids say the words as well. My son will repeat the words back, and thus makes the DVD interactive.

My opinion- I wish the songs were in Spanish. Two of the Kids Love Spanish song were completely in English. I wish they did a bilingual version in Espanol! I love the bilingual songs Boca Beth puts out for kids and was expecting something more along those lines in this video. Of course this is only the first volume so hopefully there will be more songs with the Spanish language included! The one song my son really liked was the uno, dos, y tres song on the Kids Love Spanish music section.

Although I do prefer the Kids  Love Spanish video quality. Having the children in the video makes my son all the more interested in repeating what the kids are saying. My son has learned a great deal of vocab with this video. Every word in this DVD my 2 yr old son has memorized after watching only 2-3 times. I will be buying the other volumes since my son has enjoyed this one so much.

I also recommend going over the words from the DVD at different times for reinforcement apart from watching such as dinner time,etc.

A good book I'd recommend to go along with these are the Say Hola to Spanish books. More bilingual fun for the little ones!",1200700800,,1345,4.321428571428571
8180904,5,B000NQPZZQ,"I have two toddlers ages 2.5 and 1.5 and have been searching for the right vehicle to introduce them to Spanish.  I bought all seven of the Kids Love Spanish DVDs because we were wearing out the one we bought originally!  My two-year-old is so fascinated with the kids on the video he just sits there and repeats the Spanish words.  Working the Spanish vocabulary into our family dinners has become a nightime ritual in our household.  I think he has more fun with these words than with new English words because he thinks HE'S teaching US new words that he learned first!

My husband and I feel a lot more comfortable with our kids watching this series than even the popular educational TV programs out there because this feels so much more interactive to us, like we're engaging in a game with our children because we're all so actively involved in learning together.  I hope other people's children enjoy this DVD as much as ours do!",1176595200,2,936,4.574850299401198
