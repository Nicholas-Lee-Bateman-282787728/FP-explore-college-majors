5234194,4,B00915G6NK,NCIS LA is great...hope its on another 10 years!!  The show is witty with great actor and characters.  This isn't some flag waving show...the characters are flawed and the action is good.,1352073600,,187,4.8125
5234195,5,B00915G6NK,This episode was very well written. The story was good. I thought that it was another really good episode and I look forward to the rest of the season. This episode was in my opinion a funny episode at times and I love the fight scenes.,1352073600,,236,4.1521739130434785
5234196,5,B00915G6NK,Just when I think NCIS: LA can't get any more intense it does. This one had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  With an interesting premise and even some fun dog scenes I really enjoyed this episode.,1352073600,,206,4.024390243902439

5234199,5,B00915G6NK,"This season was very good, had a surprise ending that no one saw comming... but i do wonder 1 thing why do they have a new NCIS assistance Director in LA but you hear nothing about him in the reg NSIC,

5234587,5,B00915G6NK,"I have all the seasons up to season 7, it definitely is the best weekly series on TV ,no doubt
the writers are great and write the very best for all the charactors ,the actors are all perfect for there rolls,there awesome.  keep up the great work and we are anxiously
waiting for season 7 and season 8 to become available on DVD for purchase,and many more seasons after that
for people like myself who have very busy lives and can not always catch the weekly series so we all definetly appreciate
the opportunity to purchase the season series on dvd

this comes from over 20 of us who changed from book clubs to favorite tv series,  NCIS Los Angels wins hands down 5 plus stars

This edition of the franchise is the best. It's less militaristic than NCIS and less parochial than NCIS:NO. It has a sense of humor when appropriate, the acting is good, there's plenty of action in good plots, and don't ya just love Hetty (Linda Hunt)!!! The best!",1447113600,,439,4.432098765432099

5235183,5,B00915G6NK,"Each season of NCIS  LA only gets better and better.  A bit of laugh, lots and lots of action, and a big nuclear ending leaving the watcher anxious
for season 5.  And I will start 5 after I finish this review.  I am a bit uneasy with all the killings, but then they are all bad guys and get what they
deserve.  And finally perhaps a growing romance between Deeks and Kensi; at least I hope so.  Anyhow, beautiful scenery, excellent photography
and believable acting makes this series among the very best.  Sometimes the stories seem to move away from naval crime investigation and into
routine crime fighting, but who cares, the fun is all over the place. Some mush is creeping in which I like and the ladies are gorgeous. LA even
looks good though I am a NY and Chicago lover;  it even looks CLEAN!  Perhaps I miss judged the city; I thought it was full of illegals and  gangs.
My only bitch is the uniforms, badges of the LAPD are not correct; apparently LAPD does not want the producers to use realistic stuff.  I think
at the beginning they did use the correct items but changed them recently; I notice details like that.  It doesn't distract in any way from the excellence
of the quality of the show. As they say in LA: ""Far out man!"" or ""Like, you know!""..A little California lingo.  Anyhow, Five Stars!!  I get all my NCIS
stuff from Amazon. Enjoy!!  Be sure to pay attention to the last episode of Disc 6, its a doozy!!",1418688000,,1427,4.3726235741444865

5235542,3,B00915G6NK,"Although we enjoy the show overall, especially the characters of Callan, Hanna, Hetty and Deeks, we find the girl Blight way below par for acting skills. Plus, her continual sexual overtones to Deeks is also becoming a bit boring sometimes. Just get on with story fellows without unnecessary spin situation.

Additionally, the childish banter between the two (2) computer nerds is also becoming boring. Do not mind a little bit here and there but for about 4-6 chapters it just became inane to say the least.

I hope the writers will stick to the story line for next season otherwise we will give it away.",1383350400,,605,4.752380952380952

5235603,1,B00915G6NK,"I watched this show until this season, and finally had to quit because of Deeks' character.  He is so nasty-looking, juvenile, annoying, and all-around intolerable I could no longer stand to see him for even a minute.  I really enjoy the rest of the cast, and this could be a good show if not for Deeks.  He constantly hits on Kinsey, has a very unfunny, stupid even, sense of 'humor', and worst of all he looks like you can smell him from a block away.  Is he really what the producers think an LA undercover cop would be like?  I mean, come on, really?

I'm writing this review hoping that people from the show read this and get a clue.  I feel so strongly about this I emailed the show about either please cleaning him up, and growing him up, or getting rid of him.  Such a shame, too.  If they'd get rid of him, who knows, maybe they'd get a couple more people to watch...

Further development on the Kensi/Deeks situation with sparks flying so high I was surprised my rug didn't catch on fire! Their chemistry far outstrips the Tony/Ziva romantic ambiguity.

The cases are exciting and the endings tend towards the unexpected. And despite her diminutive size, Henrietta Lange is not someone you want to mess with.

Gave it 4 stars because it was good. Parts 1 & 2. But it needs a heavy hitter in there somewhere.

The original NCIS always deals with justice within the Armed Forces.  I find many of the plots of NCIS:LA too involved in espionage and world terrorism and very little to do with justice for members of the US Navy or Marine Corps and therefore my interest often wanes.

They understand each other so well that there is like an unspoken communication going on half the time and I love how Kenzie and Deeks have this sort of romantic sexual chemistry and I really hope they get together. They played married on an episode and they did it so well that it was believable. It is a great show and of course Hettie with her various names and identities and the fact that she knows everything kinda like Gibbs in NCIS but shes even better because she has her hand in everything and even though it seems like people are trying to get her pushed out shes way too tough and smart to leave because the team needs her.,1365033600,,719,4.294117647058823

5235929,5,B00915G6NK,"NCIS-Los Angeles returns for a fourth season, featuring more action-filled episodes.  Fans of the series are likely to enjoy the storylines and the dynamics of a terrific cast.

At the end of Season Three, the NCIS-LA team was left in a bad place, after botching the exchange of a particularly nasty terrorist.  Special Agent G. Callen (Chris O'Donnell) was in polic custody for murder, mysterious Operations Manager Hettie Lange (Linda Hunt) had been forced into retirement, and the rest of the team was in disgrace.  The clever season opener will reveal how the team survived.

A two part episode later in the season offers a peek into the personal life of Sam Hanna (LL Cool J), when an old comrade turns up dead after investigating an alleged Soviet sleeper cell, which just might have smuggled nuclear weapons into the U.S.  An outstanding Christmas episode has the team conducting an investigation on board a Navy ship.  Fans will get to see Hanna and Kensi Blye (Daniela Ruah) in uniform and the rest of the cast at sea, including LAPD detective Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen).  The complicated undercover lives of Callen and Lange will come back to haunt the team more than once in the new season, along with everyone's unfavorite NCIS assistant director Owen Granger (Miguel Ferrar).

Marty Deeks and Kensi Blye will continue the delicate (and humorous)dance of their partnership, which keeps threatening to turn into something else.  Computer geek Nell Jones (Renee Smith) will use unique persuasion to get fellow geek Eric Beale (Barrett Foa) to dress as an elf for a Christmas party.  Peter Cambor will return as Dr. Nate Getz for a difficult episode involving the battle death of a Marine.  Callen and Hanna will continue to set a high standard for risk-taking during an operation.  ""NCIS-LA: The Fourth Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.",1359676800,,1863,4.970967741935484

5235931,3,B00915G6NK,"As many others have done, I would have awarded this 4th season five stars, which like all the other seasons of NCIS LA (and of course, NCIS), deserve 5 ++ star-reviews.  But to my astonished disappointment, the fourth season has two episodes (5 + 6, I believe), a continuation series, involving Soviet sleeper agents, and 8 nuclear bombs hidden in eight of our major cities.

The suspense only builds by the conclusion of the 6th episode, and clearly without the climatic resolution.  So obviously, the 7th episode should have dealt with the resolution of this national emergent, imminent problem (they're still chasing the villain who wishes to sell the old bombs to highest bidders, who could simply detonate them in place).

But guess what, the 7th episode has nothing whatsoever to do with this unresolved, inmminent problem.  It goes off on a completely unrelated tangent, and never returns - as though episodes 5 + 6, had never happened.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  None of the remaining episodes have anything to do the expected conclusion.  How could an entire cast, crew, writers, et. al,. have overlooked such a glaring absence - did they all simultaneously come down with some amamnesia-inducing virus??

As I said, an unbelievablly disappointing oversight in an otherwise brilliantly done series.",1359244800,,1298,5.142857142857143
