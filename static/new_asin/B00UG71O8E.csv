7037291,3,B00UG71O8E,"seems to be a devil movie, it would be better if it is just a mad mind, not some supernatural stuff.",1453507200,,100,3.8095238095238093
7037292,3,B00UG71O8E,"It was okay. A little ""too much"" at the end,  making it difficult to understand as to what was real and what was not.",1453420800,,117,3.875
7037293,4,B00UG71O8E,better than expected.  Typical ending.,1452988800,,38,6.6
7037294,2,B00UG71O8E,Pretty Cheesy.  Low B flick.,1452643200,3,28,4.6
7037295,5,B00UG71O8E,This was an suspenseful film and we all enjoyed watching it.  Pooya did a phenomenal job as Videl and kept us wanting to see where she would show up next or what would happen next.,1440720000,,180,4.142857142857143

7037297,2,B00UG71O8E,Almost forgot what it was about. Just saw it a couple weeks ago. As you can see did not leave much of an impression. I guess I would not say it was horrible just would not see it again. It bounced around too much. Find something else to watch,1454371200,,242,3.9591836734693877
7037298,3,B00UG71O8E,"purposely edited to be confusing,  would have been better told straight forward",1454284800,,79,5.583333333333333
7037299,1,B00UG71O8E,Didn't even finish the movie. I'm an artist and the art work was horrible.  Not worth your time.,1454284800,,96,4.333333333333333
7037300,2,B00UG71O8E,Bad movies..,1454198400,,12,5.5
7037301,3,B00UG71O8E,It was good. Worth the watch.,1454198400,,29,4.0
7037302,2,B00UG71O8E,"I think there may have been some potential, then again it could just have been a poor story to go along with so-so production values and amateur acting. The 'art critic' character summed it up correctly ""...derivative at best...""",1454025600,,229,4.897435897435898
7037303,1,B00UG71O8E,"Low budget used, low brain cells required. It's so poorly constructed you can only blame yourself for indulging. You've been warned!",1453939200,,132,5.333333333333333
7037304,2,B00UG71O8E,I stuck through it.  The one star reviewers are right but I gave it 2 because the house is gorgeous.,1453852800,,100,4.0
7037305,5,B00UG71O8E,excellent thriller,1453680000,,18,8.5
8705556,5,B00UG71O8E,Love to see filmmakers going for it. Haters are probably the fans of the Kardashians and can't appreciate art or grassroots filmmaking. Get real and support filmmaking and working actors. This was entertaining.,1463702400,,210,5.393939393939394
8705557,1,B00UG71O8E,"'artist with issues' recuperates in massive fancy house. does a rubbish paintings. doesnt take her meds but drinks tea from the weird caretaker woman. the only possible good bit was me hoping the 2 women would have sex. no chance, you barely get a glimpse of a bra strap.
then, mysteriously, it just switched off, almost like someone had deliberately turned it off with the TV remote. oh sorry, that was me.",1459468800,,407,4.666666666666667
8705558,1,B00UG71O8E,Couldn't even finish it,1458518400,,23,5.0
8705559,1,B00UG71O8E,"I thought a horror film about an artist might at least have a few interesting visuals, but no. The only artful thing about this movie was the lead actress's eyeliner, overly thick and perfectly applied at all times. Her performance, on the other hand, didn't just telegraph the character's purported emotions; she practically sent up smoke signals, grimacing and rolling her eyes like a spooked horse.

She's in bad company: none of the acting is any good. At one point an art critic character shows up wearing a dark blazer-- and skintight coral pink leggings. Did someone tell the actress she was only going to be shot from the waist up? They lied.

The makeup effects may be the worst I've ever seen in a movie people are expected to pay money to see. There's a witch makeup effect that's worse than you'd get using a Halloween kit. The main character's paintings are lazy and amateurish, and so is every aspect of the filmmaking. This is not worth even a second of your time.",1455667200,2,979,4.620689655172414
8705560,1,B00UG71O8E,"Brie (Britt Bowman) is an artist with daddy issues which we find out about at 53 minutes. She is on meds and travels with her boyfriend Brian (Kevin Wright) to a cottage or a mansion so she can relax and paint. Here they meet Videl (Pooya Mohseni) a woman with a bad Eastern European accent who address people by French titles. Brie ""creates"" paintings that look like they could be properly hung on a refrigerator in a home with a demented child. The whole time there Brie has illusions so as the audience, we never knew what was real and what wasn't and since the story and acting wasn't that great, how could we care? The film ending was idiotic.

This is a low budget film that used cheap voice enhancers. Michael Conroy who wrote and directed this feature also did ""Gabrielle"" with Michael Madsen, a film with a similar feel- except it is a writer who goes to a cabin to create instead of a painter. Conroy needs to stop going to remote cabins to be inspired for scripts because they all come out basically the same.

I thought Britt was laughable in her role, as was Videl and Walter.

Guide: F-bomb. sex. No nudity.",1455494400,4,1121,4.432038834951456
8705561,5,B00UG71O8E,"Love it for what it is people!  A quick thrill that gets crazier than you thought, enjoy.",1455494400,,89,4.235294117647059
8705562,4,B00UG71O8E,I was looking for a good distraction and this movie did not dissapoint. Don't watch it alone. I,1455235200,,95,4.333333333333333
8705563,1,B00UG71O8E,s*** film.,1455148800,,10,4.5
8705564,1,B00UG71O8E,"Brutal Colors should be renamed ""brutal waste of time."" Actors can't act, slow paced with no plot, and the weird music doesn't fit the background. It's a nonsensical movie about an artist trying a different locale to push her artistic drive back the way it "" used to be."" Terrible portrayal in that respect. I would give this movie less than one star if there was such a rating. Terrible! So bad that I had to turn it off about half way, kept thinking it would get better, but it got worse.",1455062400,,490,4.336956521739131
8705565,1,B00UG71O8E,Terrible acting no story line just a neurotic blonde bimbo,1454716800,,58,4.9
