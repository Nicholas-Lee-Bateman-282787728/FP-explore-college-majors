3099294,5,B0012VCMR0,"This is as good as it gets for 50's TV.  Excellent production and great reminiscence.  Can't wait for the other seasons. Robin Hood, along with Naked City and Secret Agent are the best of these ""classic TV"" shows.  They need to put more of the Naked City episodes out there.",1207612800,3,274,4.44
3099295,4,B0012VCMR0,"A more compressed edition than the British Versions offered by Amazon UK.  Three things to note:

#1  The end credits of the episodes do not always match the actual episode, this is the weakness of this version.

#2  The British sets contain less epidodes per dvd, I presume that makes a lower quality dvd, but then again it also means you have to switch it much less to watch them.

#3  If you like me have the Adventures of Robin Hood Vol 1-15 you will noticed one significant difference.  Thre are apparently two different versions of the episode ""The Knight who came for Dinner"".  The primary version (the one I believe was shot first) is on this collection.  In this one Sir Richard owes his mortgage to an Abbot.  In the version in Vol 10 It is to another Knight.  You will see the following differences.

A.  Sir Richard refers to Lady Marion by a different family name in the ""season 1"" version.  In the Vol 10 version it is Fitzwalter which is what is used during the series.  That suggests the Season 1 version was part of a pilot episode one.

B.  In the Vol 10 version you explicatly see the Knight and the Sherif discus the fact that Sir Richard's son really didn't kill the man in question, it is not explained in the other version.

C.  When Robin robs the Abbot in Season 1.  They don't interact, a comidic interplay takes place between Robin and the knight in the Vol 10 version.

D.  The same credits are used for both.  Both reflect the season one stuff.

This isn't an argument against buying this episode but it does make it worth buying the Vol 10 as well.

It is very much worth your money and your time.  Particularly at this price.",1207526400,4,1656,4.37953795379538
3099296,4,B0012VCMR0,"For those not fortunate enough to have grown up with these shows, Richard Greene is probably the second-best Robin Hood ever (Errol Flynn being number one). The rest of the cast all seem right for their roles, too. Stretching the Robin Hood legend out over more than 120 episodes may seem to be a daunting proposition, but each one of these episodes is at the very least a pleasant way to spend half an hour, and the stories are always true to the spirit of the legend.

So what do you get in this set? All 39 episodes of the first season on 3 single-sided discs (not 4 as Amazon currently states), so the eagle-eyed among us will see some artifacts resulting from that much compression. Mill Creek has pulled from a variety of sources: some very worn films, and apparently some previous video releases (even, I suspect, some European releases). You get to see a couple of original sponsor messages (Wild Rood Cream Oil and BandAids) and you are occasionally informed that ""this film was flown from Europe to the US via Pan Am"", with a CBS logo or two. There are also a couple of syndication prints in which the title of the show was changed to ""Richard Greene plays Robin Hood in Adventures in Sherwood Forest"".

Because of the way this set was put together, the physical quality of the shows varies greatly. Some are very dark, others are too contrasty or blown out, and several have a heavy green tint to them. The ones that appear to be sourced from European videos have the best picture quality, but often have a distracting twinkling line on the left edge of the picture (which you may not see, depending on your DVD player and TV set). This set cannot hold a candle to the quality of the DVDs released in the UK, but you'd pay much more for the UK sets.

All in all, for the price, most people will be happy with this set, and Richard Greene's portrayal of Robin Hood is worth seeing. Videophiles or devotees of this series will have to have the outstanding UK DVDs, though.",1206057600,66,1981,4.466850828729282
3099297,5,B0012VCMR0,"This series may well have been aimed at children, but it isn't a live-action cartoon.  The characters are engaging and the plots typical of televison of the era.  This show splits the difference between serious TV dramas and sit-coms.  Our heroes have a problem to overcome, and they inevitably do so.  There is little suspense but lots of fun in going along for the ride.  If being childish means avoiding modern levels of television violence, then I'm all for immaturity.

Serious students of literature or history or archery or fencing will find much to quibble with, but try to accept this series in the spirit with which it was created.  Here we have light entertainment of the first order, so pop some popcorn, relax and enjoy the show.

There are no special features on this 3-DVD set, but with 13 episodes per disc, where could they have put them?  Some of the episodes include a 'brought to you by' sponsor identification in the opening credits, which is quite nostalgic.  Video quality of the source material varies, but is often surprisingly crisp.  I've had no problem with the DVD performance in this set.

At first I thought the price was a terrific bargain, but since that time I've seen this set in the $5 bin at Wal-Mart.  Either way it's a great value for family friendly viewing.",1206057600,11,1298,4.6902654867256635
3099298,4,B0012VCMR0,"It's been years since I've seen any of this show but it was one of my favorites when we got our first TV in 1955. I enjoyed the show thru its original run and liked it in reruns. I'm generally happy with what I've watched on the DVD set of Season 1 so far, and even remember one or two of the episodes. I got a kick seeing Leo McKern in the 1st two episodes, as two different characters, and was amazed to find this was his very first work on the small screen. At any rate, while the opening credits are often dark or grainy, the picture and sound transfer of most episodes seems pretty good and easy to watch. The only negative is the fact that the closing credits don't always match the episode they follow. I've seen this on two episodes so far--in both cases the names of the characters don't match the characters in the episode and on one of them the copyright date was wrong. As long as the episodes themselves are watchable I guess I won't let that bother me too much. I don't know if you would enjoy this if you never saw the series before, but as nostalgia, if you remember the show, it is a good watch, especially for the more than reasonable price.",1205971200,19,1159,4.201793721973094

3099301,2,B0012VCMR0,"I've watched quite a lot of 1950s TV on DVDs in recent years, but when it comes to picture and sound quality, this is by far the worst I've seen. There are spots and specks, and in some scenes you can actually ""hear the projector running."" Other than that, the shows are fairly watchable, though low-budget productions typical of 1950s TV.",1234569600,,339,4.573770491803279
3099302,5,B0012VCMR0,"As an American kid this TV series was ten years before my time. I did have Howard Pyle's classic novel ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"" in one of those Whitman books you could buy from a rack in the drug store. I thoroughly enjoyed reading that, but I have never seen any filmed versions of Robin Hood until now (not counting Mel Brooks' series ""When Things Were Rotten""). I was tempted to watch Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"" but I never did because I suspected the story would be updated for modern prejudices, much like Kevin Sorbo's ""Hercules"" which one reviewer described as ""a surfer dude on his way to a Renaissance fair.""

When I bought this Richard Greene series for five bucks at Wal-Mart, I figured it would be fun, not knowing that I would be both surprised and amazed at the quality of the acting, the writing, and the way it was filmed. It really takes you back into a credible medaeval atmosphere. It may have once been considered a kid's show, but it surely has kept the adults entertained around our house! It also brought back pleasant memories of a time in our culture when writers took romantic heroism seriously, and didn't have to turn everything into tongue-in-cheek ""camp.""

In some circles today it is popular to dis Robin Hood as the world's first socialist, because he ""robbed from the rich to give to the poor.""  If that were true he would be an evil man.  But this TV series sets the record straight by showing that Robin was an avenger of the poor, who only took from the rich what they had previously stolen and returned it to its rightful owners.

And speaking of avengers, I was also a fan of the British television series ""The Avengers.""  The women in that show, Catherine Gale, Emma Peel, and Tara King, all had respectable British properness, but underneath all that was this element of delicious mischief. I am now going to have to add Bernadette O'Farrell's Maid Marian to my mental list of ""Hottest British Women.""

I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this series, and I hope you would be, too!",1231718400,,2062,4.586956521739131

3099304,5,B0012VCMR0,"I purchased this DVD having never seen any of its episodes before.  I didn't even know who Richard Greene was.  Nevertheless, I am a Robin Hood fan and thought I would try it out, at a very affordable price.  I am very pleased with these shows.  They are quite enjoyable.  They take me back to my youth when shows didn't have as much sex, nudity, foul language and graphic violence.  I also find the stories to be enjoyable and have fun watching for actors in different episodes that play different characters.  If you like good clean fun and don't mind the lack of a PG/R rating, I think you will enjoy The Adventures of Robin Hood with Richard Greene (Rated G imho).

P.S. I greatly appreciate the thorough reviews given by other customers, they are incredibly complete!",1231027200,,772,4.583941605839416
3099305,5,B0012VCMR0,"This series pre-dated my birth by a fair number of years, but I've found it to be quite a gem for those who enjoy adventures series that are not obviously altered to appeal to modern audiences. Each episode has a self-contained story which can range from light-hearted to somewhat dark. Of course, this is a television show and it's not true to the reality of the times, though it is probably closer in some ways than lavish movie productions from the same time period (or these days). The actors are all a bit theatrical, but very good in their roles.

One interesting point about this series is that you can see that it clearly influenced other entertainment about the same period of time. Black Adder II, for instance, is clearly modeled upon the basic structure of this show. Some of the stories from Black Adder seem to be parodies of stories from this show.

If you like old adventure movies and don't care about having perfect video quality (though this is eminently watchable), this is great value and a whole lot of fun for a weekend in front of the television.",1229990400,,1070,4.596858638743456
3099306,4,B0012VCMR0,"I found this first season in the $5 bin at Walmart and said ""it's got to be at least worth $5"".  I had never heard of the show before, but being a purveyor of old TV shows I loved it.  This is definitely well worth the price that is on Amazon.  Anyone that grew up watching the Disney version of the Adventures of Robin Hood should like this more realistic version of the stories.  I'm off to buy the second season from Amazon.",1226275200,,427,4.108433734939759
3099307,5,B0012VCMR0,"I bought all the seasons and episodes of Robin Hood.  Like many reviewers, I remember the series as a child (I was 4 when it started and 9 when the series closed).  However, I have to say, I became more and more impressed with Richard Greene as an actor as I watched more into the series.  As every Robin Hood fan knows, Robin Hood (Robyn Hoode) was a medieval legend.  Since Medieval History is the period of my degree in History, I especially look at the series with a critical eye from historical standards as well as by the quality of the acting, which was a very high level.  As everyone who knows anything about the 13th century will tell you, there is no way Bernadette O'Farrell (1st Maid Marian) or Patricia Driscoll (2nd Maid Marion- RADA graduate) would have short hair, be allowed to romp alone through the countryside without a male escort and wear dresses that were designed with the plunging neckline of 1950 in mind.  The tight figure fitting garments, some with zippers and buttons (both of which were not created until several hundred years later) are really out of place.  Usually the figure was given prominence with laces in the back and high necklines, especially in what were usually cold, damp castles and living quarters without central heat.  However, the series is historically accurate when it comes to structures, houses and most of the peasant costumes.

As far as the acting goes, the scripts were very good and this allowed for above level acting that one does not see in present day movies (let alone television).  Next to Errol Flynn, Richard Greene was probably the best Robin Hood.  First of all, he could fence, and so could many of those who appeared with him (Alan Wheatley as the Sheriff of Notingham comes to mind).  Greene was the fencing Captain in what was the English version of an exclusive high school.  Richard Greene also had outstanding pedigree.  These qualities, not the least of which was his outstanding good looks and carriage on the screen, make him not only very believable but also gives depth to his role.  Archie Duncan, as Little John, and Alexander Gauge as Friar Tuck round out an outstanding cast.

Richard Greene stands out because he did have a Hollywood career that looked very promising until WWII, when he returned to England, and by the time he came back, basically his career, as well as his marriage, was over.  As lack of money and timing would have it, when he was approached for this series, he gladly accepted.  He never did too much after that since he made enough money from Robin Hood to basically retire to his country estate in Wexford, Ireland, raise horses,  become a top breeder, and sail his yacht competitively.  It is most unfortunate since I think he could have done so much more with his career.  But, Robin Hood does provide a glimpse at his possiblities.

Another feature of the Robin Hood series is that many of the episodes were written by blacklisted writers that left the US because of the McCarthy era.  There were several episodes written by women as well as those that were written about the ""guilt by association"" that prevailed during that time in the US.  Maid Marian is a very strong woman and one has to think the character was given this strength because of the authors of the episodes, which were women who wrote under several names.

But the series is carried by the acting of Greene, and it does not disappoint.  From the perspective of the historical Robin Hood, it does stick to some of the legends and throws in a few lessons of the McCarthy era to cross time.  All in all, an excellent series with humor.  Greene seemed not to take his characater too seriously, and as such, makes it more realistic.",1212278400,8,3710,4.648773006134969
3099308,5,B0012VCMR0,"I bought Robin Hook out of pure nostalgia, having watched it as a child. What I did not expect was that it would be smart, well-written and well-acted television that compares favourably to anything being done today. Both thumbs up!",1211587200,3,232,4.825

3099312,5,B0012VCMR0,"I agree with the other reviewers that the video quality pales in comparison with today's HD standards, but it is at least as good as that of my 1953 B&W TV set on which I viewed the series originally.  What does one expect for $5?  Isn't more than 16 hours of fun watching enough.

The episodes are exactly the way I remember them from 50 years ago.  I admit to being bias because the series was one of my favorite TV shows as a kid.  However, I find much more to like and appreciate about the series viewing it as an adult in light of what we now have in the way of TV and movies.

1.  The series is a British production, and the use of the English language is superb.

2.  The acting is for the most part excellent.  The sets and sound quality are also generally excellent.  The accents are high British and very understandable to an American listener.  The minstral playing adds a nice touch.

3.  Each episode is a small morality play, not a joke driven sitcom like we have today.  Virtue is extolled.  The unscrupulous Prince John and Sheriff of Nottingham always lose, but one is never sure until the very end of the episode.  Suspense is maintained even though the outcome is certain.

4.  I am not an expert on the theater but the characters are all very real and believable to me.

5.  Each episode is only 25 min long which is the perfect length for me.  I find it very difficult now to devote 90 min or more to a movie.  My schedule requires that I use books on tape rather than reading a novel.  I just do not have the time, so these 25-min episodes are exactly what I need.

Normally, I avoid compilations like this because the quality is so low that they are unwatchable.  I took a chance on this one because of my fond memories of the series.  I was so pleasantly surprised by this set that I immediately went online to buy the rest of the series only to find out that just the first season is currently available.  I look forward to the release of the rest of the series.  I hope Mill Creek Entertainment with offer these soon.",1211155200,5,2043,4.247395833333333

3099314,3,B0012VCMR0,"""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" has quality digital reproduction of a now very old television series. I don't believe it has been digitally remastered so you are seeing the original version. The package has little in the way of extras, commentaries or the other add ons that have made rediscovering the classics such a treat in recent years.

The series is finely acted, has a superb theatre trained cast and well written. Unlike some recent Hollywood and indeed British ""re-imaginings"", it honours and respects the centuries long literary tradition of Robin Hood. Unfortunately, this will mainly be of interest to those who remember the original broadcasts and who are after a nostalgia fix. Still they may be a little disappointed too, the early episodes, especially before Little John, Tuck and Maid Marion are introduced, seem to drag. I didn't realise how many episodes it took to get the 'gang' all together. It was that whole ensemble cast, along with the delightfully crafty Sheriff of Nottingham, who together made the story we remember.

Modern audiences and young people raised on colour, special effects and fast paced action adventures will almost certainly find the series slow and tedious. That's a shame. Special effects and explosive action are great fun but they aren't everything. Maybe they should take the time to read the Adventures of Robin Hood first and then they may appreciate this series better.",1210982400,18,1422,5.098712446351931

3099318,5,B0012VCMR0,"All reviews here are interesting and informative, not much to add. As a kid growing up in the 1950s (I'm 64) some shows not considered prime time were run earlier in the evenings, with this being one. Several British shows ran at various times on TV in Ohio where I grew up, with Mark Sabre, among others, being one, and The Lone Wolf another.

This particular Richard Greene series was one I seldom missed early in the evening prior to my parents watching their prime time shows after 8 pm. Have thought of this series several times down during the years, especially awhile back when I saw Collector's Choice had issued the shows on DVDs. Did not order at that time, but when at a discount store recently just could not pass up this one, and another one on The Cisco Kid from this same Mill Creek. A couple years back in Ohio, had bought a box of 20 John Wayne movies from Mill Creek for only $5 too, and all of those DVDs were well worth that nominal investment.

If one cares for the Robin Hood tales, then these DVDs are a steal. It is only a quarter of the price I shelled out some time back for the Errol Flynn color classic. Watch these cheepies and enjoy.

3333792,4,B0012VCMR0,"A more compressed edition than the British Versions offered by Amazon UK.  Three things to note:

#1  The end credits of the episodes do not always match the actual episode, this is the weakness of this version.

#2  The British sets contain less epidodes per dvd, I presume that makes a lower quality dvd, but then again it also means you have to switch it much less to watch them.

#3  If you like me have the Adventures of Robin Hood Vol 1-15 you will noticed one significant difference.  Thre are apparently two different versions of the episode ""The Knight who came for Dinner"".  The primary version (the one I believe was shot first) is on this collection.  In this one Sir Richard owes his mortgage to an Abbot.  In the version in Vol 10 It is to another Knight.  You will see the following differences.

A.  Sir Richard refers to Lady Marion by a different family name in the ""season 1"" version.  In the Vol 10 version it is Fitzwalter which is what is used during the series.  That suggests the Season 1 version was part of a pilot episode one.

B.  In the Vol 10 version you explicatly see the Knight and the Sherif discus the fact that Sir Richard's son really didn't kill the man in question, it is not explained in the other version.

C.  When Robin robs the Abbot in Season 1.  They don't interact, a comidic interplay takes place between Robin and the knight in the Vol 10 version.

D.  The same credits are used for both.  Both reflect the season one stuff.

This isn't an argument against buying this episode but it does make it worth buying the Vol 10 as well.

It is very much worth your money and your time.  Particularly at this price.",1207526400,4,1656,4.37953795379538
3333793,4,B0012VCMR0,"For those not fortunate enough to have grown up with these shows, Richard Greene is probably the second-best Robin Hood ever (Errol Flynn being number one). The rest of the cast all seem right for their roles, too. Stretching the Robin Hood legend out over more than 120 episodes may seem to be a daunting proposition, but each one of these episodes is at the very least a pleasant way to spend half an hour, and the stories are always true to the spirit of the legend.

So what do you get in this set? All 39 episodes of the first season on 3 single-sided discs (not 4 as Amazon currently states), so the eagle-eyed among us will see some artifacts resulting from that much compression. Mill Creek has pulled from a variety of sources: some very worn films, and apparently some previous video releases (even, I suspect, some European releases). You get to see a couple of original sponsor messages (Wild Rood Cream Oil and BandAids) and you are occasionally informed that ""this film was flown from Europe to the US via Pan Am"", with a CBS logo or two. There are also a couple of syndication prints in which the title of the show was changed to ""Richard Greene plays Robin Hood in Adventures in Sherwood Forest"".

Because of the way this set was put together, the physical quality of the shows varies greatly. Some are very dark, others are too contrasty or blown out, and several have a heavy green tint to them. The ones that appear to be sourced from European videos have the best picture quality, but often have a distracting twinkling line on the left edge of the picture (which you may not see, depending on your DVD player and TV set). This set cannot hold a candle to the quality of the DVDs released in the UK, but you'd pay much more for the UK sets.

All in all, for the price, most people will be happy with this set, and Richard Greene's portrayal of Robin Hood is worth seeing. Videophiles or devotees of this series will have to have the outstanding UK DVDs, though.",1206057600,66,1981,4.466850828729282
3333794,5,B0012VCMR0,"This series may well have been aimed at children, but it isn't a live-action cartoon.  The characters are engaging and the plots typical of televison of the era.  This show splits the difference between serious TV dramas and sit-coms.  Our heroes have a problem to overcome, and they inevitably do so.  There is little suspense but lots of fun in going along for the ride.  If being childish means avoiding modern levels of television violence, then I'm all for immaturity.

Serious students of literature or history or archery or fencing will find much to quibble with, but try to accept this series in the spirit with which it was created.  Here we have light entertainment of the first order, so pop some popcorn, relax and enjoy the show.

There are no special features on this 3-DVD set, but with 13 episodes per disc, where could they have put them?  Some of the episodes include a 'brought to you by' sponsor identification in the opening credits, which is quite nostalgic.  Video quality of the source material varies, but is often surprisingly crisp.  I've had no problem with the DVD performance in this set.

At first I thought the price was a terrific bargain, but since that time I've seen this set in the $5 bin at Wal-Mart.  Either way it's a great value for family friendly viewing.",1206057600,11,1298,4.6902654867256635
3333795,4,B0012VCMR0,"It's been years since I've seen any of this show but it was one of my favorites when we got our first TV in 1955. I enjoyed the show thru its original run and liked it in reruns. I'm generally happy with what I've watched on the DVD set of Season 1 so far, and even remember one or two of the episodes. I got a kick seeing Leo McKern in the 1st two episodes, as two different characters, and was amazed to find this was his very first work on the small screen. At any rate, while the opening credits are often dark or grainy, the picture and sound transfer of most episodes seems pretty good and easy to watch. The only negative is the fact that the closing credits don't always match the episode they follow. I've seen this on two episodes so far--in both cases the names of the characters don't match the characters in the episode and on one of them the copyright date was wrong. As long as the episodes themselves are watchable I guess I won't let that bother me too much. I don't know if you would enjoy this if you never saw the series before, but as nostalgia, if you remember the show, it is a good watch, especially for the more than reasonable price.",1205971200,19,1159,4.201793721973094
3333796,4,B0012VCMR0,"THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD was a half-hour British TV show designed for American export.

3333799,5,B0012VCMR0,"As an American kid this TV series was ten years before my time. I did have Howard Pyle's classic novel ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"" in one of those Whitman books you could buy from a rack in the drug store. I thoroughly enjoyed reading that, but I have never seen any filmed versions of Robin Hood until now (not counting Mel Brooks' series ""When Things Were Rotten""). I was tempted to watch Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"" but I never did because I suspected the story would be updated for modern prejudices, much like Kevin Sorbo's ""Hercules"" which one reviewer described as ""a surfer dude on his way to a Renaissance fair.""

When I bought this Richard Greene series for five bucks at Wal-Mart, I figured it would be fun, not knowing that I would be both surprised and amazed at the quality of the acting, the writing, and the way it was filmed. It really takes you back into a credible medaeval atmosphere. It may have once been considered a kid's show, but it surely has kept the adults entertained around our house! It also brought back pleasant memories of a time in our culture when writers took romantic heroism seriously, and didn't have to turn everything into tongue-in-cheek ""camp.""

In some circles today it is popular to dis Robin Hood as the world's first socialist, because he ""robbed from the rich to give to the poor.""  If that were true he would be an evil man.  But this TV series sets the record straight by showing that Robin was an avenger of the poor, who only took from the rich what they had previously stolen and returned it to its rightful owners.

And speaking of avengers, I was also a fan of the British television series ""The Avengers.""  The women in that show, Catherine Gale, Emma Peel, and Tara King, all had respectable British properness, but underneath all that was this element of delicious mischief. I am now going to have to add Bernadette O'Farrell's Maid Marian to my mental list of ""Hottest British Women.""

I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this series, and I hope you would be, too!",1231718400,,2062,4.586956521739131

Nevertheless, I am a Robin Hood fan and thought I would try it out, at a very affordable price.  I am very pleased with these shows.  They are quite enjoyable.  They take me back to my youth when shows didn't have as much sex, nudity, foul language and graphic violence.  I also find the stories to be enjoyable and have fun watching for actors in different episodes that play different characters.  If you like good clean fun and don't mind the lack of a PG/R rating, I think you will enjoy The Adventures of Robin Hood with Richard Greene (Rated G imho).

3333802,5,B0012VCMR0,"This series pre-dated my birth by a fair number of years, but I've found it to be quite a gem for those who enjoy adventures series that are not obviously altered to appeal to modern audiences. Each episode has a self-contained story which can range from light-hearted to somewhat dark. Of course, this is a television show and it's not true to the reality of the times, though it is probably closer in some ways than lavish movie productions from the same time period (or these days). The actors are all a bit theatrical, but very good in their roles.

One interesting point about this series is that you can see that it clearly influenced other entertainment about the same period of time. Black Adder II, for instance, is clearly modeled upon the basic structure of this show. Some of the stories from Black Adder seem to be parodies of stories from this show.

If you like old adventure movies and don't care about having perfect video quality (though this is eminently watchable), this is great value and a whole lot of fun for a weekend in front of the television.",1229990400,,1070,4.596858638743456

Anyone that grew up watching the Disney version of the Adventures of Robin Hood should like this more realistic version of the stories.  I'm off to buy the second season from Amazon.",1226275200,,427,4.108433734939759
3333804,5,B0012VCMR0,"I bought all the seasons and episodes of Robin Hood.  Like many reviewers, I remember the series as a child (I was 4 when it started and 9 when the series closed).  However, I have to say, I became more and more impressed with Richard Greene as an actor as I watched more into the series.  As every Robin Hood fan knows, Robin Hood (Robyn Hoode) was a medieval legend.  Since Medieval History is the period of my degree in History, I especially look at the series with a critical eye from historical standards as well as by the quality of the acting, which was a very high level.  As everyone who knows anything about the 13th century will tell you, there is no way Bernadette O'Farrell (1st Maid Marian) or Patricia Driscoll (2nd Maid Marion- RADA graduate) would have short hair, be allowed to romp alone through the countryside without a male escort and wear dresses that were designed with the plunging neckline of 1950 in mind.  The tight figure fitting garments, some with zippers and buttons (both of which were not created until several hundred years later) are really out of place.  Usually the figure was given prominence with laces in the back and high necklines, especially in what were usually cold, damp castles and living quarters without central heat.  However, the series is historically accurate when it comes to structures, houses and most of the peasant costumes.

As far as the acting goes, the scripts were very good and this allowed for above level acting that one does not see in present day movies (let alone television).  Next to Errol Flynn, Richard Greene was probably the best Robin Hood.  First of all, he could fence, and so could many of those who appeared with him (Alan Wheatley as the Sheriff of Notingham comes to mind).  Greene was the fencing Captain in what was the English version of an exclusive high school.  Richard Greene also had outstanding pedigree.  These qualities, not the least of which was his outstanding good looks and carriage on the screen, make him not only very believable but also gives depth to his role.  Archie Duncan, as Little John, and Alexander Gauge as Friar Tuck round out an outstanding cast.

Richard Greene stands out because he did have a Hollywood career that looked very promising until WWII, when he returned to England, and by the time he came back, basically his career, as well as his marriage, was over.  As lack of money and timing would have it, when he was approached for this series, he gladly accepted.  He never did too much after that since he made enough money from Robin Hood to basically retire to his country estate in Wexford, Ireland, raise horses,  become a top breeder, and sail his yacht competitively.  It is most unfortunate since I think he could have done so much more with his career.  But, Robin Hood does provide a glimpse at his possiblities.

Another feature of the Robin Hood series is that many of the episodes were written by blacklisted writers that left the US because of the McCarthy era.  There were several episodes written by women as well as those that were written about the ""guilt by association"" that prevailed during that time in the US.  Maid Marian is a very strong woman and one has to think the character was given this strength because of the authors of the episodes, which were women who wrote under several names.

But the series is carried by the acting of Greene, and it does not disappoint.  From the perspective of the historical Robin Hood, it does stick to some of the legends and throws in a few lessons of the McCarthy era to cross time.  All in all, an excellent series with humor.  Greene seemed not to take his characater too seriously, and as such, makes it more realistic.",1212278400,8,3710,4.648773006134969

3333809,5,B0012VCMR0,"I agree with the other reviewers that the video quality pales in comparison with today's HD standards, but it is at least as good as that of my 1953 B&W TV set on which I viewed the series originally.  What does one expect for $5?  Isn't more than 16 hours of fun watching enough.

The episodes are exactly the way I remember them from 50 years ago.  I admit to being bias because the series was one of my favorite TV shows as a kid.  However, I find much more to like and appreciate about the series viewing it as an adult in light of what we now have in the way of TV and movies.

1.  The series is a British production, and the use of the English language is superb.

2.  The acting is for the most part excellent.  The sets and sound quality are also generally excellent.  The accents are high British and very understandable to an American listener.  The minstral playing adds a nice touch.

3.  Each episode is a small morality play, not a joke driven sitcom like we have today.  Virtue is extolled.  The unscrupulous Prince John and Sheriff of Nottingham always lose, but one is never sure until the very end of the episode.  Suspense is maintained even though the outcome is certain.

4.  I am not an expert on the theater but the characters are all very real and believable to me.

5.  Each episode is only 25 min long which is the perfect length for me.  I find it very difficult now to devote 90 min or more to a movie.  My schedule requires that I use books on tape rather than reading a novel.  I just do not have the time, so these 25-min episodes are exactly what I need.

Normally, I avoid compilations like this because the quality is so low that they are unwatchable.  I took a chance on this one because of my fond memories of the series.  I was so pleasantly surprised by this set that I immediately went online to buy the rest of the series only to find out that just the first season is currently available.  I look forward to the release of the rest of the series.  I hope Mill Creek Entertainment with offer these soon.",1211155200,5,2043,4.247395833333333

3333811,3,B0012VCMR0,"""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" has quality digital reproduction of a now very old television series. I don't believe it has been digitally remastered so you are seeing the original version. The package has little in the way of extras, commentaries or the other add ons that have made rediscovering the classics such a treat in recent years.

The series is finely acted, has a superb theatre trained cast and well written. Unlike some recent Hollywood and indeed British ""re-imaginings"", it honours and respects the centuries long literary tradition of Robin Hood. Unfortunately, this will mainly be of interest to those who remember the original broadcasts and who are after a nostalgia fix. Still they may be a little disappointed too, the early episodes, especially before Little John, Tuck and Maid Marion are introduced, seem to drag. I didn't realise how many episodes it took to get the 'gang' all together. It was that whole ensemble cast, along with the delightfully crafty Sheriff of Nottingham, who together made the story we remember.

Modern audiences and young people raised on colour, special effects and fast paced action adventures will almost certainly find the series slow and tedious. That's a shame. Special effects and explosive action are great fun but they aren't everything. Maybe they should take the time to read the Adventures of Robin Hood first and then they may appreciate this series better.",1210982400,18,1422,5.098712446351931

This particular Richard Greene series was one I seldom missed early in the evening prior to my parents watching their prime time shows after 8 pm. Have thought of this series several times down during the years, especially awhile back when I saw Collector's Choice had issued the shows on DVDs. Did not order at that time, but when at a discount store recently just could not pass up this one, and another one on The Cisco Kid from this same Mill Creek. A couple years back in Ohio, had bought a box of 20 John Wayne movies from Mill Creek for only $5 too, and all of those DVDs were well worth that nominal investment.

If one cares for the Robin Hood tales, then these DVDs are a steal. It is only a quarter of the price I shelled out some time back for the Errol Flynn color classic. Watch these cheepies and enjoy.

 Robin Hood, Robin Hood and his band of men

It's hilarious at times: sets are made of cardboard, actors are reused multiple times in different roles in the same episode, the jokes are dire, the continuity is clunky and so on. But some of the actors are superb, many of them well-known Shakespearean performers. Top notch. Stick a pig on a spit, crack open a barrel of malmsey wine and put your feet up.",1471046400,,425,4.325

8248011,5,B0012VCMR0,"This series is probably the first introduction many Baby Boomers had to the Robin Hood legend, and having been filmed in England (though often, lamentably, with sound-stage ""exteriors""), it has the great virtue of being true to the legend.  Richard Greene plays Robin of Locksley, a Saxon nobleman (one of the few whose family managed to hold onto their ancestral lands after the Norman Conquest of 1066), who returns from the Third Crusade (probably in 1192) to find his manor taken over by a Norman knight, and flees to Sherwood Forest.  There he falls in with a band of outlaws and is acclaimed its leader after the original chief is killed.  Several of these first-season episodes follow the recruitment of his major followers, including Little John (played mostly by Archie Duncan but occasionally by Rufus Cruikshank) and the stout, scholarly Friar Tuck (Alexander Gauge).  Bernadette O'Farrell plays the spirited Lady Marian Fitzwalter, who often dons boy's clothes to go hunting with Robin or bring him vital news, and Alan Weatley plays the Sheriff of Nottingham, a rather handsome, silver-haired fellow with a fondness for studded leather clothing and an eye for Marian.  Ian Hunter appears in several segments as the middle-aged, cash-strapped Sir Richard of the Lea, who, like Marian, is a friend to the outlaws.  (""The Knight Who Came to Dinner,"" which introduces him, should really be on Disc 1, and so should ""The Thorkil Ghost,"" while the several episodes featuring King Richard Lionheart are scrambled terribly: for best comprehension they should be viewed in this order: ""The Traitor,"" ""The Wanderer,"" ""The Prisoner,"" and ""Richard the Lionheart."")

Robin deals with challenges that range from the Sheriff's plots to accusations of witchcraft against the mother of one of his men to a plague of ""St. Anthony's fire"" (ergot poisoning) and Prince John's attempts to seize the throne, with lots of disguises and athletic sword-fights.  The picture quality varies from one episode to the next, but all are at least viewable and some are really excellent, considering how old the originals were.  There are occasional incongruities (such as nobles travelling without a train of servants and bodyguards, or peasants living in part-stone houses), some actors turn up in different roles from one segment to another (including one who doubles as Derwent, a member of Robin's band), and sometimes the cast list doesn't match the characters in the story.  But the songs and dances have a very Medieval sound to them, and there are good costumes and some impressive sets.  On the whole it's an enjoyable series, and I plan to acquire the remaining seasons as soon as finances allow.",1284422400,,2687,5.1118721461187215
8248012,5,B0012VCMR0,"The quality of the dvd's varies. I found the shows on the second disc to have a much clearer picture but that doesn't take away from the fun of watching it. After a slight initial disappointment I became so wrapped up in the show that I no longer paid much attention to the lack of clarity. I do hope they do a restored version sometime. Since I got it for $5 I think it was worth the cost.  Richard Greene makes a fine Robin. The rest of the cast is very good as well.
I have to add that that song is now running through my head constantly......oh well, at least I like it.",1252713600,,574,4.035087719298246
