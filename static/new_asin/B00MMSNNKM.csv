8673087,4,B00MMSNNKM,"David Blyth has created a nice, steady psychological dilemma in Ghost Bride that really draws on the conflicts of cultural past and individual present that is a very real, and very murky journey for many young people today. To abide by the ways of the ancestors or forge an independent path for ones self. Then throw in a sinister match maker with ulterior motives and the paranormal, and soon things get down right deadly. This is a really well crafted ghost story and the cast do great jobs and bringing these characters to life on screen. The film does rely completely on melodrama and personal conflict for most of the suspense so the thrills are a bit more subdued than one would expect going into the film. Just a note for anyone setting out to watch-not a criticism.

The special effects are minimal, a few quick frame switch moments meant to create a supernatural element, mostly practical stuff, with very minimal CGI. This isn't like the bigger budget Asian ghost stories with heavy-dark- effects that get chilling. Ghost Bride takes a more casual, restrained approach where the macabre nature of the story, unease of character situations, and a steady instrumental overture combine to tale a story of tragedy, desire, and struggle. Blyth presents us with a mature, respectful story that revolves around Eastern folklore, and familial guilt. (And I thought Western mothers knew how to milk the guilt thing.)

Overall Ghost Bride is a strong story that is told with nearly perfect continuity. The beginning is a straight forward set-up that sets the tone for the whole film. There are moments that get confusing in the middle section that could have been tied in better-mostly with the introduction to the ghost element that doesnt really solidify until the last act. Of course my confusion could have been purely cultural differences and me not fully getting the Chinese traditions. This is a nice, mellow ghost story that never really escalates or falters far from the even tempo so no major chills or thrills are present. That was a bit of a bummer for me personally, but still Ghost Bride is a nice little macabre film.",1431907200,,2132,4.854395604395604
8673088,2,B00MMSNNKM,"The writers did there part. They told us a story. Now when it came to bring it to life that's the actor's and actress job. Bring life to the  scree, fell with the sweet taste of love, taste the bitterness that sadness brings; joyfulness of life and the horrors that death can bring. Acting is one thing but making use believe it on screen is totally a different  thing. This can be a great movie, actors have to start from somewhere but not here. You have to bring it to life and make it live.",1419120000,,493,4.178947368421053
8673089,2,B00MMSNNKM,"Ghost Bride gives us a rare glimpse at the cross cultural relationship problems between two young people when their backgrounds are from the East and West and there happens to be a ghost involved.  The film had great potential, but unfortunately, it falls flat.

In the story, Jason, a second generation Chinese man, living in New Zealand, is faced with a dilemma. His mother is sick and  wants to make sure he's married off to a traditional Chinese bride. She believes only a Chinese girl will understand the obligations that will be expected from Jason and his new wife.

The only problem is, Jason is already involved with a Caucasian girl named Sky.  In fact, he hides this information from his mother, who schedules a meeting with a Chinese match maker named Madam Ying.  Jason begrudgingly goes to the meeting, after his mother reminds him of his duty to her and his deceased father. While there, he meets his future  bride, Mei Ling. She appears to be the perfect match for him, from a traditional perspective. But Jason can't forget about Sky and he has no intention of going through with the wedding.

The plot thickens however, when we discover that Mei Ling is already dead. Once he realizes this, he tries to hide that fact from Sky, but paranormal occurrences  throw that plan out the window.

Eventually Sky and Jason realize that Mei Ling has no intention of letting him go, as they struggle to free themselves of her grasp. A few twists and turns occur, until things sort themselves out, I won't spoil it for you.

 Well I really wanted to like this movie. In fact, I liked the premise it was based on. Having a film that focused on the struggles of a second generation Chinese guy, when he's  drawn to his new culture, was interesting to me. The only problem is, the film wasn't executed very well.

For one, Jason and Sky's acting was mediocre at best. And neither of them  had any on screen chemistry. I never sensed that they were into each other at all. Additionally, the horror aspect was weak. There were plenty of times where Mei Ling could be seen creeping around, but she just wasn't  scary.

The film did jump me a couple of times, due to two jump scares. But they weren't enough to make the film creepy. Add to that the poor camera angles used throughout the film and you had a recipe for disaster.

One of the redeeming qualities in the movie, however, was Madam Ying. Her acting was fairly good and her role as the match maker, made the story more interesting. She was the most mysterious character by far. But she was barely used for some reason. I think if she had been in the film more, it might have made a difference. She was the only actor who could carry a scene. It was a shame that she didn't contribute more.

So in the end, I only gave the film two stars. One of them for the attempt at making a Chinese, cross cultural, ghost story. The other for Madam Ying, who was one of the few saving graces in the project. But overall, Ghost Bride was a low budgeted, poorly acted film, that doesn't  hit any of the right spots. It will likely due as a rental for most people, if you're interested in it at all.",1418688000,2,3142,4.450261780104712
8673090,3,B00MMSNNKM,"This listing is confusing. Amazon has merged reviews for two separate films. Some reviews are not for this film but another special effects film by the same name. The film this review is for is the New Zealand film.

Jason (Yoson An) is a young Chinese immigrant raised in New Zealand. His father has passed on and his mother (Catheryn Wu) clings to the old ways. His mother arranges a marriage with a match maker/fortune teller (Geeling Ng- David Bowe's ""Little China Girl"" in video). She matches him up with May-Ling (Fiona Feng) who looks like a porcelain doll. The problem is that Jason has a Barbie Doll girlfriend in Skye (Rebekah Palmer).

The theme is stated that a woman who dies unwed, doesn't have a husband in the afterlife which is a bad thing. You quickly discover that May-Ling isn't exactly alive, although her ghost can interact like a live person from time to time.

The film is refreshing that it breaks from the normal film formula. While I praise the film for its differences, the horror aspect was light. IMDB list the film as a fantasy/thriller which is more accurate.

Parental Guidance: No bad language. No sex. Shower butt nudity (Rebekah Palmer). 3 1/2 stars.",1407974400,,1186,4.714975845410628
