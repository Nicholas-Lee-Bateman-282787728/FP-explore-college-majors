8616112,1,B00FJT1FB0,I should have read it better.  I thought the DVD came with 7 workouts and this one came with only 3.,1441670400,,100,3.761904761904762
8616113,2,B00FJT1FB0,"First, I'm a big user of home workout DVDs, as I live in the country, have two kids under 5 and don't have time for gym trips, so I've done my fair share of them. The beach setting is what sold me on this DVD (and was the only reason I gave it two stars ) but I was sadly let down by the actual workouts. The moves were (as another reviewer stated) ridiculous, awkward and they just kind of roll into the next move, not counting, making you awkwardly scramble to follow along. Personally, they both seem like a blast to be friends or hang with BUT the whole silly, carefree vibe throughout the workout was really annoying (cue the cheesy, slumber-party vibe dancing sequence) and took away from getting motivated to do a kick butt workout. I just couldn't take them serious, like they knew what they were doing. I know they have killer bodies and obviously work out but the point is the way they present themselves was distracting, not motivating. I personally love Jillian Michaels, Tracy Anderson, Winsor Pilates DVDs and was looking for another good workout (preferably with good scenery by the ocean) to throw in the mix to keep it fresh, but this will not be one of them. Take away the annoying-ness of it, I still feel that the actual workout is a joke. Oh and I REALLY didn't need a billion water breaks! Way too fragmented for me. Sad because the setting is gorgeous!!",1440028800,2,1376,4.464285714285714
