8584230,3,B00CP4S84Y,"While it has some good things in it, it is mostly an advertisement for a DVD series that is, apparently, out of print and a website that does not appear to be maintained.",1463184000,,170,4.181818181818182
8584231,5,B00CP4S84Y,"I was a bartender years ago and I wish I would have had this DVD.  Now that I am out of the business I just wanted to learn a couple of tricks that I could use at home.  This DVD can be used to learn just a few tricks or many.  I have learned about 5 tricks now.  In other words, some are complicated and others are simple.  If you are going to be a bartender, or even if you are one, this DVD could make you money.  I would also think that you could learn these tricks along with the drinks and demonstrate a few during an interview.  This is not a cost, it is an investment.",1428624000,,576,3.830508474576271

8584234,1,B00CP4S84Y,"The whole first CD is mostly a bunch of talking, very little instruction.  Second one, pretty boring as well.  I would not recommend this to a potential trainee, which is what I did.  It put him in a coma (figure of speech) it was so boring.",1395964800,,241,4.195652173913044
8584235,5,B00CP4S84Y,"There is something to be said for a series that teaches SO many moves in slow motion so you can actually learn them. The host, Scott Young, is a great instructor and the material he's teaching is excellent. If you are already a FLAIR performer, this might be a bit basic, but it does say for 0-2 years of experience. If that's where you are in the process, you will walk away from this series learning a lot, certainly enough to start increasing tips destined for your pocket.",1375401600,3,476,4.420454545454546
