1343810,5,B00004RF74,"This series, originally produced for Showtime, is far and away the best and most faithful adaptation of Raymond Chandler's writing.  Powers Boothe shines as the cynical, world-weary Philip Marlowe, with excellent support from the rest of the cast.  If you are a fan of Chandler or hard-boiled detective stories, you owe it to yourself to see these shows.  My only complaint is that they aren't also offered on DVD!",975110400,11,414,4.971014492753623
1343811,4,B00004RF74,"The PHILIP MARLOWE, PRIVATE EYE COLLECTION, harkens back to a time when a weary Shamus entered his office only to find the desperate, leggy blonde in distress.  Considered edgy for its day, this HBO production is certainly mild by today's standards.  It was made before HBO hoisted the mantra of the gay and socialist agendas.  As such, it remains as one of their better productions.

This collection features eleven tales direct from the pen of Raymond Chandler.  Powers Boothe is excellent as Marlowe, capturing the hard-boiled mien of the genre.  The picture for this video collection is not as sharp as it should be for DVD.  This could be due to the quality of the originals, or could be a copying deficiency by Goldhil Productions.  While the discs are watchable, definition lines are often blurred causing some colors to run.  Its a DVD, but its similar to watching a VHS tape.  For this reason, I cut off one star on what otherwise would have been a top rating.",1274313600,3,969,4.714285714285714
1343812,5,B00004RF74,Another great series that there is never enough of. Powers Booth plays a great Philip Marlow.  The setting of 1930's L.A is superb and the stories are excellent.  This was another series I only wished they had made more of and it would be nice to find season one on DVD or VHS.,1266624000,,277,4.2075471698113205
1343813,5,B00004RF74,I loved this series on HBO many years ago. I had some episodes taped on VHS but they started to degrade. This DVD set is a wonderful replacement. It's still fun to watch them once or twice a year. Most DVD's are watched once and reside on a shelf until the owner dies. Not this set!,1261526400,,282,4.053571428571429
1343814,5,B00004RF74,I especially like this product because these are actual Raymond Chandler stories. I have read them once but I plan to read each one again and compare them with this production. I'm sure they will be close.,1244851200,2,205,4.5675675675675675
1343815,5,B00004RF74,"I LOVE this series! I accidentally clicked across an episode on PBS one night and was stunned by its accuracy and quality! I watched all the episodes PBS showed but when I went to find it on DVD I discovered that it had been discontinued by the distributor! I quickly ordered one I had found on Amazon.com and when it arrived I immediately put it into the player and started running through the episodes.  Just like any other series some episodes are better than others, but there isn't a single episode I don't like.

I am utterly impressed by the production values of this series! Everything from the look and feel of the visuals to the sets and locations to the acting and actors to the music is true to the genre and period and to Raymond Chandler's books!

I started out as a fan of Chandler's books, as well as stories of others of the genre such as Sam Spade, Bulldog Drummond and Johnny Dollar. Then I began collecting hundreds of the late 1940's and 50's radio shows called ""The Adventures of Philip Marlowe"", which although are loose interpretations of Chandler's stories, I fell in love with never the less. Then I found this HBO T.V. series! I didn't think that anyone would ever be able to equal the acting of Gerald Mohr's portrayal of Philip Marlowe in the radio series, but actor Powers Boothe who portrays Marlowe in this DVD series changed my mind! He is perfect for the role! He brings all the swagger, toughness, sex appeal and period behaviorisms to the role in full measure. I haven't been impressed by much else that I have seen of Powers Boothe's work, but if this series is any indication he is a much better actor than I ever thought. Everything about this series takes you back to that time period and puts you right there along with Philip Marlowe. The stories are gripping and suspenseful. One of the nice things about Chandler's ""Marlowe"" is that he is a flawed, almost anti-hero. He loses many battles but usually wins the war and he isn't afraid to bend if not break the rules a little to get to the truth. He gets his mouth busted a lot but gives back just as good. Yeah, he always falls a bit for the girl, and there is ALWAYS a girl, but in the end, Marlowe is street and life wise enough to know when to send the girl packing. His girls are almost always damaged or slightly dangerous. He is a knight in tarnished armor who rarely ever comes out too far on top, especially when it comes to money. But he always wins the war of right and wrong and makes crime a harder business for the criminals.

This set has all 11 episodes made for the series. This series was made when HBO was still producing some great TV and made-for-cable movies! HBO had a lot of money at the time, and it shows. It was well spent on great sets, locations, costumes and cars and some great period acting, especially by it's star, Powers Boothe. The series has two different opening and closing credit sequences which basically cut the series in two, the first five episodes being created in 1983 and the last six in 1986. The first credits sequence was a bit more ""in your face"" with screeching horn music, gangster silhouettes firing Tommy Guns and very stylized images of Philip Marlowe loading and firing his revolver. The second credits sequence is much more subdued and fit's the genre better in my opinion. It has a simple shadowed background and much softer but sexier horn music. It makes one imagine Philip Marlowe sitting in a night club, sipping a scotch and smoking a cigarette while staring at a dame from across the room. What is in between the opening and closing credits is even better!

I am thrilled to have been able to get one of these sets before they are impossible to get! I suggest to anyone who is a fan of the 30's & 40's detective story genre, in particular of Philip Marlowe, that they get this set while they can too! It is an amazing series and at an incredibly reasonable price. Don't miss your chance to own this set! I hope the studio will re-release this series in the future but you never know for sure!",1227830400,8,4049,4.451482479784366
1343816,5,B00004RF74,"The 3 DVD, 11 episode set of Philip Marlowe Private Eye is a very sweet collection of adaptations from Chandler's short stories.  Personally I prefer both Chandler and Dashiell Hammett in short story form and so found this to be an enjoyable series.

A problem with adapting a short story to movie length is filling the time slot. This is a slippery slope as seen with 2002's NO GOOD DEED (A House In Turk Street) which devolved so far away from the original story that it was unrecognizable. So keeping to a 1 hour or less format is perfect for the shorts.

As with the TV production of Hammett's ""The Dain Curse"", the Marlowe series does suffer from the type of flat lighting that was typical of the late 70s and early 80s.  I think a part of the appeal of watching an adaptation of a hard-boiled story is seeing it lit in a ""noir"" atmosphere, using light and shadow to add texture to the storytelling. A later Noir/Hard-boiled series on HBO called FALLEN ANGELS did a great job with the lighting and settings.

 But aside from the bland lighting, the stories are told in a terse and entertaining style.  Powers Booth makes for a good Marlowe, (though in the earlier episodes his hat is too small for his head!).",1221609600,4,1214,4.490909090909091
1343817,5,B00004RF74,"A series that ran on HBO in 5 episodes in 1983 and an additional 6 in 1986, it is probably the best adaption of Raymond Chandler's world weary private eye of them all.  Boothe is terrific.  The first season the titles are by the renowned Maurice Binder (who did all the best James Bond credits) and many directed by Peter Hunt (Bond film editor and the director of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE).  The second season has new people behind the scenes and new music but there is still Boothe as Marlowe.",1221436800,2,502,4.434782608695652
1343818,3,B00004RF74,"Indeed Powers Boothe is perhaps the best Marlowe and he alone makes the series totally worthwhile. All of the shows are enjoyable but the supporting acting is very uneven. The first 4 shows of the series also show a very limited budget and the video transfers are not the best. However, if you can put these issues aside you are in for a treat as Philip Marlowe comes alive on the screen.",1167609600,4,388,4.402777777777778
1343819,3,B00004RF74,"HBO's Philip Marlowe series is an accurate and enjoyable adaptation of Raymond Chandler's short stories. Some people consider it the most accurate screen adaptation of Marlowe available.

That said, the digital transfer on this edition is mediocre at best, and this should be considered ""For hardcore fans only"".",1164585600,13,312,5.5
1343820,4,B00004RF74,"Overall quality was good.  First three were the best and went a little downhill thereafter.  If you are a fan of Raymond Chandler, Dashell Hammett, or Erle Stanley Gardner's early work, you will love these 1930's rough and tumble, always a last minute surprise detective stories.",1162944000,3,279,5.043478260869565
1343821,4,B00004RF74,"Raymond Chandler practically invented the detective noire genre with his Phillip Marlowe novels and stories.  The trench coat.  The fedora.  The monotone first-person narration and the cynical outlook on life.  They all started with Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe.

So it's only appropriate that several actors have brought Phillip Marlowe to life over the years, most notably James Garner and Humphrey Bogart.

It's hard not to keep Humphrey Bogart's portrayal in mind when watching a Phillip Marlowe mystery, and most actors understandably pale by comparison.  That said, Powers Boothe still does a worthy job.  He perfectly portrays Phillip Marlowe as a cynical private investigator with a tough exterior but a heart of gold.

The episodes of ""Phillip Marlowe: Private Eye"" are filled with clever twist and turns, exciting gun fights, and plenty of tough-talking wise guys.  If nothing else, it will inspire you to seek out the writings of Raymond Chandler.",1149897600,8,964,5.366666666666666
1343822,5,B00004RF74,"I was watching my old tapes of this series last night. I taped it off HBO, and loved it. The tapes are worn and stretched, so I thought I'd check to see if the series was available on DVD. God bless Goldhl!!

Powers Boothe is, without a doubt, the best Marlowe ever. Bogart was good, but he's more of a Sam Spade than a Philip Marlowe. Powers Boothe managed to take an icon, and not exactly breathe new life into it, but breathe Chandler's vision of Marlowe into it. I had a difficult time at first with Kathryn Leigh Scott, since I kept seeing her as Maggie Evans in Dark Shadows. But once I got past that, she was actually quite good. The sets and costumes are certainly authentic, the cars are fabulous, and the music, with it's wonderful jazz bass line, sets the tone magnificently.

I just wish they had the funds to do all of Chandler's short stories.

Very very very highly recommended. I only gave this five stars because Amazon doesn't give the option to give six.",1135036800,32,973,4.394444444444445
1343823,3,B00004RF74,"The problem with this set is that it was a made-for-TV production and they just didn't have the money to do it right.  The sets are mostly dull, the actors drive back and forth over the same stretch of road and in the early episodes the night scenes are obviously shot during the day.  Noir experts will note that many props are not from the correct era.  The later episodes are a bit better than the earlier ones, however.

If you're looking for modern/retro noir there is some.  Farewell My Lovely with Robert Mitchum is wonderful, as are Cast A Deadly Spell and Witchunt.  Modern semi-noir films for those weary of happy endings include The Two Jakes and The Hot Spot.

But why not just get a copy of Out Of The Past and see the real thing?",1134691200,15,743,4.340579710144928
1343824,5,B00004RF74,"Powers Boothe makes a good Marlowe, and the productions are true to the source material, well written and entertaining.",1123545600,7,119,5.315789473684211
1343825,4,B00004RF74,"Granted, if you are an audio geek, you might have problems with the sound transfer, but as far as the stories and the depiction of Chandler's characters, the work on these productions is generally spot on. There are a few liberties taken with the stories, but for the most part, the writers stay pretty close to the source material. Powers Boothe is indeed the definitie Marlowe, projecting the right balance of tough-guy attitude and intellect. The attention to the decore and period atmosphere is top notch as well. Certainly, each episode carries some of the limitations of the TV medium, whether it be in some of the writing, directing or acting, but for every one of these, there are always a few more scenes that are dead perfect. Four stars all the way.",1104019200,7,760,4.7218045112781954
1343826,2,B00004RF74,"Without doubt, Powers Boothe is Philip Marlowe!  The stories are good, the dialogue is snappy, the productions not bad at all.  But...for the price, the sound is awful.  Buyer beware. These discs should be recalled and replaced.  In this digital age, for a DVD to get by with such sound means someone is out to rip you off.  Do not buy this set. What a shame!",1102550400,15,359,4.378787878787879
1343827,1,B00004RF74,"Since this was an HBO production I assumed, incorrectly, that they would be closed captioned but no, they are not.",1097020800,4,114,4.75
1343828,5,B00004RF74,"Powers Boothe is perhaps the best Marlowe ever, and that's saying a lot.  He's smart, world-weary, and sardonic, tossing off Chandler's scintillating lines with aplomb.  Talking about an upwardly mobile lowlife, Marlowe remarks, ""The guy had a mansion in Bel Air and all the old-world charm of a cop beating up a drunk.""

This DVD set includes all 11 episodes of the HBO series: the five from 1983 and the six from 1986.  The 1986 episodes have cheesy opening titles and closing credits, but possess a much stronger noir sensibility than the earlier eps (fine as those are).  Classic noir chiaroscuro is much in evidence in the later installments, while the first five eps are slightly marred by conventional studio lighting. Throughout the series, attention to detail is excellent.  The darker shades of 1938 Los Angeles are vividly brought to life.

One oddity: the sound is weirdly unbalanced in a few episodes.  However, two versions of the soundtrack are provided (Dolby 5.1 and 2.0), and at least one of the two is always fine.

Enthusiastically recommended in any case.",1096416000,83,1076,4.966480446927374
1343829,3,B00004RF74,"I agree that Powers Boothe is perhaps the best Philip Marlowe ever, and HBO obviously paid attention to detail in ensuring period-accurate sets, costumes, and props, but Goldhil (the manufacturer of the DVDs) has no business selling a product (that cost over $50, mind you) they did not even bother to pass through a quality assurance step.

In stereo mode (I can't vouch for the multichannel mix, because I haven't listened to it, although I imagine most people will listen to it in stereo), a couple of the episodes have objectionable sound.  In one episode, the audio is panned more to one side than the other, which can be remedied by listening in mono.  On another episode, there are serious audio phasing and delay problems (perhaps due to incorrect use of the software used to create the DVD data stream), which makes the episode completely unwatchable (again, the multichannel mix might not exhibit this).  Unfortunately, both these episodes are from the earlier set of HBO productions, which are my favorites.

Apparently Goldhil needs a quality assurance department.  Shame on them.",1095897600,17,1092,5.038888888888889
1343830,4,B00004RF74,"There's no denying that this is beautiful collection of episodes from a well done series. They are ""neo-noir"" at it's best. Powers Boothe is among the best Marlowes. Regrettably this collection is incomplete. There were 11 episodes in the series and this collection only contains six. I don't know if this was preventable by Goldhil. I do know that three or four of those other 5 have been released on video at one time but have since been discontinued.",984268800,8,453,4.746835443037975

7921332,5,B00004RF74,"""Philip Marlowe, Private Eye"" aired oh HBO while I was a graduate theology student in Lexington, KY!  I WAS HOOKED!!!  I'd watch repeats of episodes I'd already seen - SEVERAL times!  I was hopeful when I saw that the series is available as a box-set.  That is until I saw the freaking price!!!  $89 for the set?  Are you s***ting me???  It was a great series, but not THAT great!  Ya see, over the years I have checked HBO Video Library, and not once was ""Philip Marlowe, Private Eye' even LISTED.  And now it turns up on Amazon for essentially NINETY BUCKS??  I don't THINK so.  Sheesh!  Maybe it'll turn up on e-Bay....",1478908800,,622,4.407079646017699
7921333,5,B00004RF74,"I agree that Powers Boothe was the best Marlowe. Chandler himself liked Dick Powell best, but he died before he had a chance to see Boothe or, for that matter, Robert Mitchum in the role. I loved the sepia-toned noir Mitchum version, although it didn't follow the book accurately. But I'm confused. I have a Boothe 2-DVD set called ""Season 1,"" and it has only 6 episodes of about 50 minutes in length each, and the volume level is very low. Was there a Season 2?  I wasn't aware of an ""inferior"" 1983 production, but I'm wondering how I can get the remaining episodes from wherever apart from this costly set from Amazon, and would it even be complete?

7921337,5,B00004RF74,"I really enjoyed this series, mostly of Raymond Chandlers earlier shorter stories that were not made into feature length films.  Powers Booth is an excellent phillip marlowe, the dialogue is preserved well from the written stories.  On the outside the stories might seem a little complicated, they are not filmed like other mysteries where the viewer can try to guess the overall MO and/or identity of the murderer(s). And alot happens in a short time, leaving the viewer with few clues.  The REAL DEAL is always left until the end and only Phillip Marlowe can figure it out!  The quality of the DVD is ok.  There are no subtitles, or closed captioning (it wouldn't work on my TV anyway), sometime you have to rewind and turn up the volume to catch the clever quips.  In one story, for instance, a lady is passed out and snoring.  Well the snoring isn't just quiet background noise, it makes it hard to hear the actual dialogue of the two persons in the room with her.  Is this a DVD flaw or on purpose by the film makers to emphasize her loud snoring?? I'm not sure but it makes the scene unforgettable.",1313798400,4,1104,4.540404040404041
7921338,3,B00004RF74,"I have to say that I'm surprised about the glowing reviews I see here on this series. I'm a fan of the genre and of the Marlowe books, movies and radio series, and this TV series just doesn't do it for me. The stories as presented are not gripping, the acting is typical television quality - a step down from film - and Boothe's Marlowe is... adequate. For me, he looks the part, but there's no there there. The best Marlowe ever? Gerald Mohr blew him away on radio, never mind Bogart or Powell. I just don't know where the love for Boothe comes from here. Maybe just hearing him occasionally recite dialogue from the Chandler stories does the trick for some people. And adding a female sidekick? The role of Effie in the Sam Spade radio show was a perfectly good addition to the non-canonical stories, but she was kept in the introductions and summations. Adding a woman helper in investigations just goes against the Marlowe character.

I got this DVD set from the library, and I doubt I'll watch all the episodes. I find myself hitting Pause and walking away to surf the Net or do dishes. There's no sense forcing myself to watch them all just to prove a point. I'm giving the set three start just because there's not a lot bad about the series. But I'm not recommending them to fans of Marlowe either. Two and a half start would be more like it. And just to show that I'm not the only one, this is the first web page I found when I searched 'Philip Marlowe actors:' ""Dishonorable mention goes to Powers Boothe - the only lasting impression his HBO series made on me is that his fedora was a size or two too small.""",1313625600,4,1618,4.3754152823920265
7921339,4,B00004RF74,"The Philip Marlowe series is an old time radio show put to film.  The only thing wrong with the series is that there wasn't more shows.  I have seen some other reports where people have complained about the music in the introduction, personally I like the music.  These shows were not supposed to take place in a modern setting.  It would seem out of place to have a lot of loud rock and roll music.
Although I have not watched the entire collection, there is another thing that I like about these shows is that there is not a lot of profane language in use.  Some people seem to like the use of dirty language, but that is not what I like in a show.  To me it takes away from the show, it is a detective show, not a swearing contest.

7921340,5,B00004RF74,"I was hooked from the first episode! I really wish HBO had continued the series, but, alas ...! Powers Boothe was so damned good, it's ridiculous!!! He and the wonderful actors cast in these episodes captured Chandler's flawed characters well. Marlowe was such a smart-ass, but still principled enough to do the right thing, complete with warts and complications.

I did like the first season better: Kathryn Lee Scott as ""Annie Reardon"" was so good, and I missed ""Violets"" McGee! The music was jazzier (that opening theme is FIERCE!), and the dialogue snarkier, especially in ""Finger Man"" and ""The Pencil."" However, the nastier side of Los Angeles was explored in the 2nd season's episodes, with political sex scandals, and other unseemliness. Those episodes were more atmospheric and film noirish, but they were all good, as well.

It always makes me wonder: every time there's a GOOD show on TV (quality-wise, production-wise, cast-wise, and otherwise!), it lasts about 20 minutes before they launch the crummy stuff! Oh well!
