7841941,5,6303257682,Lost and Found is a great movie starring the great Glenda Jackson and George Segal.  I rememeber seeing this film when it first came out. It is an enduring film and you will love the love story of these two complete  opposites.  Glenda brings to the screen a touch of class if you will and  George adds a touch of spice to their roles.  Great film. Hope it comes on  dvd someday.,943660800,2,379,4.194444444444445
