Very frustrated as I did want to see and enjoy this video. If I can ever get one that plays, I will upgrade my review.",1445904000,,263,3.9622641509433962
8355650,5,B00284BVBS,"Awesome show! I watched it when it originally aired on television in October 1994 for Halloween. Very interesting, with cool scary clips from The Werewolf, Nosferatu, Dracula and more, with insightful interviews with experts in psychology, etc. A must have for any time of year if you like scary and true shows!",1424476800,,311,5.0
8355651,5,B00284BVBS,"This special originally aired on network TV in the 90's around Halloween. Being the halloween fanatic I taped it and watched it faithfully every year. I'm so glad this is on DVD now, as I don't use my VCR anymore.
This show has the feel of an A&E or History channel show. It examines the legend and lore of witches, werewolves and vampires. It also clears up some of the history of these beings, as well as the present forms of them.
We learn that there are indeed real vampires; they're a kind of subculture in today's world and we meet a ""self-proclaimed"" vampire named Catrina Coffin, who says she drinks blood and sleeps in a coffin. Real stories of modern day vampirism are included as well.
Werewolves are examined next and we are told that there are actually people who believe they turn into wolves, due to a psychological illness called lycanthropy.
Lastly, we learn about witches and Wiccans. Graves reviews the history of the burning times, and the Salem Witch Trials. We also learn about modern day Wiccans, and the difference between them and old-time witches. If you are not familiar with Wiccans, this is a great introduction. And modern day practioners of the craft are interviewed, most notably Salem's own Laurie Cabot.
If you like a few chills along with some history this one's for you. It's great to get you in the Halloween spirit, or if you are just a fan of the lore of any of the supernatural.",1244332800,3,1418,4.608695652173913
