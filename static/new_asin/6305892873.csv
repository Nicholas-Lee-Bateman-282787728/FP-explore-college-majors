7897022,4,6305892873,"This movie is a cute and very yuppie version of Swiss Family Robinson. Dyan Cannon does a good job of coping Martha Stewart. Dyan Cannon is a very poplar up-tight host of a domestic T.V. show. After her family decides to stop communicating with her, she decides its time that the family takes a vacation. As Dyan's show wraps up filming in Hawaii, the family boards a yacht to start a much needed vacation. However the family awakes to find out that the yacht has been high jacked by the dumb, dumber, and dumbest pirates ever.",1276128000,,527,4.5
7897023,3,6305892873,"I tried to hate it and call it a tired interpretation of the old Disney classic, but I ended up falling in love with its quirky humor and general atmosphere of fun.  Call it a romp through good family-oriented humor and hijinks.  It's something you can share with the kids and get a laugh out of yourself.  I admit I just love Sarah Michelle Gellar, but be forewarned, she's no Buffy here.  Dyan Cannon was supreme and never looked better, imho.  She and Martin Mull has great chemistry.",1054425600,2,487,4.488636363636363
7897024,5,6305892873,"I'm a huge fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar so that is why I picked this one. I remember when the movie came on TV and I liked it then. It very interesting and has many funny moments. The story is not realistic what so ever, but the fact that SMG is it makes it all the better.",1051315200,2,273,3.807017543859649
7897025,5,6305892873,"Sarah Michelle Gellar is EXELLENT in this film.
The only one that delivers pure acting for the film.
Sarah Michelle Gellar has become one of the Top celebrities in the world and is STILL rising as a star!",1036800000,,204,4.394736842105263
7897026,5,6305892873,"This movie hits the topps. I'm serious! EVERYONE should see this movie. It is about a family who the mother (Dyan Cannon)is a cook-show hostess and takes her family, Jane(Sarah Michelle Gellar), her son(Ryan O'Donahue), and her husband(Martin Mull)on an adventure with her on the sea. But one morning they wake up on a deserted island. But she didn't expect pirates!!!!!!!!!
  ~If you are cool, Then you must view this movie!!!~
  Sarah Michelle Gellar Fan-a-pal-ooza(Fun apple snoozuh')",976752000,10,487,5.285714285714286
7897027,3,6305892873,"This movie is so lame! :)  But you know what?  That's okay, really!  If you're looking for a fun family movie, check it out.  It's very funny, and  it's perfectly harmless.  Sarah Michelle Gellar's part is pretty small, so  you might be disappointed if you watch this video just because she's in it.  The movie is about a family with a workaholic mom, a nice dad, and two  kids, who are just trying to spend one evening relaxing.  One thing after  another goes wrong, and they end up on a deserted island . . . or is it  really deserted?  They build a really cool tree house, Sarah M. Gellar's  character has a little romance, and the family fights the bad guys (who are  kind of modern-day pirates).  The film is not a re-make of the original  Disney ""Swiss Family Robinson"", although there are some  similarities. (I liked this one better than the old one.) Really, this  movie is nothing to write home about, but it deserves points for its  humorous antics.",965952000,4,960,4.47093023255814
7897028,5,6305892873,"Beverly Hills Robinson is nothing to write home about...BUT...Sarah Michelle Gellar could be portraying a mime and it would still make the movie interesting. Dyan Cannon and Martin Mull are perfectly cast as  Gellar's parents, and Gellar steals the show (as she does in previous  roles...ex.""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""Scream  2"", ""Cruel Intentions"", ""Simply Irresistible"", and  I shouldn't forget the devious, nasty, manipulitive role as Kendall Hart on  ""All My Children"" that won her the Emmy over Susan Lucci.) Don't  watch it for Academy caliber performances...just watch it for what it is  meant to be...PURE FUN! And that makes it worth watching....! I give  this movie FIVE STARS!  AWESOME!",959644800,5,706,5.232142857142857
