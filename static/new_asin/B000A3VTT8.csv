2356596,5,B000A3VTT8,"Compared to the old laserdisc release of this opera, this new DVD is a joy to behold. To my eyes much loving attention has been lavished on restoring and cleaning up this disc with the result that the colours throughout are rich and saturated. While the quality of the video has been significantly improved the audio remains about the same as the laserdisc---- the addition of 5.1 DTS does not really offer any audible differences over the PCM stereo which incidentally is very good indeed. The DVD now offers subtitles in five languages including English.

In my opinion this production of the work stands head and shoulders

over the competition. The entire cast, the musical direction of Abbado and the imaginative video direction of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle make this a winner all round. Standouts in the singers are von Stade and Montarsolo.

Compared to other Unitel releases of Ponnelle operatic productions on DVD this is be far the best to date.",1136332800,14,950,4.925

2356600,5,B000A3VTT8,"The best possible opera movies.  Claudio Abbado prerecorded Rossini's music, but you rarely notice the actors going out of sync.  The La Scala sets are lovely, but the singing is what opera is about.  Frederica von Stade, queen of the""trouser"" roles in her heyday, does a superb job as Angelina.  She is hardly a stereotypical opera singer, being thin and lithe and, the way she is lighted, exceptionally pretty.  Her face has wonderful bone structure.  Paolo Montarsolo is always delightful and he could have been a film actor (a la Alastair Sim)  had he not gone into opera.  Claudio Desderi has some wonderful moments as Dandini.  The Prince is only adequate, not terribly photogenic but the singing is good.  It's a lot of noisy fluff if you like that sort of thing, and I do.  While von Stade isn't in it, ""Zitto, zitto; piano,piano"" is totally delightful.  So is the Act II duet between Desderi and Montarsolo.  But Angelina is the role of the show and von Stade fills it beautifully.  One caveat:  with most opera DVDs, either the films or the taped live performances, after a few initial viewings I tend to skip to the high spots.  With ""La Cenerentold"" I have to watch the whole thing, which means finding a clear two and a half hours every time I want to enjoy it.  I have to see it all!",1439164800,2,1297,4.545454545454546

This is THE DVD of Cenerentola to get.  For a good CD, get the one by the same conductor (Abbado) as Teresa Berganza sings a wonderful Cinderella on that one, and three of the characters are sung by the same people as on this DVD.

Aside from those statues (at least some statues do wear clothes, from what I've seen), the sets on this are very good.

The acting, also, is good; I am under the impression that acting is getting very important to the operatic industry, which is foolish: singing should be foremost; purity of tone and a lovely sound. I digress.

This as very satisfying, never boring, Rossini as amusing as ever; I do dislike, however, the fountain scene where they whirled the camera around and around; dizzying, and in a bad way.

At any rate, however, this is a worthy addition to your shelf; and good enough to rewatch over and over again.",1401321600,,861,4.758389261744966
2356610,5,B000A3VTT8,"This is one of Ponnelle's greatest productions--- a standard which has not been surpassed in other DVDs of this great comic opera by Rossini. The sets built in a studio are  beautiful and blend into the action of the opera.  The same with the costumes.  Ponnelle produces and directs from his understanding of the score  and in this area his insights appear to dominate the field.  Ponnelle and Abbado refuse to turn this performance into vocal acrobats for the singers,  Everything,including  the superb acting which preserves some of the greatest portrayals in the opera buffo tradition. The vocal lines are sung with an emphasis on the meaning and expressiveness which is inherent in the music.  Rossini is preserved without the pyrotechnics that distort the line. Rossini complained about singers who augmented the line and distorted it beyond recognition.  Rossini provided sufficient vocal displays requiring great technique--these are preserved and executed by what I would deem modern masters. . Von Stade and  Araiza give expressive performances while executing the necessary fireworks.  They also look the parts-Von Stade with a beautiful plaintive voice that blooms in the final scene into a remarkable performance of the final difficult aria --beautiful tone and  a warmth and expressiveness that captures the essence of the role.  Araiza is a master of his role as the prince and complements Von Stade --the two make a remarkable pair-- vocally and histrionically. However, the performances of Montarsolo and Desderi have to be seen and heard to be believed.  They are simply the greatest exponents of the great Italian opera buffo tradition.  There are no matches for them on other DVDs or in modern performances that I witnessed over the past two decades. Plishka- not be outdone-- sings with great vocal and expressive effect as the Prince's mentor and in a real Ponnelle moment as Rossini himself. Guglielmi and Zannini, not to be outdone in this august company,  sing and act the two sisters to a hilarious turn.

Get this DVD it will be the gem of your collection.",1400112000,5,2083,5.097345132743363

There are many times during the opera when everyone is singing the very same text, but there are no subtitles translating the Italian.

2356617,5,B000A3VTT8,"I first saw this performance, broadcast live from the Met, on PBS sometime in the 1980's and was utterly enthralled with the music and the cast, and I thought then that it just might be the perfect opera to introduce a person to who might be inclined to think that opera would never work for him or her.  After seeing this remastered DVD rendition, I still think the same.  La Cenerentola is a story that everyone knows (it's the Cinderella tale).  The love story between the prince and Cinderella is played straight while just about everything else is played as comedy.  A great mix that really works!  Frederica von Stade is alluringly beautiful in the lead role (her unexpected unveiling at the Grand Ball is quite moving), the Prince is compellingly ardent, and especially funny are Don Magnifico and Dandini.  The acting is superb and all of them are in great voice with Rossini's orchestrations, as always, full of color and energy.

I was thrilled to find that it is now available, remastered, on a DVD.",1358380800,3,1010,4.704545454545454
2356618,5,B000A3VTT8,"In more recent recordings, there are mezzo-sopranos who fill the role of Angelina wonderfully - Cecilia Bartoli, Elina Garanca, but to name two. Vocally, there are a lot more, from Lucia Valentini Terrani to Jennifer Lamore, and others.
But admittedly, to find a singer who looks the part as well as sings the part is sometimes a big stretch for producers. Frederica von Stade is not the vocally strongest Cenerentola, for sure.  Her voice has an unpleasant wimpy quality that she employs far too much in this recording, even in Cenerentola's final triumphant aria, which is a put off.  But her acting is very good, and she makes a wonderful visual pair with Prince Ramiro, unsurpassably performed by Francisco Araiza.
Claudio Desderi as Dandini is hilarious and he employs his coloraturas to great buffo effect.
The entire cast is fantastic and the direction is truly immaculate, since even the usually stolid Araiza is an animated Prince Charming in this recording.  His characterisation and singing simply beats Raul Gimenez in the Bartoli DVD, and even Juan Diego Florez in the Didonato DVD.
This is probably the best shot opera film, as so many have observed.  The scenary and sets are fabulous, and the camera's close-ups of von Stade and Araiza really put many of those currently performing at the MET HD broadcasts to shame, am afraid.
A must see, no less.",1349827200,2,1364,4.917391304347826
2356619,5,B000A3VTT8,"Why?
Because the recent 'star' sets simply overshadowed this 1981 La Scala recording.
My first Cenerentola was Bartoli/Gimenez.  A perfectly good performance, with Corbelli as Don Magnificio.  Bartoli looked and sounded fresh in that recording, and she IS Italian! As Ramiro, a not too young Raul Gimenez sings wonderfully in true bel canto style. So I thought - well, Prince Charming, that's about it (i.e. there's none such in REAL operatic world).
Then I got Florez and DiDonato's 'cartoon' set.  Well, let me admit it - I did not watch that one in one sitting.  It is simply TOO much - what horrific sets! And DiDonato is no Cinderella, and Florez is too earthly a Prince - not tall, not masculine-voiced, though singing very floridly and fluently. The dramatic impact of this production is simply way too low.
Then I got a much better viewing of the MET Cenerentola, with Garanca as (eventually) the REAL Cindarella, both in looks and singing. The cast performed SO WELL that I forgot entirely about Brownlee's Prince, who was neither charming, nor tall, nor regal looking, but who sings adequately.
My experience with Rossini's La Cenerentola, therefore, is rather drab.
Until I watched this one - what a jaw-dropping performance and terrific production, as well as top-rate shooting.
The camera work deserves special commendation. In the romantic scenes, the shots are close - and it works SO well in this production, since we have here two MOST credible Cinderella and Prince Charming in the persons of Frederica von Stade and Franciso Araiza. In short, my hopes IN La Cenerentola are restored.
The acting is terrific - Desderi and Montarsolo are simply the best exponents of Italian buffa style, just as Alberghini and Corbelli in the MET production.
While Frederica von Stade is not as proficient as Rossinian mezzo as either Bartoli, DiDonato or probably even Garanca, her singing is adequate, and her acting is wonderful here. La Cenerentola is a bit difficult to stage, since mezzos are generally tall ladies, and Rossinian tenors not known for their height.
We have the big exception in the Bartoli/Gimenez production, but then back to the big reverse in the MET with a tall and slender Garanca and a short (and fat) Brownlee. Florez is barely the same height as DiDonato, who somehow looked more like Angelina's mother than Angelina herself, alas.
So visually this La Scala production of von Stade and Araiza is well-neigh the IDEAL combination.
Admittedly, von Stade has some vocal limitations here. Her Rossini is not, vocally, in the same league as Valentini-Terrani, Ann Murray, Agnes Baltsa or Joyce Didonato, let alone Cecilia Bartoli. While some people took far too seriously on Araiza's aspirated coloraturas, it is in fact an old vocal technique that is seldom employed for want of vocal proficiency in many modern singers.  Now, with Bartoli being the foremost 'aspirated coloratura' exponent, this aspect can safely be put to rest. Still, purely in terms of vocal proficiency in Rossini, I would opt either for DiDonato/Florez, Bartoli/Gimenez or even Garanca/Brownlee, since von Stade is barely adequate vocally as Angelina and is no match for the other three mezzos who are all Rossini experts.  For the strongest vocal combination of this work, go for Ferro's CD of Francisco Araiza/Lucia Valentini-Terrani.
Having said that, a La Cenerentola production without a pair of convincing leads is simply doomed to failure, however vocally brilliant, and I have seen much more flops of this opera's productions than successes.  This La Scala performance WILL definitely stand unsurpassed.",1349395200,4,3611,5.120543293718167
2356620,5,B000A3VTT8,"I've seen 2 other Cenerentolas, and this is by far the best.
Cast is not just one superstar, but 6-7 really good
singers in perfect form at the height of their careers.
I think von Stade just retired this year here in the Bay Area.

However, I'm commenting because this is my 3yo daughter's
favorite DVD.  In fact, when she sees Disney Cinderella
on screen, she says ""I want to see the real cinderella instead"".
She's probably watched her favorite arias 50 times now.
She knows the story, and since the actors expressions
are fairly expressive, she knows that ""she's sad"", ""the
daddy is angry"", etc.

Both of the kids have seen various other operas including
Barbiere and Mozart's Figaro, but they have a hard time
following the story (and having your 8yo interrupt every
30 secs to ask what is happening gets old).  This opera
also has a lot more singing and very little recitativo.

Show this to your kids early, show it to them often.

2356621,5,B000A3VTT8,"Recently purchased the DiDonato and Florez DVD, and while the two leads were great, it made me want to get out this version and watch it all over again!  This one has never been bested.  Good things always seemed to happen when director Ponelle and conductor Abbado came together.  Singing is fantastic, the production values wonderful, and there is a rare level of commitment and passion throughout.  The cast is absolutely perfect, every singer superb.  Desderi is a wonderful Dandini, comical, yet what a voice!  And Montarsolo is the quintessential basso buffo of Italian opera, where hamming it up comes with the territory.  As for the two leads, they are physically and musically perfect.  And Paul Plishka does seem an Alidoro descended straight from heaven!  I love opera in general, but Cenerentola is my favorite over anything by Wagner or Verdi, even though many would consider it hopelessly light weight.  If it is done right, you should feel very moved by the end of the opera.  It is all about--for once in this miserable world--goodness and love winning out over cruelty and stupidity.  The only other opera on DVD that leaves me feeling as good as this one does is the Bergman Magic Flute.  It too has a hero and heroine who seem to simply embody goodness and innocence.  Both productions show, too, that there can be real advantages to a film approach to opera rather than simply recording a live performance.

2356625,4,B000A3VTT8,"For most newcomers, viewing opera is a unique experience. It is unlike watching plays yet the staging is similar. When viewed on DVD, one expects to be entertained as if watching a standard film.

I truly enjoy opera at home when a piece is given a theatrical film feel. Opera must be seen on stage for it to be truly appreciated for what it is and what it is meant to be.

Rossini's most famous opera is The Barber of Seville. If you have experienced 'Barber' then please watch this beautiful piece. It is based on Perrault's 'Cinderella' but without the witches and magic. The magic here is the music, the fun story, the bungling cast of characters and the playful situation.

Don Ramiro is a prince briefly disguised as a groom while his groom portrays him. As the groom, Ramiro visits Don Magnifico and his two daughters. He first encounters Cenerentola, Magnifico's step-daughter. They immediately fall in love but the prince has to know for sure if her heart is pure with goodness. The two daughters, Tisbe and Clorinda fall over the livery-disguised prince, suffocating him for a chance to be the lucky bride. Don Ramiro looks on. The philosopher Alidoro sets things up a notch by giving Cenerentola a chance to visit the prince's mansion.

Claodio abbado conducts the Orchestra del Teatro Alla Scala. This production is based on the 1973 production which Jean-Pierre Ponelle originally directed. The setting, the staging, everything feels like a dream, from the comical costumes of the two sisters to the battered home of Don Magnfico to the palatial mansion of Don Ramiro. A DVD worth getting if you want to sink your teeth into the best of Bel Canto Italian Opera. Also highly recommended: L'Elisir d'Amore (Donizetti - Netrebko/Villazon with Alfred Eschwe conducting).

For those new to opera, also, check out A Night at the Opera by Sir Denis Forman. This book is the most essential reference book. I've had my copy for nearly ten years. Unquestionably the greatest approach to enjoying and following opera.",1240185600,3,2019,4.87463556851312

2356634,3,B000A3VTT8,"This is a beautifully staged production with masterful singing. However, if you have not seen the original, uncropped version of this production I urge you to find a copy of the 1981 VHS filming of this masterpiece. It will enhance your appreciation for the incredible staging, because the DVD is cropped a bit tighter than the video.

Part of the beauty of this production is feeling that you part of the audience. However, there are numerous tight shots that allow you to fully appreciate the expressions on the faces, almost as if you are looking through opera glasses.

The director has a lot of fun with his performers, and sets up visual humor that is very entertaining. The singing, acting, and interaction of the characters is unsurpassed, in my opinion, but the loss of the margins of the staging causes me to give 3 stars, not 5 to the DVD.

2356637,5,B000A3VTT8,"I finally received my long-awaited copy of the Ponelle/Abbado/von Stade DVD

and I can tell you the thing is pure wow!  I truly believe this effort is

one of the most perfect attempts at committing opera to film, drawing as

close a relationship as possible between actual opera house performance and

studio film. The balance is nothing less than remarkable resulting in a

very special work all on its own.

Ponnelle gets his wonderful cast to truly work as a team and the result is

never less than magical. von Stade, for me, is the most radiant Cenerentola

of all time and I have to wonder; has there ever been a more willowy,

beautiful heroine? Her subtle facial expressions are more numerous than

many other mezzos in this role yet she never once comes close to becoming

cloying or hammy - each is just right and feels perfectly natural. Her

singing throughout is exciting.

Abbado sometimes (in my opinion) pushes things along at breakneck pace, but

this still feels Rossinian in spirit and makes the thing crackle with a

vivaciousness that is not impossible to get caught up in, ever bubbly and

buoyant. The La Scala forces all seem caught up in it as well and it makes

for a very special presentation of a very special work.

From ""Una volta c'era un re"" the entire role is stamped with that

unmistakable von Stade magic. I don't know of a singer who has a

better ""melancholy"" quality built right into her instrument and in this

role it works like magic. This quality makes the contrasts stand out more

than usual and are so effective, noticeably in the first great ensemble,

the Act I quintet, where her melancholia transforms into a sparkling, put-

upon quality.  Here, Rossini shows his hand as one of the greatest, most

inspired ""technicians"" ever to put pen a score. This ensemble (one of my

favorites in all of opera) also includes one of my favorite musical

moments; during Cenerentola's patter-commentary (spat out with amazing

clarity) - ""Cenerentola vien qua, Cenerentola va la, Cenerentola va' su,

Cenerentola vien giu"" then the amazing little four note scale repeated over

and over ""Questo e proprio uno strapazzo! Mi volete far crepar"" is mind

boggling in its simplicity and effectiveness at portraying the moment. (Can

you tell yet this is one of my very favorite operas, too?)  In the

first ""go"" at the ""Questo..."" von Stade (with her back to the camera) throws

herself like a rag doll being pulled in separate directions - and it is a

wonderful effect that is the perfect visualization of Rossini's breathless

music.

Francisco Araiza is a thoroughly charming prince, although his aspirate-

tackling of the coloratura work is sometimes a bit too much (for my own

taste) which is odd, as when in duetto with von Stade he seems able to

smooth out the passage work. But these two make as handsome a couple as

ever seen in opera and their first sighting of each other and their ensuing

duet is charm personified.

The rest of the cast includes Paolo Montarsolo as an over-the top Don

Magnifico who really seems intent on burning his bridges in his treatment

of his stepdaughter; the comic book sisters of Clorinda and Tisbe of

Margherita Guglilmi and Laura Zannini - who manage to make the girls into a

hilarious Lucy and Ethel act.

Forgive me if I'd forgotten just how amazing a singer was Paul Plishka. The

voice is huge, robust, commanding and warm. His Alidoro - Rossini coming to

life, made my heart just swell to almost bursting. There is a spiritual

quality here that looks forward to Parsifal (another of my favorites). The

sense of wide-eyed wonderment von Stade's heroine wears has an honesty that

is hypnotic. She, like Parsifal, at the end of the first Grail scene, is

rendered speechless. Here, Rossini raises his heroine, changing the

simplicity of a fairy tale into a miracle, a lesson about the power of

faith and goodness. It's impossible not love her. Plishka's performance is

complete in every way.

Claudio Desderi is hilarious - strongly recalling Dom Delouise (which I'm

guessing was not intentional on his part) and, like everyone else, having

the time of his life here.  Like Araiza, Desderi ascribes to the aspirate-

ridden method of coloratura, but in this comical role it works to his

advantage.

Ponnelle's staging of the Act II Sextet is perhaps my very favorite staging

of any operatic ensemble on video. Back lighting throws the entire scene

into silhouette with the singer's robotic movements resembling the

intricate motions of a great Bavarian Cuckoo Clock. Remarkably, each singer

retains their individuality by becoming part of something larger. Musically

and cinematically it's amazing, and at it's conclusion, with all of the

intricate movements, Ponelle somehow - as by magic - has each character

returned to their starting positions. Awesome.

Flicka gets to shine like a genuine diamond in the final scene, once again

imbuing that heartfelt melancholia into ""Nacqui all' affanno..."" and then

blazing triumphantly through ""Non piu mesta.""

Ponnelle's control of everything (including costumes), attention to the

smallest of details, shows just how much he loved this work and we are

indebted to him for bringing this gem to a different level.

One midnight five years ago, I got out of bed after tossing and turning for

hours, and put on the VHS copy of this. I watched the entire thing and all

my worries seemed to disappear. Later that day I found out it was the

anniversary of the first performance of La Cenerentola. I'm still convinced

Angelina woke me up on purpose!

I really do believe Rossini's girl is one of the most perfect creations in

all of opera and Ponnelle's film version is a vision and just about one of

the most perfect ways to spend a couple of joyous hours.

2356640,5,B000A3VTT8,"Having bought and seen this production on LaserDiscs several years ago, I was hoping against hope that a DVD of this production at La Scala would be issued. It would very difficult to find fault with any phase of this production. The direction/design by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle is outstanding and imaginative. The highlight of his magic for me occurs in the scene near the end of the opera when Cinderella is discovered by the Prince and all the characters are singing about this discovery and the effect it will have on them personally. Ponnelle puts the entire ensemble in silhouette and then spotlights each individual character to place focus on their reaction to the situation. At the end of this delightful scene you know what each individul is thinking about. I have never seen a stage technique that produces this kind of clarity when there is a literal cacophony of individuals in the ensemble singing many different vocal lines.

Now, shall we talk about Frederica von Stade? Perfect! She is a stunningly beautiful ""Cenerentola"". And her vocal handling of this rather difficult Rossini role can not be bettered by any living messo-soprano on the opera stage today. She owns the role with her interpretation, wonderful acting and a meltingly beautiful voice. I could not find a single flaw in either her interpretation or her beautifully controlled voice.

There is also much to be said about the remaing cast. Everyone played and sang their parts with beautiful vocal lines and simply outstanding Bel Canto technique. Araiza is a sensational singing actor in his role as the Prince. Montarsolo, as the make believe Prince had me laughing out loud. He is also another outstanding singing actor. And, I do not want to forget Claudio Abbado. His mastery of this music and ability to keep everything together, especially the duets, trios, quartets, and the very difficult places where every character is singing something different at the same time really has no peer. He allows the singers room to breathe and interpret their roles. Yet he keeps everone reigned in just enough so that the style and musicality of this playful opera is never compromised.

I obviously like this production of Cenerentola. I have watched/listened to my LaserDisc many times and always discovered something new and fresh that I hadn't observed previously. I can not wait to get my hands on the DVD!",1151193600,9,2382,4.9798994974874375
2356641,5,B000A3VTT8,"I first saw this on TV many years ago and never forgot it. So I'm delighted to see it released on DVD at last, in an excellent transfer -- great sound and a vivid, detailed image. My only regret is that the performance was shot in 4:3. Although Ponnelle has some fun with the tight framing, having characters dart in and out of the picture, the ensemble scenes cry out for widescreen. (If other reviewers are correct, the frame is even tighter on the DVD than it was as originally shot and shown on VHS.)

Except for that, though, it's hard to imagine this version being surpassed. The cast is uniformly excellent, from Araiza standing out as a handsome, ardent young prince and von Stade as an absolutely believable and radiant Cinderella, down to the chorus of footmen who are so obviously having a good time. If this disc doesn't keep you smiling, you're made of stone.",1146873600,9,872,4.554140127388535
2356642,5,B000A3VTT8,"I first saw the Ponnelle production of Cenerentola at the San Francisco Opera (where he first produced it) and was bowled over, it even had actual rain on the stage.  Frederica Van Stade is absolutely perfect as ""Angelina"" as the title character is known.  I have long treasured the VHS version of this production, and am delighted that, at long last, it is available on a DVD.  (While my VHS version is perfectly servicable, I bought the DVD version simply to celebrate the decision to release it in this form.)  Much of the stage production is retained in this version, but it has some scenes which are, obviously, not on stage but which add to the drama of the production.  (I have read that it was filmed entirely in Vienna on a sound-stage on which the stage sets were replicated.)  I love Barber of Seville, but I think Cenerentola is the best opera Rossini ever wrote, at least when staged by Ponnelle (who, alas, died at a young age).  Paolo Montarsolo as Cenerentola's nasty step-father and Claudio Desderi as Dandini are superb character actors and singers.

The Cecilia Bartoli performance from Houston (which is also on DVD) is very good (and I'm listening to her fantastic new CD ""Opera Probita"" as I write this--so it isn't a case of my not being a fan of hers--and I think her Barber of Seville is the best on DVD) but the Ponnelle, Von Stade production and performance of Cenerentola is the gold standard, and as I said in the caption, it is the best video performance of an opera that I have ever seen.",1143936000,12,1519,4.5588235294117645
2356643,5,B000A3VTT8,"Cenerentola has been served well on DVD, with four fine productions available, but Ponnelle's film (set somewhere near the Victorian area, given the costumes) is truly an achievement. It's incredibly funny, has great musical values and is also very, very touching. A few of the jokes misfire, (I could do with less of the sister's squealing), but the production, filmed in and around La Scala, is wonderfully innovative. During the overture, we get a tour of the La Scala house and lobby, with it's statues of great Italian Composers singled out, especially that of Rossini (of course). This is a fairy tale with a genuinely happy ending, by the way, and it's exquisitely staged: The Magnificos, who have worn extravagant clothing and hair-dos throughout, appear at the wedding in Victorian grey, looking plain and penitent, only to be forgiven by a dewy-eyed Von Stade. The Sisters break down in tears, and Magnifico is wonderfully and genuinely humbled and forgiven. The scene is nowhere near as touching on the other videos.

 Frederica Von Stade's exquisite Cinderella brought tears to my eyes with her performance of the finale: it's a testament to her skill that this was not her most famous role. It doesn't hurt, of course, that she is a genuine beauty. My Favorite moments: the look on her face as Cenerontola Discovers love in the Prince's Valet and then her wonderful, wonderful smile as she relives the ball and strokes the bracelet on her arm (only to hide it, with excellent comic timing, when her family comes back.) As her Prince Charming, Don Ramiro, Francisco Ariaza is in fine voice. His falling-in-love duet with Von Stade has to be heard to be believed, and his big aria goes over very well.

Paolo Montarsolo's Magnifico is simply the best on disk or video. His singing and diction are impeccable and his Mugging is less evident and more appropriately handled than in his performance as Basilio and Bartolo in Ponnelle's films of BARBIERE and NOZZE DI FIGARO Films. His Magnifico is both a cruel man, but he's not a buffoon and there's a something sympathetic about his downfall. His nearly-silent work in the finale shows that there was much more to his skill as a singing actor than being funny.

He matches wits with Claudio Desderi, an Excellent Dandini. Chubby-Faced and expressive, (he bares a passing resemblance to Dom DeLuise) he's an excellent musician and very funny. His opening ballad and ensemble features a wonderfully held line, excellent coloratura and impeccable patter.  He appears as Magnifico on another video, but his work is nowhere near as good as it is here.

Paul Plishka is given an expanded role as Alidoro, who observes much of the antics of the other characters silently. He sings his aria well, and is provided with the production's one major departure from tradition. Usually, On the line ""Look, and see who I am"", Alidoro takes off his begger disguise and reveals his rich clothing. Here, Alidoro is already in his court dress, and on the aforementioned line, he points to the statue of Rossini, which comes to life. Plishka appears made up very convincingly as Rossini and, at one point, appears on screen with (and duets with) himself, as Alidoro appears to drive Cenerentola off to the ball.

The Sisters (Maria Guglielmi and Laura Zannani) both sing well and are very funny, though, as I said before, I could do without much of their squealing (which is not in the score).

Abbado repeats his fine work from his CD set (the Magnifico family are also the same). A true Rossian, his work is impeccable with an irreproachable sense of style and speed, making the all-important ensembles work like polished clockwork. Even without the visual aspect, this is one of the finest CENERENTOLAS on record. If the soundtrack to this film was released, I'd buy it in a second.

This film, by the way, makes an excellent companion to the Saltzburg Festival video with Ann Murray. Murray is nearly on Von Stade's level as a Cenerentola, Ariaza repeats his performance (if not in as fresh a voice), and plays Ramiro with an angry streak. Gino Quilico is good without approaching the brilliant Desderi as Dandini, and Walter Berry, while not on stable ground vocally, is a nasty Don Magnifico with very little that's funny about him, an interesting and appropriate characterization that counter-points Montarsolo's interestingly. There is an attractive (both physically and vocally) pair of sisters and Wolfgang Schone, a great Alidoro. Either of these Versions would be proud assets to a collection, but I would never want to be without Montarsolo, Von Stade, Desderi and Abbado.",1138060800,58,4623,4.9318766066838045

It had an easy story - what little girl doesn't know Cinderella? The music was catchy. Frederica von Stade's voice and sincerity were captivating. The production didn't look like the other operas on TV - like it was being shouted out on stage - but more like a movie. As I watched, I fell in love not only with these singers, not only with this opera, not only with Rossini, but with a whole genre of music. I watched the video dozens of times over the next 20-odd years, as the tape grew blurry with age. I'm delighted that it's finally out on DVD, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get a small girl interested in classical music.",1137196800,12,815,4.197452229299363
2356646,5,B000A3VTT8,"Ah Rossini...! The real inventor of the assembly line. That Ford fellow was just a copycat. One-size-fits-all overtures. Arias you swear you've heard before (you did). Plots that are reused more often than a sandlot league baseball. Why do we love him so much? Because his music is so infectious that it gets under your skin faster than a splinter from a bamboo shade.

This production of Rossini's take on Cinderella, another filmed Opera from Director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, is beautiful. A joy from beginning to end. Frederica von Stade is luminous in the role of Cenerentola. Literally luminous. Ponnelle illuminates her for much of this film as if he were a graduate of the Spielberg school of backlighting. In fact he backlights just about everything and everyone, sooner or later. Filmed in 1981, (Spielberg had made that technique ubiquitous back then), La Cenerentola had me searching for ET in the long shots. Yet, oddly enough it works. It is a fairy tale, after all.

The Overture has the camera weaving through the empty lobby of La Scala, fixing on the marble statues of famous Italian composers. From there it meanders into the theater and finally the stage. The film records a virtual ""La Scala"" (it isn't, though) staged performance without an audience. Yet it seems larger, and occasionally it does open up to a larger location. The sets are stunning. Every visual element has been carefully chosen to emphasize beauty. This is a lovely film, thoroughly enjoyable just for it's aesthetic excellence!

But there's a beautifully performed Opera here, as well. The youthful Von Stade is a lovely heroine. Her singing is wonderful, her voice lighter than Cecilia Bartoli's smokey mezzo found on her DVD of Cenerentola; now that I have both singers, it is fascinating to compare the two.

Francisco Araiza is Don Ramiro and Claudio Desderi is Dandini. Paulo Montarsolo sings Don Magnifico. Margherita Guglielmi sings Clorinda. Paul Plishka is Alidoro. The entire cast is superb. The Chorus and Orchestra of La Scala, under the direction of the Conductor Claudio Abbado, live and breath this music. They have that authentic Rossini sound unique to native Italians. Nevertheless, they often perform with manic energy; as if this were the first time they were inhabiting Rossini's sound world.

The DTS 5.1 sound is crystalline and full. The picture is well-nigh perfect, as befits a film that's been digitally remastered.

As usual, Ponnelle recorded the music first in January 1981, then had the singers lip sync for the filmed performance in Vienna during August & September that same year. Thus, the singers can focus on their acting; not where the next note is coming from. This works for me, for what it's worth,  but purists may not like it. I think the film's beauty and lofty production values can overcome any obstacle. My strongest possible recommendation for this superbly performed and beautifully filmed La Cenerentola from Director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and a great cast and Orchestra under Claudio Abbado!

All the singers in the cast were excellent.  My favorite was Desderi, who played the Princes valet.  His comedic faces, poise and superb bass were beautiful.
