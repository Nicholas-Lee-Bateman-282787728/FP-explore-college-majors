8762320,5,B01G4FFD1K,"A classic -- one for the ages -- performance of 76 trombones.

 I have seen it on You-Tube where it has gathered more than 2 million hits, but wanted a quality video of this performance to see it again and again and to show others. Other performances at this competition are also included. My DVD was new and reasonably priced at $7 and received promptly by the seller Family of Gold.",1493510400,,384,4.394366197183099
