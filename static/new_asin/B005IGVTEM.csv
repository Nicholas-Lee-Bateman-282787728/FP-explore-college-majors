8474643,1,B005IGVTEM,This is one of the worse acting jobs I have ever seen. The script is so predictable and the special effects are... well... nothing special. I have seen college students projects better than this. A total waste of time.,1456358400,,218,4.615384615384615
8474644,1,B005IGVTEM,"I don't understand how this has gotten decent reviews.  I would suggest seeing this if you want a good laugh and can somehow find it for free or less than $5.  Trying to sell this for any more than $10 is laughable.

The performances, from the beginning, are painful.  There were only two characters that had passable acting - Tammy and Edgar.  I'm sure some of the others are good actors.  I blame it mostly on the god-awful script, I had to check afterwards that the screenplay wasn't written by a 12 year old.  I learned it was actually the middle-aged director, who likes having 12 year olds talk about oral sex and swear in his films.

The cinematography was poor on many different levels.  It looks like a high school video class film.  The whites were blown out too many times to count, the lighting in other shots was much to dark, there were high angle shots when clearly they weren't needed, the handheld shots were too shaky, the color correction was laughable, and there were little to no establishing shots.

I expected a decent film after all the reviews, but was poorly mistaken.  I wasted 90 minutes of my life.  Try not to do the same.",1324598400,8,1152,4.480769230769231
8474645,4,B005IGVTEM,This is one of the best indie films I have seen in some time! In Kyle Hoskins feature film debut he plays a mentally challenged teen who by the end of the film you won't be mad at him like his mom.,1322784000,,197,3.7142857142857144
8474646,5,B005IGVTEM,"After seeing a special screening, the most notable character is Tammy, Played by Lindsay Felton, the only decent likable character in the whole story, Lindsay's performance was great and out shined the other actors, overall, a good film with good special effects for a low budget film.",1316563200,4,285,5.085106382978723
8474647,4,B005IGVTEM,"I caught this at the debut screening. It's loads of guts and good times. The film avoids the traps of being too post slasher self aware, or being too much of a overt grindhouse style tribute. Raymond ends up being a straight ahead slasher flick in the mold of 80's bloodbaths, that delivers on the deaths big time. The title roll is a fine addition to the slasher ranks (interesting enough to hold the screen as a character and violent enough to pay off as a monster) and the picture was obviously made with a lot of affection for the genre. Help support indie horror and pick up a copy for Halloween.",1315526400,5,601,4.375
8474648,5,B005IGVTEM,i loved this film when i saw it at a special screening!  can't wait to see the DVD.  these filmmakers have a long standing love for horror and cinema craft and are ones to watch for the future!,1314748800,4,193,4.052631578947368
