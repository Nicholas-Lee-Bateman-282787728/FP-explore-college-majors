8388097,4,B0033UZ0SG,"The DVD presentation itself is from a lecture Dr. Welsing conducted in 1987, and the cover should be given the title of ""White Genetic Survival"" instead of her groundbreaking book ""The Isis Papers"".  Also, there is no graphic on the DVD face itself and there is no back matter describing what is on the DVD.  The menu page looks as if whomever recorded this, they had just copied it from a VHS taping.  I know that most folks would ask why am I being negative for a DVD that cost me $9.00 plus shipping, but no matter what business you are in, first impressions matter--especially if you want previous customers to be constant customers.  The sellers of these types of DVDs did not do their due diligence in presenting a quality item.  This is not a knock against their purpose in presenting the information, it is a critique concerning their product presentation.  Hopefully these items can be applied to future DVDs. If not, then no one would be wanting to make any more purchases from RGB Library, since they are not a professional business.",1283817600,6,1044,4.646739130434782
