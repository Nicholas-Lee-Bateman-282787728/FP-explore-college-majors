632574,3,6303358381,"Kika sets up its audience in a manner that few films could achieve. Initially slated by critics for its shocking content and genre, this film breaks all the rules with its apparent trivilisation of the rape of its  main protagonist. Veronica Forque carries of the part of Kika wonderfully  but is somewhat undershadowed at times by the powerful performance of  Victoria Abril, in Gautier rubber suit...and loving it! The strong female  cast and the touching realisation that Juana, Rossy de Palma, has a love so  strong for Kika she is willing to give herself to the rapist, her brother!,  in order to protect her, causes a confusion in the message Almodovar is  trying to relay to his audience. This contrast of apparent exploitation of  main female characters and yet the strength of their presence throughout  the film, makes this an interesting study of the question of Almodovar as  mysogonist. One to watch, if not for the moral implications, then for a  look at kitsch at its best!",951436800,15,988,4.8562874251497

632576,5,6303358381,This movie is hysterical!  It made me laugh and laugh!  It is truly Almodovar's very best!  He is a brilliant director.  The story is light and all the scenes and adventures the main character gets herself into are  really outrageous!  It does have lots of very adult situations!  Highly  recommended!,950054400,7,301,4.88
632656,3,6303358381,"this is not the best almodovar film for sure,but still it is a very good film.
it is very entertaining ,fun, wicked, and has the usual social tabboos almodovar uses for his work ,which makes it  very funny in a very dark way.
the characters are little bit more complex than almodovars first films ,and the plot can be a little tricky to follow  but in fact that is what he wanted to do ,confuse the viewer with a very funny dark comedy that all of a sudden  turns very dramatic,a crime,and then back to a comedy again! that difficulty to understand is what i think makes it entertaining because you don't loose your focus while watching it. but it also  makes it somehow too pretentious and kinda ""melrose place-ish"".with almodovar's movies you  know all the characters are standouts , but  i specially enjoyed  ""cara cortada"" a scarred reality show hostess ,clad in  jean paul gaultier haute couture(you gotta see her outfits) who aparently ""gets off"" filming the most tragical,horrible and traumatic moments in other people's life to present them on her morbidly gross show.
another stanout is of course kika ,a very tacky  looking airhead who is a beauty consultant that cheats on her lover with his stepfather and cant stop talking  nonsense during the whole  film!(thats fun to watch)
if your are  fan of almodovar's work , you got to see kika ,because its defenately a step  from his previous  simple dark comedies to a more dramatic,complex and almost too pretentious  for my taste latter work.
his best work in my opinion are his debut film ""pepi ,luci,bom..."",his 2nd film""labyrinth of passion"" and ""what have i done to deserve this"".if you haven't seen his work start from there.",1058659200,3,1689,4.775862068965517
632657,3,6303358381,"I guess the right way to watch Almodovar's movies is to see them chronologically, according to the time of their creation. This is not what I did. I started watching his work with ""Talk to Her"" moved on to ""All about my mother"" and then watched ""Kika"". In a way, this order of viewing indeed affected my judgment. After watching the first two, ""Kika"" is indeed a disappointment and does not come up to the standard of his later creations. However, I am willing to admit that I might have misjudged this film as the reason for my low rating is that I find ""Kika"" to be very perplexing and I always find it hard to enjoy something I do not totally understand. However, this might be my own problem. Maybe you do not need to understand everything. Its not that I did not understand what I saw in the movie. Indeed, the characters are peculiar and the plot is amazing. However, what you truly do not understand is what did Almodovar want to tell you? What are the characters motives and where are they coming from? What seems to be the glue that made Almodovar put all these characters together?  I have several vague ideas, but am totally uncertain about them. Although other viewers laughed and thought the movie was a comedy, my personal reaction was sitting with my mouth wide open at what went on the screen asking myself was it my problem for not understanding or was it a feeling Almodovar wanted to create on purpose....Maybe he did want the viewers to feel disgusted over the media's interests and the power of rating and wanted to make it as extreme and shocking as possible (the first shock is from Andrea's clothes...).
In spite of what I have written above, this is indeed an Almodovar movie and as such has a lot of his personal traits - including the Almodovar charm. In this movie as his other films I saw, you manage to remain not critical towards all characters and there is no one you totally hate or dislike in spite of all the horrible things they do (off course one can say that you do not care about the characters enough to really mind...). You do like Kika. She is not a strong character that stays with you after the movie ends, however, is sweet and charming with a lot of ""love of life"" and vivacity about her. I found her naivety and even ignorance as something that was easy for me to accept. Sort of a defense mechanism for staying in her own world.
It is interesting that even the rapist is not someone you totally hate or despise. The same can be said about Andrea, a sort of Television reporter, who is the ""bad"" character of the movie. She is revolting in her actions and yet, you do not feel any strong resentment towards her and in a way accept her ""murder madness"". This acceptance that Almodovar creates is especially important as the movie is filled with ugly disgusting things (whipping of the back, etc.) which do cause a feeling of uneasiness although you have a sense of ""this can not be truly happening"".
Another striking character is that of Juana who is Kika's lesbian maid. This woman has such an extraordinary face, which in my eyes is some of the Almodovar appeal. She can be said to be a true ugly person and on the other hand, has some amazing features. Her total look is one of the ""Adams Family"".
Reading my review over and again I find it to be somewhat confused. This is indeed how I feel after watching this movie. Many impressions, several thoughts, but all in all not a movie I would like to see again.",1053216000,6,3457,4.435534591194968
632658,4,6303358381,"This is not the easiest film to understand. I think it makes sense if you see it as a transition film for Almodovar. In his earlier films he was so visually audacious that his content seemed secondary to his style, and even though his men and women had very dark desires Almodovars absurdist sensibility kept his films in the comic category. In Kika I think he is leaving behind that comic sensibility and digging deeper beneath that visual audacity and presenting his characters as people not just with absurd desires but with real lives and experiences which are not so easily overcome. perhaps the best character in Kika is Victoria Abril(with dark hair) who plays a tabloid journalist always on the prowl for the next big sex scandal breaking on the horizon. She is both literally and figuratively scarred from a failed love and seems to have gone over the edge. The only way she can get turned on now is by relishing in others tragedies. So of course she is attracted to the dark American writer(Coyote)who seems to leave a trail of dead bodies in his wake. The title character Kika (Veronica Forque) is a make-up artist who meets Coyote becomes his lover first and then his sons lover but she never leaves Coyote. She is not really the central character in this film so its odd that the film is titled Kika. but then the whole film is a little uncertain as to just what direction it should take.  Almodovars seems to be experincing some creative indirection and it shows. This film has some of Almodovars bold visual trademark antics like outrageouly costumed and hyper sexual women but as the film progresses it becomes less and less like one of the older kind of Almodovar films and more and more like a new kind of Almodovar film which is to say this is a step toward a new kind of Almodovar film-- a Spanish noir,perhaps--which he will later perfect with the classic LIVE FLESH.  In Kika he has not perfected his new style yet but if you are a filmgoer who likes to follow a filmakers progress this is a key film. Many of Almovodar bests films deal with women relating with women ( I would not call these films ""noirs"") but when he deals with the relation between the sexes he is evolving a style which derives from noir. Far from being a limit the genre seems to have liberated Almodovar from other kinds of constraints. In Kika he is struggling to free himself of some of his own cliches and the noir genre seems to have been just the thing to give his talents a new kind of focus. Live Flesh is his noir masterpiece but Kika was a key step in getting there.",1053129600,12,2570,4.489316239316239
632659,5,6303358381,"This is my personal favorite of Almodovar's films. Those unfamiliar with Almodovar's work should take heed...this is a totally off-the-wall adult film. He is famous for pushing the boundaries of taste and outrageousness to the extreme and beyond. However, his movies entertain nonetheless. ""Kika"" is a cosmotologist on a quest for love and happiness. The film chronicles her (mis)adventures and encounters with all sorts of people who either don't understand her or seek to use her. She ,like Lulu in ""Pandora's Box"", is a free spirit adrift in a sea of miscreants. Almodovar deftly blends slapstick and drama together with his trademark color motifs, bizarre costumes (by Gaultier), over-the-top dialogue and stock cast members to enliven a fairy tale that, to me, stands unique among his other films. Of course, without Veronica Forque as Kika there would be no film. She is a total delight from start to finish and carries a difficult film soley on her bravura performance and irrepressable personality. And don't miss Victoria Abril as a reporter with an unusual way of getting the scoop on film! There is much to relish here and ""Kika"" can be watched again and again and still remain fresh and entertaining. A must for Almodovar fans.",1033948800,19,1239,5.048780487804878
632660,5,6303358381,"If you are offended by the off beat, do not watch this movie.  I for one love Almodovar's wry sense of humor.  He places the most unbelieveable characters imaginable together.  This movie is no exception.  A romance, a murder, a convict on the loose, and an unrequitted love all put together make for an interesting movie.  His movies tend to catch us in our most unveiled moments.  This is definately one to watch.

632662,3,6303358381,"I think most amazon.com patrons would be thinking about 'Kika' only if, like me, they saw ""All About My Mother"" or ""Woman on the Verge..."" or some other Almdovar masterpiece and thought, ""Gee, I ought to rent/buy some of his other works.""  With that in mind, here's where ""Kika"" ranks in my estimation:
1.  ""All About My Mother""
2. ""Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown""
3. ""Live Flesh""  (early Bardem!!  Don't miss it.)
4. ""High Heels""
5. Every other Almodovar film except ""Kika"" (includes anything he ever did at film school, plus birthday celebrations where he might have held a video camera).
6. ""Kika""
The only reason to watch this film - and this is for pure comedic value only - is to witness the train wreck of Peter Coyote in this film.  I don't mean to slam him as an actor.  He doesn't look *that* out of place or anything, but Almodovar has dubbed in a preposterous-sounding Castillian accent over Coyote's real voice...who knows if the actor was speaking his original lines in English or whether he really gave Spanish a whirl.  Anyway, the dubbing - in my mind - became a heck of a lot more fun to watch than the movie.
Gave it three stars instead of two because, hey, it's got Victoria Abril, so it can't be that bad.  She completely overshadows Veronica Forque, who is totally inconsequential as the lead character. The only thing that will stick with you from Forque's performance is her voice, which sounds like someone who has sucked on helium since Nixon went to China.",999561600,10,1494,4.590225563909774

I can't even write a decent review of the movie itself because the subtitle is white and whenever there is a light background in the scene, you basically stop following the dialogue.

None will take the job, and the film drifts off into a tale of what happened to her when she took on the same type of task in the past. All in all not a lot to recommend it for Kika from the ensuing yarn, but a great and very dark comedy for us, which slaps you around the face like a wet fish. You'll roar with laughter at a rape scene (excuse me?)! You'll crease up at the death scenes. If hetro, you'll probably find the big blonde woman very sexy (she's a man by the way, the directors boyfriend).
Even the director's mum gets a part, and merrily announces that she's in the film because otherwise she'd never see her son (Pedro Almodovar). On the surface this film would seem to be about as unpolitically correct as any you're likely to watch, and one of its great functions is to disturb and upset the very people who should applaud it.

7844756,5,6303358381,"Kika (1993) is possibly Pedro Almod&oacute;vars most underrated and misunderstood film. Demonized for its notorious prolonged rape scene scandalously played for laughs, the film has fallen victim to accusations of sensationalism, sexism, exploitation and of shocking for shocks sake. It has also been accused of undisciplined formlessness. To the unsympathetic eye the film is a helter-skelter mess of different genres which obstinately refuse to gel together. Part screwball sex comedy, part melodrama, part fashion show review, part serial killer thriller, part psycho suspense voyeur fest, part porno, part reality TV show  the film tries to be everything, but succeeds in being nothing. On first release the film made money, but people didn't really know what to make of it. Factor in the provocative rape and the problems it caused the American censors and the film became a hot potato, an eccentric misfire ignored by film festivals. Almod&oacute;var perhaps felt he had to atone for his sin (and rescue his reputation) in his following film, the inoffensive melodrama The Flower of My Secret (1995). Ironically, that film was also misunderstood and was only later acknowledged for its excellence. Kika meanwhile continues to languish in critical limbo and its hard to understand why. It does jump anarchically from genre to genre, but the disorientation this causes in the viewer is wholly intentional on Almod&oacute;vars part for what we have here is nothing less than a postmodern inter-textual pastiche. If we attempt to understand what the director is up to, we realize that far from being chaotic and undisciplined, the narrative is tight, makes sense (as far as a postmodern text ever can!) and succeeds in achieving Almod&oacute;vars goal of staying true to his personal themes (namely the championship of the strengths of womankind in the face of male domination and a development of meta-cinematic concerns) while pushing the boundary of what film can do just a little further.

It would be both tedious and pointless to attempt a complete synopsis of this film, convoluted and ridiculous as it is, but spoilers are alas inevitable in what follows...

The film centers around a bubbly warm-spirited 40 something single make-up artist named Kika (an amazing performance from Ver&oacute;nica Forqu&eacute;) and her love life. Starting and finishing on images of a road (the road of life), the film spot-checks her involvement with three men  American murder-suspense novelist Nicholas Pierce (Peter Coyote), his stepson fashion photographer Ram&oacute;n (&Agrave;lex Casanovas) and her maids retarded escaped convict/ex-porno actor brother Paul (Santiago Lajusticia). All three use and abuse her in various ways. Throw in a couple of useless chauvinist cops and masculine reality TV show presenter Andrea Scarface (Victoria Abril) and the film is that quintessential Almod&oacute;var essay on a woman surviving the tyranny of men. The film is structured in two halves either side of the infamous rape. The first half is mostly played for laughs as we see Kika at the center of Nicholas and Ram&oacute;ns attention. The latter even proposes to her and (he being rich) she is on the verge of domestic security. A visit from Paul Bazzo (the name is a pun on the Spanish word polvazo meaning big ejaculation) changes all this. Not only does he rape her three times, but she later discovers Ram&oacute;n caught it on camera and also that another voyeur caught not only the rape but also Nicholas killing a woman named Susana (Bib&iacute; Andersen) in the apartment above. When she sees this second film on TV having been sold to Andreas reality show entitled Todays Worst, she realizes nobody gives a damn about her and leaves. Even her maid Juana (Rossy de Palma) has lied to her about her brother and she is left alone, completely without the usual female solidarity that is present in other Almod&oacute;var films. If the first half of the film is (from Kikas point of view) played as a screwball sex comedy, the second half is played as melodrama which descends into psycho horror when she visits Nicholas and Ram&oacute;ns family villa and finds out the first is a serial killer while the second is a seriously disturbed voyeur. She eventually decides to throw away Ram&oacute;ns engagement ring and walk away, the film finishing on her hitching up with a young man stranded on the side of a road. She drives off to probably another sexual adventure, her spirit and great strength of character celebrated to the very last. Forqu&eacute;s performance suffering at the hands of men throughout the film is a hilarious triumph as she spectacularly essays her characters transition from happy go lucky screwball blond to melodramatic victim in this films crazy narrative arc. The central rape scene in particular comes across less as a gratification of male desire than a tribute to the strengths of womankind. Appearing only twice for Almod&oacute;var (in What Have I Done to Deserve This? [1984] and here) and pursuing a career on Spanish TV, one regrets not seeing more of her on British screens.

As can be gleaned above, this film is in one sense simple  a film of two halves separated by a scene of transgression. Furthermore we note the film begins and ends in bloodbaths shown in long scenes at the villa belonging to Nicholas and Ram&oacute;n so establishing an organized balance to the films over-riding narrative structure. The disorientating complexity lies in the postmodern way Almod&oacute;var chooses to tell his story. Contrary to modernism, postmodernism accepts the world cannot be explained by one all-embracing theory. It is too complicated to be reduced down into one system or genre. Any attempt at explaining is not only pointless, but threatening as well. Therefore, a postmodern film will turn in on itself, examine itself and forefront the mechanics of the filmmaking process in a way that approaches the very confusion that the world around us really consists of. Postmodern film consists of five main interlocking themes which come out of this self-reflexive acceptance of chaos being the one uniting definition of the reality that surrounds us  inter-textual pastiche (genre manipulation), meta-fiction (the foregrounding of the creative process and the acceptance of more than one voice controlling the narrative), faction (the adoption of real life events or people), paranoia (all characters are crushed by the sense of lives spiraling out of control), and constant referencing to other art either existing or invented (a blurring of both high and low culture). Kika exemplifies all of these features, advancing what Almod&oacute;var began in The Law of Desire (1987) and will develop through The Flower of My Secret, All About My Mother (1999) and Bad Education (2004) to Broken Embraces (2009). Only in Kika though is the inter-textual pastiche so manic, the meta-fiction so multi-voiced and the constant referencing to other films so pronounced.

In the film Almod&oacute;var allots a different film genre to each of the four main characters. Consequently we get four different doppelg&auml;nger/alter-egos for the director who each insist the film be shot in their own distinctive way. It is noticeable that each character is an artistic creator of a kind. Kika is a make-up artist which cues up the films fashion parade of perfectly coiffured and made-up actors parading costumes designed by Jos&eacute; Maria de Cossio, Gianni Versace and Jean-Paul Gaultier. Every scene sees all the actors change their clothes making for a virtual catwalk of a film in which all things visual replace the importance of all things intellectual. Kika is the one character who undergoes a change and correspondingly Almod&oacute;var allots her two genres  screwball sex comedy for the first half (evidenced by her hilarious non-stop verbal diarrhea bringing to mind Katherine Hepburn or Rosalind Russell coupled with bizarrely comic situations  arriving for sex but ending up making up a corpse, reacting to Ram&oacute;n taking photos while they make love, screaming at her rapist to stop drooling and come quickly so that he will get off her) and melodrama for the second (we sympathize with her plight at nobody showing her sympathy for having been raped and are given two stereotypical melodramatic scenes  a farewell to her maid Juana and a letter reading scene which compels her to see Ram&oacute;n again). Of course the genres flying in from the other characters mix oddly with these two, but that is part of the unique postmodern flavor of Almod&oacute;vars concoction.

Ram&oacute;n is a fashion photographer which provides the cue for the voyeuristic way much of the film is shot. Almod&oacute;var is calling the shots, but the numerous compositions framed through windows and doors coupled with the continual quotation of films inspired by voyeurism dominate throughout. These closely align the directors point of view with Ram&oacute;ns and through Ram&oacute;n with ours as well. The opening credits shows a woman stripping through a keyhole shape which turns out to be Ram&oacute;ns as well as Almod&oacute;vars and slips straight into an obvious quote of David Hemmings raping Verushka with his camera in Blow Up (1966, Michelangelo Antonioni). On his studio wall is a poster for Peeping Tom (1960, Michael Powell) and then later it emerges he has rented an apartment across the way from where he lives with Kika and enjoys peeping at her from a distance &agrave; la Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window (1954, Alfred Hitchcock). Indeed, it turns out Ram&oacute;n has psychological problems which the casting of the X-ray eyed Alex Casanovas perfectly conveys. This consists of an out of control Oedipus complex, a love for his mother and a desire to kill his father. The film opens on him finding his mothers corpse, she having been shot in the chest and finishes on him finding Kika with blood on her chest (from another corpse) in the same place. The fact that Kika is a mother figure much older than him who he wants to marry while also wanting to be rid of his step father Nicholas, suggests the film is in effect an exorcism of his trauma wherein his childhood memories (growing up behind the bedroom door listening to/watching his mum and stepdad making love) are confronted. This is obviously Psycho (1960, Hitchcock) territory and that film informs Almod&oacute;vars treatment of Ram&oacute;n (the genre of psycho-suspense) along with a sophisticated riff on numerous other Hitchcock thrillers from Rope (a corpse in a box) to The Trouble with Harry. The theme of dubious policemen (Hitch hated the police) is made obvious while the women murder victims are of course Grace Kelly-blonds. Like The Jimmy Stewart character in Rear Window (another photographer of course) Ram&oacute;n isn't a bad man exactly, but he is a voyeur and just as Hitchcock poses the very act of sitting in the dark and watching a movie as a voyeuristic act in itself, so Almod&oacute;var does the same thing. This is especially noticeable in the way the rape is shot through the window, Ram&oacute;ns point of view merging exactly with ours. As with the Stewart character (who breaks his other leg) Ram&oacute;n is punished but will get to live another day just as we in the audience also will.

Nicholas is another very Hitchcockian character (Peter Coyote again perfectly cast), but rather than the psycho-suspense/voyeur genre, he is depicted by Almod&oacute;var as a straightforward serial killer which evokes films like Suspicion (1941), Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Rope (1948), Frenzy (1972) as well as Psycho. Nicholas is a writer and of course is the most obvious doppelg&auml;nger of the four for Almod&oacute;var. He writes novels based on his own real life crimes as well as (it turns out) writing the scripts for Andrea Scarfaces Todays Worst. The murder the second peeper (possibly Andrea) accidentally catches him committing while shooting Kika making love to Ram&oacute;n earlier is the films most obvious quote to Rear Window (the story of another murder being accidentally captured). Perhaps significant is the way Almod&oacute;var merges his references. The film opens on 2 gun shots and Ram&oacute;n finding Nicholas having seemingly been shot in the arm by his wife (Ram&oacute;ns mother) who in turn shot herself dead. Later Ram&oacute;n realizes Nicholas has faked the scene. In a direct quote from The Prowler (1950, Joseph Losey) which we actually see on TV, Van Heflin shoots his victim dead point blank before shooting himself in the arm. While the penny drops for both us and Ram&oacute;n that Nicholas has killed his wife we notice the music on the soundtrack does not belong to The Prowler. It belongs to Psycho. Almod&oacute;var extends the use of the music over into the next scene and prepares us for the grand guignol serial killer thriller climax in the old house. It was not lost on Almod&oacute;var at the time that serial killer thrillers were in vogue in the early 90s. The Silence of the Lambs (1991, Jonathan Demme) had won the Academy Award and a whole raft of serial killer flicks were in theaters at the time, most infamously of all of course Natural Born Killers (1994, Oliver Stone) which came out the same year as Kika.

An important character in Natural Born Killers was a reality TV show host played by Robert Downey Jr. Here we have Andrea Scarface superbly played by Victoria Abril who on one level articulates the films postmodern faction. Two scenes are directly inspired by real events. A man gunning down his wife in a cemetery is verbatim what happened in 1993 in Fort Lauderdale Florida, while the footage of a religious procession where Paul Bazzo escapes is taken from the annual Good Friday procession of self-flagellants in San Vicente da la Sonsierra (notice Almodovar putting in a Hitchcock-style cameo here!). On a deeper level the character of Andrea is the key to understanding all the other characters and the reality she presents on her TV show equates precisely with the very reality (our reality) Almod&oacute;var is depicting in his film. I talked earlier about Kika introducing the films fashion parade, but it is Andrea who sports the most outlandish Jean Paul Gaultier costumes on the stage of her TV studio. One startling number features exploding breasts while another exposes a fake artificial leg with more than a hint of sado-masochism. Off stage she also wears a bizarre leather Gaultier outfit making her look like a cross between a human surveillance mechanism and a bug  more S&M bondage gear with lights for breasts and a camera on her head forever recording her (re the films/our) reality. Andrea has a big hand in forming the characters of the two male protagonists. She has slept with both Nicholas and Ram&oacute;n and was even the latters psychologist before she turned reality TV presenter. If both men are fundamentally disturbed it is in no small part down to her, something which of course makes her an obvious Almod&oacute;var doppelg&auml;nger. Indeed, she may even be the main over-riding auteur figure. If one character can be said to be in control it is Andrea. Tellingly, she is controversially shown as being the films most evil character, even more so than the rapist Paul Bazzo and gets suitably punished for her transgressions by a spot of the latter's semen falling onto her head ironically annointing her ('blessing' her) from up above. Note Kika isn't disturbed by her rape until she sees it on TV and is shamed. The crime isn't a crime until it is captured by a camera and is shared. In addition it is obvious that Andreas show is heavily scripted (more faction) by Nicholas no less and in addition to epitomizing evil, is most responsible for the representation of reality that we see in the film. The fact that she shows a world devoid of privacy and full of voyeurs, serial killers, rapists, dubious policemen, masochistic maids, etc (all of whom she manipulates) may seem perverse and constitutes perhaps a shock too far for Almod&oacute;var, but through the paranoid lens of a postmodern worldview, it more than succeeds in accomplishing the directors goal of refracting his own personal themes through extending genre experimentation to its very furthest limits. As such, the film represents some kind of masterpiece and the last word on this kind of filmmaking before Almodovar moved on to a different style in The Flower of My Secret.

This Optimum DVD (aspect ratio 16:9) looks and sounds great and comes with some very interesting extras  an introduction to the film by Jos&eacute; Arroyo and interviews with the cast and Almod&oacute;var himself. Most interesting of all, we get to see the director in action and how he acts all the roles for his cast who are forced into following his lead. One thing puzzles me. Arroyo alludes to a prison musical number (presumably featuring Juana the lesbian maid who fantasizes being a prison warder surrounded by women prisoners) which he says is a highlight. There is no such scene in this print. Does this mean this print has been cut, or is Arroyo simply mixing it up with High Heels (1991) which I know definitely DOES have a womens prison number? Perhaps someone can clear this up. Anyway, Kika is an excellent film. Much better than everyone seems to think, appreciate it as a postmodern text along the lines say of Blue Velvet (1984, David Lynch) or Barton Fink (1991, Coen brothers) and you should have a ball. It is possibly Almod&oacute;vars wackiest, funniest feature to date  a delight from the keyhole opening through to the Some Like It Hot (1959, Billy Wilder) Nobodys Perfect ending replete with a rendition of that films famous rumba. Sheer joy.",1457481600,,17737,5.08098833218943

Veronica Forquet is probably the best comedienne Spain has at the moment, and Victoria Abril, is up there in the pantheon of Almodovar's movie goddesses.  Together, they are irresistible. Throw in Peter Coyote and you have pure nitroglycerine! I will not even try to give a plot summary.  Just lie back and laugh your head off!",1246320000,3,398,4.577464788732394

No se realmente como este talentoso director convierte escenas fuertes de violencia de toda clase y encuentra humor en ello. Realmente nos recuerda a no tomarnos tan en serio. Definitivamente un gran profesor y artista.  Los actores todos fabulosos(menos el Peter Coyote, que no s para que diablos lo inyectaron en tal produccin, blah!)Todo lo dems perfecto.

7844761,5,6303358381,"I've learned to accept Almodovar as he has (ahem) matured & gotten serious. He is my favorite director so I support all his progressions. However! I'm deeply & irrevocably in love with the movie Kika, its colors, its actors, its characters, its music, its dialogue, its spell. Having watched it as much as I have, I've analyzed scenes & themes that otherwise would have escaped a one time viewing only.  For example, notice how Ramon kneels in front of three women, for different purposes. First the model in the opening credits as he photographs her in bed. Next, he kneels in front of his dead mother as he opens her blouse to reveal her wound. Finally, in front of Kika as he makes love to her. The posters throughout the film hint at the action to take place in the future scenes. The dialogue is hilarious beyond belief & is not all translated or not translated acurately in the subtitles. If you are an Almodovar fan, you owe it to yourself to study Spanish & brush up on Castillian regionalisms to get the fully, mordant sinuousness of the dialogue. Kika is a black comedy & must be enjoyed as such, otherwise one would not laugh at the bizarre costumes, the multiple deaths, the rape as much-needed outlet for the retarded ex-porn star, the fickleness of love, the unfaitfulness throughout. Finally, I suspect that public taste or America's increasing discomfort with black comedy when its applied to rape, is delaying or preventing the rerelease of Kika on dvd. Its available in Brazil, but, of course not with English subtitles.",1098230400,15,1538,4.7388059701492535
