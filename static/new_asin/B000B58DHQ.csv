2399764,5,B000B58DHQ,"In this French-Moroccan road movie, a father and son travel by car from France to Saudi Arabia. For the father, it is his once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage to Mecca. For the teenage son, completely westernized, with a non-Muslim girlfriend and school exams to take, it is the worst possible turn of events. They quarrel much of the way or press on in bitter silence, as the road takes them through Italy, the Balkans, Turkey, Syria and Jordan. Along the way, there is trouble at border crossings and they pick up riders - not always willingly. Eventually, in a blow-up over a gift of money to a begging woman at a well in the desert, they reach a crisis that threatens to separate them.

As travelogue, the film is fascinating. European landscapes give way dramatically in Turkey to the East, with a visit to the Blue Mosque in Istanbul and a nightclub with singing and dancing. Intensity builds as their journey converges with that of other pilgrims until they merge with the vast crowds from all over the Muslim world in Mecca. The performances are fine, as the mercurial emotions of the son drive his moods in conflicting directions and the stolid father clings stubbornly to his own determination to do it all his way. A winner at the Venice Film Festival.",1191801600,25,1256,4.735159817351598
2399765,5,B000B58DHQ,"The company releasing Le Grand Voyages prides itself on bringing great cinema to the viewer. This movies like their others is not maintream but don't fear, with this company you're in good hands. The hook for me is usually a director that I'm following or a particular actor that I like or the music is by some great composer like Morricone or Preisner. On this occasion I bought the film because of Nicholas Cazale. I wasn't disppaointed. The clash of religious intolerance and western liberalism, which is the subtext of the movie,  is sensitively handled.

If you're looking for a modern ""entertain me because it's all about keeping my attention"" kind of movie, this particular one probably isn't for you.  If you're looking for a movie that's thought provoking on almost all spiritual, relational and emotional levels, you will probably enjoy this movie very much.

I have never written a movie review on Amazon before this one.  But, for this one, I had to.  Especially in the culture of hate we seem to be overwhelmed with in our culture today, this beautiful movie not only entertains, but forces us to face paradigms we all have toward each other.",1471132800,6,659,4.848214285714286

2399879,4,B000B58DHQ,"Score yet another one for a superb film made in Hollywood NOT. This ""road trip"" film presents a generational gap that is never overcome and it is telling that the youngest son in the family is ""chosen"" to make the trip. Father and son do understand one another; they just can't really fully accept what the other is: one rooted in a traditional past, the other rooting in a non-traditional present. The filmmakers wisely show us some humorous moments which take the edge off the tension that exists between the main characters who are basically trapped in a car together. Apart from some minor things, the only scene we had issue with was when they were snowed in: given Dad's condition, the state of the car, and their predicament, simply showing them in a hospital as the next scene is too much a deus ex machine. Nonetheless, highly recommended.",1453939200,4,848,4.697986577181208

2399910,4,B000B58DHQ,"Le Grand Voyage chronicles the coming of age for Reda, a French-Muslim teenager forced by his father to drive the 3000+ mile trip to Mecca on a pilgrimage.  Along the way they have the expected father-son, the headstrong-against-the-wise power struggles, such as the illiterate father wanting to take only back roads and use the sun as a compass but Reda the son wants to use a map to follow main routes. Another source of conflict is despite the father's advice, Reda befriends a scoundrel in Turkey who takes all their money.  The movie has some funny parts and many touching parts.  Occasionally there is a strange background noise during scenes of highway driving; I'm attributing it to low-quality film equipment.  There are a couple of major plot points that are not quite overtly resolved; the viewer assumes the two pilgrims muddle out of the situation since they continue on their way.  A better editor could have eliminated the many unnecessary scenes, such as Reda backing up the car in Mecca (??), and opted for a couple of seconds longer to demonstrate how the different problems along the way were resolved. You do not need to know anything about Islam to enjoy this film.  In end the our protagonist Reda is left alone, as he often wished he could be during the voyage, only this time he must return home by himself with his thoughts of everything he has seen and learned.",1437091200,7,1387,4.734439834024896

The set-up is tried and true--generational gap forced together with the viewers cheering for the characters to close the gaps in interesting or engrossing ways. The problem is, unless you project A LOT, the gap was seldom really closed. For the most part, the father is well acted and you end up caring about him--not so much with the son--but you don't really see that much character development in either of the two and so you don't end up investing emotion into the movie other than being reasonably entertained by its rich settings.

There were many times I wanted to reach through the screen and smack the son, so does that mean it is a good movie or does it mean that the character was overdone - I get the picture... The son and the father are from different worlds, but it could have been done more creatively and with more depth.
I wanted to feel the father more...  I wanted to feel his sickness... His pain at having a son that wasn't a practicing muslim... Why? Yes, silence speaks volumes at the right times... But most of the movie???

Watch it for the journey...",1360454400,,730,4.360294117647059

2399934,3,B000B58DHQ,"I don't mean to be disrespectful, given the film's import to Muslims, however as a film I found that it was lacking.  The story has some gaping holes, which make it almost unbelievable that such a journey could take place.  Physically driving from France to Mecca would be a major undertaking.  This story is somewhat of a fairy tale in that the obstacles which are encountered all seem to have morals.  I also would have like to have understood more about what is happening in Mecca.  I think there could have been more explanation built into the story to explain that.  I very much enjoyed seeing a film with this theme, I hope there are more.",1356307200,,645,4.517241379310345
2399935,5,B000B58DHQ,Le Grand Voyage is a French film about a Muslim Moraccan who has lived in France for many years.  He decides it is time to make the trek to Mecca and demands that his 18-year-old son drive him there - a 3000 mile drive.  The film is worth seeing just for the amazing drive which culminates in Mecca filled with multitudes of pilgrims.  Add to that the fascinating journey of father and son as they work through a testy relationship and you have a fine film.,1353110400,2,457,4.290697674418604

2399941,4,B000B58DHQ,"""Le Grand Voyage"" works on several levels.  It tells the story of an aging French North African man's determination to fulfill every Muslim's lifetime obligation to make the pilgrimage to Mecca.  The film also looks at the great personal distance between the man and his youngest son, a teenager born in France and French through and through, with little interest in or understanding of his aged father's religion or commitment to the pilgrimage.  Reda, the teenager, is drafted to drive his father to Mecca when an older brother loses his driver's license through a DUI incident.  Reda, with lycee exams looming and passionate attachment to a French girlfriend, is anything but enthusiastic about making the trip with a parent he has little emotional connection.  The pilgrimage begins with a series of spats that the father uses to establish his authority over the son and son employs to demonstrate his displeasure with being yanked out of his comfortable life as a European teenager.

Despite some bumpy transitions in the film, the director, Ismael Ferroukhi, does a credible job in moving the film forward literally (with the cross-Europe travel toward Saudi Arabia) and the slower coverage of distance between the father and son.  The eventual arrival in Mecca brings some understanding of the father's passion for the trip to both the character's son and the non-Muslim viewer.  The final epiphany for Reda will follow events in Mecca.

There is a lot to like about this film story--the unconventionally beautiful landscapes, the complicated relationship between the principal characters, the small adventures with others that occur on the trip and the fulfillment of the pilgrimage or hadj are all engaging and credible.  This film does not operate like a Hollywood production in any sense of the word.  The viewer has some work to do here and that makes the film all the more interesting.

2399942,5,B000B58DHQ,"I don't want to spoil it so I'll just say that it's a slow-paced, linear story that my husband and I enjoyed (as a library loan) enough to buy on Amazon, and we don't buy many films because we think only a few are worth seeing repeatedly. If you watch this and like it, check out the documentary, also slow-paced and linear, To Be and To Have, a French filming of school children that makes my husband and I want to cuddle up with some of the children who are no longer at the cuddle-up age.",1262908800,3,491,4.125
2399943,3,B000B58DHQ,"The synopsis I read (on an un-named video rental/watch online site) said that the father and son realize that ""the destination isn't the point, it's the journey"".  I didn't find myself in agreement, on that point.

We're in France (where?) and an old muslim man wants to go on the Haj.  His oldest son, who is to drive him, gets arrested and loses his license, so his younger son--who's already failed one exam for college, and is up for another when the trip is to begin, must fill in.  So they get into a dreadfully old little car, and set off--to Mecca. From France.

I've already seen this film, and I'm Wildly Ecstatic about the premise.  So  can you begin to understand why I don't want you to waste your money buying this film?  Rent it?  Join an online company and watch it for free in your first month!!!

Okay, so get mad.  They're driving from France to Mecca.  If you paid attention to the introduction to ""Casablanca"" when the little red Hollywood Arrow was crossing the map, you would have realized this was possible (I'm with you, I wasn't paying attention) and so here we are.

Unfortunately, the producers either had a bad script, or they gave the young actor too much leeway.  There is no reason to believe that the old muslim is so horrible that his youngest son won't interact with him.  But he won't, most of the time.  There's no reason to think that the young man's life is so awful that he has to be so mean, and disinterested all the time.  But he is.  He's driving across Europe and into the Middle East, and nothing happens, except plot twists that untwist later.  Ho hum. And no matter what happens, this irritating young man will not engage.  He has no curiosity, no imagination, no desire, aside from that for his girlfriend back in France.

That's another problem with this film:  They're Driving Across Europe To Mecca.  But you have no sense of Europe or the Middle East, until you end up in the Middle East, and what part of France were we in?  I've never seen a film where so much territory has been traversed, and yet you, the viewer, has no sense of where the characters have been, save for the checkpoints, at the border.

Having watched this film online, from a prominent web based film rental site, I would say that you should do the same:  Don't buy it, rent it.  Of  course, if you find the idea of a movie based on the idea of driving from Europe to Mecca, for the Haj, or, whatever, sounds like a good idea for a film. PLEASE let me know when you release it, because I'm dying to see it.",1234224000,10,2531,4.38494623655914
2399944,5,B000B58DHQ,"LE GRAND VOYAGE is a gentle miracle of a film, a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director Ismal Ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars  Nicolas Cazal and Mohamed Majd to carry the emotional impact of the film. Ferroukhi's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of  Katell Djian (a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters) and the musical score by Fowzi Guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys.

Reda (Nicolas Cazal) lives with his Muslim family in Southern France,  a young student with a Western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage.  His elderly father (Mohamed Majd) has decided his time has come to make his Hadj to Mecca, and being unable to drive, requests the reluctant Reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation. The two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through France, into Italy, and on through Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, and Turkey to Saudi Arabia.  Along the trip Reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights, but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and Reda is irritably left to struggle with his father's demands.  On their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman (Ghina Ognianova) who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by Reda, a Turkish man Mustapha (Jacky Nercessian) who promises to guide the father/son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting Reda drunk in a bar and disappearing, and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons.  Tensions between father and son mount: Reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps, and the father cannot comprehend Reda's insensitivity to the father's religious beliefs and needs.  At last they reach Mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip's significance is overwhelming to Reda.  The manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning.  It has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age, between son and father, and between defiance and acceptance of religious values.

The visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just 'happens' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects. Nicolas Cazal is a superb actor (be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'The Grocer's Son') and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film.  Another fine film from The Film Movement, this is a tender story brilliantly told.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, September 08",1220227200,49,3097,4.998054474708171
