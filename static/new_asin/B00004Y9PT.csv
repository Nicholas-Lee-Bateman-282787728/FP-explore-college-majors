7927019,5,B00004Y9PT,"Gundam Wing has to be THE best Gundam cartoon, not to mention anime, ever made. The plot is marvelously written, but it can sometimes get confusing.  At times, I almost didn't know what the point of the story was. If you're  new to the Gundam universe, let me brush you up. MS Gundams are incredible  battle robots, some armed with weapons that could easily wipe out a  military base in 1 easy shot. The Gundams controlled by the main characters  in this cartoon are as follows: Sandrock, Wing, Heavy Arms, Shen-Long, and  Death Scythe (my personal favorite). These gundams are the top MSs, and  each has their own different strengths, much like their pilots. The plot is  simple at first, starting with 'destroy OZ' or something along those lines,  but slowly get more and more complicated and enthralling. This is a  must-have!",967680000,3,829,4.774647887323944

They were made for  fighting in Earths atmosphere.  So are the gundams useless?  Get this video  and find out!  It's the only way to find out.  Parents should know that  adult language is present in this version.",967075200,6,339,4.706896551724138
