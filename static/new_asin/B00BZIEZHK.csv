8575863,5,B00BZIEZHK,"Eureka indeed!. I only got this film recently, and found it entertaining & interesting, as did my wife, who doesn't normally watch this type of film. If you want to learn about Australian history, this movie gives a good insight into the Goldrush days of the 1850's. It is set in Ballarat, which is ABOUT 60 miles west of Melbourne, Victoria.

I recommend that a viewing of  'Eureka Stockade' be preceded by a reading about that chapter in Australian history, and the movie is more likely to be enjoyed by people 50+, as it was made in 1949!. The movie is also likely to be enjoyed more by us 'Senior Citizens' because of it being made in black & white, though if something made in black & white can be enjoyed in these 'modern times', it indicates that it was well made!. 'Eureka Stockade' is slow watching at times- no denying it- however I reckon the movie is worth persevering with.

Americans who've been to Ballarat, and anyone considering a visit Down Under, would also benefit- I believe- from a viewing of 'Eureka Stockade'.",1467331200,,1033,4.603260869565218
