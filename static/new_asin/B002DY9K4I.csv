The film filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of that subject. Good job!",1401753600,3,187,3.9473684210526314

8366323,5,B002DY9K4I,"Master Mantak Chia has been teaching his Healing Tao system of martial arts for many years and he has become a very successful author in addition to his sold out courses and seminars. My wife and I bought a couple of his books and were interested in his teaching, but it wasn't until I saw ""How It All Began"" that I understood the origins of Master Chia's teaching and how his Taoist teachings developed. Recommended to all students and even readers of Mantak Chia as well as those interested in martial arts philosophy.",1401148800,6,520,4.602150537634409
