8516675,4,B007HILH96,"Off-duty cop, Johnny Damico, witnesses a murder, holds a gun on the killer and bends over to help the victim when the killer shows a badge and a police revolver. The killer escapes. He wasn't a cop. The chief doesnt suspend Johnny but sends him under cover to track down the killer and what turns out to be his mob connections. Broderick Crawford is at his best here in what is a first rate noir. Fast moving action, suspense and all the noir characteristics. If you like film noir, youll  love this movie.",1488758400,,506,4.440860215053763
