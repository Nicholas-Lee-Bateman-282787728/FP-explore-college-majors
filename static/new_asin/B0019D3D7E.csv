8273590,4,B0019D3D7E,"""Danger, Love at Work"", released in 1937, is a delightful screwball comedy from 20th Century Fox. The film was one of 2 directed by Otto Preminger in the 1930s. Preminger fought with head of studio Daryl Zanuck and returned to Broadway for 6 years before returning to film ""Laura"" and move on to greater fame so the film is a very untypical entry in his legacy.

The film costars Jack Haley, of Tin Man fame from ""The Wizard of Oz"", with Ann Sothern, a sprightly blonde comedienne. The supporting cast is outstanding with Mary Boland, John Carradine, Edward Everett Horton, cast against type as Sothern's forceful fiance, and many others who you will recognise and welcome. The script is amusing rather than hilarious but the film is beautifully made in all departments, particularly the bright lighting preserved in the immaculate print. One standout scene has the leads duetting the title song in a barn, worth the price of the video alone.

The DVD includes excellent liner notes about Preminger and the film but there are no other extras.  It can be purchased very cheaply on amazon.uk.",1280707200,,1090,4.849462365591398
