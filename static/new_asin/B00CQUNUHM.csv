5735129,3,B00CQUNUHM,"Released just before the death of Edward I. Koch, the 2013 documentary KOCH literally follows the man around both present day and, via archival footage, during his spectacular rise and crashing fall as New York City's 105th mayor.  As significant as anything in his political career, KOCH reminds us, was that Koch was at the forefront of the Democratic Party's sellout of working people, a ""fiscal conservative and a social liberal.""

Guys, let's say what it is.  ""Conservatives"" represent the interests of the affluent, ""liberals"" of regular folks.  Maybe Ed Koch came around, albeit not that quickly, to support gay men's health in the wake of the A.I.D.S. crisis.  Sure, it's great to be alive in New York City but if you can't find an affordable place to rent because Koch policies support the real estate giants - oh, excuse me, I mean ""conservatives"" - moving poor people out and, with taxpayer subsidies no less, replacing their homes with luxury housing, well, there's always New Jersey.

KOCH neglects Koch's most embarrassing moment, his 1984 public harangue against then-presidential candidate Jesse Jackson.  But on the whole the film does not hide how obnoxious the mayor could be, turning from charmer to snake in a heartbeat when faced with disagreement.

The Ed Koch movie I want to see will be based on the 1988 book CITY FOR SALE.",1380931200,,1349,4.938053097345133

5735131,4,B00CQUNUHM,"Marking the directorial debut of journalist Neil Barsky, the documentary ""Koch"" provides us with a comprehensive look at one of the most outspoken, colorful and controversial mayors in New York City history. Ed Koch served in that role for three tumultuous terms, from 1978 to 1989. He continued on as a robust, politically active advocate for the city he loved until his death on February 1, 2013 at the ripe old age of 88 (an event that happened shortly after the release of the movie).

The movie begins in 1977, a low point in New York City history, when the city itself was facing bankruptcy, the serial killer known as the Son of Sam was terrorizing the citizenry, and crime and hopelessness were the order of the day. It was into this quagmire of despair and seemingly intractable problems that a comparatively obscure New York congressman named Ed Koch ran for and won the highest office in the biggest city in America. The movie goes on to chronicle the ups and downs of Koch's time in office, his often uneasy relationship with large segments of the black community (charges of racism were not uncommon throughout his career), the emergence of the city from the shadows of bankruptcy under his leadership and the transformation of areas like Times Square from ""dens of iniquity"" to vibrant centers of tourism and business, bringing life back to the community. The movie also addresses the rumors of homosexuality that dogged Koch throughout his life, sometimes to the detriment of his career as a politician and sometimes not.

If Koch could be pigeonholed, he could be most accurately described as a fiscal conservative and a social liberal who believed strongly in gay rights and a woman's right to choose. This dichotomy frequently alienated a number of his natural constituencies, resulting in Koch's reputation for being forceful and courageous and for always being his own man. He also craved the spotlight and was not afraid to let his freak flag fly in pop culture settings, ranging from bit parts in movies (often playing himself) to roles on Broadway and appearances on ""Saturday Night Live."" In his third term, beginning in the mid `80's, Koch was haunted by a corruption scandal that permeated the city government (crimes investigated by an up-and-coming prosecutor by the name of Rudy Giuliani) and by a gay community that felt Koch was not responding with proper force to the then-burgeoning AIDS crisis. But this term was also marked by  Koch's push for affordable housing and a falling crime rate. It was also the period in which he suffered a stroke. Finally, Koch was defeated in his attempt at securing a fourth term as mayor, but, even out of office and despite declining health, he remained ever active and engaged in the affairs of his town.

Because Koch died almost immediately after its release, there is obviously no reference to his passing in the movie. It also means that Koch is able to tell his own story in his own words, eliminating the need for a voiceover narrator. And all his friends, critics and colleagues get to speak of him as well in the present tense.

Thus, what was originally intended as a tribute has become a moving elegy to a man who, for all his failings, made his mark on the city as few others ever have or ever will.",1379030400,2,3279,4.776014109347443
5735132,1,B00CQUNUHM,"What an awful documentary.  Having lived in NY during his reign (and Bloomberg's) this film is filled with lies and propaganda.

Koch should be remembered for spending the city into oblivion and only dealing with the budget by ignoring the need to fix and repair roads and bridges.

He also should be remembered for the trickery and lies surrounding Bernard Goetz.  I hope that family is getting next to nothing from him!",1377561600,,421,4.805555555555555
5735133,5,B00CQUNUHM,"Mayor Ed Koch was truly a ""love him or hate him"" guy, I suppose, but he was always entertaining! Frankly, this was better than I expected and the producers seemed to get most of the facts straight (not always the case in these ""documentaries."")

Had they waited just a bit longer, they could have covered Koch's funeral, where the church organist even dropped in a few bars of ""New York, New York!""

Great history lesson for those who weren't around during the Mayor's tenure, too. Raise your hand if you remember that, while mayor, Ed once hosted SNL!",1376352000,2,552,4.622448979591836
5735134,4,B00CQUNUHM,"I saw this movie some 2 months ago in the theatre here in Cincinnati, and notice that it is now finally listed on Amazon as a future DVD release.

""Koch"" (2013 release; 95 min.) is an entertaining, if flawed, movie about Ed Koch, the three-term mayor of New York (1978-1989). The movie can essentially be divided up in two (concurrent) parts: there is a look back at Koch's tenure as New York's mayor, and that is interspersed with a look at how Koch goes about his life when the movie is filmed (in 2010), giving his candid thoughts on anyone and everything. By far the best part of the movie is the first half hour, as we see how Koch wins a tough election race as an underdog against Mario Cuomo and others, and then gets to deal with the state of affairs in New York, at that time as good as bankrupt (finacially and otherwise). The archival footage from those days remains fascinating to watch. We see Koch dealing with the housing crisis, the AIDS crisis, and so on. What is alomost entirely lacking, and a significant flaw in this movie, is understanding how Koch became the man that he was while governing NY. His background and upbringing are dealt with in literally a few minutes. What a shame. As to the latter-day footage, there is a scene where Koch spens Yom Kippur with his extended family that I found very telling (and touching).

Despite its flaws, this documentary (from first time director Neil Barsky--if the name sounds familiar, he is a former Wall Street Journal reporter) is never anything less than entertaining. Check out the footage from Saturday Night Live in 1983 where Eddie Murphy and Ed Koch are lapping it up. And here are a couple of quotes in the movie that stuck with me: a black politician commenting on Koch: ""he's worse than a racist, he's an opportunist"", ha! Koch commenting on flying back to New York in his later years: ""I see New York laying in front of me, and think, this belongs to me!"". Another politician on Koch: ""if they can keep the camera on him in the operation room, he'll never die."" Sadly, Koch did pass away recently (on February 1, ironically the day of this documentary's release in the US). Bottom line: ""Koch"", shortcomings and all, nevertheless deserves a look.",1368489600,7,2225,4.5879396984924625
