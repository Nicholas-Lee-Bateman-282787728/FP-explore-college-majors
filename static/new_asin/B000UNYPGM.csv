2923036,4,B000UNYPGM,Ab Fab is best in modest servings; watching all this at one time is a bit too much. Jennifer Saunders is a unique ... mind.,1383868800,,123,3.96
2923037,5,B000UNYPGM,"These ladies are the most hilarious duo , and i am blindsided by their humor, sometimes in a delayed reaction. so love the ""squish squish"" when she says she's crying to her daughter, the show just tickles me to death. if ever i need to laugh or lighten up, i can just grab my beautifully packaged folder of their shows, and extra's, and i'm laughing in no time. highly recommend.",1382486400,,379,4.428571428571429
2923038,1,B000UNYPGM,"episodes in this collection have been edited to exclude several music references i.e. series 5 the ''chicago'' musical dream sequence , series 2 the references to Madonna's like a prayer , this is not the version available from the UK  or  Australia - most disappointing !",1381622400,,272,4.891304347826087

2923040,4,B000UNYPGM,"I love Absolutely Fabulous and was excited to order the whole series. Although the outside of the packaging is great the inside needs to be updated to allow for easier access to the discs, it's a tight fit and the constant in/out makes it highly likely that the discs will become scratched making them unusable.",1380758400,,311,4.672727272727273

2923043,4,B000UNYPGM,nice to watch something that is just a little different from the norm lately.... and it was fun to see the various guests that would show up throughout the series.,1376956800,,163,4.466666666666667
2923044,5,B000UNYPGM,if you are a fan of british humor than this is it. Jennifer Saunders has a wonderful mind for comedy.,1376956800,,101,4.1
2923045,5,B000UNYPGM,"absolutely fabulous is one of the funniest britcom shows i have ever watched. i grew up watching AbFab on BBC, and i wish they still ran the show.",1376265600,,146,4.25
2923046,5,B000UNYPGM,"This show takes me back to being 12 years old, watching ""Comedy Central"" when it was awesome, and they used to re-run this show, when they first brought it to the US, from BBC. I was totally hooked, not to mention I don't think my parents actually knew how deep the material was. If they had, I'm sure they wouldnt have let me watch. However, watching re-runs of ""Are you being served"" with my dad, even younger, I'm sure they thought Ab Fab was just another funny british show. Anyway, I bought seasons 1-3 on dvd years ago, never thinking I'd buy this complete version. Then, last year for my birthday, I aquired four 50$ amazon gift cards, and I decided it was time. Gave my seasons 1-3 to a good friend, to pay it forward:) I love this dvd set.",1372118400,,748,4.3120567375886525
2923047,4,B000UNYPGM,"The first set I ordered was defective and wouldn't work in my DVD player.  I decided to try it once more and I'm glad I did!  The replacement set works fine.  It's a little annoying that they don't put all the episodes on one disk instead of two.  And the DVD jackets are not very disk-friendly.  Otherwise, it's a great collection and I'm very pleased.",1371254400,,353,4.369230769230769
2923048,5,B000UNYPGM,"This was a Christmas gift for a friend, an long time Ab Fab fan, and she was thrilled!  The packaging was really nice too.",1370908800,,122,4.083333333333333
2923049,5,B000UNYPGM,"From Edinna and Patsy to Saffy ,Grand and of course ""bobble"" , they are all here and all captured on DVD for us to enjoy over and over again and again. Humor that is timeless and never dulls or changes.  A must have for the collectors or great Britt-Com Humor",1370044800,,259,4.18
2923050,2,B000UNYPGM,"The case is really, really nice, and the presentation is to die for. However, a couple of episodes were completely unwatchable, and many of the episodes had blips in them (parts I had to skip). For the price I paid for this collection, that's absurd. Plus, Amazon Prime piked up AbFab shortly after I made this purchase...",1368748800,,322,4.666666666666667
2923051,1,B000UNYPGM,I ordered this and had to return it because the disks were skipping on both my DVD players. The replacements I received won't play at all but I'm stuck with them because I wasn't able to test them before the return window expired. These are badly manufactured. Don't waste your money on them.,1366243200,2,292,4.528301886792453
2923052,3,B000UNYPGM,"I just received this today so I haven't had a chance to watch and make sure all the discs work...I'll probably be updating this eventually, when I get around to it.

I hate to give this anything less than 5 stars but I don't have a choice. The packaging, overall, is beautiful...the shiny, silver, quilted cover with the metallic name plate on the front...it looks great at first. Then I unwrapped it from the plastic. I realized that the silver is flaking off, like it's some sort of paint. This is happening around the edges and in the corners. What's underneath is a really hideous light yellow/brown color...

The cardboard pages inside are all glued in at an angle which makes the book uneven and I've noticed some of the cardboard slips that hold the DVDs are way too tight, that leads to scratching. Seems like this was just carelessly thrown together without much thought.

Like I said, it's beautiful at first, really great design...however, it's poorly executed. It feels cheap and now that the silver is flaking off, it looks cheap too. I realize my ranting may seem a little OCD but I collect DVD's and TV show sets and I want good quality, I take very good care of them and it'd be nice if things like this didn't so easily happen. Oh well, at least I have one of my favorite shows on DVD...IF they play. Time will tell.

UPDATE! 4/21/13. Got through all the discs and I'm happy to say that each one worked perfectly. No issues at all.",1365724800,4,1448,4.494296577946768
2923053,5,B000UNYPGM,I really enjoyed catching up with this series. It is funny and great. I love jennifer Saunders and Joanna lumley. They are great together,1364256000,,137,4.75

2923058,5,B000UNYPGM,"It is so nice to have the whole show in one package.
They did a great job by making it small enough to store.
Nothing can be said that hasn't already been said about AB FAB.
Super funny.",1358035200,,186,3.9210526315789473

2923062,3,B000UNYPGM,I love this show. I think for all the discs the price was terrific...however 2 of the discs skip and freeze frame....I don't know if there are more that skip because I haven't watched them all yet,1355184000,2,196,4.324324324324325
2923063,4,B000UNYPGM,"to all ab fab fans,

this is definitely the collection of all collections for the ab fab series! however do note that after having it for 6 months, the faux leather cover began to break up and tear! the discs comes in those paper sleeves. so its a great collection, pity the cover :-( could not last.

fyi the UK version comes in the same cover design but is printed on hard paper and the discs all come in their own plastic dvd casing.

take note sweetie, darlings!",1354665600,,466,4.2727272727272725
2923064,3,B000UNYPGM,"I really love this show for the way it introduced women to the world of popular comedy. Patsy and Eddie are very funny, if not a little vulgar. The vulgarity of the program proves to be tolerable because, Pats, Eddie and Saffie go so well together. I felt that Patsy and Eddie have a very  close, special bond. It is rare to see a friendship like this demonstrated and maintained in a comedy show. Joanna Lumley is brilliant.",1352419200,,425,4.448717948717949
2923065,5,B000UNYPGM,This full collection made a great surprise birthday gift along with the 20th anniversary specials. If you like brit-coms like Fawlty Towers you will love AbFab,1352332800,,159,5.153846153846154

Totally worth it, trust me!!",1351641600,,115,4.523809523809524
2923067,4,B000UNYPGM,"I bought this for my girlfriend, who, loves it.  I have to admit I enjoy Ab Fab also, but I think a lot is lost in translation from British humor and colloquialisms.

Personally, I find season 5 tube the funniest.

My understanding is that there is another season, not included with this set (season 6).

Nice packaging, but the silver cloth cover came slightly worn (new item) and I expect it will deteriorate over time.

Great gift for anyone that enjoys Ab Fab",1348876800,,463,4.530120481927711
2923068,5,B000UNYPGM,This is my favorite series of all time. Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley are perfection as Edina and Patsy. Somehow they make narcissism and overendulgence endearing! I loved watching the series from beginning to end. Only regret is that I wish more of the episodes included Jennifer Saunders' commentary because the ones that did were very interesting.,1348099200,,356,5.2631578947368425
2923069,5,B000UNYPGM,"I bought this AbFab boxed set about two years ago and I must say this little silver book of DVDs has been used a LOT!  My 70 year old Mom is now a HUGE FAN of AbFab and can quote lines.  Clearly, this is NOT for everyone!  BUT, if you are a fan or know someone who is, this is THE GIFT to give or give yourself!  AND, the price is just plain amazing!  It was good 2 years ago and now it is amazing.  DON'T PAY THE HIGH PRICE ON THE WEB, just get it at Amazon!  Can't recommend it enough, but again, only if you know what you are buying!  Great, Funny, Hysterical hours of enjoyment and near out-of-body laughing for sure!",1346803200,,621,3.9516129032258065
2923070,5,B000UNYPGM,I was slightly nervous when making my purchase due to some of the disc quality/errors some reviewers were reporting.

2923071,5,B000UNYPGM,"I mean the title speaks for itself, but I just love the packaging. It's spectacularly fitting! Patsy and Eddie are hilarious and I just can't seem to get enough of them. Thanks goodness for Sweetie Darling, Saffie. This show needs a voice of reason. Ab-Fab is outrageously hilarious.",1345334400,,283,4.916666666666667
2923072,5,B000UNYPGM,"I received my set the other day and have really enjoyed watching the full episodes, uncut and without commercial interruptions. I had forgotten a lot of the early episodes but it's just as funny now as it was when I viewed these episodes on Comedy Central almost 20 years ago. I can't add much to what other reviewers have mentioned but I do want to comment on the packaging.

I have not had any issues with skipping or scratching of the discs...although I'm only through 3 of the discs. I don't know what other people have been complaining about; I haven't had any trouble removing the discs from their cardboard casings. Unless you're ravenous and ripping the discs out of the cases, you shouldn't have any trouble removing or returning the discs.

I'm thrilled to have the entire series in one package, other than the new season, currently airing in Britain.",1341964800,,861,4.695364238410596

2923074,5,B000UNYPGM,"I just adore the AbFab series. My collection arrived promptly and in immaculate condition. The British duo are a riot. From fashion to mixed-race babies, Patsy and Edina have done it and seen it all. Totally worth every cent.",1335830400,,225,4.794871794871795

2923078,5,B000UNYPGM,"Just got my DVD collection today, and it's as I expected.  One of the funniest Brit-coms of all time.  I ordered it Wednesday night, but being a South Carolinian with a distribution center in our state, I got it in less than 48 hours.  Thanks Amazon.com!  People that are spoiled to the point of wanting HD from an early 90s show need to realize we didn't have HD back then.  The BBC did the best they could, and just having it on the big screen is awesome!  HIGHLY recommend, for anyone born prior to Reagan being the President in the US.  After that, get off your high horse and realize we had to go with what we had to work with.  Those giving this low ratings ""should have your tiny tongue removed, dahling"".  Those of use in Generation X and before, BUY IT!",1329436800,3,762,4.2727272727272725

No other DVDs I've bought from Amazon have these problems on the older player.  Tried to contact Amazon Help about this flaw so they could maybe prevent this from happening to other customers but the Amazon site doesn't seem to have any options for this type of situation.

For the price, it is very reasonable to get everything from this incredible series. Can't believe that the show is now again in production with 4 new specials.

I was worried about it reading some of the other reviews about scratched and malfunctioning disks, but I feel like those situations are probably exceptions rather than rules. And I haven't had any issues with the cardboard sleeves scratching them up when I take them out either. Maybe I am just extra super careful? I don't know.

What I want to know is, are these rehashed previous releases with music replacements and etc?  Or did they remaster the episodes, thus restoring the following:

""Wheel's on Fire"" theme in the Season 2 disc, and seemingly everything after Season 3?

Compare the British version of The Office with the American one and you'll see what I mean. Ricky Gervais is far more venal and infinitely less sympathetic than his American counterpart.

There is nothing quite like AbFab in American TV, and more's the pity. The unapologetic antics of two narcissistic, substance-abusing wretches (who haven't quite figured out how wretched they are) are a wonder to behold. Edwina ""manages"" a fashion magazine with no discernible sense of taste or skill, and former fashion model Patsy seems to live her glamorous, parasitic lifestyle mooching off others and playing Iago to Edwina's Othello.

2923145,5,B000UNYPGM,"Perhaps the greatest British sitcom to ever come out of England, ""Absolutely Fabulous"" has made a name for itself not just in its native homeland, but around the globe, most notably North America, for being an outstanding and extremely funny show. I first came across the series on CBC in Canada when it aired as a late night comedy in the nineties. At first I had a hard time with the English dialect, for some Brits do talk fast and are hard to understand. However, what I realized about the series was its insane humor and I grew to love the show and its sometimes oddball characters. The series is mainly about two best friends, Edina and Patsy, who have a lot of money and who spend their days doing drugs and drinking and enjoying life without worry or care. Edina has a daughter, Saffy, who has inherited the mother role from her parent as she is constantly making sure Edina behaves herself and watches her health. Without a doubt it is Joanna Lumley, who plays Patsy (or Pats) who steals the show. With her Ivanna Trump hair and outrageous clothes sense, Patsy not only is the funniest character but the most campy. Jennifer Saunders (Edina) actually wrote every single episode of the series and to say she is a genius is an understatement. How many stars of hits sitcoms can say they wrote all the show's scripts? This beautiful boxset contains all the episodes of this beloved television classic along with a slew of bonuses including interviews as well as the series' pilot called ""Mirrorball"". There are a few items missing in the boxset including the Comedy Relief scit that Saunders and Lumley did for the BBC in 2005 as well an informative documentary on the series that aired in England. All of the episodes are also available in other releases known as Series Sets. In England some shows refers to their seasons as ""series"". Keep in mind though that in this exclusive boxset some consumers have complained about how the dics are enclosed in tight cardboard leading to the dics becoming scratched. I only wished Warner Brothers would have done a better job in the packaging, but at least the show is availble here for posterity. So, have a glass of wine, light a cigarette, and put on ""Absolutely Fabulous"". You will laugh out silly! One final note: the FOX network bought the show in 2009 and a pilot was filmed with Jennifer Saunders as executive producer and a fall 2009 debut was scheduled, but unfortunately at the last minute the network got cold feet and dropped the series.",1259798400,3,2498,4.666666666666667

Although this series is generally known as a ""female show,"" I as a male, have enjoyed every moment of the intense insanity the cast delivers in this crazier-than-thou collection of drug and alcohol driven characters and the things they do everyday.

Lucy and Ethel would cringe at this situational comedy with the edgy subjects and the ocassional slapstick thrown in for a few more laughs.

2923151,5,B000UNYPGM,"Came just as advertised.  I read other reviews, most of which were positive, and am happy I got it through Amazon.  It was $30.00+ less expensive than getting it at a store, even with the cost of quick shipping.  I agree with one other review about the DVD's needing to be in a different type of holder.  The cardboard they are in isn't very durable, you have to slide the DVD's in and out of them running the risk of scratching, plus they are very tight, making it hard to even get a hold of the DVD to get them out.  But, I am still happy with the product!  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for this box set.",1251936000,3,612,4.100840336134453
2923152,5,B000UNYPGM,"A friend had me watch this show with her and I thought she was nuts when she was laughing uproariously throughout it.  I didn't find it funny and I didn't like the two middle aged flakey women who were its stars.  Fast Forward to a year later. I put it on my own DVD player and began watching, not expecting much of anything....AND I LOVED IT!!! Part of the problem may be that it has taken me awhile to ""get"" British humor.  Now, even though I get it most of the time, I still don't get it the first time necessarily.

I've since read that Jennifer Saunders, writer and one of the leads, actually met a real life woman in Britain who lived like this character and Saunders based the entire series on her.  The woman has a son instead of a daughter but basically the rest of it is true.  There was no matching friend though as there is in the series.  It seems incredible to me that there really is someone like this in the real world but truth often is very strange.

Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley play the two women, Edina and Patsy, two women left over from the counter culture, rock and roll, heavy drug use, let it all hang out days.  Patsy has made it fairly big in fashion writing and Edina likewise in PR. The reason for their success is that these two have never met a fad or a trend which they didn't embrace completely.  Edina has a teenage daughter and two ex-husbands.  Patsy remained single.

The daughter Saffy is the straight character as she is the practical, self reliant one in between these two ditzes.  That Edina and Patsy would fly the Concorde to New York from London just to find a doorknob is the epitome of the absurdist line of their thinking.

These two remind me of Lucy and Ethel from I LOVE LUCY.  Yes, on the surface they would appear to be completely different comic duos. For one, Edina and Patsy have money to burn whereas Lucy and Ethel had more limited means.  However, both duos were capable of doing ANYTHING once they set their minds to doing or getting something.

Perhaps the thing I like best about this series is that if you feel down or depressed, Edina and Patsy can lift you out of the dumps and into the heights of lunacy.

2923156,1,B000UNYPGM,"This is not a review of the BBC show Absolutely Fabulous. I like the show or I wouldn't have purchased this set. This is a review of the packaging. And when it comes to DVD's the packaging and transfer are as important as the show itself at least to those of us who care about quality.

I am amazed (though I shouldn't be by now) at how much time, effort, and money corporations put into the external packages of DVD sets and how little thought they put into the containers for the DVDs themselves (see Stargate SG1 Box Set...see Milestone I Am Cuba set...see The Wire box set...see the early Buffy and Angel season sets). I guess they assume (probably rightly I am sad to say if comments on Amazon are a guide) that for most consumers a sexy cover is more important than DVD substance. The recent Absolutely Fabulous DVD Complete set proves this point (if further proof is needed) once again.

This Absolutely Fabulous box may be ""cool"" and ""sexy"" to some. But for someone like me who cares more about the DVD's than the sexy container it leaves much to be desired. All the DVD's in the set are (unfortunately) packaged in cardboard (very tightly in cardboard I might add) and inevitably get scratched when you try to remove them (quite a task given the tightness of the cardboard holder). Now you may want to spend new money on used looking ""new"" discs but I don't. That is why I will be returning my set to Amazon for a refund and urging consumers out there not to buy this set until WB changes the packaging to something that is more DVD friendly.",1235174400,123,1551,4.43859649122807

It is such a kick to watch a comedic body of work like this from inception to end. You just want it to go on and on and on. Jane Horrocks' ""Bubble"" character is a real treat every time she enters an episode. What inspired absurdity! She would have been right at home in the Python cast.

So, it's so wonderful to finally have all the seasons and all the specials in one nice box. Out with the old collection of seasons in different boxes and in with this new set! And speaking of presentation, this set is wonderful. The casing is this really shiny silvery fabric and the interior is colorful and very well put together. There's even a cute leopard-print like bookmark that is attached to the set!!!! So, we are thrilled with this release.
