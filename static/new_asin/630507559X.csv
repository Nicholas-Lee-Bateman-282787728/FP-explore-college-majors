964634,5,630507559X,"This is the definitive collection of historically important early silent film archives.  This DVD, put out by Image, contains a vast amount of silent shorts, including ""The Great Train Robbery,"" and the first ever animated caroon, ""Funny Faces"".  Some of these shorts are meticulously hand-colored, for instance, the red smoke from just about every gun shot in the sixteen minute, ""The Great Train Robbery"".  There is piano accompianiment that accompanies all of these films, so they aren't really silent.  The musical cues of the piano track to the films are perfectly accurate.  All in all, Image Entertainment has done a great job with this one.  Also check out Landmarks, Vol. 2, and Nosferatu, both silent movie DVDs put out by Image.",1042675200,11,739,5.066115702479339

The two  landmark narrative films are presented here: ""A Trip to the Moon""  includes the original narration as Melies intended, and ""The Great  Train Robbery"" includes the original color tinting.  And even though  the link for ""The Great Train Robbery"" at the bottom of this page  points to IMDB's page for the 1904 remake, the version on the DVD is Edwin  S. Porter's original 1903 version.  Among the later films on this DVD,  ""The Policemen's Little Run"" is hilarious, and it offers  excellent images from 1907 Paris.  I haven't even watched the last two  films on this disc.

964637,5,630507559X,"I suppose watching Landmarks of Early Film is the closest we will come to traveling back in time to the late-19th century. One has a very intimate and visceral sense of the subjects that are being recorded. For many of the  selections, there is no sense of performance as one might see in a modern  documentary, as the people being filmed obviously have little or no idea  that their activities are being captured.
Most striking about this  collection was the obvious speed with which film created and refined itself  as an art form. While there is an awkward experimentalism to the very early  films, one soon sees an amazing flowering of techniques and uses for the  new medium.
This is obviously a very well crafted collection, created by  individuals who truly love the subject matter. The quality of the films is  great, and the selection well thought-out.",958521600,27,861,4.802721088435374

It's especially  nice to have full films, rather than clips. I also find it very interesting  to see what was considered humorous at the time. In the 1905 film,  ""The Whole Dam Family, and the Dam Dog"", for example, there is  minimal action, the humor coming from wordplay in the titles which may seem  juvenile today, but at the same time show great playfulness. This is just  one of the many pleasures to be found on this incredible disc.

A modern restoration could take care of some of the jitter and flickering, but until someone does that restoration, this is a great set of prints.

Fortunately, there is no narration (as people have complained about re: other editions of these films) other than a reading of Melius' own narration of the Trip to the Moon.  It's intended for your enjoyment rather than as a textbook commentary of early video.",1327708800,,680,4.895652173913043
964853,4,630507559X,"This review pertains to the Le Voyage dans la lune and The Great Train Robbery. Among the early pioneering efforts in silent film, the Great Train Robbery may be considered the first Western ever, it pioneered cross cutting and on location filming (among other film techniques). Le Voyage dans la lune is considered by many to be the first sci-fi film ever and is the most famous of the Lumiere shots, the image of its moon with a spaceship in its eye is one the most famous images in cinema history.

It makes you ponder on the advances man has made in the last 100 years.  Great moving snapshots of the early 1900's - and later on, when they introduce hand-tinted color into the films, it's a wonderful touch, both cheesey and artsy at the same time.

964859,5,630507559X,What can I even begin to say about this DVD. I am really new to the world of silent cinema as it is but I'm loving it and this DVD in particular. To see with such clarity these wondrous films that are truly the birth of cinema is just amazing. The early shots of scenes from everyday life are interesting for their simplicity and look into life at the time (and it isn't so different sometimes which is even more amazing to see captured on film). The proper stories are fun as well though. The simplicity of films like The Great Train Robbery or The Policeman's Little Run while still being entertaining 100 years on is a testament to the power of good storytelling. I would highly recommend this to anyone with even a passing interest in movies before the advent of giant studios (and a must for aspiring film students I'm sure).,1238457600,,830,4.431372549019608

I'm looking at this DVD with an upscaling DVD player on a High Definition Video Projector on a huge screen, so I'm seeing many more transfer flaws than most people, and really that was my only complaint. I was specifically looking for a good copy of George Melie's Trip to the Moon, and I was certainly happy to also get copies of many famous and Historic films, such as the Lumiere' and Edison films, but I know there can be better transfers of these films. If you are looking at this collection on a standard HDTV or TV, you'll be fine, but if you are using a projector and a huge screen, like me, you'll want to try some other copies of these films. For instance, the new George Melie's collection from David Shepard is stunning in comparison. I'm talking about the quality of the Video Transfer it's self. These films are very old and I know it's hard to find good elements to use when they make DVD's, but I've seen much better transfers. I know it can be done.",1209600000,21,1021,4.350785340314136
965002,5,630507559X,"My Husband and I really enjoyed this DVD. It is very interesting, and fun to watch, and too cool! It feels like you are going back 100 years, as it would have been at a mid day show at a small theater. Just great, highly recomended!!",1198540800,,233,4.086956521739131
965003,5,630507559X,"This is an amazing collection of early films, ranging from 1877 to 1913. While some are longer pieces, most -- especially the early ones -- are just quick vignettes. I could see why A Trip to the Moon is considered to be such an important film as it was the first film on the disc to tell a story. Previous films were just scenes -- someone getting sprayed with a hose, men playing cards, a father feeding his baby lunch -- but not long narratives like A Trip to the Moon (which is fourteen minutes in length.)

The quality of these old films is excellent. Given the age of the film, these are some of the clearest, best-maintained old bits of film I've ever seen. The musical soundtrack laid over them is non-intrusive and pleasant and seems to have been carefully fit to the images rather than the hack-and-paste job of matching music to silent film I've seen on too many other discs.

One drawback to this disc is that there is a voice-over narration for A Trip to the Moon. The narration does make it much clearer what's occuring in the shots but I would have liked more information about the narration. How old is it? Was it taken from an original source or was it written in modern times? The narration was presented in English with a French accent that was sometimes a strain for me to follow.

If you are at all interested in the history of cinema, this would be an excellent disc to pick up. the films are arranged in chronological order, allowing the viewer to experience the evolution of film in its infancy. I was impressed to see how quickly both the use of the medium and the quality of the technology improved in the first twenty or thirty years of movie-making.

This is also a good choice for general history buffs as many of the vignettes are apparently unstaged scenes of daily life: women in big hats leaving the factory after a day of work, riders on horses swimming a river, a legless beggar being pulled in his cart by a dog, the milkman delivering milk and cream to housewives, and so on. A scene of two babies fighting over a toy is breathtaking for the lace Edwardian clothing the children wear and the beautiful toys they are quarrelling about.

(nudity warning: the first vignettes on the disc are series photography pieces of naked or topless women walking up and down stairs, hopping on one foot, etc. I assume these came from the early coin-operated, hand-cranked pornography machines.)

Taken as a collection, I couldn't give this disc higher praise. It is an excellent archive of early film history.",1187222400,5,2532,4.553846153846154
965004,5,630507559X,"This DVD is very similar to a VHS tape issued by another distributor, Kino Video, ""The Movies Begin, Vol. I."" That the contents are similar is no surprise, as both are derived from the Film Preservation Associates' archives. The DVD is longer than the VHS tape (117 min.  vs. 75 min.), and contains more material. Missing from the DVD is a wonderful sequence found in the VHS: ""Moscow in the Snow"" (1908). This Pt documentary provides panoramic shots of pre-revolutionary Moscow, as well as vignettes of the inhabitants. It is such a delight that its exclusion represents a serious loss.

The earliest example included are ""pre-movies-movies"" consisting of a sequence of E. Muybridge's stills (1885) assembled into films. The effect is very interesting, even today. Muybridge used trip-wires and multiple cameras to obtain a sequence of stills. When Muybridge first published his stop-action motion studies they were positively revolutionary. One of Muybridge's accomplishments was to settle -- once and for all -- the question whether a running horse ever has all four feet off the ground (It does!  Unfortunately this segment is not included.) Incidentally, Muybridge's sequences also provide a glimpse of the feminine figure of 100 years ago, and how it might differ from today's ideal.

This is followed by selected Edison Kinetoscopes (ca. 1894); of these I found the ""serpentine dances"" most interesting. (A dance form no longer practiced, except perhaps in Chinese opera.) Later on there appear additional vignettes. Some, such as the one of President McKinley, the San Francisco Earthquake, and gold prospectors crossing over the Chilkoot Pass, have obvious historical interest.

Five sequences are of special interest:

1) S. Porter's ""The Great Train Robbery,"" is a seminal work which set the framework for countless westerns to follow.

2) ""A Girl and her Trust"" is similar to the above, but better. It even has ""feminist"" elements.

3) ""Nero, or the Fall of Rome"" is entertaining, if historically inaccurate: Nero did fall, but Rome did not fall until several centuries later. Nero's troubled relationship with Poppaea Sabina is the subject. Perhaps what it intends is that Nero's evil was amplified by Poppaea, and this set the tone for future emperors, eventually resulting in Rome's downfall. (The historian Josephus however tells of a very different Poppaea: A deeply religious woman who urged Nero to show compassion.)

For me, without question the two best works on this tape are: 1) George Melies's ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"" (Voyage to the Moon) of 1902; and 2) S. Chomon's ""Le Scarabee d'Or"" (Golden Beetle) of 1907.

The ""Golden Beetle"" is a fantasy piece, with similarities to Rimsky-Korsakov's fairytale operas - except of course there is no singing, and it is only 2 minutes long. Synopsis: A sorcerer captures a golden beetle and by means of a magic fire cauldron turns it into a woman. Or perhaps she is a fairy, as she has three pairs of wings. From his unbounded glee, we suspect the sorcerer's intentions are not quite honorable. The fairy however, turns out to be more than the sorcerer had bargained for. My means of two assistants (whose miraculous appearance is unexplained) she throws the sorcerer into the fire cauldron, from whence he disappears. The moral? Perhaps it is similar to ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (remember Mickey and the brooms): don't mess with powerful things you don't fully understand. Or maybe that old men should not have an interest in young women. But ultimately it does not matter, because the plot seems merely a backdrop for the technical wizardry. Segundo de Chomon worked closely with Melies, and was heavily influenced by him. Chomon's specialty was early experimentation with color film, of which ""Golden Beetle"" is a good example. The coloring process involved hand coloring of individual frames, and was obviously very labor intensive. Chomon also experimented with more automated color techniques.

For me the piece de resistance of this collection is George Melies's ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"" (Voyage to the Moon) of 1902. This work has great historical interest as the first science fiction film produced. But the genre is peculiar: it is slapstick science fiction - a form occasionally still used, such as in ""Mars Attacks.""

After slapstick, the film is best characterized as an amalgam of J. Verne's ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and H. G. Wells's ""First Men in the Moon."" The first part of the movie roughly follows Verne's novel: a group of scientists use a giant canon to travel to the moon. The second part roughly follows Wells: the moon travelers discover a civilization of intelligent beings living under the surface of the moon. The travelers manage to get home safely among great rejoicing.

Melies had an abiding interest in science, especially astronomy, and science fiction. It is of interest to note that his scientists tend to be absent-minded, eccentric, and even buffoonish. They are unable to function without the help of down-to-earth assistants (e.g., telescope carriers). All this is very reminiscent of Swift's ""flappers"" from the ""La Puta"" section of ""Gulliver's Travels.""

Why slapstick? Probably Melies thought the audience of 1902 was not ready for a more scientific approach. This had to await ""Die Frau im Mond"" of 1929, and ""Destination Moon"" of 1950.

The science in this movie is best described as ""absolutely pathetic"" (possibly intentionally so). The movie is good training for school children assigned to ""find all the mistakes."" Two egregious examples: 1) the travelers have absolutely no problem breathing on the lunar surface; and 2) to return to Earth they simply fall off the edge of the Moon (ouch!).

Many viewers are familiar with at least one scene from this movie: the space capsule hitting the man-in-the-moon smack in the eye. This sequence has been excerpted many times - though most people may not know its origin. A second, almost as famous, sequence is the chorus line of beauties giving the travelers a spectacular send-off. (Should NASA consider such a format for its launches?)",1183075200,5,6100,5.109437751004016

965006,5,630507559X,"Although some of the films on here do overlap with some of the other early film DVDs out there (such as the Edison set and 'The Lumire Brothers' First Films'), there are also some films on here that can't be found anywhere else, and it provides a very nice introduction to the subject for someone who's just getting into these very early short films from the dawn of motion pictures.  Categories include the Edison films, films by the Lumire Brothers, a Keystone short (featuring the charming Mabel Normand in the leading role), a Biograph short, a Max Linder short, short French films, short documentary-style films, and the two very early film classics 'Le Voyage Dans la Lune' and 'The Great Train Robbery' (the latter with beautifully select hand-coloring).  Basically, it gives the viewer a good sampling of the various different types of films being made from the 1890s to the early Teens.  These very early films are like literally looking back in time, at this bygone world, a world where the moving image was so new and revolutionary that people didn't care the movies only lasted under a minute and showed things like employees leaving a factory or two babies quarreling, since they'd never seen these miraculously moving pictures before.  It also opens with the short 1994 film 'Homage to Eadweard Muybridge,' who invented the zoopraxiscope, which projected a series of pictures in a way that suggested movement.  He was one of the pioneers in the invention of the motion picture, even though here we're seeing series photography (from 1877-85), not actual motion pictures.  (Those who are offended by such things should be aware that the woman in these series photography ""films"" is naked, at times partially and at other times fully, though there's absolutely nothing sexual or pornographic here; it's just a series of images of a woman who so happens to not have any clothes on.)

My one complaint about this disc (other than the mislabelling of 'I.B. Dam and the Whole Dam Family' as 'The Whole Dam Family and the Dam Dog') is that most of the films don't have any dates given.  Even if one is already familiar with the films from this era instead of a new fan, it's still nice to have them placed into historic context and to see the years they were all made.  Some bonus features also would have been nice, to have provided, say, some background to the films, the people who made them, the restoration process, and what film-making was like in these very early days.  It's always nice to have supplemental information to enjoy and appreciate these antique films even more.",1169337600,7,2589,4.823927765237021
965007,5,630507559X,"This set consists of 40 short films and series photographs shot between 1894 and 1913. Arranged in roughly chronological order, with the earlier pieces subdivided into categories (""Edison Kinetoscopes,"" ""Lumiere Films,"" ""Actualities""), they present an overview of the early silent era of motion pictures. Most people have seen stills or excerpts from such films as ""A Voyage to the Moon"" and ""The Great Train Robbery,"" but seldom have people had the chance to experience such pioneering works in their entirety. This is not a disc for everybody. Only those who have a keen interest in the development of motion pictures at their earliest phase will appreciate it. If you are one of those, like me, consider this a must buy.

In addition to scripted comedies and dramas, there are a number of films that simply record everyday life at the turn of the last century. There is ""Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat"", which is said to have panicked early audiences who failed to grasp that the approaching train wasn't going to come through the screen and run them over. Other films, such as ""Snowball Fight"" and ""Seminary Girls"" are staged with the intent of creating the appearance of spontaneity. Either way, these rarely seen films are important documents of a recent past that is so different from our present that it's hard to believe that they were shot only a century ago.

The Dolby Digital mono sound is clear and well presented. Many of the films are tastefully scored with newly recorded piano music, while others are paired with period recordings. ""Skyscrapers of New York City From North River,"" for example, is particularly haunting when viewed with its mysterious, unidentified musical accompaniment drifting from the speakers. A good number of films in this collection date back to the 1890's, and a lot of them are a lot better looking than I would have thought. Some films, like Train Robbery, even have their original hand painted color tints intact. One of the neat things about the DVD is the freeze frame, because I was able to spot a single frame in one of the Kinetiscope films that was slipped in to read ""Copyright 1907 T.A. Edison."" This is not a disc that's about features, other than being able to zip from film to film versus fast forwarding on VHS, nor is it one to show off your home theatre. This is a film for those with a serious interest film history only.",1167955200,4,2383,4.767554479418886
965008,5,630507559X,"Many of these ""primitives"" appear in DVD collections, but that's the problem -- you have to search for these classics through a number of sets.  Well, here they are on a single DVD!  This disc begins with an homage to Eadweard Muybridge, the pioneer of series photography.  Then there are early Edison kinetoscope films (1894-96), including ""The Kiss"" and ""Serpentine Dances,"" which prompted some of the earliest criticisms of film.  The Lumiere brothers' films (1895-97) here include ""Exiting the Factory,"" ""Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat,"" and an early comedic scene called ""The Sprinkler Sprinkled.""  Also on this single disc is Georges Melies's ""A Trip to the Moon"" (1902), which with its early special effects, celebrates the magic possibilities of the new medium.  And what has been called the ""first Western"" is also here -- Edwin S. Porter's ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903) -- the first movie to use editing, intercutting of scenes, and a mobile camera to tell a relatively sophisticated story.  There are even historic actualities, including a look at San Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake and fire that devastated that city.  Totalling nearly two hours, there is probably no better single DVD of early landmark films.  This is a ""must have"" for any serious film collector.",1130112000,6,1300,5.065727699530516

A minor point with a collection like this, but a definite niggle.
Still - what we have here is a fabulous 2-hour collection.  I think only one hiccup in the descriptions has been identified elsewhere (The film billed as 'The Whole Dam Family and The Dam Dog' is actually 'I B Dam and the Whole Dam Family', its remake, but the original title certainly suits this charming little vignette) and this is a rich selection ranging from the earliest attempts by Edison and the Lumieres to capture events and people on film, to more sophisticated stories by Edwin S Porter, Georges Melies, DW Griffith, and others.
There's a lot to see and admire here, and I didn't spot one dud amongst the whole collection.  There's so much more that has survived from this era in early film and surely it is time to make more examples widely available?",1082592000,13,1071,4.510309278350515

7882863,2,630507559X,"While it's nice to have all of these early cinematic efforts on one disc, the fact that the Flicker Alley release has no chapter stops at all make this DVD pretty useless as a reference or educational source. 46 short films and no way to access them other than by fast forwarding through the whole disc. Is there no way to create chapter stops on on-demand disc offerings or was Flicker Alley just very sloppy on this release?",1464739200,4,426,4.4743589743589745

7882865,5,630507559X,"Today we are consumed with the high speed computer, visions at the touch of a button, stories bursting off the huge silver screen, out of our home monitors,  off our cell phones.....everywhere.  This first installment of the history of the ""ancient"" development of film, we all take for granted today, was the origin of a major new art form.  This is not unlike the origin of painting, drawing, or sculpture.  A visual ""anomaly,"" with dialogue (developed later), pretend backdrops to increase the flavor of the story atmosphere, direction, then finally, the actors themselves.  How did this all begin?  Where did it first happen?  What kinds of movies were the vogue in early days past?  The story on this DvD addresses these questions and many more for the developing film art historian and film enthusiast.  So...take the journey, and try to visualize yourself what it might have been like when these images moved across a flat screen for the very first time.",1402444800,,961,4.919254658385094

7882867,3,630507559X,I had to watch this for my Film Studies Class. It was very informative but if you are not into the history of early films... its a bit of a yawn. The best part of the film for me was A Trip to the Moon. I found that to be a narrative story with some creative graphics and special effects.,1384300800,,288,3.816666666666667
