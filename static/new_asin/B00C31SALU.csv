8576925,5,B00C31SALU,"I borrowed this DVD from a resource library. I was not sure what to expect. It's full of very practical ideas to help regulate (emotions, attention, behavior) of kids with ADHD, autism, sensory issues, or similar struggles. She covered a wide range of topics--from sensory issues to attention to behavior modification. I loved the breadth and practicality. She also provided at home, school, or clinic options for untrained people/those with limited funds for professionals to safely do non-professional/at home versions of brushing therapy, listening therapy, metronome work, and similar. The DVD is just full of practical ideas.",1444176000,,630,5.505154639175258
