7821223,5,6302101956,"This movie has 'soul' (something that is vanishing from our world quickly). The character of CJ Thunderbird is a ""man of honor"" and possesses the old unwritten code that most people today wouldn't even understand. Awesome movie. 5 Stars.",1237939200,2,237,5.102564102564102
7821224,4,6302101956,"I wasn't sure about this title, as I had never heard of it before and knew nothing about the lead actor - George Rivero.  My reason for purchasing this film was Matthias Hues.  He is a largely built machine of approx. 6'5"", playing the villain's role in many martial art films.  Though this is not a martial arts film, I decided to check it out anyways to see what he was capable of in this one.

Matthias wasn't the only one who got my attention, but the lead charcater did too.  George Rivero plays the fist fighter - named C.J. Thunderbird.  An older man, but he is extremely built and cut for someone his age.  As an actor, he wasn't too bad and as a fighter in the film he was fun to watch.

The story was a bit more in depth than I expected too.  It begins as a quest for revenge, as C.J. travels south of the border to get revenge on the man who killed his friend years earlier - the killer being Rhino (Matthias Hues).  C.J. meets a new friend - Punchy - who is an ex-champion and trains C.J.  He eventually fights Rhino, but the fight is iterrupted and C.J. is sent to jail, thanks to Rhino's owner - Vance - who works closely with the local police.  The story slows down a bit while C.J. is in prison, but gets more exciting later on, and he finally meets up with Rhino one last time for a final showdown.

The fights were fun to watch.  There was plenty of fist fighting, both in and out of the prison.  Many of the fights are bloody and some get a little dirty at times.  There is even a scene where Vince goes crazy on Punchy in a restaurant, throwing him into tables and so on.

If you like lots of fists and dirty fighting, you'll enoy this one for the most part.  Its an an entertaining story too, that goes beyond what is typical for b-fight movies.  No Oscar-standouts, but enjoyable overall.",1188000000,3,1810,4.194202898550724
7821225,5,6302101956,This is a great movie about an ex-boxer returning to his South American for revenge. It's a must see!!,1104364800,,102,4.421052631578948
