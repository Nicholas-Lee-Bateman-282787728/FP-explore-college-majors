7801979,5,1935587404,"Lisle combines a very listenable persona with a very good layman's level review of astronomy from the young-earth / young-universe Creationist perspective.  Each of his points could be expanded into a book, and is covered elsewhere by other authors.  This, though, breaks the ice for an audience that is often unexposed to any presentation of material contrary to the prevailing academic dogmas.  He manages to do this without drifting into jargon any more than is necessary for the topic.  it's always good to see the Creationist bull-pen has new, young, and engaging speakers.",1501891200,,578,5.182795698924731
