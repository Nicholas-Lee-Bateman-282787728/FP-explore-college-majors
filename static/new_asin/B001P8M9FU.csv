3742707,4,B001P8M9FU,"I think some of these parents have lost perspective about what they are doing and why. Especially Juliana's dad, he seems kooky about the whole application process. This is preschool and they are 3 year olds! I don't think not getting into a $15,000-$20,000 per semester nursery school will ruin anyone's chances of getting accepted into an Ivy years later. Alot of things can happen in the intervening years. I understand the competition due to the limited number of spots and high number of applicants, but really I think some of these parents are losing sight of what's important. Layla's parents seemed the normal. This documentary was entertaining and fun to watch - I can't believe the pressure some of these parents put on themselves.",1341014400,2,741,4.936
3742708,4,B001P8M9FU,"I was unimpressed by the parents in this film. Why waste all that time and money for glorified daycare? Preschools are nothing more than another name for daycare, using the name preschool in an  attempt to delude parents it is a better option. These kids have nannies for crying out loud, did these parents even consider that spending more time with their children is a better option than daycare? Did they consider reading a book to their child, picking up some books, toys, finger paint and interacting with their child? The answer is most likely no, because it must be easier to pay the nanny, day care, etc than actually doing something yourself. These parents should be ashamed, then again they are most likely already heartless have no feeling. All that matters to them is look at me, I pay $20,000 a semester for my baby to go to daycare while some families survive on $40,000 a year salaries.",1333065600,4,900,4.660377358490566
3742709,4,B001P8M9FU,"Wow...from the ""drunk with power"" admissions advisers to the ""crazy look in her eye"" stepford mom, to the sexually confused super anal dad, this doc is a fun ride beginning to end.  These folks approach the nursery school admissions process with the same vigor as a deluded stalker.  The most fun was watching the the admissions rip the parents to shreds in the decision making process.  This precarious situation gives these teachers some power and they lord it over these foamy mouthed parents with cruel delight. I wish they would have included more footage of this and let it get really nasty. Like any good doc, there are a few redeemable parents and teachers who come across as sympathetic to balance the insanity.

The parents believe that a good nursery school with lead to a good pre-school, etc, etc, until the child eventually makes it to Harvard.  I do think we live in a society that places a value on credentials.  I would be interested in a follow-up with these children or a poll of recent ivy league graduates' nursery schools.  I went to a private liberal arts college and this actually reminded me a lot of the Frat/Sorority rushing process.  The rationale being that if you made it into the right sorority you would have good contacts and get the right job, etc.  Is the notion of contacts a ridiculous idea?  I don't think think so, but I personally think there are other things that are much more important to success.  Gives one something to think about.",1313884800,2,1477,4.686046511627907
3742710,3,B001P8M9FU,"It's a documentary, but almost all of the characters are laughable shells of human beings.  It's an anthropological study, a highly entertaining, hilarious one.

It's all surface agitation.  Little introspection.  No wisdom.  Just yuppies doing what they see their peers doing.  Monkey see monkey do.  No critical ability.  Ants and rats, going to and fro.

Lots of the people featured are first generation largely white newcomers to Manhattan/NYC, and seem unaware that they to an extent chose to enter a highly insular, regimented social milieu with its own arbitrary rules.  They do not recognize that there are million other legitimate ways to live and educate children.

All the parents are reading the one book in print re nursery schools in NYC (by Victoria Goldman) and none of them seem to have thought that there are hundreds of perfectly good schools in other neighborhoods but are completely omitted from this book.

Rent it on Netflix; no need to buy.  You won't want to watch it again.  It's not artsy or timeless.  It's more like social farce lite.",1296777600,18,1063,4.9602272727272725
3742711,4,B001P8M9FU,"the kids were great.  the parents, with the exception of one or two,were much more sympathetic than i expected. it must have a lot to do with money.  the girl who got into all the schools her parents applied to was clearly from the wealthiest family. she's on her way to harvard. worth watching.",1289692800,6,295,4.444444444444445
3742712,5,B001P8M9FU,"I have seen NURSERY UNIVERSITY on cable several times...I watched it with fascination in spite of myself.  Years ago, when I was in my early 20's, I took a break from college and lived and worked in Manhattan...surely the epicenter of the universe, I thought...the place where IT all happened...a place of endless possibilities...provided one had sufficient funds to enjoy it all.  My experience there provided part of my fascination with this movie, which is exceptionally well produced and edited. While the subject matter isn't going to appeal to a wide audience, it has a universality which is compelling...we all want our kids to have every advantage possible, to do whatever we can as parents to give them the education that will propel them ahead and into successful adulthood.  What Nursery University does is examine a minuscule segment of the population that is in the 99th percentile in terms of income and advantage, as a group of parents voluntarily ratchet up their already high stress levels in pursuit of what they have convinced themselves is the ""magic key"" to unlimited possibilities for their offspring. While the saga is engaging and very entertaining, the longer I watched it, the more I kept asking myself: ""what will happen to all those children that DIDN'T make the cut..are they doomed to the periphery?
Furthermore, do these parents REALLY BELIEVE getting a spot in the top play school is going to make that much difference in 20 years?  What about, if after thousands of dollars spent on tuition to all the best schools,  smart little Judy or Johnny finds out being at the top of the heap just isn't what it was cracked up to be.... When the movie ended, I found myself reflecting on what a successful life looks like, and if in the years to come, everyone will think this scramble was honestly worth it...can you ""buy"" success for your child?  One mother whose child didn't get in to their first choice school commented, ""I'm  not used to having to settle for second best anything...""  Was the chase worth it to her?  What do you think she should be able to learn from her ""failure""...and will she?",1287532800,6,2127,4.8054794520547945
3742713,4,B001P8M9FU,"I watched this out of curiosity and it was very interesting, but it's not for the faint of heart, especially if you are looking for a preschool in Manhattan. The anxiety level is through the roof.",1285286400,3,196,4.472222222222222
3742714,5,B001P8M9FU,"This film is uproariously hilarious on many levels.  Sources of laughter include the grammatical errors made by wealthy Manhattan parents and the directors of pricey ($20K per year) nursery schools, the unrelieved seriousness with which they take themselves, and their rock-solid certainty that NYC is the center of the universe.",1277078400,9,329,5.58
3742715,4,B001P8M9FU,"If you like to almost voyeuristically enjoy self-involved parents' emotional ups and downs hanging on their toddlers' placement in preschool, this documentary is for you. Of course all the stories are human and touching, but at almost every turn the viewer is jolted into a more realistic perspective as the parents lose theirs (you could argue they never had any to begin with). One almost feels a bit sorry for these parents who single-mindedly believe or want to believe in the ""feeder school"" system and that preschool is the beginning of a chain reaction that leads to proper university and success in life. If life were only that formulaic...",1248134400,7,648,4.954128440366972
3742716,5,B001P8M9FU,"This film is incredibly entertaining! I was it at a screening last night and was blown away, as was the entire audience. The film really takes the viewer through an intense emotional ride that is very rewarding and interesting. It works very well as a date movie but just as well as a movie for families and friends to enjoy whether or not they have children. It has true universal appeal. I highly recommend it, but go see it soon some of the shows are selling out!!

Also, this film should be REQUIRED VIEWING FOR ALL NEW PARENTS as the film works as a great educational tool as well!",1240790400,3,586,4.376146788990826
3742727,5,B001P8M9FU,This was amazing to see how much they would spend and to what lengths people would go to just to get their child into pre-K!! This was a great documentary on reasons NOT to live in New York!!,1394150400,,191,4.052631578947368
3742728,1,B001P8M9FU,"It was very challenging to even download and get amazon film to work and stream to TV.  When we finally got the film to work, it was mediocre.  We only found one storyline remotely compelling, the others were too disjunct and it was overall poorly produced.",1381708800,,257,4.565217391304348
3742729,5,B001P8M9FU,I love documentaries and this one was wonderfully done and entertaining. I highly recommend it and it is informative as well.,1379808000,,125,5.0
3742730,5,B001P8M9FU,The parents probably thought it was serious but the producers knew how to make the movie funny and entertaining.  I had to laugh at what parents go through and the response of the nursery schools regarding the way parents act.  The parents seemed like crazy lunatics just so their kids can play with playdough and sing nursery rhymes all day.  This also shows how the rich have money to burn on the unnecessary.,1368921600,,411,4.602739726027397
3742731,5,B001P8M9FU,"I was absolutely amazed at what these parents had to maneuver just to get their kids into a 'good' preschool program.  What these parents have to go through borders on the insanely absurd. Having said that, I liked that  the documentary followed a very diverse group of parents and children. From the higher end two income parents who can afford the best to the lower end working class parents who have to find scholarships in order to obtain the best. Two parent households, single parent households and a range of very young parents to the more mature parents in their 40's and 50's. I also liked that the preschoolers were at different levels of development and maturity, some obviously very gifted to others who were very much 'normal' and then those who seemed to possibly have learning disorders. I enjoyed this documentary very much.",1367712000,4,840,4.826388888888889
3742732,3,B001P8M9FU,Didn't really like any of the parents and there was no exposure to the children (aside from the parent's fawning over them).  None of them seemed genuine at all.,1365984000,2,161,4.551724137931035
3742733,5,B001P8M9FU,"A must see and eye opener for parents living in NYC, Chicago, etc.  They will not believe what it takes to get their newborn into nursery school.",1360454400,,145,4.37037037037037
3742734,4,B001P8M9FU,"I wholly diagree with the reviewers who were digusted with the parents. I felt that most of the parents cared very much for their children! I saw the parents interacting with their children positively such as playing with them, teaching them numbers and how to spell their names. I feel that the pressure was put upon themselves, and never for the children to behave a certain way. And whoever thinks it's dumb to pay that much money for a school has obviously lost sight of porportion. $20k to them may be a $200 to you. I think it's silly to spend $100 for a new video game or up to $200 for the coolest new shoes for school, but lots of people do it. If they have it, they should spend what they like, it's not coming from you!

As for the movie, I like that they used a broad spectrum of people: the rich snobs you imagine, the more down to earth rich people, the poorer minority, the bohemians and the single mom with special ed requirements. I wish they went more in depth with the real reason these families go through this process. I suspect for the wealthy families, it not just about education, but more aboout networking. Your kids will grow up next to kids of the other social circles you wish to interact with. Isn't that what Ivy League is for? Plenty of schools are excellent and will produce adults with great careers. Ivy League has a network that opens into (or maintains) a certain social circle that education by itself can't get you. And networks do help in life! I'd say it's most important. Most people I know got their job by knowing someone who knew someone. For the immigrants, I'd like to see more of what kind of education was a good education to them. What is their acceptable standards? For the single mom, I want to know if she felt guilty for having a child that was slightly developmentally impaired?

The movie was a clean and bright view of world many of us don't get to see, which was a documentary should be.",1351123200,7,1945,4.4
3742735,4,B001P8M9FU,"This documentary helped me understand the process and stress parents go through to find a good nursery.

3742736,5,B001P8M9FU,"I found this DVD to be very fascinating. It documents the crazy process of getting children into preschools in New York City. It follows several families of different backgrounds and income levels as they choose which schools they would like their preschoolers to go to. It shows the entire process, from trying to even get an application to fill out and going on interviews, to finding out if their children were accepted or not. They also show some of the schools' point of view on how they decide who will and will not get accepted. Although it is a little ridiculous at times what the parents will do to get their children accepted, it is oddly entertaining.",1346371200,3,662,4.666666666666667
