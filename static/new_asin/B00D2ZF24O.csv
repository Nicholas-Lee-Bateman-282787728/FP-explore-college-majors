5769889,1,B00D2ZF24O,"The once highly acclaimed director, M. Night Shyamalan appears to have lost his mojo.  Of course, that's not a complete knock on the overall quality of his work or his imagination, but his recent films have been unmistakably disappointing.  After all, we are talking about the man that wrote the famous line, ""I see dead people"" for the highly acclaimed and much loved film, The Sixth Sense.  Since The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has been on a downward trend, but it did plateau for a few years with the release of Unbreakable, followed by the Signs.  However, Signs was nearly ten years ago, and the films he has directed in that decade long period since have been less than impressive, with a few of them bordering on downright terrible.  And, the sad fact is - he has to take the brunt of the criticism (even if they are box office success stories) for these films since he is the one that writes, directs, and produces the majority of them.  In any event, it would appear M. Night Shyamalan is due for a spellbinding recovery.  Did he achieve it with After Earth?

After Earth takes place in the year 3000, long after humans decided to abandon the planet due to a series of cataclysmic events and repopulate across the galaxy.  On the established world of Nova Prime, Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) is desperately trying to join the Ranger Corps to satisfy his father, Cypher Raige (Will Smith) - the strict general of the Ranger Corps.  Cypher believes his son is lacking discipline and decides to take him on his last adventure before retirement to spend some extra time with his son.  However,  their starship is damaged in an asteroid field, and they are forced to crash land on the Earth - a planet deemed to be chaotic and dangerous.  In the crash, the ship is separated into two halves, one of which contains an emergency distress beacon.  Cypher is badly hurt and it's unable to travel, so it's up to Kitai to travel alone across a dangerous Earth jungle to retrieve the beacon.  Sophie Okonedo and Zo Kravitz also star in supporting roles.

You'd think a sci-fi story featuring one of the biggest names in Hollywood (Will Smith) would be an unbelievably great idea, right?  In this case, you'd be wrong.  Not only would you be wrong, you'd be dead wrong.  The fact is some ideas are best left in the think tank - the perfect example being the decision to cast Jaden Smith in a role that clearly required a much more seasoned actor to play the lead role.  Jaden Smith may one day become a tremendous actor, but he's not even close yet - and although he does show brief moments of exuberance, he's far too dull and uninteresting in this film.  He's derived of authentic emotion, and without that, this film's main character feels like he's just going through the motions.  It's difficult to pounce on such a young actor, but After Earth disappoints mightily due to the inexperience of Jaden Smith.

Independence Day is still one of the most entertaining summer blockbusters out there to watch, not to mention the original Men in Black was pretty good, too.  However, the past doesn't always repeat itself in terms of success.  With that being said, Will Smith missed the mark this time around, but it wasn't due to a complete lack of effort.  Your star player will - more often than not - provide your offense, but when your star played is trapped inside a cockpit for the entirety of the film, it's probably not going to lead to a victory.  Forgive the sports metaphor, but Will Smith was not properly utilized in this film.  Yes, his character was injured for the film and was meant to be trapped, but that doesn't change the fact that he's really nothing more than a name in the credits or a simple advertising draw for this film.

After Earth starts off at an utterly slow pace.  For about the first 20 minutes or so, the lack of a relationship between Cypher and Kitai is quickly established.  There's a great deal of tension in the air whenever these two are together, much of which stems from the death of Kitai's older sister, Senshi (Zo Kravitz), during an alien attack.  Next thing you know, they're both on a spaceship and there's a random asteroid field that severely damages the ship.  From there, After Earth is nothing more than a series of forced entertainment that is mostly uneventful.  Naturally, there has to be a protagonist in this film, and that comes in the form of some random over-sized creature that they just happened to have on-board the ship when it crashed.

Overall, After Earth is too slow and uninteresting to sustain attention.  It features a slow developing plot that is too choppy and sporadic.  From the very beginning, the film feels like a watered down version of Aliens meets Predators.  The Smith father/son dynamic is heartwarming at first, but fails to meet the one simple criterion for a sci-fi thriller: provide interesting characters and excitement.  After Earth is not the worst movie, but it's nothing anyone should go out of their way to witness.  Feel free to skip this film without any hesitation.

5769890,3,B00D2ZF24O,"although the movie was pretty good it falls short of my expectations, as did Oblivion, however I though Oblivion was slightly better.
It's a new type of movie where they are keeping budgets smaller with fewer actors involved and more pure CGI animation.  With Smith in the movie and a total cost of $130 million to make it most of the budget with to the programers no doubt.

The movie was for the most part very predictable and the CGI imagery was very good.  Appeared that much of it was shot in the redwoods on the coast of california in the smith river area, very beautiful area.

At the end it said story by Will Smith, it was a good movie as i said but just not what I was expecting.  This is smart money I would say for huge movies but screen plays are limited and harder to evolve with the lack of actors.

As with the movie ""Buried"" with Ryan Reynolds, it's does a great job with what he had to work with but left many viewers expecting more, you will find the same with this movie.

I somehow feel that big budget movies are evolving to this type of movie, not many actors and TONS of CGI.  Make the programers cut each others throats to compete.

worth a watch though",1369958400,9,1178,4.246636771300448
5769891,1,B00D2ZF24O,"I went into this movie halfway expecting it to be yet another great and stunningly visual sci-fi flick in a long line of 2013 scifi releases that have amazed me.  From the previews and the hype I thought this would blow me away being a huge fan of science fiction.

Unfortunately I was blown away in ways that are not so good.

First, Will Smith should have been the lead actor.  No offense to Jaden but he is most definitely NOT a believable actor (in this film anyway), and the shoes he had to fill for this role were way too large, and he failed miserably at it.  Not saying his father did a very good job either, in fact Will's acting wasn't all that great, so maybe it wasn't acting but rather script writing.

I am thinking M. Night Shyamalan has created another disappointment, and has sadly taken the Smith's down his road of horrid movie making.  In a way I'm fairly embarrassed for both Will and Jaden for even being a part of this film, regardless it will look pretty bad on Jaden's resume on future endeavors.

But enough about the acting, the visual effects weren't even that great.  To me the movie seemed to have been filmed with the CG effects of 10 years ago rather than the technology that has stunned us with the likes of Avatar, Prometheus, Oblivion, and I hate to say it but HBO's Game of Thrones has more realistic graphics than this sad excuse for a sci-fi movie.

Unfortunately M. Night Shyamalan has created not another addition to sci-fi blockbuster movies this year, instead he has only added another reminder as to why I should pay better attention to who the producers and directors are of a film, because I will most definitely never ever again waste my money on a M. Night Shyamalan film ever.

Hopefully you enjoy this movie more than I, but if your reading this I would highly suggest you wait to rent it, instead of spending money at a theater.",1369958400,8,1878,4.446064139941691
5769892,2,B00D2ZF24O,I'm not sure why anyone would give this five stars but that's what I noticed when I decided to review this myself. I was never impressed with Jaden's other attempts at acting and this has not made me feel any better about that. He had too big a part in a movie that should have been taken control of by Will Smith. Lots of special affects but that will only get you so far. I'll probably never buy it on Blu Ray or any other way. Sorry.,1369872000,5,436,4.022988505747127
5769893,5,B00D2ZF24O,Loved it. Love the whole narrative. The science fiction elements were Innovative and interesting and different. It was nice to see things made from the natural world and also what Earth could become without us. I also love the concept of not being able to be seen except through your fear. As a species I feel like we are ruled by fear most of the time and our judgment is inadequate at best during those times. It's nice to see a writer and solid acting behind creating the world or it's possible not to be ruled by fear.,1521676800,,522,4.336734693877551
5769894,3,B00D2ZF24O,"This is as good as many other sci fi films, although not the best, of course. Will Smith's kid is not a bad actor, I think he is convincing in the part, takes after the old man. The old man, though, is pretty stiff in this film. Of course he's playing a military character with a stick up his ass, and a reputation for feeling no fear, so I suppose that's what the part calls for.

Mostly it's the story that is boring, not the acting. The special effects are cool, and I always like sci fi whiz bangs, I think the camera work is good. But the plot is pretty standard stuff, and the writers have brought nothing new or interesting to it. So, usual old themes: coming of age, measuring up to a demanding parent's expectations, combined with hero all on his own fighting an entire world that is out to get him.

I don't know whether I'll watch it a second time, but it was worth watching once.",1520553600,,891,4.204678362573099

5769903,5,B00D2ZF24O,"I just watched it again for this review.  It is the post apocalyptic story of a young Indian boy who has to kill the bear to become a Brave.  You know he is going to do it...you just don't figure out when and how.  It was great acting by both Will Smith and son Jaden Smith and also the typical great direction of M. Night Shyamalan.  It is almost, if you are a fan of Will Smith which I am...and M. Night Shyamalan...a real WIN-WIN.  Then to add the winning performance of young Jaden Smith...what more can you ask.  The story is great and it is a real showcase for Jaden with all the great trappings.  I really don't care what the ""professionals"" thought...I THOUGHT it was a really great movie.  If you don't see it, well, your loss.  There is basically no such thing as a story that has never been told in one venue or another and as I said it is a retelling of the boy who had to earn the title of ""Brave"".  I loved it.",1511913600,,924,4.083333333333333
5769904,4,B00D2ZF24O,The movie wasn't bad. The story line was great. There were a couple of parts where I felt like the acting was a bit off but for the most part the movie was a good one.,1510444800,,167,3.6666666666666665
5769905,1,B00D2ZF24O,"A reimagining of 'Land of the Lost', but not satirical, overlaid with a Lion-King-style coming-of-age story that will warm the hearts of all eight-year-old boys.  Beyond that demographic, most will instantly spot the cinematographic ripoffs from Minority Report, Planet of the Apes, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Starship Troopers, Predator, Alien, and even King Kong. The acting is wooden, and the young hero's performance makes one long for the subtleties of the Hayden Christensen ""I killed them all..."" soliloquy from the teenage Darth Vader files. Cheap set design -- the spaceship and volcano cave interiors look like cardboard packaging material and the landscapes are cheesy matte paintings -- combines with clunky, formulaic dialogue and the strange structure (of us watching a film of Will Smith watching a film of his son) and ridiculous premises (angry monkey chases? An animatronic eagle adopting the son?  Trees and grass and animals that freeze every night yet somehow still live? Volcanoes that clarify the ionosphere so that radio transmissions can pass?)  to give this entire film a Flash Gordon feel, but without the entertainment value.  It is clear that although the Smith nepotism machine was rich enough to underwrite an underachieving, nearly direct-to-DVD movie, it was not nearly rich enough to produce a film anyone would want to see a second time. Which leaves us with two mysteries: Just how did M. Knight Shyamalan get mixed up in this hot mess, and just what the heck do we do with these DVDs?  The movie is not the sort of thing you can regift to the amusement of all, like, say, holiday fruitcake or that classic VHS of Time Bandits.....",1509926400,3,1665,5.04

5769910,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I like this movie because of the story it tells. I would have given it five stars but for the fact that there is no explanation as to how the Ursas were getting to the planet, especially if they're blind, so who are the aliens? Other than that, I was able to follow along with the plot and storyline. Granted, it took me watching the movie a couple times, but I finally got the premise of the movie.

His son was already in a lead role with Jackie Chan, so it wasn't like he never acted before. As regards to the movie, I love science fiction and this one was fun to watch,isn't that the point, fun.

5769916,5,B00D2ZF24O,"Great science fiction for science fiction fans.  Will Smith gets top billing, but the real star of the movie is his son, Jaden; an excellent performance.  I loved the film's depiction of space travel and space ship construction, and there is a lot of great visuals that real sci-fi fans will appreciate.

Some narrow-minded people made fun of this movie because of the character's style of speech and accents, but I enjoyed that facet of the film and thought it brought more realism.  I feel that criticism is based on a contemporary and provincial frame of reference, rather than considering what society might actually be like in a 1000 years. Similarly minded people from even a 100 years ago would very likely snicker at the way we talk today.",1499990400,,747,4.767441860465116

Nobody else could have played Agent K in the Men in Black movies. This movie was the turning point, though, and not in a good way. With this movie, he's become the next Adam Sandler, and I predict that we will begin seeing him in even worse movies that go straight to DVD or BluRay and wind up on sale for $1.99 at Walmart in the big tub of unwanted movies. In conclusion, don't watch this. Remember Will Smith as the great actor that he once was.",1498262400,,611,4.186440677966102

This was no different. This movie is about a boy becoming a man and it was set in a futuristic time period. Jaden Smith played the role to perfection and Will Smith's supporting role was terrific. This is one that I will watch again and again, each time picking up new bits. This is the type of film I look for because each time you watch it, more detail is seen. The interaction between the boy and the eagle is nuanced but very relative to the story as it portrays the inherent need for mothers to nurture the young. If you just want to see a shoot-em up and explosions, this is not the film for you. However if you want a deeply emotional story set in a sci-fi setting full of interesting ideas of what a future existence might be like, then you will enjoy it as much as I did.",1493424000,3,941,4.119565217391305

The design sensibilities for Nova Prime are especially inspired even though they are a tad inconsistent at times. It's ultimately a linear B grade film with an A grade budget.

The boy does a pretty good job of portraying a spoiled brat, so good in fact, he convinces that he could be one himself.

TITLE: After Earth (2013)  PG-13  1:40:03
  Jaden Smith, Will Smith, Sophie Okonedo, Zo Kravitz
  M. Night Shyamalan (Director)

  This movie is probably NOT as bad as you have heard  but, on the other hand, it's just NOT that good either. It is, unfortunately, a vivid example of what happens when a very good plot idea is poorly executed because of VERY bad acting (Jaden Smith), a poorly written screenplay (Gary Whitta and M. Night Shyamalan) and mediocre direction (M. Night Shyamalan). However, in spite of this, and its MANY other shortcomings, this movie does LOOK and SOUND great.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO: 2.39:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (24.9 Mbps)

  Overall, the images in this movie are sharp, with very good shadow detail; and, they possess a muted color-palette that works very well with the tone of the source material. Fine detail is evident in many of the close-ups of faces and machines  without any apparent edge-enhancement. Also, there are no specks, white dots, color fluctuations, or banding to mar the image. Nor, are there any of the wax-like featureless faces that usually denote excessive dynamic noise reduction (DNR). Though the movie itself isn't very good, its picture quality is first-rate.

AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (48kHz, 16-bit)

  If this soundtrack was a 7.1 mix I would rate it a 5+ for sound quality without hesitation; as it is, it is still one of the BEST soundtracks that you will ever hear on a home theater system regardless of the number of channels. It features very deep bass, very active and highly directional surround channels, clear well-placed dialog, ambient sounds that effectively convey the location of the on-screen setting, and well recorded music. It is tragic that such a great soundtrack is wasted on such a mediocre movie.

This is the movie which killed my favorite actor. - By the way, Will Smith still had a chance to recover his fan faith and show up in Independence Day Resurgence, but he says he's tired of sequels and it would cost them $50 million to show his face in the movie.

Jaden did fine, but I expect little from a child, and his role was not too difficult. Besides, they get unlimited takes. The human-free Earth was fun to watch and see animal slight evolution, but the flora was unchanged. It is only a thousand years, so believable for that. With no pollution and all the plants, I was surprised there wasn't enough oxygen but that was just part of the story. The monster was not needed, but it saved a lot on CGI to not have other predatory beasts. Watch it once for the story, twice for details and third time for studying the CGI and special features/effects. Then list it on Amazon for $1.00.",1460073600,,787,4.43448275862069

5770038,1,B00D2ZF24O,Why only release the digital copy to one provider?  If i want to watch on my apple TV I need the apple copy and the VUDU app sucks for downloading to my ipad.  I hate these studios not releasing the digital copy to all providers Why not be like disney movies anywhere?  If I am shelling out 15-25 a movie when everyone else is stealing them digitally I should be rewarded for it.

5770051,3,B00D2ZF24O,"I felt like this movie was a bit of a let down and that I was not given the true story from the trailer. Will Smith is in this movie but really as more of a side character. This film was obviously intended to be a vehicle for Jaden Smith. Not to say I have any issues with Jaden Smith I just don't think he has the ability to carry a movie of this nature. The basic plot is that Will and Jaden are father and son, as they are in real life, and after crashing on future Earth Jaden must go on an adventure to retrieve a fallen piece of their ship so they can send a distress call. Will Smith's character is incapacitated so he has to stay with the part of the ship they crashed in. This was a fun adventure for my children, what child doesn't dream of being an adventure on his own? But there are a lot of faulty plot lines and oversimplifications for this to be an enjoyable Sci-fi flick. The up side of the movie for myself was that Will Smith was very good in his role as the distant father who holds his son at arms length, just not a role we usually see form Smith, he was very good at cold and authoritative. I could have used more form him.",1456963200,2,1146,3.9869565217391303

Shamilyan should find another line of work, filmmaking sure in hell isn't working out. Jaden Smith can't act in any way shape or form, any 15yr old Micky D workers would have been better at pulling the role off. He needs to clean pools or somthing, poor acting combined with poor character amped up with a bad attitude in real life. 3 Will Smith, Jada, what the hell? You two are the typical hollywood power couple, take care of your kids don't just indulge their spoiled whims.
The movie: bad writing,  bad ideas, bad direction, subpar acting ( will smith really souldn't have cast himself) so so effects.
All this is what I got from wasting my time watching the DVD and all the extras.

But no, it hasn't. while the script was stupid I figured the acting would pull it out of the dump. I was wrong again. His son needs to concentrate on a  career  Out of Hollywood like a doctor, or lawyer, or even a bussiness man because his acting skills are terrible and at this age it doesn't look like they are going to get better. If you don't have it by now, then you just aren't cut out for acting. It amazes me why actors kids think that if dad, or mom is good, then I'll be good also. It just don't work that way. Especially when they run around with a big head and nose in the air like a few have. Oh well, enough about it. Of course these are just my personal opinions. Yours may differ.",1451692800,3,836,4.0

The consequences of establishing trust and how having your father in your life is one of the key elements to eliminating fear. and oh year I forgot, the story is incredibly original and well acted out by Will and Jaden. I have been advocating for years how absentee fatherhood adversely impacts black males and I'm sure all males for that matter, and this movie just almost brought me to tears when will told his son what fear really is. I think it is one of the most powerful scenes in cinema history. Thanks to all who were involved in the making of this movie.

One of the main messages in the movie was very powerful and applicable to our lives as we have a lot of disabilities and have to face frightening events frequently.  I am mystified by the negative reactions that this movie invoked in so many people.  I thought that Jaden Smith did an incredible job portraying his character - especially since he is such a young actor who has yet to grow into his own.  Well done and worth the cost to purchase.  One caveat though: I wouldn't allow a small child to watch as there a few frightening scenes that may be disturbing to them.,1441238400,,842,4.586666666666667

After Earth is precisely the sort of poorly written, ill-conceived, and abysmally executed movie that once led to there being a stigma associated with science fiction as a genre. Thankfully that stigma seems to have diminished over time, but that fact certainly should not encourage filmmakers to create this sort of garbage.
It is just truly awful. I can watch Battlefield Earth for fun, because it is bad in such a way as to make it at least entertaining. This lacks even that modicum of redemption.",1437868800,7,717,4.523076923076923

5770173,1,B00D2ZF24O,"I'm glad I didn't know this was Shyamalan, or I would have gone into it with a negative bias.  As it is, my negative feelings started to kick in very soon.  In short, this film is very poorly made.  Jaden Smith's acting was wooden and unconvincing, Will Smith's role kept him from doing anything interesting at all, and the film is so full of holes that it was almost infuriating.  What was the most aggravating to me were the problems with continuity and time.  On Jaden's second or third day out, all he does is build a raft and fall asleep on it, and boom--the whole day is over.  He's also supposed to breathe in the stuff in the vials every 24 hours, yet he's on to his second vial before the end of the first day, just hours after he takes the first on.  How he finds the tail section after losing contact with his father is unbelievable, and there are so many other silly things in this movie that already have been pointed out by others that I'll pass on going into detail.

What I dislike about Shyamalan as a writer/director is that he always seems to rely on that one moment at the end of the film to carry the whole thing.  It's a ridiculous way to tell a story--figure out a cool ending and then build a film to reach it.  In ""The Village,"" it was the moment they climbed the fence.  In ""The Sixth Sense,"" it was the ring.  He doesn't tell a story and develop characters and then write the ending based upon the story--he starts with an ending and then works his way to it.  Unfortunately, he doesn't do it well, and the lead-up is so weak that the ending becomes a ""saw that coming"" moment.  Perhaps he'd be a better director if he let a real writer take over the story.",1436659200,2,1684,4.238244514106583

This premise allows for some really cool elements in the movie. You have overcoming fears and mental mastery, sword fighting, people acting all special and mystical, etc.

So just like characters in the movie need to be able to turn off their fear, viewers of the movie need to be able to turn off their common sense.

5770248,3,B00D2ZF24O,"This movie had so-so reviews, and I would agree with them. I had to give it a shot just because of my love for the Sci-Fi genre, and I don't regret watching it, but I'm glad it was just an Amazon Instant rental rather than a movie I purchased; I highly doubt I would ever have watched it again.

*** SPOILER ALERT ***

1) Jaden Smith was more than a little difficult to understand at times. This movie was clearly made as a vehicle to try to propel him into some level of stardom, but frankly his speaking needs to be a bit more clear so the audience isn't rewinding or turning on subtitles just to figure out what is being said.
2) There were quite a few things about the crash that were more than a little unbelievable. Somehow, the computers can somehow survive an insane crash impact (along with father and son) when everything else is almost entirely obliterated and all other hands killed, AND somehow the broken half of the ship where father and son awake is still capable of remaining air-tight and in possession of sufficient air supply to keep Will's character breathing comfortably throughout the movie.
3) With all this amazing cool futuristic technology, how is it that we have no guns? And that somehow a simple, BLIND beast is such a formidable and almost entirely unbeatable weapon that humankind nearly fails to defeat prior to the concept of ""ghosting""??? Why, why, why is our only means of defense to use some silly futuristic HAND-TO-HAND MELEE COMBAT WEAPON?!?!
4) While I could almost believe the pheromone B.S. story from Will's character's story to his son, since he figured out how to calm his fears BEFORE getting out of the water, which might have allowed the water to wash the pheromones from his skin as he exited the water, Jaden's character's experience was ludicrous. He was already OUT of the water when he has his epiphany on how to separate himself from the fear. He already had exhibited clear visibility (i.e. fear pheromone presence) by being attacked by the beast. Just because he suddenly decides to be not afraid, doesn't mean the chemical pheromones would suddenly and instantly evaporate from his skin and render him invisible. The writers could have done a better job of handling this final showdown and made it so the son faced his fear and came out fearless BEFORE exiting the water, or somehow got washed off again after, before being rendered invisible.
5) When being chased by the evil apes, the filmmakers went a bit TOO far in trying to add to the sense of danger; it was more than clear that the apes should have easily overtaken Jaden's character LONG before he reached the water, given their speed and proximity to Jaden's character throughout the chase scenes.

One has to expect a bit more critical view from audiences when the movie is of the science fiction genre, especially when it is presented with the kind of style and setting as this one. This movie fell simply didn't rise to the levels one would have hoped given the assumptions drawn from the hype and previews that preceded its release.",1427328000,6,3054,4.672862453531598

Jaden is an awesome actor, Wll Smith can do no wrong, related to the choices he makes, this film was right on.  My son is a military kid and I could see, he and his dad having this same dynamic.

5770254,2,B00D2ZF24O,"I give MNS some room to maneuver given 6th Sense was hugely popular, all people talked about & spawned several similar movies.  When he more or less began w/that level of success there's only one direction to go.  I enjoyed ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"", ""Lady in the Water"" & ""The Happening"".

The beauty of fantasy/Sci-Fi is there are no rules as long as you have a plausible screen play that the audience can identify with.  What I liked about MNS movies generally is they are suspense create w/dialogue, music, typically few props & only a few actors.  Sort of old school movie making.

He's certainly had some dogs & thats to be expected.

Re: Jaden Smith, he'll get his chops eventually.  At the same age Will was not, nor was he being cast as lead in such films @ this age.  If blame is to be cast & I'm not convinced it must, perhaps it should be @ Jaden Smith's parents using all their resources to get him roles as any parent would/should do for their kid in similar circumstances.

It wasn't a great movie, people were disappointed it had much less Will & much more Jaden Smith.  While confusing why humans couldn't return to earth, the archaic mode of battling the lethal yet fatally flawed monsters...  What of the aliens who chose to fight humanity by releasing blind monsters to kill us.

Despite all the negatives I think MNS will make good films so long as provided proper funding.  Jaden will likely mature into a fine actor.",1426809600,,1436,4.55859375

The premiss is okay, tries a bit too hard, and could really have used a re-work. I'm surprised that Will Smith took it on.

5770352,4,B00D2ZF24O,"""After Earth"" is set far in the future, after planet Earth has become unlivable. While transporting a dangerous alien, a father and son are forced to crash land on Earth (now teaming with deadly animals.) The dangerous alien escapes, and the father/son duo only have a limited amount of time to call for help. The movie primarily follows the son (Jaden Smith) as he overcomes his greatest weakness, but it also develops the father's character as he is forced to place all of his faith and hopes in his somewhat misfit son.

I feel that this movie is really enjoyable. What I've always loved about Shyamalan's work is how he makes you afraid to be afraid. The dangerous alien senses the adrenaline rush that comes with fear; therefore, being fearless makes you invisible. Being scared makes you a target. The constant tension of trying to not be afraid in the face of danger was a pretty cool device.

I also liked the father/son dynamic. Will Smith isn't demeaning or cruel, but he clearly knows that his son isn't 100% up to most of the challenges they have to face. Jaden Smith plays a young man who isn't rebellious or obnoxious, but also not fully mature or experienced. He avoids being an annoying teen while still being a sympathetic youth.

The drawbacks: It feels a bit formulaic, and therefore somewhat predictable. The ""coming of age"" aspect of the story is obvious, which takes away from the overall quality of the film. Also, there were a few scenes that seemed to solely show off effects and graphics. Impressive, but they interrupted the flow of the story.

Overall, an effective story with interesting characters, but just a little over-simplified. Still very enjoyable though!",1418601600,,1692,4.824137931034483

Perhaps this has to do with the ideas of Scientology being behind this movie. I accidentally started watching After Earth, and before even realizing what it was, with the begining prolouge, I thought ""This must be some kind of low budget thing from Australia (or whatever that accent was)""

The characters are treated as if they are noble, tragic heroes, when we have no reason to accept this on any rational or emotional level. What, is this supposed to be a lesson in having no normal human emotions???? Because if so, why are they all so sad and pompus??? Every little move is taken so seriously.

Many of these scenes are just so laughable......geeze.....

Went with my then 13-year old son and had a classic father-son-afternoon-matinee-grab-a-ten-dollar-popcorn-don't-expect-too-much-out-of-the-movie time. To me, it was a coming of age movie for both main characters. Will Smith's character struggling to express emotions to his son, because, well, emotions = weakness/death in his work world. The son struggling to overcome his past experiences, and his fears -- and overcoming them in the end... I have always enjoyed Shyamalan's story telling style, although I may be in the minority on that one. His movies are unique, and usually have a decent moral. ""Lady in the Water"" had a wonderful moral, so did ""Signs"", and the way Shyamalan uses visuals, and messes with pacing (especially in ""Signs"" which I just enjoyed with my teenagers) is fun to behold.  ""After Earth"" doesn't reach the level of ""Signs"" in my mind, but if you go in to ""After Earth"" -- letting the story-teller take you ""there"" in his own way, it's not a bad ride at all. And at least my son and I weren't bombarded by things not appropriate for a 13-year old to see. It was a good afternoon.",1415232000,,1158,4.938461538461539

5770469,4,B00D2ZF24O,"After Earth is actually a pretty awesome science fiction/suspense.  Despite the poor reception by movie fans, After Earth delivers in several key areas.  It's enticing, it's filled with a surprising amount of drama from Will Smith and his real-life son Jaden who plays his son in this role as well, and the actual threatening situations concerning otherworldly birds, monkeys, leeches, cougars and other types of animals is breathtakingly beautiful.  The only serious problem is that the movie takes a long time to actually get going (at least 25 minutes of uninteresting slow-moving story development) and overall the movie is way too short at just over 90 minutes.

Basically the story is that Will Smith is a military commander and his son is a commander in training who's not quite ready for the job, but when a situation turns for the worse and Will and Jaden are left stranded in the middle of a different planet, Will is hurt enough that he can't leave the area so his son has to go out and fend for himself retrieving key items until safety arrives.  However Will Smith has the ability to see his sons every movement and even communicate with him through a radio, so if Jaden is ever in a tricky predicament Will is there to help him out and guide him to safety.

For the most part the scenery is absolutely beautiful while Jaden dodges and fights all kinds of animals and even dodges the dreaded below freezing frost rapidly approaching in one AMAZING scene, but one thing that sort of annoyed me is that the film is silent for the most part.  I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear the characters speak.  I find the final showdown with the demonic volcano monster somewhat hilarious.  Why would the monster initially put up such a fight just to break through the rocks and get to Jaden, only to sit around and wait while Jaden builds the strength to continue the fight?  It's WAY too dramatic and hokey not to mention completely unnecessary.  This segment also fails since you know who's going to win the fight.

I'm surprised how much compassion occurs throughout the film.  Most fantasy/science fiction type adventure films don't have *this* much drama.  But since Will Smith has established himself as an amazing actor capable of starring in all kinds of roles, he does a fantastic job playing the strict commander father always motivating his son to continue forward even when the situation seems hopeless.

Overall I highly recommend After Earth... but why did the baby birds have to die?  You know which scene I'm referring to.  The one where the boy wakes up and he's surrounded by baby birds pecking at his face.  They were so adorable!",1406505600,2,2663,4.702586206896552
5770470,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I won't say this was the best movie ever, but I do think it is underrated.  Maybe it's just that I was really in the mood for sci-fi, but I found myself enjoying it throughout.  I kept waiting for it to become as awful as so many have claimed it was, but that never happened.  There isn't a great deal of action, nor much humor.  It is a sci-fi survival drama.

the spaceships are interesting, as well as the gadgets, and the why the Earth was
destroyed and by what is imaginative.

But still, it is a boring movie, with a plain sequence of events and a predictable ending.
The Will Smith family acting does nothing to improve the general mediocrity of the film.

5770510,3,B00D2ZF24O,"1,000 years in the future, Earth becomes uninhabitable for humanity after some malignant blind but fear-smelling aliens invade. In the process, it also gets overrun with rabid baboons, mutated big cats, gargantuan condors, and various other horrible creatures. What's left of the human race is saved by the Rangers, including the legendarily fearless General Cypher (Will Smith), transporting them to the stars. However, during a routine father-son bonding expedition Cypher and his cadet son, Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith), who failed the fear test as a young boy during the alien invasion and has just been denied promotion to Ranger, find themselves crash-landed on Earth once again. . .

AFTER EARTH is a watchable science fiction thriller with some good special effects and decent acting. The storyline is solid but fairly predictable. Though you can see some obvious influences, it's not as derivative as many contemporary sf films. A lot of ho-hum sci-fi thriller technology: Ships that can travel between stars in a matter of hours but are completely vulnerable to Sol's Asteroid Belt, etc. I guess the aliens confiscated all the guns because the Rangers fight them with swords, and big boys apparently don't wear bubbles even when their lives depend on them.

I have no regrets about sitting through AFTER EARTH and more or less enjoyed it, but when the credits rolled, I was left thinking, ""There's a lot more they could have done with this.""",1401753600,,1448,5.105485232067511

Monster could have been better, but it got the job done. Will Smith has even more potential as an actor. He went beyond any stereotypes that may have limited him in the past. Jaden Smith is good, young actor. It makes lots of sense for opportunities to be given to him by his family connections. it isn't the first time families have supported a member, and the selection of scripts appears to be carefully monitored by his father to avoid a crash-and-burn choice. Great father/son exploration, good tech-imagination. Director M. Night S., has always been brave about exploring aspects that some might find uncomfortable, but always delivers and challenges.

This was a movie with some powerful messages & a whole lot of negative nincompoops who wrote reviews here just didn't get it!,1401408000,3,441,4.25

5770516,4,B00D2ZF24O,"After a deluge of bad reviews I guess I didn't expect much.  That said this isn't a sci fi master piece (actually can't think of many anyways) but its a decent semi sci fi adventure film with brilliant graphics .  There are the usual escaping just within a hair moments but those are so commonplace its silly to just single out this film.  Acting by jaden Smith was solid.  Will Smith was mechanical but didn't have much to work with in the role of the cold but caring father.

Definitely in the same class as Elysium, the second series of Star Wars Films and even on par with the over rated Avatar.  Maybe not as good as Gravity or 2001: A space odyssey but for an adventure sci fi movie not bad.",1400889600,,697,4.242424242424242

Papa Smith, whose work I enjoy, is rather off-putting here as the emotionally disconnected on-screen Dad, but the kid has so much more screen time that his work alone pulls this out of the fire. I classify this as one of those movies you see previewed, and know you'll like it ""when it comes to video."" Had I paid 18 bucks to see this in IMAX I'd have complained that I'd misspent my cash but, as predicted, streaming it for a couple of dollars made for an enjoyable movie evening, if not an exceptionally memorable one.",1400284800,2,667,4.475409836065574

5770527,1,B00D2ZF24O,When I first saw the trailer for After Earth I thought it could be a fun cheesy Sy Fi film. Boy was I wrong After Earth was one of the worst films of 2013 and one of Will Smiths worst films if not the worst. The Plot had a chance to be a really good one for example the plot could have told us in more detail why we left the Earth and how we knew there was another planet that could have everything a human needs to live. But no were just told that we left Earth because of some natural disasters. Another problem is the awful acting. Jaden Smith was expected to be terrible but Will just acted like he did not even care what was going on. Lastly are the lame special effects wich look so bad a 10 year old could have made them. But overall After Earth was awful it had something going for it with the cool trailers but that's it. On a scale from 1 to 5 I give After Earth a 1/5 mainly because of its trailer.

I've never seen it in my family so it's nice to see it in others.  It dragged a bit but still kept my attention and that can be a challenge in itself.  Overall it was a good movie.

Their is some cool CGI in this movie, but that's it.  Will Smith probably only did this movie because he wanted to make a movie with his son or needed a big tax write off.  *Spoiler*  The ONE thing I did like in this movie was how the bird or whatever you want to call it, killed itself to protect the kid because he helped it out earlier.

Honestly, we loved the whole film.
Plus, we really liked the main message:
""Fear is not real.  Fear only exists in our thoughts of the future.""

Aliens have attacked mankind with a monster with one limited sense of smell, it can smell human fear, but it can't see, or hear, or smell anything else evidently. Despite mankind having nanotech, advanced sensors, and faster than light drive, they are fighting these loser monsters with an advanced spear. One of the scenes in the movie has one of the monsters breaking into a home (I guess they forgot to lock the door) and killing Jaden's older sister who tries to fight it with a spear. All I can say is who was the idiot science advisor on this movie? Where are the automated Laser defenses? Where are the thousands of smart (monster hunting) missiles? Where is even one 19th century Elephant gun? How about a armored front door, or even a Ginsunating front door that turns uninvited monsters into delicious sushi? Evidently the Smiths wrote and produced the movie, when they should have stuck to what they know, namely acting. In conclusion this movie is so unbelievable on so many levels it insults anyone with even limited intelligence.

5770536,5,B00D2ZF24O,"This is a marvelous movie that is made good by the fact that Will Smith and his son star and the relationship between them in the film.  At the beginning Cypher acts like a commanding officer to his son, expects him to refer to him in the home as 'sir' at the end of every sentence and ask permission to leave the table, (which is not strictly a bad idea but can be taken too far).  His wife appeals to him that his son is drowning, adores and admires his father but doesn't know him.  So Cypher takes him with him on his last mission.  When the mission goes badly and Cypher must depend on his son to save the two of them he finds out how it feels to send your child out in the big bad dangerous world ands the one they are in is about as dangerous as you can imagine.  This little boy goes out on this dangerous mission armed with knowledge that would scare any adult into hiding under the bed, let alone a small boy.  But when the boy gets up against this danger Cypher realizes what it feels like to send a child out to do a mans mission.
I have watched it again and again because I can't get enough of the relationship of the two.  Also watch the Special Features on the dvd also and you'll get an idea what this boy had to go through to get ready for this part.

If they were advanced enough to leave Earth why did they not have any decent weapons for fighting aliens? Why hadn't they developed a spray or just used some Axe to hide their scents?

I have always felt m night shyamalan's movies are more about psychological than the physical. so many of the elements in the story actually point to something else like mans need to reconcile with nature than to fight/dominate it. if weak plot lines are an issue, how come in 'matrix revolutions' you have some kind of man machine with a man sitting in it fighting the swarm of flying machines? even a world war 2 concrete bunker with a machine gun would have been more effective. or the light saber in star wars? I can picture a death trooper shooting off luke skywalker's head with a laser gun at 100 meters before skywalker can even pull his laser sword out. but it is only a movie. maybe shyamalan could have come up with something cleverer - but my guess is that it was not that important to him as reinforcing the main plotline about controlling one's fear to win. and jaden has great screen presence and can act. highly entertaining  movie this.",1396051200,,1247,4.417391304347826

When the critics pan a movie, I can usually find enough redeeming qualities to make a movie worth my while, but not this one.  There are a few good moments in it, but not enough to justify this mess.

5770564,3,B00D2ZF24O,"After Earth doesn't deserve all the hate that has been thrown at it. On that same note the movie does a lot to make it unlikeable. The movie underutilized its star power, fails to provide proper exposition and follows a rather generic plot pattern that makes the movie very predictable. If you can get past all that what you will find is unique angle on an age old theme of a child's rite to manhood set in a fascinating universe.

The movie is about General Cypher Raige (Will Smith) and his son Kitai (Jaden Smith) surviving on a newly primal Earth after crash landing their spaceship. After Earth is set at first in a world colonized by the last of Earth's inhabitants a thousand years ago. Then on Earth after the crash. There is just a tiny bit of background data that talks about what happened to Earth and what's up with the new planet Nova Prime. This includes an invasion by a vicious alien race called the Ursa (which they happen to have a captured specimen on their ship). All of this little bit of details about what happened before are important because they set the important plot points for the survival story. Unfortunately the background information is too little and feels like an afterthought. This is a shame too, because in related merchandise to After Earth there seems to be a very full and rich background to explore. Yet... they didn't.

This is the start of the movie's woes. You can get around this limitation if you read up on the movie's setting online or in one of the books published, but if you don't like doing homework before a film I can see why you wouldn't be happy. Still lets move on. The story is actually pretty good if you know the background. Kitai (Jaden) wants to be a Ranger like dear old dad, but lacks the emotional maturity. Dad is too busy distancing himself with his work to help his son. All this changes with the crash, and Cypher is now seriously wounded and has to rely on his son to rescue the both of them.

From here the story hits some basic plot points of putting out obstacles to impede Kitai's progress, and all the while Cypher can only just sit on the sidelines. So the story details are standard, but I like the approach of making this movie a coming of age story for Kitai. He has to dig deep and learn what it takes to become a Ranger while surviving the wild. While I like this many Will Smith fans won't. Why? Because Will Smith is sitting on his butt the entire movie. On top of that Will's character is about as charismatic as a paper towel. Will is an action hero with a palpable level of charisma, and none of that was utilized. While he wasn't meant to be any of this on After Earth Will's fame precedes him, and his fans are rather single minded in what they want from him.

So hardly any back story and no Will Smith hogging the limelight. What's left? Like I said before the story is interesting in spite of being predictable. There is very little dialog in the film with lots of scenes based just on visceral experience. M. Night Shayamalan knows how to set a scene and this movie is no different. Whatever you have to say about what the movie lacks it sure looks and sounds beautiful. There are little experiences in the film that help flesh it out like Cypher's injuries and how he copes, Kitai's run in with various animals like baboons and giant birds. The interplay with flashbacks between the two characters and a traumatic experience that stunted both of them. It's all an intermingled web of details that bring life to an otherwise generic film.

Like many other sci-fi movies a lot can be taken from well though out technology, and this is where After Earth excels. All sorts of designs on this movie are really interesting and show an evolutionary side step in where technology branches off. You have ships with a more organic look to them. Weapons that perform in a way that harkens to magical. Survival gear that is both fascinating and carries the plot. From this standpoint the movie is very cool.

Acting is actually much better than many want to give credit for the film. I think the problem here is there isn't as much drama to draw from. Will Smith's character comes out as unemotional because that's the nature of his character, and it's seeing those telltale signs of his feelings coming through the exterior that make the emotional payoff. I think Jaden Smith does a very good job with his evolution from a flawed kid to one who pushes beyond his boundaries. It's all in the subtleties with this film.

After Earth was filmed and mastered in 4K and transferred to full 1080P on this Blu-Ray. To me it's a hard sell with these 4K masters for two reasons. One the master matters less than the bitrate of the transfer. I think After Earth doesn't hit the 30+ mbps of other films, so while the picture does look fantastic it's not going to be pixel perfect (especially in 50"" and larger tv screens). Second reason I hesitate on 4K movies is the fact 4K televisions are starting to come out, and I am guessing 4K disks will not be far behind as opposed to 1080p. Audio is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Lossless and you get it in both English and French (Spanish is in 5.1 Dolby Digital). It sure does hit the marks for a great sound experience. I personally found the dialog a tad bit on the light side, but aside from that it's a really good audio mix. This release also includes a DVD of the movie and a code to download a digital copy. The extras are a bit on the standard fare and are a bit disappointing considering how cool Shyamalan's previous extras have been. There isn't even a director's commentary. Here's the breakdown:

A Father's Legacy (HD, 8:51) - Will and Jaden Smith on set showing the family bonds between them. Some training shots as well. Kinda cute for those of us with kids and like to see other families get along.

Alternate Opening (HD, 2:19) - It's a short animated introduction to the film. I don't know if this is still a rough cut or what as the animation doesn't feel like it belongs. All in all it's better they went with the opening scene they did.

Building a World (HD, 12:00) - This is what I consider the proper making of featurette. Interviews with director, cast and crew as well as footage of practical and digital effects. It's short and not up to par with other Shyamalan ""making of"" features. But it's also better than a fluff piece by a small margin.

Pre-Visualization the Future (HD, 5:50) - A primer on pre-visualization animation and how it helps put a movie together. You get to see some scenes pre and post visualization.

The Animatics of After Earth (HD, 8:39) - Same as the pre-visualization, but this time with animatics (semi-animation).

1000 Years in 300 Seconds (HD, 5:25) - A ton of behind the scenes footage shot quick and to music. Kind of a quick fire documentary without explaining what you are seeing.

The Nature of the Future (HD, 5:22) - Documentary on the various natural on-location shots like Costa Rica, Utah and California. This featurette is set to act as a TV screensaver if you want it to. You just have to keep the disc running.

XPrize After Earth Challenge (HD, 3:35) - There was a competition for kids where they build a probe using LEGO Mindstorm to explore Nova Prime before the Earth Exodus. This tiny blurb only touches on this contest a tiny bit with just a short amount of footage from the winners. Disappointed as this was a pretty neat thing for the kids to attempt. It would have been nice to see a full blown documentary on it.

Previews - Other movies from Sony. Commercials essentially.

After Earth is flawed, but I can't help see some really good potential in this film. Enough potential for me to end up enjoying it. Will I buy this release? No. The extras are weak and the potential for a 4K release to come up in the future is too tempting. However I do heartily recommend a rental. Best results are if you read After Earth: United Ranger Corps Survival Manual first and then see the movie. Sorry about the prerequisite.",1395619200,,7999,4.48659793814433
5770565,5,B00D2ZF24O,"I've been waiting for some time to see this movie and I've been hearing such bad reviews about it.  Honestly after watching it, I was surprised that it is getting such bad reviews.  Are people so narrow minded that they can't see an actor in a different type of part, accept him and FEEL the part?  To me this movie was eye opening.  It was so shocking to see Will Smith without his swagger, being so cold and unfeeling - but then I began to understand.  When they crash landed on Earth I did wonder about the plot holes that only the General and Kitai were the only survivors, but hey, it's a movie - we are supposed to suspend our disbelief.  I knew this was going to be a movie that was primarily driven by Jaden/Kitai and I remembered what an outstanding job he did with Karate Kid (he had to train for hours each day, rehearse, film and get his school work done - not an easy feat when you have Will Smith and Jackie Chan riding your behind).

This movie kept me on the edge of my chair....the thought that us humans had destroyed Earth, not a very unrealistic thought.  Makes you start to wonder, if we did destroy Earth and had to leave, how would it recover without us there?  The panoramas they showed almost met my visions, though I kept thinking, I know us sneaky humans, not all of us would leave - so where are the stray wild humans?  Anyway Kitai's trek across the landscape was breath taking and I don't want to insert any spoilers here, there was on part that startled me so much that I let out a little shriek that frighted all of my dogs and they all started barking like crazy LOL.  Give this movie a chance - open your mind - suspend your disbelief and use your imagination and maybe you will be pleasantly surprised.

Only one part I want to share, there is a part at the very end when Kitai is facing down the bad guy, he is on his back - I ALMOST expect him to peel himself up on of ground and come up with some Will Smith type quote of ""I'm so sick to death of your candy azz""  But what he did was so much better!",1395360000,,2037,4.1395939086294415

With that being said, it's still another terrible entry in Shymalans once promising career. Will Smith is completely wasted here given almost nothing to do and Jaden Smiths acting is anything but enough to carry the film by himself. The films is really poorly written and paced with a script that is so thin and derivative, it feels more like a generic video game than an actual movie. Shyamalans direction is so weak here that it doesn't even feel like he even directed. I will say there is some good cinematography here and there, but the film offers nothing new and ends up being one of the most dull and boring viewing experiences I've had this year.

The worst part of After Earth though might be that it's only a further reminder of how low the once promising Shyamaln's career has sunk.",1395273600,3,913,4.560975609756097

However I write this review as a person of color, who would support a movie of an actor I like who's worth supporting. First for the record I thought the movie was a great sci-fi. It always seems that the Man of color always has to be at his best for white America to accept the talents of most talented A list actors & actresses. White America cannot accept the fact that young Jalen is making a name for himself & your child has to go the old fashion route of making it in the world. It's no different then someone in your family giving you the upper hand in life. Their are so many non-talented white actors & actresses getting introduced to us by force because the actors of ole are getting older, so to introduce us to these non acting actors so that the face of Hollywood could stay in power, is a tragedy!! To kill the spirit of an up and coming Actor as Jalen, to trash him in his progress from a child to mid teen actor is White America's prejudice towards the progress of anything strong & Black & uplifting!!

""Fear is not not real. The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future. It is a product of our imagination causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist. That is near insanity. And do not misunderstand me. Danger, is very real. But fear is a choice.  We are all telling ourselves a story. And when will mine change?""

5770593,2,B00D2ZF24O,"From the very beginning, you get the distinct feeling that Will Smith took this film so he could work with his kid on a catchy-sounding title. That realization is the high-point of this movie and it only gets worse from then-on. The only reason I give it two stars is that I was able to make it to the end. Typically, I will only rate a movie with one star if I am unable to make it entirely through.

The premise itself is beyond ridiculous. You have a high-tech, space-faring civilization with FTL technology, but the only weapon they have against this blind animal is a retractable sword -- no projectile or particle weapons. No thermal or other scanner capable of detecting them. No armor or shielding to survive attacks. None of this. Then you have the premise that a superior alien race manufactures these creatures specifically because they're pissed at us for daring to colonize another planet -- a barren, worthless wasteland of a world at that. So, instead of vaporizing us from orbit, they decide to engineer an invisible blind quadruped that can smell fear as its only means of sensory input. How it gets around other objects and obstructions but can't detect a fearless human is an otherworldly level of stupidity.

Now, the ""hero"" is Cadet Jaden ""My Dad is Will"" Smith. Every pedantic line and move he makes in this movie is so utterly trite and predictable you're five lines ahead of him and waiting for him to catch up. There are no surprises, no plot twists, no refreshing lines or perspectives. It's a movie utterly devoid of its own character, and every actor phones in his or her performance -- likely due to the horrendous atrocity they call a script.

He's a fine actor, the spitting image of his brilliant actor-dad, and brings believability to his space-aged role here.

The sci-fi elements are simple, the budget was probably small, but the film has heart, bravery, and a few surprises.

Although it isn't the creepy Sixth Sense (how many times can a director catch lightning in a bottle?), there's still an intrigue to the film that's enjoyable to watch.

Another disappointing aspect is that Will Smith does not play a large role in this movie. Instead we get the pleasure of watching the growing pains of Jayden's Smith's acting career.

Oh there is teary-eyedness to be had (at least theoretically) but I felt Jaden's performance

I applaud the effort to make a big budget science fiction movie, but if this is the best they can do then I really wish they hadn't.

I have to agree, why don't that use rifles or long range weaponry, I mean come on, it's like, well gotta go on a life threatening journey and save myself and my dad, better bring my award and fight monkeys and the most feared creature in existence. And done get me started on the packs, that small price of crap, there is no way you could have food, a supply of clean water, a med kit, breathing inhalers, a camera, communication device and still be that small. Even if it is in the future. And shouldn't the creature have died in the crash, heck, they all should have died. And in my opinion, M.

5770631,5,B00D2ZF24O,"I liked it. Didn't think I would. Thought like most here that the point of the entire film was for Will to get Jaden a major role with a known director with dad at his side to make sure it all went well.

And that may be what it was, in part, and it worked. It's only because Will was in it and Shyamalan directed it that I decided to give it a chance. I sat down to it thinking I'd watch long enough to see how Will and his son interact on screen, but  surprised myself by watching to the end. Whatever came next drew me in again and I was genuinely interested in seeing how it all turned out in the end.

For those criticizing the lack of reality to it, may I point you to M. Night Shyamalan's other films? The Village? Unbreakable? Signs? The Sixth Sense? It's always an intriguing but not-so-based-on-reality morality tale where a character finds courage, faith, integrity, and such to persevere and prevail. Criticize a Star Trek film for scientific (etc.) discrepancies but not a M. Night Shyamalan film (that from a proud-to-be trekkie).

Back to the film (and this will be brief, for I'm not a trained critic), being a huge fan of the MIB franchise, and loving Will in Independence Day, Enemy of the State, and I, Robot, he seemed to lack that familiar sparkle in this film, but he was not the main character. Jaden is new to me and it always takes a while to warm to a new face but as said, I couldn't turn away. The young man carried the film to the end. I will probably give his next film a chance (provided it's not teen fodder) with or without his dad at his side.

And, oh, that mama eagle . . . I almost cried. Twice. :).

So, don't avoid this film, but don't go into it expecting sound sci-fi credentials because it's not a sci-fi film. It's a M. Night Shyamalan film in a sci-fi setting. And viewed for what it is, it's pretty doggone good. Do not avoid it. Enjoy it.",1391126400,3,1884,4.233983286908078

Jaden is always on the verge of crying.  Will Smith is trying (badly) to act stoic and emotionless all the time.  There is absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters.  A lot of Jaden's dialogue is undecipherable.

A movie should not require effort to watch.

The pace of the film is like glue slipping down a wall: slow and awkward.  Characters are not developed.  The aliens are not developed.  The state of society in the future is not explained.  Basically, this is one of those films that asks you to care for no reason.  Like a B movie, it gives you some action and bad acting and expects you to walk away satisfied.

How did this get made?  It is the cream of the crap.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  You have been warned.",1391126400,3,870,4.316770186335404

The Aliens can smell fear an almost wipe out the Humans till Will Smiths character figures out that and becomes the Model for all Humans , but as many reviewers here has pointed out is why use a spear ?  ""Did the stand your own ground law "" , make Humans stop using guns? Also You see I the end of the movie they show the Soldiers wearing "" space suits "" , so why didn't they wear such suits to hid their scents in battle an plastic bubbles to protect their kids scents  ?

Also, as some have suggested in the movie SIGNS (which is a great movie) Aliens conquered interstellar space travel, but they couldn't figure out how to open a door. same is true here, are there no guns of any sort, projectiles, laser beams in the future? just a fancy spear???

I am still not sure what the point of the movie is, the storyline is not based up.....the riveting and interesting aspects of what the movie could have been. Watch Oblivion to understand what I mean.

5770732,3,B00D2ZF24O,"Movies have made some incredible science fiction films in the past. Everything from FANTASTIC VOYAGE to THE MATRIX  have displayed various worlds and dimensions that living in the real, normal world we never get to go to. Far off planets, microscopic worlds and the land of imagination are available on film. Movies have been done to warn us of the dangers we impose on our own world if we don't change our ways like SILENT RUNNING. While AFTER EARTH appears to be part of that sub-genre at first, it steers clear of heading down that path in exchange for another.

In the future the Earth has been so contaminated by man that survivors are placed in space ships and shuttled to a new universe to live in, hopefully not making the same mistakes. But a bigger problem follows when an inhospitable alien race tries to wipe man out by sending in bug like creatures called ursas that find humans by smelling the pheromones we emit when we fear something. A select group of soldiers known as Rangers develop a way to stop their fear thus making them invisible to these creatures so we stand a fighting chance against them. The leader of this group and most controlled is Cypher Raige (Will Smith).

Gone from home for some time and having lost his daughter to an ursa attack, Raige is ready to retire. At the same time his son Kitai (Jaden Smith) is in training at the academy, pushing himself as much as possible to live up to the legend that is his father. Both seem to have disconnected somewhere down the line. In an attempt to shore up that divide, Raige asks his son to accompany him on his last mission, a simple transport that includes a captured ursa.

But things don't go as planned and caught in an asteroid storm the ship is damaged and forced to land on a restricted planet. That planet is Earth. When Kitai wakes after the ship crashes he finds that he and his father are the only two survivors even though his father is severely wounded with 2 broken legs. Their ship was broken in two, their homing beacon damaged and now the only chance they have is for Kitai to reach the other half of the ship to turn on the homing beacon there.

While the adventure aspect of the film ties into what Kitai faces while making the near 100 mile trek to the other half of the ship, the film revolves more around the dynamic between father and son as they first come to terms with their problems and secondly must learn to trust one another as Cypher guides Kitai to the other half of the ship while trying to stay alive. This back and forth between father and son that must be solved for them both to make it, a slow process that sees them rebuild their connection is what makes up most of the film.

This is not to say that the film doesn't have several problems to overcome. To begin with the pacing is slow at times which makes it more a movie where we get to see images of a future redeveloped earth and its animal inhabitants instead of getting more story. Will Smith, confined to a seated position for the entire film, plays Cypher as an emotionally detached man who not only hides his fear but every other emotion as well which gets kind of boring after a time.

The person who will take most of the criticism for this film (and has from fans already) is Jaden Smith. A young actor with few parts to his credit already is bound to have those attacks, increased by some who scream nepotism on the part of his father. While Jaden's performance here isn't Oscar worthy he does turn in a decent performance and like his father in his early career has learned that being in fit form is one way to make an impression with audiences.

AFTER EARTH will not be a landmark when it comes to science fiction movies. It will offer a nice evening's entertainment though and should keep you interested from start to finish. Bypass the nitpicking of most on this film and give it a watch.",1388448000,3,3875,4.417366946778712
5770733,3,B00D2ZF24O,This movie seemed to lack the action we've come to expect from Will Smith. It was a good rental but I would have been disappointed at the theater.,1388448000,,146,4.25

The accents used is a bit off setting and makes the acting appear poor, but I think Jaden did a reasonable enough job.  Will Smith has been a favourite with me since the ""Fresh Prince of Bellaire"" and I like most of his movies.",1388448000,,506,4.185567010309279
5770736,4,B00D2ZF24O,"Another big-budget Hollywood project with a good cast, at least on paper. I like most of the movies that Will Smith has made but this role did not suit him well. Will Smith is best when he can display the breadth of his personality. He's funny, endearing and can be downright human when given the chance. Why in the world he took the role of an intentionally unemotional - or at least unfearful - space ranger who, due to his lack of fear, is awesome at killing alien enemies. You see, these aliens are blind but hunt based us by smelling pheromones released when we are afraid. They don't use any fancy technology to kill you - just tooth and claw - oh and BIG pincers!

Yes - this is where you say ""why don't the humans just make a few million gallons of synthetic pheromones and then have fun watching the aliens run around in circles all day?"" or perhaps ""Why don't the humans just wear full body suits with re-breathers so no pheromones are released into the atmosphere?"" or maybe ""Why don't these humans, who have advanced spaceships and all sorts of other cool tech, just use drones to kill the aliens because they would be 100% invisible?"".

All that before we get to the plot holes - who puts uber powerful distress beacons somewhere where the pilots can't get to them, and haven't these space rangers ever heard of explosive-projectile weapons?

And No, there are no reasonable responses to these questions EXCEPT to say that this was a way for Will Smith and his son to play a father and son duo in a big budget movie.

Jaden Smith gets most of the screen time and I'm sorry to say he wasn't ready for it. I loved him in Karate Kid and The Pursuit of Happyness but he didn't have the chops to pull this role off. He came across as whiny but not in a reasonable way. He just could not convey the range of emotion required from this role. His one flash of anger at his father came across as contrived and strained.

Despite the inappropriate role for Will Smith, the poor acting by Jaden Smith and conceptual holes big enough to drive a moon through, I still mostly liked this movie. It comes down to special effects, a great score, lush scenery and cool tech. I did not see this movie for insight into father-son bonds, or for any keen insights into humanity. I have art house films for that. When I told my own brain to shut up, sit back and relax, I found myself enjoying the movie.

Also, how did the Ursa find a dead body when they could only see a person when they smelled fear, and Not find the kid when he was lying around near the end of the movie?

5770753,1,B00D2ZF24O,"One line from Dune become the whole point of the movie that stinks, but just not with fear.

This movie is a total waste. It wasn't excusable for Jaden Smith to show no acting skills or charisma when he played Ralph Macchio in the forgettable remake of the Karate kid. But here where Will Smith is sidelined, and can't help out, the entire movie rests on the shoulders of a kid who needs more skill. In a future where evil aliens could have been wiped out if any human had a gun, the human race is on the verge of being destroyed because they build their houses out of shower curtains. Fortunately, Will Smith is able to defeat most of the aliens by stroking his phallus stick.

Most of the movie takes place on a planet where all the life has evolved to hunt humans, a species that doesn't live on the planet. Will smith is trapped in a chair and Jaden must climb a volcano to use a flashlight and stop stanking of fear and defeating the last evil alien with the right stroking of his own phallus stick.

If that plot description doesn't make sense, don't worry. The movie doesn't bother with logic or plot or character. Maybe a better actor could have pulled it off. Not this one. and I don't really blame the kid. Will Smith learned how to act during his TV series. His son just gets thrown into lead roles and is expected to know how to do it automatically.

This is a film where everyone was set up to fail.",1388188800,8,1412,4.277153558052435
5770754,2,B00D2ZF24O,"Ok, my wife rolled her eyes when she saw I brought this home from our local library to watch the other night. Sometimes she's right; sometimes not. This time the eye-rolling was well deserved.

I found the movie to be rather disjointed with father and son having flashbacks about one incident concerning a 19 y/o daughter/sister. This incident is supposed to be pivotal for both characters but never really cuts it for me. Ok, I get it: dad feels like then 9 y/o son should have attacked the alien after watching it kill his older sister and the son feels like dad should have been there to protect them both. In the end, though, I just didn't feel emotionally connected to either of these two main characters. Actually, I enjoyed the mom most of all and she was only in the film for 10 minutes or so. She was the only one with any kind of emotional depth. The father, played by Will Smith, is stereotypical military dad who is emotionally withdrawn from his children, in this case his son. The son, played by Will Smith's son Jaden, is likewise stereotypical 'I'm-somewhat-emotionally-sensitive-and-my-father-doesn't-understand-me-and-I'm-going-to-hold-him-accountable-for-the-psychological-pain-I'm-in."" And, the pain his son feels from this emotionally distant father isn't adequately explained either. Once again, I get it: father is military hero and son wants to be like his dad and in the end they both seem to learn something from one another. But, like I said, it's a choppy story at best.

The movie never did a satisfying job explaining many things. For instance, how did we develop so quickly technologically for interstellar travel and yet could not repel aliens with anything other than these special staffs that, for all intents and purposes, are little more than swords? Additionally, the movie doesn't explain whether we were still at war with these aliens because it certainly didn't seem like we were. The father takes his son on his ship like it was 'take your kid to work day' and then, BOOM! the boy has to fight for his life back on Earth where everything has evolved to kill humans. The sense of urgency in this movie was centered around these creatures--in this case, just one that crash landed with everybody else. This creature could smell the pheromones we excreted when we were afraid. Ironically, for being a creature who is such an effective killer it took the thing a painfully long amount of time to find the kid. And, someone please explain to me why we didn't develop suits that made it impossible to smell those pheromones so we could wipe out all of the alien creatures?

The technology is very elegant and engaging, but other than that this movie left me wanting a whole lot more. Will Smith's son, Jaden, tries to make it all work and he has his moments but just couldn't carry the movie for me. So, I'd pass on this one if I were you. At least in Shamalan's other alien take-over movie, Signs, there was a sense of mystery and suspense. I could enjoy the characters and forgive some of the inconsistencies in the plot. Here, I feel like the humans deserve to die for being silly enough to not walk around with some type of gun, laser or otherwise.",1388188800,,3187,4.790909090909091
5770755,3,B00D2ZF24O,For once the reviews were right on the money. This movie did not have the punch I expect from good science fiction.

5770763,5,B00D2ZF24O,"After Earth, considered to be one of the worst science-fiction movies of the year, decade, century, whatever...pro reviewers are paid to write not actually SEE the movies they write about. I watched this flick four times, and yes, I could watch it four more with little or no difficulty. Why? First, it's about the most important factor to human survival - family. A father and son standing apart until fate makes them see one another in a different light. On a planet where everything evolves for the sole purpose of killing human beings, Will Smith and his (real life) son Jaden Smith must survive, despite a special living cargo that wants only to eat them, or tear the apart, or otherwise destroy them...but survival depends on a young man's trek (100Km) to reach one part of the ship that holds their salvation. To do this impossible mission the younger Smith must use all his training as a future space ranger, and all his wits to dodge wild animals, deadly plants, and the creature that was aboard the spaceship before it crashed. His father's legs broken, all Will Smith can do is monitor (live feed from a backpack worn camera array) the journey, dangers, close-calls, and finally the victory of his son's journey both on the planet, in his heart, and of his growth to manhood, winning the respect he longed for as a child at last. This is a feel-good, adventure heavy, survivalist to the max, father-son struggle that wins at every level. Graphics may not win prizes, but the monsters are believable enough to make you sit on the edge of your chair as the young would-be ranger battles for his life and even befriends one enormous threat to his continued living. I felt the landscapes were solid, better than hundreds of other movies I've watched and on par with Jurassic Park - which means the world of the movie is one that tugs at your nerves, making you realize ""flight or fight"" is not just a great three-word option, it is all that comes between living and dying on the planet the younger Smith dreams of visiting and is destined to conquer.

5770804,5,B00D2ZF24O,"I find myself at a lost for words, which for me is a rarity. I got the symbiotic design of the vessel and homes in this futuristic wonderment. I clearly understood (or rather over-stood) how the necessity of sustainability was realized and upheld by the people who created in a time that came after the exhaustion of resources on earth a mindset and an environment  that respects the world in which they now inhabit. I got that.

What blew my wife, and I along with multiple other like minded quantum physic / spiritual theorists away was what we interpreted as a much larger meaning in this film. We interpreted it as; ""fear limits and hinders all things"", especially ourselves and the methods that we use as connecting. I could go on for pages to say the least concerning that particular portion of the film and I won't but Will and Jaden did a marvelous job.

Viewing two African Americans in pivotal performances such as those presented in this film was icing on a very well done cake. It was a film about healing, about growth, honor, commitment, and love. Not everyone is going to ""get"" this movie. ""Good"". Somethings aren't for everyone and I feel blessed knowing I and others whom I deem as treasured ""got it"".

5770828,1,B00D2ZF24O,"So, yeah, I know. After Oblivion, why would I want to and watch After Earth?

Either it was some weird form of masochism or it was Will Smith.
Actually, it was Will Smith and all the bad stuff said about his son because of the movie. I needed to see, okay! Sometimes, you just have to know, like when someone says, ""This tastes awful! You try it,"" and you do. You're thinking, ""Surely, it can't be that bad,"" but, then, it is, and you get mad at the person offering you the taste even though he told you it was going to be bad.

And, wow, After Earth was bad. So bad.

And, you know what, I'm not even going to talk about the stupid science in this movie.

I lied.

In one of the most ridiculous scenes I've ever witnessed in a movie, Cypher (Will Smith) gets up from his seat and places his hand against the interior hull of the spaceship he's in. He goes to the cockpit and tells the pilots that he feels gravitons and wants to know what's going on. This is like saying, ""Hey, I feel some neutrinos; what's up with that?"" Anyway, there's a field of asteroids nearby, and, sure enough, when they check, they find there's a sudden buildup of gravitons happening, and Cypher tells them to be careful because the asteroids might suddenly explode. Predictably, the graviton levels start to drop... just before the asteroid field spontaneously explodes. Because that's what asteroids do when they're sitting around in space; they spontaneously explode. The ship is forced to crash land on Earth, abandoned by mankind 1000 years prior.

Cypher and his son, Kitai, are, again predictably, the only survivors of the crash, but Cypher is badly wounded, which sets up the contrived scenario where Kitai has to go trekking across the planet to get to the other part of the ship to fetch a homing beacon. He has to trek across the planet on which ""every living thing has evolved to kill humans."" Oh, and climb an active volcano. No, wait, I don't just mean active; I mean actively active. As in, it's in the process of erupting. Because that's such a great idea. And I won't even go into the part where he has to fight the alien that they brought along with them, another thing that has evolved or been engineered ""just to kill humans.""

The very first thing that happens to Kitai when he leaves the one end of the ship is that a spider crawls on him. But this spider that has evolved ""just to kill humans"" doesn't hurt him. And, of course, none of the plants hurt him. But here's the thing: 1000 years ago all of the animals on Earth were basically the same as they are now. 2000 years ago, they were basically the same. 5000 years ago, they were basically the same. 10,000 years ago, they were basically the same. Yet, 1000 years in the future, all of the animals have evolved ""just to kill humans."" And we see some significantly different animals, like some kind of saber-toothed tiger, on this future Earth. And, I'm sorry, I have to call ""Bull****!"" How about adding some science to your science there.

And I'm not even going to go into the physics involved in a bird no bigger than Kitai flying off with him. I'm just gonna say ""bull****!"" again. I'm also not going to go into how the entire planet freezes over every night and, yet, remains lush and green. I don't even have a word for that, because bull**** doesn't cover it.

Now, I haven't seen The Happening, but I do know what it's about, and After Earth struck me as nothing more than a bad sequel to a bad movie. Another low for M. Night. The bad thing here is that Will Smith brought Shyamalan into the project, not the other way around.

So, yeah, the original story idea was Smith's, but it involved a car crash in the woods in which the father is injured and the son has to go for help, and he should have just stuck with that story. But he decided he wanted to go sci-fi with it, so he hired a guy who wrote a script then went to Shyamalan with the script who also worked on the writing of the script and what Smith ended up with was a disaster that should have crashed in the woods and been left there.

I mean, not only is there no science in the science in the sci-fi movie, but they stripped out of Cypher Raige (yeah, really? he needs a name like ""Raige""?) everything that makes Will Smith an enjoyable actor. Cypher is nothing more than the stereotypical emotionless military character out of touch with his son. Of course, Smith didn't want the movie to be about him; he wanted it to be about his son. This was to be the movie to give Jaden a foothold into his own career of action stardom.

And that's the second reason I wanted to see After Earth. I liked Jaden in the remake of Karate Kid, but he got slammed pretty hard for his performance in Earth, and I wanted to know if it was justified. After watching it, I'm not sure. Based on his performance in Karate Kid, I'd like to say his performance in Earth is due to bad directing (because his father certainly delivered one of the worst (possibly the worst) performances of his career), but it's hard to know with only one other movie to compare against. He certainly didn't help the movie any, though, and his scene where he stands on the cliff and yells at his father through his communicator was almost painfully awful. But I really want to give him the benefit of the doubt and blame it on Shyamalan, who hasn't made anything watchable in over a decade. I guess we'll just have to see what happens. Assuming Jaden Smith gets another chance. A movie that crashes and burns as hard as this one did can kill a career.",1386633600,4,5538,4.381694255111976

It was very tastefully done!  I prefer PG-13 and G rated movies and this was superbly done...its clean...has no profane language and is still full of twists, turns and excitement!

Will Smith is an ber egomaniac.  His attitude may or may not be warranted but it is loathsome to see his young son strutting about with a similar demeanor; having not yet earned his acting chops.  Also, 50% of the time (and I am being kind) Jaden Smith can barely enunciate his words and what does come through is a weird, watered-down, British accent. The Will Smith character has an American accent. And what's up with the mother and the daughter? They look like identical twins. What really makes this movie dumb and RACIST is Jaden Smith's propensity to oversleep throughout the movie a la Lincoln Perry.  Just dreadful. Pass on this stinker.

Im kicking myself for being talked out of seeing this in theaters. I had no idea what it was about and was nervous because it was an M Night Shyamalan movie. Whats that got to do with anything? Well, Shyamalan is best known for The Sixth Sense (1999) which gave us a bend on the surprise ending no one saw coming. Its a formula he repeated in movies like Signs (2002) and Lady in the Water (2006). Movies, where everything fits together, at the end, and you get to see all the little points along the way add up to a big finish. In my opinion Unbreakable (2000) is a classic and gives us the realest depiction of a super-hero without using a comic-based format, but includes every motif and clich. See, movies like The Village (2004) and The Happening (2008) left many with questions about his continued ability to deliver at his highest potential. After all, Devil (2010) was another wont-tell-you-the-plot-until-you-see-it and the curious pay off wasn't as revealing as it could have been. Lets just say we didn't see the Saw [a reference to the 2004 horror flick] in this movie.

Will Smith presents another problem for potential movie-goers as his star power and box-office draw was super-high then. And so you expect another blockbuster- another big movie and wow, his son Jaden Smith co-stars, well, really stars. (The Karate Kid 2010 wasn't as good as the original, but was way better than any of its sequels so.) Im saying expectations may have been too high and perhaps another mysterious movie with a surprise ending may not be the best formula to run with.

Proper Plots

Lets cover what the movie is really about and get down for the set up. Its far into the future and Earth has been lost to the self-inflicted wounds of environmental pollution. We flee to the stars and find ourselves in a war with aliens. Will Smith plays General Kitai Raige and during a space voyage, their transport is crippled and its up to not-yet-a-space-ranger Jaden (as Cypher Raige) to cross the dangerous landscape to reach help. Is Will Smith in the movie? Yes, and its not a goofy hologram or ghost, but the movie is the debut of a young action hero in the making. I can dig it. And I also see what the second problem is. You wanted Will Smith to be bounding over those rocks, facing peril and outlined against wondrous vistas. And maybe you wanted some kind of big message at the end or some sort of moral statement with all kinds of pretentious and righteous writer wit. No, you get the story of a father standing by and letting his son brave a new and hostile world. Thats true- for both the Raige and Smith families, for After Earth and Hollywood.

After the Earth summary

Certainly its no spoiler to tell you -there is no big-surprise ending or twist and the movie flows and unfolds as expected. Yes, you can relax without worrying if M Night is going to ruin it in the last five minutes. If you have a family that might enjoy and sci-fi tale, this is a solid movie.

5770889,2,B00D2ZF24O,"Spoilers ahead.

I avoided this movie when it first arrived primarily due to being busy and the fact that it was getting ravaged by critics.  Being a sci-fi fan and also a fan of Will Smith I decided to take a shot.  Is it really so awful?  Well, it's not very good but it's not terrible on Blu ray either.  What it is, is another mess and missed opportunity by director and screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan.  The story (by Will Smith) had some promise.

Set in the distant future, a thousand years or so after the Earth was all but destroyed for human habitation.  Cypher Raige (Will Smith) is a general in charge of space exploration or some such thing.  He's a big shot on the planet where Earthlings were evacuated to, those many years ago.  He's married and has a teenage son, Kitai (Jaden Smith) who is trying to get through ""Ranger"" training.  He's athletic but like all teens of his age, impatient and well, dumb sometimes.  The father-son relationship is strained and distant.  We learn this is due to the loss of a daughter and sister (Zoe Kravitz in flashback scenes) years earlier as she tried to fight off some giant monster-thing protecting her young brother.

At the coaxing of wife Faia (Sophie Okonedo), Cypher makes an effort to improve the relationship with Kitai.  This leads to the lad accompanying his dad on a deep space mission.  After encountering a fierce meteor storm, their ship breaks apart and crashes on a dangerous planet.  Yep, Earth.  It is now inhabited only by wild animals and subject to wide fluctuations in temperature.  The rest of the story involves the severely injured Cypher directing his son to find his way to the aft part of the ship, located a hundred miles away.  That is where the rescue beacon can be launched for the search party.

Although the entire crew has been killed in the crash (but for our two heroes) and there is no way to communicate with the home planet, the electronics and cameras in the front part of the ship where the Raiges have survived, work locally!  So Cypher can watch and help Kitai on his hazardous journey.  Huh?  Kitai runs into all kinds of trouble of course, having to fight off baboons and eventually the monster-thing who was being transported on the ship and is now loose on Earth.  Oh, and both Cypher and Kitai have some kind of ""ghosting"" ability that has to do with controlling fear or something.

Shyamalan's string of movies seem to get worse with each release.  ""After Earth"" is but a continuation.  While the film looks great, there is little tension or worry that Kitai will accomplish his mission.  While rated PG-13 for ""action violence and disturbing images (the monster-thing), the film could have easily been rated PG and worn a Disney badge.

The 4K 1080p Blu ray transfer is as good as it gets.  With much of the film shown on an Earth with mostly wooded or jungle like locals, the colors really pop.  Beautiful greens and blues.  The digitally created animals look great.  Detail is superb.  Likewise the audio is spectacular.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track rages with thunderous opening sequence that involves all the speakers.  The dialog is beautifully translated, clear and accurately centered.  Certainly no complaints with the way the film looks or sounds.  Here is a list of extras:

The demeaning of  M.Night's work is a mystery to me.  It resonates for me in the changing climate we're experiencing.  MN's work suggests our hand in this outcome.  As if we had become the virus attacking the planet and Earth finding ways to heal itself.

In this sense, humans are not the clear hero as we destroy that which sustains us, our family structure, our air, and continue to prepare for battle out of the fear of....self-imagined and imposed pressures.

I love science fiction and the technology employed was impressive but I think the movie focused a bit too much on the tech. And the enemy is weird too and though the concept behind it artistically speaking is awesome its weird the enemy once see it you'll start question the logic behind its development a bit.

They all had the weird accents I'll leave that there.

And for the life me their weapons were not what I expect them to be. Yes a Klingon uses a Batleth (or however you spell it) but they also use a ranged weapon ... no ranged weapons in this movie kind of a let down.

I thought there was a good story here, nothing original though. No stand-out performances or scenes.  This could been a pretty good movie.  Unfortunately, the decision to cast Jaden Smith was a poor choice.  The young man simply does not have his fathers inherent skills.  I suspect there are other very rewarding careers within the film industry which young Jaden can pursue, away from being on-screen, in which his father can pull strings and call in favors.

My opinion is to take a pass on this film and pull out an old classic such as Soylent Green, When Worlds Collide, West World or  The Andromeda Strain.",1384819200,,728,4.776

Jaden Smith starts off with one of the worst narrations possible including a really terrible accent of some sort.  This film had some great visuals and was on the verge of being a really good sci fi throughout the film but kept falling short with the horrible acting of Jaden Smith.  I think had this film been the debut for a completely uknown actor in the lead role it could have catapulted them into sci fi fame but Jaden was the lead role unfortunately.  The Smith acting chops didn't gift the whole family.,1384732800,,601,4.477064220183486

5770932,2,B00D2ZF24O,"This film would probably work well as a book, or perhaps a graphic novel....or a lunchbox...or a meatloaf. Essentially, it would work better as anything apart from the film it ended up being. The characters had an interesting sort of hybrid accent conglomerating elements from around the world, giving the distant future a cool polyglot effect, and Will Smith did well as a militaristic, absentee father, with Jaden playing the part of a forsaken son trying to prove himself to his father nearly without flaw. However, the story could have been told in its entirety within about 5 minutes, with very little dialogue, and much of that dialogue awkward and phoned in, in terms of writing. The second star I gave it was for the visuals. Much of the aesthetic is downright breathtaking, or at least would be were it not unabashed, ten-yards-behind-cutting-edge CGI. All told, this film is summed up ideally by the trailer: computer-generated monsters (totaling 5 species, 4 of which are shown therein) and Will and Jaden Smith playing themselves on a lean weekend.",1384646400,,1060,4.994350282485875

Some of the folks that reviewed it could not be more off base. I think it's M Night's best effort in some time. The flashbacks were well done, acting was fine and it flowed well. I think it's movies like this one that often lead me to ignore the advice of others and just see it for myself and make up my own mind. The reviews that people wrote about this one are reminiscent of Waterworld and the Postman back in the 90s; both of these despised by large numbers of snobbish critics but I enjoyed them a great deal.

5770956,3,B00D2ZF24O,Only an average movie. Interesting concept and plot but doesn't develop into it's full potential. Jaden's character seems too young for the role.,1384387200,,145,5.3478260869565215
5770957,3,B00D2ZF24O,"There is no Sci-fi storyline. It is nothing but a scared kid encountering one deadly scary creature after another. There is no story except the kid trying to prove to his overbearing militaristic father; he is not a coward. It is all based on his fathers failure to give him assurance & parental support. The kid has a permanent whiny expression & tone throughout the entire movie. This kid constantly whines about everything.

I liked many of M Night's earlier movies. But remember Swartzenegger's ""Last Action Hero?"" You can't have a major star on the sidelines of a kid actor in any movie. It would go bad regardless of the theme & the kid ends up the target of the audience's anger at being cheated from seeing the star in action.

Even when things are going good, Jaden is whining & wearing that crybaby expression until the very end. It seems to be the only expression he knows. I'll bet he also has it at home. He needs to find some non confrontational career but nothing with Customer support or critical systems where he would be under pressure. This kid cannot withstand pressure. Perhaps a job at HP or working on camera crews. But he does not have the Stamina or personality to be an actor. He may be able to act but he won't survive the politics of Hollywood without a driving personality. The parents need to back off the pressure on this kid. He can't take it. They might drive him to drugs if they don't back off. He doesn't have the stamina for acting. Fathers are very bad about overdriving sons. They should just provide positive support on what he is good at & stop pushing him to compete with his dad. This is a common problem with children of parents who are larger than life in their careers. Take it from our experience. He doesn't have his father's drive or capability IRL & it will end up badly if pushed.

As for the lack of storyline, I really get tired of sci-fi movies with nothing but battles or scary creatures or aliens. I want a story with what events happened to cause those conditions; discoveries of ruins & survivors (not living in some dark caves) using ingenuity to survive in uplifting stories without constant creatures.

Remember ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars?"" Despite the dumb title, it was very engrossing as to how he learned to overcome obstacles to survive. Remember the clues & final revelation of the original Planet of the Apes? That was sci-fi at its best.

Stories about discovering a surviving underground society on Mars would also be a good story as long as someone doesn't turn it into a creature battle or Warring civilizations or vicious prometheus aliens or some sick irradiated society like they created on Beneath Planet of the Apes & Battle for"".

A deep thinking story on survival & society working together and positive alien societies would be nice. I'm sick of the violence with no story. I'm sick of violence & gore period. Also sick of dark, dank, grungy sets.

""Oblivion"" was a nice clean, technology sci-fi with a great storyline for a change. So was ""Moon"" although the deterioration of Sam was too gross & graphic. But otherwise a great change of pace. Go for uplifting or surprising stories of integrity & technology & survival without the other crap.",1384387200,,3221,4.640350877192983
5770958,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I don't know why people are complaining about this movie.  I really liked it a lot.  Yes, it is not a ""typical"" Will Smith movie.  Will played a very serious father and leader.  He had learned not to show fear in order to kill the Ursa's who only can smell pheromones and not see the person they are to fight.  The relationship between father and son was mostly a military type relationship, ""yes sir!"" and so on.  Because the the limited time the father had with his son, he had taught him what he felt he needed to survive in this world. And these things helped his son and himself work to survive their ship crash when there was no one to immediately help them.

I thought the scenery and effects were beautiful and the writing was superb.  It was a DIFFERENT movie for Will Smith and he carried it off beautifully.  Jaden is a young man and he did an excellent job.  What do people expect of a young person?  He is learning and getting better all of the time.  This movie did NOT suffer due to Jaden's inexperience in acting.  What do you suppose a young person like that would do in the situation he found himself in?  He was training to be a Ranger but was not accepted yet.  This shows he had much to learn and he wouldn't be some experienced person before his time.

I am glad I ordered this movie - it sounded intriguing and I LIKED IT!

5770980,3,B00D2ZF24O,"After Earth(released May/13)stars,among others,Jaden Smith as Kitai Raige,Will Smith as Cypher Raige,Sophie Okonedo as Faia Raige and Zo Kravitz as Senshi Raige. This is quite a decent Sci-Fi tale,that I didn't think was going to do it for me,with the pairing of Will and his son. But lo and behold Will's son Jaden comes through and actually turns in a respectable performance.
The story finds father Will as a General in the army of the future,Rangers to be exact. The Earth is unlivable for humans and they have vacated it for other environs 1,000 years before. To top this their new home Nova Prime has been invaded by alien creatures who use their ""dogs"",called Ursas,to hunt humans and kill them. An Ursa is blind and hunts by smell. To stop over producing pheromones which the Ursas can detect,the Rangers try to learn a technique to suppress all emotion called ""ghosting"".
Jaden is haunted by the memories of his sister being killed by an Ursa. She died as he watched. Now his father is returning home on his birthday and he has failed to become a Ranger. It is a tense reunion and Will decides(with a bug in his ear from his wife)to take his son with him on a simple mission to take a captured Ursa to another planet for training purposes. Will tells his wife that this is his last mission and he wants to retire and work with her when he returns. Along the way their ship gets caught in a meteorite storm and they are forced down on a restricted planet. The planet is old Earth. Their scanners and warning systems tell them that everything there is deadly. Will is hurt in the crash and his son must travel in a heavier gravity and with a limited air supply to the tail section located about 60 miles away. The reason is that the distress beacon on board has been damaged and the only other one is there.
Jaden travels through dense forests,over hills and through rivers. His first problem comes when a pack of baboons try to corral him,then chase him. Then a leech attaches itself to his hand,whose poison almost costs him his life. In his struggles his vital air supply is damaged and he has little if any chance of reaching his goal. Countermanding his fathers orders to turn back,he continues and starts by jumping off a tall cliff. The environmental suit he wears is equipped with limited flying capabilities,similar to a flying squirrel. In his descent his is followed and eventually captured by a huge condor like creature,which takes him to its nest. When he awakens the nest is attacked by large cat like creatures. He manages to fend them off and he descends by rope to the forest floor to resume his travels. However the condor continues to follow him,presumably to recapture him and kill him.
Jaden decides to build a raft and take the river downstream. He falls asleep and dreams his dead sister is there talking with him. She tells him to wake up which he eventually does,but everything has turned cold. On his journey he has had to reach geo-thermal spots which don't freeze in order to stay alive at night. Now the cold has started to envelop the area and he is caught short.he continues,desperately looking for shelter by cannot find any. He collapses and lays on the ground ready to die. However some unseen hand drags his body to a depression in the ground and covers him
up. The next morning he awakes and extricates himself. It turns out it was the giant condor that saved him,and who died in the cold. It never meant Jaden harm,but probably thought he was one its young.
Jaden,just by the skin of his teeth,finally makes the tail section and resupplies himself. However the Ursa the ship was carrying has escaped. The beacon he finds doesn't work,but he soon realizes he must climb up a volcanic mountain nearby in order to reach higher ground. Along the way the Ursa picks his scent up and dogs him all the way. When Jaden finally reaches  summit,the beacon comes on and works. At that moment the Ursa arrives also and throws Jaden down,injuring him badly. At that moment he has an epiphany and he realizes he must suppress all emotions if he is ever going to live. This he does and he defeats the Ursa. The beacon activates and both he and his ailing father get saved and they receive the medical attention they need. In an emotional ending,Will orders his attendants to stand him up. He salutes his son,who can only react by running to him and hugging him. He tells his father he wants to work with his mother too.
The movie doesn't have alot of superfluous scenes and Jaden is pretty much on his own throughout most of the film. Once they crash land and Jaden is on his way,Will has to sit things out at the main section and guide his son along,as he is severally injured. The camera cuts from father to son get less and less the longer Jaden is into his destination,eEspecially when the communication between the two is severed. As I mentioned earlier Jaden acquits himself nicely. Though he has alot to learn of the biz yet,he is certainly off to a good start. The S/Fx are very good here and we get a nice slant of what Earth would look like 1000 years+ from now,as nature has taken back what was hers to begin with. The very last shot is the ship flying out over Earth's ocean,which is teaming with whales on or near the surface. And while that environmental element/moral is there,as befits the times we live in,it is not smacking us over the head as some films have done,thank goodness.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include four featurettes.
All in all a better film than I thought it would be. This is an M. Night Shyamalan film and is a step up from the past few duds he has helmed. Jaden Smith ""brings it"" on screen,as Will steps into the background to let the spotlight shine on him. It works for me. 3 1/2-4 stars. Recommended.",1384041600,,5834,4.535104364326376

5770985,5,B00D2ZF24O,"What were the critics thinking when they started saying this was a poor movie?

Oh, yeah, they are a bunch of Democrats and Republicans ...

The last time I enjoyed a good movie in the movie theaters was back in the 1980 with movies like Star Wars and such... back when the movie going experience was worth the $5.

Not one single movie that I have seen of late has made me think that I should have paid the $12 of today's theaters ( before the popcorn and soda) so it is not surprising that people are not seeing any real value in the Theater presentations anymore --

But this movie is absolutely worth watching... And to the critics that said Jayden's acting was subpar -- he managed to convey the nature of what the character was feeling and did so quite splendidly... better than the Harry Potter trio at this state of careers.

First, this is a ""Coming of Age"" movie set in a futuristic setting with terror at hand. There are no fantastical aliens, yet... and it would be interesting to see the follow up movies to this one... there is bound to be as this was more of a foundation. Jayden's character is probably going to be in the mix.

Usually where you have kids playing the hero -- it is absolutely rediculous -- see Harry Potter, and several of the Jurasic Parks where the kids are the heroes -- but here the kid is both reluctant to be the hero, determined to prove he can, and placed as the ONLY CHOICE to be so... this is NOT a Will Smith movie as he only played a supporting role -- this is a Jayden Smith movie and shows that he is growing as good in acting now as he was in Karate Kid... he will be on par with many top actors of today's day, so long as he does not become another hollywood kid statistic.

Do I recommend this movie -- Yes and not just to sci-fi-ers but to anyone who is interested in human endurance movies.

Final note... I watch this via Amazon's Instant Video program for $5 -- and not in an uncomfortable modern theater that can not maintain the glamour for a reasonable rate. worth every penny.",1383955200,,2034,4.278645833333333

5771002,3,B00D2ZF24O,"I read the reviews when film first came out and now that I've finally seen it (checked it out from the library), I found it wasn't that bad, I'd describe it as average. The biggest weakness is the story is too thin. The director has been knocked for the movie but I thought the directing (except for one shot which I'll mention later) was fine. It was a professionally made movie, scenes were in focus, the CGI adequate, not the best I've seen but okay. I liked Will Smith's character, he played what reminded me of an african amercian military Mr. Spock, a stereotypical unemotional officer with a tiny hint of humor (more underplayed humor would've been nice). His acting, as usual, was good. The son character, Katai, played by Jaden Smith, is a very nice young man and I thought Jaden did very well, except for one scene at the end of the movie where he sees that his father, surrounded by medical staff, has survived; at that point, where the director shot the General's hand in closeup, and shot that sequence in such a way as to tantalize the audience about whether the Will Smith character survived or not, Jaden should have done something, bowed his head, a small smile, something to indicate his relief and happiness that his father survived, but Jaden didn't react. The director should've gotten that shot, when the final movie was put together and reviewed, someone should've pointed out that very important missing reaction, especially considering that theirs was the main relationship on display in the movie, and that saving his father was Katai's primary job.  Other than that missing shot, Jaden's acting was okay - pretty solid for a 14 or 15 year old. Jaden is relatively inexperienced and needed a very knowledgeable director; the director hasn't had a major success in a while, so he was too tentative, not confident enough to tell Jaden what he needed. Their collaboration wasn't awful, and was mostly good, but had Jaden been more experienced and the director been more confident, the audience would've gotten a much better story. I disagree with the poor reviews Jaden got. I think he just needs to act in alot more projects and watch alot of films with a wide range of actors. He's got the chops, just needs more experience.

The major problems in my opinion were the writing of the Katai character, and how late in the story the monster appeared. Katai needed more to do, he was not proactive enough when he was first introduced into the story. Yes in the end he saved his father, yes he survived and activated the beacon, but the audience needed him to do more, so I think the problem was with the story and it's structure. A teenager and his father take a trip, there's an accident leaving the father seriously injured and the teenager has to traverse dangerous terrain to get help. The story is too thin, there needed to be at least one other element to give Katai something more to do, someone else to help, perhaps even another person to help him.  Katai needed someone else to care for, in addition to saving his father. The other problem was the Ursa monster. Monster in this story didn't make an appearance until the final act, not enough time for the audience to perceive it as a threat. A comparison would be in Jaws if the shark hadn't appeared until the final act when it destroyed the boat. What if the shark hadn't taken out the lady swimmer, or the kid, or attacked the other characters. Well it would've been jaws-lite, a movie without the shark until the third act. Such a movie would not have kept people out of the water and scared the be-jesus out of them for years after.

Another thing, why would a giant eagle-like creature attack Katai presumably to feed it's hatching young, only later to save and sacrifice itself to keep him warm? Not believable that a wild animal would do such a thing. So really, overall, I'd say the script was the problem. Had Katai been given enough to do and had the audience been given more information about him when he was first introduced into the story, it would've helped the audience attach to him. As presented, Katai proved himself to be courageous and ultimately successful, and it was fine to show he possessed those characteristics, but the audience needed more to help them attach to him. Would've been great if the writer had created situations to highlight that he was resourceful. Running for your life doesn't make you resourceful in a film, all characters run for their lives when physically threatened if they're able to. Resourcefulness is something a hero/heroine in an action adventure needs to demonstrate to get the audience's attention.  When a writer makes their lead character resourceful, that means the character will be proactive, do something, be unpredictable and by extension, interesting. Katai was too passively written and by that I mean the writer didn't create enough opportunities to display his strengths.  Saving his father occurred in the 3rd act, he needed mini successes, mini jobs, along the way that occurred in the 1st and 2nd acts as well. He needed other characters, his interaction with them would've given the audience more chances to see and subconsciously judge his heroic nature, helping us to respect and admire him. The writer did not provide those characters or those needed situations. And whoever approved the final script did not know enough about story to understand that crucial elements were missing.

A comparison, Luke in Star Wars: A New Hope. By the time Luke was working to rescue the Princess while he was trying to escape from the Death Star, the audience already loved him. Why? Well Luke was a good kid, he stayed and worked on the farm helping his aging and not altogether healthy relatives (his uncle was limping in that movie if you recall) though he wanted passionately to leave for school. And speaking of that, he wanted schooling, something most citizens agree should be a child's birthright. Also a birthright, knowledge about your parentage, which his uncle was clearly withholding. So Luke was being denied his birthright. And though he was frustrated by his uncle, he still obeyed him, taking care of the robots, who, by the way, he treated courteously though they were slaves. Luke was liked and was being rooted for well before he engaged the Empire. And the villain, the Empire, was one of the first elements on screen, and the audience saw what they were capable of and it was obvious they were the bad guys. And as to resourcefulness, Luke was able to talk a resistant Han Solo into helping rescue the Princess, and he also got Leia across a bridge using only abit of thin rope. Katai needed other characters, other situations, to demonstrate his resourcefulness, to help us see him as a young man of value, and help us attach to him, and that attaching needed to be done before he began his quest. For the audience, Katai's successful journey on the hostile earth should have just validated audience emotionally backing him, but the backing (attaching) should've been done by the time he regained consciousness post-crash. The writer emphasized the father/son dynamic, and there was nothing wrong with that, but we needed more than that, we needed more from Katai's point of view, as he is the story hero.

So that's why I think the film wasn't as successful in America as it might have been, but I think it did well enough worldwide. Grade: 2 and 3/4 stars, rounded up to 3.
P.S. Considering Jaden Smith has only been in what maybe 5 major films or so, I think he's got the makings of a good actor. And it doesn't hurt that he's handsome.  I hope the Smiths keep trying and develop more features for their children. I'm African American and I definitely enjoyed seeing a family of African American descent in a futuristic film. Well done Smiths. Not too bad Mr. Director.
P.S.S. Just remembered that I also liked that the music didn't hit me over the head being overly dramatic. I prefer a light touch in big movie music cues, and got that here. Also liked the ladies acting who played the mom and the daughter.",1383782400,,8077,4.718639262934089

Unfortunately this film is slow and not really gripping.  It's sort of like the Matrix IV (had they made a fourth film).  No, the story isn't the same, but the action element of the story competes with the symbolism of the story in the same way (if, in fact, the writer intended any symbolism between the tech-enabled omnipotent father and his son's sojourn on Earth).  And that symbolism could have been very goodit worked well in ""The Lion King"".

Will Smith might be able to carry an entire movie on his own (in fact he's probably earned a ""Cast Away"" moment for himself) but this film isn't about Will Smith.  It's about his kidalone on screen for well over half the film!  If you fell in love with Jaden in recent hits like ""The Karate Kid"" remake, then you'll really lov... What?  Oh, you didn't?  Never mind then.

In short, this film is a mix of lackluster action mixed with moments of slow, monotonous air-conditioned sleepy spaceship dialog (like Stargate Universe, only less interesting).

On a positive note, I think it's great that Will and Jada are creating family bonding experiences through their films.  Who cares about the profitability!  They're having fun making movies together as a familyand that's what counts.",1383350400,,1420,4.766393442622951

5771051,4,B00D2ZF24O,"Thankfully, I believe no one will get up the anger or care enough to punch me in the face for what I'm about to write. M's movies, as I have digested them, are not as they appear to be. Please bear with me on this, and forgive the seemingly banal statement. His recent effort, a story about a boy's trials, felt to me to be about the deeper struggle of maintaining the connection between a boy and his father. The Movie's trappings were incidental. The storyline is not new, but M. brought to the fore what easily happens in many relationships of this nature. I can attest to this. My father and I never talked about anything meaningful. I grew up without any skills to handle the world I live in, but I did not blame him. He himself grew up without a father. I did finally learn the importance of imparting needed skills to cope with this world. My son is autistic, and he always wants to be with me. I fear the future sometimes because eventually he will have to go into this world and make his way.
What I did like was at the most crucial point in this boy's life, his father was right there with him. He could not fight for his son, but he could prepare him, warn him and support him. In this particular story, the father himself is severely wounded, but he was still there, which is another way of saying that despite one's shortcomings and inadequacies, a father can still be of great benefit in the long run. You say I'm reaching? That may be. One mustn't metaphor a movie to greatness, or beat it over the head with them, but that is my take on M's latest accomplishment. There is no such thing as a perfect piece of cinematic fare, and I may not put this movie in my library, but I would see it again, with my son on our next time together. I had to preview the movie to make sure that my son could handle it. I am a bookworm, but I did appreciate the movie's attempt to strike a chord with it's audience.",1383264000,4,1914,4.217983651226158
5771052,1,B00D2ZF24O,"I rarely review anything for Amazon, and have never reviewed a movie before.  I found this movie surpassed even the movie ""Killer Clowns from Outer Space"" to become my new lowest rated film of all time.  It even took the bottom rung in bad movies away from the Bruce Willis's ""Hudson Hawk"" which I was not even able to finish watching in the theater when it was playing, after I paid for it.  I resent the fact that I was suckered into spending my money on this movie by virtue of the reputation of Will Smith; I did not notice ahead of time that the director was M. Night Shyamalan or I would have been more concerned.
 Please to not waste your hard-earned money on this awful movie.  If you want to watch it, do yourself a favor and wait until it is playing for free somewhere so you do not hate yourself for spending money on it.  Jaden Smith can not only not act, I doubt if he could get a part in a high school play somewhere if his father was not a movie star, let alone a movie someone paid to produce, otherwise.  I find it difficult to believe that responsible business people at Sony actually bought in to this thing.
 They have noted a lack of charisma on the part of Jaden Smith.  His father seems to have become a wooden figure in order to play the part in this movie and focus the attention on his child, who he is trying to turn into a surrogate for himself for later productions.  I cannot say strongly enough that, as a long time science fiction buff who has sixty years of reading, films, ""movies"" and such under his belt that this ""movie"" is beyond a disappointment, beyond lame, beyond banal, into an area that I have never seen a production go into.

Jadan Smith isn't a strong enough actor to be the sole person on screen for 75% of the film, and the rest of the characters lackluster and not very well fleshed out.  Inconsistent accents were distracting, and the ending was completely predictable even though it didn't follow Shyamalan's usual ""twist"" ending (and hte only reason it took me until 1/3 of the way into the movie to know how it would end was because I kept trying to think of what the ""twist"" would be for that first third.)

5771062,3,B00D2ZF24O,"First, I was expecting this to be terrible based on the reviews when it came out, but it hardly deserves the negative press it got.  The obvious question is, how good or bad is Jaden Smith?  My take is that he's bad at the beginning when he's doing a voiceover and when he's portraying a cocky recruit trying to make it to Ranger status.  He just doesn't have any charisma or believability in that mode - at least in this movie.

But in the latter 2/3 when he's the scared kid who needs his dad, I think he's actually really good, if not great.  He's not old enough to just go it alone, but he's old enough to accomplish a lot and I think he portrays his fear and vulnerability very effectively.

Will Smith, on the other hand, shows the charisma of a huge movie star, and it's nice to see him taking a very different tone with this role.  He's a strict military father, and I feel he does a good job with it.

The overall premise is decent, the special effects are very good, and though the outcome is predictable it's mostly worthwhile.  Now, the arc of Jaden's acting takes a nosedive (a bit, anyway) at the end when he...I'll try not to spoil it, but really this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone...when he reaches his desired Zen-like state while battling the big monster.  It comes too quick and doesn't necessarily feel ""earned"", but then again we all knew it was coming.

This is a decent sci-fi flick and worth a rental at the very least.  Go in with moderate expectations and I think most people will be satisfied unless you're very picky.  But I love blockbuster scifi and I generally cut films like this some slack if the overall spectacle is good enough, and this one is.  If we're picking plots apart, this one is no more trite or ridiculous than Avatar.",1383091200,,1768,4.383435582822086

I really enjoyed watching this movie about a boy and father who lost their sister/daughter in a previous war and how he is overcoming his own fears and feelings of inadequacies.  As well as the father coming to terms with the fact that he's been an excellent military man but an otherwise very distant and disconnected father.

If I taught film I'd show this every semester and have the students rip it to shreds over and over, backdated to the begining of time.

In the future we can't mask our smell and defeat blind aliens. This film lost me at hello. We use hand to hand combat to defeat Starship Trooper aliens? This film robbed Avatar which robbed everything. Plants would die if they froze every night? This film robbed the Batman and Robin utility belt/jumping the shark concept and took it to a new low.

I think to even mention this film or approach it in any rational way only adds to the likelihood that someone might think is has some merit. It has zero merit and it's all rooted in the bad writing.

This film is AWFUL. One of the worst in a long time.

I'm not wasting too many words on this.

After Earth with Will Smith and his son was one of the most awful films I've seen in a long time. The idea of a science fiction film with a father and son stranded on a hostile world is a great idea. It's gold in 2013, especially with the current level of filmmaking sophistication and special effects at any writers & directors disposal. You'd have to be 4 years old to mess up such a simply great idea and even then a 4 year old would likely do much better.

Somehow M Night Shyamalan managed to implode this up beyond all wildest imagination. It was so bad I'm almost considering the possibility that he might just be intentionally thumbing his nose at Hollywood in some ironic way. I can't imagine any other reason this film could be cobbled together so poorly and with such little regard for logic, common sense, and science.

All the film needed to do was have the two wake up on the hostile world and survive danger. If they wanted the plot point of the military father who finally comes to appreciate his son as a person, not a cadet, they could have added that in too. Just staying alive till help arrived could have been enough. And steer clear of Avatar type scenarios so you are not being redundant within recent film history. Almost any 2 people 2-3 days locked in a hotel room would have yielded a decent story. Any hack screenwriter could have then produced something of minor merit.

This film is so far from mediocre and buried beneath 40 miles of waste that it is incredible it even exists.

Then they add these insane plot points like a super futuristic ship crashes and only has 2 distress beacons that don't auto fire. No signal is sent out before, or during the crash?

This film plays out like an old episode of batman where they have exactly what they need in their medical-pack. Then it breaks.

This film makes me think they made it this bad on purpose. This is no other explanation.",1382918400,22,2771,4.359223300970874

While I didn't like his performance in Karate Kid, I thought he did a good job here.  Will Smith was great in my opinion.

Well, I can tell you that not only did Jaden Smith prove his acting mettle (I state this in vehement opposition to reviews to the contrary), he also gets credit for being in a movie that manages to put a new spin on a 'fate o' the world genre' story.

Will Smith (as usual) delivered a fine performance as Jaden's stiff but loving father, but the spotlight shines squarely upon the shoulders of his son.  There was not a single moment of boredom during the film and honestly, the only ""unbelievable"" portion was the behavior of one of the birds of prey in the film.

5771134,1,B00D2ZF24O,"Being a Sci-Fi fan and an even bigger Will Smith fan I thought that this movie would be stellar. Unfortunately, I've never been more wrong about anything in my life.

Will Smith's acting was so sub-par that he would have done a better job of acting if he was to have talked in his sleep. I understand that he was supposed to be the ""original ghost"" who could control his fear/emotions in order to be invisible to ""the enemy"" but that same emotionless demeanor extended to his entire performance and completely destroyed any chance to salvage the character and make him appear to be more human. I can only describe his acting as mechanical and uninteresting.

Jaden Smith's performance puts a lie to the old saying that the nut doesn't fall far from the tree. I don't know what Jaden did to prepare for this role but it is obvious that whatever he did didn't work. From his ""acting"" I can only presume that Jaden only got this role because his father insisted on his son playing opposite of him or that any other actors who auditioned for the role was even worse than Jaden. Maybe tanking in this role will be a hidden blessing for Jaden. He'll either have to work very hard to improve his acting or he will realise that he lacks real talent and will persue other interests.

While the acting was very lackluster the FX were not too bad. If the story line had been better developed this movie, combined with the FX, would have been much better.

Overall, I wish that this movie would have come with a money back guarantee. But, since I already purchased and watched this DVD and can't return it, I'll add this to my collection and only show it when I want to punish my grandchildren or others.

To call this movie a ""dud"" would be insulting to other ""dud"" movies.",1382486400,3,1762,4.459627329192546

5771147,4,B00D2ZF24O,"This movie has been out long enough and there are enough online reviews that will give those who haven't yet seen it a basic synopsis, so I won't rehash the plot.  What I want to do is explain, in my humble opinion, why I believe this movie deserves at least 4 stars.  Also, I think some may be missing the point of the movie...

First, is the overriding message of the movie which has nothing to do with space travel, creatures which have evolved to kill humans or trying to prove something to one's dad (lol).  The overriding message of this movie is understanding one's fear and through that understanding learning how to control it which is an excellent message for anyone... especially adolescence.  I think because of who's in it (name recognition) the movie catered to a specific demographic (adolescent boys or young men) who are usually in a 'fearless' stage of their lives and who don't understand the spiritual concept of fear.  Though I wished the scripting/dialog for Will Smith's character had done a bit more to explain what fear is, it at least did a good enough job that the average young person and adult could understand and resonate with it IF they were paying attention.  The concept of controlling one's fear in the beginning of the movie dragged a bit and seemed clich and shallow, but towards the middle and the end it really popped.  While watching this movie I found myself reflecting on my own fears, thinking about how I choose to explain fear to my child and feeling a deep communion with the two main characters of this movie.  For a futuristic, drama laden, action adventure movie to have that kind of impact on me makes me sit up and take notice!

Second, the father/son dynamic is very good here.  Perhaps that's because Will and Jaden Smith are actually father and son and have a healthy relationship?  I don't know, but it came through in spades.  Their chemistry was poignant and there were times when I could envision the two of them sitting at the dinner table interacting with each other similarly to how they portrayed their relationship on film.  I enjoyed that because I don't often see the same chemistry in other father/son dynamics on the big screen or on TV.  That aspect of the movie worked for me.

Third, when was the last time you saw an African American father and son have any kind of positive, normal, familial dynamics at the movies?  Can't think of it, huh?  That's because it practically doesn't exist (lol)!  Usually, most African American family portrayals at the movies or on television are full of exaggerated buffoonery or they are so stereotypically negative and base that most viewers would think that Black Americans have no normal, positive, familial dynamics... especially fathers and sons.  This film shows a convincing and real contrast to what is usually thrown up in the average American's face about Black American families and that should only be viewed as a good thing!

This movie moved me for the above reasons.  Yes, I do think the acting was a bit off (lol) and the beginning of the movie could have been a bit fuller, but overall I think the cast and crew of ""After Earth"" did a mighty fine job of putting together a thoughtful, action packed and well-grounded movie that, if reflected on, should not only keep the audience on the edge of their seats but make them think about the concept of fear being the wrong kind of motivator in theirs and possibly their children's lives.

M.Night Shyamalan, who helped direct and produce this movie along with Will and Jada Smith, is one of my favorite directors and storytellers.  If you notice... again, if you're paying attention, all of his movies have one overriding concept in them:  understanding your fears and learning how to control them.

Ya gotta think, people... don't let it go over your heads!  There's a good message here.

Well done... 4 stars!!",1382400000,2,3880,4.716617210682492

I would go into the plot but I'm afraid my description would make it sound like a much better movie than it is and might entice you to pay someone to see it.

Part of growing up is learning how to handle adversity. This is a story of two extremes, the father who has controlled his feelings and been made a great figure in his society by doing so and his son who feels everything including judgement for being so emotive when all he wants is his father's acceptance and most of all love. This movie plays on the stereotype of what a man should be and how our society promotes the ""story"" that a man is weak for showing emotion.

The story was consistent and well thought out.  The only part I thought was a bit distracting was their choice of accents.  It was interesting to see Will in a more serious role as a hard nosed military commander.  Usually he plays a more light hearted character that breaks things up with some humor every now and again, but this time he stays in character throughout.  It makes for a much more stressful situation between father and son characters that is consistent with the story, even as it contrasts with their real life.

5771167,3,B00D2ZF24O,"I enjoyed the movie, though it wasn't worth $4.99. The premise was interesting but there were serious problems with the science.
I'll try not to give away too much of the plot.

First there was the idea of the asteroid storm. I understand the idea that the space ship's drive deformed the fabric of space and could disturb local objects such as asteroids. However, it seems unlikely that the mass of the ship would cause a deep enough gravity well to cause a cloud of asteroids to smash into the ship.  It reminded me of an old Flash Gordon episode, though the special effects were much better.

Second, the idea that 1000 years had passed since humanity had left earth seems far too short a period of time for the evolution and spread of the diverse life forms portrayed. Here again, the CGI is good.

As for the acting: Jaden Smith did an excellent job with the physical aspects of his performance. However, he needs to mature a bit so that he can bring a richer emotional range to his characters. A good start.

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors but in this movie I got the impression at times that he was phoning it in.

To be fair, the characters that Will and Jaden portray are emotionally walled off and perhaps their performances were shaped by the script and director. If so, then they should have been allowed to express themselves more.",1382400000,3,1353,4.502040816326531

5771177,2,B00D2ZF24O,"I enjoy a lot of B movies and those such movies usually present horrible acting and highly contrived plot lines.  They are, however, usually quite entertaining.

I feel badly for writing a negative review because the main character is played by a child actor.  However, Young Mr. Smith is really lacking in the acting department.  He has no screen presence.  I believe he attempted to implement a neo-Earth accent, but he sounded instead as if he had a speech impediment. It is a shame that his talented father feels the need to showcase this child simply because he is his son.

The plot was the reheated leftovers of many a previous film and did not hold my attention whatsoever.  I would not suggest spending a dime on this rental, as I assume it will be streaming for free soon enough.",1382313600,,789,4.5928571428571425

No, its not a great movie, but it was good and I enjoyed it. If Will committed any sin, it was loving his son like any parent would and giving him a hand up because he CAN. Most of us would do the same thing in his situation. It was NOT a terrible movie. No, it wasn't a stunning scifi production either, though the art direction was really great. Will made one mistake, and that was writing the movie himself. I'm 64 and have seen alot of stars become really successful and make the mistake of thinking if they get worldy acclaim for their acting, this qualifies them to write their own material. Very few ever successfully pull this idea off, and the plot in this flick just wasn't very dimensional.

I can tell that Will believes in the idea of you ""create your own reality."" The key thing I took away from this movie was the statement that ""fear is not real, most of us living in fear of ideas and events that almost never happen."" This is an important idea and was well stated in the story. But Will's 2nd mistake, is that while yes you do create your own reality, you cannot create a reality for someone else, and this is what almost every parent tries to do; it didn't work on me or anyone I know. You can't buy talent for your son, you can't buy movie stardom for your kid, no matter how much you love him. Take away Will and where would Jaden be? Jaden will eventually rebel and find his own path, I'm sure.  The movie?

Jayden Smith cannot act.

He has absolutely no discernible talent; not even a crumb. Watching him on screen is torture. The Karate Kid was bad enough, but he was so young, I decided to give him another shot. Bad choice. Will Smith had to dumb down his acting 'skills' to make his kid look 'good', but in doing so, he created one of the most boring, one-note, totally contrived characters that has ever graced the silver screen. Whatever happened to the Fresh Prince? Now he's old news.

Here's a word of advice to Will: Be honest to your damn kid...tell him he sucks, and maybe he can find something that he is actually good at. You filled that kid's head up with nonsense, and now he's an unstoppable juggernaut: churning crap movies out at lightning speed.

Ugh.

I'm not even going to touch on the stupid pseudo-science in the movie because I will go on forever.

DO NOT PAY MONEY TO WATCH THIS. After all, you'll just be supporting the weirdo devotees of L. Ron Hubbard's made-up 'religion'. Why, Will? WHY DID YOU TURN TO SCIENTOLOGY?? Everything you've made after that thorough brainwashing has been total S***!!!",1382227200,4,1247,4.52

The plot was very unique and original--in the sense that the aliens can neither hear nor see their prey but instead smells the fear from their bodies. I really wish people would give this movie a chance because it is a good solid post-apocalyptic movie. I did not see a lot of asian influences like in other future movies, well except for the chopsticks.

5771207,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I enjoyed watching the movie ""After Earth.""  It was a different ""style"" of Will Smith movie..., which is a good thing.  Will Smith was excellent in the role.  He played a loving father who knew in order to save his son and his own life he had to let go of the emotional ""father role"" and become his son's commander and teacher.  The special effects where top notch and both Will Smith and his son did excellent acting in the movie.  I do hope there is a sequel where Will Smith is more involved in some of the action scenes.  Unfortunately, many moviegoers rated this movie low on the ratings scale.  Anyone who did not like this movie needs to ask him or herself why?  Was it too educational for you?  It seems to bother moviegoers (even African Americans) whenever black actors drop the ""colored-folk"" stereotypes and step into a different genre of acting. I say, why should Will Smith mold himself into a stereotypical actor...speaking the same old dialogue and phonical diction that most movie goers hear from black actors.  ""Oh, no, yawl, not gonna..."" etc, etc.  Movie audiences love films like ""This is the End"" where producers show a bunch of bodies spewing blood all over the place and clog every scene of the film with curse words.  If people were truly honest with themselves they would ask, Why are there so many gory, horror movies?  Why do our society gravitate toward films filled with sadomasochistic sex against men, women and children?  I know it is a reflection of what is happening in our society.  Maybe, just maybe ""After Earth"" is not just a movie to entertain us, but to educate us how the earth may one day become...if we do not change.",1382140800,,1661,4.583050847457627

5771219,1,B00D2ZF24O,"What can you expect from M.  Night? He thinks of his movies as a Work of Art. While Movies are an Art MEDIUM, they are not a single painting. One can convey a single idea in a single painting with emphasis and impact and it will work. It is a tiny window into a single milisecond of time and space. A movie, however, is not a single milisecond. It is a panorama that flows through time to convey an idea. Night will focus on a single idea he wants to convey with impact----and then ignore logic and intellect and simple common sense for an entire 2 hours.

I agree with what everyone else has said previously but there is something else that bothered me much more in this horrible movie beyond the terrible acting and swords. We are expected to believe that we destroyed Earth and had to move to another, more inhabitable planet in the galaxy. That's a fine premise, and makes sense. However, now, 1,000 years later, we have 2 characters crash land on a perfectly good Earth. There's nothing wrong with it. We're expected to believe that there's not enough oxygen on a planet that is covered in trees, and still rife with native wildlife. We're expected to believe that on a planet with blue skies, clouds and an ocean teaming with life, Humans Cannot Live. But we can live on an alien world where we have to fight alien predators constantly sent to kill off our invasion? Everything on this new earth is bright and clean and we live simply and in harmony with nature....but we humans can't go back to an Earthly Paradise and survive for 10 minutes with having to take medication packs to save us from the atmosphere--an atmosphere That is fine for baboons and massive flocks of birds and lions and whales...but will kill us. We can't go back to earth and repopulate and live in harmony there with nature--perhaps because lions and baboons are more dangerous than alien creatures specifically bred to kill us off? We cannot re-adapt to the gravity, but our closest relative, the monkey, seems to be surviving just fine.

The complete illogic of this one idea of the movie, which the director continuously tries to shove down our throats, is then hammered home when a character can climb a volcanic mountain that is covered in lava and ash that would Kill a Human in minutes--without even sweating. We can't survive on a Paradise Earth covered in Oxygen generating trees, but we can not only climb a volcano and live, we can fight off an alien creature at the top of that mountain....with gusto.

If the Earth of this movie had been shown as a wasteland a thousand years after our departure, the movie would have made sense. This makes no sense at all. Like every other M.Night movie.

On the weak side are misunderstandings of basic science and poor marketing.  On the strong side is a director, cast and crew willing to take the risk of minimizing Will Smith's role in order to track development of the character Kitai. That's the point--developing independent character, and I think the film succeeds in doing this reasonably well.

Basic understanding of biology seems to be thrown out the door on that.  While I don't think the acting of Will Smith's Son was as bad as some reviews said, I did feel like the writing for his Will's made his character so robotic as to be unbelievable.

Jaden Smith didn't really seem up to the task to be the primary role in this film which was kind of surprising given his pedigree and how well he did in Karate Kid.

As other have stated, the basis of the story was pretty weak sauce. Did liberals ban all advanced weaponry or what? Lol. I don't want to give the story away so I won't give anymore details about that.  Will Smith is in over his head as a sci-fi writer. M. Night Shyamalan actually did OK this time around given his ability to make his next movie worse than the previous one.

Frankly I do not understand why people hate this movie unless it is pure jealousy based on the director or actors, who by the way did a great job. I saw a coming of age story about a young man who was traumatized as a kid, an absentee dad(no matter the reason)and a chance for them to not only find themselves but also find each other. The story is set in a post apocalyptic future (so what?) it doesn't make the story less poignant or interesting.

Jaden Smith may be getting roles that many feel are being given him based on who his father is, Drew Barrymore got roles cause she was a product of an acting dynasty, and many other young stars today have famous parents you just don't know it because they use different last names, yet you people don't dismiss them out-of-hand. Jaden is a good actor and so is his father. The baldwins, the sheens and many other acting families have done the same for their children, yet where is the peanut gallery. The truth is some of them could not act their way out of a paper bag yet they get accolades for mediocre work.

You guys have to remember that the acting in most science fiction is cheese almost by definition. You have to overact a bit to sell a fantastic plot.

The world they created was pretty cool, right down to graviton-based faster than light travel, but the technology could have used a little more thought. Why we can't grow people a new leg ten centuries from now I have no idea. Neither am I sure why we would use a glorified spear as our only means of self defense. Perhaps there are explanations for those things but on the surface, they just look like holes in the backstory.

This is a brilliant comedy on all levels only problem is that it's not a comedy.  Here's the deal:  If you have a sense of humor there are so many things in this piece of excrement sci-fi movie that will make you laugh your giant vulture hawk beast beak off it's just not possible to not see this movie.  Gotta suspend that disbelief because there's a lot of stuff you won't believe in this vehicle for will smith's son that he doesn't want to be in, err I mean ""movie"".

Let me list them off:
Securing a dangerous man eating beast with cloth.
A Manta shaped space ship that can travel at lightspeed but can't handle earth's gravity.
Lions that climb trees to get to food that can't possibly sustain them.
Primitive cave paintings where no humans exist.
Zombie dead sister hallucination.
Giant beast bred to kill humans by aliens (you'll never see) who can only smell your fear.
Advanced human warriors that have mastered space travel but decide not to wear armor to battle said beasts including something that could mask their pheromones; they also don't have prosthetics or robot appendages despite the fact they have a pocket x-ray system and self-surgery capabilities.
Will Smith with a really bad accent and looking uninterested.
Will Smith's kid with a really bad voice (for a movie, no joke) and looking very disinterested in being in this ""movie"".
Space seatbelts!
Magic adjustable space spears used for killing the alien beasts instead of just having a gun.

It's just ridiculous.  Must watch.  This is the most complete mock-masterpiece of B style sci-fi I've ever seen.  No space boobies though.",1381881600,,1716,4.77027027027027

5771267,2,B00D2ZF24O,"Will Smith is one of my favorite actors.  He consistently makes me laugh, and sometimes (The Pursuit of Happyness) makes me cry.  I wanted to cry for a whole different reason with this movie.

Smith seemed to be trying to channel Lawrence Fishburne's character in ""The Matrix"" throughout the entire movie.  It was like he couldn't relate to the character well enough, and was therefore ACTING with all the Master Thesbian intonation that word should have in this case.

Smith's movies are good because of the humor he injects into them.  No matter how serious they are, a bit of him shines through.  None of that was present in this movie, and I realize the character was supposed to be very serious and cold, but then it should have been played by someone else.  It's not a part I enjoyed seeing Smith in, and I don't think it played to his strengths as an actor.

As for Jaden, I love that kid.  I think he has real potential, and isn't just riding on the fact that he's ""Will and Jada's kid."" For most of this movie though, you wouldn't have known it.  Maybe I just don't believe him as the scared, wimpy little kid.  He's been too strong in other parts for me to see this as him.  It wasn't until the end, where his character toughened up, that I believed him as the character.

I won't even get into the plot holes, of which there were many.  The plot was one big hole, actually. Which is too bad because the premise was interesting and could have made a good movie.

There was one part of the movie that I liked, and it came at the very end.  It was, I think, Jaden's final line in the movie.  It showed that seriousness wrapped in humor that I've come to associate with Smith's movies, and Jaden delivered the line perfectly.  I don't want to ""spoil"" the ending, so I won't say what it was, but I think if you watch the movie I think you'll know it.

Do I recommend this movie?  No.  Not at all.  It's a waste of time.  Still, I have seen all of Smith's other movies (I think) so I saw this one.  I wouldn't watch it again, and I hope there is never a sequel (it doesn't lend itself to one).",1381881600,,2098,4.250632911392405
5771268,3,B00D2ZF24O,Good movie if you have nothing to do and want to watch a movie. Glad I did not pay for it at the theater. Jaden Smith looks even younger than he is. I found it difficult to take his role seriously and his acting left a little to be desired but afterall he is young and learning. Storyline predictable. It was all about Jaden getting his feet wet and experienced to follow in his father's foot steps both on and off screen.,1381881600,,422,4.158536585365853

The last movie I saw him in was probably that Karate Kid remake and he at least sounded like he was speaking naturally.  In After Earth, he seems to be trying to manufacture a ""black accent"" that just doesn't fit.  Maybe he's been learning from his homeboy Justin Bieber, but sorry Jaden, Bieber sounds more black than you.

5771272,1,B00D2ZF24O,"This is a review I wrote of this movie some time ago to save my friends from seeing it. I say at the outset there are spoilers and I've done my best to remove all the swearing:
If you don't want to read through a long review this is my advice, this is a movie by the numbers if you are able to tune out and enjoy an hour and 40 minutes of a theme not carried out well and no attempt at making art this movie will be okay for you.
Anyway here's my review of this movie: Well, this one is not bad folks but it sure as hell ain't good. They did not even try, they did not even make an attempt to make art or push the boundaries of the genre at any level. This isn't even a scifi film, nor a drama of a parent and son trying to connect...It's just grey, nothing there. The script is pretty bad, long stretches without any meaningful dialogue to drive through character development. It's as if they had a check list to make this film- trite use of dead relative to serve as spirit guide- check, ship goes off course and winds up in dangerous area- check, son must save father but father must impart wisdom to be saved- check, and both must overcome a haunting memory- check.
90% of the film Will Smith is either issuing a command, marveling at how his son is doing everything wrong, or having a fainting spell. I'm serious, the guy must pass out 4 to 6 times in this movie. I think Will Smith can act in certain roles- he's good at yelling and twisting his face up to deliver a laugh, but he just can't convey a reticent father trying to connect with his son. As such most of the movie he comes off as a fellow who could care less whether the kid lives or dies...and well, you don't like him much. That's an overstatement, with this script you don't care to like or dislike him. The son is pressed for time to save his father but really seems like he too could care less. Seriously this dude takes naps, goes on a Huck Finn voyage, and befriends a giant hawk all on the way to save his dad. Yeah, they contrived him befriending a giant hawk so in the third act the bird could save him. They anthropomorphize a giant hawk...sigh.
Anyway, after screw up after screw up, the son is like I'll get on with saving Poppa...and at this point, I could care less; however, I've paid for my ticket, popcorn, a big lemonade, and I'll take my lumps like a man. The kid then goes on to fight some amalgum beast you've seen in a ton of films...sigh...And I gotta say it, after seeing this kid through the 2/3rds of the film you know there is no way he is ready for this. He should die. He deserves to die. Seriously, both of them deserve to die, but he wins and I'm devastated.
During the last scene, the director just looses it, looses it completely. He doesn't know how to frame a scene at all. Extras in the film are supposed to be marveling at what this kid who screwed up for 2/3rds of the film just pulled off but the director fails to catch the screen of what they are seeing and the looks on their faces while they look at him. It doesn't matter no one would believe it anyway. Will lies on a medic table possibly dying (framed like 100's of films before- like every 4th episode of Greys Anatomy) and again, I found myself not caring. And well they put a big bow on it and a laugh to end the film (they use a call back to an interlude with a soldier from earlier in the film and well it was expected). Really, it's that bad.
So the film ends and I am rooted to my seat. No, I am not watching it hoping for an easter egg bonus scene as it closes, no I want to see who is responsible for this garbage....M. Night Shyamalan as director. Ahhh god, I should have known. This fellow seems to have gone out of his way to direct films as badly as possible. He is now well know amongst movie goers as the fellow that seemed to have such promise then urinated on movie fans, over and over. Then I see the script was written by, you guessed it M Night Shyamalan and this was a surprise, seems to be the extended family of Will Smith. Everybody wanted to write a line. Given that there was so little dialogue this is entirely possible.
What's sad is they could have done something here. They could have taken the 'fear' theme and fleshed it out, but they didn't; in fact that ""Fear is a choice, danger is real,"" is unfortunately the best line in the entire film. They had a unique view point on fear and did not explore it- that fear marker was an interesting twist. They could have tried to make a visual masterpiece and hired a cinematographer that would have embedded every scene with mood, but they didn't. And they could have worked on developing a father and son relationship but they didn't. This was just grey because they didn't try on any level. I had no idea this was directed or written by M. Night Shyamalan. He got me this time but I'll be more careful the next time.",1381795200,,4857,4.17910447761194

5771277,4,B00D2ZF24O,"Well done.  Nice to see a science fiction movie with some values emphasizing more than just special effects and graphic violence/gore. A survival tale with a bonding of father and son in a tale emphasizing courage, endurance and the valor of a child. The only thing really missing for me is the modern movie aversion to mentioning ""faith' and spiritual values. Heaven forbid using the word ""God"". It's as if script writers have tried to marginalize their significance. Throughout history (and even today)faith in God or a Supreme Being has often led to many acts of bravery. The overemphasis on science and technology, in this movie places the responsibility for the elimination of fear(in this case the 'pheromones"" produced by fear) solely on man's ego and reason. A reading of history shows that man's use and sole reliance on reason has often led to some pretty absurd and disturbing things (e.g. the world is flat, the sun revolves around the world, etc. etc. etc.).

5771297,2,B00D2ZF24O,"I really wanted the reviews of the movie to just be hype from people that wanted to hate the movie for their own petty reasons, but they were right, it is nigh unwatchable.

The issues start almost as soon as the movie does, the accent (I hope it was an accent) that Jaden Smith was using made him sound like a young child that is still working on their pronunciation.  It may be cute from a 4 year old, but for a supposed professional actor I think not.

There are also more plot holes than the wrecked spaceship ended up with, such as....
1. Even though seats on the ship were full on take off, they were completely empty except for the young Smith during the crash, where were these people and why weren't they strapped into what ended up being the safest part of the ship?
2. Our decendants obviously master spaceflight but have lost the ability to use projectile weapons.  Not a single ranged weapon to be seen anywhere, and oh wouldn't it have been fantastic to have a rifle or two in the emergency kits.
3. Did I say kits?  I'm wondering why there weren't more than one set of breathing aids available for the young Smith to take with him on his journey, and why not take one of the masks that seemed to work so wonderfully before the breathing aids were introduced.  Oddly enough though the breathing aids were all over the wrecked tail section of the craft.

There were many many more issues with the story, but I don't believe that anyone needs to dig very deep to see that this is a horribly flawed production that would have done better with different actors, a different writer, and almost any other director.  I hate to pick on the movie because I was actually looking forward to it, though if I had noticed that it was one of M.

I really liked the more serious role for Will Smith, and the film was particularly good because Jaden Smith played his son. The authenticity of the father-son relationship really came through.

I spent most of the movie thinking about all that was technically wrong with it (there are numerous examples - and this is random - 7 hour flight and the passengers sit in chairs up against a wall that don't recline, no inflight entertainment, they just sit and stare at the opposite wall).  But then I realized that there wasn't a likable character (although there really aren't any other than Will and Jaden after the first 15 minutes or so except for occasional flash backs) so even if the technical problems didn't exist it still would have been bad.

Jaden's character (the main character and the one you're supposed to be rooting for) is a mess.  Yearns to be a Ranger like his officer father but can't follow orders, lies, acts impulsively, and apparently has no technical education.  But none of those are portrayed as character flaws - just a boy trying to prove himself to his father.

Hmmm...  I guess I could go on but most everything has been said in other reviews..  So to recap this and those;

Cons
Bad Acting
Unlikeable characters
Technically flawed

Pros
Decent special effects/CGI
Good cinema photography

5771323,3,B00D2ZF24O,"Remove the knowledge from your brain that M. Night Shyamalan (who's career has sadly been on a major downward spiral the past decade) directed this film and view it with an open mind.  Though ""After Earth"" is not one of the best Sci Fi films I've ever seen or have even seen recently, it's entertaining enough for a Saturday night viewing.  I've seen a lot of folks lambast Will Smith here in the reviews for supposedly ""promoting"" his son Jayden, etc.  I don't see it that way.  I think there was a story to be told here with a boy at the heart of the story and the role just happened to be filled by Jayden Smith.  I personally think Jayden did a serviceable enough job and I don't have any issues with his real life dad playing his on screen dad.  I think it was a good fit.

What took me out of the movie though were some poor choices that really didn't make sense (spoilers ahead) The most obvious one was the ridiculous and pointless Southern accents.  There really wasn't any explanation at all as to why the characters even had Southern accents, let alone the fact that they really, REALLY couldn't pull them off convincingly.  It was more like listening to a parody of a southern accent.  I was also put off a little by Will's hard a$$ father character.  Yeah, yeah-I know it makes sense to have a stern father that can be made to respect the son by the son proving himself, but his portrayal of this character went beyond just stern (or fearless) into robot territory.  Showing a little humanity might've helped a person actually like the character more instead of thinking he's a complete jerk 99% of the movie.  Also-and this is probably my biggest gripe, you set up a story with the whole theme to be a son proving his worth as a man in his father's eyes, then when it's all said and done and the son has at last proven himself worthy, you go and throw it all away with one line. ""I think I'd rather work with mom"".  It sounds like a petty gripe in the scheme of things and the line does earn a laugh but everything the boy been through, everything he's done to earn his stripes is thrown right out the window.  It just makes the whole adventure seem suddenly pointless.

I think folks have been a little harsh in their criticisms of After Earth as it truly does have some merit.  It's beautifully shot, it tells a compelling story, the special effects (for the most part) are pretty convincing and it's fairly unique.  I just think a few poor choices soured an otherwise entertaining experience.  I doubt the film would've earned such hatred if M. Night would've ghost directed this film under a different name.  Granted he's earned some of that animosity, but on it's own merits-the direction of After Earth is just fine.",1381708800,,2736,4.4448897795591185

Trust me, if you have not had cable for as long as I had, you would have loved it/enjoyed as well as I did since I simply choose this movie by my own will not by multimedia commercials/trailers/etc fueling developing expectations like cable tv does nowadays.  Some of the reviews I breezed through looks falsified, I know the Tea Party Does that, they admitted that in a hidden camera through some training program.  So we know it happens one way or another.  I also noticed how apparent it seems that people already have preconceived notions about the movie before he/she seen it.  Anyways, all these lies etc. will surmount to discrediting the entire rating system because of many liars and underdeveloped characters.

A lot of sci-fi these days are so action centered that they forget the personal aspects of the movie.  I actually enjoyed this movie more than I enjoyed Iron Man III, and I really like Robert Downy Junior's work.  The story centers on a father/son relationship, as well as a family relationship, in a military household.  And of course there is the whole Sci-Fi aspect with monster's, advanced tech and some pretty good CGI graphic scenes.  I do have a military background, mom was a Navy brat, and my Uncle and I were in the Marines; so maybe I understand it better?  Honestly though, I think that some of the criticism of the movie is shallow.  My hat is off to Will Smith and Jaden Smith for a job well done.",1381622400,3,822,4.433333333333334

I have 3 TVs mounted in my bedroom :) Anyhow, I watched the whole movie so it wouldn't be a waste of money. Will Smith's character was such an SOB I hated him right off the bat. And as far as Will's son goes, I haven't found a single thing I like about him. There is nothing about him that stands out more than any other actor. As far as After Earth goes, nothing special about the movie at all.

5771344,5,B00D2ZF24O,"We were fascinated to see Will Smith play a completely different kind of character and he totally pulled it off. At first I was amazed to read some of the criticism but I think it comes from those expecting his typical humor. Once you accept him in this new serious kind of role and let go of the MIB type character, you can appreciate the movie's intent. Jadan does a great job playing his intended character as well.
Concerning complaints of nepotism; so what if Will Smith gives his son opportunities to hone his craft? Do people really expect a father to not cast his son in a role because his is his son?
I don't know why this movie is getting a bad rap. M. Shamalyn has made some of our favorite movies, we enjoyed this one and will continue to look forward to any that he directs.
My honest rating for this one is closer to 3.5 but felt the need to try to offset the misguidedly low ratings. If you are willing to forego the typical will smith sci-fi character and just watch it for what it is, you will enjoy it.",1381536000,4,1020,4.235897435897436
5771345,2,B00D2ZF24O,"After Earth is science fiction action adventure film directed by M. Night Shyamalan about a military father (Will Smith) and his teenage son (Jadon Smith) crash land on Earth one thousand years after cataclysmic events forced humanity to abandon Earth for a new home planet. The son must save his dying father and himself by trekking alone across hostile terrain pursued by evolved predators and an alien beast to recover a rescue-beacon.

After hearing about all the bad reviews and this movie tanking at the theater, I didn't have high expectations of this movie. With that being said, this movie was better than I expected, which isn't saying a lot as I still think the movie was not that great.

The movie was slow and dull and moved along like a duck stuck in the mud. The action was sparing and mostly dumb with a giant eagle and some animals that looked like they belonged in the zoo as opposed to being some villainous animals. Even the Usar or whatever they called it was a poorly conceived computer generated creature. There are no weapons or suits that could defend against this creature?? Seriously?? Add on some nonsensical weather just to top it off as well that is never explained and an alien war that is also left unexplained.

The acting was some of the worst I have seen from not only Jaden Smith (which I expected) but also Will Smith which surprises me. I normally like most of Will Smith's movies with ""I am Legend"" being one of my favorites but it almost seemed that Will Smith was trying to find his inner Laurence Fishbourne slash Matrix impression with his monotone lack of emotion almost reading of his lines acting. But his acting wasn't as bad as his son's who was not believable in the role and surprisingly enough had no chemistry with his own father in the movie. I can understand that Will Smith was trying to promote his son's acting career but Please please please, Mr. Smith do not do any more movies that include you and your son. Jaden Smith is not ready for prime time as a main character and should try perfecting his craft in smaller roles outside of his father's limelight and this movie idea brought to life by M Night was not a way to do it.

The positives about the movie is that the scenery in the movie was pretty and had nice scenic locations and the special effects were decent with the exception of the poorly conceived monster. And I get the message that the movie was trying to send in the father son relationship which accounts for 2 stars as opposed to one. But by the time the movie ended, I didn't care about the characters as they were poorly developed and lacked any emotion. Nor did I care what happened at the conclusion by the time I got to the end.

A shame though as this could have had a lot of potential but M. Night and Smith blew it on this one. Do yourself a favor and pay attention to the bad reviews, you may wish you had.",1381536000,,2892,4.449056603773585

5771349,1,B00D2ZF24O,"Sci-fi to me is like bacon or chocolate.  There really is no such thing as too much and none of it is ever bad no matter what the quality.  So while I wasn't expecting any deep reflections, aha moments or outstanding effects I was, at least, expecting to see the ruins of old earth, since that's so easy to do with CGI, and the story of how that happened.  And while the McGuffin device has been used very effectively by Hitchcock to produce fear and in Melville to produce excitement in After Earth it just sucked.  It's basically a Mcguffin flick if flicks could be made by a Vanity Press Director.  And just in case no one got it's a journey movie, this film is so bad that it actually pictured in one scene and mentioned in another the great novel Moby Dick, without any connection to the action, plot or back story at all.  But as a device it was lost on this garbage film.  No one was hunting anything but someone probably thought it deep to have that there.  The freshman film students would get it.  No one else woud.
I judge film the same way I do art.  Like the blue slash on the white canvass that adorned the entrance to the Freer in DC 40 years ago on the day I ended a 7 year relationship by disclosing how little I appreciated the artistic musings of the great painter who decided to dip his brush in blue paint and draw a horizontal line.  I apparently couldn't appreciate all kinds of meaning and depth because the painter was important, prominent, historic, etc. but all I saw was a blue slash.  If I can do it it's not art.  This movie is like that.  It has the pedigree of Will Smith but no substance.  In fact I found myself wandering to the sink to finish the dishes hoping for a reveal of a reborn earth or a cataclysmic discovery that earth had been occupied by aliens or something.  Nope.  A handful of poorly designed not scary monsters attempted and failed to capture Jr even though they were clearly supposed to be superb predators.  Then Jr is saved by a giant eagle from freezing.  Did I mention how bad this movie is?  I suppose they're rescued because in the next to last scene he gets the beacon and sets it off then suddenly he's back on wherever and credits roll.
Note to crappy set designers.  We will still have beds in 3100 AD like we did in 3000 BC.
When Jr starts out in pursuit of the beacon, Daddy/General asks ""What do you feel?""  Jr says ""heavy"" and Daddy/General says ""Good that's gravity.""
I wonder if the audience laughed as hard as I did.  So add crappy script to rotten lazy set design queue the CGI swarming stuff and herding animals and the music swells to reveal a planet that freezes over completely at night in spite of the tropical foliage that covers everything.  And don't forget to throw in a few flash backs to the dead sister (who liked to read Moby Dick) just to create what, depth?  At least she had enough lines to qualify for health insurance.  And while I'm still trying to figure out how Judge Dredd wiped his ass with that clam shell 20 years ago nothing so useful as that seems to have been stowed on this spacecraft.  Except a hideous monster who can smell fear that's to be used in training.  Let's call him Spot.  Spot's demise was never explained as far as I could tell.  Meanwhile Jr. has more important things to do like ignore everything his father says so he gets chased by GCI apes.  Oooh scary.  Judge Dredd is suddenly not the worst sci-fi movie ever made.
Dialogue like ""If you want to die today that is fine but you're not going to kill me.""  Well Daddy, actually if he wants to die you will die so no it's not fine.  In response to getting scratched poor Jr. suddenly  needs to inject something into his heart because what's a good medical emergency clich without that.  Not once but twice.  The $5.99 they can keep but there should be a toll free number where you can call to get your lost time back.",1381536000,4,3883,4.32088520055325
5771350,4,B00D2ZF24O,"Found the movie entertaining and kept my attention throughout.  A couple of good jump scares as well.  Beautiful landscapes and nicely done costumes and storyline.  I came to this movie not expecting anything but a good sci fi tale and that is what I got.  Then I google to read on the making of the movie as I was interested and found all these negative reviews which I do not understand at all.

 My only complaints with the movie are that I wished Will Smith did not take such an unemotional take on  his character, which I believe he did to emphasize his lack of fear but came off seemingly too deadpan.  What was needed was a more hard bitten warrior role and allowance for emoting, lack of fear doesn't mean lack of all the other emotions.  I felt Jaden Smith gave a great performance, you could feel he was really into the role, though  I thought a younger character would have engendered more of an emotional tug for the audience.

Really, the movie wasn't the best out there but compared to recent blockbuster hideousness like Iron Man 3 it was well done.  Shyamalan is still one of  my favorite directors some of whose films I continually go back to view, I love his subtlety in directing.  I can only think a lot of the negative reviews are more based on perceived nepotism and show boating, anti-scientology bias ( I mean seriously, I didn't even see or think religion at all till I read the reviews.. wtf are you all pratting on about there, its just a movie)",1381536000,4,1472,4.4440298507462686

A vehicle that would allow him to pout a lot. And, yet, with all this information I gave my $4.99 to Amazon to rent this movie.

Slow paced. Poor dialogue. Poor special effects (a mutant Earth that will kill you and the best you can come up with are some baboons and a really big overprotective bird?). An alien civilization creating a creature to destroy us, but.., heck, let's make it blind. In fact, if you aren't afraid of the creature it will never find you. Non-existent directing. And, silly character names - Sypher Raige?  The best performance of the movie came from the dead girl (Thanks, Zoe).

It won't be the last time that I rent a bad movie, but..., If you are like me and give a lot of science fiction movies the benefit of the doubt reconsider before you divest yourself to view this one. Go to Starbucks and get a nice cup of coffee with the money. It'll give you more satisfaction over a longer extended period of time than this very awkward movie.",1381536000,2,1124,4.368421052631579
5771354,3,B00D2ZF24O,"I read all the negative reviews about this movie and about Will Smith's son, who stars in the movie with him.  I was prepared for the worst.  And yet....the movie is not terrible.  However, if that assessment sounds like it is lacking in enthusiasm, you are correct.

First, a premise:  It is 1000 years after earth as we know it...due to some global cataclysm.  Will Smith (Cypher) plays a ""ranger"" in this movie, and his 14 year old son (Kitai) wants desperately to also be a ranger, so he can please his tough military like dad.

In the movie, Cypher and Kitai crash land on a planet (Oh what a surprise...it happens to be earth!) and are the only two people left alive on the ship.  Cypher is badly hurt, and can not move.  So it is up to his son to ""man up"" and travel through the treacherous jungles of after earth - jungles that are full of dangerous newly-evolved creatures - to get to the other part of the crashed ship and retrieve the beacon, which will save both of their lives.

Oh, I forgot to add...there is a creature that has escaped it's cage onboard the ship....a creature that has evolved to kill humans,and will track them down due to their ""fear pheromes.""  Evidently, the creature is used to ""train"" rangers, so they can learn to hide their fear (?)

Anyway, Will Smith, the father, guides his son on his jungle journey through technology that allows him to see what the son sees.

Does the son meet his doom in the jungle?  Will he be able to hide his fear and avoid being eaten by the escaped creature? Will the dad survive?  Will the son ever impress his dad?  I will let you watch the movie and find out.

My opinion:  The movie was watchable.  I wasn't bored.  And yet....I think the plot was a bit ""thin.""  There were no real surprises...no clever twists or turns.  No ""OH WOW, I wasn't expecting that!"" moments.  I probably would not watch the movie again, but who knows?  Maybe if a few years go by, I might.

I don't believe the movie deserves all the bad reviews it's gotten.  I think the acting was perfectly adequate.  Some say the movie takes itself ""too seriously,"" and maybe that's true.  It could have used some more character development and humor, certainly.  However, the father in the movie was not supposed to be a light and jolly fellow.  He was having trouble connecting with his son, and that was a big part of the plot.

I say, give the movie a try.  I think teen boys might like it (although I'm not sure.  I'm not a teen boy)!  Don't let the negative reviews keep you away...form your own opinion!  Watch with an open mind.  You might be surprised.",1381536000,2,2598,4.395789473684211

I struggle to give it 2 stars. Frankly it was slow moving and boring a lot of the time. The actors all appeared to be stiff in playing their roles and the film was not good.

* for the sake of spoilers I will be as ambiguous as possible:
Yes the acting is weak and feels like they are trying too hard, granted some ideas in this movie are a bit funny: speech, creatures encountered throughout and their interaction with main character, climate and so on... notion of evolving things could have been pushed much further, and the story leaves us a bit unclear about few key points regarding the enemy, humankind, past, present, new dwelling, etc. So it is not as deep as Odyssey 2001 - although some argue that one was a bore of a movie too....

I am guessing that Will Smith is helping his son get into acting and tho this is his first movie he doesnt have the knack for it. Maybe as it was his character and how he felt the character should be portrayed over time his acting will get better.  Kinda sorry I even paid moneuy for this movie.,1381449600,2,450,4.149425287356322

This movie was given a bad rap just like John Carter.  Everyone is entilted to their opinion.  I respect that.  This is mine.  Original plot, story and face it; father and son team.  If you put yourself into the movie and the characters you'll see that it was a good movie.  A young man trying to be like his father, a war hero and savior of the human race.  A 15 year old boy having to become a man to save the life of  his dad, survive in a hostile environment and overcome his fears and prove to himself that he can do the things that he believed that he can do.

5771384,1,B00D2ZF24O,"Just adding my two cents here but Jaden Smith has got to be one of the worst actors in the movies today.  He lacks any of the charm and charisma his father possesses and he simply just cannot act.  The fact that he has gotten a role in such a big-budget film is purely through nepotism.  And let us not forget that the script was horrible as well.  This was such a patchwork of other films (better films) that I'm surprised that the film company hasn't been sued yet.

Watch the movie for yourself and you decide, or better yet don't pay that boy any money and don't watch it.  He needs to find a nice job at the mall, because that is where I would expect his level of talent, maturity, and skill to be found.",1381363200,4,709,4.138686131386861

5771386,1,B00D2ZF24O,"I'll just give a run down of the pros and cons of this movie.
Pros:
-Decent graphics and visuals.

Cons:
-Jaden Smith blows.
-Will and Jaden use the WORST British accents for the entire movie.
-The big bad enemy that is hunting mankind is a breed of aliens that were genetically designed to hunt humans, based solely on the ability to smell human fear hormones.
-No attempt is made by our super advanced star faring descendant's to just shield their smelly hormones with chemical suits.., like the ones we wear today to keep nerve agents from killing us in combat.
-The only weapons humans seem capable of using are future swords. Nothing logical like rifles, tanks, flamethrowers, all of which are far less advanced than space ships, and would have completely devastated the aliens.
-Lastly, the creators assumed that 1,000 years is long enough for Earth life to evolve into unrecognizable death machines that have evolved to slay humans, even though humans left Earth before the ridiculous hyper-evolution occurred.

I feel bad about myself for watching this.",1381363200,3,1061,4.988700564971752
5771387,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I have taken this movie as a reminder that just because a film receives poor reviews is not a reason to avoid giving it a chance if the idea behind it interests you. This movie was so widely panned by critics that I had avoided it until one night I really had so few choices that I gave it a shot. I am glad that I did. I watched it with my wife and six children (all of whom are under ten)and everyone was silent and still through the entire thing. If you have kids you likely know how rare that is. Nobody was complaining that Will Smith threw around his weight in a fit of nepotism to film a vehicle for his son to have a starring roll in. Nobody was nit picking the facial expressions of an untried young actor. Nobody's jealousy spilled over into their ability to enjoy what turned out to be a great science fiction vision. And I think that is what it all boils down too. Americans have largely lost their ability to be happy for others who have better opportunities than themselves. I think jealousy and misguided contempt for what was viewed as nepotism on the part of Will Smith overshadowed many critic's ability to do their jobs. Being a critic isn't about being critical of who makes a film but of whether or not the film works as a piece of art. I don't like junkies and drunks but I can tell when one makes fine art. The Louvre is full of examples of this. And while I'm not putting this movie on par with Van Gogh, I certainly wouldn't listen to someone who said his paintings were trash because he had a problem with absinth and lechery.

As far as the film itself goes I thought it worked on nearly every level. I would have liked to have seen the back story of human history and the history of the enemy alien race better fleshed out. It had a sort of cold start approach that could have brought people more into the story with greater emotional investment if this was better done, but that's really my only critical complaint. I think run time probably became an issue with this. It was well paced and the sequences 'in the present' were well done. Special effects were great and the technical vision was interesting. I think Sci Fi fans that are honest with themselves will see a lot of value in this movie.

One last comment, and this is more of a personal issue on my part than a criticism of the movie making. I am a huge science fiction fan (I have read, without exaggeration, over 50 sci fi books this year and it's October 10th. Most years I do around 75 or 80), but it rankles me a bit that so many films and science future stories use as a vehicle the idea that humans as a race and as a rule are inherently bad and it is a forgone conclusion that we are going to destroy the Earth and will one day have to abandon it or perish. I realize that this is often cautionary, and that it is an easy vehicle to use. That it plays on contemporary fears of environmental degradation. There are many possible futures and many good people working to find a way forward for us as a race. The die is not cast and it would be nice to see Hollywood make something that reflects that. I realize that fear sells, but I would pay for some hope. That said this flick was well worth the price of admission (or rental as the case may be).",1381363200,2,3244,4.222222222222222

Trivia
The original screenplay was written by Gary Whitta based on an idea by Will Smith. In pre-production, director M. Night Shyamalan did a few drafts of the screenplay to familiarize himself with the material, before passing it over to Stephen Gaghan, who stayed on as the chief screenwriter during production. Mark Boal, writer of The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, also worked on the script. See more

5771391,5,B00D2ZF24O,My 17 yr old daughter and I watched this movie together and she never watches t.v. or movies! We were on the edge of our seats the entire movie. Luckily I had read one famous reviewers review of the film which inspired me to rent it. Will and especially his son were awesome.,1381363200,4,275,4.2075471698113205

Will is always a good actor and his son is probably going to follow in his footsteps. I thought he did a great job as well. He is young, give him time. I'm glad I rented the movie, but I bet it was good in the theaters as well. Lighten up people! Good Show!!",1381363200,2,412,4.036585365853658
5771393,3,B00D2ZF24O,Very different from your standard Will Smith movies. His acting was very robotic but that's what the role called for. I waited to get this movie on redbox due to all the bad reviews. But I have to say I enjoyed the film. It keeps your attention. Not a holy cow great film but worth watching. Now I do have to agree with the reviews on Will Smith's son's acting. I was very surprised especially after seeing him in Karate Kid that his acting was this poor. Everytime time he spoke his dialogue it seemed like he was reading it off a script. Very unnatural and awkward. His english pronunication was also bad. What happened to this kids acting. If he wasn't Will smith's son I doubt he would have ever been cast in this role. Whenever I see that Will Smith is in a movie I always expect a great film. This is not the case with this movie but worth seeing for a redbox price of $1.30,1381363200,,880,4.21301775147929

5771395,4,B00D2ZF24O,"After seeing all the horrible reviews and feedback this movie received, I was hesitant to buy it. But, I really like Will Smith, and his sci-fi movies are always solid, so I took a chance. I'm glad I did.

I think this movie catches a lot of fallout from the director. I didn't even know it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan until the end credits rolled. I am not his biggest fan by any means, but he has done his fair share of good movies and pretty bad movies. And The Last Airbender. As someone who didn't even follow the anime, that movie was still atrocious. So I think people see he is working on a movie and already form a negative opinion of that movie.

If you watch the movie without expectations, it's a pretty good father/son bonding story in a sci-fi setting, with survival elements thrown in. It dragged a bit in two spots that probably could have been edited better, but it was otherwise enjoyable. The effects are good, and I liked the technology direction they chose, basing the ship and equipment on organic and paper-like substances.
Will Smith and his son share equal screen time, but most of the action scenes are Jaden's. The only thing that bugged me a bit was the weird accent they chose to use for the characters. The son ends up sounding like he is mentally challenged when the story makes it clear he is not, and the general mixes his future accent with modern vernacular.

The rest of the plot seemed fine. You can nitpick anything to death, but if you look at modern society we tend to do a lot of things that make little to no sense, so we would we expect fictional characters and societies to act differently?",1381363200,,1641,4.427152317880795
5771396,4,B00D2ZF24O,Was it the awesome special effects? The great story? The deeper philosophy? The exquisitly designed composit space craft construction? The very cool self essembling graphite weaponry? The interesting biology? The preciousness of seeing an actor actually help his own child to attempt to surpass himself? Let the haters hate... I like the story and I think this was one of Will's best. It was certainly one of M's best. It IS good clean family fun. Enjoy.,1381363200,,454,4.9868421052631575
5771397,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I stayed away from this one until it came out as a rental because of the negative buzz.  Just rented it and watched (with rather low expectations) and enjoyed it.  In fact, if I'd seen it in theaters, I wouldn't have felt cheated a bit.  Jaden Smith is the lead in this, and he does a creditable job.",1381363200,2,300,4.137931034482759
5771398,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I was hesitant to watch this movie after so many bad reviews from critics and fans alike.
I don't really care much what the critics say anyway but when fans give a low rating, I take notice. In this case; I took notice and then just had to watch it to see just what was so bad about it.
My conclusion:
The people who rated it as bad were probably expecting ""Agent Smith"" to kill all the bad aliens and save the day. I think this is the main reason, because tho he has a main part in the movie, he is only equally given screen time with his son on and off the screen.

No Agent Smith did not bring out his teeny weeny gun and blast an alien to kingdom come. He wasn't the hero of the day and if you watch it, it is very unlikely that either of them will be the hero.

Young Smith gave an excellent performance, and Will as always is top notch. The father/son - general/cadet relationship through this movie was well played. The story is good as well, and if you love sci-fi CGI there is plenty of that...tho I would say perhaps a little too much. The story could have been better with a few twists, but it was well done with what they had.
So those who are naysayers are kinda shallow, thinking their hero Will was going to save the boy and the world again. So going into the movie just enjoy it for the story and the acting, not because you had hoped to see another alien thrashing by Will Smith.",1381363200,2,1396,4.091240875912408
5771399,2,B00D2ZF24O,"I sincerely feel bad for M. Night Shyamalan, though the consistency with which he continues to release films, despite his numerous critical and box-office failures of recent past proves that he doesn't necessarily need my pity. Still, it must be difficult to go from being called the next Steven Spielberg to becoming the next Uwe Boll. Even when his films are not terrible, they are light-years away from the quality of his first few features.

With all that being said, After Earth is not as terrible as you might imagine. It also isn't exactly great, but I would place far more blame on the Pinkett/Smith family for the biggest issues the film has. This became a family project, and I think that paired with Shyamalan's overly imaginative science fiction narrative led to a sillier film than necessary. Tamed down a small amount, this may have been a wonderfully adequate family film. Kids are less inclined to notice awkward acting or absurd plot twists.

The glaring issues with After Earth have nothing to do with the polished visuals of seamless computer graphics. The story is even decent in its basic structure, though there are certain developments within the screenplay that take on a kind of logic which seems to come from the mind of a child. Animals suddenly act selflessly to protect a human for no apparent reason and a suit gives the ability to fly when the screenplay is suddenly backed into a corner: these are apparently normal occurrences in a Gary Whitta/Shyamalan feature.

These are all forgivable and campy errors in filmmaking judgment, but the choice to cast Jaden Smith in the leading role was a mistake that can't be as easily ignored or dismissed. The film is produced by many people, but the majority has a blood relation to Jaden, including Caleeb Pinkett, Jada Pinkett Smith his father Will Smith, who has far too little screen time to save this movie. Jaden may be a good actor. To be honest, I would need to see more of him in order to determine what kind of talent he has, but his performance in After Earth leaves a great deal to be desired. It is underwhelming to say the least. I hesitate to say more, because every way I try and word it will sound like cruel verbal bullying.

5771401,1,B00D2ZF24O,"The whole idea behind this movie is Earth has evolved to kill humans. Well, Humans haven't been on Earth for 1000 years, so how does it still evolve to keep something away that's not there?

To run with that, the only things that actually attack's Will Smith's kid is a slug..seriously, a slug....and something from a different planet. In fact, an animal FROM EARTH actually deliberately SAVES the kid.

The other part is they are trying to weave Moby Dick into the film and it doesn't work. They throw out ""Look Dad, I'm reading Moby Dick!"" and then design the inside of the space ship to look like you are inside a whale. And they say ""Look, a real book! and It's Moby Dick!"" And that is about as far as that reference goes.

It's just horrible.

I would say rent it just to see how bad it is.",1381276800,4,795,4.315436241610739
5771402,4,B00D2ZF24O,"The critiques and reviews are a bit harsh on Mr. Jaden.  He did a great all around job - can't imagine all the physical scenes he had to get right and spot on.  Loved 'the suit'.  The main things against him were lack of scene/story development in the beginning, a bit too much of the same type of facial stoicism in all the scenes from the father character as well as a bit too much of the same facial expressions  on Jaden required I assume by the directing. The variety of the events and memory playbacks vs. the emotional balance 'negotiated' in the script could have used just one crack of a smile from  Will Smith so that the audience could connect with his character just a tiny bit in the middle of the film.  His son is capable of the family charm too - just a different style that we hopefully see more of in the future.  Story was good and effects were both good and great.  M. Night Shyamalan is a master at surprise, music match, and unusual character decisions in scripts - so was definitely looking for a bit more of this but I liked it.  Really glad to see Jaden's acting and character finally get to vent and challenge his 'character' Dad in the film - great job!  And thank you to the Smith family for making the sacrifices required to do 'The Pursuit of Happiness' and 'I am Legend' - both which actually saved me during a really really rough time.  Truly wish I could help behind the scenes in this industry - there is so much more HEALING to be done on this planet.  The Smith family and Mr. Shyamalan seem to have the same overall agenda.  But for the present - 3 cheers and many blessings to the ENTIRE team of talent and investors involved in the venture of 'After Earth'.",1381276800,,1696,4.29559748427673

5771409,1,B00D2ZF24O,"A sci-fi adventure void of excitement and personality, After Earth takes an interesting idea and turns it into a meandering, plodding drip of a movie.

M. Night Shyamalan once made great films. The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs were unique genre movies that benefited from Shyamalan's creative approach to story and direction. Several turkeys later and the once critic's darling has become a gun for hire, with After Earth his latest gig. That his once popular name does not appear on any of the promo material indicates the dire professional straits Shyamalan has found himself in.

The names that are front and centre belong to Will Smith and his son Jaden. They (of course) play father and son General Cypher Riage and Kitai Raige, respectively, inhabitants of a distant planet colonised by humans, who find themselves in a race for survival after a mid-space journey leads to a crash landing on an Earth that has evolved into a much dangerous place a millennium after mankind left it. Being a Shyamlan film of course there is more plot featured, yet such exposition was dizzying enough in the film so no need to repeat it here.

A case of ""too much info"" is the least of the problems which plague After Earth, a bland sci-fi adventure that literally begins with a crash and never recovers. With a meandering script (courtesy of Shyamalan and Gary Wittia) as its guide, After Earth plodders from one scenario to another as hot-headed Kitai journeys through treacherous land to find an emergency beacon, while his heroic yet emotionally stunted father is sidelined with a gruesome injury that could be fatal. Despite working with two tense filled scenarios, Shyamalan fails to make either effectively engrossing in any way.

A big problem is the performances, with the Smith duo unable to make these characters, their scenario or their relationship worth investing in. Jaden Smith is just too green to pull of such a demanding lead role, with Kitai the engine that should have made After Earth run smoothly instead of spluttering along like the lemon it is. In turn Kitai becomes an intensely unlikeable character who cannot get the audience on side.

Just as bad is big ""Willie"" Smith, who delivers a flaccid performance bereft of that charisma that benefits most of his movies, replaced here with a clenched jaw intensity that becomes stale, fast. It is ironic that a film about a son following the legacy of his father has seen the Smith family shoot themselves in the foot in their second outing as a collective (matriarch Jada Pinkett Smith joins her husband as a producer).

Worst is the body blow given to Shyamalan's career with yet another stinker. There is still talent there to be sure with some moments of tension creeping through After Earth now and again, yet a new approach is needed by Shyamalan to recapture former glories.

The first step should be to align himself with a screenwriter - perhaps a Damon Lindelof (Star Trek) or Jonatahon Nolan (The Dark Knight Rises) - who can take his million dollar ideas and shape it into something worth watching. The second? Stay away from vain family projects that are sure to leave egg on your face.

5771417,2,B00D2ZF24O,"Will Smith has been an actor that has delivered some entertainment over the years. Now though his focus appears to be the promotion of his kid as a viable major player in the role of the central figure, which he is simply not equipped to execute at this point in his young career. He was obnoxious in The Day the Earth Stood Still but cute at times, then in The Karate Kid he was totally unbelievable as he was a ""fly weight"" fighting middle and heavy weights and of course he was winning which was absolutely unbelievable. Then we are shown this kid in After Earth who again is just not mature enough to be credible in the roles his Daddy is creating for him, as he obviously has the assets and the clout to do as he pleases as a Producer, although he hasn't shown good judgment in the nurturing of Jaden Smiths career, which I think is going to really do more harm than good in the end because I think there are a majority of audiences that feel that this kid really just isn't ready for ""Prime Time"" as his presence simply isn't credible in the roles his daddy is essentially buying him forcing into a role that he is simply not ready for. And I am certain this is going to do this young man far more harm than good in the end. Producers, other than daddy, are going to repel at the idea of casting this kid after seeing the result of his (""lackluster"" would be far to complementary of his performance as compared to what he actually delivered) downright silly performance in After Earth as the one sent to do battle with the creatures and hostile environment that his daddy would be challenged in an attempt at overcoming that type of sheer brutal challenge that he would be faced with, but we see the shinny kid out there tearing up all challengers that he is faced with, although totally unbelievable in a story that would have done well to add a Tin Man, Scarecrow and Cowardly Lion to make it somewhat more believable. But money has its privilege and Will Smith has plenty of that, the only problem is that money just can't buy Jaden ""Talent"" or ""Credibility"" at this point in his young life, no matter who his parents are.",1381276800,2,2131,4.370277078085643

5771424,4,B00D2ZF24O,"You know, there are many reasons people rate movies poorly other than the movie sucking itself. I think unfortunately because of M. Night Shyamalan as a director and Jaden Smith as the main character, whom most people feel has his career in acting due to his fathers clout, this movie has been received with a bit of negative Bias. Now, I have seen some pretty sorry movies over the years. If you ignore the bias and look at the movie objectively without consideration of cast and crew, this wasn't a sorry movie. The very first part of the story is a bit weak. Not enough character introduction was shown to get you involved in the characters lives. I am thinking the scenes that lead up to the son's dismissal were cut leaving a gap that isn't properly explained. It gives no visual representation of why Kitai (Jaden Smith) was cut from the ranks of the graduating rangers. Probably due to the finished product of those scenes not meeting the quality requirements. they were probably not filmed again due to costs. Other than this, the acting was watchable and the story (A survival story) was good and reasonably believable based on the level of technology shown during the movie and the amount of time in the future (Enough time to develop faster than light interstellar travel, find a new world to live in, run from a hostile planet that had evolved in many ways to kill humans and live 1000 years after that time). In other words a distant future. The special affects were good and believable enough to keep you involved but not spectacular.

The theme of the story is the understanding that fear is not real except in ones mind but danger is. That you can overcome the danger if you overcome your fear and learn to think clearly instead of letting fear cause you to panic and ultimately cause you to make a very fatal mistake. Not a bad survivalist way to think and live. I think the story gets this point across nicely. General Raige's son Kitai learns this as he goes to retrieve the second emergency beacon in the tail end of the crashed ship averting many dangers and barely surviving some. The ship is approximately 2 days away. Kitai's father is struggling to stay alive with 2 badly broken legs, one with arterial damage. The large bird part of the story is a bit hard to believe but, I guess it could be possible if these animals have had the time to evolve and become more intelligent. The final fight with the Ursa was done well. It brings a climax and nice ending showing the theme to the movie in action. That's what I saw. Judge for yourself, renting here in HD is only $5.99 with tax. Hope this review helps people decide.",1381190400,122,2644,4.531380753138075
5771425,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I really enjoyed this science fiction flick. Will Smith never disappoints, and, as his son Jadan grows up he is becoming a very compelling actor in his own right. I think it's telling as to whom this film was made primarily for that Jadan received top billing in the credits. I wonder if Jadan auditioned for Ender's Game.

It's really just a pure sci-fi action flick without a lot of moral preachiness. Yes it takes place in a future where mankind has had to survive on distant worlds because Earth became uninhabitable although from the lush biota through which Jadan's character has to travel to fulfill his mission it appears ready for resettlement. The monsters that have wreaked havoc on the remnants of humanity is a purely Shyamalin creation and really ingenious. It makes human emotion the enemy and that's the only moral that I was able to glean.

Will's character's stoicism, that other reviewers see as dead-pan delivery, is central to the story line. Fear is what draws the monsters to humans to kill them. By controlling his emotions he is able to conquer his fear. ""Ghosting"" is overcoming fear to the degree that the monsters cannot see you and thus makes them vulnerable to being killed by the ghoster. It's a great plot device that I think has been used before.

Another thing that perplexes some reviewers is the accents. What did you think of Tom Hanks' and Halle Berrie's Pidgen English in the future distopia segment of Cloud Atlas? I think in both cases we are supposed to be reminded that in the distant future people will not talk like they do now.

To agree somewhat with some of the negative reviewers about the technology portrayed I did wonder why no high powered weaponry. If you can build space ships with warp drive why is the only weapon a high tech samurai sword? If this was explained somewhere in the movie I missed it.

All in all a good sci-fi action flick that shows off the developing talents of Jaden Smith with a little help from Dad. Good work overall and looking forward to the next project from the family Smith.",1381190400,2,2057,4.6401098901098905

Otherwise, I thought it was a good coming-of-age story acted believably by this father and son duo. I have five sons, and I am thrilled to have an option for them that is free of sex and cursing, where there is a strong father image, and where the young main character displays fortitude, efficacy, a sense of duty, and a deep love for and commitment to his family.

5771430,5,B00D2ZF24O,"Wow, from all the reviews out there I was expecting to be disappointed. However, this turned out to be an incredibly enjoyable Sci-Fi Action Fantasy film. The film is just GORGEOUS to behold in GRAINLESS! 4K Blu-ray 1080p MPEG-4 AVC. Shot, as was Oblivion, with the new Sony F65 4K-8K cameras. I can't wait for ""film grain"" to give up the ghost. Films like Life of Pi and After Earth make you feel like you are right there in the story. The picture is so life like. It's so cool to be blown away by all the fine details that catch your eye too. There so much detail that you are still discovering new stuff on subsequent viewings. Just beautiful like Life of Pi which was shot with the Arri Alexa Digital cameras. Top that off with an incredible DTS 5.1 Master Audio Soundtrack and it's impossible not to enjoy the movie. We don't have the best theaters here in Montana, so I'm so glad I waited to watch it as a fully maximized Blu-ray presentation on my home theater.

I found the story quite engaging too. So much so, that I couldn't wait to get back inside after taking my puppy out at 4AM to get back to the movie. I found for me that MNS films are best enjoyed late at night when it's dead quiet and totally dark. That is because his films have so much invested in the cinematography and especially the soundtrack. As such, all my attention could be focused 100% in the movie.

From everything I had read about After Earth, I was expecting to see just a glimpse of Will Smith with 99% of the film being all Jaden. I guess all the bashers didn't see the same film I did... There was just the right amount of back and forth between father and son to get me emotionally invested in the characters and their dilemna. Yes there were a couple of times I wish I could of reached in and slapped some sense into the kid, but hey, that is what teenagers are really like! And sure, it's a cornball totally predictable plot, but it's easily enjoyable if you can let all that go and just get into the story. As such, it's a good sci-fi film for the youngsters.

I think Jaden Smith has had his best performance so far in After Earth. He did a good job portraying the confused, conflicted, unsure, and frightened teenager he was supposed to be. It was also nice to see some more serious dramatic acting by Will Smith too. It reminded me of his performance in I Am Legend.",1381190400,5,2362,4.303370786516854

5771448,2,B00D2ZF24O,"Shyamalan seems to have botched yet another film with great potential. To me at least, I liked the premise of futuristic survival story on an earth which has ""evolved"" to be hazardous to humans, but two main things ruined it - 1) Jaden Smith's acting and 2) several gaping plot holes.

1) Jaden Smith's acting, as noted by many, seemed painfully forced in this film. I realize they were trying to go for a kid raised in a military-academy environment, but Jaden's acting was so stiff I just never saw him as a believable character.

2) The plot holes:

a. The enemy aliens are shown to have ships with laser weapons, and humanity apparently somehow manages to fight them off with oversized swiss army knives and no warships? Maybe these things just weren't shown, but to me it doesn't make sense to be transporting an Ursa on a ship without actual weaponry.

b. Ghosting is a cool concept and great for personal fortitude, but it's kind of unnecessary. As demonstrated when Kitai's sister is killed, if a person is within a sealed environment the Ursa cannot detect his/fear. None of the humans thought of wearing sealed suits like astronauts or fire-fighters?

c. Earth doesn't seem to have evolved to kill humans as much as it was suggested initially. Earth is different, but not horribly more dangerous besides the rapid temperature changes. None of the flora was demonstrated to be dangerous to humans which would have been cool. Even the various animals aren't really evolved to kill humans - the leech has developed poison, the monkeys were provoked, the condor/eagle was trying to feed its chicks, the big lion/tigers were hungry, etc.

d. Why did the condor/eagle save Kitai? Kitai was more trying to save himself than the babies (and failed to save the babies). It's not an impossible scenario, but the condor/eagle save felt way too convenient.

e. How does the Ursa get around if the only senses it seems to have are touch and smell (maybe hearing)? Unless it's using echolocation, how can navigate through uneven terrain like in the mountain with all of the cliffs and pitfalls? Again, it could be countered easily by wearing sealed suits and actual weapons.",1380844800,5,2170,4.817204301075269

5771450,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I love how the mainstream press all influence each other and basically end up writing the same review for a film while jumping on their own self-made bandwagons. The media was so obsessed with the fact that Will Smith would have the audacity to appear onscreen with his son Jaden in a movie helmed by a ""failed"" director that they couldn't just enjoy ""After Earth"" for what it is. It's a sci-fi movie filled with action and suspense and a deeper meaning at its center.

Enroute to another planet, Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) and his father Cypher (Will Smith) must make an emergency crash-landing on one of the deadliest worlds in their solar system - Earth. The human race was forced to leave the planet after generations of destroying and depleting it of its natural resources. Left to its own devices, Earth has become a wild kingdom of dangerous and deadly plant and animal life. Their ship split in two, Kitai must make his way across dangerous terrain to recover an electronic signal which will call for a rescue team.

""After Earth"" is about the relationship between a father and son. It shows how a father can have unreachable expectations for his offspring but mean well at the same time. It's also a movie about overcoming your fears and doing what you have to do to survive. Lastly, it shows one boy's journey to becoming a man - not because he wants to, but because he has to.

Whether you want to admit it or not, every male child wants to win the approval of their father. ""After Earth"" captures this perfectly. Everything Jaden Smith's character does during his hero's journey is based upon what he thinks his father would do.

I really don't understand where the animosity toward Jaden Smith comes from. He's actually quite a good little actor. The emotions he runs through in ""After Earth"" come across as genuine and his interactions with real and CGI characters and beasts are convincing. Again, I think the media wanted to hate this kid from the get-go and just spread the disease from one outlet to the next.

The CGI and special effects in ""After Earth"" were well-executed for the most part. They weren't perfect by any means. There were parts you could tell were obviously digitally animated. However, for the most part everything looked good.

""After Earth"" is rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and some disturbing images. I can't even recall there being any bad language in the film at all. I would suggest it for anyone over the age of 13 and can see where a father and son could use it as a portal to communicating with each other and bonding. Contrary to what many have said, I didn't picked up any strong or dangerous Scientology messages being thrown at audiences.
The DVD version of ""After Earth"" contains a few entertaining special features. ""A Father's Legacy"" shows us Jaden and Will Smith working on and off-screen together. ""1,000 Years in 300 Seconds"" takes viewers behind the scenes and on location with the cast and crew. ""The Nature of the Future"" gives us an upfront and personal view of the landscapes used in the film. Jaden Smith introduces the winning video of a contest people entered called ""Xprize 'After Earth.'""

""After Earth"" is a casualty of pre-conceived notions by the press. People responded to the film based on the fact that Will Smith was supposedly shoving his son down our throats in a movie made by a director who's hit a couple bumps in his career recently, but still has more good features under his belt than bad. Judged on its own, ""After Earth"" is a touching and action-packed sci-fi film with something to say about relationships between a father and son.",1380844800,3,3624,4.6976377952755906

So you have M. Night's talent for producing utter trash 10 out of 10 times, then this pathetic idea of promoting Will Smith's son just because he is Will Smith's son even though he can't act better than a paper bag, plus you have a script that must have been written by someone completely stoned out of his mind and the result is predictable - disaster.

To give you an example for how bad the script is - the entire movie rests on the concept that in order to fight the evil aliens you have to be able to control your fear, because that controls your body odors. Because the aliens are blind and can only kill you when they smell you. Are you still with me?!?
So this is supposed to be a hard sci-fi movie, with a human civilization that has mastered interstellar travel, large-scale terraforming and faster than light communications - but they have to fight some aliens - with swords!
And therefore they have to walk up to them - and they have never considered just wearing a suit with helmet that would just contain their odor. Or, you know, use weapons that.. are not SWORDS! They do have odor-containing plastic bubbles to protect their children when the aliens attack, so they are aware that this is a concept that would work - but no, they put their children under the bubble and then the parents go and fight - with SWORDS!
Not a laser gun, or even just a rifle or - heck - even a crossbow would do, since the aliens are actually quite vulnerable (to swords...).
No, it has to be a sword so that there can be an entire movie about Will Smith's son carrying his father's blade and then finding his own and learning to control his body odor in ways other than just taking a shower or wearing a suit and helmet.
This is how incredibly dumb a piece of nonsense this is. Now imagine adding M.Night Shalala's directing and Jaden Smith's ""acting"" and you understand why this will go down as one of the 3 or 4 worst movies of this decade.",1380672000,293,2079,4.3860103626943

Let's strip away all that nonsense and just review the film!

I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan, and no, I haven't rated all of his films a ""10"" or ""5 stars"". Same for Will Smith. I figured I'd get that out of the way first and yes, I am an actor that has worked on two Shyamalan films (not this one).

On to the film...
Visually, I found ""After Earth"" to be a beautifully shot film with lush landscapes, interesting special FX and some interesting, new elements like the changing colors of the suit Jaden Smith wears. Any sci fi fan should love the visuals. Couple that with a great score and editing and from a technical standpoint you have a winner.

Shyamalan's directing is right on point. The story was written by Shyamalan, Smith and Gary Whitta and focuses on the relationship between a stern military man (Will Smith) and his tentative, but eager to please son (Jaden Smith). You can tell from the story that though the father loves his son, he wants more from him instead of accepting him as he is and that the son doesn't really want the military life, but feels it will please his father. He also feels responsible for the death of his sister by a dreaded ""Ursa"". Both characters are written with internal conflicts regarding the other. As with all Shyamalan films, this is really about coming to terms with a strained relationship through an extreme cicumstance.

As for the acting, Will Smith does not play to type here. There are no jokes. He is not the action star and the only time the stern appearance breaks is when he is with his wife and at the end of the film. It's a nice change.

Jaden Smith is the lead of this film. I personally think his energy, reactions and facial expressions are really good and based on them I believe his performance. I think what myself and others want to see from Jaden is better delivery of his lines. With some work on his dialogue he will get there. I will agree that he's not there yet, but I think he has the ability. Acting is a constant learning experience and work will yield improvement.",1380672000,,2273,4.412887828162291

5771475,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I'd heard so much negativity surrounding 'After Earth', but I was very interested myself, but didn't have the circumstances to go see the film in theaters.  I read the novelization and the prequel novel, 'After Earth: A Perfect Beast', instead.  (Forgive the preface, but I wanted to at least give some insight on my potential bias.)

I enjoyed the books (they're better than the movie, more detailed by far), and eagerly looked forward to seeing the movie.  Here's the deal: this is a fairly short film, so not a lot of plot is involved.  Most of the film is Will Smith and Jaden Smith in a man-vs.-nature situation in a post-apocalyptic Earth.  What you see in the previews is more or less what you get, but it's not entirely that simple.

The biggest plus in this film is Will Smith's nuanced performance.  For fathers, I think this film has a lot of heart.  Its strongest point is the reconnecting of father and son through this crisis situation they're experiencing (crash-landing on Earth, etc.).  There are actually very few people in this movie, to be honest.  The plot is very centered on Cypher (Will Smith) and Kitai (Jaden Smith), but in itself, that is actually quite compelling.

Jaden Smith is actually pretty good at many places throughout this film, and falls flat in others.  He's kind of the weak link, but the good thing is that Will Smith's experience is there to keep the film grounded and counterbalance him.  Jaden is not horrible, but doesn't quite hit all the notes perfectly.  Another factor is that the script doesn't always give us enough of a grasp of his perspective.  I think they needed to add more to really draw us into how he feels, as it's key to understanding the character's motivations (a desire to please his father/self-blame over a past tragedy/trauma and anger resulting from same tragedy).

The only other major downside of the film is that it fails to really fill in the story enough to help the audience see that there is a much larger world here than what we saw in the film.  I would have liked to have seen more of this world, how it's run, who the aliens were (the Skrel), why they sent the Ursa, and maybe why they didn't just send a thousand of them and wipe out humanity, for instance.

It's a good film, but maybe it won't appeal to what people were hoping for.  There isn't a lot of humor, and not that much action, but there is some good (mostly subtle) emotion throughout, along with interesting themes--the beauty of planet Earth, overcoming one's fears, father connecting with son, coping with loss of a child, and coming-of-age as a young man.

I know it won't be a popular thing to say that I like it, and that more people should've checked it out, but...I like it.  I certainly wasn't blown away, but I was pleased with the film and I would've liked to see where this story was going.  I think it's better than people will give it credit for.  It's not going in the same direction as a lot of the big blockbusters with massive destruction, explosions, sometimes excessive violence and language and objectification of women, etc.

It's also unique in having a cast that largely consists of people of color, but not prejudiced in that it shows this is a diverse world with not just one or two colors of people, and I like that in a movie.  (Some good assists towards the beginning of the film from two very good actors whose names escape me...)

So...I say, check it out.  It's at least worth a rental, but I own it, and am already trying to watch it again after the first viewing.  After Earth is alright with me.",1380326400,2,3575,4.550860719874804
5771476,5,B00D2ZF24O,"Personally, I loved this movie. The movie contains all the elements for a good action/drama/thriller scifi. You have a setting far in the future where the human race has settled on another world following the collapse of the Earth's ecosystem, and it's inability to sustain the human population any more. Then there is the strained relationship of the father and son. Then the ship they are on is seriously damaged, and they are forced to make a crash landing on the one planet they are prohibited from landing on, Earth. The father is seriously injured in the crash, the rest of the crew dies, and it is up to the son to navigate the hostile environment, find the other half of the ship which broke apart on entry, and activate an emergency beacon so they can be rescued. What follows is a thrilling adventure as the son navigates the familiar, yet alien Earth of the far future, and the father is forced to watch from the confines of the crashed ship as his son encounters danger after danger.",1380326400,,995,4.595505617977528
5771477,3,B00D2ZF24O,"Upon it's release, I initially avoided After Earth like I would a pack of rabid baboons. Terrible critic reviews and middling audience feedback gave me the impression that this promising-sounding sci-fi was another one of M. Night Shyamalan's recent streak of bad films.

When I actually watched it on DVD (thankfully, on our HD TV), I expected the ABSOLUTE worst, but was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie was NOT a miserable trainwreck. It wasn't great, wasn't classic. Wasn't even entirely awesome. But, as I begrudgingly had to admit, After Earth was the first watchable Shyamalan movie since Signs, nd not a *bad* movie...

That having been said, the movie had flaws big enough to drive Shyamalan's ego through. The dialogue was *absolutely* cringeworthy. Laughably serious, terribly mundane, and cliched in that way that only pulp sci-fi can be (""It has found you.""), it had that joyless quality that only Shyamalan can bring. The acting was little better.

Will Smith is dead serious, and as stern and commanding as the world's most humorless general. The gravitas was still there (That ""Take a knee"" line is strangely moving), but without his usual charm and charisma, Smith Sr. seemed to drag the movie down like a guy who had both his legs broken. Oh, right...
Jaden has no real reason to be here (other than his father being in the same film), and we all hoped for a stronger actor, but he managed to be....watchable. Juuuust watchable, not extraordinary in any way. Though there were scenes, such as his climactic fight with the Ursa, where just a little of his father's talent and screen presence can be viewed in him.

Other cons include the plodding pace the movie accepts at times, and the looong time it takes to get off the ground (literally). And the ""What the--?"" accent everyone is using. No, seriously: What the--?!

...

But prepare to be amazed when Shyamalan just shows you amazing stuff: a group of men jogging underneath a bloodred sun, herd of bison roaming over hills, a lush forest under the sky, a volcano floating flakes of ash down from the sky, a troop of monkeys running through a rain forest. The CGI was not the best I've ever seen, but the creature design and amazing cinematography really made up for that.

As a huge animal lover, I was majorly entertained any time some wierd and wonderful animal came onscreen. The fact that sabretooths and giant vultures exist is absolutely ludicrous, but ludicrous in that suspend-your-disbelief-and-take-it-for-what-it-is way. Love the monkeys, but weren't there okapi's in the trailer?

The landscape itself became a supporting character (again - the whole rainforest freezing thing is ludicrous, but passable). The cinematography was, at times extraordinary. That volcano fight at the end was gorgeously shot, and, I am ashamed to say, somewhat moving (being the only moment in the After Earth that I could actually label ""cool"" or ""awesome""). The biggest surprise for me was the score by James Newton Howard, which made sit up straight and go ""Whaaaat? This movie has a good score? I gotta get this on iTunes!"" And mention has to go to the costumes and tech, and for being the first sci-fi movie that has wood and cloth interiors rather than chrome and glass, which was pleasantly original.

And hey, that speech about danger and fear is some profound stuff, man.

...

Conclusion:
CONS: Dialogue abysmal and laughable. Acting joyless and stiff. Story unoriginal and pace plodding.
PROS: Stunning visuals, amazing cinematography, excellent score, costumes, and set design.
My rating? I give After Earth a solid 3 stars - not great, not awful. All that negative reception is understandable, but not wholly warranted. This is not a classic for the ages, but rather, a pleasantly enjoyable night at the movies!

5771487,5,B00D2ZF24O,"This is a great addition to post-apocalyptic sci-fi. I think one of the drawbacks to many stories is that they show the survival of a person or small group of people, and then don't touch much on what they do afterwards. The post-apocalyptic genre is really good at showing how people live after a disastrous event, but it is not often done in sci-fi movies. You mostly see it in the horror genre (specifically, zombie movies). This movie incorporates Zen-like philosophy (which people have falsely labeled as Scientology propaganda), as well as interesting and seemingly-plausible futuristic technology. Will and Jaden Smith do a fantastic job of portraying a necessarily militant future, and both play interesting characters with more depth than a lot of reviews give them credit for. Will Smith is on another level from other actors, and his son seems to be picking up his father's style of learning and acting. I won't go into specific details for the movie, but it is well worth watching if you enjoy the genre. I would classify this as more of a thinking person's sci-fi movie; yes it has a lot of action, but it can be traced back to the main character's struggle for control of their self, and it is very entertaining to watch.",1380240000,3,1235,4.775700934579439

2.  Jaden Smith not acting like he's four years old but instead like a 14 year old.  The ""being scared"" routine got pretty stale by the end of the movie.

They could have used less flashback to the daughter dying and more encounters with different species on the old earth. Jaden is a natural on camera.

I enjoyed it. It doesn't warrant a standing ovation, but it does take you on a mini-adventure. I thought it was a visually well-rounded sci-fi film in terms of aesthetic quality and design, although there was much more focus on the relationship between father and son. There are scenes between the two, mostly in one scene after the characters are initially introduced, where the acting does seem a bit contrived. Will's character does not always seem quite so self-contained as a seasoned high-ranking officer may be believed to be but there may be a deliberate thread of vulnerability woven in. Jaden's acting is a fit for the character though the performance seemed a bit rushed and raw in places. There was room for improvement. I may have edited the retrospective scenes of the sister differently, too.

5771503,4,B00D2ZF24O,"So far the reviews have been a little skewed. I am not predisposed to comment on the value of a movie because of the use of African-Americans as one reviewer did. I am not sure that matters unless there is an actual context. Actors are actors... like humans are humans... Will Smith has an incredible amount of potential as an actor (not because of his ethnicity but because of his presence and skill)and his best work has yet to be seen. I do not feel he has become self actualized yet (Kurt G derivation of the term)... and so his best performances are ahead of him... just my opinion. One review suggested there may have been a use of Jaden Smith for the wrong reasons (rich daddy)... however... there was also a primary theme in this movie to show the bond of father and son and the coming of age story... so desperately lost on the current generation. So the real bond between Will and Jaden was leveraged in this movie and I found Jaden's performance more innocent and genuine than immature as suggested.

As a pure Sci-fi with good CGI and an engaging storyline... this movie is a 4 and you will not be disappointed (despite all of the box office bomb reviews where people expect far more out of sci-fi than it is able to deliver). For the story-line it is a little predictable but still relatively unique. A father with a legendary ability to suppress emotions has been almost the savior of the human race against alien adversaries. His son is training to walk in his shoes (no surprises there), but of course they are big shoes to fill. On a trip planned to be an opportunity for them to get closer and bond... an accident causes a crash on a planet that goes back to human origins for this timeline... namely earth. Only it is a new and further 'evolved' earth (if you are so inclined to believe in this). It is a very harsh environment and the son is required to become a man in this very hostile environment while trying to save both himself and his father who is injured. Classic triumph of the spirit stuff here!!!

A good sci-fi with a good story and a good message. Leave it at that people! Don't go looking for more where there is nothing else to find!!! Dramatic sequences and some scary images, so mind the kids with this one. Most viewers will not be disappointed. Unless of course they require a little more to assist them in their suspension of disbelief.",1379980800,7,2377,4.4495412844036695
5771504,5,B00D2ZF24O,"I heard a lot of reviews about this movie being a bomb, including the ones here on Amazon. However, I am the type of person that likes to judge for myself. So, with an all star African-American cast of Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Zoe Kravitz and Black British actress Sophie Okonedo, a new genre of sci-fi has been released. Like most movies, in particular sci-fi, there is a slow introduction to the plot but once this movie takes off, it certainly keeps you engaged.

To begin, this movie is about a family, specifically a father and son relationship that is greatly affected by the loss of a daughter (Zoe Kravitz) by an alien, who killed her while protecting her little brother. This takes a toll on the whole family but especially Will Smith a general and Zoe Kravitz's brother Jaden Smith a wannabe ranger/soldier.

After a return from a mission, Will thinks about retiring but his wife suggests he take their son on a training mission to bond. However, the bonding doesn't quite go as plan when their spaceship crashes on old Earth, leaving Will Smith temporarily disabled, a dead crew, a creature loose, leaving a son as the heroine to save his father and himself by locating a the ship's rescue beacon to get help.

However,this beacon is not nearby but in the ships wreakage across the planet. This means, Jaden will have to face his fears and set aside all blame from his sister's death and find the beacon despite the dangers. It's definitely a good watch, just like any other sci-fi and probably can be considered more like the Family Robinson in outer space.",1379980800,5,1569,4.657039711191335

5771506,5,B00D2ZF24O,"Modern Sci-Fi tends to be action mixed with aliens.  Traditional Sci-Fi and Sci-Fi books in general do a much better job of making the story more about the human element.

After Earth is more in this spirit.  Its less about aliens and awesome technology and more about human character and spirit.  I feel that this movie is more like Oblivion and Moon... Its not so flashy and a bit understated but rather more about characterization and transformation.

In After Earth the protagonist grows and we as the audience grow with him.  I think this is one of the best Sci-Fi films of the year.  I wish it got more love.  I feel that Will Smith played an understated more reserved character that can be off putting for some people but in actuality makes for a better story...

5771508,2,B00D2ZF24O,"I'm a pretty easy going person and I approached this movie not expecting too much. I'll just go straight to the critiques. For those that haven't watched the movie, I'll try to censor the spoilers:

Pros:

- A lot of people felt Jaden Smith's acting to be not so good, but I thought most of the scenes that he was in was okay (in other words...I was expecting it, especially after seeing the Karate Kid which I didn't like either). I see some improvement in his acting and I too wish he would one day become as talented as his father. I'm a Will Smith fan and I mainly watched this movie for Will Smith but I was willing to give his son a chance. I understand that Will Smith is trying hard to give his son a strong chance in the acting career, he's doing everything a father can do to give his kids the leverage that they need. He loves his family and he's doing what he can and I admire that. Being a bystander, sometimes we are quick to criticize him of stuff like nepotism but he's a father that's a famous actor, what did you expect? Any father would probably do the same.

- I'm not yet much of a Jaden Smith fan, but seeing him in this movie definitely made me think of Will Smith and there were scenes where I did feel that charismatic presence coming from his son. I don't think his son will be as fun to watch as his father but I hope he proves me wrong.

Cons:

- I'm going to flat out and say I blame this film's mediocrity not on Jaden Smith but on M. Night Shyamalan. I think most of M. Night's movies are overrated.
- The narration with Jaden Smith in the beginning didn't feel right. His voice moves me AWAY from the movie.
- The trailer shows pretty much all the action scenes. Many times I feel like the person that made the trailer should be the person that makes the movies, it's just so much more exciting. The better the trailer and/or the more action scenes they show in the trailer, the more you expect the film to be not so great. They're desperate for advertisement that they're basically throwing everything good about the movie into the trailer to hype up the potential moviegoers.
- The planet that they land on, don't expect a world you haven't seen before, or creative interesting sci fi creatures. Eagles, lions, apes, even the plant life. Only the Ursa is different from the rest and even they're not that creative (they look like what you see in Lord of the Ring). This was one big reason why I was disappointed. I was expecting a fantasy world, but pretty much everything that's seen in the trailer is everything you'll see in the movie pretty much.
- SPOILER ALERT thereisascenewhereheisalmostfrozenaftertheraftscene. And he gets saved by an eagle that is smart enough to drag him into a hole and then cover up the hole with foliage AND THEN spread itself out over the spot in order to keep Kitai (Jadan) alive? Yeah F right haha...why would the eagle also remain on the ground and not fly off with Kitai instead?
- Alright we just have to bring up the Ursas. The blind creatures that can smell human pheromones when humans are scared. The movie doesn't really explain what made them such a threat to human kind. They're just introduced as large creatures that smell human fear and go after them, but they don't look special or anything. Cypher Raige (Will Smith) took out one with one swipe to the throat, they didn't seem special. The movie just doesn't elaborate on it. Also, if they can smell human fear that comes off our bodies, what about people in another room or people in suits that are airtight? I'm just watching the movie and it makes no sense as to why they're so fearful. Giant monsters...got it.
- Will Smith's part is lacking in this movie, you can tell he tries to leave the significant parts to his son. Will Smith's acting is also toned down, not sure exactly why but it didn't capture me like it usually does (or maybe I just wasn't in the mood or something).

There are other complaints but I'll leave it here, the main ones are covered I believe. The story is slow, the acting kept me away from being absorbed into the movie, and the planet that they crash landed and how boring it was down there left me very unsatisfied. I was surprised that it was a 130 million dollar movie.",1379721600,3,4237,4.3842239185750635

I think the father and Son bond demonstrated in this movie is one of the strongest I've ever seen.  In addition, there is a basic theme in this movie about the choice associated with experiencing fear in life; we choose to interpret life's events and then we create fear in our minds about it.  The actual danger present needs to be dealt with but the fear connected to it is our personal choice.  I can't say enough how powerful this message is.

The story was actually based on a real life event where a plane crashed and the father was injured and his son had to rescue them. The problem with the film may come from the fact that a lot of information is not given or just lightly touched on. If you haven't read the book, that's a prequel to this movie, then I would suggest doing that. The book actually take place about 700 years before the current event but it does tell you about the creatures they fight and why they can't use guns to fight them, as well as the origin of the cutlass they use. It gives you good background on the history of the people and their struggle as well as offering several short stories about the rangers that can ""ghost.""

I did enjoy this movie and thought Jayden did a great job and will be a great actor one day. Having said that, there is really nothing that stands out about the movie. It tells a decent story with decent character development and has good pacing. I'm not sure why there are negative reviews about this movie, is it because of not enough explosions or not filled with alien creatures that only serve as something for the main characters to target? I don't know.

There was one scene in this movie that did feel out of place and that's the hawk scene. I'm not going to spoil for anybody but I felt that it did stand out and pretty much reversed a lot of what is believed to be fact or truth within the movie.

But in the end this an example of the critics getting it wrong and this is definitely an enjoyable scifi flick so don't base your decisions on other peoples' opinions and check it out yourself.",1378080000,4,1698,4.283489096573208

5771520,2,B00D2ZF24O,"* SPOILER WARNING *

Overall I blame M. Night Shyamalan for this failed project. IMDB ratings show an astounding 4.8 where Evil Dead (remake) manages a 6.5. Wow. So if you were looking for a cool sci-fi movie with scares and action you might find this somewhat bland. This is no Alien. It is surreal, thudding and insomnia-curing at times. There isn't any other way to describe it because the performances are average, the dialogue is full of one-liners (when we hear it), the special effects are average and the story was below average. MNS fails to expand his premise in any meaningful way (a problem that has plagued him recently). Earth is now very dangerous and poisonous but must be traversed by the father and son team of The Smiths after their spaceship lands on Earth. Will and Jaden Smith are good but we don't see much of Will Smith. He is injured and unable to accompany his son for most of the movie. When Will Smith does get screen time (he is a supporting actor at best) he doesn't make the impact he could preferring to let Jaden take the spotlight. The focus on Jaden is OK but he can't do it all by himself with only the environment to interact with. The movie has surprisingly little mood which is normally the strength of the director. There isn't even much action to keep the story going. This is sci-fi/drama. It's just Jaden fighting creatures and getting hurt by nature itself. The Smiths will fight another day but MNS's career has been on the decline. Domestic gross, which is still a key benchmark for many studios, is about half of the budget. In America where you are expected to make your money back on day one (or the weekend if you're slow) then After Earth has bombed financially, critically and with audiences. For a much better Smith film, check out I Am Legend, Men in Black or Independence Day. Shyamalan's best film remains The Sixth Sense.

His son, Jaden, also gets a chance in this wonderfully dramatic action adventure fantasy to put his acting skills to the absolute test! Yes, it's not ""Men In Black"" or ""Independence Day"", but it's still pretty darn good! M. Night really redeemed himself from the badness of ""The Last Airbender"" and I hope this movie gains a bigger audience. The critics, in my opinion, have really misjudged and pre-judged this movie due to M. Night's recent work and because they are so used to Will's comedic style. This in my opinion is a very underrated piece of cinema that deserves to be seen and be known about! Highly Recommended! 10/10.

I won't spoil it for those interested in seeing it but overall the movie is great and Jayden does a superb job as well. It is a story of family struggles and bonding.

Raige (Will Smith) returns home to

damages Kitai's craft necessitating a
crash landing on the planet Earth.

As his dad lies critically injured,
Kitai strikes out on his own to
find a rescue beacon. His journey
begins by scaling a moist treacherous

an admirable part as the son of General

action at next year's Oscars.

This writer expects to see a Best Actor

5771525,4,B00D2ZF24O,"I think the first mistake the studio (or whoever makes these decisions) was the advertising and everyone was thinking it was another ""Avatar.""  This picture's basic premise is the relationship between father and son and secondary was the planet and its inhabitants (beasts).  Now once I realized that, I enjoyed it for what it was.  Not perfect . . . but I like Will Smith.  Everyone's expectations these days going to see sci fi movies is very high with all Hollywood has available (CGI for example).  No one expects to see a movie for it's story . . . although I will admit that this was not the best story.  I did read a snippet somewhere that Will Smith used some ideas/theories from Scientology, but what I know about Scientology could fit on top of a pin, can't verify that. Still, I like the movie for what it was . . . summer movie fare.",1374537600,6,845,4.419354838709677
5771526,4,B00D2ZF24O,"After Earth is a pretty decent movie if you don't go into it expecting non-stop action and over-the-top special effects.  The heart of the movie is not the typical modern sci-fi ""blow them away with action and effects and hope they'll forget about the acting"".  The background story (IMO) was pretty decent though somewhat perfunctory which is actually just fine (read the review title again).  I'll admit the plot even felt a bit contrived in some spots, but overall the story held up fairly well.  But the movie was really about the building of a relationship between a mostly absent father and the son desperately (and ultimately, successfully) trying to measure up to what he supposes to be his father's expectations, and exorcising his own internal demons in the process.
I wouldn't give the director too much credit for what I believe is a good movie, though.  I suspect that, with a huge star like Smith involved, and particularly after his last film, M. Knight Shyamalan likely had much less creative input into ""After Earth"".  I can (eventually) forgive M. Knight for brutally butchering ""The Last Airbender"", but (unfortunately) I don't think I'll ever be able to forget it.",1374192000,7,1184,4.924623115577889

I am surprised that there wasn't a lame twist at the end just to punctuate how awful a movie this is. I feel bad because Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, but his son, not so much. The whiny, special forces wanna be son is more annoying than anything else. I was rooting for the horrible CGI creatures to eat him and end MY suffering through this movie. I also have a big question, did humanity all of a sudden decide projectile weapons of any sort wouldn't work any more? Or was it some tihsllub bleeding heart message from M. Night that all weapons in the future will be a goofy cutlass instead of (gasp) guns? Really? Elite forces of the future's main weapon against hostile aliens will be a double bladed spear??? Humanity is screwed!!! Hell, half of the problems encountered by Will Smith's son in the movie could have been solved by some good ol' fashioned laser blasts, gun fire, crossbow bolts, arrows, ect... Hey, monsters attacking my mom, boom! dead from a face full of buckshot. Crazy animals evolved to eat humans? I hope they evolved bulletproof skin! Blam! Zap! Giant eagle is now lunch. Crazy tiger creature is a horrible smelling burning pile of ash. A well placed grenade instead of rocks would have made monkey stew out of the feral super apes. Easy peasy!

5771528,4,B00D2ZF24O,"For what it's worth, I highly enjoyed this movie. That being said, I did have to go and see it at the dollar theater since no one wanted to go and see it with me at a regular theater due to its bad reviews. I'm not sure where those reviews came from, to be honest.

Is this Will Smith's best movie? Absolutely not - don't even bother seeing it if you don't want to see W. Smith in anything less than a star role. He's relegated to an auxiliary character in this film. But it's very interesting to see him play such a character; he's not doing his traditional comedy or action hero. Here he's a strict, dignified, stoic military man who's desperately trying to keep him and his son alive after their space ship crashes to Earth, which has been destroyed and abandoned by humans and then reclaimed by nature. And yes, the introduction is a bit abrupt - but if they'd given no background information it'd be really confusing. As it was, it was enough to get the stage set.

To those critics claiming Jaden Smith's acting is terrible - remember, he's playing a teenager who's constantly living in fear and probably has some anxiety and post traumatic stress disorders running through his head all the time. Yes, his voice is a bit stilted at times and he's overdramatic...But this is quite believable, given Kitai's back story and personality. In my opinion, it worked.

I was hesitant about M. Night directing this movie - in general, I'm not a fan of his work. This movie, however, was a delight to both watch and observe. The images of Earth after humans are gone are beautiful. I wish I could have seen it in imax! That would've been awesome. My only main critique is that the ship seems to land in a deciduous forest biome and quickly progresses to a tropical biome and then to a volcanic, snowy wasteland. While I understand that this is a post-apocalyptic world, it seems more like they were just trying to incorporate as much cool scenery as possible.

All in all, if you really want to go and see this movie or buy it, I would encourage you to do so. Don't let the critics or people who expect nothing but constant explosions, curse words and fighting sequences dissuade you from seeing this. It is a different kind of action movie than you're used to with Will Smith, but it is still quite a good movie even if it isn't perfect. Give it a chance - even if it is through Red Box or the $5 movie bin!",1374019200,9,2404,4.407657657657658

I'm sorry to say I will never get that hour and a half of my life back. I'm giving it two stars because the special effects were decent.",1373673600,79,455,4.066666666666666
5771530,2,B00D2ZF24O,"I watched the movie first and did not read any reviews for it. I did hear this movie wasn't that good, but I gave it a shot anyways. Not surprised that there are mostly negative reviews than positive reviews on here. Anyways, let's get on with my review.

I thought this movie does have the story going for it, but you really have to ""pay attention"" to what is being said in the beginning of the movie. If you miss anything from what they told you at the start, then most likely, you're going to get a little lost into it. The story is very interesting. Earth is slowly becoming an inhabitable planet, and so, the military made a department division called, ""The Rangers core"". The Rangers go out and try to locate a new planet for Earth's people to live on. Eventually, they did find a new planet, Nova Prime, and the people of Earth move relocate there. They do find out that they were not alone on the planet. The Aliens of that world try to kill the humans by creating these new huge monsters that can locate humans and kill them off. The monsters cannot see and are blind, but they can smell fear and that's the only way they can locate the humans.

I'm thinking that it's strange that the humans don't use guns on the monsters as they don't even try to shoot it. I can only assume that guns have no affect on the monsters...right? Then, again, humans at that point should have powerful laser power guns, but they don't even try that. They don't try bombs or anything. Instead, what they have is Will Smith with a two-sided blade weapon going in and hack and stash his way to victory for the humans. Will Smith has an ability to have no fear against these monsters. The ability is called ""Ghosting"". If you can forget that they don't have guns or any advance weaponry in this movie and just use their concept of ghosting than maybe you're like this movie. I can't really - it's just too dumb.

Jadan Smith character is very strong physically, but mentally he's unstable and falls apart in front of danger. This is because the alien's monster killed his big sister when he was only a child. He wants to be like his father, a General in the military and original ranger that invented ghosting. Jadan often doesn't see his father, and so, he doesn't really know him well. Jadan does still looks up to him a lot though. In the movies, I like Jadan playing his funny side with for his characters. I don't think he plays scared acting or fierce/strong acting well. He just doesn't seem to pull it off well.

Now basically, the story of this movie is very simple and easy to make.  There are no characters besides Will and Jadan after the beginning of the movie. Every character would be a flash back after that, so pretty much 90% of the whole movie is just those two guys on the screen. I don't really like that and wanted to see more than just these two guys.

The rest of the story is Will taking to Jadan on his last mission as General before retirement. They need to take a ship and just go to a planet and Will trains the new rangers about ghosting there. Simple, right.  Well it's not. A twist is when we see that they bring the human killing monster with them on the ship. That's because they want to use it for training there. Somehow the ship gets damage and they need to make emergency landing before it's too late. The closes planet is Earth, which we now know that it is inhabitable planet, but there is no other choice. The ship blows up just before the landing and it crashes onto Earth. Jadan is unhurt in the crash, but Will can't move. Will's legs are broken and everyone else is dead. Now, Jadan has to go get help by traveling to retrieve a bacon at the tail end of the ship, and that's 100 kilometers away from them. The bacon will send out a search and recuse signal to the Rangers for help.

Jadan journey is a simple task, but NOT supposed to be easy. Jadan isn't use to Earth's gravity, there are dangers animals and insects everywhere, the air isn't breathable, and finally, the alien's human killing monster is lose and ready and waiting to kill! Jadan. Jadan has help from his father, and gives him a backpack. The backpack has cameras that lets Will sees and hears what Jadan may or may not see or hear. Also, he has breathing devices that let's him breath the toxic air for a short period of time, but he needs to keep on using them throughout the movie. Finally, he has Will's two-sided blade weapon that can change to multiple different styles.

Now, some people may think this is an action movie, but there isn't that much action in this one. This movie shouldn't be in that action category at all, and it should only put in the Sci-Fi section. The action is down to the bare minimum. It is mostly about Jadan talking about himself to his father, and how scared he is doing this task. But through this, they also learn much about each other and how they both react in the same situation different. Remember, the father has NO FEAR, but his son is totally afraid of everything. In a way, it's like a father trying to teach his son how to do his job. Of course, the son doesn't get it at first and takes time for him to learn the job. I see what they try to do in the movie and that's great writing.

Everything is done in CGI. All the monsters and locations are supposed to be sci-fi, so it's understandable that it would be like that. It's not the best CGI I seen, but it would do for this movie.

After watching this movie, I thought it's not that good. I wouldn't even say it's average. It started out great with the story they built up (forgetting about advance weaponry they should have), but they couldn't keep on delivering with the rest of the movie. It needed to be longer. They needed more background story. The plot needed to be bigger and better. They needed more characters!!! This movie could had been 4 or 5 stars, but it was the bare minimum to a even better movie that could had been.

I do NOT recommend this movie.",1373155200,50,5964,4.339013452914799

The kid must move his ass and recover a rescue beacon (which of course is the half of the ship that crashed far away..) and avoid being killed by an evil animal that tracks humans by their fear, and has been the most brilliant idea that some alien race of morons has been able to come up with to wage war to humans..

Don't you like it how these morons in some room somewhere come up with these stupid little phrases that are completely idiotic yet are invented with the idea of possibly sounding profound?
Fear isn't a choice, that's one of the dumbest things I've ever read anywhere.  COURAGE is a choice, not fear.  Living beings have fear, it doesn't matter how brave you are, even the bravest people in the world have fear if and when confronted with something that can kill them.  Fear is in biology, it's literally apart of human beings & humans cannot separate themselves from fear.  COURAGE is how you react to that fear.

To put stupid words on the front of movies like that not only gives false information about how human beings are in general, it also can depict how much intelligence has gone into the movie itself.

All you will need is a ""smart suit"" to keep you going, unless of course the temperature drops below zero.  But, why quibble with such details, M. Night Shyamalan and Will Smith seemed to turn this entire project over to young Jaden.  It's a coming out party essentially, a whimsical blend of the sci-fi films Jaden apparently likes, plus a nod to Moby-Dick, which it seems he had to read in school.

The story could have just as easily been set in Alaska or the High Sierra with father and son on a camping trip, menaced by an over-sized grizzly bear.  Father and son could have communicated with walkie-talkies or mobile phones as the son had to seek help on his own due to his father being too weak to move. Instead, we get a kind of post-apocalyptic earth that appears to be a throwback to an earlier Cenozoic era with over-sized condors, saber-toothed lions and simian troops.

There is kind of a nice moral to the movie about conquering fear.  I suppose a big white whale seemed like a good analogy to the over-sized insect known as Ursa in this film, although that wasn't what Moby-Dick was about.  You knew what was coming long before it happened.  There was surprising no tension in this film.  The only thing mildly disconcerting were the flashbacks.  There certainly isn't any far-reaching philosophical narrative as there was in Moby-Dick, just your standard survival tale set on Earth some 1000 years into the future long after human kind ceased to be part of the picture.",1372896000,5,1564,4.650909090909091

5771539,4,B00D2ZF24O,"The movie 'After Earth' seems to point that movie-making these days is moving away from a lot of the more introspective themes of the 2000s and becoming more epic and futuristic, a'la  80s and 90s.

'After Earth' is a mesmerising epic that follows a journey of a father and son on a spectacular but dangerous foreign planet, Earth.

Every great epic adventure would not be complete without some social commentary, but here such social commentary is only hinted at and ends up being redundant. There's a lot of this 'believing in yourself' ethos, which seems recycled from Bagger Vance, which he could of left at the desk of the 5 cent psychiatrist, but you're going to have to live with it, especially since the main enemy is an alien who can't see you, can only smell your fear (!)

That said, the main storyline is exciting; you never know what amazing but probably fatal creature will be encountered next, you're always on the edge of your seat, never really knowing what will strike, from where, and a tiny bit of intended horror that doesn't really add to the movie at all.

Probably the best thing to take from this movie is seeing how one generation underestimates the next, and the older ones find out those teenagers are a lot smarter than you think. The whole father-son conflict and resolution is really interesting, as is Smith's predictions of just what computers might be capable of in a thousand years.

I don't think so, as I know there are so many bad sci-fi movies out there, including ""Battlefield Earth."" But there is some campy fun to be had in John Travolta's turkey, which is not at least boring. ""After Earth"" IS boring, with a clich storyline, underdeveloped characters and wooden acting from the stars Jaden Smith and Will Smith (credited in that order).

Set one thousand years into the future, the film's contrived story follows the relationship between a military father and war hero Cypher Raige (Will Smith) and his underachieving son Kitai (Jaden Smith). They are the only survivors when a spaceship crash lands on Earth, from which humans migrated, having made it inhabitable by environmental pollution. With his father severely injured, the inexperienced son has to retrieve a communication device on his own, on the planet that is now hostile to humans.

With the original story idea provided by Will Smith, which is adapted for screen by Shyamalan and Gary Whitta of ""The Book of Eli"" fame, ""After Earth"" strives to be both a sci-fi action and father-and-son drama, but becomes none of them. You don't have much action here, and if there is, it is at best dull and thrill-less, with heavy-handed direction and passable effects. As a drama, the film is devoid of emotion, completely lifeless because of the stiff performances from the stars, who take their roles way too seriously.

The real life father and son combination have some family chemistry onscreen and the story is set well in the future when Earth has been abandoned and the human race has inhabited other planets.

The viewer is presented with some interesting scenes of a new world but the narrative is generally quite weak with a predictable sequence of events. At no point is the viewer truly challenged with any great suspense or dramatic turns/twists in the story. There are some anxious moments but the movie falls short with its basic plot of frustrated Ranger Cadet Kitai bonding with his distant and highly decorated Ranger father Cypher when they are marooned on planet Earth and Cypher is injured.

Kitai braving the dangers of wild Earth so they can both be rescued has an opportunity to prove he is a worthy qualified Ranger and in doing so hopefully earning the respect and approval of his father, which is a likable facet of the narrative.

5771546,2,B00D2ZF24O,"I'll try not to give the plot away but my overall opinion is that this is a mediocre rental at best.  I had high hopes for this movie as I'm a fan of post apocalyptic movies and futuristic movies.  Adding Will Smith's good acting to the mix had me thinking this was a sure hit.  Unfortunately-the movie follows his son Jaden Smith, whose acting skills are less than stellar.  Will Smith does start out in the movie with a majority of the scenes but 15 minutes into the film and his exposure is cut to a him communicating with his son through basically a wrist walkie talkie.  He is not involved in any of the action sequences in the movie and Jaden Smith's acting skills are not developed enough to carry a movie in my opinion. I can only assume he was cast in this movie as a favor to his father.  Will's performance as a strict futuristic military type father is just ok as his character is supposed to come across as a very strict-almost unfeeling father and yet it's just stiff acting at best.  And again-Jaden Smith's acting is just not all that good in my opinion.  He just lacks believability to me but he's young and I have hopes he'll master the trade as his father did.

While there are a few ""creatures"" in the movie-so much more could have been done with the premise of this movie yet the focus was generally on Jaden Smith's character rather than diving into the evolving of creatures on this planet.  If you are looking for a movie with a lot of action and sci-fi special effects-there are a few but this film falls short of what they could have done with this storyline.  If you're looking for a film with a deep meaning intertwined with the plot-this is not it.  If you're expecting another great film showcasing Will Smith's impressive range for acting-this is not it.

What you'll get is a movie starring Jaden Smith and a few shots of Will Smith as he speaks to his son through the radio communication device (so you hear his voice a lot).  It's not an awful movie but not the best and definitely not worthy of box office prices.  At best this is a rental-but keep in mind that you will watch this and realize there were better rentals available.

Just for reference-I'm not a picky reviewer and like a lot of films that seem to get bad reviews.  I also still enjoy films with stellar special effects even if the acting isn't the best.  This movie just doesn't have that for me.  I think watching 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, Battleship,  or John Carter is time better spent.",1371772800,263,2495,4.406113537117904
5771547,5,B00D2ZF24O,"Last weekend, I went with the family to go see After Earth. For the first time in a long time, I didn't read the critic reviews on the movie before I went to see it.

And I'm glad I didn't.

From watching the trailers alone, I expected to get nothing less than a good action/sci-fi/thriller movie. To my delight, that's exactly what I got.

There was a heartfelt message in this movie that was difficult to miss. I cried, smiled and giggled at some parts. I had the perfect movie-going experience. In short, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Okay, I'll do my best to write this review without giving away too much of the movie.

The thing I liked most about this film was the development of the father and son relationship. In the beginning, there was an obvious disconnect between Cypher--the father, and his family, more so with his son, Katai. Throughout the movie, flashes of the tragic backstory explained his emotionless demeanor and disconnect. He wanted to reconnect with his family again, and to do that he had to start with Katai. So he took Katai on an excursion, which turned out to be disastrous.

They crashed landed on earth. Now keep in mind, this is 1000 years later. The air was different. There were no buildings and roads, or subways and such. Nature had completely taken over, and animals, who were inferior to humans, ruled the planet. Some had even grown to massive sizes.

After gaining consciousness, Katai found his father alive, but fatally injured. That wasn't the just of their dilemma though. The beacon to contact their home station had been damaged, and the other beacon was on the tail of the ship, which was torn off during the fall, and was more than a few miles away from them. On top of that, an alien creature known to torment and kill humans, crash landed with them. This creature feeds off fear. In addition to fighting and fleeing from all the other threats on earth, Katai had to cast aside his fears and battle this creature.

It gave a new meaning to the term, `Man up!'

I was literally on the edge of my seat during many parts of this movie. There were some powerful and scary scenes that pulled all kinds of emotions out of me. I walked out of the theater glad I saw the movie. And YES, I will be purchasing it when it releases in bluray. I have to add it to my sci-fi collection.

When I got home, I looked up the critic reviews and was shocked at what I found. The critics totally ripped the movie apart. I couldn't help but think to myself, they couldn't have seen the same movie I saw.

I had the same experience with John Carter. The critics panned that movie and I absolutely loved it. I only wished I would've seen it in the theater. After I saw it and enjoyed it, I decided not to listen to the critics anymore.

Look, I understand the movie world is pissed at M. Night Shyamalan for what he did to The Last Airbender. I agree wholeheartedly that that flick was an epic fail, and I too was highly displeased because I'm a huge Avatar, the Last Airbender fan. But come on, let's not stay mad at the man. After Earth was a great comeback. It was a fabulous storyline and it played out very well. In addition to that, Will Smith and his son, Jaden were a dynamic duo.

Instead of listening to the critics, I suggest you go see the movie yourself and make your own judgment.",1371168000,16,3317,4.409165302782324

Just like they didn't understand the acting in the Star Wars prequals and Prometheus. So let me clue you in. These people exist in a very different reality than you do and thier societies are just as foriegn. They are acting the way they were intended to act. That's the point of those kinds of sci-fi movies. Everything is different and if you had even a hint of imagination you would get that. Dont be insulted just think about watching another genre of movie because sci-fi may not be for you!

Mr. Shyamlan follows a more direct format than in his previus outings and I enjoyed every minute of it! Will Smith plays a well known military commander who is ""distant"" from his son going any and everywhere the military sends him which is anywhere but home. His son is driven to attain his fathers status in spite of his fathers long absences. He also has issues with PTSD after watching his big sister die a brutal death at the hands of a bizzare creature. I don't remember the backstory on the monster. I'll have to watch again to see if it was there. When an accident goes down on the transport all of the sons' ""issues"" eventually come out loud and in your face. The commanders' face that is.

5771550,5,B00D2ZF24O,"I read so many negative reviews about this movie that I just had to see it, and I must say that I enjoyed it very much! I love the message about fear being a choice, the story about a father that knew his son so well (Despite not being around), that he could anticipate his moves, thoughts and feelings with incredible accuracy. That Will Smith could convey these feelings without much expression was something not many actors could do. I really felt his concern (to not say fear) at sending his son on a rescue mission that would either save or doom them.

The ending where Kitai finds himself was fantastic and both Will & Jaden Smith did an excellent job. As regards the earth itself... is was beautiful (deadly, yes) but lovely. I was so happy to see so many creatures roaming the hills, mountains and oceans again. I would love to see that in the future (minus the trying to kill us all part!). Of course this is only my humble opinion, but I really enjoyed this film, and look forward to seeing it again and again.

I think critics just desperately wanted a film to call the worst of the year, so naturally, pick on M. Night Shayamalan. But I can say I think he's back on the right track.
  After Earth is a touching and actually well made movie. It's only the robotic acting ""by Will Smith"" that Shayamalan is known to get out of his actors and that he's in love with own dialogue, that gets in the way. Shayamalan's is at his best since Signs though and I like how Kitai (Jaden Smith) has a history with the dangerous alien species he's stuck on Earth with.

The acting was Good, along with the message it presented to its viewers. Sound Effects and Visual was also good. However, something was lacking, and even Will Smith is not too happy with this movie, according to his recent interview. The movie had Good intentions, but it certainly was not like watching ""INDEPENDENCE DAY"" or ""MEN IN BLACK."" The story could have been more dramatic with additional action, and entertainment. If Will Smith is in a movie, I will watch it, but reality is, I found this one to be disappointing. It isn't as mysterious and powerful as many science fiction movies are, but I did enjoy the role of Will Smith's performance, and what the story portrayed.

5771562,5,B00D2ZF24O,"Whenever Shyamalan has a new film playing in the theaters the critics and the majority of their followers get ready to hammer the film-maker and his work. And what's even more repulsive is that they focus on the film-maker and intentionally they pay less attention on the film itself.  It's been an interesting year in films so far. - On and off, it's been impressive; I have some favorites of my own and few, sadly, that are not falling in the ""favorites"" category. - Shyamalan's After Earth, despite some of its weaknesses, falls in a charming manner in the `favorites' category. It's a surprise and can also be called a beautiful work in its own right. In other words, After Earth has managed to stay in my list and I can proudly say that it's a good film with an interesting plot. There are few reasons I believe After Earth is a good film; actually a better picture than some of the blockbusters of this year. I would like to put the spotlight on the originality and also on Shyamalan's method a little bit. Shyamalan still, audaciously, steps forward as an artist with a sense of originality, whereas some film-makers don't. I consider his methods smart as much as daring. And it boggles the mind as some don't see it. Shyamalan's work in Hollywood is against the current paradigm. - Some of the contemporary film-makers, yes, they're talented, but what they seek is to jump right on the opportunity to take on reboots and sequels so they can get their names labeled forever on a famous franchise. And when it comes to Shyamalan, he likes to stay in the corner, and from time to time, he throws a new spear right at a system that many are so used to. After Earth, interestingly puts its spiritual journey within the science fiction genre. Shyamalan still, as an old-fashioned auteur, manages to create a sense of tension. The atmosphere that we find Kitai (Jaden Smith) and his father Cypher Raige (Will Smith) turns the skin cold. Shyamalan injects that one famous sense, which is known as fear, through his eerie long shots. Often, in silence, we see the character on the screen introducing through their expression, of course, wordlessly, paranoia. And we, as audience, sense the impact of being hopeless. But, Kitai as a newbie manages to beat the odds. On screen and off screen, we hear Cypher guiding his son through a world that is no longer accepting mankind. It takes faith to make a Shyamalan type of film. To see and feel the senses of his characters; Cypher as a protective father understands the reality of the situation that he is in. He has no choice, but to guide his son through a world that is full of danger, where possibility of death is certain. After Earth manages to pull itself out with the help of its characters, dialogues, and Shyamalan's techniques and most importantly with the help of its unique atmosphere. The film, like I said, comes with some obvious weaknesses as well. And one of them is its opening shot, which I think has been executed in a rush manner. It gives audiences no choice to feel captivated with the world that Gary White has written. Though, the film emotionally grabs you once both Cypher and Kitai's ship crash lands on Earth. - One of the other weaknesses of the film is its 100 minute duration on the screen. I think what's necessary is that all film-makers before filming should find a pace. This brings to mind again that Shyamalan as a director does pretty well when he works on his own product. When it comes to pacing, and looking back at Shyamalan's previous films, I don't find any issues with the pacing of any of his films or with the opening shots. They are always engaging: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, Lady in the Water and The Happening.  He understands his own methods; he is the mechanic of his own workshop. Like many other fans, I'm looking forward to his next film; a screenplay that he's currently working on, which I think is going to be a low budget film. That sounds interesting to me. Even with some of its weaknesses and not so impressive CGI, After Earth still, in my book, manages to pull itself up in the list. After Earth can be pronounced as a good film and what saves it is Shyamalan himself. It's always interesting to view his work and in After Earth, we do see his methods of film-making. The techniques that he's so much in love with are all quite visible and understandable if seen a little more closely. .For those who like a simple story done with style, then check this out.

After the ship is forced to crash land on a hostile earth, Will, who is more commander than father, is injured and must direct his son remotely to retrieve the distress beacon from the tail end of the ship, 100 km. away. I felt I was watching ""Starship Troopers"" meets ""The Bone Collector.""

That's pretty much it. The trek had some numerous encounters with danger, but I found myself getting bored. Sorry Jaden. For a planet that freezes over every night it sure did have an abundance of green vegetation and animals. Anybody else scratching their head on that one?

On the plus side, this science fiction incorporates advances based on discoveries with nano technology. It is the next step in science fiction writing. Jaden's suit could sense a predator and would change color similar to my Nokia Morph concept phone sensing toxins on my apple.

5771565,3,B00D2ZF24O,"Will Smith averages one blockbuster per year. This time he's teamed with his son who is a chip off the old block(buster). Brace yourself!

Scriptwriter Guillermo del Toro takes us to our planet 1,000 years after humans had to evacuate. Directed by M Night Shyamalan, this PG-13 thriller tells us that ""Danger is Real, Fear is a Choice."" I'm not sure how I feel about THAT, but it proves to be a key factor in the survival of our two intrepid travelers. The critters who are the most deadly, can smell fear; if you can control your fear you become invisible to them.

We admire:
  * Will Smith (""Hancock""), who commands a space ship that crash lands on our deserted planet. Desperately hurt, he must depend on his son to reach the tail section of the space ship, which had broken off during the crash. The beacon to summon help is in that debris.
  * Jaden Smith (""Karate Kid"" 2010 ) is a young cadet (he wants to be a Ranger like his dad) who is tasked with a tough overland trek through dangerous terrain, nasty beasts, and hostile weather. Oh, and a dwindling reserve of supplies. He is frantic with fear.
  * Sophie Okonedo (Lots of BBC TV) is their lovely wife and mother; her sweetness and wisdom play perfectly here.
  * Zo Kravitz (""X-Men: First Class"") and yes, she's Lenny's daughter. Here she is daughter and sister to our heroes. She absolutely looks like a member of that family!

This is basically a two-man show that is targeted for an audience that likes action, scary beasts and edge-of-the-seat thrills; the females are only here to provide motivation. I'm not a part of that (Action) demographic, but it seemed to me that it scored a bullseye! (The screening audience applauded.)

The movie progressed at a good pace, I felt Will Smith's acting was not exaggerated and too emotional as in his previous movies. Jaden Smith succeeded in creating empathy for the character.

The general impression for me was that the movie was a very sound in the scientific sense of the word. A thousand years from now does seem like a reasonable time for the human race to exit the boundaries of earth, unlike ""2001, A Space Odyssey"", which missed the mark, or Smith's own ""I, Robot"", which predicted walking and talking robots by the year 2035.

But the real strength of the film comes in the lesson it teaches the viewers, where sometimes we are afraid of fear itself, and that letting go of these boundaries makes us invincible.

5771568,2,B00D2ZF24O,"So many actors reach a certain level of success, then make some movie dear to their heart just because they can - not because there's any great merit in the script itself. I think this is one.

It starts with all kinds of great pieces - son struggling to meet father's unrealistic expectations, danger-laden trek across unforgiving landscape, great acts of bravery, victory in the end. Somehow, though the two-actor format (the few other humans are really just props) turns a 100km trek into something claustrophobic. Then, Will Smith tries to channel his inner Laurence Fishburne, forgetting that Fishburne already does the job much better. Then there's the family relationship built around chain of command - trust me, this has more weirdness than even this flick can show. Then there's the whole notion of what 'fear' is and what purpose it serves. I've had my share, and find it to be a great way of focusing one's attention just when it's needed most.

Oh, it has its moments, like that wing-suited base jump. But a good movie is more than moments. Smith senior is a grownup and can do what he wants with his career. For Jaden: ""Good judgement comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgement."" I hope he can brush this off as a youthful indiscretion and find future success anyway.

I'm sure you want to know how he did it, so watch the movie to learn the craft of a true ranger. General's son, Kitia Raige, (Jaden Smith) goes on a trip with his father. On the way there though, the ship crash lands on Earth! Cypher's legs are broken and Kitia has to go far away to retrieve an emergency beacon! Can he do it? Would they be able to survive in this dangerous environment?

I loved ""After Earth""! This film was a mixture of everything that someone would want! It shows what can possibly happen to humans. I personally adore Will and Jaden Smith. Any movie where they are together makes it a fantastic and funny movie. What makes the movie better is that they play father and son, when in real life they are just that! Father and Son. What else was interesting is how many birds, animals and wales were in the movie clearly showing what our planet would be like without human interference.

There are also a few scenes with Cypher and his wife, Faia (Sophie Okoneda) where they have a very cute and adorable conversation and shows General's soft side. My favorite character would be Kitia. He is scared and frightened a lot in this film. He is alone at a young age, on unfamiliar Earth, one thousand years after humans left. It must have been scary! Kitia grows quickly and learns things on this hunt for the beacon.

My favorite scene is when Kitia does not listen when his father orders him to comeback knowing that something bad happens, and instead jumps off a very tall cliff and tries to make it to the beacon without proper gear. He gets chased and caught by a giant eagle that decided to ""adopt"" Kitia and even helps him along the way. Kitia's camera, that Cypher is using to see what's going on, gets destroyed and he must continue his journey without his father's guidance.

I recommend ""After Earth"" to ages twelve and up. This movie is very graphic and may be a bit too intense for younger kids. If you like adventure and action you would adore this movie! I give ""After Earth"" five out of five starts because it was so great in many ways.

5771572,3,B00D2ZF24O,"This review will probably be more flattering than deserved, due to my fondness for science fiction adventures. After Earth kept my attention, but I had to completely ignore the predictability (from M. Night? Who would have thought?). A reasonably decent Saturday matine movie that owes more than a little to Jurassic Park. Yet unlike its paleolithic predecessor, After Earth is in the hands of M. Night who has forgotten how to adequately build suspense. A few of the shocks were 80s style horror movie jump cuts -- the cheapest way to get an audience's attention -- and frankly everyone will know how the story will end after watching the first twenty minutes.

So no suspense, decent action. The acting? As a complete Will Smith fan, I have never seen a movie where his performance disappointed -- until this one. I know he had to play the stoic general/father, but there is a big difference between a stoic and a flat performance. Mr. Smith senior was reading dialog in a fashion more wooden than a bad high school play. Since the man knows how to act, the fault must lie with the script/director -- each of which were (surprisingly?) associated with M. Night. Jaden Smith is young and I hate to be unkind in my review of his acting. Let's just say that I hope he was as victimized as his father.

I now believe Shymalan has exhausted his bag of tricks. The writing of this movie lacks, and he even borrows a bit of his foreshadowing techniques from Signs, although less effectively.

Bottom line, if you enjoy a little questing adventure movie that has really nice cinematography, then go and have a good time. But your chances of finding a better movie than this are pretty high.",1370217600,4,1684,4.6632996632996635
5771573,2,B00D2ZF24O,"So this should make for an awkward dinner conversation at the Fresh Prince household. Before getting kicked to the curb at this weekend's box office, M. Night Shyamalan had entertained a notion that AFTER EARTH would be the first in a projected trilogy. He had the same aspiration for AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER. But here's the deja vu train rolling in: the withering reviews, the limp word of mouth, the inflated expectations, the crap end product. Will Smith... oh, damn, man...

It's another dystopian future. A thousand years from today, Earth is this abandoned place, long ago rendered uninhabitable by man's greed and obliviousness. Reinterpreting manifest destiny and left with no other recourse, man reached to the stars in a mass exodus; he spread out and colonized. Except that humanity's new settlements have fallen prey to the Ursa, frightening alien monsters that hone in on their victims' fear. A thousand years from today, Cypher Raige (Will Smith) is a Ranger and a living legend, his personal mythos built around his ability to quell his fear, thus rendering him invisible to the Ursa.

Cypher's teenaged son, Kitai (Jaden Smith), desperately wants to be a Ranger. He's haunted by the death of his sister at the hands of the Ursa. When the Ranger Corps dismisses Kitai's application, Cypher tries to console his son by bringing him along on a space voyage. In these family bonding moments, no one anticipates an asteroid shower.

Torn asunder, the broken spacecraft crashlands on a Class 1 quarantined planet: Earth. It's the most awful sort of homecoming. Terribly injured, Cypher dispatches his son to navigate the treacherous landscapes of Earth and recover the homing beacon located in the shorn tail end of their vessel. There's enough working tech that Cypher is able to remotely track and maintain communications with Kitai. Both learn soon enough that in the millennium that Earth's been left alone, evolution has not had a respite. Now, Kitai's Ranger skills will be put to the tes- oh, wait, that's right...

Let's not mince words, AFTER EARTH is a misfire. It's an exercise in tedious plotting and poor pacing and wooden acting. I'm seriously contemplating giving up on Shyamalan. At least Uwe Boll hasn't let me down yet. There is such an unrelentingly somber tone; it weighs the film down. This is primarily a two-man show. Except a concern is settling in me, a passing judgment that maybe Jaden doesn't have the acting chops to carry on the Will Smith brand. With his pops relegated to the backseat, Jaden is asked to shoulder the load. I really don't want to be mean-spirited. I don't want to dis the kid. But he doesn't show me anything. Just tons of furrowed brow action.

Should I mention the improbable science? One thousand years is a heck of a long time, but probably not long enough to produce the various mutated species that Kitai comes across. Or just how egregious were man's excesses that millennium ago?

I get it that the weird accents were supposed to reflect the gradual shift in linguistics. But the accents just didn't click with me. It didn't help that both Will and Jaden gradually began to slip in and out of their accents. It's like Drew Barrymore from EVER AFTER all over again, only I liked that movie.

I think it would've resonated more had Kitai stumbled across a decayed yet familiar landmark or two, just to hammer in that this really is f'ed-up future Earth. I'm not saying the Statue of Liberty half buried in sand or anything. But how about a desiccated Arby's or a really, really old Old Navy? As it is, absent of any ruined signposts to herald a once thriving human civilization, this story could just as well be taking place on an alien planet.

The most damning thing of all is that the film fails to maximize its greatest weapon, which is Will Smith. The screenplay, in portraying Cypher Raige as this distant and rigid and monotone super-soldier, dispenses with Will's natural wit and lively personality. By the way, ""Cypher Raige?"" For real? That name ticks me off. He might as well have called himself ""Brock Bacardi"" or ""Dirk Destiny.""

It feels indulgent. It feels like a vanity project. It feels like we're being exposed to an intrusive meta-statement of sorts. There's almost this element of voyeurism, as if we're paying to see the real-life Smiths play out their father-son therapy session on the big screen. It's an impression jarring enough that it kept yanking me out of the story. It may be time to unpin my ""In Will Smith we trust"" button, and maybe replace it with the ""In Uwe Boll we trust"" button.",1370217600,11,4583,4.813214739517154
5771574,5,B00D2ZF24O,"This is the kind of movie every father or male caregiver should take his son to see. It shows how the power of love and courage grows when the bond is under extreme duress. It allows all of us to wish we had a father or a son as brave as shown in After Earth!

This is not a typical science fiction story, so if you are going to enjoy it you will have to shut-down that thinking brain of yours. Your mind will want to have a thousand questions answered about the world created in After Earth. And those questions are not going to get answered!

This is also a many layered message movie. So if you are looking for constant and brainless adrenal rushes, like you got in the last two J.J. Abrams' Star Trek films, then you probably won't enjoy After Earth. But if you are like me, and you enjoy stories that are trying to challenge us to do better in the real world both with our relationships with those we love and with our environment, then you'll love After Earth!

There is a strong pro-environment theme that runs through this story. The most important being that life on earth does not need us human beings in any way, shape, or form to prosper! In fact, it's quite obvious the earth's creatures will do a lot better once we are gone. It's extraordinarily sobering to realize that with the notable exception of small groups of tribal humans, like the Native Americans once inhabiting North America before Columbus, our present-day human race simply doesn't know how to and/or care to live in harmony with the rest of nature. Something After Earth makes crystal clear!

5771575,3,B00D2ZF24O,"From my wife Sarah: We were never bored, but it never got great. I'd still say it was an okay movie. Not a first choice movie, but most radical sci-fi fans like me will still want to see it.

Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:

- The story held our interest throughout, though it never got really got intense.

- Will Smith has that quality that makes him a star.

- It was an interesting premise, though I think it could have been carried out much better than it was.

Cons:

- The story lacked depth. They showed backstories for the characters, but they were just not written and performed in a way that gets you really invested. It just didn't have that great writing and acting that makes a movie compelling and great.

- There were just so many, many plot holes in the story, that it kind of takes you into a state of continual skepticism. I found myself often questioning the realism of it. It's kind of what you'd expect from a B-Movie and not a headliner like this.

I don't want to give any major spoilers, so here's a minor example (spoiler alert): The earth freezes over every single night with such a deep freeze that it will kill a person if exposed, so how do all the trees, plants and animals on this lush, green surface live? There's never any explanation. It's just not believable. As I said, this is a minor example - but there are many big plot holes, conflicts and things that make no sense whatsoever.

- Will Smith played his character almost completely flat with almost little to no sign of emotion... While I understand why he may have chosen to do something like this based on the story, it was just too over the top flat. Will's a great actor and we're big fans, but it made it hard to get really connected to his character.

- The story really revolved around the young boy's character played by Jaden Smith. He was just okay, but honestly he wasn't strong enough to carry it off in a compelling way.

- CGI was not as convincing as it could have been. You're always aware that you're looking at computer generated images. That pulls you out of the fantasy.

So I was mildly entertained throughout, but the quality could have been much better. I can't say that this is a must see, but an okay choice if you've run out of better things to see.",1370131200,8,2269,4.335697399527187
5771576,4,B00D2ZF24O,"Although many people did not seem to like this 2013 movie, I thought it was decent.  OK, it was no award winner, but I enjoyed it and did not feel like I wasted my time (hour and a half approximately) or money.  It was obviously a Smith family film, with Will and son Jaden acting, Will and M. Night Shyamalan on the writing team, and Jada Pinkett Smith on the production team.  If I saw right, it was filmed in Costa Rica, Utah, and Southern California.

The time period is long after planet Earth (hence, the title ""After Earth"") has become desolate, and long after the aliens who fed on humans have eradicated the human race on Earth.  We meet the Rangers, a military command from another planet.  Young Jaden is a Ranger Cadet, but seems to have some issues and just cannot achieve Ranger status.  I believe they are fear issues holding young Jaden back.

I am guessing that Jaden is supposed to be around age 15 or so in the movie.  He has spent most of his life growing up without his dad, because dad was away on Ranger duty.  Jaden blames himself for his sister's death, so he is carrying heavy baggage.  When Will comes home, and before he retires, he takes Jaden off on a trip with him, to spend some guy-time together.  The plane hits an unexpected asteroid field and is forced to land on Earth, which is a dangerous place to be.  (All of this happens in the beginning of the film.)  The plane breaks in two pieces, about 100 kilometers apart and since Will is injured, Jaden must travel alone, but with Will guiding him from the ship.  The objective is to retireve a working distress beacon from the distant wreckage section and send the emergency signal for help.

Although the first part of the movie is a bit slow, Jaden's journey is where it takes off.  I would love to say more, but you have to watch the movie now.  The CGI was pretty neat as they successfully blended it with holograms, bio-technology, scenery, and animatronics.  Although young Jaden's performance was not exceptional, I thought he did a good job. He played a young man who needed to listen, learn, and face his fears. I believe the movie captures that nicely.

There are some great underlying messages in this storyline, the most penetrating being Will Smith saying to Jaden, ""Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.""  Will goes on to explain in a simple paragraph that fear is an illusion which does not benefit us and we must choose how we respond to it.  He explains to Jaden that he must ""live in the moment"" and that fear is a projection of future events that might never even happen.  THESE ARE VERY WISE WORDS.  There are also parts of the movie that imply the son is reading his father's mind.  You will also see the father has taught his son to stop, ground, and center himself.  There is also an amazing scene where one of nature's creatures repays a debt to Jaden.  Let me also mention the underlying message that the earth has become desolate because we failed to take care of it.

Nice movie. I do plan to buy the video when it comes out and watch it again.  I think the lesson about fear is priceless.  And although some reviews seem to want to bust Jaden out for not being as good as his father, I think the boy played his part well. When you watch the movie, I believe you will see that was part of the concept.  Instead of having a seasoned actor go out into the forbidden area, the boy character stretched himself to achieve above and beyond his fears and that added much to the story.  Actually, the more I think of the embedded messages in this movie, the more I like it.  Wouldn't it be great if we could all teach our children ""Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.""

6/9/13 - On a side note, yesterday, I found myself starting to worry about something and suddenly heard Will Smith's words to his son again.  He reminded me that fear is an illusion of the mind, where you are wasting time and energy getting upset over something that may never happen.  So I shifted my focus and went on about my business. . .",1370044800,31,4028,4.3741588156123825
