3724451,4,B001NY6YPW,"I think this film does a great job at showing many different types of people birthing differently. The camera is always on the birthing Mama, so you typically can't distinguish who the midwife, doula, mother, sister, neighbor or friend is. I like that the power is with the mama. Also, fathers have screen time and get to share their input---this is grand. I also like the order of the births.

This film is so powerful and empowering, that our community is screening this film as a fundraiser to help legalize midwifery in Missouri. [...]",1229558400,2,539,4.73404255319149
3724452,5,B001NY6YPW,"Having given birth 3 times already and been exposed to interventions immediately upon arrival of the hospital and even before, I wanted to view this film to make the best choices for my upcoming 4th birth.  This film provides a refreshing perspective that so often is lost and completely disregarded.  The meaning of ""natural birth"" has changed over the years and this film brings it back to its true meaning.  The strength and ability of our body to birth naturally has been lost and left out in many delivery rooms.  Discussion of intervention, c section, inductions and pain management are routine vs. discussion of individual strength, natural ability and benefits of less or no intervention.  I appreciated the statistics and information provided along with all of the wonderful personal experiences shared.  Seeing the support of the husbands as well as the active role of midwives and doulas really was beautiful and encouraged me to continue my own research in birthing options.  This is a must view for women who are truly wanting to know all of their options when it comes to birthing their baby.",1229472000,7,1106,4.945945945945946
3724453,5,B001NY6YPW,"I am grateful for this video presenting birth as pleasurable, ecstatic - orgasmic.  My own births, at home, were that way and it was impossible to talk about them.  There was no audience of 'understanding' thirty years ago.  My girlfriends were having hospital births with drugs, interventions and cesarean sections.  That was western culture's way.

At home and without drugs, natural hormones kicked in which contributed to the ecstasy.  I was high for years after the birth of my first child and it only got better and easier with the others.  I hope this 'best kept secret' is now out of the bag and that more women will experience the power and joy that I did.

This video is thorough and made with integrity.  The births are beautiful.  The interviews - Ina May Gaskin, Maureen Corry, Elizabeth Davis, Sarah Buckley, Marsden Wagner, Christiane Northrup among other - are helpful and engaging.  See for yourself.",1229472000,10,917,4.8896103896103895

I have been a Lamaze educator, doula, and nurse for 25 years+ and this movie presents possibilities to new mothers about their births that haven't been available to them ever before.  The message is honest and evidence-based.  I've heard some comments about the title but I can't imagine not honoring something as wonderful as orgasm when we continually hear about hemorrhoids and four hour erections.
Thanks for this wonderful teaching tool.  I am now using it in my classes and have had no negative comments.",1229472000,8,698,6.404255319148936
3724455,5,B001NY6YPW,"I first viewed Orgasmic Birth last June at a screening for professionals in Portland Oregon.  I watched it as a doula, a mother and a mentor and it both overjoyed me and saddened me.  The missing piece of our modern birth practice is pleasure, and mention the word...eyes roll and the sarcasm starts.  Orgasmic Birth shows real birth settings, real women and men, and it serves to encourage, enlighten and educate in a positive way...to counter the negatives we see in popular culture and in the news so frequently.  I ask all my clients to watch Orgasmic Birth, even, and especially, the ones who are birthing in a hospital setting, so they can see the organic process take place and balance their fears with the truth...birth can be beautiful, peaceful and fulfilling. Thank you for this beautifully made film.",1229472000,6,812,4.820143884892087
3724456,5,B001NY6YPW,"Orgasmic Birth takes a provocative look into the possibilities of what birth can be, not typical medical-model birthing, but normal, natural, even blissful birth.  First-time filmmaker Debra Pascali-Bonaro has captured on film intimate and tender moments which offer us insight into the true nature of birth, and the creating of mothers, fathers, and families.  As a midwife, doula, childbirth educator and the mother of five children myself, I highly encourage everyone to buy this film - and show it to your daughters!  It will truly open your heart to what birth can and should be like - sensual, beautiful, empowering, and ecstatic.",1229472000,5,636,5.215686274509804

3724530,5,B001NY6YPW,This is an excellent documentary! It is very needed and powerful to see a different kind of birthing experience. I thought it was very valuable to know that my birth of my son could be sensual and wonderful. I loved this documentary.,1494201600,,233,4.571428571428571
3724531,4,B001NY6YPW,It was educational on how giving natural birth can be pleasant. My wife and I had attended natural birth classes and because of this video we decided to do a home birth. The birth was amazing and my wife had a couple of complications that the midwifes took care of immediately.

3724534,2,B001NY6YPW,Tgis movie contains good info but it's available from other sources in a more concise manner. Gives the intrviewees a chance tell their stories. Still the movie didn't tell us anything we hadn't already learned. If you are completely in the dark about birth this may be a good place to start but if you've read any of Ina May Gaskin's work or attended a birth class with a midwife there probably isn't anything new here. If you are juat looking to hear other women's birth stories it may be worth while for you too.,1485129600,,515,4.431578947368421
3724535,5,B001NY6YPW,This is a wonderful movie to watch with your partner while preparing for birth. Very informative.

3724561,2,B001NY6YPW,"I was referred by a homebirth midwife to watch this. I'm very pro-natural and having that amazing birth experience without being traumatized. That being said, I don't think I believe in ""orgasmic birth"" in the sexual way that has been described in the documentary. Some of the women in this documentary just feel as if they're overacting to the camera and it just turns me off from the whole experience. A better title for this should have been ""Blissful Birth"" or something similar as most of the cases related on here talk more about the joyful experience they had, completely unrelated as a sexual experience. However, it is fairly informative and would be a good watch for someone interested in knowing more about home birth and an unmediated birth experience without the interventions used commonly today. It's a good watch but I felt it was overly sexualized.",1470009600,2,865,4.891156462585034

The documentary shows how some women are finding a more positive mindset for their births and trying to have a more pleasurable labor experience. It also shows interesting clips of baby-friendly hospitals in Europe and explains what the baby-friendly label means. It was informative and moderately interesting.,1461024000,,432,5.367647058823529

Women have abdicated their physical and spiritual power for far too long to the ""gods"" of the modern age:  doctors and technology.  The price of this abdication has been the lives of many women and children, but also a societal loss of consciousness of the sacredness of our inherent power and life force.  If all women could have access to this information, we would have a very different world.  We would have scores of women empowered to have faith in themselves and also to be fierce mothers and who would be guided by intuition and love, instead of fear and powerlessness.",1437177600,,641,4.888888888888889
3724643,5,B001NY6YPW,"For some reason, I hate the title of this film. It isn't about having an orgasm while delivering. It is really about what birth can be without medication or intervention. I would recommend it for folks who are apprehensive and want exposure to non-scary, non-emergency, non-Hollywood births. I think this film can be really helpful in that way. So much of people's birth experience are shaped by their expectations (as well as the support they get).",1435536000,,449,4.921052631578948

3724646,4,B001NY6YPW,"A good look at different births. I was not really convinced about the ""orgasmic"" part, especially after giving birth myself. But, I think hearing from women about their births is really powerful and honest. It also shows that you can have a long difficult birth when doing it at home or a quick, easy birth in the hospital. The birth with the forceps was very eye-opening and showed me how agressive some interventions can be. I think this video helps women better understand what births with and without interventions look like. I also want to let women know that it is possible have a minimal intervention birth at the hospital if you find a good doctor and go into birth knowing your options. I gave birth without drugs and using Hypnobabies in the hospital. It was a beautiful and empowering birth.",1427068800,,802,4.695035460992908

3724674,5,B001NY6YPW,Awesome movie,1424390400,,13,6.0
3724675,2,B001NY6YPW,"I was really hoping to like this movie. It was recommended by one of the doula's we interviewed but did not select. My wife is expecting her first child, and would like to have a natural child birth. Unfortunately, this movie did NOT make her feel more at ease about natural child birth. While we agree with the thesis of this movie, that child birth doesn't have to be painful, and can even be an enjoyable (if intense) experience, this movie is more about spreading fear of hospitals than it is about the pleasure of birth.

The directors have specifically cut the movie to advance their thesis, and completely fails at preventing a balanced view to the reader. As such, I think it does more harm than good to the movement to have natural child birth. The movie completely fails to prevent solid evidence for various practices. For example, the movie demonizes induction, however the evidence shows that induction is actually better medicine, particularly for women over 41 weeks. (See: http://www.cochrane.org/CD004945/PREG_induction-of-labour-in-women-with-normal-pregnancies-at-or-beyond-term)

The film also quotes one father at some point stating that if you go to the hospital you have a 1 in 2 chance of having a c-section. However the statistics show that actually it is much closer to 1 in 3: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/delivery.htm thus spreading unnecessary fear. The film even has  a mother who gave birth in the hospital and had a very nice experience, but the film spends far less time with this mother than it does on the couple giving birth on their deck, or in the water.

In the end, I think this is a BAD film that does more to spread fear of child birth than it does to spread birth positive stories. I really WANTED to like this movie, but in the end I think this movie is more about spreading fear of going to the hospital than it does spread birth positive stories. Don't waste your time. Spend your time reading one of Ina May Gaskin's books instead, or the Birth Partner. This are much better resources which discuss the problems in the US health care system without spreading FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, and DOUBT (FUD) about being in the hospital. I have several friends who had very satisfying, natural birth experiences in US hospitals, and I am confident that with my support, and the support of our Doula the same will be true for my wife.",1423958400,,2368,4.883084577114428
3724676,5,B001NY6YPW,"I liked the movie, but the concept is ridiculous.  I found it helpful to watch before I had my baby, but once labor started I realized that an orgasmic birth was definitely not possible... at least not for me.  It's funny now to think about it now.

3724681,5,B001NY6YPW,"Loved the dvd. Very wholistic in its approach; it doesn't strictly talk about orgasmic births but all kinds and how one can have a good experience with nearly every scenario. The ""birth by numbers"" (extra features)  was at times hard to follow and abit dry but still very informative. The dvd is a must watch. More mothers/mothers to be need to know about the truth about the health care system vs birthing babies.",1410393600,,414,4.671232876712328
3724682,4,B001NY6YPW,Very interesting- I kind of doubt my own birthing experience will be like the ones in the movie. It was helpful to see different types of experiences that I had not often heard of. Thought provoking in it's own way.,1409529600,,215,4.4

3724697,5,B001NY6YPW,This is a good film. While moments seem personal and so a little awkward to watch it's a good DVD for learning about natural birth and what goes on in hospitals. More people need to understand these things the first time around. At least just to be open and informed.,1397692800,,267,4.36
3724698,5,B001NY6YPW,A must view for those parents wanting to see positive birth stories. We are bombarded with birth horror stories in our culture and it was nice to see some happy stories where women feel empowered and proud of their births.,1397606400,,222,4.575
3724699,5,B001NY6YPW,A very inspirational movie about how birth can be if given the right circumstances. Birth doesn't have to be feared or painful. This film reminds you of that.,1396742400,,158,4.678571428571429
3724700,5,B001NY6YPW,"This film is an hour and a half long, people. Please watch it and enjoy it for yourselves rather than listening to the negative reviews. There is nothing fringe or ""wayyyyyyy out there"" about the child births in this video, as one review mentions- unless you feel that giving birth naturally, without unnecessary medical intervention, the way that a woman is meant to give birth and the way that woman have been doing it for thousands of years is ""out there."" Nothing even remotely close to pornographic in this film, either (another criticism). Nude women are shown because *that's how women give birth*. and also how they have sex and get pregnant in the first place, yeah?

This is a very positive, informational, and encouraging film for anyone who wishes to avoid unnecessary, sometimes risky medical intervention and simply have a child the natural way that women are meant to have children.

Women are taught far too often that child birth is some scary thing to be feared- that the pain of child birth is to be avoided at all costs. This film does a nice job of reminding us that the entire birth process-- the pain, struggle, moans, screams, cries, joys, laughter, etc.-- is one that is meant to be experienced as a whole, and one that women are, in fact, built for. I feel empowered to have a natural birth after watching this film.",1396051200,8,1342,4.682203389830509
3724701,5,B001NY6YPW,"I loved this movie and watched it several times while I was pregnant. It is very inspiring!  I did not have an orgasmic birth, but believe it's possible! I also feel great about the birth I did have and partly bc of the beauty of this film.",1393718400,,240,4.1063829787234045

Maybe if you were at the beginning of your research journey about birth and babies it would be informative, but I didn't find it to be. It was nice that it showed several different kinds of births ranging from hospital births, to a home birth on a deck, to a truly ""orgasmic birth"" in a tub, however, there was only this one ""orgasmic birth"" in a documentary entitled the same and I truly question how real that was.

I watched it with my husband so he could be prepared for our upcoming home birth; it will be my third, his first. He even enjoyed watching the movie! I felt that it showed the beauty, power, and strength of the birthing experience and gave insight to the importance of letting a woman be in her natural element, as opposed to constant intervention (unless needed). Overall, I thought this movie was a good way of bringing to light the intimate nature of the birth process and believe that most (open-minded) people would benefit from watching this documentary.",1389398400,,638,4.916666666666667

In persuasion speeches, one must build credibility and use evidence to support argumentation. One has to convince the skeptical and use logical reasoning. One must stay far away from the logical fallacies so commonly used in our media today. From both sides of the aisle in politics we hear arguments, but they are laced with logical fallacies. This is the norm of our mainstream media, the Day of true Watchdog Journalism style ethics requires a current college graduate degree to use forensic research to find in our world of trash, deception, and fallacies.

Its okay to have a bias in a persuasion argument, but ethics and critical thinking should be engaged.

Now the rewarding arguments from this piece, the whole idea of intimacy with pregnancy was very touching and beautiful. That pregnancy can be a lovely experience was certainly convewed. However, attack on hospitals was mean and bruttle. I know hospitals in USA have problems, but their are many in the medical field that use hospitals that have genuine love for their ability to restore health to people.

A better persuasion is without bias and give equality to both sides, hospital births (which if there is a problem with a mother, the hospital is the best way to give birth) and nonhospital births (which can be intimate and lovely to our fundamentals of our species).",1360713600,,1422,5.016949152542373

Many people freak out thinking there can be something that goes wrong but that's FAR from the truth.
Our bodies were made to have many babies in its lifetime. It was designed perfectly by God to do this job--something no man can ever do. And I believe all women would actually enjoy the experience of giving birth if the TV and movies would keep from makeing birthing such a disaster.
Another video you might want to check out is ""Birth as We Know It."" which also give very good advice and explains that women who are not inturupted giving birth and do not have a C-section will not have post partom depression.

3724772,5,B001NY6YPW,"The Orgasmic Birth movie was beyond moving for me. I found myself sobbing through most of it and for about an hour afterwards. It brought up many things that I had not dealt with yet. I felt grief at seeing women actually supported, comforted and loved while giving birth - even to the point of having multiple orgasms.

Mostly I felt sadness that I was so out of touch with myself during both my births. While I had my son without drugs, it was primarily by accident because my labor was so early and short. By the time I reached the hospital, I was already dilated to 10 and literally was told I needed to wait for the doctor to push. I did not take any birthing classes and put all my trust in my beloved male doctor, who was 86 when he delivered my daughter.

I intended to go natural with my daughter, but had someone pushing an epidural every few minutes. She was also several weeks ""late"" so I was given Pitocin to induce my labor, which was scheduled around my doctor's golf game.

Not knowing how long my labor would last (under 3 hours again), I gave into fear and got one. I immediately regretted it. I literally could not feel myself push and didn't know what was going on beneath the blanket at all. That epidural and circumcising my son remain my two greatest regrets in life.

I believe Orgasmic Birth causes you to be at one with yourself because you have to do the work ahead of time. When I had my children, I was certainly not prepared for giving birth and I was definitely not living in peace. My partner at the time was an addict, and there was no time to explore myself, let alone positive birth stories. I wish someone would have told me about Orgasmic Birth instead of Al-Anon.

Initially, I felt grief-struck that I missed this healing birthing experience with both my children. We do the best we can with what we know at the time, but I feel anger towards a medical system that perpetuates unnatural birth.

My daughter will know about Orgasmic Birth. I will be there for her in all the ways I wish someone had been there for me. And, hopefully, she will be more healthy and in-touch with herself and her partner when she decides to have children than I was.

The end of the movie was also very powerful (when she talks about not sharing positive birth stories because of not wanting to make other women feel bad). We need these stories. Watching this movie was painful for me. However, it was over in a few hours. Not watching it would have resulted in more pain, stretched out. Our culture is so filled with distractions and it is easy to skip over the grieving we need to do. Sometimes the stories of other women are healing in and of themselves. Sometimes we need to actually feel that pain in order to heal.

For all those who shared their stories so openly and generously in this movie, I thank you. The result was beautiful, informative and healing.",1339632000,,2882,4.404135338345864

If you are a hard core western ""gimme the epidural before I feel any hint of pain"" pregnant woman don't bother watching this.

3724783,5,B001NY6YPW,"Beautifully done.

From the root... grows the tree ... which bares the fruit. It's impossible to disassociate child birth from sexuality, as it is a direct result rooted in sexuality itself.

As women, many of us have been taught to suppress emotions and feelings - we're told they make us appear weak and out of control.  ""Restraint! Self control!"" they say. I call BS.  This is what makes us strong.  This is what connects us to the Creator. If giving birth naturally brings you to spontaneous orgasm, then you're obviously doing something right. I would certainly prefer this over self-induced lower body numbness.

I have great respect for the women who have the courage to make their own educated decisions and to share their experiences without inhibition. Without fearing what others may think.  They have completely rejected the hierarchy of power that is part of this American Myth, and they choose to live by the rules of nature that sustain us all. Natural birthing is not a trend.  It's the way it has been done for the entirety of human and non-human existence.

3724785,4,B001NY6YPW,"I consider myself to be a fairly mainstream type of gal.  I am a natural birth advocate and cesarean mom.  I was a bit leery of the movie because of the title.  However, the OB website defines orgasmic as """"[i]ntense or unrestrained excitement or a similar point of intensity or emotional excitement.""  It's important to read this statement with the word ""or"" clearly in mind.  You don't have to orgasm to have an orgasmic birth if you read the definition this way.

What I particularly like about this movie:
* beautiful homebirth stories
* interviews with experts (midwives, educators, OBs, medical researchers, epidemiologists)
* not all of the hospital births shown ended in cesarean
* a sexual abuse surviver is featured
* birth stories showed pleasure, pain, fear, excitement, extacy, the works!

What I didn't like as much about the movie:
* a mainstream watcher or anyone who is skeptical may be turned off immediately;  IMO, the watcher could be ""eased in"" a bit better to the concept of the movie
* it bothers me that all of the homebirths were wonderful and the hospital births weren't; I know that the medical model is the dominant paradigm right now, and that the natural physiologic model needs to be given back its power, but I didn't like the ""either/or"" presentation

The Business of Being Born is probably my favorite birth movie, but this one is important to watch too.  I think the idea of transformation is often missed, and this movie brings that into focus.",1294012800,37,1480,4.791338582677166

When they say ""orgasmic birth,"" I  feel they are trying to explain an undefined feeling that occurs when birth happens. Birth is sexual and many people fail to realize that. This documentary celebrates that fact. Like sex it can be clumsy at first but once you get the hang of it you're set. Many women orgasm during labor. The film is not telling you to ""get off on your child's birth."" The film is describing the incredible and pleasurable feelings that occur within your mind and body while birth is happening. There's pain from the contractions, slight pleasure from the pushing, and something else you cannot describe. The indescribable feeling is the ""orgasm."" It is an unearthly feeling to give birth naturally. Besides the sexual orgasm of birth can't always be avoided seeing as the baby's huge and passes over you g-spot(it's a matter of sensitivity I think.) Some women have it, some don't, and only one person actually feels it in the film. She kind of goes on forever. Other than that the film is sweet, funny, difficult, and spiritual.

This important film addresses the issue of fear, and that childbirth should not be a fear-driven process and absolutely can be trusted and welcomed. The women presented in this film are not just those who happen to experience ""easy"" labor and childbirth, they are all kinds who do experience pain also.

These experiences are so rare in a hospital setting, because of the intrusions and overly interventionist approach that is typical of that setting, but quite possible in a natural environment.

This film was instrumental in educating me more about home birth and natural birth.

This film gently takes your hand, walking you down the path of a new way of seeing birth and women's bodies, in a way that is not preachy or intended to frighten.  The experts featured in this film, including several MDs and OBGYNs, are phenomenal.  This film IS about orgasmic birth, but understands ""orgasmic"" as akin to ""ecstatic;"" the film seeks to convey the message that birth can be and is, for many women left to birth on their own terms, an event not filled with horror but with extreme joy, pride, and triumph.

In the end though, this film gives women the empowerment they need to give birth without drugs. Not as suffering heroines/martyrs but as strong, capable women. What is happening in the labor and delivery wards all over this country right now is that unnecessary interventions and stress are harming women and creating expensive and traumatic birth experiences - Pitocin, C-sections etc. Clueless OB/GYNs (and sometimes midwives also) seem to feel like they HAVE to do something in the birth process when WHO's recommendations for normal births (80% of all births) is to do LESS; to offer support and love but not stress the birthing mother the way have seen it be done countless times.

3724808,5,B001NY6YPW,"The main point of this documentary, is that if a woman gives birth naturally without medical intervention, she can indeed experience orgasm during the birthing process. It's explained that an orgasmic birth experience is possible, if nothing (such as drugs given to mothers in labor at hospitals) impedes the flow of a woman's hormones, that her body produces when she goes into labor. And these hormones, can produce powerful feelings of euphoria, which can lead to orgasms during labor and delivery.

Several women are shown going through natural childbirth at home, and at birthing centers. When they were interviewed, they gave glowing testimonials about their ecstatic birthing experiences, which included orgasms. Other women were interviewed, who had given birth in hospitals. None of these women who gave birth in hospitals, spoke of their birthing processes as being euphoric in any way.

Midwives were interviewed as well. And they emphasized that women should take back their right to give birth naturally, instead of having to do so in a hospital. The midwives also explained that the explosive increase of cesarean births, have been a direct result of induced expedited labor, which is customary when a woman has a baby at a hospital. And it's a fact that cesarean births, often result in serious complications, including the death of the mother, and/or child.

I think that all expectant mothers, should see this superlative documentary. Then they'll know that their childbearing experiences, can include ecstasy, instead of only pain.",1262476800,2,1549,5.288617886178862

3724810,1,B001NY6YPW,"As an ex-doula who has attended birth as a sole birth attendant, this is not a film I would recommend. The authors of the film took a term and concept well known in radical midwifery circles-- ""orgasmic birth: the nine month orgasm""-- and applied it to a film that is about three-percent on the subject of orgasmic birth: A two minute clip of renowned midwife, Ina May Gaskin, giving a statistic from a survey she had taken amongst women who had birthed with midwives. The statistic of women who had experienced orgasm during labor and birth was much higher than she had anticipated-- in the twenty-plus percent range.

There was talk about how birth is sensual, and orgasm is possible during birth. However, the examples of birthing in the film were mostly not examples of an orgasmic birthing experience. There was one orgasmic birth documented, and quite frankly it appeared to me to have possibly been an acting job on the part of the woman. What this film does contain is documentation of a mix of what I would describe as normal, healthy home births with several women. Births which ranged from easy, quick labors to relatively long labors. And two hospital births, one of which was downright traumatizing to watch. Scare tactics on pregnant women are not the way to improve birth. Having women who have had traumatic births tell their stories, without the actual visuals of a traumatic birth, is, in my opinion, far more effective in educating women about what they will be in for in a planned, non-emergency hospital birth.

It concerns me that this film offers the idea of ""birth methods"" and an orgasmic goal for birth, rather than emphasizing the physiology of natural birth and what is required to make birth safest overall. One midwife in the film, as well as a man from the World Health Organization, do offer comments on the physiology of natural birth and what is required for it to be safest: quiet, low-lights, few to no interruptions, uninhibited movement, as few people as possible, drinking and eating by mother on her own. The film misses emphasizing this, though. It left me feeling it was shallow in its attempt to educate, and confused me as to what it was really trying to achieve. Capitalize on sales with a radical title, or encourage women by documenting how safe home birth truly is?

The film's most redeeming moments are contained in the few-minutes long story of a childhood sexual abuse survivor/adult rape survivor who birthed with a midwife at home. Because she was able to birth uninterrupted at home, her birth became a most empowering moment for her. In this portion of the film, they have a short clip of DONA founder and natural childbirth advocate/researcher Penny Simkin, talking about the special concerns for female sexual abuse survivors at the time of birthing their children. She suggests the hospital environment and their policies to interrupt natural birth to ""check"" the baby and mother were particularly detrimental to the abuse survivor. Another redeeming moment was a clip of one of the other home birth mothers saying how her birth with her second child at home made her feel very proud.

This film does not, in my opinion, live up to its title. Nor does it, in my opinion, significantly help increase any woman's odds of having a better birth by watching it. There are much better documentaries on home birth available, even the very mainstream ""The Business of Being Born"" documents births that I feel would be more encouraging to any mother-to-be.  The Midwifery Today website, as well as DONA International website, has many of those other documentaries available. Your local public library may have some of them, and certainly a local midwife will have them available for her clients to watch.

Bottom line, if you want to increase the odds of having a pleasurable and safe birth, my highest recommendation to anyone would be to read any and all books by Michel Odent: ""The Farmer And The Obstetrician"" is my favorite. And Frederick Leboyer's classic ""Birth Without Violence."" From a woman who has worked with birthing mothers, I can attest to this as a fact: birth can be elegant. It can be perfectly safe for the greatest majority of women, especially at home or in a natural birthing center, without unnecessary interventions by either an obstetrician or midwife.",1249344000,148,4327,4.872282608695652

Well, birth is not really like that, even if you do have complications!

3724835,5,B001NY6YPW,"As a supporter of undisturbed birth, I've waited a long time for a film like this!  Orgasmic Birth is much more than a film about how to experience pleasure in birth.  It's about viewing birth as a natural bodily function, rather than an inherently dangerous, painful medical event that needs to be managed, controlled and medicated.  It's about tapping into our own natural resources, instead of turning ourselves over to the medical establishment to ""save"" us from ourselves.  Any natural bodily function proceeds best when it's done in privacy, and this is what the women in the film advocate.  Unfortunately, most members of the medical profession pretend that birth isn't sexual, yet it involves the same hormones, organs and emotions as sex.  When we recognize the inherent sexuality of childbirth, overcome our fears and inhibitions, and keep strangers away as much as possible, birth CAN be ecstatic if not orgasmic.  It certainly was for me.  I highly recommend this film, and know it is destined to change the way society views our most intimate act of creation.  We do NOT have to choose between a medicated, medically managed birth and a painful, difficult ""natural"" one.  There is a third choice and Debra Pascali-Bonaro has found it!",1229731200,5,1247,5.009708737864078
3724836,5,B001NY6YPW,"It's not very often that a book or movie comes out that has the potential to directly change people's lives, but ""Orgasmic Birth"" is such a movie.  Debra Pascali-Bonaro's film is monumental in it's message for women everywhere: birth can be empowering, transformative, and even pleasurable!  The film chronicles the pregnancies, labors, and births of about 10 families, and does an awesome job of depicting the diversity of an empowering experience: homebirths, birth center births, hospital births, water births, and families of different races, religions, and customs.  Additionally the film includes the story of a mother who was sexually abused as a child and a young adult, and she shares that ""My birth became the most powerful thing that's happened to my body...and I was transformed.""  The women's stories also depict that birth can be spiritually orgasmic, emotionally orgasmic, or even physically orgasmic -- but the point being that regardless of the orgasmic element itself, it can be orgasmic period!  What a crucial message for the young women of our society!  We've been raised to believe that childbirth is the most painful thing a woman will ever endure -- how much healthier and how much more hopeful is it to instead believe that birth is something to be treasured and ENJOYED?!

I recently hosted a screening of ""Orgasmic Birth"" at my school, the University of Missouri.  It was WILDLY successful, with over 100 people in attendance -- everyone from the local midwives, to professors to feminists, to mothers, to college women, to freshmen boys!  Following the film, I hosted a panel of mothers and professional midwives to answer audience questions -- the questions poured in for 45 minutes!  I've been hearing rumoring about a new campus organization: Med Students for Home Birth!  One woman stood up and announced to the auditorium that this movie had changed her life forever -- ""I know what I want now -- I want to have my babies at home with a midwife!""  Another woman wrote a paper about the film, and still another created a project about the film for her Psychology of Women class.  I just heard that someone else bought the film online after seeing it and is giving it out as Christmas presents!

Do yourself a huge favor -- SEE THIS MOVIE.  Especially if you are a woman of childbearing age!  KNOW your options before you get pregnant!  Find out what's right for YOU!  I'm sure many people reading this review have seen ""The Business of Being Born,"" which is also incredible.  I would distinguish the two by simply saying this: BOBB shows birth they way it is.

8328266,5,B001NY6YPW,I felt that this was a good introduction to exploring the possibilities of having a positive birth experience. It dissipated a lot of my fear and made me feel more relaxed and confident about the birth process.,1515369600,,210,4.702702702702703
8328267,4,B001NY6YPW,"I liked it, but not as expected. I think the title is a bit misleading. I thought it would deal more with the science of anatomy that would make this possible, but instead, this documentary is more a bunch of positive birth stories. Still good, still worth watching, but nothing earth shattering - especially if you've already read books like Ina May's Guide to Childbirth.",1508371200,,373,4.753846153846154
