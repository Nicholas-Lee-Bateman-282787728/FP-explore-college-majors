8055204,1,B000818VG6,This was the worst parently video i have seen yet. It was an absoulte joke. I think PBS could have given me more insiteful information. I really think the person who wrote the review before me works for the people who created this crap. Not to mention this video was only 28 minutes. 28 minutes for $20 dollars what a rip off.,1313366400,,326,4.274193548387097
8055205,4,B000818VG6,"It's great to see a DVD which targets the needs of 1st time Dads. It demonstrates important practical skills such as how to change a nappy, bathing, dressing and feeding a new born baby in a humorous way. It also discusses the enormous impact that caring for a new born has on new parents and gives tips on how to adjust to this life changing experience. A very entertaining and inspiring DVD which goes a long way to help alleviate the anxieties of 1st time dads.",1246060800,,464,4.406976744186046
