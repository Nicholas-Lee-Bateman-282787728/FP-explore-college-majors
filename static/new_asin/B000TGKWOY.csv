2899425,3,B000TGKWOY,Lots of dark night scenes that are difficult to see and the story lines are very similar but yet I found myself enjoying them.  The acting wasn't too bad for the era it was filmed.,1267228800,,180,4.142857142857143

2899427,5,B000TGKWOY,"Before I explain why EVERY Gene Autry fan should have DVDs like these in his or her collection, let me clear up a misconception. This product has absolutely NOTHING to do with the Gene Autry TV Show.

This set of two DVDs contains 10 Gene Autry movies which millions of little buckaroos used to watch at their local theaters on Saturday afternoons in the 1930s, '40s and early '50s. The films range in length from 54 to 70 minutes.

By contrast, The Gene Autry TV Show was 30 minutes long and was broadcast in the 1950s.

While the quality of the DVDs in Gene Autry Collection, Vol. 1 by Pop Flix is not quite as good as you'll find in Autry's own company's releases or on the Encore Westerns Channel, it's not bad for the price. After all, how can you beat 10 Gene Autry movies for 69 cents apiece?

And this set contains a real plus for Gene Autry collectors -- Autry and sidekick Smiley Burnette's first screen appearances. That took place in 1934 when they appeared as dance band members in the Ken Maynard (and Gabby Hayes) film ""In Old Santa Fe.""

Autry and Burnette did not even receive screen credits in this film, but soon after, Autry began his meteoric rise to the top of Hollywood's film attractions.

Gene Autry fans -- and there are probably millions of us still around -- can't go wrong having this set of films in our collections.",1236297600,44,1346,4.451219512195122
2899428,5,B000TGKWOY,"I enjoy watching this pioneer in the western Movie industry. These shows were very well done and moviing Pat Buttram was an excellent sidekick for comic relief. The Gene Autry Show was an American western/cowboy television series which aired for 91 episodes on CBS from July 23, 1950 until August 7, 1956.

Gene Autry had already established his singing cowboy character on radio and the movies. Now he and his horse Champion were featured in a weekly television series of western adventures. Gene's role changed almost weekly from rancher, to ranch hand, to sheriff, to border agent, etc. Gene's usual comic relief and sidekick, Pat, was played by Pat Buttram, better known to later television viewers as ""Mr Haney"" on ""Green Acres"". During the first season, Gene's sidekick was played by Chill Wills twice (as Chill) and by Fuzzy Knight four times (as Sagebrush). These two actors even wore Pat's costume. Alan Hale, Jr. (a.k.a. - ""The Skipper"" from ""Gilligan's Island"") played a bad guy in several episodes of Seasons 1 & 2, but he also played Gene's sidekick, Tiny, in two episodes of Season 1.

By this time, Gene Autry had established his own production company ""Flying A Pictures"" and acted as executive director for the series.

The series lasted 5 seasons. The first 4 were in black and white, and the final season was in color. Color was experimented with in two or three episodes of the first season. The theme song Back In The Saddle Again was written by Gene Autry & Ray Whitley and sung by Gene Autry.

The Gene Autry Show had a 26 episode Saturday morning spin-off called The Adventures of Champion in 1955.

Gene Autry's feature films in the late 1940s and the 1950s often included cast members from his TV show.",1231891200,17,1728,4.765886287625418

2899436,5,B000TGKWOY,"I have been re-watching these old Westerns from my childhood days and I have come to the conclusion that they would be perfect for children of today.  The lessons they impart, about integrity and courage,  friendship and honesty, cooperation and fair play, stand the test of time very well.  They tell the story of a simpler time but people were no different.  There were always bullies and crooks and misfits and people willing to take advantage of others to enhance their own position, but there was always the cowboy (or cowgirl) in the white hat to stand up for the oppressed, to risk life and limb for others, to stand up to the bad guys and never give in to tyranny.  The character played by Gene Autry was always intelligent, affable, wise, capable and strong, but he never took advantage of others and he always stood up with the downtrodden (the farmers, the Indians, the ranchers, the lumbermen, etc) who needed his help, and he always did it with a song!  He wasn't a namby pamby, he carried a gun, and knew how to use it, he sometimes owned land, and employed others to work it, sometimes he was a drifter without a penny to his name but he was never a thief, and he was always kind to children and animals.  You can't go wrong with ANY of these films if you wish to relive your youth or pass on your values to the next generations...",1405814400,,1346,4.425101214574899

2899441,5,B000TGKWOY,"Being a Gene Autry fan for years, I can remember seeing some of them in the movie theater, and on early TV.  He is a GENUINE AMERICAN HERO.  He actually ran away from the movies to be a gunner in the Army Air Corps.  Back to the movies, I've watched all 8 of the movies and the trip down Memory Lane was spectacular for me.  The vendor delivered them 2 days before Amazon said I'd have them, and for that, I'm happy.  They arrived in great condition, and the quality of the prints is from Very Good to Excellent.  They are easy on the eyes and fun to watch.  Thanks",1359936000,,565,4.081818181818182
