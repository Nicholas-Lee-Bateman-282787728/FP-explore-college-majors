1635434,5,B00005NHIP,"This is the fifth volume of the most popular arc in the Sailor Moon series.
The fifth DVD volume finally gets to the beginning to the awesome Sailor Moon S series Sailor Saturn Arc. The three Sailor Soldiers (Venus, Uranus and Pluto) must destroy Hotaru (aka Sailor Saturn) before she awakens as the Messiah of Silence and brings armageddon to the planet. But an obstacle stands in there way and that's Sailor Moon and her fellow Sailor soldiers. Things will start to get serious from here on in and this is what made the Sailor Moon S series quite popular among fans.
Anyway, don't expect great quality for anime since this is an anime TV series not a movie or OAV. It was really good during it's time years ago and the paintings are marvelous but it's not sharp because it's a TV series (lower budget than movies).
So, this is the episode 90-127 storyline arc (episode 115-120).  There are 37 episodes total for the series and a total of 6 episodes on this DVD. So, one more DVD left in the series!
As for special features, well there are hardly any.  A gallery with hardly anything and a profile of Sailor Mars.
So, if you want to see the serious side of Sailor Moon, this DVD is where it all begins.  Check it out!",1006646400,2,1218,4.404444444444445

Anyway, here's another great Sailor Moon S DVD from Pioneer ^^ Again it's great value for money with 6 uncut episodes in both subtitled and dubbed formats (i.e. the content of 4 VHS tapes), and there are some really good episodes (many of which actually advance the story) too. My favourite on this disc is the last one (""Invasion from an Alternate Dimension! The Mystery of Mugen Academy""), where in a very emotional scene we find out a bit about the past of Professor Tomoe and Hotaru, and also we get introduced to Telulu, Mimet's successor with funky green hair ^^
The DVD quality is roughly the same as always. We have great cover art on both the outside and the inside (although I like the outside cover better), pretty good video quality and, to be perfectly honest, horrible sound quality (not that any better was expected). The menus feature Sailor Mars and are great, as always. The extras are both quite boring this time: a Sailor Mars profile/art gallery, and the third opening (which was used for all the episodes in the American release) with Japanese credits. I was hoping for the end-of-episode previews, but no such luck :(
And finally we come to the quality of the dub. This disc has four good episodes, one that was done by the bad writer but has no real problems and one that was done by the bad writer but doesn't have as many problems as in some others (although enough was changed that the story of the dubbed episode makes no real sense). The acting (and also the mixing of the audio) seem to be improving - I enjoyed the dubs of these episodes more than the ones on the earlier discs. The original's still my preference though.
I'm sure what I'm about to say is no surprise: If you have all the discs so far (and like them to some extent), get this. The storyline is getting better and better, and with the Messiah of Silence on the verge of awakening and only one disc left to go, you don't want to stop now!",1003536000,10,1938,4.446629213483146

7947496,5,B00005NHIP,"While the first set of episodes aren't exactly my favorite, 118-120 hold a special place in my heart. When I was a teenager I got really sick for three months, and when I was trying to go to sleep or take naps I would always play the ""The Mysterious Sailor"" VHS and it would make me content and put me to sleep.

This collection contains:
115: Shadow of Silence!? The Pale Glimmer of a Firefly
116: Sunny Skies After a Storm! A Friendship Dedicated to Hotaru
117: Higher, Stronger! Cheers by Usagi
118: The Battle in a Demonic Dimension! The Sailor Soldier's Bet
119: Awakening of the Messiah of Silence? Stars of Destiny
120: Invasion from an Alternate Dimension! The Mystery of Mugen Academy

Hotaru's mysterious powers come to light; as her father is the notorious Professor Tomoe, the Senshi are divided on what to think of her. The Inner Senshi believe she's nothing more than an innocent girl who can't help her parental situation. The Outer Senshi see her potential for darkness and plan to observe her until they can properly destroy her. All the while Mimet and Professor Tomoe brew up more Daimon, and the Messiah of Silence grows stronger inside Hotaru's body.

Personally, I like the last two Heart Collection DVDs best. That's when things really start to get intense. The main reversible cover art features three of the four Outer Senshi on the front, and a photo of Hotaru surrounded by scenes from the anime on the back. The back features Tuxedo Kamen clutching Chibiusa to his chest on the front and Chibiusa, Pluto, Usagi, and Hotaru on the back. The disc features art of Uranus and Neptune holding their talismans.",1367798400,,1632,4.719298245614035
7947497,5,B00005NHIP,If you like sm then get this DVD. This is almost the end of the Super Series. Volume6 is the best one. The dubbing is better then the 1st two seasons.,1064534400,,150,3.870967741935484
7947498,4,B00005NHIP,"This Uncut Version is great! Six great episodes in one DVD that you'll truly enjoy! One of my favorites is ""The Battle in a Demonic Dimension! The Sailor Soldier's Bet"" because its funny and interesting to watch, like its funny how the Sailor Scouts play all these games just to get out,and I really enjoy watching this episode in japanese. These episodes also explain alot more about Hotaru not only that she might be Sailor Saturn, but also the Messiah Of Silence.",1058659200,,466,4.695121951219512
7947499,5,B00005NHIP,"This is volume 5 of 6
Hotaru  and Chibi-usa monopolize the fifth volume of the S series. All of the episodes center around Hotaru, as her strange powers assert themselves and her true identity made known. I have little tolerance for Chibi-usa, but even I found these episodes to be watchable. The ep where Mimet jams everything she can get her hands on into the Daimon machine is funny. The wierd twisting of dimensions causes some very wierd things, right when the evil Professor Tomoe is on a trip to the store to pick up some snacks for his organization (I'm not making that up!) Eventually, Hotaru's true identity is revealed, but that just makes chibi-usa all that more adamant that her friend isn't a bad person. If you like Hotaru, or are a fan of the Outer Senshi, this is a good DVD to buy.",1035158400,3,799,4.472602739726027
7947500,5,B00005NHIP,"S(ailor)M(oon)S v(olume)5 in my opinion is the best DVD yet out of the previous four...so far that is. SMS v6 will knock the others out of the water. V5 is when things start picking up. The last episode on this DVD is the main reason why SMS is my favorite season, though i considered most of the beginning of this season kind of boring..but still...it has to be my favorite due to the awsome final 14 episodes. SMS v5 is also really good because like i said..the action really starts in this DVD..and if you wanna skip all the mellow-drama and get to the action...buy this DVD (as well as v6).
  Like the other SMS DVD's, v5 has reversible covers with what I think is the most gorgeous pictures ever created.(Uranus, Neptune and Pluto-Side 1) (Tuxedo Kamen and ChibiMoon - Side 2). This DVD features Sailor Mars and the Extra's contain a well written bio on Rei Hino/Sailor Mars and even a small gallery (containing 5 pictures) and the original japanese opening (version 0.3) as well. And of course you can watch it in Japanese or English- both versions are good.
  SMS DVD v5 truley introduces Sailor Saturn, the history of the Death Busters, some major drama with Chibiusa and Setsuna and best of all you get to meet my favorite villian of all the SM series..Telulu. All in all this is a great DVD which features the awsome Supers season.",1010275200,6,1341,4.551867219917012
