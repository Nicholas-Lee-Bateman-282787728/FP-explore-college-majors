8422982,5,B004CFUIQU,"Excellent dry-humor British POW movie.  Think Stalag 17 with dancing ""girls"" and you've got a pretty good bead on this movie.",1521504000,,125,4.9523809523809526
8422983,5,B004CFUIQU,"Forget ""Hogan's Heroes"" or ""Stalag Luft"" (in which I played an extra) - this 1961 comedy beats both in not only laughs but also suspense and tension. The legendary British actor James Robertson Justice is joined by such British comic icons as Leslie Phillips, Stanley Baker and Eric Sykes in this improbable but entertaining romp in which Justice plays a scientist who is shot down over Germany and must escape his P.O.W. camp at all cost to help the British war effort. I remember seeing this years ago sometime in the early 1980s and several times trying to figure out ""What was that POW movie featuring James Robertson Justice?"" I'm glad I found this on Netflix because it brought back all the nostalgic value of those rainy Saturday afternoons (I was raised in the UK) curled up on the sofa watching old movies. This is truly a classic.",1399334400,,840,4.6824324324324325
