The rating comes from the fact it didn't work in my Blu-Ray player and at this point, I still haven't received my refund after returning the discs, but hey it has only been 8 weeks.",1474675200,,255,3.923076923076923

This information is not presented on the box, but is found when you research a bit online. Hope this helps others in the US with playing Region B discs and saves you some money.",1453852800,2,333,4.475409836065574

8544196,1,B009T4RQ50,Had seen notices about versions for DVD's that were only good for specific regions.  Saw no notices about blue ray discs.  Nothing was specified about this series and it DOES NOT play on blue ray players in the states.  Complete waste for me.,1377648000,6,242,4.5813953488372094
