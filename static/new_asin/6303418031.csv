7846020,1,6303418031,"Rodeo Bloopers 10 DVD - and rated it a 1 star because there as no zero star option. It was advertised as a great 'party video'. Advertising as a party video is a misrepresentation as I've not attended a party nor thrown a party for 30 min. in duration. Secondly, while I admit I enjoy the thrill of rodeo - an extremley dangerous sport, the events filmed in the video were failures, not bloopers. There were a couple of humorous events, but there was approx. 15 minutes of extremely boring 'acting' by some gentlemen trying to be funny - but they were ridculous, so also, don't waste your money, or time on Rodeo Bloopers 10.

It sucked so much, I had to throw it out in the recycle so I can say, ""That's annoying"" and it was boring and I would not recommend buying that DVD, it was yucky, dark and light changes, and both are silly crap of bull and there's team roping in Rodeo Bloopers 10, so, forget team roping and just stick with rodeo's only real three main events of calf roping steer wrestling and bull riding as the real true done deal, and let the cowgirls compete with the men in calf roping and bull riding as the real true done deal, got it?

Save more of your time and money on mostly the real four products I recommend of:

7846021,5,6303418031,"I may not be a cowboy myself, but this is one heck of a very funny and enteratining video. It has wonderful songs as well as just great musical sequences that people can exercise to. I do that on my treadmill. The music has great rhythm to it. By the time this tape is over I break out into a cool sweat. I bet that my friends who actually are cowboys themselves would love this video also. Any action fan should certainly own this.",1268956800,,432,4.154761904761905
