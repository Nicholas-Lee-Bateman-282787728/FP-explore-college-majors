8683278,5,B00ODEB0NK,"Sick of your BJJ buddies besting you in grappling matches? Check out this video! Sammy teaches you the basics of what to do when a fight goes to the ground. I especially enjoyed the discussion of fighting on concrete verses a mat. This DVD advertises as teaching ""The Basics"", but even the experienced ground guy will learn from it. I definitely recommend this.",1415232000,,361,4.746031746031746
