I bought the CD and haven't put it down! Truly an amazing group of musicians, dancers, and artists all coming together to show off their talents! In 2008, I had the opportunity to perform live in the show! It was AMAZING to return and as an observer of the show in 2012! I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone!! Amazing show for all ages! Includes several military bands and bagpipe bands as well as the Top Secret Drum Corps and the United States Military Band performing a superhero genre show! Absolutely thrilling!!

Loved it from start to finish with the fanfares, the pipes and drums, the Norwegian band and honor guard - always good no matter how often you see them- the US Navy Band Europe, and the Swiss drum corps (can't even express how well they perform - just outstanding) and on and on.

It now includes units from all over the former 'British Commonwealth"",.  You will also find units from countries whose ties to the UK are most tenuous, (often they have been enemies).  But those former military enemies are now prepared to attempt to out march, out drum, and out play the British Army Units.",1407456000,2,457,5.094594594594595
