8657656,3,B00KCU2PZ6,"However, both Villazn and Hampson have better performances than this one.
Though clearly stated, Wagner is difficult, even ' in context' (within its own opera); in
recital,. arias devoided of that context, have little to attract by themselves.",1485907200,,243,5.421052631578948
8657657,4,B00KCU2PZ6,"This recording features the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Yannick Nzet-Sguin, as well as the two amazing voices of Thomas Hampson (baritone) and Rolando Villazn (tenor), along with some stunning scenery from Odeonsplatz in Munich.  But of course, it is the music that is paramount, and with these gentlemen and this orchestra on stage the experience (even though recorded) is captivating indeed.

The disc (gorgeous in blu-ray) opens with Verdis Les Vepres siciliennes overture from Don Carlos, and it is immediately clear that both the orchestra and the conductor are prepared to bring forth the best music that they can bring on this day.  Thomas Hampson appears on the third piece (Ce breuvage pourraitVision fugitive), and as always with Mr. Hampson, it is treat to just sit back and let his wonderful baritone voice wash over you.  Mr. Villazn appears next in Ah! Tout est bien fini and he sings with a living force that is distractingly captivating.

Next we get to hear Maurice Ravels La Valse, and I found myself marveling at how good this orchestra and its maestro really are.  Following that are selections from Wagner, gorgeously performed as the sun went down.  And then back to Verdi where track 11 from Don Carlo E lui Desso linfante was the duet that just stole the show.  I have no doubt that, had I been observed while watching, my jaw dropped during the performance of this piece.  It was *amazing*.

There encores are featured from Verdis Il corsaro, and each is wonderful in and of itself.  Bravis must also be extended to the chorus for doing remarkable work throughout the entire recording  when they are called upon, they are there and most certainly up to the high bar that Maestro Nzet-Sguin and the two soloists have set for the performance.  Start to finish, this is a wonderful musical experience.

The liner notes are all to brief, but they do convey a sense of the atmosphere that was present when the recording was made.  But it is the music and voices contained herein that matter, and for those listeners that enjoy the music making of Mr. Nzet-Sguin, Mr. Hampson, or Mr. Villazn, this disc is sure to delight.  It is wonderful, and I strongly recommend it.",1418169600,,2213,4.799472295514512
8657658,4,B00KCU2PZ6,"Performance more and less than advertised. From the ""cover,"" it looks as though one is going to spend an evening with Villazn and Hampson doing Verdi and Wagner. This is only partially true. After two pieces for orchestra and one featuring chorus, the first thing we hear from these gentlemen is Massenet arias, Hampson from ""Hrodiade,"" and Villazn from ""Le Cid."" Neither is disappointing, but a surprise, given the title of the performance. A Ravel piece features orchestra followed by three Wagner selections wherein Hampson's beautiful Tannhuser aria is sung just as the darkness is coming to the beautiful city of Munich. We wait a while before these gentlemen are united in the friendship duet from ""Don Carlo."" When singing alone, it is noticeable that Hampson is singing with his quiet elegance and Villazn is hard to contain. The two standing side by side are a lesson in discipline and impetuousness. For this venue, I prefer the Hampson elegance over the wildness of Villazn. I was reminded of a beautiful young Carreras when I looked away as he sang the Oberto aria. Of all the Verdi available to both of them, Oberto and Il corsaro were curious choices. Nzet-Sguin capably managed all of the personnel involved and the concert was masterfully recorded and produced. The camera work was quite marvelous, with wonderful closeups of various soloists, making dramatic moments of some that might have passed us by.",1407542400,,1421,5.0
8657659,5,B00KCU2PZ6,"Disappointed in Hampson's performance more than anything. They were as Jakobine Kempens describes in her written introduction ""...could hardly be more different from one another :Hampson, with his thoroughly cultured American voice and aristocratic bearing, a crowd pleaser for many years: and Villazon the raven-haired Mexican, who always sings as if his life depended on it, and who captivates his audience every time with his all-consuming intensity"" I say the venue was perfect; the night was perfect under the stars; the orchestra and chorus was perfect (outstanding) Maestro Nezet-Seguin was charming to watch as his expressive face felt the music,  so it all worked.  Yes, Hampson's quite  baritone interludes were contrasts to Villazon's fiery style but he still appeared uncharacteristically aloof when he is known behind the scenes for his sense of humor and  good nature when with the irreverent Villazon. Yes, they were perfectly delightful in their solo performances each shining in what they individually do best but it was a little disappointing when they sang the ""E Iui! Desso, I'infante! Dio, che nell'alma infondere"" from Verdi's ""Don Carlo"". Technically it was flawless but is supposed to be a moving declaration of loyalty and friendship and camaraderie. Hampson as ""Rodrigo""  stood there stiff, almost rigid barely looking at Villazon for most of the number while Villazon gets into the role and sings out the  torment of ""Don Carlo"". In the recitative, Rodrigo is supposed to be tenderly inquiring as to his friends misery; Carlo holds back, fearful that his friend will be disgusted by his secret and will withdraw his lifelong friendship. Rodrigo declares that nothing will ever destroy their friendship so Carlo confides in him of his love for the French Princess Elizabetta ( who he was to marry) only to find out she was married off in a political move, to his father the King of Spain and now she is legally his step-mother! In a effort to console his devastated friend, Rodrigo tries to distract him into another  cause such as the suffering of the Flemish people under the tyrannical hand of Carlo's father King Filippo. In the end of the recitative they sing a beautiful aria of hope and liberty and friendship with Villazon singing it with conviction and passion while Hampson seems barely present. Some say its his reserve style on stage but heck its all part of the performance. Others say that Hampson excells in lieder music rather than in operatic roles. I will have to agree with that. I have seen him in person in recital performances and he is actually charming if not reserved on stage. Villazon is the consummate performer lively, passionate and full of life and I like that too!",1406851200,2,2722,5.022172949002218
