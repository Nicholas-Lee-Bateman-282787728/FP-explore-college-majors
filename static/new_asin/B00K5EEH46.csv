8655966,4,B00K5EEH46,"The Borderlands depicts the border between the pagan and spiritual realms, the paranormal and the technological, using headcams, CCTV, sound recorders and the pokey atmospherics of a small West Country church, where the natives are not too friendly. The priest himself Father Clerrick has claimed to witness a miracle (caught on video) of candlesticks moving on an altar table. The whole basis of why the film works is that its based on the interaction of rounded characters (the paranormal investigators) with each other and their environment, a little off the beaten track. Forget any kind of found footage aka The Blair Witch Project. This is a horror-docu-fiction of a special kind. What is especially good is the central two characters, Brother Deacon( Gordon Kennedy), a Scottish Vatican investigator with a drink problem, and English agnostic technician Gray(( Rob Hill), only in it for the money, pitched together in the cottage where they reside, having little debates about the spirit world or pagan beliefs and what constitutes a miracle. Of course they make sorties into the surrounding countryside, stake out their territories, and go to the pub. Gray states that the things pagans believed in (sun, moon, stars, sea, fire, earth) was physically real and present. Not so the holders of faith who built their churches on heathen ground. We hear about the destructive power of the Catholic Church vis-&agrave;-vis pagan worship.

Father Mark( Aidan McArdle) , a methodical Irish priest, who holds Deacon in low regard, holding him to blame for the death of 7 priests in Brazil. He is the Realtor General and leader. The investigators fit CCTV cameras in the church and each wears a headcam. Strange things starthappening- weird, rasping, scratchy noises, the creaking of timbers, the crying of a baby. Deacon and Father Mark (not believing Father Crellick) remain sceptical. The film cuts together footage from all these cameras to outstanding effect-shots of empty spaces where nothing happens but might. Surveillance cameras give a steady gaze on the action, together with a strong use of the headcams, allowing eye-to-dialogue and multi-points of view. Father Crellick creeps into the church at night to pray, he also becomes increasingly unhinged, thinking they don't believe him. He commits suicide. Deacon ventures into the church alone at night and has paranormal experiences. Father Calvino flies in from the Vatican and performs exorcism in the church. There is a scary last 15 minutes through the catacombs underneath the church, during which the borders between minds and environment become fuzzy, intermixed; when fear, superstition, faith and terror are revealed. The natural catacombs narrow into the very contents of the skull. Extraordinary.",1489968000,,2768,5.305239179954442
