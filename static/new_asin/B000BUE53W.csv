8092858,2,B000BUE53W,"It was boring, nice bodies but nothing to peak my interest or make me curious. A woman or Lesbian might like it, not me. I think of it as a teaser, not a pleaser",1374278400,,161,3.764705882352941
8092859,4,B000BUE53W,"This comes in the era of Peach (2005) in which there was a lot of reused footage, and I believe that the same goes here as I have seen some of this same stuff in at least one other title.

You've never heard of any of these eight women (who go only by inconspicuous first names like ""Andrea""), but don't let that deter you. They're four-star hotties, Brazilian models of some description, and every one (except the cover girl who still looks amazing) is all-natural with a build that you'd expect out of a Brazilian girl. The exposure could stand to be a little more explicit but a few of the ladies show it all.

Production values are typically good for Peach although there is some weird intercut editing in a few spots. Overall a good buy particularly if you like Brazilian women.",1374019200,5,783,4.468531468531468
