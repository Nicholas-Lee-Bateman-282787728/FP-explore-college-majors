8458103,5,B0055DXRR0,"Andy James is a great guitarist and I have several of his videos.  There's not a lot of music theory or explanations on here, just a lot of demonically diabolical diatonic licks and tricks.  Very useful as they are all in E minor (the official key of metal bands everywhere) and can easily be shifted elsewhere on the fingerboard for further possibilities.

However, most of these are pretty fast so I wouldn't recommend for beginning players, unless you want something inspiring to work towards, as Andy James is certainly that.  I'd say you need to be comfortable playing 16th notes at 144 BPM with a metronome to really get the most out of these, although some of the bending/whammy bar licks are much more approachable.  Oh, he also has really long fingers so I use my pinky in some places where he uses his ring finger, but if you've been playing guitar for a while I'm sure you're used to making adjustments like that for yourself.

These aren't taken note-for-note from Slayer songs but are more ""inspired by,"" and do sound very much like Slayer or Pantera, etc.
Of course you really need to put TIME into this to get all of the awesomeness out of it, but I'm having fun doing just that!",1450483200,,1194,4.55607476635514
