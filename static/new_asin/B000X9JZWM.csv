1955........LOL....so bad ....cut up movie from the Crime Busters TV series has all the criminals .....eventually getting caught or killed. badest of the lot is MA Barker....Staring Jim Davis and Lash Larue and Lyle Talbot. You may not even recognize them .....poorly done and look for 1940s cars supposed to be getaway cars from Bonnie and Clyde and Dillinger from the 1930s.....narration so bad you cringe..... One outstanding moment acting is the BARTENDER held prisoner by the Dillinger gang...sneaks a note....in a pack of cigarettes.....to call the FBI .....silly yes....cheesy...yes...entertaining...worth watching once.....3 STARS~",1479859200,,696,5.823529411764706

FILM SYNOPSIS:
Released to theaters in 1957, GUNS DON'T ARGUE is a composite of three 1952 ""Gangbusters"" syndicated TV episodes, loosely woven together with additional narration. Focus is on Prohibition Era criminals. As this show was pro-law enforcement, facts that reflect badly on the FBI have been changed. Here for example, instead of their brutal ambush-style executions, both John Dillinger and Clyde Barrow fire the first shots after being given a chance to surrender.

Others covered (Baby Face Nelson, the Barker Gang, Pretty Boy Floyd) fare better; that is if you can ignore all the 1950s sets, props and costumes used to recreate the Roaring Twenties.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.
