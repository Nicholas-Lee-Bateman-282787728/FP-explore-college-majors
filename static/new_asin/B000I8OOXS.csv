8144431,5,B000I8OOXS,"This is a series of TV movies from the early 1990s  starring British comedian Rik Mayall (sadly departed us June 2014), best known in the US for his ground-breaking anarchic comedy series The Young Ones, shown on MTV here in the early 80s,and as the slightly psychotic invisible friend of Phoebe Cates in Drop Dead Fred. Mayall had true versatility as an actor, leading man good looks, and displays a wide range of talents in these hour-long stories containing both comedic and dramatic elements. Those who know him only for his ability to bug his eyes and display 357 emotions across his face in rapid succession while saying something outrageously funny or borderline perverted while simultaneously shaking his underwear-clad bottom are in for a treat. Here in no particular order are the stories:

Dancing Queen: Neil's friends play a prank on him at his bachelor party by drugging him and putting him on a train without any pants, money, or ID the night before his wedding. Luckily for him, the stripper at said bachelor party, Pandora (Helena Bonham-Carter) is also on the train and attempts to help him. Lovely seaside views of Scarborough and a romantic storyline helped along by the music of Abba and Fleetwood Mac make this truly adorable. Notable for being Bonham-Carter's first foray into modern characterization from a world of Merchant-Ivory costumers.

Micky Love : Easily the best of the stories here. Mayall flawlessly plays Love, an aging TV host who struggled with alcohol, scandal, and divorce in the past but now has a lucrative and popular gig with Family Values. Rumors fly that he will be ousted in place of a young, hip host (Alan Cumming). Drastic measures are the order of the day as Love struggles to regain his place and battles old demons while something is going on behind the scenes. A biting  look at fame, celebrity, gossip, show biz, and has a great fight scene between Cumming and Mayall. Also features Peter Capaldi and Jennifer Ehle.

Briefest Encounter:  Greg has party-crashed and met Siobhan, a leggy brunette in a tight black dress, who has brought him back to her place for a night of steamy sex. Sadly, things go sideways for Greg with his inamorata's dog, his inability to remember her name, and his obvious dodgy sounding tale of a dead wife. Things go from bad to worse during what should be a sexy romp, when mistaken intentions abound and each suspects the other of something fishy. Amanda Donahoe and Rik play well off each other and sparks as well as some other things fly in this mostly comedic tale of a night gone very, very wrong.

Clair de Lune:  Toby is finishing up his law degree and making ends meet by driving a taxi. He is raising his daughter Annie as a widowed dad, leaving her overnight in the care of the older next-door neighbor lady, who is quite smitten with him and wishes he would give her a tumble. Toby, however, is focused on Annie, whose birthday is coming up and he has a special getaway surprise for her. A spanner is thrown into the works when lovely blonde Clair enters Toby's taxi and involves him in a personal domestic drama with unforeseen complications. The storyline is thin, the music is murky and not very good, but Rik and the little girl playing his daughter (Leonie Sooke) have wonderful chemistry.

The Big One: Sexy. Also hot. Also, damn sexy. Did I mention this was scorching? Mayall is Lewis Fox, rather desultory real estate agent, compulsive liar, and grifter always looking for the next con. In the process of evaluating a luxury penthouse apartment for his boss, Lewis decides on a whim  to appropriate the identity of its dead owner, John Wilde. Romantic complications with Jules (Saffron Burrows) and the wife of the dead man (Phyllis Logan) bedevil Lewis, as well as some people who have compelling reasons for finding Mr. Wilde. Lewis gets in way over his head and must think quick in order to extract himself. Sexy, sexy Rik in a hot tub, some car chase scenes, and a comedic denouement with everyone pointing a gun at everyone else make this quite an enjoyable ride, even if the plot twists were rather easy to untangle.

Dirty Old Town: Probably the weakest of the stories. Rik plays Raymond, a down-on-his luck alcoholic, homeless and reduced to living in an alley. Once a promising doctor, he made an error and caused a patient to die, leading him to drown his sorrows in a bottle. Following a car accident, his identity is confused with that of a promising script writer, and Raymond enters a strange new world he can't quite comprehend. Rik does a fine job but the storyline is scattered and contains too many threads never sewn up quite neatly. Still, worth a look if only to see the range of talent this man had.

All in all, a wonderful collection. Will definitely broaden your mind on the magnificent Mr. The Rik Mayall, who despite living on this planet for a heartbreakingly short 56 years, managed to create some memorable characterizations, not all of them zany. Had he lived, perhaps a villain role in something like Sherlock or even a part on Downton Abbey would have raised his profile in the States and brought his unique brand of energy, charm, wit, style, looks, and class to a new generation.",1405987200,7,5215,4.7312775330396475
