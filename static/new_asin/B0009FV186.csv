2289242,5,B0009FV186,"Working as an ""Energy-healer"" myself, this DVD still reveals many new concepts to me about Love and its interactive issues in relationships.

Presented by Donna Eden (one of the worlds most famous energy healers) and her husband since 26 years: David Feinstein (a highly regarded psychologist).

Life is all about love in one way or the other and Donna and David show how you can cathegorize four very distinct ""Energy Personalities"" with characteristics just as different as between men and women.

During this very entertaining and enlightning seminar they show real examples of typical interactions between these four personalities.

They explain how couples often are attracted to their own opposites and the conflicts that then with certainty will arise - all demonstrated with people in the audience in a way that is absolutely amazing to watch...

They proceed by explaining WHY and HOW the four ""Energy Personalities"" reacts normally and under stress in an argument.
Then they show ""live"" how to be able to deal with your partner in a way that is not only simple to do but also very pleasant for both parties in a relationship...

They end with a practical example that leaves the couple without stress in total energetic harmony with each other that most likely leads to the next ""step"" in a loving relationship!
It's a three-letter word starting with an S..!

8060185,5,B0009FV186,I had to buy this book for class as well.  Important and useful information if you are wondering about love and energy.,1398384000,,119,4.409090909090909
8060186,5,B0009FV186,"Donna Eden and David Feinstein are a brilliant team, and their work is just plain practical.  Donna's intuitive knowledge of the human energy systems and David's knowledge as a psychologist make a great left brain/right brain balance of information.

You will definitely see yourself in one or two of the personality types they describe, and if only for understanding how to deal with disagreements and avoid arguments, this DVD is worth every penny.",1366502400,,450,5.1506849315068495
8060187,5,B0009FV186,Just love  the information this video shares with us to recognize which sensory types we are and loved ones in order to have better understanding  of why and how we interact with each other.,1332460800,,190,4.5588235294117645
8060188,5,B0009FV186,"The Energies of Love is not exactly what you might think...no Tantric formulae, no Kama Sutra...more about the energies and rhythms within us (tonal, kinesthetic, visual, digital) how they work and more important, how they mesh and blend with those of our beloved.  Donna and David explain the different types of energies clearly, giving their strengths and weaknesses, and show how to develop loving ways of working together and accepting the differences (since no one seems to be attracted to someone just like him/her).  The video production itself isn't wonderful, since it was filmed during a workshop, but everything is clear.  I showed it for some friends on Valentine's Day, and altho it was too long to watch in one night, everyone wanted to borrow it so they could finish.  I learned a lot about myself, my friends...and interactions in general.",1307145600,5,855,5.042553191489362
8060189,4,B0009FV186,This is great DVD however she goes over stuff already discussed in other DVDs.  I wish she would have talked more about the different energies that people are.,1250985600,6,159,4.678571428571429
8060190,5,B0009FV186,"I'm very grateful to Donna Eden and David Feinstein for this DVD and other works by them.  One can drastically improve any relationships as well as a love relationship based on the information of this DVD.  For a good learner, this can be life changing.",1208908800,4,253,4.6
