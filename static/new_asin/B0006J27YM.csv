8041751,3,B0006J27YM,"A woman is murdered and the woman that receives her eyes in a transplant has visions of what happened and decides to solve the case and help the dead woman's family get justice. Nicolette is hot so I didn't mind it, the story was okay.",1123545600,4,235,4.2444444444444445
8041752,1,B0006J27YM,"Nicollete Sheridan is the star, that should tell you something right off.  This is a poor, B-rate thriller about a woman who has visions of a murder after and eye transplant.  Nothing here is special or scary and the acting is second rate",1121126400,3,238,4.511627906976744
8041753,3,B0006J27YM,"So why the 3 stars...well, this film was pretty good, had a least one big name star in the cast, but it did seem a bit ""Monday Night Movie-ish"" but that is ok. This appears to be one of those movies that you do not hear a lot of...if anything!! The story was interesting, and it did keep me interested in what it had to offer.  Not a bad effort in the least!",1117584000,,358,3.904109589041096
8041754,3,B0006J27YM,"I think this movie is an okay choice if you run out mega movies to watch. Don't expect too much though. It looks like something you'll find on A&E channel.

The movie is about this woman who had a cornea transplant from a dead donor and she ended up seeing how this donor was killed. From then on you can pretty much guess the rest of the story.

So the plot is average. Acting has its good moments for a B movie but it got worse towards the end. Editing, script, sound, camera, special effects are nothing to speak about.

AND IT'S NOT A CREEPY movie as the name suggested.. just so you know.

As I said, rent it only if you have nothing good to watch.",1117324800,3,653,4.118110236220472
8041755,3,B0006J27YM,"This movie's not bad--it's just that you can't help but feeling you've seen a lot of it before--in ""The Eye"" starring Angelica Lee--a much better movie with the same basic concept.  There are differences--but the premise seems the same!

As far as this movie goes--it's fairly interesting-though it's pretty obvious who the killer is if you're paying attention.

The first half of this movie seems like ""The Eye""-the remaining half seems like a lifetime movie--if you like Lifetime movies-you'll probably like this!

The basic plot--Ann Culver has a cornea transplant and now sees visions experienced by the departed donor--whose death was determined to be a suicide--though Ann's ""vision"" says otherwise

I wouldn't go out of my way to buy or rent this movie--but if it interests you--there are worse movies out there!",1117065600,2,819,5.174242424242424
8041756,1,B0006J27YM,"This DVD has three short films about demonic posession; The Devil's Spell, Witches' Dolls, and Resurrection of the Damned.

The Devil's Spell: A blatant rip-off of the first Night of the Demons film about a group of college kids meeting in a house and one by one being turned into demons as they are slain in silly ways. There's not even a hint of skin in the one sex scene - in which continuity goes out the window. Even the boom mike comes into view at the beginning of the film

Witches' Dolls: Is an interesting (at times) story of an elderly woman who arrives in a guest house and who then proceeds to trick the guests into giving her their souls.

Resurrection of the Damned: this is, in a sense the biggest rip-off of the bunch. It is a edited down version of the 1992 film ""Netherworld"" - it's exactly that same film, only with large pieces removed to make for a version that fits in with the format of this DVD.

Netherworld/Resurrection of the Damned is an odd story of a guy visiting the deep south looking for his dead father. The odd thing is that some of the people in this, when they are 'posessed' they become colourful feathered birds!",1112572800,3,1152,4.394366197183099
8041757,1,B0006J27YM,"Let me begin by saying that I am a fan of Charles Band and his Full Moon productions (when, oh when, will we see those on DVD?). Having said that, I picked up ""The Possesed"" based on his name alone. Anyone who has seen any of the Full Moon movies knows that you are not getting A+ stuff here. They are campy, fairly low budget flicks shot for straight-to-video. Nevertheless, I enjoyed them quite a bit.

This piece of film sludge has NOTHING in common (except the budget, perhaps) with Charles Band's earlier works. There is absolutely no redeeming qualities to this poorly worked trilogy. The acting can only aspire to be pure dreck. There aren't even any good sex scenes to make up for the rest. This is an hour and a half of your life that you will NEVER get back! Avoid it at all costs.",1111363200,,791,4.344594594594595
