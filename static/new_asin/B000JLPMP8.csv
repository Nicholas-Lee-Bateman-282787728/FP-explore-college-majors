8500227,5,B000JLPMP8,I'm not sure how anyone can say anthing but positve feedback for this comprehensive and informative DVD. Gary takes the time to show step by step procedures so that a novice can understand. I thought I knew alot about detailing but I still learned many things I did not know. The visual photo's are clear and the narration is clear and presicsly explained. 5 STARS!!!!!,1330387200,,369,4.6923076923076925
8500228,5,B000JLPMP8,"I thought I knew how to wash my car but with this video and the techniques I learned from Gary, I'm so amazed at how good my cars looked. I hated those swirl marks and didn't know it was the way I was washing my car. Learning what I was doing wrong totally changed the way my cars now look, now I wash and treat them very differently...that alone was the price of this DVD. I highly recommend it...very easy to follow.",1291680000,,418,4.109756097560975
8500229,4,B000JLPMP8,"I found this DVD very informative and helpful in keeping my car clean. I didn't know anything about using a clay bar (had never heard of it before!) and some of the other techniques the car detailer in the video shows you. The best part is that I learned how to correctly wash my car and as an added benefit, I'm saving on my water bill too! And it's much easier to clean my car than I thought.

In fact, I've had neighbors ask me when I got my new car...the one I bought 10 years ago!

Also my husband loved the buffing segment...not many other videos cover that.

This is worth the money to learn how to do it right. I no longer go through the drive-thru car washes and figure I recouped my investment in the first couple of months. In fact, I bought a few copies of this DVD, along with automotive clay, and gave it to my dad, stepson and nephew for Christmas presents last year.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Car-Detailing-To-Keep-Your-Car-Looking-New-For-Pennies-A-Day/dp/B000JLPMP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Car Detailing To Keep Your Car Looking New For Pennies A Day</a>",1287964800,,1124,5.0978260869565215
8500230,1,B000JLPMP8,"I really waste my money in this very poor DVD material.
To benifint from this material you should be a person who is a dummy enough and don't know what is  a car look like! or at very best this DVD is a very basic video explanation for the meaning of ""Car Detailing"".
My advice, don't waste your time and money with this material unless you are comming from Mars and need to know what is the meaning of car detailing!",1253059200,,417,4.148148148148148
