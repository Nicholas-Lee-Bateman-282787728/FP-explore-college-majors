8424903,4,B004D7SBIO,"Prudencia Alcazar is the family matriarch, president of a large construction company, mother and grandmother, and a destroyer of everyone around her.

She has no mercy on even her closest relatives. Anyone who gets in her way has to be destroyed.

Maria fell in love with Prudencia's son at a young age, but she's not of his class or wealth. Prudencia turned him against her, put her in prison for 25 years and made her believe that her newborn daughter had died.

Now, Maria is out of prison and has a fortune and a new identity. She's out to find her daughter and to get revenge.",1494547200,,581,4.462264150943396
8424904,5,B004D7SBIO,"I was fortunate that, in one of my trips to Argentina, I got to see Valeria at Luna Park, in Buenos Aires.  She left an indelible impression.  This DVD, recording, billed as a temporary farewell, brought it all back.  This is late Valeria, and the voices shows some strain, but then she warms up and belts them out as we are all used to from her CD's.  A pity she chose to go for the big hits her adoring fans demanded and did not sing any tango--for she is as good in that musical genre as any other classic interpreter.  The show also boasts a quartet of backup voices all of who are ready to fly together or single, and the presence of beloved Palito Ortega just adds to the fun.  A great artist, a great DVD.",1466553600,,712,4.160583941605839

8424907,5,B004D7SBIO,"This film will no doubt be reviewed and even marketed as a film about 'natural' birth, or 'homebirth'.  The film does take you to homebirth and traditional midwives in order to explore what healthy, undisturbed and well supported births look like. She states clearly that she does not dent the mdical and surgical advances, but that these should be complementary to, and not in opposition to unmanaged birth. She explores the traumatising and the mundane aspects of hospital birth that are globalised and too seldom called into question. Reflective, beautifully shot and intelligent film about violence in obstetric care and easily forseeable ways to integrate humane practices and attitudes. The film points the way towards practices and systems that can enhance maternel health without compromising physical safety of mother or baby, and that will probably improve it.",1450224000,,870,5.350364963503649

8424909,1,B004D7SBIO,description said it had english subtitles but it didn't have any subtitles. returned it couldn't use without subtitles for non Spanish speaker friend,1387670400,2,149,5.521739130434782
8424910,5,B004D7SBIO,"I reviewed with five (5) stars because it would not be fair to do one (1) star even though the only subtitles are with the previews of new movies.  There are no toggles or selections for the English subs ""La Loba.  At least with a 5 star rating will not stop anyone who can speak Spanish from purchasing this novella.  I love the novellas.  They are the best in romantic entertainment.",1321660800,6,385,4.380281690140845
