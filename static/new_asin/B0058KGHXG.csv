4599549,5,B0058KGHXG,"My two boys loved this show when they were little. I spotted one at a store for $5 and decided to buy it for my grandsons.  The boys are 4yrs old (twins) and a 7yr old. They absolutely loved it!  I looked on Amazon for any more videos and found this second season, they watch it all the time.  Their dad (my son) brought out the old figures he had of He man and they love them.",1326326400,11,377,3.8701298701298703
4599550,5,B0058KGHXG,"Hey, what can I say? This is no better deal on this set, all of season 2, and you must have season 1 already so you know its a great show..
Kids need shows like this, Good VS Evil. Conflict doesn't have to end with blood all over the place, especially not for children.
 This is a wonderful example of 80's toons where each episode is entertaining as well as full of moral teachings & life lessons.
On a personal note, its time Adam came out of the closet. ""Pink V-Neck with purple pants"" Really??
Lets get this boy some new clothes, lol..
Seriously though, I give this show 5 Stars, its great family entertainment. (By the power of Greyskull!!)",1326240000,4,645,4.375
4599551,5,B0058KGHXG,"I do not remember the network where I lived showing the second season so I bought it.  Judging by the labels on the discs, this season may have new characters which will make it interesting to watch.",1324944000,,199,4.378378378378378
4599552,5,B0058KGHXG,"He-man and She-ra were my favorite cartoons back in the 80s when I was a child and this DVD edition containing all of it it's just great. I have another BCI edition and it's clearly better.. but, hey guys! even if this one is not the best edition in terms of the packaging, the contents is what matters and I'd just say Go for it!
Also I bought it from Argentina and had it sent and it got here in mint condition.",1324425600,,413,4.048780487804878
4599553,5,B0058KGHXG,Ordered this DVD set.  Now I have both seasons.  I loved He-Man as a kid.  Wish they made cartoons like that today.  The first set from this company had scratches on the first DVD.  I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new set and paying for the shipping to return the set that was scratched.  I'm very happy.  The second set was perfect.,1322006400,,339,4.203125
4599554,5,B0058KGHXG,"I remember as a kid making trades with other kids to get my hands on He-Man toys I didn't have at the time. The toys were awesome to play with and we had tons of fun on a daily bases. That being said none of it would be possible were it not for this fantastic cartoon that was far ahead of its time in the 80's. He-Man was the coolest hero around and we all wanted to be him, every episode concludes with a special message for kids highlighting the moral of the story, the cause and consequences - show me a cartoon that does that today. This is a safe cartoon for all kids with cool characters and an endless supply of good vs evil. If you've never seen it give it a try an let the kids enjoy it, otherwise enjoy that kid in you again - Saturday mornings lives on again in my living room, ENJOY!",1321920000,6,796,4.012578616352202

4599568,4,B0058KGHXG,Over all great!  Quality was awesome considering its an early 1980s cartoon.  Loved the episode guide booklet.  Biggest quality issues I really noticed were from the cheap animation practices at the time.  Particularly during Adam->He-man transformations and during opening sequence.  Seemed like they had been copied so many times the video had degraded.  Anybody buying this may wish to make an additional 8 disc case to go along with it as the original case SUCKS.  Discs are originally in undersized paper sleeves and the DVD has a large slot for them to sit in.,1428019200,,566,4.957446808510638
4599569,4,B0058KGHXG,These DVD's brought back a ton of memories. My 8 year old loves watching them and I am thankful I can share a small piece of my childhood with him. The ONLY complaint was the cheap dvd sleeves. I guess in order to be cost effective you had to go with the sandpaper sleeves. Buyers be mindful of taking them out and returning them to the sleeves in order not to scratch the discs.,1426636800,,379,4.135135135135135

4599593,4,B0058KGHXG,"I still have fond memories of the original He-Man episodes. This copy of the original series has been well-enough done. The commercials have been taken out with the openings and closings remaining. There's an extra disc with each season for behind the scenes bits. The packaging did arrive broken on my end. The plastic case corners needed to be taped over which left the discs in okay shape, but it was a little annoying having to repair the outer box.",1404172800,,453,4.675

4599595,3,B0058KGHXG,"Just like Thundercats, after the first season it just gets old after a while, it is always the same thing over and over, just done slightly different. The best thing about He-Man than Thundercats is that at least this show had many more various characters to use and a FAR cooler main villain. I didn't find this second season to be all that great like season one, but I am sure many disagree.

4599602,5,B0058KGHXG,"As a child of the 80's I grew up with He-Man, I had the action figures,vehicles,and castle grayskull. This show was so awesome. I waited so long for this to finally come out on DVD and I am so happy it finally has. If you grew up with he man and the masters this is a must have and you can't beat the price for the entire second season. The discs are in envelopes and each disc has a character on it from the cartoon. I have watched every episode with a grin and yes they are cheesey now but they are still great and I still enjoy them as much as I did when I was younger",1384300800,2,571,3.847457627118644

4599610,5,B0058KGHXG,"Cartoons are not like this anymore. Action, impressive animation, and a moral message at the end of every episode. For all of the kids now, they should take a peak at this series because some of things it talks about still holds true today. Cartoons today don't have a moral message at the end of the episode, and that's too bad. Maybe if they did, maybe they would get more from it than action and animation.",1368403200,,409,4.394736842105263

4599626,5,B0058KGHXG,"We bought both season one and season two, very happy with both years. Each episode lasts about twenty mins and since we try to limit our almost four year old's TV this is perfect.  he gets at least one episode and most times two before bedtime...no commercials (which is wonderful) and he is perfectly happy to trot off to bed at the end of an episode.  While the story lines are somewhat simple, they do have a moral to each story which is unusual today.",1350086400,2,455,4.341176470588235

4599628,3,B0058KGHXG,"Still a pretty good value, but Season 2 goes quite a ways downhill:

-1 star: The picture quality is HORRIBLE in many of the episodes, with really bad pixellation that is irritating to watch, while other episodes have the same great quality as all of Season 1 seemingly at random. Lame!
-2 stars: Something happened to Cringer's voice in this season. It raises an octave and consists mostly of a high-pitched squeal that is terribly grating. Trust me, its bad! Also, the cheese factor and goofy humor starts getting bothersome this season.
-3 stars: The packaging is the same cheap pile of envelopes as Season 1 (you get what you pay for, of course). I bought an 8-disc DVD case here on Amazon to solve that problem and got creative with the cover art to make it fit.
+1 star: One thing I really like about these sets is the graphics on the discs themselves. Each disc has a big colorful picture of a different character, and its fun for the kids to flip through once you've put them in a proper DVD case. Also, when you pop in the disc the main menu comes up in just a few seconds. No need to fast-forward, or even worse, sit through those awful 'this operation currently prohibited' segments. Thank goodness!

Really, though. Stick with Season 1 if you're unsure about the purchase. There's plenty of awesome great priced He-man content there without the poor picture quality and poor Cringer squealing like a guinea pig.",1342828800,2,1423,4.620553359683795
4599629,5,B0058KGHXG,"Like quite a few other reviews have also stated, I, too grew up with this cartoon. I buy cartoon DVD's on a fairly consistent basis for my own enjoyment and when He-Man became available in all it's glory I purchased it. I have Season One by another company, BCI, and I purchased Season Two by this company, Classic Media/Mill Creek Entertainment. I may purchase Mill Creek's Season One simply because they don't split up the episode, ""House of Shokoti"", on two separate DVD discs like the BCI release does.

But this review is about Mill Creek's Season Two release which I have. There are 8 disc's...the first 7 contain episodes of the series while the 8th is the Extra features disc. As mentioned in another review the discs are housed in paper sleeves...stacked one after the other...which causes one to have to rummage through the discs whenever you want to grab a particular one. The disc I find myself watching the most are Disc's 1 and 4 through 6. I watch disc 7 on occasion but it has the least amount of episodes...BUT it contains the episode giving Moss Man a lot of screen-time: ""The Ancient Mirror of Avathar"". It's also on this disc that ""The Problem With Power"" can be found. This particular episode is very deep and is one of just a couple of episodes that shed the good vs. evil overtone and dig deeper into the individual characters. In that episode you see He-Man transform back into Adam for the only time in the Filmation series history and you hear the phrase that he uses to instigate the transformation, too.

Speaking of character studies we get to see plenty of in-depth character studies in ""Search for the Past"" where the history of the character's are put front and center: King Randor's father, King Miro, turns out to be alive and held prisoner by The Enchantress. We see Man-At-Arms and King Randor behave like young warriors while on the search for King Miro. He-Man comes to the rescue and saves King Miro, who parachutes down from lost mountain with He-Man where they're encountered by Man-at-Arms. The Enchantress, by now, has imprisoned Randor. The Enchantress' gopher, Drude, eventually frees Randor...leading to the eventual face to face reunion of Randor and Miro. He-Man changes back to Adam and in one scene you see three generations of Eternian royalty: Miro, Randor, and Adam.

In the ""Time Wheel"" we see a former king of Eternia, Tamusk, return to present-day Eternia thanks to a time wheel accidentally spun by Orko while snooping in an ancient laboratory. Tamusk, believing he's in his own time, flees for his palace only to see it drastically changed. Believing that this King Randor is some evil sorcerer who caused all these changes he attempts to do battle with the famously peaceful Randor. The remainder of the episode is spent tracking down Tamusk once he finally leaves the palace in an attempt to convince him that he's thousands of years in the future.

One of my favorites in this collection is ""Orko's Return"" where we have a departure, of sorts, from the usual dose of action/adventure. In a more comical story Trap Jaw and Beast Man become the possessors of what's called an Amber Crystal. The two use it's magic to build a huge fortress while abducting Orko from the palace. Orko happened to be in the middle of magic performance when he disappeared...leaving Adam and Teela to continue laughing and applauding while Man-at-Arms, always alert, has a look of concern. In short, Trap Jaw and Beast Man use their newly acquired magic to control Orko and turn him into their slave. This ultimately backfires and the rest of the episode centers around the battle of wits between Orko, Trap Jaw, and Beast Man as He-Man and company track down the fortress. Orko uses his magic to make wishes come true...literally...driving the evil pair into fits of frustration and anger. It's later revealed that Trap Jaw stole the magic crystal from Evil Lyn.

Season Two, unlike the first season, relied very little on the Castle Grayskull backdrop...oh, it still appeared in mostly every episode and was always shown whenever Adam changed into He-Man...but there weren't that many stories about Skeletor and his warriors attempting to take it over. In Season One, for example, the first several episodes were centered specifically around the take-over or destruction of Castle Grayskull while further episodes always had some sort of Grayskull-referenced plot point. In Season Two the Evil Warriors apparently had moved on...even though there were a few episodes in Season Two that felt like a Season One episode, if you know what I mean!

Since the Castle wasn't used as a major part of the story-lines in the Season Two episodes that meant that the Sorceress appeared infrequently. Notable exceptions were the episodes ""Teela's Triumph"" on Disc 5 where the Sorceress (Teela's biological mother) spent much of the episode in her falcon form, Zoar, trapped in another dimension. Teela, unaware of who her biological mother is, awkwardly becomes the Sorceress at the request of the Spirit of Castle Grayskull. In ""The Origin of the Sorceress"" on Disc 1 we see the story of how Teela'na (the true name of the Sorceress) becomes the keeper of the castle. In that episode we also see the Horde as invaders of Eternia...which ultimately leads to Teela'na becoming the Sorceress. The Horde, whose members wear a red bat logo on their chests, become more prominent in the He-Man spin-off cartoon, She-Ra. Interestingly, though, the Sorceress doesn't refer to them as The Horde in this episode...she simply refers to them as ""an invading army"" even though fans of the series will no doubt make the connection to The Horde.

There are comical moments in almost all of the episodes...particularly from Orko (his magical mayhem often backfires directly at Man-at-Arms) but often the humor comes from Skeletor and his warriors. Beast Man, for starters, in most episodes is portrayed as a dumb sycophant. There are a few where he's written as an actual sinister villain. Skeletor has his share of comical expressions. Beast Man is often called Beastie or Fur-Face by Skeletor. In the ""Energy Beast"" episode Skeletor not only delivers a line referencing the radio series, The Shadow, but he also borrows heavily from Edgar Allan Poe when calling for a spy that he sent to eavesdrop at Castle Grayskull. In other episodes Skeletor talks directly to the audience...often complaining about his warrior's collective ineptitude.

The series used a relatively small voice cast and so you're going to have quite a few secondary and one-shot characters that pop up who sound the same. John Erwin, the guy who voiced Adam/He-Man can also be heard in numerous other roles. A lot of the Kings from other kingdoms on Eternia and softer-speaking characters were voiced by Erwin. His main roles were He-Man/Adam, Ram Man, Squinch (a Widget), Beast Man, Whiplash, and Webstor. Linda Gary did 99% of all the female characters: Queen Marlena, Teela, The Sorceress, Evil Lyn, and other female roles that appeared. Alan Oppenheimer's main voices were Cringer/Battle Cat, Man-at-Arms, Melaktha, Skeletor, and Mer-Man. Like John Erwin and Linda Gary, Oppenheimer did a lot of secondary characters as well. Erika Scheimer, the daughter of the program's producer, Lou Scheimer, often did female roles that sounded like teenagers or younger women. She didn't have a recurring character on He-Man. Lou Scheimer provided the voices for almost everyone else not mentioned: Orko, Montork, Stratos, Fisto, Man-E-Faces, King Randor, Trap Jaw, Tri-Klops, Two-Bad, and others.

I'm more into comical cartoons, which will become crystal clear if any of you've seen any of my other cartoon reviews, but He-Man and a couple of others from the same early/mid '80s time period will continue to be favorites of mine.

4599631,4,B0058KGHXG,"I bought this under the ruse of wanting to share some of my childhood with my son; in reality, I wanted it for myself.  I love this show, with all its cheesy details and reused animation sequences.  Two things I love about the He Man empire (TV show, toys, etc): 1) The cartoon is/was very bold in explaining the differences between right and wrong (something that is all but lost in 21st century America) and 2) it was sheer genius from a business point of view!  Cartoons were filmed on a shoestring with ""repurposed"" character likenesses and reused animation sequences.  The toy line was also genius for many of these same reasons.  For example, Stinkor and Mer-man were basically the same action figure with different paint--genius.
Season 2 is great because we're introduced (or re-introduced) to many new characters such as Robot, Buzz-off, Mekaneck, Clawful, Two Bad, Spikor, Webstor, Fisto, and the list goes on and on.  I love these DVDs and I WILL share them with my son when he gets older.  The bonus features are great--interviews with the writers and animators, character profiles complete with scenes featuring the profiled character, colorful box-enclosed cased, etc.  The only reason I didn't get this 5 stars was for the same reason many complain about this DVD set--the packaging.  The case is great, but the paper sleeves jammed into a CD cased-sized hole in the case seems cheap, is cumbersome, and detracts from the over-all quality of this set.  A must-buy.",1331078400,20,1479,4.903614457831325
4599632,5,B0058KGHXG,"If you're not familiar with the original He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon, I'd suggest that you first read one of the many great reviews written about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/He-Man-and-the-Masters-of-the-Universe-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B004DTU2X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;because I'm mainly going to focus on how this season differs from the last.

On the surface, not too much changes.  The initial opening sequence is identical to that of Season One's and there are no major additions or subtractions from the voice cast.  However, that's not to say nothing is different.  By 1984, (when this season was made) a lot of great new figures were being introduced to the toy line, so we get our first look at iconic characters such as Fisto, Two-Bad, Roboto, Spikor, Moss Man and others.  Fortunately, all your favorites from Season One are still here as well.

I'd say there are three major differences between this season and the last.

1) The animation is much better.  Sure, Filmation's visual style is still a bit limited in some aspects, but the backgrounds are much brighter and more detailed. Stock footage is still used a bit too much, but even that is at least toned down sonewhat.

2)  The storylines are much deeper.  Sure, it's kiddie fare still and while there are some episodes that are more laughfest than anything, we are treated to some episodes like ""Search for the Past"", ""The Time Wheel"", ""Battlecat"", ""The Rainbow Warrior"" and ""The Origin of the Sorceress"" which greatly expand on the mythos of He-Man and those around him.

3) Skeletor's evil army actually feels like an evil army. One of my biggest complaints about the first season is that the ""bad guys"" really don't do much.  A lot of episodes He-Man faces a bad guy who never got a toy and who we never see again and even when Skeletor is around, a lot of his famous henchmen aren't.  In Season Two, not only does Skeletor get a lot more evil warriors to command, but you'll see episodes where a bunch of them are working together to try to defeat He-Man, something that just isn't in the first season as much as it should be.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend buying this DVD set, especially if you already own the first one.",1330387200,6,2351,5.0859375

8461705,5,B0058KGHXG,"If you love He-Man and the Masters of the Universe for all of the crazy, colorful characters, Season 2 is the one to get. The first season focuses almost exclusively on the originals, namely He-Man, Battle Cat, Man-At-Arms, Teela, Ram Man, Orko, the Sorceress, Stratos, and the royal family on the good side, Skeletor, Beast Man, Trap Jaw, Tri-Klops, Evil Lyn, Merman, and Panthor for the villains. But Season 2 added many new faces, including Buzz Off, Fisto, Mekanek, Roboto, Whiplash, Webstor, Kobra Khan, Spikor, Two-Bad, Moss Man, Sy-Klone, Modulok, and a few others from the beloved '80's toy line. Having collected these toys ravenously as a child, it's great fun watching the episodes with my son and seeing all of the new characters pop up that I remember from years ago. The set is loaded with interesting extras, the best of which for me are the episode-by-episode breakdowns from the original writers and producers of the series. They explain a great deal about what went into creating the characters and storylines, and offer the expected amusing anecdotes from the early days. The shows look absolutely great, as if it was brand new instead of three decades old, so no issues with the transfer to DVD. Full of sword and sorcery motifs, based on archetypal heroic storytelling, and complete with a moral at the end of each episode, He-Man was a truly unique cartoon that has easily stood the test of time.",1466553600,,1418,4.863636363636363
