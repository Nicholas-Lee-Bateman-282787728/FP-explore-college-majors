8671715,3,B00MDWDTOW,"Saw it on a Delta transatlantic flight, which does little for the visual experience. Discounting this problem, the movie is pretty standard where plot, acting, and directing are considered. Its early eighties. Two friends, one an adventurer, the other a University professor denied tenure, decide to leave their town and join the tens of thousands of ""mud hogs"" sifting for gold in the Serra Pelada open mine pit (Immortalized by a series of incredible photos taken by the great photographer Sebastiao Delgado, see below). They are attracted by the chance of becoming instantly rich and are prepared to immerse themselves in the gigantic horror of hell created by despair and greed. They encounter underworld lords running the show, prostitutes that are attracted by the gold, violence, and daily brush with death by accident and death by knife or gun. Their partnership falls apart as they are pulled their separate ways, but....I am not revealing the end. The problem with the film is its shallow portrayal of the goons, the whores, and even of the protagonists, as well as by the pretty obvious plot. Nevertheless, the movie describes the unique gold rush of our times, with all its ugliness. So, despite its weaknesses, the subject is fascinating",1478044800,,1250,5.072815533980583
