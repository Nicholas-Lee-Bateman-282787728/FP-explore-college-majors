I found the rich characterizations and amazingly well-written, intertwining storylines in ""Rogue"" to be absolutely addictive. But I frankly struggled to cope with the realization that the show was ending after the fourth season because, quite simply, I had not had enough. So, I was elated to find this DVD on Amazon with the first two seasons packaged together. I am currently savoring the opportunity to binge-watch the beginning and sophomore seasons of this marvelous production very soon!",1506643200,,583,5.202127659574468
