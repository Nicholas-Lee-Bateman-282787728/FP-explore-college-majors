8130292,5,B000GB4ZIQ,"The preformance of the musicians and Joao Bosco is top notch.  My only complaint is of the video format (non-widescreen) and the fact that the second song on the DVD freeze-up and want play without scolling to the end of the disc, then start it over again.",1360368000,,256,4.446808510638298
8130293,5,B000GB4ZIQ,OK - don't even think twice about buying this DVD.  If you know who this artist is then you have to have this item.  It is - a total knockout.  You can play it over and over and not tire of it.  The man was born to bring music to the world.  Thank you Joao.,1205366400,5,257,3.6

8130295,5,B000GB4ZIQ,"Bosco, although he performs all over the world, deserves far wider recognition, as evident from the retrospective presentation of this mature camposer-performer, recalling thirty years of creative work.

 On first hearing, I confess, the live performance seem a bit off, as it took off--partly because of new, unfamiliar arrangments of old favorites and partly, in truth, because at age sixty, Joao's voice is not what it was decades ago, particularly in the upper, falsetto range.

But the artistry is there.  If less dynamically flamboyant than some earlier recordings (and vocal virtuosity has always been Bosco's forte), the absolute control and sure timing (and he is a master of robato rhythm) is a mavel.  Bosco will be remembered for his compositions and, as this DVD/CD assures us, for his musical artistry.

The guest artists and backup musicians rise to Bosco's high standard of performance.  This will become a classic.  It's pure joy.",1161388800,4,947,5.225165562913907
