5848375,5,B008RA62PC,Awesome! It didn't work in my old Blu-ray player but I had planned to upgrade to a PS4 anyways and it had no problem running through there once I did. Wonders of Life is worth the price alone. So good!,1419379200,2,201,4.05
5848376,5,B008RA62PC,"Excellent viewing and typical of the BBCs high standards. Selecting Professor Brian Cox to present this material was a good choice.

As a physicist Brian Cox has the right qualifications. And if you combine this with his enthusiasm & skills in presenting a complex subject in laymens terms, then you're communicating to a wide audience.

Well done",1416614400,2,347,5.0701754385964914

5848378,5,B008RA62PC,"I love Collection Wonders, it just that this is the 2nd time I gotten it and it will not play in any of my players, it comes from Las Vegas  and are part of BBC America  they should play in USA players, I had to send it back again  !!!!!!!!",1398816000,4,240,3.76
5848379,5,B008RA62PC,"I'm not an expert here, but like the other review says, this particular collection was made for British players / TV's. I have tried all three blu ray players we have and the show plays on only one of them. An LG player (I'll update with exact model later) (EDIT: LG BP125) was the one that saved me. The other two: Panasonic DMP-BD60 which played the audio, but the screen was black. And Sony PS3 250GB slim (purchased in 2010) which only had a black screen.

I think Amazon should put a notice front and center on this product's page about this issue. I'm wondering if there is an official list of what blu ray players can convert or read this format and which ones can't. Disappointing to find out it doesn't work on your main player. I am in the U.S. and bought the item from a U.S. IP address from the U.S. siteand
 there was no indicator that it might not play correctly on U.S. players.

Five stars for the show though!",1395878400,12,926,4.310344827586207
5848380,5,B008RA62PC,"Amazon says ""all regions"" but this is the 50Hz UK Version and NOT standard 60Hz US. If you BD player auto  converts  50Hz/PAL video signal to 60Hz/NTSC standard for your American TV, it would work. If you hear sound but see no video, then the BD player is not able or not set to convert.
