She loves them and ask for more of them for Christmas.  I think they are great, and am so glad she is learning sign language.",1483056000,,294,4.0

8689104,5,B00PSTZ3FU,"My daughter absolutely loves these dvd's.  We have been trying to find for a year or so, so I was happy to find on AMAZON,  She had on her Xmas list last year but didn't receive.

It comes with a CD of Christmas music and 2 dvds.  Typical Christmas songs.  I would say a must for any child that is interested in sign language.",1472947200,,326,4.03125
8689105,5,B00PSTZ3FU,We love signing time and this is our favorite!!! I can't believe it wasn't given 5 stars by everyone?! I especially love that you can put in on a different mode if you want to skip all the Santa stuff like I do. Or if you were a school and felt like you needed to skip all the Jesus stuff or you wan't to watch the whole thing. I love that my 3 year old has scripture memorized because of the Glory song. We play this all year long.,1461196800,,432,3.865168539325843
8689106,4,B00PSTZ3FU,"We are fans of all of the Signing Time products.  We started watching when our daughter was 1 year old. She is now 4 and still loving all of the the DVD's. Rachel is amazing and connects with the kids. We are one of the original backers of this Kickstarter. For us, after the success of Baby Signing Time, Potty Time, and Signing Time, in our home, it was a no brainer to be a backer for Signing Time Christmas!",1430265600,,411,4.1375
8689107,3,B00PSTZ3FU,I am a HUGE fan of Baby Signing Times for my baby/toddler.  I also use the regular Signing Times dvds in my classroom.  This particular dvd is not nearly as engaging.  It is more difficult for my students to follow.,1420588800,,215,4.325
8689108,5,B00PSTZ3FU,"We've used Signing Time for the past five years for all our (hearing) children and it has helped them tremendously in communicating before they were verbal.  They've also enjoyed learning the signs and teaching it to siblings even after they could speak clearly.  We all enjoy the new addition to the collection.  There's a LOT of new material here.  The first DVD contains the main program, with the usual method of presenting new signs: Rachel demonstrates the sign, other children demonstrate the sign, and it is put into context with a song.  As with most Signing Time songs, I wasn't really taken with them immediately, but after a listen or two, they grew on me and I think they work very well, particularly the Follow the Star song for the Nativity signs.  In an effort to offer something to everyone, this DVD offers the option to play the general holiday signs (e.g., tree, ornament, decorate, holiday, presents) with or without Santa Claus-related signs (e.g., Santa, sleigh, reindeer), and with or without Nativity-related signs (e.g., Mary, Joseph, Jesus, manger, shepherd, wise men).  (If you don't do Santa OR the Nativity, this probably isn't for you!)  If you include the Nativity option (or play all), after the main program is ""Glory!"", a sung-and-signed version of the entire Nativity story.  The music for this, sung by Rachel and a children's choir, and acted out by children in a Nativity play, is excellent and will keep you humming throughout the season.

The second DVD contains just the songs, including a few Christmas carols like Away in a Manger and We Wish You a Merry Christmas, with the option to either see Rachel demonstrate all the signs and then sing-and-sign the songs, or play through the sing-and-sign versions.

The music CD contains all the new songs from the DVD, the Christmas carols from the second DVD, and the Glory narrative, with Rachel's versions and the sing-along versions.  With so much material, this runs to over an hour.  We've added it to our rotation of Christmas CDs and will definitely bring this out in the future.  Seeing my one-year-old sign ""Christmas tree,"" ""candle,"" ""Mary,"" and ""baby Jesus"" this year was wonderful.  Wait for a sale, but this collection is a great value!",1419724800,,2237,4.912234042553192
