That being said, the filmmaker seemed more intent on being as rough as possible without benefit of balancing it with the strength of her lifelong work. I was truly embarrassed for them, since it seemed more an attempt to find as many tawdry details as possible and pack them into the course of what should have been a much longer project. Very little time was given to her training as a Buddhist nun or any number of things that would have made it a great film. I will say though, that she is so REAL, that you couldn't make her look bad. Her life's work speaks for itself. Still, it was a missed opportunity. Viewers would do better to just head over to youtube rather than be mildly traumatized by this attempt at filmmaking.",1491350400,,842,4.474025974025974
8637214,5,B00HXKHE7C,I chose this video because I saw the Venerable and was amazed by her candid personality. She is a great example of a wondrous person with a great amount of wisdom. The delivery was on time if not sooner and it came with a personal note from the sender!!,1396396800,3,253,4.183673469387755
