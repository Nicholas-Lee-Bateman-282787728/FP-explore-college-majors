I hate to say I love a movie and that it is the beat movie I have seen, cause the next person might have high expectations,and cant see where you thought it was that great. I thought this movie was very good!",1349654400,2,326,4.190476190476191
4888871,5,B005TCL1P2,"This movie is extremely good. I haven't seen such a great story telling movie in a long while. It's about a football player Scott, who is the star quarterback for his small town of Coldwater. He and his team gets to play in the State Finals for the championship. Scott and his team does defects the rival team, but at the costs of his left leg. Scott leg gets bended apart and is extremely hurt from his amazing play he did.

(What I found odd is that in the play his right leg got hurt in the play he did, but some how after the play his left leg is bended. I think this is a mistake on the director.)

Now, the movie fast forward to present time and Scott is now a framer/fireman and is family man with 2 kids and a wife. He has bum left leg and needs to be tie up with steel leg holder to keep it straight.

What is worse is that Scott is in trouble with the bank. He is at risks of lossing his farm and house to the bank, because he can't pay back his loan on time. If he doesn't come up with the money, he will lose it all. Scott is a really strong and proud man. He doesn't tell his wife or anyone that he needs help.

Everything goes from bad to worse as now his crops that he was growing and is what going to help him pay back the money to the bank is at risk of dying soon because the cold weather. The crops are slowly freezing to death and Scott needs to hurry and harvest them.  Scott has no way of saving his crops, so he at the end of his rope. He decides to kill himself and let his family claim his life insurance.

At this point, Scott then wakes up and is back in high school. He realizes that he hasn't played the championship game and he has a second chance to do it all over again. The movie gets really good now as Scott starts asking people around him what would they do if they had a second chance at life? Scoot also starts to try to make his life better for the people around him and his family. But, what would Scott do about the game? He knows what will happen if he plays? Will he play at all? If he plays, will he risks losing his great future life or go back and be with his wife? This was constantly talked and shown during the movie and it was really done very well.

This is a must watch movie and even a great buy.

---Small Spolier Alert---

Throughout the finish of the movie I didn't know what Scoot would really do for the game. I didn't even know if he would even play in the game at the end because he sure didn't want to it seemed like. Then, you don't even know if he would do the play that costs him his leg and his better life. But, in the very end, he did do the play in the game and having a bum leg again. But, in the end he was very happy after all.

I won't tell you what they did for the ending, but it was really great and unexpected. It made my review turn from a 4 star movie into a 5 star movie hands down!",1343433600,10,2861,3.9003436426116838
4888872,4,B005TCL1P2,"This is a really good family movie.  It is a bit of ""Back To The Future"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" rolled into one.  There is some foul language, but not much.  There are some sexual references but not overtly obvious.  I would recommend it for kids 10 and over to watch with their parents.  It has a good moral....do you dwell on the ""only ifs"" of your past or do you play the cards that you are dealt and move on with your life.",1335916800,12,432,4.035294117647059

Touchback is one of those independent movies that can totally fly under the radar. But I can't remember ever sharing and recommending a movie so heartily. At least not one with such a low budget and basically simple story line.

It is well done, and the editing holds up to repeated viewings. Very impressive.",1453680000,2,540,4.444444444444445

4889014,5,B005TCL1P2,What an outstanding movie!  I cannot believe that this film was not popular at the box office.  They should should re release this film.  A feel good movie that makes you aware that money can't buy happiness and there is something to be said from living in a small town.  Brad Presley plays a great part and Kurt Russell is superb with his motivational quotes and humor.  I am so happy I purchased this movie.

I found it amazing how (just like Friday Night Lights) the directors can take actors that are obviously much older than High School Kids...but when you put them all together it doesn't seem to come across that way.  Good family film...I happened to see it in the theatres about a year ago in Texas but it never came into the midwest as far as I know.

4889020,2,B005TCL1P2,"I read reviews on this movie claiming it to be a Christian movie, but it had nothing to do with the Christian faith.  There was no mention of God, the Bible, or faith.  It had a great deal of profanity and a skinny dipping scene that was totally unnecessary.

This movie was about a young football star who gets seriously hurt and can't play football anymore.  Of course, this ends all of his dreams for the future.  He ends up staying in the same small town, marrying,and having a couple kids .  He supports his family on a struggling farm.  He is very unhappy about his current life situation.  He tries to commit suicide and ends up having a dream that lets him go back and relive the past and learn that what he has in life now is not so bad after all.

There is a little foul language which may be inappropriate for smaller children, but we didn't feel it detracted at all from the movie.  If you want a feel good, against all odds type of movie - this is for you.  Football, family & small town camaraderie are the main themes.  There is a farming aspect of the movie, but it is totally unrealistic so don't rent it for accurate farming scenes!  We live in the middle of farm country & still love the movie.

Yea I might be more successful but I wouldn't have my greatest treasures, my family. The great thing about movies like this is they stir emotions you forgot you had. They remind you that its never too late to ""try"" or be thankful. I hope you give this movie a chance, and try to relate to it the best you can. ENJOY!!",1525478400,,824,3.9107142857142856
