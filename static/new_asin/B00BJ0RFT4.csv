5625219,1,B00BJ0RFT4,"The great Spanish director Almodovar has a huge misfire with this idiotic, sex-obsessed and never funny disaster! Don't take this flight!",1383782400,4,137,5.571428571428571
5625220,5,B00BJ0RFT4,"Before I decided to see this movie. I did not know anything about it. As I started looking into the title, I realized it was an Almodovar movie. I'm neither here nor there about his film so I'd thought I'd do more research about it. Usually, the more bad reviews I read about a film, the more curious I get. This one had all the ingredients screaming to go and check this dud out since most were panning it and since I usually love to go against the grain (I must decided for myself whether I liked the film or not), I though I'd go see on my intuition. I was not disappointed. The bad reviews were screaming camp and that it is!... The bad reviews were screaming stereotypical gay stuff...that it is too! and bad reviews were screaming offensive and felt sick... yes you will! And those are exactly the three reasons I went to see it and I was not disappointed. As a matter a fact I had myself several laughs throughout the film while some, I'm sure, frowned upon the subject matter and all that was happening. I just wish the was more character development of the pilot who claimed to be heterosexual but had his issues, mostly because that was one interesting sub plot I would have love to see more of and how it all gets resolved. Overall, If you just wanna get out of the summer heat and immerse yourself in a different kind of Aldomovar movie, this may be for you. However, you should still yield the warning from previous viewers who have written their pans and puns of the film, for I can see how their points are just as valid. Too bad for them I took their hostilities towards this film and turne it into a delight for me. So go figure. Take a chance, and know that you may or may not like it. I don't think there an in between with this film. For what it's worth, I, probably more than most here, appreciated this Almodovar effort.",1376352000,2,1842,4.295977011494253
5625221,4,B00BJ0RFT4,"Seeing a new movie by Pedro Almodovar is always such  a visual treat. ""I'm So Excited,"" his latest confection-- actually his first full-deck comedy since ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown""-- is certainly no exception to what we have come to expect from this most gifted of directors. As always, the opening frames of what the critics are calling his gayest movie yet are a delight to behold. Then the fun begins with Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz making cameo appearances.  The movie is certainly high camp in every way since 99% of the action takes place several thousand feet above ground in a plane that is circling Toledo,  Spain because of  a landing gear problem.  Or as one character asks when she learns of the problem, ""Toledo, Ohio""?

There is quite an assortment of crazy characters here: gay airline attendants,  a bisexual pilot, another pilot willing to experiment, an admitted unclaimed flower, a newly-wed couple, a hit man-- in a word quite a collection of over-the-top creations of Mr. Almodovar, most of them flying business class.  Although the movie is a tad long-- at about two hours-- and gets a bit claustrophobic, the delightful ending will blow you away and makes up for any minor deficiencies ""I'm So Excited"" may have.  The director takes his own advice here-- that comedy should not be concerned with political correctness-- as anything is likely to happen.

Having seen in the past few days two fine but terribly sad movies ""The Attack"" and  ""Fruitvale Station"" I was so ready for Mr. Almodovar's latest gift that is guaranteed to make you smile.",1374883200,,1590,4.851851851851852
5625222,4,B00BJ0RFT4,"The subjects are different, but the style is unmistakeable. This is an Almodovar film, brightly lit, deeply colored, with a bunch of characters who not only don't act in their own best interests, but whose actions cannot be predicted rationally. In this case, nearly everyone in the crew is gay, from screamingly to not even knowing. The passengers in business class, which is only a quarter occupied, make up the rest of the characters we need to deal with. There is of necessity a great deal of suspension of disbelief, as passengers parade through the cockpit, an economy passenger spends the entire flight wandering around business class and the cockpit, and the intercom phone is used to make calls to the ground, but broadcast over the public address system for all to hear. It doesn't stop anyone from making very personal calls. Oh, and the entire sardine-packed economy class, including the crew, have been drugged into sleep -except for a frumpy psychic. Okay, we're ready.

The business class passengers are the usual mix - a celebrity dominatrix, a hired assassin, a fleeing, fleecing CEO, a drug-addled honeymoon couple, a lonely psychic and a self absorbed narcissistic film star. Just like every flight you've ever been on.

The stars are clearly the stewards, whose cartoonish gay affectations, too tight uniforms and karaoke performance to divert the passengers (a fabulous parody of the American musical) are the glue that holds everything together.

All in all, a romp different than the usual Almodovar - less puzzling, more gay and a whole lot more fun. If you like Almodovar, you will love I'm So Excited.

5625223,5,B00BJ0RFT4,"I have proclaimed so many different Almodovar films that it seems almost cliche to say, but, this super hilarious ultra homosexual romp is definitely the one. While it may finally be entirely too gay for fans of Almodovar's less literal works, this one has me in stitches from the very first frame. Opening with cameos from Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz, Almodovar answers a request of mine in part though they are not fully realized roles. The audience I saw it with was a mix of consistent laughter as myself or cold silence like the asinine gentleman in the squeaky theater seat a row ahead of me without the common sense to move to another seat despite every move he made causing a loud squeak. Filmed almost entirely inside of an airplane, somehow the signature Almodovar cinematography still comes through particularly in the wardrobe of arguably the most gaupo newly wed who undoubtedly will be a fixture in future Almodovar movies. The character of a virginal psyche is played by Almodovar regular Lola Duenas who down plays her stunning beauty to nearly unrecognizable effect. The role of the Classico sex symbol is embraced by Cecilia Roth, another Almodovar regular. The stewards are all regulars as well with Javier Camarras, Raul Arevalo y Hugo Silva. They lipsyched their English to perfection in a funny choreographed taken on The Pointer Sisters title song classic. As with any Almodovar Pelicula, he leaves you greatly missing Espana. The few scenes e las calles de Madrid are simply enchanting. Whenever el director wants to make another film in Madrid, I cannot wait. Worth numerous viewings for its great dialogue and performances, this is Almodovar reaching yet another plateau.",1373155200,14,1704,5.024734982332156

5625239,4,B00BJ0RFT4,"Pedro Almodvars 19th feature Im So Excited! (2013, Los amantes pasajeros) was sold by the director as a light, very light comedy and that has been how people generally have accepted it. It is one of his most commercially successful films (especially in Spain) but got a mixed reception from critics worldwide, the view being that it is insubstantial, crude and rather pointless. Following the spectacular and deeply satisfying melodramatic complexity of his films announced first of all with the very serious The Flower of My Secret (1995) and developed through masterworks such as Live Flesh (1997), All About My Mother (1999), Talk to Her (2002), Bad Education (2004) and Volver (2006), Im So Excited! seems on first glance to confirm the creative rut that Almodvar has fallen into along with the over-intricate navel-gazing of Broken Embraces (2009) and the cold genre mechanics of The Skin I Live In (2011). Actually, its worth checking again, for this film may in retrospect mark an upturn in his fortunes, the regaining of his artistic mojo which I had thought he lost on Broken Embraces. Buried underneath the light frothy filthy fun of all the camp goings-on aboard an airplane flying in circles unable to land is a very angry political subtext which Almodvar has acknowledged in interview. On the surface it is all light fun, but underneath it catches the prevailing zeitgeist of a Spain gone to the dogs in a way that recalls the precise pin-pointing of an era in his very first picture Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980), the film which epitomizes the La Movida Madrilea attack on Francoism and the celebration of the new found democratic freedoms.

Indeed, Almodvar has always been concerned with politics and society in his films even if he has always been attacked by people on the right wing for being too frivolous, and he has generally avoided admitting in public that his films are serious in this way. Almodvar is savvy about marketing his product and perhaps that lies behind a reluctance to admit openly that his films taken in total amount to almost 40 years of commentary on the dramatic transition in Spain from fascism to democracy which has been essayed in film after film exploring transience and identity search which take place in three general arenas  politics and society, the human body and in film-making itself. It is refreshing to see Almodvar finally coming clean in Im So Excited! by making explicit his stand on the left as a critic of the incumbent corrupt conservative power structure. He says the film is the most political film Ive ever made, and the most local. Local to Spain, that isThe passengers are going around in circles, they don't know where they're going to land or how they're going to land. And in real life we don't know how were going to get out of this [economic recession], who will be in command, what the risks are and how dangerous it is. For the Spanish people its a very clear metaphor for society.

For non-Spanish people Im So Excited! is primarily a light camp comedy and perhaps that has always been the basis of misunderstanding for how Almodvars films have been understood by audiences around the world. Spanish people recognize the director as a cultural symbol of a light joyous era of Spanish history sandwiched between 40 years of Francoism on one side and 30 years of economic gloom and doom on the other. Spanish people may not all like him, but no doubt they do connect exactly with what Almodvar is all about, whereas foreigners must reach in from the outside to get at his essence whilst constantly being dazzled by the surface frivolity of prancing Jocks in frocks, sexual licentiousness and pill-popping junky wet dreams all encased within ludicrous over-ripe melodrama and visualized in the most gaudy primary colors. With all the tacky kitsch on display its a tough ask for foreigners to buy Almodvars deeper socio-political resonances and this film is no different from the rest.

The fun and games start before the Airbus A340 takes off for Mexico on the tarmac of Madrids Barajas airport as Len and Jessica (a delightful cameo scene for Penlope Cruz and Antonio Banderas) screw up their job as ground staff due to a sudden announced pregnancy. They forget to remove the landing chocks which get tangled up with the landing gear so making it impossible for the plane to land once air-born. Cut to a couple of hours later and inflight we find the flight-crew dealing with the problem. Economy class passengers are all knocked out with a muscle relaxant and we meet the various passengers in first class who are allowed to party on as they deal with the truth of their predicament. These characters are Ricardo Galn (Guillermo Toledo), a Casanova-actor clearly based on Ivan from Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988); Norma Boss (Cecilia Roth), a dominatrix-proprietor of a luxury escort service en-route to service a client; Bruna (Lola Dueas), a good-natured but nave psychic virgin en-route to Mexico to find dead bodies for a nefarious organization; Mr. Ms (Jos Luis Torrijo), a corrupt banker on the run from the authorities; Infante (Jos Mara Yazpik), a sinister security advisor on a mysterious mission; and two nameless newly-weds (Miguel ngel Silvestre and Laya Mart) en-route to their honeymoon and horny as hell. Taking care of them are three gay and very camp stewards, Joserra (Javier Cmara), Fajardo (Carlos Areces) and Ulloa (Ral Arvalo); and piloting the plane are Captain Acero (Antonio de la Torre) and co-pilot Benito Morn (Hugo Silva). Gender-bending is on the menu from the get-go, but when the stewards start knocking back the tequila and the passengers start reacting to the possibility of looming death the film escalates wildly into a drunken, drug-fuelled farce, the highlights of which including a brilliant rendition of The Pointer Sisters title song (worth the price of admission alone to see) mimed by the stewards, and a mescaline-spiked Valencia cocktail-induced orgy in which everyone lets their hair hang down. It would be tedious and criminal to give away the plot, but there is a delicious sub-plot coming from the philandering Ricardo Galn calling his girlfriend Alba (Paz Vega) who is about to jump from a high bridge because he has just dumped her. The call stops her jumping, but she drops the phone and it lands in the bag of Ruth (Blanca Surez), another of Ricardos exes who is still recovering herself from being dumped. Those familiar with Women on the Verge will relish what transpires, Carmen Machi playing the Chus Lampreave role and Surez playing a young version of Carmen Mauras Pepa. All the characters have their own stories to tell and the total effect is fast, furious and very funny with all the performances spot on. Cmara and Dueas are always a joy to watch and those who remember de la Torres macho monster husband Paco in Volver will be astonished to see the sensitive bi-sexual pilot he essays here. Grasping her role with full gusto most of all for me though is Cecilia Roth returning here as Almodvars eternal whore after her brief wondrous knockout performance as Manuela in All About My Mother. Terrifying as the first class passenger from hell organizing a petition protest against the cabin service, with an aphrodisiac inside her theres no holding back this woman

Im So Excited! is Almodvars first straight up comedy since Women on the Verge and perhaps many people took offence at it because it seems so fanciful and disconnected with anything substantial. Women on the Verge works partly because it is rooted in Jean Cocteaus La Voix humaine and the seriousness of a pregnant woman being jilted. It is also a statement of one of Almodvars most trenchant, most enduring themes  women surviving the evils of men. This one is much harder to quantify for foreign audiences, but clearly the filthy farce isn't so fanciful once we relate it to the films socio-political undertow. Clearly Spanish people would delight in the farce (so much high-speed Spanish flashing past lightning quick suggests there must be so many nuances English subtitles cannot hope to catch), but they would also grasp the plane as a metaphor for Spain with the passengers a metaphor for themselves. The working class knocked out while the filthy rich party on upstairs is how many people in the depression weary country see the real situation. One of the first class passengers (Mr. Ms) is a corrupt bank president who is fleeing the country after having swindled thousands, especially over hugely expensive white elephant government construction projects financed on the never-never such as the Ciudad Real airport which cost a billion euros and is now closed. The airport is referenced in the script as well as used by Almodvar to shoot the final images as the plane crash-lands. The fact that Almodvar points his camera at the deserted concourse of the airport as we hear the plane land outside speaks volumes of the hopelessness of the situation of Spain even if the tacked on happy ending is obligatory. Mr. Ms also reads his newspaper and we see an article entitled Top 10 Political scandals. As everyone knows Spain has been embroiled in scandals for decades at every level from the King on down, and Norma Boss gets great pleasure in telling everyone that she has incriminating photos of all the top people including No. 1 (the King) so that the whole power-structure is suggested to be exploited and corrupt.

Perhaps key to understanding this film is that all the farcical frivolity refers back to the 1980s and the radical spirit of La Movida Madrilea. As Almodvar says, I tried to recapture the same mood when I was writing in the Eighties, when Madrid had changed. The movie is a tribute to the Eighties. That was when we started with democracy and there was an incredible explosion of freedom in every sense. So in the movie, the passengers and stewards drink a lot, scream a lot, *** a lot and take drugs. For me that was the spirit of the decade  but above all it breathes freedom. The music chosen and the very deliberate use of his most successful film of that decade (Women on a Verge) couples with the camped-up goings-on we relate especially to the first two movida films he made, Pepi, Luci, Bom and Labyrinth of Desire (1982) to make for what amounts to a protest at what is happening right now in Spain couched in the movida language everyone connects with that brief period of Spanish history where the people experienced freedom and hope. Its interesting that Almodvar is strongly connected with 15-M, a youth protest movement disenchanted not only with the ruling centre-Right Peoples Party, but with all political parties. With most politicians selling out the interests of the people to corporate and banking interests, it is no wonder many Spanish people have lost confidence in the political system that controls them and it wouldnt be over-stating it to see Almodvar seeing the current situation as being the new fascism with the period of the 80s seeming to be even more representative of hope and freedom lost. Im So Excited! couldn't have been more timely, working as a hilarious farce on the surface whilst lashing out at the powers that be underneath. Strongly recommended.",1457568000,2,11232,4.880041906757465

5625265,4,B00BJ0RFT4,"Uneven, but a lot of fun, with some serious thoughts about politics, class and the economy of modern Spain nicely hidden in the mix of sex and absurdity.

This (very intentionally) harkens back to Almodovars anarchic, rough edged early sex farces like Pepi, Luci Bom, but now he's re-approached that kind of story with the technical mastery of a lifetime making ever more sophisticated films.

That cuts both ways. On one hand, the gorgeous color-popping polished visuals and high-level performances make this even more of a joy to watch. On the other hand, its very smoothness takes some of the bite out of Almodovors early punky biting the hand that fed him, pushing the limits of film in post-Franco Spain.

But forgetting all that serious mumbo-jumbo, this is fun sexual and political farce, 90% of which takes places on an airplane that may be doomed. Led by three very funny, very gay flight attendants determined to keep the upper-class passengers distracted from whats really going on, using everything from musical numbers to mescaline (the economy class passengers have simply been drugged and put to sleep; a perhaps heavy handed but effective comment)  the flight gets wilder and wilder as those ruling class passengers reveal their secrets  sexual, social and personal - and their libidos. As do the flight crew.

5625282,4,B00BJ0RFT4,"The latest film by Pedro Almodovar is unexpectedly light but it is also undeniably funny. The unlikely source for inspiration by the Spanish auteur seems to be the hilarious film Airplane! (1980), which itself was a parody of the 1970s disaster movies.

A plane bound from Madrid to Mexico soon finds itself in serious trouble, flying in circles and looking for a runway for emergency landing after its landing gear is found to be broken (thanks to a couple of clumsy ground crew workers played at the beginning of the movie by Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz in very fast cameos).

With a plane male crew that seems to be about 80% gay (the movie includes tons of gay jokes), the first class (the tourist class has been conveniently drugged) includes a corrupt businessman on the run, a women who is both a psychic and a virgin desperately trying to end being one, an aging lothario, a porn actress (Almodovar regular Cecilia Roth) who claims to have hundreds of sex videos of Spains's most powerful men, and a mystery man who turns out to be a Mexican hit man.

The comic highlight of the movie has the three gay male stewards perform a campy cover of the Pointer Sisters catchy hit ""I'm so excited"" (hence the title of the film in English).

The movie is certainly not very deep, and some Almodovar fans will probably be disappointed, but those who watch it with an open mind and are not easily offended by raunchy humor, will probably find themselves entertained.",1419897600,,1470,4.664092664092664
5625283,3,B00BJ0RFT4,A little confusing for the overall message typically loud and clear in Almodovar's films. Perhaps I did not get it.,1419638400,,115,4.8
5625284,1,B00BJ0RFT4,"I really love Pedro Almodovar's work and own nearly all of his films. As I was combing through amazon.com for Spanish movies I stumbled upon this one and thought I would buy it. But at nearly $30 for the blu ray I was hesitant and put it on my wish list to think it over. But a few days later I found it at the local library while online browsing through the movie section. I told myself if it was really good I would consider investing in the exorbitant price for this movie after watching it as I like collecting good movies. Boy, was I so glad I didn't spend the money for this rapaciously priced piece of garbage. This is by far the only film I have seen by Almodovar that I can't stand and probably the worst movie I've seen in a very long time.

I love a good comedy but this was such an unintelligent attempt at humor with cliche stereotypes that just don't need to be perpetuated in movies. This movie might have been passable had it been released about thirty years ago for shock value. But this has already been done with storylines like ""Mujeres al Borde de un Ataque de Nervios"" but even though that movie was silly and over the top with camp, it was also intelligent and is an Almodovar classic.

I'm not a prude by any means but the overuse of preposterousness such as the flight crew giving passengers drugs which leads to orgy scenes or the flight crew allowing passengers into the cockpit to have  personal conversations about the pilot's personal sex life is just incredibly dumb. And the several scenes of flight attendants perpetually drinking on the job just wasn't funny. It was redundant and overdone.

There is a scene where the three male flight attendants (all of which are exceedingly affected effeminate Spanish gay stereotypes) do some choreographed number to the song ""I'm So Excited"" by The Pointer Sisters (1982) which I'm guessing is how this Spanish movie got it's English title translation from ""Amantes Pasajeros"" which literally translates ""Traveling Lovers"" or ""Loving Passengers.""

One of the main characters in the movie is performed by Cecilia Roth who was the main actor in Almodovar's award winning film ""Todo Sobre Mi Madre"" (1999). Her character in ""I'm so Excited"" is some cougar dominatrix prostitute who has high end ""John's throughout the country of Spain. I actually found this movie by doing a Spanish actress search at my local library with her name. And when I discovered that Cecilia Roth was in this movie I thought I would be able to enjoy a decent film. I've enjoyed her work in other movies but with this film I was embarrassed for her as well as all the other actors' rolls in this film.

I know I'm going on and on but I will close with a brief summary of the film itself:

This is a movie about a Spanish airline traveling from Spain to Mexico City. In business class there are only a handful of passengers which is where the majority of the movie takes place with more scenes in the cockpit and one or two scenes in the coach/economy section of the plane. Problems arise with the actual plane itself which doesn't even make it over the Atlantic but instead rotates in circles over Spain looking for a place to land. It's a bit of a crisis to try and land the plane due to faulty inoperative landing equipment. So the movie is supposed to be a comedy based on the flight crew doing all that they can to keep the passengers calm and collected while they try to safely land the plane.

The main characters consist of two pilots, three male flight attendants and three or four female flight attendants (which you barely ever see). Passengers consist of a psychic virgin, a Mexican assassin, a cougar dominatrix prostitute/""madame"", a corrupt CEO, a famous film star who is a womanizer and some newly wed couple who bring their own drugs and practically sleep throughout the whole flight.

Drugs and alcohol are used as a way to sedate passengers but in one instance it lead to an orgy on the plane. It was like a bathhouse moment in the air. Everything about this film was over the top and it became exhausting really fast. It's one thing to be inundated with good humor so that you laugh until it hurts. But the humor in this film is utter rubbish. I can't even call it humor because it's not funny. It falls flat in almost every scene. It's tawdry and a huge disappointment.",1418688000,,4334,4.539052496798976

5625287,4,B00BJ0RFT4,"The strength of this cast made this sound like it had to be a heck of a good movie.  Pedro Almodovar directing, Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz acting, plus a bunch of other male and female actors, better known to Spanish than American audiences, this movie is like the Spanish version of the old American comedy, Airplane.  The dialog is in Spanish, but the English sub-titles are well-done.
If its the Spanish Airplane, the comedy is far less slapstick but more explicitly sexual, and the action is a little more slowly paced.  In other words, a little more subtle and thoughtful comedy than ""Airplane"", I found myself suddenly realizing how ludicrous some of the dialog actually was.  A ""Peninsula"" airline plane sets flight from Madrid headed to Mexico.  Soon after takeoff it becomes apparent the landing gear is stuck inside the plane and cant be extended for landing.  The pilot requests emergency landing at an airport in Spain, but for some reason all the runways are tied up [a strike at an airport, I think, has something to do with it].  They circle for hours, burning off fuel and waiting for a landing strip to flop onto.  Meanwhile, we get to know pretty much ALL the passengers and crew.

The most outrageous conversations take place, but in such a seemingly normal fashion that how funny they actually are is understated.  My favorite I suppose is the pilot and the co-pilot (as they prepare for a crash-landing) jumping back and forth between highly explicit dialog about their sexual orientations and activities, and the sequence of orders for landing.  But theres so much more: the air stewards [all of whom are flamboyantly gay], the psychic, the hitman, the fleeing businessman who mismanaged the construction of La Mancha airport [shades of Don Quixote], the Spanish Heidi Fleiss who knows all the sexual proclivities of the top 600 members of Spanish society, and on and on.  The title comes from the song, Im So Excited, which the stewards perform with enthusiasm trying to distract passengers from the emergency.

This (very intentionally) harkens back to Almodovars anarchic, rough edged early sex farces like Pepi, Luci Bom, but now he's re-approached that kind of story with the technical mastery of a lifetime making ever more sophisticated films.

Led by three very funny, very gay flight attendants determined to keep the upper-class passengers distracted from whats really going on, using everything from musical numbers to mescaline (the economy class passengers have simply been drugged and put to sleep; a perhaps heavy handed but effective comment)  the flight gets wilder and wilder as those ruling class passengers reveal their secrets  sexual, social and personal -  and their libidos.

5625302,3,B00BJ0RFT4,"Mmmmm, I'm still not sure what to make out of this movie.

It wasn't a bad movie, but it's more along the lines of B-movie gay flicks you sometimes stumble across from TLA or Wolfe Video. Within that category, I'd say it's ok and maybe worth the $4.00 to rent or buy used.

But this isn't just a run-of-the-mill B-rated gay movie. We're talking Almodovar here, which is why and how most people are going to stumble upon this flick. I can't say I know why he made this movie, why it deviates from much of what he has done so far, or even what the whole point of the movie was. As such, I have just watched it, but I'm still a little confused.

True to Almodovar style, he uses the actors and actresses he is most comfortable with. Thus, if you have seen his other movies, most of the main characters will be familiar to you. Heck, there's even an intro cameo by Penelope Cruz and Antonio Banderas. The movie is in Spanish, with subtitles, and it flows at a decent pace.

This is not a bad movie. I sat through it all, and at times, had a few chuckles. The basic storyline is fairly straight-forward, and there are a lot of subtleties here to relate to, especially if you have ever flown on a plane. There is a back-story, and some attempt was made at character development. But in a lot of ways, it's a gayer version of the movie, Airplane, with ample amounts of silliness, camp, absurdity, and mock drama. In fact, I have to surmise that the movie, Airplane served as an impetus for this movie.

If this wasn't a movie directed by Almodovar, I'd probably give it four stars and suggest you watch it. I love most of the movies I have seen by him, however, and this just doesn't measure up to what he has done in the past. But then, maybe it's not supposed to, and I guess that's ok.",1403827200,,1781,4.257396449704142

This is a slice of whimsical fun all wrapped up in a potential air disaster. Also I remember this being advertised as starring Penelope Cruz and Antonio Banderas - well it doesn't, they both make a brief cameo at the beginning and that is it. The real stars are on the plane. This is Peninsular Airways and the cabin crew in Business Class are all gay - now whilst that might be a bit stereo typical it also makes for great fun.

Early on in the flight they realise that the landing gear is in a condition that could be described as `sub-optimal' making a conventional landing impossible.  Meanwhile the passengers that have not been drugged start to ask questions. We also get to hear their back stories which range from being a dodgy banker, an international dominatrix, a would be nympho and a failed actor to name but a few. The cabin crew meanwhile do their best to distract the passengers by indulging in rarefied skills that include exotic cocktail making and cabaret. Seriously if your plane is going to crash you want these guys being the ones to tell you.

I absolutely loved this film; it puts a smile on your face right from the opening credits right up until the end. There is nearly something for everyone here and though some of the themes are dark it is all done with a flair for the funny. Javier Camara as steward `Joserra' is excellent he is also great in `Chefs Special' and `To Hell with the Ugly' too.

The main theme (if there is one) is the sexual orientation of the pilots and crew as well as the passengers in board, and after a short while that becomes very ho-hum.

When it appears as though the end is in sight, the pilots, flight crew, and passengers of a plane heading to Mexico City look to forget the anguish of the moment and face the greatest danger, which we carry within ourselves. A technical failure has endangered the lives of the people on board Peninsula Flight 2549. The pilots (Hugo Silva and Antonio de la Torre) are striving, along with their colleagues in the Control Center, to find a solution. The flight attendants (Carlos Areces, Ral Arvalo and the chief steward (Javier Cmara) are atypical, baroque characters who, in the face of danger, try to forget their own personal problems and devote themselves body and soul to the task of making the flight as enjoyable as possible for the passengers, while they wait for a solution. Life in the clouds is as complicated as it is at ground level, and for the same reasons, which could be summarized in two: sex and death. Bizarre love/hate/sexual extravaganzas are provided by Miguel ngel Silvestre and Laya Mart as well as Lola Dueas (kooky and a virgin visionary), Cecilia Roth, Jos Mara Yazpik, and for momentary screen decoration we get to see Paz Vega, Antonio Banderas, Cruz, Blanca and Agustn Almodvar.

5625328,3,B00BJ0RFT4,"""Almodovar's comeback to comedy"", everybody said before the release of this movie. After so many intense dramas, such as Volver (2006), Broken Embraces (2009) and The Skin I Live In (2011), the director wanted to make a lighter film, less serious and full of jokes. However, I must say the result is not as funny as it should've and could've been. His last comedy, Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown (1988) was a masterpiece, perfect from the very first scene till the ending credits. I still like Almodovar, though, and expect his next film to be as good as his best masterpieces.

5625334,3,B00BJ0RFT4,"In Im So Excited, Pedro Almodvar returns to the territories covered by his earlier works like Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown: outrageous comedies that made his name internationally famous. He takes up once again sex-(and death-) related matters in his latest work, but for all its subject matter Im So Excited comes off as tame.

Because of technical failure, a Mexico-bound airplane has to keep flying in the air. Three flight attendants Ulloa (Ral Arvalo), Fajardo (Carlos Areces) and Joserra (Javier Cmara, impressive as a devoted nurse in the director s Talk to Her) attempt to calm down the passengers with a musical (dancing to a Pointer Sisters song) and spiked cocktail, but their efforts end up with passengers acting wild and confessing their secrets.

Some may argue that Im So Excited, with the crew and passengers in a confined space, is an allegorical tale like Stagecoach. Sure, I may be missing Almodvars social or political comment (if any), but still the film looks like a loosely assorted ideas and thoughts of the director, who failed to find a way to connect them in an effective way.

Some familiar faces like Antonio Banderas, Penlope Cruz and Paz Vega appear in a cameo role. Actors are all fine and the three flight attendants are all likable and funny, but production designs and costumes are just OK. For Almodvar fans this is a welcome return to his earlier days, a light-hearted film (much light-hearted than Volver) that somehow fails to be either entertaining or provocative.",1390694400,,1517,4.91796875
5625335,1,B00BJ0RFT4,"This was an absolutely terrible film.

There were opening cameos by Cruz and Banderas never to be seen again.

The actors were good, but the material was a disaster.

The only scene worth watching was a musical number two thirds of the way through.

Don't even think of it, save yourself the time and humiliation.",1390521600,2,313,4.636363636363637
5625336,5,B00BJ0RFT4,I was feeling blue and this just made my night. Total fun for those that enjoy campy gay humor time.,1390435200,,100,4.05
5625337,3,B00BJ0RFT4,"I like most of Almodovar's films and he has done much better than this amazing amalgam of atrocious audacity.
Not sure what he was trying to say here and it was way over my head.",1390262400,,178,4.114285714285714
5625338,3,B00BJ0RFT4,"First off, if you're Antonio Banderas and/or Penelope Cruz fans, you will be disappointed---the five minutes you see them at the beginning of the movie is all you'll see of them.  That said, Banderas' character forgets to take the wheel chocks from the plane, and thus sets the plot in motion, as they get sucked up into the landing gear (not the engine, which would make more sense) wrecking the machinery, forcing the plane to fly a circle, as an available airport is located.  From here on, it's all on a fairly cheap, if colorful, business class airplane set, and if that isn't enough, an entire cast of extras sleeps through the entire film, all of the coach section---female flight attendants included---having been drugged to avoid ""economy class syndrome"" which is never explained, but seems to have something to do with mass panic.

Not a lot is explained up front (unless perhaps it's all taken care of in Spanish) but all is known by the end.

To sum it up, the pilot and co-pilot are bi-sexual, or maybe the latter is closet gay...  All the flight attendants in business are gay.  Everyone else is straight.  A virgin seer (experienced as a psychic), a high class dominatrix who thinks someone is trying to kill her;  a corrupt contractor who is being blamed for the fiasco over the La Mancha airport (which in real life is a huge facility that has yet to open, no market being available for flights there) a TV or Movie star, with two female lives in tatters behind him; and a Mexican hit man.

Since the plane can't land, and might crash and burn when, eventually, it does, everyone copes as best they can, mostly by drinking, smoking pot, and eventually, drinking buckets of Valencia Cocktail (a champagne based drink that includes gin, but in this version also comes with mescaline).  Oh, I forgot, there's a hot married couple in business and once the Valencia cocktail starts going around, everyone gets real comfortable, and chummy and well, you'll see.

Like most Almodovar films, this one is high camp with a certain gay quotient, although here the gay-o-rama is set fairly high.  Most of the humor revolves around gay relationships between the crew, and gay sex, but, sex itself doesn't really happen---it's pantomimed, by the hetero set, but there's no nudity or even bare chests.  As an Almodovar work, it recalls ""Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown"" but, sadly, isn't nearly as good.  On the other hand, ""Women..."" isn't available to rent, buy or stream at the moment, either.

So why isn't ""Women..."" available to rent or buy?",1390003200,2,2559,4.757918552036199
5625339,4,B00BJ0RFT4,"People have gotten too used to new Almodvar and, loving the heaviness of The Skin I Live In and Bad Education, couldn't accept that the director decided to make a trifle. I don't think he's had a worse received movie in twenty years but, personally, while I adore the movies he's made in the past decade, I find it a nice palate cleanser.

If there's anything at all serious about I'm So Excited!, it's quickly undermined by the torrent of all variety of sex jokes. I have always appreciated how easily Almodvar mixes gay and straight cultures. That may seem obvious, but he's far from the only openly gay director making movies and, so often, they're treated as entirely different worlds. Straight directors like to leave the LGBT community as ancillary stereotypes, so they're out. For Almodvar, though, it doesn't matter if you're gay, straight, bi, a middle-aged psychic virgin with a thing for sleeping dudes. It's all good on Peninsula 2549.

The movie's persistence with that idea might rub some people the wrong way, but he's always been like this; it's just especially flamboyant here since we haven't seen it from him in so long. But it's great fun, especially given that he now has skills that far surpass what he had when he made Labyrinth of Passion, and I'm So Excited! is a great looking movie. It starts with a lovely little scene between Antonio Banderas (Matador) and Penelope Cruz (Broken Embraces) as tarmac workers in their first scene together, despite having appeared in a combined eight of the director's films. It's a nice little nod to two big stars who helped make his career and vice versa. After that, virtually everything takes place on the plane, with really only four rooms to work with. Despite that, the movie never feels claustrophobic and he doesn't have to recycle shots; it flows lightly and breezily, with gorgeous colors and nicely creative photography by Jose Luis Alcaine (Bad Education). The big scene, featuring the three stewards doing their rendition of the Pointer Sisters track that makes the title, is delightful. It's not the biggest or the best musical number out there, but it made me smile and I believe that's all Almodvar wanted to do with I'm So Excited!, which is fine by me.

The performances really help bring out what he was trying to do, as well. They mostly come from his newer repertory of actors, and we have great turns from Paz Vega (Sex and Lucia), Cecilia Roth (All about My Mother), Blanca Suarez (Shiver), and Lola Dueas (Talk to Her), and that's just the main cast of women. All the men are just as good, as well, from the aforementioned stewards, who are a hilarious trio, their pilot sometimes boyfriends in Antonio de la Torre (Volver) and Miguel Silvestre (The Distance), as well as Hugo Silva (To Hell with the Ugly) as a hitman with a target on the flight. All the performances are great fun and match the delirious sexuality that Almodvar is so good at delivering.

Sony's Blu-ray for I'm So Excited! looks great, too. The 1.78:1/1080p image is gorgeous, with bright colors that are nicely saturated and good solid black levels. Detail is top-notch and the image is always perfectly sharp. The 5.1 Master Audio track is great, as well. It's a busy mix, with good spatial effects, crisp and clean dialog, and a full-sounding score by Alberto Iglesias (The Flower of My Secret).

The supplements, unfortunately, are completely disappointing, with a short featurette that is a look at the production without narration and a half-hour look at the gang on the festival circuit. Neither is particularly interesting and that's all there is; not even a trailer.

5625340,3,B00BJ0RFT4,"I don't like to give spoilers, and truthfully there are few ""revelations"" in the story line, anyway.
Having said that, I think Almodovar totally wasted Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz in the opening simply for the sake of having them in the film. Yes, it was fun for a moment, but totally unnecessary for the plot.
You could literally cut the first 7 minutes off and never know something was gone.

There are some very subtle nods to ""Women On The Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" in this film, which made me chuckle. It's not a bad movie, but it's not as cleverly constructed as the director's earlier works. Perhaps he's been away from comedy too long. I certainly hope he makes another attempt at something humorous. Despite my comments on this film, I think he's one of the finest living directors.",1387929600,,802,4.647887323943662
5625341,4,B00BJ0RFT4,"At one level I'M SO EXCITED is very reminiscent of AIRPLANE! (1980) and AIRPLANE 2 (1982) in the way director Pedro Almodovar parodies the conventions and plots characteristic of disaster movies. The stereotypes are all there: the bisexual pilots, gay male cabin staff, compliant female staff, and a rogues' gallery of passengers including a Queen of S&M, a professional killer, a tycoon on the run after a financial scandal, and a young couple celebrating their honeymoon both physically and emotionally. Many of the jokes are crude as well as sexist; in this world gender roles are clearly (and it seems immutably) defined, with males reasserting their authority, both physical as well as sexual. If they fail to achieve this, then drugs will help them achieve their ends. At another level, however, Almodovar asks us to reflect beyond the superficialities of the jokes and consider how we cope with any situation in which there appears to be no way out. Do we just accept it with stoical endeavor, or make light of it? In the case of the protagonists in I'M NO EXCITED, the latter option seems more appropriate - at least they will try to obtain momentary pleasure (even if it is only visceral pleasure) as they progress inexorably towards their doom. Although the story ends happily, we should nonetheless use our experience of the film to reflect on our own behavior. Technically speaking, Almodovar's touch is as sure as ever as he crams a profusion of material into the film's short (90 minute) running-time, while ensuring that we never lose sight of any the characters involved.",1387929600,,1587,4.947565543071161
5625342,5,B00BJ0RFT4,"This movie is hilarious.  Yeah, many of the characters are gay, and sterotypical, but this movie is a laugh riot.  A very pleasant change for The Skin I Live In(great but very frightening).  If your a homophobe, skip this, but if not, hopefully you'll love this as much as i did.  Viva Pedro!!!!!!!!!!!!",1387843200,11,303,4.660377358490566
5625343,2,B00BJ0RFT4,"I own every film Almodovar has released on DVD. This is the first time he has bored me. I found ""Habla con ella"" creepy, as I did ""Mala educacion."" But these movies were both dramatic enough and skilled enough I wanted to watch them over. ""Los amantes pasajeros"" was simply boring.

The movie is largely self-celebration. The opening is a cameo for Almodovar's discoveries, Penelope Cruz and Antonio Banderas. Cute, but meaningless, except to set up the possible airplane crash that is supposed to provide the movie with suspense. It doesn't. You know Almodovar won't kill off these characters.

There are plenty of themes from the past, including an obsession with ""maletas"", a raped-in-your sleep scene, along with a loss of virginity, plenty of drugs and druggings, personal items dropping from the sky, evil businessmen, a dominatrix, and enough mincing, prancing and swishing to give anyone diabetes. Please! Give up the anything that lisps is funny routine. The three male stewardesses are grotesque, and the Captain is a troll. The lipsynch cover of the Pointer Sister's ""I'm So Excited"" is simply embarrassing, like watching Bob Hope in blackface. (Neither homosexuality nor drag queens bother me, I have dated a few. What bothers me is the laziness of defining gay as effeminate, and the bad taste of casting clowns for the parts. Javier C&aacute;mara looks like he has some sort of chromosomal deficiency.)

Lola Due&ntilde;as, with her innocent goofiness, is really the only saving grace of the movie. She plays a psychic who loses her virginity raping perhaps one of only two good looking men in the movie (three if you count the co-captain who might go gay or might not). But even the rape is boring, and her victim sleeps through it.

Cecilia Roth phones it in from under a wig and a vintage paisley dress. Her menace as a femme fatale isn't even false. It's like the meanness of an old drunk; pitiful.

I won't tell you not to see this movie. I could never skip a new Almodovar movie. (His last three Volver, Abrazos rotos, and La piel que habito, have been masterpieces.) Just make sure there's a good return policy on your purchase of this item.",1386115200,,2162,4.848238482384824

8569245,2,B00BJ0RFT4,"The cover image makes this look like it's going to be a lot of fun.  Unfortunately the laughs are few and far between.  It also seemed dated, it was made in 2013, but yet heaps of people, from flight attendants to passengers can just walk into the cockpit.  The film uses stereotypes of male flight attendants being flamboyant homosexuals. An unconscious young man being raped by a horny virgin middle aged woman is somehow suppoed to be funny.  It seemed for the most part like this was an 80's film of the quality that went straight to video.  Yet there are mobile phones and other modern references.  In fact the funniest (and well pretty much only) funny scenes are when the crew or passengers want to call people on the ground but the only way they can do this is with the passenger phone on the plane which is stuck on speaker phone so everyone else on board can hear the called's part of the conversation.

Basically a flight from Spain to Mexico City learns its landing gear has malfunctioned (thanks to ground crew cameo appearance actors Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz), so is just flying in circles still in Spain while waiting for an appropriate runway to become available.  Somehow the economy passengers have been put to sleep, and it's just business class with the three male flight attendants awake. Not many passengers in business class except for an old famous prostitute with stories to tell, a middle aged woman who claims to be psychic and a few others.  Drugs and alcohol for everyone seem to be the way the flight attendants decide to cope with the situation.
