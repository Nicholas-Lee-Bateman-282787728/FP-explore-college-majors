8317200,4,B001L4L98Q,"The information to back up Elvis Alive is in fact, there but the production team overloaded this video with too many snips & video of various Elvis interviews. The best program regarding the Elvis I s story was the one done with the late, great Bill Bixby (The Incredible Hulk, The Courtship of Eddie's Father).  Mr Bixby appeared in a few of Elvis's Hal Wallis produced movies (the mix to late 60s cream cheese ones) but great family movies; being rated G and ""clean"", almost old Disney-like (think the original Love Bug, Ghost & Mr. Chicken, original Shaggy Dog).",1470873600,,565,4.707070707070707

8317207,5,B001L4L98Q,"I thought this was great. I don't believe this because i'm a fan , people always put Elvis way up there ,he had a personal life too,We don't know what these people do on their own time , I'm sure he had  other intrests,and dreams he wanted to fulfill , Like John Travolta being a commerial airline pilot,who wudda thunk it.
