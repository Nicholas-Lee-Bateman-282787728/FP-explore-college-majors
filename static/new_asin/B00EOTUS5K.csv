The city of Lyon was very nice, especially the part with the very steep hill up to the unique abbey where I was rewarded with an authentic French accordion performance and tremendous views of the city.  There were other little surprises throughout this video, but this was my favorite.  Its a fun one!",1410566400,,398,4.486111111111111
