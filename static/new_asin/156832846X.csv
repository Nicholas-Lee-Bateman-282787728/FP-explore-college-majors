7796914,1,156832846X,"I am so glad to have gotten this from the library, and not purchased it.  My kids loved the emergency vehicles, but the Laurel and Hardy routines by the two ""stars"" Dave & Becky were very, very annoying.  Stay away!",1188086400,,215,4.35
7796915,5,156832846X,"I think that this is excellent. Also, this is sort of a previous episode reference to There goes A Fire Truck because of having shown fire trucks in this episode. I don't own There goes A Rescue Vehicle.",1137283200,,203,4.368421052631579
7796916,3,156832846X,"Generally, I try to support the Dave Hood video series simply because my grandson has received so much pleasure from watching them. As an ADHD 4 year old, he usually can concentrate enough on these videos to watch them in their entirety. My problem with the Hood series is not that they aren't entertaining, or that they don't keep the attention of the children who are viewing them. Rather, I'm concerned about the educational nature of the material and the interpersonal relations exhibited. When one watches enough of the series, it becomes evident that Dave Hood is not an educator at heart; rather, he is a producer who chose to release a series for children based upon a variety of vehicles. Often the interplay between Dave and Becky is demeaning and sarcastic in nature. The bickering and feuding does hold the kids' attention, but at what price? Are children learning that it's fun and jovial to bicker and be sarcastic toward those with whom we share our lives? ""Rescue Vehicle"" is probably the worst of the series in terms of the demeaning conversation between the two; in fact, it escalates into slaps and physical interplay at its worst moments. Whereas ""Police Car"" simply intimates disharmony, ""Rescue Vehicle"" actually exhibits it. Too much time is spent on the ""comedic"" nature of the interactions, and not enough time is allowed for actual educational enlightenment. The entire series would have been better served had the content centered more on the vehicles, and less on the characters of Dave and Becky, or Dave himself (depending upon the video). Of course, the kids do love the ""Keystone Cops"" schtick. I just wish more thought would have gone into the presentation of information and the interpersonal relationships of the characters. Dave Hood would do well to hire an educational consultant before he makes any more movies in this series.",995500800,42,1865,4.961661341853035
