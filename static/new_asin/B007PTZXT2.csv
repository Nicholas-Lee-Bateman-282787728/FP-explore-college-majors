5103690,1,B007PTZXT2,What a waste of money.......sorry I rented it,1419897600,,45,4.75
5103691,3,B007PTZXT2,I found the movie very hard to follow.  Would be very grateful if someone could explain what was happening in the present day to me.  I understood the flashbacks with Alan Turing.  I wish the movie was subtitled in English.,1410998400,,223,4.525
5103692,1,B007PTZXT2,Looks like these guys got their first video camera and tried to make a movie. The whole black and white imagery and very long drawn boring scenes forced me to cut it off in 17 minutes.,1360022400,,184,4.138888888888889
5103693,1,B007PTZXT2,Production and direction quality is lacking.  Dialog is nearly impossible to understand.  Story line is difficult to follow because of the mostly incomprehensible dialog.,1350604800,3,170,6.041666666666667
5103694,4,B007PTZXT2,"Plenty of maths in this film set in the city where persecuted genius Alan Turing lived, worked and died. The modern thriller elements are in black and white... the flashbacks to Alan Turing in the 1950s are in colour.",1334707200,,217,4.589743589743589

8520703,1,B007PTZXT2,didn't like it.,1435276800,,15,4.333333333333333
8520704,1,B007PTZXT2,Horrid...... Couldn't finish it and haven't a clue,1428796800,,50,5.375
8520705,1,B007PTZXT2,AWFUL..  could not watch more than 10 minutes..  just plain terrible.  Already deleted.  Very poor sound quality as voices are muffled.,1428710400,,135,5.285714285714286
8520706,1,B007PTZXT2,There is nothing good about this movie!,1427846400,,39,4.714285714285714
8520707,1,B007PTZXT2,So awful I could not stand to watch it to the end.  I would rate it -1 if I had to choice.,1425254400,2,90,3.090909090909091
8520708,2,B007PTZXT2,"This was not worth watching, and I deleted it after the first twenty minutes.",1424217600,2,77,4.571428571428571
8520709,1,B007PTZXT2,"This looks like an interesting movie, but after a few minutes, I stopped it and got a refund.

Sound editing is very poor. You have to turn the volume up to hear the dialog - and even then you can't understand half of it - but that makes the music REALLY LOUD, so you have to turn it back down.

Loud movies are fine, but when the music is so loud that it interferes with the dialog, that's a problem.

If it had captions on it, I could deal with that just fine, but there are no captions, making the movie unwatchable.

Terribly disappointing since the cinematography looks good, the acting is good (at least in the first 10 minutes before I turned it off) and the story synopsis is interesting.

Apparently, the DVD doesn't have any subtitles, either. Sad.",1422057600,,758,4.385714285714286
8520710,1,B007PTZXT2,"Dreadful low-budget film. I lasted 10 minutes. Bad enough that the movie creates mystery through obfuscation, but on top of that it's in a foreign language (British English) with horribly muffled dialog recording matched with sudden interludes of over-the-top loud sound track music.",1422057600,3,283,5.604651162790698
8520711,2,B007PTZXT2,"Very weird, slow movie with very little to do with Turing",1420070400,,57,4.2727272727272725
