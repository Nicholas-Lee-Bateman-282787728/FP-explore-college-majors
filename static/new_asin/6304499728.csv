7872922,4,6304499728,"This TV film is about the war between the justice department and the New York Police Department in the 70s about drug trafficking and corruption. The Justice Department wants to expose the corruption of the NYPD even if it leaves the field open to all drug-traffickers. One cop is thus taken in the maelstrom and does something a little bit reckless to be effective which will be useless because he will be expelled from the police.

The criminal manages to carry out his business and to escape any police investigation and arrest because he makes himself a double agent for the police and the justice department, accepting to trap the police, because he hates them, and because he can manage to escape them by doing so. The cop will finally commit suicide and the end is sad because the criminal is still at large in the world and the politicians who trapped the police are still doing politics.

In such conflicts of interest it is always the police that foots the bill and the criminals who cash in the benefits and profits. A sad story about the will to do one's copper's job effectively and the necessity to respect some rules even if these rules make their work ineffective and slow. The man who is taken in this machination will be destroyed and he will never be rehabilitated. A sad story about the conflict between effectiveness and political-correctness, and the result is always the same. That's probably why crime is still thriving. The time of the Untouchable is definitely finished.
