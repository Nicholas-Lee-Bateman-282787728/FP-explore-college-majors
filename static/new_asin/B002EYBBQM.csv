8368468,5,B002EYBBQM,"This is a wonderful series! It is set in the Old Australian Outback; an interesting twist to a good Western. I watched it as a child and loved it, and now I have watched it with my own children. I have an 11 year old boy, and 9, 7 and 2 year old girls. Our whole family loves it! It is one of the few shows we all truly enjoy together. Not too silly or sappy for the grownups at all. This teaches good values. Adults are respected, right is right, and wrong is wrong. All too rare these days. The characters are real, funny, and interesting, and the ongoing stories are interesting as well. We really care what happens to them all! Also neat to see Nicole Kidman join the show in the second season, before anyone knew of her. I really, really hope that Disney will choose to release the 2nd and 3rd seasons on DVD.",1358121600,7,814,4.158227848101266
8368469,5,B002EYBBQM,"These people at Five Mile Creek Station become family. You will not want the series to end. This is one of, if not the best series ever! Your whole family will love it. The series ran for 3 seasons. The story line is 5 stars. The acting is 5 stars. Unlike so many series that run out of ideas before they end. This series never gets boring. Every episode is wonderful. Why can't Hollywood make movies today as good as this one? I used to have the 20 volumes on VHS but sold them years ago. Today's TV programming makes me wish I had kept those old VHS tapes. I have tried to find the whole series on DVD but I can only find season 1 on DVD. I may buy the VHS tapes and transfer them to DVD so my Grandchildren can enjoy them as much as my children and I did.",1352764800,5,758,3.9607843137254903
8368470,5,B002EYBBQM,"I am shocked to find no reviews on this series. Our family watched this years ago, and was hooked. The characters are so real. I put it up there with ""Anne of Green Gables"".By the end of the series you will feel like you really know the characters. Jack is one of my favorite characters. Kate is full of fire and determination, but at the same time, unsure of herself. This is something you can sit down with your older children(14 and up) and not worry about sex scenes and cursing. The reason I say no younger children is that it is a western and there is shooting and killing, although nothing bloody or anything more violent than say ""John Wayne""movies. I promise you will not be disappointed.",1275177600,13,697,4.453125
