I am happy I purchased it.",1397520000,,199,4.405405405405405
8076743,5,B000AA3K2A,"My husband and I have been dancing swing for about 5 months now. I picked up this video to see if there were any new moves we could add to our growing repertoire and was pleasantly surprised.

A couple of the intermediate moves were a bit long and involved, but my husband and I were able to break them down and take away some very useful pieces. In addition, the whole Lindy/swivels section of the video was excellent and exactly what we were looking for to jazz up our swing.

As far as the instructors go, Donald Johnson is very good. He takes a no-nonsense approach that another reviewer found ""bored"". I don't agree and neither did my husband. He is teaching you to dance, not entertaining or falsely encouraging you. And I thought he looked like Edward Norton, not gay at all. I guess it depends on where you are coming from.

His partner, Kasia Kosak, is wonderful. I loved her dancing and styling. She looked like she was genuinely having fun and is a good model to follow/copy.",1321833600,,986,4.466666666666667
8076744,5,B000AA3K2A,This instruction video is done beautifully and absolutely very professionally.  The couple instructing are very elegant dancers.  It is very easy for someone to learn from this video.  They are very thorough and the videography is very well done.,1304208000,2,246,5.256410256410256
8076745,5,B000AA3K2A,"My husband & I love this video. It's easy to follow and you can take time learning the more difficult (intermediate) moves. When we're taught these at dance class, we just can't get it fast enough, but with this DVD, you can take your time and learn each step. There are 4 basic steps (beginner) and 12 intermediate steps, so you get a lot on one DVD. Highly recommend!! We also bought two from Shawn Trautman and this one is way better.",1257897600,6,437,4.341463414634147
8076746,1,B000AA3K2A,"a bored boring irish gay dude gives an intermediate level swing lesson.

the teacher has a lame way of explaining moves so even the most simple step is confusing.  he typically does everything in combinations of several moves at once.  if you're an ""absoulte beginner"" or even a beginner you will find this cd confusing.

the music is attrocious.  the teacher is so bored his lack of enthusiasm is infectious.  these dancers do not seem like swingers, swing cats or even swing dancers.  they come off as professionally trained ballroom dancers that are used to teaching at a senior citizens facility.

If you really want to learn East Coast Swing.  I recommend videos by Frankie Manning.  He's one of the originators of the style. You can peek him performing in the movie Hellzapoppin - considered one of the greatest swing dancing performances ever filmed.  Plus his videos are available on VHS for l-10$ right now.  CHEAP",1212364800,,923,4.846153846153846
8076747,5,B000AA3K2A,"I'm an intermediate male jitterbug dancer and wanted a DVD that'd teach me some new leadable steps. I take lessons, but often forget new moves unless I practice them regularly.

This DVD clearly shows the move, lead and follow footwork and frame. They repeat each several times, so you don't have too go back and forth a lot with the DVD. The instructors have very nice frame and crisp motions.

They start with the basic jitterbug step and go on from there with more interesting moves. I recommend this DVD highly.",1204588800,8,515,4.648351648351649
