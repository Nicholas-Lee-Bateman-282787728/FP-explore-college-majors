8716424,3,B00XPTBBRY,cheap remake of a very good original,1474416000,,36,4.285714285714286
8716425,2,B00XPTBBRY,"There are some nice scenes of a glowing UFO in the beginning of this movie.  I don't mind corny, but most of these actors are unlikable which makes the corniness stupid and annoying.  It is a remake of  ""Invasion of the Saucer Men""  and the original is much better.  Don 't waste your money on this.",1454198400,,299,4.267857142857143
8716426,5,B00XPTBBRY,"Fun made-for-TV silliness from Larry Buchanan.  It's a re-make of AIP's Invasion Of The Saucer Men with the Texas actors Buchanan liked to use.  Good looking digital transfer, though it appears they lifted the illustration for The Crawling Eye for their cover art.",1437004800,2,264,5.116279069767442
