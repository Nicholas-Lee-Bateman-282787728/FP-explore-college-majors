However, I got the impression from watching this DVD that the contents consisted of odds and ends chosen solely at random to fill a DVD.  In other words, the selection of the types of contents could have been better.  Next month I will buy volume 2.",1382227200,,309,4.203389830508475
8165784,4,B000M2E764,"Here's an opportunity to see a whole host of former `Naked News' presenters in all their glory. However, if you're not already a `Naked News' fan, this DVD will probably not interest you. For those who are not aware of its existence, `Naked News' is a half-hour show which airs six days a week. Its (female) presenters broadcast a range of news, magazine-type items and comment in various states of undress or completely nude. Despite this, the show is not overtly sexual in nature. In one of the other DVDs in the `Naked News' series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naked-News-Backstage-A-Documentary/dp/B000VEKGB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naked News - Backstage A Documentary</a>, one of the show's anchors, Sandrine Renard, speaks of its ""naturist attitude."" And this is plain to see with the collection of skits and sketches contained in `Turn the Other Cheek'. Any men who interact with the `Naked News' team are seemingly oblivious to the ladies' lack of clothes.

The material here is not typical of the show's output nowadays which, while often lighthearted, is, as previously mentioned, usually more straightforwardly biased toward news and features. Of the current roster of presenters, Sandrine Renard is most prominently featured with only fleeting appearances from Roxanne West, Victoria Sinclair, Christine Kerr, April Torres and Erica Stevens (Erica left the show in September 2008).

So, which former presenters can you expect to see here? I'm delighted to report that the adorable Lily Kwan appears quite a lot, at one point gatecrashing Gretchen Frazier's mock rant about the lack of ""brothers and sisters"" in `Lord of the Rings'. Taking her cue from this Lily decides that oriental people are similarly under represented in the film, ""What, we're only good in kung fu movies?"" she asks. Lily also gets competitive with Erin Sherwood after a messy race between them to see who could eat their pizza quickest. A series of events ultimately sees a slightly dizzy Lily about to compete in a swimming race with full make up and high heels. In another segment a completely naked Lily interviews `Family Guy' creator, Seth MacFarlane in his garden. Meanwhile Erin asks if she can take her top off during an interview with singer, Bif Naked. Other past presenters featured include: Athena King, Brooke Roberts, Devon Calwell, Samantha Page, Gia Gomez, Yukiko Kimura, Cameron Shore and Ashley Jenning. Michelle Pantoliano is also present with the first edition of her `Locker Talk' segment. Here, she shows us the complicated business of putting on a bra. Apparently, some women have to make more adjustments than others. The wonderfully ample Michelle has to make a few herself.

Some of the comedy routines are funnier than others, and there weren't many occasions when I was laughing out loud while watching this DVD. Nevertheless, I found it an enjoyable way to spend some time, but I'm a fan of the show. The DVD has three thirty-minute episodes along with a ton of bloopers, and let's face it, naked women overcome by giggling fits are great fun to watch. There are a couple of the show's `One on One' segments which usually feature a model talking about her career. In my opinion, the most interesting of those featured here is Mandy, a gloriously curvaceous brunette, with no apparent surname, but a string of qualifications. Beautiful and clever - some people have it all.",1225324800,3,3436,5.2097649186256785
8165785,3,B000M2E764,"For those who may not know (like me, prior to picking up this DVD), NAKED NEWS is kind of like lower tier Saturday Night Live skits, with a couple of twists.  The first twist is that it's based around women stripping down during the skit - usually while they're giving the ""news.""  The second twist is that the language is un-censored.

For myself, I find this to be a great idea.  However, it could have worked out better.  For one, if they hired better writers & made the skits more funny, it would have been more enjoyable.  The concept of NAKED NEWS is sound, but NN could use an injection of creativity.

The women are all attractive, although I didn't find any of them stunning.  What really irked me is that some of the hottest babes were only seen in bit parts on the blooper reel and / or the ""meet NN girls"" on the special features.  I was like ""Hey, I'd like to see a whole lot more of HER!""  Also, it would have been nice to have more multiple-woman skits rather than mostly all solo skits.

For what it is, this volume of NN is decent.  I will probably buy more NN volumes in the future in hopes that they will have a little better presentation than this one.  NN COULD be spectacular if placed in the right creative hands.",1219622400,4,1236,4.275862068965517
8165786,1,B000M2E764,"This DVD was a resounding disappointment.  First of all, the beautiful and elegant Victoria Sinclair, one of the world's classiest ladies even while broadcasting stark naked, is SEVERELY under-represented here.  Nor is the precocious charm of the lovely and funny Samantha Paige given much play.  The women who do show up most often, aside from the remarkably attractive Athena King, are those who would probably look better fully clothed.  And the comedic element touted in the all-too-brief item description is nearly non-existent.  All in all, this is a juvenile, poorly presented, ill-advised mess.  The Naked News show has a certain audacious class, with some occasional humor and informative value.  This DVD is a pitiful attempt to parlay that into a feature event.

One final note:  The title is utterly misleading. I had hoped to see more of the rearview, since some of these women's best body-feature is the derriere, but no such luck. The cheek referred to must be a facial one, because backsides most definitely do not abound here.

In fine, I'm grateful that I was able to turn around and re-sell the item, recouping most of my wasted money.",1196726400,13,1154,4.994764397905759
