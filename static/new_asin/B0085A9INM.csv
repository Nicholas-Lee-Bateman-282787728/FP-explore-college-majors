5132548,5,B0085A9INM,"I loved this movie, I loved the music and I bought it for my sister for her birthday.  I had no expectations so it by far exceeded them.",1349308800,,136,3.857142857142857
5132549,4,B0085A9INM,Enjoyed watching this film on a late Friday night coming home from a long exhausting week. It wasn't too deep and it was exactly what I needed. Filming at an actual concert made me long for those long weekend music festivals.,1348444800,3,225,4.512195121951219
5132550,4,B0085A9INM,"I saw the preview and thought, ""hmmm...""  Finally, on a night when I needed to zone, I pushed the buy button.  Turned out to be a really good movie start to finish, no boring parts, story keeps you the whole time, and the actors nail their parts. Plus there are some really epic scenes.  A shame this never was released in the States.  This was totally worth the risk, you'll enjoy it!",1347494400,2,385,4.305555555555555
5132551,4,B0085A9INM,The story line  and the acting is top knotch.  It is about finding love you were not expecting.  The story is done in a way that you would not expect.  Watch and enjoy,1346284800,,167,3.9696969696969697
5132552,4,B0085A9INM,"I really enjoyed the movie, the acting was very good and believable, nothing robotic or forced... there was great chemistry amongst the actors and each character behaved like they really would according to their personalities... and I loved how their whole ordeal began, and the interactions developed, and I was especially surprised at the depth and wisdom... anyone who reads Men's Health/woman's/cosmo will appreciate the concept of ""connections""... it was a really good movie.",1345593600,,480,5.5
5132553,3,B0085A9INM,"I recently finished watching all of David MacKenzie's catalog and this film defies them all. Filmed over 4 days at T in the Park it is a music maelstorm. When I caught it in the theater it was hard to hear most of the dialogue because of the festival. Luckily this release includes subtitles.
  Luke Treadway is Adam, part of a American pop music duo. He is vain and egotistical. Natalia Tena (of Harry Potter film fame) is Morello a woman band punk powerhouse. They are fire and water from the beginning. Both of their bands try to keep the peace by plying them with liquor.
  Add to the mix Alastair MacKenzie (the director's brother) as the manager of Adam's band, Mark. Mark is pure sleaze on so many levels. Drunk he's worse.
  The film is a rock music fantasy. Taming the Shrew in a music festival. It encapsulates the insanity of the festival and has great live music shots. It is unique film.",1344988800,,900,4.4573170731707314
5132554,5,B0085A9INM,"I had to order this dvd (under its original title ""You Instead"") from the uk and it only would play in my laptop.  Finally its being released to where I can watch it normally.
Its a very predictable story, yes. Alot of people aren't going to like it because of that.  It moves at a odd pace for a movie.  Frankly it moves more like real life.  Its set at a music festival and apparently every scene was filmed in one shot.  It has a very natural flow in that sense but is not hollywood and your basically seeing a video tape of these two dragging each other around and all that takes place with them.
2 rival bands get into it at a festival and a security guard decides to hand cuff the 2 singers together to stick it out for the rest of the night.  The two are racing around trying to find a way to separate themselves to they can go on as planned but they wind up falling in love.
I love the music and the general spirit of the film.  You also get to see some of natalia tenas musical talents (she has a band in real life called ""molotov jukebox"" their pretty great if you like gypsy steam punk which i do) .  Id recommend it to fans of the indie genre and harry potter fans (because she played tonks).  I say indie fans because most people that love structured big budget hollywood film aren't going to like this.  Its a matter of expectation.  Some people want frills you don't just find in small budget film.  I like the rawness of it.  Me, I could watch it every week.  I love the spirit of it.",1344297600,18,1500,4.109965635738831
5132555,4,B0085A9INM,"""If musicians can't get along what hope we got?"" After Morello (Tena) shakes Adam's (Treadway) car in order to make him stop playing guitar they start to fight. When a security guard drives by and sees them he decides the only way to make them get along is to handcuff them together. That sounds bad enough but they are at a music festival and are both scheduled to play and no one knows where the key is. For those that have been following my reviews you may have noticed that I am not a fan of cheesy, predictable, un-original movies. This movie is an exception to that rule. Five minutes in the two are handcuffed together and after about 6 minutes you know how it will end. That said it is still very entertaining and really fun to watch. The music is actually really good as well and the song where the sample ""Tainted Love"" is great. This is nothing more then a cheesy predictable love story but even so I enjoyed it and I recommend it. Overall, nothing new and won't keep you guessing but this is still very much worth seeing. I really liked it. I give it an B+.",1342137600,19,1069,4.297029702970297

5132563,5,B0085A9INM,Love this movie. Perfect little rom-com for a rainy day. Makes me nostalgic for my mid 20's. Predictable but makes you smile at the end. Love all the music! The mashup on stage of Tainted Love between Luke Treadaway and Natalia Tena is just awesome!,1436400000,,249,4.555555555555555

5132575,4,B0085A9INM,"Watch it for the music alone.  This guerilla-style movie really resonates with those who love music.  The love story is unconventional, yet touching.  You become wrapped up in the world of Adam and Murillo easily.  Luke Treadaway and Natalia Tena did a fabulous job creating a world of two bands that is believable and entertaining.",1415836800,,332,4.9818181818181815
5132576,4,B0085A9INM,"No, this movie will probably not surprise you, but it is thoroughly enjoyable anyway.  There could have been a bit more of a build up to the romance, but Luke Treadway and Natalia Tena have great chemistry.  I rather like the style the movie was shot and what seemed to be certain ""bloopers"" were actually left in.  It gave the film a less polished more real tone.  The music was also really good.  I could have done with fewer scenes with Adam's band mate and manager however.

I'm a sucker for a romantic movie with characters you actually like and root for to wind up together (which is so rare in Hollywood romcons), so this movie was right up my alley.  So, while not a particularly ground breaking movie, it is a pleasant way to spend a couple hours.",1415318400,,756,4.39568345323741
5132577,5,B0085A9INM,"Saw the trailer on another movie, loved it, and made plans to rent or buy it. Forgot said plans until finding it by chance on Netflix. I watched and loved every minute of the movie, and watching Adam and Morello go from fuedong strangers to a love struck couple. A definite must for music lovers and anyone into romantic movies.",1415318400,,328,4.483333333333333

5132582,5,B0085A9INM,"All of the one star reviewers don't get it. The main complaint seems to be no plot. This movie is for anyone who has been to a music festival or wanted to go. Enjoy it for the music. This is why you have to consider who is reviewing the movie.

5132587,5,B0085A9INM,"I don't usually like romantic movies but this one was special. Being a musician myself, I loved all the excitement of the musical festival, getting ready to perform on stage and the outpouring of love from the fans. I was surprised when I found out the true story about the key to the cuffs. These musicians however made a lovely couple and were made for each other. Funny how we meet people sometimes ! Adam was a great performer, liked his music very much. It was comical at times and depicted the beauty of youth.",1408492800,,516,4.442105263157894

5132595,5,B0085A9INM,An interesting concept: two strangers handcuffed to each other because they were fighting provides a good twist to the standard boy meets girl story. Good music and the fact that the movie was not only about a music festival but was actually filmed at one creates an energy that would be hard to manufacture.,1406419200,,308,4.722222222222222

5132599,3,B0085A9INM,"Meh... the quality was horrendous.  The premise was good, but the acting was pretty cheezy.  Seemed like the stars really were just band members and this was someone trying to do a documentary style film and told everyone, OK ""act""!
In this day and age, even done in this kind of free flowing style there is no excuse for poor video and audio.",1404777600,,343,4.428571428571429
5132600,5,B0085A9INM,"Wow!  An unexpected winner!  I knew I would like this movie, but I was worried about watching it with my husband.  I used the Harry Potter character angle and skipped the trailer --he was a little skeptical but I noticed shortly after the handcuffing he had  put his phone down and was watching the movie along with me.  My husband had such a good time with this movie we watched the tainted love scene twice and the ending shot just because it put us into such a good mood.  I was somewhat concerned that my husband wouldn't get into this because he is usually a high budget movie person, but once it got moving and the character relationships started forming he was captivated as well.  The music was awesome and the ""impromptu"" music was just a beautiful or energizing depending on which scene.

Love the characters, story and the way the music and atmosphere put us into such a good mood after. Romantic, Fun, Nostalgic.  I really want to go to a music festival again.... even the mud seemed fine.  So the movie had to be really good to make that seem fun!

Anyway, if you find yourself not really liking the beginning skip a little inward, say 10 - 12 minutes and it starts to make more sense and then by the Tainted Love scene you are hooked.

Give it a try!",1404604800,2,1264,4.377682403433476
5132601,5,B0085A9INM,"This was such an awesome movie! I've never wanted to attend a music festival till I saw this movie, it's so up beat, and I loved their version of tainted love!

5132602,5,B0085A9INM,This film is a great showcase of what it's like to go to a music festival and or play one. Actor's were chosen well and the music selection was wonderful. The relationship between the two main characters was interesting. Over all I thought this movie was great!! I'd tell anyone who loves music and movies to watch this one.,1403568000,,324,4.508474576271187
5132603,5,B0085A9INM,Love this movie.. I have watched it over and over again!  The storyline is believable and the movie is beautifully filmed with very real scenes.  Music is great in the film and the acting is also outstanding.,1403568000,,208,4.594594594594595
5132604,3,B0085A9INM,"Who among us has not had a wild random hook up at a 3 day concert/festival in Scotland? Shot at a huge concert it feels very real.

5132610,5,B0085A9INM,"Really refreshing movie and accurate portrayal of a festival (slightly glamorized and romanticized, understandably) I read some reviews that the plot is too simple and predictable but I enjoyed it thoroughly! It's fantastic for a relaxing night in where you want some romance with good music but don't want anything too complicated. Really great acting from the two leads and good chemistry! I also enjoyed the special features on the dvd where insight is given on the whole process of unprecedented (as far as I'm aware) 'guerrilla filmmaking'.",1396051200,,545,5.204545454545454

5132617,2,B0085A9INM,I might have made it further but couldn't stand the main character girl. There's a difference between strong willed and just a terrible person and she was defiantly the latter.

I like Alistair MacKenzie, but his character was very flat and just sort of there as the boyfriend of the rock star girl. Aside from a whole bunch of weird Woodstock reminiscent things going on, the plot of 2 rock stars getting stuck together and falling in love is pretty predictable, though there are some cute/humorous moments.",1392508800,,410,4.871428571428571

5132645,5,B0085A9INM,"Tonight You're Mine 4.5 stars and love 

Let me first say, Natalia Tena - Tonks from Harry Potter!!! I didn't recognize her straight away. But I loved her in this. I've watched it twice so far this week.

This is a British independent movie called You Instead (US title changed it to Tonight You're Mine. The premise stated that it takes part within 5 days at a music festival at T in the Park (a real festival in Scotland). It does feel like it goes through 5 days time, but actually only 2 days. It's written by Thomas Leveritt and directed by David Mackenzie. The film stars Luke Treadaway and Natalia Tena. It really shows the festival quite good (or as much as they could in 80 minutes). I loved how Adam (Luke Treadaway) and Morello (Natalia Tena) meet and greet the brothers from The Proclaimers just before the guys went on stage to perform. Really liked how they showed part of The Proclaimers performance to ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles).""

So as you can see, Tonight You're Mine is a music film with a plot. Adam (Treadaway) is in a two-man-band called The Make. They're a pretty popular band. Morello (Natalia) is the keyboard player for the all-girls-band The Dirty Pinks - whom Adam and his band buddy, Tyko, nicknamed ""The Vaginas."" Adam and Morello fight from the start and are handcuffed together by ""The Prophet"" for fighting. They will predictably get dumped by those they're dating and then fall in love with each other by the end. That's not much of a spoiler because I saw that coming the moment the two started fighting at the beginning.

This would be a perfect romantic comedy movie if it weren't for the vulgar Bobby (The Make's manager). I think they focused on him a little too much. And no matter what, he wasn't likeable for me. Especially when he was beyond drunk.

Other than Bobby, this movie reminded me of all the music festivals and concerts I've been to. The biggest one being The San Diego's Street Scene - a 3 day street festival. It was a pretty big festival with about a dozen bands that I recall watching. It in no way compares to the T in the Park, which looked like a Woodstock festival. But it's great to see a film that captures the music and crowd like this film.",1380931200,,2206,4.475124378109452
5132646,4,B0085A9INM,It's one of those movie that seem to have been the fly on the wall for anyone that has gone to a big festival and was done quite well. It starts a little slow but builds momentum throughout.,1379030400,,190,4.026315789473684
5132647,5,B0085A9INM,"I loved this movie. I watched it on netflix, and now i would love to add it to my collection of movies. Yes, it is very cheesy, and sort of predictable, but all chick flicks are very cheesy. If you like the Harry Potter movies, you might be happy to see that the lead girl in this movie is the same woman that plays Tonks. Anyways, it is a must see.",1378080000,,349,3.9295774647887325

5132649,3,B0085A9INM,"Strange but funny adventure of two people. Not quite a love story but kinda sweet. I wouldn't watch it agin, but it was a good movie to kill time.",1377734400,,146,4.068965517241379
5132650,3,B0085A9INM,Liked the sound track. When the movie focused on the main characters it was good when it didn't it wasn't.,1377648000,,106,4.35
5132651,4,B0085A9INM,"Just goes to show, once in a while, you can't put too much credence in other folks' opinion. I'd heard of this movie, had avoided it like the cooties because I'd read so many reviews that crapped on it. But I'd just gotten hooked up with Amazon Instant Video, and TONIGHT YOU'RE MINE was on the docket, free for show, and so I said what the fuksicle.

3.5 out of 5 stars for this one. TONIGHT YOU'RE MINE (Original UK title: ""You Instead"") establishes its core premise six minutes in. At the T in the Park, Scotland's premiere music festival, a popular American synth-pop duo, The Make, get into a brief skirmish - but more like a tug-of-war - with a fringe, all-chick British rock band, the Dirty Pink. A passing eccentric (Joseph Mydell) gets off his buggy and whimsically handcuffs the two bands' lead vocalists, Adam (Luke Treadaway) and Morello (Natalia Tena), together. Ensue shenanigans.

This is where that phrase ""Mileage may vary"" comes into play. As someone who used to frequent music festivals, I appreciate director David Mackenzie's efforts. He applies a vrit-style filmmaking here. Seemingly in improvisational fashion, his cameras worm and insinuate their way into the chaotic rhythms and scruffy ambiance of this music festival. I'm sure most of the weird-enthusiastic-not sober revelers caught on film aren't even aware they're being filmed for a movie. If you'd ever gone to a few of these, then this film will trigger some serious kicks of nostalgia. Mackenzie captures the vibrant, anything-goes atmosphere and that wild sense of fun and of being part of a massive event.

However, if you're not feeling any of that, and not feeling how the film captures the thriving indie music scene in the UK, then the core storyline may not be enough for you. Like others say, the plot's predictable and the characters barely sketched out. The two leads start out feuding and their combativeness lead them to say and do things that aren't very cool. But they grew on me, shallow characterization and all. I think the impetus to my liking them is the scene in which the Dirty Pink has to perform on stage with Adam still shackled to Morello's wrist. What follows - and I'm talking about the showstopping ""Tainted Love"" mash-up - embodies the film's saving grace, which is the two actors' musicality. Music saves the world, which I think is that eccentric in the buggy's point all along. It trumps the film's side notes of backstage break-ups, random hook-ups, liquor-induced face-planting in the mud, and other vapid excesses. When Adam and Morello are performing with their respective bands or engaging in duets (three of them), there's gravitas to them and, yes, dammit, integrity.

Also, Natalia Tena played ""Tonks"" in Harry Potter, so there's a curiosity factor well in place as well.",1377475200,3,2796,4.9048625792811835

I loved how they crashed each others concerts and discovered how much fun it was.  At first, there were spots where I couldn't really hear what they were saying, but if you know how they filmed this movie it became awesome that they got what they did.  Love the subtitle button!

But this movie is nothing but a love-letter to music festivals, and unless you already love the idea of a weekend spent in the mud with loud, drunk, high people listening to bands playing with overly-loud sound systems competing with the other band just right over there, this isn't a movie for you.  Self-indulgent and self-aggrandizing even for this music snob, and featuring a character in the guy's manager so creepy and disgusting that he takes the unlikable, pervy middle-aged man trope to new heights that no one was asking for, the redeeming quality of this movie lies in the thankfulness one has that most guys don't typically wear such deep V--neck t-shirts as the main character does in this movie.

5132662,5,B0085A9INM,"David McKenzie is one of those under-rated filmmakers who has kept making unusual and often uneven films with a lot of ambition and style. He gets close to his high standards in Perfect Sense, but in Tonight You're Mine  his sense of visual style, romantic fervor, and just plain joy of film making comes into full flower. His films have always had sections of brilliant editing, they are often peopled by difficult characters, highly nuanced performances but seldom has he adapted to an atmosphere so well. Much of this film was shot on location at a real music festival, and it is a marvel about how well the atmosphere works. Starting with a comical, almost cheesy beginning -- with two antagonistic characters handcuffed together through an evening; he works toward a totally predictable happy ending with a great deal of invention and originality. And what genuine fun it is to see him move there!  All in all, it shows a very talented director honing his exceptional craft -- he is one film maker that you can have confidence in: you know he's eventually going to produce a powerful important work of art because he keeps making better and better films.

The music is absolutely incredible as well and part of the live-experience. Musicians that you may actually recognize make cameos and the transition from stage performance to background music is seamless and a joy for your ears. If you love music and can appreciate a movie that is meant to be an experience, then you won't be disappointed.

But it's set up in such a whimsical way, with rich views into the lifestyle of performing rock musicians (and their fans), that the end result is absorbing and satisfying.

A light-hearted romance ""You Instead"" (US title ""Tonight You're Mine"") is most notable for the way it was made. The film was shot on location, at the real T in the Park Festival in 2010. The audiences and musicians are all real, and so are the muddy ground and a lit up Ferris wheel. Everything in the film including the professional actors looks authentic. And the filmmakers had to shoot everything in five days.

I know these things, but still I have to say this. For all the likable leads, energetic live performances, and the real sound and crowd that fill the screen, ""You Instead"" sometimes looks empty, with a thin story that is drawn out and diluted. Directed by David MacKenzie (""Yong Adam"" ""Perfect Sense""), the film certainly captures the atmosphere of the music festival, but not the romance it tries to follow.

It is a pity for the two leads so good, especially in the sequence where they perform a Soft Cell hit ""Tainted Love."" It's charming and fun. The film simply needs more of that.",1354752000,2,1523,4.675373134328358

5132696,4,B0085A9INM,"From the opening scenes you pretty much know where this non-traditional romantic comedy is going to go.  But then that's the case most of the time.  Originally released in Europe in 2011 as ""You Instead,"" it is set at the T in the Park music festival in Scotland.

A well-known rocker played by Luke Treadaway (""Attack the Block"") is half of a 2-man band known as ""The Make.""  He gets into a minor scuffle with the lead singer (Natalia Tena, ""Harry Potter"" films) of an all-girl band known as ""Dirty Pink.""  After a happy-go-lucky backstage preacher comically hand-cuffs them together, the fun begins.

Both Adam (Treadaway) and Morello (Tena) have romantic partners who are confused as to why the handcuffs can't be removed.  Me too, but the ""preacher"" has disappeared with the key and the cuffs are made of hardened steel.  There are no bolt cutters around and a hammer and screwdriver won't get it done.  With the couple's model girlfriend and banker boyfriend in tow most of the time, the film has plenty of funny moments.

One of the highlights involves ""Dirty Pink's"" concert performance.  Still cuffed, Adam sits next to Morello, who is the keyboard player.  The band is rocking to one of their songs, when Adam reaches over to play a couple iconic notes from ""Soft Cell's"" ""Tainted Love."" This eventually leads to a rousing mash-up of the two songs.  From there on, the couple's distaste for each other begins to change.

Granted some of the dialog in the film borders on amateurish, but that is also some of the charm.  Shot convincingly during the actual music festival, the film feels authentic.  The characters aren't always likeable, but they grow on you.  The movie is a brisk 80 minutes and a goodly chunk of it is actual music performances by the two bands and others.  Some of which I've actually heard of.  I'll be searching out the soundtrack which includes Gloria Jones original 1965 version of ""Tainted Love.""  It's all good.",1353974400,2,1946,4.769461077844311
