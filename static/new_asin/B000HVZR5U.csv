8141544,3,B000HVZR5U,"In the late-1970s, TV viewers met for the first time ad-man extraordinaire Ernest P. Worrell. With a rubbery face and goggle-eyes, Ernest stared into the camera and pitched soft drinks and a variety of other products while having a one-sided conversation with an unseen buddy named Vern.

In 30 seconds, Jim Varney's animatedly goofy Ernest would plug something, then end the spot with a killer sight gag. What nationwide viewers weren't aware of back then is revealed in this collection of Ernest's best commercials.

Besides selling consumables, the most industrious Mr. Varney cut countless plugs for local TV and radio stations, as well as some public service announcements. The GOODTIMES folks offer in their ERNEST GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2  a hour's worth of these, from Varney's considerable half-minute ad archives. Included are some rarities and funniest of all, outtakes and bloopers, often from ads seen here in their entirety.

The only limitation: GOODTIMES dubbed at LP speed, so there's some loss in video sharpness (but just a smidgen, Vern!).
