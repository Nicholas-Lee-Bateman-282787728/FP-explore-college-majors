8527753,5,B008GWWV56,"Hong Gil Dong is one of the most well written programs I have ever seen, even compared to American TV. The many nuances in relationships, the twists of fate and the entanglements of love, honor, loyalty, morality...I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it over and over, just to see if I'd missed anything. I love the blend of ancient and modern culture. The soundtrack is wonderful! Don't let the beginning fun anime-style movie fool you. This series matures into a notable work of literary genius!",1366070400,3,502,4.848837209302325
8527754,5,B008GWWV56,"I love Hong Gil Dong! This is a really fun ""fusion saguek."" For those of you who hate the word ""fusion"" used to describe anything, this is a historical drama with a modern twist (music, slang, attitude) mixed with some fantasy.

Kang Ji Hwan is wonderful as Hong Gil Dong, the reluctant and unwitting hero. He plays the tough but vulnerable character beautifully. His transformation (from selfish jerk to selfless hero) as the story unfolds is k-drama magic.

Sung Yuri is adorable as Heo Yinok. She's cute and quirky but more importantly, her sweet, innocent, steadfast love and devotion for Hong Gil Dong make him the man he's meant to be. I've seen her in other dramas but she really nails this character with an honesty that is charming and emotional.

It starts out with an over the top comic book style vibe that can be off putting but it levels out nicely into a historical drama/comedy that is full of interesting, likeable characters and beautifully absurd laugh out loud moments.

I give the drama 4 stars because I felt it deserved a better ending and it was unable to maintain the ""magic"" to the very end.

The box-set is great and I give that 5 stars. I was reluctant to purchase this drama from an unfamiliar Studio/Publisher/Distributor. I've been burned before by Chinese, Hong Kong and other asian companies putting out inferior product. I've been strictly YesAsia for a very long time but as their selection has dwindled and they've starting purchasing from Studios like POH KIM aka PK Entertainment, I've branched out cautiously.

The DVD's come nicely packaged in a box that has professional style artwork and snap in spots for the discs. Picture and Audio is very good. Subtitles are very good. A few typos and errors in grammar here and there but none of that frustrating gibberish that so many other lower quality asian imports produce.",1358726400,7,1859,4.79375
