8517737,3,B007ISJSKK,"I have been a big fan of Mill Creek for a number of years.  I bought this on a whim to see how the documentary part of Mill Creek was.  I found this set to be a grab-bag of pretty good to poorly done.  Having 13 documentaries about some real Life X-Files is  good and bad.
  Overall this was an ok buy.  Not bad but ok.  If anything I would recommend that unless your a die hard for this kind of documentary (Like I am) then get it. If your not, mmmmmm go buy another documentary set",1392940800,3,483,3.9072164948453607
8517738,1,B007ISJSKK,I bought this at walmart and feel ripped off. Cheap homemade video footage endless boring lectures. I can't believe anyone would pay to publish this.,1338076800,2,149,5.0
8517739,2,B007ISJSKK,"Unless you like horribly filmed lectures that are tedious and boring you will not like this documentary. The audio is terrible and the entire set seems like it was made in Windows Movie Maker, bought this at Walmart and was extremely disappointed. If I were you I would pass on this one",1336262400,6,286,4.519230769230769
