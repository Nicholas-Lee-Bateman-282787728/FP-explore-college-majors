2832729,2,B000Q66QEC,"When I first bought this DVD, I did not know what to expect.  I had read some favorable reviews of Philip Gardiner that prompted me to explore his work.  This DVD was a disappointment! There was a lot of non-sense music which had little if anything to do with the subjet matter.  Many assertions were made, but no justification or sources were cited.  The content had little point with the title.  In my opinion, if you are going to trash a worldwide accepted institution you need to be armed with the facts, and be able to communicate the sources.  He failed miserably in this respect.  There were pictures displayed that had nothing to do with the dialogue or were out of context.  This DVD was not very scholarly or professionally produced.  Wait until it goes on sale below $10...",1190764800,11,784,4.58273381294964
2832730,5,B000Q66QEC,"Yet again, Gardiner has brought a work of art to the world of documentaries and involves us in a sinister world of manipulation and propoganda. He sets about telling us why we join secret societies and then runs through their existence - revealing a unique central core that links them all together. Shocking, beautiful, incredibly thought provoking - Gardiner does it again in my humble opinion. Well worth the money.",1181952000,11,418,4.985714285714286
2832741,4,B000Q66QEC,"In ""Secret Societies and the Global Conspiracy"", the truths and fables of the world are explained--with theories offered toward a greater power found within.

From knights to demons, the film treats its viewers to a comprehensive (if not slightly exaggerated) examination of such groups as the Templars, the Freemasons and the Military Order of Malta. Their impact on society is undeniable, but their origins--and abilities--are often mistaken. The film seeks instead to dissect such fictions. And it succeeds. Mostly.

""Secret Society"" suffers from clumsy pacing. Minutes from each section lag. In an effort to create drama, too-long pauses and creaky soundtracks have been used; and, for this, the viewer will become frustrated. A less dramatic direction style would have served the stories better.

Still the value of the film is in its theories and, for those, viewers will stay.

Will ""Secret Societies and the Global Conspiracy"" convince its audience? That remains unseen. It will, however, entertain all.",1277164800,,1011,5.420382165605096
2832742,1,B000Q66QEC,"OMG, the worst ever!  I thought it would be like the documentaries usually shown on the History Channel.  There were no people, no interviews, no opposing views, no ""wow, I've never heard that!"" moments.  Gardiner never appears on camera, and I almost needed captioning to hear him over the constant blaring music.",1267660800,2,314,5.0
2832743,1,B000Q66QEC,this video is really confusing. i didn't understand much of what was being said and all pictures that keep coming on were distracting and confusing.  the video was not well put together.,1266451200,,186,4.8125
2832744,1,B000Q66QEC,"TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THIS DVD WAS MADE WITH A 19TH CENTURY ""MY FIRST VISUAL EDITING PROGRAM"". THE WORSE DOCUMENTARY I HAVE EVER WATCHED. NO PROOF TO BACK UP MUCH OF ANYTHING, MR GARDNER AND HIS COUNTERPARTS RANT ABOUT. BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.....",1235520000,2,252,4.622222222222222
2832745,4,B000Q66QEC,"Gardiner once again give a consistent, interesting, low key look into secret societies.  He has no fear and seems to love to delve into the secret lives and histories of powerful groups.  I found this DVD to be powerful, interesting and intelligent.  You don't have to agree with everything Gardiner says to find this DVD entertaining.",1206576000,3,335,4.946428571428571
2832746,4,B000Q66QEC,"If you are interested in Gardiner's other films on secret societies, codes, etc., this is a ""must see.""  In this piece, he focuses on uncovering the dicussions and major concerns of secret societies such as the Free Masons, Kights Templar, Serpent Cults, and the Illuminati (whom I find fascinating).  There are major links here that I never knew about.  Learn why so much of this information has remained hidden and how it can benefit us in contemporary society.",1206057600,4,463,4.910256410256411

2832748,3,B000Q66QEC,"An illuminating look into the complexities, differences, and amazingly enough--similarities, between many of the so-called `Secret Societies', both in the past and today.

Philip Gardiner explores many truths, untruths and rumors about these societies, as well as where they came from.  If you've ever wondered why these societies act as they do, and how they originally came to being, you've got to see this eye-opening movie.",1199836800,3,427,5.454545454545454
2832749,1,B000Q66QEC,"This DVD is probably the worst DVD I have ever purchased. It is so awful that it is difficult to know where to begin with reasons one should not waste precious time or equally precious money on this appalling piece of exceptionally poor video production. Perhaps that is where it will serve the greatest good, as an educational example of how NOT to make a video. Mr. Gardiner certainly has made a silly, foolish video disaster of what should otherwise be a fascinating subject. If there was some way to give a negative star rating, this would be the lowest standard possible. I wish that there was some way to obtain a refund.",1199145600,7,627,4.557522123893805
2832750,3,B000Q66QEC,"What is a ""secret society?"" Author and filmmaker Philip Gardiner uses a plethora of visual images and music to explore and explain the beginnings of secret societies. The rites and rituals performed and revered by such groups as Knights Templar, Nazis, Freemasons, and even one of the first secret societies, Christianity are looked at from a historical and contemporary perspective. Very interesting stuff!",1198627200,5,407,5.476190476190476
8194631,1,B000Q66QEC,"It's hard to know what's going on in this video. It speaks of secret societies in southern Italy and elsewhere, but it sounds as if it were written by a speaker of a language that doesn't always a definite article; it seems somewhat jilted(?) in spoken English, and would at best get a D if the script were a written middle school essay.

Between the foreign-sounding grammar and the thick UK accent, it's very difficult to understand. I'm not 100% certain that it wasn't fed into a modern text-to-speech engine, because someone who spoke English regularly would surely have objected to or been confused by the script.

There's no credits crawl, and Google can't resolve any entity known as QuantumTV, so it's difficult to know where this came from.",1490227200,,749,4.7984496124031
8194632,3,B000Q66QEC,"Do not judge Philip G.'s work from this less than ideal video presentation.  For those of you complaining about this video lacking in credible sourcing, you need to give his work a chance and read his actual books that are loaded with cited sources and an extensive bibliography.  I feel that this video does not do the author's work justice.  His serpent cult books are more ""put together"" so I advise any would be viewer to check them out first before passing judgement on the author.",1380326400,,486,4.627906976744186
8194633,1,B000Q66QEC,"I have watched a lot of free videos better than this one.  no new info, bad presentation, superficial info.  Could finish watching this one either.  Don't waste your money, will not learn anything.",1352937600,,197,4.909090909090909
8194634,1,B000Q66QEC,"if you have academic knowledge about socities the video is BS!!,the author does not cover / know reality, all existing cults, economics and acutal issues.
It is an individual's video, it a waste of time I will ask for refund.",1337126400,2,225,4.65
8194635,2,B000Q66QEC,"This was and I do not hesitate in saying the most boring ,uniformative film I ever wasted time (and I waste alot of time )on ,I wouldn't waste another nickel on this guys' movies",1334534400,2,178,4.264705882352941
8194636,1,B000Q66QEC,"IT'S BASICALLY THE AUTHOR READING FROM HIS BOOK WHILE PHOTOS, DIAGRAMS, IMAGES ARE FLASHED ON THE SCREEN.  VERY LITTLE ACTUAL LIVE VIDEO RECORDED FOOTAGE. YOU ARE BETTER OFF BUYING THE AUDIO CD OF THE BOOK WITH THE SAME NAME. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY FOR ME. SO DISSAPOINTED.",1326412800,,274,4.708333333333333
8194637,2,B000Q66QEC,"I was disappointed with the content. I have other related DVD's as well, but this is the first one in which I was getting bored and waited for the end. I also get the smell that Gardiner try to make the assumption that ""Christianity"" is also a secret society. Watching this one did not really broaden my knowledge.

The first one I got was completely faulty and Wholesale DVD America have send me another one free of charge. I wonder if the reproduction are really professional.",1308009600,,478,4.558139534883721
8194638,3,B000Q66QEC,"As someone who knew very little about secret societies, which I guess is a testament to their secretive status, I found this documentary to be quite an eye-opener. If you have ever remotely wondered about secret societies, their place in history, the men who belong to them and the things they do that prompt them to maintain their secrecy and mystery then you will definitely find this film educational. Conspiracy theorists as well will revel in Gardiner's insightful view into the world of secret societies.",1294272000,,510,5.011764705882353
8194639,3,B000Q66QEC,"You always hear about ""secret societies"" and probably wonder what goes on behind closed doors.  Is it strange rituals so odd that they must be hidden from the rest of the world, or simply exlusive ""clubs"" intended only for a chosen few?  This one hour DVD by Philip Gardiner packs in a lot of information about secret societies and their history.  It's like having a backstage pass to witness the goings on of the Freemasons and Illuminati.  If you're thinking ""The Da Vinci Code"" then think again.  Even those who think they may know a lot about these groups will be surprised at the evidence and information presented in this film.  Even if you don't agree with everything Mr. Gardiner reveals, it's certainly interesting and he leaves no stone unturned.",1287878400,,756,4.776923076923077
8194640,1,B000Q66QEC,"This is one of the poorest produced documentaries I have ever seen.  Better videos being done by 13 year old children on YouTube.  Music irritating, no real documentary footage.  Just dialogue, repeating bad images, and terrible music.",1285372800,,235,5.297297297297297
