Unfortunately it is so badly out of date that I simply cannot, in all good conscience, give it the high rating that I would like to.

The information that Mr. Myers provides is still valid. But, you really have to dig for it. The programs that he uses to demonstrate his suggestions are very gray haired indeed. The world, and the interface for Camtasia, has changed greatly since this video was made. He is stuck on version 4 of Camtasia. I'm on version 7.

I don't use the same video editing program that he does (Sony Vegas Studio) so I can't comment on the differences and difficulties there. However, his copy is version 6. Currently Vegas Studio is at version 9, and Vegas Pro is at version 10.

Both of his demo programs were, presumably, hot off the press when he made this video a few years back. They are so old now that they really cause major difficulties for the person who is trying to make the adjustments that his technique requires.

I emailed him regarding the problem with a suggestion that he really needed to update the program. I told him I would wait a week for his reply before I posted my review. It's been more than three weeks and I have not heard from him.

I said I wanted to be able to give a good review and I meant it. When all is said and done, what I got out of the program was indeed very helpful. I'm sure my DVD's look much better than they would have without his input. But, the frustration of having to sort everything out because of his out of date programs took the pleasure out of the experience. It was kind of like getting healthier because someone forced castor oil down your throat.

Come on Bill; you can do better than that.",1306454400,,1732,4.310769230769231
8215705,5,B000UYIF5S,"This DVD really did start at the beginning and went all the way to putting the finished, professional looking, product on a DVD.

There were a lot of little details shown that made a big difference when it came to producing a professional looking final DVD product.

No one should try to use Camtasia to create a DVD without first owning this powerful training DVD. A short time spent watching this DVD will save you hours of trial and error or time searching the manual.

A lot of techniques covered in this DVD I don't think are in the manual -- at least, I never found them.

8215706,5,B000UYIF5S,"$39 seemed a bit steep for a DVD, but the techniques worked great and got me out of a tight production spot.  Considering I spent an entire day trying to find the correct techniques on my own (with little success), I guess the price is well worth it.",1207440000,,250,4.208333333333333
