1978897,4,B00018WMSE,If you love steam trains you will probably want this. U.K. steam trains are a delight and theBrtits know how to run steam events very well. The only problem is the picture quality which has an odd stuttering video quality as if the train was moving then stopped ever so briefly then moving again etc. Depending on your sensibilities you might find the problem trivial or most annoying.,1369094400,,385,4.676470588235294
1978898,3,B00018WMSE,I could care less for this....but my 2 year old son loves the trains on it.  If you have a child that loves trains.....that's basically what this is just train after train.  It's not that interesting.....,1363219200,,204,4.638888888888889

1978900,3,B00018WMSE,"I guess this was worth $2 to rent for a week.  My little guy loves steam trains and wanted to watch some, so here we go, but boy was the narration boring!!  Excellent footage of some very neat old trains though, he did enjoy watching them.",1351123200,,239,4.173913043478261
1978901,5,B00018WMSE,"ANYTHING about railroads is good! Just a picture of a steam locomotive gets ones juices rolling! This set of films is great. They feature a world that is gone, but it was real and beautiful and wonderful. Long live the railroad!",1313712000,,228,4.585365853658536

1978903,5,B00018WMSE,"If you love steam trains, this is a must.  One of the best bargains I've ever purchased.  Most of it is excursions, but don't let that stop you.  It seems to cover about every steam excursion in the U.S. during the 90's, and there were plenty.  Plus some footage from the old days.  Better to watch from the outside, as with a DVD, than being on the train.  You see more.  Photography and sound amazing, and knowledgeable commentary interesting.  Thank you, producers.",1170374400,6,468,4.621951219512195

This was originally created by Railfan Magazine and Mark I video.  They use old photos, narration and current video to document steam train events.  There is a wealth of information in this set.  If you are a train afficianado, this is for you.",1085616000,5,766,4.9609375
1978952,3,B00018WMSE,So my child is autistic and absolutely LOVES trains.  The video is informative enough to keep him glued to the couch.  Not bad for parents to watch either.,1416960000,,155,4.5

1978954,3,B00018WMSE,While watching steam trains move is interesting it would have been more useful for some detailed looks inside the cabs and cars and more info on the type of train.,1404000000,,163,4.466666666666667
1978955,4,B00018WMSE,What I dislike about this set may not bother other viewers. It is almost exclusively long distance shots of passing trains with very little commentary.,1399852800,,151,5.08
1978956,4,B00018WMSE,Colorful and clear picture. A good way to see up close train operations and view some scenery in Great Britain.,1390867200,,111,4.6
1978957,5,B00018WMSE,"My 3 year old loves to sit and watch the real-life trains drive around everywhere.  Even though there's no plot, no animation, no characters he is fascinated and I like that it's not a cartoon.",1388707200,,193,4.514285714285714

1978959,3,B00018WMSE,"Interesting Video, with some redundancy. Shows That GB is more interested in Preservation than the US. Many different types of Steam.",1383091200,,133,5.380952380952381
1978960,4,B00018WMSE,"Beautiful images and videos of steam trains. Informative at a high level about steam trains. However, there is no action, drama, and it is narrated in Monotone :-( Mostly purely a documentary",1382140800,,191,5.0
1978961,5,B00018WMSE,Anyone who loves anything to do with trains should watch this series.  It is very informative and the locales are most enjoyable.,1377734400,,129,4.863636363636363

8008173,4,B00018WMSE,"My 2 year old loves trains. Especially steam trains. After forking out $14 for a very, very low quality puppet & Amtrak video, I wish I had looked harder without the toddler looking over my shoulder (never a good idea anyway...).

I gotta say, part of the draw of this particular movie/documentary/film is that everything resembles Thomas & Friends. As a mom who watches far too much Thomas, and spends too much time overanalyzing the movies & episodes (because that's what you find yourself doing when you watch the engine drivers let the trains do whatever they want), I couldn't help but find Gordon, Percy, Luke, Thomas, Knapford & more.

It's not amazing. But it's not awful. It's a welcome addition to our rotation.",1435104000,2,721,4.806451612903226
8008174,3,B00018WMSE,"I cannot in good faith say I watch this. We put this on when my two year old wants to watch ""old trains"" and ""mochalotions"" (locomotives)  He loves it.",1426723200,,151,4.206896551724138

8008176,5,B00018WMSE,"It's not so much that I love it, trains aren't really my thing, BUT my 2 year old grandson is fascinated. I swear, we have watched this video 1,000 times, sometimes 2 or more in a day! This is not really a children's video. It is more a documentary, but he just eats it up. He can identify all the types of engines too. Two big thumbs up from ""Nanna Jo""",1418169600,,353,3.9859154929577465
