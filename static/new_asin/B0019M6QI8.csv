This film that can be viewed on any DVD player is really designed for a computer to be able to retrieve items like the timeline below.

Seeing the term classical, you would expect Greek or Egyptian concepts of physics or maybe even earth wind and fire. However, you will be disappointed as it is only the nineteenth century.

Core Physics: Classical Physics Timeline
1589 - 1899
1589 - Pisa University mathematics instructor Galileo Galilei studies the motion of objects and begins to write his unfinished book - On Motion
1602 - Galileo observes that the period of a swinging pendulum is independent of the amplitude of the swinging pendulum
1609 - Galileo makes his first telescope
1632 - Galileo publishes Dialogue concerning the two greatest world systems, which argues convincingly for the Copernican view that the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun
1665 - Isaac Newton begins study of calculus
1684 - Leibniz publishes the beginning of his work on differential and integral calculus.
1687 - Newton publishes Principia Mechanica
1738 - Daniel Bernoulli writes Hydrodynamics
1770 - Hyperbolic trigonometry is developed
1772 - Henry Cavendish discovers that the electrostatic force is described by an inverse square law similar to gravity
1789 - Charles-Augustin de Coulomb recreates Cavendish's experiment
1799 - Pierre-Simon Laplace publishes Treatise on Celestial Mechanics
1807 - Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier writes On the Propagation of Heat in Solid Bodie.
1820 - Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted shows that an electric current in a wire can move the magnetic needle of a compass, suggesting electricity and magnetism are related
1826 - Andre Marie Ampere develops Ampere's Law, showing the magnetic force between two parallel wires with electric current
1827 - Frederich Ohm publishes Ohm's Law of electrical resistance
1831 - Michael Faraday discovers magnetic induction, now known as Faraday's Law
1842 - Austrian mathematician and physicist Christian Doppler publishes his work on the Doppler Effect
1873 - James Clerk Maxwell publishes a set of equations from which all of the observed laws of electromagnetism can be derived through mathematics
1884 - Heinrich Hertz creates the first radio waves
1884 - Ludwig Boltzmann makes a theoretical derivation of black body radiation using
Maxwell's equations and thermodynamics
1895 - Wilhelm Rontgen discovers X-rays and gamma radiation
1897 - Electron discovered by J.J. Thompson

A modern physics overview quickie

This film that can be viewed on any DVD player is really designed for a computer to be able to retrieve items like the timeline below.

It is a cursive overview and even the most non-physics mind like those that read Gary Zukav can get an insight as to what physics really is and where we stand today (2007) that is. Math is very little to nil. Playtime about 30 minutes.

This is still a good addition to your library.

Core Physics: Modern Physics Timeline
1900 - Present
1901 - Max Planck makes his quantum hypothesis, called Planck's Law - energy is carried by indistinguishable units called quanta, rather than flowing in a pure continuum
1905 - Albert Einstein proposes Planck's quantum hypothesis as the physics underlying the photoelectric effect, developing quantum theory, one of the two most important developments in 20th century physics
1905 - Einstein publishes his Special Theory of Relativity
1915 - Emmy Noether publishes Noether's Theorem, discovering the relationship between symmetries and conserved currents that will later be crucial to the development of quantum gauge field theory and string theory
1915 - Einstein publishes his General Theory of Relativity
1924 - Louis duc de Broglie proposes the particle-wave duality of the electron in his doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne
1926 - Erwin Schrodinger develops his wave equation version of quantum mechanics
1927 - Werner Heisenberg discovers the Uncertainty Principle
1928 - Paul Dirac predicts the discovery of the positron
1929 - Edwin Hubble observes the redshift of distant galaxies and concludes that the
Universe is expanding
1931 - Einstein stops using the cosmological constant to keep the Universe from expanding.
1933 - Astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky infers existence of dark matter
1935 - Physicist Subramahnyan Chandrasekhar predicts black holes
1953 - Murray Gell-Mann lays foundation for the quark
1964 - Cambridge mathematician Roger Penrose proves that a black hole space/time must contain behind the black hole event horizon a singularity where space/time physics ceases to make good sense
1964 - Murray Gell-Mann proposes fundamental particles that Gell-Mann names ""quarks""
1968 - Gabriele Veneziano founds modern string theory
1970 - Yoichiro Nambu, Leonard Susskind, and Holger Nielsen independently discover that the dual resonance model devised by Veneziano is based on the quantum mechanics of relativistic vibrating strings, and string theory begins
1973 - Predictions of Great Attractor are made
1974 - Stephen Hawking combines quantum field theory with classical general relativity and predicts that black holes radiate through particle emission
1974 - Joel Scherk and John Schwarz propose string theory as a theory of quantum gravity, an idea that takes ten years to be widely appreciated
1975 - Vera Rubin announces the existence of dark matter
1980 - Alan Guth puts forward the idea of an inflationary phase of the early Universe, before the Big Bang
1981 - Michael Green and John Schwarz develop superstring theory
1986 - Location of Great Attractor is found
2006 - Dark matter observed separate from ordinary matter",1353542400,,5644,5.333707865168539
