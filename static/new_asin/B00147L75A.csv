8254648,5,B00147L75A,"Finally a learning series that actually uses the accent of Cariocas! These videos contain very practical conversations that will be useful for someone traveling. I like the fact that they speak everyday language and are not overly formal like many other learning tools. Besides the main speakers in the video, they throw in a lot of repetition of words and phrases by a wide variety of speakers. I think this is so helpful and gives you a good idea of what native speakers actually sound like, with and without the accent of Cariocas.
They break everything down and also conjugate the main verbs for each section. There are also sections on vocabulary, verbs, telling time and the alphabet.",1393459200,,690,4.8559322033898304
8254649,5,B00147L75A,Perfect compliment to my books I am studying and the audio I listen too.  This is a product that finally puts it all together for me.  Inexpensive and really works.  The videos are informative and entertaining.  My confidence in speaking what little I know so far has greatly increased since I have purchased this program.  Trying to find a second edition.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Please make more in this series.,1342051200,3,416,4.857142857142857
8254650,3,B00147L75A,"Paul is obviously a native speaker of Portuguese. He's not an American - he's obviously a Brazilian trying to speak broken Portuguese. The few times he speaks English, it's hysterically funny because he has a foreign accent. For example, listen for when he says ""Sorry"". Too funny. That being said, this is a great program for learning Brazilian Portuguese. For those familiar with the Spanish language program ""Destinos"", this is the closest thing you get to the ""telenovela"" approach to language instruction.

This works. The lessons are well structured and there's a lot of appropriate repetition. However, Paul's fake American shtick can get annoying with both the fake accent and the bumbling idiot nonsense. I don't think an English language program for Brazilians with a fake Brazilian character being played by an American speaking fake broken English and playing a Brazilian stereotype would work without offending and annoying Brazilians. This is a really good program so just put aside the anti-American nonsense and try to learn the language.",1327622400,,1054,5.273809523809524
8254651,5,B00147L75A,"I've been working in Brasil for 3 months now & have been listening to Pimsleur's Phase 1 & 2 audio courses (very good.)
I've also been using the book ""Portuguese in 10 Minutes a Day (also very good.)

The videos in this package are a fantastic adjunct to the materials I've been using.

I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to learn Brasilian Portuguese!",1323648000,3,361,4.538461538461538
8254652,5,B00147L75A,"This is a fun and entertaining ""telenovela"" that teaches Portuguese. I really enjoyed watching the saga of Paul as he discovered Rio and the Brazilian culture. The pace is slow and easy, introducing new words and helping you become conversational in Portuguese. Lots of fun!
The podcasts are also a great way to watch the series, available from [..]

8254653,4,B00147L75A,"After going through 5 courses in Brazilian Portuguese: Portuguese in 10 minutes a day, Pimsleur, Rosetta Stone, Manuela Cook and this, I consider this a fine addition to the long slog to acquire the language. It is well produced and entertaining. However, if you are short of cash and a complete beginner, I'd go for Portuguese in 10 minutes a day. It is a lot cheaper and also fun. The Semantica course is expensive on Amazon and can be bought from the Semantica website for $50 less (if you have a Paypal account or your visa card is verified by Paypal. I have a Paypal account but security on that system is so tight, it shuts me out of my own account. That's why I bought from Amazon at the much higher price.)

I still consider the Pimsleur 90-lesson Portuguese course to be the best. I would still recommend that over the Semantica or any other course mentioned above. Pimsleur, however, is very expensive.",1265155200,9,912,4.560975609756097

But this material is a very good for English native speaker
and nonnative speaker too.
It's fanyastic!",1250035200,,167,5.222222222222222
8254655,5,B00147L75A,At last this is the best!!I tried Rosetta but had to returned it because it was boring and to slow moving. I'm also a big fan of Pimsleur but too bad it's only audio. Semantica is entertaining and easy to follow. You don't lose focus because it's like watching a movie broken down into small clips. They teach you real life scenarios as opposed to learning phrases here and there that have no use in real life. I just wish they would hurry up and come out with more.,1212537600,12,466,4.247191011235955
8254656,5,B00147L75A,"Muito bom!!!
I gave this to my kids to watch before traveling to Brazil and they loved it. I myself speak pretty decent Portuguese, yet still picked up a lot of new phrases from the more advanced chapters. Great product.",1206662400,5,220,4.525
