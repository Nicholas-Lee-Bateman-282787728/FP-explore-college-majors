7953967,5,B00005TT72,"""I Created Lancelot Link"" is a great 16 minute documentary which intersperses some of the best scenes of the 1970-72 TV show with a humorous interview with the show's creators, Stan Burns and the late Mike Marmer.
The uniqueness of the show was that it used chimpanzees as actors who lip synched to human voices.  It was a chimp spoof of Get Smart and was brilliant.  This documentary captures some of the creativity that went into the show as the 2 creators discuss it.  They even show the ""Evolution Revolution"", the ""greatest band in the world"", whose band members were chimps.
I remember this show as a 6-year-old in 1970, and this film is essential for all afficionados of late '60s/early '70s pop culture.",1041984000,4,711,4.717741935483871
