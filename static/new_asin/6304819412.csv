932888,5,6304819412,Thank you for the timely delivery. It is a very good print of an old serial and exact as advertised.,1220745600,2,100,4.05
932889,5,6304819412,"I suspect that the title of this production, ""The New Adventures of Tarzan,"" has been confusing to some folks since it was only ""new"" in 1935 when Edgar Rice Burroughs himself produced it!

What we have here is an old ""cliffhanger"" of twelve episodes which were originally shown at theaters, one week at a time, to run alongside main feature films. The idea was to keep you ""hanging"" so you'd come back the next week to see what happened -- someone was always about to be heinously knocked off at the end of each episode, (except for in the last one).

The story is this: Tarzan and his companions, headed by Major Martling, go head-to-head in the Guatemalan jungle against the nefarious P.B. Raglan in an effort to secure ""The Green Goddess,"" a priceless ancient artifact which also contains the formula for a super-explosive. Of course, the Green Goddess is in the hands of first one and then another of the two factions and it becomes clear that only Tarzan can finalize its possession for the good guys. There is also a sub-plot of Tarzan  going to the region for the priority purpose of rescuing his old friend, d'Arnot.

This film was actually shot on location, for the most part, in Guatemala where the action is supposed to have taken place so that is a big plus of this film. Herman Brix, a 1928 Olympic shot-putter, plays Tarzan but he later changed his name to Bruce Bennett and went on play roles in films like ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948) and, ""Sahara"" (1943). His ""Tarzan yell"" sounds a great deal like Minnie Pearl's ""How-deeee!!!"" but, other than that, he makes for a pretty believable jungle hero.

The episodes of the serial are entitled:

1. New Adventures
2. Crossed Trails
3. Devil's Noose
4. River Perils
5. Unseen Hands
6. Fatal Fangs
7. Flaming Waters
8. Angry Gods
9. Doom's Brink
10. Secret Signals
11. Death's Fireworks
12. Operator No. 17

This particular print has been digitally re-mastered and marketed by the Columbia River Film Group. Of course, the film is shot in black and white, full-screen, and runs for a total of FOUR HOURS! It's all on a single DVD and, having owned this serial issued by a couple of different distributors, this particular one is as good as it gets, a fairly clear print with decent sound. The film is in the public domain so it can be copied and sold by anyone and inferior copies abound.

This serial was later heavily edited to produce the film, ""Tarzan and the Green Goddess"" (1938), which only runs for a total of 90 minutes. The serial version is by far the superior choice of the two productions if you are really into the older black and white adventure films.

Highly recommended to appropriate audiences.",1214092800,20,2682,4.641350210970464
932890,1,6304819412,This is the worst Tarsan movie I've ever seen.  The Tarzan yell sounds more like a hog calling contest.  The acting isn't just bad it's totally rotten.  Tarzan attacks no less than three and more than six men at a time by himself which is a bit farfetched.  This is truly and injustice to the writer of the tarzan stories,1177113600,2,321,4.3
932891,2,6304819412,"I almost gave up on this after one chapter--the acting was pretty poor and the directing was bad.  But I read enough about it on the internet that it renewed my interest, and found it worth watching after all.  (Just barely.)  In addition to the bad acting, the cliffhangers are full of cheats.

Serial producers apparently loved to take former Olympics athletes and try to take advantage of their fame, and Herman Brix was no exception.  He had been the number two choice behind Johnny Weissmuller for the MGM Tarzan pictures.  Brix won the silver medal in the shot put in the 1928 Olympics, and had been a football and track star at the University of Washington.

Apparently Edgar Rice Burroughs wasn't terribly pleased with the way his creation was handled at MGM, so he formed a production company with Ashton Dearholt for this serial.  It was shot on location in Guatemala where they ran into all sorts of problems including storms, accidents, diseases, and rugged remote locations.  As if that weren't enough, during filming Dearholt married leading lady Ula Holt, and Burroughs divorced his first wife to marry Dearholt's ex, Florence.  Dearholt also played the villain Raglan, thought he was billed as Don Castello.

Herman Brix did his own stunts in this picture, resulting in multiple injuries, tropical fever, and chronic exhaustion.  Still, he does a pretty good job; he's the best actor in the picture, although that's not saying much.  Brix also co-starred in one of the all-time best serials, ""Daredevils of the Red Circle,"" as well as ""Hawk of the Wilderness.""  Later he took a few years off from pictures, took acting lessons, and reinvented himself as Bruce Bennett at Warner Brothers, where he made many feature films.",1136678400,3,1737,4.9243986254295535
932892,2,6304819412,"I bought both the MADACY and ROAN GROUP versions to compare, and couldn't see much difference, in fact the ROAN GROUP version had extras that had no connection, that I could figure out, with Tarzan at all, and billed an item that I couldn't even find on the disc!

See my review in the ROAN GROUP dvd site.",1117065600,5,306,4.275862068965517
932893,2,6304819412,"I recently bought the MADACY DVD version of NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN and agreed with reviews that considered the general quality as pretty rough. On customer recomendation I then purchased the ROAN GROUP version, as this was billed as 'digitally remastered from the finest elements', and presumably of better quality. In the light of these recommendations I have the following comments to make about the ROAN GROUP version;
1) Picture and sound quality not much improved from MANDACY version.
2) Extras featured; Doggie tails trailer--Toxic crusaders cartoon--Radiation march
-----What connection do these features have with Tarzan?
3) Plastered across the front of the box poster--

932894,1,6304819412,"If a studio is going to put out old movies, they should really take the time to remaster the movies. In this case they did not. the sound is almost none existent and the picture is so dark and bright you can hardly watch it. Madacy Studios is not a company to buy movies from. not waste your money and time on this dvd. it is not worth it. there is however another copy from Roan Studios. they know how to present and presever movies.",1105747200,7,434,4.117647058823529
932895,3,6304819412,"I agree that the transfer to DVD could have been better. But the truth is, this is a good Tarzan story. Tarzan is intelligent and acutally dressed in clothing when hanging out with people. He only goes loin cloth when in the Jungle. That is how Burroughs wrote the charater in most of his novels. Also Burroughs hand picked Herman Brix to play Tarzan makes so this movie something closer to what the author had in mind.",1103500800,3,419,4.454545454545454
932896,1,6304819412,"This rare serial and important addition to the Tarzan canon is totally ruined by the awful treatment giving to it in this DVD set.
The picture quality is fair at best with most of it too dark or either too washed out. The sound is so bad that it's almost impossible to understand 90% of the dialogue through the loud sea of hiss.
Save your money, this is a total rip-off.",1075593600,38,371,4.23943661971831
932897,2,6304819412,"This serial is one of the few in which Tarzan talks like a real person. The chapters are longer than most of the serials I have seen. It's good fun for hardcore Tarzan fans. The only trouble I have with this serial, Is that chapter 4 is only 1/2 there, And chapters 5 and 6 are not anywhere on the tapes.",994896000,,304,4.0

7878027,3,6304819412,"Certainly not the best ""digitally remastered"" serial I have ever seen.  Video and audio are poor in quality throughout the serial.  Having said that the video portion is watchable, and does not bounce around.  I suggest wearing a quality headphone for audio clarity.  I enjoyed watching the serial itself, as Herman Brix plays a great Tarzan.  5 stars for the serial content.  Minus 2 stars for audio/video quality.",1294531200,,415,5.029411764705882
7878028,5,6304819412,"First of all, let me say that I love all the movie Tarzans from Elmo Lincoln up to Gordon Scott. 1932's TARZAN THE APEMAN with the great Johnny Weismuller is one of my favorite classic films. THE NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN is pretty good too, for reasons of its own. This twelve part serial, released in 1936 by the Ashton Dearholt Expedition, came into being largely because author Edgar Rice Burroughs was unhappy with how movies depicted his fictional jungle man. Burroughs formed a partnership with independent producer Lee Ashton Dearholt, and the film unit embarked on an expedition to Guatemala to produce the serial.

The plot concerns Tarzan's attempts to rescue his best friend who is being held by a tribe of savages, and to recover a mysterious, ancient idol worshiped by them that was stolen by a mercenary. Besides being covered with precious jewels, the idol also contains a formula for a powerful explosive.

Olympics decathlon champion Herman Brix (later known as Bruce Bennett) was chosen for Tarzan, and he does an excellent job of portraying the character Burroughs originally envisioned as the articulate, English heir/ape-man Lord Greystoke. Brix cuts an impressive figure with a genuinely athletic physique and handles himself very well in the action sequences. The supporting players are good, especially pretty Ula Holt as Tarzan's girl, Frank Baker as an archaeologist, and producer Ashton Dearholt himself as the villain. Don Castello was initially cast in the role, but when the actor became ill Dearholt replaced him without screen credit. The serial's only liability is the very lame comic relief by Lew Sargent as a character who is constantly thinking of food. Each chapter opens with Brix giving us his jungle cry which, while totally unlike the famous Johnny Weismuller version, is probably more like the wild, less fanciful yell described in Burroughs' novels.

Directed by Edward Kull, THE NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN is greatly aided by the ambitious (by serial standards) location cinematography in Guatemala City, Antigua, the Mayan ruins in Tikal, and along the Rio Dulce River. Some exciting wild animal scenes were shot at the Selig Zoo in Los Angeles. The photogenic locations and rough looking animal fights give the serial a pleasing, raw realism that is in many cases lacking in the more polished MGM Tarzan films of the period. On the other hand, there were also dangers and difficulties with the location shoot, which involved lugging heavy camera and sound equipment over mountains and through insect infested jungles. The often inclement weather added further complications that caused lengthy delays in the production. At times, shooting in the tropics even compromised the quality of the soundtrack.

THE NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN was trimmed and compiled as a feature version called TARZAN AND THE GREEN GODDESS, released in 1938.

There are several versions of this serial available, but the best one so far is from the Roan Group, with consistently sharp, clear image quality. Any slight imperfections in the soundtrack were apparently in the original recording. However, it's not to the point of detracting from our enjoyment of the film.

THE NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN is an absolute must have for serial fans and anyone who is into the classic era Tarzan movies because of its faithfulness to Burroughs' creation and for its realistic atmosphere. And while we're on the subject of Tarzan serials, definitely check out THE ADVENTURES OF TARZAN (1921) with Elmo Lincoln, and the outstanding TARZAN THE TIGER (1929), which was produced silent with  synchronized music and sound effects, and features Lincoln's stunt double Frank Merrill and Natalie Kingston as a very nice Jane.",1294012800,6,3726,5.158940397350993
7878029,5,6304819412,I have been looking for this serial for a long time. It was just as good as I remembered it and arrived well before the due date.,1270857600,,129,3.814814814814815
7878030,5,6304819412,i'm a tarzan fan that's why i bought this movie to go with my other tarazn movies.,1243900800,,82,3.8823529411764706
7878031,5,6304819412,"I have read all of the Burroughs Tarzan books. As much as I've enjoyed the various film incarnations of the character from the '40's through the '60's, none of them were as close to the character as written as is Herman Brix in this serial. Brix was chosen by Tarzan's creator ERB himself. The film was produced under ERB, Inc auspices. As such, this 1935 serial closely conforms to the novels in structure: back and forth between competing expeditions at cross purposes, a lost city, death traps, coincidences, and a hurricane at sea.
  I have sought out THE NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN for many years. I viewed it first as a 2 cassette VHS set. I graduated to the 2003 2-disk DVD from Best of Cliff Hanger Serials then to the 1-disk 2005 edition from Alpha Home Entertainment. Each time I was disappointed in the muddiness or flaring of the prints. When I saw that the Pop Flix Family edition was ""Digitally Re-mastered/Sound Enhanced"" for such a reasonable price, I could not resist buying yet another release of this serial classic. This is the best rendition of this film that I've seen to date.
  CAVEAT: Although this print has been re-mastered, it is not fully restored. There are still scratches, less than a minute that repeats itself in Chapter 3, and some clipped sound towards the end. However this is the first print consistently viewable throughout so that one can actually focus on the story.
  A ragged French aviator comes to Africa to find Tarzan. He was on a flight with Tarzan's great friend D'arnot in Guatemala when their plane goes down in a storm. The aviator parachutes only to watch D'arnot ride the plane down only to be captured by strange savages. The aviator goes into the jungle with George [a flunky comic relief - Lewis Sterling] in search of Tarzan.
The aviator is mauled by a lion which is then killed by Tarzan. The aviator dies in Tarzan's arms, but not before he tells Tarzan of D'arnot's plight.
  Tarzan joins the Martling Expedition already headed for Guatemala in search of the lost city. Martling [Frank Baker] has a notebook containing both directions to the city and instructions on opening a goddess statue full of jewels and the formula for a great explosive [?]. Countering the Martling Expedition is Raglin [Don Castello], an adventurer in the pay of foreign powers, out to steal the goddess for his masters. Also against Raglin is the mysterious Ula Vale [Ula Holt] who eventually joins with Tarzan and Maitling. . [Ula Holt looks very much like a heroine from a J. Allen St. John illustration from the Tarzan novels especially when racing to save Tarzan from the alligators while he's dazed from falling over a huge waterfall.]
  There are ambushes at sea both going to and leaving from Guatemala. There are death traps going to and escaping from the lost city. While trekking across Guatemala Raglin carries the heavy goddess. He can't open it without the book. He never has both the goddess and the book at the same time. Tarzan is thought dead several times. He battles multiple foes [up to hundreds in the lost city] with apparent ease. He never stops or considers his own life over others. He is equally at ease in town or on ship as he is in the jungle. This is true to the Tarzan on the page.
  Considering the hardships of shooting with sound on location in the jungle, it is remarkable how well this serial matches the spirit of the novels.
  MINOR GRIPES: The comic relief is a tat too feckless. N'kima is a chimp rather than a monkey [but the traditional cinema sidekick]. The queen of the lost city is the frumpiest I've ever seen. The young love interest [Martling's daughter & her fianc] leaves as soon as they can since they have little to do other than to be put into peril. How did an African lion end up in a lost city in Guatemala? The last chapter ends too abruptly as if the serial were originally planned for 15 chapters and cut to 12 due to funding. But on the whole, THE NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN should please both devotees of the original novels as well as fans of b&w serials of the mid 20th century.
  This version is from 2006. There is a 4-disk version from 2007 also offered from Amazon in the $20 rather than $6 range. There have been no reviews as to its content; but unless it is a pristine print with lots of bonus features, I would say that this 1-disk 2006 edition is the version for the curious to buy. As flawed as it may be, THE NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN is a must for the collection of any Edgar Rice Burroughs TARZAN aficionado.",1230422400,9,4517,4.564894932014833
