880091,4,6304463669,"In volume #4 of The Abbott & Costello Show where Bud and Lou are down and out actors who live at the Fields Rooming House located at 214 Brookline Avenue along with their beautiful neighbor Hillary Brooke and are always joined with their regular cast of charactors, Mike the cop, Mr. Bacciagalupe, Mr. Fields and Stinky (Joe Besser of The Three Stooges)find themselves again in more very funny situations.
(The Drugstore) starts the show with the boys on stage doing the Jonah and the whale routine and then begins showing them taking a job at Mr Fields brothers drugstore. Lou is driven crazy by kids and turns ill by Stinky and then starts a crazy ice cream fight. (Square Meal) The boys travel to Mr Bacciagalupe's lunch counter where Lou's allergy to meatballs turns the owner completly into a basketcase and then find themselves in a cafeteria where there is a case of mistaken identity with two waitresse. The oyster stew is pure classic! ($1000 Prize) is my personal favorite on this volume where Bud and Lou go to Mr Fields apartment to fix his tv set and wind up answering his phone when he's away and winning the big prize, but only if they can get rid of Mr Fields when the prize is delivered. They also have to contend with ducking Mike the cop! (Wife Wanted) begins with Bud and Mr Fields taking advantage of poor Lou in a poker game but Lou's fate has a turnaround for the better when he will inherit $10,000 if he can find a wife to marry before his rich grandfather visits. Lou's old girlfriend Agnes may be the answer, but what about her jealous wrestler boyfriend?
Why 4 stars and not 5 stars? Because just like the Abbott & Costello fan club says... That's not even the best ones! It's great to see the Abbott & Costello Show going to DVD. I hope all (13) volumes will be released soon! Than maybe the cartoon series which features Bud Abbotts voice.",1023753600,16,1869,4.51622418879056
880092,4,6304463669,"If you enjoy the comedy of A & C and are disappointed by their feature films, you'll want to own collections such as Volume 6. The VHS series is ofcourse drawn from the '52 to '53 sitcom and includes the boys at their absolute best. It's well-known that the ""Seinfeld"" series in its early years used alot of the show's style - from the man on the street tirade to the audience ""laugh track"", etc.
It has been written that show was conceived by Lou Costello as means to gain Copyright to the old routines. He even enlisted a relative, Pat Costello, to act as Producer, presumeably in name only. The result was one year of free-wheeling brilliance and another, final, year of labored, unfunny material that almost any team could have pulled off. Superlative support (in the first year's entry) came from Hillary Brooke, Sidney Fields, and Joe Besser, to name a few.
A series drawback in this volume and others, is that the original air-dates are not listed, so a fan has to research the titles if he/she wants to be assured of first-class stuff from the first season.
Happily, Vol. 6 contains *three* episodes from that first season - ""Television"", ""The Haunted House"", and ""The Vacation"". ""South of Dixie"" is from '52/3.",1005350400,5,1219,4.674418604651163

880263,2,6304463669,"Previously I bought the complete TV series available through Passport Video.  The quality on that series was pretty good except for some washed-out highlights.  Someone recommended this newer Entertainment 1 set as an improvement.  The picture quality is, indeed, a marginal improvement.  However, the sound is not in sync with the picture.  Most disturbing was The Haunted House, where the sound is almost a second late.  This complete destroys much of Costello's absolutely exquisite timing in his reactions.  You still get the ""big picture""; that is, that he reacts funny.  But the perfection of his timing is a whole second off, so it's pretty frustrating to watch for those of us who relish the details of pantomimic technique performed by the classic comedians.  Your kids will love this set, and most of you won't even notice the problem with the sound, so for most of you, I'd say go ahead and buy it.

880265,5,6304463669,"For classic TV comedy, fresh off the vaudeville stage, there was nothing better than Abbott&Costello.
Their classic comedy team dominated the 1940-50's era.  They were most famous for their 'who's on first' baseball parody bit as well as their series of films, most of which spoofed horror films of the day.  Nonetheless, their short lived TV series was arguably their best work.  They organized a small troupe of actors, includng the beautiful Hillary, the dour landlord Mr. Fields, the fruit vendor (Mr. Bothculoop) and Mike the cop.  Mr. Fields was an inside joke, as the same actor would fill in as a lawyer and a 100 other roles.
The overall theme was of a couple of guys bordering on poverty, going from job to job, just getting by.  Their repartee' was hilarious, though some might find it also cruel.  Abbott was the best straight man ever, but he could deal out some severe commentary on his sidekick and foil, Lou Costello.  This wasn't just for the camera, as they were the same off-camera too.
If you want to see where a lot of our comedy arose from, get this disk set and see the roots of the American situation comedy.",1417219200,2,1132,4.63

The first season, containing many of the vaudeville routines that made the act famous and the supporting cast that popularized the show is classic. The second season, with many of the original supporting cast gone (Stinky, Baccigaloupe, Hillary and eventually even Mike the cop-leaving only Mr. Fields till the end), resorts more to script writing, some of which is quite funny. However towards the end, as the series relies on new one appearance only characters, it becomes obvious that the show is nearing its end.

880441,5,6304463669,"One could argue that this television series represents Bud Abbott & Lou Costello at their very best. Not that they didn't make very funny features (they did) but for the most part, the Bud & Lou features from the late 40s going into the 1950s were very hit or miss.

But with this tv series, Bud & Lou only had 30 minutes to ply their trade, meaning you didn't have time for a lot of singing and dancing numbers or romantic subplots or other extracurricular nonsense which could be found in a lot of their features. Here on television, you had only had time to get to the business of comedy & Bud and Lou do an outstanding job.

In particular, Season 1 was chock full of comedic brilliance. I particularly enjoyed any episode where poor Lou was getting his butt kicked by the landlord, i.e. the hilarious episode ""Hillary's Birthday"" where Bud and Lou pull out the old ""turn on the radio"" gag. I almost died laughing every time Sidney Fields stormed into the apartment & kicked the crap out of Lou while Bud just coolly sits in a chair and watches.

Both Seasons by Entertainment One have been beautifully restored; I can't think of one show were there were any technical glitches. Plus there are a boatload of extra features to enjoy after you watch the complete tv episodes.

Basically, if you love Abbott and Costello you should definitely buy this set if you have not already.

880534,5,6304463669,"It doesn't get much better than this. The relationship between Bud and Lou seems to improve with age if that is possible. And the series would have not been the same without the great Sid Fields who, in addition to portraying the boys' landlord to whom they seemed to always owe back rent also was seen in other thinly disguised characters throughout series (Sid had many ""brothers""). This not to sell the series' other major characters short - Lou's ""girlfriend"" Hillary Brooke always seemed to play it straight, which was in perfect contrast to the rest of the goings-on; the seemingly always befuddled Mike the Cop blended a bit of mean spiritedness (""I'll run you in!!"") with hopeless incompetence; Joe Kirk's Mr. Bacciagalupe remains one of TV's most memorable characters with his countless business ventures and spot on Italian accent; and who can ever forget Lou's sometime pal and sometime enemy, the ""little boy"" Stinky who, dressed in his Buster Brown outfit strains credibility but inspires some of the most side-splitting antics in the series. A bit of a ""wild card"" in the series is Bingo the Chimp, who was well integrated into several episodes in Season One and suddenly disappeared (my understanding is that he bit Lou and that was the end of him).
Of course the stars of the show are the unforgettable Bud and Lou. I've watched each episode countless times and enjoy watching each boy's (they were always ""the boys"") reaction to the other in their routines. Perhaps my favorite is the ""loafing routine"" where Bud finally gives up on Lou's job prospects (or willingness to look for one) and gets a job himself in a bakery - loafing. The boys' body language throughout this routine is priceless as Bud unsuccessfully attempts to explain his job specs and compensation to an uncomprehending Lou.
So much has been made over the years of Lou's comic genius and deservedly so. Those of us born and raised in Paterson, NJ will never forget that Lou would frequently drop his birthplace into routines (TV Host: Where were you born? Lou: L.A. TV Host: Oh, Los Angeles? Lou: Paterson, NJ - I was around 9 when I first heard that and almost died when Lou mentioned Paterson!). He never forgot where he came from. In that same episode he mentioned a Hunky from Paterson, N.J. This was a real person who lived in Paterson's east side in the fifties. However, my favorite is Bud. Nobody ever played the straight man as well as Bud.
There is a disparity between the show's two seasons. Season One tended to have episodes built around the boys' routines, most of which reached back into their radio days; Season Two tended more towards the situation comedy genre. I would hate to have to choose between the two. I do believe, however, that Season Two afforded the boys an opportunity to relax and stretch out a bit where Season One was more hectic.
While I am pretty sure the series was not filmed before a live audience I often wonder what the source of the laugh track was. Listen carefully and you'll hear a distinctive female cackle in some episodes and what are, without a doubt, children in others, particularly in Season Two.
I recall Jackie Gleason once being asked why is ""The Honeymooners"" still so popular ..... his answer was simply ""Because it's funny"". Given today's so-called TV comedies which rely upon sexual innuendo, insult humor and other assorted foolishness the same answer applies to the boys' series after all these years - it's funny.

Fun stuff. I like to watch 3 or so episodes at a time. Bite-size video snacks that fit your schedule as you like. Tasty!  The packaging is well-intentioned and deluxe in its own way...but with a couple of glitches. To get at the discs, one needs to more or less ""unfold"" the box as one might open a roadmap. A little clumsy. (Remember LPs that opened up and the vinyl album was ""internally""installed?).The larger issue is that the discs are paired together and overlap slightly.

880912,5,6304463669,"Here it is, the greatest Comedy Team the US ever produced in 8 DVDs of their best Burlesque routines turned into a Television series way ahead of its time.  I was a TV baby boomer of the late fifties and early sixties absorbing genres which would eventually become my escapes throughout my life to the present day.  A show called 'Million Dollar Movie' was broadcast on WORTV Channel 9 in the New York area and would start at 11:00am and last the whole day until the 11:00 News at night.  They would show one film a week 5 times a day.  I saw the best Horror , Science Fiction, westerns and comedies and was able to watch them over and over again (with commercial interruption of course).  One week they showed 'RIDE EM' COWBOY' which introduced me to Bud Abbott and Lou Costello for the first time and they warped my mind forever.  Little did I realize that I was watching vintage Burlesque routines from their road shows which were adapted to their films and made them the biggest Box Office attraction during the war time years.  While this was happening, WPIX Channel 11 showed 'THE ABBOTT AND COSTELLO SHOW'.  Now I got to see A & C all the time all though I noticed they were a bit older but the TV show was not bogged down with musical numbers, sappy romantic interludes, or dramatics.  It was straight A & C.  Now, EI Entertainment has taken those wonderful memories and preserved them forever in this classic box set.  It comes with an excellent booklet with backgrounds on the cast and brings out an important element, Lou Costello knew that the Television medium was important to preserve their classic routines for future generations.  I hope he knows that he was right on the money. The quality for early TV is outstanding with crisp sound and clear picture throughout.  Buy this set and laugh as you've never laughed before and see the true genius of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello.  It doesn't get any better than this.",1281916800,8,1931,4.543352601156069

In my opinion, this earlier product has the visual edge: better contrast overall.

Extras on this one are fairly superfluous. Lou's two children comment on different subjects while home movie and other clips are sandwiched in. The younger gal was 10 when he died in 1959 so her stories and opinions may be secondhand.

I have the TV special HEY ABBOTT! in its original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1992-videotape/dp/6302364906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1992 videotape</a>&nbsp;version.

Finally, there's the two-reeler 10,000 KIDS AND A COP, a loving advertisement for the Lou Costello Jr. Foundation. This still operational Los Angeles recreation complex opened its doors in May '47. As we see in the Costello family's 16mm print, LCJF has a baseball field, pool, infirmary, library, hobby room and other amenties for kids of all ages.

880981,5,6304463669,I've read some of the reviewers on here complaining about the Abbott & Costello Show re-release being unnecessary and other gripes. Well let me say that this product is much better than the latter. First off the quality is better. On the previous release the disks were in cruddy cases that had a funny smell to it. Some of the disks had scratches or other flaws to them and usually one of the disks would not play at all. They were an inferior product. I had to return two season 1's because of this problem. Then when I tried to buy it again from a different party they were asking for upwards of one hundred to two hundred dollars. Like i'm going to pay that for something that shouldn't cost more than 30 or 40 dollars tops (Dang Robbers!)On this new product you get all the extra's the other ones had plus extra bonuses they didn't have. The price is reasonable. The quality is better. I haven't had one problem with this set. And I finally have all of the Abbott & Costello Show without going through all the headaches of the previous release.,1271721600,35,1049,4.412371134020619
880982,4,6304463669,"Bud Abbott & Lou Costello had a chance to do what no other comedy team could do: Every entertainment venue possible in their day. Being partnered in vaudeville, they quickly climbed the showbiz ladder to Broadway and then Hollywood. They made 36 films between 1941 and 1956; many of which were box office hits during their heyday (1942-1952). They also had a very succesful radio show, made personal appearances, and then in 1951; created their own television show.

Many comedy teams were seemingly forced to make movies with sub-plots and bad musical numbers.  Laurel & Hardy and Martin & Lewis were forced to play second banana in their own features from time to time.  Even though the musical numbers were better in Bud & Lou's feature films, there were many unnecessary sub-plots.  Why?  Because it was believed that comedians couldn't carry a full 90 minute vehicle.  Having been victims of the Hollywood system, when it came time to do things their own way--they created a half-hour show starring them with no sub-plots (and sometimes no plot!).

The show was a half-hour sitcom showcasing their wonderful routines from the 1940s.  Season One is infinitely superior, as many memorable routines and word-plays were re-packaged for the new TV audience.  Season Two, while still good, is more like a classic short subject/sitcom with a few classic routines added.

I'm sure my review here hasn't added anything new, but as  man in his early 20s, I must say these episodes are very funny and very timeless.  There are no references to politics, sex, etc.  The things we think make comedy today, didn't make comedy then.  Bud and Lou didn't need sex to be funny, they just needed a funny scream ""Heyyyy Abbotttt!""  You know you're in for a treat in when you hear that at the beginning of each show.  One of my friends asked me why I like these older comedies, I said, their timeless.  He couldn't believe that comedy back then didn't consist of politics and culture-based humor the way it does today.

So, here in this very inexpensive package are 9 DVDs, 52 episodes, and 4 hours of special features including interviews with Lou's daughters: Paddy & Chris Costello, home movies, a 1978 special hosted by Milton Berle, a short film about Lou's Junior Youth Foundation and a 44 page booklet; detailing the show, cast, and episodes.

If you're a fan of classic TV and looking for something cheap with good quality laughs to watch, this is it.  Most season set collections are at least $50; but here it's only a little over $37.  This show is also a great way to introduce kids to Abbott & Costello.  There's no reference to politics or culture of the day, just plain comedy a kid can enjoy in an easy half-hour setting.  If you are looking for a way to get kids interested in the duo, this is by far the best way.

Bud and Lou would go on to make a few relatively succesful/bland films between the end of the show (1953) and their split (1956); so in a way, this is their last great bow.  We see Bud & Lou still strong as their career is coming to a near end, and they really go out on top in this series.  This is their last best work, and should be enjoyed for generations to come.",1271548800,77,3184,4.601063829787234
880983,5,6304463669,"This collection is well worth the money. First of all, the quality is awesome. I still can not believe all the extras , including the home movies,interviews with Costellos daughters, Milton Berle special and the short film Lou Costello did as a tribute to his son that tragically drowned. The product would have been worth the money ,even without all the extras. These shows are still funny, yes even the second season. The menus are easy to navigate, with the info commerative booklet explaining the discs as well as giving bios on the recurring characters. All in all, this set should be a model as the way dvd sets should be marketed. This is a true gem and many thanks to e1homevideo for perfection. They even threw in postcards of our beloved comedians.

The DVD collection is very good, both audio & video. Like a time machine, I can now go back & enjoy a better time back in the 1950's when TV was great. You won't regret adding this set to your collection.",1270684800,16,461,4.310344827586207
880985,5,6304463669,"Some say opportunity only knocks once...well, for those of us who missed THE ABBOTT AND COSTELLO SHOW in its previous DVD releases this is another chance to add all of the 52 episodes to our collection.  The shows, digitally remastered, look and sound great and, as one might expect, contain many of the classic routines A&C made famous throughout their careers.  For the devoted A&C fan, this is a must have!

In addition to the shows on eight discs, this boxed set includes a ninth DVD of special features: ""Hey, Abbott"" 1978 TV special hosted by Milton Berle, a 1948 short film entitled ""10,000 Kids and a Cop,"" interviews with Chris and Paddy Costello, and ""Lou Costello Home Movies: Holidays and Celebrations.""  There are also a couple of bonus features included amid the shows: a classic routine reel and more Lou Costello home movies at home and in Europe.  You will also find four high-quality postcards featuring stills of the comedy duo.

The 52 episodes are listed on the covers of the two inner DVD cases, as well as in the Commemorative Booklet that comes with the set so it will be easy to find the shows you want to single out for another viewing.  This booklet includes biography information on the show's cast and a history of A&C's career.  The one potential drawback is that the fold-up boxed set comes in the traditional cardboard cover and may not hold up well over time.  The inner DVD plastic cases, however, are well-protected and should hold up just fine.

The comedy of Abbott and Costello remains as funny today as when it was originally broadcast.  This set gives the viewer the chance to once again sit back, laugh, and marvel at how these two men made such meticulously crafted routines look so easy.

So if you're a ""completist,"" buy this set, but if you want the ""Best Of,"" buy the Season One DVD.",1269388800,16,436,4.64935064935065

BTW, for non-watchers -- these episodes hold up very well against time.
Not quite 3 Stooges material nor is it I Love Lucy.

I've recently watched clips of some of the shows which will be included in this collection and they really haven't aged a bit - still very fresh. Great comedy routines, especially (of course!), ""Who's on first"".

And THREE hours of bonus material? Sounds better than ever. I've already ordered my copy and will probably order a couple more to give as gifts.",1266710400,10,601,4.714285714285714
881053,5,6304463669,"ABBOTT AND COSTELLO HVE BEEN THE PREMIER COMEDY DUO OF THE USA. THE TV SHOW WAS GENIUS. THEY WERE HILARIOUS AS WELL AS THEIR SUPPORTING NUTS LIKE  MR. FIELDS THE SUPER, THE COP AND MANY OTHERS.",1245715200,,193,4.361111111111111
881054,3,6304463669,"So much from ""The Golden Era of Television"" is lost that what DOES survive has to be seen as valuable cultural artifacts.  Apparently, a good deal of the Abbott and Costello Comedy Hour has survived and much of it has been released now on DVD.  I only recently viewed two episodes on a VHS tape I came across in my public library--and, yes, I'd certainly like to see more.

Every era--like every culture--has its own particular sense of humor.  I've read that Lou Costello (especially) and Bud Abbott always worked clean (a must of TV, of course, and in the movies of the era) but even live, apparently, they never went ""blue.""  Now I like edgy, contemporary humor as much as the next fellow.  But I can't help but feel a certain nostalgia for the more innocent humor of an earlier age.  This video has a sequence with featuring a somnambulent Lizabeth Scott unwittingly crawling into Lou's railcar berth.  Lou's reaction is more panicked than lewd--and that seems kind of sweet, actually.

Now that more than half a century has elapsed since these episodes were broadcast, one might forget that Abbott and Costello were a bit past their peak by the early 50s.  It's great to have a version of ""Who's On First"" or ""Two Tens for A Five"" on video now, and one tends to forget that these routines were getting a little stale for some of the duo's fans by this point.

By some accounts, they felt compelled to keep recycling their ""greatest hits"" (or their ""greatest bits""), which is understandable, given their tremendous popularity.  But it's also not to surprising either that by this point, they were being challenged by young upstart acts like Martin and Lewis.

With so much A&C available on DVD nowadays, I'd certainly be tempted to take a look.  But I can't help but wonder if, say, an entire season might not be overkill.  I like my nostalgia in small doses, as a rule.  This video is just about the right for me.  (PS. Love the old commercials!)",1215561600,2,1951,4.608695652173913

Before the Abbott and Costello Show which was done on film and aired later, these Colgate Shows aired live when television was still in it's infancy. It's another nice take on this classic duo, seeing them perform live. Yes, many of the routines will seem familiar as the boys perform great routines from their radio and film days.
