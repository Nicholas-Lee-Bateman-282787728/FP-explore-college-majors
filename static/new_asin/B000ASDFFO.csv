2391956,4,B000ASDFFO,"The DVD, Sex and the Teenage Mind, is a good teenage gift. Was it a great movie, no, but for the price it was perfect. It came in great condition. Thanks!",1384214400,,154,4.0
2391957,5,B000ASDFFO,"to put it bluntly, this was a gift to my brother. he loves it and watches it often but i've never seen it and never will.",1330992000,,121,3.6923076923076925
2391958,1,B000ASDFFO,"I like Allison Lange, she's a good actress, but the movie was just so so. Actually got bored.  Just a silly movie, brainless.",1219017600,4,125,4.434782608695652
2391959,1,B000ASDFFO,I made the mistake of thinking that this movie might be funny. It wasn't. I'd hoped that Danica McKellar would be more involved in the plot. She wasn't. All in all a bad movie. So bad in fact that it's embarassing to watch it.,1216252800,,226,4.159090909090909
2391960,4,B000ASDFFO,"Really, everyone is rating this movie against fantastic ones with morals such as walk the line or something to that effect.  In reality, it isn't a great movie, but when you are a teenage girl watching a movie at a sleepover with your friends it is hilarious.  The main character, virgil, is the most awkward boy ever and his lusting after the class beauty, kelly, seems impossible.  The quality of the movie sucks, it is true.  But think about this movie for what it is for a change: pure and stupid enjoyment with no moral, purpose, or anything.  It is just for fun... so lighten up everybody!",1142812800,12,595,4.5233644859813085
2391961,1,B000ASDFFO,"Painful is the best word to describe this movie. Everything down to the soundtrack is just awful. Its almost as though the writer ran out of time and was not able to go back and watch his own film. The movie will leave you asking why: why you rented the movie, why it is still on your tv, and why you have not killed yourself yet. The movie is actually funny though, but only because it makes you think of how pathetic the life of the director who made this movie would be. The movie is filled from start to finish with cliches so flagrant the only comedy is that the movie is not a parody. The low budget of the movie is apparent not only in the terrible cast but even down to the strippers boob-job. There are pointless subplots and plots left undeveloped, which is probably for the best. And just when you thought it was over, you find out that the last 45 minutes of the movie has been a dream sequence, making you wish the last two hours of your life had also been one. The brief entertaining moments are out of place and completely awkward, making you wish that you were watching a real movie. What is odd is if the brief nudity and profanity were removed it would jump from rated R to PG. In fact, the R rating is probably the only thing that has sold a copy of this movie.",1136851200,3,1280,4.165322580645161
2391962,1,B000ASDFFO,Sex and the Teenage Mind is the epitome of everything bad in a teenage sex comedy. It's like a bad version of Fast Times At Ridgemont High. It's not remotely funny and is just plain annoying. A waste of 90 minutes of your life.,1130198400,17,227,4.181818181818182
8079572,5,B000ASDFFO,"I would have given it four stars, but my wife said I had to give it five.  This is the classic teenage sexploitation film, and it is why Generation X believed in love, relationships, sex, and happy endings.  This film is not for intellectual exploration.  It's got some very simple themes:  the good guy CAN get the girl, everything revolves around love, sex is a central part of love, and somehow, things can always turn out all right.

It is one of a hundred similar films from the early 80s to the mid 90s, and it certainly doesn't explore any new ground.  But it is cute, often funny, and a great way to spend a couple of hours.  If you spend all of your time watching teenage sexploitation films, this will be just another one with barely anything to differentiate it from all the others.  If it has been a long time since you have seen one (as it was for us), it is really enjoyable and memorable.",1521849600,,903,4.333333333333333
