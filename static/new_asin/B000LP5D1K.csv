This one is very good - my family learned plenty and enjoyed the entire video.  We have Bethany Zill's music CD's too, I highly recommend them.  I hope she makes more music and more videos.",1172707200,3,291,4.2727272727272725

8162727,5,B000LP5D1K,"My grandsons, ages 2 1/2 and 18 months, loved this! I bought this for them as a Christmas present. Their daddy, my son, is an air crew chief with the Marine Corps, and the boys are all about airplanes and jets. With my son being deployed during Christmas this year, the DVD seemed to bring his presence a little closer to us. Highly recommend this for any child who is into airplanes.",1421798400,,384,4.347222222222222

8162731,5,B000LP5D1K,"Child's Review:

There's a kid named Derrick and his family makes a model airplane.  And then they tell us all about flying them.  You get to see real airplanes like the Blue Angels.  At the end, they show the air races that happen every year at Neymore, Nevada  (Mom clarifies: Reno).  Well, the movie doesn't show airplane crashes, but it shows a crashed model airplane, with the front wings broke off.  And there are songs.  Like ""I want to fly"".  And they talk about a cowboy movie at the end -- it's a commercial.

Every kid would give this a thumbs-up.

Mom's Review:

Spellbinding.  Corny, but fascinating.",1282089600,,634,4.75
8162732,4,B000LP5D1K,"I bought this DVD after my 2-year-old LOVED the ""All About John Deere Tractors Part I.""  I didn't want another tractor DVD, so I switched to airplanes.  It was advertised at the end of the tractor DVD and sounded great.

He likes it, but not as well as the tractor DVD.  I think there are two reasons why.  First, he's obsessed with tractors.  And the tractor DVD has catchy music, which this is more just talking.

This really is a good video.  Kids like it because it's airplanes.  Adults like it because it includes information about all types of flying machines and the history behind them.",1264377600,,594,4.528301886792453
8162733,2,B000LP5D1K,"I thought this would be great viewing for my Grandson, unfortunately it was so boring we both fell asleep, and he doesnt want to watch it anymore !!! sad really, cause his favorite thing to do is watch the planes go over, we live near an airport............",1210982400,5,257,4.48936170212766
