8084430,2,B000BB1MGE,"Watchin this video definitely will make you understand the importance of the putting in golf. But the OPEN is not just putting.

Overall, this video contains too much talking by the commentator. The portion of players' action should be more, and much more than the portion they had in the video. And alos there way too many putting segments than full swings and other swings.

Very disappointed by the content.",1192665600,,410,4.8428571428571425
