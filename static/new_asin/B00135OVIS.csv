8249291,5,B00135OVIS,"I think this was a very good debate for helping me think through some of the biblical and philosophical arguments on both sides of this debate.  I think the debate outcome was clear, but to me the more important value was thinking through the issues.",1384732800,3,250,4.555555555555555
8249292,5,B00135OVIS,"This is a great debate for those who are already somewhat familiar with the issues. It is not intended for those who have no exposure to the Calvinism-Arminianism debate, nor is it intended for those who are professional theologians. It is intended to give laypeople a balanced view of both sides. I think it does that well. I've shown it to several of my introductory theology classes and it has been well received. Interestingly, the majority of my students seem to think that the Arminians do a better job of arguing their points than do the Calvinists. I think they can see through the Calvinists' pretension that they have no philosophical presuppositions that influence their exegesis, and they appreciate that the Arminians are very ""up front"" about how their philosophical conclusions are implications of the Bible rather than clear biblical statements. Obviously both sides are making inferences from biblical passages: the question is not about who believes the Bible but rather who is interpreting it correctly.",1320796800,4,1022,5.162650602409639
8249293,4,B00135OVIS,"Although this debate will never end, it will also always look the same.  The Arminians will just about always use philosophical attacks to debate against Calvinism and Calvinist will use exegesis of the bible.  The question has never been or will never be how either systematic theology suits us but rather which one is biblical.  And I think that by the end of the debate most people will know who was biblical and who was dancing around biblical text.

This debate was very good with both camps faithfully expressing classic Arminianism and Calvinism.  The video was a little off at times, the audio and visual were out of sync, but everything else seemed fine. Overall I recommend this product to anyone that likes a civilized debate.",1235347200,14,737,4.817460317460317
8249294,5,B00135OVIS,"Two facts up front: (1)I DO have theological leanings in this longstanding debate, (2) I viewed this objectively.  One side presented their case from the standpoint of the exegesis of scripture.  They seemed content to let the Bible reveal God.  The other side from the outset seemed more concerned with trying to make God ""look good"", to dismiss views which made God seem ""unloving"".  That approach was more philosophical than exegetical.  Now, watch it for yourself and see which side took which approach.",1230854400,14,507,5.0602409638554215
8249295,5,B00135OVIS,"This video is very simple, not technically excellent (there are some mismatches where the voice does not match the video), but the actual debate is awesome- very informative and challenging. What I learned is that the two sides are farther apart than I thought. In my mind there was a clear winner - one side who presented their side more persuasively. But you will have to watch it and make up your own mind!",1222646400,7,409,4.54054054054054
