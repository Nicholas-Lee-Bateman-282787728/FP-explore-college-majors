896194,5,6304504039,"For the past five years I have been obssessed with the musical, Evita, and the woman.  When I heard that Madonna and Antonio Banderas were to star in the movie adaptation of Evita, I was thrilled.  With such a fantastic cast and crew, I had high expectations of the film.  I saw Evita for the first time at the St. Louis premiere of the film and I was not disappointed.  Madonna did a great job playing Evita.  I did miss the belting voice of Patti LuPone, however.  Antonio Banderas did the best vocals of any Che I have heard.  And Jonathan Pryce delivered an emotional performance.  Evita is a must see!  END",891993600,,611,4.383928571428571
896195,5,6304504039,"Madonna and Antonio Banderas do  wonderful performances in this film.  I'm not a big fan of Madonna's but I will admit that this film kept me enthralled the entire time.  ""I  Would Be Good For You"" is done beautifully and ""You Must Love Me"" is a haunting song during a tragic scene.  I highly recommend this movie.  END",890697600,,319,4.413793103448276

896356,5,6304504039,I saw this movie when it was in theater's. I Enjoyed it then and have had a DVD copy for a very long time. I have to say that Madonna nails the role of Eva. I always thought I was a shame she did not receive at least an Oscar nomination for her hard work.. I am a Patti Lapone  fan but feel Madonna did the part justice. I highly recommend this movie.,1520467200,,351,3.808219178082192

896444,5,6304504039,Great movie. A musical for ones who might not love them as much as I do! Catchy songs.  different perspectives on the icon that was Eva Peron! Loved this movie when I saw it in theaters. Has loved it for years!!!,1511740800,,212,4.170731707317073
896511,5,6304504039,"This is a fantastic movie that still holds up decades later.  I'm not a musical fan, nor a fan of Madonna as an actress, but Evita is one of the few exceptions. It's so well done and riveting that I can't keep my eyes off the screen.  Madonna does an incredible job in this.  A great deal of that has to do with the fact that this is a 2 hour film, with most of it being music and singing performance.  Madonna excels in the music video world, so this is like a 2 hour long entertaining music video.  She also does a superb job at embodying the physicality of Eva Peron.  Most musicals I find irritating and like a cheese grater on my forehead, but this one has melody to it with a rock sound accompanied by some latin arrangements.  It's so powerful I never get tired of it.  Madonna's voice is strong here, but I heard beforehand she took operatic voice lessons.  This was about that point where her voice in general as a singer grew stronger than it was before, so those lessons definitely paid off.  I also love the rags to riches story element of the real life Eva Peron being born into severe poverty and ex-communicated by her own father and his side of the family when he died.  In Evita, she has passion, persistence, and drive to do something with her life.  She quickly rises up the ranks from bad actress in lousy movies and commercials, while using one person after another to further her gain all the way up to become the First Lady of Argentina.  Not bad for someone from the schticks.  This is a colorful composite vividly shot with immense beauty and an exceptional supporting cast with Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce.",1510444800,3,1640,4.40531561461794

896514,4,6304504039,"I really didn't expect to like this production of Evita, not being an Andrew Lloyd Weber, or Madona fan, but I thought the movie was excellent. Antonio Banderas had me hooked from the beginning with his intensity and I wanted to know why he was so darn mad! Madona doesn't always hit the high notes, but is pretty good too.",1508544000,,323,4.4

896584,4,6304504039,"Plays, books, and movies are always adapted to fit the media. Many times this can be an advantage. Modifying the story is a producer's privilege. The photograph was superb. And the period consumes gave a feel of authenticity. The kept the Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice musical pretty much in tact. However when Madonna usurped ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"" this contributed to the loss of the consistency of the story.

The addition of the Navel Cadets' revolt was a good touch and improved on the authenticity of the story. However, the essence of the movie like the play is the singing. Madonna is the only person that has no range, and cannot even talk through a song. If only they dubbed her, the movie would be worth viewing. Maybe they can adjust this on a DVD.",1500940800,,771,4.669117647058823

896646,3,6304504039,"The blu-ray version does not have the ""resume play feature"" which means that whenever one stops, the program starts from the beginning.  I think the assumption that people watching this at home will watch it all the way through with no interruption does not reflect how many people watch programs at home.  The images are very clear with great detail.  The sound is fine.  There is one extra ""the making of"" which is fairly good.  I basically disliked the director's approach to the material.  The scenes were herky-jerky.  The were too many out-of-sequence flashbacks.  The Che Guevara character was not portrayed as a revolutionary but merely an ""everyman"" who kept showing up for a singing number.  I also thought the film was much too long and contained ""padding"" that did little to advance the plot.  Madonna and the other principals were fine.  Madonna was in great voice and carried the songs nicely; she looked great.  The sets, the makeup, costumes, and hair were all great.  However, for me, it did not come together to produce a great musical.  For an idea of what I consider to be a great filming of a musical go watch, the Music Man, My Fair Lady, the Sound of Music or the King and I.",1493337600,,1198,4.642857142857143

But I am strictly looking at the whole thing as Madonna's fan. It's mind-blowing that Madonna pulled this off full 20 years ago ... Madonna as pop-cultural character has created many moments for people to talk about and for her fans to live through vicariously. Out of all Madonna moments throughout the years, EVITA is a my personal favourite Madonna moment. EVITA's music and lyrics are beautiful, magical and intoxicating ...

The two male leads are ugly and poor actors. The plot, what there is of it, is laughably unfaithful to real Argentine society of the period. Argentina is the last place on earth to depict via such aweful, ungainly music.

897269,5,6304504039,"I saw Evita probably six or seven times on Broadway -- mostly with Deren Altay, who was magnificent. Madonna is neither Lupone or Altay, but she is more than adequate though she doesn't have the voice of her stage counterparts and her music is transposed down. IF you want to hear Evita as it should be sung, get the Broadway cast CD (NOT the British cast CD -- Elaine Page may be a great actress, but her odd sprechstimme does the music no service). Banderas has a surprisingly nice voice, but his English is so problematic that many of Rice's clever lines are lost in the thickets of his tortuous accent. Kudos to Jonathon Price, a fine actor who sings well, though he is a softer, less hard-edged Peron than as he was played on the stage.

But, since neither Lupone or Altay appear to have been recorded on video, this movie is IT. Much of the magic of the staging is gone, since the movie is shot very literally. One misses the magical moment when Peron and Evita meet, as the entire cast freezes in place while they sing a duet; or the game of musical chairs while the generals sing ""Politics the art of the possible' or at the very end Peron fleeing offstage, as the real one fled Argentina into exile; but the witty lyrics that surrealistically tell Evita's story with surprising historical accuracy are all here. The movie's orchestrations are bigger and flabbier than the leaner, more muscular stage scoring, and the addition of an extra aria and music does a disservice to the pace of the story. Well, beggars can't be choosers, so we can all be grateful that Hollywood produced a decent, workmanlike Evita that carries most of the punch of the stageplay if not most of the magic.",1466208000,,1690,4.540983606557377

The verdict is SHE DOES and then some. Those who found fault with it insisting she didn't do the play justice need to understand that this is a FILM and therefore should be judged as such.

It is always a challenge for any actor to take on an iconic role. There was much written about the making of this film for years with many actresses being named to play the lead including Meryl Steep. But Madonna slays the role. Even if you are not a fan of the singer it would be hard not to admit, if pressed just how good she is in the role not just as an actress but a singer. The direction by Alan Parker is flawless and the choreography visually astounding. To everyones credit this is an incredible, must -see film.

Madonna is a convincing Eva Peron, and Antonio Banderas is Che who, after much thought, I have decided is Everyman in Argentina.  it is the true story, told in operatic style, of the commoner who rose to be first lady of Argentina in ruthless times.  Shunned by the upper class, Eva is worshiped (prayed to, even) by the masses.  The movie begins with Eva's funeral (she died of cancer when she was 33 years old) and flashes back to the funeral of her father which she and her mother and siblings were not allowed to attend because the children were illegitimate and it goes forward with almost no spoken dialog but beautiful powerful songs to her death.

898349,5,6304504039,"I was compelled to write this review because of negativity galore in other reviews. I am unbiased because I had no exposure to any of the original stage productions.  A much listened to disc ""The Premiere Collection"" gave me the London West End's (1st production) Julie Covington's interpretation of ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina.""  Here Madonna's interpretation pales in comparison.  Perhaps Patti Lupone was magnificent on Broadway however she overcame extremely negative feelings and I quote her:  ""Evita was the worst experience of my life.  I was screaming my way through a part that could only have been written by a man who hates woman.  And I had no support from the producers... It was like Beirut, and I fought like a banshee.""

My review is based upon my Blu Ray version purchased from Amazon.  The Disc's extra ""The Making of Evita"" brought into focus why this production works for me.  Alan Parker stated that he went about making a movie in which dialogue was sung rather than spoken.  The vastness of the sets and use of extras by the hundreds ( ? near thousands ) coupled with the lush musical score was very involving, personally.  The 5.1 sound in my Home Theater was wonderful.  My first exposure to this work was on Direct TV and one of the reasons for my Amazon purchase was to express my opinion.

The outstanding performance by the headliners was given by Banderas in my opinion, expressing great vocal sensitivity, range, and strength; his character was also the best developed.  An additional highlight was Parker's close ups' of ordinary Argentinian's faces with wonderful lighting in emotional moments.  Lighting 4+, Stage Sets 4+, Choreography 4+, Art Direction 4+, Costume Design 4+, Direction 4+, Sound and Film Scoring 4+.

Nonetheless, I can understand those with previous stage experience expressing disappointment.  I saw stage productions of Les Mis (Colm Wilkinson) and the Phantom (Michael Crawford) 3 times each; the cinematic renditions were vast disappointments.

However, taken on it's own, this is a Wonderful Cinematic Musical Experience.  I'm hard pressed to think of another Movie Musical that surpasses it.  Additional viewings over time almost always bring to mind the thought: How did I miss that.  Kudos to Alan Parker.",1437523200,5,2266,5.053908355795148

898355,5,6304504039,"The musical ""Evita"" in 1996, was transferred to the screens. Director Alan Parker took an unusual and time-consuming project. Through song and music, created by outstanding composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, Parker had to show the amazing Argentine life of Eva Peron. I am sure that the musical was a success. This production is unusual in that in this film played a major role Queen of pop Madonna. In this film, Madonna has proven that she is can sing. Her voice graced the melismas and she managed to each vocal part, to bring different emotions, from sadness to joy. Moreover, I am sure that Parker and all the participants in this musical, convincingly showed the life of Eva Peron. Thank you very much!",1435881600,,703,4.770491803278689

898433,5,6304504039,"When I first saw Evita it was my senior year in high school that was back in 2001. My cinema teacher played the movie. When I found it had Madonna in it I was like oh great. I wasn't a fan then.

It only took a few minutes before I was hooked on the movie. I love all the songs in the movie. There is not one bad song. It's rare I say this about a movie but this one in my opinion is perfect from the second it starts to the second it ends.

As soon as I saw the movie I called my local mall and I was thrilled they had the double disc complete soundtrack.

I think Madonna & Antonio Banderas were both amazing. Jonathan Pryce was great as Juan Peron. When I started researching the Perons after I saw the movie I was amazed how much Jonathan Pryce looks like the real Juan Peron. Jonathan Pryce was also close to the same age as Juan Peron. I can definitely see why he was picked to play Juan Peron.

Madonna looks so much like Eva Peron it's in a way kind of eerie. I do agree with Madonna no one else could have played Eva Peron but her. I don't believe in reincarnation but if it did exist I would have to say Madonna is the reincarnation of Eva Peron. I also agree with Madonna when she said she was born to play Eva Peron.

I did own the regular DVD years ago. I decided to buy the Blu Ray edition. I love this movie and I know it is one I will watch over and over. Even though it cost twice as much to get the Blu Ray I know I will get my money's worth out of it.

My two favorite songs are Oh What A Circus and The Waltz For Eva And Che. One reason I love Oh What A Circus is Antonio Banderas sounded so passionate about the loss of Eva Peron. What I am about to say is a  spoiler. If you haven't seen the movie you might not want to read this part.

Spoiler
When Che (Antonio Banderas) was saying to Eva's picture how Eva let down her people all they wanted was for her to be immortal and that wasn't much to ask for but in the end she couldn't deliver. Then Che calmly bends down and picks up a rock as he throws it at her picture you can see the look of anger he has towards her as he throws the rock it hits her picture causing the picture to fall and the picture to be destroyed. They used a picture of the real Eva Peron.

To me that scene is an important and touching scene. We see how Eva's death affected Che. Che is a worker like Eva was. Unlike the other workers Che saw how his Savior changed from her humble beginnings to letting power go to her head. Midway through the movie Che tells Eva she only thinks about doing for herself and she has forgotten her people meaning the workers. Che hints to viewers how Eva was stealing some of the money from the Eva Peron Foundation. Che also didn't believe Eva's words during Don't Cry For Me Argentina. Half way through the song he starts shaking his head. He knows his Saint has started to change.

I do think it was a nice tribute to the real Juan & Eva Peron to use their pictures throughout the movie instead of Madonna & Jonathan Pryce's pictures. They used very few pictures of Madonna as Eva Peron. I did like them using the real Peron's pictures. I think by doing that it made the movie more personal and touching. They used very few pictures of Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron. When Eva & Juan are entering the ball there you can see just how much Jonathan Pryce looks like Juan Peron since Jonathan is wearing an outfit exactly like the real Juan Peron wore in the picture.

Spoiler
There is some fiction to this movie. There are no records showing that Augustin Magaldi performed in Eva's home town when she was 15. Another fictional part is the brief reunion between Eva & Magaldi at the charity concert. The truth to that reunion is there wasn't one. It would literally have been 100% impossible for Augustin Magaldi to have performed at that charity concert because the real Augustin Magaldi died five years BEFORE the charity concert.

I just saw today the making of special feature (June 1, 2015). I do completely agree when Madonna said she thinks she was sort of possessed by Eva Peron and that Madonna felt some electricity in the air while on the balcony where Eva once stood. Unless Eva possessed her I just can't see how Madonna can make the viewer believe she is Eva Peron while on Eva's balcony in the exact same spot where Eva would stand. From the videos I've seen of Eva giving her speeches on the same balcony Madonna's performance is very similar to Eva's.

All I can say is give this movie a chance. It's a really amazing movie. I watched it with my mind set I would hate it. But I was wrong I love this movie. It's because of Evita I became a fan of Madonna's.

I also coincidentally got the Blu Ray DVD of Evita today June 1, 2015 which is the birthday of Jonathan Pryce.

If you have not seen Evita borrow it from a friend/relative/library or buy a copy. It is truly an amazing movie.

Due to Evita I have been researching all I can on Eva & Juan Peron & Peronism. Once you see the movie you will more than likely want to learn more about them. History has never interested me. It never held my attention. But for some reason I want to know all I can about the mysterious Eva & Juan Peron & Peronism.

The Blu Ray is much better than the regular DVD. The picture is still wide screen but the black bars are thinner. The image quality is really good compared to the regular DVD. The Blu Ray version has a making of feature it's around 40 minutes. It's definitely worth watching the making of. You get to see how much work it took to make this amazing movie.",1433116800,5,5551,4.148837209302326

Evita is one of my favourite ""rock opera"" type musicals. I of course own the original cast recording of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evita-20th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000006YKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evita [20th Anniversary Edition</a>] featuring Julie Covington's massively successful recording of ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"". I've seen it on the stage four times and was eagerly awaiting a big screen adaptation. The original film release in 1996 polarised cinema goers and critics alike and the film is not perfect but it's as good as it could possibly be. After waiting for this Blu-ray edition to get a domestic release in my part of the world (we're still waiting),I gave up and ordered the U.S. import from Amazon which thankfully is not region locked like some American BRD's. Finally getting the treatment it deserves,Evita now looks the part on home video after three releases. Obviously the first major improvement is in the quality of the image but that's not all folks. We now have a dts-HD soundtrack that does the film justice boasting a wide soundstage for Andrew Lloyd Webber's lush orchestrations,good bottom end boost when needed and appropriate centre channel levels for the vocal track. There's also a 42 minute behind the scenes bonus feature that appears to be from the original theatrical release time frame with all major players (including director Alan Parker,Madonna,Antonio Banderas and Andrew Lloyd Webber) participating. I saw this film five times when it was at cinemas and Disney have really excelled at delivering Evita to our home screens in glorious hidef widescreen with an outstanding audio soundtrack to match. It finally looks AND sounds like it did on the big screen.

I have to admit that, as a long-time Spanish teacher, I've almost always ignored movies set in Latin America that are originally filmed in English - ugh! For that reason, I had never paid much attention when I saw parts of this film. But, after spending five days in that most marvelous city, visiting el Museo Eva Peron (hate her husband's politics,but have to appreciate the human energy she exerted throughout her life),the Casa Rosada, the Catedral, etc. I have to say the film quite intensely captures the spirit of the Argentinian experience, at least this aspect. Madonna actually does a pretty good job singing and her persona is so similar that of Ms. Peron, while Banderas(whose singing is not up to it, but whose charisma makes up for it -the device of his character in the narrative is ingenious - quite properly calls attention to those points of the period that require underlining.

You do not need Blu-Ray for this film as the 'action' is musical and not visual in general.  From the opening overture to 'Don't Cry for me[Argentina]', the music is among the best of any musical film or stage score.

Someone who is not familiar with the history of Evita Perone and Argentina would have a difficult time understanding the story.  Also, it really looked as if the songs were lip-synced, like all of Madonna's live performances are.

Antonio Banderas is by far the most intriguing character in the play (he's the narrator).  He is always dressed up as a part of each scene, blending in just as if he was really there.  You look forward to his singing (which is really good), not so much for the singing, but because of the humor (mostly dry) in each of his songs.  Five stars for him, but not the movie.",1413936000,,766,4.460431654676259

899283,5,6304504039,"Let me first preface this by saying that I am NOT a fan of Madonna, as an actress or as a singer.  I have enjoyed Antonio Banderas as an actor and a as a singer in the few roles I've seen him in (Zorro, Shrek 2, etc.).  The rest of the cast I know nothing about, and while I enjoy reading and viewing things about history post-WW2, I never really took the time or interest in this movie until just now.  I found an old review of it on IMDB while looking up something else, and decided on a whim to check it out, since I do enjoy Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals (Phantom of the Opera, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar).

All that being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I was caught up in the drama and in Eva's rise to power as portrayed by Madonna.  I certainly don't condone the methods that she used in her meteoric rise, but I'm also not naive enough to think that such things don't happen in the political world, or even in the professional world.  I've seen some reviews on here claiming that they had difficulty understanding the lyrics to the song, or that Banderas and Madonna don't even come close to matching the original Broadway cast - I had no difficulty at all in understanding the songs.  ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"" is heartfelt, ""Rainbow High"" matches Madonna's vocal range brilliantly, and the combination of  ""You Must Love Me"" and ""Eva's Final Broadcast"" brought me to tears.

I don't know if Juan and Eva Peron really did love each other as they are depicted in the movie, or if their marriage was one of convenience and based on what Eva was able to do for Juan, but I was completely sold on them as a loving, if politically scheming couple with possibly morally ambiguous aspirations for power.  Eva's deathbed scene, where she can't bring herself to admit that she loves Juan and is only concerned that she's no longer any use to his political career is a heart-tugging moment, since it's obvious that she wants to say it, especially as he is sitting there by her bedside so that she doesn't have to die alone, with tears rolling down his cheeks.

On Banderas' side, the director's decision to make him into a quasi-omniscient narrator/voice of the people was a brilliant decision.  I don't even know who the character is supposed to represent from history, but I didn't care in the least once I figured out that he was more of an ""every-man"" of the Argentinian people. ""Oh, What A Circus"" opens the movie brilliantly and sets the tone for those who have no idea who Eva Peron was and shows how easily public opinion can change for those who have such a sharp rise to power. ""High Flying, Adored"" shows off his vocal range impressively, and he matches Madonna well when they come together for ""A Waltz for Che and Eva"".

I love the way Webber's music flows so well.  Going from a solemn requiem to the rock-themed second half of ""Oh, What A Circus"", to the Latin flair of ""Buenos Aires"" and all the other musical styles he works into the music keeps the movie varied and catchy.  The music becomes a character in its own right, which is a good thing, since there is almost no spoken dialogue in the movie - almost every line is sung.  ""Rainbow Tour"" is a fun, catchy song that I've found myself humming all day, and the various le motifs used by the different characters (""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"" and ""Buenos Aires"" for Evita) give a sense of continuity, even as the song styles change from piece to piece.  I've never seen the Broadway version of this musical, but simply filming a staged version of the play wouldn't have the same impact as this movie did.  Another musical that pulled this off brilliantly (and ironically enough, another Webber musical) was ""Phantom of the Opera"".  This is not the Broadway version, and they don't pretend that it is.  It should be able to rise and fall on its own terms, and to be completely honest, I think it excels brilliantly.",1397174400,3,3950,4.511921458625526
899284,4,6304504039,"I have always felt that this musical was underappreciated.  The story is historical, the characters are believable, and the songs are memorable.",1397174400,,144,5.545454545454546
899285,5,6304504039,"In light of the U.S. media's renewed interest in South America following the election of Pope Francis, film buffs may find it fun to revisit ""Evita,"" the 1996 hit musical about Juan and Eva Peron's rise to power in 1940s Argentina. Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron, Antonio Banderas as a fiery revolutionary ""chorus"" character, and especially Madonna as Evita make this essentially shallow and silly material work. Some of the songs are catchy, but it's the film's image of power and success built on the suffering and exploitation of the poor that remains in one's memory. In the wake of Pope Francis's election, Madonna's look here recalls images of Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner decked out in haute couture outfits during her presidential election in a country where millions live in utter poverty, and it's no surprise that the ""Peronist"" party remains in power there today.

Madonna, after making a favorable impression in ""Dick Tracy,"" gets the role of her life here as the powerful woman who uses sex to rise to the top of her game before a swift and tragic demise. As one expects from Madonna, the film is laden with Catholic imagery (she has a rock-star swoon during communion in one scene) mingled with symbols of power and sex. She sings and seduces her way through the film with cheerful, effortless charm. There is certainly a narcissism and superficiality to Evita, but it's a fun movie inasmuch as it revels in these qualities with a cheeky self-awareness that hints at the dark side of its protagonist.

This DVD is the original bare bones 1990s release, with ""play"" and chapter stops, no special features. It's a nicely unadorned disc for a movie overloaded with rich visual imagery. The elaborate filmmaking style of Alan Parker, the socially minded director who helmed ""Evita,"" comes through very sharply on the disc. I recommend it.",1396483200,,1858,4.951923076923077

899287,4,6304504039,"Madonna did a fabulous job in this movie. She may not have the most gorgeous voice, but for this movie she did t have to. It's more about the emotions of the song & she connected perfectly. I felt what she was trying to convey.",1395187200,,227,4.066666666666666
899288,5,6304504039,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. Madonna's portrayal of Eva Peron is masterful and Antonio Banderes as Che is perfect. The music and acting are superb, the costumes beautiful, and the casting golden. The only drawback on this movie is the fact that it's heavily skewed on it's portrayal of the historical figure Eva Duarte de Peron. Andrew Loyd Webber based his musical off a biography written by anti-Peronist political opponents which had a heavily biased opinion of her and, in some places, just made stuff up. Eva Peron did not come to Buenos Aires with Migaldi, he nearly always traveled everywhere with his wife and never did a show in her home town. Eva was brought to the city with her mother who set her up with family friends and a job. She and her husband fought tooth and nail to give women the right to vote and participate in politics. Evita also was very dedicated to the poor. While dying from cancer Eva defied the pleas of her husband and doctors and continued to work 20 hour days with her charity, which did keep financial records, helping the poor and destitute.

Enjoy this musical as it's a VERY good one, but don't go into it expecting an accurate portrayal of Eva Peron. If you want to learn more about the real woman you can read Evita: The Real Life of Eva Peron by Fraser and Navarro.",1394841600,5,1323,4.4896265560165975

899406,2,6304504039,"Evita suffers from many problems that disallow it to be watched as a complete and enjoyable film. Not only is the continuity vulgarized, the director often manages to confuse the film viewer as to what exactly is going on. This is not a great film, not even a good one, what carries it are the production values, songs, and locations.

After getting through the extremely boring commencement of the picture, I noticed that there would be no dialogue in this picture at all, at every moment someone was singing a silly and repetitive song. This isn't bad in its whole, but when everyone is already confused about the character it becomes extremely agitating. The voice dubs of the songs are so apparent that the film seems contrived and indifferent to its tackiness. Here we have people that are supposed to be singing and yet the contorted sound room song is playing and they are merely mouthing their parts. Banderas is terrible in his singing abilities yet his presence is well recommended. In this role he plays the conscience of the working class, a ""Che Guevera"" type revolutionary whom witnesses Eva's ascension and ultimate fall.

Madonna is wonderful in this role, not only can she move around the screen in charismatic beauty but her songs are capable and worthy. The sets are absolutely gorgeous and the costumes are fabulous. What we get in the end is a romanticized MTV style video but it is dreadfully long at 2 1/2 hours. I couldn't wait til the termination. Everything is not a concise whole, so the film flounders and ultimately fails.",1388620800,,1551,4.7835820895522385

Evita in the modern tradition is a one-song movie, like Hello Dolly and Damn Yankees. This is one of those. There are other songs in this one, but all the others sound much the same. But its haunting music pervades the movie ending in the conversion of its most famous song Don't Cry for Me, Argentina into a funeral dirge played as a slow tango, so appropriate.

899625,5,6304504039,"Alan Parker's movie-musical EVITA, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice stage show of the same name, is an epic biopic of Eva Peron, setting to music her rise to fame, prominence, and eventual first-ladyship on the arm of Argentine president Juan Peron. A woman worshipped by many and despised by as many others, Madonna plays the title role. Antonio Banderas costars opposite her as Che, a fictional (and apparently invisible) everyman who appears throughout the film playing devil's advocate to many of Eva's achievements. Character actor and theatre veteran Jonathan Pryce portrays Juan Peron, the third principal player of EVITA.

Arguably one of Lloyd Webber's finest shows, EVITA's greatest strength lies in its wealth of excellent songs, matched to scale by Alan Parker's steady directorial hand, crafting a film whose sheer elegance meets (and perhaps even exceeds) the high bar set by the original musical. Like JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR, an earlier Rice/Lloyd Webber collaboration, EVITA contains very little spoken dialogue, it is in fact almost an opera. What little dialogue exists was cowritten by Alan Parker and Oliver Stone. The toe-tapping highlights include ""Oh, What A Circus"", ""Buenos Aires"", ""Another Suitcase In Another Hall"", ""I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You"", ""High Flying, Adored"", and, of course, EVITA's iconic ballad ""Don't Cry For Me, Argentina."" Nabbing EVITA the 1997 Oscar for Best Original Song, ""You Must Love Me"", an additional tune cooked up by Rice and Lloyd Webber especially for the film, adds a tender emotional poignancy to the latter stages of Eva's saga.

If you are reading this review and have not seen the film, your primary concerns might revolve around Madonna as Eva Peron. How could a pop star, though not often an actress, fare in such a high-profile leading role? Forgive the (totally intended) EVITA-related pun, but...she's suprisingly good. Along with a solid performance in all other respects, Madonna's vocals convey well the many sides of Eva Peron's makeup: the fragility, pain, and lingering resentments from her youth, her drive and passion to help Argentina's working classes, as well as her eyes-on-the-prize iciness and savvy skill at manipulating both herself and others in the course of her ultimate ambition. Toward the end of the film, with terminal cancer setting in and Evita's demise imminent, Madonna's performance stirred me almost to tears. Crucify me now, but I believe Madonna proves herself a better Evita than Patti LuPone. I, for one, don't miss LuPone's overtly brash, annoyingly Americanized performance. I was always partial to Elaine Page's Eva Peron in the original West End production, and I feel Madonna is more in line with my preferred take on the first lady.

Antonio Banderas, though lesser vocalist compared to Madonna, still holds his own as a singer and delivers an overall excellent performance as Che. Both David Essex (Original West End) and Mandy Patinkin (Original Broadway) were superior in the role, but Banderas' presence does add some appreciated Hispanic representation to one of the key parts. Jonathan Pryce also provides a intriguingly ambiguous turn for what he is given. Despite it, however, Juan Peron remains nothing more than a supporting part; the primary gravity of the story stays where it should be, the conflict between Eva and Che. Though Pryce is briefly allowed to shine on his own in ""She Is A Diamond.""

I wholly recommend EVITA, a grand piece of entertainment in almost every regard, even for its handful of flaws. The most notable foible is the loss of some of the original musical's bite, with a fair few of Tim Rice's more provocative lyrics (the ones deemed too critical or unflattering toward Eva Peron) either toned down or removed completely in the translation from stage to screen. While still not afraid to lift the curtain on Eva's negative qualities, the film will seem noticeably neutered to any fans of, say, the original Broadway production and its accompanying cast recording. Viewers who do not count themselves among the purists will most likely not be bothered by the changes, for the musical's essence, and the political angle of its two creators, remains largely intact. These revisions were probably made as part of a deal allowing Alan Parker, his cast, and the crew into Argentina in pursuit of authentic locales. This seems to me a fair trade off, especially for their ability to shoot the crucial scene of Eva addressing scores of her followers from the balcony of the actual Casa Rosada. Another significant change which benefits the film version: the reeinstatement of ""The Lady's Got Potential"" and the reduction of the show's weakest link, ""The Art Of The Possible"", to little more than a passing mention. The song is not missed at all, to be quite honest.

To sum it all up, EVITA is a beautiful production, well worth the time of anyone who enjoys a great musical, and even more, a great story!",1375833600,5,4951,5.084870848708487

Also I prefer music + dialogue better than all music musical.

900042,4,6304504039,"On July 26, 1952, a 33-year-old woman named Maria Eva Durarte de Peron would become part of international pop culture.  On that very day, the second wife of Argentina President Juan Peron and the First Lady of Argentina would pass away due to cancer.  And her memory continues to live on today!

Eva ""Evita"" Peron, her story has captured the attention of people worldwide.  Growing up poor, leaving her family at the age of 15 from a rural village to the nation's capital of Buenos Aires, hoping to pursue a career as an actress and at the age of 25, meeting then-Colonel Juan Peron at a charity event for earthquake victims, the two would marry a year later.

And Juan Peron would become President of Argentina, but as the First Lady, Eva would become powerful within the trad unions, speaking on behalf of labor rights, running the Ministries of Labor and Health, running her own charity and showing that a woman can be come a true leader.  She was championed by the low-income and working class of Argentina and despite her ailing health, she continued to remain strong despite being opposed by Argentina's military and the upperclass.

So, popular Evita was in international pop culture, a 1981 telefilm titled ""The Woman with the Whip"" starring Faye Dunaway was created.  And also a successful musical production titled ""Evita"" by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber would once again pay tribute to Eva Peron.  So, successful that the musical generated over $2 billion in revenue back in 1980.

But since 1978, there was always hope to bring ""Evita"" to the big screen and after a 20-year production delay, in 1996, director and co-writer Alan Parker (""Angela's Ashes"", ""Mississippi Burning"", ""Angel Heart"") and co-writer Oliver Stone (""Platoon"", ""JFK"", ""National Born Killers"") were able to take Evita to the big screen thanks to the casting of Madonna (""Body of Evidence"", ""A League of their Own"", ""Dick Tracy""), Antonio Banderas (""Desperado"", ""The Mask of Zorro"", ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"") and Jonathan Pryce (""Brazil"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films).

""Evita"" is a musical narrated by Che (as portrayed by Antonio Banderas), who tells the story of Eva Duarte (as portrayed by Madonna) from a child of a poor family, leaving her home to become an actress in Buenos Aires, where she would have an affair with Agustin Magaldi (as portrayed by Jimmy Nail) but eventually, through an earthquake benefit, meeting Colonel Juan Peron (as portrayed by Jonathan Pryce) and a year later, marrying him.

The musical would show audiences the rise and power of Juan Peron as he becomes Argentina's President and how the First Lady of Argentina together, would create a new government that would serve the poor.

But through her hard work, Che narrates her sickness and leading to her death.

VIDEO:

""Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1).  When I first watched this film years ago, I noticed how this film looked so beautiful, so grand because of the many people that were featured.  The eloquence of showcasing Eva Peron throughout her life but also amongst the political chaos to the thousands of people who supported her and of course, her husband.  But the cinematography of Darius Khondji (""Se7en"", ""Midnight in Paris"", ""Alien: Resurrection"") is beautiful.

Compared to the original DVD release, the film features much more clarity, much more detail but it is a film that utilizes a lot of earth tones, so colors are warmer than vibrant.  The video is definitely an upgrade from the original DVD and fans of the film will definitely want to upgrade for the improve picture quality.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The film is a musical and with a musical, you expect it to sound incredible via lossless. And as expected, the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber sounds incredible in HD.  While primarily a dialogue and music-driven film through the front channels, I didn't notice the surround channels being used as much but towards the end of the film, I did notice a bit of LFE.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:

  The Making of Evita - (42:13)  A documentary featuring behind-the-scenes making of the film, interviews with the cast, director and knowings the challenges that existed in bringing this musical to the big screen but also the challenges that Madonna and talents had to face as well.  As well as the importance of location, look and costume design.  Very informative feature.
  Music Video - (3:16) Featuring Madonna's ""You Must Love Me"".
  Teaser Trailer - (1:54) A teaser trailer for ""Evita"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

Whenever I hear the song ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"", I think of Madonna singing this song on the balcony, as her character of Eva Peron, knowing that her final days are coming and just wanting to say one last goodbye to the people who have supported her.

""Evita"" is a musical that I enjoyed for its ambition and cinematography.  To shoot in Argentina, to include so many extras to make the political rallying and the funeral of Evita seem real, this was accomplished remarkably well in the film.

Madonna does a fantastic job in playing the main character role of Evita.  From the look and the emotion, Madonna was able to bring sexiness but also an emotional demeanor to her character with efficacy.  And of course, hearing her sing, I absolutely enjoyed her songs.

But not everyone's songs.

Antonio Banderas was fine as the narrator, Che, who in the movie, was close to the Peron's, and as much as I enjoyed Antonio Banderas in ""Desperado"" (and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"") and the ""Zorro"" films, he is more of an action star in my book.  Not as a singer.  And as much as Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice really tried to bring out the machismo of Banderas through music, I wasn't so much of a fan of Banderas' singing vocals for the film then and the same now.

And while Jonathan Pryce is a fine actor, I just didn't feel the chemistry was right between Pryce and Madonna.  So perhaps, the casting never set well with me to begin with.  And watching this film again in 2012, I still feel the same way.

As for the Blu-ray release, while the special features are the same as the DVD release, this film is primarily for the fans who want to watch this film in HD and enjoy the better transfer of this film and hear the music in lossless.

Overall, ""Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition"" is a film that I will forever remember as possibly Madonna's greatest performance in a film.  She embodied and gracefully portrayed the role of Eva Peron with success and because of her involvement, I enjoyed this musical much more.  The cinematography for this film by Darius Khondji is absolutely beautiful and Alan Parker did a great job directing this film, it's just the casting that I felt was off.  But still, I did enjoy this film a lot.

""Evita"" is a fine musical that really showcases the life of Eva Peron in a positive way and it helps to have a film, especially a talent such as Madonna playing the role and doing a great job in her performance.  And while I may not feel the same way about the vocal performance by Banderas and by Pryce (although I enjoyed Pryce a lot more than Banderas), both did a great job with their character role as well.

""Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition"" may not be the greatest musical on film, but it is a memorable film with beautiful music, beautiful cinematography and a wonderful performance by Madonna.  Recommended.",1354147200,7,7641,4.809961685823755

900109,1,6304504039,"Madonna, Antonio Banderas and Alan Parker.

A wretched editing job, horrendous songs and a lackluster screenplay.

Yeah, those last three things outweigh the first.

I really was excited about watching `Evita'.  Not that I'm a giant fan of Madonna's, but my wife swore by the film and it did garner significant awards consideration, so I was intrigued and certainly wanted to check it out for myself.  After the first scene I knew that this was not going to be an easy viewing.  The poorly constructed film barely lets us in to see why Evita was so well loved.  I mean, basically she whored herself into prominence, sang to her people about their unnecessary tears and then died.  There is no depth given to her.  By the films end I knew who she was and how she got there, but I didn't care about it because I was never really told why she did anything.

Madonna sings under hear breath a lot and sells her big moment well enough, but not well enough to validate that Golden Globe she tucked away because of this tragic experience.  Banderas is an embarrassment.  The man can sing and yet he sings almost as dreadfully as Brosnan did in that other ill-advised musical `Mama Mia'.  He also serves as like a narrator of sorts who pops up everywhere to tell us about the political upheaval and Evita's health and what-have-you.  There is some beautiful photography, but overall this is a complete mess.  It says absolutely NOTHING about its subject and dupes the audience into buying into the prospect of Madonna in her element but delivers awkward musical numbers that expose all of her vocal flaws.",1344816000,2,1597,4.6535714285714285

However, there are subtleties of light and shadow and color that just jump off the screen from the Blu-ray version.  The cinematographer also plays with focus depth and this effect is more pronounced in the Blu-ray version.

900112,5,6304504039,"First, let me say, the way this film was dismissed during its original release was a disgrace.  It deserved many Oscar nominations including one for Bandaras and Madonna.  Bandaras stole every scene he was in and Madonna rose to the occasion in a role that is very daunting to play.  The harshest and dumbest comment by critics was ""The longest music video"".  Guess what?  The piece is sung completely.  That is the way it was written and to do it any other way would have been an insult to the original creative team.  Mr. Parker's direction and the screenplay are far superior to the stage version.  The stage version is vacuous and uninvolving and the current version in New York now makes that even more apparant.  Mr. Weber's best work was given the treatment it deserved on screen and the Blu Ray is stunning in sight and sound.",1342569600,4,834,4.581081081081081

900114,5,6304504039,"I was looking forward to this high definition release, so much that I pre-ordered it, and I wasn't disappointed.  It looks GREAT on Blu-Ray!!!  The sound is much better than on DVD, and the picture is very crisp.  They did a great job with this restoration.

It also contains some SPECIAL FEATURES that were not included in the DVD release.  Those features are the following:
--DOCUMENTARY about the making of Evita (includes interviews with Alan Parker, Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, Andrew Lloyd Webber, etc.)
--MUSIC VIDEO of the song ""You Must Love Me"" with Madonna
--TEASER TRAILER

And of course, as with most Blu-Rays or DVD's, it includes optional subtitles in both English and Spanish.

I recently saw the play with Ricky Martin on Broadway, and I realized I like the movie much more than the play.  The original play (as well as the current revived play on Broadway) depicts Evita as a one-dimensional evil social climbing bitch.  Why?  The musical was written by two British men (Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice) who hate Evita.  Britain and Argentina have had conflicts in the past, so it's safe to assume that the story depicted in the play is very biased.

The movie, on the other hand, tries to be more balanced.  Some changes were made in the movie to show a more vulnerable side of Evita.  Yes, the film does use the same biased songs, but in a more balanced way.  For example, it was because of Evita that women got the right to vote in Argentina, and the movie shows this through images, even though the songs don't even mention this fact.

What bothers me most about the musical in general is that Evita is criticized and represented as a bitch and slut for pursuing power, when men who pursue power are not usually criticized.  Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber are obviously sexist for having done this.  What I really appreciate about the movie is that Alan Parker tried to tone down the sexism and present her as an inspirational woman (which she was), in spite of the so-called ""controversies.""

Because the movie goes out of its way to be fair (in spite of the unfair songs), I'm giving the FILM (not the play nor the content of the songs' lyrics) five stars.",1341187200,4,2198,4.647668393782383
900115,5,6304504039,"I finally got the Blu-ray edition of Evita and it is simply superb! I wasn't exactly happy about the sound quality of the DVD edition but now, with even sharper images and brilliant sound, this modern classic gets the treatment it deserves on Blu-ray. Plus, there is a 42-minute movie-in-the-making, the wonderful teaser trailer of the film (I was entranced when I first saw this in theaters 16 years ago) and the video of the Oscar-winninng ""You Must Love Me"" which were not available in the DVD edition.

With the fantastic audio-visuals of this timeless musical, I was so enthralled in watching Evita all over again and Madonna was simply brilliant in her final balcony scene and death scene that she succeeded in moving me to tears once again much like when I first saw this film on the wide screen. Making ""Evita"" was one of the best decisions Madonna ever made in her movie career since playing Eva Peron was truly the role of a lifetime. It is, therefore, an injustice that she was not even nominated for an Oscar and the film and director too. She deserved the Oscar that year! Nevertheless, Madonna's Golden Globe win as Best Actress was really much deserved and getting to play Evita (with so many acting and music highlights plus 90 beautiful costume changes) was already a reward in itself. Evita also won the Golden Globe for Best Picture and Best Song and was one of the year's Ten Best Films of the National Board of Review in 1996. Those awards were real affirmations of the film's excellence.

For all lovers of musicals, please add Evita on Blu-ray in your list of must-haves. Madonna fans should be proud that Evita finally got the treatment it deserves on Blu-ray after 16 long years! Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce also deserve special mention for also showing their best as Che and Juan Peron respectively. They were both brilliant in their roles.

900202,5,6304504039,"As a fan of stage musicals, I generally consider Broadway and West End (London) actors to be the best vocalists going.  I generally lament Webber's Really Useful Films' choice of lead actors for their films, wishing they would draw top vocalists over charming and attractive actors less vocally skilled.  In this case, however, Madonna was the perfect Evita.  Elaine Page might be a slightly better vocalist, but she was simply too old to star in this film, in which Madonna reminds us that it wasn't just her pranks and hairstyles that kept her at the top for so long.  She is an outstanding vocalist.  She fits this role beautifully in every way.  I found Banderas' voice a little gravely at first, but once you accept that, you realize that it's a fine style, and his acting adds edge and drama.  Some of the songs were re-worked for the better, particularly ""Oh, What a Circus""; the Spanish guitar works much better than the more traditional, non-distinct, and un-Latin versions of earlier recordings.

I found the visuals stunning.  As a kid I hated Rogers and Hammerstein scenes in which the entire town breaks out in song.  In Evita's Argentina the masses singing, dancing, and marching through the streets serves a vital role, and the massive scale made possible by moving the production off stage only adds to its power.  Perhaps I've just grown up, or maybe Really Useful Films makes the 1,000 person street choir look more believable.  Either way, it works--all of it.",1326672000,6,1479,4.825396825396825

saw this in the theater. loved it.  'buenos aires' is fantastic, the waltz scene is gorgeous, and the addition of 'you must love me' to the film version was timed perfectly.

so - why does the dvd have no special features?  i wish i'd have known this -there must be another version out there that talks about the making of it and all that great stuff???

I am a fan of Salma Hayek and she did a great job in Frida as well, though the movie is not quite as strong as Evita.  Two women, unique individuals, unabashedly following their own destiny with stories that both enlighten and entertain.  Artistically, Evita is the strongest, with the music and storytelling hitting a very smooth pace.  Intellectually and historically, though, Frida is my favorite. A woman who survived, loved and suffered for it, created and inspired. She did not simply follow, but would if she chose too. She led her own life, one that was neither easy nor conventional.  Of the two, Frida is one of my favorite women while Evita was interesting, but without the redeeming qualities of art and passion.",1321747200,,795,4.609929078014185

900208,2,6304504039,"I was so excited to see this movie when I heard that it was going to be released in 1996.  I was in the sixth grade and I loved Madonna, so anything with her in it was going to get my attention.  I had never heard of Eva Peron the person and I had certainly never heard of Evita the musical at the time I found out about the movie, but I quickly learned about Eva Peron through various documentaries about her that came out around the time the movie was released.  A&E did a documentary about her as part of their ""Biography"" series and I believe Lifetime did another documentary about her as part of their ""Intimate Portrait"" series.  I watched them both, then purchased Fraser and Navarro's biography and quickly became fascinated with the story of the dirt poor, illegitimate girl who rose to fame as an actress, married a rising colonel, became First Lady, went on to become a fanatical champion of the poor and of her husband's regime, dressed really, really well, then died tragically of cancer at 33, after which her husband had her body embalmed so it would last for eternity.  What's not to love?  The story's better than fiction.  Then I saw this movie and I was so disappointed!  I watched it again recently on DVD thinking I might have a different opinion of it and I didn't.  While the songs from the musical were great and I bought the soundtrack, I thought there was so much more to Evita's story than what could be told accurately in musical form (there are some things you just can't communicate in a song, you actually need to speak).  While I realize that the Broadway musical was performed with no dialogue, I just didn't feel that idea carried over very well onto film.  On film the whole thing came across like a really long music video starring Madonna and I found myself getting bored very quickly.  I thought that Madonna, who I love, was too old for the part (especially in the younger Evita scenes before she bleaches her hair blonde).  I thought (and still think) that instead of trying to re-create the musical as a film, they should have made a real movie (with dialogue) about Evita, like movies have been made about other historical figures.",1319155200,,2173,4.5268542199488495

900245,3,6304504039,"One would not usually think of a movie musical as being troubling and difficult to watch, but this one was exactly that for me.

The movie Evita affected me at two distinct levels, one as the hit musical, and two as a commentary on life and politics; first the easy one, Evita as a hit musical.

The music of Andrew Lloyd Webber provides the foundation for this work; his music is so distinctive that it immediately identifies the work as his. Webber's music is powerful and intense; the pace hardly ever slackens as the story unfolds about this young woman who was born in very humble surroundings but is driven to make something of herself.

The title role is played by Madonna who turns in a powerful performance of this driven woman. Using every means at her disposal the Evita character pushes herself into a place of influence in Argentina.

Fans of either Madonna or Andrew Lloyd Webber will find this a treasure trove of musical gems; Madonna was a good choice in the role as her appearance and bearing seem to support the Evita character being portrayed.

The second level is more involved and troubling; we see two people, Juan and Eva, who desire power using demagoguery to effectively influence political events. What is even more troubling is the ease with which large groups of people were emotionally swayed to support these desires; we see the weaknesses of the democratic process being exploited to establish control.

Peron's partnership with Eva produced a potent force which finally placed them in the top positions of power in Argentina. Their demagoguery kept them there longer than might have been expected. Their policy of promising everything to everybody but actually benefitting only a chosen few was clever enough to deceive enough of the people to maintain their positions of leadership.

All of this is history, but the disturbing thing is the parallels one sees today in the United States. These parallels made the movie troubling and difficult for me to watch. It may be as Hegel is quoted saying: ""What experience and history teach is this--that people and governments never have learned anything from history, or acted on principles deduced from it.""",1297987200,3,2184,4.902439024390244

Not only the vision, but the audio also suffers from extremely poor dynamics and sounds flat. Strangely the CD Soundtracks of the movie are fine?

This movie is greatly underrated and under-recognized as a work of cinematic art.  It's really strange that it hasn't been remastered onto Blu-Ray, but the DVD version is excellent quality.

The people voting for the Golden Globes sure thought she was worthy and deserving of certain honors being bestowed upon her as well.

This was a role that Madonna was born to play.  But, while that may be true in many respects, doesn't translate into her then automatically having it then come to fruition.

900366,4,6304504039,"'Evita' is a brilliant film adaptation of the Broadway musical, written and composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. It tells the story of Argentina's First Lady Eva Duarte de Peron, also known as Evita. Evita was born into severe circumstances. Her father died when she was a little girl and her family (who was considered illegitimate since her father and mother never married) endured poverty and alienation. But all of this struggle lit a fierce fire in her belly, and she struck out on her own as a teenager in search of fame and fortune. This journey took her from radio star and film actress to the First Lady of Argentina. During her prime, she received both incredible admiration from the masses and criticism from the establishment. When she died at age 33 from cancer, she left behind a legacy that still haunts Argentina to this day.

The film features both amazing music and acting. There is wall-to-wall singing and very little spoken dialogue, but I didn't care since I have a deep love for music. However, people who don't care for musicals would obviously be advised to stay away. Antonio Banderas does a great job as the film's narrator Che. He displays great emotional intensity and adds an authentic Latin flavor to the role. And who knew he could sing that well? Jonathan Pryce is an appropriate Juan Peron: charismatic in his own way, but passive enough to stand back in awe of his powerful wife at times.

But the star of the show is clearly Madonna. She put her heart and soul into this role and, given her previously bad films, I was impressed. She clearly feels a connection to Evita, and both women have many similarities. They both lost one of their parents at a very young age, they both possess boundless ambition and strong will, they both received great adulation and scrutiny, etc, etc. I'm sure this was a big reason why the part fit Madonna like a glove. Also, Madonna is reportedly responsible for making Eva more dimensional, and therefore more realistic, than the stage version. Tim Rice wrote the musical with Mary Main's slanderous biography, The Woman With The Whip, as a main inspiration. Therefore, Eva was mainly portrayed as a ruthless power hungry tyrant in the play. Eva could be manipulative and domineering at times, but there was also a softer, warmer side to her that the movie version managed to show.

Besides her acting, Madonna's vocal range and quality also improved, compared to her earlier days as a ""raw talent"". Many complained that Madonna, a pop singer, didn't have the chops to tackle the role that Broadway singers Patti LuPone and Elaine Page played. Well, their voices have different objectives. Its all about context. Broadway singers are allowed to fill up the huge theaters with their huge voices. However, an operatic style would have been too overbearing for a film. A capable pop singer, with a less harsh and simpler style of singing, is much more appropriate for a movie. Plus, all of her experience as a music performer gave her the training to portray emotions convincingly through song. She manages to be alternately passionate (""A New Argentina"", ""Waltz for Che and Eva""), self-confident (""Rainbow High"", ""Buenos Aires"") and vulnerable (""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"", ""You Must Love Me"").

If you're a fan of Madonna, musicals, or want to learn about a fascinating historical figure, then buy this film. You'll love it.",1239408000,,3407,4.848797250859106

900480,5,6304504039,"This masterpiece of film-making needs re-evaluation since in hindsight it can be seen for the superb and masterful work of art and entertainment that it is. I have now seen the film three times and each time I am amazed that this film has not been recognized widely for its considerable attributes.

How does a director convey the oppressive nature of Fascism in a musical? Alan Parker succeeds wonderfully through his use of a muted brown, beige, black, and vanilla color range. He does it through the wonderful photography of riots, poverty, wealth, militarism, and the signs and symbols of power. The cinematography in this film is great. The art direction is super. The editing is perfect. It is a mystery to me why this film wasn't more appreciated by the public.

I think one reason is that folks don't know history and understand the rise of fascism in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Argentina in the 1930s and 1940s. Peron's brand of fascism was threatening to the oligarchy in Argentina that had ruled a nation of farmers and cowboys and peasants. Thus there is no clear picture of good guys and bad guys in the film. At times Eva's appeals to the poor and underserved, the establishment of her foundation, and her ability to communicate with the masses puts her in the role of saint. However, the extortion of the rich to pay for her charities and thus maintain the popularity of Peron is a shrewed political power play.

Madonna is super in this film. Her acting is not naturalistic because she is playing an over-the-top diva and saint. It is Antonio Banderas who gives us a running commentary thorughout the film that continually grounds the viewer in the facts and the actions in this opera.

One last comment: there are very few songs that have the power of Webber and Rice's Don't Cry for Me Argentina. Madonna's performance is spotless when she sings this from her balcony to the crowd below.",1176508800,15,1905,4.728915662650603

A peasant girl who used her charms and elegance as an aspiring entertainer and rises to become the wife of Argentina's most powerful politician is sequentially presented with song and dance that only a masterful musical producer such as Weber could create.

The score is surprisingly good - just as well, since the movie is a virtual rock opera - and Antonio Banderas is a commanding and convincing enough musical presence to make you wonder what the Hell Andrew Lloyd Webber was thinking of dropping him from The Phantom of the Opera for the plank-like, flat-voiced but presumably much cheaper Gerard Butler. Madonna brings the required ruthless iconic status although her voice isn't always up to the demands of the part (she is especially flat when hitting the low notes and her rendition of Don't Cry For Me, Argentina lacks real power) and she's not much good at doing the tango, while the addition of a new song drags out the ending more than is necessary, but it's still the best movie musical in decades.

Many of the lyrics have been changed or sanitized, perhaps to satisfy the censors in Argentina so the film could be shot there.  The complete elimination of Peron's last mistress before Evita, and the transfer of her agonized lament ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"" to Madonna, was a poor decision and changes the whole concept of that song.

Maybe because I was too young then, but when I watched it again when I was twelve or thirteen, I felt that it was a very good movie. Though I don't like it as much as The Phantom of The Opera, but Webber's composition stood captivated me in Evita. The soundtrack is the combination of Rock, Opera, and Jazz. I could say that this is the modern composition for the movie. When I watched Evita in 2004-2005, I even cried when Madonna sang the song called ""You must love me"". And this song had become my favourite track from the soundtrack album, and also, it has become my favourite scene from the movie. IF... you give your attention to this movie, I'm quite sure that you're going to know something more from one woman's heart.

900611,5,6304504039,"Worth noting that Evita is wall-to-wall music with virtually no spoken lines: not an opera so much as an extended music video, so the pop-music motifs need not be an anachronism.

I'm not a fan of Madonna, I find Andrew Lloyd Webber's music a bit obvious .. and yet -- and yet. Here everything seems to come together. It's a visually gorgeous film, the added songs (The Lady's Got Potential, You Must Love Me) are strong enhancements. The Che character's change from Che Guevara in the stage version to an Argentine Everyman here (desk clerk, bartender, cabinet minister, union activist) is an improvement over the stage musical and Antonio Banderas is a smoldering presence who carries the movie. Jimmy Nail is perfect as the oily tango singer; Jonathan Pryce capable in an equally slick role as the would-be, but hesitant, dictator. The montage songs are splendid, like Goodnight and Thank You, that bucket-brigade sequence of Eva's lovers that she uses (and the film uses) to get her from the street to the Casa Rosada, or like A New Argentina, in which Eva takes Juan from jail to the presidency. The faux-English country house lawn where Eva faces down upper-class disdain (Peron's Latest Flame, The Actress Hasn't Learned the Lines You Like to Hear) is another brilliant staging. It all rings true, visually.

I've had others tell me the lyrics seemed shallow. ""Don't cry for me, Argentina, and don't forget to get milk and bread at the store ... "" Well, yes. That's the point. She didn't say much more than that. Banality often suffices in public life; politics are shtick in a media age; actors can leverage elections. The lady couldn't act but she could, as others have said, seduce a nation. She won't be the last actor to do so.

Recommend owning the DVD for the cinematic values at the very least. It's a dark vision of public affairs but the times probably affirm it. And it was the best role of Eva's lifetime. And Madonna's.",1144540800,59,1939,4.747774480712166

900614,5,6304504039,"Well, most of what is to say about this movie has already been said. Madonna does shine in this movie (in fact I would argue that theatre is much more her strong suit than music alone). You can tell that she went to school to perform in the arts more so here then in anything else I have seen her in, as the dancing, movement, and passion by which she presents Eva Peron is quite moving.

I think its important to keep in mind when comparing this movie, it is more relevant to compare it to other works by Tim Rice/Andrew Lloyd Webber then it is to reality. This play was written back in the mid to late 70's, about 20 years after her death. It was not like today where you could simply Google a plethora of information on someone...so what is present in the play is knowledge based more on folklore and media present at that time than it is on fact (not to mention the overthrow and exile of the Peron regime itself from Argentina until the early 70's). This also beacons the question of can we truly know the full truth about those who are idolized in such a way as Eva Peron is.

 There are some very clever present in the play-on-words in this movie, as is in all Andrew Lloyd Webber plays (the reference to Buenos Aires as ""BA, Big Apple"", as both New York and Argentina have a Broadway district, both having around the same population and art/dance focus). Also, the only reference to what actually killed Eva Peron is mentioned in only 1 line in the play (this is because at the time, only people very close to her knew what was happening, as the rest of Argentina could only see her getting physically weaker). In the movie, it shows a lot of the lower class people working in slaughter houses, as at the time Argentina was the world leader in beef exportation, as Europe was still war torn and was importing a large amount of it beef (this is what really had a lot to do with the political changes at the time, as the economy for Argentina as a result was booming). All of these little nuances are what make Andrew Lloyd Webber movies so loved and timeless (and some would argue overly so).

So while its true that you won't get scads of historical knowledge out of watching this movie, you will get a general idea of the political and social structure of Argentina during this time period.  More importantly, it gives you a glimpse into how social climbing was not so easy, especially for women in those days. It's all about how 1 woman in just the few years she was in power shaped the political and social playing field for years to come. The music in this movie is incredible (and will get stuck in your head).

If your truly interested in finding out more on the life (and death) of Eva Peron, I recommend some of the more popular books on her life (Amazon has several), as well as ""Santa Evita"", which loosely chronicles the very bizarre escapades of her body after she died. A must see for play lovers.",1142467200,3,2918,4.354779411764706

I thought that Antonio Banderas is just a good ""action"" actor... Yet with all due credits - I did not expect this... Personally, I ""had a crash"" on this movie...

Together, they made an Epic, a classic work going far beyond a specific (however important) page in Argentinian history, straight into the heart of someone born (like me) far away from this country. The scene, the script / lyrics, the music, the acting and voices of Madonna and Banderas - are really admirable. And together, they make you feel - wherever you are born & live - this story is (or at least may become) about YOUR OWN country, your own nation and people, your own love for it, your own part  in the Century XXth...

900617,4,6304504039,"Up until recently, the only songs I knew from ""Evita"" were ""Don't Cry For Me, Argentina"" and ""Another Suitcase In Another Hall"", which I heard on the Sarah Brightman CD. When ""Evita"" came to Tampa on Broadway, my 9-year-old sister was asked to play one of the children in the production, and so I had the opportunity to see it. Since this was really the only time I had ever heard music from ""Evita"", I really enjoyed the woman who played Eva Peron, who had somewhat of a ""higher"" voice than Patti LuPone. We bought the original broadway cast album at the show and I didn't really enjoy it as much. Patti LuPone is NOT a good singer in my opinion. While Eva's part may have been written for that kind of voice, I don't enjoy it probably because I already loved the performance I heard.

Well my parents saw this film when it first came out, and both said that they fell asleep during it. But since I enjoyed the Broadway show so much, I bought it and I am so glad I did. Some songs have been transposed to better fit Madonna's strong but limited vocals, and I must say that she does a good job performing the songs in this film. Yes, it's true, she isn't anything like Patti LuPone, but for someone who is not accustomed to LuPone's harsh and riduclous vocals, you'll enjoy Madonna's performance a lot.

All of the music in ""Evita"" is beautifully written and peformed save a few songs that are too ""rock"" for my tastes. The costumes are great, the production is great, everything is just surprisingly good. There is no dialogue in the film, but there isn't any in the Broadway play either, so this didn't bother me. The film seems SO long without that 15 minute intermission, and after ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"", you're wanting Eva to just die so it'll all be over. But it's still a really enjoyable movie; I just recommend taking a break in the middle.

Antonio Banderas performed well except on a few occasions where his Latino accent gets in the way of this obviously American-written musical. Jonathan Pryce's performance is a joke. He can't act, he can't sing, and it is quite obvious he's lypsynching through the whole film. Jimmy Nail had great vocals but wasn't young enough to play the suave and handsome Agustin Magaldi.

Some of the changes between the Broadway production and film are quite annoying, but if you haven't ever seen the Broadway version then this won't be an issue; Peron's mitress originally performed ""Another Suitcase In Another Hall"", but the song was sung by Eva in the film. Also, in the opening scenes where Madonna is playing a 15-year-old, they should have given her some heavy duty makeup. She was 38 years old here, but she looks even older.

Overall, not comparing to the Broadway performance at all, I give this film 4 out of 5 stars because of Jonathan Pryce's performance and the ""rock"" songs.

As a side note, the DVD is pathetic. There isn't any Special Features except Chapter Search, English captions and Spanish subtitles. There is a widescreen DVD available, which is the version I have.",1135382400,4,3037,4.594095940959409
900618,5,6304504039,"Evita started as a concept album.  Then Harold Prince staged the album in London with album star Elaine Paige. Evita premiered on Broadway in 1979 with Patti LuPone.  This made overnight stars of not only Paige and LuPone and Mandy Patinkin but Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Since then it has become a Hollywood Jonah.  Everyone from Barbra Streisand to Bette Middler to Meryl Streep have been cast in (or mentioned for) the lead and as many top line directors including Oliver Stone have been attached.  Disney finally bought the rights for Maddona and the film died.  A decade passed and finally everything falls in place including Maddona.  I am not a big fan of Maddona but she can sing, she is Latino and she is not too old to play Eva Peron.

This film came together with near perfection.  The film went back to the concept album.  The only major changes were Eva now sings the best song in the score ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"" and for continuity some of Che's songs were assigned to others (in the musical Che performed many minor characters.

Madonna was brilliant as Eva but the find was Antonio Banderas as Che.  No one knew that he could sing!  The only miscasting is Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron but this is a minor flaw.

For most of the 80's and 90's, musicals have been disasters.  The main reason is directors chosen have no musical experience (John Huston did Annie and Richard Attenborough did A Chorus Line).  For Evita, Alan Parker was chosen.  Parker scored a triumph for the musical Fame in 1980.  Parker's choices were perfection, this is a crisp and clean film.  The film could have been overly sentimental or cloying but Parker chose the straight path, tell the story and let the emotion evolve from the story.

If you liked the musical, you will love the movie.  If you don't hate Madonna, you'll love the movie.  If you like great film making, you'll love the movie.

900619,4,6304504039,"When Evita originally came out, it was considered a mild disappointment. It was pretty successful, got mixed to favorable reviews, and won some awards, but it had so much Oscar hype before its release that its lack of major nominations caused it to be seen as a bit of a failure. This is unfortunate, because it's actually a much better movie than most pictures that win the big awards. The acting is generally excellent, particularly from Madonna. It's beautifully photographed. The music is usually very well done, with great singing (there are points where Madonna's fantastic singing will make you wonder why she never seems to pull that level of vocals off on her albums). Some people complain that the singing isn't as opera-oriented than the original show, but given the mainstream audience this was clearly an intentional decision.

The movie has its faults. The main, overwhelming problem with this movie is its loyalty to the original play. Don't listen to purists who claim this movie strayed from the original. The fact is that they kept this virtually all-musical, something that doesn't work nearly as well on screen as it would on stage. The main problem with this decision was that the story has a great deal of political and historical content, and the songs that are supposed to give you this background don't do a very good job of giving you an understanding of the history. Three almost unlistenable songs--Peron's Latest Flame, Rainbow Tour, And the Money Kept Rolling In--try to give you this background in the context of overbearing musical-theatre-rock. The style of those songs and the flashiness of the editing, not to mention Antonio Banderas's sometimes indecipherable accent, keep any of this important historical information from being understood by the vast majority of the audience. You see flashy clips of riots, people being beaten (by police? be rebels? who knows?), and politicians yelling at each other (about what?), with nothing but Andrew Lloyd Weber's trashy theatre-""rock"" to explain--or not really explain--what's happening. People who dislike this movie, I suspect, are largely thinking back to this part of the movie. All they had to do to eliminate most of the problems people have with this movie would be to take out the weak songs, add some real, non-musical scenes that give comprehensible historical background, and only keep the really good songs.

This could have been a great movie. You get a real sense of Eva Peron as a person, and the story is moving at times. Madonna is great and should have been nominated for an Oscar. Many of the songs are excellent. It's also worth praising for its photography alone. It's a shame they didn't do anything to mend such glaring, relatively easily fixable flaws, because it could have been far more successful.",1133049600,3,2804,5.015021459227468

There is no one that could have played Eva Peron the way that Madonna did. She completely captured the character, and was wonderful in the movie. Madonna won the Golden Globe for this movie, and it was deserved!

There are so many beautiful scenes in this movie, so I cannot pick just one, but I recommend this movie to anyone that likes Madonna, is interested in South American history (keep in mind this is a musical though-but I think it gives a great portrayal of Eva Peron), or to any movie buff (or musical fan)!",1132963200,2,689,4.3

Madonna gives her best performance on film ever, but still manages to miss the mark. I enjoy Madonna, but just felt that she was not feminine enough, not pretty enough and was unable to sing strongly enough. I was never convinced it was Evita on the screen, always Madonna. I personally felt that all Madonna's years in the gym worked against her, as I was unable to ever see the fragility and vulnerability that Evita fought, and eventually succumbed to, all her life. I also think Madonna has a fine voice for pop music but fell short of her requirement in this role, too many times I awaited a high point or crescendo, and was left with a flat note or weak attempt. Although she did sound great on some of the less challenging numbers.

Jonathon Pryce, who plays Peron, seemed uncomfortable in his role. I found myself wondering if he was trying to not overshadow his co-star. Unfortunately this left his performance flat and wooden, and nowhere near the level of expertise we have come to expect from him.

As for Antonio Banderas, WOW. He stole the show, he is electric, passionate, humorous and who knew he could sing. He actually shows up Madonna when it comes to the singing, a rather sad statement, but true.

All in all, the movie is well worth viewing, and I do not regret buying the DVD. With the stunning backdrop, lavish sets, catchy songs and Antonio's bravura performance, I am sure I will relish this movie many times over. It's just so hard not to wonder what could have been.",1131408000,3,1730,4.535256410256411

900724,3,6304504039,"Madonna surprised me. She worked. She had some obvious weaker spots, but she was bearable.

SONGS MADONNA SCREWED UP ON AND WHY:

Buenos Aires- She should have belted some parts instead singly softly (also this whole song just did not work.)

A New Agrentina- Madonna's worst number without a doubt. I despised this song. It just did not work. The high and amazing notes were brought down for Madonna- it brought the whole song down. I also disliked Jonathan Pryce (get to him later) on this song.

High Flying Adored- I have never liked Eva's part in this song. I think it should be Che's solo, but Madonna did not make it any better for me. Her voice sounded extra weak and very strained.

Hello and Goodbye- It just sounded weird and she didn't have enough.. hmm what's the word?... Patti in her!

Antonio Banderas wins the award for BEST PERFORMANCE IN EVITA THE FILM! He was amazing. I very upset that his hcaracter was so small. They should have enlarged it instead of making it smaller. He did so well. His ""High Flying Adores"" was breathtaking. He also nailed ""Oh, What a Circus"", ""Lady's Got Potential"", and every other song he is in. I liked his character alot more here than in the play. Che was more likeable. In this movie, I began to think that Antonio Banderas was playing a guy named Che not Che Guevara. That works so much better. This character should be, on stage, just the voice in the back of everyone's mind. I loved the way Che was repseented in the movie.

Joanthan Pryce's performance was the reason this movie recieved a 3 instead of 4. He ruined ""She is a Diamond"". He just didn't work in his role. His voice isn't very strong, and Peron really does need a strong voice when your Evita lacks a little in the upper range depratment.

The guy who played Magaldi was okay. He didn't sound very good the first time her say ""On This night of a Thousand Stars"", but his repirse was fabulous. Also the ""Eva Beware of the City"" scence seemed so awkward beause of his singing.

I loved Eva singing ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"". I thought it fit her character perfectly. Although the whole thing with Magaldi walking into the apartment and having a family (I guess) was very confusing. I also loved how this song kind of became Eva's anthem. She reprised it many times and every time it conveyed a similar emotion which really worked.

MY PROBLEMS WITH THE MOVIE:

Madonna's hair in the beginning- She looked way too old, but if her hair were longer she would have looked much much younger.

The song ""A New Argentina""- I hated how it was chopped up. (other reasons explained above)

The song ""Buenos Aires""- They should have made it vibrant and colorful, not dingy!

This movie, although it had its share of problems. The one thing I was most happy about is that I like Eva at the end of the movie. I also like how Peron stuck by Evita, and I liked the new twist on Che and him just showing up and playing different characters. That was so awesome. I really liked this movie- I was bored at times- but then a great song came and I was happy again. I reccomend this movie to anyone.

And I must admit: IT IS BETTER THAN THE PLAY (except for Madonna- Pati was better.... but Madonna comes in second!)

Madonna is perfect in the role, and bears a very strong resemblence to the true Evita of history -- delicate, beautiful, and immensely popular. Her voice is superb and her acting flawless.  Banderas is irresistible as always, and everyone else does a fantastic job.  Webber's music is genius, of course, and when we have it combined with brilliant editing and a thrilling cinematic pace, the effect is hynotic and very simply gorgeous.  We get the mystery of the historical figures, the seductive nature of power and fame, and the horror of death all majestically and magically interwoven to make great and original film.

900726,5,6304504039,"First, I declare my bias: I loved  the stage musical.  I saw it early on in its London run, and made sure I had a ticket for its final night in London.  And I've seen too many movie versions of stage musicals that are just dreadful.  So I had low, low expectations for this.
But it is WONDERFUL.  Not only was Madonna great, the resonances between her life and Eva's rise to fame gave an added frisson to her performance.  Banderas can sing and dance a storm, and the tango sequences are enough to convince anyone to join a dance class.  And there was at least some attention drawn to the repressive nature of the Peronistas, which wasn't - or couldn't be - done on stage.
Anything bad?  Sure.  The dreadful reallocation of 'Another Suitcase' to Eva rather than to Peron's mistress.  But I can forgive this in light of the sublime 'You Must Love Me', new for the movie, and a wonderfully double-edged lyric masterpiece.

900727,5,6304504039,"First of all ... I think people that take the time to type up movie reviews forget what they're typing about, exactly.  Everybody says that Eva Peron lived a shallow-hallow life.  Okay, that's fine ... but then why discredit the movie for depicting this exact situation?  During the movie we, as viewers, are ""emotionally distanced"" from Madonna as Evita, but ... in real life that's exactly how her subjects felt, too, right?  So how does the movie ""fail"" on that account?

And as far as Madonna goes ... this was pretty much the first (and last) time I ever saw her ""acting"" in every sense of the word.  She was, by far, quite convincing.  Way to go on that Golden Globe win!

But I do understand the tediousness of sitting through two-plus hours of complete and utter singing and emoting.  There was simply NO downtime at all ANYWHERE during the course of the movie.  It works best watching it at home on television ... at least then you can pause and start and pause and start at will.

900804,4,6304504039,"Evita is one of my all-time favorite Broadway shows. The movie is really good, but there are a few problems with it.....

First, it would've been so much better if the original Broadway cast (Patti LuPone and Mandy Patikin) got to play the two main roles (Eva and Che). But, Madonna and Antonio do a fairly good job.

Second, Madonna's voice. It's not that she doesn't have a nice voice because she does. It's just that her voice doesn't fit the character of Eva peron. Again, this problem could've been solved by casting Patti LuPone.

Third, this is my BIGGEST problem with this movie- I don't like the changes they made from the original play. Others movies have been changed and it worked out fine, but this one........is another story. I do like the new song they put it- the kind of rockish one that tells about the problems with the country. However, every other change they make, gives the wrong impression of Eva Peron. The movie makes her out to be a whole lot nicer than she really was. I just don't like this portrayl of Eva Peron because it's not who she was. I also don't like how they portrayed her husband, Juan Peron. The movie made him seem like a straight, grown-up man while in real life, he was actual very childish and immature.

All in all, I love this movie and can watch it over and over again. But whenever someone watches it with me, I always have to point out ""Well, Eva wasn't really like that, that's just how they made it in the movie.""",1120262400,5,1467,4.4222222222222225

900806,3,6304504039,"First off, I'm a huge Madonna fan. I loved her music for over 20 years, but her acting is another story. I agree with most people that didn't like the movie at all. Madonna is not a good actress, but also she doesn't have the vocals to pull this movie off. It's not all bad. In many songs she sounds very good but it does seem strained at times and uncomfortable. No doubt her vocals have improved due to her singing lessons for this film, which is evident in her later albums.

The movie as a whole is very MTV. It's chopped up in way to get tour attention and distracting from a weak script. I didn't come away really knowing Evita as a person. The movie is completely sung which is a little irritating. If it was done the way most musicals are done then I think there would have been better character development. Let's blame the director for that.

The DVD itself is bare. It should have the actors at the premiere, Madonna's speech for her Golden Globe (which by the way was very moving). If only she can incorporate those kind of emotions to her acting then she would be on to something. The picture and sound are beautiful and Madonna does look amazing. If you don't care for Madonna, don't subject yourself to this movie. If you are a Madonna fan, skip to the more enjoyable songs. There are some good songs and Madonna does some of those songs well.",1114992000,,1358,4.34251968503937
900807,5,6304504039,"This is not the film for someone who detests musicals.  It is what's known as a rock opera with very little dialogue in the entire plot (and most of the dialogue is speeches made by Eva or Juan).  Also, as a first time viewer, one may get somewhat confused over what exactly is going on, such as the scene where Eva is asking Magaldi to take her to Buenos Aires.  However as one watches it a second or third time they begin to pick up personality traits of Eva and even more details of her story.

Antonio Banderas' performance as Che Guervare was magnificant though upstaged by Madonna the majority of the time, prevelant in the scene ""Waltz for Eva and Che"" and in ""Goodnight and Thank You""  The other principle vocalists were great such as Jimmy Nail (Augustin Magaldi) and Johnathan Pryce (Peron).  The differential in voices for each of this characters makes the viewer want to listen and get lost in what they're saying.

Madonna, managed to be serious in her role, which is different from the roles that she usually plays.  She looked decent in costumes, compared to what she usually wears, and had the diva attitude that made Evita jump off the screen and into the homes of the viewers.  There is a slight irony that comes from Madonna playing Eva in that Eva was a love/hate persona much like Madonna of the current generation.

Everytime the DVD is watch there is more to be gained.  (Oh and if you study Spanish you can pick up vocabulary by putting the Spanish subtitles on.) It never gets old.",1111017600,13,1506,4.520295202952029

I had mixed feelings on Madonna playing the role, but those feelings were soothed.  She is perfect as Eva Peron.  She has so much passion for the role!  This is the part she was born to play.  Antonio Banderas can sing--who knew?  He is perfect as Che, Eva's opposition.  And can he carry a tune!  Listen to him especially during 'High Flying Adored.'  Wow!!  And let's not forget the legendary Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron.  He, like Madonna, has so much passion for the role.  Would you expect anything else from The Engineer from 'Miss Saigon'?  Make sure you pay attention to 'You Must Love Me,' the song that won the Oscar.

Lloyd Webber gives us one of the best productions I have ever seen.  And although 'Cats' is my favorite musical of all time, 'Evita' is my favorite movie.

Not only is the continuity vulgarized, the director often manages to confuse the film viewer as to what exactly is going on. This is not a great film, not even a good one, what carries it are the production values, songs, and locations.

After getting through the extremely boring commencement of the picture, I noticed that there would be no dialogue in this picture at all, at every moment someone was singing a silly and repetitive song. This isn't bad in its whole, but when everyone is already confused about the character it becomes extremely agitating. The voice dubs of the songs are so apparent that the film seems contrived and indifferent to its tackiness. Here we have people that are supposed to be singing and yet the contorted sound room song is playing and they are merely mouthing their parts. Banderas is terrible in his singing abilities yet his presence is well recommended. In this role he plays the conscience of the working class, a ""Che Guevera"" type revolutionary whom witnesses Eva's ascension and ultimate fall.

Madonna is wonderful in this role, not only can she move around the screen in charismatic beauty but her songs are capable and worthy. The sets are absolutely gorgeous and the costumes are fabulous. What we get in the end is a romanticized MTV style video but it is dreadfully long at 2 1/2 hours. I couldn't wait til the termination.

900810,5,6304504039,"I just purchased this DVD and I remembered instantly why I enjoyed this film so much when it came out.  I would just like to answer some of the critiques listed here.

1)  The character of Ch was always meant to be a nemesis to Evita, but not the real character as such . In the stage production that I saw, it was a man with the typical beret and machine gun singing to the side of the action.  It would have been ridiculous and historically inaccurate to portray Ch as such in the movie version.  Ch Guevara was still a medical student when Eva died.  I think it is very effective to blend Ch into various characters because it represents the silent and not so silent opposition to the Pern Revolution.  The only time the two characters meet for real interaction is when Evita is having delusions.  The song argued in that moment perfectly clashes Ch's ""idealism"" with Evita's ""realism.""  Ch is always there in some form, yet Evita is oblivious to his presence, brushes him off with a quick lyric or purposely chooses to ignore him.  This adds a metaphysical dimension to the plot as if Evita were increasingly self-justifying her growing power as a simple tool to help the impoverished.

2)  The soundtrack to the movie is not an operatic stage version but the songs are presented using the operatic techniques of repetition.  This was done on purpose, not due to a lack of creativity.

3)  When I saw this off off broadway, the people that were with me were straining to understand the singing beside the fact that they had no idea about the history of post WWII Argentina.  I don't think they enjoyed it as much as they wanted to let on.

4)  Madonna sings very well and is completely understood.  I had the argument with some friends that heard the soundtrack and thought she was singing off key on the last couple of tracks...  Ummm.  Not really.  She was about ready to pass away in those scenes which in the movie are close-ups.  It would have been ridiculous to have anyone belt out the lyrics in such an intimate moment before passing on.  It sounds like she is dying, because she is...

5)  The cinematography is simply amazing.  The funeral scene at the very beginning was incredible as well as the scene where Eva puts her foundation to work.  Pictures of the real Evita meeting the Pope and others perfectly match the costumes used in the movie.

6)  For me, the main focus of the movie is the strategy of propaganda and how it can dominate reason.  The mystery lies in how much of the persuasion was authentically from the heart of the Perns and how much of it was naked manipulation.  The movie captures both aspects and yet leaves them unanswered...Much like the historical analysis of Eva Pern.

(I fail to understand why the people of Argentina didn't like the choice of Madonna as their favorite first lady...she seems to fit the role perfectly).  The one pleasant surprise of the movie was how wonderful Antonio Banderas was.  I never knew he could sing as good as he looks!  Give him his own musical.

Madonna did an amazing job as Eva Duarte de Peron. She had her powerful moments when she showed great strength, but her moments of vulnerability and weakness too. Her singing was great, thought some say it wasn't powerful enough. Ok, singing novices let me tell you something. You don't belt ballads. ""You Must Love Me"", ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"", and ""Another Suitcase In Another Hall"" were supposed to be softer. She did not have a weak voice, she merely used softer dynamics to create a smoother more melancholy tone. It worked beautifully.

Now, my favorite character, CHE! I absolutely loved Anotonio Banderas in his role as Che! He was so wonderfully sarcastic and cynical. Not to mention funny. I could never see anyone else as Che. And who knew that Antonio could sing?! His voice is beautiful and it makes me wonder why he never went for a singing career. I mean, he has talent. Why is it always the talented singers (like him) don't record and the whiny-untalented-squeaky-immature ones (like Hilary Duff, who has no talent) who do? So messed up. Anyway, Antonio Banderas personified Che wonderfully. He did great with balancing his feelings for Evita. At the beginning he supports her and is behind her all the way, towards the middle he begins to doubt and criticize, by the waltz he hates her, but it turns around when he sees she's dying. Antonio was the best during ""Lament"". When he sings and kisses her coffin afterwards it shows that despite what many thought, he didn't hate her in the end, but loved her instead. He did a fabulous job in this movie.

Peron's character could've been better. I mean, Antonio and Madonna had all this chemistry (especially in ""Waltz for Eva and Che) and him and Madonna had none at all. He was supposed to be her husband. Maybe it was because he looked so old, but he could've been casted better.

Madonna stars in movie as the title role of Evita. This movie is the story of Argentina's former first lady, Eva Peron. This film starts from the end and then goes from beginning to end. It shows how she went to Buenos Aires with a tango singer. It shows hows Eva took on lovers to get jobs, and even helped her husband, who is played by Jonathan Pryce, get the presidency for 2 terms. She and her husband did have 2 weddings, one was in a church and one was a civil ceremony. Eva also traveled while she was first lady. She got woman the right to vote. She also did start a foundation. She did help build houses, hopitals, and schools. When her husband went for his 2nd term as president, the people rallied for her to be vice-president. Eva Peron did had many Christain Dior, over 100 furs, and a jewelry collection comparable to Cleopatra's. Sadly, Evita died when she was just 33, of uterine cancer.

900848,4,6304504039,"One of the interesting sidelights to this movie is the fact that Oliver Stone wrote part of the screenplay.  While watching it I kept wondering what part?  Stone, whose edgy, over the top indictments of oppression, corruption and especially military stupidity, wouldn't seem to be one to celebrate the elevation of Eva Peron to something close to sainthood, which is what this movie does.  Maybe all his work ended up on the cutting room floor.  Or maybe it was obscured by Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.  Certainly we do not see the decamisados (Peron's version of his friend Mussolini's Blackshirts) torturing anyone, and although the ""disappeared"" are mentioned in passing, there is no retrospective that allows us to see just how widespread and horrific were the murders committed by the Peronists.
Anyway, Madonna, who certainly fits the part like a glove, stars as Evita, and she gives the performance of her life.  Yet somehow it is unconvincing, or I should say, somehow the film doesn't really get to the essence of the woman who rose from poverty to the pinnacle of power in Argentina, a woman extravagantly loved by the common people of Argentina even while she was a party to the fascist oppression.  I don't think this is Madonna's fault. Her voice is good, not great, of course, but her dramatic skills are very much in evidence, skills that have always been underrated, although I'm not sure why. If you watch her in this and in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) you can see that she has a range easily exceeding that of most actresses.  I think that ironically it is the very quality of common origin and common appeal that the Argentines so loved in Evita that the critics hold against Madonna.
Antonio Banderas plays Che, who narrates and attempts to objectify the events while symbolizing both Evita's alter-ego and the man who would really be her proper mate were it not for her rapacious political appetite.  Che's character and his dramatic role (from the play by Tim Rice) is perhaps the most important artistic achievement of the musical after Webber's beautiful and inspiring music.  Banderas is winning and enormously vivid in the part, and he sings well and expressively.
Jonathan Pryce plays Peron with more dignity and humanity than history might allow.  His sensitivity as an actor combined with a modest demeanor seemed to me so unrealistic as to be almost a miscasting.  Yet he is perhaps as compelling as anyone on the screen and he certainly looked the part.  Interesting is Jimmy Nail as the cabaret singer Magaldi.  He combines sleazy good looks with a kind of vulnerable persona that seems exactly right.
Well, what can be said about the music except that it is one of Webber's great triumphs and so very typical of his work.  It is beautiful, stirring, moving, enchanting and memorable.  Who can forget the haunting, plaintive refrain of ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"" or the gorgeous simplicity of ""You Must Love Me""?  While Madonna's voice would not fill up a concert hall or take her by itself to the Broadway stage, she does an outstanding job with Webber's songs.  A natural performer (Madonna's key talent), her expressive interpretations range from the ordinary to the transfixing.  I very much enjoyed her efforts and predict that critics in the future will be kinder to her than today's critics.
The ending seemed too drawn out and then when the screen faded to black and the credits began to run it seemed almost abrupt and without resolution.  I also did not like the way that Madonna (38 at the time) seemed no younger in the earlier scenes with her hair dyed pitch black.  I think director Alan Parker should have given us more of an illusion of youth, perhaps spared her some of the closeups and fuzzed out the lines under her eyes. Strange how the golden blonde hair and exquisitely applied makeup in the remainder of the film made her look younger.  All directors should know what Madonna learned many years ago: blonde hair usually makes a woman look younger because those with naturally light-colored hair are their blondest as children.  Like big eyes and relatively big heads, blonde hair is a signal of youth that arrests our eyes.
Despite the flaws this is an engrossing cinematic experience, and for Madonna fans, Banderas fans, and in particular fans of Andrew Lloyd Webber, it is a film not to be missed.",1081728000,62,4363,4.834677419354839
900849,3,6304504039,"I don't like Madonna but I have to admit she tried so hard to pull this role off and almost succeeded. Her voice is a pop voice. This role calls for a powerful singer and anyone who saw Patti LuPone do this role on Broadway will be struck with how unsuited Madonna's voice is for it. But she did try. Her dancing is fine, her look is almost right. She was too old to play young Eva and too robust looking to play sick, dying Eva but did a passable job as Eva at her height. And then there was the acting problem. Sometimes she was well grounded in the character and sometimes all you could see was Madonna just going through the motions pretending to be Evita. She and Jonathan Pryce had no chemistry at all and that was a flaw. The Perons may not have been a love match but they were a powerful team and it just didn't come across that way in the movie. The best thing about the movie is Antonio Banderas as the sarcastic, angry and ultimately shocked and heartbroken Che. He's not playing the historical Che of course but Che as a sort of smarter than the masses Greek chorus who follows Eva around pointing out the truth of her pretenions.
This was a beautiful looking movie. It's a big overgrown music video but a strangely unsatisfying effort. If you loved Evita you'll be happier just buying one of the Broadway or London recordings but avoid the movie soundtrack at all costs--with no visual distractions the shortcomings of Madonna's voice are downright painful.",1081641600,2,1470,4.448148148148148

I finally decided to really try and get through the whole thing, and....I just can't. Madonna is probably a nice lady. She's made some very danceable songs. But, she cannot act, and, she does not have the vocal chops to pull off this role. She certainly should be credited for possessing an abundance of confidence, and she looks convincing as Eva Peron. But, it is obvious she was chosen for her popularity. This is one of those cases where they put together popular stars, big budget, and all the ingredients that should make a great film, and, they made a boring one. I really don't know who they should have chosen to play Evita, but, they needed an actress with skill, soul, and a great voice, and instead, they chose the Pop Tart Of The Century. Admit it, it may not be totally lousy, but, it should have been a whole lot better. The film that does the play justice has yet to be made.",1079481600,18,1038,4.526595744680851

She doesn't connect with the woman she's portraying, Eva Peron. Antonio Banderas is in a interesting situation, playing varying characters with different perspectives, but that doesn't save ""Evita"". I found this to be a very boring film.

But what I really want to comment on here is that if you have stayed away from this movie because you think it might be another ""Who's That Girl?"" -- don't!  Madonna does an excellent job in this film.  It is the role she always wanted to play, and I don't think anyone could have done it better than her.

900903,3,6304504039,"Madonna has finally gotten the role that she said herself was born to play: Evita. This film is an up-dated movie-musical version of the broadway musical, Evita.
  Madonna is in the role of Eva ""Evita"" Peron, who rose from poverty to riches and fame. Eva lived a life so perfect, so sublime, it seemed to good to be true. Until she became diagnosed with uterary cancer. She passed away on July 26, 1952, leaving her nation heartbroken.
  Madonna was incredibly outstanding in this role. This was a role that was made only for Madonna and nobody else. They could've picked the best actress in the world and that actress still wouldn't come close to Madonna's performance. But the movie itself wasn't what I had expected. I was thinking this would be a movie with dialogue. I didn't expect to me a movie that was a musical. That's why I gave it three stars instead of five. Still, Madonna delivers another one of her best performances. Her rendition of Don't Cry For Me Argentina is nothing less than beautiful. I think her rendition of the song is the best one around.

900904,3,6304504039,"Alan Paker's Evita is a big Hollywood musical based on an even bigger Broadway stage hit. It took twenty years and multiple changes of  directors and stars to get to this point. The question that remains is was it all worth it. From my point of view the answer is a definite maybe.
Evita tells the watered down story of Eva Peron a woman who wanted it all and seemingly got it all by the time of her death at age 33. Madonna pulls off the role with ease. She blends herself into the role with abandon. It does not matter that she no longer looks like the 15 year old Eva Duarte she is supposed to be playing at the beginning of the film. Her vocals sweep and soar and we actually have a great time watching the Material Girl try to pull off the part of a lifetime.
The Greek chorus of the film is the character Che played by Antonio Banderas. Banderas is one of the surprises of the film. His singing is more than adequate and just under the surface there is the cynicism that is necessary to make the part work. The character of Eva had to be watered down for the movie to be shot on location and if you watch just closely enough Banderas brings some of Eva's questionable character back.
Alan Parker acquits himself well as director. The film moves along swiftly and looks great. Watch the crowd scenes during Peron's rise to power and the stirring cinematography that accompanies ""A New Argentina"" to see what I mean. If there is a problem here it is that at some points the film looks rather like a long form music video than an actaul feature film.
My only real problem with this disc is that there are no extras at all. Not even the theatrical trailer is presented. Hollywood pictures did a fine job with the transfer but give the buyer a little more for his money.
Watch this one with the sound up it is well worth your time.",1073606400,3,1832,4.279538904899136

900907,5,6304504039,"The life of Eva Peron is one that has intrigued many throughout the years. Even before Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice decided to write a musical about her brief but amazing life, there were others who had tried to revive her legend. There was a short lived off-broadway play called ""The Diamond Orchid"" which was loosely based on her life, a soft-core European movie titled ""Little Mother"" released in the early 70's and a short lived French play titled ""Eva Peron by Copi"" which had the role of Evita played by a Transvestite. But it wasn't until the release of a double album in 1976 by Lloyd Webber and Rice that made Evita famous once again. 20 years later, after many false go-aheads, the film version was finally released.

The musical traces the brief but meteoric rise of Maria Eva Duarte de Peron. Her sudden rise from childhood poverty to becoming one of the world's most powerful woman, made her a hero to some, a power hungry villain to others. The movie, like the woman, was controversial. Even after the movie was over many were still left with the questions, was she a Saint or a Sinner? Good or Bad? Was she the Savior to Argentina's ""shirtless"" ones or a Monstrous dictator to the well-to-do? People will just have to come up with their own conclusions but having studied the subject for over 12 years now, I must state that you should not take a Broadway/Hollywood musical as a history lesson. Especially when the subject matter is someone who's as complicated as Eva Peron. Both Peronists and Anti-Peronists agree- the woman was an enigma, a paradox. We may never know the whole truth. However the facts should be noted. Her foundation built over 1000 schools (according to historians although the totals vary), over 100 hospitals, thousands of homes for the poor, several orphanages, old age homes, shelters for runaway girls, shelters for unwed mother, a complete miniature village for children, and youth hostels all between 1948-1952. Health care became free to the poor and the mortality rates among children improved and many diseases such as cholera and TB were reduced. She also sat in her office for 15-20 hours a day receiving the poor up until the last year of her life. She would visit shanty towns and personally give out food, sugar or a bottle of cider. She would pick up homeless people off the streets and take them back, in her limousine, to the residential palace where she would bathe them and feed them. Many have laughed at the idea of Eva Peron being referred to as ""Santa Evita"" (Saint Evita) but the above accomplishments are the reasons as to why so many thought of her as a Saint. And then of course there is the darker aspects of her character which are emphasized in the Black Myth. Her undying loyalty to her husband and his cause, her driving ambition, her alleged ruthlessness, her determination to succeed no matter what the cost. What is the point of these ramblings? Well, her career, her legend is far too complex to explain in a 2 hours musical that is largely based on gossip and supposition.

Moving on to the movie and it is beautifully filmed with sumptuous costumes, glorious sets and Lloyd Webber's score is one of his best. Many have complained about the repetitiveness of the music but objectively speaking, you can't really write a rock opera (no spoken dialogue) without recycling some of the tunes and a lot of contemporary theatre composers repeat the main tunes throughout their score. You can't expect Sir. Lloyd Webber to write a new tune for every single sung phrase, let's be realistic. He is not the first and certainly won't be the last contemporary theatre composer to repeats his melodies throughout. Speaking of the music- it ranges from exciting- ""Buenos Aires"", ""Rainbow High"" (my personal favorite) to theatrical-""A New Argentina"", ""Rainbow Tour"", to haunting- ""I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You"", ""Another Suitcase In Another Hall"", ""You Must Love Me"". It is true that the score had to be modified to better suit Madonna's range but in actuality she never sounded better. Madonna's passion for the role is clearly evident in her performance. We saw Eva's passion, power, ambition and pain. We were charmed by her youthful vitality in the first half of the film (despite looking much older than 15), moved by her sincere attempt to win acceptance in the middle and saddened by the pain of her ravaged body in the final frames. The physical resemblance was also striking. However, I must state that Eva Peron at her physical peak (before the cancer destroyed her appearance) had a particularly unique aspect to her beauty. Many have resembled her or at least tried to resemble her but the original woman had characteristics that made her beauty and elegance stand out. Looking at the several picture magazines of the time period and the newsreel footage of her, she was a larger than life persona with an aura of a goddess- the song ""Rainbow High"" is very accurate in its treatment of her elegance during that stage in her life where high maintenance glamour was at the forefront.

Being a fan and collector of Eva Peron, I have read and collected several magazines and books- I have over 100 in my collection, and I still find her story fascinating. Although the musical ""Evita"" is biased and one-sided, the stage version of the show captivated me from the opening number to the final scene so I was eagerly anticipating the release of the movie musical version. Almost 20 years separate the original stage version and the movie version and there were some changes made, most notably- Eva Peron's character was portrayed more sympathetically. Many felt that the reason for this was solely because the makers needed Former Argentine President Carlos Menem's approval so they could use the Presidential Palace in the celebrated balcony scene. Anyone who has read Alan Parker's Book, ""The Making of Evita"" will know that that is not entirely true. There have been many books about Eva Peron published since the opening of the stage musical but at the time when Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice decided to write a musical about Evita, there were not that many biographies on the subject. The only major biography available at the time was Mary Main's hostile and inaccurate ""The Woman With the Whip"". Notable historians of Eva Peron (Maryssa Navarro, Nicholas Fraser, J M Taylor, Alicia Dujovne Ortiz and even Alan Parker) have denounced this book since the books author was a rich Anglo-Argentine who used the opposition as her informants and her book (although well written) is a malicious, anti-Peronist and damaging view of Eva's life. She accuses Eva Peron of every unpleasant act known to man. Stating she slept her way to the top is one thing but accusing someone of murder and torture without having the slightest shred of evidence is pretty irresponsible- Mary Main even states in her book ...""there is no proof"". Alan Parker and Madonna who had read every book there was on Evita took this into consideration and is why they chose to portray a more balanced view of the woman.

""Chicago"" (2002), is being credited as the film that revived the movie musical and although it is entertaining and technically well made, it was by no means (and I know that many would agree) the best film of the year. ""Evita"" pre-dates ""Chicago"" by many years and was the first major musical to come from Hollywood since ""Grease"". ""Evita"" is rarely given credit for breathing new life to a movie genre that had been dead for nearly 2 decades. In 1996 ""Evita"" (and Madonna) was snubbed by the Oscar's- although the movie did receive 5 Oscar nominations and it did win 3 Golden Globes, it didn't receive a nomination for ""Best Picture"" or ""Best Director"". Whether you loved the movie or hated it, one has to admit that Alan Parker did an extraordinary job in transferring the musical from stage to screen.

In closing, ""Evita"" - the movie, like the woman herself, is a love it or hate it type of experience. Many will hate the subject matter, the politics, the fact that there is no spoken dialogue (rock operas/sung-through musicals are an acquired taste). Others will take offense at the film's so called glorification of an ""immoral"" and beautiful fascist leader. But for those wanting to experience something a little different- a Hollywood-esque attempt at a history lesson with some tango, pop, and theatre thrown in, ""Evita"" may be the movie for you. Give it a chance and you just might fall under the seductive spell of the elegantly dressed and bejeweled temptress in front of the microphone. That is the magic of ""Evita"".",1068336000,15,8596,4.801485482781904

Although the movie itself is amazing, the visual effects, the music even how much Madonna looked like Eva and portrayed her strong character, there are so many historical incongruences, the way it was implied Eva slept her way to the top (maybe she did have affairs with notable gentlemen but she isn't the first or the last one to sleep her way, is she?), the first thing that made me shake my head was her father's funeral scene, in real life Eva was the only one who did not feel a thing about her father's dead, yet in the movie she cries and goes and kisses him. Another very  big innacuracy is the unproven fact that Eva ran away with Magaldi, the tango singer, even though it's one of the many theories on how she made it to the big city and perhaps the most accepted, but, he was not married nor he had a child.
I could go on and on and on about the many errors in the movie, rumor has it that Rice and Webber based the whole musical solely on one book, without doing any extensive reasearch about the life of Eva Peron, I read the book that they claim was the base for the whole thing and I have to say, it's the most boring book I've read and it was written by a total anti peronist.
In short, if you want to see a good musical, great scenarios, nice customs, very good music and see a great Madonna performance, EVITA will please you, however, if you are interested in the life of the real Eva, I suggest you get some of the books that are offered here, like the one by Alicia Dujovne Ortiz or the one by Marisa Navarro and even the novel Santa Evita (GREAT BOOK), they will give you a better view and you can rest assure that extensive research was done by their authors and it's not a partial view of 2 people who only write music or of an anti peronist who decided to bad mouth Evita.",1055808000,2,1911,4.150943396226415

In the case of EVITA, the song and dance IS the narrative, making it unique to the genre.
  EVITA is visualy stunning, elegant and somber.  Filmed in a sort of color sepia that works very well with the period.  The role of Eva Peron was indeed ment for Madonna, scince the film is basicaly the most [costly] and lavish music video ever filmed, who better than the best video actress of our generation to portray her?  Although Madonna can't seem to ""be in the moment"" when she acts in non-singing roles, once she hears and feels the music, like in her videos, she lets it possess and guide her emotionally beautifly with all the range and emotion required of beleivable acting.

Not as bad a performance by Madonna as in Swept Away, but she is wooden and lost in the crucial dramatic scenes. Her ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" lacks the power of Patti Lupone's and is inoffensive at best, revealing what we always knew in the first place, Madonna is a studio creation with a weak voice. The biggest crime is the stealing from Peron's mistress the song ""Another Suticase in Another Hall"" and giving it to Evita.

Are you people the same people who think these FAKE rockers/rappers/etc of today can sing so beautifully. I highly recommend listening to the song ""La Isla Bonita"" and tell me if she can't sing? While you people are complaining about this not being the play I will enjoy this movie. I honestly recommend that you listen closer and keep your negative opinions about Madonna out of it.
About the movie, Antonio Banderas was suprisingly great. And Madonna is an outstanding singer and she didn't disappoint here. It deserved every award it got. I recommend you to read the review Roger Ebert wrote on this movie because it is very true and well written. It is also very historically true.",1042675200,3,833,4.784722222222222
900971,2,6304504039,"Okay...to my opinion on Evita, The Motion Picture.  I am not comparing this to the Broadway play--I have not seen the play.  I am a musical fanatic, so it's not that I find musical productions boring or trite or weird or anything.  The movie really didn't do it for me.  I don't think Madonna should have been cast as Evita.
Yes, I'm aware that there were similarities in Evita's and Madonna's lives, and even physical likenesses.  And yes, Madonna is a singer.  However, Madonna's voice, I feel, is not suited for the rangy, lusty material in this musical.  ""Like A Virgin"" is not ""Buenos Aires.""  After seeing this movie I listened to other recordings of Evita, and Madonna's renditions don't even come close to matching the passion and gusto to those of Laurie Beechman or Patti LuPone.  In fact, the ranges of the songs were quite obviously adjusted to compensate for Madonna's lack of vocal ability.
One reviewer stated that ""This isn't the Broadway version, but this movie stands on its own.""  No, I don't agree.  A movie should be compared to others in its own genre.  A Broadway musical should not be made into a 3-hour music video.
I also had a hard time with the way Evita was shot.  The song ""Buenos Aires"" is really lively and full of energy.  Madonna should have been out on a bright, sunny open marketplace, dancing(utilizing one of her strengths), with action happening all around; horses, peddlers, merchants, and aristocrats.  For the most part, it was shot in a dark, dingy nightclub (in a single room).  Why film something in one room?  You're not confined to a stage anymore!  I found myself becoming extremely bored and restless after about an hour into the film.
Contrary to some other reviewers, I thought Antonio Banderas did a fine job.  I understand that his character was somewhat different than in the original.  Regardless of that, I felt he breathed fiery Latin passion into his role and gave the movie the spark it much needed.",1041379200,3,1958,4.71976401179941
900972,4,6304504039,"Critics have maybe unkindly lambasted Madonna in her few film roles since this one, but ""Evita"" easily remains her best screen performance. Adapted from famed Broadway producer Andrew Lloyd Weber's long-running stage play about Evita Peron, the charismatic late first lady of Argentina, the movie treatment attracted much casting speculation and critics wrote with some wariness at the decision to cast Madonna. But she portrays the enigmatic Evita with a magnatism that projects from the screen, and Madonna shines in conveying the emotional distance that the real-life lady apparently projected. Madonna handily earned the Golden Globe best actress award she won but was passed over, perhaps unfairly, at Oscar time. As compelling as Madonna is, though, she is nearly upstaged by Antonia Banderas in a surprisingly masterful singing role. As the narrator commenting on behalf of Argentina's devastated working class in the early 1950's, Banderas is simply astonishing. You don't have to be a Madonna or Banderas fan to appreciate this film their vocal interpretations of the songs in it, highlighted by the stirringly emotional Oscar-winner, ""You Must Love Me.""  Visually stunning, the film's leads also pack a tremendous acting punch, and Madonna especially manages to give us a clue as to what made the real Evita tick.",1039046400,,1323,5.360576923076923
901006,2,6304504039,This is one of or if not Madonna's most boring and uniteresting films that she has ever done.  The film had high expectations and the first night it was released in theaters the place was packed.  By the second half of the film more than half the audience was asleep.  I was getting pretty bored myself.  I think this is a lacklustre movie and a waste of money.  The entire film is nothing but song and at the very end there is finally some dialogue.  That was the dialogue that won Madonna an accolade.  If you must see this film expect to yaaaaawn all the way!,1038614400,4,562,4.245283018867925
901007,5,6304504039,"Evita is a good film on many levels. As a musical, it has a fantastic soundtrack; songs such as ""High Flying, Adored"" and ""Waltz for Evita and Ch"" stay with you long after the credits finish. As a bioepic, it is also strong, giving the viewer the feel for the rapid rise and fall of Eva Duarte. And, needless to say, as a Madonna movie, it's practically Citizen Kane.
However, there is another way of looking at the film: as a statement about government. The nameless everyman played by Antonio Banderas is named ""Ch"" where he is named at all, an almost certain reference to Ch Guevara. And the film itself shows Juan Peron rise to power as a populist general, only to turn against his people as a dictator as brutal as those that preceded him. Eva was used to distract people as their liberties were trampled; ""She's the one that's kept us where we are"" Juan sings. And when she dies (it happens at the start, so it's hardly a spoiler), Ch rightly sings that ""Your queen is dead, your king is through). Evita held the government in place, and it will crumble with out her, because of it's repressive rule
And... um, I guess I may have sort of wandered off here. Bottom line: don't be a despot; watch Evita.",1034380800,3,1207,4.417040358744394
901008,2,6304504039,"Really, this DVD looks like a direct laser disc transfer.  I watched this in theaters so I had expected a certain ""look"".  Just wasn't there.  Now I have quite a number of DVDs and I know about calibrating the monitor.  This one threw off my settings.  The songs, I think, sound better in stereo.  They sound unnatural in multichannel.
There is also the dearth of extras in the DVD.  Not even of the ""cast and crew"" type.
This movie on its own is watchable and collectible enough that it needs a better DVD.",1033344000,2,507,4.387096774193548
901009,5,6304504039,"Before Andrew Lloyd Webber and Time Rice came along and gave this story the breath of life through the rock opera medium, the life of Argentine icon Eva Peron might have never occurred to anyone as a great subject for an opera, much less a rock one. But Webber and Rice pulled it off brilliantly and Alan Parker has created the definitive film adaptation of the piece. The film version of the ""Evita"" musical was an idea for years, Oliver Stone was attached to direct at one point (he shares screenwriting credit) but had a falling out with Madonna and filmed ""The Doors"" instead. Parker picked up the project and has created a timeless, exhilarating experience of drama and music. Pop star Madonna has never been ranked with Webber stars like Sarah Brightman, but she holds her own ground here and delivers what must be her best vocal work considering the range and skill a tune like ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" requires is much more than the demands of ""Vogue."" She also fits nicely into the role, completely becoming the character. Antonio Banderas is a wonderful Che, his voice also delivers and he has raised the bar for future actors who take on the role. Parker has director has not made a better movie since this one. ""Evita"" crystalizes the best of Parker's talents, it's always a visual feast and the texture of the film is almost enough to recommend it. Those who thought ""The Wall"" was a disorganized acid trip will appreciate the focus and epic scope of ""Evita."" And of course there's the music. The songs are catchy, beautiful and classic, always going for broke. ""Evita"" is a grand opus, one of the great modern musicals that can probably now be seen as a precursor for flicks like ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""Chicago"" and the next upcoming Webber-inspired film, ""The Phantom Of The Opera."" This is a movie for people who love music marching to the beat of awesome cinema.",1032652800,8,1877,4.673716012084592

I am not a Madonna fan but heard so much about this production and thinking what a wonderful pick.  When i finally did see the movie and saw Madonna, my first thoughts were Madonna IS Eva Peron.  Madonna is more than WONDERFUL in this film, she stood out like a Goddest. Give this film a change, everything about this production is flawless. Great Job!",1028332800,2,448,4.506172839506172
901011,4,6304504039,"I saw the film the week it opened back in 1996 and just bought the DVD. But I must say: If this film irked you, you should've seen the stage show, which was even more brittle and astringent with its completely *unsympathetic* portrayal of Sra. Peron. One masterstroke is that the film sets out to give Eva more sympathy than the play did (never mind that she ultimately remained an enigma; that was the case of the actual woman also). But the film makes some important alterations throughout the story. In the stage show Eva uses, then throws over, Magaldi. This is reversed in the film, with Magaldi leaving her at his door (making her a kind of spurned victim) which ultimately leads to the spotlight torch song ""Another Suitcase In Another Hall"" (sung on stage, by the way, by a background character). Later, when she sings ""You Must Love Me,"" she is further softening the Evita character. (The lyrics illustrate the couple's marriage of convenience and how now that they're coming to the end, maybe there's love in their union after all.) But many scenes- several of Madonna's songs, *all* of Banderas's - are quite impressive. And the scene on the balcony (the ""Casa Rosada""), is worth the price of the DVD, just to hear the chant of ""Peron! Peron!"" change over to ""Evii-ta! Evii-ta!""",1028073600,,1289,4.707964601769912
901012,5,6304504039,"Madonna's extensive voice training in preparation for this role really pays off. She sounds and looks breathtaking. The vocals are outstanding- who knew Antonio Bandaras could sing like that? As usual, Jonathan Price contributes a very believable aspect to the film. The footage shot inside the actual Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires adds a realism that no studio recreation could capture. Over all, this film is an absolute gem to anyone who truly appreciates musical theater.",1027900800,2,473,5.2368421052631575

When I learned when I was older it was from a musical I wanted to see it.  The only problem is in Sacramento there is not many theater's capable of perfoming Evita.  When I heard the movie came out I rented it and fell in love with it.  I thought it had wonderful music and the story line intriged me.  I bought the video a little while back and I think it is awesome.  I might have felt differently, though if I would have seen it in theater first.  I think Andrew Lloyd Webber makes great music.  From what I have seen the ""Phantom of the Opera"" is a better musical but Evita is incredible and unforgetable in its own right.",1026604800,,797,4.090322580645161

Madonna gives what is almost certainly the only film performance she'll be remembered kindly for, and Banderas makes a very compelling, slightly sinister, Che.  Jonathan Pryce does a solid job as Juan Peron, though he does tend to talk through his songs as opposed to sing them.  There is, however, one serious flaw I would like to warn prospective buyers/viewers of:  the soundtrak was recorded separately from the film, and, while one cannot really fault director Alan Parker for the decision, one can blame him for its effect, which is to make the whol film look almost dubbed.  It is usually quite obvious the characters are not singing, especially when their mouths are not moving! All in all, though, well worth wacthing.",1026432000,,835,4.8936170212765955

Though some people have some reservations about Madonna playing Eva Peron, I think she did an excellent job and she really worked to pull off the role well. And who can say more about Antonio Banderas as Che? He is the perfect actor for the part, displaying his range of talent from acting to singing to dancing. Though the movie does change some things from the original play production, I believe they are for the best. All the songs are included including a new one written for the movie, ""You Must Love Me"". I was disapointed that this DVD doesn't have any special features what so ever, but I hope people will buy it for the movie itself instead of the special features.

To be sure, this is an either love-it-or-hate-it film, but if you allow yourself to get swept up in the first few moments, and accept the fact that there is no dialogue, only song, you are guaranteed an almost singular theatrical experience.  I was prepared to dismiss this film as another ""event movie"" and unexpectedly found myself enjoying every frame.  Madonna proves she is more than simply capable as an actress - here, she gives a career-definining performance that few of her contemporaries could have ever delivered.  Banderas is equally superb as Che, and JOnathan Pryce shines as Peron.  Part history lesson, all glorious music, Alan Parker's definitive screen classic sprawls before you in an epic that cannot be dismissed.  Vocally, the singing is pitch perfect, far superior to the stage version with Patti Lupone.  And, far from being an excuse for Madonna to put her ""Like a Virgin"" days behind her, ""Evita"" is pure cinematic magic.  It's a shame people didn't give this movie alot more credit when it was released - sure, it won the Golden Globe for best Film and Madonna was named Best Actress (deservedly.)  But Oscars were denied to all but the Best Song ""You Must Love Me"" a plea for forgiveness that is painful to listen to, but grand nonetheless.  Truly a special, idiosyncractic film that takes the breath away from anyone who allows themselves to be taken.  Be taken!

Okay, so this is a TALL order.  This is a beautifully set movie that was well received worldwide except in the US.  I feel it's because nobody in the US would take Madonna seriously as an actress, let alone as a serious actress.  OPEN YOUR MINDS PEOPLE because Madonna can act.

901078,5,6304504039,"Many watched this film to see if its lead actress would fail. Madonna-bashing was a popular sport, especially for her acting performances. There is nothing wrong with her performance here, either as an actress or singer (even though she can be seen breathing when she is supposed to be lying dead in her coffin). The real revelation, though is Jonathan Pryce. We all knew he could act from films like Brazil and Breaking Glass, but here he shows he is also quite a good singer. It's clear that he did all his own songs himself, and some of the charisma he injects into the role of Peron rubs off on his singing performance. This is also true of Madonna, who singing isn't up to Judy Covington's original, but she just seems so right for the role, especially when the excellent period make-up and clothes are added. Jimmy Nail has fun as Magaldi, and Banderas (probably hiding from Madonna after her comments in In Bed With Madonna!) works well as the modified Che, no longer representing Che Guevara but now a metaphor for the Argentinean workers.
Parker manages some amazing feats, securing the use of the genuine Casa Rosada to film the balcony scenes, as well as the services of hundreds of Argentineans to play the grieving public. These give the director impressive distance shots to balance his subtle close-ups, reflecting the huge impact that this very personal story made on one country. Parker sticks to the original narrative of the musical without additional dialogue, retaining Rice and Lloyd-Webber's spirit. The sound quality is spectacular, the THX or surround giving us the full dynamic range of the orchestra. The additional song 'You Must Love Me' shows that Rice and Lloyd-Webber haven't lost their touch, and Madonna's idea of transferring 'Another Suitcase In Another Hall' to her character is spot on.",1007596800,2,1824,4.906148867313916
901079,5,6304504039,"Madonna was well-chosen for the title role of this musical. She is a promiscuous bottle blonde who lost a parent when young, just like the illustrious former First Lady of Argentina.
 Eva Peron was a woman who lived fast, died young, left behind a good-looking corpse, and a smashing wardrobe. This film emphasizes at least two of those aspects of Evita's life. Jonathan Pryce bears little resemblance to the real Juan Peron, but he can carry a tune. He never appears to be the menacing dictator that Peron was known to have been, but when he confronts his teenage mistress(sympathetically played by Andrea Corr), or Eva's terminal illness, he comes across as a sheepish little boy who was caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
 Victoria Sus captures the streetwise persona that must have been Juana Ibarguren. While the contempt that the widow of Eva's father must have had for her and her five children is understandable, it should be remembered that Eva's mother did what she had to do to survive at a time when women had fewer options. If there is anything to be said for Eva's contraversial rise to power, she did give Argentinian women the vote, which would help to lessen the chances of their having to prostitute themselves in order to survive as she and her mother did.
 Antonio Banderas wears many different hats as fellow Argentinian, Che Guevara, who in fact, never met Eva Peron. His subtle tone is quite suitable for rock operas and in fact, it reminds me a little of Ted Neely's singing in ""Jesus Christ, Superstar"", another Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. His mannerisms are mocking and unsymapthetic as he mixes in with all elements of Argentine society, trying to get the scoop on this young woman who has taken her country by storm.
 There is a noticeable change in lyrics where certain numbers are concerned. When the song, ""And the Money Kept Rolling In"" is played, a very important stanza about the Perons' fleecing of their nation's treasury is left out. I have wondered if the producers of this film had to strike a deal with the Argentinian government to leave that stanza out in order to film in a country where Eva is still so revered. Earlier, Eva's lines in ""Peron's Latest Flame"" are changed from ""Is that the extent of your interest in me? It shows how futile acting must be."" to"" Acting is limiting. The lines not mine. That's no help to the Argentine."" But it's great how Lloyd-Webber recreates the two groups most opposed to Eva's rise to power in that song by making the military officers shout their lyrics as military officers would when giving or responding to commands, and the aristocracy sing theirs in a ringing chorale to express their highbrow mannerisms.
 Jimmy Nail is given the other standout performance as Eva's first lover, Agustin Magaldi. He has a pleasant voice, but somehow an audience would get the impression that he wasn't all that great a singer. Julian Littman does bear a close resemblance to Eva's devoted brother, Juan. The most comically pathetic character is, perhaps Marcelo Alejandro Marcelli's beautiful-eyed Huevo, the photographer who helps Eva land her first gig as a professional model, only to find himself being spurned by her as she goes on to more advantageous conquests.
 The film doesn't capture everything accurately. But it's quite a musical. At once, it is solemn, majestic, passionate, riveting, rollicking, funny,and dignified. It never lets up for a moment as it captures the fire, color and spirit of both its title character and of her beloved Argentina in the early part of the 20th century.",1007510400,6,3576,4.834967320261438

But this version of Evita was so watered-down from the stage version, so many ""objectionable"" elements removed to please the Argentine authorities so they could get permission to film on location that it is a poor imitation of the original version.
The original stage version of Evita showed some things that were true about the former First Lady of Argentina.  She was power-hungry.  There is little evidence that Juan loved her in life as much as he loved her in death.  He never even visited her after she fell ill unless he wore a mask (although it was cancer and the mask was useless).
In the movie, whole sections of songs were altered or removed to ""soften"" Evita from the woman who stole a great deal of the wealth of Argentina and moved it to her own accounts.

See Evita once, and you must see it again, memorize the words, dye your hair blonde, and practice singing to low E.  I love Andrew Lloyd Webber's music--he tests the limits of the human voice, and makes it interesting with vocal extremes (SQUEAK to RUMBLE).  However, Andrew also gives all of us girls a break from having to take the high parts all the time, and usually writes most of his girls pretty low, and all of his guys in the VERY HIGH (For a male) range.  Madonna was great!!!  She gives hope to all of those altos out there!  In a way, Evita's story reflects her own, because Madonna didn't exactly start out on top, and neither did Evita.  Both women had the qualities of acting like celebrities before they achieved stardom.  Also, I have heard (because I have not seen the stage version yet) that Evita was played with a more manipulative edge in the stage version.  I have read parts of Evita's biography, and her true personality was not like that.  Madonna becomes Evita perfectly by playing her more sincerely, which is more fitting to the real Eva Peron.  I had no idea that Antonio Banderas could sing as well as he does.  His style of singing does not lead you to believe that the songs are very hard at all, and that anybody can do it.  (When you actually try, even for me--a female--singing the way he does on such high notes is pretty hard).  His portrayal of Che is complex and does not confuse you with the complexity.  You can practically hear his thoughts aloud when he is walking up to kiss Evita's coffin: ""I could have loved you, but so much separated us in life that nothing was possible."", which may be part of why he hated her (sorry, a more diluted word escapes me at the moment).  I, personally, had no problem with the accent, as I have heard some theatre purists complain about it.  I believe Che may have respected Evita, even if he did not agree with her, and I think this movie shows that anyone has to, because of what she did.  She was not totally good or totally bad.  She was a human being, just like you and me, but she fought her way to the top, and you must admire her for that.  This movie did this great woman in Argentine and world history justice.  P.S.

Who had to take voice lessons- finally!  The results are worth it madonna is not an actress and never will be-she just doesnt have the presence. She has built this persona as MADONNA that you cant see her as anything else and the definition of an actor is to be a chameleon.  But What she does here is give you the best video of her career she mourns at you and begs for you ta accept he rinterpertaion of the materials.  And i do accept it. Bandeas is good here if not a bit overwhelming but the true star here is the cinematography.

I thought the film was just great.  I received the film soundtrack as a gift long before I saw the movie.  I happened to be ill, and for three days, all day long, I listened to the sountrack again and again.  The music is fabulous, the melodies terrific, the integration really fine.  The story formed itself in my mind solely from the lyrics... I pictured Antonio Banderas, as Che, playing a walk-on minstrel-narrator who occasionally dropped into the scene, not unlike Nat Cole and Stubby Kaye in Cat Ballou -- and the movie, in fact, after I finally got to see it, bore out that impression.
Antonio was preferable to Mandy because of the accent.  The Che character NEEDED that accent, rolling R's and all, and Antonio provided it perfectly.  And Madonna was super.  If only fate had offered this role to her ten years earlier!",989280000,3,1089,4.664921465968586

Stylish, well-paced and intelligent, this films features 2 solid performances by Madonna in the title role, and Antonio Banderas as the commentator, Che.  Madonna plays the role on a more ambiguous level then the stage version, where her character's selfishness was obviously clear-cut.  Fortunately, it works to communicate why the people of Argentina loved this icon.  Madonna handles the role very well, making this her best film performance ever.  However, Antonio Banderas' Che is the movie's heart and soul.  Played more as a ""man on the street"" as opposed to being the revolutionary Che Guevera, Banderas connects with us in the audience while being swept up in the events within the film.  Jonathan Pryce is solid in the thankless role of Evita's husband, Juan Peron.

901221,4,6304504039,"I read every review and found some of the comments interesting. The calls for Mandy and Patti were ridiculous. This is a story about a woman's life from youth to death at a young age. Neither of the two actors called for, except for Mandy perhaps, could have done that. They're too old. I saw Evita on the London stage and I recall the great actors that originated the roles. They were good but they wouldn't have been able to do this movie in 1996. Age matters in characterization.
Antonio brought ambiguity to the view of Evita: hate, love, sexual attraction. He's a beautiful man and a great and brave actor. <check out his Spanish roles if you don't believe me> He was the right Che because you could believe he got his hands dirty with work as opposed to other actors who have done Che. He is a blue collar man growling out his passionate view of a woman who got spared in characterization in this film. She was a crooked witch and that should have been made clear. Antonio's role is the closest thing to insuring that in the movie.
To say he can't act is a slam that is hard to accept when you consider what he has done in his career. I hope he indeed is up for the Phantom role for film. He's terrific in what he does and if he's beautiful to look at too, that's icing on the cake.

She gives a stable enough preformance, I actually forgot this was the same woman who sang ""Like A Virgin"" as she lay as Evita on her death bed. But then her limited vocal range brought me back as she passionatly, yet flatly cheeped out ""You Must Love Me."" Antonio Banderas I'm sorry to say was rather overratead, he started out as a Che, a bitter Argentinan who happened to express himself by singing but by the end of the movie he was just Antonio Banderas trying to hard to act. Thank God for Jonathan Pryce, the man has an amazing screen presence as Peron and carries the movie from the moment he enters.
 The movie starts with a long SLOW funeral scene where Antonino Banderas sings, save 10 minutes and fast forward. The story truely begins with Eva Duarte, a girl who leaves the small town to make it big in New York... I mean Buenos Aires. It goes on to tell how she becomes famous by (ahem) using men of higher and higher status until finally she winds up marring the soon to be dictator of Argentina by telling him that she will be ""good for him."" And the rest is history. Not to morally judge the story but no wonder the girl died of cervical cancer.
 The begining of the movie is slow and Alan Parker does a poor job of protraying the state of the people in Argentina (hey, I can only watch Banderas get beat up so many times.) The movie did not visually support the amazing soundtrack. I was left bored, confused and unsatisfied. But the soundtrack is great (you can do other things while listening so it doesn't waste your time) and I give it two star ONLY because of Pryce's preformance.",974764800,3,1703,4.352201257861635
901225,5,6304504039,"I never saw the stage version of Evita. I did listen to the Broadway CD and couldn't get hooked until I saw the movie. And what a movie.
Madonna gives a fine performance in this role, and I honestly can't think on an actress out there that could have given a better performance as Evita. I think Alan Parker intentionally took advantage of Madonna's experience in music video to make the movie version of Evita as fast paced as a music video album - and it works remarkably well. No, it isn't the stage version. This movie stands on its own. Yeah, Madonna is emotionally distant, but she was obviously playing up the real character's narcissistic qualities to the hilt. I think the emotional distance let's you understand how corrupt and manipulative the Peron's really were. You are fascinated by Evita and admire her drive, but see a balanced picture of her - not a saint by any means.
Besides the great photography and editing, the sound of the DVD version of this film is something worth going out and buying a surround sound system for. The songs have never sounded better, the orchestra is wonderful, and there are moments in the soundtrack that make your hair stand up on edge.
Parker slowly builds up to the famous balcony scene where Evita sings ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina."" I have never really liked that song, but Parker and Madonna put it in a context where you almost want to stand up and cheer. Suspend disbelief is an understatement. Parker gets the audience caught up in the spirit of revolution, of Argentina, and of the masses. I haven't experienced anything like that since seeing a live performance of Les Miserables.
My only criticism of the movie would be that Parker failed to take advantage of putting any real dance sequences in the film. Most significant was the Buenos Aires sequence where we see Madonna riding a train when she should have been dancing her brains out.
Madonna helped mix the soundtrack - she should have won on Oscar or Grammy for that alone. The big surprise was how well Anthony Banderos sang as Che. His voice stands up to any singer on Broadway. Jonathan Pryce give a fine performance as Juan Perron. There are no real special features to speak of, which is a real disappointment. But I can give this five stars with a clear conscience because of the fine performances, the stunning widescreen presentation, the quality of the video, and great mix of the soundtrack. This is the best screen version of any of Andrew Lloyd Weber's work to date.",973123200,15,2493,4.655328798185941
901226,5,6304504039,Evita is a favorite show of mine. This is a fantastic story of a fantastic woman. The movie has been done very tastefully. Madonna has portrayed the part wonderfully. The music is superb. This is one DVD that one would enjoy over and again. It is a pity that Madonna did not get an academy award for this movie.,973036800,,311,4.288135593220339
901227,5,6304504039,"""Evita"" is more of an opera than it is a musical, which is to say that unlike ""The Sound of Music"" or ""Fiddler on the Roof"" you do not have any scenes with spoken dialogue.  Such scenes are important in those particular film versions because it is through dramatic action rather than songs that the seriousness of the Nazi occupation or the Tsar's pogroms are brought home to the audience.  But even without such opportunities Alan Parker's film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's ""Evita"" is a beautiful spectacle that is as well grounded in history as it is in the songs.  Darius Khondji's luscious cinematography is as much the star of the show as the music, whether he is depicting the grand pageantry of Evita's funeral or the stark figures of two people dancing a confrontational waltz.  You will want the widescreen version of this film.
The real Evita Peron has always reminded me of Marilyn Monroe, in that I never really thought either woman was particularly attractive in the photographs I saw of them.  But when I saw actual film footage of either Evita or Marilyn (the original stage production of ""Evita"" did this especially well in the Rainbow Tour sequence) I could immediately tell these women had ""it.""  By such a standard Madonna is an apt casting choice.  Her singing is not quite up to the score, but it is up to the character of Eva Peron.  Besides, the fact Madonna managed to convince the President of Argentina to let her sing ""Don't Cry For Me, Argentina"" from the balcony of the Casa Rosada pretty much tips the balance of judgment in her favor as far as I am concerned.
Ironically, given that I insist on characterizing ""Evita"" as an opera, I am arguing that unlike a performance at the Metropolitan Opera the voice is not the primary consideration in evaluating the performances.  Antonio Banderas is certainly the most pleasant surprise in the film, and his performance as Che Guevara needs to be seen as well as heard because it is more a matter of the actor's attitude than his more than adequate singing voice.  Jonathan Pryce underplays the role of Juan Peron more than his theatrical counterparts, but that is certainly more in keeping with the tone and tenor of the film.
Alan Parker was the perfect choice to direct this film, since his resume includes both reality based musicals (""The Commitments,"" ""Fame"") and dramas (""Mississippi Burning,"" ""Midnight Express"").  The controversy over how much credit Oliver Stone deserves for his screenwriting aside, the adaptation of the stage version is superb.  The use of two ""new"" songs (one is from the original studio album with the lyrics changed to cover the growing unrest in Argentina instead of Che's dream of inventing a new insecticide) helps to transform ""Evita"" from a theater piece into a cohesive film.  Critics of the musical have argued ""Evita"" is a glorification of fascism, but there is less reason to make such a charge against this movie, where political slant of the film slowly but surely strips away the pretense of the rags to riches story.
The DVD version, while as excellent a pairing of picture and sound quality as you are going to find, has el zippo grande in the way of extras, which is an absolute shame.  It took longer for the film version of ""Evita"" to be made than it did ""Gone With the Wind"" and the story behind the making of this film is almost as interesting.  There will features about the making of ""Evita"" that could have been included, as well as the music videos or some mini-documentary on the real Eva Person, and certainly the commentary of the director would have been especially interesting given the storied history of this production.  Hopefully we will see such treats down the road.",970617600,8,3723,4.748837209302326
901228,4,6304504039,"Watching the movie of Evita was my first real experience with the musical, and that puts it in a different light for me, I suppose, than with many others.  The points I make, though, I still think are valid.
The casting of this movie was quite good...the stars of the show pulled off their roles magnificently.  Antonio Banderas, in the lead as the narrator, Ch, sung surprisingly well.  He also acted out the part superbly.  While he's no Colm Wilkinson, there's an undeniable charm to his portrayal.  Even with the abbreviated material he's given to work with, he pulls it off with style, which says something for a role with magnificent performances by Colm and by David Essex.  He's not vocally better than either, but he plays the part to a T, and his songs seem HONEST.  Also, he's a better Ch than Mandy Patinkin, but I suppose anybody who tried to actually play the part would be.
Madonna is the surprise of this movie.  She sings quite well, and given the rock feel of the show, is fairly appropriate for the part of Eva Peron.  She's also visually very similar to photographs of Eva, and looks very convincing after the scenes where she is supposed to be young.  However...the point of the musical is that Eva Peron is a manipulative (rhymes with witch).  Madonna scared me here by seeming VERY sympathetic to her character.  Still, her performance is excellent, if not up to Antonio Banderas's.  Jonathan Pryce put in an outstanding performance as Peron, too.
A caveat emptor:  the musical was actually made less harsh for the movie version, so that it could be filmed in Argentina.  It was very nearly worth it...not entirely, mind you, and the addition of ""You Must Love Me"" seemed entirely out of place in a musical about a man and a woman who mutually USE each other.  Still, her ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" was manipulative to the audience just as the speech was meant to be to the crowd.  And the two Ch tours de force, ""Oh What a Circus"" and ""High Flying, Adored"" are more or less in tact, and done wonderfully.  The re-adaptation of ""The Lady's Got Potential"" was excellent, and ""And the Money Kept Rolling In"" was toned down a lot, but Banderas had a LOT of fun in the number.
The movie's worth seeing if you like Evita, or are thinking you might be getting into it.  Don't watch for Madonna's big numbers, watch for her and Banderas performing, for once, like they really mean it.",969840000,,2402,4.570093457943925
901299,5,6304504039,"As their third musical, Rice and Lloyd Webber tackled the then unknown saga of Eva Duarte de Peron. Thanks to the original concept recording and the London/Broadway stagings, EVITA became a world-wide hit. Who would eventually direct and star in the film version? OK...before you can say, ""but why Madonna?"" you must give the film a chance. While watching the film, I was completely mesmerized and captivated by Madonna.  Not once did I think or imagine her as the ""material girl"" (although Eva herself may have been the original material girl).  Antonio Banderas is handsome as the characher ""Che"" (not Guevara).  He, IMHO, represents the people of Argentina...their sentiments towards Eva...his kiss of the coffin in my interpretation is Argentina saying goodbye; she may have been controversial, but even the sceptical probably admired Eva Peron.  The film is epic in scope and recalls the heyday of the film musical. The orchestrations are lush and, as friend of mine would say, ""perfected for the screen.""  And the inclusion of a new song, ""You Must Love Me"" to the score is wonderful.  EVITA on stage is a masterpiece...bold and daring and different.  EVITA the movie is a gem.  It is a remarkable piece of film-making and enhances any research on the real Evita. As it having no dialog...remember, it is an opera...and that is a story told through song.

901300,2,6304504039,"Musical version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1970's musical hit that showcases the life of Argentinian first lady Evita Peron. What might have worked on stage does not work here; it comes off more like an extended music  video.
Peron moved up the social ladder by sleeping her way to the top,  and she is an interesting character. She charmed and fascinated her people,  yet repulsed them by supporting her husband's fascist regime. Madonna sings  very well and her costumes are great (she reportedly had to change costumes  85 times!) and Antonio Banderas also sings well as Che, a sort of  narrator/voice of the people/conscience who seems to be everywhere.  Jonathan Pryce, who sang on Broadway in the original production of Miss  Saigon, does nicely as Juan Peron, who knows the power of his wife, and  knows that even in their marriage, he is not loved as much as she loves her  people.
As well meaning as the film is, it is simply boring. With barely  any dialogue, we are swept from one song to another without knowing these  characters as much as we should. A nice idea that would have better been  left on stage.

901301,5,6304504039,"What can I say? Evita is a great film, that was wrongly underrated by both the audiences and the Academy (Evita got only one Oscar). I think this film is a true work of art, and if you never see the film, you will be missing  out on a superb work of cinematographic art -  One of the greatest  qualities of this film is that it does not excessively stray from the  original material (And when it does, it does so in the right places).  Andrew Lloyd Webber's great score gives this film the musical beauty that  made the Broadway production a hit almost thirty years ago. The script  contains the classic Tim Rice trademark - the ambiguity in characters. It  does not allow the viewer to say ""Aha - she's good!"", or  ""Aha - she's bad!"". There is plenty of evidence to support both  sides, leaving the viewer thinking about Evita even after seeing the movie  (How many other movies do you know that make the viewer think?).  As  for the cast, I think the actors performed surprisingly well. I further  think Banderas outdid Pattinkin. I'm sure Mandy's fans want to bite my head  off (or think that I lack one), and to them I say this -- The day I hear  Mandy perform ""sing you fools"" with enough emotion to make me  snarl with anger at communist dictatorships for days after seeing the film,  I'll change my views. True, Madonna is not a vocal superstar like Patti  LuPone, but considering that she performed the same role as Patti, with the  score transposed only one step down - all during a pregnancy, I think her  performance is rather commendable.  The cinematography itself is  stunning - There is not a single frame in the film at which you can say  ""What the heck are they showing me that?"". Every shot is well  planned and contributes to the plot and the mood of the film.  The  bottom line - see this movie. You won't regret it.",961632000,,1836,4.402985074626866

Before I saw this film someone told me that every scene in this movie could be a photograph.  And,  after seeing it, I couldn't agree more!  Truly beautiful, rich and  delightful.  A treat for your eyes.
Madonna plays Eva Paron...a poor  bastard daughter of a married man.  She wants to suceed in life and begins  to let men help her climb the ladder to social sucess.
Antonio Banderas  plays the narriator.  It was funny to see him so serious after seeing him  in his previous work.  His voice is excellent for his part.
Madonna is so  believable in this film. And I was glad she was chosen for the part.
Eva finaly meets Paron, they marry.  He uses her to gain political  support (as the people love her)  She uses him to climb lifes sucess  ladder.  I do believe they did love each other.
The music is excellent.  Almost everyone has heard the following popular songs from this film, You  must Love Me...and Don't Cry For Me Argintina""
A warning to viewers  who don't like musicals:  Almost he whole movie is done in song.
Evita on  video is also a great cost saver.  It would cost at least that or more to  see it on broadway...and with the video, you can watch it whenever you want  to. If not to buy Evita, rent it to see it...beautiful work.",959385600,2,1368,4.477551020408163

After I saw the movie I saw the play  when it came to my town, and it's just as good maybe better. I think some  of the scenes in the play should have been in the movie, I think some of  the things the movie left out would have been great on screen. Like the  part where Eva is dying and she sees images from her past(past scenes from  the play), that would have been wonderful if Eva could have seen images of  her old self and people she came in contact with on her way to fame, but  they left it out.  I also think they shouldn't have let Eva sing  ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"" they should have just let the  mistress sing it, having Eva sing it confuses things, did Magaldi dump Eva  like in the movie or did she dump him like in the play, I don't know but  either way the movie is really good and I highly recommend it!",952473600,,1159,4.048458149779735

Madonna has to carry the picture. Can she act? Well, she  can sing and act at the same time, and that's good enough for me.  What keeps this salsa-tinged soap-opera afloat is an ingenious device that  comes in the form of Che (Antonio Banderas), a South American everyman:  he's a waiter; he's a reporter; he's a revolutionary. He provides the story  with a conscience. And let me tell you, this story needs one. Eva and Juan  Peron (Jonathan Pryce), you see, captivated a country desperate for  stability in the late forties. Argentina under their leadership was, in the  end, arguably better off but definitely better looking.
That attention  to style also seems to be the aim of director Alan Parker. His eye for the  visually operatic is flawless here. Whether she is handing out ill-gotten  money to the poor, or standing on a balcony tearfully protesting her  worthiness, Evita (and Madonna for that matter) is one of the best at  stroking and stoking the emotions of her people. Parker presents this  seduction marvelously. Overall, Evita casts a charming spell, but the core  of Evita the woman remains a mystery. Maybe it's better that way.",951091200,,1312,4.820627802690583

How can anyone say that she is not a good actress? My God, her whole public  life is performance art! No one could have done this movie as well as she  did; she and the real Eva must have been kindred spirits. I can't wait  until Madonna shows the world that she is still a great actress with the  release of Next Best Thing.",949017600,9,471,4.2
901308,4,6304504039,"Boy do people miss the point on this movie. You can't present a movie like a broadway show. Everytime this has been attemped, historically, the results are bad, most adaptions of famous shows are only OK at best, some  are awful.  The medium is totally different, the demands are different,  the singing is different, the acting style is different. Yes, the shows  usually are ""better"", in a sense,  that's how it was originally  written, as a stage play. You have got to really change things to make a  successful movie.
So how good an ADAPTION is this?  Very good indeed.  The story was changed to very effectively fit the medium. Madonna stretched  herself unbelievably to do this role, and I think she did very well. You  may quite validly prefer the stage version of Evita (I like both), but its  almost like apples and oranges. As good as Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin  were, they would, if they played it the same way anyway, come off mannered  and absurd in a movie context. All the conventions of the stage would be  laughable. (unless it was simply, of course, an actual filmed stage  production). On the other hand, Madonna and Banderas are not nearly strong  and polished enough for a stage. Most of the changes (a few I don't  understand), make a lot of sense, when you consider how a movie has to  flow.
As for this movie not being deep or historical, its a musical for  Pete's sake, not ""Saving Private Ryan."" I don't know enough about  Eva Peron to really say, but I don't see how you could present a real  historical drama in a musical context. I think the problem is people don't  like or understand opera, which this essentially is. Most of the great  operas have ludicrous story lines! Also if you are going to go in knowing  you ""hate"" musicals, ""hate"" Madonna, then fine, this is  not to your taste. Banderas is not a polished singer, but his rough edged  singing is very appealing and effective in this context.
The  cinematography, costumes are outstanding, and serve the story well. Only as  the dying Evita, do I find Madonna not very believable. I think Evita is  thrilling, its one of my favorite movies of recent years.
I love the show  Evita, and I love this too, but in a very different way.",949017600,87,2224,4.554430379746836

However, it is a wonderful musical.  Antonio Banderas and  Madonna are perfect and they both do a wonderful job.  As do all the other  characters.  The person who played Peron (forgive me for forgetting his  name) was wonderful as well.  I am in love with Andrew Loyd Webber's work  and I am happy to be able to say that the producers of Evita did not do  Webber an injustice.",945907200,5,540,4.237623762376238
901377,5,6304504039,"I generally haven't been too impressed with Madonna, but I think she was excellent as Evita.  She has the same raw ambition and has exploited her attributes, especially her sexuality to the utmost.  Her personality was  juxtaposed into Evita's character in a very intriguing way.
My problem  with many historical biographical films is the dialogue.  I constantly  wonder how accurate it really is.  This musical format takes that  irritating element out, and brings things to a more primordial level, where  the emotional flow is tied together only with sketchy details.  To me, this  tells the story in a more intense and believable way.
The  cinematography was breathtaking and the way that sequences were rapidly and  surrealistically woven in and out also heightened the intensity of the  experience.  The always-changing scenes and costumes also added to the  film's incredible visual appeal.  Anyway, all I can say is that I really  enjoyed it, more so the second time than the first, when I had time to  appreciate the clever details.",945561600,5,1041,5.089285714285714

901379,5,6304504039,"As I read the posted customer reviews, I realize how most opinions of the movie are based on the opinion the reviewer has of Madonna. I have seen this musical on broadway 11 times and think Madonna gave an outstanding  performance. One can't compare a live performance to a film. However, the  movie does portray Evita has a caring woman. This element shouldn't have  been changed just to film in Argentina. Madonna has an outstanding voice  for this role and I would like to see her on broadway. Enjoy this for the  movie that it is and don't base your jaded opinions based on Madonna's  reputation. She is EXCELLENT. When she was dying, I felt the pain. Her  version of ""Don't Cry for Me Argentia"" was tremendous. She has a  strong voice and used it well. Unfortunately, most opinions of the movie  where made before even seeing the movie. These are not reviews but only  authors thoughts of Madonna.

901381,5,6304504039,"I saw this movie when it first came out and loved it, and just saw it again on video. This is one of the most under-rated films of the decade. Hollywood just doesn't  like Madonna, which resulted in this  wonderfully-acted film being unfairly snubbed by critics and the Oscar  establishment. Despite the presence of half the population of Argentina as  extras, this is essentially an intimate story that rides on the  performances of the three principals--Evita, Peron, and Che. Although  Madonna's voice isn't quite up to some of the vocal challenges, her  performance is otherwise on the mark. Antonio Banderas surprised me--his  somewhat gritty vocal quality is totally appropriate to his character as a  peasant revolutionary. Nobody smolders better. His feelings for Evita were  intriguingly ambiguous; it was fascinating to watch him veer from hope to  contempt to something close to sexual attraction. And Jonathan Pryce is one  of the premier musical theater artists of this era. What he does with the  rather underwritten part of Peron is a joy to see. Watch his performance of  ""She is a Diamond""--two minutes of subtle, superb acting with  voice, face, body--absolutely wonderful. It seems that most of the  naysayers saw the show on Broadway and find the movie a poor comparison.  Each should be taken on their own terms. Patti LuPone is undoubtedly  stronger vocally than Madonna, but you have to give the latter credit for  taking on a huge challenge and (mostly) pulling it off. And I never thought  Mandy Patinkin's light tenor was right for Che--Banderas, though not half  the singer Patinkin is, has an earthy vocal quality that works better in  this role. I recommend this movie highly for all lovers of musical theater.",941673600,36,1739,5.028070175438597
901382,5,6304504039,"The movie was thought-provoking and inspirational.  I especially enjoyed the intrigue surrounding an ambitious young woman during that era.

Regarding  Madonna's performance, I only saw the character of Evita and was not  consciously aware that I was even watching Madonna! Every detail was  convincing.  The music, the costumes, and the scenery were wonderful.  And  I absolutely love the soundtrack.",941414400,,546,5.380952380952381

Finding a balance between Anti-peronist and peronist views  of her is hard. Why Faye Dunaway did a movie called Eva Peron,a boring  4-hour Anti-Evita film. And this movie shows how Madonna found great depth  in this role and did an amazing job! Working her a*# off! Oscar was not  granted to her,she has a golden globe and like many other great women of  the Twentieth Century like Garbo,and Dietrich. Madonna has proven  herself,and if Oscar never comes. She should continue to act so as to  acheive a lifetime acheivemant award. A death award! Bringing back the  medium of Film Musicals is a brilliant idea and CHicago is a good idea.

7873824,4,6304504039,"I never saw the stage musical and put off seeing the movie because I feared it would just be a loooong vanity piece for Madonna, and through her Eva Peron.  Obviously I was wrong.

I had no idea that Antonio Banderas' role was to constantly criticize the Perons throughout the movie.  He steals the first half of the movie with the score's most powerful songs (""Oh What a Circus"", ""Goodnight and Thank You"", ""The Lady's Got Potential"").

Eventually Madonna/Eva have their moments of triumph as Eva campaigns on Juan Peron's behalf, culminating in the resounding ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina.""  Ultimately Eva falls ill but gets to have a face-off/dance-off with Antonio lashing back at his (unfair?) expectations of her (""Waltz for Eva and Che"")..

I had to research whether Antonio is really playing Che' Guevara.  The character is simply called Che', but in reality he was too young to have interacted with the Peron government and supposedly never met Juan or Eva.  I found a letter or transcribed statement from Juan Peron upon Guevara's death.  He questions whether Che' was actually anti-Peron and generally praises Guevara as being of similar political stripe to himself.  In the film Banderas' character clearly equates Peron with the fascist Mussolini.  (Many clearly disagree with this characterization, perhaps with good cause.)  Regardless, the character is cleverly woven throughout the movie as a well-placed observer, as either a waiter, janitor, program emcee, reporter, or as a general man-about-town.

Well worth watching if you've put off seeing this like I did.",1525046400,2,1580,5.149019607843138
