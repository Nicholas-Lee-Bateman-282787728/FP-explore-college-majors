8016518,4,B0001UZWMA,"Fresh-faced Sharon Kelly stars in two Harry Novak productions.

In The Dirty Mind of Young Sally, Sharon plays a radio sex show host.  She runs around in her broadcast band with a faithful engineer trying to raise money for her sister's operation while staying one step ahead of those who want to shut her down.

Teenage Bride has Sharon playing the other woman.  A loser is married to a beautiful woman but prefers Sharon next door.  While he is neglecting his wife, she gets it on with his step-brother.  Things get more complicated when hubby decides to hire a private detective to catch his wife in the act.  The end might surprise you.

Harry Novak productions are known for going about as far as they can and still remain soft-core.  Plenty of full-frontal views and closeups spice up the stories.  Sharon Kelly really adds a lot to the first film as she is the star, but even as a supporting roll manages to steal the show in the second.  Definitely worth checking out.",1093564800,29,976,4.583815028901734
