What I liked the most in it was the performance of the actresses; Gretchen Mol and above all Emily Watson give outstanding performances that should lead you to see at last once this film.

3526859,2,B001D7T6AY,"I recently watched ""The Memory Keeper's Daughter"" because I had always wanted to read the book but never got around to it, so I thought the movie would be a good substitute.  I was wrong.

This made for Lifetime TV Movie feels more like half a story than a full movie.  At points you can see that there is a good story that underlies the film, but the script doesn't take the time to develop the characters or explore the emotional aspects of the story, and without these pieces you can't make a really great film.  Instead, the movie is paced like a TV show, quickly jumping between key events with little or no plot or character development.  You are left wondering why certain characters act as they do as the story quickly moves to the next plot point.  The movie also has a high made-for-TV cheese factor, with plenty of over acting and dramatic music.

I wish the ""Memory Keeper's Daughter"" had received better treatment--writing, directing, acting, etc--because I really do think it could have been a good film.  I'm still interested in reading the book, even though I was soundly disappointed by this adaptation.",1225152000,2,1120,4.678571428571429
3526860,2,B001D7T6AY,"THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards was a highly successful bestseller and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation.  So what happened when the novel became a made-for-television movie?  Perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay (oops!, teleplay!) by John Pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story. Perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by Mick Jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation. Perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the 'liquid tears' musical score by Daniel Licht. For whatever of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel-to-film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with Down Syndrome.  And for that it is worthy of attention.

Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy.  On a stormy winter night in Kentucky Norah goes into labor and the Henry's rush to a nearby clinic where David delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the assistance of his old friend, nurse Caroline Gill (Emily Watson).  After the delivery of a perfect boy child (Paul) Norah continues to be in labor and (surprisingly...)  delivers an unexpected (!) twin girl.  David and Caroline immediately recognize that the little girl (Phoebe) is a 'mongoloid' (this is before the use of the term Down Syndrome) and David, having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect) decides to send Phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged: Caroline is to make the delivery and Norah is told the second twin died at birth.

Caroline follows instructions, sees the conditions of the 'home' where Phoebe is to be deposited, shrinks in horror, and decides to keep the child.  Aided by a friendly trucker, Caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers Phoebe, finding a new life in her trucker's Pittsburgh.  Norah insists on a formal funeral for Phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs David's psyche, and the Henry's life goes on with only the one child Paul, leaving submerged pains about the lack of Phoebe's presence.  Norah gifts David with a camera ('peoples lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured by a moment') and David becomes obsessed with photography.  Norah grieves, drinks, and loses David's attention, while David traces Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh.  Paul (Tyler Stentiford to Jamie Spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelities and is angered about his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and off to Juilliard he goes.  Meanwhile Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl, and the manner in which the broken marriage of the Henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe's and Paul's lives  coupled with the courage that has supported Caroline Gill's struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with Down Syndrome forms the conclusion of the film.

The cast of well-known actors tries hard, but only Emily Watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script.  Jamie Spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with much promise.  Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver. The film is a mess, but the message about acceptance of Down Syndrome children and adults is an important one.  Grady Harp, October 08",1223769600,14,3762,5.05663430420712

Starring Dermot Mulroney, Gretchen Mol, and Emily Watson, it offers a very positive portrayal of a girl with Down Syndrome.  In a world in which the majority of children diagnosed with Down Syndrome in utero are aborted, these positive portrayals are desperately needed in order to help change hearts and minds.

In 1964, Dr. David Henry (Mulroney) delivered his wife's twins. His son was born healthy and normal while his daughter was born with Down Syndrome. Dr. Henry has experience with Down Syndrome - his younger sister had it and died at an early age from a heart malformation. He saw his mother's heartbreak and does not want his wife to suffer the same fate. His wife is unconscious at this point and he makes the quick decision to hand over his daughter to a nurse, Caroline Gill (Watson) to be taken to a home. He then tells his wife that their daughter died.

When the nurse goes to the home, she is so horrified by what she encounters that she can't leave the baby, instead choosing to move away and raise her herself. The movie follows the two families over the course of the next twenty years- the Henrys slow implosion as Dr. Henry suffers under the weight of his secret and his wife never recovers from her grief of a daughter lost, contrasted with the beauty of the growing Pheobe thriving under the care of her adoptive mother.

While this movie is unrated, it is intended for older teens and adults. While there are no sex scenes, adulterous relationships are part of the story. The acting is also slightly uneven in parts. Nevertheless, the pro-life message of this movie that all life is valuable and precious makes it one worth watching. Gill's fight to gain educational rights for her daughter is also inspiring. She exhibits much faith and determination and works hard to help her daughter become all that she can be.

The Memory Keeper's Daughter will foster much discussion and will definitely tug at your heart. If you have not already seen it or read the book, I highly recommend adding it to your ""to-be-watched"" list.",1346544000,,2195,4.6909090909090905
3526978,5,B001D7T6AY,"This movie is sooooooooo good!  I was hooked from the very beginning.  I didn't realize this was a made for TV movie for lifetime.  Now, I am really impressed.  The acting is exceptional.  The actress that played the nurse was the best.  I just borrowed this movie from the library and am so glad that I did.  I have never come across a story like this one.  I'd definitely recommend to others.  It was the perfect pace, never slow or boring, and the ending is just beautiful.  My favorite scene is when the little girl is watching her brother play music.",1324080000,,555,4.405940594059406

3526981,4,B001D7T6AY,"I saw this movie on lifetime well before I was pregnant with my daughter. I loved it, it made me cry, and it made me happy. I thought it was wonderful. I did not read the book so I can give an honest opinion without comparing them. Now that I have my wonderful 7 mo. old daughter (who has down syndrome) I love it even more. I hate it when people say that ""it's mediocre"" or ""it's not as good as the book"". Of course it won't be, movies made from books are never as great as the actual book because they have to shorten it to make the movie. I will eventually read the book, but the movie gives a delightful story, and I think the actors did a fantastic job. I would recommend the movie to anyone. I absolutely loved it!!",1320624000,,721,4.048951048951049

3526984,3,B001D7T6AY,I thought this was a good film with a good message.  It was sad though and had some upsetting language and themes.  Certainly not for children.,1313798400,,143,4.461538461538462
3526985,5,B001D7T6AY,"I love to read a good book, but only get to do it two weeks a year when I'm on holidays, so I only read books people have read and referred to me as excellent.  A lady who reads a lot that we holiday near suggested The Memory Keeper's Daughter, so I got the book read a bit but just wasn't getting into the story fast enough to hold my interest and went on to read books from a favourite author.  Months later I noticed when setting my pvr to tape programs on the tv that in the early hours of the morning here was The Memory Keeper's Daughter, I was thrilled as I wanted to watch the movie that had been referred to me from a reliable source and it mean't I didn't have to find time to spend hours reading, well I couldn't move away from the screen and all I can say is you have a heart of iron if you can walk away from this movie not touched in the heart and feel affected by what you have seen (growing in understanding of things that may not have touched your life). A great book/movie club look, lots of possibilities to talk about choices, secrets, grief, living with our decisions, fear, twin connections even if not living in the same house, disabilities does that mean a beautiful life can't be had, that despite its adversities love and joy can be found and felt. Watch this movie with someone who likes a movie with substance, you will LOVE IT I promise.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Memory-Keeper-s-Daughter/dp/B001D7T6AY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Memory Keeper's Daughter</a>",1312848000,3,1538,4.713754646840148

3526987,4,B001D7T6AY,"This movie is based on the novel by Kim Edwards of the same title. The story is set in the 1960s and involves a doctor, David Henry, whose wife, Norah, goes into labour during a snowstorm. Unable to get to the hospital, he takes her to his surgery, where his nurse, Caroline Gil, assists with the birth. Norah delivers twins, a boy, Paul, and a girl, Phoebe: the boy is perfect, the girl is obviously mongoloid. Convinced that his wife will be unable to cope with their daughter's disability, he tells Caroline to take Phoebe to a children's home, and later tells his wife the baby did not survive. Caroline, unable to bring herself to leave Phoebe as instructed, takes her away to another town and decides to bring her up as her own daughter. This is a very moving tale, which loses none of its impact by being made into a movie. Whilst a movie can never totally encompass a book's content, the movie plot is quite faithful to the book. Casting is excellent, especially Emily Watson as Caroline and Krytsal Hope Nausbaum as Phoebe.",1308355200,,1032,4.553763440860215
3527011,2,B001D7T6AY,"No need to stress the point further as I think the other reviewers have done a good job. Same; I have read the novel and was really compelled and fixed on it as soon as I started getting deeper into it. The movie was indeed terrible, and left out SO many crucial key points in the book that led to the [unsettled or not] conclusions at the ending. Actors were okay, but the way the plot was laid out; ugh!

Not worth it. Rent it from a library or something, but read the book first. So please buy the book and support the author instead of contributing to the movie industry that made an award winning book a mess.",1289088000,3,614,4.159663865546219

3527014,5,B001D7T6AY,"I just finished watching this moving on Lifetime. I found it moving and heartfelt. I thought the acting was well done. And like one of the other reviews, it brought tears to my eyes. Frequently when it's book to movie, the movie is usually less and different than the book. If you haven't read the book, then this is a good movie. Now my debate is whether or not I should read the book.",1253404800,,386,4.22972972972973

I watched it first and it really was very close to the book!  I think the girls will enjoy it!  It didn't have the heart of the book but it kept its integrity.  I think folks who haven't read the book will also enjoy it!,1237766400,2,385,3.8227848101265822
3527016,2,B001D7T6AY,"Like many other reviewers here, I loved the book and was anticipating the screen adaptation. To my utter disappointment, this Lifetime movie version was just a hack job, and did a complete disservice to the wonderful work in was adapted from.

The movie leaves out major characters and plot threads, and made me feel like I was watching a disjointed movie. That is what this movie is - disjointed and confusing. There is no real character development and because so much of the original novel has been deleted or changed, we are left with unanswered questions and puzzlement as to why some characters behave the way they do.

I would recommend reading the book first and if you like it, then you'd probably want to skip this poor excuse of an adaptation. I hope someone will eventually give the novel the right cinematic treatment it deserves.",1237248000,3,843,4.767123287671233
3527017,1,B001D7T6AY,"I was very disappointed with this movie.

I never read the book, but because of the poor reviews here, I will. However,I just watched this for the second time on TV and loved it (again).Yes, it's ""cheesey"" as one other reviewer put it but no more so than many,many other made for TV movies. I like ""cheesey"" or as I'd rather say ""sappy"".I'm not looking for a blockbuster of a movie on Lifetime. It's the type of movie you'd expect from them. I did have a few tears run down my cheek at the end.( sappy )If you're looking for a great production...look elsewhere but if you want the type of movie Lifetime puts out....go for it.
