8560813,5,B00B1HHO64,This is either a 4 star or 5 star DVD. I went a head and gave it a 5 star because there is so much anti-Christian reviews on Amazon. I figure that at some point this DVD will need an extra 5 star review to counter any HATE reviews that may appear some time in the future. This is more of an intro to logic DVD that uses The DaVinci Code to teach Logic reasoning.,1511568000,,362,3.84
8560814,4,B00B1HHO64,Good  - pretty much confirmed what I already knew (thought I knew).,1447027200,,67,4.583333333333333
8560815,5,B00B1HHO64,This is number 7 of the 8 DVDs in the set. We see that Michael often fails to agree with most of Dan's misuse of logic and  is a good guide to the DaVinci Code. You can't go wrong if you stick with Michael.,1388016000,2,206,3.6818181818181817
