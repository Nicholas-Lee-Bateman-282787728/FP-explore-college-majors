2526195,5,B000EOYRVK,"I'm a pretty advanced exerciser. I've done Yoga for about 11 years, Pilates for several and have weight training experience since I was in my late 20's (I'm almost 48). I also finished a P90X rotation last year and work with many of Tony Horton's programs as well as Debbie Siebers and a variety of others so I am very experienced with working out at home with these types of programs on DVD/VHS.

I have fairly recently started working with the Stability Ball and  have just absolutely fallen in love with it as a superior fitness tool! Prior to this program I have done many other really great ball workouts by Suzanne Deason, Liz Gillies, Gin Miller a 10 minute Solutions as well as some others as well.

I just received  did Accelerated Core Training yesterday (I bought it via amazon marketplace) "" and did it for the first time this morning. I was thoroughly impressed!

The program is exceptionally well designed and Gunnar does a great job leading the class. His explanations of each exercise are extremely clear and easy to follow! I also think it's great that he had a modifier to show folks less advanced versions of the exercises.

I also like the way he does the exercises in a circuit format so that you are always rotation among different body parts. This makes it possible to give each exercise 100 percent without becoming overly fatigued in one area.

 The workout flew by at 45 minutes because it was so enjoyable while plenty challenging at the same time. What I loved is that I felt strong and energized afterwards rather than depleted and beat up. I have learned that one doesn't have to beat themselves up to benefit greatly from exercise. Rather it's consistency over the long haul that leads to great results both from a health standpoint as well as visually. Workouts like this, that are challenging enough yet fun make it easy to stay consistent.

So for those looking for a great full body workout, what I would consider a functional fitness workout, then I would highly recommend this!",1196121600,24,2014,4.666666666666667

8112458,5,B000EOYRVK,"Gunnar Peterson is a great trainer. I really like how he does not bark at you and he actually works out with you. The exercises are not hard to do and when you are done your feel Great.  I have several of his DVD's and I use every one of them, by rotating them every day. You will not want to work out with anyone else once you try Gunnar.",1394668800,,339,3.842857142857143
8112459,2,B000EOYRVK,"It's ok for beginners.  Once you get use to the exercises, it's time to rotate the DVD with another.  You don't use the ball as much, so if you love being on the ball, I'd pass on this DVD if I were you.",1297728000,3,203,3.697674418604651

Although this workout my be easy for the more athletic, it may be more difficult for the average person.
