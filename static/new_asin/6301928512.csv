377831,2,6301928512,"I purchased this DVD in March 2016 and i was so excited that it now finally ""appeared"" to have 2 optional ways to order it. One option which clearly looked to be compatible by the picture and description with the US format,  which is what i ordered. The other option showed the UK format logo, so i made sure not to choose that one. When i received the DVD it would not play in my DVD player and stated my machine was not compatible with the format. I looked all over the sleeve of the DVD and still could not find anything that said it was not compatible in the US and could not find anything. Needless to say I was very disappointed and annoyed that it was not made at all clear through the purchasing process. I did return the DVD and received my full credit but it would be appreciated if Amazon changed the option for this particular product to only the UK format because it is completely misleading to the consumer. I will continue to look for this DVD from other suppliers in the hopes it will eventually come out in the US format for real.",1466121600,5,1047,4.261306532663316

As for the Awakening Land, I haven't watched it yet. But hopefully the DVD will be fine and I'll be able to watch the entire mini series.

377940,5,6301928512,"For all those that have problems in USA with DVD in PAL format
I have the same problem in Europe with the USA format so I learned something
There are DVD devices that have the indication ""MULTIZONE"" or ""NO ZONE""
On these DVD devices you can play also zone 1 (USA) also zone 2 or 0 (EUROPE)
You can track these dvd devices looking at the technical revew , it is written if the dvd device is ""multizone"" or ""no zone"". You can also see the device type by looking at the kind of TV system supported (PAL=Europe or NTSC=USA or both). If the NTSC is present , this is the supplimentary indication for ""multizone"" or ""no zone"".
The second posibility is to go with your dvd device to a laboratory to upload the ""multizone"" posibility on your device. It is a simple procedure that is made by any authorised specialist , it is a codec program like on your computer.
The other posibility is transfering the dvd thru a specialist that can put the dvd from the PAL format to the NTSC format , preserving and according to the copywrite laws.
Success !!!",1335312000,17,1039,4.360824742268041

377944,5,6301928512,"""Delie and Brenton"" was the German title for ""All the Rivers run"" and German TV did not air the sequel :(.
I'm glad it's finally available on DVD and fortunately with a multi regional DVD player it's no problem to be watched in the US as well. I wonder why there still is no system worldwide available for DVD's, so that they can be watched all over the planet no matter what continent you happen to live.

I watched this Australian TV series first on German TV, then read the novel by Nancy Cato on which it's based.
This was for sure one of my favorite Australian TV shows, but ""Adventures of the Seaspray"" and ""The Magic Boomerang"" (mid sixties) were even better. I wish both would be relased on DVD as well!!! They are long overdue.

I wanted to purchase the movie but was told that the VHS Tape was unavailable. I had to contact a company that specializes in locating hard to find movies. I wanted it that much. They contacted me when they had found the movie and quoted me a price. I ended up paying full price for the VHS Tape.

I was so happy when I received the VHS Tape and as they described it was brand new! It was still in the original packaging and the VHS Tape had not been opened since I had to break the seal.

Then it gets manufactured and sold like that, with many not even knowing what their missing! First its on VHS with deletions, then DVD with deletions. Why bother to re-market it at all?
Someone should return this beautiful Australian masterpiece, to its full 8 hour uncut version, and market it the way people remember it from 1983? I don't think the manufacturer had the best interests of the film in mind at all.
This was an adventure that did not just take place on the river, but in the lives of many people that make up the community.  A willful sad young girl matures into a woman of great artistic ability and strength of character, mastered from the things she suffered. Its also about the important people in her life, who often spend their opinions much to quickly. Soon they come to see she is a person to be reckoned with! I came away feeling like I was leaving home when it was over. I never knew a river could be so dangerous or make changes so fast. But this boat called the Philadelphia, was to me, so much fun!

It is available in Region 0 format, which will play worldwide. However, even that version is edited down to 293 minutes in length from the original.",1130112000,14,406,4.5
378007,5,6301928512,"I rate All the Rivers Run with 5 stars.  Yet I purchased the DVD version that is available from Australia, and just like the VHS version, THIS DVD HAS LOTS OF SCENES DELETED OUT OF IT TOO! For example, the scene where Deli visits her uncle Charles to ask him to give her away at her wedding is deleted, along with many other scenes.  Why is this? When I saw ATRR on HBO cable, it was complete.  So looks like this DVD version is just as crummy (because of the ediing) as it's VHS counterpart.  The only thing that makes this DVD better than the VHS are the behind the scenes looks, and interviews with Sigrid Thornton and John Waters.",1125273600,14,634,4.258333333333334
378008,5,6301928512,"There seems to be a 2-disc edition on DVD in Australia;the cover states that it contains all 6 episodes,and interviews with Sigrid Thornton and John Waters. The included information states that it is for zones 1,2,3,4,5&6. I found it on EZYDVD.COM.AU,and have placed an order,although it is marked as ""currently out of stock"".

Anyway,good luck to you all.

378009,5,6301928512,"""All the Rivers Run"" is a beautifully done mini series. I give it five stars because I have seen the COMPLETE version on HBO TV. However, I later made the mistake of purchasing this VHS version.  For no logical reason I can think of, a HUGE chunk of All the Rivers Run has been deleted in this VHS!  I returned it for a refund afterward.  I don't understand why the editors were stupid enough to edit over 100 or so minutes from this wonderful movie.  Sigrid Thornton and John Waters are excellent, and the story truly unique and terrific to watch.

There are two things which are truly sad here:  1) The video version has been edited so much its pathetic and 2) The HBO (or whoever) studio won't release the COMPLETE, UNEDITED version of this lovely miniseries on DVD.",1092441600,41,769,4.457142857142857
378030,1,6301928512,"I fell in love with this miniseries while playing on HBO back in 1980-something and even though it doesn't fall in to the ""my kind of movie"" category, I would have to say that it is one of the best epics I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying... A few years ago I saw this miniseries for sale and jumped at the chance of owning it and being able to see it whenever I wanted instead of waiting for it to be on tv. Unfortunately, to my surprise and dissapointment, it was the long awaited epic movie alright, except, OH NO! WHERE IS THE REST OF THE MOVIE???
 An important piece of almost every sceen had been....DELETED? I was so dissapionted that I almost sent it back, but for fear that it would be the only chance of owning it I kept it. I give the original version of this movie 5 stars. This one I would have to give a -0. If the original version of this movie is ever released, then, and only then will this great story be worth getting!",1026432000,62,941,4.14207650273224
378031,1,6301928512,"I watched the original broadcast on HBO years ago, and recorded it for my own personal use.  Unfortunately, over time, my tape has deteriorated such that it isn't very watchable any more.  I've been waiting for it to come out on tape or DVD and was very excited to finally find it.  I watched it the moment I received it and discovered, to my dismay, that it had been cut beyond belief.  Entire scenes had been removed as well as small portions.  Even the wonderful soundtrack was deleted from the ending credits! The original production was ~ 375 minutes in length. This tape is 274 minutes.  Over 100 minutes removed! If you are familiar with the mini-series, parts I'm talking about are when Delie goes back to the farm to ask her Uncle to give her away at her wedding. That entire scene was deleted.  You never understand why Ben comes to join them on the Philidelphia because you never see the rundown farmhouse.  Also, when Ah-lee, the cook, shoots the deck-hand and runs off into the wasteland, the crew looking for him and his return, all cut out!  It's so bad that one minute the deck-hand was slugged by Brenton, then the next scene he is being thrown off the boat, with his head bandaged, never to be explained.  It's absolutely despicable.  Quite a few other scenes were removed as well, this just gives you a sampling.
I returned the video, completely disgusted and hoping that, someday they will release the ENTIRE production to be enjoyed by all.",1010880000,81,1461,4.602316602316602
