8708863,5,B00UZT0XVC,A wonderful film from Norway. Excellent performances from everyone in this fine film. The story focuses on the turbulent life of a little vibrant girl named Kamilla in post WWII Norway. Her parents run a clothes cleaning business to get by in a rough situation where money is tight. It doesn't help Kamilla or her mother's ordeal that her father is having an affair with the hired help in the form of a young good looking girl. Her parents are constantly fighting about money and infidelity. Kamilla tries to stay optimistic and obviously enjoys spending as much of her time in the company of her little boyfriend to cope. I find that watching this beautiful film from Norway along with other European films shows how filmmaking should be done compared to the trash that's been coming out of Hollywood in what seems like for decades!  A multi-region DVD/Blu-Ray player is required to view this DVD as it is in the PAL recording format. Just to experience films like Betrayal (Loperjenten) makes it worth making an investment in a multi-region disc player.,1440806400,,1055,4.828729281767956
