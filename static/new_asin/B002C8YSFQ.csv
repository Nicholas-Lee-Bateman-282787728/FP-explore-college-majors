3905340,5,B002C8YSFQ,"This novela was the best novela I have seen in years.  Everynight we would rush home to see it and not only that friends of mine were watching it too.  All the stars did a great job and the villan Daniel.. is something else.. so evil.. yet so good!  A fabulous actor!  Eduardo Yanez & Adela Noriega as well as Jorge Salinas, Pablo Montero, Nora Salinas, Ninel Conde, Diana Bracho, Joaquin Cordero were all great in it.  Practically every episode had a cliffhanger, also the priest was good too.  The beautiful settings in Cholula, Puebla Mexico and the storyline were fabulous, don't miss out!!",1256515200,,594,4.663461538461538
3905341,1,B002C8YSFQ,"No tengo idea sobre que pasa con estos productores, tienden a escoguer las mismas ideas e historia para producir una novela que ya fue hecha. Este es el caso en esta telenovela-aparenta ser la misma historia de ""pasiones de gavilanes"". Asi, que el que la vas a comprar tiene que estar pendiente a este pequeo detalle.",1251849600,4,317,4.678571428571429

3905354,2,B002C8YSFQ,"Fuego en la Sangre (Fire in the Blood - or Burning for Revenge - 600 minutes)

Eduardo Yez's appeal escapes me, but he clearly is the darling of stage and screen in Mexico. This big guy plays the older brother to three siblings, the youngest of which is a teenage girl who falls in love with (and is impregnated by) an older married man with three daughters older than she is. The vile husband of one daughter kills his father-in-law and then later, when they discover she is pregnant...his young girlfriend.

The brothers swear revenge and decide to court the three young women, then break their hearts.  Yez plays Juan, Jorge Salinas plays Oscar and Pablo Montero plays Franco. These three fellows pair up with Adela Noriega as the much-abused Sofia, Elizabeth Alvarez as fun-loving Jimena and Nora Salinas as the poetry-loving Sarita. Their evil mother Gabriela is played with domineering strength by Diana Bracho, while Guillermo Garcia Cantu plays the unapologetic Fernando: married to Sofia, bedding Gabriela and the murderer of sweet young Libia, played by Sherlyn.

As we can expect in a telenovela, the tables are turned and the three young men fall head over heels for the three young women. Then the fun begins.

This condensation omits a number of key scenes that are alluded to later, has choppy editing, poor acting and a lame, contrived script. Other than Salinas, for whom I was watching, everything else was a let-down, so this one will never be a favorite. Lo siento....",1398643200,,1488,4.865612648221344

3905358,5,B002C8YSFQ,"These soap operas or novelas are interesting.  I like the fact that these novelas are complete and without any interruption and to the point.  They are well spoken and well acted.  No one referred me to buy this novela but I like Adela Noriega whom I have seen in other novelas and she is just great.

3905362,4,B002C8YSFQ,"I loved this telenovela so much.  It was the first one that I watched beginning to end.  I only understand/speak a little bit of Spanish, but I was still able to follow the story with the help of Google translate and referring to Wikipedia's entry about it.  I missed some of the nuances, but I understood enough to know I loved the story and the characters.  Sophia got on my nerves sometimes with all her crying and carrying on, but the rest of the characters were great.  Diana Bracho and the man who played her new younger husband were the best villains I have ever seen.  I thought they were the ones that really made the story so good.  The musical numbers were superb too.  I know it wouldn't be possible to show every episode on a dvd, but I wish they could have balanced it out a little more instead of focusing everything on Juan and Sophia.  I'm waiting for one of the Mexican channels to show this telenovela again.  I know they rebroadcast old ones, because I'm watching Sonadoras right now and it was made in 1998 and 1999. Btw, I am really enjoying it too.",1347235200,,1071,4.363636363636363
3905363,4,B002C8YSFQ,"Despues de mucho tiempo me decidi a Comprar este Dvd. Sinceramente no lo habia hecho antes porque le habia dado prioridad a otras Historias y a Comprar otros Titulos que estaba ansioso por tener, por otra parte ya conocia la Telenovela Original que fue la de Pasion de Gavilanes, la vi en Television ademas de Comprar el Dvd.
Hoy que ya tengo casi todos los Dvds que queria en Mi Coleccion y que estoy a la espera de los Proximos Lanzamientos Compre Fuego En La Sangre, espero que el Dvd valga la pena, que a pesar de estar muy resumida contenga Lo Mas Importante, las Mejores Escenas. Espero no arrepentirme jeje.
Me Gusta Mucho el Elenco de esta Telenovela, sobre todo Adela Noriega, Jorge Salinas y por supuesto tambien Diana Bracho, es una Gran Actriz, yo la vi por el Canal de Las Estrellas asi que me dare cuenta que es lo que contiene y lo que le falta.
Cuando lo tenga y vea les cuento que tal esta el Dvd y el Resumen...
8/11/2011: Me Gusto Mucho el Dvd, Contiene un Buen Resumen con Lo Mas Importante de la Telenovela solo que me hubiera gustado que los Discos fueran de Mejor Calidad, con la impresion de las Imagenes de los Actores, como son ahora y que hubieran puesto 4 Dvds en lugar de 2, pero comprendo que lo hayan hecho asi al haber sido el Primer Dvd bajo el Slogan de Telenovelas Populares. Por otra parte Me Molesto Mucho que en la Portada diga que son Ms de 10 Horas y atras 600 Minutos cuando En Realidad el Dvd Tiene una Duracion de 9 Hs y media Aproximadamente.
Lo que me di cuenta es que Suprimieron las Actuaciones de Cristian de La Fuente y Sofia Vergara, no aparecen en el Resumen, tambien vi que quitaron muchisimas Escenas Importantes, como por ejemplo muchas de las Peleas de Gabriela con sus Hijas, tambien falta mucho de Oscar, Jimena, Sara y Franco, la Historia se centra mucho en Sofia y Juan, dejan poco de los demas.
En el Disco 2 del Lado 2 todo pasa muy rapido, lo cual se nota que faltan muchas cosas, el Final de Rosario y Armando esta mal editado, no se ve cuando Fernando los mata, solo en un Flashback mas adelante, cuando el le confiesa al Padre Tadeo que los asesino.
La Portada esta linda pero podrian haber incluido a Jorge Salinas y a Elizabeth Alvarez, ellos no aparecen y me parece injusto ya que son mas importantes que Pablo Montero y Nora Salinas. Eran la Segunda Pareja de la Telenovela despues de Juan y Sofia.
Sin ser eso, lo demas esta muy bien, Me Gusto Mucho y Lo Recomiendo!!!",1320192000,,2438,4.372246696035242
3905364,5,B002C8YSFQ,"I loved watching this ""soap opera"" on TV. I followed it from beginning to it's end and was excited that I found it on Amazon. Com. The idea of having it available to share with my friends was just great. The drama, dress atire, scenario, and romance in this romantic tale was awesome.  Worth purchasing. The only problem I encountered was the disc arrived scratched.  However, Amazon. Com intervened immediately and corrected the problem.  I am Happy. Maria Sears",1312848000,,463,4.8354430379746836
3905365,1,B002C8YSFQ,no vale la pena! Esta novela es una adaptacion o refrito de la novela original de Pasion de gavilanes y a fuego en la sangre le anadieron muchas cosas que el dvd no tiene. En realidad no vale la pena!!!!,1306540800,,203,4.1
3905366,1,B002C8YSFQ,"If you have not seen this telenovela some parts may be hard to keep up with.  The editing is very bad in this film.  Some major points were edited out of the film.  I was very dissappointed with this DVD.  I watched the telenovela on TV and knew on the DVD alot would be cut out, but way more was cut out.  The DVD is mainly the love story of Sophia y Juan very little on Sarita y Franco, and Jimena y Oscar.",1298851200,2,408,3.8674698795180724
3905367,5,B002C8YSFQ,"A very well written novela. The scenery in Mexico is breathe taking. Some of my favorite actors were in this novela and as usual they played the parts so realisticly. American soaps do not even come close to the spanish novelas, because they have a beginning and an end.",1294876800,,270,4.530612244897959
3905368,2,B002C8YSFQ,"There were a lot of scenes that were cut, for a person watching this for the first time, they would have been confused with the story because of the scenes that were not there. This is a great telenovela but it was butchered",1277942400,8,224,4.232558139534884
3905369,1,B002C8YSFQ,"This DVD is a mess. I know I was buying a incomplete DVD, but to cut out over 95% of the story  makes no sense. I would have paid for a bigger DVD set. The story line makes no sense. If  you didn't watch the story on television you will never understand it...all the good story lines are missing, the singing, songs  and dancing that happened during the soap are also missing. Don't buy this if you want to keep remembering what a wonderful story this was.....its not worth it......",1268006400,17,482,4.333333333333333
3905370,5,B002C8YSFQ,"This movie comes in only 2 DVDs this makes you think it is not complete but it is complete because the DVDs are dual layer, in other words is like having 4 DVDs.

This is a very good soap opera, I recommend it.",1263081600,9,210,3.883720930232558
3905371,1,B002C8YSFQ,This is a bad remake of Pasin de Gavilanes that just doesn't stand up to Pasin (I never saw Las aguas mansas but I think that's probably much better than Fuego en la Sangre).,1259798400,,174,4.147058823529412

8363620,3,B002C8YSFQ,"The main reason I wanted to see this was Sofia Vergara was listed in a bunch of episodes. Unfortunately for me (and anyone looking to see her), the DVD cut her character out entirely. I knew it would be a possibility. You can still see clips of Sofia Vergara on youtube from the show. Considering every one of the Telenovelas released on DVD I've ever seen were ""abridged"" versions. (Which is also unfortunate for me because watching them long after they aired and not speaking Spanish well enough well enough to understand without English subtitles, this is the only way I can see them, on US DVD)
I didn't feel like the edits were too confusing, except on the final disc side 2 where it appears they cut the majority of material from. I did enjoy the story enough though and would re-watch it again if they released the full version. Which I doubt they will considering the release history of Telenovelas.
I've also noticed that a lot of the actors are the same in the Telenovelas I've watched. In this, Eduardo Yez and Sherlyn play brother/sister. And in ""Amores Verdaderos"" they play Father/daughter.",1492128000,,1104,4.695876288659794
8363621,5,B002C8YSFQ,Trying to learn Spanish?  Tela-Novelas are perfect. This was my first but far from last. I even bought the cd. The music is fun to dance too:),1486080000,,142,4.2592592592592595
8363622,1,B002C8YSFQ,"This was a huge disappointment. The editing was so fierce in order to condense it, that the storyline hardly made any sense and scenes would jump in a flash from one scene to the next with no thought for storyline continuity.

I began to watch this Telenovela while I was in Chile for a period of 4 weeks and all of which I saw was over  and done with (edited) in less than 20 minutes.  Some storylines I saw in Chile were not even included in the DVD version.  I feel it's a rip-off to condense the storyline to such a degree that it becomes a joke.

I will not be buying these telenovelas again.",1484265600,,597,4.156521739130435

8363624,2,B002C8YSFQ,I bought this DVD and literally they skipped everything. It was hard to understand what was going on. Especially part b of the DVD a complete rip off . I don't like to leave bad reviews but I had to on this one. Not worth buying . 2 stars for the beginning of the DVD being decent. But they still cut lots of stuff in the second part. Don't buy.,1483056000,2,345,3.942857142857143
8363625,5,B002C8YSFQ,"A touch of romance, a slight hint of comedy, and lots of drama and excitement. In the end, all the evil doers paid for their evilness. I loved this movie.",1470614400,,154,4.166666666666667
