3746915,5,B001PCJG2A,"This DVD set is simply A-M-A-Z-I-N-G ! If, like me, you enjoy watching documentaries about other Countries/Cities/cultures then you really need to add this Set to your collection, trust me you won't be disappointed. This is a 6 Disc Set for a total of 14 hours of interesting documentaries. Everything about these documentaries is great: The footages are amazing, the narrator is great and the music is just perfect. Don't listen to people who claims the quality of the footage is not great, I think they need to buy a better TV ( or glasses ). The documentaries covers so many different cities/countries/subjects, it's really impressive. Disc 2 is about the wildlife, while disc 5 is a series of documentaries about mysterious places/the Paranormal, it shows how so many different subjects are covered in this set. This might be the best DVD set ever released by Questar, I highly recommend this set to anybody.

3746916,5,B001PCJG2A,I was thoroughly impressed with the beauty of the photography.  It took over a year of travel to make this and more to narrate and produce.  It's well worth the money.,1346803200,4,167,4.354838709677419
3746917,5,B001PCJG2A,"This DVD set, Must See Places of the World is really worth watching. The photography
is first rate and spectacular, and the narration and music is exellemt. I cannot understand the problem that T.N. of Maryland has with the video quality. Possibly he has a bad TV or more likely he needs an eye examination--maybe new glasses or glasses period. I would highly recommend this DVD set from Reader's Digest and Questar.",1280793600,8,416,4.791666666666667
3746918,1,B001PCJG2A,The picture quality is terrible. Looks like it was transferred from VHS or some older technology. I'll stay away from Reader's Digest videos from now on.,1249430400,11,153,4.923076923076923
8333017,4,B001PCJG2A,"While it is a good set there are to many repeats, it is like watching the same more than once",1495756800,,93,3.7
8333018,4,B001PCJG2A,Is pretty interesting to watch and informative.  I bought it to use with my son's Geography course so it was nice to see places and cultures he's studying.,1434585600,,155,4.535714285714286
8333019,1,B001PCJG2A,Grainy footage. I cannot decide if these are old videos that have been repackaged with a newer copyright date or if they have been burned onto the lowest quality DVDs. It is a pity because the locations are interesting. Even the credits are hard to read. Very disappointed in this product. I do not recommend them.,1425513600,2,314,4.625
8333020,4,B001PCJG2A,"It's good, but not the best.",1423008000,,28,3.8333333333333335
8333021,4,B001PCJG2A,I like this documentary.,1408406400,2,24,5.25
8333022,5,B001PCJG2A,Good,1404691200,,4,4.0
8333023,5,B001PCJG2A,Enjoyed this very much.  I would recommend it.  This makes you want to visit the each of the places personally.,1391644800,,111,4.5
8333024,3,B001PCJG2A,"A few of these DVD's are wonderful.  Journey of a life time is a great way to visit places not seen in person.  The filming is great.  But most of the other DVD's talk about how old things are ie millions and billions of years.  it works well for our family because we talk about the falsehood of the ""theory"" of evolution.  but if you are a Christian and believe the Bible you will be correcting the talks as you watch this with your children.",1388880000,9,444,4.176470588235294
8333025,5,B001PCJG2A,"This set of DVDs cover different areas of the world. I will summarize disk 5: Mysteries of the Ancient World, which includes the story of King Arthur and Camelot as well as Stonehenge, two stories which interest me. I recommend two DVD sets for further information on the legend of King Arthur: ""King Arthur's Britain"" by Francis Pryor on Acorn Media and ""In Search of Myths and Heroes"" by Michael Wood on PBS Home Video. For Stonehenge, I recommend ""Stonehenge Decoded: A Lost City Revealed"" by National Geographic and ""Secrets of Stonehenge"" by NOVA.",1383609600,6,552,4.882978723404255
8333026,3,B001PCJG2A,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the viewing of this DVD leaves a lot to be desired.  It's just not fun to watch.  The images aren't clear; they're somewhat fuzzy.  We have a big screen TV and maybe this has something to do with it, but nothing else we watch is like this.  Actually, we only watched the section on New Zealand.  This set was a gift I bought my husband.  We weren't interested in watching the rest.
