5559637,5,B00B6DTFOC,"Simply put, this was a wonderful story! The animation, the characters, the emotion- Great! I truly enjoyed it!  The personnel journey of the main charactor and the how the ""voices""really made it come alive.  I would say not an anime for the younger generation (as most aren't anyway) maybe 12+ as they way it deals with suicide- we don't get second chances, but by potraying the needs and desires of all around him and the ""importance"" of his own life- can make anyone feel more that just for themselves and how important each life is!- Excellent!",1379289600,2,547,4.6875
5559638,4,B00B6DTFOC,"It's tough being a kid when you're different and introspective. This story is set in modern Japan, but really could take place anywhere. There are no car crashes or mecha or magical girls, but there is a quiet, insightful story that unfolds slowly, centered around a young boy's suicide. A family unravels and comes back together again, like a glued-together dish, cracks now obvious. A nice addition to my anime collection I will watch again.",1378598400,3,443,4.92
5559639,5,B00B6DTFOC,Watched it thought it was a good for adults. Had a good story line and anime well drawn and lot of extras.,1378512000,,106,3.8636363636363638
5559640,4,B00B6DTFOC,"This movie really surprised me. It starts out very surreal and different; you are watching things from the main character's point of view, rather than looking at him, and you are welcomed into a sort of in-between place for souls to go before they move on after death. You are quickly stopped by a small boy who informs you that though you don't remember it, you have committed a terrible deed in your life and you are now given an opportunity to return to life in the body of another and redeem yourself. No, not just an opportunity - an order. This is a mandatory task. And so what can you do? You go.

The story sort of sucks you in there. The main character is placed in another's body - the body of a boy called Makoto, who has recently committed suicide - and must learn what he can about the boy's life in the hopes that he will remember his own and reform. However, the trials and ugliness of Makoto's life soon depress him and he becomes almost nonchalant about his mission. The people he interacts with and the experiences he has are sometimes rather disturbing, at least for me personally. This film is not rated, and while I think it could get by with a PG because there is nothing explicit actually shown, I would venture to give it a PG-13 because of the mature issues it deals with. However, the beauty of the film is hardly lessoned by this content - rather it is strengthened. I always appreciate it when a film or book is honest about life, rather than making it appear all sunshine. Makoto would not have committed suicide if his life was perfect and clean. And so it isn't. Which makes the journeys of each of the characters, and mostly of the main character, far more real and meaningful.

This movie is about finding the value of yourself, your life, and others. It is not a gentle story. But it is rewarding at the end. A wonderful film, with lovely animation, appallingly real characters, and a message about life that is well worth hearing.",1377734400,11,1965,4.4404432132963985
5559641,3,B00B6DTFOC,"I must cite the Critic's Corollary on this one. While there are some beautiful skies and other backgrounds, the use of CGI was ham-fisted and obtrusive. I am at a loss to understand the *animation* awards this movie has received.

The story is watchable, but simplistic. I had figured out the ""twist"" barely five minutes in and spent the rest of the time just waiting for that shoe to drop. After the build up of all the awards decorating the slip case, I expected more than the preachy sermon on ""tariki"" at the end.

THE SKY CRAWLERS is a similar film in many ways, from its concept, slow pace, and sometimes grimace-inducing mix of CGI and cel animation, only THE SKY CRAWLERS is much more cathartic and rewarding.

COLORFUL is too bland to bear such a title.",1376784000,5,762,4.547445255474453
5559642,5,B00B6DTFOC,"The Main character finds himself at the gates of Heaven only to be greeted by his ""case working"" who explains that he will get a second chance at life but will be put in to another persons body, a person whom has just passed away themselves. The unimaginable complications from being put, all of a sudden in someone's body and not nothing anything about their previous life, but having to act as them adds an element of fun to a touching and very honest story.

The Movie has a wide variety of emotion to go around and the story progresses and ends on a humbling note leaving you feeling a little lonely but very appreciative of life's greatest gift.",1370736000,20,650,4.46218487394958
5559643,5,B00B6DTFOC,"I just finished watching this masterpiece and felt the need to talk about it.

First: this film is for mature audiences only.  No, it doesn't have explicit sex or violence, but it does deal with sensitive subject matters.  I'll talk a little more later in the spoiler-ish section later if you want to know more.

Great slice of life movie dealing with life and death and second chances.  There are elements that I definitely can relate to while watching this.  Some understanding of Japanese culture may help in the viewing such as suicides being a common thing and pressures of being middle school student.  There are definite heart breaking moments in the movie but everything seems natural, realistic and not forced.  The animation is absolutely beautiful with the level of details showcasing everyday life in suburban Japan.  The movements were also very fluid and natural.  There were scenes when the animation were semi photorealistic feel when they were showing old photos of past moments.  It's hard to describe so just see for yourself!  Definitely worth checking out.

SPOILERS BELOW

I was definitely surprised by the maturity of the themes.  The movie's synopsis already states suicides but it also includes prostitution and bullying.  There's more than a few moments when I cried (yes I admit it...it's that moving).  One major plot point is the Makoto's realization that his actions do affect others.  Another is acceptance that's it's ok to be who you are.  There are times when we really don't know who we are and are confused, but that's extremely normal and part of growing up.  While watching, I kind of got a feeling of the twist coming and they hinted it when he was able to draw really well, but that didn't detract from the movie because it's all about Makoto's self realization and having more awareness of your interactions and surroundings but changing his perception of his place in life.",1368748800,72,1915,4.906542056074766

5559660,1,B00B6DTFOC,"After the tl;dr coming up this is going to be spoiler heavy, you've been warned.
TL;DR: Go watch It's a Wonderful Life instead of this.

Before we dive into the movie let's take some things into consideration - first, I'm all for bad movies. I think it's fun to watch B-rated schlock like terrible 80's action movies. This also doesn't mean I can't appreciate an amazing film when I see one, like your classic Casablanca, Citizen Kane, etc. You'd think this movie, with so many prestigious awards, would be at least worth watching once.

Boy, was I wrong!

Movies that deal with depression, in my eyes, come from two different types of people. Now, I can almost say with 100% confidence that there isn't a single human being on this planet who has not considered killing themselves. This is something we've all thought of and come to grips with in one way or another. This is where two different types of people come in to play; the ones who consider it, say ""no I don't really want to"" and move on with their lives. The other, considering their home life, social life, among other factors, let this little thought continue to snowball and grow until it becomes THE conclusion to how their life should end, by their own hand. This used to be me, and I feel like it can relate to others who suffer as well. Every little mistake or something YOU perceive as a mistake, it may be small in the grand scheme but it's almost like a sin to you alone. If you haven't already seen it, I recommend watching through Evangelion, the TV series through to the last movie. This is work where you can see true depression coming from the author toward the end of it's run.

This is where we come in to our movie.

A soul departing for the afterlife is picked up by his guide who says he gets another chance at life. We meet Makoto, who just died, now coming back to life with this new soul. As the movie progresses, we learn the soul has no recollection of who it used to be and needs to adjust to this new life. We start finding out Makoto was a social outcast, a girl he has an interest in is a prostitute, and his mother was having an affair.

Then we start seeing change in Makoto. This is when we find out Makoto has a newfound ability; he has found His Balls.

For a few brief moments anyway. You see, if I were some new soul in an old body trying to or possibly making amends with my past, I wouldn't give a crap about how the old me was perceived. There were multiple times Makoto was alone with his mother, could have a serious conversation about why he did what he did and how he knew, but forgets the power of His Balls and pouts around making her feel like s*** until he finally let's her in on knowing about the affair, ONLY to pout and run away from it more. Meanwhile while making his mother feel terrible he goes to school and with the power of His Balls makes a new friend, wowing his classmates that he can even speak up unlike his old self.

Makoto loses the power of His Balls in the art club when someone tells him ""oh you usually sit in the corner alone and paint"". Isn't he a new person at this point? Why not join in with the others? No, he sits in the corner and stares at his horse painting. Can you imagine this as a fellow art club member? Wow that guy who keeps going missing from school is staring at his blue canvas with a horse in the corner of it for days. Is he going to shoot our school up?

Bear with me, I'm probably jumping scenes because as I got halfway through this movie I was just hoping it would be over soon.

Makoto gets the s*** beaten out of him and is held up in his room. A socially awkward girl arrives and suddenly Makoto gets a boost from the power of His Balls to sexually assault and bully this poor girl. Hang on, before you dismiss me as a SJW nu male hipster whatever, I love my fair share of anime and it's power to fan service and not give two s***s about the Western feminist movement. But this entire scene, just to have this character assaulted and bullied, was completely out of character for Old Whiny Makoto and Makoto with His Balls.

Then we talk about trains for ten or so minutes.

At one point before this (remember, jumping scenes because of how bored I was) Makoto follows his prostitute girlfriend to the love hotel he found her at originally. We have a flash of the power of His Balls, he grabs her and they run away together in the rain from the hotel. Will Makoto finally use His Balls to convince this girl that the life she is leading may not be the best for her? Will he finally say ""Listen girl, you're lucky I'm the one that found out, anyone else in school would tell everyone else and make your life hell. Girl, you're too beautiful for this, I know you're a gold digger but you are more than that to me baby,"" etc etc. Suddenly Makoto loses His Balls and lets her go back to the hotel to continue being a whore. And that's really all we get out of it until the last ten or so minutes of the movie when it's still not cleared up anymore anyway.

Makoto never really realizes the full potential of His Balls and finally figures out that he, as his soul, was actually the old soul of Makoto before he killed himself. Like I mentioned before, he saw his whore friend and mother hanging around the love hotel, is bullied, and then kills himself to come back to this point.

Look, I understand movies can't always end with a little bow on the top and make everything wonderful for the main character. In fact, some of those types of shows where they can be considered cliff hangers or characters are in more despair than before (psychological thrillers for example) are some of my favorite types of stuff. But this movie, the entire premise, fell completely flat on it's face and could have done SO much more. Even as someone who has been fighting deep depression and demons just about all their life, I couldn't make any connection to the characters in this. This is the only movie I've taken from my blu ray disc drive, put back in it's box, and immediately threw away in the trash.

5559672,4,B00B6DTFOC,"There are so many spiritual oriented animated films out there, this post is just the first of many! One of my favorite things about anime is that the most far out plot arcs are introduced in a very matter of fact way and Colorful is no exception.

The beginning of the film finds our protagonist in a gloomy afterlife weigh-station waiting to get in line. A sort of purgatorial gloom sets the opening scene,  everything here is hazy, muted and slow moving. We have a soul who has recently died and we find out is guilty of some sort of major infraction in his past life. He's approached by a young boy named Parapura who the protagonist thinks may be an angel. Parapura tells him he's won a sort of soul lottery and is going to get another chance at life by taking over the body of a young boy named Makoto he recently committed suicide by ingesting his mother's sleeping pills. The protagonist wakes up in the hospital as Makoto surrounded by his family who thought he had just died and has now come back.

Makoto's life leading up to his suicide is complicated. He's bullied at school for being small. He has a crush on a girl who he discovers is prostituting herself to buy clothes and jewelry. The same day he discovers her entering a hotel with an older man he sees his mother leaving with her dance instructor. All of this is too much for Makoto who decides to end it all.

Now the protagonist is living as Makoto after being ""revived"" from the suicide. This is his chance to redeem himself and earn another rebirth. If he fails Makoto will die again. Much of the film is about relationships, especially that of Makoto's immediate family. He can't bring himself to forgive his mother, his brother is aloof and distant, and his father, although cheerful and easy going, is distant in his own way.

This film is really worth watching. I found myself nearly in tears quite a few times. It's a wonderful story of redemption, friendship and family. Highly recommended!",1448668800,,1969,4.535211267605634

5559684,2,B00B6DTFOC,Definitely a lot different from Wolf Children. Good plot but there's absolutely no conflict. What is the importance of this?,1446336000,,124,5.25
5559685,5,B00B6DTFOC,"I have to say I'm shocked by the reviews saying how Colorful ""is not for children,"" as if the fact that it is an animated film would imply this. No, it is not a G-rated feature- in fact, it is PG-13- and is not for children nor people who would be sensitive to the subject matter.
Slight SPOILERS ahead, although I assumed the main plot point before watching Colorful (though I'll admit it threw me for a loop a few times, and that's impressive).
The main character committed a sin and, once in the afterlife, wins a lottery to return to Earth and try to live life again- against their will. They awaken in the body of a young boy who committed suicide for reasons that remain unclear until the movie is nearly over, but the reason for it is not shocking or extravagant. I feel like it was a good choice to present the point this way. This is all you really need to know about the plot.
I watched this movie because it kept showing up in my recommendations. I actually had very low expectations, and instead I was blown away. The movie was very down-to-earth despite having one minor character who is considered a sort of spirit guide or guardian angel; there is nothing inhuman about this person, nor about the apparent entrance to the afterlife, which I enjoyed as a more unique take on it. The animation was incredible. The scenery was absolutely beautiful.
The only scene that left me confused and rather bored was the scene where the main character walks the historic train lines with his new friend, but I can still see the purpose of such a long scene. I just think the point could have gotten across much quicker.
As many complaints here state, the most frustrating part of the movie is how badly the main character treats his ""new"" family. The mother had an affair, and he is especially cruel to her. Like, extremely cruel, even when she is trying to be very kind. The main character is on the young side and has other issues going on in his school and personal life. If the boy who committed suicide was the spirit still in this boy's body, we would probably have more sympathy. But because this main character does not remember this family, we're left confused about why it's so hard for him to forgive this mother. While I agree he is cruel, I think it ends up making sense in the end. Plus it made me feel very strongly and gave an edge to the character, even though I do not necessarily respect that edge.
The ending is what got me. The main character does learn his lessons. In a scene where his ex-crush is caught preparing to ruin the painting the past boy created, we see the very first breakthrough, despite every time the main character has been disappointed.
This girl wonders why she's so strange, saying she loves beautiful things, yet also has the urge to destroy them.
The main character says she is not strange; in fact, she's so normal, it's almost disturbing. He says that people have many colors, many emotions, and many sides, whether we appreciate them or not. They make us human.
I think about this part of the movie all the time since watching it. The message was so effective and delivered so well. The song they chose to play in the background also made me cry, I will admit that.

As long as the subject matter is not a huge problem for you, and you are prepared for a slow-paced, realistic slice-of-life movie, I think you will be just as impressed and touched as I was. Give it a shot.",1444867200,,3423,4.441971383147854

5559737,1,B00B6DTFOC,"Watching this film is a very unsettling experience, very especially if you know immediately where Makoto's coming from, which can only be true if you've been there. I have, and given the weight of the subject matter, the film's carelessness and outright absurdity is especially difficult.

The true problem of the film is that it does almost nothing to develop the central character, Makoto, or anyone around him, in any truly meaningful way. It's easy to get the idea that the entire point of the film is the unveiling of Makoto's world--his character, the characters around him, his family, and in essence, the idea that there's a lot more to Makoto's life than we are first led to initially believe.

But, incredibly, this fails to happen. Makoto's world is, in fact, exactly what it seems. The great revelation then becomes somewhat unclear. The given, which you know from the start, is that The Soul (let's just call him that, the anonymous soul that inhabits Makoto's body for a time) has no memory of his own past life, and no knowledge whatsoever of Makoto's life.

He's given a very brief rundown by his ""guide"" Pura-Pura (sp) of why it was that Makoto killed himself. You get a few very basic and unexplained facts: He has a crush on a girl who he had seen walking into a shady motel with a middle-aged guy, and he assumes she's prostituting herself, though no reason is given. His mother *was* having an affair, and no other details are given about that. It's quickly learned that Makoto is a leper at school, harshly ostracized and very much an isolate. The rest is to be determined in the rest of the film...

...or so you'd be inclined to think. This is why everything ends up falling apart by the time it touches all the bases: The Soul is pretty much dead-on in his initial generalizations and assumptions, or we don't really get the chance to see the realities of the lives of others.

His crush is indeed prostituting herself, exactly as described. When pressed for a reason, she says it's so she can buy expensive things, ""like a girl should have.""

Don't bother waiting for it. That's about all you learn. Her motivation is revealed in one encounter, and no other motivations are present. But I certainly had some questions after the encounter they have: What did she mean by ""like a girl should have""? According to whom? What is her home life like? Why does she either feel the need to resort to such measures, or lack the general moral idea that prostituting oneself for these things is personally demeaning? Why does she feel the need to have these things so badly? Who's judging her? If it's herself, for what reason does she believe that?

But, like all the other questions brought up, that's it. What you see is all there is, according to the film. No deeper explanation really exists. Sure, she comes back at the end of the film with a glimmer of shame, but no actual exposition into why she is the way she is. The viewer, I'd imagine, is kind of owed at least that much. Same with his mother's affair, or his lack of friends, or the other non-existing details of his ""unluckiest day ever"".

Even his suicide itself isn't really touched on. We're told, somewhat ostentatiously by Pura-Pura, that Makoto had at the very least a ""trigger"" that set him off enough to kill himself, or alternately, what, if anything, caused the impulse in him. One strangely empty reveal is that he used his mother's sleeping pills, nothing he himself was prescribed, to commit the act. Which even further asks the questions about his mother's involvement in everything, and why she was having an affair.

But that's how everything in this film goes. According to the film, the ""why"" of everything is, at best, unimportant. What matters, apparently, is the kind-of-a-given-from-the-start notion that his life affects the lives of others around him, as well. This is hardly a revelation, as there's never any question that his family cares deeply for him and is sensitive to him, as well as a select few people at his school. The explanations, then, don't matter, and even the suicide itself doesn't matter, because now The Soul realizes he is in fact Makoto's soul itself, and for whatever reason, he didn't notice these things or just wasn't as lucky the first time around.

He's seemingly truly saved, ultimately, by his making a friend from his class one day, by a chance meeting. This is really his biggest motivation to succeed in the future and his initial reason for wanting to live.

Wait, but how does that work? He seemed to make his new friend as soon as he changed both his looks and his personality a bit, as well as buy a pair of nice sneakers. Apparently he was never friends with this guy in the past. But after he's done tailing his crush-prostitute, he appears once, and then appears later when Makoto is just wandering after he's mugged, and his sneakers are stolen. What was stopping him before? Not buying the sneakers to catch his initial interest? Not running into him when he's checking out some of the area's historical trolley routes?

The lack of rhyme or reason behind it all just doesn't work, and the reasoning ultimately is surprisingly, and disappointingly, shallow. The other characters almost don't even matter, since it's apparently an internal change in Makoto's perspective about how he affects the world around him in a positive way. His crush? Explained away in a few sentences. The odd-one-out girl who is inspired by him? Well, if you can put past that he sexually assaults her at one point, that's about the end of it. Again, everything is really just as important as it seemed at the beginning.

It's worth going into a separate part about the story, as it can't really get the idea of a very young suicide quite right, and suffers from an extreme over-simplification of things, one that it actually endorses. This is an abstract part of the review, because it has to do with the portrayal of Makoto's suicidal instinct, which just doesn't gel at all.

The thing is, as soon as The Soul wakes up in Makoto's body, I was looking at a familiar scene. He's survived his suicide attempt, is recovering in a hospital, and his family is despondent and desperate.

I've left a hospital at a young age for suicidal behavior, and known others (actually in junior-high, roughly the same age group as Makoto, really a total child) who have also had the same experience. Graciously, the film at least gets the most important aspect, that of the family's extreme sensitivity and dealing with his attempt, pretty straight. As I've known from both myself and others in the same situation, destroying your family's sense of your safety and mental well-being, as well as the idea that you could snap at any second, is intact. For the more fortunate among us with families that care in this way, that's just how it tends to play out. Everyone gets super-sensitive about everything you say and do, and they seemingly have no idea what to say, and they're scared to death of bringing up the topic of suicide.

If the film gets anything right, it's this. What it doesn't get right, though, is Makoto's apparent ""reasons"" behind his suicide.

Makoto has a melancholic temperament, no doubt. He's been traumatized by bullying, disillusioned by his crush's prostituting herself, and isn't very much interested in his future, being last in his class and facing the prospect of being placed in one of the worst private high schools (this is apparently a really, really big deal in Japanese culture, in which even the concept of possibly going to a public school is a mark of shame--less so in American culture, as I would think quite a few of us, including myself, spend their lives in state-funded public schools, and it may in its own way sort of suck, but it's generally not a mark of shame). He's blessed with his artistic skills, a creative outlet in which he can indulge (me, I do poetry, but they're fundamentally the same type of outlet). This is apparently not enough of an outlet for him, though, as evidenced by the fact that he's ultimately dead by suicide.

But it's questionable that these are his reasons for suicide. I'm not saying you even need ""reasons"" to possibly explain a suicide, as there are often none that even the suicidal can identify. These are, however, stated as Makoto's reasons, but they're not really put in perspective at any point during the film. The film seems to suffer from what a lot of less-informed films about suicide (and homicide) tend to presume, which is that there is an identifiable ""reason"" for someone's suicide. Makoto's ""trigger"", at least, isn't really established well, as aforementioned by the problem that everything is as it seems, and his ""reasons"" aren't actually given much chance to establish themselves in a true-to-life, realistic context.

Moreover, his life is literally explained to him by Pura-Pura. He learns a little bit about himself and his life, but this reminds me of the Back To The Future conundrum, in which the fact is that the main character is living in an alternate reality of which he has exceptionally little knowledge. Now, Makoto's a bit above that in that this is indeed an identical life (as The Soul is revealed to be Makoto's), but he starts in the same exact position. He does not, in fact, remember anything. Nothing whatsoever. He's left to discover on his own what Makoto's life is like, but his own memories are gone, so Makoto's memories aren't really his. It's sort of a minor problem with the film, but it's hard to miss. It's not stated that Makoto is going to get back all the memories he used to have before he died, leaving us to assume that he only kept what he's had up until that very point.

Being close to suicide (and the suicidal), Makoto isn't portrayed very well as one. His motivations just aren't really given. This is kind of a problem when the film seems to surround it.

And after all that, there's the film's rather insensitive and old-school attitude toward suicide. Makoto's soul is said to have committed a terrible sin--which is, in fact, the act of killing, though in this case, it's himself. You should already know where I'm going with this, unless you're an idiot.

This film isn't *that* old, but its beliefs about suicide are downright archaic. I would think at least the film would have the grace to not treat suicide as a voluntary act, and especially not a ""sin"", and more especially, not the equivalent of murder (much older societies did in fact believe this, however, and so treated the corpses of suicides the same way as murderers). I don't know about you, but in the school of suicide, it is taught above all that suicide is in no way a voluntary act, and no one actually *wants* to commit suicide. It's often an impulse, something the person saw as the single solution to their problems, best explained by the saying, ""I want to die, I just don't want to kill myself."" There is no such thing as someone who kills themselves because they want to or because of a personality that is somehow lacking (*all* are vulnerable to the phenomenon), no one who does so with hope, no one because of a personal fault, and hence is totally absent from the very concept of being a ""sin"", or an offense against God, or even remotely comparable to homicide. This is not so much a cultural difference as much as a horribly outdated attitude about suicide, one which most cultures, certainly post-modern ones, have gotten over and understood the idiocy of, Japanese modern culture included. Those who commit suicide are not sinners and have committed no offense against God--as has been formally and finally established by two of the three Abrahamic religions, sans Islam--and that's the end of the discussion.

A film that somehow has managed to sneak by the fact that its message is trivially demonstrated at the last minute, its initial major mysteries not properly explored to a meaningful extent, and we don't actually get to see what amounts to a truly promising future. The film ends without telling us what really happened, without telling us who Makoto really is, or who the people around him really are, or how his environment is truly like in any meaningful detail. It appears content that its stupid-simple explanations are enough and its message is above any believable reality, and that's its greatest failing. It makes Makoto's life seem shallow and trivial, and the circumstances within it are left unexplained.

Sadly, this is a film that sells itself, but most especially its primary message and its own world, along with the entire concept of suicide, very, very short, and there's no way one can get around that. It's just totally unforgivable to depict reality as this simple, and to say the power of positive thinking is effective against the suicidal is just misguided, and totally incorrect. Its portrayal of the themes present is not only absurd and grossly oversimplified, but disturbingly archaic.",1403395200,9,12965,4.749444691248334

I too was gifted in the way that I was lonely and bullied all my life. Despite of stellar credentials, experiences and work ethics, I became yet another doomed long term unemployed who was intentionally ignored by employers due to my age and duration of the unemployment. If I did not know something, I could learn. If I was not good at something, I could practice harder. But there was nothing I could do to defeat this kind of blatant discrimination. I was even rejected after offering employers to work for them for free to prove my worth! It took me 20 years to become a US citizen and only 2 years for me to fall from sky into destitution. I was forced to move back to my home country to stay with my parents and to receive desperate needed psychiatric care. I could not held back my tears during the final ten minutes of the film especially when the father mentioned that it was a blessing to even have Makoto around regardless Makoto's nasty attitude toward his family. I too felt strongly about becoming the disgrace of the family knowing how much my parent had sacrificed to let me study at the US. I was trying so hard to achieve to honor my family yet in the process I have also neglect and hurt them. After my shameful return, I thought I had become a burden and could not wait to rid of myself.

5559775,5,B00B6DTFOC,"I was browsing my wish list for what to buy next on Amazon when I spotted a listing for this film. Id seen the listing before, but frankly, the cover design on the disc was somewhat odd and off-putting, so I didn't pay much attention until it came up again tonight and I decided to read the reviews. I learned that it was available on Hulu, so after reading all the reviews, I watched the film, online. On the spot, I decided to buy the Blu-ray disc. This becomes one of my favorite anime films, right up their with Umi ga Kikoeru and Omohide Poro Poro.
A lot of the reviews are a bit misleading because the first half of the story makes you think that someones spirit is being injected into a strangers body, for reformation. That aspect is somewhat confusing at first, but becomes clear by the end of the film.
For the non-religious viewer, it will take some suspension of disbelief to enjoy this film, because after all, it deals with the topic of afterlife. One has to put aside ones philosophical ideas about it and just experience the story, live in the moment as you experience, first-hand, the life of Makoto Kobayashi.
The films approach to a plot line is very unique. I must admit, I have not seen anything like this beforeespecially not in the anime genre. To my knowledge, the plot is innovative and unlike any other. The concept of a persons soul, after death, passing through a sort of clearing house where souls get directed either to the afterlife or back into an earthly beings body for another go-round, was intriguing and full of unexpected surprises.
If you are not you anymore, during that after-death phase, and you are injected into a being on earth, you have no memories of your past, or whom you were in the prior life. That condition is what makes Makotos existence so full of surprising reactions, discoveries and is ultimately the outside perspective which gives him new insight into his life, who his family are and how everyone is inter-dependent on one another. Its an ingenious plot mechanism and Director Keiichi Hara makes it all flow so smoothly and naturally.
There are many moments that make the viewer feel queasy as Makotos character, in the early days of his new life, has a care-free, reckless attitude. His family are like strangers to him, and he simply treats the situation like some sort of curiosity, to be played with as it suits his enjoyment. Gradually, he discovers persons whom, at first, he admires, but then learns that these persons are corrupted, or flawed in ways he cannot accept and he becomes disillusioned and more despondent. But some of these people should normally play a minor role in ones life and in the big scheme of things, he really has a pretty good life.
I found myself getting angry at this kids attitude, because the situation that he was dropped into was a good one: well-off parents, a loving family, a nice place to live (the general vicinity of Tamagawa Prefecture) and all the things that any kid would be happy to have in life. Things weren't perfect, but I don't think there exists a real-life Brady Bunch in realitynot even in Japan. In a way, this film was an honest expos of Japanese life. Not every marriage is perfect. Not every school girl is innocent. There are some shocking things going on in this film, but I suspect its a realistic snapshot of Japan.
Something that becomes apparent in layers, as the film progresses, is that people who undergo near death experiences fundamentally change. Their whole sense of perspective changes, as was the case with Makoto. The people that he hangs out with, the activities he enjoys, etc., but in other respects, some things stay the same.
On another level, this film is about the psychological devastation that adolescents can suffer from as a result of being the unpopular social outcast and being victimized by bullies. Those sufferings take center stage in Makotos former life and he completely ignores the good aspects of his lifelike the wonderful family that cares for him. But his suicide attempt changes them too. And his return to the living gives them new hope, for a while, though Makotos indifference and uncaring attitude in the early days of his recovery hurt his familyespecially his mother, deeply. There are signals here that something dreadful may happen. There is still one scene in the film which I don't understand, and seems like a deleted scene that was not removed, because upon seeing it, I got the most dreaded fear of what was going to happen next.
Overall, this is a somewhat bittersweet film, perhaps a few steps above bittersweet, but most of all, it makes us aware of how we are all interconnected and how our actions affect those we love and who love us.
Although I watched for the first time through the pixelated, granular window of Hulus bitrate-limited video experience, I could tell that the animation and artwork in this film was at the top of the very best I've seen anywhere. The smoothness and fluidity, the foley work (sound effects) that added a sense of being there, and the beautiful cityscapes and environment that puts the viewer right into the neighborhood. The lighting and the dynamic range of the scenery in shade, sunlight, overcast and at night is the most realistic I have seen in anime. I can hardly wait for the Blu-ray of this film to arrive. I want to watch it on the big screen and really drink in the visual detailsits that stunning.
I don't know why this film isn't more widely-known, because its probably one of the best anime films of all time. That is, if you overlook the fantastic notion of afterlife depicted herewhich is the only supernatural phenomenon in the film. The rest is just a wonder slice of life story with a theme of self-discovery. So if one looks at the vehicle used to make the story have a meaningful context, Id say that its a valid tool to use in fiction. I sometimes wonder if the writer is telling his own life story, because its so vivid and intense.
Colorful is an absolute must-have for any fan of the Japanese anime genre. It IS right up there with anything out of Studio Ghibli, and I don't say that lightlyI love and adore Miyazakis films, and this is simply testimony to how excellent a film this is. Buy it, go to a friends home theater, if you're fortunate enough to know a videophile, and enjoy this on a big screen. This story will transcend your existence and leave you feeling raw emotions, but left for the better to have gained this valuable experience.",1384819200,32,6486,4.650696864111498
5559776,5,B00B6DTFOC,"I just watched this on Hulu and decided I had to have a copy.  This is absolutely for mature audiences as it deals with suicide but it also touches on classroom bullying and other themes regarding teenage behavior so it should be the parent's decision whether or not to let their pre-teen kids see it and there should be discussion afterwards.

This touched me and I ended up crying for several minutes afterwards.  Very few movies whether live or animated have brought me to tears but over the years I've had two co-workers who lost their teenage children to suicide.  One to depression from bullying at school and the other to feelings of hopelessness due to suffering from traumatic brain injury so I'm sure that had a lot to do with the crying.

5559780,5,B00B6DTFOC,"I want to start out this review by just saying this, it was invigorating to experience a colorful masterpiece like this.
I was looking around Hulu not knowing what I was going to get myself into. I saw the title and cliche look to it and figured, heck, I have the spare time at the moment why not? And I have to say... I'd slap myself if I took any longer to see the flick. I haven't had as much fun watching an anime feature film since the last studio ghibli creation. Maybe better. The animation and story was very fluid and fun to pick at as it unravelled. I'm usually pretty picky not having dubs (I'm not sure if this version is dubbed or not) but the way it was animated and fluidity of emotion, it didn't matter much at all. I highly recommend this to anyone who would like a good heartfelt story about life's small cruelties and the little ups and downs that come with it. Though it may seem like it is a sad dull movie most the way through, it still has it's nice dose of humor and optimism to bring this boy to redeem himself.

So that's it, I'm not going to explain the character, or everyone's full intentions or whatever hobbies anyone does. Just experience it the same way I did and get to know everyone from the ground up and set your observations to what will happen next. My guess was that the main person that took the boy's body was a girl, thinking that'd be the best plot twist, boy was I wrong.

I just wanted to note on the side, I couldn't help but think of a Persona 3 vibe. The little boy from another world, taking control of a life of some one that isn't you (playing as main character without knowing the backstory) and getting to know the surrounding characters in detail over time and the murky atmosphere. The only thing this is missing is actual fighting.",1380672000,3,1788,4.271386430678466

8563242,5,B00B6DTFOC,"I was EXTREMELY skeptical, and wasn't expecting much from it. Honestly, it touched my heart. It made me cry, and feel as if the main character's problems were my own. I felt anger, anxiety, sadness and even joy. It's not easy for a movie to do that for me. It was beautiful. I know EVERY person has felt as alone and stuck as this young man. Unfortunately suicide rate is high in Japan. It makes your heart ache. A  gorgeous masterpiece to add to my anime movie collection. If your skeptical of this movie, just buy it. Watch it. You'll see what I mean. I didn't have any high hopes for this movie, but it surpassed my nonexistent  expectations.",1484697600,3,645,4.411764705882353
