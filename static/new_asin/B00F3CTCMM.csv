8611899,1,B00F3CTCMM,"After a quick product test (a does it load & play test), I found that I had bought ""Christmas Lights Across America Featuring Christmas Lights From The Great State Of Mississippi (Volume One)"" and is a M.O.D. (DVD-R) product. The images on the product packaging show Christmas lights at the U.S. Capitol building and downtown Levenworth, Washington, which are among the seven images on the back of the DVD case. I saw no signs of snow and Christmas lights as I fast forwarded through the entire 60 minute disk. This product, while showing Christmas lights at verious residental settings, is deceptive at it's center and does ""NOT"" show Christmas lights across America. The case lists ""Special Features"", but there are none, not even chapter stops, but only a start button for the feature is menued. I believe the publisher's (RE Reality Films) intentions are to lie to their intended customers and make a quick buck.  I can not recomend this product for purchasing. A sad ""Bah Hum Bug"" to what should have been a satisfing holiday experience. You would be better off buying the superior DVD's ""Christmas In New York"" or ""In The Christmas Spirit"" instead...buyer be forewarned. Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year in 2014...have fun :) :) :)
