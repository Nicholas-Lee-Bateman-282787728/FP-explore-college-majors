5124666,5,B0083H502A,I have always loved all of Donna Leon's books. This DVD series is so well done.  I don't mind sub-titles so it works well for me.  My husband is hard of hearing and he realy enjoys the sub-titles.  I have purschased all the DVD's that are available for now and hope there will be more.,1342656000,5,285,4.1454545454545455
5124667,1,B0083H502A,I threw it away. It is in German! A film set in Venice is in German! Why? A waste of my money.....,1342569600,,98,3.5
5124668,5,B0083H502A,"Very good
Brunette  but I had seen them on t.v.
Others worth watching.
Blood in the vine a little slow but like the lead star",1370304000,,125,4.0
5124669,5,B0083H502A,"Good acting, interesting story lies, Donna Leon good author, no problem with subtitles, learning a little German in the process.  Glad we got started on this series.",1370044800,3,165,5.111111111111111
5124670,5,B0083H502A,"I gave it a excellant rating because of the actors, characters and the scenery. I still am a little taken back by the german. It seems so harsh compared to the beauty of everything else.",1367193600,,186,4.3428571428571425
5124671,5,B0083H502A,"I own all of the episodes in this German-produced series based on the Commissario Brunetti books by wonderful Donna Leon. The actors fit the parts and while some of the details had to be left out or changed a little to fit the television show constraints, the stories are remarkably true to the books in spirit and whimsey. And the scenes shot outdoors in Venice are just breathtaking. I was surprised that the character of Brunetti's mother was changed and introduced as a recurring appearance in the shows, but I soon warmed to her and appreciate that she is a funny and believable person rather than a sad ghost as in the books. I accept the producers' artistic license in this respect, although I wonder how author Leon reacted to this revision! If you loved the books as I did for their intrigue, historical detail and timeliness, inventive plots, delightful and well-drawn characters, both good and bad, and the evokng of Venice and its culture, food and quirkiness, you will love these DVDS as well.",1363996800,5,1006,4.7542857142857144
5124672,5,B0083H502A,"Beautiful Venice.  Great plots.  Took some time getting used to German being spoken rather than Italian, the characters speak
Italian with greeting words only, the  actors are true to the characters in the books otherwise.",1362614400,,222,5.285714285714286
5124673,3,B0083H502A,"Wilful Behaviour has a plot that swirls around the wartime acquisition of art on the cheap, and by outright theft. This subject, of (mostly Jewish) people forced out of their home countries by the rise of fascism and forced to sell their valuables, has become hotter in recent years. The story here involves a 'nationalist' library, and its chief's attempt to acquire by nefarious means some valuable but ill-gotten art. Murder, loveless marriage, theft and jealousy contribute to the tragic stew here, along with a daft mirroring sub-plot of Brunetti's daughter resorting to feminism after being dumped by a boyfriend. This strand also provides us with the priceless scene of a feminist protest outside the church of San Stae where a statue being uncovered as part of the protest got its bosoms blurred out by US TV censors. Another piece of plot fluff is provided by a new and cute Commissario (Commissaria?) starting work, and introducing Brunetti's boss Patta to feng shui and other Eastern fads. This leads to her taking him to a posh restaurant where he suffers tofu pasta. A vegetarian restaurant in Venice? As if!

Blood from a Stone begins with an African getting shot in front of the church of San Felice. Brunetti's attempt to find the killer leads him into the squalid lives of the fake bag sellers and the ever-corrupt influence of national government. Patta, Brunetti's boss, is warned off with talk of terrorist cells but the truth is more basic. Aside from the aforementioned church, we get some scenes around the interesting crumbling block of old flats in Castello, a lunch eaten in the campo behind San Sebastiano, and Brunetti's front door is once again in Cannaregio, although his flat is way over in San Polo. The Christmas setting of the book is now high summer and we have three 'humourous' subplots this time - Vianello's new baby keeping him sleep-deprived, Signorina Elletra's feud with the office mouse, and Brunetti's difficulty choosing a birthday present for his wife, which features that old 'comedy' standby, the man taking a bra with him shopping. A bit overloaded with added and pointless funny business (to balance the seriousness of the issues?) but a solid episode if you look beyond the laughs.",1361836800,,2233,4.954666666666666
5124674,5,B0083H502A,"I enjoy her description of Venice, the food and Brunetti's relationships.  The mysteries keep me engaged with the charaters and have great twists and turns.",1354838400,,156,5.24
5124675,5,B0083H502A,"We like the characters, especially Brunetti,  and the views of Venice are really wonderful. Subtitled in English - it is a German production.  We have all of them.  If you love Venice then you will be happy, happy with this series.",1351641600,,231,4.585365853658536
5124676,5,B0083H502A,"hOW DISAPPOINTING that the verbal delivery is in German as I was hoping to improve my Italian, but I love the scenes in Venice as it allows me to relive my visits in the city. The DVD's have been in excellent condition.",1345075200,,219,4.238095238095238
5124677,5,B0083H502A,It baffles me why someone would expect a German television program would broadcast in a language other than German. Would that reviewer be equally offended had it been made in English...for an American audience?,1342656000,7,211,5.235294117647059

8524519,5,B0083H502A,Found the books in a small bookstore in Venice 10 years ago and have read them all. So excited to have the DVDs and I have the complete series. They follow the books very well. Love the scenery. Their apartment is very close to the apartment we rent. Actors are perfect. Wish they were in Italian,1466035200,,296,4.303571428571429
8524520,5,B0083H502A,For lovers of Venice,1458777600,,20,4.25
8524521,5,B0083H502A,"If you know the Donna Leon books on Inspector (commissario) Brunetti you will love this series of videos. Fabulous views of Venice, inside and out.  Don't be put off by the fact that it's in German with English subtitles. There is not that much dialogue and the subtitles are well done and easy to follow. Some of the plots stray a little bit from the books, but I didn't mind.  Excellent series, even if you've never read any of the books.",1423958400,,440,4.419753086419753
8524522,5,B0083H502A,OHHH Venice!,1418428800,,12,5.5

8524525,4,B0083H502A,Italian crime solving among the best you will see.  There are some elements of Inspector Montalbano the way the inspector handles the inquiries.  He using intuition along with the facts to get his man.  He has a excellent relationship with his staff and his superior which is both firm and friendly.,1386288000,,299,4.823529411764706
8524526,5,B0083H502A,"We like the show and love the location shots.  Maybe we'll even learn a few words of a new language!  We plan to buy more.  The DVD came very quickly, which was appreciated.",1372636800,3,173,4.181818181818182
8524527,5,B0083H502A,I have become more or less used to the actors speaking German.  They all look and act so Italian that I am not bothered anymore.  Brunetti deals with the ethical and moral problems of his mysteries and tries to remain humane and fair.  I love the books and am very pleased with the film adaptations,1371168000,3,298,4.381818181818182
