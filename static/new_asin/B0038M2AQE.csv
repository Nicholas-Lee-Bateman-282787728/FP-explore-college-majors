is no exception.
Now the 5th one is a full 20+ season - finally! Can`t wait....",1325289600,,135,4.230769230769231
4086478,5,B0038M2AQE,"This sitcom is hilirius. Only here you can see the funny side of peoples inferiority complexes and inadequences without fear or repercussions. Not that I would condone any of it in real life. A great bunch of actors, who are perfectly placed. Love Patrick Warburton. I have heard his voice in so many movies, he does not fail to please. This is definitely worth the buy, and I already have all the previous seasons. Enjoy.",1322956800,,422,4.64
4086479,5,B0038M2AQE,I love this show and the Actors and Actresses in it so I really enjoy watching this series thats the whole reason why I purchased the series. This show is hilarious!,1317859200,,165,4.354838709677419
4086480,5,B0038M2AQE,This is one of my husband and mine favorite television shows. It was a great price too. . . much cheaper then I found at any local store or online.,1308700800,,147,3.933333333333333
4086481,5,B0038M2AQE,"Well casted, well written and Warburton is always funny and at his best in this program. Hope for same high quality for many years to come.",1296604800,,139,4.384615384615385
4086482,5,B0038M2AQE,"This was a great season of the show!

Season 4 comes in an actual DVD boxed set. Not a regular DVD case with a slip cover. IT's an ACTUAL boxed Set! I love when DVDs come out in boxed sets rather than the new cheap stuff (if you can't tell).

The Boxed Set:
The color of this season is Magenta (as previous seasons have been certain colors). The front cover shows all of the cast smiling (except Russel who's puckering). The back cover has a season sypnosis with various pictures of the cast.
Disc 1 -
The first disc features episodes 1-7 and comes in a slim DVD case. The front has various pictures of the cast and the back has an episode list with description. The disc artwork consists of Patrick Warburton, Megyn Price, and David Spade with their same picture as the DVD cover.
Disc 2 -
The second disc features episodes 8-13 and comes in another slim DVD case. The fron, again, has various pictures of the cast and the back has another episode list with descriptions. The disc artwork consists of Oliver Hudson, Bianca Kajlich, and Adhir Kalyan with their same pictures as the DVD cover.

**just as Season Three before this, there is NO bonus material. Nothing at all.
However, if you're a fan of the show, you'll be happy with this release so you can have the episodes on DVD.

Now here's to hoping The Complete Fifth Season gets released this fall (and we won't have to wait a whole year after the season gets released)!",1296345600,3,1427,4.435114503816794
4086483,5,B0038M2AQE,"Sure, it adheres to sitcom rules, but this show gets better and better.  Simply put, it is a pleasure watching Patrick Warburton, David Spade and the lesser known Adhir Kalyan do what they do best.  And the women are (hot) a hoot, to boot!",1294876800,,239,4.409090909090909

4086538,4,B0038M2AQE,"Rules of Engagement started out as a midseason replacement. The first season started with the newly engaged couple, Adam and Jennifer, played by Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. The veteran couple of fourteen years, Jim and Audrey Bingham, was played brilliantly by Megyn Price (Grounded for Life) and Patrick Warburton (Family Guy voice of Joe). Then there is the bachelor, Russell Dunbar, played hilariously by David Spade (Saturday Night Live and Just Shoot Me!). Last season brought the welcome addition of Adhir Kalyan as Timur Patel better known as Timmy. \

My favorite moment of the season is when Timmy explains that he has the worst boss to other assistant while waiting in line. The other disgruntled assistants don't believe him at first until Russell brings an empty coffee cup to use as a bathroom for Timmy. The fourth season only includes 13 episodes. Each episode is fresh and funny too. Jennifer and Adam have a wedding website. Jim and Audrey try to get a surrogate for their baby.

The two disc set doesn't include any special features which is a shame. The show was under-rated and under-valued on network television. Surprisingly, it lasted and survived seven seasons of changing time slots. It now endures in syndication and on DVD. Enjoy and laugh along at a well-ensemble cast that work together like a well-oiled machine.",1468800000,,1348,4.986666666666666

4086700,5,B0038M2AQE,"Given that current comedy series are made, one would assume, for those with no sense of humor or with a low IQ, this series is refreshing in that it is actually funny, and has intelligent dialogue! Watching it, I sometimes find myself laughing out loud. What a pity that it was discontinued. I suppose it's a sign of what the public prefers (or doesn't).",1401408000,3,354,4.546875
4086701,5,B0038M2AQE,We absolutely loved this show and were terribly disappointed when CBS canceled it. Jeff & Audrey (Patrick Wharburton and Megan Price) were totally us,1395619200,2,149,5.25

4086714,4,B0038M2AQE,"I really love this sitcom. I can't believe it has had so many seasons on the air and I never even seen a single episode until about 6 months ago-reruns late at night. Now I own seasons 1 through 4 and love them all. The show has a really great cast. All of the characters are hilarious and play their parts very well. I have watched all the episodes of seasons 1-4 twice already. If nothing is on TV when I am cleaning house on a weekend I will just throw one of these DVDs in and listen to it while cleaning. Some of the scenes are still so funny, even though I have already seen it and I know what they are going to say. I can never have too much laughter in my life!
I will buy the rest of the seasons in the near future. The negative side and the reason I give it four stars instead of five is because these season DVDs are very short; seasons 3 and 4 are only 276 and 277 minutes. They are roughly half the length of Two and a Half Men season DVDs. I checked two of the seasons I have and they were both over 500 minutes. I own about 8 seasons and I am pretty sure they are all about that length. Maybe thats why I hadn't seen Rules of Engagement sitcom any sooner--their seasons are mini ones.",1392076800,,1199,3.979253112033195

4086716,5,B0038M2AQE,"This show is HILARIOUS. After ""Wings"" -- which (for me) ruled comedy sit-coms in the 90s -- this is my favorite comedy series EVER. Most shows fizzle around season 3, but not this one. The writers/actors/directors are genius. Truly funny stuff. Every single time.",1387497600,,263,5.0
4086717,5,B0038M2AQE,"3 varieties of the ""battle of the sexes"":
Jeff & Audrey, a 30 something couple married 12+ years
Adam & Jen, a 20 something engaged couple living together
Russell, a single guy looking to couple with as many young women as possible

Patrick Warburton (previously on NewsRadio, Seinfeld, & others), as Jeff Bingham, often comes up with a way of timing & delivering a line that extracts maximum humor.

Russell ""worked"" for his father's real estate management company. The character of Timmie was introduced in the 3rd season as Russell's ""assistant"".  He was a foil that helped the writers explore Russell's libidinous nature outside relationships with the 2 couples.

Only the 5th season has a full 24 episodes.  After a 7 episode 1st season the others have 13 to 15.",1386460800,3,767,4.869230769230769
