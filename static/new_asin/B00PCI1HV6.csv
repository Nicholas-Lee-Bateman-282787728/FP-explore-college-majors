I'll admit it is seeing some songs live that I haven't seen before, but other than that it's hard to watch. A quick summarization of the entire DVD would be, nearly perfect musicianship from everyone except for Danny (lead singer), who spends almost the entire DVD struggling to hit notes as well as going off on wild vocal spurts trying to show off some skill but completely going off key. Screaming is good music is good crowd is awkward and singing is eh. I understand maybe this show was recorded after a long tour or something but come on. Wait for it to go oN YouTube, don't waste your money.",1419724800,2,716,4.390977443609023
8687369,1,B00PCI1HV6,"Abysmal audio and video quality... This thing looks like it should be a free bonus disk that comes with a CD... Its on DVD, and has a resolution of 704x308.... thats not even 480p The audio quality is even worse, at 136 kbps average. This has the equivalent quality of a 2008 music video... Utterly unwatchable",1480723200,,310,4.553571428571429

8687373,5,B00PCI1HV6,"Look I'll give the shipper five stars because this got to me quick! Great customer service. Now the DVD? Questionable! It's overdubbed or they're lip syncing? Sounds too too perfect, like I'm listening to the cd... Something is not right about it.",1454284800,,247,4.904761904761905
8687374,3,B00PCI1HV6,"I was really excited for this to come out as AA is one of my favorite bands.  I am kind of disappointed though.  Being a musician and heavy in the production world I THINK that this DVD is all the music from the albums, but with live vocals.  I'm guessing they either played along with backing tracks or more likely, click tracks so they're perfectly on time in what they're playing in the DVD, however the audio seems to be straight off the albums.  It is too perfect sounding.  Danny's vocals are most definitely live vocals though.  I also don't know why they waited so long to release a concert DVD from 2 tours ago.  I was excited to see some new songs off of ""From Death to Destiny"" but there's only one.  Still not terrible though.",1438300800,,738,4.335766423357664
