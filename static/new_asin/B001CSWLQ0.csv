3517708,5,B001CSWLQ0,"While watching this film, strange thoughts drift though one's head thinking about the fact that the doomed James Dean, besotted with his idol Marlon Brando, visited him on the ""Desiree"" set. (See photographs online under ""Desiree: Brando and Dean"") It is haunting to think of him walking amongst these quintessential Hollywood 1950's recreations of Napoleonic France, this synthetic late eighteenth century Europe with it's marbled halls, waistcoats and sabers, horses and carriages, and lush cypress gardens, and wonder to oneself what would it have been like to see him appear in such a historical epic, if he had lived? Would he have been, in his own inimitable way, as compelling as Brando was in the role of Bonaparte? Would he have eventually achieved a range as equal, if not greater than Brando did, if his fate had never come to pass?",1454371200,,843,4.98581560283688

3517713,4,B001CSWLQ0,"Brando is magnificent as Napoleon Bonaparte at all stages of his career... arrogant, charismatic, self-centered, withdrawn, amiable, hot tempered... a variable characterization never overplayed. Probably the best portrayal of Napoleon ever, and the real reason to watch this turgid romance. The the sets are stunning, the costumes near perfect. The historical tableaux perfectly capture paintings such as David's coronation. A really sumptuous 1950s historical epic. Michael Rennie is wooden as Bernadotte, and the script totally ignores his seething jealousy, notofs a rival lover, but of a greater genius. Bernadotte was a good general at one level, a hack who rose above that level on the battlefield. Jeanne Simmons is beautiful but merely adequate as Desiree. Her romance with Bernadotte is just boring. Plaudits go to Merle Oberon as the forsaken Josephine.  A good historical film at the highest level, but virtually every scene is an invention.",1450915200,,952,5.52054794520548

3517715,4,B001CSWLQ0,"This was billed as the movie that is as great as Gone with the Wind. Unfortunately while Gone with the Wind remains just as popular as ever and ageless, this movie doesnt quite compare.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Watching Marlon Brando play Napoleon was delicious to say the least. After a few scenes he doesnt play Napoleon he really is Napoleon. Not only in resemblance but in ego and impact on others. The costumes are so beautiful and the sets too.  I am in love with both Marlon and Napoleon so of course I enjoyed this movie immensely.
I cant quite tell you why only a four maybe because for some reason it falls short of Gone with the Wind in some way that I just cant explain. But if you like to watch Marlon and love period pieces I think you will enjoy it as much as I did.",1445472000,,792,4.231788079470198

3517721,5,B001CSWLQ0,"You have to watch this movie.  Not only is it Historical.  It is uniquely profound and well acted.  And the clothes and sets will be worth it even if you didn't (inconceivable) like the content.  I would say that it has nothing this generation would put into an Epic.  It is not vulgar when it speaks of promiscuity.  Just matter of fact (you don't have to see every detail of battle or sex people) It shows a devoted couple, a failed marriage, a reign based on a windfall and silenced concience, and a man that started small with a big vision of grandor.  A brilliant ruler that did not realize how his ideals had morphed over time.  That is my take.  Watch it and find yours... but... watch it. PS. make sure you have enought time to watch this extra long movie ALL AT ONCE.  :)  You'll be glad",1431820800,,796,4.275167785234899

3517730,4,B001CSWLQ0,"Loved the book as an impressionable teenager. Later saw the movie and enjoyed it immensely. Missed it over the intervening years as it was seldom shown on television and the DVD versions available were largely Chinese or some other foreign production or VERY expensive. Glad to have it available now for my video library to share with my daughters. The lead actors, Marlon Brando, Merle Oberon, Jean Simmons and Michael Rennie were very good in their roles. The movie and book are loosely based on a Frenchwoman, Desiree Clary, who led a remarkable life. Historically she was first engaged to Joseph Bonaparte and later, at Napoleon's suggestion, Joseph was engaged to her older sister, Julie, and Desiree was engaged to Napoleon. As in the movie, Napoleon left for Paris and subsequently ended his engagement to Desiree in favor of an engagement to the politically powerful Josephine. Desiree eventually became engaged to Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte who was adopted by the Swedish king and became King of Sweden. Through their son, Oskar, Desiree and Jean-Baptiste became the ancestors of the currently reigning Swedish royal family. The movie glosses over the significant historical events of the period in favor of the romantic elements. In a way, this seems apropos as history records that Desiree herself had had very indifferent schooling (due to the French revolution shutting down the schools of the upper class), was never politically astute and largely concerned herself with family and social events. If you enjoy period pieces loosely based on significant historical events with a heavy dose of romance, you will likely enjoy this movie very much.",1419465600,,1656,5.205992509363296

3517733,5,B001CSWLQ0,"I really enjoy the chemistry between Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. That is probably why I own ""Guys and Dolls"". Merle Oberson is just beautiful.",1418169600,,146,4.88
3517734,4,B001CSWLQ0,"I really enjoyed the movie. The dresses are very lovely and the period costumes very well done. Marlon Brando was exquisite as Napolean, right down to the last detail. His portrayal of Bonaparte included all the non-verbals, including both head and body carriage. It was incredible to watch. He also must have had something done to his nose for this part because it seemed more aquiline to match Napolean's. Even his eyes and hair looked similar. Unless i had been familiar with Brando i would hardly have known i was looking at him.

Jean Simmons does well as Desiree, never overly dramatic. Rennie was a well-played Jean-Baptiste, as well as being taller than Brando which contributed to making Brando seem even more authentic as Bonaparte since the latter was known to be on the short side. I forget the name of the actress who played Napolean's first wife at the moment but she rivals Jean Simmons for beauty. Her parts were very sparse however.

The movie does not really show any battle scenes or blood shed, we are only told that there has been a great deal of it and much suffering of troops, particularly in Russia.

The movie lasted 2 hours and i found it easy to sit through and never too slow or cumbersome. If anything it maybe went too fast and i would have enjoyed just a bit more historical or educational detail of Bonaparte's campaigns included. But then i am a person who likes to watch a lot of documentaries.

3517735,3,B001CSWLQ0,"Couldn't find a copy to purchase for a reasonable amount (in the $20-30-40 range) so I rented it. I own a dozen or so Brando and hadn't seen this. It's an intriguing portrayal (for about 20 minutes) in the Brando oeuvre but unessential.

A typical costume drama of the time with static staging, large sets and opulant costumes overshadowing story and characterization. Brando gives it a shot but doesn't have much to work with, his fellow castmates more Hollywood than Actor's Studio. His Napoleon makeup and haircut wear him rather than he playing Napoleon.  Jean Simmons is actually the main character, Napoleon's first love Desiree, and she is fine and gorgeous, looking a lot like Audrey Hepburn, but for all the detail of production the story plays fast and loose with the historical facts.  Pass this one up if you're looking for a historic drama to sink your teeth into, it is bloated Hollywood mid-50s fare.

For a much more dramatic historical telling and a Brando tour de force I would recommend Mutiny On The Bounty made a few years later. Panned upon its release for being ""overblown"" it is a rich production that allows Brando much more room to roam within his character.",1416700800,,1184,4.78921568627451

I am not too deep a scholar of Napoleon at the moment, so am not sure how accurate this movie is. However, I find even this type of ""biographical"" movie to be a good staring point for research. The actors are very convincing in their roles and the costumes are spectacular.  You can tell it was done on sound stages but that really doesn't matter because the story is interesting and the acting matches. I was a little skeptical of Marlon Brando as Napoleon but he does carry it off well.  Jean Simmons is by turn fragile and strong as Desiree'.

3517753,4,B001CSWLQ0,"I fell in love with the novel "" Desiree"" as a kid, caught up in the tale of Napoleon's first love, a woman who later married one of his generals, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, who himself eventually became King of Sweden with Desiree at his side.  Wow.  You couldn't make this up.  The novel was my first experience with Napoleon and, while much of it was spun from the author's imagination, I learned a great deal of accurate history from it.  I have since learned more about the real Desiree but that hasn't detracted from my affection for the novel.

The movie is not as good as the book.  (Hmm...has anyone ever written that before?). And truth be told, it isn't a very good movie.  There is no action, which doesn't bother me, but I think you should be warned.  It simply tells Desiree's tale, but that tale reads better than it watches.  The dialogue doesn't sparkle, but it isn't wretched either.  Still, I think you do get a bit of a feel for the Napoleonic era.  Brando's Napoleon is one of the best I've seen.  Yes, his performance is a bit brooding and self conscious at times but then, I think Napoleon was that way now and then as well. Brando certainly conveys that this is no ordinary guy and that he is very well aware of it from day one.  Jean Simmons is her usual lovely, delightful self. Michael Rennie is a perfect Bernadotte, at odds with Napoleon, and Merle Oberon is an elegant and poignant Josephine.  Wish she was in the film more.

  The costumes are gorgeous.  The score by Alex North is charming.  The actiBasivng is solid throughout.  It is romantic.
Just don't expect suspense or deep thought or complete historical accuracy.  But you will see the basic outline of how a silk merchant's daughter from Marseilles really did become Napoleon's first love and the Queen of Sweden!",1386460800,,1802,4.56875

3517763,5,B001CSWLQ0,"I saw this movie with my parents many, many years ago and never forgot it, although I didn't have the background to really appreciate much of it at the time. I recently listened to the unabridged audiobook of the same name that inspired the movie and wanted to see the film again from a new perspective.

I didn't expect too much since the movie was less than 2 hours long, but was pleasantly surprised at how well the script accurately distilled so much of this lengthy book and presented it visually . The other factor which made both the movie and book appeal to me was that it fairly accurately portrayed the life of a historical character, Desiree, who improbably became the Queen of Sweden whose descendants still comprise the royalty of that country. Without historical verification, both the book and the movie might have seemed to fanciful for my taste. But the broad facts of both are actually true.

The film is old (1954) but still visually pleasing. The acting is not the modern style, but if the viewer can make these allowances, it is worth the 2 hours to watch it. I also recommend the book, but the investment in time will be far more substantial.",1372377600,,1164,4.591346153846154

3517765,3,B001CSWLQ0,"NB: As is Amazon's wont, they've very unhelpfully bundled all the reviews for various editions and formats of this title together. This review refers to Twilight time's US Blu-ray release.

Pitched rather over-optimistically by 20th Century Fox as the next Gone with the Wind and starring Marlon Brando as Napoleon and Jean Simmons as his first love, Henry Koster and his collaborators make rather more workmanlike job of Desiree than they did of The Robe the previous year. The film is pretty much forgotten today despite its huge box-office success in 1954 - so huge that it easily overshadowed Brando's other release that year, On the Waterfront (it even got the cover of Time Magazine). Its relative modern obscurity isn't exactly surprising. It's a solid period romantic soap opera rather than an inspired epic, the sweep of history happening offscreen between the main body of the film in drawing rooms, balls and bridges.

Brando only made the film to settle a lawsuit over his walking out on The Egyptian and is outdone in the charisma stakes by Michael Rennie's Bernadotte. It's not the most electrifying screen Napoleon, that's for sure, with Brando seemingly using the part simply to show there was more to him that Stanley Kowalski types with a restrained, underplayed and softly well spoken turn that wears his egomania lightly. Curiously little of the film concerns itself with his brief flirtation with silk merchant's daughter and future queen of Sweden Jean Simmons, through whose eyes his rise and fall is seen, but then in a film that races over key events in pedestrian diary entries (""There's been a battle at Waterloo"") or reduces the disastrous Russian campaign to a few shots of flags, drums and flames, it's perhaps more of a surprise how little of a role she has to work with. After the initial romantic disillusionment of youth sets in a third of the way through the film she's reduced to a reluctantly passive observer to history and the great men who drive it rather than a participant until the pair's final reunion.

There's little real chemistry between the two stars, the relationship quickly settling into a combination of resentment and rarer moments of teasing - at least you hope Napoleon is teasing when he tells the beautiful Simmons ""The two most outstanding men of our time have been in love with you and you're no real beauty, but you have a way with you."" With Desiree settling into a match with her real true love fairly early in the film while Napoleon marries and divorces for power and position, there's never any real romantic tension in their sporadic reunions and the film never manages to find much tension in the great dictator's rise and fall either as everything of consequence happens offscreen and is either recounted by third parties or diary entries. Unfortunately as Napoleon's proto-EU dream of a United States of Europe - ""One law, one coinage, one people"" - is thwarted and his comeback fails the film winds down rather than builds up so much that when Napoleon says ""Well, gentlemen, I'm ready for exile,"" you're almost relieved that it's not long before he's St. Helena bound.

Much of the blame can be laid at Daniel Taradash's screenplay, which seems to have been written with budget limitations foremost in his mind - no battles, no crowd scenes, nothing more elaborate than the odd ball - and which never really ventures out of its rarefied circle of charmed lives. While it's more than a little doubtful that the real Napoleon ever described his critics as chuckleheads, Taradash does manage to slip in the odd bon mot as well as throwing in a nod to the lucrative Napoleon merchandising and souvenirs business of the day that at least hints at the Little Corporal's Superstar status in his day, as well as one amusing bit of bickering with his troublesome relatives at the rehearsal for his coronation (the latter staged, naturellement, as a pastiche of Jacques-Louis David's famous painting). Henry Koster's direction is more problematic: he's fine with the actors but, far more than in The Robe, seems at a loss at quite what to do with the CinemaScope format here, often reducing history's great moments to static tableauxs or 18th century police line-ups (""Just take you time and tell us if you recognise the man who invaded Spain""). Only in Napoleon's formal divorce from Josephine (Merle Oberon) does he really seem to break away from the proscenium arch staging and remember he's making a movie where the way the camera moves can be used to project the emotion of a scene rather than its simple geography.

It doesn't get much help from a very atypical Alex North score with none of his usual savagery, torment or innovation: under conductor Lionel Newman's baton it sounds like the kind of thing any studio composer of the day could have produced. Indeed, the love theme itself was originally written by Alfred Newman for Five Fingers, leaving North little room for experimentation until a standout cue when Desiree is confronted by the intimidatingly grim portraits of the Swedish royal family.

All of which makes it sound like Desiree is a terrible film. Yet somehow, despite the uninvolving stretches and lack of a compelling love story, it manages to just about work as a glossy CinemaScope costumer. It may reduce its central characters to the fairly mundane, but it's not without old-school entertainment value, and Twilight Time's limited edition region-free Blu-ray release boasts an exceptionally good transfer with far more detail than you'd expect considering how troublesome the early CinemaScope lenses could be. Though there's been some criticism of the color, it's an entirely accurate reflection of the limitations of the somewhat muted original Deluxe process the studio used instead of the more vivid Technicolor. The disc also includes an isolated score, original trailer and booklet.",1361404800,,5882,4.966497461928934

Again, I don't particularly care for Jean Simmons and her pursed up little mouth delivery of dialogue but she did a good job in this. And #3 I don't care for Michael Rennie but he fit this part perfectly and did a wonderful job. I don't know if this is what actually happened (regarding his romance with the silk merchant's daughter and her influence on him the rest of his life) but it makes for a good story and adds a nice touch to what would otherwise be just another movie about Napoleon.

I was happy to find it here on Amazon and ordered it via their Video-On-Demand service. It was amazing watching it again, almost 20 years later and seeing parts of the story I had long forgotten. The story itself is entertaining, perfect for someone who may have recently broken up with someone else. A woman who falls in love with a soldier and helps him in every way she can, comes to find out he's been basically working his way up the ranks through the women in his life. She's heartbroken and years later marries another man, also a soldier. The two soldiers end up working together and then the first man in her life (Napoleon) becomes Emperor of France, with her husband an officer under him.

Later on, her husband is offered a position of royalty, as King of Sweden, making her the queen. This put Napoleon and her husband at war with one another's counties and the film ends with her pleading with Napoleon to end the fighting. An amazing love story, where in the end, the young girl who was cast aside after the man she loved no longer had use for her, was part of the royalty of Sweden which took part in ending his reign.",1343865600,,1400,4.283018867924528

3517777,5,B001CSWLQ0,"After discovering Twilight Time's superior Blu-Ray transfer of the usually grainy, greenish old De Luxe color Pan & Scan print of ""The Egyptian,"" I was hooked. So far, the quality of the DVD's from this company is right up there with the Criterion Collection. I am not going to go into the historical facts of ""Desiree."" Hollywood always re-writes History, and in this case, the distortions are not that outrageous, except to College History professors who are expected to be picky. Yes, there is a problem with this epic: Desiree's story is not as interesting as Napoleon's, so all the major historical events take place off camera, as is also the case with David Lean's mammonth, 'Doctor Zhivago'. But what with ""Desiree's cast headed by Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons, the gorgeous photography and sets, plus the sweeping musical score by Alex North, who's gonna complain except chronic bellyachers?  The production, as sumptuous as any 20th Century-Fox CinemaScope epic of the era,  plays better for me now than when I first saw it in the 50's at age 9. Back then, though impressed with the widescreen visuals and the four-track Stereophonic sound that followed the characters from one side in the long screen to the other, I thought the ""romantic"" goings on a bit of a drag. I wanted more spectacle - more ""action"". Now, however, I enjoyed the story immensely, perhaps because we'll never see the likes of this kind of historical drama again on the big screen, at least not in my lifetime, now that the CGI guys raised on computer games have taken over where human beings once used to tread. If you enjoy old fashioned, lavish entertainment, don't hesitate to acquire this Blu-Ray release. Hopefully, there'll be more 50's Fox CinemaScope releases on Blu-Ray from this company. I would look forward to their issuing such films as ""Boy On A Dolphin,"" "" Night People"", ""A Certain Smile"", and ""Untamed"", to name a few; films as yet unavailable on DVD even in the pan and scan format.",1337644800,,1985,4.8352941176470585

3517779,4,B001CSWLQ0,"The Fox Cinemascope production DESIREE offers Marlon Brando as Napoleon and Jean Simmons as Desiree Clary, a young woman who meets the future French emperor in 1794 and instantly becomes smitten with the young man. While Desiree's sister marries Napoleon's brother, Desiree herself loses contact with Napoleon and eventually heads to Paris where she learns that he's engaged to Josephine - thereby setting the stage for a fluffy historical drama scripted by Daniel Taradash from a Annemarie Selinko novel. Desiree's eventual marriage to one of Napoleon's fellow generals (Michael Rennie), his appointment as a Swedish royal, and her eventual realization that Napoleon still loves her all play out as a fictional Hollywood romantic-drama set against real historical events of the era, all captured in the glory of Cinemascope by director Henry Koster.

From Alex North's sweeping score to Milton Krasner's effective use of the Cinemascope frame, ""Desiree"" is terrific Golden Age entertainment  - not a classic film, but certainly an entertaining one with commendable performances from Brando (who made the picture for Fox after having abruptly departed from ""The Egyptian"") and Simmons (who would reunite shortly with Brando in ""Guys and Dolls""). It is amusing, though, to see Richard Deacon playing Simmons' older brother!

The 1080p AVC encoded transfer culled from the Fox vaults is crisp and satisfying with no obvious use of DNR, and the print looks to be in generally satisfactory (if not pristine) condition as well. The DTS MA soundtrack offers an effective, 4-channel stereo mix with, as is customary from Twilight Time, the isolated score contained on a separate channel. The original trailer and Julie Kirgo's booklet notes round out the package.",1336953600,,1756,5.355072463768116
3517780,4,B001CSWLQ0,"In 1794 Marseilles, a young girl (Jean Simmons) falls in love with an ambitious Corsican General (Marlon Brando) and becomes engaged to him. But as months pass without hearing from him, she discovers he's engaged to a wealthy Frenchwoman (Merle Oberon, very good). But their relationship doesn't end there as their destiny, he as the emperor of France and she as the Crown Princess of Sweden, seems ordained to be intertwined. Visually lavish and opulent (Oscar nominations for its art direction and the gorgeous Rene Hubert costumes), this rather stodgy historical epic is based on the best selling novel by Annemarie Selinko. It's a highly fictionalized version of the relationship between Napoleon Bonaparte and his one time fiance, Desiree Clary. Brando doesn't seem to be taking his performance very seriously (he took the role to avoid a lawsuit when Fox threatened to sue him for bowing out of THE EGYPTIAN) but that doesn't prevent him from having some fun with it. Simmons has never looked more beautiful on screen but it's one of her few weak performances. The film was a big hit outgrossing Brando's other 1954 film, ONE THE WATERFRONT. The eye popping CinemaScope lensing is by Milton Krasner and the strong underscore by Alex North. Directed by Henry Koster. With Michael Rennie, Cameron Mitchell, Carolyn Jones, Elizabeth Sellers, Cathleen Nesbitt, Evelyn Varden, John Hoyt, Richard Deacon, Isobel Elsom, Edith Evanson and Alan Napier.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for directing ""The Bishop's Wife"" in 1947... His reputation as a skilled artist led to his assignment as director of the first film in CinemaScope, ""The Robe.""

Koster does manage to keep the dynamism of ""Dsire"" and is excellent on both the technical level as on the screen acting... The film won Oscar Nominations for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color & Best Costume Design...

His high moment of the film was 'The Coronation Ceremony' where after the blessing of the crowns Napoleon seizes the crown from the Pope Pius VII and crowns first himself, then Josephine (Merle Oberon), Napoleon's first wife... (This petite brunette looked particularly ravishing as the empress).

Marlon Brando proved his versatility playing the great French soldier-statesman, a man insatiably ambitious, exceptionally intelligent, prompt to make decisions... Brando's performance is cool, calculating, compulsive, using a calm, measured English accent, providing the role its wise temperature of the most celebrated personage in the history of France & Europe...

British actor Michael Rennie plays the revolutionary general Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte with a noticed antipathy for his rival... Bernadotte shifts his allegiances, forming alliances with Russia, Great Britain & Prussia, contributing in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig...

Jean Simmons - lovely as ever with her delicate beauty - gives the story fluid charm of a seventeen-year-old girl to a self-confident woman... We see her running through the streets of Marseilles, growing up in the outcome of the French Revolution, recording her daily written account of events, witnessing Napoleon's arrest...

Rescued from the threat of a jump into the Seine, Dsire rejects Napoleon's advances, and marries Count Bernadotte, now a Marshall of France...

Dsire was a romantic figure involved with two opposite characters: one as Emperor of France with an eternal search for wars and glory, and a king, uncertain sometimes about his capacities, with the necessity of a beloved queen besides him...

Marlon Brando's performance manages to capture the historical idea of Napoleon very well- the great intensity of his personality, the underlying brilliance and insatiable ambition.  Napoleon is both repellent and fascinating at the same time.  One can understand how, at his best, he hypnotized almost the whole of Europe.  But he is perfidious also, dismissive of the death and destruction he caused on his way to accomplish his aims.  Really, the character of Napoleon and Marlon Brando's rendition of it is the only reason to watch this film.  Jean Simmons' Desiree is lovely and winsome, but kind of vapid.  One wonders what Napoleon and Bernadotte saw in her.  Michael Rennie's performance is very good in his role as Bernadotte, and he is not overshadowed at all by the strength of Brando's performance.  His scenes with Napoleon are wonderful. Until something better comes along [unlikely...] this is the one to watch for a period piece about Napoleon.",1036627200,,1185,5.1947368421052635
3517797,4,B001CSWLQ0,"Having read some of the other reviews of this movie I felt compelled to submit my own.  I have long been fascinated by Napoleon and I have read and watched just about everything on his life that I can get my hands on.  I found Brando's portrayal of Napoleon subtle and powerful. After having seen at least a half dozen different actors play Napoleon in various movies, Brando's has always stood head and shoulders above the rest to me.  The story is not entirely accurate, but all the main elements of the story are pretty close (except Napoleon surrendering his sword to Desiree).  The costumes and sets are outstanding in a way that seems to be captured only in old movies. This is not an in-depth analysis of Napoleon's life, rather, it focuses on Desiree, a one-time fiance of Napoleon.  While that story is interesting, I find myself waiting for the next Brando scene.  Brando does a magnificent job capturing the eneregy and confidence of the young Napoleon, and the fatigue and desperation of the defeated Napoleon.  Brando's scene when he considers Bernadotte's request to renounce his French citizenship is brilliant.  The movie is almost worth this scene alone.",1014854400,,1171,4.849246231155779
3517798,3,B001CSWLQ0,"In an odd bit of casting, Marlon Brando stars as Napoleon Bonaparte, the French general that became such a key figure in European history.  The film traces his rise and fall through his relationship with the title character, a French seamstress played by Jean Simmons.  Considering the man of action that Napolean was, there's not much in the way of action here.  But people do talk a lot.  Yet the script gives them very little of interest to say.  I can't say that I learned much more about Napolean or was able to understand much about his character.  Brando is an odd choice for the role, and his performance is not very successful.  Simmons fares better, while Merle Oberon as Josephine is completely wasted in her role, disappearing without having an opportunity to do much of anything, save one good scene following her split with Napolean.  The film looks good, but it doesn't come together well, and I was left feeling unsatisfied.",1002931200,,940,4.7592592592592595

Curiously, for a biopic about Napoleon and his love affair with Desiree, the drama is flat. Desiree has very little to do except be an observer of events, recording in her diary what happened in history.",1522022400,,349,4.737704918032787

Hot Toasty Rag, July 29, 2017

I fell in love with Marlon Brandos and Jean Simmonss chemistry in Guys and Dolls, but I didn't know until recently that theyd made another film together prior to their musical pairing. In Desiree, Brando plays Napoleon Bonaparte, and once again, hes paired up with Jean Simmons, the title character. Yes, we all know Bonaparte married a woman named Josephine, not Desiree, so whats the story about?

Daniel Taradash wrote a very interesting script, with exciting, passionate characters. The film lasts decades, starting from Bonapartes introduction to Desiree, before he changed his name, through the memorable Battle of Waterloo. As famous a figure as he was, the film actually focuses on Desiree, the woman torn between Bonaparte and Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. Shes vivacious, loving, strong, and smart. Its easy to see how the two very powerful men fell in love with her.

The Oscar nominated costumes, designed by Charles Le Maire and Rene Hubert, are exquisitely beautiful, and Alex Norths theme is very nice. But with all the lovely elements in this film, the best is the sparkling chemistry between Brando and Simmons. Theres a magnet between the two; its incredible. If only they made more movies together, or better yet, enjoyed a long, loving Hollywood marriage! Alas, Jean was married at the time, and I never read anything about an affair between them.",1501286400,,1412,5.077586206896552
