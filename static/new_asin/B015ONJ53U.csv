7445433,5,B015ONJ53U,"This fine documentary film on DVD by Phil Grabsky presents Leif Ove Andsnes's epic Beethoven obsession, spread over four years and 150 performances in many cities. As he says: ""a multi-season project that will make the composers music the centerpiece of my life as a performer and recording artist."" It began like this:

""I was on tour in Sao Paulo a few years ago, and when I checked into the hotel I realised that in the lifts they were playing a CD of Beethovens first and second piano concertos in a loop, the whole week. I thought that after two days this would make me absolutely mad. But the opposite happened, and I realized that listening to 37 seconds of these pieces each time I entered the life was quite wonderful, because I could just hear *that* bit. I thought Oh, how beautiful, how original and how strange that is, how fresh and how different from any other music. And I thought, Now is the time for me to tackle that, now is the time for me to do Beethoven.""

Watching Andsnes playing the piano and conducting the superb Mahler Chamber Orchestra in this sublime music is a great experience, though it does leave one wishing for the entire performances on video. I hope they'll be issued on DVD and Blu-ray soon. There are many times when Andsnes presents an idea in a very simple and straight-forward way, but the results are incredibly insightful and beautiful. One example is when he explains the significance of the cadenza near the end of Concerto no. 3, and moves to the ethereal transition from solo piano to piano and orchestra. I was transfixed! Here, and in his entire Beethoven Journey, Andsnes' hard work and commitment join with his amazing natural talent as a musician, with outstanding results.

The audio version of the five concertos plus the Choral Fantasy is available on three individual CD, or packaged together as a box set. I have one issue with the DVD, and I'm afraid it's a bit more than a quibble. Everything Andsnes says is so astute and penetrating, and you don't want to miss a thing. But he's very soft-spoken, and his voice is mixed at such a low level that when the piano and orchestra from the recording sequences come in the neighbours are apt to pound on the walls or ceiling. This film was made for theatrical release, and in a theatre with the right acoustics it might have been fine, but even trying different equalization settings on my system I was still straining to hear Andsnes while the orchestra was at the very high end of the comfortable listening range. Luckily there's the option to add subtitles (in English or Norwegian), so I didn't end up missing too much. This is an inconvenience, but not enough to cost this superb film a star; it still gets all five!",1469750400,7,2726,4.604938271604938

7445435,5,B015ONJ53U,"Andsnes takes the viewer into the life and soul of Beethoven that are expressed in each of the five piano concertos.  I know the music as well as any amateur but very critical music lover can.  There was not a single phrase or passage that fell even a hair short of perfection, in tempo, expression, color, volume, or anything else you might want to include.  The samples and explanations by Andsnes are clear and fascinating , and breathe even more life into the music.  A must.",1464134400,6,479,4.534883720930233

8734131,4,B015ONJ53U,"The description of the film on the Amazon entry was pretty accurate (so to avoid disappointment, it's worth reading):  Filmed over the course of four years, Grabsky and his team followed concert pianist Leif Ove Andsnes's attempt to understand and interpret one of the greatest sets of works for piano ever written: Beethoven's five piano concertos.""

For what this purported to be, and what I paid for it, I was happy enough. I bought mine on Amazon marketplace and felt it was worth about the amount I paid.

As one other reviewer notes, its part travelogue, part Music Appreciation 101, with a first-rate soundtrack. Its also a performers musing on what shapes his view of a great composer. This last part in particular was what drew me, since there are many strict performance DVDs out there, and also are numerous Musical history DVDs about Beethoven as well.  But it's somewhat rarer to get a film centered more on the performer's own perspectives, with other fun bits added in.

However the film does try to serve a number of masters, and in doing so perhaps doesnt serve them all totally effectively. Again, I think it best highlights Andsnes evolving (spoken) point of view on these works.

Like other reviewers, there are additions I wouldve liked to make this a fuller package. The most obviousconjoin this with complete concert footage of the concertipreferably all of them; if not, at least SOME of them (or maybe even one?). Also, (although a bit Off-topic) more footage of Andsnes performing some of the other Beethoven works in and around the tours. For example, they have teaser snippets of Andsnes playing the Kreutzer sonata with Norwegian violinist Vilde Frang. Her musical star has risen dramatically, even since this DVD was released, and  I would have loved to have seen the entire sonata.

I realize this was produced, in part, for broadcast by the BBC, so it probably had to fit within the confines of a set time length. But that doesnt mean it couldn't have been expanded for retail purchase. The bar for this sort of thing has been set very high in the past few years by CD releases with accompanying DVDs.  Anne-Sophie Mutters recordings, as well as the Goldbergs by Jeremy Denk are but a few examples.  Of particular note is the ArtHaus Music release of the complete Sibelius symphonies on BluRay/DVD conducted by Hannu Lintu. This set not only contains complete performances of all 7 symphonies, but also historical background, an lengthy introduction to each symphony, and movement-by-movement commentary by the conductor.  Its not cheap, but I was willing to pay substantially more to get this much useful content.

The two star review entitled A guy promoting his own CDs/DVDs is perhaps a wee bit unfair; the review title is accurate, but.is this really a surprise? This is the way it's done. The only thing that stops Von Karajan (or even a Schnabel) from similar self-promotion is thattheyre dead. In their place, the record companies continue to flog their materials in ever cheaper packages. If you told Andsnes this DVD was self-promoting hed probably look at you quizzically and say, yesand, so?",1489017600,5,3135,4.905482041587902
