4712623,5,B005JEJQ20,"After getting a few different Yoga DVDs I saw this and, remembering the series from TV a while ago, bought the first season.

Hands down, this is the best Yoga DVD I've seen.  The production quality is outstanding, the models are competent and graceful at the poses, the instructor's voice is clear, pleasant and keeps up extremely well with both the movements and the breathing.

The workouts are good for beginners to at least intermediate viewers.  They have challenging poses that beginners may have a little trouble with, but nothing like another ""beginner"" DVD I have where the second session has you propping your shins on your elbows and balancing your entire body on nothing but your two hands (I'm drawing a blank on the name of that pose at the moment).  The poses on this DVD set are challenging without going overboard.

If I could change anything at all, the only thing I that comes to mind is that I'd like them a little longer.  They're about 28 minutes for warm up, workout and cool down.  It's not really difficult to run two episodes back to back, but I'd love it if these were about an hour long.

I still give this series 5 stars and highly recommend it.  If you check out my other Amazon reviews, you'll see I don't give 5 stars lightly.",1326931200,37,1259,4.530973451327434
4712624,5,B005JEJQ20,I just purchased this Yoga DVD about a week ago. There are 6 sessions and each session is 22 minutes long. I have an extensive Yoga DVD collection. I must say this is one of my favorites. Kate's voice is so soothing. The scenery is breath taking (if you watch it). Each session is different with some new movements. So far the cool down and relaxations have been the same; but that's fine with me. I love it. I do not have one negative thing to say about this DVD. I must say I am totally relaxed after each session. So if your are pressed for time or just don't feel like doing and hour's session. This is definitely a must have and go to DVD. I am ordering the rest of the DVDS to add to my collection.,1326240000,13,704,4.071942446043166

4712626,5,B005JEJQ20,Loved this show on Fit TV which I no longer get.  So glad to be able to do this yoga again!,1325721600,,91,3.3333333333333335
4712627,5,B005JEJQ20,"I have become a bit of a yoga junkie. Predominately I practice and teach DDPYoga. But I love trying different styles, but this is not my first go round with Namaste Yoga, This is the third series I have tried, the second that is a season of Namaste TV, and also the second by Kate Potter. And to be honest I cannot state how much I enjoy these practices. Everything I have tried from Namaste and from Kate has been awesome. In fact today I did three of these 6 flows again to make more specific notes. Yes these flows are incredibly different than DDP Yoga buy they speak to my body and spirit and I always feel refreshed and renewed from mat time with Namaste TV.

To quote from the description of this season on Namaste TV's website is that ""is more than just an exercise video- it's an experience that will calm your mind, strengthen your body and inspire your soul. Master yoga teacher Kate Potter guides you through 13 classes, all filmed amid the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest."" It really does deliver on that promise. These 6 classes in Season 1 Part 1 are wonderful. Each workout follows the same basic format 4-5 minute warmup, followed by a 12 minute flow, and finishes with a 5-6 minute relaxation and savasana. And each workout has a mix of 3 or four cast throughout that specific practice. And now a few quick lines on each specific flow.

Episode 101
Exalted Warrior
My first thoughts were what an awesome class. Kate is amazing and this was just a great flow.

Episode 102
Sun Moon
Love the warm up on this one, some great floor time. This one is excellent for my tight hamstrings. There was a lot of monkey pose and a great progression into the full sequence.

Episode 103
Firebird
This flow is physically very demanding, maybe the most intense of the 20 flows from Namaste Yoga that I have tried to date. Great series of flows from child's pose to cat. And some awesome firebird poses.

Episode 104
Gate Opening
Wonderful warmup in this one. The series of sun bird to sun bird bows and back again is excellent. I absolutely love this flow. Not as demanding as firebird but incredibly energizing.

Episode 105
Dancing Sun
The warm up goes through the series of cat 1 to cat 4 series. This one has an excellent pace and is an excellent practice.

Episode 106
Half Moon
This one is time for some balance poses. A number of half-moon poses, warrior three and needle woven together into the main sequence. I love the feel and pace of this particular workout.

In preparation to write this review I did each of these flows twice. The first time I made some rough notes and the second time a few more. These 6 flows are awesome! There is really no other way to put it. They pushed my limits, both physically and of my focus. They are engaging and fun. I can see doing then often and not getting tired of them. The Top 3 Pros and Cons of these videos are:

Pros:
Wonderful flows
Incredible cinematography
Great production quality

Cons:
A few times Kate's gentle voice is overpowered by the background music
How addictive they are
Some of the warm ups and relaxations seem almost identical in flow

I really enjoy these flows from Namaste Yoga. They will be a regular part of my practice for years to come. Kate's teaching is wonderful and I understand why it is called Yoga Meditation Practice as we move in and through the poses repeating them again and again with slight variations, and then variations across the different workouts are subtle and yet part of what make these so wonderful.  I look forward to doing these again and trying yet more offerings from Namaste TV.",1449964800,6,3595,4.4969325153374236
4712628,5,B005JEJQ20,"There are countless benefits to yoga, and researchers hail its numerous, powerful benefits. I am a 56 year old novelist, so I spend long hours each day at my desk. I embarked on a yoga program to stretch and keep my muscles limber. Namaste Yoga is a world leader and innovator in yoga with a strong reputation in the field, so I felt that their videos were the best way to begin. And I am pleased to say that I was right!  Visually stunning, the Namaste Yoga DVD narrated by Kate Potter is wonderful for beginners like me. The video has 6 segments/poses: exalted warrior, sun moon, firebird, gate opening, dancing sun, and half moon. Each segment is 22 minutes long. The beauty of this yoga instructional dvd is that my body was challenged, and the more I practice, the better I get. There are no poses that caused me to lose my balance or over-worked my muscles. There is both a warm up and cool down phase. Along with my time in the gym on the treadmill and some weight training, this yoga dvd has been a wonderful addition to my work-outs. Kate Potter's soothing voice, gentle style, set against beautiful backgrounds and relaxing music, makes practicing yoga a wonderful gift to myself. I look forward to the end of the day, as I do the program right before bedtime. Not only am I relaxed, but I feel calmed.",1447027200,3,1312,4.466666666666667
4712629,1,B005JEJQ20,I sent the first DVD set back about a years ago after discovering the Season 2 video and end of season one had problems with the screen interruptions/dragging and seemed to be of inferior quality.  Amazon was excellent at taking the product back and replacing it.  I thought the replacement was ok until several months later and again found some of the segments faulty in the DVD product.  I am really surprised K. Potter has not done something about her product.  I really enjoyed her segments on TV but am so so disappointed in the DVD production quality.,1445731200,4,557,4.653061224489796
4712630,5,B005JEJQ20,"I benefit tremendously both in flexibility & tone (I'm 70), and by accenting the breathing - ending sessions a different person, at least 4 days per week.  I don't follow the screen once it's familiar but the pleasant presenters & Vancouver scene changes set it apart.  But year two has a little nicer narrative, is more inspirational, and the movement-poses are less athletic versus two demanding sessions of Season One.",1434758400,8,421,5.0

 I have a lot of yoga videos and have to say there are some mistakes, like the voice over saying to take the left leg when the video shows the right and some of the instruction seems implied more then explained well. However i feel sexy when i do yoga with these videos where other yoga videos just make me feel sweaty and stretchy, or satisfied with my self, or inept, or bored, or really in tune with my inner guru.",1421280000,,554,4.216981132075472

I ordered it the first time and the disc froze up in the middle of one of the routines.  I sent the disc back and thinking it was just a fluke, I ordered another one.  The second disc wouldn't even play at all.  I am very disappointed with the quality of the DVD's.  Not taking another chance ordering another one.",1415750400,4,412,4.1645569620253164

I have been practicing with her on FitTV, when that existed - I am still upset it was taken off of the air, and now with her DVD's.  I highly recommend this series, they are beautifully done, great sets, great music, and her voice guides you through each sequence effortlessly but with the right amount of difficulty.

4712650,5,B005JEJQ20,"This DVD has wonderful production value.  The workouts are done in a variety of aesthetically pleasing locales.  Kate Potter is amazingly physically fit, has a pleasant voice, and leads two other females through a series of yoga workouts that provide good feelings for the mind, body, and soul.

4712658,3,B005JEJQ20,"Altho it is an enjoyable video, I was hoping for lengthier sessions. I usually do Bikram, as I like the workouts and class is 90 mins. These are 20 min sessions that introduce you to poses one at a time. For those short on time benefit from focused movements. I found the explanation of poses too fast and not in depth to smoothly change from one pose to the next.  I tend to just listen instead of constantly turning my head to look at the video unless I need reference on the Position. So it was lacking there.

I won't be getting the second set, but will keep this set for when I need a quick workout.",1366848000,6,604,4.153846153846154

4712661,1,B005JEJQ20,"I am confounded by the reviews saying that this DVD is good for beginners - there is little to no instruction whatsoever - the episodes essentially boil down to attractive women doing yoga routines expertly while the narrator names off the poses (""going into LATERAL ANGLE POSE now"" - and that's all you get) and coos about feeling the energy flow through you.  Since there is NO (NONE ZERO) audible explanation for the poses, you are forced to crane your neck to look at the screen while attempting to do the yoga pose at the same time and interpret what's going on on screen, except that all too often, even for brand new poses the camera is zoomed into a woman's face or midriff, leaving you to haphazardly guess what they're doing.  So, no audible instruction, and severely limited and inconvenient visual instruction.  Right, well I figured I'd head onto their website and see if they keep their useful instruction on there.  Turns out there are two websites (the ""instructor's"" and the distributor's) and neither have any useful information (despite the distributor's website being labeled ""learning materials"").  Through Google I found pose instructions within one of those websites (not sure which, since neither actually link there for whatever reason), but the instructions are extremely vague, overflowing with the same inane babble about 'feeling the energy' and only a handful of words about the incredibly-important-this-is-why-we're-here actual mechanics.  I was literally about to sit down with a pen and paper, watch an episode, and write down my own >>useful<< instructions, when I cut myself off in disgust.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.  If you're at all interested in actually doing Yoga, buy a Yoga book, and watch some Youtube videos ugh.",1361318400,12,1765,5.062068965517241

Kate Potter is soft spoken, the scenes in these videos are breathtaking to say the least.  I absolutely love Kate's style, you add one movement each sequence so by the end you are flowing flawlessly.  She adds variations to challenge yourself so you can do these over and over again and continue to get stronger and stronger.  This is the only yoga I will do that is not live in person, I feel stronger, more confident and clear headed when I'm done!

When it changed direction I used my VHS tapes for a while but finally got a portable DVD player so I could set up a side area just for my yoga practise. I use Kate Potter's tapes almost exclusively - I love how some tapes are fairly easy and some not but always a smooth routine building to more advanced. Even doing just the warmup is helpful. The Vancouver scenery is breathtaking and each pose is carefully photographed and explained so I never have to stop what I'm doing to figure it out.

Others were ridiculously hard and had terrible transitions. This series lets you go completely at your own pace and for those who think you can't burn calories doing yoga are wrong!

8475668,4,B005JEJQ20,"I was really impressed by Namaste Yoga - Season 1, Part 1.  I've been doing it every day and it provides a challenging program.  There are many sessions to keep you busy (some faster than others - but I got the hang of it after repetition).  I would buy it again!",1476057600,2,263,4.117647058823529
8475669,5,B005JEJQ20,"I purchased this dvd because this year I wanted to live a healthier lifestyle.  I started eating whole healthy taking healthy supplements and started meditating. I had heard about yoga all my life but was never interested in it, but I never understood the benefits of it.  Until I started reading up on the benefits of yoga and how beneficial it is.  I purchased this dvd because I remember seeing it on the discovery fit channel back when there was a discover fit channel.  I am so glad I purchased this dvd, the music and the narrative is ver pleasing and calming.",1466208000,,566,4.519607843137255

8475671,5,B005JEJQ20,"This is a great beginners yoga dvd set.  They are beautifully made and very relaxing. I'm a bit of a beginner when it comes to yoga. I have done Bikram yoga many times at different studios, but have only recently started doing yoga at home and these videos are wonderful. They are very well made, have beautiful scenery, which may sound odd for a yoga video, but it makes it easy and fun to follow. Each episode/video is not all located in the same place, it changes different scenery throughout each one, so they definitely aren't boring to watch and follow.  Highly recommend!",1459209600,2,578,4.601941747572815
