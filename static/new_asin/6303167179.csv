(Ghostwriter Season One)
Was Wondering Though Does The Tape have the Ending On the last Epsodie Of
This Ploit where Lenny (Blaze Berdhal) Singing Friends are forever during the Credits?
Because Unfortionally On The DVD They Deleted that Part
They also Deleted ""Your Not my friend"" Song , i think it was at the ending creits of the 8th epsodie !!
