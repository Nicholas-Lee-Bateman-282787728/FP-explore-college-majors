5126824,5,B0083UI4GQ,"I've read the manga and couldn't wait until it came out in drama format. It is a simple, cute romance story--typical of Japanese manga. DVD came fast and in good condition. I don't know about the subtitles yet; however, I have ordered many Korean dramas from timothyng001 before and never had any issues.",1384041600,,304,4.754716981132075
5126825,5,B0083UI4GQ,Though I was charged for custom (as the postage wasn't enough to sort it) a quick email was all it took and I was refunded the amount I was charged. Now I have the box set in pristine condition! Perfect! Only wish they dubbed Korean too as they have two members of Super Junior dubbed in Mandarin.,1382227200,,297,4.228070175438597
5126826,4,B0083UI4GQ,I really enjoyed the drama and the acting was Fantastic.  The only reasons I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the special effects (specifically backgrounds) weren't as good as they could have been and the English subtitles weren't as good as I'm used to.  Still definitely worth watching and I am very happy to have it in my DVD collection.,1381622400,,339,4.540983606557377
5126827,5,B0083UI4GQ,I liked this series alot. I'm glad to see that the guys from Super Junior are good actors as well as singers & dancers. The show was very entertaining & the english translation was really good.,1377820800,,193,4.388888888888889
5126828,5,B0083UI4GQ,I love any drama with Choi  Siwon.  The story is a little corny but the characters are interesting and I can watch it over and over again.  There were a few grammatical errors which are always annoying.  Always wonder why the errors are not corrected.,1375056000,,251,4.511111111111111
5126829,4,B0083UI4GQ,"=D I'm really excited that I got the DVD! I loved the manga and the live action follows the story line really well. I would definitely recommend this to other skip beat fans. The dvd case came with a box to go around the case, but I wish the quality of case matched the box. They were held inside little slip of plastic covers. This makes it kinda cheap looking. I did not realize that the DVD collection also came with a small booklet/journal. its so precious that i don't want to use it. I kinda wish the journal was small enough or the box big enough to fit inside the box as well. Those two are my only complaints, but overall i'm so glad that i bought the DVDs that those two points don't really matter to me. =D",1372377600,,717,4.128571428571429
5126830,5,B0083UI4GQ,I first found clips on YouTube for this live action version of Skip Beat.  I fell in love with the manga and have been picking up volume after volume and one thing that surpsed me about this drama is how well it sticks to the story line in the manga.  The music is wonderful and the acting is done very well.  My only issue is that they haven't made more episodes but from what I can find on the net there will be in future.  Looking forward to more.,1370044800,,450,4.022471910112359
5126831,4,B0083UI4GQ,I really like this drama. First ever Taiwanese drama I've watched. It's really funny. To bad there are no behind the scenes...,1361404800,,126,4.7727272727272725
5126832,5,B0083UI4GQ,"This drama is based off of the manga Skip Beat! by Nakamura Yoshiki.  Like the anime, this series does not complete the story, but unlike the anime, it found a better place to end.  The theme song is S.O.L.O performed by Super Junior.  It is a great adaptation of the story.

The characters are very well cast.  The only down side is the fact that the two main male characters are played members of the Korean group Super Junior and their voices are dubbed.  They did a great job in casting Tsuruga Ren's (Dun He Lian) manager as well.  He is so cute that he is as much fun to watch as the rest of the cast.

Tsuruga Ren (Dun He Lian) is played by Choi Si Won
Fuwa Sho (Bu Puo Shang) is played by Lee Dong Hae
Mogami Kyoko (Gong Xi) is played by Ivy Chen

This and Tokyo Crazy Paradise by the same author are two of my favourite manga.",1338249600,8,835,4.07361963190184
8524787,5,B0083UI4GQ,Love the comedy of the acting! Love Choi Si-Won's role and acting! Fallows the manga very well.,1519776000,,95,4.647058823529412
8524788,4,B0083UI4GQ,"With a longer drama format, much more of the manga is captured versus the anime. The core pieces are still there, and the alterations for the drama format do not materially detract from the overall story. It wraps up at about the same point as the anime, and both took slightly different directions to make an ongoing story and character arc feel like a conclusion.
One of the benefits of the drama format is seeing the emotions on a human face. Ivy Chen as Gong Xi (Mogami Kyoko) stands out for portraying ridiculous behavior with enthusiasm as well as the character growing beyond the hurt of a painful past. Siwon as Dun He Lian (Tsuruga Ren) is gorgeous and his severe/false expressions slowly melt throughout the series as he opens up. Donghae as Bu Po Shang (Fuwa Shotaro) plays haughty with enough vulnerability that you can believe their past together. Bianca Bai evolved nicely from the queen b**** to a true friend.",1517184000,,925,4.716049382716049
8524789,5,B0083UI4GQ,"I love this drama. Whether you review as sad or funny. Dong-hae and Siwon from Super Junior are amazing in it.
The story line is basically about a girl who followed her boyfriend and helped him to become famous. She ends up getting betrayed by him and vows revenge by becoming more famous than he is. On the way to revenge she ends up running into an old friend, but doesn't recognize him.",1440201600,,389,4.342465753424658
8524790,5,B0083UI4GQ,"The ending was NOT okay, but I loved it all the same.",1428537600,,53,3.5
8524791,5,B0083UI4GQ,How the DVD's are held inside is too simple for my liking but did not compromise the integrity of the product. The Subtitles are excellent and the DVD are of good quality. Excellent buy for my collection.,1410739200,,204,4.54054054054054
8524792,4,B0083UI4GQ,I absolutely love Skip Beat the manga and the anime so I thought I would give this a try. Yes the names are different and they have taken some liberties with certain aspects but the generally story line is still intact and it is still funny although sometimes the reactions are just plain weird. I enjoy this very much and I am glad that I did make the purchase.,1410739200,3,362,4.260869565217392
8524793,5,B0083UI4GQ,Loved it. Wish there was another season.,1405382400,,40,4.857142857142857
8524794,3,B0083UI4GQ,NOT SO GOOD A DRAMA FOR ME. IT DID NOT HIT THE RIGHT CHORDS. 'DID A LOT OF FAST FORWARDING TO FINISH IT.,1393200000,,104,3.5652173913043477
8524795,5,B0083UI4GQ,"I absolutely love this drama. <3 And the DVDs actually came with a little notebook which surprised me. Though the sad thing was that when I opened it part of the attachment that was holding the disks broke up which upset me slightly. But it doesn't matter because it was still in tact. Don't really expect the inside to be extremely extravagant though... it's sort of like one of those multiple CD holding cases. So it's a bit flimsy. But it doesn't matter. I'm still giving it five stars.

I can finally watch this drama without the things on the side when I was watching it online. YAY! ^^

Oh! If you watched it through stream like I did before... the subtitles are slightly different. For example the part with the daikon rose was called radish flower instead. So it's minor changes.",1386201600,3,787,4.535211267605634
8524796,4,B0083UI4GQ,"This is a good show, but I am not sure how it ended. Is there going to be a sequel or not?!",1384214400,,91,3.1818181818181817
