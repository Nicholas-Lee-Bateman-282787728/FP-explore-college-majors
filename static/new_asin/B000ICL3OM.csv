If so, this production of Lo Sposo Deluso & L'Oca del Cairo and the infamous Abendempfindungen / Rex Tremendus  coupled together like the Train of Death - is so frightful, vulgar and hubristic, one must presume that Satan will unerringly track down every participant down to the gaffer and nail their raccoon-skins to the wall. As expiation, director Joachim Schl&ouml;mer should drape himself in scapulars, drink nothing but holy water and sleep each night in Padre Pios coffin of glass alongside its current occupant. Even then, hes a goner.

This atrocity has nothing to do with Mozart  strange though it might seem to those who associate the Son of Heaven with smoking on stage, flatulence, streakers and contemporary dance where underpants are standard-issue. For what they are worth, Lo Sposo Deluso and L'oca del Cairo warrant something more than tomfoolery. Here, Ann Murray is acclaimed as the star of the show; she was 61 years old at the time of the production; no wonder they incarcerate her in a hyperbaric chamber on stage  yes, this is true - to maximise whats left of her voice.

Therese Neumann, the stigmatist who spooked the Nazis, reputedly had a vision where she witnessed Good Friday. In her unpublished diary, she claims that Jesus was forced to watch this sacrilege as he was dying on the cross. Sure, being the Agnus Dei is not meant to be easy but one wonders how the Resurrection was possible per se when this was the levy. Similarly if you view this horror, something in you will die. I jest not. It could be hope. Your hydraulics or plumbing might fail calamitously. Or your wanger could drop off.

Even Hell has a vision of horrors worse than its own. Revelation is at hand.

8145108,5,B000ICL3OM,"Director Joachim Schlomer undertook what may have been the most ambitious project of the entire M22 Salzburg Mozart Festival in 2006.  Over the course of three evenings, Schlomer presented Odysseys (Irrfahrten).  Schlomer begins the first evening of his odyssey with an early Mozart opera, La finta semplice. This is the starting point of a challenging journey with the composer, as filtered through Schlomer's vision.

In 1769 the twelve year old Mozart composed his three-act opera buffa La finta semplice (The Pretend Simpleton) to a libretto by poet Marco Coltellini, which was in turn based off of Carlo Goldoni's comedy.  It is one of the most appetizing of Mozart's early operas.

Captain Fracasso and his sergeant Simone are stationed at the home of two wealthy, foolhardy brothers: Don Cassandro and Don Polidoro. Cassandro and Polidoro have a sister, Giacinta, with whom Fracasso is smitten.  Simone is chasing after the maid, Ninetta. Cassandro, a notorious misogynist, is continually at odds with his womanizing brother.  Fracasso's sister, Rosina, arrives to help her brother and, with Ninetta's assistance, Rosina attempts to seduce both Cassandro and Polidoro.  Rosina plays the part of a sexy simpleton, and she is quite successful with Cassandro.  After a night of much drinking, the brothers quarrel over Rosina (leading to a comic duel).  The quarreling is followed by dizzying amorous intrigue and romantic mix-ups.  The brothers are lead to believe that Giacanta has run off with Simone and taken the estate's treasure with him.  Finally, Rosina, Giacanta and Ninetta end up with their chosen lovers. Only Polidoro walks away empty-handed, which leaves him happily single and unfettered.

Schlomer's trilogy, beginning with La finta semplice, is not an odyssey for the simpleton, or the timid Mozartean opera goer.  Refreshingly, his is a richly complex, adult odyssey, which encompasses determination, crisis, confusion and eventually, possible liberation.  In La finta semplice, Schlomer replaces the recitatives with German narration (the original, Italian arias are retained).  The result here is an extraordinary tightening of the lyrical and farcical experience.  The new dialogue is delivered by an additional character named Auctoritas, hypnotically played by actress Marianne Hamre (in a bright yellow body suit, which the actress wittily referred to as her 'Kill Bill' costume).  Hamre's characterization embraces Brechtian concepts, acting out the narration and interacting with the opera's characters.  With the exception of Hamre, the sets and costumes, designed by Jens Kilian, are minimalistic and devoid of color: bridal whites.  Malin Hartelius, as Rosina, commands the triangular stage.  Another addition, ""Dark Rosina"" (played by Anna Tenta), is a mute appendage who amusingly, and hauntingly, choreographs Rosina's movements, until Rosina frees herself.  The Act II love duet between Rosina and Cassandro (Josef Wagner) is capped by an off-the-meter amorous dance.  Schlomer, a notable choreographer and dancer himself, intelligently directs Hartelius: she sings one thing, but dances another, acting out the Rosina underneath the simpleton facade.  The duel between the brothers becomes a battle of animated weapons.  It is so unexpected and surreal that you half expect Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny to show up.  Silvia Moi (Ninetta), Jeremy Ovanden (Fracasso), Matthisas Klink (Polidoro, who, in this version, does get a girl--the narrator Hamre), Marina Comparato and Mijenko Turk make up the rest of a cast with vibrant personality (how about red bras and body paint to off-set the virginal white?).  Michael Hofstetter conducts the Camerata Salzburg as if he and his orchestra get the joke.

Abendempfindung (Evening Sensation) is the second evening of Odysseys. This is not an opera at all, but a pasticcio of Mozart arias, music (including works for glass harmonica), and letters.  The legendary soprano Ann Murray plays ""the Singer,"" the first of three allegorical characters that represent the artist Mozart at a dissatisfied stage in his life (culled from depressing letters he wrote while in Salzburg).  More than that, the three symbolize the life struggles of artists in the world.  Marianne Hamre is the second representation (""the Actress"") and Graham Smith the third (""the Dancer"").

Murray's delivery of the Abendempfindung aria is sensitive and blue.  Perched on a suitcase, she contemplates suicide as a way to change trajectory.  She is dependent on others and longs for complete freedom, which does not come with financial security.  This meditative theme is continued by the actress and dancer.  The three principals, each through their unique artistic expression, convey a wistful defiance in the onslaught of challenges.  Ethereal, digital imagery is hauntingly utilized to echo their fractured plight.  Hamre's radiant dive in a pool strikes a gossamer note.  Rather than a concise narrative, Abendemfindung draws the viewer into strangely intimate visuals and emotive fragmentation.

The third evening, titled Rex tremendus, combines two unfinished Mozart operas-Lo Sposo deluso (The Disappointed Bridegroom) and L' Oca del Cairo (The Cairo Goose)--together with movements from the unfinished ""Requiem.""  Mozart scholar Erik Smith gave the first prepared performance of the unfinished operas several years ago.  In Bridegroom, Bocconio Papparelli plans to marry the considerably younger Eugenia, whom he has never met.  Boccino's confidant is the misogynist Pulcherio.  Pulcherio realizes that Eugenia is actually in love with her former lover, the Tuscan officer, Don Asdrubale.  Pulcherio has sympathy for Eugenia, and he too falls in love with Bocconio.  Boccino's vain niece, Bettina, is competing for the love of Asdrubale.  Metilda (a singer) and Gervasio (Eugenia's tutor) are also thrown into the chaotic mix of confused romance.

The Cairo Goose tells the story of Celidora and Lavina.  The women have been imprisoned by Don Pippo.  Pippo has ambitions to marry Lavina, but she is in love with Calandrino.  Celidora is the chosen bride for Count Lionetto, but she is in love with Biondello.  Calandrino is flirting with the maid, Aureeta,which arouses the jealousy of Auretta's lover, Chicchibio.  Biondello rescues Celidora and Lavina and, together, they escape to the garden.  At this point the opera ends without the appearance of a goose.

Schlomer and cast embrace the fragmentary nature of the works, and treat Rex tremendus as Mozartean performance art.  The cast from the first two evenings return. Again, Hamre is the M.C.  Murray dissipates as she is enclosed in the glass space of melancholic reflections.  Here, geese do briefly appear, like relics being taken to a faraway temple.  Aimlessness and confusion abound, but Hamre, having taken everything in, seems to be moving towards something.  The evening fades as Hamre emerges, dressed in a new, virtuous white.  Although she has, in part, come to symbolize the composer, it is she that we feel have come closest to knowing.  She lights a cigarette.  She is inexplicably moved in the sanctuary of the Requiem's lacrimosa.  Of course,this sanctuary is temporary, but it will suffice.  This simple ending gives comforting flesh to the Requiem, far more than the plethora of edified iconography normally associated with the composer's final work.  Thankfully, Schlomer and ensemble remove Mozart from his pedestal, and feel as if they are replacing the opera house with the intimacy of an concert performed in our own house, swimming pool, cafe, or a little art gallery.

Predictably, Schlomer's vision has critics, one of whom pointedly complained that Murray's skirt was too short for opera.  The scope of Irrfahrten never gets in the way of personality. There is nothing so predictable as an obvious, pedestrain ""lesson"" to be had here.  Rather, this is penetrating communion.  I wanted it to go on.  Joy in repetition.  That is something, I think.

8145109,2,B000ICL3OM,"At first I was not going to review this at all.  On second thought it occurred to me that as bad as this show is, it does have some redeeming features, if you can put up with the nonsense that interrupts the music.  First let me digress.

A railway maintenance foreman told a true story about a train wreck in New England that posed similar salvage problems, in a tangible way, that this production poses.

The train contained wheat flour, canned beer, and maple syrup.  When the cars ""telescoped"" into each other, all the contents were mixed together.  Locals started salvaging the beer, as many cans were undamaged.  Only the very dedicated people attemped to scoop up the pools of maple syrup that could be found in the flour.  Inspectors had the most difficult job, determining the cause of the accident, which was buried under two feet of syrup/flour slurry.

Schloemer, the director of this production mixed everything up in such a way that few will find it enjoyable.

Needless to say this production falls far short of the first night (La Finta Semplice, which is sold separately) for a good reason.  There is no possible unifying concept given the odd assortment of short songs and fragments.  My conjecture is that Schloemer tryed to cover up the impossible goal with ""accidents"", of the ""accidently on purpose"" type.  In a sense there is no deception here:  Who would buy a ticket on a train called IRRFAHRTEN (erring journey)?

Disc one is a total loss, in my opinion.
There is plenty of dancing in underware, Ann Murray's disappointing voice and second rate glass harmonica music.  Murray just did not have a good night, sounding worn and insecure.  Her role in this production was to annoy everyone, in my opinion.  She did a good job, if that is what Schloemer wanted.  I do feel badly that she was used this way.

If disc two were sold separately I would raise my rating to three stars. In addition to the excellent singers from Finta Semplice, there is Marisa Martins, whose voice blends perfectly with Hartelius in the ensembles.  Martins' coloratura is excellent, so she is a singer I will be watching in years to come.  Hartelius gives a wonderful performance with a wide range of vocal colors, making this a hard disc to pass up, after I return the library copy.

Rather than unifying the two extended fragments (Sposo Deluso and L'oca del Cairo) Schloemer further pulls them apart with an endless series of interuptions, including passing gas jokes and the like.  Hartelius wears hot pants and a ""kill your lover"" tee shirt, making this her worst costume on DVD in my opinion.  That she looks good in this outfit is a credit to her good looks.  The other singers are also in ridiculous costumes as well.  Schloemer seems to be taking cues from Trey Parker's cartoon TV show ""South Park"".

This brings me to the bonus track discussions with Anna Tenta and Malin Hartelius.  Hartelius has some deep insights concerning the role of Rosina on the Finta Semplice bonus track.  I have made crude translations, for my own reference, of two prior interviews Hartelius gave in print:  Das Opernglas (Ausgabe 5 / 2006) and Migros Magazin (Nr. 26, 28 Juni 2005 ""MAMA IST EIN STAR"").  These contain insights that suggest that Hartelius has a rare gift for explaining how she interprets opera characters and life issues.  In light of these, her thoughts on L'Oca del Cairo are lightweight.  What could she say given that there is no plan?  Her performance is so musical and good humored that it prevails despite a lack of planning on the part of the director.  That Hartelius has a gift, when it comes to working with next to nothing, is very evident here.  Is this enough reason to buy this two DVD set? That is the question.

Just in case you are thinking about getting this just for the music, and not watching the picture, think again.  Schloemer has added prerecorded dog barking and yiping that interupts the music in Oca Del Cairo.  Something sounds like it is falling apart during the music as well, but it is off camera so I don't know what it is.  The dog is silenced after a piece of fluff is stabbed with a knife and chucked over the railing.

This is not by any means a full disclosure of all the unpleasant interruptions, just those I could describe. Maybe in frustration Schloemer is calling us to examine our craving for the ""complete everything"". If this is his goal, he has won.

Sound quality is superb, at least in the stereo format,(5.1 not tested) but as a sound recording the interuptions are just too annoying in my opinion.",1179964800,5,4557,4.672110552763819
8145110,2,B000ICL3OM,"I was really looking forward to watch the second and third parts of Joachim Schloemer's ""Irrfahrten trilogy"", considering how successful the first part, La Finta Semplice, had been. I was particularly happy to experience the same team of singers, dancers, actors, orchestra and conductor: in other words, Schloemer's gang was the closest thing to a real team that this M22 collection had provided so far.

Unfortunately, it's all downhill from the high expectations. One guilty party: the stage director himself, Joachim Schloemer. Now don't get me wrong, the guy is ENORMOUSLY talented, as demonstrated by the successful ""Semplice"" (5 stars by every Amazon reviewer so far). But in Parts II and III of his trilogy, he fails miserably. Why? Simply because he forgets about the music and Mozart, and decides to focus this piece on his own personality, his own doubts and his own problems as an artist...Frankly, no one really cares and this is why Schloemer is, in my view, guilty of this terminal offence in modern theatre: boredom.

Initially, Schloemer's job was to ""package"" two unfinished Mozart's operas: ""Lo Sposo Deluso"" and ""L'Oca del Cairo"", composed in 1783, just before ""Nozze"", when Mozart was desperately looking for a good libretto. Put together, these fragments represent less than an hour of music. But these DVDs last for 3h16...So what about the remaining two and a quarter hours? Basically, there is the dialogue of Schloemer, less inspired than in ""Semplice"", but delivered by the ever beautiful actress Marianne Hamre. Then there are many fragments of unfinished works by Mozart (particularly awkward works for a now-defunct instrument, the glass harmonica), some arias, chamber music and, at the end of Part III, fragments of the Requiem...

But as one can easily imagine, there is no consistency nor any common theme between all the pieces illustrating this ""stage work"", bar the fact that they were all composed by Mozart. And contrary to what happened in Semplice, Schloemer didn't try to stick to a story or to a concept: he remains abstract all the way and frankly quite obscure. In Part II Hamre quotes some letters of Mozart about his condition as an artist, Ann Murray turns up and sings (twice) the leitmotiv of the evenings, the lied ""Abendempfindung"", the beautiful dancer Graham Smith goes through a good routine (getting boring nonetheless when it is repeated ad nauseam by more dancers in Part III), then more Abendempfindung, etc...Needless to say after 20 minutes I lost interest, Schloemer used Mozart's music as a soundtrack for his own fantasies and frankly who cares?

Part III started better, only because the very successful musical team of ""Semplice"" was back: I have commented endlessly on the qualities of Malin Hartelius, Josef Wagner, Miljenko Turk and Jeremy Ovenden. No need to repeat what we said on conductor Michael Hofstetter and his marvellous orchestra, the Camerata Salzburg. They're all back to their own qualities here but one senses that it is more difficult this time around because they are left to themselves on this big stage and are not given any opportunity to give any sort of credibility to their characters. As a result, despite their individual musical qualities, they cannot prevent the performance from falling into chaos and ultimately, boredom. After the intermission, Schloemer succeeds in definitely putting to sleep his audience by illustrating 20 minutes of very average Mozart fragments by the same choreography he presented in the Part II of his trilogy...To put a long story short, these very unpleasant 196 minutes were about to get just one star when the finale occurred, illustrated by the Requiem. As a metaphor for death, this section of the work was very successful and moving, with the lights disappearing little by little, with just the face of the radiant Marianne Hamre being lit, lighting a cigarette and sitting down, thoughtful until darkness definitely invades the stage...This was gorgeous, but only lasted the last 10 minutes of the performance, much too late to save it. Too bad: it shows the potential and the talent of Schloemer, but the preceding three hours showed all too well his failings and in a way, his vanity...A really frustrating lesson in unfulfilled potential.",1169942400,16,4274,5.1189111747851
