The other information was informative,  I think the title could be a bit different though.",1494547200,,265,4.3061224489795915
8129979,1,B000GAKP2C,This was much about cooking foods I would not ever buy or make.  Low budget video.,1179187200,4,82,4.125

8129981,1,B000GAKP2C,"If anything about this lecture can be considered fun, then hell is going to be a real party.  The first half of the DVD (it seemed like about 3 hours, but was probably 45 minutes) consists of Ms Tigue seated, unmoving, with folded hands, staring directly into the camera and reciting a carefully memorized lecture.  The camera angle never changes.  To be fair, Ms Tigue articulates well, and she does not abuse the English language as do so many nowadays.  But, several times, I found my mind wandering, and I'm afraid I didn't retain a great deal.

In the second half of the video, Ms Brown demonstrates cooking techniques and recipes, while Ms Tigue nods approvingly.  In this segment they employ a second camera positioned slightly higher to demonstrate chopping and mixing and slicing.  Ms Brown also articulates well, but overworks the word, ""actually"".

I'm sure the stars of this show are competent and perhaps even talented, but they should have hired an equally able film maker.",1177372800,6,987,4.868263473053892
