3116981,5,B0013LRKVC,"I had never heard of this series till a couple of months ago when I happened to catch an episode on USA.  My reaction was WOW! This series has it all!  There is action, romance, comedy, great character developement, courtroom  drama and the incredible chemistry among the cast especially between the two leads Harm and Mac. Watching this series will make you feel glad you are American.  It exudes patriotism, honor, character, and a sense of always doing the right thing no matter what the cost.  I have the first 5 seasons and am anxiously awaiting season 6.  I have just worked my way through season one, wonderful!  This is an incredible season to supposedly be the worst of the 10!  Admitedly it can be a bit far fetched at times but hey who cares?  This is a feel good series!",1207353600,16,782,4.48936170212766

I love the honesty in the characterizations of the main characters.  I also love the spiritual components.  I do not know how closely the episodes mirror real life, but, I think the series helps the viewer to remember that freedom is not cheap - it is bought with a price.

I feel they should get together, but I am sure it will happen sooner or later. When he find out he has a brother it gets really good. When Mack becomes engaged and is planning her wedding, she has second thoughts when Harm makes a confession. I di not like what happened to Bud, but it will be interesting to see this unfold.

3117340,5,B0013LRKVC,"I always enjoy the performance of David James Elliott.  By reading many of the interviews that he has had, most of Commander Rabb's character seem to be himself.  It is possible that is one of the reasons that his performance is very natural and fitting in his role.

3117385,5,B0013LRKVC,"One of the most infuriating aspects of DVDs is when the making of them doesn't let you skip the opening and go to the start of the episode.  You only need to see so many of the opening name and scenes that repeated each week of the series, when watching episode after episode.  Additionally, they have an all play, so you don't have to go back to the menu each time,scroll down the list to the next episode in sequence and select it - you can watch one, it ends, the beginning comes on, you hit skip and into the next episode you are - delightful.  Besides this is a series worth watching and re-watching and sometimes insightful to how the legal system does and does not work.",1388534400,,677,4.2734375

3117491,5,B0013LRKVC,"This is an EXCELLENT show; from seasons 1-10...

The following is my comment to a 2 star review for the 4th season; which I find an odd way to judge the series anyhow. Either you like it and watch all seasons possible, or you watch a couple of shows and you're done. This person doesn't seem worthy of writing the review if he started in the middle and watched a few episodes. I couldn't help but notice his HOBBY of writing so many reviews of everything.

I have to give HIGH HONOURS for this show; if only for others like myself who grew up constantly hearing of wars, had many relatives involved in many wars and services, and just took it as a part of life. This show, although glamorized, will change your perspective of what National Defense and patriotism mean...
............
I think you missed the whole POINT of the series; and couldn't possibly have watched the whole season, yet alone the full 10 years it ran, and come to the conclusion that you did. If so, you saw only what you wanted; ""Politically Correct storylines with purty people flirting or otherwise fooling around. Good entertainment after a fashion, but not my cup of tea.""

If this were true, I don't think the Navy and the Marines would have exposed themselves as much as they did. What JAG, the TV show did was show you, using actual scenarios from many different cases, much of the true heroism these men and women did and faced. Much was taken out of true files, as taught in one of the documentaries of Bellisario. As the show earned the respect from the ""real life"" Marines and Navy, they were invited to learn more about the actual protocols, happenings, receive real film footage, etc. This all began in Season 2 and continued through the complete series. I think the show has been a dedication to ALL those serving.

More important than the inner office workings (which seem to be what you noticed; this is a GOOD storyline if you follow it), is seeing how all the battle equipment looks & works, the ranks and roles of the people, protocols, etc. I have learned SO MUCH. This is real military footage; (and my husband backs up at least the Navy protocols/ rules, etc). There were also official Navy and Marine representatives on stage/scene/filming, making sure everything is as realistic as possible for the audience to follow.

Yes, it all seems to happen to this one, small, head of JAG unit, of dashing young men and women; but this IS a TV series and needs to keep the social dilemmas, histories, etc, ""where they all came from to where they strive to get themselves to""; that is necessary to discuss the real social problems that remain the undercurrents of these special ""grin and bear it"" personalities. As many of the court cases show, it is an opportunity to take something to the public that needs to be rethought. A large variety of actual ""truths"" come forward in an investigation, that may not have been foreseen initially. There is a lot of ""gray area"" in the court room which leaves the viewer with something to think about for a few days; not just in the JAG court room, but also how it applies into their own lives.

Many of us have our own jobs that risk lives and careers within split seconds, and work hard to get to that highest of perfection; where we know that those who are counting on us have a very good chance of finding 'our best moment' in there. There are many people and occupations that reach that high, but this show is the ONLY SHOW I know of that gives you an inner look, as realistic as it can be, to those people who choose these careers, with so much at stake. I have learned such GREAT RESPECT for ALL THOSE involved in our military. I think we heard so much about it while growing up, that we never understood the true dedication, heartaches and misfortunes.

This IS a much better series than you rated it.
Perhaps you should have stopped watching it once it wasn't for you...",1235952000,4,3904,4.5134370579915135

3117517,5,B0013LRKVC,"This is a great season to watch, in that the characters experience alot of changes, with out 'jumping the shark'. You still like the characters, you recognize them and still want to know more. This season's finale had me counting the days until the fall season premiere.

Harm and Mac are still fighting the good fight, and exchanging those 'looks' that speak volumes. Mic and Renee are still around, setting your teeth on edge at times and then making you laugh out loud. Bud and Harriet are growing as officers and as a family.

 We get to see Admiral Boone in a case that has Harm and Mac going head to head. We take a trip to Russia and get socked between the eyes with a 'surprise' from Harm Sr.'s past. Even Katlyn Pike comes back and stirs the pot and has Harm wondering what she'll say or do next. Half the fun is watching his face when shes in the room, especially when she's talking to, or about, him.

The Admiral is the tough boss with a heart of gold, still at the helm, guiding all of them along. His conversation with a real deal SEAL is a blast from the past that will have you remembering the early days of 'Survivor'.

It's a great 'shipper' season, many fans were drawn in by the 'Lifeline' episode(directed by David James Elliott)and never looked back. You get an opportunity to see what all the 'intensity' is about, between Harm and Mac. What you will see in this season's last few episodes, will keep you on the edge of your seat to see what happens next.

3117525,5,B0013LRKVC,"When JAG first came out on television, producers and critics anticipated a hard-to-please audience.  Even the military was skeptical about the show and didn't support or add to it for the entire first season.  Once audiences, critics and military leaders caught a glimpse of the show, however, all that changed.

JAG is a pro-military, pro-American ""courtroom"" drama series with a few key elements: it portrays the American military in a positive light, which was very rare during the times of the first few seasons; it also sports a ""courtroom"" drama element, and I use courtroom in quotes for a reason.

JAG is wonderful at identifying with a population of military members, families, and pro-military civilians, but it also attracts the audiences as a action-pumped legal show without being bound to the courtroom.  And with the introduction of Catherine Bell in the second series, helped to create a dynamic mold between the two main characters that perpetuated the show for several outstanding seasons.

JAG, arguable one of the best series of its time, and one of the most popular amongst the military, continues to attract and keep its fans in the 6th season.

Additionally, they have an all play, so you don't have to go back to the menu each time,scroll down the list to the next episode in sequence and select it - you can watch one, it ends, the beginning comes on, you hit skip and into the next episode you are - delightful.

3351988,5,B0013LRKVC,"This is an EXCELLENT show; from seasons 1-10...

The following is my comment to a 2 star review for the 4th season; which I find an odd way to judge the series anyhow. Either you like it and watch all seasons possible, or you watch a couple of shows and you're done. This person doesn't seem worthy of writing the review if he started in the middle and watched a few episodes. I couldn't help but notice his HOBBY of writing so many reviews of everything.

I have to give HIGH HONOURS for this show; if only for others like myself who grew up constantly hearing of wars, had many relatives involved in many wars and services, and just took it as a part of life. This show, although glamorized, will change your perspective of what National Defense and patriotism mean...
............
I think you missed the whole POINT of the series; and couldn't possibly have watched the whole season, yet alone the full 10 years it ran, and come to the conclusion that you did. If so, you saw only what you wanted; ""Politically Correct storylines with purty people flirting or otherwise fooling around. Good entertainment after a fashion, but not my cup of tea.""

If this were true, I don't think the Navy and the Marines would have exposed themselves as much as they did. What JAG, the TV show did was show you, using actual scenarios from many different cases, much of the true heroism these men and women did and faced. Much was taken out of true files, as taught in one of the documentaries of Bellisario. As the show earned the respect from the ""real life"" Marines and Navy, they were invited to learn more about the actual protocols, happenings, receive real film footage, etc. This all began in Season 2 and continued through the complete series. I think the show has been a dedication to ALL those serving.

More important than the inner office workings (which seem to be what you noticed; this is a GOOD storyline if you follow it), is seeing how all the battle equipment looks & works, the ranks and roles of the people, protocols, etc. I have learned SO MUCH. This is real military footage; (and my husband backs up at least the Navy protocols/ rules, etc). There were also official Navy and Marine representatives on stage/scene/filming, making sure everything is as realistic as possible for the audience to follow.

Yes, it all seems to happen to this one, small, head of JAG unit, of dashing young men and women; but this IS a TV series and needs to keep the social dilemmas, histories, etc, ""where they all came from to where they strive to get themselves to""; that is necessary to discuss the real social problems that remain the undercurrents of these special ""grin and bear it"" personalities. As many of the court cases show, it is an opportunity to take something to the public that needs to be rethought. A large variety of actual ""truths"" come forward in an investigation, that may not have been foreseen initially. There is a lot of ""gray area"" in the court room which leaves the viewer with something to think about for a few days; not just in the JAG court room, but also how it applies into their own lives.

Many of us have our own jobs that risk lives and careers within split seconds, and work hard to get to that highest of perfection; where we know that those who are counting on us have a very good chance of finding 'our best moment' in there. There are many people and occupations that reach that high, but this show is the ONLY SHOW I know of that gives you an inner look, as realistic as it can be, to those people who choose these careers, with so much at stake. I have learned such GREAT RESPECT for ALL THOSE involved in our military. I think we heard so much about it while growing up, that we never understood the true dedication, heartaches and misfortunes.

This IS a much better series than you rated it.
Perhaps you should have stopped watching it once it wasn't for you...",1235952000,4,3904,4.5134370579915135

3352014,5,B0013LRKVC,"This is a great season to watch, in that the characters experience alot of changes, with out 'jumping the shark'. You still like the characters, you recognize them and still want to know more. This season's finale had me counting the days until the fall season premiere.

Harm and Mac are still fighting the good fight, and exchanging those 'looks' that speak volumes. Mic and Renee are still around, setting your teeth on edge at times and then making you laugh out loud. Bud and Harriet are growing as officers and as a family.

 We get to see Admiral Boone in a case that has Harm and Mac going head to head. We take a trip to Russia and get socked between the eyes with a 'surprise' from Harm Sr.'s past. Even Katlyn Pike comes back and stirs the pot and has Harm wondering what she'll say or do next. Half the fun is watching his face when shes in the room, especially when she's talking to, or about, him.

The Admiral is the tough boss with a heart of gold, still at the helm, guiding all of them along. His conversation with a real deal SEAL is a blast from the past that will have you remembering the early days of 'Survivor'.

It's a great 'shipper' season, many fans were drawn in by the 'Lifeline' episode(directed by David James Elliott)and never looked back. You get an opportunity to see what all the 'intensity' is about, between Harm and Mac. What you will see in this season's last few episodes, will keep you on the edge of your seat to see what happens next.

3352022,5,B0013LRKVC,"When JAG first came out on television, producers and critics anticipated a hard-to-please audience.  Even the military was skeptical about the show and didn't support or add to it for the entire first season.  Once audiences, critics and military leaders caught a glimpse of the show, however, all that changed.

JAG is a pro-military, pro-American ""courtroom"" drama series with a few key elements: it portrays the American military in a positive light, which was very rare during the times of the first few seasons; it also sports a ""courtroom"" drama element, and I use courtroom in quotes for a reason.

JAG is wonderful at identifying with a population of military members, families, and pro-military civilians, but it also attracts the audiences as a action-pumped legal show without being bound to the courtroom.  And with the introduction of Catherine Bell in the second series, helped to create a dynamic mold between the two main characters that perpetuated the show for several outstanding seasons.

JAG, arguable one of the best series of its time, and one of the most popular amongst the military, continues to attract and keep its fans in the 6th season.

You really ought to get this set.  This isn't something to miss.",1208995200,19,1232,5.004901960784314
