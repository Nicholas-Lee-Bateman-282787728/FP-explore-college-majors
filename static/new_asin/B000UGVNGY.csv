8213236,5,B000UGVNGY,I have gone to Jimmy Ballard because his connected swing allows me to continue playing golf with the limitations of a bad back... something I got from 2 shoot downs in Vietnam resulting in progressive traumatic osteoarthritis.  His connected swing takes my back out of the swing which will allow me to stay competitive for a long time to come. Their customer service has been very professional and accommodated all my needs.  I have tried other teaching professionals and swings with no measurable results.  The Jimmy Ballard Golf Connection is the real swing solution if you have back challenges!!,1379030400,2,598,5.02020202020202
