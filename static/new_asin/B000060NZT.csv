But, it's hold a special place in my heart since it was the first ECW commercial tape i ever got back in 1996
There was no internet i ordered it from a ECW distributor
This also started my OCD, hording, collecting to change from  comic books to psychical media (mostly vhs tapes) which would bleed into dvd's laserdiscs, HD-dvd's and blu rays
Having a additive personality priceless!
I love this particular show mostly cause it was the only ECW i could watch and cherish for a while until B-day, etc.

1. JT Smith joining the FBI
JT Smith and Little Guido vs The Dudleys (Big Dick Dudley & Buh Buh Ray Dudley) This was the early comedy version of The Dudleys
2. Billy Black vs Hack Myers (average)
3. The Eliminators vs  El Puerto Ricano & Joel Hartgood, (with a brawl between the Eliminators and the Gangstas)
4. Raven vs Damian 666 (different)
5.  Shane Douglas vs Axl Rotten (very good match) Douglas starts off shooting on the WWF and WCW it's Classic Shane Douglas
Axl shows off the dude really could wrestle and didn't need all the hardcore stuff to get over
6. Taz vs Chris Jericho  (Shootfight Rules) Chris Jericho carries this match this was ECW still trying to sell Taz as a legit shoot fighter
7. Brian Lee & The Bruise Brothers vs The Pitbulls  & Tommy Dreamer  (Six Man Tag Team Match) anytime you have Brian Lee and Tommy Dreamer things will get crazy!
8. Sabu vs Mikey Whipwreck (very good match)
9. The Gangstas vs  The Headhunters vs The Sandman & Too Cold Scorpio  (Three Way Elimination Tag Team Match) insane chaos

This isn't a major blood and guts type show it's more like a classic SMW or USWA
  Just for nostalgia alone it gets a  8.5/10",1451520000,,1714,4.472668810289389
