It's not your average, gooey, 'they all lived happily ever after' kinda love story. It's what most of us have seen in relationships, with a dark spin added for further reality checks. Just add some ironic comedy to it, and there you have Matt's Chance!
It's also nice to see Eddie Furlong take on a more comedic role, in which he is the perfect 'Matt'. Gary Busey, Margot Kidder and Lee Majors all brought their acting ingenuity to their characters. This movie is definitely a MUST SEE!",1389744000,4,629,4.431034482758621

8614030,3,B00FBE68Q0,"Stick around till the end of the film and you might have a better opinion of it. It probably can not be appreciated by anyone unless they have a random/silly sense of humor.  I've made it a mission to watch all of Edward Furlong's movies and I think ""Matt's Chance"" is one of his most recent modern films.",1487462400,,305,4.258620689655173

8614033,5,B00FBE68Q0,"The movie was very enjoyable.  It arrived within two business days and it was not scratched.  It arrived early and I was very pleased.  Remember Edward Furlong's character Hawk?  Yeah, you're gonna be reminded when you see this movie, and it's not just because of Edward Furlong himself.  This is not a put down.  In my other reviews you will see that I love that movie.  This movie is quite funny, I found it very enjoyable also.  Packed with a lot of twists too.  Who knew that about Lee Majors?  I didn't see it coming!  This film is unpredictable, which I like.  I like how Matt is this bold guy that is not afraid to say whatever he is thinking.  This was worth the money!",1412208000,,677,4.32
8614034,5,B00FBE68Q0,"Dark Comedies Rule! This one is jam-packed with stars and delivers punches from many different directions. Furlong is great. I especially liked Gabor (Bill Sorice). He played his character so well I totally believed him...and the big rabbit, of course...LOL!!! It's well worth the price of admission, so Buy it! Don't miss your ""Chance.""",1404345600,2,337,5.2592592592592595
8614035,5,B00FBE68Q0,"I loved this movie so much, I don't believe it is edwards comeback like some people say. I don't believe he ever went away or whatever. He always amazes me in his movies, defintely my favorite actor. But yea like I said this movie is amazing and it really is different from anything I have ever seen.",1394150400,2,300,4.280701754385965
8614036,5,B00FBE68Q0,"If you're in the mood for an Indie style local production, this is a good flick.  Edward Furlong did some heavy lifting throughout this dark quirky melodrama placed in Seattle.  This new and upcoming local writer/director is garnering lots of experience.  Watch out Hollywood.",1393372800,2,276,5.2272727272727275
8614037,5,B00FBE68Q0,Amazing and awesome!! I would definitely recommend to my circle of friends. It was worth buying to have in my collection!,1393286400,3,121,4.809523809523809
8614038,4,B00FBE68Q0,"I had followed and seen this films trailers and production progress online and via youtube channel before its limited theatrical release a few years before and remained unsure and on the fence about it.

My curiosity was the supporting cast memebers as Lee Majors, Margot Kidder, Garey Busey ect ...  The trailers do not do this film justice.

Received my copy of DVD ahead of time due Feb 5th by standard airmail yet however have today ahead of Jan 17th instead. Very impressed with that i must say, usually takes three weeks.

My trepidatation and uncertainty with ""Matt's Chance"" proved unwarranted and was fun to enjoy.

The positive's for the film are Audio sound is very good as is the movie's soundtrack score and songs with vibrant edgy punch and energy as a somewhat slow pace of exposition scene's begin initially then gear's up into some better suited foward momentum pacing as the story unfold's and progresses pretty good.  Nice colour and photography, fun eccentric supporting characters and lead performance by Ed Furlong as ""Matt"" requires a breif warming up to during first 20 mins or so for an unlikeable character but then thereafter engage's the audience to like him gradually some more.

Everybody from Matt's ex-fiance' Jessica(Brandy Kopp)her new Bank Manager lover to Matt's new sympathetic Middle eastern boss, his hip  Preist best friend to his quietly silent Barber(Lee Majors, who plays his part with an unexpected, twist!) to Mother Mable an aged stripper (Margot Kidder) are a lot of fun to watch and enjoy as Matt tell's his story to his barber explaining the chance encounters of assorted people he meets in his quest for revenge for being spurned by his ex-fancee'.

There is more to this story than simply meet's the eye and unexpected suprises also(well certainly were for this viewer) that elevate's this low budget Independent dark comedy well above average. Some redemption and lack there message's of morality is injected into the character of ""Matt"" with his choices and consequences.

Good quality production by crew & cast with special mention to Writer/Director/Producer NICHOLAS GYENEY I was very pleasantly suprised and frankly didn't expect to like or even enjoy this odd quirky downward spiral love revenge comedy movie ""Matt's Chance"".  Certainly I did though very much all the same thoroughly enjoy would suggest viewers also give ""Matt's Chance"" a chance.
