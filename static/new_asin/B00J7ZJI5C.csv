I waited and waited for the price to drop on this set. AMAZON FAILS ONCE AGAIN FOR THEIR ADVERTISING! I COULD SCREAM NOW. Buyer beware. I've been screwed. ""Your tv show's [NOT] in the cloud."" I've never had this happen to me.
UPDATE:
Since Amazon will not clarify this in their description, in spite of my constant repeating to them of specific product updates...
U.S./CANADA (REGION A) PURCHASERS, this Ultraviolet WILL NOT WORK for your territory. The advertising in the picture, showing the UV included, it only applies to region B. So if you are a collector of Digital HD, do not be tempted by the price drop! The code is invalid, no matter where you try to redeem it. U.K. ONLY.",1431302400,,835,4.610738255033557

Thoroughly enjoyable to watch this highly crafted story unfold.  Made me want to go back and work in DC again.  Miss the action and intrigue.  Was addicted from the start.  Needed to watch several episodes back-to-back to keep up with the intrigue.",1449532800,,393,4.791044776119403

8648647,5,B00J7ZJI5C,"This series was lent to us by a relative. From the very first episode, you are hooked. If this series is even remotely close to how our government works, we may as well give up. My wife and I finished this series in about 3 days. The story and plot are absolutely riveting ... and you can not wait for the next episode to see what happens next. I am NOT going to go into details, I am just going to say the casting and acting were absolutely superb. There was only one single character in the entire series that you will even remotely like, and that was Freddy, the ribs guy (yet even he turned out to be flawed to a degree). We realized that there was not a single politician, lobbyist, staff member, military, etc that the series portrayed that was at all sympathetic or likable. The government that was portrayed in this series needed to be flushed down the toilet, but that would ultimately desecrate the toilet.",1440892800,,916,4.394117647058824
