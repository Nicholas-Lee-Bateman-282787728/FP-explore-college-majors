2652958,5,B000I3NJ3Y,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this DVD. It is bright and engaging with fun songs.  It includes several stories, one about being active, one about eating well, and one about cleanliness/hygiene. Two year olds have discriminating taste and this passes the test with flying colors!",1336521600,2,272,4.913043478260869

The show is wonderfully encouraging, respectful, fun, catchy, and addictive for my kids.  My daughter loves going to the grocery store after watching the food segment and now sings the song the whole grocery trip.  The Christian values are well-integrated without being corny.

2652969,5,B000I3NJ3Y,"Now, you may be thinking
""Oh No NOT another Barney! One was too many!""
Look, there's a lot more to this show than that. This is twice as educational, twice as fun, its colorful, and your kid will probably enjoy it.
Assuming your a:
Christian who loves God that is.
If you ARE NOT---!
This may not be for you. I won't be the one to infringe on others beliefs here. I will expect you to do the same.

This DVD was made by ~Christians~, to be both educational and express good values, while still being fun for the little ones. Adults will not find this movie/ show very entertaining(you will be bored mostly), like other animated movies might entertain, but its not really supposed to, it is wholesome good entertainment for the little ones you have running around.

Good for young ages starting at around 1yr and older.

The Christian values in this DVD aren't overly done, but they do Pray, as all Christians do/should, and God is mentioned a couple of times, and songs are sung about him once or twice. If this offends you DONT BUY IT. Its quite simple really.

This is my opinion, based on the facts I understand. I hope your little ones enjoy it as much as mine do.
Thanks for reading.",1391904000,5,1188,4.410958904109589
2652970,5,B000I3NJ3Y,Bought for 2 yr. old granddaughter.  She was very pleased with it.  Instructions for putting it together were not difficult to follow.,1388188800,,134,5.045454545454546
2652971,1,B000I3NJ3Y,"Why do we feel like we need a 'Christian' alternative to every secular character?  This is Barney with an over-the-top family that no family could hold a candle up to.  It paints a world where everything is perfect and there is no problems, and makes you feel ridiculous if you do have problems in your family.  Can we please just bring back Mr. Rogers?",1386201600,,353,4.484375
2652972,5,B000I3NJ3Y,"gentle and enjoyable. the children and I watch it over and over again. (and it's not sappy as I originally feared.) good learning material, enjoyable songs (never thought I would say that!), and sweet prayers.",1380844800,4,209,5.0
2652973,5,B000I3NJ3Y,We were looking for videos to play in the car for our grandchildren.
