3545285,4,B001E1HCQO,"The plot to kill Hitler by a top aide, Von Sauffenberg is well known to historians, but in light of the recent release of Tom Cruise's movie on the subject, there is new interest in the subject. This documentary not only gives a graphic and detailed account of the Von Sauffenberg plot, but lays the historical groundwork for the decision to undertake the assasination attempt. In addition, this documentary discusses the many other plots to kill Hitler, some by his own top officers. This documentary makes use of interviews with those close to the Von Stauffenberg attempt, including at least one surviving conspirator, and Von Sauffenber's wife. A second disc conatins other side material which displays nothing more than a re-hash of well known footage, such as Hitler's home movies and is of little interest to the serious historian, but the main disc is quite worthwhile for anyone interested in an in depth look at this famous plot.",1233705600,,939,4.949367088607595

Lately I've been amped up by all the commercials and trailers surrounding the release of the movie staring Tom Cruise ""Valkyrie"". I've read all about the film. I read where it has been pushed back many times, and also read where the Germans resisted the film being produced in Germany because of Cruises beliefs and the fictitious content. Notwithstanding I couldn't care less because any Bryan Singer and Cruise flick and war involved count me in!!!

However, since I couldn't get the rush of the December 25th Valkyrie I decided to order this film. I must say I feel very informed now and ahead of the game. What happened in 1944 is such a very important part of our worlds history. This Documentary contained interviews from precious family members of the ones who planned the assassination and even an interview from the last surviving member! Not too mention that I saw in the credits that the German Memorial/Historical society gave this film the OK! Lastly, I must say the Stauffenberg in this film actually looks more like the real stauffenberg in the photos than Tom Cruise. Tom is wayyy shorter than Stauffenberg.

For Valkyrie film and Historical enthusiasts this is a must buy!",1229558400,2,1418,5.616822429906542
3545288,4,B001E1HCQO,"A very good account of the German Resistance movement and the various attempts by the hundreds of German officers and citizens who were involved in plans to assassinate Hitler during WWII.

I've watched many documentaries and movies about WWII and the failed attempts to assassinate Hitler. This highly informative, fascinating documentary pays tribute to those who risked (and lost) their lives attempting to rid the world of one of the most pyschopathic, genocidal killers in modern history. (NOTE: I'd love to see something similar done about one of the world's other ruthless, mass murderers -- Josef Stalin).

This documentary includes comments from several family members of those Resistance members who were killed by the Nazis.  Other enlightening comments are from noted historians of WWII and the Nazi reign.

While some may fault aspects of this documentary, I recommend it to those, such as I, who knew little to nothing about the German Resistance and, in particular, the 20 July Valkyrie plot.",1228089600,26,1007,5.236024844720497
3545289,2,B001E1HCQO,"This DVD is marketed as the utlimate documentary on Operation Valkyrie.  It doesn't come close to the Oscar-nominated ""Restless Conscience."" It has some good content but there is far too much filler and the story of the July plot is not put solidly in its context as part of a German Resistance movement that spanned 1933-1945. The live recreations are laughable in terms of casting and accuracy and the ""interviews"" with experts and surviving family members consist of 2 to 3 sentence snippets. This could have been so much more. The second disc of extras has some good stuff but why add an hour of Eva Braun's home movies?  What does that have to do with killing Hitler?  It just more padding to look like value added. This is a cheaply produced and amateurish ""Valkyrie"" rip-off.

8296055,5,B001E1HCQO,"THREE HOURS WELL WORTH VIEWING FOR GERMAN HISTORY BUFFS.

A rare but scholarly documentary fascinates. Particularly segments on the Berghof, Adolf Hitler's 1927-1945 Obersalzberg home showing several fairly ""normal"" looking women with nice personalities. Oblivious of the war crimes happening far away, the men often smile at one another and at the women.

An excellent documentary, with few flaws worth mentioning. The two hours of bonus features were quite exceptional and very informative, particularly  interview with  Philipp Freiherr von Boeselager, the second-to-last surviving member of the 20 July 1944 conspiracy. Boeselager died shortly after the this DVD interview on 1 May 2008. The ""last man standing"" Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin died on Friday 8 March 2013.  Both deserve honoring.

Without being sentimental about it, in my opinion, the Germans remain better democrats than their teachers in telling the truth about history. When can we expect to have kids in USA schools learn the truth about The American War?

The Gedenksttte Deutscher Widerstand (Stauffenberg memorial and museum) is only a few meters from public transportation and close to one of Germany's best run Youth Hostels.

I've been there twice and plan on returning again this summer. This documentary is true to history and will survive fact checking. Both film proper and the extras show a good attention to accurate detail.  Note that most, if not all, conspirators came from a religious tradition but formal effective opposition to Hitler from key Lutheran and Roman Catholic leaders remained underwhelming. Thus It's more than appropriate to honor ""Christians"" of moral fiber such as those depicted. Contrast them with George Bush!

Remember that from 1933 until today of the millions of Wehrmacht soldiers ""serving"" in the east ( many involved in horrible genocides ) NO Catholic soldiers were ever excommunicated. ZERO. ZILCH. It's too late now (without new doctrine) but it would have symbolic value if Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler had been excommunicated. At times his speechs were filled with religious fervor. Faith-based immoral actions are not new.

He loved invoking ""Providence"" as he claimed to be doing the work of god. Nazi soldiers ""serving"" under Hitler all wore ""Gott mit Uns"" as belt buckles.
To be fair and balanced, history will not look kindly upon Pope Pius XIII.

Cardinal Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) gave Hitler early support in April 1933 with his signing the Concordat. (One of the earliest treaties under Hitler)
It was an unholy marriage of convenience between Hitler and Vatican.
I agree with reviewers saying ""great for history buffs.""  Yes, indeed.
