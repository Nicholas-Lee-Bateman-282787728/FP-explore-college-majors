Scholastic Videos are awesome, and my own kids and I never get tired of watching the stories we've read thousands of times comes to life on the screen.  Would recommend to anyone who already enjoys these stories in book format,and also for those looking to hear stories they may not have heard before.",1488240000,,424,4.702702702702703

8332267,4,B001P72A0K,"I understand a parent's concern about the story, The Five Chinese Brothers.  I just wanted to write that this story is why I purchased this video, even though I have an earlier scholastic dvd with Pete's a Pizza.  When I was much younger, The Five Chinese Brothers was my favorite book.  Why?  It's all about magic!  I loved seeing what the brothers could do and in the end, they each outsmarted the people and mom was happy to have all her sons home.  What worries us as parents sometimes has no baring on what entertains a child. Children don't worry the way we do. I can't wait for my children to see the magic of the Five Chinese Brothers, and the other stories too.  I highly recommend Scholastic Video collections, especially How Do Dinosaurs and other Tales that Rhyme, Good Night Gorilla, HE's Got the Whole World, and The Chicka Chickas.  We love them all!",1266192000,,865,4.535483870967742
8332268,1,B001P72A0K,"I want to warn you about this Scholastic video. It is NOT apropriate for young children! I watched this video with my 4.5 year old daughter - and I was stunned! The last story, ""The Five Chinese Brothers"", is about five brothers who try to escape/survive a judge's attempts to execute them - first by beheading, then by drowning, then by a burning at the stake, then by suffocation in an oven. Villagers are cheering on each execution attempt and become increasingly angry when the execution attempts fail. I can't believe that a company like Scholastic would include such a story in a DVD for young children. How in the world can you explain this kind of story to a young child? I am a progressive mom and this video absolutely floored me! What were they thinking???????!",1244764800,4,772,4.642335766423358
