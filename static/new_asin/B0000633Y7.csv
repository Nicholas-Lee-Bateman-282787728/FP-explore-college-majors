1687199,5,B0000633Y7,"This is the newest Digimon series. This time it's real. There are three kids that this is based on in the beginning, 2 boys, Takato and Henry, and a girl, Rika. Takato loves Digimon, he plays the card game with his two friends, Kenta and Kazu, everyday after and before school. One day Takato draws a new Digimon that he calls Guilmon. Before school the day after that, he was playing cards(and winning big time) and his friends left to get to school and Takato dropped his cards and found the Blue Card that he swiped through his card reader. The card didn't go through the slot easily and he got a Digivice when the card went through. That's all I'll tell. Look for the DVD too. E-mail me.",1016236800,,691,4.364341085271318

7958392,5,B0000633Y7,"i wasn't impressed at first but i got used to Takato and Guilmon, the rest kind of grew on me. Rika's attitude in the beginning was fairly annoying, but after getting some of her background story everything starting falling together and it started to make sense.

This tape puts you in the hotseat for the beginning of season03, it starts off with Takato fining a blue card that lets him create guilmon. Rika doesn't understand digimon are not about power at first(in later episodes after these episodes), she however learns what's the real purpose of her and her partner along with the others she thought were just there for her to fight with. Calumon is a cute stray who is wandering around without seeming to have a real purpose to the story so far. Henry who got a digivice computer game for his birthday and ends up being sucked in the computer to his Terriermon  one day and learns his digimon does exist and he ends up friends with Takato and his friends and later Rukia too.",1305331200,,982,4.5423728813559325
7958393,5,B0000633Y7,"Ok, first thing I have to say... I have watched all of season 3 four times and then some, and it has NEVER gotten old! It introduces some new digimon, has a plot that goes far beyond that of the previous two seasons, and also unlike the first two seasons, it starts out in the real world instead of the digital world!

I can confidently recommend this to anime viewers and fans of any age!",1114300800,2,389,4.1866666666666665
7958394,1,B0000633Y7,"Let me just say first of that digimon was cool when it first came out. All the kids liked it just like pokemon, but now...its really starting to get lame! I just outgrew it. I mean when shows like outlaw star and trigun came along digimon couldn't compete. Its cool for younger kids, but as for us teens, its just to embarrassing.",1089072000,,330,4.338709677419355
7958395,1,B0000633Y7,Digimon is begining to get oh so Boooooringgggg...*snore* oh sorry I fall asleep just thinking about it. Their no longer in the digital world so why bother watching it? Believe me don't buy this video. It's a waste of money...*snore*:(,1083715200,,235,4.9
7958396,5,B0000633Y7,"Disney/Buena Vista has finally released Digimon Tamers on video, and in my opinion, I think its the BEST Digimon series that was created. Though I wonder why they opted to not release this on DVD...
Anyway, Tamers seems to have a complex plot(for an anime that kids can watch), dealing with secret agencies, children with traumatic pasts or problems, and the search for the answer to the question, ""Why do Digimon exist? Are they just for playing with?"". Its sortof like Neon Genesis Evangelion meets Digimon(Though its obviously not psychologically deep as Evangelion).
 This video has the first four dubbed episodes of Digimon Tamers, although Disney didn't title all of the episodes, so its a bit hard to tell when an episode ends or begins.
 The voice acting for the english version is pretty decent. Yamaki's voice suits his character, and so does Rika's. Takato's was okay too. The only person's dubbed voice that I had a problem with was Henry's. His voice was a bit too 'scratchy' sounding. The opening sequence 'song' was catchy, but it doesn't compare to the original japanese opening song. The music was totally replaced, and I actually liked it. The original rock-guiter-type background music didn't really suit the mood of the series(in my opinion), but the newly-added score gives it a movie-like and ominous atmosphere. Overall, this was one dub that I could listen to without getting my ears injured. Those interested in this genre of anime should get this video and see the rest of the series especially to get the full experience.",1052092800,,1548,4.95
7958397,5,B0000633Y7,"After Digimon Season 1 and 2, here it is, Season 3. Ok, there are these 3 kids. Takato, Henry and Rika. Now a little about them. Takato draws during school and he plays the card game with his friends, Kazu and kenta. Henry, Is a caring guy who has a little sister named, Suzzie. He is into computers. Personally I would think he is a quiet type. Last but not least, Rika. Rika is more of a fighting type of girl. She wins the Digimon card game tourment. How they each got their digimon is very different. First Takato runs into this area and he finds guilmon. Henry is playing a Digimon game(which he got from his dad) and finds that terriermon is real. Rika got her digimon by... well I forgot. In all I would buy this movie.",1046304000,2,726,4.23021582733813
7958398,5,B0000633Y7,"10 year old Takato Matsuda is an average boy who loves to play games with his friends, especially a game called ""Digital Monsters Card Game"" or for short Digimon. After creating his latest mater peice a drawing of his own made up digimon called Guilmon, Takato goes to get his Digimon cards. But when he spills the cards and finds a odd blue card which he scans he unlocks the portal to the digital world. The card scanner he used to scan the card becomes an odd device and later by accident scans Takato's image of Guilmon. Later Takato runs out of time to find his drawing has now become a living Digimon, making him a Digimon Tamer! Along with him there are two more children with Digimon, Rika Nonaka a young 10-year-old who is the best player at the game besides a boy named Ryo Akiyama, who owns a digimon named Renamon. Rika unlike Takato is cold hearted and thinks of digimon as battling tools she later has many conflicts with Takato & Henry. Henry is the other boy I mentioned. Henry Wong is another 10 year old who is a genius at many things but it's a computer freak of a kid, his Digimon's name is Terriemon. Together the three of them encounter the Digimon who come out of the Digital Fields and get rid of them before they destroy the town. Some digimon they meet are the super cute & small ledendary creature Caulumon who's not as he appears & the evil digimon who hates humans, Impmon. As they go on the children will find more Tamers, evil digimon, and programs that can clone bodies and take other beings captive. This new world of new children is known as ""Digimon Tamers!"" The show is very good and just today in America ended it's finale episode. I suggest to order this item if your an anime fan, because unlike the other digimon series this one is real.",1023494400,5,1777,4.404255319148936
