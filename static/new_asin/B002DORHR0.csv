3912042,5,B002DORHR0,"I truly enjoyed the 4 movies that are sequals to the TV Drama Cagney & Lacey. They all were up to par to the excellence that characterized Cagney and Lacey week after week while it ran on TV. And the extra features, which are commentary by producer Barney Rosenswieg as well as Sharon Gless & Tyne Daly was interesting  Being female and having had worked as a law enforcement officer, I related to more than the pertinent issues this show presented. When they cancelled Cagney & Lacey, I felt a big hole left in the small screen.  That is until the cable channels started producing quality TV Drama again.  I suppose it would be no surprise to those who know me that my current favorite in this genre is THE CLOSER.

And now something aimed at Amazon.  When are we going to see the rest of the seasons for Cagney & Lacey up for sale @ Amazon?  What is taking sooooooooo long?",1264809600,,875,4.37037037037037
3912043,4,B002DORHR0,"I look forward to the other complete seasons but the movies are a nice bookend companion for Season 1 until then.  The principal stars are excellent but I agree with other reviewers who note that the films (and the television series) were also enhanced by the superb performance of John Karlen.  John is a very underrated actor but his career has spanned from early 1960's television through his signature role as Willie Loomis on Dark Shadows (1966-1971) to many great film characters in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's.  Check out his listing on IMBb and watch for, purchase, or borrow any of his television performances and films.  You will rarely be disappointed.",1258588800,,665,4.910714285714286
3912044,5,B002DORHR0,"Whats amazing about these four TV movies is how they retain the feeling of the original TV show. Each film feels like a slightly extended TV episode (and that's a compliment!). Just like the wonderful series, there is a central mystery to each but the REAL focus and power is in the the lives of Cagney and Lacey. The writers wisely chose to remain faithful to the TV show and not try to change a winning format just because they had more time to tell the story. These four films were made when several other TV shows were being brought back to TV in reocurring TV movie formats (like Columbo, The Rockford Files and Perry Mason). Its a shame that C&L was treated so badly when CBS changed presidents and after very impressive reviews and ratings, the second two TV movies were dumped in bad time slots with no advance advertising. Each film contains a newly-produced 20-minute interview that offers fascinating, affectionate, and brutally honest recollections by Tyne Daly, Sharon Gless, producer Barney Rosenweitz and creator Barbara Corday. You can't go wrong purchasing this DVD set. Remember that your purchase shows there is an interest in bringing the complete series to DVD. So, make your purchase in the hopes of guaranteeing their release!",1255478400,9,1249,4.868544600938967
3912045,5,B002DORHR0,"I don't understand why after season 1 we get the post tv movies and not season 2. can someone explain this to me ?
 It's great to have the series finale but we want all the remaining seasons to be released as well.",1247616000,15,214,3.9767441860465116
3912046,5,B002DORHR0,"Cagney and Lacey are back -  my favorite female police partners return in this four-disc boxed set featuring all of their reunion movies on DVD for the first time.

The team of Christine Cagney, portrayed brilliantly by Sharon Gless, and Mary Beth Lacey, portrayed equally well by Tyne Daly, hardly need any introduction. Co-starring in Cagney & Lacey during the 1980's, the women portrayed two women detectives fighting crime and sexism in the New York City Police Department.

In doing so, Cagney & Lacey redefined gender roles in TV dramas. Now, it hardly seems possible that a series starring two women leads would not only be controversial, but a true pioneer in challenging the sexism that prevented women from obtaining untraditional jobs, but it was. While another groundbreaking cop show of that era, Police Woman, starring Angie Dickinson, should also be lauded, it was Cagney & Lacey that went much further in focusing the series spotlight on two professional women, and dealt directly with the sexism that they encountered among the public and within the own New York City police department.

The series went off the air in 1988, after 125 series episodes. Four reunion movies followed, and are collected here on DVD for the first time: Cagney Lacey: The Return, 1994; Cagney & Lacey: Together Again, 1995; Cagney & Lacey: The View Through the Glass Ceiling, 1995; and Cagney & Lacey: True Convictions, 1996.

""Inside this package you will also find some history excerpted from my memoir `Cagney & Lacey... and Me,' along with some other observations about the four reunion films,"" said Barney Rosenzweig, creator-producer of the series and the movies. Rosenzweig is also married in real-life to Sharon Gless.

The first film re-introduces Cagney and Lacey, and what they've been up to in the intervening years. Things have changed. Lacey has quit the force, and Cagney is now a lieutenant working for the D.A.'s Office. But the biggest change is that Cagney has married, and the two best friends have lost touch.

""Both Sharon and Tyne had aged and put on some weight and we would make no attempt to mask that, but would, instead, hang a lantern on it. It was quickly decided that, consistent with her characters oft-stated desire, Lacey would by then have taken her retirement while, in those intervening years, Cagney would garner a major promotion and (much to Sharon s dismay), gotten married. Even casting her old pal, TONY award winner James Naughton as the husband, could not get Sharon to be happy about this decision...which we defended as a device we felt would help sell the passage of time to our audience,"" Rosenzweig said.

In addition to Naughton's James Burton, the guest-cast includes Susan Anspach, who plays Deborah Nelson.

Happily, most of the supporting cast from the series returns, including John Karlen as Mary Beth's husband, Harvey Lacey; Al Waxman as Lt. Samuels; Carl Lumbly as Det. Marcus Petrie; and Martin Kove as Detective Isbecki. New cast members are David Paymer, who plays Deputy Assistant District Attorey Feldberg; Vonetta McGee who portrays Petrie's wife, Claudia; Kenny Johnston who replaces Troy W. Slaten as the Lacey's son, Michael; and Molly Orr as the couple's daughter, Molly.

""Despite virtually the entire series cast making an appearance in this first of the quartet of films, we make it clear in the early going that both Cagney and Lacey have moved on and that the familiar actors that are seen in those early moments will not be part of the shows going forward. The device to get Lacey back to work and, once again, in alliance with Christine Cagney not only worked well for us, but provided residual emotional material for all four films,"" Rosenzweig, said.

I won't ruin the movies by providing spoilers. Just know that fans, new and old, of Cagney and Lacey will not be disappointed.

John Karlen, an incredible actor who is sadly underrated, appears throughout the movie reunions. Other guest cast members include: George Coe as Dan Broadbent; Lynn Thigpen as Capt. Gigi Cardenas; Chip Zien as Assistant District Attorney Douglas Trayne; and Sandra Oh, as Officer Angela Lum.

The first movie is also being released in a separate single-disc package on the same release date as the boxed set.",1245283200,33,4262,4.985915492957746
3912047,5,B002DORHR0,I have always loved this show. Waited YEARS to have it on DVD.  Now I have ALL of the shows. Even these TV Movies.  GREAT. Love the actresses and actors.,1363996800,,153,4.066666666666666
3912048,3,B002DORHR0,"As an admirer of Tyne Daly's acting skills, I looked forward to seeing these stories on DVD.  Unfortunately, though the effort was good, the effort showed and for me, that spoiled the viewing experience.  And this set is not inexpensive. The stories are going to be one-and-done, so I cannot justify the cost.

The stories are good enough, even though they do require the viewer to suspend disbelief here and there.  But, to me, these DVDs are better borrowed from the library or from Netflix and not purchased.",1347840000,2,511,4.7727272727272725
3912049,5,B002DORHR0,This collection was sick I hated it when I finished the last one I wanted the movies to continue. This is a must have.,1346284800,,118,3.9583333333333335
3912050,3,B002DORHR0,"I enjoyed these dvd's but found the sound quality to be a bit mushy at times, which may be the fault of my age.  The addition of English subtitles would have helped.  They were available  in the dvd of  the first season, and I hope will be there in the other seasons--if they are finally released.",1345075200,,297,4.25
3912051,5,B002DORHR0,I love Cagney & Lacey.  The DVD's are great.  I will buy the whole series when they start releasing them.  I have obviously this one but I also have season 1.,1336435200,,158,4.032258064516129
3912052,5,B002DORHR0,Cagney and Lacey was always one of my favorite programs.  Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless were perfect together. I really missed it when it was over. To be able to watch the shows again was such a pleasure and I look forward to when more of the episodes are made available to us.  I'll be first in line to get it.,1322179200,,308,4.032786885245901
3912053,5,B002DORHR0,For all Amazon customers who bought and love these DVDs but have been asking about the DVD release of the full 125 episodes of the original series - you can help achieve this! Head on over to the official Cagney & Lacey website at www[dot]cagneyandlacey[dot]com and complete the survey which - if sufficient customers respond - will be used to try to persuade MGM to release all 125 episodes on DVD!

3912054,5,B002DORHR0,"I bought this box set of Cagney & Lacey for my wife who was a big fan of the series when it was on. However, we both really enjoyed all four T.V. movies that came in this set. As a side note, the movie ""The Return"" which is sold seperately, is included in this box set. I didn't know that before purcahse, and bought it seperately also. Oh well, theres a tip for the next person..... We own season one of the T.V. series on DVD also and wish they would come out with additional seasons. I don't understand why they aren't out yet.",1295308800,4,530,4.105769230769231
3912055,5,B002DORHR0,"I would think most of Cagney and Lacey fans want to buy the complete set.  It makes no
sense to not bring out Season 2.  I would like to buy the complete set, so why buy Season 1.

There is a complete set out there, but it is probably pirated . so I do not want it.  Whoever makes the decision on these things needs to rethink their decisions.  Look at Scarecrow and Mrs. King.  That is selling really  well.",1272758400,,408,4.025

8365622,5,B002DORHR0,"I am so glad I ordered this. I can't begin to tell you what a pleasure it is to watch them get older and deal with life on older terms. It was well plotted, well acted - to say the least - it was funny, and bittersweet too. The chemistry between Cagney and Lacey is fabulous!! It was simply GREAT - will watch every few months for sure.",1383696000,2,336,3.9558823529411766
8365623,5,B002DORHR0,"Great movies and a great price.  Quality is excellent - the only thing I object to is the that they called the DVD ""The Menopause Years"".....far from that - these ladies are never going to age.  Love the movies.  Got all four.",1377820800,2,226,4.333333333333333

8365625,5,B002DORHR0,"I don't like that they refer to this set as The Menopause Years, but I guess there wasn't a better title when they were filming these movies. Some might find these releases campy, but I truly loved these characters and I'm a fan of the phenomenal actresses who portray them.",1374019200,2,274,4.5
8365626,4,B002DORHR0,The DVDs are good quality. These reunion movies are great since they never got a descent send off with the series.,1366934400,,114,4.476190476190476
