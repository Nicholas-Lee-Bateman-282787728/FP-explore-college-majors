7788283,1,073891908X,"While I really, really was trying to like this performance I couldn't because of number of reasons. There's something that I don't like about all concert DVDs (and this one in particular) and it is boring camera work. It is VERY rare when production brings really relevant overview of what is going on in orchestra. In the world when most of the camera people couldn't even name the instrument in orchestra there's a little change they could follow the piece. As a result all concert DVDs show violinist when viola is playing and bassoon player when oboe is sounding. The worst in this regard is this Sony's recording as the camera work is so out of place; the angles and proximity are so exaggerated the whole performance looks like a workout. I couldn't appreciate Karajan's conducting as the presentation is dry, boring and wipes out Beethoven's music entirely. If you really want to enjoy Beethoven, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beethoven-Symphonies-1-2-3-4-5-6-and-Art-Galleries-of-the-Time-2DVDs-3CDs-Ultimate-MosaicDVD-Collection/dp/B001ETLY1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beethoven Symphonies 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Art Galleries of the Time, 2DVDs+3CDs Ultimate MosaicDVD Collection</a>.

7788284,5,073891908X,This is the first DVD I have bought and these are not my favourite Beethoven Symphonies. But what a revelation! A magnificent and entertaining experience seeing this great conductor at work. Indeed a great monument to his work. If the conductor seems to be an important focus point this is quite fitting since it seems to capture something of the interpretation of this wonderful music (I can't stop listening to it) that isn't that obvious by only listening to the recordings which are available on CD. Strongly recommended.,967507200,4,525,4.9772727272727275
7788285,5,073891908X,"One might judge von Karajan as a person, and find his actions quite low indeed.  Never the less, I have found his DVD of ""Beethoven Symphonies numbers One and Eight"" to be simply outstanding.  As the Greek law  maker Solon suggested so many hundreds of years ago, ""Judge not the  dead for they may place a curse on you the living.""  So, I prefer to  watch and listen to this great work, and leave his serious personal  failings to others.",964051200,2,438,4.4
7788286,1,073891908X,"Karajan is a sad example of the shortcomings of the Nuremberg Trial: although he was one of the conductors pleasing Adolf Hitler, he has been permitted to slaughter Beethoven, Vivaldi (and so many others who didn't  deserve that) when he should have directed only Berlioz or Wagner. Just  listen to Beethoven or Dvorak directed by Eugene Ormandi, or even Georg  Solti, and you'll understand why I think that Karajan got for music the  same lightness as a lead-footed deep-sea diver got for dancing the can-can.",963187200,,510,4.964705882352941
7788287,5,073891908X,"At this point, Sony has released all of its von Karajan performances of the Beethoven symphonies on five DVDs. They are all very good performances, created for film (rather than concert performance) in the early 80s.  Von  Karajan conducts the Berlin Philharmonic, his personal orchestra, and the  performance is as much von Karajan as Beethoven.  Musically, these are very  fine performances, with von Karajan in absolute control of the orchestra  which plays very precisely.  These are the performance as he wanted to  present them -- smooth, well thought-out, and note-perfect.  This  particular disk gives a chance to compare early symphony to a much later  one and see how much the composer expanded the form.
There is probably no  right way to put symphonic music onto film -- these productions (made by  conductor's own film company) spend most of their time focused on the  conductor with cut-away shots to both individual and groups of  instrumentalists (also singers in the 9th), usually focusing on the  instruments themselves rather than the players.
It is fascinating to  watch von Karajan -- his authority in the music and with this orchestra are  clear thoughout each performance.  He conducts without a baton and uses his  whole body to conduct, though not in a distracting way (I am thinking of  Leonard Bernstein here).
The sound and picture on these DVDs are  excellent; the sound is truly comparable to a well-recorded CD.  The  soundtrack is available both in stereo and also an excellent 5.1 Dolby mix.  The disks have a set of program notes and a biography of von Karajan.",962236800,8,1595,4.9961832061068705
7788288,5,073891908X,"This DVD gives the listener the opportunity to compare the early and late Beethoven. The early, Haydn-style Beethoven's first symphony should made a dramatic impression on the public at the time it was first performed. It's  so powerful and elegant at the same time. The incredible last movement  makes you ask why this symphony is so rarely interpreted.  The Eight was  one of Beethoven's favorites. In my youth (not so long ago) it was one of  my least favorites. It was years later while listening my complete  collection and working on something else that I ""discovered"" it. Among his  last symphonies this one is one of the ""classic""style, or so they say, but  it has one of the most spectacular developments (middle part of the first  movement). Beethoven was great in developments, and this one begins with a  rhythmic ""ta-ta-ta-taa"" theme that very much resembles his famous Fifth.  Then, the first theme of the movement is developed in a fugue, which leads  to a dramatic and glorious triple forte. The last movement has one of the  famous endless Beethoven's finals. These performances are impossible to  criticize, so powerful they are, and the BPO is without any doubt the best  playing Beethoven. I love the way this guys put all their energy in the  music. This DVD sets the last two remaining symphonies of the collection. I  wonder when they are going to publish the overtures!",961286400,4,1393,4.859574468085106
