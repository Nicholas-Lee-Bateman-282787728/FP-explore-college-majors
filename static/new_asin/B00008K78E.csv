7984863,5,B00008K78E,"A stylish Israeli crime comedy, Mars Turkey tells the story of Reuven, a police captain in charge of protecting Shimon, the last remaining witness in a trial against crime-lord Patrick Sarusi. Seeing as how Patrick has managed to get to all the other witnesses, Reuven is so desperate to keep Shimon alive that he assigns himself to watch-duty, with the intention of never letting Shimon out of his sight. But as the trial draws near, events start spinning out of control when, in an act of desperation, Reuven sends his sexually frustrated mistress, Aya, to plant a bug in Patrick's apartment. Encouraged by Patrick's neighbor, Aya decides to confront Reuven about his sexual inadequacy and his vain promises to her about leaving his wife, just as Patrick slips out of house-arrest. Will Reuven be able to keep his mind on the job while his love life melts down in front of his eyes?

The movie is hilarious, brilliantly written and has great cinematography. There are plenty of plot twists, and the style is a cross between Guy Ritchie and Jean-Pierre Jeunet. I highly recommend it, as it's my favorite Israeli film.",1246233600,,1118,4.853403141361256

7984865,5,B00008K78E,"The movie is not Turkish, and it's not a TV show- so if you're looking for either of those you will be sadly disappointed.

It's a classic Israeli Movie in Hebrew with English subtitles about, as the above person stated: gangs, etc.

If you like international movies, it is a great movie, and I recomend it strongly.",1107388800,,316,4.526315789473684
7984866,1,B00008K78E,"This DVD was not what I thought.  It is not the TLC show ""Clean Sweep"".  It is a movie made in Turkey about gambling, guns, etc.  I cannot tell - the writing is all in a different alphabet altogether, and I did not watch it - I returned it.  I'm writing this 'review' just to let any other unsuspecting person know a little something about this DVD. Since there is no image available, and there was no information to let buyers know what it was.",1105228800,7,445,4.2
