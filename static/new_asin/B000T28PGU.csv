when he latches onto a subject he follows it until he has an excellent grasp of
the subject.  I bought him several DVD's of WWII and I assume he was
happy with that.",1352505600,,238,4.386363636363637

It was supposed to be easy. capturing this volcanic island.  There was no jungle, no civilians to get in the way.  The island had been shelled heavily by navy ships.  Surely, it was thought, few Japanese could survive that.  But what they did not know was that the tiny island was honeycombed with bunkers and tunnels, filled with Japanese soldiers who had resolved to die here.

This documentary uses the actual experiences of Marines and Navy corpsmen.  There is no John Wayne bravado in evidence.  This is the story of men who had but recently been civilians, a farmer from West Virginia, for example, men who had never heard of Iwo Jima, until they went there.

They prevailed.  The airfields were taken and rebuilt on Iwo.  Bombers on their way to and from Japan used the fields won by the Marines with blood.  Lives were lost, but lives were saved in the process.  In many respects, this was the Marines finest hour.

Watch this, definitely.  I'm no military junkie, but I do highly recommend this.",1276905600,3,1165,4.637254901960785
