8376709,1,B002P89K4W,"The first of the 3 American Biograph shorts was so out of focus it was difficult to watch. The second short was a bit less out of focus, and the third was in focus, maybe it took three of them for the makers to get it right. The cover is an ink jet print which lists ""Pride of the Clan"" as the feature, it is actually ""Pollyanna"", which has some frolicsome music playing while Pollyanna's father is dying, so the music is just some generic and inappropriate stuff. The disk has an ink jet printed label, and is a DVD-R, this little fact is mentioned nowhere in the product description, I think it should be! I wanted to buy all of these as a collection of rare Mary Pickford films sounds quite attractive. Honestly I could not recognize her in ANY of the shorts. It's too bad but I've deleted them (the other 4 DVD's in this series) from my Wish List. I think I'll look for good prints of Pickford films elsewhere.",1321056000,10,914,4.289017341040463
