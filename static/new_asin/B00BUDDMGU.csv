5674714,5,B00BUDDMGU,"Ive just gotten my copy of this show on Blu-ray and am completely overwelmed by the quality of this product ""BUT"". After reading the ""product decription"" which says this item is 6 discs and reading the other reviews I am SO CONFUSED! My box set came with ""7"" discs. Two just for bonus features and the sixth disc included the second season opener ""Metamorph""!!! According to the other reviews this is only supposed to be included in the ""Network"" box set but mine had ""Metamorph""! Now don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining by any means! In fact I jumped up and down when I realized that the episode that introduced Maya to us was included in my set. I just don't know if ya'all should be expecting to get it in yours if these others reviews are correct. Maybe the ""Mysterous Unknown Force"" saw fit to give me a little extra bonus on my special features but I hope this will be the case for everyone else too. Anyway, to the quality of this product. To see ""Space"" in its original format and with such clarity is simply AWESOME! This show has been and always shall be my all time favorite since it captured my attention back in 75 when I was a little kid and immediately became obsessed with the Eagle Transporter. Series One is my favorite of the two but I will certainly puchase Series Two if A&E release's it. Thank you A&E for giving us ""Space"" fans the chance to view this show as it should be seen. Now if we can just convince them to support the ""SPACE:2099"" movement and bring the show up to date like they did with Star Trek TOS, all will be well with the world...heres to dreaming...",1287792000,5,1594,4.37037037037037
5674715,5,B00BUDDMGU,"To make it clear, the prints and extras are exactly identical to the U.K release. Also
a very nice surprise The Metamorph episode is also included.

 A&E has taken care of bringing what people were
asking since many years: IDENTICAL prints than U.K created by BBC Ressources in 2005 and
the most super and interesting extras/bonus which are completely new in North America.

Without hesitation this set DESERVE your full support and the team of A&E should be
congratulate for their EXCELLENT work. DO NOT MISS YOUR CHANCE!!!BUY IT!!!",1286496000,4,533,4.966292134831461
5674716,5,B00BUDDMGU,"Make no mistake.  This is THE version that fans in North America have been waiting for!  First, SPACE: 1999 will be presented in its correct 4:3 aspect ratio.  Second, this DVD release will not bare any resemblance to the so-called previous ""remastered"" versions that A&E has released during the past decade which several inside sources have informed me that were actually taken from 16mm, not 35mm prints.  Third, A&E with this Blu Ray release has finally got it right! They are using the same high quality RESTORED 35mm prints that NETWORK released in the UK in 2005.  I own the Region 2 2005 NETWORK box set and, I must say, the prints are absolutely stunning, light years ahead of the old A&E releases.  They will further improve with this A&E Blu Ray release since they will be presented, for the first time, in true HD !

I say sit back and enjoy the engrossing storylines and visual splendor of Series One SPACE: 1999 with the release of this landmark series on Blu Ray for the very first time !",1285977600,27,1002,4.564245810055866

5674718,5,B00BUDDMGU,"Apparently Season 1 of Space: 1999 was remastered in HD in the UK back in 2005 and season 2 was remastered in 2007. They made both a 4:3 version (same as the original TV and DVD editions) and a 16:9. I think the new blu-ray's will probably be a variation of this source. The question is what version of the film will be on the blu-ray, 4:3 or 16:9, or both?

The 4:3 HD version and the 16:9 HD version were broadcast in the UK in 2006. The 16:9 version does show more on the sides which could only be possible if they had original footage that was larger than the original 4:3 broadcast version. There is some slight cropping on the 16:9 usually on the top, such as ceilings. Because I have a 52"" Samsung Plasma TV if I had a choice of one or the other I would choose the 16:9, but would prefer both of course. I've seen a clip of the 2006 UK 16:9 broadcast in HD and it is very impressive!",1282003200,6,890,4.056818181818182
5674719,5,B00BUDDMGU,"Both the Network DVD company from the UK and A&E are releasing our beloved Space 1999 on Blu-Ray, but wait, I hear that A&E are using Network's prints. Hmmm. According to the Catacombs website, Network has announced a Blu-Ray release of the complete Year 1 for 11 October 2010. Price is 79.99. There are 8 discs, in original 4:3 format. Extras include music only tracks, 5.1 remixed audio, and documentaries. A&E will be using the same prints as the Network Blu-Ray release, in pillarboxed 4:3 format, over 6 discs, with a price of $99.95(actually Amazon mentions only 6 discs). There are two less discs than the Network (UK) version- suggesting the US version will have less extras. Well, we shall see how well this set will come out.

5674750,4,B00BUDDMGU,"BOTTOM LINE: While not everyone's cup of tea, SPACE:1999 remains a unique entry in the annals of television science fiction programs, and this gorgeous Blu-ray set will surely delight fans, of which I am one. 4 STARS! (Now what's the hold up on Season Two???)

THE STORY: In the near future man has colonized the moon and a permanent facility has been established: Moonbase Alpha. The governments of the world are using our lunar satellite as a gigantic storage facility for all of Earth's nuclear waste, when the unthinkable happens: in September of 1999, one of the dozens of massive underground nuclear waste stockpiles is accidentally detonated, which causes a chain reaction explosion that literally blasts our moon out of orbit. On its way into deep space the helpless occupants of Moonbase Alpha are catapulted into dimension rifts, hurtle into & out of black holes, and travel thru time warps. Through it all, grimly-determined base commander John Koenig (Martin Landau) works with scientists Dr. Russell & Professor Bergman, (Barbara Bain & Barry Morse), astronauts Alan Carter & Paul Morrow (Nick Tate & Prentis Hancock) and the other men & women of Moonbase Alpha to find a suitable passing planet onto which they can migrate & settle - before the limited supplies on Moonbase Alpha are exhausted.

THOUGHTS: While no where near as much fun as the original STAR TREK, this show still has a charm and allure. That fact that the people are trapped on Moonbase and simply along for the ride with no way to control where they're going works both for and against the series, but their unique predicament definitely sets 1999 apart from TREK and other sci-fi shows. The actors are very somber and that's kind of a downer. Only good-natured Nick Tate as amiable Aussie astronaut Alan Carter has any levity in his performance, occasionally equaled by the rascally Barry Morse as Alpha's resident genius, Professor Victor Bergman. If it weren't for these two actors this series would be a 24-epsiode funeral wake. The F/X are obvious, crude and dated by today's standards but still manage to charm & impress. I loved that the Moonbase and the Eagle ships were very realistically grounded in their designs. The Eagles actually looked like something our Apollo astronauts might have been traveling in within another generation or two, which I suppose was the intent. Guest stars will probably be mostly unknown to those not familiar with British TV, with the exception of genre legend Christopher Lee. This series is a mixed bag and certainly not for everyone. The metaphysical aspect of many of the scripts will be a turn-off to sci-fi action geeks more interested in laser pistol showdowns & intergalactic spaceship shootouts - but in the show's defense, SPACE:1999 has plenty of those, too. You may want to rent or check out a few episodes prior to buying if you're unsure because this restored Season One Blu-ray set is NOT cheap.

THE BLU-RAY BOX SET: Season One of SPACE: 1999 debuts on hi-def Blu-ray gloriously restored with MAJOR improvements in both audio & video! Everything you loved about this old school sci-fi series is made even better now thanks to this seriously upgraded 1080p presentation. Picture is razor sharp and the sound design truly impresses, even in good ol' mono! The meticulous restoration work is admirable. And for lovers of tidbits & trivia there are a TON of terrific bonus extras on disc #7 (and spread out over the other six). Far too much to list here. Trust me, you'll be very happy, as most (if not all) of the special features from A&E's original DVD release have been ported over for this Blu-ray set. Thankfully however, everything's packed in a single, space-saving seven-disc Blu box that only measures 1 inch wide! I own the old shelf-hogging A&E complete DVD set and lemme tell ya, while it's nice, it simply pales in comparison with this sweet-looking & sounding compact Blu-ray release.",1447632000,6,3935,4.932126696832579
5674751,5,B00BUDDMGU,It was the best then and still is I saw it back then when I was a kid,1447372800,,69,2.888888888888889
5674752,2,B00BUDDMGU,"In the year 1999, a massive explosion on the far side of the moon... SOMEHOW propelled it into the far reaches of the galaxy, with a hapless moonbase along for the ride. Remember that?

If you don't, then it probably means you didn't spend that year watching ""Space: 1999"" and lamenting that we don't have interstellar flight and oatmeal-colored jumpsuits. The first season of this cult sci-fi show is a frustrating experience -- it clearly wants badly to be cerebral and thought-provoking, but mostly proves to be slow-moving and woodenly-acted. Furthermore, it often creates serious scenarios for the heroes to face, only to cop out with unexplained godlike aliens or metaphysical phenomena beyond our understanding.

In the year 1999, Commander John Koenig (Martin Landau) is given command of Moonbase Alpha, as Earth prepares to send a spacecraft to a mysterious new planet that might have intelligent life. Unfortunately, people on the Moonbase are suddenly going crazy and dying, and with the help of Dr. Russell (Barbara Bain) and Professor Bergman (Barry Morse), he finds out why -- the deposits of Earth's radioactive waste have turned sectors of the moon into a giant bomb. When the waste ignites, it sends the Moon careening out of its orbit... instead of breaking it apart and propelling the pieces towards Earth, which is the more likely scenario.

And instead of aimlessly floating in space, or perhaps orbiting Mars, the moon ends up zipping through the galaxy at continuous velocity, like a cosmic cue ball. I suspect that the writers didn't really comprehend how large space is. Koenig quickly gives up on the idea of returning to Earth, and decides that they're just going to find another planet to colonize.

As they look for one, they encounter all sorts of strange things: a band of immortals stranded on an ice planet, a heat vampire, aliens (who usually look very human) attacking them for a variety of reasons, a creepy child who grows to adulthood in a day, an alien ""dragon"" that has haunted one of Alpha's crew, a black hole, a savage tribal society on a derelict spacecraft, the seductive peace of Piri, a duplicate moon around a ruined Earth, a planet where everyone degenerates into cavemen, a space brain, a cruel living spaceship, a psychic ""ghost,"" and a probe that creates a breathable atmosphere.

I've often heard ""Space 1999"" described as being a more cerebral brand of sci-fi, compared to shows like ""Star Trek"" or ""Battlestar Galactica,"" which tend to balance out the sci-fi with a fair amount of action. But it really isn't. Too many episodes rely on destiny, godlike aliens or never-explained phenomena for it to be considered cerebral sci-fi. And while it poses many philosophical questions, it only poses those questions -- there's little give-and-take about issues or concepts. That isn't to say that ""Space 1999 Season 1"" is bad... but it's not as remarkable or intelligent as it clearly thinks it is.

Some episodes are quite good. ""Dragon's Domain"" deftly handles the story of a man broken by his determination to tell the truth, and ""Voyager's Return"" touches on the moral issues of a scientist's guilt and culpability for his brilliant but dangerous invention. But sadly, most episodes are either vague and plotless (""Black Sun,"" ""The Last Sunset,"" ""Collision Course"") and try to handwave away all questions by the end with ""Well, something happened but we don't really know what. Back to wandering the galaxy.""

It's also slow. Very slow. This wouldn't be so bad if Moonbase Alpha weren't decorated in Mental Asylum Chic -- oatmeal-colored uniforms, white walls, a sporadic soundtrack, and characters who speak as if they've been dosed with heroin. It's very difficult to focus on a slow-moving story where there's nothing onscreen for the senses to grab onto.

That, sadly, applies to the cast as well, all of whom seem to give strangely artificial performances, like androids imitating human reactions. Morse seems to be one of the few cast members with any life or energy to him: his genial, grandfatherly professor is a very endearing character. But Landau is very awkward in this role, and he's never quite plausible as the charismatic commander of a base -- he's easily eclipsed by many of the guest actors, such as a dignified Christopher Lee, Leo McKern, Peter Cushing and the ever-bombastic Brian Blessed, who seem a lot more comfortable with their smaller roles.

And Barbara Bain is almost mesmerizingly bad here -- wooden and lifeless with blank eyes, as if they somehow got a coma patient to stand upright and speak. She's so bad that it's actually distracting when she tries to emote. And her romance with Koenig is embarrassing -- there's little organic growth to their relationship, and despite having been married at the time, Bain and Landau have the sexual chemistry of two cinder blocks who don't particularly like each other.

And for supposedly-intelligent sci-fi, it makes a surprisingly large number of basic scientific errors: the moon's absence would doom Earth, it would need to be exceeding light speed to move instantly from our solar system, the explosion described would shatter it and send the fragments TOWARDS Earth rather than propelling an intact moon AWAY... the list goes on. I normally can suspend my disbelief in a sci-fi series, but when it's touted as unusually intelligent -- and the problems are in the very PREMISE -- it's pretty hard to overlook.

""Space 1999 Season 1"" sometimes feels like it was trying to be a TV version of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but slow pacing and unanswered questions do not work on a weekly TV show. While there are some very good, suspenseful episodes, the weird acting and deathly dull presentation bog it down badly.",1447200000,,5741,4.982254697286012

The first season is the best of the two seasons it played, in my opinion.  It does have some good actors and ""guest artists"" from the British acting community.  It was the most expensive show on the air at that time and it shows in the effects and the sense that you were on the Moon. The premise is a bit shaky but most of Gerry Anderson's shows had shaky premises.

Will I buy the second: yes, because I am a completest, and this still has some nifty special effects. But, not because any of the stories make sense. A brief case in point: the premise of the series is that the Moon is blown out of its orbit by a gigantic atomic explosion from what is apparently an atomic waste dump. Though it is now hurtling through the galaxy, it can still be attracted by other planets long enough to have hour-long adventures before it hurtles off again. I'll let you think about how that works.

When I was 10 I loved this show... because it was science fiction, and there were no Star Trek episodes I hadn't seen to watch.  I bought one and forced myself to watch it... I own it... maybe you want to come over to my place and watch it to save the $3.00?  Or maybe like me, you like the way they can have so much gorilla glass on a moon base, blow it up each week, and fab new glass all for the following week.
Some of the scenes are painful to get through... and I think there is a plot... but the cool special effects... now those are worth it.  I used to use cardboard and legos to get the same effect in my bedroom.  This brings all of that back in gripping detail.
I may eventually buy and watch more of these... but I think I would recommend the UFO series... the woman are more scantily clad in that series... plus it's much more ""Thunderbird-ish"".  Space 1999 is OK, but there is a lot of other good campy science fiction to watch... I think you just have to pace yourself with this series...

5674818,4,B00BUDDMGU,"Season 1 Episode 1 for Space 1999.

Do British shows have pilot episodes?  I don't know but if Space 1999 did this was it.

This episode is pretty much in the format I remember so there wasn't much difference between this episode and the rest of the series.

Cmdr Keonig takes command of Moonbase Alpha in this episode.  He seems to already know the senior members of the crew so there's not much character development or backstory going on.

Nuclear waste from Earth is causing problems on the ""Darkside"" (farside) of the moon and the good Cmdr must deal with it. No spoilers, but if you're a fan of the show you already know what happens next... and what happens next sets the stage for the rest of the series...

Eagle spacecraft are the sci fi hardware delight of this show.  Multimission & ever present.  Able to act as a construction crane, transport, or fighter - the Eagles do it all.  They must have a Eagle factory on the moon though because they do seem to run thru a lot of them....

Good scifi fun and excellent cast gets it 4 stars.. Although with Barbara Bain & Martin Landau - well known for ""Mission: Impossible"" - on the cast I do keep expecting Peter Graves to show up with a smoking tape player.

5674825,4,B00BUDDMGU,Space 1999 is a classic Science Fiction series from the 1970's. Most of the special effects hold up very well and the show has a high production value.

5674826,1,B00BUDDMGU,"I bought season one for the specific reason of giving this TV series a second chance, but the same reasons I tuned out Space 1999 when it first aired reared their ugly heads again.

Look, the production values for this program are top notch.  The sets, the costumes, the props, even the SFX are respectable for the time, but the one area the suits at ITC Entertainment skimped on, was the writing.

The stories are just not engaging, and the direction is intentionally given a 2001 Space Odyssey kind of sheen.  Well, Charles Crichton and his team of directors are no Stanley Kubrick, and even if Kubrick were to shoot a sci-fi TV series, his usual still photographer / journalist style might weigh on the viewers.

The other truth about British television back then (and perhaps now), is that it's an extension of the Briish government; ergo ratings don't have a whole lot to do with a program.  If it's seen as needed to help keep social and societal gears lubricated, then the show gets the nod and stays on, regardless of how far fetched or inane the concept.

Space 1999, even though it has high production values in terms of all of the physical parameters, falls into that category.

Space 1999's pitfalls are as follows; an endless supply of Eagles, lack of explanations for repairs (i.e. where do all the spare parts come from), food, air, water, how is it that moon is travelling at FTL speeds, but somehow ""slows down"" to visit worlds.  All that may seem like nitpicking, but sci-fi fans, even though they know they're overly meticulous, do give leeway to a lot of scientific inaccuracies, because even we realize that it's just a TV show.

But when you combine all these factors, and then realize that the only reason the show continued on in the UK was because the social psychologists in the UK thought it necessary, and not because the show was good, then one should get a wry smirk forming on their face.  I mean think about it.  Which would you rather watch?  Something someone made up without any demographic studies or government money, which was a little hokey but compelling and entertaining, or something like Space 1999 which had a failed social agenda and had plot holes large enough for a Mack Truck to drive through?

I didn't like it then, I don't like it now.  Sorry Landau and Bain.  I tried.  For your sake I'm glad someone liked your show.

Addendum;
I really can't stand this thing.  I'm on the fourth or fifth episode, and it's slow and ponder-some (in a bad way).  This thing should have been shot down after the first dozen episodes.  Why it was given a second, third and even fourth chance is beyond me.",1384473600,5,2638,4.594017094017094

5674843,5,B00BUDDMGU,"The first season of Space: 1999 is groundbreaking in its own way. The stories are more evolving than typical TV sci fi. Some of the stories actually approach early 70's European Sci Fi quality (think Tarkoovsky's Solaris). This isn't true with all of them but I'm glad to say that most of them are pretty good.

I'd like to point out to the Amazon reviewer that Issac Asimov not only had issues with the validity of the Science in this Science Fiction series but he also had issues with King Kong (body too big to support the weight, would crumble), The Incredible Shrinking Man (impossible to hear a man so small because his larynx would make his voice ultrasonic) and the Invisible Man (if truly invisible he would be blind because his retinas would also be invisible). It's safe to say anyone who feels the need to try to bring validity to science FICTION has some serious issues and sort of misses the point. So when a story like ""Breakaway"" comes around claiming that the Moon could be thrown out of orbit because of nuclear explosions, it's important to remember IT'S JUST A SCI FI TV SHOW with emphasis on the word FICTION.

The first season develops a strong core of characters around Landeau and Bain's leading roles Koenig and Russell. In time, these characters may have developed in popularity in their own right similar to the supporting Star Trek cast did but it was not to be. Much of the cast was scraped after this first season as well as its budget.

Fan's have their own favorites and so do I from this season so highlights for me are

Dragon's Domain, Death's Other Dominion, Black Sun, Collision Course, Earthbound, and The Infernal Enemy.

The transfers are as good as they possibly can be for this show and that along with the extras makes this the edition to buy. A&E did alot of repackaging jobs since they began releasing old shows but unlike those, these were made for blu-Ray.

5674848,5,B00BUDDMGU,"SPACE: 1999's first season was one of the best looking, well produced science fiction television series ever made. The standard DVD releases still look good today, with the ""2001: A Space Odyssey""-inspired production design & storytelling remain one of the most interesting experiments in the history of television.

Considering how good the DVD releases looked, it's astounding how good the blu-ray's look in comparison. I didn't think there was a lot of room for improvement but I am happy to be proved wrong.  The visual remastering alone is worth the very reasonable purchase price but the audio remastering completely blew me away when played through my surround sound audio system.  I had trouble convincing some friends who had never seen the series that this was produced in the mid-70's when they came by to take a look.  It's really that good.

Content-wise, the set has some nice extras like behind the scenes photos, images of the trading card set, some alternate versions of credit sequences and other nice archival extras but I would have liked some good episode commentaries.  Now that Gerry Anderson is gone, we'll not have a chance to get the man to lay down commentary tracks, a loss for fans of the series and for historians of the medium in general.  Love or hate SPACE: 1999, it stands as a unique & important milestone in the history of modern television, not just televised science fiction.

Unfortunately, plans for release of the second season seems to have been scrapped. Definitely not as good as the first season but still worthy of a good blu-ray release, if just for completion's sake.

Sorry; my frustration comes from nearly 20 years of dealing with the company and their home video releases, and their outright lack of any respect for those of us who need subtitles to view a program. To sum up my experience; A&E basically told me that it's not worth the expense of adding a subtitle track (because their buyers don't really need them), and since they weren't required to include them they weren't going to (I was actually told these things).

Do yourself a favor and bypass this release altogether and instead order the UK release version on Blu-ray from Amazon UK. I bought it late last year and was elated to discover it plays fine on my PlayStation 3. Great picture, terrific sound, and SDH.

5674859,5,B00BUDDMGU,"*** This has been updated and the recommended viewing order list changed. Take a look***

So I just received today the SPACE 1999 Blu-Ray Season One Set!

Does it live up to expectations? A few episodes in and I have to say... HOLY HECK does it ever!

And you really should spring for the Blu-Ray! And this comes from someone who is still not a Blu-Ray convert. I prefer the DVD form-factor, it's more aesthetically pleasing to me than the cheap dinky Blu-ray Boxes. And often there is a negligible difference in quality, particularly when the source has issues, or the studio just cuts corners.

In short, all things being equal, I'm not paying more for Blu-ray. However in the cases where there is a substantive improvement in quality, and great special features, and the price is competitive with DVD pricing... well then I'll pull the trigger.

Case in point SPACE 1999: SEASON ONE on Blu-ray. Wow! I saw this show when it originally aired, it never looked anywhere close to this good. It's staggeringly good looking and packed with commentaries and extras. It's going to be in the running for one of the best DVDs of the year.

But others can sing the praise of the show and the Blu-ray, I wanted to comment in regards to viewing order.

The order these episodes are on the Blu-ray set (and DVD) is production order, which is completely how they came out. However, it doesn't work.

I'll say again... viewing it as laid out, doesn't work.

I hit episode two, and I was like.... ""what the eff, did I miss something?!"". Because even though these shows are supposed to be more or less standalone, some scripts/stories juxtapose badly with other episodes, in the order they are on the disk.

I did a bit of searching, and watching, and studying other lists, and have finally come up with this, I think, rock-solid viewing order list. It stays pretty close to the production order except in cases where those changes substantially help to clarify the story or character development.

So without further ado, the viewing order that the show works best in.

I call this the HT Space 1999 recommended Episode Viewing Order List (or HT Space 1999 REVOL for short :)):

1. Breakaway
2. Earthbound
3. Black Sun
4. Missing Link
5. Voyager's Return
The first five follow the Kearley Episode list. Without doubt that gives a great opening to the series.
6. Ring around the Moon
7. Matter of Life and Death
Six and Seven is where I break with the Kearley List. This forms a loose 2 parter. With the possession of the Doctor in RING perhaps following her subconsciously into MATTER and perhaps helps address some of the inexplicable events that happen there.

8. Guardian of Piri
9. Force of Life
10. Alpha Child
11. The Last Sunset
12. Collision Course
13. Death's other Dominion
14. The Full Circle
15. End of Eternity

These eight episodes GUARDIAN to THE END OF ETERNITY (with the exception of moving one episode earlier in the season for story development reasons) follow production order, as I saw no substantial reason to move them around. And having watched them both ways they work best this way, adhering closer to production order.

16. The Last Enemy
17. War Games

I swap the order of THE LAST ENEMY and WAR GAMES, because in WAR GAMES it kinda heals the damage done to them in THE LAST ENEMY, and helps them get out of the habit of... preemptive strikes and finding enemies wherever they look.

18. Another Time, Another Place- Agreeing with Kearley's desire to have this closer to the end of the first season, I thought this was the ideal place for this episode. The largely space based and battle heavy WAR GAMES being a nice lead in for the far more metaphysical ANOTHER TIME, ANOTHER PLACE. And I think after the loss in ANOTHER TIME, the opening of TROUBLED SPIRIT is a great way to cleanse the palette and show a healing moment for the crew of Alpha after several shattering episodes.

19. The Troubled Spirit
20. Space Brain
21. The Infernal Machine
22. Mission of the Darians
23. Dragon's Domain
24. The Testament of Arkadia

And the final six episodes follow production order exactly and are a strong powerful wrap up for the first, best, and some would say ONLY true season of SPACE 1999.

Well this has been a lot of fun, a little work, putting this HT Space 1999 Recommended Episode Order Viewing List (REVOL) together. Hope it will be of help and use to some of you. Thanks!

5674860,5,B00BUDDMGU,"They did a great job remastering this series for Blu_ray! From the first sting of the new surround sound title music, you can tell you are in for something special.

Every Blu-Ray producer should take note of this example of how it should be done. It makes the price higher than DVD, but it's worth it, very worthy of HD. It helped that ITC recorded all these shows on 35mm film in the first place, but when you see the quality of the picture it becomes clear they went right back to the original film stock as the source for mastering the hi-def picture. The image looks like it could have been was shot yesterday. There is only an occasional slight jitter in some shots which stabilizes again in the next shot. It highlights the origins on film, but also shows how much trouble they took to make the 35-year-old film picture as rock steady as possible throughout for Blu-ray. Some of the effects have been cleaned-up too, but done very sympathetically with the original effects to bring them up to HD quality and not obtrusive at all. The disc extras are good for a series made before the era of DVD (or VCR).

Space:1999 itself is science fiction in the style of the original series of Star Trek. It has a crew, facing a situation-of-the-week, traveling through space, but this time on a moon implausibly but spectacularly jettisoned from Earth's orbit. The fact that they don't control their path through space is the main driver of tension in the plots. The crew seem mostly helpless in the clutches of more powerful foes. Many stories left some questions unanswered, which gives the whole show a more metaphysical feel. But, this was by no means the best sci-fi show ever. There was some dodgy science in it. The characters were a bit two-dimensional. The costumes look like they are walking around in their pyjamas! The visual effects are basic by today's standards but well done. But these were of the time and just add to the nostalgic charm of it now.

There was a lot of good stuff in there too, unique to Space:1999 at the time. The main mission set was vast and impressive, while the other sets created a suitably chunky and claustrophobic feel for the moonbase that was described by one character as a ""barracks in space"". Combine that with simple visual effects and elemental sounds and Barry Gray's atmospheric music and you had episodes that were more suspenseful and atmospheric than action-packed. Anderson's trademark model effects were top notch and Blu-ray really shows up the detail of how good they were. The titles and theme music are, in my opinion, the funkiest and most exciting I've ever seen and heard. You won't get an orchestra combined with guitar rock in TV themes now. What a loss. All those things go to make the show very fondly what it was - unique. Let's have Season 2 on Blu-Ray too!",1328227200,12,2823,4.630738522954092
5674861,4,B00BUDDMGU,"This sterling boxed set not only brings back cherished childhood memories, the exceptionally stunning quality of the high definition format greatly enhances the lavish production values and adult-oriented concepts of the show. As a child of the 70s I enjoyed the laser effects, aliens and spaceships of Space:1999. As an adult of the 21st Century, I greatly appreciate the metaphysical narratives and interpersonal relationships of the characters I failed to ""get"" the first time around. Martin Landau should have received numerous Emmys for his performances, while Barry Morse simply makes the show- deserving several Emmys of his own. Sure, this over-the-top ""what if"" concept series may seem a bit ""cheesy"" by the standards of today's science fiction audiences, but as one of the inspirations for ILM special effects technology, and as a then-revolutionary vehicle for ""too cerebral for prime-time American television"" storytelling, this series set the bar for challenging, thoughtful space drama. However, hipster audiences below the age of 30 will probably be bored with this release, seeing as how it's pre-CGI, and features simple, earnestly straightforward storytelling. My hope is that this collection will lead to a reimagining of the show for today's audiences, as Space:1999 seems to have what it takes to become a long-lived multicultural touchstone... perhaps England's answer to Battlestar Galactica (with all due respect to Dr. Who, naturally).",1325980800,2,1460,5.551569506726457

5674868,4,B00BUDDMGU,"If you have seen the movie ""2001 A Space Odyssey"", you will recognize the influence that movie had on the design and look of the sets used for the moon base and its support vehicles: they look realistic and are beautifully done.  While ""2001"" is hard science fiction - meaning it stays within known science and its extrapolations - ""Space 1999"" is not hard science fiction.

The basic story: Earth's moon has acquired the magic capability of flitting around the universe; slowing - briefly - as it passes colorful Earth-sized planets and assorted mysterious phenomena with space aliens aplenty.  Unfortunately for the personnel of Moon-base Alpha, they have no control over this starship Moon; they are along for the ride.

Their fervent hope is that someday they will pass a planet that they can settle.  They are led by the stoic Commander Koenig who has a restrained romantic interest in Doctor Russell.  She plays aloof, but obviously has a latent reciprocal interest in him.  When Koenig needs advice, he turns to Professor Bergman who speaks fluent scientific twaddle.

Overall: the episodes rate from 2 to 4.5.  Blue-ray experience:  The time it takes to get to the main menu after inserting a disc is faster than most.  Discs 1 to 4 each have 5 episodes; on Disc 5 the menu lists 4 episodes: a fifth episode is tucked away in the ""Special Features"" menu.  Disc 6 & 7 contain only so-so special features.

Even as a kid in the early 1970s, I knew there was precious little rationale to any of it. An Anderson production really had only one thing to offer me, the vehicular model designs! For 1999, it was the Eagle Transporter! Apart from the Eagle itself, many of the planetary visual effects are still impressive as is Moonbase Alpha itself. The cross-shaped elevator lifts that bring the Eagles up from their underground bays are also just plain cool.

The visual restoration of the series is really stunning. Clearly, the original film elements were in great shape and obvious care was given to making the best use of them for this Blu-ray release. For the most part, colour saturation, black levels, and image detail are better than I could have expected from a television series closing on forty years old.  That's as much a testament to the work of the original production crew as it is to those who undertook this restoration.

Beautiful, amazingly beautiful on a new 60"" Ultra High Definition flatscreen television (everything nearly looks 3D....), Surround-Sound, visually-striking transfer, with all the bells and whistles of the amazing UK Re-imaged product a few years back.  I was even pleasantly surprised that they not only added new episode-by-episode reflections by cast and directors (would have been nicer to have had additional cast members, but no worries..), but also kept ""The Metamorph"" 2nd Season opener as an extra.

Here's is, by most accounts, THE science fiction show of the 70s (some have said the best sci-fi series ever..) as a delightful visual and audio treat for any lover of 'Mysteries in the Cosmos'... A solid, artistically-adventurous series which will scare and delight all viewers, and to those who enjoyed the show when it was first presented, a warm reminder of majestic quality in television viewing no longer seen in today's CGI world.

It is THE set I've waited decades for, and on the big UHD flatscreen with DTS/SS stereo, it does not disappoint..!!  You only have to listen the swirling sandstorm in ""The Last Sunset"" to truly appreciate ALL the hard, painstaking restoration work done on this series.

5674871,5,B00BUDDMGU,"I had to laugh when I saw another reviewer's review, wherein he said that he tried to thwart his mother's attempts at putting him to bed when he would rather have been watching Space: 1999.  As I recall, it came on in Illinois, where I grew up, on a Sunday afternoon.  There was only one time in a month, where I could watch it, as we were at church meetings during other times.  I would often feign sickness to stay home and watch and tape record (back then there was no way to video record) it.  Surprisingly, through this method, I managed to see almost all of the episodes over a few years.  I, too, was absolutely stunned when I saw how wonderful the quality was.  I have only just bought a Blu-Ray player, but didn't notice too much difference on my small TV with RCA plugs until I bought a good HDMI cable and put it on our big screen TV upstairs.  Wow!  I compared it with some movies, which I had also purchased on Blu-Ray, and which, I must say, were not as different from the DVDs in quality as I had expected they would be.  However, Space: 1999 is a hundred times better.  Like the same reviewer said, you will want to throw out your DVD collection of Space: 1999. (I have several of them:  an American version, a German one, a French one, and I was able to get ahold even of an Italian one that someone had recorded from Italian TV, but which is in as good of condition as you could want on DVD, but the Blu-Ray is leaps and bounds over the DVD, both in sound and picture.)  I can not believe the difference from DVD to Blu-Ray and anxiously await the second season.  Hopefully we will see it soon (I worry the bad economic conditions might somehow prevent it, or slow it down, as with so many other series, but best not to be a pessimist.  1999 was actually pretty popular (it came out on DVD even before Trek, if I remember)) and be able to enjoy it as much as the first season.  The seasons are so different from each other, that the fan base for each talk about them on e-mail threads like completely different shows.  But I love them both for what they are and am hopeful it will be soon they will be brought out!

Please do yourself a favour and get these; I promise you, as the other reviewer, that it will be impossible for you not to be completely impressed.  I've never believed quality differences from the original show to Blu-Ray like this even possible. But here we have witnessed it.

Happy viewing!!!",1301443200,2,2430,4.277899343544858
5674872,5,B00BUDDMGU,"I like Space 1999 so having it come to BLU Ray is a dream realized for me. Yes 30 plus years later the special effects aren't that special anymore in a world of today where CGI if done right can make anything look pretty darn near real. However taken in context of its time Space 1999 was the bomb biggity with no equal. Star Trek the original series had just gone off the air. UFO the other older Gerry Anderson franchise had just finished its wild run. Next comes Space 1999 on the heals of UFO continuing where UFO left off.  The Moonbase was a small cluster of tiny spherical habitats in UFO which was set in 1980's Earth.  In Space 1999 a scant 19 years later the Moonbase had transformed which is now called Moonbase Alpha.  Moonbase Alpha 19 years hence is a sprawling concrete city with rather comfortable accomodations for some 300 plus people.  The Eagle Transporter a bug like utilitarian workhorse space craft had made routine flight to the moon a reality.  From the appearance of the technology of Space 1999 we Earth has managed to develop a stable cheap easy to reproduce Fusion reactor.  Eagles traverse the distance between Earth and Moon in only a few hours when our initial 1960's real life trips to the moon took about three days in the best conditions.

Of course everyone who loves Space: 1999 knows the how adventure staring Moonbas Alpha began.  Space 1999 begins with the moon breaking away from Earth orbit as a result of a chained series of massive thermonuclear explosions spawned by the decades of atomic waste stored on the dark side of the moon. The science of Space 1999 was suspect. The Space 1999 Year 2 sets were often cheesy redo's of year one sets.  Space 1999 year one were by far the more compelling stories for sci-fi purists.  The special effects were in their time first rate.  The acting while wooden at times was just real enough to make Space 1999 year one worth watching.  Moonbase Alpha year one had that well lit sterile feel taken most directly from the moonbase of 2001 a space Oddessy fame.  Moonbase Alpha also had a funky leisure suit 70's eames era furnishing flava that made you wonder why the moonbase did not have its own disco.  Year one made Moonbase Alpha feel like a real place.  The stories generally had an energy all their own.  There were a few clinkers in the bunch but most of the epiodes in Year 1 were strong.  Space 1999 plots generally plodded along at their own pace.  There was none of this keep the action coming, with quick cuts and franetic excitement.

Space 1999 year one was a thinking person's sci fi. Unlike Space 1999 Year 2 and its absolute abundance of rubber suited monsters Space 1999 Year 1 forces its audience to ponder deeper issues of humanity and our place in the universe.  Blue Ray makes the sets look better in some ways but extra clarity also brings for sharply into focus the limited budgets that hampered the production of Space 1999.  Add pre HDTV production values to today's screen sizes that routinely approach 55 inches diagonally measured and Space 1999 sets and special effects take on a Saturday Morning Bubble Gum Fantasy aura.  However for those who truly love Space 1999 we will look past all the warts and enjoy this Blu Ray version of Space 1999 because; with its sharper more detailed images we get closer to that special world that was, is and will forever be unique to Space 1999 Year 1.  I brought this Blu Ray version of Space 1999 because; I am a true fan and at this price it was a good bargain compared to the redicious prices sought for anything related to Star Trek!

People laugh today about Space 1999's overly optomistic vision of the near future however, that was the spirit of the 1970's still heddy over the moon landings.  The 1970's was a time when we felt technology could do anything if we just unleashed our imagination and creativity.  Space 1999 is a testiment to our continuing ability to dream the big dream for a better more peaceful world.",1301356800,4,3976,4.5647887323943666
5674873,4,B00BUDDMGU,"Watched this when I was growing up and was hooked instantly. Had a bunch of the toys and the big Eagle ship for years and maybe still do in storage. Have thought about getting the Megaset or 30th Anniversary set for quite awhile and kept putting it off.  Glad I did now that these are being released on Blu-ray with awesome clarity.  I haven't watched the whole collection yet, but the first few brought back some very fond memories.  I have a pretty large selection of movies and have been converting over the best to Blu-ray or just buying all the new on Blu-ray.  While this will cost you a little more money in the long run to buy the whole set, it is well worth it if you are a classic sci-fi lover.

Perfect...  I have been enjoying the disks for about two weeks now.  Things I remember.  Things I had forgotten.  Either way, a rediscovery both enjoyed and pleased by.  The price cannot be beat either.  I cannot wait for the season two to become available in Blu-Ray format.  I am willing to pay extra just to get it sooner.  I can only hope they revisit the UFO series and release it in a Blu-Ray format.

5674878,1,B00BUDDMGU,"And A&E does it again, shame on them. Although they have an amazing library of video spanning decades of interesting and entertaining shows, they choose to shun their non English-speaking viewers by not including subtitles, not even in English for the deaf and hard of hearing. A little investment in translation and subtitles, and maybe even not the translation, just the plain transcription of the dialogues, could have bolstered sales of shows like this one, UFO (the British edition by ITV Studios Home Entertainment does offer subtitles), Shaka Zulu and so many others. One exception is the new edition of Upstairs, Downstairs, which will be released next month and which seemingly will include SDH subtitles. However, it will be released through Acorn Media, so A&E is not off the hook.

If this edition had subtitles, either in English or Spanish (my mother tongue), I might make the jump to Blu-ray right now. I can only think of what Syndrome said to Robert Parr (Mr. Incredible): Lame, lame, lame!",1297814400,21,1007,4.994047619047619

5674880,4,B00BUDDMGU,"I've not read the other reviews, so I'm posting my thoughts blindly...
The reason the moonbase took less time to reach the aliens who said it would take 75 years to reach Earth, is because the moon went through a black sun 'hole' which propelled them light years across the galaxy.  I believe it was the second or third episode after 'Breakaway'.
I enjoyed the first season, but the second season seemed a bit cartoon-ish.  They shrunk the main complex, added a shape-shifter, and things went a bit awry after that.  It seemed more 'free adventure' than thought provoking.  I suppose science-fiction can have both action and science inspired plots, but when it focuses too much on action, it should just be considered futuristic setting drama.
I still enjoyed it growing up and enjoy watching it now on DVD as a means to remember the childhood days.  It was and is fun.",1295568000,6,869,4.690789473684211

As if they knew one day, someone would scrutinize it in detail. I had about 8 episode from the old DVD set but to have the entire season in HD is too good to pass up. I hear the UK release has better extras but I personally just want it for the shows themselves so this didn't affect my rating of this set.

I could string together all the superlatives I know and that alone could be my review. To be perfectly honest I've been a little on the fence about Blu-Ray in general until seeing this. I just had purchased and finished watching the Mega-Set last summer and it's like comparing watching a movie on a portable TV to seeing it on the big screen with all the whistles and bells. The colors and textures really pop.

The acting is contemporary and the stories intriguing.  After watching several season 1 episodes I can see how influential this series has been on Hollywood sci fi movies and TV shows that came after. This is seminal science fiction folks!

I appreciate the differences between both seasons of Space:1999 and anxiously await the remastering of the second season as well. One of the many bonuses not mentioned on the box is the inclusion of The Metamorph, the first episode in the second season of the show which introduces the metamorph shape-shifter Maya.",1294617600,2,730,4.879032258064516

Totally worth it ! complete with a remixed 5.1 soundtrack, and image quality that surprised me with the depth of colour and black levels.
A must for any collector of the voyages of Moonbase Alpha !",1294444800,4,451,4.433734939759036
5674888,5,B00BUDDMGU,"I almost bought the 17-disc DVD megaset.  I read the comments about the poor video quality and that a remastered set was soon to come out.  I watched a Netflix DVD of the first season one episodes and decided to buy the blueray set after all.  No regrets!  The video quality is stunning.  I watch these episodes with my 9-year old son and he loves them, too.  He cannot believe this show is 35 years old.

Season one is all new to me.  As a kid, I remember Maya on the show but not Professor Bergman.  Since Maya replaced Bergman in season two, I must have missed season one or was too young to remember.  I know season one stories are superior to season two, but I will buy the remastered season two when it comes out.  At least the sets and special effects will look good.  That is what I remember and loved the most about the show.",1294444800,2,834,4.176100628930818
5674889,5,B00BUDDMGU,"This is really done correctly here, these are cleaned up prints and really stand out.  The criticisms about special effects and storylines from a 35 year old show are lame; only twits criticize old shows for that,  so ignore them, for it's day the show really made sci fi serious on tv even if there's tons of flawed science here. But then back then people still thought dinosaurs were cold blooded lizards too. So why insult a old tv series on older science?. we now know that nuclear blasts wouldn't push the moon out of orbit but so what? ten years ago they thought nukes could destroy astroids and in fact they can't they just split them up, that doesn't mean my enjoyment for 1998's 'armeggedon' is one bit less!, so I just sit back and enjoy the ride when watching this season, and it's better than the second season for sure. I still want that season on blu ray too though.
 The tone of the show and it's interesting stories stand up very well today though , and the space ships are types which we could forseably build in 30 years or less. I was really glad to see this sci fi classic on blu ray. And it has the same prints that the network versions used! Gerry andersons cool stuff lives on , will ufo make it to blu ray? who knows but at least we have space 1999.",1294099200,4,1273,4.273858921161826

The remasters are brilliant with sharp, vivid colors and a crispness I didn't think possible.  The sound re-work is absolutely stellar in every respect.  The really sad part of this set is that the 16:9 aspect ratio is *not* included which is a major disappointment.  But then, take a look at the ""extras.""  While it is true that a number of the extras are simply the Space: 1999 Documentary chopped up into digestible segments, all of them are really interesting and the still photo gallery alone is amazing.  A die-hard fan since the show was first broadcast, I was certain I'd seen just about every still image around...apparently not as I'd venture to say that at least 50% of the stills (perhaps more) I'd never seen.

In short, if you're a fan, this is *the* set to own.  I can't imagine it getting much better than this (well, 16:9 would be better).",1293667200,4,1115,4.37378640776699

5674893,5,B00BUDDMGU,"One of the fond memories of my childhood is that of me sneaking around and trying to watch Space 1999 late on Sunday nights.  This was after the original run of the series on prime time, and it had gone into syndication.  My mother did not allow me to stay up that late on a school night to watch the show, so I had to conceive of MANY creative ways in which to thwart my mother's attempts to keep me from watching this show.  While she was able to catch me many times and send me back to bed, there were enough instances where I did get to see enough episodes to fall in love with the series.

Previously, I have owned some DVD copies of the series, but was always a little let down and how underwhelming the series was when compared to modern shows.  The colors were always washed out, and the sound was very tinny, as it was never meant to be played with a surround system.  If you're a fan of the show, and you currently own any of the previous DVD versions of this series, you will want to toss them after seeing 1999 on Blu-ray.  I was not prepared for the crisp colorful images that began to flow across my screen after playing the pilot episode.  The picture is truly stunning, and I would say that it even rivals that of the remastering of the Star Trek Original Series.  On the old DVD's the interior of Moonbase Alpha always seemed so bland and monochromatic.  While there are still a lot of creams and whites around, you will now notice splashes of color all over the place in computer displays and flashing instrument panels.

In addition to a major improvement in picture quality, the sound remix is AMAZING!!!!! Of course this series was released long before people began to hook their TV's up to surround systems, so on the original DVD's the sound was much as I remembered hearing it on a small black and white TV in our living room.  When the first explosion occurred in the pilot episode, I was very surprised to hear a deep bass coming from my subwoofer.  Of course these sound effects have either been tweaked, or completely re-recorded for this hi-def release.  If you prefer the original mono soundtracks, never fear, there is an option for that.  While the original sound effects are really closer to my memories, the new surround effects really add to the enjoyment of this series.

OK, now for my biggest surprise.  While I did love this series as a child, watching it on DVD was a little of a let down, because the special effects seemed very dated.  I expected that any restoration in hi-def would only amplify what I remembered as cheesy effects.  I was SHOCKED to see that the extra clear image provided by blu-ray really does 1999 a favor by showing the details of the models used for the special effects shots.  This show was not an offshoot of Star Wars as some may think.  1999 came out a couple of years before Star Wars was released.  While you may see an occasional wire attached to a character to help simulate the reduced gravity on the moon, the ability to see the details in the models is what really got me excited.  High definition actually makes these models look more life-like.  That was an unexpected treat with this new restoration.

Now we come to the star on the top of this wonderful package.  In addition to some special features spread out over the 5 blu-ray discs in the set, there are also two DVD's chocked full of extra features.  Many of these features are released here for the first time in the US.  There are audio commentaries, text commentaries, making-of featurettes, interviews, still photos, etc.

Bottom Line:  If you enjoy good science fiction, and can overlook some conflicts with scientific reality, then take a step back in time and see what good TV was like 35 years ago.  This set brings back so many good memories for me about my childhood.  I remember all of the elaborate tricks I tried to play just to be able to see this show, and it brings a smile to my face now that I can pop in a disc anytime and watch this wonderful show in a way that is far better than anything I ever expected.  Just in case I start to feel really nostalgic, I can switch on the mono sound track and sit up really close to the TV so my mother won't hear.  I swear that woman had bionic hearing!!!  Oh yeah!!!!!  Just one more plus to this new set......Instead of taking up several inches of shelf space for the DVD's, you now get the entire first season in a nice shiny package that takes up less than one inch of shelf space.",1291852800,98,4479,4.393203883495145
5674894,5,B00BUDDMGU,"Finally, A&E have got it right. As other reviewers have stated, the picture and sound quality are superb. The set consists of 5 bluray discs containing all of the episodes and still galleries, and 2 standard DVDs which hold the rest of the special features. The menus on the U.K. and U.S. versions are identical, with the exception of an added A&E logo before the 'Network' logo. Also, 98% of the bonus features included on the UK version of this set are included on the U.S. version. The only missing items from the UK version are;

- The Lyons Maid Ice Lolly Commercial ( which was included on Volume 15 of the previously released A&E DVD sets )

- Horizon behind the scenes footage - A BBC segment featuring an interview with Brian Johnson about the filming of special effects ( also previously included on Volume 14 of the A&E DVD sets )

- PDF format scans of selected scripts, and vintage ""Space:1999 Annuals"" ( British books for children featuring comic strips, stories, games, and photos ).

- A booklet about the making of the series and giving fascinating details on the remastering project.

Two unexpected bonuses are the full length interview with Sylvia Anderson, which was rumored to be edited down for the U.S. release ( it's not - I've watched both versions ), and the HD remastered year two episode ""The Metamorph"" on the 5th bluray disc. Until recently, this episode was NOT slated for inclusion on the A&E set and it's last minute addition may explain the delay in the release date. Testimony to it's late inclusion may be inferred from the fact that it is mentioned NOWHERE on the case artwork, which lists every other bonus!

At last American fans can see this series with the same fantastic audio and visual quality available that British viewers have enjoyed since 2005 ( when Network first released their HD remastered DVD set ). Kudos to A&E for putting out the money to create a quality product.

Now, we await the HD version of year two!",1291507200,13,1965,4.645533141210374

Color has been restored, especially in the opening sequence.  No more blurry back grounds.  Main Mission looks fantastic.  Wait until you see the restored detail of the Eagles!!  Looking at the pilots through the cockpit window and the orange from the rocket motors is excellent.  Sometimes, restoring a classic special effect show can bring out the flaws in the effects or production.  Not so with this release.  The audio, while it says 5.1 Dolby, actual decodes for me to DTS 5.1.  I have only heard audio from the Left/Center/Right speakers.  Maybe other episodes will provide surround rear audio. The audio is crisp and not compressed or distorted as are some of the episodes in the ""Mega"" set.  While this an expensive set, it's totally worth it!",1291334400,37,906,4.811688311688312
5674896,5,B00BUDDMGU,"We're huge fans of this show and are thrilled that A&E did such a good job of bringing the first season to Blu Ray.  We were very happy that the episodes are in presented the proper screen ratio (pillar-boxed) to preserve the original composition.  The show uses many unusual and artistic camera shots that make creative use of the 1.33:1 screen, and it would have been criminal to destroy that just to make the picture fit modern TVs better.  There has also been a film restoration done, so the picture is gorgeous, and a very effective 5.1 sound remix (although the original mono soundtrack is also available, as it should be).
One of the most amazing things about Space 1999 on blu ray is how well the traditional specials effects stand up to high def.  For the first time you can really see just how inventive and painstakingly detailed the model work actually was on that show.  It took a great deal of craft and artistry to truly bring a fantasy world to life before CGI, and Space 1999 on blu ray showcases that more than ever before.
Can't wait for season 2...!",1291248000,4,1069,4.518134715025907
5674897,4,B00BUDDMGU,"Who knew bell bottoms would still be in fashion in 1999?

The Blu-ray edition of the first season of ""Space:1999"" looks marvelous revealing details that were only hinted at on the DVD's released in the U.S. (which were pulled from 16mm prints)in these digitally restored and cleaned up episodes pulled from the original 35mm negatives. The show looks marvelous very much comparable to the marked improvement that we saw with ""Star Trek"" when it was remastered for Blu-ray and the last round of DVDs (although both shows because they were shot in different decades look different).

FYI, I did note a glitch on the second episode of the series towards the conclusion where there's a digital ""skip""--I'm not sure if it was just on my edition or if it is a problem with the entire set due to some sort of manufacturing or encoding error. Strange though it may seem A&E elected not to include SDH captions. I would think they would realize that the audience for the show is skewed older than others and it might be useful to have these. Let's hope that A&E realizes the error of their ways and corrects this by adding closed captioning because i for one would appreciate it.

A&E's release uses the same digital masters for this set and while this set doesn't include all of the original special features from the UK network release of the series, it does have the bulk of the special features carried over and but does contain two new commentary tracks on ""Breakaway"" and ""Dragon's Domain"".

The only things  missing from this set compared to the UK set are the 19 script pdf files.

The premise--As the Earth plans its first major intergalatic flight to the planet Meta, there are strange things occurring on Moonbase Alpha. The astronauts including those training for the Meta mission are becoming ill. Commander Koenig (Martin Landau) arrives on Alpha to get the Meta mission back on track. Dr Helena Russell (Barbara Bain who seems as if she has had botox injected in her entire face)theorizes that some sort of radiation from the silos storing atomic waste is somehow damaging the brains of the astronauts but tests run by Professor Victor Bergman (the late Barry Morse best known prior to this for ""The Fugitive"")indicate that radiation levels on the far side of the moon are normal. Koenig and his crew are pressured by Commissioner Simmonds to get the Meta ship launched. A magnetic storm generated by the atomic waste causes the Moon to be blown out of Earth orbit on an accelerating course out of the solar system forcing the Alpha crew to rely on each other as they make their way into the void.

Originally planned as the next season of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's ""UFO"" where the aliens tried to destroy Earth's moonbase by blowing the Moon out orbit, ""Space: 1999"" featured handsome production designs, top notch visual effects and production values and while the writing was flawed (and as been noted the ""science"" of the show could be silly)the show featured a top notch group of guest stars (Roy Dotrice, Christopher Lee (""Horror of Dracula"", ""The Lord of the Rings""), Brian Blessed (""I Claudius"")among others)and some terrific lead actors (Martin Landau (""Mission:Impossible"" the TV series, ""North by Northwest"" and an Oscar nominee for ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and winner for ""Ed Wood"") and Barry Morse)that along with the direction helped carry the show through despite the flawed writing on the show. ""Space: 1999"" is still entertaining due to the top notch production designs and the performances of most of the cast.

I much prefer the first season to the second season which lacked the sense of wonder that dominated the first season. Supervised by producer Fred Freiberger (""The Wild Wild West"", the third and final season of ""Star Trek"")the second season moved the series in more of an action direction. One of the few things that Freiberger brought to the table was his character Maya (Catherine Schell)a metamorph who could change into any creature and became part of the Alpha crew.

This set is definitely worth upgrading for long time fans of the show as the image quality is dramatically improved.",1291075200,28,4127,4.867521367521367
5674898,1,B00BUDDMGU,"if you like this series, you're brain dead.

The sets are great, but the scripts are ridiculously wrong about almost everything related to space.

Barbara Bain's character is useless, and/or she must be seriously medicated.

Unfortunately, I purchased the DVD version. Blu-ray no way.

The blaring music is typical of this genre, but it really gets old/loud quick.

The monster costumes are lame too.

What can I say that's good about this series. Did I say the sets are good?

Don't waste your money. This series is not worth watching, even in blu-ray.",1290902400,7,553,4.881720430107527

8573988,3,B00BUDDMGU,"I watched this as a kid.  I have very fond memories of it, so I was reluctant to watch it because I knew it would be awful but I watched it anyway to take a stroll down memory lane.  It was a fun walk, but Space 1999 really is awful.  The set wasn't bad.  The story was only 20 years into the future so the tech shouldn't have been too sci-fi-ee.  It is an interesting study of what they thought back then what the future would be like and an interesting study of what they used to make the set.  The acting was weird.  Some good; some bad.  Their emotions were ... lacking.  The science of a nuclear dump exploding into a rocket that launches the Moon out of the solar system is just too absurd.  So absurd that suspending belief is just too far a leap for mankind.",1528502400,,766,4.080536912751678

8573991,5,B00BUDDMGU,"I purchased this to compare it with my DVD Region 2 set, it and the Bluray edition are sourced from the same HD digital restoration but included extras differ.
Audiovisual quality is stunning with minimal grain and no visible pixelation, far better than the 2016 Bluray edition of the Star Trek original TV series.
The first episode of season 2, The Metamorph is a featured extra on disc 5.
The DVD release is a close second to this one and its insert & booklet don't get damaged by the disc case.
Onscreen DVD menus are boring compared with the Bluray's.

All Blurays in this set are REGION FREE, the DVD extras discs are Region 2, PAL video format, they will not play in a Region 1 & A player.
