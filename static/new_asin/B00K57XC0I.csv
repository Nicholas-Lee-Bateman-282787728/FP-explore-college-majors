8655892,5,B00K57XC0I,I think Pope Francis is a saint.  I respect and love him and his messages about what we are doing to our world and it's creatures.  He brings hope - a factor in this video.

8655894,5,B00K57XC0I,"Excellent overview of Pope Francis' journey to the Vatican- gives in sight to the man who would be Pope.  Catholics and other Christians will appreciate the simplicity, humility and his commitment to the poor among us, which is well demonstrated in this film.  There are parts where the narration is in Spanish with sub titles, but this does not in my opinion distract the viewer.",1437264000,,380,4.8307692307692305
