5643639,3,B00BLDJ42A,"""CZ 12"" or ""Chinese Zodiac"" opens with a brief introduction about a historical episode about twelve bronze Chinese zodiac statues looted from the Old Summer Palace in 1860 Beijing during the Second Opium War. Produced, written and directed by Jackie Chan, the film revolves around a treasure hunting team led by Jackie Chan's Asian Hawk, who is hired by Lawrence Morgan (Oliver Platt), a greedy billionaire and owner of a company trading in antiques, to steal the world's valuable treasures and artifacts.

The film's basic format is virtually that of ""Armour of God"" and its sequel ""Armour of God II: Operation Condor,"" with adventures featuring Jackie Chan and sidekicks (including beautiful women) against the background of exotic locations. The storyline is often incoherent, and female players (Laura Weissbecker in particular) are relegated to thankless supporting roles, but action set-pieces are enjoyable.

58-year-old Jackie Chan still pulls off his trademark physical comedy routines with flair, using props opposite Alaa Safi, but don't expect stunt work of his 80s and 90s classics. Kwon Sang-woo and Liao Fan are good as members of the treasure hunting team, but I think the film could have used martial arts skills of Caitlin Dechelle and Zhang Lanxin more effectively. Their martial arts scene is too brief.

In short, this is a good old fashioned action-comedy, though you might want more action and less comedy while watching it.",1366588800,2,1447,5.255411255411255
5643640,4,B00BLDJ42A,"Also known as ""Armour of God III.""  Jackie Chan stars as Martin, aka Asian Hawk in this action comedy. Chan delivers as expected. Heavy action, comedy, and over choreographed fight scenes.

Chan is a master thief who uses his ability to steal art work. His latest job is to find and obtain the 12 bronze heads of the Chinese zodiac which were stolen in 1860. The movie has a theme of western civilization plunder and returning the loot.

The beginning was great with Chan being a human toboggan during his escape, even if he went faster than physically possible. The scenes lessened from this point as a smart adult action comedy turned into a kids movie by the pirate scene which included one man who reminded me of Johnny Depp.

The ending tapered off as the plot became a bit odd with the volcano. Fun popcorn film. Just don't expect too much.

Why did Amazon not advise me BEFORE I did the purchase that this video could only be viewed in a particular region DVD player.  The DVD is not available for players that are sold in US.  I would have to order a player on an international site.  Amazon, you just look at my sales history and see how many Jackie Chan movies I have purchased, and this was a HUGE disappointment to my grandson at Christmas.  AND by the way I had to go to Best Buy to find all this information out.  At least they were knowledgeable AND helpful.  Boo to you for the pain you caused my grandson.

8570332,3,B00BLDJ42A,"***Review of American theatrical release, not DVD****

My wife and I made a point of seeing this movie on the big screen, not because Chan delivers big screen epics usually, but because any Chan film deserves some support from his North American fan base. Truth to tell is this film could alienate some of those NA fans with its kitchen sink and broad strokes approach to making an adventure film. I look forward to the eventual Region 1 DVD release and watching it subtitled and maybe cut differently. But we'll see.

You don't expect much of a plot in most Chan films and this one is pretty basic: JC (as he's referred to in the American dub--not as his Asian Hawk character that older fans of ""Armour of God"" and ""Operation Condor"" are familiar with) is an adventurer thief who, along with his crew, track down pricey artifacts many of which have been plundered from the treasure troves of many a country. Oliver Platt shows up as a scheming arts and artifacts broker and his appearance in a distinctly Asian film took me out of the film for a moment I must admit; he was a waste in this film. Anyway, JC and his crew are tasked to track down the twelve bronze heads of the Chinese Zodiac and get paid big bank if they get them all. What ensues is a focus on their first few conquests and it all feels haphazard with some quick editing and scene changes that would make a music video director feel at home. As Chan & co. (two younger men and a female partner) go on to ingratiate themselves with and bamboozle a group of young activists dedicated to the repatriation of national artifacts and a Parisian heiress interested in Chan's abilities to help her uncover what might have happened to her grandfather we are treated to Chan breaking into a rich Parisian's home and then narrowly escaping an attack by a group of Doberman pinschers and a trip to a southeastern tropical isle that feels like Chan is plumbing for some of that 'ol Indiana Jones plus Pirates of the Caribbean magic. But the magic just isn't there.

The scenes with the collector's bumbling security guards sticking Chan's team up with guns that aren't loaded (!) only to be shot at with real bullets from some south seas pirates (one looking more than a tad like Jack Sparrow) fulfills that old Keystone Cops feeling that Chan could pull off in some of his older films but it misses the Buster Keaton marks that made those films such classics. But fear not because the scene is about to change dramatically again after Chan's troupe decides to play nice and help the artifact activist's head science gal and help her get her captured brother and friends back. Of course these kids were taken by some of the brokerage house's goons because the activists are succeeding in getting the public to back off of buying stolen national treasures.

Once we get to the goon squad's hangout, an underground high-tech factory that helps to restore and replicate lost antiquities and art, Chan faces off with a new person, a rival artifact hunter. The two have a couch fight (...yes, they fight while managing to stay in physical contact with a couch....) and this fisticuff leads into one frenetic fight sequence to another and, while not Chan's best (come on, dude is getting up there in age) it is quite entertaining and shows off some of that old Chan magic. This last third of the film that also includes a skydiving fight sequence saves the film (along with the opening sequence with Chan in a high-tech skateboard suit--it was fun and would have been fantastic if a younger Chan was able to apply himself to it). This portion of the film is why you go to see a JC film in the first place.

The feature is capped off in usual Chantastic fashion with a series of bloopers and missed stunts and a moving collage of sorts of scenes from his entire career but there are two additional ending points that I've never seen before in a Chan film: (1) Chan himself gives a brief voice of thanks to his worldwide fandom while patting himself on the back over how proud he is of his accomplishments and (2) there is a Guinness World's Record note at the end of the credits that cited Chan as holding the record for accomplishing the most stunts in movies by an actor who is still alive! As to the first point Chan's voice talking to the audience felt a little self-indulgent; if a popular American actor did this he would be endlessly mocked but Chan's that peculiar talent who is driven to connect with his audience so I get it. As to the second point...that's just totally cool.",1382227200,,4534,4.544675642594859
