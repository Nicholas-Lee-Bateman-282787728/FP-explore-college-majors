5073991,5,B007BMIGZG,My nephew is a huge DBZ fan and needed this to complete his DRZ DVD collection. Also obtained Season One at same time,1355443200,,117,4.130434782608695
5073992,5,B007BMIGZG,"5 star! This was a gift. The person I bought it for is very pleased. I am very please with the quality and delivered as promised. I would definitely buy again. Recommend, you can buy with confidence.",1354752000,,199,4.405405405405405
5073993,3,B007BMIGZG,"I think it was a good buy. But the amount of filler cut is a bit too much for my taste. As well as the starting point. Some of the redone voices were an entirely different feel. Not quite sure how I feel about it yet. Aside from that it wasn't bad but they did turn it from an anime to a cartoon.
I would recommend it but personally i'm sticking with the original",1354147200,,363,3.918918918918919
5073994,5,B007BMIGZG,"I have been a DBZ fan for 20 years.
I stopped watching because I had thought I outgrew this show.

However, after reading about DBZ Kai, I became interested again.
This product is great with updated sound and visuals.

I love that it is straight to the point and no uninteresting filler episodes.",1353715200,,296,4.566037735849057
5073995,4,B007BMIGZG,"While it still drags on, most of the original complaints about DBZ have been fixed with Kai. The battle scenes are crisper, with less fluff and more action. I know some are upset about the change in voice casting from the original, but after an episode or two this becomes less noticeable. If Funimation decided to bundle the DBZ Abridged episodes along with this, I would be even more excited.",1349308800,,394,4.642857142857143
5073996,3,B007BMIGZG,I'm writing this for all the unfortunate souls that do not enjoy the original Shunsuke Kikuchi score. This does not have the Kenji Yamamoto. Yamamoto whom wrote the majority of the music you may have enjoyed on the Nicktoons version of the show. There is no option... Simply the original Japanese soundtrack. While I do enjoy it at parts it does take away from some of the action. While still being the most authentic to manga I still thought I would warn future buyers.,1346976000,11,470,4.607142857142857

5073998,1,B007BMIGZG,"I was disapointed in this product and returned it for some good reasons. They kept some of the bad  dialogue in, like when Goku disses beer on his way to Namek, and took good dialogue out like when Goku tells Ginyu that ki control comes from both body AND soul. Instead they replaced the alut/smart people stuff with watered down crap for people who hate metaphysical stuff and aren't actually paying attention to what is going on here. This contains some of the most important moments in the whole Dragon Ball story. Stick to Z at this point, Kai cuts out filler but they also make their product hard to skip forward scenes, it's much easier with DBZ and you won't miss anything good that way.",1499644800,,694,4.507936507936508

5074003,5,B007BMIGZG,"Back on April 5, 2009, Dragon Ball Kai made its Fuji TV debut to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Dragon Ball Z anime in Japan. Back then the music composer was Kenji Yamamoto (yup, that Nintendo guy heard in the credits of previous Mario Kart games and Metroid Prime 3). The idea for Dragon Ball Kai was to be more faithful to the manga where it's all about the action and less filler.

This DVD Box set I'm reviewing is Dragon Ball Z Kai Season Two on DVD. This set has episodes 27 to 52 in English Dub 5.1 and Japanese 2.0.
Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma have arrived at Planet Namek hoping to find the 7 Dragonballs that they can use to resurrect their deceased friends that died during the battle against the Saiyans. However, the ship they arrived in was demolished and now there's a power struggle between Vegeta and Frieza and they both struggle for the same thing: getting the Dragon Balls to wish for immortality. Goku's on his way to Namek and the Ginyu Force is about to land. How far will it go at planet Namek? All that and more is on Season 2.

The US release for those episodes only contains replacement music by Shunsuke Kikuchi. 
However, the UK release which I just happen to own today (see image,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yves-boisset-3-films-mythiques/dp/B00XHZQAUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yves boisset : 3 films mythiques</a>) does have Kenji Yamamoto music for the episodes on Disc 1 and 2 because Manga UK recycled an Australian DVD release (Dragon Ball Z Kai: Collection Three) into the Season 2 UK release leaving those English episodes unaltered. Now that's the way it should be. And besides, Dragon Ball Z Kai Season Two on Blu-ray and DVD was eventually released in the UK on September 28, 2015 and that's just a PAL Region 2 DVD BOX set for those who have capability to watch Region 2 DVDs.

Speaking of the UK release, Disc 3 and 4 are just like this set here in the United States: Replacement music.
That's because the Australian DVD and Blu-ray version of Dragon Ball Z Kai Part 4 was released after the Kenji Yamamoto lawsuit.

Season 2 or Part 3 and 4, the choice is yours whether we like it or not.",1476662400,,2189,4.75

5074020,3,B007BMIGZG,"The Ginyu saga is absolute perfection, the perfect amount of dialog, action, silliness, seriousness and pacing. It perfectly sums up what Dragonball is about, the problem is what comes after. The Freiza saga is just so bloated in comparison, it picks up drastically (and awesomely) after Goku turns SSJ but the first hour and a half is so tedious.",1438128000,,347,4.898305084745763

5074028,3,B007BMIGZG,"Love the Kai episodes but the number and layout of the episodes for the Season 2 Blu Ray is poor. The season 2 blu ray ends with (spoilers) Freeza being cut in half. The final two episodes of the Freeza saga (Goku escaping, and the aftermath episode of them wishing the nameks to another planet and discovery Goku alive) are apart of the Season 3 Android Saga. It just seems like a cheap ploy to get you to buy season 3. While I plan to buy it because I love the series. I know a lot of people that would just want the Sayain/Freeza Saga complete without buying a 3rd season for 2 episodes.",1425340800,7,590,4.184210526315789

5074031,3,B007BMIGZG,"Whats on these discs is great and would be an excellent release, however they left out the last few episodes of the namek saga, freeza is cut in half and thats the last episode of these discs, so you don't get to see namek blow up or goku's friends get wished back to life which this arc is building up to. It just seems like a very unnatural point to stop(as if only to bait you into picking up the next season), it's not a matter of disc space either as disc 4 has fewer episodes on it then disc 3.
This is an otherwice excellent release, but the missing episodes leaves me with a bad taste. It is compatible with pal(europe) BD players, so no worries there if you are from this region.",1422489600,,688,4.141791044776119

5074033,5,B007BMIGZG,"Dragonball Z Kai is the definitive version and Season Two only maintains that.  Just wish they kept the soundtrack that was made specifically for it by Kenji Yamamoto.  I'm not too concerned about the whole plagiarism charges.  What Mr. Yamamota made for the soundtrack on this was a work of art.

The old Dragonball Z soundtrack is just fine, but if you get the chance to hear what originally was supposed to be in Kai, you will likely be impressed.

That aside, this is a pretty great set to own.",1416182400,2,498,4.488888888888889
5074034,5,B007BMIGZG,This exceeded my expectations and I just love how it looks and sounds! The quality is amazing and truly the best way to see the Frieza saga at its best!,1411171200,2,152,4.1

5074036,4,B007BMIGZG,"This is definitely the best way to watch Dragonball Z not only does it cut the filler down to nothing everything it keeps in is what is simular to the manga which we all know is action packed without any padding. Also the english voice actors do a great job reprising their roles it isn't exactly the same performances but its for the better. No longer is there any cheezy dialogue here its mostly the same as the manga which yet again is the way Akira wanted it.

However there are 2 glaring problems I cant overlook and its completely unacceptable for dvds I bought. The commericals at the beginning when I boot the disk is unskippable and unfastfowardable meaning every time I want to watch this I have to walk away for 5 minutes so that I can finally get the the main menu to watch. 2nd every single disk has its own unskippable commercials why? WHY? each commercial is 5 minutes long and with four disk if you want to watch a marathon of dbz kai you have to endure unskipable 20 minutes of comercials its so annoying. Thus I cant give it the perfect score 4/5 once the commericals are over the fun begins and yes after those aggravating comericals DBZ Kai is amazing",1408924800,4,1171,4.3963133640553
5074037,5,B007BMIGZG,"Love this!!!!! First of all ive always loved the Namek and Freeza sagas because it was the most epic adventure in all Db/DBZ history. plus the new voice actor for Freeza is amazing, truly making Freeza seem likesuch an ultimate villain. Plus Gohans voice is starting to grow on me.",1406937600,,281,4.64

5074039,5,B007BMIGZG,"Another great season of Dragon Ball Z Kai.  The action continues to move forward, which is one Kai's strong points, in my opinion.  For me, every episode feels like a step forward in the plot.  Kai does a great job of keeping the meat of the story arcs, and hashing out the integral pieces.  All things considered, it's a great buy for fans both new and old.",1404950400,2,358,4.298507462686567

5074045,4,B007BMIGZG,action packed. the way the show was intended. all filler gone. the ONLY downfall is it's not wide screen. im a little disappointing that they didn't redo this show in widescreen.....,1377216000,,182,4.903225806451613
5074046,5,B007BMIGZG,"I gave DBZ Kai Season One a glowing review. My only ""complaint"" was that the original Kikuchi music did not align with the scenes as it did in the original series (plus, some of his tracks are not even used). The same holds true for Season Two. However, it is (for me) a minor issue, plus I actually like a lot of the music choices when not comparing the placement to how it was in the original series.

Season Two contains the bulk of my favorite DBZ saga, the Frieza Saga. Even with the original Funimation dubs, I considered the Frieza Saga to be my favorite. Let me say that, of course, most of the filler is cut, allowing the series to move much faster. However, it never feels too fast, and though I am nostalgic for the filler, I did not miss any of it while watching this. Also, I can honestly say that I will never look at the older English dubs the same way again because they cannot hold a candle to Kai's dub. The English dub of DBZ Kai is once again spectacular. Firstly, the script is much more manga accurate once again. Thankfully, there are no more cheesy one-liners from Goku or Frieza. Then, there is the actual acting itself. It is simply SUPERB. Chris Ayres is Frieza this time around, and his voice is exactly how I've always pictured Frieza sounding in my head, ever since I first saw him as a kid. He captures every aspect of the character perfectly, making him out to be an evil, powerful dictator as opposed to simply an upper-class school bully. This is the first time I have been genuinely terrified of Frieza. I mean, I grew up with Linda Young's Frieza, but it simply cannot compare to this one. Not only did her voice not match the character, but the script Funimation gave her was awful. After hearing Frieza's lines in DBZ Kai, I don't know how I ever put up with the original English dub (though, considering I have never read the manga or watched the show in Japanese, I guess I didn't know what I was missing). Everyone else is terrific as well. Chris Sabat does an AMAZING job as both Piccolo and Vegeta here (and of course, the script is much better for him as well). Once again, the cheesy lines are gone (""YES! YES! I CAN DO THIS! UGH!"") and both characters are cooler than they have ever been (and I loved them both as a kid); plus, Sabat puts so much raw emotion into both. Krillin and Gohan are also voiced very well once again. This review would not be complete without me mentioning Sean Schemmel as Goku, especially since this is Goku's standout saga as he becomes the Legendary Super Saiyan. Again, gone are the sappy speeches (""Ally to Good! Nightmare to You!"") and corny jokes. Rather than get a goofy, quippy superhero SSJ Goku, we get an angry, vengeful SSJ Goku (""I AM THE SUPER SAIYAN, SON GOKU!""; and ""YOU WILL PAY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE!""). And I've always loved Sean as Goku (he is the first Goku I've known), but his acting here is the best he has EVER done as Goku. My word! You literally feel the anger and power with every word he speaks. You feel his sadness when Vegeta dies. I just can't express how great he is as Goku here.

Once again, the cleaned-up animation looks beautiful on Blu-Ray. The opening/ending credits and eyecatches are very cool, and the songs are very good as well. For me, this is now the definite way to watch the Frieza saga (in English, anyway). While I still can enjoy the old English dub, it really seems dated now that DBZ Kai exists. Whereas the original Funimation dub of DBZ made it a better-than-average cartoon, DBZ Kai makes it a truly enthralling, epic, almost cinematic experience. I have just ordered Season Three and I can't wait to watch it!",1373241600,24,3640,4.423248882265276
5074047,5,B007BMIGZG,"Dragon Ball Z Kai Season 2 covers the rest of the Namek storyline, where anti-hero Vegeta must join forces with the protagonists to face Frieza's henchman the Ginyu Force (a parody of the Power Rangers) and prevent them of obtaining the Dragon Ball's. The story gets more intense as while Son Goku (the main protagonist) is arriving on Planet Namek, the evil tyrant Frieza (most powerful being in the entire universe) starts to close in on our heroes.

While Kai is known as a remake of the series, it's mostly just cropped ""filler"" of the original series to cater more towards the original comic book's pacing. However, the Frieza battle in the original series is known for one of the most notoriously dragged out moments in the series, and Kai's cropping of it is highly appreciated.

The climax on Namek is certainly full of exciting battles, and it does contain some of the series most iconic moments (hint: it has something to do with why Goku is suddenly blonde in the cover art).

Without a doubt, Kai contains a story that is easy to follow, wonderful artwork, and intense battles. If one is looking for a great action cartoon, this will not disappoint.",1372809600,16,1161,4.70935960591133
5074048,5,B007BMIGZG,"If you bought dbz kai, it's probably for the best rendition of the dub yet, or lack of filler. The issue with this particular season is the amount of redrawn scenes; Out of the entire series, this boxset has the most. The redrawn scenes for the most part are painfully obvious. I sat there and could easily tell when the scene switched from normal to redrawn. The color and art style is vastly different and not as good. It just doesn't work.. The show looks pretty great when presenting original clips, but when the redrawn scenes come on, they are eyesores.

Censorship for this season is so-so; some scenes are heavily censored, while other scenes of the same caliber remain unchanged. Its a kind of inconsistent level of violence/blood. It seems all the alien blood is shown, but the scenes with human blood are cut out. Freeza is cut in half with blood pouring out, zarbon is punched through the stomach and bleeds, ginyu stabs himself and bleeds and coughs up blood, Nail has his arm ripped off and pours out blood. However, Vegeta no longer pukes up blood and doesn't have blood when he is blown through by krillin. These are just examples from the blu ray.

The overall quality of this season is still pretty high. The voice acting and cut out filler are worth the price, even though censorship and redrawn scenes get rid of some of the overall quality.",1369872000,3,1361,4.596707818930041

5074052,4,B007BMIGZG,"If you are looking for nostalgia I would recommend the orange brick box sets. If you are looking for a fresh new DBZ experience I think you will like this. I think a lot of the tension and excitement that was built in the original anime by dragging everything out forever has been lost, but in exchange you get a smoother and more to the point experience. I personally do not mind the filler from the original anime. The reason I got this is because nobody ever wanted to watch DBZ with me because the pacing was too slow and as adults we no longer have the time to make an effort to get into a show as slow paced as the original DBZ. Dragon Ball Z Kai has remedied that problem beautifully. The new english dubs on some of the characters takes some time to get used to but overall I think the new dialogue is better. Frieza's new voice actor in particular did an amazing job. The Kai version of Frieza is, in my opinion, much better than the original. The original aspect ratio is nice because it eliminates the cropping effect that we saw in the orange box sets allowing you to see more. Unfortunately if you are watching this on a widescreen plasma television you will want to be careful to avoid screen retention and burn in because the image does not fill the entire TV screen. All in all I would say this is a no brainer for hardcore fans such as myself. It is always fun to go back and watch the series and it is very entertaining to see the minor differences in DBZ Kai. It is a fresh DBZ experience!",1367971200,2,1508,4.239583333333333

5074054,5,B007BMIGZG,DBZ Kai is great.  No filler and way better than DBZ.  Pace is much more brisk so the sagas do not drag out.,1362268800,,108,3.652173913043478
5074055,5,B007BMIGZG,"As a fan of the Dragonball and Dragonball Z manga, DBZ Kai is a really nice addition to my collection. While I can appreciate the original for its own sake, this is the version I go to when I just wanna watch some of the story and not take up too much time. For those who know the original Japanese music inside and out, the music placement in Kai is a little weird, but if you can get past that it's fun to watch. The English voice acting is hugely improved upon compared to the American version of the original DBZ as well. Give it a shot!

Fans of the original DBZ will also remember this portion of the series as the extremely long Goku vs. Freeza fight. If you loved that fight the first time but wished it were a lot shorter in repeated viewings, this volume is for you.",1359331200,,776,4.139072847682119
5074056,5,B007BMIGZG,"All my buddies had the same complaint when it came to Dragonball Z.  It had too much talking, and not enough action.  The reason behind this was that while it was easy to animate the series, it was hard for the manga adaptation to catch up.  So Toei animation released a multitude of filler episodes that caused a multitude of inconcistences in the series.  However, the Kai dub, being created 10 years after the end of Dragonball GT, as a tenth anniversary edition of the story I loved, was amazing.  The biggest problem I had with the series was that it aged poorly for the Z series.  I still love Dragonball to death, and I don't completely hate GT, but the Funimation dub of DBZ aged like milk. As I got older, the dialogue seemed childish and underacted.  Except for the yelling.  Now, the unrated cut (DVD/Blu-ray) offers much better voice acting, with most of the same great cast, with the exception of Bulma (meh.,) Gohan (Good for the little boy voice, not for when he gets older,) and Frieza (thank God, he actually sounds like a dude.)  All in all, if you were hesitant to the series because of the filler (especially in the Frieza Saga) you'll definitely be swayed with this.",1357516800,2,1187,4.535211267605634

8513965,5,B007BMIGZG,"I had been a DBZ fan when it was airing back when i was in high school. while i do love dbz, i only really loved the frieza, android, cell saga's of dbz. i never saw anything past the perfect cell conclusion of season 4. i owned the second wave dvds that had the uncut versions of these episodes and have always loved them, but when i tried to go back to watching them, the fillers are what killed my love for the show. so when i heard about dbz kai, i figured i give it a chance and i was right! the frieza saga is so much better in this version. so much so that i had to get the next season!
if you love this part of the saga, then do it and purchase it! the useless fillers have been basically removed, making it a better version of the show.",1516924800,,745,3.9078947368421053

8513967,5,B007BMIGZG,"Chris Ayres really knocked it out of the park with his performance as Frieza, no offense to Linda Young (loved her as Genkai in Yu Yu Hakusho) but this is how Frieza was meant to sound! The dialogue is way better in Kai compared to the original IMO, especially Goku's ""I Am"" speech which always made him seem like a cheap Superhero wannabe in the original dub. I still miss Bulma's and Gohan's old voice actors but after a while you get used to the new ones who do a fine job.",1508371200,,476,4.184782608695652

8513969,5,B007BMIGZG,"I enjoy the story so much better with out the ""filler"".  Not a knock for those who love the original, which I do and have seen, but watching it with my family goes over a lot better in this format than the original.  I would lose some family members, which took a little work in sharing my hobby with, if the show I presented them with didn't keep them engaged.  Filler episodes and 5 episodes of powering up would definitely bore them to tears.  So this format works well, and they enjoy it.",1503532800,,492,4.258064516129032
