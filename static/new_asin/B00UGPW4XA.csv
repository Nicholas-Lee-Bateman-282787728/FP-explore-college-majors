8706092,2,B00UGPW4XA,"This video-movie stars a trio of actors in lead roles who had appeared together in ""West ficht Ost"", a movie which, loosely, is also thematically related, at least in part, to aspects of sex commerce. ""The Longing"" (""Saudadade"", also titled ""Sehnsucht"") eeems to have higher aspirations than much of any real achievement. ""The Longing"" depicts the three sexy friends from Germany together now in Brazil, operating a sort of Webcam venture.

As if to justify the relative crudity of its cinematography (if one dare even to use such a word in its regard), it is claimed that this movie takes as its prototype the Brazilian variant of the ""soap opera"" genre. Well, it looks limited even by that standard. The scenery is great. If one play this back at a 4:3 screen image, the some of the men are fairly appealing in a moderately beefy sort of way; seen with a full screen setting the muscular ones merely look bloated. However, perversely enough, one has to watch the ""making of"" special feature (way too long to sustain interest) at full screen setting or the boys look like scarecrows.

The story line is rather like a mediocre Italian ""verismo"" opera libretto gone gay. ""Boy kills guy. Boy meets the guy's brother. The two fall in love. Brother finds out from boy's tearful confession that Boy killed brother. The dudes cannot reconcile."" At least there is no second killing. There is, along the way, much ""p.c."" jabber about racial oppression, especially of black gays in Brazil. Pretty limited stuff. withal The mostly German cast of actors (one of them actually Swiss) in their roles as white tourists or expatriots, at least mostly, are amateurs and that shows. The black cast members fare only a little better in their roles as indigenously Brazilian.

Getting from the quality of their acting to the more encouraging question of sheer good looks, those tourists from Germany seen in the film fare better. The classiest-looking guy in the cast, for these eyes, is not muscle-bound Hendrik Scheider as Eric, but rather well-built but trimmer Tarik Qazi as Cyrus. Nonetheless, Scheider is the one who figures in the full-frontally nude scenes. In the one in which Schneider appears totally nude to delight the viewers' eyes, Scheider is totally buck-naked in a prone position, but his bulky musculature only succeeds in making him look like a beached, very pink walrus. That is not exactly flattering for a dude whose manly assets and rugged physique could be filmed a lot better nude than that in a scene of more skillfully, better camera lens-framed-and-composed shots of him.

Well, the film itself and its DVD are not quite for the trash bin. The video product is to keep for viewing maybe once or twice more. Then it goes, delayed, into the trash or to some thrift shop!",1504396800,,2778,4.842105263157895
