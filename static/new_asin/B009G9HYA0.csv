8541134,5,B009G9HYA0,"I THOROUGLY ENJOY THIS VOLUME.  WHAT A TREAT TO SEE WILLIE NELSON CLEAN AND WELL-DRESSED; I didn't know he started out by writing songs and I  think the other singers do more justice than he does, Ray Price,,Patsy Cline. Jim Reeves, of Faron Young.  My favorite singer/composer is Marty Robbins.  I especially enjoy the fun country singers have because they like what they do. I plan to buy more of these.",1387324800,,405,4.661971830985915
