8074542,4,B000A59PTC,I love Bety White and enjoy watchng Life with Elizabeth in my youth. She was funny in her early year on T.V. also. This DVD is worth the money and the fun you will have watching it.,1272412800,5,181,3.918918918918919
8074543,5,B000A59PTC,"I don't even know where to begin about this show. For, it's truly one of a kind. The premise was so simple, yet provided a lot of flexibility for storylines and entertainment!

The premise is that Elizabeth (Betty White) and her husband Alvin (Del Moore) are newlyweds who are getting used to living together. Each ""episode"" consists of three different vignettes dealing with situations that they encounter - most of the time revolving around Elizabeth stirring up some kind of trouble. Many of these feature just Alvin and Elizabeth; but some also feature guest roles for good variety.

The humor may be a bit hokey at times, and the overall presentation will be too simple for many - especially in this age where we expect complexity. But if you like to engage in simple pleasures, I believe that you will find comfort and joy in this show! Whether Elizabeth is reluctantly singing the theme song for the Women's club located next door to the jail for Alvin, or the couple is trying to hide their embarrassing country cousin from onlooking neighbors, there is hilarity to be found in the sheer lack of believability of it all!

I would recommend this two-DVD set over the other three commercially available single-DVD's, simply because you get a lot more for your money (even though they're all budget-priced). This two-disc set contains a whopping 16 episodes (and considering each ""episode"" contains three vignettes, that's really 48 that you're getting!). It may take awhile to get into it, but once you do, you'll be hooked!

Thank you, Platinum Disc, for putting this out...and please give us more!",1141689600,30,1605,4.889705882352941
