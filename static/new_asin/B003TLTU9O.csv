The voices in this film are authentic and original, capturing a slice of life you might otherwise never get to see.  Absolutely stunning cinematography.  At times humorous, at times heartbreaking -- it is a remarkable film.",1279843200,,394,5.2063492063492065
8405249,5,B003TLTU9O,"Too often we think of American culture in neat, little boxes: the cities and the heartlands, the avant-garde and the mainstream, the rural fields and the urban soul. Yet this documentary of small town hip-hop challenges all those traditional categories. Director Sabrina Lee takes us on a journey of ambition, from devastation to glory and back again, exposing the myriad of contradictions within us all.",1279756800,,404,5.230769230769231
8405250,5,B003TLTU9O,"Caught this documentary at a film festival in Chicago this Spring....What a compelling story of 3 very different men who find salvation and hope in their music!  All three very personal and human stories found me wondering about these guys months afterwards.  The film is so elegantly shot and edited.  The stark, sometimes comical, rural imagery is set off surprising well by the honest, thoughtful lyrics and rhythmic hooks of the soundtrack.  I'm so glad it's now available on DVD--this is a film that I'll want to watch again and again.",1279584000,,540,4.9010989010989015
8405251,5,B003TLTU9O,"I had the pleasure of viewing this film when it premiered at one of the nation's most prestigious independent film festivals last year. Whether you are a serious or casual fan of hip hop music, or just of music in general, you will be amazed at the stories of these three talented young artists who refuse to be daunted by their rustic surroundings in their quest to create compelling, provocative hip hop music. The gorgeous cinematography of northern California and rural Montana takes you miles away from the traditional glitz and glamour of New York City and LA, yet you can sense that any of these men could one day be Grammy-winning artists. First time director Sabrina Lee does an excellent job in editing and weaving the very personal and sometimes painful stories of each of the three main characters, as they seek to express and heal themselves through their own unique form of hip hop music. This film is sure to achieve cult status among independent music documentaries.",1279584000,,982,4.816568047337278
