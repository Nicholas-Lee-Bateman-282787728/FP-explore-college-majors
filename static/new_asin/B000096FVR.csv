I am a huge fan of Beach movies such as Hardbodies, Bikini Summer, Bikini Car Wash Company, Malibu Beach, etc. But this movie pales in comparison to the others in this genre. It feels like the movie isn't even completed, an huge parts of the segments are soundless. There's not even a lot of beach segments in this movie. The only thing I really enjoyed was bits of the 90's
soundtrack when it was there.
Don't let the title fool you. This is not entertaining, and there was long stretches of boredom in the film. Also, the quality sucks! it's
just a VHS rip!!
In my opinion if your looking for a good movie of this flavor, try these(my 3 personal favorites)

7989963,1,B000096FVR,"This is a really awful movie, a terrible, amateurish piece of garbage, and I should know, because I am IN it! I am billed 6th in the opening credits, so I wish I could say it's good. It is terrible, one of the worst movies ever made. The four girls who played the leads were very sweet, very nice, very pleasant to work with, but almost devoid of talent. There wasn't really so much a script as an outline. All of my dialogue, for instance, was improvised by me. When they were casting, they specifically looked for actors with improv backgrounds, because they were either too lazy, or more likely, too untalented to write the dialogue.

We made it in 1990, and it took three years to get anyone to buy it and show it. Finally the USA channel bought it, and then cut out the scenes of bare breasts, which cut almost 75% of my work from the film since, though I'm a man, and I remained dressed, most of my scenes were with the young ladies with their tops off. This at least meant my embarrassment every time USA broadcast the horrible thing was lessened, though it made my part so much smaller, viewers must have wondered why I had such good billing for such a small role.

Once USA stopped running it, I had hoped it was gone forever into bad movie oblivion. No such luck, as it is out on DVD. Trust me. It's not funny. It's terrible.

Also, it was shot in January. In the opening credits, you see the young hero jogging along Malibu Beach in a long, wide shot, and HE'S THE ONLY PERSON ON THE BEACH FOR MILES! Malibu in the summer has loads of people on the beach. But this was shot in the middle of the winter, and it was about 50 degrees out when they shot all the beach scenes. If you watch this wretched picture, notice how, in the beach party scenes for instance, that while there are a lot of people right by the beach house, partying, there is no one else on the beach. It was bitterly cold out for all the beach scenes. Next to this movie, BEACH PARTY with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello is CITIZEN KANE.

Trust me, this movie is better than PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE only in that it's in color, and there are a lot of naked female breasts. No sex, just breasts. 13 year old boys will love it. Everyone else should avoid it. Really. Trust me.",1211068800,8,2259,4.258741258741258
7989964,4,B000096FVR,"For the lovers of ""beach movies"", i.e. those who would settle for some enjoyable pastime without expecting any Oscar-racing stuff, there's at least a dozen flicks with the name Malibu to choose from. ""Malibu Beach"" gets a lot of attention in the 70s, then come ""Malibu Express"", ""Malibu Bikini Shop"", ""Malibu Hot Summer"" (otherwise known as ""Sizzle Beach"") in the 80s, to quote a few... Yet ""Malibu Summer"" still enjoys a warm welcome when it comes out in 1993. Apart from all the fun things associated with the beach (surfing, volleyball, beach parties, topless suntan lotion treatment...) this movie does have an amusing script and, oh yes, four beautiful babes.
Rhett Sinclair is Stacy, a college student who is so tired of her clerical summer job at a firm named ""Fantasy Encounters"" she decides to talk her friends into starting a similar business of their own. So Stacy, Jill (Brittany Noelle aka Nicole Grey), and Lisa (Carrie Bittner aka Alycin Sterling) team up with ""Fantasy Encounters"" former employee Marcia (Randy Rudolph) to launch ""Fantasy Girls"", a company that offers every man a chance to make his fantasy come true -- on a ""nothing illegal, nothing kinky"" term (meaning no sex involved, mind you). Despite some funny twists and turns, the girls end up making 20,000 bucks before summer is over, and better yet, they all end up in the right lanes to happiness some way or another.
Bottom line? Certainly ""Malibu Summer"" doesn't go any farther than its tag line (""The beach just got hotter""), and maybe that's all what I expected. So I give it four stars, one for each girl. Wish they would team up again.",1059177600,6,1622,4.838129496402877
